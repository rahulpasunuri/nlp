this is an amazing gefilte fish not only for passover but for year around shabbat dinners. I used only 1 cup of water, baked for nearly 2 hours and still had a lot of water on the bottom of the mold, so if that happens to you, make sure to drain the water before un-molding or you will end up with a hot mess! I also pureed the onions after sautéing them. this is a keeper!!!

This is a phenomenal recipe! I've made it a few times, both in a muffin tin and in a bundt pan. I like the latter better - it's prettier and easier. I agree with another reviewer - you can reduce the water. I only used one cup. I used frozen wild fish from Trader Joe's. Salmon and some other white fish - whatever was a good price and wild and it's always come out perfectly. This was a HUGE hit at all the seders I've brought it too. Goes really well with the Lemon Horseradish recipe also here on epicurious.

I had likened making gefilte fish to brain surgery--something you left to the experts. When I ventured that I might try it for the upcoming seder, my hostess encouraged me by pointing out that "it couldn't be any worse than the stuff in a jar." This recipe is delicious, adaptable and easy. I did a trial half-recipe using cod and smoked whitefish. Delicious--husband & daughter raved. For tomorrow's seder I did it with 2# cod and 1/2# each smoked whitefish and smoked trout. The smoked trout adds a depth of flavor that is fabulous. Truth is I think you could use any combination of fish and be happy. I used and recommend the muffin tin method [flatten the top so it rests nicely when inverted for serving]--nice individual servings that look pretty on a lettuce leaf. And, OH--the lemon/horseradish sauce from another recipe here = fabulous.

Made this yesterday for seder and it was a real hit! We used salmon, halibut and smoked salmon from a fishing trip to Alaska (very lucky!) and it was delicious. The only changes I made were no sugar, double the salt and half the water per other cooks recommendations. I used 2 loaf pans and cooked 1 hour. At that time I uncovered, poured off a little water that was on the surface and cooked 10 mins longer uncovered. One emerged intact and the other broke when I was removing it. But after a few hours in the fridge it was fine to serve. Guests were raving about it-- I will consider making it year round.

Made this again, after last year's success. This time, I was able to procure halibut to use with the salmon (used sole before)and made 3/4 of the whole recipe, cutting the water down to 3/4 cup. Last year, I baked it in muffin tins; this year I did two loaf pans. There was a lot of liquid floating on top and terrible cohesions problems. Part of the problem may stem from the "diced" onions - the pieces were too large, sticking out, and preventing a nice even cut. Still, it tasted good (even though I completely forgot to add salt). Next time, I will chop the onions and go back to the muffin tins.

We liked this receipe a lot. Made it with fresh wild salmon and halibut, but cut the recipe in half and baked it in a loaf pan. Next time I don't think I will add any sugar. Also, cut the water as suggested. I followed the advise of others and reduce the sugar by half and in proportion. Additionally, I would add a little more sale.

I made this for our family Seder. It was delicious, and not that much trouble with the help of my trusty food processor. One of my guests donated some fresh Alaska halibut and silver salmon to the cause. I love this modern take on the laborious original.

Excellent! Received recipe demands. I used sole instead of halibut, Vidalia instead of Spanish onions (on sale!) so cut the sugar down to 2 tsps from 2 Tblsps, reduced water to 1 cup and used the 24 muffin tin in water bath procedure. forgot the dill garnish but c'est la vie. I don't have a mixer so I couldn't do the 10 minute whip - relied on my husband's biceps instead.

I'm not Jewish but my in-laws are and they love this recipe. I have made this for several Passover Seders and it's a crowd-pleaser; even from those who claim they dislike gefilte fish. It works equally well if you substitute leeks for the onions and parsnips for the carrots. If halibut is not available, any firm white fish (pike, Cod) will do.

Rating: 4
This was without a doubt the highlight of our Seder dinner for me. I used fresh halibut and frozen coho salmon, reduced the water by half and did everything else as directed. I served it with red horseradish and the lemon horseradish sauce discussed in other reviews. I cooked it in silicone fluted cupcake cups and it made 24 plus 4 large muffin tin cups worth. The thing I'd change is that I'd make 1/2 the recipe to cut down on cost but we've really been loving the before Seder tastes and leftovers.

Flavorful and fabulous! I made 1/2 a recipe for our small seder, used cod, (halibut was too expensive), and reduced the water in the recipe by half. (I followed the suggestion of a previous reviewer because the cod looked a little watery.) Used a loaf pan to make it more "terrine-like." And, after all my efforts, forgot about the water bath to bake it! To my great relief, it was still wonderful. Took 45 mins. to bake, (30 mins. covered with foil, and 15 mins. without). What a great modern-day take on gefilte fish!

Oh my goodness, this is transcendent when you incorporate a number of the changes and suggestions posted by other reviewers. I just made a 1/2 recipe (12 servings) using the muffin-tin method. My fish combination was 1/2 lb. each cod fillet, salmon fillet, and smoked trout. I think the smoked trout, which I use in another Epi recipe for Smoked Whitefish Gefilte Fish, really kicks up the flavor on this. I baked covered with foil on a rimmed baking shet with about 1/4" of water in it for 45 minutes and then uncovered for 30. Cooled about 10 minutes before easily and gently removing them to a platter to chill. Husband and I just tasted one with the Lemon Horseradish Sauce from aofrementioned recipe, and agreed it's a winner. Cant wait to share with our guests at Monday's Seder. I will absolutely be making this our go-to fish course for Passover.

Am planning this for my Passover 2001 first course, and will take the suggestions of the four-fork reviewers, as well as Melissa Clark's idea about adding thinly sliced carrots. I cannot fathom the disappointing outcome experienced by the cook from Toronto. Am also wondering if this could be done in a similar-sized Le Creuset rectangular terrine. Any thoughts?

I have made this recipe many times ever since it first appeared in the NY Times.My family raves about it each time I make it. The first tip I have is to use only 1 cup of water in the recipe. Two cups make the fish taste "wet" and excess water oozes from the fish afte it is cooked. With less water the cooking time is accurate and the fish will not be overcooked. I use a silicone ring mold that is well oiled to cook the fish and place that in a water bath as directed. I saute the onions a few days befor the actual making of the fish to save time and mess on the day of assembly. I saute all the onions for all my holiday recipes at the same time. I have successfully substituted dover sole and pollack when I could not find halibut. This year I bought the frozen wild halibut from Costco and it was delicious and easy to use. I have also assembled the whole terrine ahead and frozen it ,then cooked it for the holidays. I grind fresh horseradish root with raw beets and vinegar for a tasty traditional accompaniment.

I made this for Passover this year and most of our guests loved it, BUT: After it was finished baking, it kept oozing water onto the plate - water on the sides and water in the middle. Maybe this was because the fish I used wasn't properly defrosted? or because I don't have an electric mixer so mixed it by hand? Any ideas?

I wanted to come back and add a review here. I am not Jewish, nor do I portray it on TV. I've never had gefilte fish - I've always heard terrible stories about it, and seeing that jellied stuff on the supermarket shelves just grossed me out. However, I did have a small party last night, and one of the women who was attending is Jewish, and she's rarely able to travel home to spend Passover with her family. So on her behalf, I made a Passover meal (the best I could anyway, for not being uber-familiar with the faith). I wanted to provide food that all the rest of us Gentiles could also enjoy :) I came across this recipe, and I decided to try it. It is, in fact, fairly similar to a "fish cake" recipe I already prepare for my own family, and they love. (Of course there are many differences, but it was similar enough to convince me to try it.) I also took the advice of some others and prepared it in a muffin pan (I got 12 cakes, filled to the top and leveled). The first hour was covered, the last 30 minutes I increased the temp to 375 and baked to get some color on them. I also used the lemon-horseradish recipe used on the "Smoked Whitefish Gefilte Fish" on this site. That sauce alone was worth all of this effort - I swear I'll be making that again LOL but the gefilte in this recipe? DELICIOUS. I made 12 of them, and there were only 8 people attending the event. At the end of the night every last one was GONE. These are incredibly delicious, and I would make them again in a heartbeat, and not just for Passover either. By the way, I replaced the Halibut with Cod (it was on sale and MUCH cheaper) and divided the recipe by half. But this was terrific - even my 4-year-old finicky son pronounced it "delicious!"

Gave this 4 forks because it's about the best Gefilte fish I've ever eaten. My preferred way of eating Halibut involves only salt, pepper and a grill. This is expensive to make but it was a huge hit at our Seder.

Made this for a seder for 18 people, and it was a huge hit. It looked very impressive, and lends itself to beautiful garnishing. The taste is delicate and appealing, and the clean, non- jellied texture is good for gefite- phobics. Two caveats: (1) The fish  especially halibut!  is very expensive; this is a costly dish, especially for an appetizer. (2) This makes a large quantity, and even serving 18 people, I have a lot of left over. Perhaps next time Ill cut the recipe in half, although that may affect the cooking time. It was good with horseradish, but the dish is mild and I also see the appeal of some reviewers suggestions to use a less sharp condiment, or to cut the horseradish with mayo or yogurt / sour cream.

I hate to burst everyone's bubble, but the gefilte bundt was just OK. The only flavor I detect is the horseradish served with it. Yes, this will feed 20, since I didn't even serve half. I'm worried that my family will be tired of the fish before it's eaten, therefore i'll have wasted lots of $$ on the dish. Next year, I'll try a friend's gefilte and spinach pie. I ended up cooking for 1 1/2 hours since I had soupy liquid on top after 1 hour of cooking. Perhaps the steam from the vent in the bundt pan just accummulates on top of the loaf during cooking. The last 30 minutes were uncovered. For the effort, I'd recommend making traditional gefilte fish.

I made this recipe for the Passover seder again this year, and it was fabulous. One child in the family is allergic to salmon so I substituted a pound of smoked cod for the salmon, and cut down on the salt, which worked very well. I used an angel food pan instead of a bundt pan, and garnished each plate with grated purple and yellow beets, along with dill sprigs. Gorgeous, and delicious. Fed 25.

Everyone raves about this dish, and I am almost sorry I introduced it to our family passover dinner as I am now requested to make it every year. Good thing it's so delicious! Even non-gefilte eaters ask for more. (I do, however, cut the sugar in half!).

Once again, this fish dish stopped the show. Served with home made beet-horseradish, everyone raved. Gefilte fish haters asked for "small" tastes because of all the positive comments coming from around the Seder table. Here's one additional idea about leftovers. Freeze individually wrapped slices in plastic. They can be defrosted in the frig or quickly defrosted in the microwave...(don't let them get warm). What a great taste and memory treat.

The muffin pan idea worked beautifully and unmolded easily. What a great substitute for gefilte fish, and not too challenging for sedar traditionalists! Took 90 minutes to cook (I uncovered the pans at 45 minutes)

Hi all! I made the terrine in the muffin tin the same way as instructed: covered with foil and cooking in a pan of water. It did take a while longer than stated in the recipe, which surprised me, but I just kept it in until firm. The presentation really works, though! Enjoy!

I've made this recipe several times over the last number of years and I really love it. I was intrigued by A Cook in Los Angeles' idea of making it in a muffin tin.

My family dubbed this "gefilte bundt." Most loved it, though a few non-terrine eaters were weirded out by the presentation. I followed the recipe, but substituted a pound of smoked red trout for one pound of the halibut. Excellent! Baked it for 1 hour covered and 1/2 uncovered, as suggested by many cooks. Worked perfectly. This recipe is destined to be a family tradition.

Wonderful alternative to the jarred stuff -- and really not difficult to prepare. Cooking time for mine was exactly as indicated, 1 hour. A friend who also made the recipe found that hers needed a much longer cooking time (2 hours). I'm wondering whether the weight of the bundt pan makes the difference. I have a dark, rather inexpensive, light weight pan; hers, while dark, is a much heavier weight calphalon. The fish was a big hit; people oohed and ahhed at last night's seder -- and as others have reported, even non-gefilte fish enthusiasts were impressed. My only suggestion: perhaps a bit more lemon and dill could be added to "brighten" the flavor even more.

Being of the mindset that, nothing good can come from fish in a jar, I decided to give this recipe a try. This is a truly fabulous way to add flare to the passover spread. Several non jews at the seder said that they would try it. And they liked it. It is very easy to make. You will never eat the slimy stuff in a jar again.

I prepared this dish on Sunday and served it at last night's Seder. What a hit! Even three gefilte fish phobics agreed to a taste test. One of the three was delighted and the other two had a couple of bites which I consider progress. I have a convection oven and found the baking time had to be increased by 30 minutes. (first hour covered, next 30 minutes uncovered). I use a teflon bundt pan. The rest of the recipe was perfect. This dish serves 20-25 people. And, presentation, WOW! Bringing the uncut, dill garnished fish to the table silenced everyone. Almost like a birthday cake. Happy Passover and enjoy. PS. I will make this for other occasions. YUM.

I have to take this opportunity to put in a plug for the salmon gefilte fish which, like this recipe, is in the NYT Passover cookbook. It is absolutely phenomenal. Even people who run from the room at the thought of eating gefilte fish thought the salmon gefilte fish was yummy. The gefilte fish ring recipe is one of many alternative gefilte fish recipes in the NYT cookbook and based on the immense success enjoyed by the salmon gefilte fish, which seems somewhat similar, I am going to have to try it. A bonus to appealing to the non-gefilte fish eater: the cook does not have to make an alternate cold appetizer! Happy Passover!

I made this for the holidays and everyone said that it is the best gefilte fish they ever ate - very moist and fresh tasting. I figure it's also a New England version of gefilte fish, since halibut and salmon are more abundant here than the traditional fresh water fish. I reduced the pepper to 1 teaspoon and omitted the dill. I ground the fish in the meat grinder attachment of my Kitchen Aid mixer. I baked it for one hour covered then 1/2 hour uncovered. It froze nicely. Thank you!

This is simply delicious! Make sure that your fish is pristinely fresh, follow the directions exactly, and don't wait for a holiday to make it. This makes a wonderful first course in any season, or a lovely lunch (on a bed of baby greens) in the summer. It looks as appealing as it tastes!

I made this on Tuesday nite before Passover. It was easy to make and everyone raved about it (and had seconds). I precooked the onions and cooked it in my convection oven for 1h 45m (although I think it could have used a little less time). I found the horseradish too overpowering for the delicate flavor of the fish, so I mixed homemade mayo and added pink prepared horseradish to taste, and added some chopped fresh dill to the sauce. (I bet yogurt or sour cream would be equally delicious for a dairy meal). It was delicious! This one is definitely going to be on my menu from now on.

$40 worth of fish is what went down the garbage disposal. The baking time is really off. Once it was obvious that the terrine was not anywhere near set after the recommended cooking time, it was a complete guess as to how much longer to bake it and if it was set around the center. Also, just how big is a medium spanish onion? I would have preferred a cup measurement to be given. I followed the recipe exactly. My oven was calibrated. The terrine looked beautiful, but had a very bland taste and unpleasant texture. Fortunately I decided to try some several hours before serving it to 18 people. I ended up running to the store and buying $40 worth of top quality smoked salmon. I served a few slices toeach person with a baby greens salad, capers and lemon. My guest just loved it, the presentatiuon was lovely, and the preparation a snap. The terrine was an expensive flop!

Definitely use white or yellow onions. Red onions become an unpleasant gray when cooked. I made half of the recipe and cooked it for an hour and 15 minutes. Much better than "traditional" gefilte fish.

I am the "Cook from New Jersey" with an update on this FABULOUS dish. This is my third year using this recipe.Everyone raved about it and people who enjoyed it in previous years said they were looking forward to the meal because of this dish. I shared it with many of my friends and their guests also agreed that it was FABULOUS. I have some suggestions for the recipe, though. 1)I think the onions should be cooked first, so they can cool before adding to the fish mixture. Make sure they are white spanish onions. 2)The fish man needs to be very careful about the pin bones in the fish. Encourage him/her to be careful. 3)Also, it took longer than an hour to cook the terrine. I used the precise bundt pan and tested my oven for temperature. I also used the water bath. It really has to be firm before it can be removed. 4)I would also suggest removing it from the terrine, if you plan to cook it the night before, but then putting it back to store for the next day. Cover with foil, etc. But it is too hard to wrap it tightly if it is removed from the mold the night before. It is very expensive. It cost be about $40 for the fish for the full recipe. But it is worth it. I look forward to making it every year. It is a wonderful treat. But these suggestions should improve the dish even more.
