I thought this was great! I don't know why all the negative reviews...I tweaked mine quite a bit, though...I added one minced jalapeno, one minced clove of garlic, 2 extra tablespoons of sugar [even though I normally don't like really sweet things],1 teaspoon of ground coriander and a dash of hot pepper flakes. I love it! And it's important to peel the cucumber as it's a bitter flavor.

It's unique, that's for sure, and as mentioned quick and easy. My radishes were very small, so the high skin/flesh ratio turned it very pink, and fairly sharp. A sort of a foamy/crunchy texture but without any large chunks, difficult to describe. If I have another glut of radishes, I might make it again.

I'm not a general fan of radishes, but this was delicious and refreshing. However, it doesn't keep very well, so it is probably best to eat it on the day it is made!

My husband gagged and I thought is was okay if you like liquid radishes. Somethings should remain crunchy. The color was pretty and that's the best I can say about it.

This soup shaped up pink and foamy, which made a pretty presentation, especially with a few paper-thin slices of radish and cucumber floating on top as shown in the recipe photo. The soup is refreshing and..radishy. It's odd in that sense - radish is a taste that one doesn't crave. Nonetheless, my guests, a picky couple, ate every last drop, and complemented this soup as a starter on a hot night.

Good hot weather starter. I followed the recipe except I added 4 oz. of sour cream at the end. I think it rounded out the flavor nicely.

Cool, refreshing, pretty, and subtly tasty. Texture was foamy rather than creamy, so I wondered if I had blended it too long; I don't think so, though, because the picture in the magazine looked just like the soup I made. It is now about an hour since I made the recipe, and I see that the uneaten soup in the blender retains the foamy texture. So that is the nature of the dish, and I expect that it will have the same quality when I eat the last of it for lunch tomorrow. I'll let you know if it doesn't turn out that way. Isn't it true that foam is all the rage among top chefs? This soup was great as a quick, low-calorie first course that took the edge off after-work hunger. Then it was easy to wait while I prepared the main course. Actually, I think 2.5 forks is the proper rating. I rounded up to 3 because it is so quick and also handy because it can be made with ingredients that are not too perishable. I didn't use the seedless cucumber---just removed the seeds from an ordinary cucumber---and didn't have seasoned rice vinegar, so I used unseasoned rice vinegar. I thought the soup was better when garnished with radish slices alone rather than with radish and cucumber slices. Radish is slightly peppery; cucumber is slightly bitter.

A very refreshing summer soup with nice flavor. Texture was somewhat grainy. Not sure if this was due to the variety of radish I used or if result would be the same using any type of radish.

I followed the recipe exactly and loved it. At our house we thought it was so fantastic and easy as well as refreshing, that I'm about to fix it for the third time in a week.

1 would have given this an even lower score were it possible - simply gross!
