These shortcakes are superb! I have made them several times and everyone always raves about them. I, too, have had the problem with the cakes spreading out as they bake. Surely, there must be some professional chefs out there who can tweak this recipe so that the dough will have more body to rise up while it bakes rather than spread out!

These biscuits are fabulous - rich and almondy and good by themselves. I took the advice and didn't flatten them, and they were about an inch and a half high. They can be made the day before, by the way, even though the recipe says up to 8 hours.

Got rave reviews on these shortcakes when I made for a dinner party last night. I followed others' recommendations and did not press on the dough at all prior to baking. You could already see the dough spreading before even applying the almond mixture. I didn't have the currant spread on hand, so I just used a ton of mixed berries with sugar in their own syup. Really delicious! Don't make more than the recommended time ahead.

great taste but they turned out like hockey pucks.

Wonderful shortbread. I added more lemon zest the second time around and liked it even better

I made this twice, both times is has been a big hit with requests for the recipe. The second time, I made fingers instead of the round biscuits (used half of the dough recipe). I put the fruit in a bowl topped with cream then a slice of kiwi and placed a half of a biscuit finger on the side.

Absolutely wonderful tasting. I made for my gourmet dinner group guests and everybody loved it! I will definately keep making this recipe until berries go out of season and then I will make the shortcakes as a scone by itself.

This is a fabulous summer dessert; I served it to two different sets of guests and both exclaimed over how beautiful it looks and how wonderful it tastes. The only thing I would change is to somehow get the shortcakes not to spread into the size of large cookies, but to keep them taller so they are easier to cut horizontally. An easy dessert to get ready in advance, assemble at serving time, and dazzle the guests with!

I was looking for a dessert with lots of fruit for my boys - they loved this, I love it, my husband loves it. The compote by itself is good. I'm going to be serving this at every event I can for a long time!

I also made this recipe from the magazine and thought it said to use a whole tube of almond paste. It was still great!

I've made these at least three times since the recipe was published. I love this recipe because it comes together so quickly. Good high altitude recipe... just make sure that you don't press the shortbread balls down too much before baking or they will spread too much. I've used frozen/thawed berries with super results and I've enriched the whipped cream with creme anglaise to make the dessert richer. My family and friends just can't get enough of these.

Very tasty. I used 7 oz of almond paste, and just blackberries with black currant preserve. Very good.

These were heavenly! Easy to make and delicious to eat. Also makes an impressive looking dessert. I think I used an ounce more almond paste than the recipe called for because the size I purchased was 8 oz. rather than 7oz. This may have made the cakes spread out a bit more when cooking. I did not think they were thick enough to slice in half, so I mounded the berries and cream on top. I used a mix of strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries to which I added some strawberry-fig preserves made by a relative. Divine!! Actually .... looking back at the recipe, I notice that it called for 1/2 of a 7 oz roll of almond paste. This means I more than doubled the amount of almond paste called for! (I'll have to recheck the recipe as printed in the magazine.) No wonder the almond flavor was so intense. When I make this again, I'll probably do the same. These shortcakes were just as good on their own as with the berries and cream.

This is a wonderful special occasion recipe. It's delicious, and looks just like the picture on the magazine cover.

I made this dessert for a family get together so I needed to double it. (It was almost too much for the food processor to hold but it made it in.) It received rave reviews from all. I will certainly make it again.
