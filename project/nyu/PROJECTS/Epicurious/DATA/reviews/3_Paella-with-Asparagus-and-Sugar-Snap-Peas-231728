Paella with asparagus and sugar snap peas was a delicious summer delight!! I highly recommend altering a few simple ingredients to enhance/improve the recipe's outcome: 1.) Add 3/4 c. extra broth when cooking the rice 2.) add 1/2 lb of cubed halibut, cook with the rest of the seafood as directed by the original recipe instead of mussels 3.) Roast your own red peppers (not from jar) 4.) We didn't have spicy paprika, so we substituted 1 tsp. sweet paprika, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp red chili flakes 5.) Our clams did not open in the paella, can be steamed in white wine separately and added at the end 6.) We couldn't stomach the "mystery" ingredients in chorizo, so for a healthier alternative, add 4 chicken sausages, sliced **This modified recipe makes about 8-10 servings because of added fish--it was great!! We will definitely make it again, a very impressive dish

I agree with previous reviewers- this one is just not worth all the work. Furthermore it takes way longer than 20minutes in the oven to get the clams cooked- by which time the shrimps and mussels have all become shriveled and overcooked. I followed the direction of previous reviewers,adding extra water and cooking the rice for about 15 minutes before putting it all in the oven. In the end the rice was overcooked and soggy. I think perhaps this dish would have worked better cooking it as a risotto on the stove top, adding the clams first then the mussels then the shrimps. All in all, the recipe directions are not good and too much improvisation is needed. Unless you are an expert chef and know how to compensate for the recipe's flaws, don't try it.

I made this as a late summer dish after mountain biking and it was wonderful. The zip from the spices and the crunch from the peas and asparagus made it much more interesting than the usual paella. It is imperative to add more broth and water about 2- 1/2 additional cups), and cook on the stove top until the rice is al dente. Also, there must be enough really hot liquid to ensure the mussels and clams open. I substituted 1 1/2 tsp hot Mexican chili powder and 1 1/2 tsp smoked Hungarian paprika since I couldn't find the hot paprika. I also substituted canned Mexican chiles. Definitely a winner.

Hi! I made this dish with the intentions of quick and easy preparation in mind, and boy was I in for a big surprise! Not only was the rice crunchy, but I had to cook it on the stove! What's up with that? I rated it two forks because it had potential. I suggest you get a paella dish. Take it from me. I learned the "hard way". You might want to have a backup dish, in case this "crunchy" dish fails. Take my advice. After all, I am crunchyrice22.

I used whitefish sausage in place of the chorizo and fish stock for my pescetarian friends. Green beans work just as well as snap peas, so do oven raosted tomatoes in place of the piquillos

This was good but not great enough for the long time it takes to prepare. I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and added chicken and also cooked the rice much longer on the stove than the recipe said. It never got syrupy (like the one reviewer mentioned) so after appx 10 min I put the lid on the pan and cooked an additional 15 min to soften the rice. Then added the veggies and seafood and stuck it in the oven for 20 min. Cooked beautifully this way. I'm sure this would be good for a party - makes a ton of food....

This was very flavorable and delicious. However, you need to cook the broth and rice mixture on top of the stove for about 15 minutes or until mixture is syrupy. Then you add the seafood and vegetables and place in the oven. Check in 10 min. and turn over seafood--cook for 5 min. more and dish is ready. I did not have the right kind of pepper, so used red pepper from Esplette--fantastic! Also, do not precook the asparagas.

It just was not that great of a flavor combination, also the way the recipe was written was poor and unclear in many instances.

This actually could've tasted wonderful and I'd definitely make it again, but I've given it 2 forks because I'm really mad about how long it took the rice to cook. It took much longer than the 15 minutes prescribed in the recipe. I had it in the oven for an hour and 20 minutes and even at that the rice was still a little crunchy!!! I just couldn't wait any longer. My poor guests had to nibble on Gran Queso cheese and Spanish olives for a painfully long time. Good thing they were nice about it. I guess I could've done something wrong, but other than possibly not simmering the rice for a full 2 minutes before baking, which couldn't account for an extra hour of oven time, I'm not sure what. ? I'm surprised none of the other reviewers mentioned it. My husband really liked the flavours, though, so next time, I'll just account for the time.

I made this for a dinner party and it was excellent! (At the recommendation of a seasoned paella chef) I substituted lobster stock for the chicken / shrimp stock, and I also added some chicken (cooked in the pot just before the chorizo), swordfish chunks & squid (both added at the same time as the shrimp). Next time I will slightly increase the chorizo. The hungarian paprika gives this dish a nice kick. I doubled the recipe and it took a bit longer to complete, but excellent none the less - this recipe is a winner.

Excellent! Try adding calamari (sliced tubes and even some of the legs, if you like) when you add the shrimp, clams and mussels to the dish. It's very good. I also included one red bell pepper (about a quarter- or half-inch chop) when I added the garlic to the onion saute. I would do it again, maybe even add a yellow pepper as well. The sausage was so good, my family asked me to add more next time. The snap peas and asparagus are outstanding in this dish.

I made this recipe on New Year's Eve with my best friend. We substituted a bit: we omitted the mussels and doubled the sausage, and used arborio rice instead of spanish rice. We loved it! The flavors were perfectly balanced. This recipe makes a TON of paella. Invest in a paella pan if you don't have one.

This was fab celebration fare, and we prepped almost all the parts of it the night before our party (made broth/infused wine, did onion mixture but didn't add rice, prepared veg). We were able to walk in from a long morning event, warm everything to room temp before proceeding with the recipe, and it came together beautifully. I think the recipe would be great as is, although we did add some (pre-cooked) chicken legs & thighs for the less-adventurous. (One and a half recipes plus 10 chicken pieces served 12 comfortably.) We found the hot Hungarian paprika pretty hot compared to plain paprika (go figure) - but a nice flavor! My Jamaican mother-in-law was surprised this wasn't a Caribbean dish...

Thought this was easy and delicious. I added chicken breasts and deleted the mussels. I bought the chorizo at a spanish market and it was quite spicy, but really added to the dish. Prepped everything in the afternoon, put it together and in the oven when guests arrived.

I made this dish for Easter and we all loved it. I actually made two versions, one with seafood and chicken and omitted the meat. Although a bit time consuming in preparation, I would definitely make it again...the results are well worth it.
