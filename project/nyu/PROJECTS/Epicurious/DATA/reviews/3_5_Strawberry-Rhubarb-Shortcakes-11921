I used lemon instead of orange because it was what I had on hand and it was delicious. Impressed a foodie friend.

I would NEVER make this again. the dough smelled good, but it turned out terrible. yucky. Absolutely awful. I can't tell you ho terrible this is.

I have made this numerous times, varying the berry and fruit filling, and often just using plain whipped cream. The use of cardamom and zest is complementary to many fruits, and almost "wakes up" the shortcake in a way that everyone who eats them seems to appreciate. The texture of the shortcake is also tender and nice. I really like the idea of wedges because you get individual shortcakes, which is a little fancy, but at the same time there's no fussy cookie or biscuit cutter type procedure with rerolling of scraps, etc. to go through.

Everyone loved this and I especially enjoyed the cardamom and orange flavors together. I did not have orange-flower water and just added some orange zest and it was fine. I wish I would have cut the rhubarb larger or cooked it less, since it rather fell apart in the final presentation.

This was delicious. I used a slightly different shortcake recipe to avoid the shortening, but highly recommend to keep the cardamom from this recipe as it really makes the dish.

I usually i do a lattice top rhubarb pie for easter, but this year I decided to try this. I served it for Easter dessert for 8 people- as the recipe said, omitting only the orange zest since I'm not a fan. Everyone loved it. I had no leftovers and made it again the next week. Very easy to make, and everyone remarked about the flavors of cardemon in the biscuits.Even people who claimed they were too full finished their portion, and several wanted the recipe. the biscuits are somewhat dry but they are softened by the strawberry rhubarb topping. i used ice cream on top.

Wonderful recipe. Easy and quick to make. I did leave out the cardamom. Shortcake turned out perfect - not dense at all. For those who had problems with this maybe you're handling the dough too much. I used the food processor for all the shortcake dry ingredients. Makes it easier than trying to cut in the butter.

I like dense shortcake and this was just the ticket! I'd never used cardamom before so I was conservative and only used 3/4 tsp and I love the flavour. The rhubarb-strawberry mixture was not too sweet, just the way I like it! great recipe!

I liked the flavour of the cardamom in the shortcake but not the actual shortcake. My attempt at the recipe turned out dense and heavy. Another time I would add the cardamom to my old reliable biscuit recipe. The rhubarb/strawberry combination was very tasty.

The shortcakes are great! I cooked them at lower heat (400 degrees) for 13 minutes, and they turned out perfect. I know my oven temperature (I keep a thermometer on the shelf that I am baking on) and have always found 425 a little too high for shortcakes. I didn't make the rhubarb (didn't have any), but added some blood orange juice and zest to the strawberries. Served with a little creme fraiche. Delicious!

This was delicious!! I made it with just strawberries and loved the combination of flavours. The shortcake is well worth making and freezes well.

Delicious! We ate the whole thing before the kids came down for dessert and boy, were they livid! The shortcake was spectacular; I made one big shortcake and cut it at the table. Next time I'll double the recipe!

Made this exactly as directed and it was wonderful. The orange and cardamom really enhances the dish. My husband definitely wants me to make it again. Great make-ahead recipe for a summer party.

As one of my friends said today, "This was the best shortcake I've ever had!". I just served it with sweetened strawberries, but the shortcake itself was fantastic. I was out of milk and vanilla so substituted orange juice and maple syrup, respectively, and it tasted great-light, flaky, orange. Would be great as biscuits with butter and marmalade, too.

I only used the shortcake part of the recipe, and omitted the orange zest. It was an incredible texture and the cardamom was a very smart addition.

Rich and delicious. Shortcakes are very unusual with cardamom/orange combo. I made the filling and shortcakes the night before - so only had to whip the cream before serving.

I decided I would try this based on the Strawberry Rhubarb topping, but the shortbread truely suprised me! I have made this repeatedly, using only strawberries when I can't find rhubarb. Highly recommend!

This recipe is light and fruity. I used lemon zest in the shortcake, and doubled the amount. This was a big hit at dinner with lightly sweetened whipped cream.

The combination of orange zest and cardamom in the shortcakes made this recipe excellent. I skipped the rhubarb, and used only strawberries. Also, brushing the shortcakes with milk and adding sugar on top adds an extra bit of sweetness. I would definitely make it again

The shortcake part of this recipe is spectacular. The cardamon flavor with the strawberries is a wild combination. I'll make this every year.

This was a delightful dessert. The strawberries were not really cooked, and were complemented nicely by the rhubarb. The topping is also good over ice cream.
