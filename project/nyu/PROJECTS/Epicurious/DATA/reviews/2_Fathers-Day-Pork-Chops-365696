What's with the red wine vinegar? The recipe would have been okay if it wasn't for the rwv. That's all you could taste. MY suggestion would be to eliminate the rwv.

Not awful and not good either. I did to recipe and i guess just to many flavors but still bland if that makes sense. the Thyme was just to much and with the RWV and lemon it became to comfusing. I wont be making this again.

I'm not sure if I did something drastically different, but these were so yummy! I did use apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar because I didn't have enough RWV. It was great because it had a mellow apple flavor that reminded me pork chops and applesauce. I also subbed in italian parsely for the other herbs and bought pork chops that were bone in but only about 3/4 inch in thickness (didn't pound them thin). Served with roasted brussel sprouts and they were so good that my husband ate a second and took the leftovers for lunch today.

awful. I followed the recipe as written and the vinegar was way too strong. The pork tasted sour. Not a good flavor for meat. Will not be making again.

These were some of the best pork chops I have made. The vinegar gave them a tangy flavor, they were moist and tender, and the crust crunched with each bite. I did not use as much oil as the recipe called for. But theses were a quick easy dinner.
