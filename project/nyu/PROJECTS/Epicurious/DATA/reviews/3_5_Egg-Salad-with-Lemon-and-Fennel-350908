I really liked this but I tweaked mine a bit based on personal preference. I amended the mayo to about 1/4 cup, did about a teaspoon of the lemon juice, and substituted fennel with green onions because they were cheaper and I like the faint spice. I also added chile powder and pepper plus salt to taste, and the consistency was absolutely perfect - not the least bit runny but perfectly clingy as far as not falling apart goes. One should also note that it only makes about 3 sandwich-sized servings - if you're looking for a good amount, double your ingredients.

It was good - but not great.. somehow the lemon was too strong with fennel and egg. I do love lemon usually . Not something I would do again..

I enjoyed this egg salad, but it wasn't an office favorite.

Delicious! Great on the latkes OR on a big piece of challah! I loved the kick the lemon provided and the crunch from the fennel. Very tasty recipe for any time of the year.

Taste was amazing, though the kids at my table didn't love it (fennel is not a kid-favorite). It was definitely "saucy" so next time I'll add more egg. I also cut the fennel, using only about 1/2 cup.

This is the best egg salad I have ever tasted! The fennel adds the perfect crunch without the often overpowering raw onion aftertaste. I can see how some might find it a little runny- but I didn't mind. If you think that might bother you just throw in another egg or two.

This is an incredibly tasty version of egg salad that everyone enjoys. I ease up on the mayo and it still has all the flavors and crunch.

Yum! This was a breeze! I will certainly make this one again!

Unlike the other reviewers, I like this exactly as written. The extra "sauce" and lemon get absorbed by the eggs when the salad refrigerates. BTW, the recipe says 1/2 bulb of fennel = 1 cup but for me 1/4 bulb of fennel measured as 1 cup.

I think that this is a good recipe, although I think that the lemon is a bit tart. So next time when I make it, ill cut back a smidgen on the lemon juice and mayo.

The fennel is nice and crunchy, the taste is wonderful. It is very saucy so you might cut down the sauce ingredients if you fear that sort of thing. I ate this with crackers and it was delish.
