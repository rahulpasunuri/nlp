Just not that great and a bit on the too spicy side for me. I won't make again, but if I had to, I would use a more exciting green than watercress.

If you just ignore the errors in the title of this recipe (no portobellos, sweet red pepper sauce,or arugula in the ingredients list), you'll enjoy a light, refreshing salad that's fairly quick and easy to put together. The spiciness of the serrano pepper in contrast with the sweetness of the mango, with the asian flavor of the chicken, is a most interesting and tasty combination. I did use arugula for the greens, because I had some, but I think watercress would work as well. My husband and I both loved it, so it's earned a place in my favortite salad recipe file. I can't imagine portobello mushrooms in this salad; it just wouldn't work. But I will add some chopped red bell pepper to the mango mixture next time, for a little added crunchiness. Let's call it Asian Chicken Mango Salad and forgive Epicurious for an occasional error.

Actually, I'm wondering if the title is correct as neither portobello mushrooms, nor a sweet red bell pepper sauce recipe are included in the text. So far, it sounds good.
