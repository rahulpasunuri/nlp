This dip is exceptional given the ease of preparation. The consistency wasnt as thick as I would have liked, but I probably didnt drain the peppers well enough. I used roasted garlic (3 large cloves) just because I prefer it to raw garlic.

Easy and amazing! I've made this several times now and everyone always loves it. Tastes great with snow peas!

Great recipe! I made it with low fat Hellmans mayo and the consistency was fine. I ground up pepper flakes, and I probably would use 1/2 the amount (used full 1/4 tsp) as it was a little too spicy for some. But delicious!

Great! I put shrimp, blanched zucchini and cooked carrot discs on skewers. Delicious, easy to eat and so pretty.

I've been using this recipe for five years now, always to rave reviews. I roast my own peppers, just because I don't like the canned ones, and have even made it with soft tofu and lemon juice instead of mayonnaise with excellent results. We use this for more than just veggie dip too, and have even thinned it out just a little bit and used it as salad dressing or made it thicker and used it for crackers and bread. Delicious no matter how you play with it and makes a very unusual picnic dip if you use the tofu instead of the mayo.

This is one of my go-to recipes: easy to make, tasty, and always well-received. I like blanched green beans, zucchini strips and boiled fingerling potatoes with it. Delish!

Runny. If I did it again I'd not only drain the peppers, but I'd pat them dry. Bland. Had to had more garlic, and tons more cayenne.

So easy and yet very impressive. We all love it and get complimented everytime we bring it with us to a party!

Very good, very garlicky, which is always a good thing. Also very colorful!

Great summer time dip - nice kick to it and very pretty presentation!

This was excellent! We ran out of vegetables to dip into it, so had to use bread or whatever else we could find so we could finish it up!

This was a wonderful dip! It started out as a veggie dip but people at the party liked it so much they were trying it on everything. It's easy and fast, even using fresh roasted peppers instead of the ones from the jar. It now has a permanent spot in my recipe box.

A big hit and so easy. Some guests were dieting so I used low fat mayo and a touch more garlic than the recipe called for. I served it with veggies and bread sticks. It was terrific. Definitely a permanent addition to my party menus.

A perfect start to a rich French meal. I par-boiled the carrot sticks and blanched the peppers. The results were very well-received.

I agree with the other reviews - this is spicey, delicious, different, but not at all weird and a breeze to make. It is good with snow peas as well. My guests loved it and so did my 12 year old!

I made this dip for a wine tasting where I work, and it was a hit! I used Balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar; it really gave it a great flavor!! I served it with red pepper strips, carrot chunks and yellow squash rounds with Bruschetta on the side...most of the guests asked for the recipe. I'm making it again for a catering....love it!

I was surprised by how much everyone liked this dip. It's a nice change from the ubiquitous ranch dip. It's especially good with asapragus.

Super easy and very tasty. Far more interesting that the last minute lipton french onion dip that it replaces. Guests will be intrigued and impressed, but it only takes half a minute to prepare. Also, for non-cooks, you cannot mess this dish up.

Wonderful flavor and very simple to prep. I felt one large garlic clove was potent enough though, and I love garlic!
