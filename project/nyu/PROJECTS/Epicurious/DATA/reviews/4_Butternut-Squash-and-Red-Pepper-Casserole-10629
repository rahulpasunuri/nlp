Made this a couple of times. The first time really enjoyed it. Made it again, and thought,"Meh." I like the simplicity of it, but wasn't wild about the Parmesan.

Wonderful, and the leftovers were even better. I added a can of black beans to turn it into a main dish and served with brown rice. Followed others' suggestions to reduce oil and added feta. I assembled the casserole (except cheese) the day before, then topped with cheeses and baked after work. Very yummy, hearty, and satisfying. Will definitely be making this again.

I always think the people who don't give a good review to a recipe that everyone else clearly loves are such downers - but I have to be honest and say I don't understand what all the hype is about. I found it to be pretty bland, and would definitely not make it again. I made the recipe as is without changes. Right now I am in the middle of trying to turn the leftovers (just about a FULL baking dish) into butternut squash soup. Maybe I'll have better luck there.

This is aaaamazing! My boyfriend is Italian and we're both cheese snobs, so I doubled the amount of cheese and used pecorino romano from Whole Foods, and WOW I think it made the dish.

Rating: 4
This recipe is quick and delicious! I doubled the red pepper. I really enjoy the balance of the sweetness of the squash and savory of the pepper and prefer the ratio to be around 60 squash/40 red pepper. I also agree with previous notes- cut the oil in half. The dish is simple, but sophisticated in taste. My new fall favorite!

I have loved this recipe since it first came out. I agree with the other reviewers who say 1.5 T of oil is plenty. I love having the leftovers for lunch it tastes even better reheated.

Just made this for Thanksgining. Nice combination of flavors. I think this will be how I will prepare butternut squash from now on.

I've been making this recipe since it first appeared in Gourmet. I make it more or less exactly as written- my only change is to use a slightly larger 3.5qt baking dish. A thinner layer of squash/pepper in the dish allows for more carmelization and intensifies the sweetness of the squash considerably...which enhances the peppers & rosemary too. This recipe is what started me eating squash all those years ago. No one I've ever made it for hasn't loved it too.

Rating: 4
This tasted way more luxurious than I expected based on the effort that went into it. I cut back on the oil a bit and would go with even less next time (maybe 1.5 T). Also, I used what I had on hand for reasonable substitutions: 3 tsp of dried parsley, and scant tsp of tarragon instead of rosemary. The tarragon was great and I'll use it again sometime. Also, I used the "grated parmesan" from a green can instead of the fresh. As good as this dish was, I can't WAIT to try it with the fresher ingredients. I made this last night and I'm making it again tomorrow, and I already have a list of dates for which my SO has requested this. Huge hit. Make this.

The butternut squash turned out mushy, maybe because I used frozen/thawed???

Superb recipe. I cut corners, so I chopped the squash into 1" chunks and mixed with a little less olive oil, covered the baking dish and microwaved it for about 7 minutes. During that time, I mixed the fresh garlic and dried parsley with about three red peppers from a jar and a tsp of kosher salt. Removing the squash from the microwave, I mixed the spices with the squash, mixed in about 2" of goat cheese from a roll, added two chicken breasts cut into strips and sprinkled 1 cup of parmesan reggiano on the top. I baked this in a 400 degree oven for about 30 minutes. WOW!

I am mildly obsessed with squash at the moment and have discovered that peeling the squash with a vegetable peeler makes the job much easier.

Have been enjoying this recipe for years. I think I literally dream of diving into it again! I use the widest pan I can find to have more surface area on top to be caramelized. Also I use more cheese than is called for - this is another advantage of the lower, wider pan - every piece gets its fair share of cheese.

This was ok. I threw in 2 bangers(sausages)to the baking pan when it had been cooking for about 30 min and they were great. Hubby doesnt love butternut so nothing was going to sway him....

This dish was tastier than I expected. I REALLY enjoyed it. I followed the recipe, but used dried spices (that's all I had) and added beets and mushrooms for some extra flavor. This dish works as a main course, but I paired it with gorgonzola/walnut polenta. PERFECT!!! Will definitely make again!

Rating: 4
I made this as the vegetarian main course (and side dish for others) for a New Year's Eve dinner for friends last night. Sadly, no Trader Joe's here, so I struggled with a whole squash. I greatly appreciated the cutting advice from "Personal Chef." Also, using the always-helpful suggestions here made it as follows: I used 2 red peppers, the whole 3T of oil (not too oily), 3 cloves of garlic, pressed, and I baked it uncovered for an hour before I added the parmesan cheese. Topped with cheese and baked another 1/2 hour. It received rave reviews from all guests, including the college-age girls. Simply fabulous.

Rating: 4
I made this about five years ago, and never reviewed it. What a colorful and flavorful dish. I'm making this again for a client for Thanksgiving. You can cut down on the oil, as I do. Definitely a keeper here, and you don't have to wait until fall to enjoy. Trader Joe's has prepared, cubed butternut all year long in one pound bags. I halve the whole butternut squash lengthwise and then peel both halves. After you scrape out the seeds, then you can dice. Much easier that way with far less waste.

Rating: 3
Mmmmn...makes great leftovers (if you have any!). I added goat cheese in the last 10 minutes or so of cooking as others have suggested - I like the extra tang. Otherwise, it's a great, relatively simple recipe! The squash's flavor really shines through in this and it gets really nice & soft by roasting it.

Rating: 4
A wonderful dish with great flavor. I used romano instead of parmesan, also used a small 9x9 glass dish. Will make again, but in a larger pan and using a little bit more cheese. The best parts of this dish are the carmelized bits on the very top!

Delicious! Will definitely make again. Caution to other cooks: keep an eye on the dish if you use the butternut squash that is pre-peeled and pre-cut since pieces may be smaller than the 1" cube recommended. Smaller pieces - less cooking time.

This dish is amazing! The fresh herbs and garlic really make this dish. I served it as a main dish, as I'm a vegetarian. It was fine as a main dish. I substituted half pecorino romano for the cheese and used all 3 tablespoons of olive oil. The oil really helps to get a nice crust on the squash. I didn't find it oily at all.

Yummy recipe--good fall/early winter dish. Can be a little sweet, depending on the ripeness of the squash and pepper, but still great! I imagine this would be a great way to get little kids to eat their veggies, since it is so sweet and it's got that cheese in it. But definitely wonderful for adults, too!

Funny to find this recipe because my husband and I have been using roasted butternut as a staple of almost every dinner party we do - either with a casual sit down meal of roasted chicken or as an accompanyment to bbq'd meat. And of course, we have it with our own dinners at least once a week. We keep it very simple - in a pyrex add butternut, whole sprigs of rosemary, whole cloves of garlic, salt and pepper, and a little olive oil to lightly coat. Toss it all together and bake for 45 minutes. Sometimes we add red peppers or red onions - cannot imagine the need to add cheese of any sort or breadcrumbs - the vegetables are spectacular on their own! As a sidenote: although I like it w/o the peel, my husband prefers it roasted with the skin on as it is completely eddible and if cooked long enough is tender and lovely. Also, friends of ours add dried chilli flakes to give the butternut a kick.

I finally got around to doing this casserole. EXCELLENT. I have made it twice. Once I cooked it in a glass dish at lower temp than called for, and once I baked in aluminum pan with temp at suggested 400. Never again. WAY too hot. Done in 30 min, and almost burned. Because butternut squash is such a pain to peel, etc, bought cubes at Trader Joe's. Great....but expensive. But if you only need 3 cups of squash or so, buying it cut up and peeled is the way to go.

Rating: 4
I never really enjoyed squash untill I had it prepared this way. Very easy. Great for company because you can make it ahead of time and put in oven 45 minutes before serving. I used 1/2 red pepper and 1/2 green pepper for extra colour. Be carefull not to burn - I found 1 hour to long in the oven.

I have been making this recipe for 2 years now. It is always a big hit at all the dinner parties. Even people that don't like butternut squash eat this dish up. I do leave out the red pepper since my husband is not a big fan of it. I also add more cheese than the recipe calls for.....

Rating: 1
Although we love squash, I think the red pepper overpowered it. I don't like rosemary on ANYTHING, so I omitted it. I added a little carmelized butter and less oil. The fresh Parmesan cheese made it a little chewy on top, instead of glazy, and creamy which I would have preferred. I would add some carmelized onions with a little butter and olive oil if I decided to make it again, which is doubtful.

This was fabulous. A dinner guests who dislikes squash took a taste to be polite and then polished it off. Reducing oil is a must. I used 2T and it was still a bit "oily". Next time I'll use my olive oil mister to get as light of a coating as possible. Also, a humorous aside. I used a veggie peeler to peel the squash. It worked great, except I had a bright orange hand when I was done. After ten minutes of scrubbing with a surgeons handbrush and an exfoliating scrub I STILL had an orange hand. It bothered me because I thought it might give the impression to my dinner guests that my hands were not clean as I handled their food. So I broke out the Soft Scrub with bleach and finally got it off. I plan to make this again soon, but I'll wear gloves this time :-)

We like this recipe for several reasons: it can be made ahead, the color is wonderful, and the taste is interestingly different! I have made it several times and have successfully taken the suggestion of the bread crumbs which I mix with the Parmesan cheese and add halfway through the time in the oven! Thanks, Epicurious and reviewers!

Rating: 4
I made this on a whim for something different to bring to a potluck. Everyone loved it! Even people who think they don't like squash love it. I think it's because it's an unexpected savory take on this traditionally sweetened-up vegetable. I added balsamic vinegar as a previous reviewer suggested, and also threw some Italian bread crumbs on top before baking. Gives it a nice browned, "crusty" look out of the oven. Fresh herbs are a must.

Everyone who eats it loves this dish. I found it a little greasy and cheezy at first, but I've made it several times and have perfected it to my liking. I use about half the oil and just sprinkle some shredded parmesan cheese on top.

This dish has become a staple in our house since I first tried it about two years ago. It is so easy and so incredibly delicious. Serves two as a main course, if you are really hungry. And the leftovers (if you have any) reheat well the next day. It's so good sometimes we have it once a week in the fall and winter. I think the butternut squash peels pretty easily with a carrot peeler.

This recipe is absolutely delicious -- such a simple summer sidedish. One tip I might share: peeling butternut squash is often difficult. Try microwaving the two-inch slices for twenty seconds to soften the tough skin, making it easier to remove.

Wow! We really loved this recipe. I took the advice of another reviewer and used goat cheese instead of the parmesan the first time. Used a combination of the two cheeses this last time and it was fabulous. We served it aside grilled leg of lamb for Easter Dinner. It was a hit. If you like butternut squash, also try the recipe for Braised Meat with Butternut Squash on this same site. We make that at least twice per month, it's so good.

The flavors in this recipe were very good but when I make it again, I will use less olive oil and a litle breadcrumb. I would also use a softer cheese like asiago or fontina.

This is a FANTASTIC recipe though it doesn't sound that thrilling--even my rather demanding family LOVED it. Something about baking the squash brings out even more flavor than my usual microwaving technique (which i will toss out the window following the flavor of this gem!). I had leftovers and added some to a rather tasteless caulifower soup i was making and it improved it's flavor greatly. Can't wait to serve it to company.

This dish has a nice presentation and is pretty easy to make. I used banana squash and it worked just fine. The only thing I didn't like as much was that I thought the parmesean didn't work that well. I'd probably use a softer cheese, like a goat cheese, and sprinkle it at the end.

This was a great way to cook butternut squash! It worked well as a low-fat dish;reducing the amount of oil, using 1/4 cup low-fat parmesan cheese, and 1/4 cup bread crumbs. I will definitely make this again! It can almost be a main vegetarian dish, too.
