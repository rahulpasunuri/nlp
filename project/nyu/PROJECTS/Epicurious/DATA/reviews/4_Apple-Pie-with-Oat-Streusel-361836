I found 450 degrees caused the top to burn after 15 minutes. So I rescued my pie removed the burnt parts and finished baking for another hour at 350 which was fine. I also used 4 lb of granny smith apples because I wanted to pie to feed 10 people without a problem. I used the basic flaky pie crust from epi which was kind of fussy but well worth the extra steps and the crust was big enough to roll for a deep dish pie. Pie was delicious and everyone totally enjoyed it. Love the topping.

i've been challenged to find a great apple crisp recipe so i made some adaptations to this. didn't use a crust. used 5 apples-- macoun and granny smith omitted the butter in the apples. used nutmeg instead of allspice in the topping. cut the butter in the topping to 6 tbsp baked it in a greased glass bread pan result: delicious. though, my daughter 'complained' it was too buttery. it is still rich. well, i did serve it topped with icecream or whipped cream. my husband has challenged me to replicate it.

This was my first attempt at making a homemade apple pie for my husband and we both found this recipe to be quite delicious. The crust was the most time consuming part and I would suggest making several ahead of time since this crust would do well with other pies. I didn't bother with freezing the shortening for the crust. I used regular Crisco at room temperature which did nicely. I also pre-baked the crust for 10 minutes and let it cool before adding the filling. The oats added a nice texture to both the crust and the topping. This time I used granny smith apples but I wouldn't be afraid to mix them with another kind for added sweetness. I must also say that this pie tasted even better the next day. I won't bother with store bought pies again. Homemade is time consuming but worth the effort. Frozen pies could never match this kind of flavor.

This recipe was fantastic. It's more like "apple crisp in a pie crust." I used five medium-sized Ginger Golds, which kept some tartness to balance the sweetness of the rest of the recipe; they held together really well. As recommended, I baked it at 350 the whole time and reduced the baking time to 50 minutes. I kept it uncovered the entire time. After 30 minutes, I dusted milk around the rim of the pie crust to help keep it from burning, then put it back in for 20 more minutes. It came out perfectly!

I read most of the reviews before I made this recipe. I used America's Test Kitchen's "best pie crust" for the crust recipe and omitted the oats as was called for in this recipe. Also, I prepped everything for this pie up to where I add the butter for the crumble when I had to put it on hold. I refrigerated the apples and the following day I poured off probably a cup of liquid. I continued where I left off, made the crumble and assembled the pie. I only baked it for 45 minutes and it turned out quite dark. Despite it's color, the pie was delicious and I'm making it again today.

Not impressed. At all.

My only quibble: The topping came out quite hard. It may need less flour or more butter or some water, so it stays moist. Or maybe just make less of it, so it's thinner on top of the pie and absorbs more of the moisture that evaporates from the filling.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was so good, I made it again the following Saturday. Second time through, I put a piece of foil over it as soon as I turned the temperature down to 350, and it was fine.

This tasted absolutely wonderful. I was worried about the amount of the spices, but when all was said and done it tasted fabulous. Like other reviewers, I found the baking time to be off. I ended up baking this pie for 1 hour total, not 1 hour 40 minutes. Keep an eye on it!

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family raved about it. I didn't have to bake it as long as suggested in the recipe. Today I am making this in the form of Apple Crisp.

I just made this for the first time for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it. It was absolutely amazing! I had it for breakfast and after dinner today.

I made three pies for a Thanksgiving dinner and this one was the hands- down winner. I suppose it didn't hurt that I used apples from our own orchard! However, the spices are interesting, but not overwhelming. I forgot to put the oats in the crust (I made my own pate brisee crust) but didn't seem to miss them. As with other readers, the time is too long and I also cut it by about 20 mins.

I am usually not a fan of apple pie but decided to make this recipe for my family. It is the best apple pie ever! I am definitely making this again -everyone loved it!

Very good recipe except I overcooked the pie. I reduced the cooking time by 20 minutes but the apples were still over cooked. I feel it is a 4 fork recipe but the cooking time needs to be reduced. I did not make any changes to the recipe.

Baking it right now---seems the cooking time should be a lot less. I dropped the temp to 350 like the recipe stated, but the outside crust is looking very very brown. Will report back

Wanted to try this but didn't have time to make a pie, so, I made it as an apple crisp. I added some frozen blueberries and black raspberries also. My husband said it was the best I ever made! Didn't use the processor for the crumbs, just mixed everything with my hands-very, very good!

This pie is absolutely delicious. I used Cortland apples and did not roll oats into the crust but did include in the topping, which was wonderful and would be great on blueberry pie as well. I see no reason to look for another apple pie recipe.

Wow! The streusel seems like too much, but use it all--it compresses. I used a combo of local apple varieties and the result was fantastic.

Delicious - especially with vanilla ice cream! I used 6 small granny smith apples for this recipe.
