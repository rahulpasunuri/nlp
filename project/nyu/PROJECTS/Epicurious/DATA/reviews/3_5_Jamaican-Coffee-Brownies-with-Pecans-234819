Not bad. Kind of gritty; there are better brownie recipes out there. I would try using instant espresso powder and perhaps a lighter glaze to offset the fudginess of the brownies.

Used margarine to accomodate dairy allergy, and substituted espresso powder for the ground coffee. Also added rum to the ganache and left off the ginger. They were a great hit at the office potluck and my son loved them so much he asked for them instead of a birthday cake.

Make these brownies at the coffeehouse I work at. Everyone loves them. Just make sure the coffee is finely ground for the batter.

Something in the appearance scared the guests but the texture made them very difficult to cut, so maybe it was the messy presentation. However, the flavor was great.

This is a dense, rich brownie which could bring out the flavor of any good coffee one would like to feature. I agree that the nuts aren't needed. I initially thought that they left out the baking powder, but the batter is so thick, it wouldn't help. I used Trader Joe's Gingerbread coffee in the batter (end result was not gritty)and for the sake of time, sprinkled a chopped bar of dark chocolate with crystalized ginger over the hot brownie tray, and spread once it was melted. Overbaked it a little, but still perfect for a small hit of chocolate love. Definitely a standout, not to be served alongside any other desserts and not for brownie sundaes.

This is the best brownie recipe ever. It packs a serious caffeine punch, so it's often the one I make for a late night treat when you need to stay awake. I'm the "dessert person." Whenever I need to bring something for an event, I bring a dessert and I get the best response from this one. It's one of those that I should probably just print out the recipe to hand out. Rich, moist and befitting even the biggest chocoholic.

Delicious. The coffee gave the brownies a unique, but subtle flavor. The amount of butter used was a bit strange. Why not use the whole stick?

I am not a fan of this recipe. The brownies are not fudgy or moist enough and the texture is a little strange. They might have been better in a smaller pan but I will not be trying this recipe again.

Sorry, the ground coffee beans gave the brownies a gritty texture.

Rich, moist and the coffee flavor with the chocolate is to die for. Great brownie recipe that I would make again.

I made this with a few changes. Because I like a thicker brownie, I used an 11X8 inch Pyrex baking dish and increased the baking time by about 8 minutes. I used a mix of regular cocoa and the black cocoa powder sold by the Baker's Catalogue in the brownie mix. For the ganache, I used milk chocolate chips (I like dessrts on the sweeter side) and replaced some of the coffee with Kahlua. I skipped the pecans and instead of using crystallized ginger strips, I diced it fine and sprinkled it over top. The favor and texture are fabulous! A very easy recipe and well worth the time and effort.

These brownies are wonderfully rich and fudgy. With the exception of the brand of coffee (I used a strong, dark roast), I follwed the recipe as written, and it was great! I also topped each brownie with a chocolate covered coffee bean. These brownies were gone in no time and are requested often by family and friends.

I am a connoisseur of brownies. In this recipe I have found THE PERFECT BROWNIE. I went ahead and used two whole sticks of butter and just melted the ingredients in a pot instead of submersing a metal bowl in hot water to melt. As for the flour, I used whole wheat and dumped it in rather than sift it in. And I used what ever coffee I had in the house. I also omitted the nuts; in my opinion they pollute a perfect brownie. I satisfied my craving for warm gooey chocolate in about 45 minutes! These brownies blow doors off brownies made with baker's chocolate. My search for the perfect brownie has ended!!
