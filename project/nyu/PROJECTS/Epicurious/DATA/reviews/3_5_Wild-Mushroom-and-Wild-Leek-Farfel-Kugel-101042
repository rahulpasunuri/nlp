Heed the advice of all here! I loved this! However, it does need less stock, less butter (or oil if you are serving with meat), and about 30 minutes in the oven at 350-400 (I did 20 uncovered at 350, then took the cover off and bumped it up to 400). I think you could saute the mushrooms, onions and leeks as directed, and then mix it with eggs, stock and farfel and just bake it in a pyrex. . I will definitely make it again, but I plan to play around with it. I added sage (did not have thyme), salt and pepper and garlic powder. It was delicious.

Where did I go wrong? I doubled the mushrooms, sauteed everything as the recipe required, added some herbs and salt and pepper, added the eggs and farfel as directed and when I put it in the pan for baking, nothing happened. I had what looked like broken crackers in broth. I panicked and went back to the original recipe and stirred it in the skillet again and that made it thicken up but it still was very unappetizing. No pillows of matzoh but a dark mess of broken matzoh without much flavor. I had made a recipe from Gourmet years ago that was better but I couldn't find it. No one ate much of it and I certainly will not make it again.

A wonderful result with this recipe and many kudos. Thanks to others for helpful comments. Doubled the mushrooms, added parley, pepper, spring onions and placed in the oven (covered) for about 30 minutes. Fully intend to cook again next year.

this was amazing after all of the edits! i highly recommend it as my guests literally were scraping it out of the pan with matzoh at the end of the night. literally. I added red peppers to the mix of all the veggies, lots of garlic, thyme and rosemary and good paprika. the slightly smokey flavor of the paprika gave the dish the richness that it needed to meld all the flavors together. i used about 10 oz of matzoh meal instead of 12 and 3 eggs in stead of 4, and about a 3/4cup less broth, giver or take. i covered with foil baked on a lowish heat of 350 for about an hour. i was hoping it would get fluffier but that may be because i used less matzoh meal and eggs. i also had to remind myself that it's passover and not much is supposed to be fluffy this week! ha. steps: cook onion, add garlic, then add leeks, then add shrooms, then red peppers, then add a cup or so of broth to simmer along with extra spices. mix matzoh meal and eggs in a small bowl and add to pan of all the veggis. stir, add in remaining broth. transfer to casserole dish, bake covered and voila!

This recipe really worked, especially with the tips from the reviewers. I have one more. First, saute the onions and leeks. Add the mushrooms when the onions turn translucent and the leeks are well wilted. After five minutes, dump them into a casserole. Then, combine the farfel and eggs. Once the farfel has absorbed the eggs and gotten 'toasty', then add the vegetable mixture back in and combine. Add the vegetable stock and return the whole mess back to the casserole. Cover with foil and bake for about 20 minutes so that the edges get crisp. Fantastic!

I followed the suggestions of a cook from NY on 04/22/08, since clearly a kugel must be BAKED and should not require a zillion pots and pans. Additionally (you knew that was coming!), I used whole wheat matzoh instead of gut-clogging white-flour farfel. I put about 10 sheets of it in the oven at 350 for about 5 minutes to crisp them; crumbled them in a food processor to a mixture of coarse and fine crumbs (I was aiming for uniformity, but "whatever...."); combined them with 5 beaten eggs, and--skipping the instruction to roast that mess in a skillet--simply added them, plus stock, to the skillet in which I had sauteed first the onion, then a little garlic, then the leeks, then the chopped mushrooms, as recommended by the wise cook from New York. To this wet mess I added some salt, and probably should have added a little more, and maybe some black pepper. (Next time!) Transferred to two baking dishes and baked while chicken roasted, at 400, COVERED with glass (they threatened to burn at 400). Everyone loved it--veteran kugel- eaters and newbies alike.

This was a delicious recipe and perfect for Pesach dinner last night...however, it did need altering as referenced by other reviewers. I doubled the amount of mushrooms and I felt it still could have used more! I was generous with salt & pepper, especially on the farfel egg mixture. I added dried thyme to the mixture before all the liquid was absorbed and the liquid I used was chicken stock. All that being said - this was delicious last night and even more yummy today for lunch!

Using the advice from previous reviewers, I tried to simplify the cooking steps to eliminate some of the pots. Since "kugel" means "pudding", I would have to say that this is not a kugel, as it does not solidify as a pudding would. It is tasty, however. I added chunks of leftover cooked turkey, so it was a main dish. I would make it again, but with revised expectations for a kugel type dish.

I call this "Matzoh Pillows" because the farfel plumps beautifully. Better this year than last because I measured everything. I also used chicken soup (re-hydrated powder) instead of vegetable stock. Great the next day, too.

0 forks. This is the worst dish I've ever made from Epicurious (and one of the worst, generally). Practically no one could eat it, and it left us with a skimpy Seder meal. Bland and the farfel seemed unrelated in texture and taste to the mushroom leek.

This was terrific, but I cooked it slightly differently. First, forget all those pots. Cook the onion until soft (8-10 mins), then add some chopped garlic and cook that a minute, then add the leeks and cook those for 10-15 minutes, then add the mushrooms and cover while those cook, about another 10 minutes. Add it all to the matzoh farfel. Once I added the liquid and cooked for a little while, I got nervous so I put it all into two large, shallow baking pans and baked them at 350 until done. Fabulous. Also, since around here, matzoh fargel comes in 1 pound boxes, I used it all and just added an extra egg.

i tripled the recipe, as i was making it for 35 people. maybe that's why it took me nearly 3 hours on top of the stove, plus another hour in the oven. i foolishly followed the instructions instead of the reviews. this would have been sooo much better with some herbs and lots of salt and pepper. as it was, i found it quite bland and not worth the time and effort.

Used about 1 c. extra each of leeks and mushrooms, plus extra butter for cooking the mushrooms. Added stock on the stove but then finished it off at 350 degrees in the oven. Thanks to other users for the helpful comments -- baking does make all the difference, and it comes out great.

This is a delicious passover dish. I have tried it with different kinds of mushrooms, including shitakes, and everyone has enjoyed the results. Many have commented on how it's a nice change from more traditional versions of farfel kugel.

Great, especially after reading all the comments. I made this recipe the week before Passover following it the letter, except I did the baking method and did add dried Thyme. After trying the basic recipe, I altered it further by using chicken stock, many more leeks as well as the best selection of very flavorful mushrooms ( 4 - 5 types including cinnamin, oyster, portabello, and some others which are very woodsy in flavor and the names of which I forget...used Whole Foods to get mushrooms) greatly increased amount of leeks, added salt and pepper to taste and the garlic suggested by another cook along with dried Thyme. Used the bake and reheat method and it was perfect. Had nothing but raves (everyone wanted some of the leftovers!) and determined that this is a side dish for all seasons as well as non-Jews alike!

I found this underwhelming. I think it could use about half the amount of farfel+egg, and a lot more mushrooms.

Once again, thanks to other cooks for their comments, which so often make a good dish great. I made the baked version (easier than the stovetop version), using oyster and shitake mushrooms. I didn't have matzo farfel, but I did have a box of egg-and-onion matzo, which I broke into farfel-sized pieces with great results. Also, in addition to a bit of thyme, I added rosemary to the stock. Great side dish.

this was one of the hits of the seder- I used shitaki, oyster, crimini and black trumpet mushrooms. for the cook in CA- if you are in the Bay Area you can get farfel at Molly Stones in Palo Alto. If not, just break matzoh up into tiny pieces by putting into a zipped plastic bag and using a rolling pin over it until you get tiny pieces the size of plaster chips.

What is matzoh farfel and where can I buy it?

This kugel tasted delicious - but, I did make some adjustments that made a difference after reading the other reviews (very helpful!). I sauteed garlic with the leeks and added fresh thyme with the stock. I made it the day before and re-heated it in a 10x14ish glass pan before serving. It turned out really well. Next time, I might try adding some toasted pinenuts as a finishing touch. Ps. You don't need all those dirty pans - use one and take turns...

I was hesitant to make this dish, with all of the juggling of pans suggested, but my husband loves leeks. It turned out great and was worth the effort. This is the best Passover dish I've ever eaten. My 13 month old gobbled it up, too.

Absolutely delish! Even after the Seder was over and dishes were being washed, I was still nibbling on this!

This was extremely bland, in my opinion. I wonder if it would be much better with chicken stock than the veggie. I made it for Seder based on the rave reviews and found it disappointing. I felt like it was a waste of my $20 a pound chanterelles and dried porcinis, as they were lost in the dish! I followed the oven directions given below, and since there were no wild leeks to be found I used regular ones. I was pretty disappointed since this recipe sounded so tasty.

I have had excellent success with this recipe when I bake it in the oven. This year I tried it on the stovetop as written and burnt it... twice. Next year it goes back in the oven.

A dressed-up version of an old standard. Mushrooms and leeks really make the dish. Very popular with my traditional mother-in-law.

iT WAS TASTY AND NOT ONE OF THOSE HEAVY LAY ON YOUR CHEST PASSOVER FOOD. WENT GREAT WITH A ROAST CHICKEN RECEIPE FROM YOUR PASSOVER FILE. IT WAS THE ORANGE,LEMON GINGER ROAST CHICKEN.

Better variation:Use a little olive oil with the farfel and eggs to make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom of the fry pan. Also use a little oil to saute the mushrooms. Grease a 9 X 13 pan. Add farfel,leek and mushroom mixture. Then add vegetable stock. Cook in 400 degree oven for 20-25 minutes. I think this improves on the original recipe.
