First, use a whole head of garlic. You're roasting it, so it won't be too strong. Double the tomatoes. And, I am no vegetarian nor health-nut, in fact, I cooked this recipe specifically because I was looking for something different to do with some Italian sausage, but this dish is excellent without the sausage, too. I'll definitely make it again, with more garlic and tomatoes, and I'll probably try regular Parmesan cheese. This is good food.

I made this a little less labor intensive by broiling the veggies instead of grilling. Also chopped up the sausage and drained, threw in the broiled veggies and the sauce and mixed in the pasta to reheat. Great way to sneak in veggies about which the kids know nothing- eggplant and carrots were extras.

We had to make some adjustments since the grocery is 35 minutes away. Had some leftover grilled eggplant and red pepper that was heated in the oven. Very small grill so did not grill the garlic,just chopped and put in blender. Used a locally made medium sausage that is not Italian but it worked well. Had homegrown tomatoes and homegrown green peppers. Even with our adjustments it was a wonderful dinner which will be made over again many times!

I'm not a big fan of Zucchini, but really wanted to try this recipe. My solution substitute the zucchini with eggplant. Cut a single eggplant into 1/4 inch thick rounds, salted the rounds and let them sit on a strainer for a couple of hours to draw out the bitter juice. Cooked the rest as the recipe is written except that I pureed all of the veggies and then ran the puree through my food mill. Finally I finished it off with crumbled Gorgonzola instead of the ricotta. This taste combination was awesome. Will be making this one a lot in the future.

Wow! I'm part of the choir on this one. We ate on the patio, and it was just a great summertime dinner. Didn't have sherry vinegar, so used 2 tbl. red wine & 1 tbl. balsamic in the sauce. Guests gobbled it up - everyone had seconds. Used a little less than l lb. of ziti.

3 and 1/2 forks because it's awesome but it's a little labor intensive. it makes a lot of food. I used hot italian sausage, up the garlic, and add some red pepper flakes. i will make this again.

when i sat down to check out the recipe my hubs chose, i got up and said, oh, not now. not really a quick week-night meal, but make it on a friday or saturday. seemed like a lot of prep; i broiled the garlic and toms; but pretty much followed the recipe after that. i threw the feta on top of the chopped veggies, added the noodles, so the feta melted a little, then mixed. very, very tasty. had no basil, mixed in some dried oregano with the broiled toms and garlic.

Such a fabulous recipe! We've made it a couple times now, without the sausages, and without the skewers - you can get by with a grill basket/ aluminum foil if you prefer. Definitely one of my top ten Epicurious recipes. Kind of labor - intensive, but worth it, and you'll have leftovers. Even without the sausages, this makes at least 6 large portions; but we (a couple) always make the full recipe - it's so good! The only modifications I've made to the recipe itself is the oil: I think you need the full 6T (or very close) to prep the veggies, but usually they retain enough that I don't find it necessary to add more oil to the blended mixture.

We used this as a base for a dinner party. We grilled all of the vegetables and pureed them into a sauce for pasta, but left quite a few others on skewers. Guests had the option of mixing in the vegetables of their choice into their pasta. We also served this with grilled chicken instead of sausage.

I have made this many times, always with great success. The flavors are big and fresh, and each time it has served six people with some leftovers. I've also made the rest of the Easy Street menu - the bluefish spread to start and the cherry pie for dessert are also winners. Fantastic!!

First off, I have to note that this was the most wonderfully aromatic meal I beleive I have ever cooked. It smelled absolutely FANTASTIC as it cooked. I changed it up just a bit adding balsamic rather than sherry vinegar and a good amount of basil to the blended sauce. I also reduced the amount of zucchini in the sauce as I wanted a more tomato-ey sauce. A word to the wise: a dish with this many vegetables ought to be healthy so I toned down the rediculous amount of oil with no problems and served it with chicken breast marinated in fennel, red pepper flake, garlic, lemon, and balsamic vinegar. The chicken married perfectly with the addictingly delicious and ludicrously simple marinara sauce. Be sure to use the feta cheese- it's creamy tanginess is essential! I can't imagine a more delicious use for summer's bounty of vegetables. I will make again and again!!!

As others have said this was a fabulous recipe. I used andouille sausages which were great. The sauce when pureed actually seemed creamy. It's deceptively healthy. I also felt it could easily feed 6. We will be having left overs for lunch.

This pasta was fantastic! I made half the recipe for two people and had lots leftover, which we ate cold as a pasta salad (also great!).

WOW. Delicious. I loved the blended veggie sauce, both healthy and delicious. Instead of links, I bought a package of loose sausage, crumbled it, and then broiled it with everything else. The crumbles allowed the sausage flavor to blend well with the other flavors.

this was excellent. i added 1/2 grilled eggplant, more garlic, and used chicken with truffles sausage. I also added 3 tbsp of balsamic vinegar to blender, and used 4 oz of herb goat cheese instead of feta. wonderful.

I've used this many times to serve for friends of the family because it's easy to put together. I substitute balsamic for sherry. I think it adds a nice sweetness. This quickly became a family favorite.

This is pretty good. We had plenty of veggies and only used about 2/3 of the recipe. Add pepper flakes for some zing.

I don't have a grill so I broiled the vegetables and fried the sausages, then sliced everything up, blended ~1/3 of the veggies with the rest of the sauce ingredients and tossed everything together with the pasta and shredded parmesan. Also substituted red wine vinegar for sherry. It was a great, healthy- tasting, and hearty one-dish meal for a gathering of friends. Made enough for at least 8 people. Sauteed the garlic in the 1/4c oil used for the sauce instead of roasting which gave a great garlic flavor throughout the sauce once blended. Also skipped peeling the peppers, not really necessary.

Absolutely wonderful. If this only serves 4, those people have a BIG appetite! Had a little difficulty keeping things warm while blending, etc., but the aroma and taste were exceptional. I didn't have ricotta salada so added fresh mozzarella, cubed, to the hot pasta. Will make again this week

Spectacular! It takes a little bit of time, but it is well worth it. I used Trader Joe's spicy Italian sausage, which was a perfect foil for the rest of the ingredients.

This recipe does take a while to make, but it is so delicious! I used parmesan cheese and that worked very well. I will definitely make this again. It's also worthy of serving to guests.

This recipe is superb. It's a little time consuming with having to grill all the veggies but it is so worth it when it's all done. It's a great vegetarian recipe too if you leave out the sausage. It's definitely one of my top 10 favs!

This was *fantastic!* I wasn't sure how it was all going to come together, but it was so good. It made a LOT of food, too. We had it for lunch for 2 days afterward. We're not vegetarians, so we decided to dice up the sausage (we used hot Italian) and stir it in with the pasta at the end. It made a nice spicy flavor throughout. We didn't have sherry vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar and champagne vinegar (half and half) and it tasted really good. Would definitely make this again.

Made this vegetarian (no sausage) and it was excellent. Hubbie chowed the leftovers, too.

Yum! Yum! Yum! This is fun to do with a couple of people to help. Can even eat without the sausages, or you can slice the sausages into the pasta. Either way, it's all very good.

This is fabulous, and a beautiful presentation! Definetly can feed more than 4 though, and I didn't invite some people over for dinner because of the "makes four servings", I would say hands down enough for 6 people.

My husband and I don't eat a lot of pasta dishes, they tend to be boring to us, but not this one! We both loved it. Leftovers warmed well and were equally good cold.
