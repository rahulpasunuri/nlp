This is lovely! I would make a bit more dressing, personally. We are Marylanders and lovers of blue crab, so believe me that we don't want to overwhelm that flavor, but the dressing is just delicious and very complementary. I think just maybe 1 1/2 times as much. The citrusy and gingery tang is wonderful. I also used sesame chili oil, b/c that's all i had, and didn't notice a difference.

This was so easy to make and absolutely delicious!! Made it for family on Christmas Eve, and was a great way to kick off the festivities! The wasabi adds a nice kick. I didn't serve on lettuce but instead added some shredded cabbage for crunch.

This is the ubiquitous "Prawn Cocktail" all grown up! Anyone living in the UK during the eighties will recall the standard pub fare offering of tepid prawns drowned in salad cream and ketchup over a bed of lettuce...this tasty morsel is thankfully far removed! I used a jar of claw meat, wasabi powder and double the lime zest. Instead of Chinese or Boston greens, I had Butter Lettuce available. Verdict from my Cuban Sweetie and I - "Delicious!"

This was great! A very tasty alternative to either crabcakes or shrimp cocktail. The flavours are just right. And not hard at all, my easily discouraged wife had no trouble with this.
