I made this with heirloom veggies from my garden, tararind paste, and raw sugar with pork. next time i would certainly use either eggs or tofu as a protien.

I made this as a main dish and added broccoli and celery and next time I would consider fying up some tofu to go with it. Also we like things spicy here so I added flaked chili peppers and it made a nice contrast with the sweet of the dish. Spicy and sweet ! Yummy! Sadly I didn't have basil on hand and I think that the basil would have made the dish sooo much yummier.

Great side dish with Asian cuisine. The thai basil is a must. I used prepackaged fried shallot and garlic - and skipped the tomatoes and bell pepper.

Great side dish for Asian cuisine. I used the prepackaged fried garlic and shallot from my Asian and Indian markets. Didn't use the tomotoes or bell peppers. Thai basil is a must!

This is a great side dish. I used the already fried shallot and garlic products from my asian and indian markets -cut down the time. I also skipped the tomatoes and bell pepper.

This dish was okay, but it's very labor intensive and doesn't quite pay off. For all the work that's involved in preparing this recipe I would expect my taste buds to be blown away with delight. I also found the flavor combination to be a little too acidic and awkward. Tomatoes and Asian rice noodles just don't work for me. Sorry.

This recipe was de-o-double-dog-licious!! We made it along with the roasted marinated cornish hens and cucumber carrot salad. Frying the shallots and garlic gives this a great flavor combination. Will definitely make this again.
