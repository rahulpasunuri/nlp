I made this for a supper club gathering that had a "meat" theme. Added 3 good squirts of honey to the dressing and chopped unsalted peanuts as suggested by another reviewer. People liked the salad.

Beware of Sesame. And the Nam is too strong as well. Try Hoisin. I cannot people rated this higher, I can only imagine that there collective asian palate lacks in understanding

Was pleased with how quick and easy yet flavorful this dish was. I agree with the review to go light on the sesame oil, but other than that I followed the directions exactly as directed for a nice change of pace from the salad bar pick-up we usually get when short on time.

Beware. Sesame oil amount must be a typo. Way too strong. I would start with 1/2 instead of 2 1/2

This recipe needed a little more punch. I first replaced the fish sauce with soy sauce (more palatable for many folks). I also added bean sprouts, lots of chopped cilantro, chopped dry roasted peanuts, and a chopped jalapeno. Once that was added, it was fantastic. Could even have used more jalapeno.

used 1T (not 2.5T)of lime juice, sesame oil, and fish sauce [eliminating the veg. oil] and used only 1t of grated rind(not 2). i ADDED a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, 1/2t grated ginger, 1/2C frozen corn, and 1/2C of fresh asparagus. i then microwaved the whole thing 3min (w/the beef of course) and served it over noodles. to give the nooles some kick i added garlic powder and pepper to the water in which i boiled them. a big hit! thanks to the reviewer that said it was too oily, AND the reviewer that said it was "DRIPPY". with the paired down dressing and the elimination of the veg.oil, this is a Do Again

I was recently on vacation and had Thai Beef Salad for the first time and it was delicious. Hoping to re-create it, i turned to epicurious. Unfortunatly, I found this recipe to be terrible. I couldn't even finish the salad. Way too much sesame oil.

This was really terrific! We made it into a wrap with spinach tortillas - tasty even though they dripped quite a bit.

I substituted 1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced for the radish. The strong onion makes the dish. I also tossed in a teaspoon of hot pepper flakes. Fabulous.

Recipe was very simple to prepare, but the dressing was too salty, and did not have the complex flavors I expect with a Thai Beef Salad.

Very tasty and quick to make. I replaced the romain with napa cabbage and served it over rice.

This is a great recipe. Have made it several times and loved it! It is easy to prepare and makes a great summer lunch or light dinner. Definitely a keeper for my recipe file.

Being allergic to fish, I opted for a mix of stir fry sauce and chili paste as a substitute and it was wonderful. I would suggest serving with a starch of some kind: I served over rice and perhaps add a few more vegetables. Definately will make again.

sesame noodle become to glass noodle is much better what do you think?
