I make this every year at Thanksgiving and it is a huge favorite with everyone. Great for leftovers too. VERY easy to make.

This recipe comes out tasting like it takes much longer to prepare. Few other shortcuts - I use precut/diced butternut squash (find dealing with the whole squash difficult) and steam in the microwave. I use a fork to mash, not processor. it has a little texture, like real mashed potatoes. i personally like pinenuts better than walnuts. This is a nice change of pace from basic potatoes and its really not "au gratin" so not too much dairy. i make this often every fall/winter to rave reviews

My family and I didn't like this dish at all! The parmesan was a terrible addition with the nuts!

MAN THIS IS GOOD. We even tried a low-fat version (as my partner and I don't eat dairy.) We substituted butter with margarine (Earth Balance from Trader Joes is really flavorful), adding a bit of rice parmesean, rice cheddar and found it to be absolutely delicious.

Very simple and nutritious. And my 2-year-old liked it as well (an extra bonus)! I didn't add any nuts as she has an allergy, but it was still quite tasty.

I served this dish at Thanksgiving to guests who were unfamiliar with squash. They loved it! Even one guest who does not like squash loved it. I also substituted pine nuts for the walnuts with fantastic results. This recipe will become part of my cherished holiday collection. My plain boiled squash recipe is banished forever!

This was really delicious - I substituted toasted pine nuts - as I did not have walnuts and it was great!

This recipe was wonderful! I added some steamed kale for added nutrition. It also made it look very pretty. My husband does not like squash, but he raved over this recipe. He suggested we serve this at Thanksgiving.

Great simple, delicious way to dress up a favorite winter vegetable. I agree w/ a previous rater about the food processor, don't need it. I just pureed the squash cubes w/ a hand held blender. I tripled the recipe for a Christmas eve dinner party and it was a big hit.

This is so tasty and simple. Great accompaniment for baked chicken. I added a smidge of cayenne. I look forward to making it in the fall when the squash is plentiful. My kids even ate it!

I've been looking for a recipe that will make my husband want to eat squash--this isn't it, but I'll cook this again, just for myself! One tip--after steaming for 15 minutes, you don't need to mess up a food processor to puree this; the squash is so tender, you can almost whip it with a fork.
