These are very good, an easy way to use up leftover apples. I used a mandoline and the chips were done at 1 hour 40 minutes- they just need to be watched.

I made them paper thin, and that means to me 1 mm. thick, so I turned the oven and at 15 min. they were all burned. So I think is nice recipe, and i will try it again, but I will low down the oven or keep an eye every 10 min. or make them more thick !!

These are great snacks and very easy to make with an inexpensive mandolin. They turn out nice and crispy. I don't know how long they keep because we ate them all in one sitting. I just made a second batch for the grandkids.
