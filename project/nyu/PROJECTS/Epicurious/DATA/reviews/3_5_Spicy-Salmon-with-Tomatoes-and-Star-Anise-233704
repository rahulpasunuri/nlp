the sauce was good and nicely spicy but didn't overpower the anise. I agree that it may go better with something other than salmon, it just didn't seem quite right. I think pork would be a better choice. My husband was raving.

The star anise and tomato relish was delicious. I would make it again to accompany other fish dishes. It would also be great on eggs.

Unique and delicious combination of flavors. At first I was skeptical about using tomato with the Chinese spices, but combination was a wonderful compliment to the briny, creamy wild salmon. I increased the sauce by 50% and thought this was about the right amount relative to the fish. I decide to go pan-Asian-fusion and served this with basmati rice cooked with coconut milk, cardamon, cumin, and coriander - was very pleased with the combination.

We made this as written and we liked it, but somehow it didn't seem to work as well as we wanted with the salmon. We both thought this sauce would be much better served with a good New York strip steak.

I just whipped this up for a quick dinner for myself using canned salmon and it was excellent.

In my family we have the concept of "recipe value" which is the ratio of yumminess to fussiness. This is a high-scorer because it is super easy and fast and tastes like it required much more work. It is a week night staple and we also serve it at casual dinners with friends.

Yum! Used plain tomatoes which was fine. Just be careful not to over cook the sauce i.e. leave it a little sloppy. I also accidentally overcooked the salmon by heating the dinner plates too much! (It kept cooking). Freshly ground star anise is a must. Agree with 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper.

I have made this recipe twice and have grilled the salmon and sauted the onions, etc. in the seseame oil and find this method is both delicious and reduces unpleasant cooking odors. I love spicy foods but I have to say that 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper is definitely adequate. I think it is safe to say that the sauce can be made up to 48 hours in advance of serving thus making this a great entre item for dinner parties when you want to do as much in advance as possible so that you can spend more time with your guests.

When I decided to try this I didn't think I would like it as much as I do. Not only is it quick and simple, but the sauce would be excellent with chicken or pork tenderloin as well.
