Very good - and different than your run of the mill ravioli. I served it as a first course with the tomato sauce. It was a hit!

I really enoyed this recipe. Based on other reviewers suggestions, I used wonton skins and served with a light butter sauce. However, I may try a tomato sauce next time. I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins and think it worked well to balance out the sweetness of the chard and butter.

These were really good, and also they freeze very well. I actually prefer them with just oil and parmesan because the flavors inside the ravioli are so nice as they are. But the tomato sauce is also good.

Simple and delicious! Even if you cheat and use wonton wrappers as I did when pressed for time. This will definitely be a regular during chard season.

This was terrific although I made several changes. I cut down the amount of golden raisins a little and added a bit of fresh ground nutmeg to the filling. For the raviolis themselves I made them large (about 3X3) so each person gets about 6. I did not like the idea of the tomato sauce with the sweet filling so I made a light butter sauce instead. 6 T of butter, 1 T of olive oil, 1T of vermouth, ¾ t of fresh rosemary (chopped very fine), 1 T of water. I tossed the raviolis in the pan with the sauce to coat and served with shaved Parmesano Reggiano and a little ground nutmeg. It was a big hit!

I wouldn't change a thing. The pine nuts, raisins, and olives made it interesting. It isn't spicy, but I found it flavorful. I used a lot of pepper. It serves four very generously. Finely chopping six cups of chard is labor intensive, so I didn't have the energy to make tomato sauce. Instead I sauteed some shallot and pine nuts in butter and served the ravioli with that and a dollop of left over filling.

I agree this was a fun dish to make -- the food processor pasta dough is spectacular, and can be used for making other styles of pasta. Though I liked the ravioli with the filling as specified, I wonder if a cream sauce of some nature (maybe a garlic cream sauce) would have been more complimentary with the ravioli.

This was a fun dish to prepare. I'm a novice cook and with my limitations in consideration I found the meal to be excellent. I added Risota cheese to the filling mix. I was wondering if anyone out there had any additional suggestions to give the filling more "bite", some herbs maybe? I'd like to keep the reciepe vegetarian, but I thought a little meat might have been nice. Also, I modified the quick sauce with some additional veggies (red bell pepper, extra garlic, and most importantly fresh oregeno). The sauce was most excellent and I can't believe how easy it was to make! I can't wait to try this one again.
