I washed the olives a good bit to get out a lot of their salt and smashed them like another reviewer suggested. I liked the results, but my wife (1/2 New Jersey Italian) did not.

The only step I would add is something my Sicilian grandmother always did. She cracked open the olives by placing them on a board and smashing them with the bottom of a canning jar! This splits them open and allows them to absorb the flavors of the dressing.

I made this salad for a family get together and got rave reviews. Someone was even dipping their bread into the leftover oil. It's an olive salad, so I would expect everything to taste like olives. However, I did use a mix of different types of olives. I'd definitely make this salad again.

This is the first recipe on epicurious that I will not make again. Everything in the salad tasted like very salty olives, especially after marinating for a day or two. If you do attempt to make this recipe, make sure you soak the olives in water so that some of the other flavors have a chance to come through.
