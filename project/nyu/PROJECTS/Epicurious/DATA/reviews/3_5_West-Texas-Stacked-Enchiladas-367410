I have made this recipe numerous times. I LOVE this recipe. My Mexican friends always say, "wow, this is really authentic". In response to "A cook from SD", epicurious is not the website to use if you are searching for "60 second meals". Yes it takes some work, but doesn't all GOOD FOOD.

I added shredded chicken to the stacks and they were pure deliciousness! Will definitely make again!

WAAAAYYY too much work and too many pots & pans for something that should be so simple. Won't do it again. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/West-Texas-Stacked-Enchiladas-367410#ixzz1wn23qdTM

Absolutely delicious! I did change a few things, but overall stayed with the original recipe and it turned out great. I doubled the amount of chicken broth, chipotle chiles, and spices for the sauce. I shredded up a rotisserie chicken and added the remaining onions and some of the sauce to that, and after I fried the tortillas I dipped them in the sauce. I layered the enchiladas like normal, but then topped them with more chopped onions and sauce. I skipped the fried eggs, but will probably try that next time!
