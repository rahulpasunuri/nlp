This recipe is absolutely amazing! The ganache is so decadent that it is like an entire slice of truffle. I have made this recipe multiple times and everyone has adored it. Make sure you use bittersweet chocolate (not milk or semi-sweet) for the best flavor. It is also great with a layer of raspberry preserves thinned with vanilla rum on the bottom under the chocolate.

Save yourself the trouble and just serve a chocolate bar ... this tart is really a pastry-bottomed chocolate bar, not much more. It looks great: the marbleized effect is stunning. And served in TEENSY portions, it's a nice little flavor sensation next to other desserts, say for Thanksgiving. But on its own, as a regular portion, well, as I said, you may as well just serve a chocolate bar.

It looks very pretty but it's far too rich actually to *eat.* If I want solid chocolate, I'll have a truffle and save myself all the work.

Truly easy to make and folks are ga-ga over how gorgeous it looks. When I took it in to an office lunch, I had to fight people off to be able to cut it. YUM.
