I make a similar preparation, but to answer to those who thought the recipe bland, add some grated parmesan, a dash of cayenne and paprika to the bread crumbs. This kicks up the flavor a good bit.

Super-yum! I needed a new pork chop idea. Simple, straightfoward, and sooooo tasty..this is going to be a summer- season staple.

I thought this recipe was just ok. The salad was very light and tasty, however the pork chops took a long time to make, and I did not feel that there was anything special about the taste.

Tried this back in March '04 and wrote a review. Tried it again substituting pounded chicken breasts and still enjoyed it. Using panko and parmesan add crunch. Won't wait as long to make this next time.

excellent and easy. Should be served with room temperature greens and dressing.

I changed the salad mixture somewhat. I seeded and diced ripe plum tomatoes. They were marinated for 1 hour in a balsamic vinegar and oil dressing containing basil and parsley. I let them sit in the refigerator to chill during the marinade period for a contrast of tempatures when serving. I tossed this with the arugula. Fresh balls of mozzarella with the salad would be my next addition. Heavenly and LOW carb.

Excellent, the intructions to cook slowly in EVOO and butter created a beautiful golden crust. Suggest brining he pork first to tenderize and adding grated fresh parmesan to the panko for flavor. Could pass for veal once brined.

Easy, quick and delicious. The arugula salad was great! Such a simple dressing, but really, really good.

Echoing others ... so simple, so delicious. Will certainly make again. It's hard to argue with a quick meal like this one that looks so polished and professional. I particularly like the simplicity of the dressing on the greens.

I would never have believed something so simple could be so delicious! The pork was amazingly tender and moist. The simple salad was the perfect accompaniment. Can't wait to make it again.

This was a lovely meal, and I just added some rice and french bread. I think the pork chop by itself would be abit bland, but it went very well with the arugula salad. I'll definately make it again.

Grrrrr. . .yum yum.Try making it with pounded, boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Delicious, but depends on good olive oil and good tomatoes. The essence of simplicity: very quick and scrumptious and lets the inherent flavors of each element shine through.
