It may have been the quality of the meat I bought, but the veal chops didn't taste good and we won't be making this recipe again.

My wife purchased two 3/4 inch veal chops that weighed a half pound each. I did not have mixed peppercorns so I used green and black peppercorns along with some dryed juniper berries and the fresh rosemary to coat the chops. I prepared them with a very hot ridged iron frying pan with a coating of olive oil on the pan. Left the chops in the pan for about 4 minutes on each side and then let them stand on the plate as I was finishing the following addition to the meal. In a saute pan I added some olive oil and when hot, but not smoking I added 4 garlic cloves, minced. To this I added a pint of sliced brown fresh mushrooms. As the mushroom were waiting in the pan to heat up I added about 1/4 to 1/3 of dry Marsella wine. Keeping the heat high and stirring as the liquid kept reducing and not allowing the mushrooms to sit in any one place in the pan too long, I added a couple of tablespoons of chopped fresh taragon. When the liquid reduced down to about 3 to 4 tablespoons and thickend a little, I added about 1/3 cup of heavy cream and continued to stir until the thickened sauce became part of mushrooms with some liquid in the pan. Poured the mushrooms over the waiting chops, added some steamed asparagus to the dish and waited for Emeril to call and ask me to sub for him on his show.

Perfectly fine, but not exactly a recipe as just "duh."

Nice when something so simple tastes so good. I fixed the chops early in the day then we grilled them (without a drip pan) for jut a few minutes a side.

Simple and delicious. It was definitely a hit in our house.

Very nice dish, which works equally well with lamb chops. Also can be done on the grill, using a foil pan to catch the drippings.
