This was the perfect topper to the feta stuffed eggplants. Delicious. Don't change a thing.

I'd give this a 4 with the addition of capers and a few squeezes of lemon juice. Very nice with mixing in other fresh herbs as well, such as oregano or marjoram or savory. Cook in Chicago, was it? This is an Italian sauce, for use primarily with meats or grilled vegetables, not Mexican. The word "salsa" is just "sauce" in Italian.

Tried this recipe last year and planned to use it more frequently than I have. I loved the taste and the bright green color. My husband also thought it was quite tasty.

This is a delicious sauce and so beautiful. I served it with feta stuffed eggplant and arugula rolls and it was heavenly.

This sauce was tasty, but definately NOT Mexican in flavor. I wouldn't want to put it on my tacos or mexican chicken
