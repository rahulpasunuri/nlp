I absolutely loved this recipe! The cupcakes were the best I've ever had. I used half whole wheat flour and also substituted the white chocolate chips with bittersweet chocolate chips. I added a home made vanilla frosting to them to top it off. They were a huge hit!

The whole family loved these. I omitted the white chocolate chips because I didn't have them in the house and doubt if they are necessary at all. I think the brown sugar gives it enough of a sweet taste. I also use my juicer to juice carrots when I have a recipe like this that calls for grated carrots. I drink the juice and use the pulp left over for the recipe. It's less work and no waste!
