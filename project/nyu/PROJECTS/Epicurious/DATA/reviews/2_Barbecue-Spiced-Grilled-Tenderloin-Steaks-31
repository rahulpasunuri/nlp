not very interesting when made as written. Absolutely needs salt, which is not mentioned. I used a similar recipe with the addition of coarse sea salt and ground coriander instead of allspice, and thought it was much tastier.

This was dreadful. The allspice totally overpowered the flavour of the meat. I will not try it again, and do not recommend it unless you really, really, love allspice, even more than tenderloin!

the all spice ruined the flavor of the steak. i would definetly not try this recipe again.

This is a very easy recipe but the result is just okay. I didn't think the rub had much zip! I'd make it again only for a quick and different twist on a filet.

My family really enjoyed this but felt it was missing something. The next weekend we made it again but used a little less all-spice and mixed all the seasonings in melted butter and fresh garlic beffore brushing it onto the steak.

I thought the flavor of the rub completely overtook any flavor the meat itself had, plus the rub was too sweet. I wouldn't try it again.

Tried the recipe on thickcut prork chops as recommended by another reviewer. followed recipe as above, the chops were juicey but the taste was nothing to brag about. I'll stick with olive oil, garlic and Italian Herbs with a little sprinkle of coursely ground black pepper.

This is a great way to serve filets. It is hard to believe something so easy would be so good!! I will make this again soon!

In made this rub with the intentions of using on steak but instead used it on thick boneless pork chops, once in a grill pan and once on the grill. I have never had more jucier and more flavorful chops before.
