I tried this last night with no modifications other than adding a little crushed red pepper, black pepper, and salt. I didn't find it bland like other reviewers, I thought the flavors were basic, but delicious. Think of it more like a warm pasta salad than a hearty pasta dish and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

I agree with the previous reviewer. This was more bland than I had expected. It was relatively easy and I had all the ingredients, but the final results were not worth it.

Pretty much the only reason I would make this again is for the Omega-3 benefit. I didn't have capers. Even so, it was quite bland and uninteresting. Perhaps a better dressing other than olive oil and lemon juice would help. I sauted a couple of chopped tomatoes to add interest, esp. since I didn't have capers.

We have been trying to get sardines into our diet for the omega-3 benefits - this was an excellent way to use them, especially on a warm summer night. We used very little oil on the fish, and it worked well. If you've never had sardines, you'll like them in this dish.
