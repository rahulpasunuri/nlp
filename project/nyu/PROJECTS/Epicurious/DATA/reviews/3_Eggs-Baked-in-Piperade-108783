This was good but needs a little improvement to be great. I didn't have any onions on hand so I doubled the peppers and garlic. I baked the eggs for 10 minutes but the yolks were set completely, so next time I'll start with 7 minutes and see how they are. I agree this should be served with some nice bread to soak up the yolks and juices. I imagine this would be very tasty with fresh parsley and you could substitute zucchini or mushrooms for the peppers. I very nice, fast breakfast!

New twist on a breakfast or brunch eggs dish. I used one red and one green bell pepper, and substituted fontina for feta (mixed half in with the vegetables, sprinkled the other half on top before baking) as suggested by other reviewers. "Crusty bread" is a must on the side, to sop up the runny yolk-veggie mixture! Recipe halves easily for two. Will definitely be making this again and again.

One of our favorite recipes from Gourmet, quick and delicious, and a good vegetarian option. We've often substitute a green or yellow pepper for one of the red to add color or change the flavor slightly. We've also discovered, accidentally, that if you make this with diced tomatoes in sauce (rather than juice) you get a slightly richer, more roasted flavor. My husband and I like it both ways!

really not very tasty. i upped the garlic, paprika, added salt and even some red wine, and still not great. i had another recipe once (i can't find) which was much better -- i think the eggs were hard boiled and introduced at plating, and the red peppers were just thinly sliced, not diced.

I like this recipe a lot. I had something similar recently in a Portuguese restaurant, and they "kicked it up" with some chunks of linquinca (sp?) sausage.

I made this as a last minute potluck meal. It was quick and easy, but didn't blow me away. Other people seemed to like it, I found it a bit bland. I thikn next time i'll add more garlic, more hot paprika and maybe a dash of nutmeg? or a splash of red wine? it definately needs something.

A good gruyere really sets this dish off and I, like others, add the cheese before cooking. To keep the eggs from becoming tough, bake in a tray with boiling water.

I served this over grilled italian bread with bibb lettuce salad on the side, both of which I would recommend. I also added the feta with a few minutes left in the cooking time to melt it somewhat, which was good, and sprinkled it with chopped parsley, which brightened up the colors and flavors. However, in the end, I thought the baked eggs were not as tender and creamy as poached, and I wouldn't make it again.

This is the first time I ever tried making any type of baked eggs,and I amazed myself. They're not only foolproof,they're deeelicious. I halved the recipe{the kids were out}and added crushed red pepper,and sauted shrooms,but everything else was as is.I also served it with crisp bacon on the side. As they used to say "try it,you'll like it" thanks.

This was amazing-- it was better received than almost anything I have made in the last few months. Of course, I made some changes, as I always do. I knew that my husband would want potatoes, so I boiled some on the side, cut them up when they were tender (they were falling apart), salted them, and added them to the baking dish with the piperade. I also knew he would want a meat of some kind, so I cooked a chicken-spinach-and-feta sausage in the piperade after browning it in a separate frying pan. I just sliced it and added it to the mixture. I had halved the recipe, so I only used 4 eggs. I baked it until the eggs looked almost set. Then, I sprinkled it liberally with parmeggiano reggiano and broiled it until it was golden and bubbly. My husband was elated! I served it to him with buttered toast, and I think it could be dinner tonight as well!
