I've made this a few times using others' suggestions of reducing the sugar, adding fresh lemon juice, vanilla and Cointreau. It's always delicious. I just tried a new twist: simmering the compote with a couple of large pieces of fresh ginger, swapping the Cointreau for a little ginger liqueur, and adding a pinch of cardamom and about a half teaspoon of cinnamon. Yum! The tanginess of the rhubarb and the subtle heat of the ginger are a wonderful combination.

A CAUTIONARY TALE. I made it according to the recipe and it was so sweet that it hurt my teeth. Shame on me for not reading the reviews before I made it, but just in case someone else takes the recipe at face value--BE FOREWARNED. One can always add more sugar, but I've made two other batches of rhubarb to add to my original batch, and it's still too sweet.

OMGoodness this is good! I just made it, so easy, hasn't even cooled yet! I cut back the sugar to 1 cup and it is still very sweet! After it simmered for 7 minutes I broke the pieces up with a spoon. That's it! So simple and delicious! I think this would taste good on ice cream or cake and it is certainly good warm by itself! Making more right now as I'm going to share it with friends!

I too only used 1 cup of sugar, water, lemon juice, vanilla, and Cointreau. It was wonderful. I plated it with some puff pastry, fresh strawberries, and a small scoop of vanilla raspberry swirl frozen yogurt. It was light, fresh, and very yummy. My guests raved! I used the leftover sauce on Greek yogurt.

Excellent warm too!

I like this basic recipe but like others here, I modified it slightly. For 1.5 lbs of rhubarb, I use 1 cup sugar, 1/4 cup water, juice of half a lemon, a splash of vanilla extract and a splash of Cointreau. I bring it to a boil, then let it simmer for at least 20 minutes; we like our compote thick.

There are a lot more complicated recipes for rhubarb compote, but this one works well and is incredibly simple. I had 3 cups (3 sizable stalks) of rhubarb and used just under 3/4 cup of sugar. I also added a tablespoon of Cassis (black currant liquor) for color and additional sweetness. This is excellent over plain yogurt for breakfast.

This was soooo simple & quick! I had the rhubarb but not the recipe in front of me so I completely forgot about the lemon juice. But, calling on my experience I added a small bit of salt and then a couple pinches of kelp powder for iodine (since I use salt without it). Then because I'm not big on sugary tastes I only added 2/3rds of a cup of sugar and I'm glad as it was plenty sweet that way (maybe if I'd added lemon it would be different). I could not believe how yummy this was and ate a cup just as is out of the pot, still warm, before starting to experiment. It was sublime with a few drops of balsamic vinegar. Next I'll try champagne vinegar. I ate it with vinho verde wine and resisted the urge to just pour them together. I think this would make a great base for adding all kinds of other fruits, especially apple, berries of all kinds, and pit fruits such as plums or peaches. I did add a bunch of cinnamon to my second serving and that was great. I imagine a cobbler of some sort with lots of crunchy oat topping would be delicious if I could save enough of it to get to that point. I'll also try adding some vanilla and lime juice at some point.

Simple recipe, and easy to make. I like less sweetening so used only 1c sugar. Served with lemon almond scones at brunch.

Good use for rhubarb. I used this as a type of jam for toast. Agree that it doesn't need so much sugar.

I only had two cups of rhubarb, and highly skeptical children, so I made half a recipe and used it to top a vanilla pudding filled pie shell. Rave reviews (and the children may be willing to try more adventurous rhubarb recipes in the future)

Great! I never liked rhubarb until now. I used orange rind and juice instead of the lemon and a cup of honey instead of the sugar (but added just a small sprinkle of sugar).

I combined this recipe with the one from April 2005. 6 cups rhubarb, 1 1/4 cup sugar, 2 tbl lemon juice, 1/3 cup water and I added a splash of vanilla extract. Boiled then simmered for 20 minutes etc. It is awesome!

This recipe is plenty sweet with only one cup of sugar. It's also downright delicious. Try serving it with a spoonful of sheep's milk yogurt for a delicious and healthy dessert/snack/meal - I could eat this all day every day.

Delicious. Agree with cutting sugar to 1 cup. Topped with creme anglaise for dessert.

At a local farmer's market I saw the most beautiful rhubarb stalks and could not resist. This recipe is simple and worked out well. As a dessert atop Tillamook's Vanilla Bean I had self proclaimed "I hate rhubarb"-ers asking for seconds, and thirds! Magnifique!

Never cooked rhubarb before -- turned out great! Used less sugar than asked for (just over 1 cup) and only 1T. of lemon juice. Will follow directions exactly next time -- but for a first run, turned out superb!!!

EXCELLENT! you can cut the sugar down to 1 cup without any harm. Great with a big dollop of Greek yogurt.

This was fan-TAB-ulous! I made it for dessert for a dinner party and served it with brioche french toast and buttermilk sorbet. Everyone raved! I made it the day before and it didn't discolour at all (I was worried about it turning brown). It was so easy and had a beautiful colour. My husband and I were eating the leftovers with a spoon the day after!!!

Delicious and ridiculously easy. Wonderful over vanilla ice cream. I'm officially no longer intimidated by rhubarb.

Even better, add grated orange zest and a little juice instead of the lemon.

Fabulous way to take advantage of this underused fruit. Spread some pastry cream on puff pastry and then add the compote on top and you have a delicious, elegant dish.
