To vinegary. Maybe it's the use of apple cider vinegar. Better pickle recipes out there.

Ok, I know that the title of these pickles states that these pickles are "slightly sweet", but I found these to be extremely sweet. I didn't take the advice of fellow reviewers and halve the sugar content. I will next time. I will also cool the brine before adding to the cucumbers. In my opinion pouring boiling brine over the cucumbers defeats the purpose of making a refrigerator pickle.

Great recipe, easy for someone without canning experience. I substituted rice vinegar, reduced the suger by 1/2, added garlic and ramps.

This are great! Only ended up with one cucumber plant this year, so needed a quick pickle recipe. This one is easy and delicious! We prefer dill pickles to b&b or the typical fridge pickle. I left out the fresh dill and used the cider vinegar. This recipe is also very consistent in the flavor that you get.

these were great! everyone raved about them. i followed the instructions almost exactly but used dried dill(i didnt have fresh dill or seeds). next time i will buy fresh as i didn't think it was dilly enough for me. i may add some slivered garlic next time too

Wow! These pickles are easy to make, stay crunchy, and are absolutely delicious! The combination of the sweet and sour with the spices is outstanding! I am growing my own pickling cucumbers, and I know I will be making these again and again! My family loves them, too!

Made these pickles for a 4th of July barbeque. Had a table full of food, and all anyone could talk about was the pickles! Very easy to make, and taste fabulous. I have a feeling I'll be making them once a week for the rest of the summer.
