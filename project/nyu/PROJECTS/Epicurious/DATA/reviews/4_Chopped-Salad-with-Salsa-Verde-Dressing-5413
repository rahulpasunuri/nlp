My friend brough this salad to a Fourth of July dinner last summer. Was perfect for the hot weather down in Savannah, GA and a very unique, lovely salad.

Great recipe! I use red cabbage instead of green (adds nice color) and add a can of drained/rinsed pinto beans. I also serve chicken fajita meat on the side to make this a more "substantial" meal. I always get compliments on this dish!

I love this salad--especially the dressing! It's very light & refreshing and has a nice kick (though I usually add some more jalapeno than the recipe suggests). I've made the recipe as written a few times and loved it, and tonight I made the dressing for a salad of chopped red-leaf lettuce, avocado, corn and mango and it was fantastic--I might even prefer it that way, even though the recipe is also great as written.

This was great, as all the other reviews said! Only substitution I made was that I used goat cheese instead of feta because I had it on hand. It nicely "melted" a bit into the salad and dressing, making it slightly creamy which was nice. Served it with some roasted salmon with chili powder on it.

This is definitely a great recipe. The only alterations I make after having made it several times, is to reduce the amount of oil to 3- 4 tablespoons, and add a little more pepper to the dressing (I used 3- 4 Thai hot chili peppers once and it turned out great--I love it a little spicy). A real winner!

This is refreshing and very healthy, but rather boring. We added a lot more corn and avocado than suggested by the recipe and the dressing, though refreshing, seems to be lacking something. The tortilla chips are a must. Don't think we'll make this again.

Yum! This salad was fantastic and I will definitely be making it again. Fresh, crisp, light yet satisfying--and the dressing is so good! I served it at a party and everyone loved it! I did add more jalapeno and a pinch of red pepper flakes--I thought it needed a little extra kick. I also couldn't find the jicama and the salad was fine without it (though I'll prob. add it next time if I can get it since I do like it). Other than that, no chages!

This was great. So healthy and refreshing and tastes so good. Even my carnivorous husband ate it and didn't miss the meat. I added a can of black beans and that was good too.

We enjoyed this salad with grilled scallops and shrimp. I used thawed-out frozen corn because fresh really isn't in season just yet.

This salad has an unusual blend of flavors...but I really liked it!! I can see how the tortilla chips would only add to the mix, however I didn't have any. Next time I'll use them. The crumbled feta really complemented the tanginess of the salad. This recipe makes A LOT of salad.

This salad was so good! What made it even better was I was able to use my Toss & Chop. It made it so much easier to chop all of the veggies, and it was fun!

I made this for a birthday party brunch and got raves! People loved the dressing and the variety of ingredients made it interesting. Didn't change a thing!

This may be the most versatile recipe I've ever made. I've substituted parseley, dried chiles, chives, kohlrabi, cucumber, goat cheese, you name it! It always comes out amazing.

Made this last night and it is a good as all the reviews. I would use less lime next time but otherwise the recipes is great as is. I subbed frozen corn and didn't buy jicama. The tortilla chips are a must.

Delicious. Served in fried flour tortilla bowl, without the chips. Made a great presentation for my Mexican themed dinner...and you can eat the bowl!

Because I made Santa Fe Potato salad with hominy from this site (absolutely delicious) for the same meal, I omitted the corn. Also I had no avocado or jicama so left those out. Even so, the rest of the ingredients in the unusual dressing combined to create a pleasing Southwest taste that complements South of the Border entrees well. Unfortunately I substituted a little Scotch bonnet for the jalapeno; the dressing was firecracker hot. However, I KNOW with the proper pepper, the dressing would be sensational. The feta is essential to calm the heat.

this salad is fantastic. instead of romaine, i made it with butter lettuce. this gave the entire salad a wonderful creamy flavor and soft texture that balanced well with the cripsy cabbage. i think it would also be great tossed with fresh crab meat.

i'm a true salad hound and this was among the best salads i've made. didn't use the chips, but included everything else. that person who didn't like this recipe must've made it wrong.

By far the worst salad I have ever had...so bland and no taste at all despite all the delicious ingredients. I am so disappointed as the ratings are usually dead on.

This is a great salad--delicious with the Southwestern chicken w/lime & ancho sauce from this site...try it on tacos...yum!

I've never had a salad be so raved about! Wonderful!

So yummy!! This is my favorite salad. One mod I regularly make is to substitute queso fresco for the feta. Baked chips work just dandy.

Next time I'll omit the jicama and use a little less lime juice. Otherwise, it was really delicious.

This salad is very good!!! I didn't use Jicama and I cut the lime to 4 TBSP (less tangy). Everyone who has tried it loved it!!

This one of my favorite salads. Every variation I've made has been good. I sometimes add shredded roast chicken for a complete meal. Frozen sweet corn works as well as fresh. Rice vinegar also worked well when I didn't have any limes around. Once I prepared itthe salad to take to a picnic so I decided to add the avocado cubes and jicama to the dressing before leaving to keep them from discoloring. The usually bland jicama absorbed some of the dressing and was delicious, so now I always marinade it for about 1 hour beforehand. Also, my jaws had cramps from chewing so much crunchy stuff, so after the first time I reduced the amount of cabbage and shredded it instead of chopping it.

I love this salad---yummmm!! My husband (who is kind of a picky eater) even had seconds, which wowed me! It is very tangy and light tasting. We didn't use the jicama or avocado and it was great!

This salad was great! I did not use any avocados or jicama and it was still delicious. I made the dressing the night before to let the flavors blend. I made it for a family get together and everyone loved it.

The reviews convinced me to try this salad. I made it, 1/2 at a time, to go with two dinners, which was the perfect amount for my family of 4. We thought the texture was better if the corn(Green Giant canned), feta and cabbage sat together for at least 15 min. before adding the tomato and lettuce. I used avocado the first time and not the second (didn't have any) and didn't miss it. Jicama is crunchy and relatively bland so I didn't buy any. The dressing sits well for at least 3 days in the refrigerator. I loved this salad with the tortilla chips! Thanks everyone!

Made this recipe for family dinner the other night and everyone totally loved it. It could serve as a complete meal on its own. A suggestions....make the dressing the day before to allow the flavors to blend. The best salad I've made and will make many times more!!!!!

Wonderful!!! Could be a summer meal by itself with some crusty bread. I left out the avocado (was overripe) didn't miss it. This sald and dressing can be made ahead of time, and just add the romaine and dressing before serving.

This is a GREAT recipe!! Very tangy and fresh. I have made this recipe a couple of times because it is quick and different. Alterations I have made: Frozen corn in place of fresh corn. Use pre-packaged chopped broccoli/mix (looks like coleslaw) in place of the red cabbage.
