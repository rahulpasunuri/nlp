I feel bad throwing out all the veggies, anyone have a recipe idea that could use all the leftovers? Looking forward to making this soon...

Complex, fragrant, delicious; I hope that it will freeze well as one should make a big batch for the trouble and $$$!

The sauce is fantastic! I loved it. It is super easy to make (just a little time consuming), though well worth it. The stock is one of the best I've made (and tasted). I am going to make the stock from this and store it away because it is so far superior to any other stocks.
