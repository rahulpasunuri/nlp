I ended up marinating the steaks for several days (sudden change in weather and plans). Perhaps this contributed to an overly heavy Worcestershire flavor... But I found that Worcestershire taste to be most incompatible with the generally spicy Mexican flavors in the rub itself. Thanks goodness I only grilled some of the steaks this way. The remainder I will grill without adding the rub -- and save the rub for another day.

This was FANTASTIC! I used Negra Modelo and some yummy Starbucks coffee we had at the house and it was totally worth it! I followed the recipe almost exactly but I didn't have pure chile powder so I did 1/4 tsp of cumin instead of the 1 tsp. Served with the Potato Gratin with white cheddar on this site (SO DELICIOUS)!

I only marinated the steaks (using Guiness beer) for about 3 hours, and made the rub as stated. It was a tad spicy but my 7 year old son ate it all. The steaks were very juicy and flavorful, but I can't say they were somthing I would make again. Certainly not worth the cost of a fancy Mexican beer, much less Guiness. It was good, but not a make-again in my house.
