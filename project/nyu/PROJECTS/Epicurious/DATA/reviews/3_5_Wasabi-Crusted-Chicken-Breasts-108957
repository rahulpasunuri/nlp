My husband loves taste of wasabi so this naturally caught my eye. Turns out my son loves it as well. This is a keeper. An easy recipe with a lot of flavor. I do go heavy on the wasabi paste and skip using the powder. As many other reviewers say, the powder loses it's kick during cooking. But the paste is great. I usually serve this with an appetizer of pot stickers to give it an Asian feel along with bread and a green veggie or salad. My husband has requested this for tonights dinner.

Yummy! This was so good I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I put the wasabi powder directly on the chicken like previously suggested and I could still barely taste it. The only other change I made was to use vermouth instead of sake as I couldn't find my bottle of sake.

Roll in wasabi powder first, both sides and double the amount in the breadcrumbs. This will ensure that you can taste it, which is what we wanted to do! Made the teriyaki sauce from reduced sake, + brown sugar + soy sauce. Added cilantro instead of green onions. Gotta do these things in Moscow when some ingredients can't be found, such as bottled teriyaki and on that shopping day, scallions!

I like this recipe and have made it with even greater success with a few modifications: more oil for a more fried taste (it's really delicious, trust me). Rather than use eggs to get the crumbs to adhere, mix mayonnaise, a little water and wasabi paste and dip the chicken in that. For the dipping sauce, I have used a bottled sauce that is out of this world: Wasabiyaki sauce from Soy Vey. Very good.

I have made this recipe many times and it is a hit with my family and friends. I have read the other reviews and have adapted. I rub the wasabi powder on the chicken breasts before I put it them in the egg, then in put them in the panko. I saute the breasts, then put them in the oven, drizzeled with the teriyaki sauce at 350, covered, for about 20 minutes. The end result is a moist, delicious chicken dish. A family favorite.

I'm glad to see that others found that the wasabi lost its kick. I wish I had read these reviews before making the dish! I will definitely try smearing the breasts with wasabi paste before dredging in egg & then the breadcrumbs. I bet that will be delicious. This is still an awesome dish, though. The sauce is wonderful-I'm not sure that I would add wasabi to it as someone did b/c it has such a nice flavor on its own.

Found an easy workaround to the tasteless wasabi problem: leave the powder off the chicken breasts and simply incorporate it into the sauce! I made a paste from the powder and then dissolved it directly into the sauce. Wonderful flavor, and no need to use heaps of powder with no result!

We found the wasabi powder lost its kick during cooking, so we used an extra tablespoon of powder than was called for in the breading mixture, we added a couple of tablespoons of the powder to the egg mixture, and we turned some more of the powder into a thick paste and spread a layer of the paste over one side of each breast before dipping in the egg. It was not nearly as spicy as you would expect, but it had a wonderful flavor. And pretty easy to prepare. We served it with snow peas sauteed in sesame oil and olive oil. A fantastic meal - everyone raved!

fiddle with it like everyone else. Use about half a can of wasabi! Also substitute cruhed Rice Krispies for the panko. Yummy. We call it "Mammogram Chicken" at our house.

This is a great way to eat chicken! I made it for my family and they loved it! I would suggest doubling the sauce. It ads a great zip to your chicken and it is great on rice. The wasabi did not pop out as a noticable flavor. Overall we enjoyed our meal and I would make it again.

Nothing special. Tasted like chicken schnitzel.

This was fantastic, but still could not taste Wasabi in spite of coating the chicken in paste and adding powder to the panko. Maybe it just does not stand up well to heat. Regardless, this was a delicious weeknight dinner. Served with steamed rice and sauteed garlic spinach dressed with sesame oil. Hubby got up in the middle of the night to eat the leftovers. Next time, I would double the sauce.

I used Wasabi paste and couldn't taste it either. I'll make it again following the cook from Tokyo's suggestion of coating the chicken in wasabi.

I spread wasabi paste over the breats before dipping in egg, and panko. It gives a nice kick of heat, and everyone loves them, they freeze well.

This is one of my favorite meals. Although you can't taste the wasabi (i will try it wet next time as suggested by another review), the sake is a great touch.

Without the wasabi it becomes just another tonkatsu-style cutlet. Not bad, but nothing special.

This recipe is awesome with Sea bass! I substituted Mirin for Saki and used olive oil instead of peanut oil. My husband loves it too and it is so quick and easy - any white fish will work and you don't have to pound anything! Regarding the wasabi - I agree, no distinct taste. I may try it without the wasabi next time. Also, shared recipe with friend who used it on sea scallops and also had rave reviews.

Of course, the panko makes a nice and crispy chicken, but the wasabi cannot be tasted, even with extreme addage. Therefore, I suggest that omitting it, perhaps serving on the side as one cook did. Or making fried chicken. I mean, what's the point of using (wasting) your wasabi if you can't taste it.

Rating: 3
Great recipe. However no matter how much wasabi paste (6 teaspoons) I added, I still can't taste it. How much wasabi did you use to make it tasty? I'm contemplating adding Chinese spicy mustard powder to enhance the flavor next time.

Rating: 4
Loved this! I am a sauce freak, so I used 1/2 cup teriyaki, 1/2 cup saki and 1/2 cup of chicken broth and let it simmer with the remaining bread crumbs. Instead of green onions, didn't have on hand, I used red onion, which was great!

My husband and I REALLY enjoyed this one. True that you really can't detect the wasabi in the crust, but I served it with a dab of wasabi on the plate to mix into the sauce. The panko gave it a great crunch and the sauce is a perfectly sweet compliment to the spicy wasabi. I served with steamed broccoli & pea pods...this will be regular dish for us!

I made the wasabi in a paste and mixed with the eggs. Still not spicy enough, but they were good. Served with rice and stirfried garlic/red chili flakes/sesame seed spinach. The left over breasts have been recruited as sandwiches for luches. With wasabi Mayo of course. Next time I will just coat the brests in paste. The 2 gluutons wolfed them down and even liked the spinach.

As suggested, I wet the wasabi powder and put it in the egg mixture, and it makes signifigent flavor for this dish. I also used wine instead of sake. This was an extremely easy and delicious meal. This recipe is a keeper!

Based on my experience with wasabi powder, it needs to be WET to have an impact. Adding more dry wasabi powder won't help. Mix the powder with water, let it sit for about 10-15 min and then wisk into the egg mixture or the sauce.

Like other reviewers, I doubled the wasabi and still no "kick." Still, it is quite tasty. Double the sauce; it is great and you will want more. Will make without the wasabi next time since it doesn't add anything.

I made this for the second time with chicken tenders. Delicious! After reading about the weak wasabi flavor, I pretty much doubled the amount called for, including mixing some in with the beaten eggs. I doubled the sauce as well. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe should just be called "panko crusted chicken breasts" because no matter how much wasabi is added, it can never really be tasted in the final product. Although that aspect is disappointing, I will keep this recipe because coating in panko is a great way to fry chicken and the dipping sauce was a nice addition.

Astoria: Take the wasabi powder you have and add water. Voila! Wasabi paste.

I just can't quite get this recipe to work, though it has potential. I tried wasabi sauce instead of powder to up the flavor after reading the other reviews, but even that wasn't quite enough, and I can't locate wasabi paste anywhere. I'm considering grinding up wasabi peas for breading. Any suggestions?

This recipe was a great disappointment to me. I love to cook with wasabi and use wasabi powder to make sauces that I usually serve with tuna. But using the same wasabi powder in this recipe did not give anywhere near the same kind of kick. I used extra wasabi and did make the paste before coating with Panko, but we couldn't taste it at all. I might make this recipe again without the wasabi because the panko did make a nice crust and the sauce was very good.

Will make again since it's a nice weeknight meal, but will definitely increase amt of wasabi powder (like others.) I made more sauce--quarter cup of teriyaki, and a third cup each of wine and chicken broth. Deglazed pan and reduced it, threw in a cornstarch slurry to thicken up. Served with mashed celery root/potato and sauteed greens.

Ok. Maybe it's just me but I don't see what all the hype is about this recipe. I did the wasabi paste rub before dipping in egg/panko and drizzling with sauce. I mean, it was good, but nothing I'd want to serve to guests. No "sparkle", nothing for people to go `Wow' over. [you want to try the Chinese 5-spice chicken w/lime dipping sauce if you want to wow `em.] Won't make it again.

We love this one! I tried the same method and ingredients but with salmon which was delicious too. I have made it each time with two chicken breasts, but left all the other ingredients at the same amounts.

First attempt: I made this dish as written and my family liked it, however the wasabi was really not noticable. Second attempt: I made the chicken without the wasabi. Instead I made a thinned-down version of the dip from the "Asparagus with Wasabi-Mayonnaise Dip" (also from this web site) and drizzled that sauce alongside the drizzled teriyaki sauce. The two drizzled sauces looked beautiful on the chicken and made the second attempt at this dish wonderful. Garnished with a few black sesame seeds and it was wonderful and beautiful!

This was OUTSTANDING! Very easy to make and yet so flavorful. Because I read some reviews about increasing the amount of wasabi... I used wasabi paste instead of powder. The paste is stronger and I used 4 teaspoons as instructed. It was perfect! I also thickened the sauce with a bit of cornstarch and chicken broth at the end. It made a beautiful glaze. I also added toasted sesame seeds as some reviewer suggested. This is a keeper!

I agree with A Cook on 12/14/03,in that wasabi dry does not give the taste necessary. I would also like to add to that the fact that some manufacturers substitute horseradish for true wasabi. This gives a much milder powder. Be sure the wasabi you buy is authentic.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. Simple to make and turns out delicious. Luckily I read the other reviews and added more wasabi than the recipe calls for. I doubled the wasabi, but next time I will add even more for more of a kick. I also followed a reviewer's suggestion and did the wasabi rub before dipping in egg, then the the Panko. I will definitely be making this again!

I didn't read the reviews before making this - a big mistake. Next time I will double the wasabi for flavor because the outcome with the panko and sauce was outstanding. I will also use low sodium teriyaki next time because as is was a little too salty. I served this with basmati rice and Warm Baby Spinach and Mushroom Salad with Ponzu Dressing.

I made exactly as directed and also did not detect any spiciness. I'm afraid to reverse the dipping process (panko then egg) as several reviews recommended because I'm having a hard time picturing the texture and flavor being the same (wouldn't you end up having a distinctly fried egg look and flavor?). Maybe instead of switching the dipping process, I'll add the wasabi to the egg mixture instead of to the panko mixture. I like the idea of the wasabi rub as one reader suggested. Maybe I'll try that technique. I thought the sauce needed a little something more, but couldn't put my finger on it. It was very good.

Rating: 2
After reading the reviews, I increased the wasabi by 50% and put that increase directly onto the chicken in a saki/wasabi rub before using the egg. We also could not taste the wasabi. The dipping sauce also seemed bland. Because I like wasabi I will try the recipe and adjust one more time.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and made the wasabi paste, which I rubbed on the chicken before dipping in egg. I was afraid that it would be harder for the egg and panko to adhere, but it was actually quite the opposite. It was exactly the right amount of spice and the flavor was great. Thoroughly enjoyed by all!

Thanks to everyone who made comments before I made this! I used the recommended recipe, but added some wasabi paste made with some sake and put it on the chicken before the egg dip. I also toasted some sesame seeds and added them to the sauce. Excellent flavor and very easy to make!

I agree with the cook regarding wasabi. It must be activated with water. Don't buy the premix in the tube. It has no flavor. And double the wasabi.

I just love panko crumbs! The crispiness they add just can't be matched. Although we really enjoyed the dish as written, I think this recipe could use more wasabi - it wasn't quite as strong as I would have liked. Also, I did add a bit of honey to the dipping sauce, it really improved the balance of flavor. Maybe next time I'll throw in a little crushed red pepper to really jazz things up.

Using wasabi dry doesn't result in much flavor. It should be bloomed in a little liquid first to let the heat and flavor develop (sake or water). For this recipe I would probably spread wasabi paste onto the chicken breasts, then dip in egg and panko. That way you would have spicy flavor and still have a crispy crumb coating.

I would make this again, but I would definitely add more wasabit powder somewhere. We could barely taste it. My husband said, "there's wasabi in this?" Maybe I would play with the sauce and add some there to give it a bigger kick. I made twice the sauce and thickened it with some cornstarch mixed with a little broth at the end. Served it with homemade vegetable fried rice and pre-packaged eggrolls. I really liked the crust the panko gave it.
