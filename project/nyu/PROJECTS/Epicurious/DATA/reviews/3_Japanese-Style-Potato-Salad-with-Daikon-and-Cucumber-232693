I made this on labor day as a side to tuna burgers with wasabi mayo. The chopping takes a while, but the dish is no problem to make. At first taste, my husband and I were both surprised at the strong flavor (not bad, just strong). The acids in the dressing really come through, almost like a german potato salad. Very enjoyable.
