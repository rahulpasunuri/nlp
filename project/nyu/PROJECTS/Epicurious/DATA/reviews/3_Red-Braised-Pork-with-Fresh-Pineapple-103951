This recipe has possibilities but we found it needs a stronger flavor. Next time we'll reduce the amount of water and increase the spices.

Delicious and easy sweet-and-savoury dish. The only mistake I made was using too much orange peel (which I used instead of the tangerine) resulting in a slightly bitter taste. Otherwise very tasty. I served it with cauliflower with ginger and mustard seeds from Gourmet, a nice combination.

We found this dish to be rather disappointing and bland. If I make it again I would cut the pork into much smaller pieces and would add hot oil to jazz it up a bit.

we enjoyed this dish. very different. BUT it was time-consuming! i've never made pork butt before and wow... is it fatty!!! it took me an hour to trim it(ok, maybe i'm a little obsessive). after that, it wasn't too hard. maybe i'll try it again with a less fatty cut of pork.
