Way too spicy for my kids. I thought it had a little kick to it, but overall it didn't do anything for me.

I made this and after the first bite did that whole, Neil Diamond, "Sweet Caroline" fist pump in the air, "so good, so good, so good!" Easy, different, healthy (I say yes to coconut milk). Yum.

This sounds as if it would be stunning but it's not. I followed the recipe exactly. It's not worth the effort.

This was a really nice salad on a warm summer day. I doubled the shrimp and wish I had upped the red curry paste -- it needed a little extra heat. The dressing, in particular, was delicious.

Really, really good. I did tinker with the dressing a bit...wasn't nuts about heavy balsamic in this at all, so made another batch using red wine vinegar and lemon. But, the rest of the flavors came together very well. I got a thumbs up from my boyfriend, and will definitely make it again.

I totally agree with the cook from Oregon -- the ingredients were an odd combination and did not work well together at all. I loved the shrimp cooked in the coconut milk and curry sauce though, and will definitely prepare it again, served over rice.

I made exactly as recipe and it didn't live up to its reviews. The shrimp cooked in the coconut milk and curry sauce was very good, the pesto was at best a misfit with the rest of the ingredients. Would have been better off putting the shrimp on a bed of Jasmine rice and serving a nice Thai cabbage salad on the side.

This is a great light meal. I made it almost verbatim. I don't know if I'll use balsamic vinegar next time though. It gave it a strange color. I think maybe lime juice might be better. The family really liked this.

I have made this recipe many, many, many times and everytime it is a hit. I like that you can make it ahead of time and assemble just before serving. Try it. You'll love it.

this salad was just right. I wouldn't change a thing. I served this at a Thai themed dinner party and everyone loved it.

This is probably one of my all time favorite recipes. I have made it again and again and no one ever gets tired of it. However, follow the recipe; one time I tried to use non-fat coconut milk and it was too runny.

This salad is light and flavorful. We added a bit more cilantro and used sambal oelek instead of the red curry, which we didn't have [and would use more next time] but this was a great, light salad. We used lowfat coconut milk and poured a bit onto the salad to give a hint of coconut with the dressing. We will make this one again....

I loved this, my husband just liked it. I used Thai basil instead of regular (better flavor) and baby spinach instead of sliced bok choy (the supermarket didn't have it), and I added some sliced cucumber to thegreens mixture and some toasted shredded coconut to the simmering shrimp. Easy and impressive--I'd make it again.

A wonderful recipe -- can be made ahead and assembled prior to the meal. I used half shrimp and half scallaps. I ommited the macadamia nuts and sprinkled toasted, chopped peanuts on top of the shrimp. I used Thai basil for the pesto sauce --fantastic. I let the shrimp marinate in the sauce overnight(doubled the curry paste, added more lemon grass and reduced the sauce for a few minutes) and it was excellent. If you choose to do this you must take care to remove and cool the shrimp and sauce separately so they will not overcook. I'll make it again for sure.

This is a perfect light summer recipe. I doubled the amount of red curry paste but it was just spicey enough. I had some homemade pesto in the fridge so I simply added the Balsamic vinegar--superb. The dressing would be great on any salad.

Thanks so much for this recipe!! I searched your site for a first course for a Thai dinner party we had. It was delicious and made a beautiful presentation. Everyone loved it. Next time I make it, I will add a little extra red curry paste to the shrimp for a little extra spice!

I simmered shrimp and chicken thighs in separate pans in the coconut milk with 1 tsp., not 1 Tbls. of curry. Both were delicious. The macadamia nuts have less flavor than pine nuts and I will make this pesto again using pine nuts with 1 garlic clove, 2 Tbsp of balsamic or maybe lime juice. Thai rice sticks are wonderful and with less greenery underneath and more noodles, this would have been much more to most of my family's taste. The shrimp, noodles, and greens were very good together. Okay, my husband loved it as served.

This was a light, delicious recipe. The only change I made was to use pine nuts in the pesto instead of the macadamia mainly because it's what I had on hand and they worked perfectly. I especially liked the idea that everything could be made ahead and then actually put together at the last minute which is nice if serving for guests. My husband and I both loved the flavors. My kids (10 and 22 years old) weren't home, but I can't wait to make this for them....I already know they will love it!
