Question: is any kneading required between the first and second rising?

Rating: 1
The recipe did not yield good loaves. They did not rise, and the consistency was rubbery. I bake bread twice per week, and was stunned at such poor results. I did use whole wheat bread flour and am attributing it to that. Will try again.

About how much sponge (ie. cups) is made. I have a lot left over from a previous bread I was making, was wondering how much is needed/used?

This had a great flavor, and the bread had a very soft inside with a nice crust. Making it again this weekend for my in-laws :) The only thing was that my loaves didn't have large holes like Ciabatta is supposed to have. It's possible that was my fault - any tips?

This recipe was very easy and oh so delicious! I am a novice bread maker, but this came out great! I was making it to go with a pasta dinner, so I added some seasoning to the dough and to the top of it, and it was a big hit! Love it!

Made this bread for the first time and LOVED it! DIdn't have a baking stone so I just used a cookie sheet with parchment and it worked well. No problems with texture using bread flour and I am a beginner :)

I tried this recipe when it first came out. I have since discovered the issue with the texture that most bakers are complaining about. Bread flour have way too much gluten to produce successful results for the average baker. CookIllustrated magazine has the best method/technique and recipe. I now make their recipe every 3-4 days. outstanding. Sponge day prior, no oil, mixed w/kitchenaid paddle, then hook. rise 1 hr, then 1/2 hr 2X w/vigorous folding to activate gluten slightly--bubble galore and crispy crust. worth paying for the site just for this recipe but the mag is worth $24 every year!!

My comments are not meant to diminish the Ciabatta recipe from Epicurious. In fact I will give it a try. I have been using a no knead ciabatta recipe for a couple of months; and, it is wonderful - a sponge is not required. It is dead simple - great for the kids to make. I have included a link that you can copy and paste into your browser: http://foodwishes.blogspot.com/search/label/Breads I have changed up the recipe with 2 1/2 parts unbleached white flour to 1/2 part Kamut flour (ancient grain) or whole wheat. The bread reminds of Old World breads - rustic, crusty and airy. Also, I bake "No Knead Breads" at 500F or 450F on convection setting. I use a 1" X 22" X 17" pebbled granite baking stone that I had made to measure by a local stone cutter (only $50 cdn). This is a steal at twice the price. It produces a beautiful product. Try the "No Knead Recipe", it's worth it. Veritastm

Flavor is good, but I've made it twice now, and the texture isn't right. Comes out too dense, not full of the random sized bubbles I'd expect in ciabatta. There is essentially no spring when you put it in the oven. I know ciabatta is supposed to be a little flat, but this dough rises out instead of up

ok, what gives with this? - I've read all the reviews, I live at a normal elevation and I followed the recipe EXACTLY - twice as a matter of fact ... I have made yeast bread before but never with a 'sponge' so I'm not sure what the texture of that is supposed to be. The first time I made this the bread did not rise - AT ALL - so I didn't attempt to even bake it. Thought maybe it was the yeast, even though it was new and had a good date, Bought more yeast, tried again, sponge looked the same (this never rose or got bubbly,and both times I was constantly checking the water temperatures to make sure I didn't kill the yeast). The second time it rose a little on the first rise - after well over 2 hours - and rose even less on the second rise - it turned out like a brick - it was horrible .. I really want this to work, but now I'm looking for a different recipe .. ultimately compared to what else I'm seeing I have to question the amount of yeast/flour - should I have not added it as written, but done so gradually? my dough was never 'sticky' ... i'm very bummed ..

The dough was too soft - very difficult to form even after trying to work more flour into it. The texture was great, taste was average . . . would not make this recipe again because of the amount of time invested for an average product.

I enjoy making bread and when the results are better than what I can buy, that's a bonus. This recipe produces delicious bread. Crust and crumb were perfect.

This is not the tough and chewy type of ciabatta you might be used. I found the outer crust nice and crispy and the inside surprisingly tender. Makes good crostini/ toasts too.

Rating: 3
This is my favorite Ciabatta recipe! I also purchased unglazed quarry tiles at my local home improvment store for 39 cents each...much cheaper than investing in a stone. Since the dough is so soft, I don't divide it into 2 loaves, I just do 1 larger loaf...much easier to work with. This is the best Ciabatta and not too much work.

I make this bread frequently, and it never fails. It keeps better than most home baked breads and can be served the next day without a dip in taste. I have added chopped green olives, chopped black olives, herbs, asiago cheese, and pimento with stunning reslts. Just remember to drain the liquids from your add-ins or a touch more flour to compensate. Parchment is a must for success in my book! And you can line out 4 terra cotta floor tiles from Home Depot if you don't have a pizza stone. They cost 39cents each...or less! Bella!

This bread was so simple to make (besides having the wits about me to plan one day ahead). I'm not sure what the problem was with the dough rising... yes, the dough was very sticky, but it baked up fine. We make this bread all the time. So few ingredients and no kneading!!!

Very Good Bread

Excellent! I kneaded by hand, so perhaps added 1/2 tablespoon or so more flour and added 1/4 tsp sugar to the biga. Loved the results and taste.

This is a great sandwich bread. I am curious what happened to the cook from Florida. The dough is definitely sticky but once it was formed into a loaf it rose nicely and backed up great.

Zulu6@bellsouth.net-This is very good Ciabatta. To those who had trouble....the dough is VERY wet and Sticky. Knead in a machine. Be sure to "fold" the dough after each rise. For the final rise put it on a Peel (piza Thing) coated with corn meal. it is easier to transfer!! But it's GREAT

I often make bread but never had a recipe turn out so poorly. The dough was too soft to salvage and I could not work with it.

A total disaster for one who often makes bread. The dough was too soft after the second rise and I could not salvage it.

Rating: 2
This was challenging and only OK. It was so soft and wet after the second rise that I could not transfer it to the baking stone without completely deflating it. I tried again and let it rise on parchment paper, which I then placed on the stone to bake. This worked a bit better but the bread still didn't rise in the middle and the flavor was good but nothing to get excited about.

Wow - this is the best bread I have ever made. I fudged a little on the rise time because I was in a hurry by putting the bread on top of a warm stove and it still turned out great. I too used King Arthur's bread flour - very tasty. I think I will try to work in some whole-wheat flour into the bread dough (not the sponge) next time to add fiber and make it a bit more healthy.

This "sponge" was like nothing I've ever worked with, however, the ciabatta turned out great (thanks to a little coaching from Dee from NY)! I am now starting a sourdough starter . . . Boo Hoo Atkins-alholics!

Very good. I used bread flour for the sponge, but substituted 1 cup whole wheat later. Also, I ran out of parchment so I used waxed paper. This bread is good with soup, salad or even with homemade jam on top!

This was simple but yielded wonderful results. I made this for someone who can only eat unbleached, nonbromated flour (can't have bread in restaurants) using King Arthur flour. It was fabulous warm and dipped in olive oil and practically brought her to tears.

Two thumbs up! Resisting my instincts, I followed the recipe exactly and the bread came out with a nice light brown crust, a tender crumb, and wonderful texture. My wife and I gobbled it up dipping it in olive oil seasoned with salt and garlic. We are at a fairly high altitude (3750 feet) and often need to modify recipes for baked goods. This one worked fine as written.

Has many steps but is simple to make. I don't have a mixer so I mixed by hand--no problem. My pizza stone is small so I baked 1 at a time & reduced the baking time for each.Really delicious and appreciated by our neighbors. Best fresh out of the oven.

This bread is wonderful. As a previous reviewer suggested, the wetter the dough, the better the bread. Everyone I've served this to is so impressed that I made the bread myself. I even had a cousin (from Italy) ask for the recipe.

What I did, I don't know. The bread would not rise. I used fresh yeast, a thermometer, and followed all the directions (With the exception of using a bread mixer). I'll try again today.

Yum... My new regular bread recipe. I love store bought Ciabatta and didn't think I could recreate it. I was able to and it was better than store bought :)

Rating: 4
Great recipe- one word of advice, though- add the flour slowly, I added too quickly the first time around and the dough was too stiff, making the bread not have as nice of a texture as a wetter dough. The next time my sponge only held 1.5 cups of flour for a sticky dough.

This takes a little time to make. But it is worth the time. It is good with any meal, we have it with homade chili.

My wife and I often challenge each other to cooking contests and she challenged me to a "bake off" knowing that I had never made bread (and made only one cake which was a disaster). I pulled these loaves out of the oven and served them with an olive oil dipping plate (virgin oil and pepper oil) just like the fancy Italian restaurants and won the contest hands down! The hard crust with the soft inside was scrumptious.

I normally dislike breads that I have to start preparing the day before, but this bread is a great exception. It was easy to make and the result was a great light bread. It is indeed more sticky than I expected at first.

This bread was wonderful! and easy to make, I would wait to flour the top of the loaves until after I removed the dampened dishtowel, right before putting the loaves in the oven. The towel absorbed most of the flour.

This was a wonderful bread! The crust was nice and crispy, and the inside was moist and chewy. And it wasn't that hard to make. I would definitely make it again. It's a good bread for dunking in a sauce.

Excellent bread! I make as dough in my bread maching, and bake in the oven. I also vary the bread by using the flour for the sponge as the different flour.

I have been baking breads weekly for five years and this as good as what I normaly bake. Very little flour makes two large real soft and moist loaves. Just follow the recipe. Thanks Skiper
