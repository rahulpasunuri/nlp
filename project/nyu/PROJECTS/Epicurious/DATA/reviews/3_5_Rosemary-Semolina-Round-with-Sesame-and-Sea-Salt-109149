I love this! I just got back from Italy and am totally psyched to do some Italian-inspired baking. This rosemary-semolina loaf was just right. I rolled it into two rounds instead of one, so I'd have one to give away and one to keep. I also forgot to score the final proofed loaf before baking, but it came out just fine. Delicious crunchy crust with soft pillowy but dense crumb inside.

I have made this many times and it is always unbelievable. Bakery-like bread at home. It is a little time consuming, but a real crowd pleaser!

The bread turned out very good and tasty and looked elegant but it was kind of time consuming to make. It's one I'd make again, but only for a special dinner.

Excellent bread. I too made it into two rounds rather than as a ring.

I have made this so many times in the short time since the recipe was published and it never fails to be great. It is easy as printed but easier when I do the kneading in my Kitchenaid. It looks impressive and tastes just as good as it looks. My only change to the recipe is a little less salt.

Just for fun, I baked this bread in a Bundt pan sprayed with vegetable oil spray and sprinkled with sesame seeds. It didn't have the chewy/crispy crust that baking in the open would have given it, but it otherwise came out very well.

I made this bread the way the recipe was written the first time. The second time I decided to put all the ingredients in my bread machine on the dough only cycle (in the order the manufacurer suggests) and let 'er rip. Then I formed the round loaf, let it rise the second time and baked it. It was just as delicious as it was the first time and a whole lot easier!

Really good dinner bread. I served this with marinated, grilled chicken and a cool cous cous salad. I changed the procedure a little. After the sponge sits for the 45 minutes, I put it on my kitchenaid attached with a dough hook and then slowly added the rest of the ingredients--no need to do two separate mixing bowls. I did almost all the kneading with the machine and just finished kneading by hand for the last minute or so. I found that I only needed about 45 minutes on the second rise and 30 minutes on the third rise. Easy and delicious.

This bread was surprisingly easy, has a good crumb and a wonderful flavor. I didn't make it in a round but made 2 free form loaves and froze one. Terrific with soup. Definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe for my husband a few weeks ago. He loved it. It was a fairly straight forward recipe, it tasted great and it also looked very impressive. I'll certainly make it again for a dinner in the near future.

Looked like the photo, complimented dinner well, goat cheese stuffed chicken and mesclun salad. Have made again to go with soup. Yummy.

This recipe went together very easily and the finished product was "photo worthy". While it tasted good, it just wasn't great enough to make it to the keep file. So, while we wouldn't make it again, it was still a fun and tasty project to try once.
