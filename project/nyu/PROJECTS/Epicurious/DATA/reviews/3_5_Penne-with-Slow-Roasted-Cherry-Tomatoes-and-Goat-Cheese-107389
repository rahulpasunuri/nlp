I added black olives and a bit of red pepper flakes and it was delicious.

An incredibly tasty, easy, summer dish that showcases sugar sweet locally grown cherry tomatoes. It's important to use the sweetest tomatoes you can find. I used a combination of yellow sun gold tomatoes and another sweet red variety. The contrast of the sweet tomatoes and the slight tang of the goat cheese was perfect. I also added a bit of my favorite grilled chipotle lime chicken cut up. This will become a summer staple for our family. Everyone loved it!

Very easy and delicious. Whether made with homegrown cherry tomatoes or purchased, it was very flavourful. The last time I made this I roasted on the oven's convection setting, with great results.

This was fine but nothing special - it just seemed to be missing something. I love roasted tomatoes but I much prefer them in a simple salad with mozzarella to this. I may make this again, but will try to spice it up a little more!

My husband just came in to thank me AGAIN for making such an incredible dinner tonite. I added a few shakes of crused red pepper and garlic powder to the tomatoes before roasting. I thought adding pine nuts on top at the end would be good too. I dumped the water without thinking...but just added more olive oil when tossing instead and it was FAB! Yummy and so good for you too!

I just made this tonight. The cheese quantity was perfect. I disagree with earlier reviews. I added roasted asparagus to the roasted tomatoes for more substance and flavor, which was amazing. I also sauteed a shallot and two garlic cloves in the olive oil before mixing it in. I couldn't really tell if it added much. It's definitely a mild dish, in need of some salt. I used grape tomatoes from Trader Joe's - small and sweet (they also need only an hour to roast). Only drawback -- lots of pans for a weeknight meal but yummy.

This is a pleasant dish. The cutting of the tomatoes in two, drizzling of olive oil etc...takes half an hour, than the roasting took one hour and a half, the rest five minutes. My 6 year old liked it, but my three year old didn't care for the tomatoes. My husband thanked me for it. A pleasant meal, something different for dinner, nothing to write home about though.

Wow! This is my week to try new recipes, and this one really shines. The tomatoes require more time than I typically have for a weekday dinner, but the rest is soooooo easy. Winter in Milwaukee is not the time for nice tomatoes (understatement), and I used anemic grape tomatoes (all the store had that were small), and it's still really good. I can't wait to make this with fresh from the garden cherry tomatoes next summer! Use a nice fresh goat cheese, and don't change a thing.

Another quick, easy and delicious side dish or meal.

I've made this several times and I just love the sweet tomatoes that are offset by the tangy goat cheese. I picked this out of Sara's book but glad to see it on here too.

Only thing I did differently was to roast the tomatoes for 1 hour, instead of 2. Nice and creamy dish, simple to prepare, would definitely make again.

I thought this was fantastic. But there's also a lot you could to to the recipe because it's pretty straightforward and could handle a lot of modifications, such as meats, extra vegetables, and different pastas.

I halved the recipe and made it for dinner for 2. It sure is cheesy! I added some black olives. Next time, I would cut down on the cheese and put some parmesan on the table. The tomatoes were indeed the best part. Very easy weekday meal. Liked it, didn't love it. My partner thought that anchovies would spice it up (but he's a huge salt fiend). I might like some arugula.

The sweetness of the tomatoes against the goat cheese and basil is just amazing. Even more amazing is just how easy this is to prepare, even though you have to be patient while the tomatoes roast.

I'm a big fan of Sarah Moulton and all the ingredients. But this didn't do it for me. I used long spaghetti since I had no penne on hand. I ended up adding fresh pesto to make it moist. The goat cheese made it too heavy and dry for my liking. I was surprised, frankly. Should have been fabulous.

Excellent recipe! Tried using grape, cherry, and roma tomatoes. Grape tomatoes too small, shorten the roasting time to 1 hour. Roma tomatoes slice thin 1/4-1/2 inch and roast for 2 hours. We thought the roma tomatoes were too big...but the flavor was good. Dinner guests kept sneaking away with the roasted jewels before dinner was served. And yes, make plenty they go well atop sugar snap peas as well.

Outstanding! But don't try to refrigerate it & eat it later.

Simple and elegant. Everyone cleaned their plates! I threw a head of garlic into the ovenas well while the tomatoes were roasting. If you haven't roasted garlic, just cut off the very top of the head, place it in a 6 x 6 inch piece of foil, drizzle some olive oil over it, salt and pepper, and twist the foil at the top to seal it. It usually takes about 30 minutes to roast garlic, in a 350 oven, but it will take longer since this dish requires lower heat. When it's done, cool it and squeeze out the garlic into the ready made pasta. It is absolutely delicious! I think I'll try toasted pinenuts as well next time!

not so much salt......25 shavings of parmesan reggiano (sp) will replace the goat cheese nicely. Lots of frsh garden herbs, a bit of the boil water and a drizzle of the best quality balsamic from modena. I personally like the mint, basil and marjoram combo. Very earthy and sunday night satisfying.

We loved this pasta, though I made some changes because my husband does not like goat cheese. I used feta because that's what we had on hand. After adding the ingredients I also added a couple of tablespoons of parmesan. The idea of adding the cooking water makes it perfect. Also, we already had made the slow roasted tomatoes from this site so it was rather quick to put together. The tomatoes are always in the fridge. They are the best part of any recipe. Love them.
