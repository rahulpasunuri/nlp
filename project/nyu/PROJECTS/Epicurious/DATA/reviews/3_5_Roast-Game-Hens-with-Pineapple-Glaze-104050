To add a little more flavor I added some ginger. My family loves this dish.

Really simple but really delicious. I usually don't like sweet mustard sauce, however this sauce reduces down to sweet and sour magic.

I made this dish last night for dinner. All of us hated it. The pineapple sauce was to watery to consider it glaze and it tasted very bland.

I really would have given this a two fork, but my husband liked it so much that I figured I'd post his rating of 3 forks. The recipe just didn't stand out as anything that terrific to me. But I'm willing to try it again, maybe altering a few things.

I made per instructions and it came out wonderfully. I would like a crisper outer skin so I might increase temp or broil briefly, very juicy. I also tranferred pineapple glaze to roasting pan and simmered that way than strained through collander and served in dipping cups. very good!

I made this exactly per the recipe, and my family really enjoyed this. I didn't use the extra leftover sauce, just basted every 15 minutes till done. Very tender, very flavorful. Served it with buttered broccoli and cranberry/almond rice. Will definitely make this again. This is the first time I've made cornish hens for my family, although I've made them for clients before.

This is a very nice dish, easy to fix and tasty. Next time, however, I'll cut the maple syrup a bit and add a little dark vinegar (I agree with another reviewer that the overall effect is a bit too sweet).

This was delicious! Next time we will puree the glaze as the little chunks of pineapple were a little different. Served with garlic mashed potatoes, great company dish.

My husband loved this. I used frozen pineapple from Trader Joe's, I used 4 oz. for 2 servings. and crushed it in thw blender. I used powdered mustard because I only had garlic mustard, this worked fine. I pre-heated oven 425 to get crisper skin on hens,we like this better.

I found the mixture of pineapple and maple syrup to be too sickly sweet for the 'game' flavour of the hen. The look of crushed pineapple on the hens was not appealing at all--I won't make this dish again.

EXCELLENT! EASY!!! With ingredients you have on hand! I simmered the sauce while the birds were cooking and basted with it as it reduced. After birds were finished, skimmed fat off and added pan drippings, then hit it with a blender stick to smooth out. With some fluffy jasmine rice, outstanding. And I agree with the reviewer who thought it a little odd to be bird watching prior to this dish....but, to each his/her own, that's what makes this country so GREAT!

DELICIOUS! THE PINEAPPLE GLAZE WAS WONDERFUL.

I thought this was a great recipe to make again. I used 3 whole hens and had plenty of sauce. I used a little more pineapple than was called for, and it was terrific. I thickened the sauce right in the pan it cooked in also. (after skimming)

So-so. Based upon the reviews of others, I expected something more. However, I will try this again at some point simply because I might have done something wrong that messed up the dish.

A beautiful dish to serve to company. It looks best with the cornish hens, but is also nice with chicken pieces or boneless breasts.

This was awesome! A little messy to eat, but worth it. I put hens in a metal pan that easily transported to stove top after the hens were done. Then I proceeded to skim fat off pan juices and add pineapple mixture to pan juices instead of the other way around(as it says in the recipe.)

Is it just me or does the woman that likes to bird watch and then devour sweet little game hens is missing her calling: get a shotgun and blast away

I made this for Christmas dinner and it turned out very well. It is really easy and tasty. I like the combinations of the sweet and salty flavors. Nice combo and a nice holiday dish. Aloha from Maui.

We used a whole chicken instead of the game hens and it turned out great. The skin is to die for.

It was very delicious. I would make it again. I used a low sodium soy sauce but had to add a little salt to the glaze. The only problem I had was there were no leftovers.
