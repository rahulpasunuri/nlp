I was looking for a salmon recipe and had both mustard greens and new potatoes, so I thought I'd give this a try. After reading the reviews I tinkered with the sauce, and my girlfriend pronounced it the best salmon she'd ever had. Here's what I'd recommend: start with 1/4 cup mustard, the juice of 1 lemon, and 1 tbsp. of oil, then take it from there to suit yourself. I added dried tarragon (I didn't have fresh dill) and only 1 tbsp. of sugar. You might want more sugar or oil depending on your taste, but make the glaze to suit yourself -- there's nothing sacred about the proportions.

I tasted the sauce before using it and found it to be a bit too sweet, so I took another reviewer's suggestion and added lemon juice (2 tbsp). The sauce complemented the salmon and potatoes nicely, but I found it to be still too sweet for the mustard greens. Next time I make this, I'll use half as much sauce on the greens.

I made this with honey instead of brown sugar and thinned the sauce with 2 tablespoons of water and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. I also substituted steamed asparagus for the mustard greens. Everyone enjoyed it.

Yum! Will definitely make this one again.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this did NOT work for us. I think there's too much brown sugar in it. But the potatoes were good. I'm sure there are way better glazed salmon recipes on this site.

This was a perfect Monday night meal: straightforward, simple and satisfying. The savory-sweet flavors are likely crowd-pleasers. Still, I think this recipe could be improved with a little help from the spice rack. I'd like to try it with cumin and orange, or thyme in place of the dill. Punchier spices would offset the sweet mustard glaze's cloying tendencies, and could even dress this dish up for more glamorous days of the week.

Extremely easy and very good. I used Splenda Brown Sugar instead and it was just as yummy. I also used a little less oil as previously suggested. I did have to cook the Salmon longer..by by about 10 minutes.

Loved this...very easy and best with wild caught King or Spring Chinook and farm fresh mustard greens. Good thick salmon steaks do take a wee bit longer than stated in recipe, and I'd add a bit of chipotle and bacon to the greens to give it a bit more distinction. Asparagus would be wonderful too. I would definately make this for a gathering but my husband and I loved it for just the two of us. (Skip it if all you've got is the farm raised, color-added, flavorless mush!)

I LOVE this recipe!!!! I have been making it for years. I use spinach as a substitute for the other greens...frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed), and I throw them in underneath the salmon while it's cooking so it is truly a one dish meal! My kids will even eat the spinach when I make it this way!

This recipe uses way too much oil. The point of Salmon is that it is a fatty fish, and therefore adding this much vegetable oil to the recipe leaves something to be desired. I liked dill/mustard/brown sugar, but i would use perhaps 1/2 to 1/3 as much oil were I to do this again.

This was absolutely delightful. I didn't do the mustard greens so all the sauce went to the potatoes and salmon. And although the sauce was plentiful and flavourful, it did not overpower the salmon, it complemented it perfectly. Practically speaking, it was also nice to have most of the dinner prepared in the same dish!

Best salmon recipe I have ever made. The salmon remained extremely moist even though I cooked it for 25-30 mins. instead of 18 mins. Baked potatoes for 20-25 mins. intead of 18 mins. Sprinkled salmon and potatoes with Kosher salt and was a little more generous with the sauce on the salmon and potatoes and it was wonderful. Served with green beans instead of mustard greens. Presentation was lovely! My husband who is a non-fish lover simply couldn't get enough. Perfect dish to impress any dinner guest. Will make this dish over and over again. By far, the best salmon recipe ever!!!!

My husband and I really liked this dish. To get it on the table a little quicker, I left the potatoes whole and boiled them in boiling water while the oven preheated. Then I baked the now-soft potatoes with the salmon. I had to add about 10 minutes to the cooking time because the salmon was a bit too rare after only 18 minutes.

We made this for dinner tonight. The local market didn't have mustard greens so we subsituted spinach. I forgot to add the sugar. Even with those significant changes, dinner was great. The next time I would use a more spicey mustard and remember the sugar. I think that wuld move it to the four forks category!

This is a great dish. The one sauce used on the three main items (salmon, potatoes, greeens) takes on a different flavor with each. Great for company because it's mostly an oven meal, easy to prepare in advance, with some last minute greens preparation.

Can't even count how many times I've made this in the past 8 years. I must admit I have never once made the greens. I usually serve it with simple asparagus or brocolli. I've made it for two and up to twelve - always moist and beautiful. My newest epicurious find is Dave's Marinated Salmon which has an asian flavor.

The cooking times seemed very short and after 15 min alone and 18 min with the salmon, the potatoes were not done, and neither was the salmon. covering the dish in foil and cooking for an additional 15 minutes got everything cooked right. The mustard greens were very bitter, and i found the contrast with the sweet sauce to be rather cloying. i would not make this again.

Since it's summer, I'm trying to grill everything. I wrapped the potatoes with the dressing in foil and grilled it for about 50 minutes. During the last 15 minutes, I grilled the salmon, brushing it periodically with the dressing. The only thing I had to "cook" was the greens which only took a few minutes. A beautiful, delicious, ONE PAN meal!!

I've been making this regularly since it first appeared in 1995 Gourmet. It is the ultimate dinner party wow or sexy, special date meal (the guy will propose!). I've doubled and tripled the quantity with ease, though tend to increase the amount of mustard greens. Best with Atlantic (farm-raised) salmon and Yukon Gold potatoes.

The flavors are divine! I would steam the potatoes lightly first next time, and maybe the greens, but we loved it!

Wow! This recipe transformed a couple of potatoes, a pound of salmon, and a dollar's worth of greens into a gourmet dinner! This is bound to become one of my dinner party standbys. It's very easy to make and offers a great presentation.

We did not like this at all. The sauce overwhelmed the salmon, even when I reduced the amount of oil; I used fresh mustard greens from my garden and they too overwhelmed the salmon. I was disappointed since I usually like recipes that receive good ratings at this site. I used wild king salmon, not atlantic (I NEVER cook with atlantic salmon, I think it is horrid.)

I, too, only used about half of the necessary oil. And I substituted spinach for the mustard greens, per the recommendations of the other raters. This is such a simple recipe, and it's so, so tasty. I'll definately make it again.

I made this recipe using fillets of white fish (gurnard) rather than salmon. I just cooked the potatoes a little longer before popping the fish in and cooking it for about 10 minutes. It turned out great - and I loved the mustard greens, which I'd never tried before!

I have been making this recipe since it first appeared in the March 1995 magazine. It is simple yet delicious and elegant. I also skip the mustard greens and usually serve the salmon and potatoes with asparagus, peas or a green salad. If you want a lovely meal with very low stress, try this recipe.

A very easy, yet impressive dish. I cut the oil in half and skipped the mustard greens due to more tender taste buds. It was delicious and received rave reviews from friends.

Easy and fast (30 minutes), and uses ingredients that are all in season at the same time here in the Pacific Northwest. I cut the oil by half.

This is such a nice recipe that it's a shame to ruin it with such a bitter green as mustard. I ended up throwing the Mustard Greens out (and I'm a person who likes collard greens) and used the extra sauce as dressing for a spring green salad. I'd suggest substituting Kale or Spinach in the recipe, or doing a salad. You can also cut back on the brown sugar. 2 tbs is plenty sweet enough for me. Other than the mustard greens, it's a very tasty, healthful meal.
