I was very impressed with this combination of flavors. I took heed to the other reviews stating the dish was "bland" and was a bit more generous with the Thyme, salt and pepper and also used a Merlot instead of the sherry. I found it to be quite delightful and very flavorful.

This dish looked nice, but I was very disappointed in it. Not only was it bland - as other reviewers have already note - but it sat in my stomach like a rock! I'm all about eating seasonal foods, but there are much better ways to eat parsnips. Pass this recipe over.

I thought the taste and color of this dish was very bland. I won't make this dish again.

A great combo of flavors. The only thing I added were some leeks that I had in the refrig ( they were a nice flavor addition)and a sprinkle of dried thyme (the thyme in my garden at the end of summer seemed to be a bit lacking in punch. The blend of sweet and savory is great and I've come to really enjoy the blend of chicken, thyme and sherry flavors. The additon of parship and apples is also a plus. It's a great fall dish.

After reading the reviews, I thought perhaps this would be one of those dishes that turns out to be more than the sum of its parts. Unfortunately, it was not - it tasted fine, but was nothing spectacular. I might try it again, but I would have to add extra herbs and maybe other vegetables. Nothing about this popped - it was just okay. It was very quick and easy though - a good base recipe for an easy weeknight meal.

We get our parsnips from a wonderful farm in Dresden ME. This recipe jumped right out at me. It's so easy and so tasty. The sherry makes the difference. I wouldn't change a thing.

Very good! I didn't have the sherry, so I used red wine, but still a yummy and easy recipe and a good reason to use parsnips!
