I have my standard curried deviled eggs I make for parties and I thought I would try adding a new recipe. This recipe sounded a little odd to me but they were a bit hit at my recent holiday party. Side by side my guests could not decide with tasted better and was told by more than one guest I had to make both from now on! I did add about a teaspoon of garlic powder, half teaspoon of seasoning salt and used honey dijon mustard. I did this using 12 eggs.

Although I increased this recipe by 1 1/2, and did Not increase the amount of minced shallot, the shallot was still was overpowering and left a bitter aftertaste. In desperation I added some additional mustard, minced ham and sweet gherkin pickle, and let the stuffing sit overnight in the refrigerator. Those additions made the dish palatable. If you make this recipe, add a Tiny amount of minced shallot or subsitute minced onion. I much prefer the "ham and horseradish stuffed eggs" on this web site, which were delicious and required no doctoring.

Wonderful appetizer - love the flavor. This tastes better than any stuffed egg I have ever eaten - wouldn't change a thing.

My in-law's chickens are overly productive these days so I've been making these eggs for every occasion. I've had a great reaction every time. I think it's part of the 'Comfort Food' trend but these are light and lemony, a welcome change from the usual devilled eggs.

Good and easy to make. I used a little onion instead of a shallot and would suggest mincing it very finely. The tarragon was a nice mix with the egg.

I made this for a New Years Party and it was the hit of the night. I have already been requested to make them again and pass on the recipe. It was a nice change from my traditional curried stuffed eggs.

I added just a touch more lemon juice. These eggs have a wonderful "bright" flavor.
