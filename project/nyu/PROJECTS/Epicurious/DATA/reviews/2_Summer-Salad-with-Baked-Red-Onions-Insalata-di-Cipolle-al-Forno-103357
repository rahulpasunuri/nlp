I made this salad for a bring a dish summer party . I was traveling so I prepared it separately , dressing, eggs , onions and tomatoes all in separate bowls to mix together after arriving . When I added all ingredients it wasn't really an attractive dish, so needless to say, it wasn't popular with the guests. It tasted ok, and just ok, although I do like all of the ingredients in this salad. There was a lot leftover and the next day I tried it again and didn't like the way the flavors melded overnight. Too strong on anchovies . I threw it all away and so that's the reason for my 1 star. I would not try making it again.

Here are the tricks, used grilled tuna , I had leftover that had been pecan crusted, sliced very thin. Use anchovie paste and go easy. Added Dijon mustard to the dressing. Sliced, salt and peppered 2 'cados. Used the leftover mango salsa. Great
