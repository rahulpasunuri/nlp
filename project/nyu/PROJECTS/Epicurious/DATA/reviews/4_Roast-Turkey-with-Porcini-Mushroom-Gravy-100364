Have made this recipe every year since 1998! Always double the gravy recipe and eliminate the tomatoes. The herb butter can be made a day ahead. We stuff the turkey with the sausage, cranberry and pecan stuffing recipe found on this site. I do use a turkey bag as it cooks more evenly and tastes so moist!

This was the best gravy I have ever had. I don't even like gravy and this was stellar. We were even raving about how good the pan smelled as we were starting to wash it. I would definitely recommend making this recipe!!

the cooking time is way too long! Also cut a bit on butter and herbs if your turkey is smaller. As for the gravy I put a little to much mushrooms and they taste a lot so just be careful with the amount of mushroom. Other then that this was delicious!

I have made this turkey and gravy recipe for the past several years. It is excellent! I increase the ingredients to season a twenty-six pound turkey. All twenty of my Thanksgiving guests rave about this recipe. The first time that I made it the chopped tomatoes burned in the pan, even though I had stirred them as directed. Since that experience, I now always add broth to the roaster with the tomatoes and the turkey and gravy come out perfect.

This is by far the best turkey recipe. It always comes out moist and it's very difficult to mess up. I make it every Thanksgiving and there is never any left.

Fantastic. I had to cut down on the cooking time though. I needed about 40 minutes less for a 21 lb turkey.

This is hands-down the best turkey recipe. The most delicious gravy-double the recipe. Everyone I've made this for goes wild for it.

This recipe is fabulous--I have used it since it was first published. If you want extra thick gravy, make the gravy a day ahead--you won't believe how much it thickens up. Everyone who eats this turkey asks for the recipe. You will not go wrong!

WOW! The gravy was to die for. I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone was after the gravy. My recommendation for anyone making this recipe is to double it, because you will not have enough...it's that good!!

I made the gravy to accompany roast chicken rather than turkey. Simply outstanding! Likely the best mushroom gravy I have ever made! Served with garlic mashed potatoes swirled with caramelized onions, roasted carrots and parsnips sprinkled with brown sugar, and homemade cheesy cornbread. A hearty fall dinner that had my husband begging for more!

I've been making this recipe for Thanksgiving ever since it was first published in 1998. I'd like to branch out but I'm afraid no other recipe would be as good as this one! The turkey is moist and flavorful and the gravy is out of this world. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was so phenomeneal at home, that we organized a "family day" and invited all the family member and made it again. It is still a subject to talk about among them. One of the best recipes I ever cooked. Thanks, epicurious!..

It was my first time ever to cook a turkey and it turned out splendid. Turkey was moist and tasty.

I made only the mushroom gravy with the procuitto hazelnut turkey. But the gravy was excellent all by itself!

Wonderful recipe! I left my bird and became completely distracted and overcooked it by 15 degrees!!! I was close to tears, but we carved it and it was only slightly dry! I can't imagine how moist it would have been if I cooked it right! The flavors were wonderful ~ my friends and family highly recommend it.

This had to be the best turkey recipe I have ever made and the gravy was OUTSTANDING. Best of all, it's easy and people think you slaved all day.

It is easy and delicious! My family raved about it for days after Thanksgiving as well.

I just made this gravy last night for my 4th annual "pre-Thanksgiving" dinner for friends, and it was a WOW! Absolutely delicious and will now be my standard turkey gravy. Everyone raved about it and requested the recipe. I didn't use this recipe for the turkey, however, but did make the honey-brined recipe from this site, and it also gets 4 forks! Easy, delicious, moist, tender...everything you'd want in a perfect turkey.

Update... Ron (our host) made this Turkey for Easter.... Needless to say it was excellent. We begged him to add addional tomatoes to the pan while roasting. After the bird was done, we enjoyed the tomatoes on crusty bread with goat cheese and basil. Every guest was impressed with the flavor. He will always roast the extra tomatoes. Enjoy this dinner!

Excellent turkey and gravy. This was my first turkey, simple to follow recipie. Despite using non-salt broth the gravy tasted a little salty to me, could have been the wine flavoring. Everyone enjoyed.

This gravy is delicious. We try different recipes each Thanksgiving, but we ALWAYS use this gravy recipe. It is the best! But don't brine your turkey if you're going to make it - you'll get way-too-salty gravy. Make extra, and the day after Thanksgiving, put slices of turkey, and maybe some stuffing or potatoes and a little cranberry relish, over toast, and top with this gravy - divine comfort food.

I didn't make the turkey, just the gravy. The gravy was amazing. I used half an ounce of porcinis and half an ounce of mixed wild mushrooms and it came out great! I used vegetable broth instead. So good with polenta or mashed potatoes!

Great recipe, had lots of compliments - even received requests for dinner reservations if I would make this recipe again. I brined the turkey overnight and followed the recipe instructions from there. The turkey was moist and the gravy was very flavourful, but a little too salty even for my liking. The gravy needs more flour to thicken, around 3 Tbsp. Next time I will make my own broth and salt sparingly. The reduction time makes it very concentrated. Really worth the $ to get good Italian porcini.

This was the most popular gravy I have served at a holiday dinner. I reccommend to double the recipe. The recipe serves 10 comfortably, 12 if you ration, but who wants to ration! We ran short, causing a small rebellion. We served it at Thanksgiving. We will serve it again this year at Christmas Dinner.

For someone who can't make gravy, this is it. I've never followed a recipe for gravy, but decided to this Thanksgiving. It was simple. I didn't have to add anything after usually tasting my gravy over and over to make it just right. Would highly recommend. It's a godsend for the inexperienced cook who is nervous about gravy. Didn't try the turkey; cooked it as usual. Have done herbs under chicken skin at other times and it's great. So I might even try this method for turkey sometime. A must try.

This turkey is wonderful, but it's nothing compared to the gravy! I've made this for the past 2 Thanksgivings and now I cannot imagine making a turkey without it. I look forward to the holiday mainly for this gravy. A must try!

The Porcini Mushroom gravy was a huge hit. Very tasty. The turkey was fine, but this recipe is all about the gravy.

all my thanksgiving dinners with the same group of people were a blurr, this year the mushroom gravy woke everyone up and remains the only thing we remember from this meal, they all said they will come next year if i make it again, and i will.

ALERT TO VEGETARIANS looking for a brown gravy recipe for stuffing, mashed potatoes, etc.: look no more. Just substitute 6 cups vegetable stock for the 5 cups chicken stock/1 cup pan juices. We made this for Thanksgiving, and it was wonderful. Even our meat-loving friends asked for more!
