P.S., we don't use 12 cups of water, but rather 4 cups of stock.

Excellent recipe. Very tasty. A staple at our house. Epecially welcome and warming during cold weather. We generally use a mixture of lentils and brown rice.

As a professional chef for over 30 years, having both close ties to the Chinese community/culture and run two Chinese restaurants, I feel compelled to say this is not a good example of congee. In may be a suitable dish to appease vegetarians but it would be poorly received by anyone familiar with traditional congee.
