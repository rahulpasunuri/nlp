I thought this was excellent. I would definitely use more plums next time. I also used jalapeno jelly instead of plum jelly and that overtook the plum flavor a little. I would use half jalapeno jelly and half plum jam next time to give it that little kick. I think the spice is what made it really good and not overly sweet. This took a long time to make but once it was simmering, it didn't need a lot of attention. Pretty easy to do. You could also make this a day or two ahead and refrigerate it for a quick dinner sometime.

I also used extra plums (our neighbor gave me about 50 from her tree) and jalapeno jelly instead of plum jam, since that's what we had. That plus the dash of cayenne someone else used gave it a lovely, subtle heat that balanced out the sweet. And yes, we tried it with grilled shrimp and it rocked.

Not sure what went wrong here but there didn't seem to be the depth I was looking for. I used fresh plums right off our tree and high end vinegar but it seemed to lack direction and harmony.

I used red plums from our poor overladen tree, and I followed the advice of adding more of everything, I added more mustard, balsamic vinegar, plums and even a small dash of cayenne, since I am spicy hot freak. I cooked chicken in the sauce and it was outstanding. I am maybe thinking about trying shrimp next?

I gave this two forks because as is the recipe lacks, however, with a few adjustments its an amazing way to use up those excess plums (for those of you w/ a tree - you know what I mean:) I add some chinese five spice, chinese mustard instead of dijon and a slpash of red wine and most importantly, more plums. Delish!!

I used very ripe plums because I wanted the bbq sauce to be sweet. I followed the recipe pretty carefully, but my version came out extra thick. Call me defiant, but I decided to use the plum bbq sauce on spencer steaks. My girlfriend is Asian and I was hoping that she might enjoy this new treat. Anyway, I thought the sauce tasted almost OK. The only reason that I gave it two forks was because she gobbled it up and said it was delicious.
