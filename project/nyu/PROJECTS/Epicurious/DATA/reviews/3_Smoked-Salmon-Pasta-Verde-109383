It was easy enough to make. The sauce was tart but a good compliment to the saltiness of the smoked salmon. If I made it again, I might try some of the previous suggestions of adding mushrooms or tomatoes. Garlic sounds like a good addition, too.

Not good. the snap peas in particular don't blend well with the other flavors

After reading all the reviews, I wanted to try this dish and wanted to challenge myself. I took Trish's advice by adding mushrooms. I changed the recipe a tiny bit. I used crimini mushrooms instead of button mushrooms. Sauteed the crimini in olive oil and butter. I added shallots, pepper flakes, capers, salt and pepper to taste. Add the sugar snap peas, green onions, and chopped dill. Instead of fettucini, I used Barilla Plus Thin Spaghetti and added a little pasta water to the mushroom/shallots/green onions/capers/dill mixture. The sauce mixture, I followed the instructions up to reducing the wine by half. I added a little thyme to infuse some of the flavor and seasoned the sauce with salt and pepper once I added creme fraiche. Since I had left over smoked salmon purchased from Costco, I sliced it in bite size pieces and tossed in the pasta. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish and would make it again. I would like to see how I can thicken the sauce a bit.

I will say, this comes together quickly. It isn't terribly exciting, and none of the flavors are memorable. I'd like to find a better way to use smoked salmon in a weeknight dish.

Pretty good considering how fast you can throw this together. I unexpectedly received some smoked salmon and needed a recipe quick. You will easily have everything (or almost everything) in the fridge. Our family agreed that something is missing though. My husband thought carmelized onions would be a good addition. I would add fresh, sweet tomatoes.

Yummy. My friend sent me Alaskan smoked King salmon for Christmas. Instead of 4 oz, I used 8 oz, and of course, remove the skin. Instead of fettucini, I used 1/2 pkg of tri-color bow tie pasta. This made it easy to toss, and more colorful. Used sour cream and my 18 yr old son gobbled it up, but said the sauce was "a little sour". So I'll add a pinch of sugar for him next time. He had 2 portions.

It is an easy, quick pasta dish. The fresh herbs make it really flavorful. I agree with others comments that the sauce is thin. But, it works fine in this dish.. making it lighter (it's not super thick and creamy sauce) I added some crushed red pepper. Mushrooms would be a great addition along with some diced fresh red pepper for color.

This was a little bland, and also pretty bitter. I had to doctor it up quite a bit.

The dish was good, but the sauce was pretty bland. The amount of salmon was not proportionate with the amount of pasta - if you like smoked salmon, add more.

The first time we had this recipe we loved it, and I prepared it just as written - with creme fraiche. The next time I used sour cream and it did not compare, too sour!!

With a little creativity I made this dish my own- added mushrooms, used fresh crisp peas (no pods) and fresh spinach pasta from the local farmers market, and added fresh chopped basil. I also took note of the previous cooks and made the sauce in a 1:1 ratio of wine to lite sour cream, which was plenty thick. I think an abundance of fresh herbs is what made this dish a winner. I would cook it again- and invite guests!

Interesting combination, using edamame and smoked salmon, but just not tasty enough. Think there might be a better ingredient to add another dimension to this dish. All-in-all, simply bland.

Excellent healthy alternative to smoked salmon fettucine. I used edamame and light sour cream. the sauce does start out thin, however all you need to do is leave the completed dish on the stove top for two minutes or so on med-low and the sauce thickens up quickly. The initial thin sauce is valuable for moistening smoked salmon if it is a bit dry.

The combination of flavors could be a winner but I found the sauce to be a little watery. Luckily it was a hot day and we didn't to eat it piping hot. By the time we finished our salads the pasta had soaked up the sauce quite a bit. Next time I will reduce the wine down to half a cup and add twice the herbs.
