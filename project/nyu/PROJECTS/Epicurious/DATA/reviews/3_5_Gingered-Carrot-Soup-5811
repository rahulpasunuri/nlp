Great recipe. I would definitely make this again.

Turned out excellent. Only used half the OJ as other reviewers recommended and added an additional half cup of broth at the end to thin it out, but otherwise followed recipe exactly as written. This definitely has some heat because of the fresh ginger... I would only recommend this to those who like spicy food.

I omitted the ginger (kids can't stand heat) and substituted coconut milk for the half and half. I quite liked it and my kids loved it. One even took it to school in her lunch AND ate it.

I made this soup last night with a friend and we both really enjoyed it. We stuck to the recipe except for using low sodium veggie broth. We added a sprinkle of sea salt to taste. We both agreed it would be great with a topping of sour cream, but didn't have any to try it with. I would also halve the OJ next time like many other reviewers. I used fresh OJ with lots of pulp and found the OJ to be a little overpowering. Overall it was a great soup and I would make it again!

This recipe is amazing. I use the full amount of ginger and orange juice, this time using orange mango. The ginger if minced like garlic (really small) is not a problem. It also adds a bit of a kick when used in its full amount. I also used a bit of pumpkin spice to add a little nutmeg, etc. to the batch. Nice fall soup!

Very good!! I halved the oj as others did and then instead of cinnamon I used cumin and it was delicious, I just added it to taste and a little white pepper for some heat.

This is the first time I have ever rated an epicurious recipe @ "0" forks. Let's see...how to put this delicately...it SUCKED. In fact, it sucked in ways that were not previously considered feasible. I fully realize that others have reviewed this recipe with high marks, but this isn't my first rodeo. My wife wouldn't eat it, and I wouldn't even eat it to avoid the humiliation of having to admit that I'd made a mistake.

Yum. Was lucky enough to pull the carrots from the backyard. Stuck to the recipe and garnished with droplets of lime juice (something from a squash soup I used to make, don't stir them in). We had it as an appetizer but I wasn't alone in wanting to skip dinner and have more soup.

I am making this for thanksgiving now. I didn't have any trouble with ginger fibers, I used a mix of half carrots, 1/3 parsnip and one small rutabaga. (I doubled the recipe for my guest count of 12). I also added a pinch of fresh thyme, 2 cloves of garlic, 1/8 tsp orange zest and 1/8 cup of maple syrup instead of orange juice. I'll let you know how it tasted tomorrow!

to siobhan1000, haven't made this recipe yet (considering it for Thanksgiving) but thanks for your comment about the ginger root fibers; I think if you grate the ginger, that will help eliminate the fibers.

A really nice simple soup, I'm using this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving. I didn't add cream or milk, added 1/2 c only of orange juice, and took the suggestion of adding a sweet potato to the carrot mix. I'd also be happy with this soup for dinner, along with a sweet baguette and butter!

Rating: 4
I make this all the time for myself, and when I make it for guests they seem to really like it to. My modifications: Omit orange juice and cinnamon, and definitely cut the ginger in half (to 1/8 cup). If you are going to add cream (or even the tiniest bit of butter), don't add it to the main batch, put a splash into each serving right before you serve it. This soup also happens to freeze really well so if you have a pot large enough it is really easy to double the batch.

Rating: 3
Nice and gingery. I skipped the cinnamon, as I am not a fan. I halved the orange juice and took the advice of another reviewer of adding a sweet potato to the mix - good suggestion. I like a longer slower sauteeing time than the recipe calls for, to mellow the ginger and the onion before adding the stock. One query: I had trouble getting the ginger root fibers thoroughly blended, any tips?

I omitted the orange juice and cream and substituted 1/8 tsp. or so of fresh nutmeg for the cinnamon and added 1/8 tsp. of orange zest and 2 cloves of minced garlic with the onion. Warming, healthy and really good.

Pretty good - a solid carrot soup. I think 1/4 tsp cinnamon ends up being a little too much cinnamon, but maybe just my taste.

Rating: 3
This is really tasty and couldn't be easier to make. My only regret is that I was in a hurry and didn't read the reviews. I went with the full cup of orange juice and find the soup a bit on the sweet side, as some readers mentioned. Next time I'll taste as I go until I reach the desired sweetness and tang. This time around I also reduced the cinnamon and skipped the cream altogether, which I'll repeat next time. Overall a healthy, enjoyable recipe.

I LOVE this very easy recipe! I used fresh squeezed OJ and very little cream (only had very little!) and it was great. I have also added some sweet potato and a very small apple - Turned out great as well - a new favorite!

I used only 1/4 cup orange juice, which seemed just enough, and homemade chicken stock. Very good - will be making it again.

I made some changes to the recipe: One, I roasted the carrots, along with two apples beforehand. Two, I used light cream instead of half'n'half. Three, no onions, because I didn't have any, though I did put in a few cloves of roasted garlic. Four, I didn't puree it smooth. I left it a bit thick.

Rating: 4
I ENJOY A VERSION OF THIS RECIPE BUT I DO USE LESS GINGER AND LESS O.J.I USE THE JUICE OF A LARGE ORANGE. I SUGGEST YOU TASTE AS YOU GO. I ALSO SUBSTITUTE A DOLLOP OF LOW FAT GREEK YOGURT PER BOWL OF SOUP FOR THE HALF AND HALF, IT MAKES FOR A NICE PRESENTATION AND ADDS TARTNESS. I ALSO OCCASIONALLY ADD PARSNIP AND CELERY WHEN I ADD THE CARROTS FOR VARIETY.

Rating: 0
The cinnamon really ruined this soup by making it far too sweet tasting. It's just too much with the additional sweetness of orange juice.

Rating: 0
I tried this recipe and found also that it did need a bit of doctoring. A heavy cream for half the milk and half as much orange (I used fresh squeezed tangerine) and a few cheats from Sweet Dreams Soup helped to make this a comfy winter treat. A dinner for my wife and adult kids was well received.

Rating: 1
Turned out terrible. The orange juice overwhelmed the carrots. And a quarter cup ginger, that is a lot of ginger. But with the orange juice you couldn't even taste the ginger. Yuck, it was all poured down the drain. And I don't think I have ever done that before.

Rating: 3
This was easy and really delicious. Used heavy cream instead of half and half (it's what I had) - made it really rich. I was dubious of so much orange juice so only used 1/2 a cup - seems like the right call to me. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is excellent as-is. I garnish bowls of soup with some fresh-ground pepper and always get raves from my guests.

This was great on a rainy autumn night! I added 1 clove garlic to the onion and ginger, a little extra chicken broth, as recommended. But I added no cream or OJ. It really doen't need any extra richness or flavor. Just pureed and added some cumin and cinnamon, salt and pepper. Very delish, healthy, warming soup. served with grilled cheese.

Rating: 3
This easy to make recipe drew rave reviews from my family and our guest (who doesn't like veggies). He even requested the recipe! I had to add more chicken broth to thin the soup as it was a little to close in texture to baby food. I'll also use less OJ next time, and not bother to mince the onions-they get minced in the food processor.

Rating: 3
Delicious and healthy- it was great with a grilled swiss cheese sandwind and a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.

Rating: 4
I added sour cream and 2% milk instead of the half and half, as well as the zest and juice of one orange and the juice of one lemon. I really liked the tartness and complement it gave to the ginger and carrot flavors in the soup. I skipped the cinnamon (personal taste). Great!

Rating: 3
I really liked this recipe. I included green onion and garlic with the onion, halved the amount of ginger, squeezed in half an orange, and substituted cream for the half-and-half. I did not add any cinnamon. The soup turned out mellow and yummy. Would definitely make this again.

What a wonderful, healthy soup! The flavor was perfect and the color... amazing! Can't wait to share this recipe with friends!

This is a lovely soup, but I did make some changes (which bring it up to a 4-fork rating for me!) I added a clove of minced garlic to the onion stage, and used only 1 tbl of fat (butter.) I used a scant 1/2 tsp of grated orange zest instead of OJ, then for the half and half I used 1/4 cup of fat-free half and half and 1/4 cup of buttermilk. Virtually no fat and tastes better! The tartness of the buttermilk is perfect with this soup! Might try all buttermilk next time. Also, I used nutmeg (as previously suggested) in place of the cinnamon - fresh grated! YUM.

This soup warmed the belly in a country Australia autumn! A great accompaniment to this for a light supper is crusty pana di casa bread with ash chevre and a glass of NZ Sav Blanc--excellent!

I followed a previous note, and substituted nutmeg for the cinnamon; it was great! Caution: use less nutmeg than the amount of cinnamon the recipe originally called for. I also used nonfat 1/2 and 1/2 (Yes, an oxymoron!), and it worked just fine. Oh, and I eliminated the orange juice; the recipe really doesn't need it, with the substitution of nutmeg for cinnamon.

Rating: 2
This recipe is OK. I added more ginger like others (like 1/2 cup), that's nice for a really heartwarming soup. What I also added to bring out the flavour of the carrots and take away the acidity of the OJ is about 1T brown sugar. OJ usage only came out to 1/2C and a splash otherwise it's too overpowering. I threw in some chili paste (sambal)but that's going to vary in future according to my mood. the chilli does add a lovely kick to it. I can actually see where coconut milk would go nicely in place or mixed with the 1/2 & 1/2. This soup does have a lot of potential though based upon your preference.

Rating: 3
I like to sautee the onion & ginger in chili-infused olive oil for aditional heat. I also play with the quantities of onion & ginger, sometimes substituting onion for shallots. This freezes and rewarms really well. Like to serve with fresh vietnamese spring rolls

Rating: 2
The soup was good and the recipe is simple, but I didn't think it was remarkable in comparison to other recipes for carrot ginger soup. If I make it again I might use a little more ginger and I'll definitely use less orange juice. I thought the orange flavor was too prominent overall.

Rating: 2
This is a easy to follow recipe. Some changes I made are to add 2 bayleafs to the pot when simmering carrots to add a nice background flavour, make sure to take them out. Also to make a nice, smooth consistancy, strain soup, puree solids and add back in. I found that there wasn't enough ginger flavour so I grated extra ginger and squeezed the juice out into the soup. You could also add orange zest to bring out more of the orange flavour.

I have made this several times and results have been wonderful everytime, though I've tinkered with the recipe depending on quantities of ingredients we've had on hand... Now a staple on our regular winter menu at home!

Two forks as written, 3 forks with the changes suggested below. I also cut back on the OJ, didn't have enough fresh ginger so used some crystalized ginger. It was OK like that. But with the addition of a bit of peanut butter and a very small amount of sambal oelek (chili paste) it was outstanding!

Rating: 3
Good soup, easy to make. Definitely on the sweet side, the orange juice kind of overpowers the whole dish, but I love orange so it was fine with me. It wasn't gingery enough for my taste, maybe I'll add some more next time or cut down on the orange juice to make it less sweet.

Very tasty. I halved the amount of OJ-just eyeballed it. Also used nutmeg, as suggested by a previous reviewer, and added a touch of curry powder and some cayenne powder. The added heat was a nice touch. Served with a dollop of sour cream and garnished with chives. Will definitely make again!

This was very tasty and creamy and easy to make. I skipped the orange juice and liked the result. I used fresh young carrots from the farmer's market and think that helped--those crusty old things in the bag at the store lack flavor.

This soup was very delicious. My experience, regarding the OJ question, was that you should either use none at all, or the whole amount recommended - I thought that only adding a portion of the juice was unsatisfactory. I used butter instead of oil and nutmeg instead of cinammon, and used a vegetarian stock. It was a big hit at our dinner party.

Rating: 3
I wasn't sure how this would turn out after the mixed reviews - but I weigh in on the "this is an excellent recipe side." I used a few extra carrots, grated the ginger (I keep my fresh ginger in the freezer and then just peel a bit when i need it. Frozen ginger is easy to grate.) reduced the oil, used olive oil and 2% milk, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Simple and delicious. BTW, if you don't have a blender wand, go out and get one. It is the ONLY way to blend soups.

Rating: 3
I took the advice of half the oj. This soup was very nice; not too sweet, not too rich, and good ginger flavor. Must remember to mince ginger finer next time...the hand blender did not puree it as well as I would have wanted. I also added a pinch of cayenne. Will make again.

I fiddled with this pretty extensively: took out the OJ and half and half entirely, added 1/4 cup Grand Marnier, added a little more chicken stock in order to have enough liquid. Increased the ginger and added a little (1/2 tsp) cayenne. Spicy but not fiery. Great for winter.

The balance of this soup is completely wrong. There is no subtleness to it. The first batch made as per the recipe was binned. This soup has potential, so I shall try again using half the orange juice and only a teaspoon or so of the ginger.

Amazing! This soup had a wonderful balance of flavors and a great texture. Made for guests last night and everyone loved it! I did make changes based on others reviews, and found that I ended up with a superb soup. I used only 2 cups of broth, and instead of half and half, used 1/2 c lite coconut milk and 1/2 c whole milk. Also reduced OJ to 1/4 c fresh squeezed juice. I would reccommend thinning the soup out at the end with any of the liquids used (I just used the milk). Tried a sample with cinnamon, and did not like it. Instead, I garnished the soup with a light dusting of cumin. Perfect...can't wait to make again!

I found this a perfect way to use a number a carrots left in the refridgerator. A very healthy and tasty fall dish. But the amount of OJ was a little to much. I would suggest cutting down on the OJ to prevent the carrots and ginger taste from being mellowed too much.

Try substituting a can of coconut milk for the half and half. It complements the orange and ginger with a silky, buttery base. This recipe is the best kind: patience yields a sophisticated flavor.

Rating: 4
I made this soup 4 times now and it's fantastic. My husband and I love it. It's fine restaurant quality. The spiciness of the ginger is perfectly balanced by the sweetness of the orange juice. I recommend using fresh squeezed orange juice or Tropicana, i.e. not concentrated. The second time I tried to make the recipe lower fat by using skim milk and non-fat yogourt instead of half and half cream - don't it just tastes aweful. It does take 3 to 4 hours to make from start to finish, but worth the effort, and it's easy.

Rating: 1
I agree with the other cooks who rated this 1-2 forks. I was concerned that we prepared it incorrectly. After reading the remainder of the reviews, I realized the flaw was in the recipe, not us. The orange juice was so overpowering and remaining taste so bitter that we discarded the entire batch. I do not have a taste for hot OJ. I will conduct signficantly more research before using a recipe from this source. Horrible!

Rating: 4
Excellent. I've made this twice. Served it at a dinner party and it was loved by all, it was the only thing I didn't have leftovers of. I happen to have orange-pineapple juice on hand so I used that instead of straight OJ and I used just a sprinkle of cinnamon. Wonderful!

The recipe was so easy. The soup was even better the next day. I used shallots instead of the onions and used half the cinnamon and orange juice to really make the ginger come out. Yummy!

I made a few variations to the recipe and the soup came out fabulously. My mother-in-law had just made fresh chicken broth a few days earlier as we had all been down with the flu, so I used about 4 cups of the fresh broth which was sweeter and richer than canned broth. Then, instead of half & half, I used SKIM PLUS milk -- and made up for it by adding a dollop of creme fraiche and some chopped chives before serving. My husband gave it rave reviews, as did I!

Second time I've done this soup. This time I added a bit of brown sugar at the last to cut the salty taste. Soup is too salty even without added salt(from chicken stock). That, plus a tad more half and half toned it down. Nice and smooth. A dollop of yoghurt or light sour cream is a nice topping.

Rating: 3
i liked this recipe very much, and i have enjoyed the soup. i doubled the recipe but probably should have cut some of the ginger out. i also added less chicken stock than called for, substituting with vanilla soy milk which helped balance the spiciness. the soy milk added a little more sweetness, which i think the soup needed.

The soup is OK, but there are better recipes. All that orange juice is far from subtle. I used freshly ground nutmeg instead of the cinnamon, because I wanted less of a dessert taste. Actually, I guess, my rating should be 2 1/2 forks. (Note to Epicurious: why not half-forks?)

I found this soup to be very good. I added a teaspoon of honey and put only 1/8 cup of ginger. The soup came out with a delicious blend of flavors and the ginger did not overwhelm the other flavors. This soup is great for the health conscious and for those of us who are loosing their sight.
