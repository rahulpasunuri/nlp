I have made this recipe several times as a good do-ahead dessert. The recipe instructions make the brittle prep harder than necessary. Just melt any amount (I used 5-6 oz) top quality chocolate (I don't bother to chop it) in a pan over low heat (double boiler unnecessary). Spread onto a sheet of foil (no 9x13 pan required) and top w/almonds. It sets in 5 minutes. Store in the fridge and when cold, it peels right off. I found that 50 minutes cooking time was too long. 42 minutes was more like it. Also instead of re-heating the cake in the oven, I tossed the 3-4 slices into the microwave for 10-14 seconds. It was much easier and neater to serve when ready.

This recipe was delicious but I thought it was hard to make the brittle. I will most certainly make it again for my mother's dinner parties.
