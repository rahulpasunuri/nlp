I didn't follow the recipe, but kind of used it for inspiration for a week-night supper, and it came out great. I wrapped tilapia with the kataifi, as well as some scallops, drizzeled with butter & threw them in the oven. They came out great, though the tilapia is somewhat bland on it's own. For the next time I'll do the tilapia again, but will add a compound butter made w/ crab and lemon and parsley, which should add flavor. I also think the kataifi technique would work great for marinated & seared lamb chops, and then they could be wrapped with the kataifi before going in the oven to finish. Anyway, a good technique, easy & super fast, and flexible to adapt in different ways. I will try this again.

Excellent. The only change I made was I used 12 large scallops, but did not scale up the rest of the recipe. I thought 1/2 pound of butter would be plenty and it was.

I have served this as a first course for two different dinners and although I didn't have a source for kataifi the first time, it still got rave reviews. Second time around the scallops were prettier and I would say the kataifi is a better option than trying to shred your own phyllo. Great taste, easy to make and a show stopper

I made this last night for myself, my wife and my father. We all agreed that not only is it the best scallops we have ever had, it is literally one of the best THINGS we have ever eaten. I mean this recipe is an absolute SHOW-STOPPER. A few tips: You do NOT need 2 cups of balsamic. Even 1 cup is probably too much. Also, it took alot longer to reduce the balsamic...at least for me. I used the U-10 scallops and halved some and others I left whole (those are the huge ones). We all agreed that the halved ones were better...not to mention it gives you more food for your money. I used regular filo cut into strips...do not be stingy with the filo when wrapping the scallops. For the butter sauce, use 2 scallops and instead of adding an entire stick, just add a half stick. Trust me on that one. now stop reading and GO MAKE THIS NOW...TRUST ME!!!!!!

One of THE best dishes on Epicurious. I had on hand an already reduced balsamic 'cream' - used it succesfully. My scaallops were very large to begin with, so I cut them in half horizontally prior to wrapping in the kataifi. I thought 15 minutes in the oven was going to produce an overcooked scallop - I was wrong. Works out perfectly!

Made this for our Gourmet Club Greek night. This is one of the best dishes I have ever made, it is beautiful and none were left! I followed the recipe with everyone's suggestions (1/4 cup of butter, take the pan off the stove while you are whisking it in) 1 cup of balsamic, reduced. I just wrapped the scallops in strips of filo and used greek olive oil instead of butter to brush them with.

My boyfriend and I made this for our Valentine's day dinner appetizer, and we both thought it was amazing. We shredded regular, frozen filo instead of searching for kataifi, and made half the butter sauce, but otherwise followed the recipe. Don't skip any of the garnishes - the flavor combo really pops against the scallops, especially the dill and balsamic reduction. And butter sauce is always a good thing :)

Make it exactly as written (except you don't need to cut them in half to serve.) You really do need all that butter and all that balsamic, but you should be reducing it to a thick syrup. Kataifi is pretty easy to work with (first time) but don't break the long strands.

Fantastic! Only change I made was using only 1 cup of balsamic and did not heat it. 2 cups would have been too much. Delicious and will definitely make again!!

AWESOME!!I made this for our dinner club of 20 years and it was one of the best appetizers we have ever made.I took someones advice as I couldn't find Kataifi and shredded filo and it was great! Will make again very very soon

wow! These were the hit of the party. The presentation with the red diced tomatoes and green scallions and the butter sauce is 1st class. I cut the scallops into 4ths and then used the frozen filo dough (thawed of course). I used butter and pasted two sheets together and then cut it into strips to wrap around the scallops. This seemed a better choice than trying to bake the scallops with the filo and then cut the baked filo which I thought would crumble. Baking em again tonight.

T-rific! Was declared the best appetizer we have had at our supper club, and we have been meeting at least 10 times a year for the past 5 years! As others have mentioned, the recipe makes lots of balsamic. While very tasty, plan to work on butter sauce to make it not so buttery - 2 sticks is a bit much for my taste.

According to a google search on this type of phylo it said: kataifi filo = shredded phyllo. Cooks in Greece and the Middle East use this shredded dough to make sweet desserts. You can find it among the frozen foods in Middle Eastern and Greek markets. While working with it, cover any unused dough with a damp cloth. To make your own: Roll thawed phyllo dough into a log, then slice into 1/4-inch rounds.

This recipe was truly fantastic, and easy to make! The scallops cooked to perfection in the dough, and the butter sauce was phenomenal. One thing- you and your house will smell like butter for days. But it is worth it!

I just went to Thalassa Restaurant in NYC, where Gregory Zapantis is the head chef, and had this dish. It was one of the best things I've ever eaten! I was SO excited to find this recipe on the Epicurious website! If you follow the directions exactly it comes out wonderfully. This one's a real keeper.

This recipe was amazing. I have been looking for a long time for a flavorful way to serve scallops and this was it! A few notes. Instead of shallot in the butter sauce I used two large cloves of garlic and half of a small onion diced. The butter sauce makes enough sauce to cover 16 large wrapped scallops not just 4. Also the balsamic reduction makes so much that I would recommend reducing the amount you simmer to 1 or even 1/2 a cup. Instead of regular tomatos I used quartered cherry tomatos-less juice that way. In terms of presentation I served the scallops over a bed of wilted kale then spponed the bits of garlic and onion over the tops of the scallops, drizzled with butter and balsamic then sprinkled the halved tomatos, chopped dill and scallon on top. It is beautiful and was a hit!

How is kataifi filo different from the stuff I can buy in my grocery store? Do you think the latter might work in this recipe. I don't think there's a Greek grocery in my state.

This was fabulous and easy. I would have normally used a dry white wine for the sauce but i had some leftover riesling so I used that. It was something special. Everyone was very impressed. No need to use an expensive balsamic.In fact one of the very best is from Costco, their Kirkland's brand. Very sweet and thick even before the reduction. After being reduced it is delectable

awesome... my girled love it too. Used rice wine vinegar(lighter, sweeter flavor than balsamic) instead of balsamic.

Wonderful recipe with very impressive presentation. I strained the buerre blanc after adding the butter and stirred in 2t of Sambucca. You only need to reduce 1c of the vinegar. Also make this with XL shrimp...fantastic... a keeper

Holy moly, was this delicious! I can't wait to serve these to someone. The dish is so elegant and yummy. A couple notes: Make the balsamic reduction ahead. A little goes a very very long way. I only used drops on the plate and it still may have been too much. Chop the shallots, it looked prettier. (the butter sauce is out of this world). And don't be too afraid to work with the kataifi, just try and mold it in your hand around the scallop. They look like snowball cakes going in. If you're afraid you're using too much of it, it's okay...everyone will love the light crunch. Kataifi can be found in any Greek market; just ask for it.

Fantastic recipe. Our favorite of the four from this episode. I think it will be even better a second time when I will be more careful with the butter. It does seem like an awful lot of butter.
