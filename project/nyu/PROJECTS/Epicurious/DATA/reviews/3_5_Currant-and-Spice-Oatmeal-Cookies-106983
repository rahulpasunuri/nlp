Delicious but they do indeed spread out a lot; I have no idea why the recipe says to space them so close, and also to press them down before baking. I would recommend at least 3 inches between each cookie, and chill the dough before baking to reduce spreading. They are tasty tasty though!

I substituted raisins for the currants and added some semi-sweet chocolate chips. Also added a half tablespoon of chopped orange zest. Didn't have the ground allspice so I added clove instead. I agree that you should go a little light on the cardamom as that can be an overpowering flavor. Overall a tasty cookie. Got lots of complements

Real nice recipe! Used raisins instead of currants since that's what the hubby ordered and only 1/4tsp cardamom since its taste is so unique and didn't want to overpower. They came out kidna flat but I guess that's no big deal since the flavor was spot on! I recommend and will make again. Already got this one saved to my computer! Enjoy!

Wow, this recipe is a fantastic change to the usual oatmeal and raisin cookies. The flavors are really subtle, but they make this recipe stand out. The only recommendation I have is reducing the amount of cardamom, especially if you use freshly ground like I did. I ended up only using 1/4tsp.

I went with another reviewer and used dried cranberries instead, still delicious. Also, I didn't have allspice, but they still came out well. I added an ounce of cherry brandy to the egg mixture, mmm mmm. Quick cooking oats worked as well. Oh, and I only cooked each sheet (~12 cookies) for 8-9 minutes, only because I like my cookies super soft and chewy. Thumbs up!

I used raisin instead of currants. I didn't soak the currants in the egg mixture, instead I soaked in overnight in some orange juice. I skipped the all spice, because I didn't have any. Despite all that changes, this cookie recipe WAS the best oatmeal cookie ever. I've gotten so many complements on these cookies. These will be my only oatmeal raisin cookie from now one

I have made these cookies numerous times & they always come out great. I do use 1 stick of butter & 1/3cp.oil, 1 cp.brown sugar &1/2 cp white sugar. I soak the currants in 1 tb.bourbon,or brandy & 1 tsp of vanilla. They are chewy & so flavorful. Men just love them.Try them,you won't be disappointed.

I love these cookies. I replace the currants with about a cup of dried cranberries (no need to soak). They are always a hit! For those that don't want them as thin (they're still chewy) you can refrigerate the dough on sheets once you've flattened and put them in the oven cold.

These cookies did not have good flavor - the currants added little to the finished product. Would use raisins instead and decrease the cardamom to 1/2 tsp. Maybe that would make these fun to eat.

These cookies are a wonderfully different version of the classic oatmeal raisin cookies! I added them on my Christmas cookie platters I give to my friends every year in 2002 and have made them every year since. They are very popular!

These cookies are delicious! I added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips to the recipe and my friends have asked me to make them again and again. They can be made gluten-free by replacing the all purpose flour with 3/4 cup sorghum or brown rice flour, 3/4 cup sweet rice (mochi) flour, and 1/4 cup tapioca flour. I used gluten-free oats in place of the old-fashioned oats; these were from Gifts of Nature (http://www.giftsofnature.net/). Enjoy!

Delicious! I didn't change a thing, and these were swell. They're distinguished by the addition of cardamom and the use of currants instead of raisins; both make them just a little different but still comforting and Christmasy.

This is the second time I've made these cookies, the first time as written, and this past time with less sugar, subbing dried apricots for currants. Thumbs up for less sugar, but I do prefer currants to apricots. There are better oatmeal cookie recipes out there (try Andy's, from this site) but these are pretty good.

After all of the reviews, especially those recommending more spice and less sugar, I was so disappointed. I followed the suggestions and just didn't like them. They weren't a hit at the office party, either. Although I love sharp ginger cookies, I guess that I'm not a spice cookie person.

Yummo.. added more spice and less sugar.

A yummy variation on the classic oatmeal cookie. Very easy to make and come out nicely. I upped the amounts of the spices but next time may try the recipe as written to see if spice and oat flavors are more balanced.

I will give this recipe another try, but I thought it was too soft. The taste was nice, but to me not much different from other oatmeal type cookies. I took these to work and they were all eaten, but no one said, I love these, or, can I have the recipe.

This recipe is fantastic! I've made this several times, tweaking it a little bit each time. I love the density of the currants instead of regular raisins. I also add raw walnuts. I love spices, so I always double up on it. I use less 1 cup of all-purpose flour instead of 1 2/3 because I'm trying to cut down on white flour in my diet. I tried replacing it once with wheat flour and the taste just wasn't there. So now I cut down on the all-purpose flour and use 2 2/3 to 3 cups of old-fashion oats instead. The cookies tend to come out flat because of the reduced flour, but they still taste great. I think for the next round I'm going to try all egg whites and see how that goes. Great recipe!

Easy and tasty, with a nice chewy texture - the cardamom works beautifully with the oatmeal and currants. I took these in to work, and they didn't live past 1:00 pm.

Wow. Having never tasted cardamom (to my knowledge), it was with real anticipation that I took my first bite of this cookie when the first batch came out of the oven this past Christmas. Out of the oven and into my recipe box of "keepers," this is one I will look forward to making and gobbling up again and again.

My husband loves this recipe. I made it again, but substituted 1 1/3 cups chopped raisins, increased the cardamon to 1 tsp, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp allspice and reduced the oats to 1 3/4 cup. I way prefer the altered recipe, the sugar from the chopped raisins really brought out a nice brown sugar taste, and i love cardamon. It didn't feel too strong at all. I also used a small cookie scoop, baked for 10 min and pushed down the centers at 8 min [in some batches], so they were nice and crisp outside, with chewy centers. It's great either way.

I made these cookies for my college kids who are college students. I not only baked some but froze some into balls so they could bake them fresh at a later date. They raved about them. They are not big raisin fans but they loved the cookies with currants. These are wonderful cookies!

I didn't have cardamom, so I used extra cinnamon and added allspice. I also used about 1 1/8c sugar, which turned out terrific.

You can be proud to bring these to a cookie-swap. An adult cookie that my kids really liked. I used Sun-Maid Zante-currants and was surprised by how small they were. I would up the quantity to a full cup. I really like cardemom in general and would even increase the amount "slightly". Definitely a keeper.

This has become my favorite "care package cookie" - stays soft and chewy for weeks! The cardamom totally makes them. Try substituting dried cranberries plumped in Gran Marnier for the currants, and add a little orange zest for a different twist.

These are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. I did not have currants, so I used raisins and skipped the soaking in the beginning. Also, I found that baking them for 10 minutes was enough.

Best oatmeal cookies I've made! Some improvements: Used parchment paper (so no buttering or flouring needed), used 1 cup sugar (sweet enough for me). Next time I'll try quick cooking oats as some of the oats felt too hard (like uncooked) but not like crunchy...

Everyone loved these cookies! These will definitely be part of my cookie repetoire going forward. No need to flour the cookie sheets if you use the non-stick variety - a light greasing is sufficient.

Gosh, this cardamon is Great!!! These cookies are absolutely devine. I added only 1 cup of sugar and it seems just right. Also, I added just a tiny bit of bittersweet chocolate chips. These cookies will definitely be a part of my kids lives.

These cookies were excellent! I had never used cardamom before and was pleasantly surprised at the unique flavor. I also used raisins. My husband said these are the best oatmeal raisin cookies he's ever had. He asked if I could make them again this week....:)

Four forks are a rarity for me -- these cookies deserve every one! I doubled the spices and halved the sugar (an easy trick, virtually always highlights the << essence >> with a reduction in sweetness). Because it was what was on hand, I used demerara sugar. This is my first very favorite new recipe of 2004. Wow!!

I didn't have any currants or dark brown sugar so I made them with light brown sugar and maple chunks (found at any good health food store) and added about half an orange's zest. These are the best cookies I've made all year.

These cookies are adictive...you cannot eat just one. I did make a few changs by doubling the spices and adding toffee bits. The toffee bits add a special crunch. Made the first batrch for a friend which was recovering from surgery, however my family ate them all before I could deliver them!! The second batch made it to the intended recipient who was bragging about the cookies for days! Use a silpat for easier baking and faster clean-up.

I got hooked on cardamon after I've made Cardamon Biscuits from this site. After seeing this recipe with cardamon, I was sure it'd be great. I ate 3 pcs right after it was baked. I was glad to have reduced the sugar to just 1 cup, otherwise, it would be too sweet for my taste. Also substituted the butter with 3/4 cup olive oil so my 2 yr old can eat it (has dairy allergies). No currants on hand, so used raisins instead. Soft and chewy, keeper for sure!

Really good texture. It's not a chunky or thick cookie, but therein is the beauty of it. Chewy and slightly crisp on the edges. While the recipe as printed is great, I would like to try it again adding various dried fruit or chopped nuts.

I used dried cranberries and added 1 Tbsp of Grand Marnier (orange liqueor) to the egg and vanilla mixture with the chopped cranberries. I also added a pinch of powdered cloves and 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts. This is a simple and delicious recipe. Expect compliments and requests for more.

I made them using dried cranberries. Everyone loved them. I shaped the extra dough into a roll wrapped in plastic wrap and froze. I thawed them a little and the sliced and baked as directed and they came out great the second time. I took them to meeting last night and everyone got eaten.

I made these cookies last night for my son's birthday party. I doubled the amount of spice added. I did not have any currants so I used Craisins instead. My son loved the cookies! I took the extras to work and they got rave reviews! They were very easy to make.
