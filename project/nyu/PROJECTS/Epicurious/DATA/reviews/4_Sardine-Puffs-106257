WOW WOW WOW!! For people who have the ability to love sardines, this is THE recipe! Toast your bread whole, then spread the sardine mixture evenly over the top. Using a sharp knife, cut into eighths (it makes them crispier). I put them on a cooling rack on top of the baking sheet...it allows air to circulate all around. 10 minutes later: perfectly crisp and OH SO delicious. Trust me, eating low on the food chain never tasted so good

This is quite tasty and extremely easy to prepare. Even non-sardine fans may enjoy it. My wife thought it tasted like tuna fish. I would take issue with the number of suggested servings. I found that cutting the trimmed bread in quarters produced a nice sized puff. I don't think I would want to try to handle those triangles cut in half again. Some variations I may explore include Dijon mustard on the bread before the spread and perhaps adding some capers. Follow up: I made these again (3/02) (the one can of sardines goes a long way). I spread mustard on the bread 1st and added capers to the mix. I liked both. It does help reduce the fishiness of the taste. I also discovered that applying the spread goes much faster if you keep the triangles together and treat them like one piece of bread before toasting.
