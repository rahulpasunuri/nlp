I've made this stuffing for 3 Thanksgivings now, and everyone LOVES it. I will always use this recipe, exactly as is.

Fantastic. I made it to go with the turkey at Christmas and everyone loved it. Once in balls, I rolled them in an egg and then in some specially dried breadcrumbs that my mother makes from time to time in her Aga, so not only did they taste good, but they looked good too. I'm making them again today.

We made this stuffing as stuffing for a goose (here) and it was a big hit. We substituted fresh lamb, garlic and herb sausage for the pork sausage, and added some sage as well as some thyme, and used homemade chicken stock instead of canned broth. Those were the only substitutions. It filled a large goose with only a little left over, and everyone loved it.

Delicious! I made this in March as a side dish and people loved it! Chestnuts are out of season but I got some dried ones at the local Asian market and they were perfectly fine after I soaked them. Extra figs and chestnuts were added just because I love them. I used 4 T. of red wine instead of brandy. I toasted and then tore apart a baguette. It was moist enough but some of the bread pieces were still crunchy. It was perfect!

We served this for Thanksgiving this year and it was so popular that we decided to make it the "house stuffing" for next year too.

After reading the reviews I was a little afraid this stuffing would be a bit dry, so I used a bit more sausage than the recipe called for and I also used a pork sausage with a bit more fat. I added 1/4 stick of butter to the sausage mixture as it was cooking and I also added an egg to the entire thing and then extended the baking time to about an hour. I used sliced white bread cut in chunks instead of breadcrumbs, because breadcrumbs soak up more moisture. I thought this variation was great and will definitely make it again next year with the turkey!

I made this dressing for a large holiday dinner gathering (of people I didn't really know)to go with the centerpiece goose. We all agreed that it was the combination of the goose's texture and flavor with the figs and chestnuts that made it a huge hit (whew!), and that it probably wouldn't have been quite as successful with a turkey or chicken. I used French chestnuts that had been boiled and vacuum-sealed and well-ripened figs, so the dressing stayed nice and moist. I also used a fairly spicy, locally made sausage which had a relatively high fat content, so this probably also helped keep the dish from drying out. This isn't a spur-of-the-moment kind of recipe but definitely a festive one. I'm not really a holiday person, but I'm looking forward to next year so I can give it another go.

This stuffing is really a nice change of pace. Don't serve to the meat and potatoes crowd. Buy shelled chestnuts if possible!

Disappointing, too dry. By itself, it tastes good, but with the general richness of a Christmas meal, it gets lost in the crowd.
