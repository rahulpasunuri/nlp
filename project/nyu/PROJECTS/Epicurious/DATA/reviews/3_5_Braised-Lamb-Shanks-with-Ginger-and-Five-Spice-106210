Excellent - dinner party quality. I actually made it with spaghetti squash. Recommend using canned garlic and ginger because there isn't enough ingredients to make the food processor work effectively. Make sure you wrap the aluminum foil really good because mine came open slightly in the cooking process.

The first batch of these that I made were very salty; I cut down on the black bean paste the second time and that helped. I'm going to try and find a different (less salty) brand. That aside, the flavour of these is beyond compare; I love lamb shanks and this is my absolute favourite recipe for them. I don't reduce the liquid as much as instructed--this makes a bit more juice when they're served.

Excellent - everybody loved this meal - I wouldn't change a thing- it must be served with mashed potatoes to really enjoy the gravy.

This recipe was delicious, and I did not have to add extra salt, as a previous reader suggested. I used O - bone lamb chops instead of lamb shanks, because there were no meaty lamb shanks available at the market (the recipe suggests 1 pound shanks). I applied the seasoning paste as suggested and braised the chops, following the recipe except for shortening the cooking time to 1 hour and 15 minutes. The chops were tender, and there was just the right amount of seasoning. I would not want more braising liquid. I would definitely make these again.

The flavor of the lamb was delicious, however I prefer more braising liquid, which I think would create a more moist and tender meat. I added a bit more salt based on the other review, but then decided that adding more salt was not needed. My black bean garlic paste added enough salt for my taste. I agree with the extra mushrooms and onions. I would not make this again because I prefer more braising liquid and I think that is hard to do with a foil wrap.

The lamb shanks were tender and delicious although they needed some salt. Also, when I make these again I would use additional mushrooms and green onions because they shrunk up into a tiny amount. I poured all of the juices from the foils into a gravy separator before serving to get rid of the excess fat. The flavors of this dish were really tasty and wonderful.
