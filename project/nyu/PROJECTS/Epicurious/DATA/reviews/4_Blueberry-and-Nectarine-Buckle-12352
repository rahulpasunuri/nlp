This is THE best buckle/coffeecake! I've made it twice in the last two weeks to rave reviews. It's simple to make and big on taste.

This was wonderful! I served it on Father's Day. I did what another person suggested and sprinkled raw crystal sugar (turbino) on top before baking. The combination of the sweet, crunchy topping with a smooth fluffy warm center was perfect. I ate a Blueberry Buckle before while staying at an old Michigan Inn and liked this so much better. Shamefully (and delightfully), we ate two servings each in one sitting.

I made this using blueberries and plums, as I didn't have any nectarines. It was absolutely delicious! The topping with the bit of nutmeg was so nummy. I baked it in a 9 inch spring form pan, and it looked beautiful when I took off the outside of the pan. Definitely will make this again with different fruits. This is a keeper!

I just happened to have a giant bowl of blueberries and 2 nectarines in my fridge so this was both convenient and delicious! Very easy to make, no weird ingredients. I didn't have nutmeg (used a little ginger) - my book club loved this. Great with whipped cream...next time will try with vanilla ice cream.

Excellent recipe! I doubled the recipe, baked it in a 9x13 glass pan and added about 15 minutes to cooking time. I also added a little extra vanilla. The texture was amazingly light. I might reduce the sugar in the batter next time - it would be fine with a little less sugar.

Excellent! Used peaches instead of nectarines. Baked in 9x9 pan. Used food processor to make the topping; came out crisp and golden.

A huge hit! Nothing but raves on this one! I substituted whole wheat pastry flour for white, brown sugar for white, and used a little less. Next time I will sprinkle a coarse turbinado on the top for more crunch. Used apox. 3.5 cups of blueberries and skipped the nectarines. Baked it in a standard, rectangle cake pan for 30 minutes, doubled the topping and . . . scrumptious! ps-not familiar w/ "double" duty bp?

Just made this w/ fresh blueberries and plums instead of nectarines (just b/c we had ripe ones). It is fantastic. The cake is buttery, light and fluffy w/ very tender crumb. I'll be making this again soon. I baked it a 9" square metal pan. Only change was 1/8 tsp. cloves to the topping.

Great summertime dessert! I made it with rhubarb, strawberries and raspberries instead of the nectarines since I had them on hand. Tartness of the rhubarb and raspberries was great against the crunchy sugary topping. I also used whole wheat flour in the topping and half whole wheat/half white flour in the batter to make it a little healthier and no one was the wiser. Served hot out of the oven with vanilla ice cream. Very quick and easy, took me less than 15 minutes to make it. I will try with all my summer fruits. This one is a keeper!

I enjoyed this recipe, although it didn't wow me. I've had better buckle...

This was delicious. My family adored it. I bought fresh blueberries and nectarines especially for the buckle. A hint: Make sure you use cold butter in the topping.

This should be under the 'quick and easy" section. Fast, simple and delicious. Highlights any summer fruit (I added some orange zest). Serve right out of the oven with ice cream.

This was excellent. I made it exactly per recipe and wouldn't change anything. Next time I will make sure I have vanilla ice cream in the house to serve with it!

This is simple and wonderful, a perfect way to use summer fruit. I found that the amount of butter could be reduced to 1/2 cup for the batter with no loss of flavor or texture. This isn't complicated, but it is among my family's favorites. Yum!

This is a divine dessert! Others that I made it for agree and have asked for the recipe.

Yum -very tasty - like others have said much like a coffeecake. I made it exactly as recipe says & it came out perfectly! It was even better than I expected. Great with a little vanilla ice cream.

I make this a couple times each summer. Tis excellent. it's a big hit with the family. it's more like... cake with little fruit bits in it. make sure the butter is cold for the topping - put it in the fridge if you have to do something else for a while.

Easy to make and would go great with ice cream on a hot July night.

My mom's blueberry buckle is an Easter tradition in our house...and I misplaced the recipe! Found this one and gave it a shot - not for us...too much fruit, and no cake-like texture. Even tried a second batch with 1/2 the fruit, but the consistency just wasn't right. Maybe if I'd never had moms...!

To the cook from Zurich: To keep the topping from coming out as a paste, the butter should be quite cold and cut into 1/2 tb pieces. You should use a pastry blender or two knives to cut the butter into the flour. That will result in the crumbly texture.

Moist, sweet, great for brunch or dessert.

This was a combination that I simply could not resist. I made this at the peak of blueberry season (I live in southwestern Michigan where an enormous amount of blueberry fields are under cultivation.). I'm sure that nectarines would be wonderful in this dish, but I felt I had to use the luscious Red Haven peaches that were also in abundance at the same time of year. It was very well received by friends. I highly recommend this recipe!

EXCELLENT!!! My family raved over it and gobbled it down - it was delicious hot, cold and rewarmed. I would certainly make it again. Just one problem: my topping came out like a paste and in no way resembled coarse meal. Nevertheless, the whole thing came out great.

This is the best buckle recipe that I have come across! I have substituted peaches and blackberries for the nectarines, and they work beautifully. I have also made it with blueberries alone.

A summer favorite ever since this was published in 1991, especially when blueberries and nectarines are fresh and abundant. I find myself comoing back to this recipe over and over as a dessert for backyard get-togethers, and also a lovely finale to Sunday brunch.

Huge family summer hit. Served to large crowds with rave reviews and empty bowls!

Very nice, tastes like coffeecake. Don't make the same mistake I made though -- if you must use a 2-quart dish, be sure it is the rectangular "shallow" kind of pan, NOT the round "deeper" casserole dish I used. It still tasted good, but took FOREVER to cook.

I've made this a few times and get many compliments. It's delicious--especially warm!

Very easy to make and a huge hit with my family! It's a great cake to bring to pot luck dinners in the summer, when the fruits are at their best.
