Let's start with... what is mustard cabbage? I live in NYC and went to Fairway. Even they were confused. But... I did add about 1 tablespoon of Maillard Dijon mustard at the end and it really punched up the sauce and made it less cloyingly sweet. And a touch of Thai chili powder for those who are brave.

Stuffed cabbage is an old school recipe that takes time; of course there are many steps! But I love removing the leaves as the head boils, carving off the stems, rolling them up, watching them stew... it only makes it more rewarding. This recipe is super tasty, and worth the effort. The sweet & sour nature reminds me of the cabbage my mom makes back in Michigan.

after reading the reviews I decided to follow suit with this recipe - I made it with a browned oxtail ( tremendous flavor )dashes of cinnamin and cumin and a few cloves. also added a splash or two of sherry. for the meat filling I used meatloaf mix of pork,veal and beef.... YUMMY - great for the colder climes.

The sauce had wonderful flavors and the stuffing was delicious too!

Made this with what the supermarket here informatively labels "greens"--steamed for 10 minutes instead of boiled. Cherries and sugar in the sauce give it a slightly North African flavour. I might spice up the filling next time but it has a nice, subtle taste as is.

This is delicious. Too bad there are so many steps. Left over rice and microwaving the cabbage will save time, energy and dirty pans. I only cooked mine 45 minutes as the rice was made ahead. My mother used to do hers in a pressure cooker in 30 minutes. This sauce was heaven ++++

I found this recipe to be tedious however that doesn't usually stop me because the I'm usually pleased with the end result of such an intense dish. I used regular napa cabbage versus mustard cabbage. I also added a bit of cinnamon to the filling as well as a dash of cayenne pepper. I turned out wonderful but the next time I prepare this dish I am going to incorporate oxtails into the sauce and cook for about 2 1/2 3 hrs and add the stuffed cabbage rolls in the last 1 1/2hrs.
