I made this and the sauteed beef from the same piece (January 2009 Gourmet). Both were a big hit. I didn't have anything on hand except pregrated parm, but even so, with the lemon zest, this was really special. The one other reviewer who also made the beef seems to have been unimpressed. We really liked it; even the 12-year-old asked for seconds and he's pretty picky, especially about anything "new" I make. Unfortunately I don't think they've posted (yet) the beef recipe on Epicurious, which is a shame, because it was tasty, easy to make for a weeknight dinner and surprisingly frugal for a Gourmet recipe.

This was fabulous! It was simple but went wonderfully with the sauteed beef with white wine and rosemary since the beef had a rather overpowering and strong flavor. The acini was subtle and delicate in flavor- almost aromatic because of the lemon zest. I use the microplane grater/zester for the parmesan and lemon- it's the best zester I have ever used! Like a previous reviewer, I used more parmesan than what was called for- but I usually do. Definitely use a fresh parmesan instead of a pregrated, bagged one- it melts so much better. I actually plan on making this over and over again, while the sauteed beef is probably not much of a repeat. If the side dish usurps the main dish, you know it's good!

Used a little bit more butter and cheese (romano) and it was wonderful! Excellent with Sautéed Beef with White Wine and Rosemary from the same issue of Gourmet.

This was a really delicious side dish. I didn't have enough lemon zest (only had one lemon) so I used the juice of that lemon instead of the pasta water - and lots of freshly ground black pepper.

This was very good, easy to make, and a little different. I made it with the roast chicken with pancetta and olives also in this issue of Gourmet. I liked the acini di pepe better than the chicken.
