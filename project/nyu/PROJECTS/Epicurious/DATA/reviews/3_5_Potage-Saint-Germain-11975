Delicious and a gorgeous color, but I tweaked the recipe. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly. I found the remaining pea skin unpleasant and annoying. In the end I forced the soup through a sieve which threw the balance between the pea and mint out of wack. Now I use two 16 oz bags of frozen peas instead. The extra peas keep the pea/mint balance in the sieved soup. I plan to make this soup in the summer and serve it chilled with peeled, seeded, diced cucumber instead of croutons.

Every Spring I buy too much at the Farmer's Market so every Spring I get to make this soup. This year I made some minor alterations: I threw in 2 whole cloves of garlic and added some fresh ground nutmeg. We all loved it. I love the texture, it is Potage St. Germain. And for the cook asking about cutting the recipe in half, I have successfully frozen the excess. It reheats well.

A very delicious, light and flavorful soup that I go back to again and again. I agree with the other reviewer that it's hard to get this completely smooth without endless blending. However, I've come to embrace it's slight texture because it's so unique among all the other soups I make.

I actually have a question. This recipe makes a lot of soup. To cut that in half, do I just cut the ingredient quatities in half also? I just want to make sure this does not change the flavor. Thank you.

This soup was delicious and easy to make. The colour is outstanding-- I made it for an Easter lunch-- it is nice and clean as a first course to wake up the appetite. I especially liked what the lettuce did for the soup. I substituted old hot dog buns to make the croutons and just used some sour cream instead of the heavy cream. Will definitely make a gain.

The soup had great flavour, but next time I would force ir through a seive to make it smoother and rid it of the tough pea skins. The cream garnish is essential.

I made this in 1986 when it appeared in Bon Appetit's Too Busy To Cook book. I'm so happy to find it here after losing it! This was my first try at gourmet (with frozen peas) and I still crave it all these years later, now that I know what fresh peas are!

A not too filling first course soup that easy to prepare ahead. The croutons and cream make it very pretty.

Absolutely delicious! I made the croutons with English muffins, which gave a great texture, and used Boston lettuce in the soup. Adding the cream garnish is a must! A wonderful, rich, soothing soup for a cold winter's day. Delicious with sauvignon blanc and fruit for dessert.
