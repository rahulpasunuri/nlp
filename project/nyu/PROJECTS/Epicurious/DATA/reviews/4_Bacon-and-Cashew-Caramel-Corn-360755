Absolutely delicious!!! I've made this several times now,and there's never any left! I recommend you DO NOT cook bacon til 'almost crisp' as indicated-- IT WILL BURN IN THE OVEN! And only cook the syrup to a "LIGHT" amber for a sweeter, creamer flavor-- a darker syrup is less flavorful, almost bitter-tasting, and will taste more like molasses than caramel. I also use a bit more cashews and bacon than recipe calls for.

Oh my goodness...this stuff is totally addicting! I made it for a Super Bowl party and it was a big hit. Perfect blend of salty, sweet and spicy... I followed the recipe closely except that I skipped the tea infusion. I used applewood-smoked bacon which gave it plenty of smokiness, and I did bump up the quantities of both bacon and cashews a little bit. The only part that was a little tricky was mixing the caramel into the popcorn. The caramel cools fast, so if you have a helper, one person can drizzle the caramel while the other mixes. I found it was easier to spread the popcorn mixture on the cookie sheet, drizzle the caramel over, then sprinkle with the cayenne and salt. Toss once, put it in the oven, and continue to mix periodically; it softens up enough to get pretty even distribution. Coating the spoons with nonstick spray is a must! This will definitely become a favorite in our house!

While the end result was pleasing (I added melted dark chocolate drizzle which was nice!), I will say this was a pain to make. It used just about every utensil and pot and pan in my kitchen and if it weren't for my BF helping with both the recipe and KP duty, I would have gone stark raving mad half-way through. I took it to a party, and people seemed to like it, but no one was raving about it. Also, be very careful about the caramel - it can go from amber to burnt very quickly. Mine was close but still good.

things to note - it's very easy to overcook the caramel. i came out with an almost burnt caramel taste. i found it a bit on the spicy side, even though i do like cayenne. i'm also marking down due to it being both a mess to prepare (caramel and popcorn everywhere!) and it used EIGHT pans.

Oh boy...this was good. Like addictingly good. Don't I added some extra bacon...because, why not?

Quite good. Nice, light & tasty.

This recipe is amazing. I am giving it three stars because I used three pans, a cookie sheet, and three spatulas, plus other things like measuring cups and spoons. It is way too time consuming and the caramel-making-method is totally flawed. Next time I make it I will: 1. use microwave popcorn (or loose popcorn popped in a brown paper lunch bag in the microwave, which works just as well. no butter or salt either way), that will be so much easier (saving a pan and lots of time plus the fat from the oil) 2. microwave the cream with the tea until is just boils (saving another pan and time) 3. definitely double the bacon and cashews 4. use roasted cashews as the raw don't have enough flavor to stand up to the caramel, bacon, and cayenne. As for the caramel. you should dump the sugar and water (and corn syrup if you choose to use it) into your saucepan, giving it a stir to combine everything. Turn the heat right up to high. Wash the sides of the pan down with warm water and a pastry brush so crystals don't form (do this periodically if necessary), then LEAVE IT ALONE until is starts to turn a light amber color. Once that happens give it a swirl every 10 seconds or so until it is a nice rich amber color. Immediately take it off the heat. Add the cream and stir until the bubbling subsides.

Made as written (except didn't have oolong so used orange/black pekoe tea) and it was quite tasty! Don't think it's necessary to double the bacon/cashews - I needed a bit of reprieve from the richness of those bites every now and then.

We found some oolong tea at Whole Foods, so we were able to follow the recipe exactly. The tea imparts a very sultry lavender taste. We added a little extra bacon and doubled the cashews. It was a big hit at a recent wine & whiskey party we went to. Can't wait to make it again.

Oh. My. Goodness. This is my worst nightmare and my best friend. Sweet and salty at its best and easy to make. Yum.

Made this for a staff party and it was a hit! Didn't have oolong tea, so used black tea...which left a nice smoky hint along with the bacon. Next time I might try earl grey tea, and will definitely double the bacon and cashews.

This was awesome! I did double the amount of bacon and cashews. It was a hit! I pulled the sugar off the burner a bit early just incase and it worked out really well. I made it the day before and it will still nice and fresh for the party.

A delicious and surprisingly easy recipe for caramel corn. As other reviewers suggest, I plan on doubling the amount of bacon and cashews the next time I make this, otherwise it is mostly normal caramel corn studded with those delicious bits. I don't think the tea addition did much, and I think next time I will skip it--I used darjeeling as I didn't have any oolong and found it rather blah. The caramel recipe is simple and the whole thing is manageable on one's own--highly recommended. Plus, think of the variations!

This stuff disappeared so fast it was funny, You couldn't taste the bacon but everybody liked it. U doubled the cashews and learned something about store brand microwave popcorn. Skip is or be sure to sift out the kernals that don't pop. They were way to many! This is a crowd pleased.

Used 2 bags of Newman's Organic Pop's Corn and it was fabulous.

YUM! I made this to send camping with the Boy Scouts today, and if there's any left by the time it's done cooling, I'll let you know what they think! Great combination of flavors though I would also add more cashews and bacon next time. Using a Revereware pan (copper bottom) on high heat, I found that the carmel was done in about half the time.

This is great! I made this X4 so it was pretty hard. I used light popcorn out of the bag (much easier) but it was hard to mix the caramel and popcorn together quickly. I would make double batches seperate next time. I am making these as goodie bags for an anniversary party and X4 looks like it should be plenty for 30 ppl.

almost idiot proof. when cooking the caramel you have to be vigilant it goes to a super thick state quickly. the tea adds a beautiful depth of flavor. we also substitue dry crushed chipotle for the cayenne.

Rating: 4
Everyone I have served this to has loved it. However it definitely needs more cashews added to it.

Rating: 2
This is okay, but not special enough to be worth the effort. I did not care for the flavor of the tea with the caramel, and I regret not doubling the amount of cashews. It might have been easier with a second set of hands as the caramel burns and hardens quickly.

Love this recipe! Made a batch to surprise my husband, he helped me make two more batches to share with friends. This is a nice adult version of a kids treat. I made as directed, just cooked it a bit longer to ensure it had a high gloss. It holds well in the refrigerator.

This is a terrific recipe. A ouple tips I would add is to double the amount of pop corn to 1 cup because I had a problem with getting all of the kernels to pop. Also, I did half brown sugar and granulated to give the caramel more depth. I didn't have oolong tea so I used Lady Grey and it worked out very well. It added a smokey element to the caramel that was very nice. I made this for friends tonight and it was a hit! I will probably make this to include in holiday gift bags.

I agree.It is delicious, but you really have to watch it when making the caramel. I almost burned it. Also used extra bacon and extra cashews. I baked at 250 for about 10 min.

Wowza - totally sinful and delicious. I didn't think it was anything special until the next day as the flavors seemed to settle. I used Trader Joes Uncured bacon which was perfect as it's a thicker, meatier cut of meat.

I've made this twice now to rave reviews. This last time I added about four ounces of dark chocolate melted with a half stick of butter. UNREAL! I needed two baking sheets and baked it at 250 for about 15 minutes.

We really enjoyed this, it is very tasty and interesting. I baked it at 300 maybe 10 minutes and it seemed to work well. Hope the website will add the bake temp and time.

Pretty easy recipe. Much easier with 2 people! The recipe is missing the oven temperature, however. We baked it at 350 and at 17 minutes, it was starting to burn. Maybe 250 or 300 degrees is better. Also added 2x as much cashews and some extra bacon.
