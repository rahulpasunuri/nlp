These are very good! I made them using roasted pecans and I did use toffee bits as suggested as well. One suggestion, make sure you press topping into melted chocolate as much as possible or else these are a bit messy. TOok them to a NYE party and everyone loved them!

Delicious and so easy to make! The best new recipe I tried this holiday season. The toffee cookies are sweet enough to satisfy your craving, but not overwhelmingly so like actual toffee candy. They make great treats to share with friends and co-workers.

Very sweet. I used semi-sweet chips, not milk choc, which would surely have put it over the top. Used those Heath bits on top. Kids did like. But did anyone get 48 cookies out of a 9x13 pan?

I agree that "toffee" is not an accurate title for these bars. However, the crust is a crisp and delicious base for endless adaptations. I used a good quality semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate for more flavor. I also had a batch of bourbon caramel sauce (from an epicurious "pumpkin cheesecake with bourbon caramel sauce" recipe) so I drizzled that on top before the almonds. They were absolutely amazing. I made a triple batch in two sheet pans and gave them to everyone as gifts. yum.

While not a bad bar cookie, the only 'toffee' flavor you will get out of this is if you sprinkle toffee bits on top. It's more like a plain blondie - while moist and a nice texture, it didn't have ANY flavor.

A delicious and easy recipe which is also kid-friendly and called for ingredients I had on hand. These bars were perfect to bring to my kids' holiday potluck at their school. I used semi-sweet chips, but next time we will increase the amount to 2 cups for a slightly thicker chocolate layer. We used Heath bits, which tasted great and gave a nice crunch, but they tended to fall off the top of the cookies. Next time we'll gently press the toffee bits into the melted chocolate just after spreading.

Excellent, easy dessert. I am not a milk chocolate fan, so I used Callebaut bittersweet callets (chips). For the topping I used a combination of lightly salted Marcona almonds (chopped) and a bag of Heath Bar Bits.

Super easy and delicious. Will definitely be a part of my Christmas Cookies repertoire. I made several batches over the holidays and the topping that tasted best were chopped salted pecans and almonds filched from the mixed nuts can that was leftover from a Christmas party! Heath bar bits are great too!

Will make this again and often, exactly as written. Delicate toffee taste. Great reviews from all tasters. My only decision is to use only chocolate chips for the topping. One time I made with broken milk chocolate bars (Lindt), but the chocolate did not melt. Even after repeated quick trips back into the oven, the broken bars failed to melt enough to spread. Tasted great, but the chocolate layer fell off the cookie layer. The chips performed perfectly both times I used it. May use a semisweet or even bittersweet chocolate next time.

I followed the recipe as is. My pan was not big enough so the crust did not bake all the way through the first time around. Other than that this is not anything extraordinary, and a little too buttery for my taste. The toffee flavor is completely absent. One thing going for it is how easy it is to make.

This was a very easy recipe to make and it turned out amazing. I wouldn't change a thing about it.

These cookies were delicious and will definitely make it into my regular holiday cookie repertory. I substituted Heath Baking Chips (the toffee ones) for most of the chocolate since I read the reviews prior to baking and saw that several people thought there wasn't enough toffee flavor. I thought subbing toffee chips for chocolate instead of nuts made sense, but if you do this, make sure you still have enough chocolate to spread over the crust, or there won't be anything for the nuts and toffee chips to stick to. The shortbread crust is absolutely delicious and would probably make a good base for other cookie bar recipes as well.

This is in the Betty Crocker Cooky book from the 50's? A holiday tradition...the best!

I too have been making this exact recipe for years. They're always a hit. It's my go-to cookie all year round. Sometimes I leave some of them plain for those who don't like nuts. Sprinkles or mini chocolate chips can also be used to top the chocolate layer. Walnuts are good too.

Easy to make. I used a knife to spread the dough as it is rather sticky. Used Ghiradelli chocolate chips. Instead of almonds I crushed Almond Roca in a Cuisinart and made that the top layer. These were great alone or served with ice cream. You can also make the crust, add the chocolate layer then freeze it. Then add an ice cream layer. Then add a layer of Almond Roca. Now you've got an ice cream cake! Easy to make and rave reviews by all.

Easy to prepare. The flavor is not exceptional. Kids like them because of the relatively thick chocolate topping. Hershey's milk chocolate chips harden up nicely. They were a good addition to a plate of Christmas cookies because I was looking for a variety in shapes and cookie types. I also agree with the cook who asked "where's the toffee?"

Made these today, as written, but with Heath bar chips for half the almonds because I was low on nuts. Next time, I'd do 100% almonds and maybe even use dark chocolate, because they are wicked sweet. For those questioning "where's the toffee?" - it's in the brown sugar and butter-based batter. Yum. Oh - and crazy easy.

The toasted almonds really make this recipe. It took a long time for the chocolate to harden but I think that might have been the chocolate I used (Guittard Milk Choc). Family loved these

I'm sorry, but where's the toffee? Am I missing something? This recipe shows crust and chocolate topping.

How have I never made these before? This recipe was delicious. I used Heath Crunch bits and nuts. I Make sure you line the pan very well. The dough is a bit sticky when you spread it out so either dampen your hands or sprinkle some flour on top to help you manage the stick factor.

This is the same exact recipe that my mother has been making for decades. It is a winner. I make these every holiday season; however, they are so easy and delicious one should make them year round.
