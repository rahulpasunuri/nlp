Flavors are good. One cautionary note: This dish may not be the best thing to make when you have lots of things in the oven giving off moisture. I had to squeeze the tray of asparagus into a crowded oven and I think this impacted the ability to achieve a good crunchy texture.

Also, I don't use mayo, so I substituted plain yogurt with fine results.

The whole family enjoyed this recipe. I dialed down the spice by only using 6-8 drops of the chili-garlic sauce, so flavor was there but not much heat, which was perfect for the toddler and preschooler. It was quite easy, and I love that it was baked instead of friedthe coating stayed on, it didn't absorb oil, and the asparagus stayed crisp.

Excellent! Used 1/2 of everything except asparagus - seemed perfect.

Easy and delicious. I served with grilled lamb chops and an anchovy-based sauce. Delicious!

easy and a different way to serve asparagus. cooking these on a cooling rack on a baking sheet eliminates the need to turn.

An easy, different way to prepare asparagus. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the cooking time and the amount of drizzling sauce just right. The sauce also would be a very good dipping sauce for gzoya.

This was a great addition to our dinner. Even my 3 year old twins loved this. The left overs were good chilled and served over a salad.

This recipe is so easy and it's like crack for asparagus lovers!!!! The only changes I made were using a pre-made hoisin sauce with a little chili-garlic sauce to perk it up and broiling the asparagus at the end for about 40 seconds to get them to brown up just a bit. Absolutely wonderful alongside grilled tofu and rice! I will definitely make these again...

A favorite. Be sure to use the thicker spears. Sometimes the asparagus is crisp, sometimes not. I think it has to do with how much attention I'm paying

I had six friends for dinner one night in the spring. While we were putting dinner together, we munched on these, dipping the spears in the sauce. Everyone loved them and they disappeared quickly!

I fix a lot of asparagus and this is by far the best way! Guests have raved about this recipe and I agree - it-is-good. Love the sesame-ginger combo !

I'll try it again with larger asparagus. Good flavor, but I used small spears and the coating couldn't crisp up

Tasty; different presentation for the usual asparagus.

Made this for easter and followed the recipe exactly as written. Gross, "good way to spoil asparagus" was the conclusion. All great ingredients together not good. Never crisped up either.

Served for Easter. A little time consuming, but good. Make sure you get medium to larger asparagus, b/c the small ones will shrivel up before the panko crisps up. My vote is for a little extra sauce.

Made the recipe to the letter as a side dish and it was fantastic. The crispy coating held up well and gave the asparagus a nice crunch. The drizzling sauce was a nice touch and can easily be used for pot stickers, egg rolls, etc.

Very good recipe for asparagus though its easy to go overboard with the drizzle. Note: There is enough mayo/breadcrumbs to make 30 spears. (Maybe more)

Served it on Easter. It went amazingly well with the ham and traditional fixin's. People went absolutely nuts over it. Every single person at the table asked for the recipe. We doubled the sauce as suggested by other reviewers. We couldn't find the chili garlic sauce, so we improvised with a garlic sesame sauce and a splash of hot sauce. An exceptional recipe.

My 6 year-old actually ate this and asked for more (leaving out the chili-garlic sauce)! One of the best asparagus recipes I've tried, and agree that doubling the drizzling sauce would improve it.

My husband raved over this asparagus dish. Next time, I will make more of the drizzling sauce. It would be great as dipping sauce. This is definitely going into the repertoire.
