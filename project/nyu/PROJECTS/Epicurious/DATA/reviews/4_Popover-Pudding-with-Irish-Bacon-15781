This is a great recipe; I made it for Christmas breakfast. I used trimmed presliced bacon; I did not fry the bacon in rendered fat, but rather placed bacon in a cast iron skillet under medium heat until the bacon was golden; the fat that came from the bacon (about 1/4 c), I left in the pan (I did not add any extra oil) then poured the flour mixture with chopped up bacon into the skillet and put the whole thing into the oven as directed. My husband loved it!

I followed the directions using Canadian Bacon. The aroma while baking was wondeful, using a glass dish I reduced the temperature as one should when baking with glass as well as the dish was done in 45 minutes. Everyone at our luncheon raved about the appearance and taste. Definitely should be served after baking, rewarming the dish wasn't quite as good as the day it was made.

Used half the bacon (and it was not Irish bacon, either)and didn't add any extra fat. Instead, I poured a little melted butter (just enough to cover the base) into muffin pans (which cuts the cooking time is cut in half. It was delicious. A jazzed-up Yorkshire pud which we ate cold for a picnic brunch the next day and found it was still really good.

Made this for an Irish-themed party. Extremely easy to make and delicious. Decreased the amount of bacon -- and grease -- and it was still good.

Everyone must try it. Definitely a wintry, stormy night kind of dish. Very easy to make and if you call it by its english name the kids will eat it for sure.
