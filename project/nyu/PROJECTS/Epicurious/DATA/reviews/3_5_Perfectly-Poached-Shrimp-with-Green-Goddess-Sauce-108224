You must make the sauce a day before so it ferments. DELICIOUS. And the poached shrimp was perfecto! Not overcooked.

I thought the dressing was tasty enough, especially with a couple of shakes of Tabasco sauce mixed in. The shrimp were tender, but turned out a bit soft for my taste.

Excellent sauce...added a little more garlic as per reviews...must use fresht shrimp. Used anchovy paste and turned out great!

Made these as an appetizer at a large dinner party and the raves came pouring in. The sauce is very tasty and cooking the prawns rather than buying them cooked makes a world of difference.

Used store bought cooked shrimp. The sauce was perfect with lots of flavor. Used the leftover sauce the following day with carrot and celery sticks. Outstanding!

Added a little extra garlic and it was a hit for our last party! Would definitely make again-- even people who "don't like anchovies" loved it.

A WINNER! My husband and friends couldn't get enough! The sauce is excellent although I added a dash of cayenne pepper since we like spicy food. I used good quality frozen peeled and deveined shrimp and the result was very good. An impressive appetizer.

I added par-boiled green beans & asparagas to dip in the sauce which provided nice color contrast to the shrimp. I used two cloves of garlic, giving the sauce a nice bite (not boring!). Served a red cocktail sauce alongside for the purists... also the shrimp was nice & juicy prepared this way...

Very boring sauce. Definately not the best choice for pairing with shrimp. Or at least not the most exciting.

Very nice shrimp and the sauce is very good. BTW Bill S., the tails are left on to be used as a handle since these are intended to be eaten without a fork.

I thought the sauce was excellent- although I cut down on the anchovies (used 4 which was plenty) and didn't have tarragon. I think this sauce would complement a lot of dishes- I used it with crab and artichokes as well.

Loved it, except why do recipes say leave the tails on the shrimp? You can't eat them. This a major pet peeve of mine, why would anyone want to have to go through the trouble of removing the tails while eating the dish? Please don't tell me the tails add flavor, that's absurd.

I made this for a party and had several requests for the recipe. One person thought everything else on the table ought to be dunked in the sauce! Definitely a keeper. Try it as a sauce for a hamburger... devine!

I only made the sauce to serve with poached salmon. In one word it was.... FANTASTIC.

Contrary to the above remarks, I have to say this is a delightful sauce, I made about 1/2 of the recipe of sauce -I could have made 2 cups, we just loved it, served melon balls on the plate along with the shrimps, a keeper in our house.

The only thing perfect about this recipe is the poaching directions. The shrimp turned out fantastic (make sure you use kosher salt) but I was disappointed with the sauce. I think it needs more scallions and chives and less parsley and tarragon. Green Goddess fans will need to tweak the sauce recipe.
