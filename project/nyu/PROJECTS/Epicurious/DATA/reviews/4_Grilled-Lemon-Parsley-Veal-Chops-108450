Absolutely delicious. Wish I could make it 5 stars. Used bone-in chops and served with the recommended Saffron Rice and Red Pepper Pilaf and a salad.

This was really good. I used pork chops rather than veal but the marinade worked well with them too and the chops were so moist when I took them off the BBQ. I served with a green salad for a lovely summer evening meal--and a Nectarine-Raspberry Strudel for dessert.

Consistently great. Serve to guests and they'll welcome the change from steak or chicken. You will, too.

Very exceptional. Have made it several times.

Super easy, with big flavors. Paired with the saffron rice pilaf and thought they were both worth making again. Didn't change a thing. Yum!

How can something so easy taste so delicious? The marinade makes the chops very tender, and I, being in my usual rush, only marinaded for two hours at room temperature. This is an excellent veal chop recipe and very quick.

The marinade in this recipe is amazing. Once I made it the first time, I use that marinade for all other meats and fish as well. Once I did not have time to marinade for very long and just grilled the veal straight up and it was still unbelievable. Additionally, I buy veal porterhouse chops and cut the tenderloin and remaining meat off the bone. This makes for a fancier meal presentation if desired.

Delicious and with eye appeal too! Everyone at the table enjoyed it. I also used my George Foreman grill, on the highest setting. The juice drains off into a drip pan, so I collected it and poured it over the chops when I served them. We will want to eat this again!

Great fresh combo of lemon, garlic and herbs. Use bone-in chops. Chop topping garlic really fine or use a press.

Really delicious and easy but not inexpensive.

I made this last night for a dinner party and it was great. Used rib chops, which are pricey, but worth it. Also made the saffron rice and did haricots vert for color. The presentation was beautiful, if I do say so myself.

Fantastic. Paired it with the Saffron Rice as suggested. A huge hit! For veggie, halved zucchini and summer squash length-wise, lightly brushed w/ extra virgin olive oil and grilled cut side down next to chops for last five minutes. Paired with a '97 Brunello, and served pool-side. A perfect evening!

Yes! Do use the rib chop if posible and make the rice and a romaine salad as suggested. Beyond compare. Simple colorful and delicious.

Simple and wonderful. I've made this recipe 3 or 4 times now and its always great. I think the key is to use the rib chop, its just so much more tender than the loin chop.

just not good enough, I had prime veal rib chops and followed this recipe to a T. too much raw garlic in the topping and no sauce. skip it.

Fantastic! My husband loved this veal dish. I substituted summer savory for the Italian parsley, based on what I had on hand, and it was delicious!

This recipe is easy to make and the veal chops came out PERFECT! Tender and juicy with just the right seasonings. The 2 veal chops cost $28! But absolutely worth it!

Would rate this more like 3 and 3/4 forks. I prepared this twice, once with veal loin chops and once with veal rib chops, and I reccommend the rib chops. The flavor is full and delicious and reminiscent of it's heartier cousin, Osso Bucco. Paired with saffron rissotto, it is the Florida answer to rich food that can be served during our hot and humid summers.

Excellent, excellent, excellent. I am able to get wonderful veal chops from a local restaruant and am always looking for new ways to prepare them. I prepared this dish for my supper club and we all loved the light, fresh summer taste.

Unfortunately we can't veal chops where we live. I made the recipe with veal loin. The flavors were great but the cut of meat was a little fatty.

I cook many lovely meals, but this dish was so luscious that my husband could not stop thanking me for making it. We now believe that the $50 we paid for two rib chops was a bargain. This is the recipe to make for the one or ones you love most.

I am an Executive Chef at a hunt club in north Florida and have been looking for some new ideas for entrees. I played with the recipe slightly to add my Club's flair and I got rave reviews. I did not change the marinade but did change the seasonings from just salt and pepper to a Key West type of seasoning.

This was DELICIOUS! I made the entire menu, melon brochettes, veal, rice and pie per the recipe listed, which is a first for me to follow a recipe to the letter. I served it at a dinner party then took the recipe with me to make dinner for friends in the East. I will definitely make this again and again.
