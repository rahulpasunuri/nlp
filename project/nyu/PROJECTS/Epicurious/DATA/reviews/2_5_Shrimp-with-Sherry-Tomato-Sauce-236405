We can't eat onions in our home, so I used this recipe (and the comments) as a guideline. To substitute for the sweetness and depth of the onion, I processed 6 cloves of garlic, half a carrot, a stalk of celery, and a bunch of raisins. I sauteed that and then added the tomatoes. I had a fresh tomato that I added to the 28oz can. The sauce needed a lot of salt, but the shrimp and sauce were delicious on spaghetti.

My family loves this recipe. I use 2 cans of diced tomatoes and extra sherry and garlic. Have everything ready to go, because it cooks very quickly. I make it regularly.

The balance of ingredients seemed out of whack to me. I added more salt, more pepper and more sherry., tasting as I went. It's better the next day and it's really tasty and dinner guests loved it.

This was such a disappointing recipe. It was flavoroless and lacked any luster. I was embarassed to serve it, even though I only served it to my husband. I took other people's suggestions and added more spices and some cinnamon but it did not help. It was a waste of shrimp and sherry.

This sauce is very similar to classic Spanish tomato sauce for cooking fish and shrimp. Simple in design and preparation but a great taste.

this was alright. it was simple and quick to prepare. but it was nothing special. it was like a cheap knock-off of Veracruz sauce (love the 'Red Snapper, Veracruz Style' recipe from this site). it probably would have tasted better with some tweaking...add parsley, raisins, dash of cinnamon. but it would just be easier to make the sauce from the Veracruz recipe and add some sherry to it. this one was rejected from my recipe file.

Make this! We used port instead of sherry b/c we had it and omited olives (husband hates them). Added a touch of flat leaf parsley. This was a fabulous recipe, tasty and easy, that we used as a starter for chateau briand. The remainder of the sauce would be fabulous over pasta.

Not quite beyond compare (at least when I made it) but delicious by all accounts. Will make it again, increasing the sherry a bit, dicing my olives finer and perhaps cutting back on the pepper (a favorite spice of mine) just a tad. Recipe does take a bit longer in preparation, especially since it cooks quickly. Definitely a keeper.

This is a simple, not as quick as advertised, recipe. But it tastes good and is a change from the usual shrimp concoctions.

It was very good. I added a little extra garlic. I'd make it again
