Rushing to have this finished in 35 min., put chicken in pan with olive oil on high heat, covered, turned over after a few minutes. Meanwhile blended 1 onion, 1 can diced organic tomatoes, sugar, juice of 2 regular limes, curry, garlic and ginger; omitted water and tomato paste. Tossed that mixture in with chicken; cooked total of 35 min. Served with combo rice. Very good; will make again; saved the leftover sauce for another dish.

Not sure what happened but I tired of this dish within a couple of bites. I don't think I'll make this again.

And oh, I made the steamed rice with some salt, half a cinnamon stick, a couple of cardamom pods, and a couple of cloves. I added 1/2 cup frozen peas to it as it was close to being done.

Based on the reviews, I made this dish with some extra ingredients that would impart more flavor to it. I added one tomato, cut in half and then sliced. I also added 1/2 tsp of garam masala, 1/2 tsp of chilli powder, and a couple of lime leaves. I used regular limes instead of key limes since the latter was not available at my organic grocery store. I ended up removing the sliced limes mid-way in the last step as the sauce was getting bitter. I also added another tsp of sugar, just in case. Verdict: it was really flavorful (if I may say so)! :-) Only drawback: the left-over today is a bit dry, so be careful not to evaporate too much liquid while making it. Thank you.

I made this recipe last week and was very disappointed. Key limes are one of my favorite fruits to cook with, so I had high expectations. My husband and I both found it very bland, despite the curry powder and onion/ginger paste. I would not recommend this recipe.

I made this in the morning, stuck in the fridge and reheated for dinner: very easy and surprisingly complex flavors. I would add more sliced key limes, but halved also so you get more bites of them. I probably should really have made my own curry powder and didn't, so the curry flavor was a little milder than I might have liked (have read that pre-mixed curry powders are generally too heavy on the turmeric and cumin).

I just decided to look for something quick and I happened to have almost all the ingredients. I really liked it but I had to substitute a regular lime because I didnt have a milder key lime. I'll definitely try to get a key lime next time. Also, while the flavor was really great, I think I might add a few red pepper flakes or a couple shakes of hot sauce to give it a little bit of zip. Oh, and I added some basil to the paste, since I thought it'd go well with the other ingredients, and it did.
