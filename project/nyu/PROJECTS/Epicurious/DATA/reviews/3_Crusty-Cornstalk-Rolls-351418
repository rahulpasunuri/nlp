Very good, though I'd call it bread more so than rolls. See my entire review at: http://themomchef.blogspot.com/2009/12/crusty-cornstalk-rolls-from-gourmet.html.

just a thought....maybe using only 3/4 cup water (total) would make the dough manageable? I checked other bread recipes and for this one the water-to-flour ratio seems way too high.

Great flavor and texture....BUT...the dough was way too soft and collapsed too easily. The sections oozed together and the baked loaf was one large mass only 1/2 inch tall. Taste/texture were terrific but shape didn't hold so I don't think I'll make this again.

These were easy to make, and did have a nice crust and interesting, chewy texture. I'm a relatively inexperienced bread-maker, and have had a lot of yeast-bread failures, but these came out pretty good. They were a tiny bit heavy, and my "ears" sort of fused together, but everyone was very impressed. I might add a little bit more honey next time, but these are tasty and easy.

The dough was rather sticky so I had to work quickly kneading and used more flour than I thought I would. The final product was tasty. Chewy interior, nice crust. Most of my rolls stuck back together during baking too. The bread looked exactly like the picture on the cover buit nothing like the pictures inside. I think you would need a very large baking sheet in order to keep the rolls seperated. I would definitely make the rolls again.

Made this recipe for guests. I, too, found that the 'branches' oozed back together after being separated. The taste and texture was great with a vegetable cassoulet. In the future, I may put an egg wash on the top of the bread in order to make it look shiny as it sits on the table.

I separated the rolls, as specified, but they oozed back together and I didn't think the taste was particularly good. They might be better the second time but I don't think I will try this recipe again.
