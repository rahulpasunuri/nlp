This mostarda is JUST EXCEPTIONAL. Seriously special. Definitely spicy from all the red pepper, and definitely sweet from the grapes and sugar. The onion, vinegar, and mustard give it a seductive tanginess, and the other background flavors add layers of complexity. This is not for the faint of palate. A little of this goes a long way (you could probably halve the recipe), but I wonder if my guests will be fighting over it? If they like it half as much as my boyfriend and I did, just on a cracker, they certainly will be. Note: I only had 1.5 Lbs of grapes, so after simmering 30 minutes, the liquids still hadn't thickened properly (not enough pectin). I added about 1 T cornstarch in a slurry, and it became sticky and thick and just perfect.
