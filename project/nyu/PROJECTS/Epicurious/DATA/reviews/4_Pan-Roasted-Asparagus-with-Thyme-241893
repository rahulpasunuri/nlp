I was skeptical of this recipe - so simple. But it is now my favorite asparagus recipe. You must use a fleur de sal. I also used lemon thyme from my garden so it had a hint of lemon!

I love asparagus. Easy recipe. Couldn't taste the thyme. I would use more next time and maybe a dash of lemon.

This is so good! I don't usually like asparagus, but this recipe really highlights how great this vegetable really is. I cooked the asparagus for about 30 minutes on low so that they were pretty charred. Other than that I followed the recipe.

Utterly simple, and utterly divine. When asparagus is in season, there is nothing simpler -- the pan roasting brings out more complex flavours than simply steaming. I used lemon-thyme. A keeper.

asparagus never tasted so good. i used smoked grey salt the first time i tried this and it was quite delicious.

This recipe is amazing. The asparagus was so good, and my kitchen smelled of the herbs for the whole next day! It was fantastic. I will cook my asparagus like this from now on. served with the herbed balsamic chicken with blue cheese recipe, best meal I ever made!

I made this dish last night and it was a huge hit. It was the side dish to my Pork Tenderloin with Pears & Thyme (on this site) so it was nice that I got to use the fresh thyme in both recipes. I cooked the asparagus a bit longer than it called for because they weren't browning enough. Other than that I followed the recipe and there wasn't a single piece left when dinner was over!

I love roasted asparagus, but these came out perfectly cooked and in far less time. My boyfriend said they were the best asparagus he'd ever had!

Simple to make in almost no time at all. Serve hot though, that is important!! I only used the front half of the spears, wasting plenty.

This is a simple, solid dish. And EASY. I made it for a dinner party to accompany a beef tenderloin. It is a simple dish and can be prepared at the last minute. Because it is cooked on the stovetop, it will not disrupt anything going on in the oven. I made it about an half hour before we ate, and it kept nicely in a covered plan.

While the ingredients of this recipe are right, the cooking method is wrong: it comes out MUCH more flavorful if you actually roast the asparagus in a hot (400) oven, rather than saute it. Do strip the leaves off the thyme and toss it with the asparagus along with the melted butter and olive oil. Then spread it out on a non-stick pan and roast for about 10-15 minutes. This is our favorite way to eat asparagus! And it's so easy. Just watch it carefully, so you don't overcook it - the time it will need depends on the thickness of the spears. You want it to be tender but crisp - the last thing you want is mushy asparagus.

Delicious!

Great flavor. However, there was too much fat for my taste. I would have done 1 tbsp. butter and 1 tbsp. olive oil. Also, it did not specify if you should take the thyme off of the stems, and I suggest that you do, rather than leaving it on the stem.
