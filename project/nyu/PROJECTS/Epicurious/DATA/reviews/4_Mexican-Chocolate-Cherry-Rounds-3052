I made these gluten free dairy free with cornstarch, Earth Balance and a scant half teaspoon of xantham gum. Also added a little almond flavoring, tequila and a tiny bit of chipotle powder and Mole spice mix. They are great and so pretty. I can't wait for my husband to come home and try them!

I've made these twice. The first time I made the following changes: I omitted the cloves, doubled the cayenne, instead of maraschinos I simmered dried cherries in rum to get them soft and used those instead (yummy!). I tried rolling them in cocoa but they ended up looking burnt (but tasted ok). I wanted to use this for a cookie exchange but it took forever to roll them into balls and they needed more rum soaked cherries The second time I omitted the cloves again, used half cayenne and half chipotle powder (subtle and good). I simmered one cup of dried cherries in rum until they were plump and most of the rum was absorbed, then added this to the batter. Then I then rolled the dough into tubes and chilled it. Then making the cookies was easy! Just sliced and coated in icing sugar. I made bigger ones and had to cook them a bit longer. Delicious!

Amazingly delicious! I made these exactly as the reciped described, except I used a whole cherry instead of cutting them in half. They turned out perfectly. These will be come a regular Christmas cookie for me. I thought the amount of cayenne called for was just right to give an interesting "bite" to the cookies, but in a very subtle way. Love these!

I personally loved these, however because the group I served them to the reception was a 50% 50% result. But that is personal taste. The texture is chewy and SOOOO decadent chocolate. If you like dark chocolate these are a perfect chocolate cookie base, with or without the spice. I will make them again!

Easy! Quite a stiff batter but not unworkable. Used maraschinos and agree - I'd use more cayenne. You can taste it in the batter, not so much in the cookie. I used 1/4tsp - would increse to 1/2 next time. Omitted cloves based on CA recommendation and am glad I did. Would work with a cocoa roll vs. the powdered sugar for giggles.

I found that 1/4 tsp. cayenne was a bit much. Delicious cookies, but if I made these again, I'd probably cut the cayenne in half. I also didn't put the cherries on top. I used blanched, slivered almonds. In retrospect, I think the cookies probably would have been better off if I'd used the cherries, since the sweetness would have helped to cut the spiciness.

I made these cookies for a cinco de mayo party a few years ago and people still talk about them! I topped the cookies with cinnamon redhots instead of the cherries and they tasted great! The non-sweet lovers in the room even went back for seconds! Definately make double the recipe as they won't be around for long!

These cookies are wonderful. The cayenne adds a suble spiciness. My daughter made these TWICE for Spanish class and the cookies disappeared in minutes. We had no problem with batter, and both times rolled them into balls right out of the mixer without refrigerating. We don't even top them with cherries, etc. Just roll them up, roll them in sugar and bake. These are wonderful and foolproof!

I made this for extra credit in Spanish Class... they were all gone. Very very good!

Three forks, for delicious! They were very chocolatey, although I doubled the cayenne, and everyone liked them, I thought that next time I will add a little more cayenne yet, and eliminate the cloves to make them more Mexican and less of a spice cookie.

These are my new favorite cookie! The dough did get super tough in the fridgerator, so I just heated it in the microwave for about 30 seconds and had no problems after that.

Yummy cookies! Everyone loved them. I used maraschino cherries as well. Next time, I will increase the cayenne pepper amount to 1/4 teaspoon. Didn't have any problems with the dough.

Surprise hit at Christmas last year, I made about 3 dozen and the went FAST. I'm still thinking of these spicy-sweet cookies! Yes, the dough was stiff but still ok to work with. I'll be making these by the dozens this year again.

I found the dough was extremely stiff...I could barely mix in the last bit of flour. Did anyone else experience this? In any case, they turned out quite nicely with a half a maraschino (be sure to drain well before using) or blanched almond topping them off. The flavour definitely improves a day or two after they are baked.

I made these cookies and everyone loved them so much that I ended up makeing 10 dozen for Christmas. I am bringing them to a cookie exchange party. I used maraschino cherry halves instead of candied cherries. I also used 1/2 teas of cayanne instead of 1/4. and after rolling the dough into balls I made a thumb print in the cookie to put the cherry in.

These are wonderful cookies! I would not use candied cherries again, i will use fresh cherries or nuts. The cookie turns out soft and very tasty!

These cookies are some of the best I have ever made. And I am a cookie addict! I substituted dried tart cherries, instead of the discusting candied ones. I will try one of your reveiwers idea of mixing them in next time. Delicious

I substituted chopped dried bing, rainier, and tart cherries for the candied ones and mixed them in with the dough. Perfect!

I made these to include in "Feliz Navidad" baskets for friends this year. The cookies were great. I upped the cayenne as suggested by another writer and preferred them with a pistachio instead of the candied cherry.

Don't know what Toronto reviewer is talking about...I love these. I made dozens of Christmas cookies this year and these are by far my favorites. I did increase the cayenne to a generous 1/4 teaspoon and could even do 1/2 next time. I'll make these very year.

These were OK, but not as good as the other reviewers seem to have thought. They certainly had an interesting, pleasant taste. I think I will try a few other recipes before I try these again.

I made these cookies for a fund-raiser dinner for missions in Mexico. We had a visiting pastor from Mexico and these cookies were a huge hit. Everybody loved them and I had several requests for the recipe. They are nice and spicy. I made them two weeks before the event and froze them. They seemed to be spicier than the day I made them. I would definately make these again.

Wonderful Cookie....a great surprise to bite into! I served them as part of a desert tray to a group of special friends at my annual ladies Christmas luncheon and got great compliments. They must be made at least a day in advance however, to develop the most special taste. I tried one after baking and was not impressed, but the next day was "Wow".

My favorite holiday gift cookie! I'm not crazy about the candied cherries, although they look pretty. I make another version of the cookie with slivered toasted almonds, chopped pepitas (roasted pumpkin seeds), and orange zest in the middle.

I had wonderful comments about the cookies. I made them without the cherries and there was no difference. They are great if you like spice cookies with a touch of chocolate.

very good, the cayenne is a nice touch. It also adds a little fun to the season trying to get people to guess what the flavoring is, noone gets it.

These are one of my favourite Christmas cookies to make. They are very chocolatey and the cayenne pepper adds a little zing.

Fabulous! The cookie is not too sweet and the cayenne pepper adds a wonderful kick to the after taste. I would make this again and again...texture reminds me of an Italian coffee cookie, only soft.

This is an okay cookie...easy to make but nothing special about it.
