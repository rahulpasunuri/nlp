A really simple way to make chicken, looks beautiful, crispy skin and moist inside -- it's a keeper! You can see my photos here: http://www.20somethingcupcakes.com/2011/10/tuscan-style-peppered-chicken/

This is SO easy and good. I didn't brine and ended up needing to broil it longer than stated in order to get the skin crispy, but the chicken was still insanely moist. I made a delicious, peppery broth with the leftovers.

I'm a believer. I admit that I was skeptical but no more. I used bone-in chicken breasts and brined them in a simple brine for 24 hours. They were oozing juices! Fantastic. I'm sold. Definitely company-worthy as well.

I've never met a recipe that turns out so spectacular with so little effort. I make this regularly for guests and it never fails to impress.

I've made this recipe multiple times. It has turned out great each time. The more pepper the better! Also, I occasionally add hot sauce to spice things up. I dab the skin with a paper towel and this gives an almost fried effect.

I've made this several times, including for company, and it's always delicious. This is as fool-proof of a chicken recipe as I've ever seen, and it lends itself to immense variety. Heartily recommended!

I must admit to being a bit skeptical about the reviews considering the simpicity of this recipe. It was fabulous. I used chicken breasts and brined them for 4 hours beforehand. It was a great simple meal for a Friday evening simple dinner party with friends along side a lemon pasta.

This dish is as delicious as it is easy to prepare!

The skin did not come out crispy enough for me. Next time I try, I will increase the amount of time it cooked skin side up. The flavor was nice and it did come out very moist.

This is scrumptious! I soaked my chicken pieces (very large breasts and leg quarters) overnight in salted water to which I added about 1 tsp. Tabasco. I rubbed the chicken pieces with olive oil and the freshly cracked pepper a couple of hours ahead of grilling them, adding salt just after the oil-pepper rub. This is good, good chicken!

Crushed Peppercorn Melange (a mixture of black, white, pink, and green peppercorns) for a delicious change. Wasn't quite finished in the time specified; cut off thighs and roasted skin-up for another 10 minutes. Perfectly juicy & tender!

Very good. We grilled it and used leg quarters.

We love this recipe. We use coarse Kosher salt and lots of coarse ground pepper. Most of our dinner guests are dubious about the lemon, but we coax them to use it, and they end up loving it. It's a simple dish that is great for company.

This is an excellent recipe. Very simple, but delicious. Being pepper fanatics, we add much more pepper. Have made it for company several times, and it has always been a hit.

It's a LOT of chicken for each person -- I'd recommend using smaller chickens if you can get them (maybe 2.5 or 3 pound). Use fresh pepper if you can and really pile it on.

I've made this three times and its been great each time. I use breast quarters instead of chicken halves; I go wild with the pepper; and I cook it on the grill instead of broiling it. If you like black pepper, you'll love this recipe.

It is fairly bland, but you know, if you like pepper, then this is good. Needs to be served with a lightly sauced pasta verde.
