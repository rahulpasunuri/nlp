This is very rich and you don't need to take a large piece, but it is wonderful! I'm not a big fan of fruit and chocolate, but I make an exception with this dessert.

Everyone loves this every time I make it. Making the clementines is a little time consuming, but worth it.

Love the tart but the clementine peels take some time to make, I just add clementine juice for the orange flavor it is great.

Love the flavors and have made this 3 times and found I could double the recipe for the clementine peel and it keeps for weeks submerged in the syrup. The only thing keeping me from giving this the 4th fork was the tendency for the chocolate to separate - not too badly with the Scharffenberger but rather noticeable with the 70% Ghiradelli. A dusting of cocoa powder should disguise the problem but it is curious why this happens.

This was a fabulous dish. I agree the candied peel was a bit labor intensive, but I let mine sit in a airtight container for one day before trying to chop it. I also used oranges instead of clementines as they were not available. The chocolate and the orange work together well, but not quite enough flavor for me. I will use either more orange peel, or maybe add a teaspoon of orange essence to the chocolate next time.

I am surprised at how much I liked this dessert. A friend of mine made this and I didn't expect to be impressed. It wasn't very pretty, but the rich chocolate mixed with the candied clementine peels was a real treat. Very tasty. I hope to try making it myself but some of the reviews have me nervous.

I found that this labor intensive recipe produced nothing more than a large round candy bar. Fortunately I had 2 other desserts at my party.

Sadly, this did not turn out. The chocolate separated, so I had to begin again. Even then, the mixture was grainy, and I don't have trouble working with chocolate normally. The candied clementines were great by themselves after they actually hardened, but this took hours and hours even after more sugar, turning, etc. The candy-like aspect of the whole dessert was simply too much. It was served at a holiday buffet alongside a chocolate caramel tart. Only one piece was taken -- the other was gone.

Awesome. Transcendent. Mind-blowing. I usually dislike chocolate-fruit combinations, but in this case I must say that the clementine peel really enhances the taste of the chocolate, and vice versa. The crust is a good choice, too--the homely, crunchy wheatiness of it provides a perfect foil to the intense flavors of the filling. Candying the peel was the hardest part, and not so muh hard as just a little time-consuming; the tart itself couldn't be easier.

YES! YES! YES! This was AMAZING! I can't say enough about this - use the best chocolate (I used Sharffen Barger), and you will be rewarded with an intense chocolate experience. The combination of chocolate and citrus is wonderful, and the candied clementine peel is good enough to munch on its own. I'll also use this crumb crust in other recipes - the wheat biscuits were a nice change from graham crackers.
