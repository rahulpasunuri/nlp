I'm sure this would have been much better had I a corer that didn't slice. I ended up having to slice the apples, then threw them into the dish with a bit more OJ. Was a bit watery and didn't cook evenly, but I'm definitely going to try this again once I get the right equipment.

Great, simple recipe. Agree with previous reviewer that filling is enough for 4 apples. I cut the filling in 1/2 when making for two.

Delicious! This is an easy, relatively healthy dessert -- I serve it topped with vanilla frozen yogurt. The filling will fill 3-4 apples easily, rather than the two specified.
