I made these with a friend today. The recipe was a bit dry even after combining the wet and dry ingredients, so I added more buttermilk. I also added an extra tbsp of sugar along with extra mint extract and vanilla. I actually tasted the batter just to see how it might turn out, and thats how I concluded that more sugar and extract was needed. All in all, they were well worth it! I served them with whipped cream and strawberries, and they were delicious!
