Not sure if my chicken was thicker or buger pieces, but it was undercooked and required additional heating. To avoid burning, I heated in the oven. Flavor was good. Added parmesan and lemon zest to panko mix.

Any health nut will fall in love with this dish! From Brunch, to Lunch, to Cinner you can't go wrong. The components complement one another in a symphony of flavor. For a twist you can add diced mango, or mandarine oranges in place of the cherry tomatoes.

Great easy weeknight dinner. Sometimes to mix it up I add some sliced fresh pair and shaved parmesan.

This is a good recipe. I don`t know if I would make it for company, but for a weeknight family dinner it's great. I used thyme and rosemary out of the garden instead of oregano and parsley; I think several different fresh herbs would work here, and as suggested, added lemon zest and a bit of parmesan to the breadcrumb mixture. I will be making this again.

Added parm to panko as suggested for flavor. Nothing special, but simple dish that should be served with something very flavorful such as "Spicy Spinach Linguine"

I made this for dinner for my grown sons and my husband and they loved it. No arugula at my grocery so I made a tomato salad of halved cherry tomatoes with some fresh basil, olive oil and garlic and it went really well. Definitely will make it again.

Delicious recipe, fast and filling. There is no need for adding anything else.

Wish I could give this 3.5 forks-- it was very good. I really liked the fresh herbs with the panko. I made the lemon dressing, also made homemade balsamic-- either were delicious on the salad over chicken. Will definitely make again.

I've made this countless times for guests and it always turns out great! The only change I make is that I don't cook the chicken all the way in the skillet. I finish it in a baking pan at 350 for 20 minutes or so. I also buy the hand fileted chicken breasts.

Good and fast. Heat needed to be a little warmer than medium.

Great recipe! I made this recipe as it was suggested in the Bon Appetite magazine. The magazine recommends serving the chicken over "Spicy Spinach Linguine with olive oil and garlic" instead of Arugula leaves is a great meal. The recipe for the spinach linguine can also be found on epicurious. I follow the recipe exactly and wouldn't consider doing it any other way.

Outstanding version of chicken milanese! The use of panko is a great idea. This combination of the Spicy Spinach Linguine and the Lemony Chicken Milanese with Argula Salad is my go-to meal for quick dinners and impromptu parties -- and it has always been a big hit.

Loved it! Use a food processor to grind up fresh breadcrumbs with the oregano, lemon zest and parsely. Excellent and easy dish. Make it with the linguini recipe that pairs so well with this chicken.

Very, very good. I, too, added lemon peel and parmesean to the bread crumbs. Definitely boosts the flavor. Good to find a recipe kids and adults alike enjoy.

This dish was super easy to make and oh so tasty! I couldn't find fresh oregano (out in the boonies) but i had dried on hand so I used that. The chicken was cooked perfectly and it was crispy! My grandpa gave rave reviews which doesn't come often! I served it with a homemade bolognese with penne pasta. oh it was soo good! i won't hesitate to try this dish again and again!!

Chicken Milanese is one of my favorite dishes; I made some adjustments to this one (baked at 450 on Silpat v. panfrying). Added parm and lemon rind to the bread crumbs and basil, grape tomatoes and a little avocado to the salad. Made a lemon/olive oil dressing for the arugula to take up the tartness a notch. I enjoyed this as a light dinner with an Italian white wine and angel food cake, balsamic strawberries and marscarpone whipped cream as dessert. Yummy!

I just made the chicken breast as described and it turned out perfectly. Didn't do the salad thing. Dropping the lemon component would make this excellent with a good marinara sauce.

Very good, light, flavorful. I do like to jazz up the salad a bit.

I wish I had paid attention to what other reviewers said about this recipe being on the plain side. I think parmesan would have been great in the chicken, and maybe next time I will experiment with other additions, too, to spice it up a little.

Good and easy. The arugula is surprisingly nice on top. Don't be shy about squeezing plenty of lemon juice on the chicken. I, too, added parmesan to the panko. Will make again.

Very quick and tasty! I also made a few changes. I used whole wheat panko and added a bit o grated parm to the breading, then cooked it i the george forman grill. For the greens, I used baby spinach, truffle infused oil instead of olive, and added some lemon zest. It was fresh tasting without being too crazy, and was sooo easy and quick. I will definately be makng this often.

I made this recipe for one. The first time, I found it a bit plain. The second time, I added freshly grated parmesan to the panko mix. I used the lemon juice more liberally on the cooked chicken. I prepared a full cup of arugula with 1/2 tbs. of fine extra virgin olive oil for the salad. The result was very good.

Light and delicious. I agree with others about tossing some lemon in with the arugula and definitely using fresh oregano. I dipped the chicken in flour, then egg, then the panko mix. I find that you get more of the coating to stick that way. I also mixed some lemon zest into the panko mixture. I was cooking 6 pieces of chicken, so I cooked three at a time and put in a 200 degree oven until the rest were finished. THEN I sprinkled them with the lemon juice. I thought it kind of "woke them up" after they had sat in the oven for a few minutes. I served it with spaghetti with browned butter and myzithra cheese, although the spinach linguine sounded good, too!!

Excellent quick meal for a weeknight. My family loved it.Even my mother-in-law dropped in and couldn't resist joining us.Don't forget the last squeeze of lemon on top of the finished breasts. It really makes a difference.

Excellent light meal. I added some lemon to the arugula as well and it definitely made a difference. Wonderfully refreshing and very quick weeknight meal!

This meal was delicious! I made the salad and the Spinach Linguine....served with wonderful dry riesling. The combination of flavors is fantastic. This one will to into the "dinner guest" file.

Oops! When I said the breading was delicious & didn't stick, I meant it didn't get caught in the pan and tear off the chicken. It adhered beautifully to the chicken when breading. I alsways start anything breaded or coated a little early anyway & let it sit out on a rack for about 10 minuites before cooking. Sorry about any confusion.

Really wonderful and easy! I used three boneless chicken breasts, cut longways into 1-inch wide strips , then pounded to 1/2-inch . The breading was delicious & didn't stick. I followed the recipie exactly and think the fresh oregano helps make it. Once we'd finished dinner tonight & the chicken had gotten a little cold I snuck a bite - WOW! Still crispy only cold and the coating was even more flavorful. It goes wonderfuly with the pasta mentioned and the arugula. I sprinkled some fresh lemon juice & s & p onto the arugula then drizzled the olive oil & mixed. I placed the finished chicken on top of the arugula as a salad alongside the pasta. The tang of the addidtional lemon in the arugula was wonderful with the crispy chicken. A real keeper & going into my permanent file.

I didn't make the salad, just the chicken. The chicken was very easy to prepare and very delicious! I added parmigiano reggiano to the panko breadcrumbs because you can't go wrong with that!

i made this this evening and it was a big hit with my wife and i. it really is very simple and the fresh herbs in the panko plus the lemon juice at the end make all the difference. using chicken tenderloins and pounding them thin gave a great breading to chicken ratio. we served it with the suggested side from bon appetit,'spicy spinach linguine with olive oil and garlic', and it was great. you can find it here: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/237103
