used only one jalapeno because I thought two would be overwhelmingly spicy. Turned out we didn't taste it very much in the soup, so I would recommend to use two after all. interesting twist on an otherwise plain soup. not much orange flavor.

My changes were no zest, and about 3/4 of the onion and half the orange juice. The soup was nice, not amazing...until eating with the swirl of "chutney." (I had used coconut milk instead, and I made it a little on the hot side, so it turned out more like a pesto.) Whoa! it was fantastic! Hot and savory-sweet, very smooth all at the same time. Btw, my chutney was so hot that it was not something you'd eat on your own. Somebody licked the spoon while we were cleaning up and it about blew their head off. Next time I make this, would like to try leaving out the onions as so many of my family have problems digesting onion. Unsure if the flavor would be the same - anyone have some ideas?

This soup is fabulous!! I reduced the orange juice to one cup and left out the orange zest as I was worried the orange flavour would over power the flavour of the squash . I added some grated ginger. I didn't have to strain the soup as my blender does a good job of pureeing and I like a thick soup.

I made this soup for several years after it appeared, including Thanksgiving 1992 in Moscow when the grocery selection was not very broad, but you could find plenty of cilantro. This recipe has always been a hit with my guests.

I made this tonight subbing the coconut milk for some broth, omitting one cup of broth and 1/2 cup of orange juice and it just wasn't what I was hoping. I didn't make the chutney since we just wanted the soup and I was quite disappointed. After we ate some, I added whipping cream to it and it did take the flavor up a notch. I'll try another butternut squash soup recipe next time.

I must have made a mistake because the soup was runny. Other than that it was very flavorful and the kiddies wanted seconds. Loved the little bit of heat from the jalapenos. The next time I make it: I will cut the amount of liquid I add. I will use coconut milk instead of coconut. I will add the chutney to the soup and let it simmer together so that the jalapeno is not so crisp. I will add some zucchinni in order to get a more creamy texture without adding fat.

The orange juice completely overpowered the flavor of the squash. The chutney was excellent, but the soup itself was not edible. I would recommend this to someone I did not like very much.

@wehoffman3 from sapphire, nc Coriander is another name for cilantro. Same plant, but in this case, they definitely mean the leaves and not the seeds. So yes, use cilantro for the chutney. I made this with pumpkin seeds instead of almonds. It was very good. I'm not sure the coconut added too much.

Rating: 3
Full disclosure - I haven't made this yet. The soup sounds wonderful but no one has addressed 2 cups of fresh coriander (seeds?) in the chutney. Is this correct? Or is coriander being confused with cilantro? Please help - 1 is a spice, the other an herb and I'd be lost as to how to find that much fresh coriander.

FABULOUS - my husband and I flipped for this recipe...but with these great substitutions: 16oz Coconut milk for part of Broth (instead of adding yogurt) Thai chilies, not jalapenos Add dried raisins, cherries and cranberries to the chutney We used pine nuts instead of the almonds, but only because our cupboard was bare.

Love this soup. I added 1 large chipotle pepper to the soup and thought it added a nice bit of smoke. I took out the orange zest and used my immersion blender - there is no need to strain. I'll definitely make it again.

We love this soup. Instead of peeling and cutting the squash, I cut it in half, scrape the seeds and strings out, and then roast it cut side down on an oiled baking sheet. When its soft and caramelized, I remove it from the oven and let it cool till I can peel off the skin. It's way more flavorful this way, and also less work. If the squash isn't too sweet (or if I use a different variety of squash), I add some brown sugar at the end, so that the sweetness of the soup contrasts better with the spicy chutney. I also serve it with plain non-fat yogurt or sour cream.

Because of the rave reviews, I'm thinking of making this soup for Thanksgiving this year for the new in- laws. I will not doing a trial run, so I need my first attempt to be spot on. To those who have made the recipe before; would you agree with the following suggestions: 1/2 c. less OJ, add 1/2 c. extra chicken broth, and can I use dried coriander instead of fresh?

Rating: 2
I recommend halving the OJ. But overall, very nice! And to the reviewer who used fresh Hatch chilis, YES! Those are the BEST!

Rating: 4
Being a Green Chili lover I took the opportunity to use fresh Hatch Green Chili's in the chutney. It is a wonderful Recipe! I did add garlic to the soup and used less orange juice.

Rating: 4
This soup is fabulous! I didn't have enough fresh orange juice so I supplemented with juice from the jug. I also substituted cashews for almonds in the chutney, which came out great. I halved the soup recipe but made the full chutney quantity. I think it might be good to double the chutney (if your guests are spice lovers), because we used all of it anyway and loved it. I substituted veggie broth for chicken.

Rave reviews from my guests. The chutney was excellent and added more jalapeno to give it a kick.

Rating: 4
Terrific! Everyone loved it at Thanksgiving... but it's simple to put together. I made two modifications: (a) I roasted the squash instead of boiling it, and (b) I pureed only half the soup, leaving it with some chunks for texture. The `chutney' on top is great.

Rating: 3
I really liked this, but suggest some changes. I nuked the squash for five minutes after poking some holes in it with a fork. I then cut the squash in half, cleaned it and roasted it for about 30 minutes on 350 degrees before peeling and chopping. I also used only one half of one jalapeno chili. I like hot, put half a chili was plenty hot. I suggest reducing the chicken broth to 5 cups to thicken soup a bit. Finally, I suggest adding a spoonful of sour cream to garnish each bowl of soup.

Excellent! Did not use the chutney as I was looking to use up some squash. This is a winner!

Rating: 4
I frequently make this dish for myself and eat leftovers throughout the week. I think to bring in additional texture, color and flavor, a big dollop or 3 of sour cream intensifies the euphoria of this dish. I've also used tangerines in lieu of oranges which give it some extra zing.

Made this with the called-for chicken broth and liked it very much. Has anyone made this with vegetable broth? Hoping to reprise this for vegetarian guests.

This is like nothing you'd expect. The soup is mild and the chutney sends it over the edge. We used 2 jalapenos and it wasn't spicy enough. Yum, it's smooth and crunchy and better if you add more heat. Zesty!

I was really surprised on this one! Subbed cider for oj and added an apple instead of orange peel. Used my own-grown cayenne pepper instead of jalos, it was spicy enuf! The texture of the coconut and almonds masks the grainy squash.

delicious!! a light soup perfect for a first course before a big meal. the chutney adds the perfect amount of heat. i'm not normally a squash fan, but loved this recipe!

Rating: 3
Tried this out for family first before making it for company -- it was great. Even the squash-hater liked it. I thought pureeing it made it a more elegant soup. The chutney (thanks for not calling it pesto) adds up to a lot of heat but together it all combines deliciously; and the little bit that was left over tasted maybe even better the next day. Thanks Epicurious for not discarding this 15-yr old recipe.

I have been making this soup every Thanksgiving for four years, and it gets rave reviews every time I make it. The flavors are bright and lively and practically sing in your mouth. Don't skip the chutney, it makes the dish!

Rating: 4
Have made this a part of our Christmas dinner for a large group and its a huge hit! The chutney is key. The second time I made it, I cut the squash lengthwise, scooped out the seeds and roasted, cut-side down until tender and then scooped it into the pot after the onion is sauteed. Roasting the squash makes it easier to handle and intensifies the flavor. Yummy!!!

this is my new favorite butternut squash soup recipe. the chutney is the kicker -- FANTASTIC!! i prefer my butternut squash soups to be of the puree variety so i didn't bother straining but i've had it both ways and it's delicious in both textures. i HIGHLY recommend.

The soup made a big hit at Thanksgiving for a big crowd. I cut back the orange juice as one cook suggested and was very pleased with the results. The chutney is outstanding. I served the soup with a dollop of whipped yogurt/or sour cream and put a healthy scoop of chutney on top of that for a lovely presentation.

This soup was good. It was light and smooth and the spicy flavors of the chutney mixed well with the fresh orange taste in the soup.

I would make this again, but replace the orange juice with more broth. The orange flavor in it didn't work for me at all. The chutney was awesome. I put some in a white turkey chili I made with leftovers.

I first made this dish when it was published in 1990. It has become a yearly staple at Thanksgiving. I just lost the recipe so had to look it up. The chutney is an important part of the overall taste.

Excellent "starter" soup for fall menus -- an enthusiastic four forks. As another poster said, addition of the chutney makes this recipe rate four forks, without it the soup is still a solid three. I roasted the squash first which made it easier to peel and added a mellow taste. I did strain the soup and found a few strings I guess I missed earlier. TIP: to make the squash easier to cut into chunks, cook for a minute or two in the microwave.

Wonderful soup. It's not a hearty, applesauce-consistency soup (like most butternut swuash soups). Rather, it's smooth, fruity, spicy, and fairly light. For those not in the know (like me), coriander is the same thing as cilantro. Also, I used 2 Fresno chilis instead of jalapenos. And, like others, I didn't strain it. Trust me, don't bother. Even without the chutney, it's a great soup, but with the chutney, the soup goes from 3 forks to 4. It could be served in the finest restaurants (and I wish it would). We're serving it for a Thanksgiving first-course.

This is our favorite soup and we serve it every Thanksgiving. We like to add a dollop of plain yogurt to the soup after the chutney. Just make sure the soup is piping hot.

Wow! This soup was really wonderful, and the chutney was just the right spicy compliment to the soup's sweetness. It's really important not to remove the seeds and veins from the jalepeño peppers, even if you would normally remove them. (I was chicken and removed the seeds and veins, but ended up adding Tabasco to replace the spice.) I also did not strain the soup, and I probably won't strain it in the future. I made it again for company, and everyone loved it! Again, I didn't strain the soup, so instead of messing up a whole blender, I used an imersion blender, which saved a lot of time both cooking and dish washing.

This soup was fan-tabulous! It wasn't heavy like other squash soups that use cream,etc. The chili coriander added the extra umpf, that makes this soup a definite crowd pleaser. I made it for a small dinner party and all that it was the best dish of the meal. I had multiple requests for the recipe. Definitely would make this again.

Rating: 3
This soup is very good but don't make it if you're expecting a warm, spicy, "fall" flavored soup. It has a suprisingly clean, crisp flavor...more like a summer soup. It wasn't what I expected from a fall squash. I made everything the day before I served it and it was wonderful.

Rating: 4
Yummy, delicious, unique. Make it, you won't regret it! The chutney gives it the fourth fork.

One of the best fall soups that I've ever prepared. The coriander chutney is the key. Instead of jalapeno peppers, I used roasted green chile (fresh from New Mexico). I didn't bother to strain it either and it was fine (I didn't understand why that step would be necessary, particularly after putting it through the blender) .

This soup was wonderful. I was looking for a butternut squash soup with more traditional spices (nutmeg, cloves, etc) and instead made this because I read all of the good reviews. If you don't like spicy foods, limit the chutney to just one pepper. I like mine spicy, though. My boyfriend loved this dish as well.

Rating: 3
This is an excellant start for dinner. Despite the simplicity of the recipe, the soup is very flavorful, but not overpowering. The chutney is a must. If you do not like coriander (cilantro) do not worry because the combination of ingredients de-emphasizes the robust taste of the coriander.

made this for thanksgiving this year - raves from all; it will become a staple winter party dish for us!
