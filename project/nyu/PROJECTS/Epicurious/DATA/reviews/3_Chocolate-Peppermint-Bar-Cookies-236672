Thanks for all the suggestions as they were most helpful. When I saw how thick and sticky the batter was, I came back to the site to check out any reviews it see what people had to say because I thought I had a dud recipe on my hands. I'm very please with how these turned out. Here's what I did: added one egg white, 1/2 tsp. peppermint extract, and half of the crushed candy (yes, I had crushed mine finely too). I exchanged the sugar for Spenda abd I always use mini chocolate chips. Spooned it into a greased pan (no foil) and used a fork to spread it around. Topped it with the rest of the crushed candy (I used some candy canes that I've been saving for years!) Since I used a glass dish, I baked it at 350 deg. and for 2 minutes less than the recipe called for. Had to be careful in cutting them... after they were almost cooled down, I pressed my knife into the bars (don't drag the knife), and I just poked the knife blade around the sides to loosen. Let it finish cooling and gently lifted the small squares out of the pan. The crushed candy cane did not sink to the bottom and the sprinked candy on top looks very nice. Next time, I might double the batter (but not the choc. chips) to see how that works. They are addictive! It's a keeper.

I've made three batches of this so far. They're divine -- so rich, chewy, chocolately and minty. The only change I made in the later batches was to nearly double the amount of peppermint candies, and to make sure that I hardly crushed them at all. The pic of this recipe -- I still have the issue of Gourmet it was in -- shows that all the peppermint drifts to the bottom of the cookie, so that was no surprise to me. My husband thinks these are some of the best cookies I've made!

I got really tired of trying to crush the peppermint candies, so I only got about 1/2c and threw in 1/8 tsp of peppermint extract to boost the flavor a bit. I let them cook a little too long, but the center was still good, and I liked the flavor and the idea of it but it was really really chewy. I think the peppermints that I crushed were too fine, and as a result they all melted together at the bottom and made it so chewy. I would ditch the peppermints, stick with just peppermint extract, make it more of a brownie, and add some white chocolate chips for that nice contrast.

I truly do not understand the problems people have with this recipe. It's not deceptively simple to make...it IS simple to make. I've made it more than once, and the only change I made this most recent time was to add a little bit of peppermint extract because I'm a huge peppermint fan. They came out chewy and rich and minty, and I really like them. Also, make sure you use non-Dutch-process cocoa powder if you want a really nice, fudgy taste! Follow as written.

These are horrid. I tried all the hints others gave with the same disappointing results. The peppermints melt to the bottom. They are beyond hard. Great for getting tartar off your teeth though! We ended up throwing most of them out.

I had the same problem with mints as the other reviewers.We nibbled on them but they ended up in the trash.

This recipe was just ok... The peppermint sunk to the bottom and dissapeared. The end result tasted like overcooked, chewy brownies, and it was a tough mess to clean as the mints were all stuck to the bottom of the pan. If I make these again, I will put half of the mints on top. Hopefully, this will make them taste more minty.

These sounded so good but they were uninspiring. They looked nothing like the picture.

Made this per the directions using round ("starlight") mints and they still fell to the bottom and made a tooth-sticking mass. I agree with others that they are not worth the trouble.

This recipe is hard to make (the instructions are deceptively simple) and definitely not worth the trouble.

I made these cookies twice last year and am about to make them again. I used Hammond's "natural" candy canes, which tasted delicious, but did vanish into the cookies. I also used "natural" orange candy canes in my second batch & they were also incredibly tasty. Though these cookies look like ordinary brownies their taste and texture are special. With an ordinary mint like Brachs, they may look prettier, but not taste as good.

We love these cookies. It's true they don't look like the photo, but I've found that if you put half of the mind candies in the batter then sprinkle the other half on top, it looks a little more like the photo.

I'm not jumping up and down for joy about these, but I want to try them again. I found them to be a bit flat and dry, and I regret my choice to use candy canes--next time I will try round peppermints instead. The candy canes disappeared into the cookie. They don't look at all like the photo. Still, these are a fun and interesting change from straight up brownies and I would like to try them again.

This recipe was good, but difficult. first off, i had used candy canes, maybe making the dough stiff. it was very hard to spread, also. Second, the results did not look pretty. The ends were burned, the bars were flat, and they were very chewy! I will make this again, but with some of your tips. Even though I have made this recipe sound negitive, it was very yummy after a little work, and I am excited to gobble down more before my husband eats them all!!!

This is my second year making these cookies. I double the brownie part of the recipe and do about 1 1/2 times the peppermint candies, thenbake for about 30 minutes. I cut them in tiny squares. They are chewy and rich. If you want to make sure that peppermint candy shows up like in the photo use the round peppermints (ala Brachs) and chop them coarsely. I have found theat candy canes melt in completely. Still taste great, but not as visually appealing.

These are a keeper; I have made them several times and everyone loves them. They are VERY rich, though, so cut them in small squares. This has become a staple in my Christmas baking.

What is wrong w/ you people? I have made this recipe 4 times (must have eaten 2 all by myself!), it was very well received by guests, freezes well and is easy to make following the exact instructions. Spreading is easier w/ a moist off-set spatula, but other than that I can't think of a single additional tip to make this easier or better.

I thought these looked awful, nothing like the photo, and everything was done exactly as the recipe called for. The flavor was disappointing too!

I agree with the previous cooks. Mine did not look like the photo either and the dough was hard to spread. I think that was because the candy canes were too splintered! Will try to hit less hard next time and add peppermint extract, too.

I made these for an office holiday party and they disappeared from the dessert table before most people had eaten their main dishes. They tasted great, looked great, and were festive for the holidays. I added peppermint extract for extra flavor. The problem was crushing the peppermint candies. They're hard as rocks, and I took a hammer to them, and marred my table top. I think broken-up candy canes would be easier; will try that next time.

Delicious without being over the top. The dough was very difficult to spread in the pan - I'll double it like another reader. Used Baskin and Robbins choc mint candies (113g bag) which yielded 1/2 Cup and were likely milder tasting that the recipes peppermints.

I thought these were very pretty, and did not have the problems with the dough that others had. The cookies themselves I thought were bland. The melted chocolate and peppermint added some flavor, but they were much prettier than they tasted, and not worth the effort.

These were great! I doubled the recipe in the same size pan, adjusted the baking time a bit... They were a big hit at the office party -- I will definitely make these again! I crushed the peppermints in a plastic freezer bag with a rolling pin...

Great cookies!I made this recipe for a cookie exchange on the 21st and it got raves. My only woe is crushing the candy. I did not find it easy.

Agree with most of the other reviews. Good but not great. I got the batter spread so far, got frustrated and stuck it the oven for 2-3 minutes, and then it was easy to spread. Definitely needs some crushed peppermints on the top to improve appearance. I'd really like to know how the test kitchen got the cookies to look as they are pictured in the magazine!

This is so good! I think you need to add a little peppermint extract to really bring it home, but the crunchy-chewy-sweet-minty combination is yummy!! It is hard to spread, but I found by dropping big spoonfuls around the pan and then pressing them out with wet fingers works well. Also, I'm not sure if you really need the foil, you could probably just grease a pan and be fine. Working with the foil is kind of a pain.

This was a hit for me. As others have said, it is a simple thing - really just a brownie, but with some gooey chocolate chips and some crunchy peppermint. I threw in the whole bag of chocolate chips, instead of using only half (6 oz), and that made for goo-ier brownies, but that was sort of the point. The crushed peppermint makes them difficult to cut, so be ready to use a very sharp knife to cut through the peppermint chunks when slicing up the bars.

I was relieved to see I was not the only one who had trouble with this recipe. My cookies did not turn out at all like the picture. The flavor is good but the texture leaves something to be desired, with bites that are too hard and chewy. My cookies came out slightly greasy as well. Overall I expected more from the delicious-looking magazine photo.

Easy to make but I also had a difficult time spreading them so I used my hands. I used candy canes and put in a ziplock bag & used a meat tenderizer to break candy into pieces. I made these for a cookie swap and I was so dissapointed that the candy was not visible like the picture. They looked like a brownie. I thought I choppedd the candy too small so will try to chop into larger peices next time. I will try this recipe one more time and wil also drizzle with white chocolate. Great idea!!!

i agree with other reviews. The batter is hard to work with, and did not spread easily in the pan. I chaged the recipe a bit, but agree that you can find better recipes.

Well, unlike the last review I really like these bar cookies. They don't need any extra peppermint flavoring. I used William Sonoma's Peppermint Snow (crushed peppermint candy) Mine didn't look like the picutre because the peppermint was so finely crushed. Next time I will try a coarser grind of candy. They are very moist and the combination of chocolate and peppermint are wonderful. The batter is a little hard to press out in the pan....I used the non-stick renolds wrap and that worked great. These will be made each year at my house.

I trusted the recipe coming from Gourmet. I made them in the afternoon to take to a party that evening. The dough was hard to mix and spread onto the pan. In fact, I did not have enough dough for a 9x13 sheet. I was disappointed visually, as they did not look like the photo at all. I was a bit embarrased to take them for my party, but had no alternative. They tasted good, although the cube of butter was apparent. I was disappointed in this recipe and wondered if anyone had tested it at all.

This recipe is not worth the effort. It is just a brownie and not a good looking one. The flavor is good but unremarkable. If you really want to make it add a drop of peppermint extract and cover the whole thing with additional crushed candies (or candy canes), but it is not worth the trouble. A much better choice, and an excellent recipe would be PEPPERMINT AND PECAN CHOCOLATE BARK Bon Appétit, December 2000. This one festive and luscious, a real winner.

This was, as others have said, hard to spread and I thought it was way too thin when I finally got it into the pan and was prepared to be disappointed. But it was delicious. Great crunchy combination of peppermint and chocolate. It was hard to cut and ended up as irregular chunks but that made for a rustic quality that seemed to be part of its visual charm. I personally liked the peppermint in bigger chunks.

Skip this recipe. Greasy and unappealing, we ended up throwing away three quarters of the pan. Get a good brownie recipe instead, replace vanilla with a little peppermint extract and top with crushed peppermints.

Made 2 batches for a cookie exchange and here's what I learned: better the second day, better with mints not so finely crushed (though mine still never looked like the picture) and lastly, these are not pretty cookies by any means. I had to do something so I melted some white chocolate with just a drop of two of peppermint extract and drizzled it over the cookies. It really helped the presentation and in the end these cookies were well received by the guests.

I was disappointed by this recipe--it was very sweet and more like candy than a bar cookie. Chewy and a little greasy--decent flavor but the texture isn't right. If you want to make a chocolate peppermint cookie, I would recommend making the chocolate peppermint sandwich cookies, also on this site: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/233372 You can save the fixings separately and assemble as you need the cookies over the holiday season.

This was super easy. Although I crushed my peppermints too fine, so it didn't turn out like the picture. My hubby said it tasted like a box of brownies with some candy canes mixed in. It didn't have the "wow" taste but I would make it again.

A fantastic, easy-to-make holiday cookie that taste even better the next day. Just make sure you finely crush the peppermint candies to avoid overly-crunchy bites.

I found these these so very easy to make. They were full of chocolate and peppermint flavor! I found the easiest way of spreading is to wet the back of a tablespoon and spread gently, works like a charm. Hope to make more for Xmas gifts.

This is fabulous -- crunchy, chewy and rich. I agree that it is very difficult to spread into a pan. What I found to work best is to place the batter in the pan, and then spray your hands with cooking spray and use your hands to spread the dough in the pan. It will be very thin, but this seems to work the best!

These are really yummy, very chocolatey and I like the crunch and chew of the peppermint candies. However, as another review said, they are very, very hard to spread in the pan because the dough is so stiff. I'd be tempted to just make them as cookies next time.

These are really nice - especially since they are quick and easy - basically a brownie - I drizzled with more chocolate and sprinkled with crushed candy canes.

This is a very rich, very tasty cookie - almost like a candy bar in density and sweetness! I found the dough to be stiff and difficult to smooth into the pan, but my batch turned out wonderfully. I would recommend crushing the peppermint candies fairly well, to avoid having large lumps of hard candy in your cookie.

I prepared this recipe as written. The cookies came out a bit greasy and not terribly pretty. The flavor was great, however, and I plan to tweak it a bit and see what can be done.
