I didn't have pea tendrils so used only peas. Perhaps that was the problem, but I felt the lemon didn't bring out the peas very well - even with the sugar in the dressing.

Easy and simple, with delicious results. There were no pea shoots to be had at my market so I used fresh peas on their own. Would definitely make sgain.

I also made this without the tendrils and loved the flavour. Watch not to forget the salt and pepper at the end because it needs that balance.

Like the Madison chef, I received pea tendrils in my CSA share. Expecting fall veggies in New England (squash, onions, and potatoes), I was pleasantly surprised by these "spring greens". I chopped and used only the tender, small shoots and leaves of the pea tendrils. I boiled them in with fresh mushroom ravioli during its last 4 minutes of cooking. The pea stems were well cooked and leaves were very tasty. The sauce made a nice pasta topping as well. A little parmesan and black pepper made the combo really sing! Great work, Bon App and Epicurious.

I made this without using pea tendrils, and it was delicious -- the dressing is sweet and tangy (although I didn't go by the exact recipe amounts, since I had less then two cups of peas). The one suggestion is that you boil the peas longer than suggested, as they came out a little hard after four minutes.

We belong to a CSA and one week there were pea tendrils inside. Not sure what to do, I turned to epicurious.com to find a recipe. This was very good, but next time I'll take the leaves off of the stems before cooking. The pea tendril stems were too woody.

Pea tendrils sound like "pea shoots". If it's the same, I liken it to very young pea plants with a spinach/pea like taste. I usually find it packaged in plastic bags in large amounts at Asian grocery stores. It shrinks down to almost a third (or less) when sauteed/added to stir fry...like spinach! I was excited to see a recipe using fresh pea tendrils. Up till now, I've been following my Cantonese mother-in-law's instructions on how to use this. Can't wait to try this recipe out!

Dau Miu (Cantonese) for Pea Tendrils, the upper portion of the pea vine and leaves. See food dictionary on this site

I've had pea tendrils (though they were called "pea shoots" or "pea leaves") in some Chinatown restaurants in Manhattan -- my guess is to try getting them in a Chinese grocery or if you live near a city with a Chinatown area. They are actually quite good, and sort of similar (when prepared) to spinach -- very green and leafy, with a slight bitter taste.

I've been eating solid food for more years than I care to say and I have NEVER come across PEA TENDRILS in a recipe or gardening book! I love salmon and will try this recipe sans pea tendrils unless someone can tell me what they are and where to get them!
