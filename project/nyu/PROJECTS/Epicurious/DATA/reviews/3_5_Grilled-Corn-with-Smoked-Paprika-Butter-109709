This was truly amazing! Would use on meat, other veggies. Best way to cook corn on the grill: carefully strip back husk, leaving attached, tear off silk, rewrap husk, soak in water with pan on top to weight for 1/2 hr, tie with kitchen string, and grill 15 min, turning occasionally. Peel back husk and serve with this incredible butter.

I used Spanish paprika, and it totally overwhelmed the corn. My husband tried it on a small part of his corn, and, after one bite, did not eat that part.

Amazing! I cannot recommend this highly enough. The smoked paprika butter is so simple and so delicious. Mine has kept just fine in the refrigerator for 2 weeks. I think it would be great on corn, steak, fish and vegetables, too. The Smoked Paprika Butter is sure to please. Thank you, epicurious!

Scrumptious! I followed other reviews and used 2 canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and added a tablespoon of the sauce to the butter. An easier way to grill the corn is to first take all the outer husks off until you can just see the kernals through the last husk (leaving on the strings). Then soak for about an hour (I use a pitcher and weight it down with a mug). You get to skip the step of boiling the corn first!Grill for about 10 minutes. The husks easily pulls off andthe corn is quite moist. Just pass the butter mixture around! Everyone loved this dish!

I love chipotle too but I have to put in a good word for smoked paprika. I buy spanish brand and I LOVE this stuff and use it whenever I want to add a smoky flavor to marinades, beans, stews etc.. It is great for this recipe too.

Definitely use the chipotle chiles, not paprika. It is truly awesome! The left over chipotle butter can be used for so many different things -- vegetables, bagles, etc. It is so simple....
