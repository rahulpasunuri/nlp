Very good, exciting and unexpected flavor. Nicely complimented a chicken florentine burger with garden Havarti, avocado splashed with lime juice, Rose tomato, red onion, passion fruit wasabi mustard, and mayonnaise on a whole wheat bun. Though, I am considering adding a little more peel with some sliced green onions next time - just to see.

Have made this many times, and it's always a hit. Very quick and easy! We often sprinkle the corn with chili powder, as well.

Easy, delicious and a nice twist on grilled corn. This was a great addition to a summer menu. Wouldn't change a thing! We cut up the citrus after zesting and used it for sangria.

An exotic flavor to add to the grilled corn. I followed reviewer's suggestion below and cut off the kernels for more of a salad but didn't like it that way. It takes away from the multi-colored corn and is mushy. I'd recommend leaving it on the cob.

Loved this!!!! For the first time ever, I made entire Gourmet menu. The green beans were great, the salmon perfect and I even made the first course of angel hair w/ tomatoes. The only thing I couldn't find was wine that was suggested. Very unusal to be able to find all the ingredients needed in my small town in Tennessee. Now if we only had a fancy wine shop!

Excellent summer side dish. After grilling the corn, I cut the kernels from the cob and tossed them with the citrus butter. Very different, and very delicious!
