I thought this was very good. I live in the mountains now and lament my lack of access to fresh coastal fish. I managed to buy whole Tilapia at Safeway. Tilapia is a pretty blah fish in my opinion, but it came out very good in this recipe, plus the large bones made for very easy eating. I used roasted peanut oil to add a little more flavor, and steamed two tilapia, just over a pound each. My husband and I finished it all. Very easy and good. Can't wait to try with an even more flavorful fish, like bass.

This was amazing. I had trouble getting the fish to fit with the implements I had on hand for steaming. So I finally settled on rolling up a bunch of tin foil into coils to make a base. Put the coils in the wok and poured water over that. Made a tin foil boat that held the fish... and rested the fish boat on top of the foil coils. It worked. Yes, I was desperate because I had everything ready to go! It was fantastic. I will definitely do this again.
