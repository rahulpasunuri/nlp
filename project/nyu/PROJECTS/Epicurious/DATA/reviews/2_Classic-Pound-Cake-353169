the first time i made this cake it was a bit dry and dense but i beat the butter/sugar longer and the cake turned out moist and softer. adding lemon zest was a nice addition.

I thought the batter looked a bit dense; so, I added an additional egg. Baked the cake less than the required time and it is very dry. Great taste, but no moisture at all.

I couldn't even eat this cake it was so dry. It was like a hockey puck. I threw it out right away. Back to my search for the perfect cake...

I made a double batch of this over the weekend, and the result was two beautiful, classic pound cakes. My method was slightly different. I first separated the eggs & beat them (yolks until creamy, whites until stiff peaks form). Yolks were added to creamed butter & sugar, then folded in the whites. I used the highest quality ingredients I could find, with the exclusion of the flour. I didn't have any cake flour, so used regular all-purpose flour. I also threw in a pinch of salt. The cake was tender and flavorful, with crispy edges. At our house, we ate it with powdered sugar sprinkled over the top, and once with strawberries, which was fantastic. Our neighbors, who were the recipients of the second loaf, made grilled pound cake hot fudge sundaes & claimed they were the best they'd ever had (a local deli specializes in them, and our neighbors said the home version was far better). I love how easy it is, even with separating the eggs. Absolutely beautiful!

I agree with the reviewer who disliked this recipe, although I would not exclaim "dry, dry, dry" and throw it immediately into the trash. I gave a couple of people a chance to try it. It is dry, and unfortunately, flavorless. I only used the recipe with vanilla essence to test its basic properties, and what I tasted was flour. I am looking for a dense, moist, slightly sweet cake, and this isn't it.

JUST AN FYI: In the recipe it states to add one third of FOUR I think it should be FLOUR

This is the perfect, classic pound cake. I've made it as is, and I've made it with variations in the flavouring and it has been absolutely perfect each and every time. This recipe is a definite keeper and I would recommend it strongly to any real cook.

Dry, dry, dry. And I make pound cakes often. This one should have a baking time of about 50 minutes. I spat out the bite I took and will toss the rest of the entire cake into the trash. And my oven is correctly calibrated, and I followed the directions to a "T."

This cake was simple to make, moist, and easily modified. I mixed in some unsweetened cocoa to half of the prepared batter to make a marble pound cake.
