The recipe made so many cookies that I was able to freeze them and bake up a new batch for two more hostess gifts. Although no one confessed to liking fruit cake- everyone seemed to enjoy the festive look and sweetness of the green and red cherries.

These are pretty good - they look lovely on a cookie platter, but the flavor was not as "cherry" as I hoped for. Watch them carefully - the coconut burns quickly. I made them for a party and lots of people really liked them, but they didn't knock my socks off. I'd make them again because they are easy and indeed quite Christmasy.

Great old fashioned cookie- not too sweet, good with coffee. The candied cherries give a chewiness and they are perfectly suited to the cookie. If you don't have/want to use coconut there'd be no loss- much of the coconut baked off on mine anyway.

I was embarrassed to be seen buying neon green and red candied cherries, but was really delighted at how festive the cookies looked. Oddly, they tasted better the day after they were made than they did right out of the oven.

I really wanted to like these based on the ratings, but they are just okay. They are dry and a little biscuitish. The flavors are there, but a little too delicate. I will say that they are very easy to make and it's nice that they have the red and green flecks of cherries, but there isn't much more good you can say about them. I triple checked the recipe to make sure that I didn't miss anything.

These just might qualify as the perfect Christmas cookie. They are easy to make, especially since logs can be rolled up and stored in the fridge or freezer right until you need them, then just slice and bake. I guess I am an outlier, because I love fruitcake and never worried about the candied fruit, but it's true that everyone at the party I took them to loved these cookies, even if they might otherwise have avoided the candied cherries. Same goes for coconut-avoiders who thought these were delicious. Sorry to hear cook from Ashville had such a bad experience, but I have to wonder if the cookies were appropriately chilled. These ended up being some of the easier slice-and-bake cookies I've made, and I've made a lot in the past. I was worried it would be hard to slice them thinly with the fruit and nuts, but they were quite easy to slice and baked up delightfully crisp.

These were delicious and relatively easy, as written. Plus, they are very pretty and retained their shape well.

These are sweet, delicious, and a coconut lover's delight. They are also very colorful and festive for the holidays. I tried these for the first time. Next time, I would not grease the cookie sheets. I also would take the oven temperature down to 350 degrees since the coconut started to brown.

Great addition to my Xmas cookies file, I keep a log prepared and wrapped in the fridge ready to bake whenever more cookies are needed. A colorful addition to a gift plate. Very tasty, a "tea cookie" that's not too sweet, crisp, and colorful. No worries about the funky colored cherries (I'm not a fan in general), when they are all chopped up they look like pretty confetti and taste fine. Don't let them brown too much-- done when the bottom edges start to look brown.

the only reason i gave this recipe one fork is that though i',m a decent cook i suck as a baker. but these were awful. the dough was really dry and crumbly and the coookies tasted more like bisquits than cookies. i'm glad i didn't spend the 7 bucks on yucky candied cherries. i substituted dried cherries. but, that was not the issue with these things. now after time coomking an d cleaning up i'll have to bake other cookies after dinner to have them promised amount for the charity event. whew i'm pooped. don't even try these things. they are not worth the effort. i've never given a recipe a poor review on this site. i guess because i just love food

I have made these many times although not this recipe per se. I have used crushed potato chip crumbs instead of the coconut when I didn't have any. I have also subbed chopped bittersweet chocolate for the nuts as well as candied pineapple for the nuts. Everyone loves them in spite of the candied cherries, but if you buy them at wwwNuts.com you will be surprised at their prices as well as freshness and quality.

All the reviews are right - candied cherries - which normally sound like my nightmare - are awesome in this recipe. Crispy but chewy and easy to make. I had to bake them a shorter time in order for them not to be too brown, but after the first batch I got the hang of it. I have also frozen them and they are still excellent.

I made these last year. They came out really nicely.I also don't like those cherries but they went so well with the cookie. They are worth making. I am making them again this year.

I was encouraged by the other reviewers not to be put off by the candied cherries - they were right. These cookies are cute and delicious. I had to make 16 dozen for a party - they were a snap to make and were snapped up by Thanksgiving guests.

Yes the cherries my be a turn off but these cookies are amazing!!! I was looking for an old school recipe that was unique and this is it. The cookie is not too sweet it is soft but not chewy just perfect. ( I used unswwetened coconut) We all devoured them and I am making more tonight! Enjoy!

Don't pass this one up thinking you don't like those yucky candied cherries. In this recipe, they are delightful and colorful. Not yucky at all. The coconut is a great touch. I just love these.

I thought the recipe was easy to make. The cookies were good, though not outstanding. I used almonds instead of pecans. Not sure if that made any difference, but next time I will try pecans instead.

My mom used to make these and i have never been able to find a written recipe. Fantastic!

Really delicious...was out of pecans and used toasted almonds, which worked well. Will definitely make again.

I may be biased, but this is a very simple Christmas cookie recipe that tastes delicious. The dough can be refrigerated overnight, and if you can't find green cherries, you can use just red ones. Walnuts also work instead of pecans.
