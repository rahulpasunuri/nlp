I had high hopes for this, especially after it came out of the oven. It looked beautiful. But when we cut it, the filling had a sort of gelatinous texture to it. I was expecting more of a custard filling. I'll continue to look for another coconut tart recipe and won;t go with this one again.

I am new to all this cooking thing, and specially to baking. Made this for a girls night out potluck and everyone that knows me couldn't believe I made it. It was the hit of the night, and simple enough for me to make. Everyone wanted the recipe!

Where's the recipe for the incredible tart dough? I think you're just supposed to use store-bought, aren't you? (just repeated the stars that were already there...)

To janecooks. Try using unsweetened coconut milk instead of whole milk. It will make a big difference!

This was just ok. The pastry was great - incredibly flaky - but the filling was more about the eggs than the coconut. I didn't expect sweet and gooey, but I did expect more coconut flavor - not custard.

This is perfect as is. Don't change a thing when you make it, unless you are short on time and want to use a store-bought crust.

Really good!! THe first time I made it I tried to take shortcuts on the pastry (I am not much of a baker), which was a mistake. The second time I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out fit for company AND delicious. Will definitely make it again.

Turned out nicely, but I added a bit of coconut extract, as it tasted a little bland before. I used rainbow sweetened coconut since the store was out of plain sweetened coconut.
