For a simple cheesecake, this is great recipe that is pretty much foolproof! I have made it a few times and admittedly skipped a step or two by mistake and it still turns out great!

I have made this cake hundreds of times, each time it was a hit. I use an electric hand mixer and it turns out fine, and is faster. I have also used graham crackers as the crust without a problem. I rarely take the extra step of reserving some of the crust mixture for a topping--it is just one more thing to do. I usually serve some pureed and strained raspberries (with a hint of sugar) on the side as a 'topping'.

i've made this dozens of times, even my husband(who claims he never liked cheesecake}loves this dessert. I once tried to double it,didn't work.

Great basic cheesecake recipe. Very amenable to flavour variations. And the way the crust and the edge of the cake turn out, it's a great cheesecake to 'hold' a runny topping.

This is my favorite cheesecake recipe. I chose not to beat everything by hand and it was still incredible. The zwieback crust is the best I have tasted!

I have been making this cheesecake for every special occasion our family has has since it appeared in 1999. The recipe doubles well, as one is never enough. The zwiebeck toast is a must. My father said he was suprised he liked the crust, as he dont care for graham cracker crust. This recipe has become a family tradition!!

This is a wonderful recipe for cheesecake. I made it at home and my sister, mom and I were addicted to it immediately. I made a little modification, instead of using 2 8oz packs of chess, I made it 3 and leaved the rest of the ingredients as written here. It gave the cake a cheesier and smoother flavor and texture.

I love this receipe! I made it twice so far. It is sweetm very creamy and fluffy. I changed the crust, I bought a cheap box of cinnamon grahmcrackers- I put two of the packs (about 18 whole crackers)with 1 and a half sticks of soft butter in the food processor. I set aside about 1/4 cup of this mixture for the topping. Perfect! My friends who tried it said it was the best cheesecake they had ever had. This is now my "keeper" cheesecake receipe.

this was fun to make and turned out beautifully. it also was a favorite with the kids because it was pretty sweet. i missed the rich cheesey flavors that is in so many other recipes i have made. the cinnomon in the crust is a must.. we loved that!! in our quest to find the best.. this one didnt make the top 5.

I used grounded graham crackers, sugar and butter for the crust. The filling I followed to a T. Didn't use any special techniques for baking it other than followed the directions. The consistency was smooth, flavor as a good cheesecake should be. Most of my guest prefered the cheesecake as prepared. Other's dropped a couple of tablespoons of cherry pie filling on the top. Either way, it was a success.

This recipe turned out beautifully - a perfect presentation! I baked it in a water bath; after an hour, turned the oven off, opened the oven door and let it cool down for an hour before wrapping and chilling in the refrigerator. Not a single crack, and the filling is so creamy - rich in taste with a light consistency. Slightly modified the crust, though: used two cups of crushed graham crackers, 1/2 cup toasted, sweetened shredded coconut, one stick of unsalted butter (melted) and just about 1/3 cup light brown sugar. The two cups of graham crackers ensured a substantial bottom crust.

My sister-in-law gave me a recipe that is almost identical to this one. It calls for the identical crust, but you use 1.5 lbs cream cheese, 1 pint of sour cream (in stead of heavy cream), 1 Tbsp corn starch, and 5 eggs separated (rather than 4). Lastly, after baking for 1 hour you keep the oven door closed(still turn off) for 2 hours before removing the cake.

To the cook below: zwieback is a very hard German cookie (not sweet though). It resembles a little piece of toast bread and has the consistency of being very toasted (almost no moisture). They are wonderful for crumb based recipes. Since they are widely used as teething biscuits for children you may find them with the baby food items, otherwise if you have a Cost Plus, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Bristol Farms or a well stocked general grocery, you will be able to find them. They really are superior to graham crackers. Good luck!

Love this cheesecake-light yet flavorfull. Have made it twice in the last month. I admit I use a mixer for all steps! Easy to make, next time I am going to try one less egg yolk.

This was one of the best cheesecakes I have ever had. The egg yolks give a nice fluffy consistancy, not so rich like others. I substituted 8oz of crushed hazelnuts to crust instead of the toasts and more cinnamon, also used lowfat cream cheese and sugar subst. to make it healthier. DELICIOUS!

this is a wonderful cheesecake recipe. the texture was light but the tase was full of flavor/ i added oreo chunks and brought it at a party. everyong was raving about it. the only problem i had was after baking it for 1 hour, the middle was still shaky, so i baked it another 10 minutes and i guiess it set as it cooled. very good!!

It reminds me a japanese cheesecake that is light and delicate. I left out cinnamon. Insted, I added brandy to filling. It's gonna be my favorit cheesecake recipe !

This is a delicious cheesecake. It is both light and rich at the same time. The beating of the egg whites achieves this. I added a touch more cinnamon to the crust the second time I made this and it helped to spice it up as another reviewer suggested. However, I'd leave out the old bay seasoning.

A fair cheesecake but very bland. Try spicing it up. aybe a little Old Bay Seasoning.
