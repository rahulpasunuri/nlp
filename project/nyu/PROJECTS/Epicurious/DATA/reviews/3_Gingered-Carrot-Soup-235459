Unexpected & Excellent. I needed a quick healthy fix for a gloomy Sunday afternoon and this recipe was just gorgeous. Didn't know what to expect, but so glad I tried it. The sweet taste and creamyness was a nice contrast to the slight curry lime flavoring. TIP: the secret is in fresh carrot juice. I juiced my carrots and then added the juice to the mixture.

One of the best chilled soups I have ever made. That said, I was still not compelled to finish my small serving. I used organic carrot juice, and it seemed to work well and was very convenient. The soup had impressive depth. But it still sat in my glass. Quite a confusing situation, really.

Overall, it was a decent soup and easy to make, although the combination of avocado and carrot is a bit odd. My guests all loved the soup, but I was disappointed. I think having really excellent carrot juice is important. I got mine fresh from the local juice store, but it had some of that dirty carrot skin flavor.

I made this soup last night just for myself. It is super tasty and has a shot of zing in each bite. Either the lime or curry really adds. I would equally serve this for guests. The avocado thickens the carrot juice nicely and all the tastes are quite incredible together.

This was a perfect quick summer soup as it was refreshing and took only minutes to make. The avocado lent an incredibly silky texture and I loved the lime juice coming through(as I added a bit more). But my husband found it a little boring and claims he used to make similar smoothies in his bachelor days with carrot juice.
