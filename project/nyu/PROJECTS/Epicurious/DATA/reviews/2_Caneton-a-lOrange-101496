To the previous poster: Note the date of the recipe: 1959. James Beard no doubt altered the recipe for American home cooks of the time.

This is not the authentic french recipe, which calls for a much more complicated set of steps of prepairing the orange sauce, using rick duck stock instead of consomme, boiling zested orange peel etc.. My boyfriend tried to make it for me once using this recipe and it came nowhere near close the complexity of a haute french dish of this nature. And for gosh sakes use Grand Marnier and not the sugary crud.
