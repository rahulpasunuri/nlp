I made it with halibut but the fish never "cooked" in the lime juice. So I threw the fish in a skillet and actually cooked it for a minute. I made the verde salsa as written and mixed it with the fish. It was delicious!! I would make this recipe again.

This is a fantastic ceviche. I had my reservations about the addition of the green olives, but as many others have said - they almost make the dish! I made this with bay scallops and enjoyed it very much. Would definitely make again!

Don't leave out the olives! They really made this dish and I don't even like olives much. I couldn't get tomatillos so used regular tomatoes which kinda ruins the green thing but still tasted amazing.

Where I live (Ottawa, Canada) it is almost impossible to get tomatillos, or at least I've never seen them.I substituted a couple of firm kiwi's and that worked well - tangy and green. I also cut the fish pieces smaller, for serving as a party appetizer with tortilla chips. It was a hit.

I wouldn`t make this again. I think there are much better ceviche recipes readily available.

Very good recipe! Followed ingredients/recipe (including using olives and used 1/2 jalapeno) except used chopped cooked shrimp instead of fish. Tasted great! Great appetizer with chips. Will definitely make again. It is also very easy/quick to make.

Delicious! We used fresh cod and haddock.

This made an excellent end-of-summer lunch. I served it in individual wide-mouthed jars with chips on the side and a glass of white wine: delicious!

As a first time making ceviche maker, I chose this easy recipe, & I was amazed at how good it turned out. Followed the directions as listed, except I forgot the olive oil at the end. Didn't miss it, as I perhaps had some large avocados and was not lacking for that fat component. Anyway, the flavors came together so nicely! My fish was a beautiful whole 3-lb Porgy purchased at our Saturday by-catch market. What didn't go in ceviche went on grill.

This was a super easy and VERY tasty recipe! I agree that you should not leave out the olives. I added a few more peppers to spice it up a bit more to my liking, but overall I stuck to the recipe and it did not let me down at all.

This is by far, one of the best ceviche recipes I've had! The ones I've tried in the past have been tomato based, and while that's not bad, this one is a real winner, full of fresh, vibrant flavors! Don't skip the olives, as some of the others have. The olives are one of the major flavor components that makes this ceviche a cut above the others! We made our own tostada chips from fresh corn tortillas, just cut in quarters, brushed w/evoo, sprinkled w/salt and baked a 425 for about 10 min. Store bought chips are not up to the task for this ceviche! Making again next week! If you like ceviche, you'll love this!

This is so simple to prepare and delicious. We ate the leftovers the next day for lunch and the texture and taste was still excellent. Wouldn't alter this recipe at all.

This was great and a quick weeknight dinner. Used a combination of Mahi Mahi and small scallops, added a bit more lime juice but left out the olives. Otherwise made it as written. Really good!

I made this the other night during record breaking heat. I used red snapper & left out the olives because I thought I had pitted ones but I didn't-- & as I tasted along the way, I thought the olives were unnecessary. Husband & daughter were skeptical but ended up enjoying it.
