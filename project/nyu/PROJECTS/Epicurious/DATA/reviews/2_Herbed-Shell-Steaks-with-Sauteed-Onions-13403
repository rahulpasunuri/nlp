This was a quick and easy recipe, and it TASTE GREAT!! (copy rights reserved to Tony the Tiger). Total cook / eat time was less than 30 minutes (includes sides). Although I only used one onion when the recipe called for two onions. I love onions but you gotta know when to pull back on them. Enjoy the steaks ;)

how can there ever be too many onions??? I have never made the recipe, but I think that you can tell that the recipe will have an aroma of onion when you see that there are 2 whole onions in it!

I didn't care for this dish- tho my boyfriend really liked it (men!). I think it made too many onions, overwhelming the taste of the meat, plus the end step of adding water was not only unnecessary, I think it took away from taste and texture of the dish.
