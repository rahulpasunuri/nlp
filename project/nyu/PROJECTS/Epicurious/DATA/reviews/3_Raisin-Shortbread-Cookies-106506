A very easy receipe, although I think you could use a little less flour, maybe 2 cups instead of 2.5, to make it easier to get the dough to stick together. Also, I used chopped dried apricots on one half of the cookies, and raisins on the other, and I have to say I liked the apricots better. Baking time is about 30 minutes, certainly nowhere near 40.

A delicate, sophisticated cookie -- not too sweet but very flavorful. I left off the egg wash and took them out after 25 minutes; still, the edges were overdone. They aren't too pretty, but are great with a cup of tea.
