Really good. Thank you to all who suggested adding vanilla, cinnamon, orange zest and juice, and brown sugar. Taste was heavenly. Buttering both sides of bread and baking dish, gave browned crispy toast and no sticking to pan problems. Melted butter, added maple syrup and heated till warm. You can add sliced bananas to the melted butter and sauté briefly then add syrup until heated and pass separately. Will definitely make again.

This is my favorite breakfast/brunch recipe to feed a crowd. I love that I can put it together the day before, and then put it in the oven and serve it piping hot in the morning. My family loves it.

LOVE this recipe. This is now our traditional Christmas breakfast.So easy to assemble the night before. Perfect for any morning you want to serve something special, but don't want a labor-intensive morning in the kitchen. Everyone absoluetly loved it. It really does feed about six, that's about all the bread you can squish into the pan. For a bigger crowd make more. Also, I goofed and added the sugar to the milk and eggs mixture, so I just poured it over the bread anyway,& next morning used 2 TB brown sugar to dust over mixture before baking: not too sweet, perfect! Also, buttered both sides of the bread as per review. Lightly crispy top, deliciously eggy and soft inside, perfect balance of buttery sweet!

This is a keeper, much easier than frying and uses less oil too. It puffed up beautifully. Added taste enhancements as suggested...cinnamon, vanilla, orange zest and orange juice to custard; and, cinnamon to turbinado sugar topping. I buttered both sides of bread, pressed sliced almonds onto tops, and oiled the pan. Used whole grain french bread and six slices was more than enough for three. Used 3 eggs and 2 cups 1% milk...spooned off excess custard the next morning before baking.

the recipe as written makes a really good, but very plain french toast (not soggy at all), but it definitely needs more flavor. the reviewers are right, add some vanilla, orange zest, whatever makes you happy.

I made this recipe last year for Easter brunch and everyone was floored! It came out perfectly and the taste was awesome. I followed some previous reviewers advice and added the orange zest to the custard. It made a world of difference. This year it was the first thing I was requested to bring at Easter brunch again!

Read the reviews before deciding exactly how to prepare this recipe. I used 3 eggs instead of two, added a tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon to the custard mixture and right before popping in the oven, sprinkled with brown sugar instead of white granular. The brown sugar gave it a little crunch. I didn't have any problem with sogginess, but I think the key is to let the bread soak overnight. When I pulled it out of the refrigerator, there was no liquid in the dish. This was the best French toast I've ever had; very guest-worthy!

I was quite nervous after all the soggy reviews, so I made a test batch before serving it at a holiday brunch. It was delicious! I added some extra spices to the mix, but otherwise cooked as suggested. The tops were crispy, the inside was soft and delicious. Everyone loved it, I should have made more!

Tried this and the 3 c. milk version of baked french toast, and this one wins! Nice and golden crisp on top, not soggy or bread-pudding like. A little bit time consuming having to butter each piece, but worth it. Definitely added a dash of vanilla and a couple shakes of cinnamon

This is one of those simplistic, wonderfull dishes that is so delicios and right on, you want to make it every Sunday. Not all soggy, it has great vanilla flavor. I'd also try serving it with an apple or cherry compote. Love the way it bakes in just enough custard. Fantastic!!

This was one of the best french toast recipes I've ever tried--and so easy. I added a teaspoon each of vanilla and cinnamon to the custard sauce, and another teaspoon of cinnamon to the sugar. I soaked the bread for about two hours. It was perfect. I'll never stand at the stove making french toast piece by piece again!

Rating: 3
A very nice recipe, but I wouldn't make it as-is; the additional ingredients from the other reviewers made this a great dish. Specifically, add cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, and the juice & zest of one orange to the custard (eyeball it) and add brown sugar and chopped pecans to the white sugar sprinkle. I was only able to fit 10 slices of an Italian bread baguette in our 9x13 baking dish, but the amount of custard was perfect for that amount.

I thought it was just ok. The italian bread was really boring...it just tasted (literally) all around bad for you white bread, sugar, butter -- I think a more flavorful bread --egg or wheat would help. Also I think you could greatly cut back on the butter.

WOW! I was looking for a recipe that could salvage our day old french bread loaves that we serve in our restaurant and went with my version of this recipe. We serve a brunch menu all day from 11 to 8pm and I served this for dinner to a lot of customers who were enraptured by the smell of the baking custard. One customer told me it was the best french toast she had ever had. I added orange juice, orange zest, vanilla and cinnamon to the custard and then served the french toast drizzled in maple syrup with fresh raspberries and a sprinkling of confectioners sugar.

I took many of the suggestions of other cooks and both my husband and I found these delicious. The toast puffs up so nicely. These tasted better than the best warm cinnamon muffins. Bravo!

What a breeze to make the night before, I just popped it into the oven and my family enjoyed this custard-like French toast. The only problem is that it stuck to the pan. I probably would use Pam or grease with butter generously before adding the ingredients to the pan. Great way to use up the leftover French bread.

Mmmmmmmmm. Best baked french toast recipe I've found. Great for brunch entertaining. Easy and delicious! I serve with fresh berries and a sprinkling of powdered sugar.

I added raisins (keep them covered by bread or custard) and vanilla for flavoring, also used cinnamon sugar to sprinkle on top before baking. Works well with french bread and challah also. My grandchildren loved it!

Rating: 1
this version of the recipe really sucked.after letting the custard absorb into the bread overnite,it was soggy,and then trying to bake it,the crusts of the bread got toasted and hard,while the rest of the pieces of bread remained soggy and the egg didnt really cook very well.and when it finally stayed in the oven for a while, it was like eating dry toast.no flavor. i will do my own version next time, i will fry it like normal first,then bake it.i've had it before like that and it was excellent. but not this recipe!

Made this out of left over raisin bread that was made from the bread machine. Husband liked it. No complaints from the six yr old. Needs a little extra flavoring.

I love this recipe, I've made it about a dozen times and am always asked for the recipe. First comment - this doesn't feed 6, I increase the recipe by 50% for 6 people and even double it if I have a few big eaters coming (I usually serve it with bacon and fresh fruit salad). I have always prepared the dish the night before (no last minute mess in the kitchen) and don't bother checking to see how much custard has been absorbed. It has never failed. Adding vanilla to the egg/milk mixture and cinnamon to the sprinkled sugar gives it a nice homey flavour. Try buttering both sides of the bread and don't grease the pan - it gives a nice crunch and easy clean-up.

Rating: 3
The french toast was great. We accelerated the recipe by: 1) heating the milk before mixing the eggs, allowing the bread to completely soak up the custard in 10 or so min, and 2) preheating a cast-iron skillet in the oven at 425 and baking the toast in there

I made this for a brunch and everyone liked it. It was very easy to prepare in advance, and I had no problems with sogginess. I let it sit overnight and found that it was somewhat dry in the morning as it had absorbed all of the egg mixture, so I flipped all of the pieces of bread and added more egg mixture to pour over the top and let it sit for another few hours. I also sprinkled a brown sugar/pecan/cinnamon & nutmeg mixture over the top before baking.

Even though I didn't read the recipe thoroughly, and added the sugar with the eggs and milk, this recipe was really a hit. I used a very airy French bread, so I withheld some of he liquid. I also added a little vanilla and cinnamon. Looking forward to an excuse to try it again!

This recipe is wonderful. Such an easy way to make french toast! Definitely a keeper. I didn't find the bottom to be too soggy. It wasn't exactly crisp either, but I'm not looking for that in french toast. I let it sit overnight, and turned the bread first thing in the am to make sure the custard got all the way through.

I loved this receipe!! I made this for my teenaged daughter's slumber party. All of them raved about it. I thought that this receipe was easy to prepare. I did however used cream (I know, extra fat, but...I ran out of milk when I was in the middle of preparing it)instead of milk which gave it a really nice texture and flavor. This receipe is a keeper.

I made this recipe for brunch and everyone really liked it. I added a mixture of 1/8 cup brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon and a few pecans which I sprinkled over the top just before baking.YUM!!I also made a hot syrup with cinnamon and brown sugar which really complimented the dish. The only disappointment was that the toast stuck slightly, so next time I will more generously grease the glass dish.

This was easy and delicious and a great way to use up the rest of our Semolina Italian bread from last night. I made it last night and let it sit covered in the fridge overnight. Kids loved it too! I didnt' bother with the butter, since there was already butter on the bread. I added some cinnamon to the sugar as well.

This was a delicious and easy addition to Sunday brunch. My guests went back for more until there were no traces left. I should have tripled the recipe. I served it with a homemade blueberry sauce that was made from fresh bluberries and maple syrup cooked together with a squirt of lemon. Yummy!

Delicious and very easy! I make it often when we have weekend guests and it is always well received! I make it more of a "cinnamon toast" french bread by sprinkling a cinnamon/sugar mixture on top of the bread before baking.

Good stuff! Here's a suggestion that my family has done for years, rather than milk, use the same quantity of melted vanilla icecream (or whatever flavor suits you)! You'll make this an "ohmagawd" recipe! Also, I like to brown my slices in a saute pan and then I finish them up in the oven for the puffiness effect. This way they are crisp on the outside and soft and lovely on the inside... yum.

Ever so easy, ever so good. Even a novice chef/cook would be delighted to serve this to his/her inlaws! We thought it was FINE. P.S. I used plain old supermarket Italian bread as specified in the recipe, and it was lovely.

Made this for an Easter Brunch, and it was a big hit. I used cinnamon-raisin bread and added some nutmeg and cinnamon to the egg mixture. Tastes similar to bread pudding. Very yummy.

Rating: 3
Super easy and tasty. I used a rosemary raisin bread from a local restaurant. I think a special bread (cinnamon/raisin or herb) is necessary to make this recipe special enough to serve to guests. (Also I like a more bread pudding taste so I increased the custard "batter" by 50%). For a variation I substituted grated cheese for sugar (last 5 min of baking) and it changed the whole tenor of the dish--more like a savory, lunch dish.
