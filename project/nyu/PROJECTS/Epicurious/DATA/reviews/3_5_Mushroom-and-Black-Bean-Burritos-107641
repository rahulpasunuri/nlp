This is an easy recipe to tweak. Tonight I used corn tortillas that I toasted until crisp in the oven (with a light brushing of oil on one side), and then made them as one would with a tostada, i.e.put everything on top. And, since the only goat cheese I had was a goat gouda, I used that. These were really yummy.

Excellent! The goat cheese added a really great flavor. I was pleasantly surprised. I just wished I had bought more! I didn't have any of the listed mushrooms, and used white mushrooms instead (the typical ones you find at the grociers). They worked out great. I added red wine for a little punch. I look forward to making this one again.

An all-time favorite of mine. So healthful and always delicious, and well-loved by my friends. I typically use half the onion.

these burritos were sooo good! i used baby spinach instead of red pepper and it worked out great. i was surprised that the goat cheese would go so well with mexican food but it definitely did. a super easy, super delicious meal that i can't recommend enough!

I am a serious meat eater and this was still a DELICIOUS recipe for burritos. Next time I make it I may brown some beef in the pan with the filling, just for a little something extra but this is perfect as is! A+! Also the goat cheese is spectacular, buy good quality, and don't leave it out or substitute for mexican cheese, the flavor is incredible and unexpected

Still an all-time favorite of mine, these are healthful, easy, and delicious. Made them last night for my church group (along with charred tomatillo guacamole, chipotle salsa, and serrano ham and poblano corn pudding. All went over well.

I added a little corn and chopped up swiss chard. Thought these were really good, and my kids did, too. I topped with salsa, too and baked covered for about 20 minutes.

This was really, really good. I too used portabella mushrooms and a "gourmet mix" available my my grocer, they were fine. The goat cheese MADE this exceptional - I wouldn't make it without it!

this was a great and easy to make. i follwed the recipe exactly and it got great reviews from my family.

I loved this - it came together quickly and tasted great. I'd make this for guests any time. I used portabella and button mushrooms because my grocery store didn't have any cremini. With Penzey's medium hot chili powder, it came out a little hotter than I like, so I might use a more mild chili powder in the future.

This is a solid recipe - for those who found too much filling - you're probably using tortillas that are too small. The recipe calls for six 9-10" tortillas, and if you substitute with corn tortillas, they are usually no more than 7-8", which will make a big difference. Also, for those who thought 1tbsp of chili powder was too hot, I believe you were using cayenne or hot chili powder, not "chili powder" as in the premix seasoning for chili and southwest cooking. That chili powder is usually quite mild for general cooking. All in all, a good recipe that is easy to tweak to personal preferences.

A tablespoon of chili powder is way too much! Yikes. This recipe was outrageously hot, and my husband and I even like hot and can handle quite a bit. I would say a teaspoon is the most you should use, or at least add it slowly and taste it as you go. Also, I agree with others - this is way too much filling for the reported number of servings, especially if you substitute corn tortillas.

I make this dish a lot. I've found chipotle chili powder gives it more flavor than regular chili powder and I usually use a bit more than called for. Also, I use a mix of wild mushrooms, not just the ones indicated in the recipe. Finally, I'm a firm believer in using only corn tortillas.

These are very tasty. Although meatless, they are quite hearty.

I had problems with this recipe. The overall flavor was good, but it became really watery with the addition of the tomatillo salsa. When I cooked off the salsa liquid the flavor seemed to go with it. Oh well.

This dish was amazing - such a wonderful combination of flavors. Don't change a thing! It was a big hit.

Great combination of flavors. Delicious as is.

This was very easy to make, but the flavor was not the absolute greatest. The only variation to the recipe I did, was use homemade pico-style salsa (which I have been making for years and is wonderful) instead of the purchased salsa. Maybe this is what made the difference?

ABsolutely delish! Made for a quick Sunday night dinner -- so quick and easy. It was just 2 of us, so had leftovers for 2 lunches. Instead of crimini mushrooms, I used portabellas cut into a large dice, and cut down on the tomatillo salsa, as I didn't feel that it needed as much as the recipe called for. Trader Joe's sells a nice chili powder with a hint of cinnamon in the mix, which gives it a more complex flavor.

I made this for a reunion of my college friends and they all wanted the recipe. They loved that the ingredients are all cooked together in one pan--much easier than dealing with other burrito recipes.

This was truly amazing and that's coming from someone who loves meat in her burritos. My grocery store did not have just crimini mushrooms but did sell a mixture of crimini, shittake and oyster mushrooms. They were great. Everything else I did as directed. Any culinarily challenged person could make this simple dish delicious.

Delicious and fast!

This rocks! It was so easy and so good, I'll definitely make it again. It makes more than 6 burritos-worth. I was hesitant about the goat cheese, but it's really good! It adds an unexpected flavor than the typical shredded cheddar or Mexican cheese.

These burritos are great! I chopped one of the onions and added it to the mix near the end of cooking to add crunch. I also added some cayenne pepper and used low-fat Mexican cheese instead of goat cheese.

I made this dish for the first time tonight, and it was deeeelish. Often, I make recipes and am more critical than my husband with respect to how they turn out. This time, both of us were in agreement: this rocks. The goat cheese adds a truly wonderful flavor to an already delightful dish.

Very tasty and easy to make. I used Mexican cheese too (not a fan of goat cheese). My 14-month old daughter even ate some. Might try adding chicken or shredded lettuce with it in the future.

Awesome! Best burritos I've had in awhile. The recipe makes a lot more than six servings. Also, for those baby-mouths out there, it's pretty spicy! The goat-cheese is the best part, don't leave it out!

We enjoyed this dish a lot. I left out the cheese but added romaine lettuce and seeded cucumbers for crunch before wrapping.

Easy and healthy! I could find crimini mushrooms so I ended up using shitake. Also, instead of goat cheese I used low fat shredded Mexican cheese-rolled them up like a burrito and stuck them in the oven for a few minutes. I'll definitely do these again!

This was great!! THis will be a regular on my family's menu. Howver, I did not add the goat cheese and also added Mexican cheese instead. With the leftovers,I filled, wrapped and then baked the burritos..we like it even better.

This was delicious. Half of the recipe was enough to fill four tortillas. We'll be having this again regularly.

I really enjoyed this. I even made it with out salsa with a chopped tomatoes, hot peppers, garlic and chili powder mixture. Not that far off from a salsa taste and it was still delish! With added cheese and imagination it is really a new twists to burritos.

My husband and I both thought this was delicious. It was very easy to make. We used mango peach salsa. Instead of goat cheese we used shredded mexican cheese and also sour cream. Next time we might add some chicken or ground beef.

These were delicious! Even my picky meat-eater of a husband liked them.
