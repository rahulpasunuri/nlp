Would have only given it 2 forks except I added 2 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp Worcestershire, cayenne, 1 can of whole baby clams and the bunch of scallions. Very tasty.

I have made this many times and now my friends request it for every holiday party. I find that a dark pumpernickel round bread brings great flavor to the dip. I also add 1 teaspoon of worchestershire sauce, 1/2 shredded cheddar and a few dashes of tobasco. Delicious.

Easy and delicious. Would certainly make again, although I do agree that it needs a bit of spiciness. I suggest adding a teaspoon or two of cayenne pepper.

I should've read the reviews before I made it. Definitely needs some hot sauce to spice it up. I would add some chopped water chestnuts to give it some extra texture the next time. That being said, I will make it again.

This one is very popular at family gatherings. I use a sourdough round and the internal bread for dipping. A couple of shakes of tabasco helps to perk it up!

This was okay, but we've had hot clam dips that we like better.

This is a very addictive dip. I made it using one block of Fat free cream cheese and one block of 1/3 less fat cream cheese. It was very tasty and I certainly did not miss the extra fat calories!!!

I've made this recipe several times and guests always enjoy it. Use the extra bread for dipping.
