great recipe, made once as a tart and once as a pie. the pecan brittle makes a nice crunchy contrast to the smooth filling. I used fresh pumpkin puree; awesome.

The pie itself is fine - nothing special but good - and probably deserves 2 forks, but I had to take a fork off for the nuts and whipped cream. The nuts (basically pecan brittle) are a jarring contrast to the creamy pie and stuck to my son's braces. As for the whipped cream, it is better with sugar than honey.

An absolutely spectacular pumpkin pie. Pumpkin pie is generally just a "thing you do" for the holidays, and I've found that if you have other desserts oftentimes people skip it. Maybe that's because there are so many low quality $3 supermarket pies out there? This is a pie that will not be skipped! It is so delicate and elegant, and although it is amazing on its own, the honeyed pecans absolutely put it over the top. Just received another request for the recipe this year. I have been making this pie for years now, exactly as the recipe is written.

this is my favorite pumpkin pie recipe. I must confess that I omit the pecans and whipping cream and enjoy the rich taste of the pumpkin pie filling. I've been making this pie recipe since it first appeared in the BA magazine in 1997.

This was awesome and super-simple. Didn't need 1/2 the pecans and I spread the whipped topping on-top of the pie. Make the whipped cream - it's totally worth it.

Also a new traditoin for our Thanksgining dinner. Last year I made this recipoe as well as the Bourbon Pumkin Pie and asked the geusts to rate them. While both were very good, this one was the winner - being lighter, creamier and ovreall better-tasting.

I love honey, I love pumpkin and I had high hopes for this pie. It was bland and had none of the rich honey flavor I was looking for. My guests ate it, but no one raved and there were plenty of leftovers.

This recipe gets fairly foolproof and makes a good pie (even though I don't care for pumpkin pie in general, everyone who does loved it) once you've made it and know how your oven behaves with the filling-I had to cover the crust to keep it from burning (it didn't burn since I was being very precautious). I increased the spices by at least two times, which I think is essential, and I had to, after letting it cool, cook it again for another 15 minutes on a bit higher temperature-I was using someone else's oven so it was probably not hot enough-with foil around the edges (the crust, which was easy and consistent, was done before the pie) because the filling hadn't set entirely (eggs not cooking thoroughly enough is the culprit for this issue) despite cooking well over the recommended time. Since I had to transport it to a Christmas dinner much later, I had to skip the whipped cream and topped one pie with the pecans. As for the pecans, they were simple enough, but I don't know if they were worth the work unless you want insurance in case your pie is unattractive (great for that purpose!). I made one pie with them and one without, and they are very pretty and taste good if you add spices like cloves to the honey mix, but they take away from the smoothness of the pie, which made some people stray from it. I'll make it again if pumpkin pie is requested of me (I usually don't bother with it), but it takes a lot of attention.

I cut the amount of sugar down, but still thought this pie was too sweet. Loved the pecans however, and will try to adapt that to a different recipe.

I've made this recipe twice this fall, with fabulous success. For some reason, I never fell in love with pumpkin pie, but I think now it's because I'd never had this recipe before. Both times I took the excellent advice of previous reviewers, doubling the spices and adding about 7 oz. of extra pure pumpkin. The first time I skipped the honeyed pecans, but I will never do that again: chopped coursely and scattered on top of the pie they are the perfect accent to this rustic beauty.

This is our new pumpkin pie recipe. It has the classic taste, but a lighter texture and a neat twist with the pecans. Although pumpkin pie is de rigueur on Thanksgiving, this year people actually ate and enjoyed it. I'll make it again, even when I don't have to.

This was a very good pumpkin pie. I made the recipe exactly as is but next time I would decrease the granulated sugar to just 1/3 cup.

Tried four different recipes this year for fun, and this is still my favorite. Spices are nice and strong without completely overpowering the pumpkin. Also good combined with gingersnap-pecan crust from the pumpkin chiffon pie recipe on this site. Others I made were the Ultimate Pumpkin Pie-- good, very pumpkin and orange, but low on spice for me, the Spiced Pumpkin Pie, which some others liked best but I felt the molasses overpowered the pumpkin a little. Also tried Cook's Illustrated Best Pumpkin Pie-- nice flavor and very spicy, required cooking on stove before filling crust-- will also try that one again-- husband thought it was a little too spicy.

A quick note - using a silpat for the nuts makes cleaning up a breeze.

I loved the intense flavour of the pie filling. I found adding one whole egg just to brush some on the crust to be wasteful. So I just dipped my brush into the three eggs whipped up for the main filling. It took me about 65 minutes to get the filling to set..also my crust did burn quite a bit. Next time I will cover the crust for the first 40 minutes or so and then take the foil off for the last 20 minutes or so. Overall delicious. and the nuts are amazing. I would add maybe another 1/4 cup to soak up all the caramel.

I am eager to try this recipe after all the rave reviews, but was wondering if, with 1/2 c sugar plus the honey, anyone thought it was too sweet? I like pecan pie, but not when it turns out sickly sweet.

Yum. I could have easily eaten the whole pie without sharing; it's that good.

Loved the spices in this pie, was worried it would be bland for some reason but was really great. used store crust, no big deal. next time i'll pair this recipe with the gingersnap crust in another pumpkin pie recipe on this site...

Okay, let me first say that I had to make the candied pecans three times, because my husband couldn't keep his hands off of them. (Great sprinkled on ice cream, by the way!) The pecans alone get four stars from all who tried them. As for the pie, it was absolutely delicious. I prepared it exactly as written (with the exception of the whipped cream rosettes-- I just carefully spread the cream on top, and it looked great.) Everyone raved and groaned over this fantastic pie. The honey really makes this dish stand head and shoulders over traditional pumpkin pie. This will become a certain addition to my book of winners.

This is by far the best pumpkin pie recipe my family has ever made. The honey-whipped cream and honey-pecans really complement the pumpkin filling. My sister (whose favorite holiday dish is pumpkin pie) was very reluctant to let us change from our traditional recipe, but was completely won over this year when we served her this at Thanksgiving.

Absolutely fabulous! It's the best pumpkin pie I've ever eaten (and my dinner guests rave about it)! Extremely easy to make.

This was the best pumpkin pie I have ever had. I made it for Thanksgiving and am recieving requests to have it again at Christmas. This time, however, I will skip the pecans. They didn't turn out how I had expected, and the pie certainly didn't need anything besides some fresh whipped cream. Heavenly!

Please make this pie! The filling recipe is perfect. Will never use any other recipe again. Carved a fresh pumpkin & steamed it -was well worth the hassle-and the fresh puree translated perfectly with the proportions called for. Honeyed pecans (clove & orange honey mix) will be a staple of mine, thanks to this recipe.

I made this pie last year for thanksgiving dinner and I've been thinking about it all year! It is, without doubt the VERY VERY best pumpkin pie I've ever tasted.

I made this for a dinner party and it was the first dessert finished. One child said it was better than his mom's famous pumpkin pie! I doubled the recipe for the pecans to have extra around but would put alot more pecans in the syrup next time. I used a 10 oz bag but could have used at least another cup of pecans. I don't do pie crusts either, so used a bought one and it was just fine.

Absolutely delicious. I have eaten traditional pumpkin pie all of my life, but have never eaten pumpkin pie as good as this. (Of course I haven't tried any of the other great-looking epicurious pumpkin recipies). Highly recommend; your guests will be so impressed!

Rave reviews from the folks at Thanksgiving. I changed the recipe by putting the candied pecans in wheels on top of the uncooked pie and then cooking it. Beautiful and delicious.

Thanksgiving is coming...are you looking for a new variation on pumpkin pie recipe? Look no further! This pie is incredible. The honey pecans make this pie stand out from the rest. Use a deep-dish pie plate, coarsely chop the nuts & leftover toffee in the food processor, and sprinkle over the pie right before serving. Serve with ice cream. Have made this pie many times...and made dozens of pumpkin pie recipes before finding this one. It's a keeper! Make two!

This was an awesome pie! I had been using the same Betty Crocker pumpkin pie recepie for years. The honey combined with pumpkin was brillent. It was so good that after I was done making the first one, I made a second pie for tomorrow night! I served it warm, and the candied pecans and whipped cream made the already perfect pie more sophisticated. I'll make this at least once a week this fall. My family of 5 ate this one no problem in one sitting! Fabulous!

The candied pecans were simple to prepare and made this pie really stand out. I chopped them up and spread over the top for a more consistent texture. Pie filling was delicious, also. I tested five pumpkin pie recipes over a month and this was my family's hands-down favorite. It is now our official holiday pie.

It was very good, though I'm a bit more of a traditionalist. Pecan pie is best as pecan pie and pumpkin is best as pumpkin. Since the pecans were a bit of a challenge, I chopped them fine in a food processor and make a "crumb topped" pie. I think it gave it a better texture overall.

I made this pie for my husband's and my first Thanksgiving together as a married couple. I don't normally care for pumpkin pie, but this one is delicious. I can't believe it only got 2 1/2 forks!!!!!

I really liked the honey component of this dessert. I agree that the pecans were a bit messy to make. I ended up serving them on the side instead of on the pie. Even my Mom really liked it!

Nice pumpkin pie with or without the wonderful honey whipping cream and crispy pecans. Crispy pecans were a challenge. I doubled, but think it might be better not to.
