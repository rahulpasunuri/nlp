Just OK. I also found this bland and if I made it again would substitute chicken or beef stock. If using a slow cooker remember to cut the liquid in half and use lots of fesch thyme.

I changed it a little. I mixed half yellow peas and half split yellow peas. Plus added some salt and pepper to our liking. I traded the ham for beef as my mother always made it this way and this is how I love it. The rest of the recipe... as is and good !!!

This is a wonderful soup for the ham bone from a honey-baked ham. I used a quart of low sodium chicken broth plus 4 cups of water instead of all water. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and we enjoyed it very much.

I thought this soup was bland; if making it again, I would substitute chicken broth and add more thyme.

Yellow pea soup with ham is traditionally served every Thursday night in Sweden. After eating the soup everyone fills up on Swedish pancakes. This is why you can find the peas at Ikea. I recommend trying the pancakes too!

Can't imagine why this recipe has never been rated. It's wonderful. Dried whole yellow peas are readily available in any supermarket (in Canada at least) and GOOD smoked pork hocks should be too. Follow the recipe exactly and prepare for heavenly bliss,

Whole yellow peas are also referred to as White Vatana when used in Indian cuisine.

Does anyone know a source for whole yellow peas, preferably organic? The only place I've ever found that carries them is IKEA, strangely enough.
