I've made this at least a dozen times--this is a favorite during summer for chicken & fish. Love it!

Not impressed. It looked like a great recipe, but fell short. I consider myself a very good cook, but have yet to find a recipe for BBQ sauce that is worth the effort. I am sticking with KC masterpiece for now.

Very easy to make. We had this BBQ sauce on some split chicken breasts on the barbeque. Very refreshing combination of flavors. If grilling be carefull the molasses will burn. Looking forward to trying this on some other meats.
