This dish is easy and economical. I used a 3lb chuck roast, adjusted ingredient quantities proportionately, and reduced cooking time to roughly 2:45. I did find the cooking liquid to be ever so slightly bitter, but I wanted a little more "beer" flavor so I used a pale ale instead of a lager. This was the likely culprit, and it was delicious anyway so no real harm done. One additional edit: I added a few cloves of smashed garlic. With beer and onions it just seemed right.

I can't fathom why so many people raved about this recipe. I made 17 pounds of chuck for Christmas dinner and made it two days ahead as recommended. Because I was making so much, I browned the onions in two large roasting pans at 400F for about 25 minutes, stirring frequently. For the beer, I used four bottles of Dos Equis Amber, a pilsner-style lager. The result tasted like beef in French Onion soup, and it was sweet from the sugars developed in the onions during browning. It took a lot of doctoring with beef bullion, some demi-glace concentrate, granulated garlic and, finally, two tablespoons of oyster sauce to deepen the flavor and counteract the sweetness. I also thickened the "soup" with cornstarch. This recipe doesn't hold a candle to my usual braised chuck. After seasoning the meat with salt, pepper and granulated garlic, I transfer it to a roasting pan, and add onion slices. I reduce some red wine in the pan I used to brown the meat, pour it over the beef, cover with foil, and bake at 325F for 2.5 to 3 hours. I remove the meat, skim the fat off the juices, add a little beef bullion, thicken with cornstarch, and strain. Far easier and very tasty.

I followed all the steps (tieing and browning the beef, browning the onions, etc) but because I made this with a 2-lb organic chuck roast (the largest I could find), I reduced the ingredient amounts and cooking times accordingly (eg, a pound of onions took just over 15 mins to brown, and I baked the roast for about 2.5 hours). After it was tender, I transferred the roast to a pyrex pan just large enough to hold it, covered it with the onions, poured the cooking juices all around, and let it marinate in the fridge for three days covered tightly with plastic wrap. After slicing it thinly, I reheated it with the sauce and onions in the microwave just til heated through. M-m-m. "A keeper", my husband said.

This turned out pretty good. The meat was very tender, even though it was not a great cut of meat. I really wish I would have used Guinness and some beef stock instead of the beer we choose out of our fridge (a bitter ale). The stock left a bit to be desired. Not the recipe's fault though -- it called for a lager.

Very good, and very easy. I added slivers of garlic to the cooking liquid, and ended up using 3 bottles of beer. Will make again!

Easy and tasty didn't take long for the meat to start falling apart and I'm sure that had something to do with the beer. I just covered my pan with aluminum foil to keep the moisture in, worked fine.

So easy to prepare and it comes out super delicious and tender! I've made it twice already and it will be a regular meal in our house.

This was really quick to prepare and turned out really tender and flavorful! I winged it a little b/c I don't think my roast was 5 lbs, so I only put one beer in, but I should have done two b/c there wasn't juice to make sauce at the end. I didn't have parchment paper either. So, that probably would've helped keep the moisture in more. The meat was still great, though!

Yum! I purchased a quarter of a grass fed cow last fall and have tried numerous roast recipies. This by far takes the cake. The beer and onions tempered the 'wild' taste of the beef. The meat fell apart as a roast should but didn't with other recipies I've tried! A definite 'do over'. I'm sending the recipie to the man who raises the cattle in Newton, WI. I will not hesitate to buy another quarter this year now that I know I can prepare an excellent roast.

Excellent flavor and texture...fell apart after only 3 hours. I set my oven at 325 degrees. Used a 3 lb English cut chuck roast, seared the devil out of it in a LeCreuset dutch oven and used approx. 1.5 lbs. of yellow onions. Added 1 tsp. dried rosemary and 1 tsp. dried thyme after the onions were well browned. Used 1 bottle Leinenkugel Classic Amber and added 6 oz. water with 1 Tbl. red wine vinegar. Used the parchment paper and flipped the roast after 1.5 hours. Wonderful flavor.

Served this to our dinner club & it was huge success. Rubbed the meat with a dry brisket rub I had in the pantry (I am from TX afterall) & used Tecate beer. The meat was wonderfully tender & delicious! Received a lot of kuddos from the group especially the men.

This is an exceptionally forgiving recipe. Followed it exactly as written ... however, due to an illness in the house - with no one having an appetitie - did not eat until 4 days later after the prep work. Re-heated in oven as suggested. Served with baby red potatoes and roasted carrots and oh my! it was very well received. Also, the meat made for fabulous sandwiches the next day.

Certainly a hit! However, when I cook this again, I will be sure to add whole potatoes and carrots as well. Really yummy!

What a nice surprise! I was ooking for something different than my typical roast with red wine. This was delicious! Sweet, salty and spicy all in one. Followed the advice of other and omitted the salt in the onions - glad I did that. Also, Sprinkled 1/2 tsp. into the onions while browning. Use Yuengling insead of Bud :) LOVED this and forwarded the link to some friends.

This recipe is so easy to follow and the results are delicious. Just made this for my supper club. It was a big hit. I did not change a thing and it went off without a glitch. Used grass-fed beef that has a wonderful flavor. Enjoy!

After reading the reviews I was excited to try this and was hoping for 4 forks.I used enough salt and was careful to brown everything well. Definitely a good solid recipe but no WOW for 4 forks. Maybe it needs some thyme or rosemary?

Exceptional! I threw some sun dried tomatoes and capers in the onion mix and used balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine. Paired with cauliflower and Yukon gold potatoes it made a very VERY nice and hearty meal. Some German Pilsner style beer (I used Warsteiner) rounded the whole experience off. Will definitely make it again !

Actually tried this recipe with a smaller shoulder roast & less beer & onions in a crock pot. Was a big hit with the husband. Plan on making it again, in the oven, for our dinner club group.

Good recipe with a few enhancements - a little extra salt and a tablespoon of fresh chopped dill will give it extra depth of flavor. Serve it with fluffy mashed potatoes and a green salad with a zesty vinaigrette, and gingerbread for dessert and you'll have a happy family!

Didn't change a thing except using the crockpot and thickening the sauce a little. Served over garlic mashed potatoes. Easy weekday meal!

I followed the recipe except I used a venison roast instead of beef and I cooked it the day before and reheated it. The meat was very tender and the onions were very good, but a little salty for my taste. My husband thought it was delicious. I'm thinking some of the salt from the meat fell off and made the onions saltier than they should have been. At the time, I remember thinking it seemed like a lot of salt to add to the meat but I followed the directions. I would make this again because it was very easy and nice it can be made ahead of time.

Interesting flavor..... I used bottom round roast and added garlic. After reading all the reviews and suggestions, I didn't need the parchment paper because the cover for the dutch oven pot was sufficient. I didn't want the liquid to evaporate too quickly so I kept the oven @ 300 degrees. My son enjoyed it very much and found the beef tender after 4 hours of cooking. Would I make this again? Probably yes, but I would try a different brand of beer (I used budweiser) and use chuck roast instead.

This recipe looks good. But what an amazing set of reviews. "add enough salt and it'll taste good" or "it's find with enough vinigar"...as much as I like an old-fashioned pot-roast type meal, the comments made me really aware of the regional "norms" of cooking. Or "cookin'".

Poker Guys say good eatin' here. Like old school Pot Roast you can make this one go anywhere you want. We made this recipe then spiced it up with some,Ancho and Tabasco chile's. Good for the Cooler evenings for dinner, and as the Guys said,you can always drink the Beer Sauce!

I have made this basic recipe for years sans the vinigar. This is my basic pot roast. I put all the ingrediance in my self basting cast iron pot (after browning the meat)in a 210d oven in the AM before work. Upon return I can serve as is or add potatoes carrots. I will also add a couple of tbs of flour mixed with the juice if I want gravy. Agine this is a great base recipe for so many meals I sometime use beef or chicken stock instead of beer. I have shredded the leftover beef for enchiladas.

This was a very simple, delicious recipe. If you found no taste, you didn't do something right; possibly you did not follow the recipe. I am always amazed when people complain about a recipe but don't follow the recipe. The only change I had to make was the beer. I am not a beer drinker but had Sam Adams lager in the house for family. I am not sure what the taste differnce is, but the Sam Adams did perfectly fine. I would definitely recommend making it the night before and warming up the next day. Also, I had a great way to use the leftovers. I shredded the meat and added a very little spicy steak sauce (or you could use BBQ) - just enough to keep the shredded beef together without losing the flavor - and heated it for sandwiches. I would recommend this recipe to anyone looking for an idea for dinner. I LOVE IT!

No, it's not gourmet. Yes, it was delicious and perfect for a cold, winter day. I had bottom round on hand, so I used that. I used Great Lakes' Dortmunder Gold because Budweiser grosses me out. Definitely get a good sear on your meat and caramelize those onions. I also took some other reviewers' suggestions and added chopped carrots and potatoes to the pot, some sliced garlic, diced tomatoes, and a bit of beef stock to up the liquid a bit. I let it cool, stuck it in the fridge, and reheated the entire pot in the oven the next day, and served it. I can't believe some people thought this was bland!

This was awesome! I don't give many recipes 4 forks, but this one deserves it. It was tender, delicious, and easy. It's true that it's no super-fancy gourmet meal, but 'rustic' is in right now. I would definitely consider serving this to guests. The people who said that this was bland probably didn't use enough salt. That's usually the problem when people write silly things like that. They probably also didn't get a good enough sear on the meat. You need to season it really well, and then sear the heck out of it. You then need to really caramelize the onions in the SAME pot. All of this may take a lot longer than the recipe indicates. Also, if you use the suggested Budweiser, you probably will end up with 'boiled beef.' Yuengling worked really well. We will certainly make this again.

My husband loved this recipe. I halved the roast, oil, vinegar and used 2 onions (instead of measuring 3lbs) and had no problem with the taste. I'm glad I strained the cooked juices so I could defat before serving. I generally go easy on salt and it barely needed any tweaking on the plate, so I was pretty happy.

maybe this recipe just doesn't halve well, but i found it bland and watery. the meat tasted a little better the next day, but even with lots of garlic and vegetables it was flavorless. a waste of good meat.

This recipe is ridiculously simple and absolutely AMAZING. Just made it for my family from Seattle, to give them a little taste of downhome Northeast cooking, and they loved it. My weight-watching teenaged sister ate three plates like she had never seen food before. A few notes: (1) The first time we made this my significant other threw in some potatoes, carrots and celery. I forgot to do this the second time around and was sorry (makes rounding out the meal easier and they're soooo tasty). (2) My significant other made this with the vinegar first time around, which was good, but I decided to switch in a can of chopped tomatoes with juice instead. I liked the tomatoes better (liked having the tomatoes in the sauce and think it's a deeper, more flavorful tang). (3) My significant other originally went to the trouble of doing the parchment paper business. I think the purpose is to keep all the moisture right next to the meat to make it more tender. I don't know if it works or not but think it's a pain and skipped that step second time around. If you're looking for a good pot roast recipe THIS IS IT!!!!

This was very good. I took the advice and added garlic and served the next day. I also added some new potatoes and carrots about halfway through the cooking time. I'll save the loftover juice for stock, it was yummy.

Great recipe. Few ingredients and easy to prepare. I made it a day ahead per the recipes suggestion and it was exceptional. I also followed the advice of some others and added about 5 cloves of crushed garlic. I can't imagine how anybody could describe this dish as tasteless. As long as you put a good sear/crust on your meat and brown your onions properly there will be plenty of flavour. I served it over egg noodles and the family raved. This one's a keeper!

I must say I don't understand the reviewers who said this was tasteless. Is it an astonishing gourmet meal? No, but I was very happy with it. I followed the recipe slmost exactly (but like a few others I added a few cloves of crushed garlic). I used very good beer; maybe that's the difference. Cooked it one day, ate it the next, so the flavor had time to develop. The chuck creates a TON of fat. When I make this again, I will strain the solids and pick the fat off the meat as soon as it's cool enough to handle. While I'm doing that, I'll put the strained liquid in the fridge so I can defat it right away. If you leave the whole thing in the pan and wait to defat, the onions make it difficult. All in all, I call this great comfort food.

We made this recipe two nights ago and followed the recipe & picture instructions to a tee. Then we cooled it & removed the fat & sliced the meat when cool. We had it last night and it was a terrible disappointment. It just had no flavor at all! The texture was fine and the onions ok, but the meat was bland beyond rescue. My hsuband referred to it "boiled meat".

The recipe was great...everyone loved it and I had no problems with the liquid amounts. We did add lots of garlic but only because my family loves it. I am sure the parchment helps reduce any evaporation from the pot ..a tight seal. This one is a permanent for my family and especially for friends who need a little chicken soup so to speak...or in this case a good "roasting". Salut

I loved this recipe! Saw the step by step photo spread in Gourmet and had to make it. Unlike other reviewers, I had no problem with the amount of braising liquid. I did lower the oven temp to 300 and braised a bit longer, so maybe that helped. Added a couple crush garlic cloves and used Shiner Commemorator for the beer. YUM! The leftover braising liquid would make a great french onion soup base!

We used a cheap blade roast - turned out fantastic. The only thing we did different was add slivers of garlic in to the roast, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. We found at the end there was very little liquid left, so we added about 2 cups of beef broth to the onions to serve with the roast. The meat was fork tender - awesome. Don't know what all the negative reviewers are talking about! Do agree strongly that the meat tastes even better the next day. Outstanding!

Don't serve this to a super bowl crowd or you may have to run for it. It is bland to the extreme with a watery sauce in which onion floats helplessly. I have to redo the sauce into something with taste by additions and further cooking to save the day.

This recipe is outstanding, and super easy (and relatively inexpensive) to make. I adjusted the amounts since my roast was smaller and may have cooked it too long because it was so tender that it fell apart - slicing it would not have worked. But the flavor was superb and I served it over egg paparadelle to a very happy family.

This was excellent with a few modifications. The beer cooks down quite a bit at 350 degrees. I reduced the oven temp to 250 degrees and cooked a bit longer. I had to add water to the sauce after cooking so that there was enough gravy.
