My favorite fondue...A Christmas Eve tradition. It never disappoints.

Easy and excellent! As other reviewers have noted, make certain you use good wine!

First time making fondue. This recipe is spot on!! I followed a reviewers suggestion on mixing the shredded cheese with the corn starch and stick with the slurry of a little corn starch with kirsch. Keep stirring-- added a few house made sausages, grilled and sliced from whole foods for a man's type meal. Awesome!!

This fondue is delicious. I love garlic, so I wouldn't dream of discarding it. Instead, I minced and cooked the garlic, and included it in the fondue (just before adding the wine). Since the recipe has so few ingredients, make sure the wine you use tastes good on its own (to avoid the whole "garbage in, garbage out" scenario). If you find that you want a smoother fondue, try making a slurry of cornstarch (~1 tablespoon) and water and adding this as you heat and stir the fondue in the last step. This recipe reheats well if you have leftovers or want to prepare it in advance. Make it, you'll love it.

This recipe is spot on to what my Swiss friend gave me years ago. I use a mix of Emmental, Gruyere & Appenzeller, put the cheeses in a ziplock bag with the cornstarch & shake it-it makes it easier to prepare the cheeses ahead of time. When it comes time for the kirch addition, I'll make a paste out of an additional 1/2 tbl.

Outstanding authentic fondue recipe...just like my Aunt's recipe from Switzerland...except you'll need to add 1/4 teaspoon of fresh grated nutmeg, stir and serve! Excellent!

Excellent fondue recipe. We probably could have used a little bit more white wine. Also, it took us a while to realize that emmental cheese is swiss cheese. This could have saved us a bunch of time at the grocery store.

Finally a fondue recipe that worked for me. I upped the kirsch to 2 tbsp, for kicks.

This is the real thing. The recipe matches fondue as made in Switzerland. For authentic fondue, follow this rather than the others on this site. They may be good, but this is Swiss.

I'm glad I did this for supper. It was super easy and I had a fab time making it using my Le Creuset pot, gruyere and emmental cheese. Although it didn't equal to our Aux Vieux Carouge experience in Switzerland, this is just not too bad at all. Will definitely do it again with revisions by reviewers. Maybe our Swiss experience can be duplicated very soon.

The kids and I made this using Sutter Home Sauvignon Blanc that I had on hand and we left out the kirsch. It made up relatively quickly and was a major hit! We'll definitely make this again! :)

Easy and delicious. We serve it with lots of pickled veggies on the side and dip things like broccoli, apples, bread of course, pears, and whatever else we have in the house that sounds good with cheese!

Made this last night as a meal. Usually I come out of a cheese fondue in a food coma but thought this did not feel as heavy. Kept the garlic cloves in the fondue pot; made sure they didn't burn and gave it a nice garlicky aroma. Easy peasy, classic. Threw in some smoked paprika and cracked white pepper for a little something else.

Great Christmas Eve fondue recipe, but I feel compelled to share a slightly different cheese ratio: 1/2 lb. Gruyere, 1/4 lb. Emmental, 1/4 lb. Appenzeller. The Appenzeller has a slightly nutty, earthy flavor that takes this fondue from good to GREAT.

A fun and fabulous Christmas Eve dinner. Yum!

This is to the person who asked if this will transport and I can tell you I've been doind a recipe very similar to this for years and the leftovers actually freeze and reheat well. I suspect transporting it wouldn't be a huge problem but you should reheat it slowly on the stove to bring the temp back up.

Very close to the original. I lived in Switzerland for several years. In Bern they also added a dollop of brown mustard and the juice of half a lemon. Also very important grated nutmeg and ground pepper.

This was an excellent traditional style cheese fondue. Will definitely be making this again.

i am a diehard fondue fan and this is the real deal. always toss the grated cheese with the cornstarch (dry, not mixed with the kirsch) first, and up the cornstarch to 3T. the kirsch can be added separately with no ill effect and this will ensure you have a beautifully melted fondue with no separation. looking up the recipe again so i can make at the chalet christmas eve. happy holidays everyone!

I've made this before and it was wonderful. However, I'd like to take it TO a friends house for a party. Will it transport? Does anyone know?

I've made this several times, always as per the recipe (water rather than kirsch option), and it's always delicious! Every time we have it, we try dipping something new. Bread, steamed broccoli, raw apple, raw red pepper, and carmelized shallots have become our faves. We're going to try tortellini next time and perhaps roast potatoes. We'll also try experimenting with the cheeses we use next (different cheeses are suggested in the overview to this recipe). My tips aren't that different from anyone else's, but here's the summary: use a wooden spoon, add one handful of cheese to the wine at a time and allow it to dissolve before adding the next handful, stir in a figure-eight motion to avoid clumping, and don't worry about the consistency too much until you put the cornstarch in and give it a chance to do its job. Different dinner parties have different rules for the punishment for losing whatever you are dipping in the fondue pot. Downing a shot of kirsch or having to give everyone at the table a kiss come to mind.

My first cheese fondue. Delicious and comes together quite easily. I used Organic Valley Baby Swiss instead of Emmental, and Calvados instead of Kirsch because I already had them on hand. Dipped baguette, fingerling potatoes (halved and steamed first), kielbasa, raw broccoli and mini bell peppers (halved).

I made this for friends but it didn't turn out. I'm pretty sure I did something wrong. So here is my question, when all the cheese is incorporated into the wine, should it look all smooth and velvety or does the cornstarch and kirsh do that? I think there was my problem. I was waiting and waiting for it to emulsify before adding the kirsh, but it never got there. I really want to try this again, but I'm hoping some feedback can explain my mistake.

I have made this several times, including during my time living in Switzerland when the gruyere was plentiful! Pay special attention to the part about adding the cheese gradually and stirring in a figure eight not a circular motion. It can lead to lumps and seperation if you add to much cheese at once or melt it too quickly. I use a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch as well. We substituted "swiss" cheese for the emmental (perhaps they are the same?) but you simply shouldn't substitute gruyere. Good luck.

Agreed -- don't try this ahead of time. I have made this several times, and it's always a hit; since Kirsch is something I never have around, I've never used it -- a splash more wine has always done the trick.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I'd like to respond to a question: No, do NOT make it ahead. Make it while your guests are sitting at the table, so they can watch you. It's a great presentation, and everyone will be impressed. Steam the veggies and cut the bread ahead of time, instead.

Excellent. I highly recommend this recipe.

This is the classic cheese fondue recipe, you can't go wrong with it. My family likes this recipe better than similar recipes that call for a 1/4 cup of kirsch, the cherry flavor is just too strong in that quantity. We like to use garlic sauted chicken and zucchini for dipping as well.

My husband made this last night for our next door neighbors & us. It was the best fondue he's ever made! The suggestion from another reader about adding the flour to the grated cheese really helped to blend the cheese & wine. Our guests RAVED about the fondue. Unfortunately there was none left for our daughter when she returned home.

This is a question - can I make this recipe ahead and warm when ready to serve? I'd like to be prepared in advance of my guests arriving.

This is a good basic cheese fondue recipe. I used to work for a Swiss company and tried for years to replicate fondue back in the states. A Swiss friend finally gave me a tip. Swiss white wines are more acidic and break down the cheese better then American wine. They suggested that I toss the grated cheese with a tablespoon of flour. That did the trick and solved the problem of the cheese and wine separating. Another tip is to combine various types of imported swiss cheese. Sometimes I use Emmental, Gruyere and Vacherin or combinations of the three depending on price or availability.

The best! I was a little worried because it looked kind of clumpy on the stove, but I let it simmer and my friend grabbed the spoon and started stirring as I did other things, and when it made it to the table, it was perfect! Definitely mix a bit of cornstarch in with the cheese as well, and I mixed some nutmeg in with the cornstarch before I added it. Btw... first time fondue maker here... any first timers, this recipe is hard to screw up!

I made this for a new year's eve party and it turned out great. I've had trouble before with this recipe but I think dusting the cheese with cornstarch and using a cast iron fondue pot are the keys here. I couldn't believe how easy it was.

I am from Switzerland and can give some adive to the cook from San Francisco: Make sure that the wine only simmers while to put in the cheese. Add the cheese "handful by handful". The mixture should never boil and "bubble". While you do this constantly steer with a wooden (!) spoon. After the cheese is melted immediatly add the cornstarch-Kirsch-mixture and serve.

"BRUSSELS", THE PREVIOUS REVIEWER, IS CORRECT-THIS, WITH HER CHANGES, IS THE RECIPE WE'VE MADE FOR YEARS. I'VE ALSO ADDED THE KIRSCH AFTER THE CHEESE HAS MELTED WITH A DASH OF NUTMEG AND CAYENNE.

I didn't make this recipe, but living in Europe, I've made fondue several times. Definitely add Appendorf cheese to the main recipe. To keep the cheese from "globbing", mix the cornstarch (2-3 Tbsp. 1 is not enough) with the shredded cheese first. Add the kirsch to the warm wine. Add the cheese a handful at a time, and don't add the next handful until the first is mostly melted. This still goes pretty fast. Before eating, stir in some nutmeg, and some black pepper. Bon appetit!

We may have done something wrong, but our cheese did not melt into a smooth and creamy fondue. Separated from the wine. It took a chemist (me) to save it by adding a knob of butter and more cornstarch solution to stabilize it. This recipe looks true to tradition, but didn't work in my house.
