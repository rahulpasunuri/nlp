It was quite dry and slightly bland so I added cardamom and cinnamon to the spices. I also added some red wine vinegar and honey to moisten up the dish and give more flavor. I would make it again but with my additions.

Didn't think there was anything missing here. Interesting, subtle flavor despite the few ingredients and quick composition that was very much appreciated by us next to the chicken tagine with apricots and almonds on this site.

Really liked this version of Moroccan carrot salad. For the cooks who found it bland, note that there's no salt in the list of ingredients. It's mentioned only at the very end of the recipe. Did you remember to use it?

I steamed julien cut carrots and added the saffron sauce, and they turned out great, but I'll try the recipe's way too.

This recipe is a good start, I added chopped green onions, a small garlic clove and cardamom powder. Also the juice of one lemon. I did not have any saffron home so the was no cooking, just chopping - I used the processor to pulse everything until it was finely chopped. Really flavorful.

Very disappointing. It had a fairly strong cumin flavor that I liked, but generally seemed to be lacking something, perhaps an acid like vinegar or citrus juice. Definitely not worth the effort.

I doubled the green raisins and used fresh plump ones. I also cooked the carrots in a sealable oven bag to keep the carrots moist and let the saffron spice saturate the carrots. This is very good! I added the left overs to ginger-carrot soup, which was wonderful!

Quick and easy and great with a mid-Eastern dinner. Nice combination of flavours - but then I'm a sucker for cumin and cilantro. (PS I used a food processor to grate the carrots - the large-holed shredder, no problem.)

When I first made this recipe I felt there was something missing - but I reread the ingredients and there wasn't anything. So, I added some red wine vinegar and chopped walnuts to give it some life - and it helped a bunch.

This is a good one especially if you like new and interesting flavors. I used raisins instead of currants.
