Absolutely excellent, and not too difficult. Don't forget to freeze the crust before baking! It needs the compote and whipped cream to cut the sweetness.

I have made this several times - usually for Thanksgiving or Christmas. I pretty much follow the recipe except for experimenting with the different nuts. Sometimes I leave out the walnuts and add extra pecans and almonds, since I think those have such great flavor. Really, I think you could use just about any combination of nuts and this would turn out great. You could add more orange peel and I also add a small amount of Grand Marnier if I have it on hand (maybe 1 teaspoon). I never want the orange flavor to be too overpowering, just nice and subtle. Oh, and also this recipe is pretty easy as far as a pie goes.

I have not made this tart yet but plan to this week and wanted to thank everyone for their very usefuls suggestions. I plan to reduce the sugar and increase the orange zest. And I think I'll use a combination of macadamia nuts, hazelnuts, pecans, and almonds. I'll let you know how it turns out too!

Tasted great! Decided to use 1/3 c. of white sugar instead of 2/3 c in recipe. May even cut the white sugar out altogether. I didn't make the pastry but used prepared sweetened tart shells. Baking time reduced by about half.

I used pecans, cashews and almonds and realized that pecans rule - they taste the most delicious in this type of pie (which is probably why Pecan Pie is such a classic as opposed to, say, Cashew Pie...). Used - gasp - a frozen pie shell and it was easy and delicious. After everyone had a piece, it was picked at till there was nothing less (a very good sign).

I made it with walnuts, cashews and pecans - no almonds, and put in more orange zest than the recipe called for. It was absolutely delicious and does not need anything else on the side. The crust is just perfect.

I had this tart at a party. The cook used only cashews and it was fabulous! A nice alternative to fruit. You've got to try it!

I feel guilty since everyone else made this for Christmas and I made this just to experiment. I didn't make the compote, but think plain whipped cream (ie unsweetened) cut the sweetness nicely. The crust is fantastically tender. I did the whole thing in the food processor and only used 1 tablespoon of water. Just process until it comes together, no more. Then bring dough together with your hands and flatten into a disk. I will certainly bring this recipe out over the holidays. Now I know it's a keeper!

This is a gourmet version of the classic (very rich) pecan pie. Nice visual presentation. Transports well since it's so sturdy and is meant to be served at room temperature. I found the crust dough a little difficult to work with and a little too wet, but maybe I overprocessed the shortening into the flour. The filling almost, but not quite, overflowed out of the tart shell, so to be safe, bake the tart on another baking pan. Next time, I will double the orange zest since I could barely taste it. Like Tulsa, I think the compote is needed in order to balance the extreme sweetness of the tart, though I'm not sure I'd normally put those nuts and fruits together in a single dish...

What a different treat for a holiday dessert. Rich and delicious. My family doen't like walnuts so I just added more of the other nut varieties. 2 family members and counting have asked for the recipe. Bravo Bon Appetit!

Made this for Christmas dinner and it was very well received. Make the compote. It wasn't as pretty as I thought it could be, but it really cut the sweetness of the tart and took this recipe to 4 forks.

This one made me look like a real cook! ;) I realized at the last minute that I had no shortening, and made the crust solely with butter. It shrank a little, but was still delicious and easy (I added a few shakes of cinnamon to the dough, which worked well.) The flavor of the orange-infused caramel is what puts this over the top, however. Just delicious! (I may never make pecan pie again.) (That's a lie. I love pecan pie. But this tart is a keeper.)

I'm not good at crusts, but even pieced together in the tart pan, this was easy to make and tasted great. If you like pecan pie, this is a great twist. Forget the compote - it has enough flavor on its own.

Excellent dessert - I made this and the double chocolate torte from the same issue - and this was the hands down hit of the party.

Was served this at a party & had to go out & buy the magazine for the recipe afterwards! Excellent!!
