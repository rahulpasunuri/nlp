This is such an easy dish to make- great for a work night meal. Followed the recipe and it was really delicious. Served with crusty bread and a salad! Delicious!!!

I made this last night for my husband and I. I cut back a bit on the amount of the seafood as it was just two of us. I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with all the juice, other than that did not change a thing. Easy and delicious!!!

Since I was preparing this for my wife and kids (ages 15 and 11), I cut the cayenne in half (unlike using vegetables and herbs to season while cooking--which is crucial--the cayenne can be added to an individual's serving to suit the diner's taste. Otherwise, I tend to stay true to a recipe I'm cooking for the first time). After the first bite, they all said this recipe was a winner and would love for me to cook this again. Do not thin the sauce before adding the seafood. The juices from the scallops and shrimp will do that. Pair with a Chablis or Chablis-style Sauvignon Blanc (stainless steel fermented, no oak aging, dry with light citrus tones).

Wonderfull flavourfull dish. Had it on its own, I added a but of water at the end to thin it down a bit, added too much though. Next time I make it I will serve it over angelhair pasta. This dish was universally enjoyed. Definite make again.

Excellent recipe. Lots of flavor, great texture. Had it on its own with a side of cornbread and then tried it on top of buttery rice the next night. Better on the rice. I didn't have any scallops on hand and used more shrimp. Added chopped okra to the recipe and it gave a more "Louisiana" feel to the dish.

Really very easy to make. I was worried that the sauce was too thick, but once the seafood was added it was the perfect consistency. Followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used additional peppers instead of celery.

great, I added a couple changes

This recipe was delicious. I made a few small changes based on some of the other ratings. I added some white wine and a small can of tomato sause because it seemed a bit thick. I served it with a over rice with crusty bread. Will defintetly make again.

This recipe was very easy and tasty - except that we found the sauce overpowered the delicate flavor of the bay scallops. Next time we will only use shrimp. Great dish for company since you can make the sauce ahead of time, you can use the food processor, and it cooks up quickly. We served it over rice, but a nice loaf of crusty bread would work well too.

Fun to make! It had a great, fresh flavor to it. I held off on the Cayanne, to keep the heat down. Good company dish.

Excellent! I also added chicken broth and bumped up the cayenne quite a bit. Used the food processor to mince the veggies, which saved a ton of time. Other that the chopping, this is a super easy dish with big favors. Sourdough on the side was a great compliment. Will definitely make again.

Great flavor and easy to make. Will definitely make again and again.

Good dish, but very bland when made strictly to recipe. I will make again, but will try adding more spices. Not even a healthy dose of Frank's red hot saved it this time.

Excellent recipe, very easy, very quick...if you have the ingredients on hand....this is a quick and easy meal to make after work. I did like one comment said and added 1/2 cup of broth. I also did not have any celery on hand so used the same amount of yellow pepper....just delicious...I served it with orzo.

This was great. Added a couple of extra cloves of garlic, some chicken stock for flavor and to give a bit of extra sauce, and the entire can of tomato juice. I like a little more tomato so added a bit of tomato paste as well (bad with measurements-maybe a T or 2?). Fantastic sauce to dip bread in. Also a tip for leftovers--we made way too much of this so after one day of leftovers (and sopping up much of the liquid with our bread) decided to make it into a spicy pasta sauce with some canned crushed tomatoes and tomato sauce and garlic and was equally delicious.

Wonderful lentin dish!

Everyone loved this and it was so easy! I used bay scallops, tripled the cayenne, and served it over rice. Only had stewed tomatoes on haqnd and it came out fine. Mine wasn't soupy or too hot either. Next day served the leftovers over a grilled cheese quesadilla and I liked that even more! Would certainly make again.

This was very simple and delicious. I used bay scallops and served the dish over risotto. Mine didn't exactly come out as a soup, although I think I followed the recipe, just more as a sauce. Will definitely make again!

We loved it, and it was simple to make. It may be interesting to try over rice, rather than to eat as a soup.

This is a keeper. Served over rice and the boss announced it as very hearty. I love hot stuff, and this was more "powerful" than flaming hot. A new Lenten favorite!

We used the bay scallops. Excellent, easy, and delicious. Served over rice. Will use this one again, thinking about going with 1/2 lb of scallops and adding some mudbugs.

This was awesome. Everybody absolutely loved it. We served it as an appetizer but would have happily eaten it as a meal.

Excellent- will definitely make again. I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of cayenne, because I like it really hot. Tastes even better the next day.

This was very, very tasty indeed (demanding girlfriend agreed). Because we both like spicy hot food, I tripled the amount of cayenne pepper. I've made this dish three times; it's definitely a winner.

This was just yummy. Made it for my husband and parents and everyone loved it. Followed the instructions minus the tobasco. This would be great with crab or lobster. Plan to make it for my next dinner party. Oh, by the way, it was really EASY to make.

Great. My children, 8 and 9 years old, loved it also. I skipped the hot sauce, but think I will use some next time. Served over rice as suggested.

Nothing to add - easy and delicious. A great recipe for a novice cook - or an experienced cook who is short on time.

Very quick to make (don't let the instructions scare you), and was simply fantastic. Will make it again for company. And I agree, best with white rice, although I put the leftovers over angel hair pasta and that was good as well!

One word, DELICIOUS! Definitely serve over steamed white rice. I like mine jucier so I added some chicken broth to it, about 1/2 cup. Don't be intimidated by the long instructions, it's a very simple dish to make. I loved it so much I will make it again this week. My friends will think I worked all day this. DM

Very good. Used fresh tomatoes peeled and chopped because I have a lot of them. Served over rice -- which I recommend.

Besides chopping the veggies, this is a quick one and it is DEE-licious!!!! The more tabasco, the better!

I liked this so much I've made it twice in the last week! It is quick and easy. I think the spices are perfect though we do tend to like spicy food. I did serve it over rice. The way the shrimp and scallops are cooked they come out very tasty and tender.

This meal was great, my husband raved about it. I didn't add any tobasco sauce, and only added half the cayenne pepper, and it was still spicy. Great recipe.

We were on an out of town week-end and I wanted to make something special. We both like seafood and this recipe hit the spot. We love it.

I added a little cajun seasoning and a few red pepper flakes and served it over brown rice. I think white rice would be better and I overpowered the shrimp and scallops by making the sauce too spicy. Would try it again but stick to the recipe.

Was too hot! Way too much pepper, hot sauce, etc. for other ingredients. IF I ever bothered with this recipe again I would add hot things only to taste.

Excellant recipe except that I would add rice to make it more like a Jambalaya
