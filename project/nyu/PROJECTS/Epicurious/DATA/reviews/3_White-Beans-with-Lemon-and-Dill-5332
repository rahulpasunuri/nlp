Upon reading the other reviews, I decided to nix the cream, half the oil& lemon juice and peel. Yummm! Served it warm and again cold. Liked it both ways but esp. the cold version. Nice for summer with fish and it's a one dish side, no pots. Yeah! I like the fact that it's different than the usual sides. Will use this a lot.

This was yummy, it was easy and quick to make. The flavors were great together and that's what makes this dish so easy to eat.

At first I thought this would be a very subtile dish, but having made it I can only say that I didn't like it at all. I thought the whipping cream was overdoing it a little, since white beans are already rather creamy. Also the tablespoon of dill and the tablespoon of lemon peel were much too much. Simply not a good dish.

Very tasty--great combination of flavors! And even better, it was easy to throw together.

This recipe was quick, easy, and delicious. It was simple enough to make on a weeknight and offered a nice change from our usual rice-based side dish.

Fast, easy, and wonderful accompaniment to light dishes.
