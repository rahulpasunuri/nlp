Awesome dish. I've made it so many times! I love the horseradish which adds a fabulous zing to otherwise bland cauliflower

Rating: 4
This has become a staple dish either for a weeknight veggie dinner or as a side at a fancier meal - great with a lamb or meat roast. I follow the recipe explicitly though make sure to shrink the recipe if the head of cauliflower is small. Also recommend increasing the volume of the topping as it's delicious and key to the dish. Enjoy!

Made this just last night for my vegetarian thanks giving and my guests loved it... this is definitely a keeper. Thank you for sharing this recipe Epicurious. :)

YUM! I did change it up a bit but this recipe is super good. I cooked the veggies (used cauliflower and a few brussels sprouts) in vegetable broth. I didn't have any scallions, so I used chives from my garden. I didn't have cracker, so I substituted with bread crumbs made from my homemade bread. I omitted the horseradish -- just didn't sound good to me. Great flavors and perfect for a cold, rainy November day.

Here's what I did: made a veg stock, boiled the cauliflower in it until fork tender, separated the stems and florets, riced the florets, and finely chopped the stems to add a little texture. Sound a little elaborate? It probably was for a weekday dish, but having made a ton of casseroles with similar ingredients, I can say boiling the veg in stock added some complexity to the overall flavor. I was aiming for something grit-like in texture, and the added step of ricing the florets not only eliminated some of the moisture from the cauliflower that likely would have watered down the mixture, it did add a little textural contrast. For those wanting something a little more elevated or whatever, this might be the way to go for you. Maybe not. Maybe you eat foie five days a week. In which case, la di dah. Anyways, this is a pretty good and simple recipe overall, and probably endlessly tweakable. I would not say this is a replacement for mac and cheese exactly, but something like a mashed potato mac and cheese, starchy amalgam.

the whole family loves this, even the 3 yr old. I either use panko or grind up whole wheat bread to make crumbs. I use a creamy horseradish, so it's a lot milder but still has good flavor. yum! sometimes we just have this and salad.

I don't usually change up a recipe the first time I try it, but I made this using what I had on hand...cauliflower and broccoli, minced red onion, skim milk, and 2% milk shredded cheddar...and it turned out remarkably good, and a lighter version of the original. The horseradish crumbs really give it an added texture. I will definitely make this again, but for guests I will make it full fat.

Love this recipe so much, we decided to make it for our Thanksgiving guests. Can't wait to share with them! I wouldn't change a thing!

I'm usually apathetic towards cauliflower but this recipe is exceptional. I have learned that the success of the recipe is contingent upon the quality of the cheddar. An excellent extra sharp white cheddar really makes the all the flavours come together.

Delicious, hearty, flavorful winter side dish.

Sorry--I meant to say I used half regular cheddar and then half feta.

Delicious. I only had soy milk, so I used that instead of soy milk. This dish no doubt would have been richer with the whole milk, but it was totally fine and delicious with soy. I also didn't have Sharp Cheddar--just regular, so I substitute feta cheese to give the dish some tanginess. Lovely, lovely lovely.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone in attendance -- except for the kids who can't deal with anything other than mac 'n' cheese from the box -- loved it. It's beautiful, it's flavorful. Make it, love it.

Oh Yummy! Must confess I ran out of time while making dinner, so I didn't bother with the crust or baking it- and it was delicious! This satisfies your childlike craving for superyum-cheesey-veggies. Hubby said it was the best food he'd had all week! If you skip baking it, my advice is to make sure you start the sauce before you boil the cauliflower. The sauce takes longer to finish, and you can always keep it on low while you get the veggies cooked.

Me again. I have been asked to bring the cauliflower gratin to a Graduation party next week.I think I will try Ritz crackers in place of the saltines for added flavor. Will let you know how it turned out and comments.

Rating: 4
This is the second time I have made this gratin. Knowing cauliflower is pretty bland, this time around I sprinked some Lawry's Seasoning Salt over the cooked cauliflower. I used extra sharp cheese, used red onion I had on hand, and doubled the sauce for the saltines. I topped the gratin off with Paprika for color. Neignbors who dropped in all wanted a taste, but I told them it was cooked yet. It is too good to share tonight. I am serving it with baked Grouper.

Huge disappointment. I didn't like this at all. I tried spicing it up by adding garlic and cayene but it still came out bad. I think it may have been the amount of thyme the recipe calls for. It seemed to overpower the other flavors. I may try it again with less thyme.

Rating: 3
so, let's be clear here -- there is NO SUCH THING as a 3lb cauliflower. i got the largest one in the grocery store and it weighed only 1.5#. that was just the right size for a square 9x9 pan. the recipe is exactly as described -- cauliflower mac and cheese. tasty, for what it is. you can make it a bit more interesting by diversifying the cheeses. but it'll still be a substantial side or a hearty homestyle veg dish.

Liberal doses of garlic throughout and some nutmeg and paprika for the roux made this a treat. To be sure, it is a lot of work, but tasty.

This recipe rocks!!! My family does not even like cauliflower and it was gone in 10 minutes! Used Panko like others have suggested and added 1/2 tsp of my favorite Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning to the cheese sauce. Wow, even with the fat free milk this tasted sinful! 4 fabulous forks to this one!

I am a fan of everything in the ingredient list, but both my husband and I thought this was not good. It's a lot of work, for very little taste. We won't be making it again.

Even if you don't care that much for cauliflower I think you still will love this recipe. It's almost like macaroni and cheese. Don't be put off by the horseradish, it's very mild. I think this recipe is a new favorite. Also for those on a low carb diet -- substitute with whole wheat crackers and you'll have a winner!

This recipe tasted like a basic potato cassarole. So, if you like that sort of thing, you may enjoy it. The horseradish flavor was mild and masked by the strong onion flavor from the scallions. It definately makes this healthy veggie unhealthy.

I have made this many times and it always gets rave reviews! Great left over the next day. I cook often and ALWAYS change recipes but not this one- good as is!!

This was really delicious. Two minor changes: subbed panko for the crackers, and baked this in individual gratins. Just mixed the cauliflower into the cheese pot and scooped it from there. One complaint: it uses a lot of dishes. Pan for the cauliflower, pan for the sauce, dish to bake it in... They call for another pan for melting the crumb butter, but I just did the crumbs before the sauce and used the same one. I had a little leftover cheese sauce and am thinking I might heat it up, add a little jalapeno and some beer and have it with tortilla chips.

Rating: 3
This was excellent! A definite comfort food. I added a handful of gruyere because I had it and used panko instead. It was super good - my husband said it was the best vegie dish he has had in a long time. My 5 year old had four helpings! Definite keeper.

This was great. I didn't use the cracker/horseradish topping, but added some broccoli to give the dish some color. Other than that followed the recipe exactly. Looked good, tasted fab. Will definitely make it again.

To die for! Most popular dish at my Thanksgiving. The key is to use good sharp cheddar, add cayenne pepper and dried mustard to cheese sauce to give it zip. I also used panko instead of bread crumbs.

I love this, and so does everyone I have served it to. I am not sure what about the saltines reminds anyone of Woman's Day magazine. I like the look of them in this particular recipe, although I do add a little more horseradish. Cooking at this high temperature has never made them soggy.

Have made this twice and both times it was a hit. However, can anyone tell me how to keep the cracker crust from tasting stale? I used fresh crackers but once I mixed them with the butter mixture they became too soggy.

A nice twist on an old standard. I didn't have horseradish, but I did have horseradish cheddar cheese (common here in upstate NY), which I used instead. It was a nice, milder alternative and I recommend it if you can find it.

Great. I also used panko crumbs. I substituted horseradish sauce for the horseradish with good results. The wife loved it.

Excellent flavors! Vegetable-suspicious family loved it. For a more impressive presentation, try steaming the whole, trimmed cauliflower head. Place in colorful bowl, (eliminating the gray-on-gray look), proceed with recipe. Cut into wedges at table. (Visions of serving this as printed made me think of a typical Women's Day "recipe": Sprinkle crushed saltines on cheesy Green Giant Boil in Bag for a fresh and exciting ......."

I quite liked it, though I made some adjustments to allow for food allergies and such in my house. So, here's my adjustment, and I'll surely try some other suggestions from previous reviewers the next time, like the addition of mustard (I'm sure this recipe is very good as is, too). Instead of milk in the sauce I used unsweetened soymilk, which worked great. For the cheese, I used yogurt cheese. To make up for the lack of sharpness in the cheese, I also added a bunch of paprika for color and a smoky kick (yum). I added two grated carrots (because I love grated carrot with cauliflower), and also threw in two chicken thighs, cubed and sauteed. With the addition of the chicken, it made a great one-dish dinner. Didn't have saltines (or horseradish for that matter) so I used large bread crumbs (similar to panko, which I'd have used if I'd had any in the house). So yes, I know, this isn't really totally the same as the original recipe, but basically I had this cauliflower staring at me from the fridge, and needed inspiration. I'll venture to say that the original is a tasty starting place that allows for easy improvisation, which is always a plus!

Not particularly inspired, but great comfort food-just what I needed. I made it w/only variation being no scallions (I was out) and panko crumbs. Very yummy and soothing.

So good! My cauliflower head was really small so I added some broccoli. Also, I used 1 percent milk, which works just fine and takes some of the guilt (and fat) away.

I made this exactly as directed. Other suggestions in this forum are right on the money, based on my experience, but I wanted to do it as directed the first time. More horseradish would be a big plus. The japanese bread crumbs would be a nice change as well. My family wanted more cheese.

I hear you, richfield! anyway, I made it twice: first as written, second time with more horseradish in the topping, as well as some cayenne and dijon mustard in the sauce. much preferred it the second time around, but it's a very forgiving and versatile recipe either way.

Rating: 3
I followed other reviewer's advice and used panko instead of saltines, added a teaspoon of dry mustard and ½ teaspoon Tabasco sauce to the sauce, omitted the green onions and added extra horseradish to the crumbs. When I started the sauce, I discovered we were out of milk so used the last ½ cup of heavy cream in the house and 1 cup chicken broth. My husband could not stop eating this! He wants me to maked it again soon. As the MAIN course! (No, he's not vegetarian).

Followed the recipe. (Drives me NUTS when people submit reviews for recipes they don't follow.) Very good taste. Will make again with more horseradish in the topping and a little hot sauce/cayenne kicker to the cheese sauce.

I thought this was pretty good, but the cheese sauce came out a little thinner than I would have liked. I also left out the horseradish (no one in my house likes it) and used buttered panko breadcrumbs in place of the saltines which was great. I'll make it again, but will use another cheese sauce recipe.

My first gratin, and it was SO delicious! It is so rich, I'll only make it for special occasions. Everyone loved it at our Christmas Eve dinner!! Next time, I'll add more horseradish to the crumbs, because I really couldn't tast it. I think this would be really good with crumbled cooked bacon mixed in.
