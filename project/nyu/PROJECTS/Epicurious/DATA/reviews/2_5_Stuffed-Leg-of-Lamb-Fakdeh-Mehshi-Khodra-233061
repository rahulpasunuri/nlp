Verjus or verjuce is used in Middle Eastern recipes specially in Islamic recipes in place of wine. Commonly, it is the juice of sour grapes. One hopes that the substitution of verjus for chicken broth (when there is already 1/4 cup of vinegar in the recipe) is a typo and not due to the author's lack of knowledge. Alternately, one can substitute verjus for the wine and vinegar and conform with any religious restrictions.

I very much enjoy middle eastern food and made this for Christmas Dinner. We each made it in about three bites and found the flavors to be unbearable. So we did not waste several pounds of meat, we literally shaved the leg of lamb and put the meat in spaghetti sauce to make a quick dinner. Whatever you do, alter the spice rub. Nothing should ever have this much all spice on it.

Recipe is cooked with wine?! Can not and should not be listed as a Ramadan Recipe... Observant Muslims will not eat or drink ANYTHING prepared with ALCOHOL - completely forbidden!!!

I would recommend approaching this dish with caution. I followed the recipe and found the flavor of the lamb to be kind of bitter and odd (and I normally love Middle Eastern and other more exotic foods). The red wine in the sauce did not go with the other flavors. The carrot stuffing was overcooked and mushy. I take my hat off to you if you want to be bold and try it, but I would strongly suggest doing so on your own once so you know what you are getting into before you try to make it for guests.

We cooked this recipe for a family get together along with some Lebanese chicken. It was wonderful! The lamb had a great flavor and texture. The spice combination was subtle but imparted itself throughout the meat while it slowly cooked. Our only problem was that the carrot/parsley/mint mixture was just too much to stuff into the lamb! We only could put about 1/3 of the mixture into the lamb when we stuffed it so we put all the leftover mixture on the outside of the lamb and cooked it that way. Aside from that, the recipe was great and the lamb went over wonderfully. So this is not only a good review from the chef, but also from my family!!

What a disaster! I made this for guests. The meet was mushy (not that wonderful leg of lamb texture) and tasteless. The onions turned bitter. The sauce did not complement anything and was weak and had little flavor. I can't even guess how to modify the recipe to make it work.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner for my family. It was outstanding: possibly the best lamb dish I have ever had to date. The only change I made was to use 15 cloves of garlic instead of 25 (the garlic we get here is huge, so I'm guessing it was approximately the same amount of garlic this recipe calls for.) The wine sauce was superb. The carrots in the stuffing were heavenly, the roasted onions tasted like some other kind of vegetable, simply wonderful. It was also as beautiful in presentation as it was tasty. A keeper. I'm surprised noone else has reviewed this recipe yet-- maybe it is just too good for words.
