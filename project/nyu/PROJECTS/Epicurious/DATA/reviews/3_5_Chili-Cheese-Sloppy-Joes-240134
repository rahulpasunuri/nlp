I was really looking forward to making this but I was so disappointed in it. It was pretty bland but it was a little better with all the cheese over the top.

Definitely needed way more tomatoes, so I added about a cup more. When paired with the sweet and sour slaw also on this site, it's a really great weeknight quickie.

I made this exactly as written. Sorry to be a dissenting opinion. There is not enough flavor. Only using chili powder does not give the dish enough flavor, very bland. Also, it really is chili- not a sloppy joe.

I've made this 3 times now and it's a great easy weeknight meal. Like others have said, it's not the world's most complex chili recipe, but it's still tasty! It's the cilantro that makes it special. So far I've always made the recipe exactly as is, except that my husband and I like ours on toasted Kaiser rolls instead of sourdough. Next time I'm going to try adding just a little bit of tomato paste to hold the meat together a little better.

Not only was this tasty, but calls for 4 forks because I haven't been to the grocery store in a week & 1/2 and was able to cobble this delicious dinner together for my family of 5. A few changes: used about 1/2 cup regular onion, 1 lb. ground beef, about 1 1/4 cup black beans (drained), half of which I smashed so the kids wouldn't notice/pick them out, about 1/4 cup of butternut squash puree to add extra vege content, and a little more than a cup of diced tomatoes, undrained. Used the amt of chili powder called for in the recipe even though I doubled some other things; mixed it with a little water first so it would mix into the beef easier. Oh, and I cooked some bacon at the beginning, drained & discarded the grease, then stirred the bacon back in at the end. Not for those looking for the low-fat version, but it really tasted good. Served w/ broken up taco shells on top as someone else suggested. Served w/ whole wheat bread instead of sourdough and sauteed spinach and glazed carrots on the side. I was pretty excited to make such a good meal with the dregs of what I had left in the fridge/freezer.

A very nice recipe, I found it was high in fat, Because of health issues I found either extra lean beef or for a change you could use ground turkey ( I suggest you may want to add a little extra spices to over come the lack of flavours in the turkey meat) My family loved this dish!

This was fast,easy & filling! There were too many beans this recipe called for in my opinion.

Yes, there are better chili recipes but few are this quick and easy. We thought it was good but lacked kick -- will make with more spices next time.

I thought this was really tasty. I added more diced tomatoes (about 1 full cup)and kosher salt instead of regular. I didn't have the cilantro on hand, but I don't think it needs it. I put it over garlic bread made with kaiser rolls- delicious!

I give this recipe 4 forks because it is so easy and tastes great. Will make again for sure!

Why would you drain the tomatoes and not drain the beans? I'm doing it the other way around, will report back.

We enjoyed this thoroughly. I added more onions, fresh tomatoes and some parsley and it was great! Next time, I will add even more fresh tomatoes and perhaps some chili peppers

Excellent chili -- I don't eat red meat, so I used ground chicken, which saves in calories AND was very tasty. The only other change I made was to use the entire can of tomatoes. In addition to the cheese and onions, I served it with a dollop of fat free sour cream and crushed taco shells. Very nice and flavorful.

contrary to fellow reviewer from cape cod my family and i were not disappointed! granted it was not the best chili ever, but it was ready in 30 minutes, with minimal clean up and it actually very good. instead of chili powder i used chili-con-carne mix from penzeys. will make again for sure! 3.5 forks.

My family loved this recipe and leftovers were even better. Perfect for a Friday night after work easy meal.

This disappointed me. There are many excellent chili recipes out there. They may take longer to cook but very little more in the way of prep time.

I shocked my husband when I told him I was making sloppy joes. His memory of sloppy joes from his childhood was not a good one. I made it because it was a quick recipe. To our surprise, it was not only quick, it was particularly delicious.
