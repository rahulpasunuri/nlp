I made this last night for my husband and a guest. They said they liked it, I was a bit disappointed. I didn't do the chive oil maybe that was what was missing, I just drizzled extra virgin olive oil over it. I will make again. And do it to the recipe although I like the sound of the muffin for a weekday meal.

Had this for dinner. Served it with some nice crusty bread and red wine and it was awesome! You can also grill the asparagus on the bbq. Instead of salt used "Cajun" seasoning - you can get it any any grocery store - delicious on the asparagus and in the oil. Great meal!

I found this recipe to be good but not special. A few other notes. The roasting time for the asparagus is much too long. Also, I am surprised the recipe does not suggest draining the eggs on paper towels. Even with using a slotted spoon, there is excess water.

Served on top of a split English muffin, this is a lovely variation on Eggs Benedict - without the worry of making the Hollandaise. I poached the eggs in an egg poacher for 3 minutes.

One of the best way to serve asparagus! I didn't have time to make poached eggs so i just fried them but didn't turn them over.All flavors blended real well and my hubby just loved it! Light yet filling! :)

I made this dish for my wife and a couple of friends and was amazed at the simplicity of this menu. The wonderful array of tastesk, from the salt of the prosciutto to the mellowness of the chive oil, were amazing. This was a breeze to make and really impressed our friends.

Served this atop a piece of toasted herb focacia bread as a weeknight supper, and it was tasty. The asparagus was done is about 7 minutes total cooking time--12 would have been way too long.

This recipe seems quite plain but it really tastes magnificent. I've found you don't have to go to all the trouble of poaching the eggs. Simply a quick and careful frying which keeps the yolk liquid serves the same outcome and takes a fraction of the time. I've made this with and without the chive sauce and while it was great both times, the chive sauce really added a lot to it. It contrasts wonderfully with the salt of the prosciutto

3 1/2 stars, actually. Tried this with some lovely spring asparagus for Easter. On its own, I thought the chive oil wasn't very good, but atop the salad the flavors really sang. The salty prosciutto and the earthy asparagus really harmonized here. And what a lovely presentation. I'll be serving this to guests all Spring.

Made this for Easter brunch; so quick & easy, and delicious. Didn't do anything ahead of time. Will definitely make this in the future because it's so easy and yet impressive. (Cooked the eggs probably twice as long because I don't like runny yolks.)

I was intimidated by this recipe because I'd tried poaching eggs years ago and it was a complete flop. I tried this for easter and it went great! Put the asparagus in first and let it stay in a warm oven if it finishes before you're done with the eggs. the chive oil was also delicious - I added a little basil and it was great. YUMMMMMM!

I actually served this for supper with the Cornbread Muffins. Very tasty.
