This recipe is amazing. Toasting the coconut is absolutely essential, as others have noted. I leave out the chocolate chips (I'm not a chocolate fan) and substitute 1 cup roughly chopped pecans....yummm. Worth trying as a variation even if you like them with the chocolate.

this is a serious crowd pleaser, they are much adored among my friends. so sweet that they are very addictive, i might use a bit less sugar next time around. the coconut adds a very special touch

Fantastic! I made this with unsweetened flaked coconut and, based on previous reviews, only 1 cup of chocolate chips. It was perfect. For such a short ingredient list and easy prep, this is pure magic. I'll be making this often!

i made these vegan by simply using nondairy margarine (earth balance) in place of butter and ener-g egg replacer in lieu of eggs. they were easy and scarfed enthusiastically by my friends. :)

One last comment on these and any other sweet baking you do. Use the best vanilla you can afford. It makes a huge difference. I found some at walmart that was the same price as the most popular U.S. brand (i won't name but starts MC), that was much higher quality. Also, never use immitation vanilla if you don't have to!

WOW, WOW, WOW! These are like pro bakery blondies. Some things I have learned after making mistakes over the years that may help.... you MUST use unsalted butter, nothing else. The butter and eggs should be room temperature (leave out for like 5 hours). Make sure you are beating the butter and sugar until fluffy and absolutely do not overwork the flour when you add it, mix it only until incorporated and then fold in the coconut and chips. By the way, I definitely recommend toasting the coconut, it really brings out the flavor. I used milk chocolate chips because that's what I like. Hope these hints are helpful. Enjoy these amazing blondies!

I wouldn't make these again. They didn't turn out at all as I expected. They were way too cakey.

Followed recipe exactly, except (!), used whole wheat flour and dark brown sugar and baked in an 8x11" pan. YUM!!! And couldn't be easier (-:

These were a hit, but to me they were soft and gooey, not quite what I wanted for a ladies' tea- but delicious. Next time I'd use unsweetened coconut (def. toast it!) and less chocolate chips. This is an easy, go-to recipe, though!

Rating: 4
These are so good. Make sure that you toast the coconut. It does make a difference. Also, I used unsweetened and just 1 cup of the chips. They turned out great. I baked them in a 9x9 square pan, took a little longer to bake but they are thicker and so moist.

I omitted the chocolate chunks and put pecans in, instead. I was worried that they would be too dry, so I added two tablespoons of corn oil to the batter. I also used rum extract instead of vanilla, so they taste like butterscotch. They came out gooey and crispy, which is a very nice texture, and they have a very nice flavor to them.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but found the result disappointingly dry, even with a shorter cooking time.

Excellent. Never thought I'd say this, but it is too much chocolate --- changes the texture. Second time I cut down the choc and was perfect --- well received.

These are outstanding and very quick and easy to make. I skip the step of toasting the coconut, and they still turn out great. Every time I make these, they are big hit.

These are wonderful! I used unsweetened coconut and I`m glad I did. We find that most desserts using sweetened coconut are just too sweet. These turned out just right!

I was a little worried about the "double-acting baking powder" since I just had garden-variety BP, so I put two tsp in and crossed my fingers. These were wonderful! I only had about 1 cup of chocolate chips but it was enough. We had these for dessert with some chocolate-coconut coffee, and it was fantastic. My husband was so excited that there was still most of a 9x13 pan left over! I will be making these often.

I just made these and they were very easy and very fast. After skimming the reviews, I decided to cut the brown sugar to 1 cup and decrease the chocolate chips to about .5 cup. I also substituted .5 cup of the flour for oatmeal that I pulverized in my food processor. This gave a bit more texture. Since I was using sweetened coconut, I felt that the bars were plenty sweet. People at work were gobbling them up! Not many were left after leaving them unattended! Will make again because it's easy and I have the ingredients on hand.

Made these over the weekend for a ladies night and no one could stop eating them. Used dark brown sugar because it was what I had on hand. They were perfectly moist and absolutely delish! Will definitely make again.

I too made only half the recipe and baked it in an 11x7- inch pan. Did not overdo the choc chips and added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. Came out very good if a bit dry. You can basically throw anything in there -- use the cookie dough as a base for whatever you mix into it, but the coconut is divine and should be left in no matter what!

Outstanding recipe. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using mini morsels. Toasted coconut adds nice flavor.

This recipe is awesome! As other reviewers said, I found it a little sweet but my 13 yr old daughter and her friends loved it. Next time, I'll cut back on the choc chips if I'm making it for adults. Definitely toast the coconut. These were plenty moist even with the toasted coconut.

Made these in a hurry for a party and therefore didn't have time to toast the coconut. I also substituted 1.5 cups crushed Heath bar for the chips just because I had them around. The result was incredibly moist and delicious! Raves all around.

Delicious, easy.....make as is, don't skip toasting the cocount.

I really like this bar recipe. I use unsweetened toasted coconut and toasted chopped nuts (pecans or walnuts). The trick I have found is to always whipped up the butter and sugar as fluffy as possible. I actually always use my food processor and my baking gets raves. I live in a warm climate so if the batter becomes too soft I put it in the refrigerator for a minutes. If there are too many chocolate chips you can always reduce to about a cup, but I think the chocolate and coconut are a great combination. Just be sure to not overcook. Enjoy!

Rating: 2
I agree that the chocolate chips overpowered the coconut. It could've also been b/c I used unsweetened coconut instead of sweetened. I threw in 1/2 cup walnuts as another reviewer suggested and probably would increase it to 1 cup next time. Despite this, they were still gobbled up at a recent July 4th party within less than an hour!

Rating: 4
These were delectable!!! I read all the reviews, and took the advice of those who said that NOT browning the coconut made for a more moist bar cookie, and I also left out the chocolate chips as some suggested so that it wouldn't detract from that luscious coconut flavor. I further added about 1/2 cup of finely chopped walnuts to enhance texture and flavor. They were a "WOW, isn't this yummy!" kind of recipe! They really had a texture similar to brownies. They turn a darker color while baking than I expected (the word "blondies" in the title made me think they would be light colored) but they were just great! Super moist, not overly sweet, and just perfect! They baked in a 9 x 12 pan for 30 minutes.

Rating: 3
Theses blondies are very rich and delicious, however I would remove the chocolate chips from this recipe as it is more like a very rich chocolate chip bar with coconut. I did toast the coconut and next time will not. Just want to see what I like better! My husband ( sous-chef) thinks butterscotch chips might also be tasty.

YUM! An entire pan gone in less than 48 hours and my husband and kids don't even like coconut! This is so simple and absolutely delicious. Very moist and buttery. Ran out of brown sugar so I used 1/2 cup of that and 1 cup granulated sugar with great results. I'll definitely be making these again and again.

Amazing!! These brownies remind me of NYC's Magnolia's Bakery Hello Dolly Bars - without being so dense and filling. I am adding this recipe to my greatest hits. Happy Baking!

Spectacular! This was my first baking experience but I had no trouble at all - the recipe is so simple. And it came out fantastic! Based on previous comments, I did not toast the coconut, and I think it added to the moistness and softness of the blondies. They did not crumble at all. I substituted peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips and the combination was delicious. Could also be the reason why this wasn't at all too sweet as others mentioned.

I found this recipe in the 1992 Gourmet. Since then it has been passed down to my daughter and she makes it more often than I do. Everyone looks forward to it at holiday time. I find it a little sweet, my youngest son doesn't like coconut at all (I have to check to see if he was switched at the hospital) but all in all everyone else who is upset about the blondies is because of the weight they've gained since tasting them for the first time.

Had high expectations, but these fell short. They seemed kind of greasy or lacking in texture. Will look for another recipe that's more like the 'congo bars' I remember from childhood.

Rating: 2
Although this bar cookies is very simple to make, it doesn't produce anything extraordinary. If you want a basic cookie recipe, then this is adequate, but it cuts quite poorly and produces a crumbly bar.

I love coconut, so this one was a no-brainer. YUM. Buttery, chewy, toasted-coconut-y. I did make a few changes. I omitted the chocolate and substituted coarsely chopped pecans (why dilute the coconut flavor with chocolate? Those of you who found these too sweet - try the nuts instead of the chocolate). I also halved the recipe and made in a 7x11 inch pan and monitored the baking time closely, they took about 25 minutes total. I halved it because my husband and I didn't need a whole pan of these in the house ;-) They were fabulous. I'm glad the halving worked out - it doesn't always with baked goods. I'll probably make another half-batch for my mom for mother's day - this time with macadamias instead of pecans.

Rating: 3
Quick and Easy to make. I was out of brown sugar - white worked just fine. I was surprised at how sticky the batter was and would recommend a greased spatula to move it from your mixing bowl to the 9X13 pan. Very buttery and delicious, especially if you like macaroons.

I made these for the first time and, as suggested below, did not toast the coconut. YUMMEEEE! I am obsessed with coconut! I did find them a little too sweet, however, and think that next time I will decrease the chocolate chips to 1 cup.

These sound great and I will make them when I have a chance as I adore coconut. In the meantime, a tip...toast your coconut in the microwave the same way you do nuts. Put them in a small bowl, use high power, and stir every 30-45 seconds until brown. Dump out onto a plate and cool

I am reviewing this recipe a second time because I still make them regularly and I have changed how I make them...I don't toast the coconut anymore! I was afraid to try that since one reviewer said they were too stringy that way, however once when pressed for time I skipped the toasting, and discovered that the result was fabulous! Not that they were ever dry, but they are way more moist this way and so much easier/quicker to prepare. I am asked for the recipe over and over when I make them. Make them and enjoy!

Loved my first batch - decided to save time on the next batch and NOT toast the coconut. It made a big difference, and we did not like the "stringy" feeling when the coconut isn't toasted. One small change is that we prefer white chocolate chips over chocolate chips.

I love coconut, so this recipe was not a hard sell. I was a little suspicious about how they would come out based on the drop-cookie-like consistancy of the batter, but they were moist and delicious. Even better the next day, I think. About toasting the coconut: Spread it evenly on a large cookie sheet with an edge, bake at 325 for 10 minutes, stirring and redistributing evenly a few times during the baking process. Watched closely, your coconut shouldn't burn.

The dough is better than the cookies. The dough is delicious! The cookies were a little dry. I'd still prefer plain chocolate chip cookies over these bars.

Be patient when you're toasting the coconut -- it takes a while! I used unsweetened flaked coconut from Trader Joe's, but these brownies were still way too sweet... because of the chocolate. Next time, I will reduce the chocolate and use bittersweet instead of semisweet.

I really liked this recipe. I had never toasted coconut before and found that it took longer than mentioned in the instructions that I received, but that was ok, I just had to watch it so it didn't burn. The next time I make these bars, I am going to add a few nuts to the recipe. My family likes nuts in their desserts. If it isn't as good, I will just leave them out on later batches. These were the best!

Nice taste of coconut and chocolate. You better love coconut. I cooked mine for about 1 hour but used a 9-inch pan instead. I like my brownies high, not flat. Very chewy tasting. The second time I made them I forgot to toast the coconut (oops) but I liked it better!

I'd describe these as a cross between blondies and magic seven layer bars. They are delicious and easy to make with ingredients you usually have on hand. I used salted butter with no problem. You may be able to tone down the sweetness by adding walnuts to the batter.

One of my favorites! The consistency is quite appealing to the palate. Chewarific! I couldn't stop eating and baking more! Caution to those of you allergic to coconut (as the name implies).

I followed the recipe perfectly and the results were perfect. Well, it did take longer to toast the coconut, but the baking time was perfect. This dessert is VERY sweet. I wish that it was not. You need an entire glass of milk in order to enjoy just a little square. I would adjust the sweetness, but I do not know how!

The first time I made these they were great but a bit dry. The next time I doubled the recipe but used the same sized pan and they were amazingly sinful--gooey and chocolately. Served warm with ice cream, they are an excellent dessert.

These are a bit on the sweet side but very good. I make them every year for a camping trip and everyone loves them.
