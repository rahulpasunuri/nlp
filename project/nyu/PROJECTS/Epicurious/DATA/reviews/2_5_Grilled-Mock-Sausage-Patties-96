I have been making this [or something much like it] for years, and have yet to call it "mock sausage". Please tell us why this is mock, instead or real?

This is fine. But why is it "mock"????? I thought sausage WAS flavored ground pork, no?

This would be a wonderful accompaniment to pancakes or french toast for breakfast. The flavor was subtle and it was much less greasy than sausage and more flavorful and better textured than chicken or turkey sausage.
