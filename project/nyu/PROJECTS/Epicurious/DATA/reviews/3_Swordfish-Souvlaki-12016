I liked the idea of this dish better than the actual product. The swordfish was really bland -- it needs more marinating/spices to really be a winner.

I think this recipe is great. I've already made it twice. I know not everyone has access to it, but if you can get it use Greek yogurt instead of commercial American yogurt. No draining required and to me the quality is superior. I used frozen swordfish steaks which I found kept the cost down and didn't affect the quality of the final dish much at all (since you're slathering it with tzatziki and onions anyway). This one is in regular rotation now at our house.

This was ok, but not great, very messy to eat, and my son wouldn't touch it. I used dill in my cucumber sauce as well. I drained the yogurt and cucumbers for 3 hours too, although I chopped the cucumber, misreading that it said to finely grate, but it tasted the same. The swordfish was excellent, which I grilled. It was a nice change of pace for a weeknight dinner in December!

I loved this recipe! I used shark instead of swordfish (they were out of swordfish but this ended up being very economical) and it stayed very moist and flavorful. I drained my yogurt and cucumber for 2 hours in cheesecloth and used dill instead of mint. If you drain your yogurt and cucumber the night before or earlier in the day, this is a great super-quick weekday meal!

The only things that made it 3 instead of 4 was the price of the ingredients, but I have made this at least 5 times in the last 6 months, very tasty, even if you don't have a grill

This was okay, not excellent, but good. More like 21/2 forks. We won't make it again, but we enjoyed it. The swordfish was excellent, but the yogurt sauce definitely needed to be drained!

A delicious way to use swordfish! I skewered mine with cherry tomatoes for added flavour. Also, draining the yogurt first with cheesecloth (or I use a clean teacloth) makes for a sauce more like tzatziki!
