This is a fantastic recipe that I often serve for a large dinner party. It can be festive or casual, works both ways. It's impossible to resist the smell of the sauce while cooking, beware! The phyllo was not hard to work with, as I feared. It takes time, but it's a delicious dish that my guests request when invited in the fall/winter (too hot in summer to make it).
