I wasn't crazy about these potatoes. Too much cheese, and the texture was too gluey. There are much better cheese potato recipes out there.

The potatoes are very tasty, but I would cut back the cheese by at least 1/3. The downside of this dish is you want to keep it warm even when serving. As soon as the potatoes start to cool the cheese begins to crumble.

Excelent, so good I am making them again tonight! Just don't overcook the potatoes, or it may come out too thin.
