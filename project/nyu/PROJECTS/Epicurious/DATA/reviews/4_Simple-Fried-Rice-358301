This recipe was very good, but it definitely needs all of the soy sauce and the sesame oil as other reviewers suggested. We added hoisin at the end as someone suggested. I also think adding cilantro at the end would make it even better. We used shrimp, broccoli, red peppers, and peas (frozen).

Delicious, but yes, it does need lots of oil to be delicious. Saving 4 star reviews for things that are delicious but perhaps a bit less caloric. 6 ounces of veggies isn't enough; you need at least twice that, and chop them smaller than bite size, say, 1/2" dice. It really brightens the dish up. (I used broccoli, celery, bell peppers, and threw in some frozen peas at the last moment. Any veggies would be great.)

Made it for everyone and they loved it. Rice always takes awhile but all in all a great recipe.

I love fried rice, but like many others here, this was my first attempt at making it. I substituted half the amount of soy sauce with fish sauce, which gave it something special. Also, in place of meat, I used mushrooms. It came out great.

Meh. That's it...just, meh. I kind of feel like I could have saved all the calories of the last three tablespoons of oil and just dumped the soy sauce and veg together without frying, because that step didn't seem to add any flavor. And that was with the suggestions of added sesame oil and some red pepper flakes.

Like other reviewers, I used 2 Tblsp Sesame Oil along with 2 Tblsp vegetable oil. Don't think it would taste nearly as good without the sesame oil, so it is worth the investment. I thought this was a delicious way to use leftovers. My particular iteration included asparagus, pork tenderloin, a red onion and red bell pepper. Tasty and pleasing to the eye as well.

I followed this technique but didn't really measure anything. Easy to make lots of substitutions, which you are meant to do, given that it's a way to use up leftovers. The technique is perfect! I'm not giving it a rating because I did use a mix of sesame and vegetable oil instead of plain veg. oil, and I may have found it too bland otherwise, but not sure.

I love this recipe and I get to use any odds and ends I have in the vegetable drawer at weeks end. This is a much better place for them to end up than in the compost bin. The variations are endless and it is a great dish to bring for lunch too. Love this recipe!

Great recipe! Our rice turned out better than our local Asian restaurants. We used broccoli, julienned and cubed carrots (they were different colors so it was fun to use different shapes), and peas. We also used peanut oil because we love the flavor. It was absolutely delicious!

I've never made fried rice before and I was a little daunted. This recipe was easy and foolproof! A few small notes: a 12 in skillet is good but a wok would undoubtedly be better as I kept wishing for higher sides the whole time. Also when cutting up the veggies I diced mine the second time I made it and it was better than bite sized. They cooked quicker and you get a better and more even distribution throughout the rice!

Really nice recipe, easy to adapt. I added minced fresh ginger with the garlic. At the end I added 1T sesame oil and 1T sriracha. Will definitely use this as my "master" recipe.

Its a great recipe!my son gave me an A+.i used the suggestions that other reviewers gave, like jasmine rice,more ginger and the peanut oil, this helped a lot.

This was not very tasty. I would make it again but I would add hot sauce and ginger for sure.

Simple and basic -- a great start for experimenters. (Unlike most fried rice recipes, this one gets the cooking methods right.) Shrimp is a great addition; just make sure they're small. And ginger is essential!

I made this with jasmine rice, ham and bok choy. I added a little bit of grated ginger, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. My husband and children all loved it!

I make this recipe every time I have a few veggies to use up. When I make rice I double the recipe so that I have enough for this dish. I use low sodium soy sauce and brown rice. Sometimes I splurge on a few snow peas. Excellent and easy.

This is a great recipe! I took out the leftover rice but decided I needed something different so I went looking on my favorite Recipe search and came across this. Carrots, bell pepper, broccoli and celery were the veggie base. I was afraid it would be too salty with 4 TB of soy - so I used teriyaki sauce and chicken broth. I will use soy next time because it needed a bit more zing to it. The results surprised both myself and DH! Thank You Epicurious!!

This was excellent. I made this with some eggs, a few slices off some cooked chicken and I added a little pinch of sugar and pepper in the end. I used green bell peppers, snow peas and little bits of carrot to it, and added some white vinegar to thin out the soy sauce, about a teaspoon of it. The result was exceptional and it was definitely delicious

Great recipe! I doubled it for a potluck and it was very well received. I added some ginger and sesame oil, but other than that followed the recipe using tofu, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms and baby spinach.

I gave this recipe 4 starts based upon its being a wonderful base recipe. I've used this numerous times, each time changing it up - sometimes a little, and sometimes a lot. My favorite leftover rice to use is coconut jasmine rice, but I've also had great results with leftover Basmati and regular old long grain white rice. Meat is rarely eaten in our house (and when it is, there are hardly ever any leftovers), so frozen uncooked shrimp are my protein of choice, along with a mixture of frozen and fresh vegetables - any and all seem to work ok here. I also like to add a bit of bottled hoison sauce, some chopped ginger, and sesame oil (the hot one adds just the right amount of heat). It's a very forgiving dish that allows for lots of creativity (and emptying of the fridge).

This was soooooo easy. I had a lot of brown rice left over from another recipe. This was a great way to use it up. The brown rice gave it a nutty texture. I used frozen peas, snow peas, carrot and broccoli. Using low sodium soy sauce,it needed more than the 4 tblspns specified in the recipe.

Wonderful Fried Rice - I was seeking a quick and easy recipe and this was it! I made one with left over filet, broccoli and carrots and one with tofu, frozen mixed veggies, mushrooms, and spinach. Both were very good. i did make a note to try it with a little sesame oil next time. Both my partner and my daughter loved the dish!!

Very good. Easy to make and it turned out just as I hoped it would. Used left over roast chicken. I added hot chili sauce to my serving. Will make again.

OM this was really good. I added tofu to my chicken to stretch it out along with the previous reviewer's suggestion of sesame oil but other than that I followed the recipe only doubled it. My kids loved it. Cheap yet delicious meal.

This gets 4 forks for being so tasty and fast to make. I made it vegetarian and substituted 1 Tbs of the vegetable oil with sesame oil when stir-frying the rice. Will definitely make again. Quick tip if you don't have cooked rice handy: use frozen organic brown rice from Trader Joe's; it takes only 3 minutes in the microwave to heat up!
