This was amazing! It received rave reviews. I know one person who I gave the recipe to that has since claimed sole credit for this recipe on at least 2 continents! The trick is to let it sit an ample amount of time in the refrigerator. I made mine the day before.

I made this in a low fat version for Thanksgiving dessert and it was a big hit. The filling is less sweet than similar dishes but we like it like that. I think the cranberry glaze did not need the gelatin. I was nervous about the filling setting up with the reduced fat so I added an additional teaspoon of gelatin to it and it worked just fine, I used low fat cream cheese and low fat sour cream. I used only one cup of heavy cream and substituted two cups of fat free half and half for the rest of the cream. With the reduced cream, it won't whip into peaks but it did thicken and work out in the end. It was delicate and light and very elegant. I used a vanilla bean that we brought back from a trip to Tahiti, and the essence of vanilla was strong. I would say not to skimp on the bean.

I've been meaning to rate this since last Thanksgiving. I was teribbly disappointed. It did not set up properly and was almost runny. The filling was "blah". Some other reviewers used more gelatin, added more flavoring, or used it as a parfait, and I think that would be fine. Needs a lot of "doctoring".

A special dessert that uses a classic autumn flavor in an elegant way. Due to the low amount of cream cheese, don't expect a classic cheesecake flavor. I made mine as small tarts. The filling benefits from a bit of minced lemon peel, extra vanilla, and a bit of extra sugar. Yes, the filling is light in flavor, but this is necessary. Otherwise it would compete with the strongly-flavored cranberries. A lovely dessert!

After reading the reviews, I decided to make this into a parfait. I substituted the sour cream with melted white chocolate. The port cranberry sauce (sans gelatin) was delicious. I layered it in champagne glasses and it was well received by all.

First of all, because all my belongings are in storage I did not have my springform pan with me. So, I bought a ready made pie crust which I have never done before. The crust of anything you make is at least one third of the taste and success. As for the filling I also did not have my beater with the whipping attachments but I used an old electric hand beater. It took a really, really long time for the sour cream, heavy cream and sugar mixture to thicken - I did not get really big peaks but after ten minutes of beating I stopped - it was thick. Now, as for the gelatin I don't know why they always give measurements in teaspoons or tablespoons in recipes when these damned gelatins come in envelopes with no translation to tsp or tbs. Oh well, I used the entire envelope and thank god it came out nice and thick - possibly because there was an additional one third tsp of gelatin - they told me an envelope is approximately two tsps. So, I poured the mixture into the ready made pie crust (will never use that again - really bad) and the crust should be nice and thick - the filling was great, nice and light and fluffy but I found it rather bland - I will experiment the next time. Now, there was a lot more filling left for me because I did not use a sprinform pan. So, I put the left over filling, which was a lot into a bowl. It too firmed up really nice, like a thick mousse. So, everyone, the filling you can use in separate glasses as a parfait, or use as a trifle of sorts and as for the topping there are a million possibilities. I did not try the cranberry topping - I just used what I had which was fresh strawberries. All in all I would make it again but certainly with my own thick crust and the filling would be much more flavorab le. Other than that it is really easy and can be a fabulous dessert.

This is my second review of this recipe. I loved it the first, second, and third times I made it, as written. I'm not sure why some people said it didn't set up--it has for me, every time. Anyway, recently I got creative with it--I wanted to make it for a friend's small wedding but her husband doesn't like cranberries, so I used the cheesecake recipe with an Oreo crumb crust (in a heart-shaped springform pan). Then I made a raspberry sauce (a package of frozen raspberries, thawed, thrown in a blender, strained, and sugar added until it's sweet enough). After unmolding the tart, I put the raspberry sauce on the top, then topped the whole thing with white and dark chocolate curls, all over. Served it with extra raspberry sauce. Oh, my, it was good. I'm not sure which way I like it better now.

My first attempt at cheesecake and I was very impressed as were my guests. A little time consuming but worth it. The filling is so light and the port glaze was a hit. I couldn't find anise but it was great without. Enjoy!

This was DISGUSTING! The cake part didn't set up - at all! We actually used spoons to serve this into bowls. The filling just tasted like whipped cream, totally blah. As for the topping, it was too little too late. Why can't I give No Forks for this?

I'm not sure what other reviewers did to the cheesecake but it was fabulous, extremely rich and creamy and not very mousse-like, actually. Look at the ingredients! I added 2 extra tablespoons of sugar, as recommended and it was plenty sweet. I made it in a ceramic tart pan, which worked fine. The sauce was good but you must like anise to like it!

My husband says it's good enough to sell. Three minor changes: added 2 additional tbsps sugar to the cake (it didn't seem sweet enough), cut sugar to 1/2 cup for the sauce (still plenty sweet), and didn't use gelatin in sauce. A real holiday treat and not time consuming. I had no problem with it setting and staying firm.

Awesome recipe! It tasted like the finest dessert from the finest restaurant. I was quite proud of it.

I made this for a small dinner party and everyone loved it. Very easy to make and much lighter than regualar cheesecake.

I served this dish at a dinner party, and while some folks liked it, it didn't really "wow" the rest of us. The one guest who doesn't like anything sweet LOVED it. The filling is not sweet at all, and everyone thought that it would be improved with more sugar. That, of course, is individual preference--I apparently had a table full of folks wanting something sweet after a spicy Mexican-themed dinner. The sauce is what saved the dessert in my opinion. It was wonderful and added significant flavor and sweetness to this dessert. I'll definitely make the sauce again, and may make the dessert again, but will experiment with increased sugar. The dessert didn't firm up as much as I'd hoped; after 10 hours in a COLD refrigerator, it was still only moderately firm. The slices lost their shaped and kind of oozed all over the plate, especially after being topped with the cranberry port sauce. Next time, I'd use more gelatin and/or explain that this dessert is more akin to a mousse (as described) than it is to traditional "cheesecake" so folks aren't expecting a firmer, sweeter dessert.

This was a fantastic CHEESECAKE. Very light...excellent served after a big dinner. I have made it twice since Thanksgiving...recipe has been requested to all that it was served. I also used homemade blackberry syrup as one of the toppings. Delicious. Will definitely make it again.

very light, ethereal cheesecake filling. Use the best vanilla beans-they contribute much to the recipe. The filling is almost bavarian cream-like. It's great with the spiced port cranberries, but I also think it would be nice with caramelized apples. It's so light that it works as a Thanksgiving dessert. I also made it ahead on Tuesday for Thursday and it was perfect

Oh, my...I rarely give 4 forks but this recipe deserves it. I'm not a big fan of dense cheesecake and maybe that's why I liked this so much. The filling is so rich and creamy but light at the same time. Awesome. And the glaze is inspired. Don't leave out the star anise or the cloves--they are what makes the dish. At the recommendation of a previous reviewer I left out the gelatin step in the glaze and got the effect on the photograph. I don't think you need the gelatin. I'll be making this one again.

I just didn't like it - the cranberries in port glaze were very, very good the filling I found lacking.

This was a really easy dish to make. I used light sour cream and cream cheese to reduce fat, and also a store bought crust to save on time. I served it at Thanksgiving and got rave reviews! The topping is what really makes it. Instead of anise, I used a dash of nutmeg and it turned out really good! I'll definitely make this again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a little time consuming but the result was great. A VERY light tasting filling but does have the calories. I used reduced fat cream cheese and fat-free sour cream. I thought the crust was a little on the sweet side. Next time I may reduce the sugar in the crust and add a 7th tablespoon of butter because it was a little too crummy too press easily. The cranberry sauce was too thick and did not look like the photo. The gelatin step could be eliminated?? It will impress guests.

Not too sweet, not too tart. The cheesecake was very light. Not a heavy dessert. The sauce does make the recipe.

The cranberry-port glaze is what makes this dish. It is FANTASTIC. It is not too sweet and not too tart and it has an elegant yet comforting flavor. It is beautiful and a perfect holiday dessert. The tart has a mousse-like texture, much airier than a baked cheesecake. All our dinner guests loved it! I made it as suggested and wouldn't change a thing.
