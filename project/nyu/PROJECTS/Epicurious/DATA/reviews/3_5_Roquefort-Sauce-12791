Love, love, love. Made this with Bel Gioioso crumbled Gorgonzola and it was fantastic over porterhouse steaks for New Year's Eve. Definitely rich but worth it for a holiday treat. The shallots add a nice dimension. Using the left overs on bread with left over steak for lunch but I keep eating it right from the container with a spoon!

An excellent compliment to beef dishes. A light spread over prime rib accentuated the entire meal. If the Roquefort is too strong, I suggest using a Stilton.

My family enjoyed the sauce on New York steaks. My son thought it was too salty and I hadn't added salt, only a small amount of freshly ground pepper. It was a very nice addition to our meal.

I admit I didn't follow the rec exactly; I subbed some Danish blue for the Roquefort and measured out the ingredients by eye/experience. Having said that, it came out too thick for my taste so I added a little more milk to thin. I thought it was too strong... but then again we're talking blue cheese here (which I like but don't love) and not mozzarella. I served it with cubed turkey breast; I lightly browned the cubes and then simmered in a little stock. When the stock was cooked off, I removed the meat from the pan and melted some butter with lots of tabasco and then threw the cubes back in to coat. The sauce was a nice complement for the tabasco. Leftover sauce went on broiled burgers the next day and that was good, too. Next time I make this, I'll splurge and use Roquefort (but I'll halve the amount called for). If you really like blue cheese or Roquefort, you'll like this sauce.

I paired this with filet mignon and every body loved it. We made sandwiches with the sauce and left over steak the next day. Delicious and easy!
