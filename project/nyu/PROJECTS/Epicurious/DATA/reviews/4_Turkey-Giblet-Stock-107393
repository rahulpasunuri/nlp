Made this tonight with roasted turkey wings instead of giblets. M-M good! So easy too. Doubled the amount so I'll have enough for 2 types of dressing and gravy.

Nice stock recipe. I've only used it in the gravy for the related turkey (plum glaze etc), and the gravy I make is spectacular. If you own a chinois, getting the stock restaurant smooth is simple.

I have never browned the neck and gizzards nor veggies. I look forward to trying your recipe. It will add much flavor to the gravy.
