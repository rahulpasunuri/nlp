Making this(again)tonight for flu ridden S/O.... it is, without question a keeper. I used Grandma's Fresh Frozen egg noodles (available in the frozen food section in most grocery stores) I also agree with with the other reviewer who said the lemon in the mushrooms enhances the soup...WONDERFUL

You want to cook chicken longer than 20 min. Veggies - too. I would add 4 more cups of water (broth) to make more bullion. Overall - my bf loved it.

This is an exceptional chicken noodle soup. The lemon definitely kicks it up a notch. Though I love it as is, I might try Thai-izing it a bit by adding some fish sauce, ginger and lemongrass...voila "Chicknoosou".

This recipe is so, so delicious and easy and comforting. And it is SO much better than anything you'll find in a can! When I first made this I doubled the veggies, thinking there would't be enough in the soup, but I ended up having to add more water to the soup because there wasn't enough liquid! Fooled me, the recipe is perfect just as it is. I added a few things, like some sprigs of fresh thyme and about a tablespoon of minced garlic to the mushrooms while they sauteed. I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes, because I like a little bit of kick in my soup. I also used boneless chicken thighs because that was all I had, and it was delicious! Great recipe as is, but also fun to add a few other touches as you like, depending on your favorite herbs and flavors. Yum!

My husband was sick and I've been craving American comfort foods. This chicken soup tasted like some thing from a store back home but better. There are only two of us eating,, so I only used several cups of chicken stock and then topped it off with water to make 8cups of liquid. I only used two pieces of chicken that were thigh/drumsticks. I also added extra alternative veggies to sub for celery since we are not fans. Buckwheat soba noodles were used instead of egg noodles and gave the texture I was looking for in the soup. I think this recipe is so good that it still would have been great if I didn't play with it.

WONDERFUL. flavors perfect. used 1/2 homemade broth from last night's roast chicken + 8 cups of water + boullion cubes. Made it a little saltier than my homemade, which tasted good with a cold. Used Reames frozen noodles + leftover chicken from roast chicken. This recipe is better than most you will get in a restaurant!

I loved this recipe. Husband and daughter were sick. They both loved it as well. Added just a bit of oregano and thyme and a tiny bit over 1/2 c of the parsley. The depth of flavor was awesome. My favorite part was the delicious mushrooms with the lemon juice. This will be my go to chicken noodle soup from now on.

Don't make the same mistake I did. I decided to use boneless skinless to avoid the mess of de-boning the bird. I sacrificed depth of flavor and the meat was dry. On the other hand, my toddler, who won't eat meat, devoured it. Will definitely make again but I'll do it with the whole bird the next time. I can not rate this recipe as I didn't prepare it as instructed.

Fabulous! Husband has been sick, and nearby establishments want $20 for some "homemade" chicken soup and a meager 4 servings of it at that, so I said forget that. I had 4 frozen bone in/skin on chicken I boiled in the 16 cups of water and 5 TBS of "Better Than Bullion" chicken paste. In 30 min I had fully cooked breasts and yummy stock. Also, I didn't buy fresh mushrooms because I had so many canned in my pantry, so I sauteed those in butter and tossed in the lemon juice with that. Fresh parsley is a must, and honestly I am one to cook with herbs and such, but I did NOT want to mess with the simplicity of this recipe, so I used the finely chopped fresh parsley that the recipe called for and that was it. Husband, 6yr old daughter and 2yr old son devoured it as well as myself. My only regret is that I haven't made this sooner!

Did a 1/2 batch using homemade stock and cubed chicken breast. Extra veggies. Left out the mushrooms. Used fresh egg noodles from the Asian market -- wonderful! Added fresh thyme and would definitely up the herbs, poss. add some oregano, too. Don't skip the parsley! Lots of parsley! The salt fan in the family suggested marinading the chicken in a bit of the stock with added salt (I don't add salt to my homemade stock so I have better control of seasonings). Altogether delicious , will use a lot!

This is an excellent recipe. I think the lemon juice and mushrooms offer an updated take on such a familiar theme. In an effort to find a hearty noodle at my market that would withstand freezing, I selected the Japanese Udon noodle. I add one pound of precooked noodles per batch of soup. It makes the soup a real meal.

My husband loves chicken noodle soup when he's sick so I decided to make him some homeade soup. I found this recipe and found it be extremely quick, simple and DE-LISH! The flavor is not heavy or salty or two spicy. It was perfect! The lemon juice gave it a fresh, "clean" taste. I ended up using a half of lemon, allowing it to simmer after adding the egg noodle. I also used a few dashes of italian seasoning (that included parsley) in lieu of the parsley alone. YUMMY and SIMPLE! And my husband was proud and "tore it up!!!" (He's a skeptical eater!) Smiles everywhere!

Yum! Quick to put together - especially since I had homemade broth in the freezer from the week before. Flavors really meld together well. Using the extra large noodles helps them not get mushy. This is a great go-to recipe for a satisfying and easy soup.

Excellent recipe! I used a smaller weight rotisserie chicken to save time and the soup ended up with plenty of meat. I added 2 minced garlic cloves when the vegetables were almost cooked. The egg noodles are great: we usually use whatever pasta we have in the cupboard, but the egg noodles are better.

this soup is very tasty, but needed some seasoning. I love sage so i added a ton. This makes a bunch of soup, so i bet i added 2 tablespoons of sage. I chopped up the veggies and sauteed them in butter. then I cut up a rotisserie chicken and added that with the broth. skipped the mushrooms, and added some chopped kale instead. Very heartwarming on a cold fall night!

This is my go-to soup recipe when my children have a cold. It is delicious and so easy to make. I seasoned as I went along and I think the best thing was a good helping of freshly ground black pepper. Also, be sure to use the wide egg noodles. I once used medium egg noodles thinking the smaller size would be nicer. They turned to mush in the leftover soup. The wide ones are just perfect and the soup is delicious for days!

Rating: 4
WOW is all i have to say about this soup. I was one of the skeptical ones, but this recipe proved me wrong. Plus, this recipe couldn't be easier so I anticipate making it all winter long. I omitted the mushrooms since I'm not a huge fan but will try the complete recipe next time. Since I made this spur of the moment, I used the chicken I had in my freezer6 thighs. I doubled the onions, carrots and celery stalks, used about 10 oz. of egg noodles and added 1 tsp each of dried oregano and thyme, at another reviewer's suggestion. It turned out great! And I have 4 quarts of leftovers so I'll freeze 3 of them. Just remember, when using low sodium chicken stock you'll need to add A LOT of salt once the soup is complete.

Simple and hearty recipe -- I followed one reviewer's lead and used frozen noodles, which made it even more fork-worthy. The only other thing I changed -- adding some herbs. I was surprised that there was no seasoning other than salt and pepper. So I added a teaspoon each of thyme and oregano. Delicious! This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

Traditional homestyle flavor with a nice twist: the sauteed mushrooms, which add a new depth and richness to the broth. Made two changes: cut the parsley back to 1/4 cup and used Reames' frozen egg noodles (regular-size bag) instead of the noodles called for. This added a nice chewy texture, rather like chicken and dumplings.

Delicious. I used a leftover rotisserie chicken from Costco and just picked the carcass clean by hand after it had simmered in water for a while (amazing how much meat you can get off of one of those things after you *think* it's bare). Add a bit of chicken stock and some veggies...dinner is served! I used leftover wild rice instead of noodles, but can't wait to make it again with the real deal.

Made the recipe as written with two exceptions: Took another reviewer's advice and used chicken breasts with ribs instead of whole chicken. I also took skin off. I then cooked the chicken in a slow cooker for 8 hours in enough of the chicken broth to fill my cooker. When finished, I had shredded chicken instead of chucks which is a perferred in our family. I used the balance of the chicken broth called for as I prepared the balance of the recipe. It turned out terrific!

oh my - what a great recipe. I have to say, I'm a chicken noodle snob, and this is one of the tastiest chick noods i've ever had, much less made. what's more, my boyfriend said it was the best chicken noodle he's ever had. he's currently going back for thirds. i doubled the all the veggies and, as in other reviews, sauteed the mushrooms w/ garlic. I also sauteed them longer than suggested, I like them really saturated w/ butter and that delicious garlicky flavor. also added a few pinches of oregano to the broth and a few generous sprinklings of garlic salt (we're garlic freaks). and, after pulling the chicken, seasoned it w/ some Lawry's seasoning salt. delicious! so good i plan to make for my younger siblings and would consider making for my boyfriend's mom when she comes to visit us.

Very good. I've made chicken soup before from scratch, but just boiled a whole chicken in water for the broth. As per this recipe, I added what broth I had on hand: 3 cans of low sodium chicken broth and one of those square cartons of vegetable broth. I added poultry seasoning (about 1-2 tsp)and fresh ground pepper for a little extra flavor. Also added more salt and veggies as others have mentioned. Quite tasty and will make again, perhaps with more chicken broth.

I made the recipe as stated. My low-sodium chicken broth was so low-sodium that my soup came out bland, bland, bland. I added a lot of sea salt and pepper. Then, when I served the soup, my family asked for salt at the table and some tabasco. After we adjusted the seasoning it was delicious. Next time, I will use narrow egg noodles instead of the wide ones as we prefer those.

This is a great recipe. I made it without the mushrooms because my fiance can't stand them. It was still excellent. I also used a whole rotisserie chicken from Whole Foods instead of cooking my own. I included the roasted skin for a really nice robust flavor. I found that I had to add more chicken broth when reheating leftovers, so keep some extra broth on hand.

I agree with the other cooks...exceptional chicken noodle soup. I made most of the changes suggested, ie chicken breasts, more veggies, garlic sauteed with shrooms, a touch of sherry. It doesn't hurt that we have Meyer lemons in our back yard...it gave the soup such a bright, fresh flavor. I also used fresh sage, bay leaf, thyme and fresh parsley. If you have a Trader Joe's in your area, try the lemon pepper pappardelle (noodles)...it really enhances the flavor...and I only used about 4 or 5 ounces, so the soup was very thick and hearty. This will be my go to recipe for chicken noodle soup in the future!

This was amazing! I have a sick husband at home right now and this did the trick! I made the following changes (some already stated, some of my own): 1. 5 cloves of garlic in with the mushrooms 2. I used a chicken rub on 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts prior to simmering in broth. 3. I added all of the vegetables right away, rather than waiting for the chicken to cook first, which really infused the flavor into the chicken. 4. I added some dried basil, oregano, and parsley. 5. Instead of increasing the amount of carrots and celery, I added about 3-4 cups of fresh spinach, an extra cup of mushrooms, and a can of corn. Delicious!

I made this soup for the first time and followed some others' suggestions by adding a litle more veggies to the pot, including a some fresh shelled peas from the produce dept of the grocery, and some garlic to the mushroom saute. I used two large bone-in breasts and two leftover pieces of roast chicken (the leftovers were from a recipe with orange, shallots and rosemary I got from this site). I also added a couple of tablespoons of Mrs Dash herb blend while simmering the breasts. And the noodles were the dried kluski type, which I think added a lot to the finished product. This turned out to be the best "comfort food" recipes I have made in a long time. The recipe made a huge amount, I shared it with friends and family and served it with "heat and eat" crusty french bread. Very satisfying on a really cold day!!

Rating: 4
Super easy and delicious. Cutting up the chicken is the most difficult part. I followed other users' advice and sauteed the mushrooms with minced garlic, and upped the amount of carrots, celery, onions, mushrooms and egg noodles in the recipe. Also used a slightly bigger chicken and added some McCormick's Italian Seasoning at the end. Delish! One note though, I left the egg noodles in a bit too long - I'd err on the side of under-cooking them, as they get softer just soaking in the broth.

Very good, solid base recipe for chicken noodle soup. Though most chicken soups recipes look like this, one key here is using fresh (Italian) parsley--and mushrooms. For soups, I've always found fresh herbs matter so much more. Also, throw in some whole peppercorns (about the stage you toss in the parsley). Like others here, I did saute` the onions (w/ a little garlic) in olive oil first--also added in some dried thyme and ground cumin to the saute (then tossed in the carrots/celery for a bit--and then the broth). Really, you could add you're own mix to this recipe very easily.

What a wonderful chicken soup. I had some homemade chicken stock in freezer and used it along with the canned broth. Used a shortcut by using 3 large skinless/boneless chicken breasts. Added more veggies and lemon and some peas. My husband loved it and so did I!

I added at others recommendations more broth, 19 cups and it worked perfectly. The smallest chicken I found at the store was 5.5 pounds so I accommodated this when thinking about my broth additions as well. I didn't use any mushrooms (belch) and added twice as many carrots and celery. I also added a little bit of heavy whipping cream (1/4 cup). With or without the cream this was WONDERFUL. It was my first attempt at making chicken noodle soup. My only problem was I couldn't remember how to quarter a whole chicken so I had to research that online for directions.

I adhered to the menu nearly 100%, deviating only to add a decent chunk of ginger to give the soup an extra flavor and also to give him a vitamin boost. Myself, I'm a vegetarian, but I tried the soup--really great. I didn't use a whole chicken, because (I'm sorry) dealing with the guts grossed me out, so I used just drumsticks. Turned out truly great.

Brilliant. I looked at the reviews of others who added extra veg, but didn't bother. As is, this gives you plenty of lovely broth. If you want something more chock full, add more veg. I let my stock cool in the fridge for some time so it was easier to skim off the fat. The best chicken noodle soup ever. I will never go back!

I followed the recipe as is but couldn't add parsley as the store was out of it. This soup needs a lot of salt to give it any flavor (granted, the stock I made didn't have much in it except the chicken carcass but I stuffed it with garlic, onions and lemon when I roasted it). Next time I'll try roasting or sauteing all the veggies before they go in the soup and I will cook the noodles separately in heavily salted water to give them some taste.

To save time on workdays, I cooked a whole chicken overnight in my slow cooker in half the broth; in the morning I strained the broth and refrigerated it; took the chicken meat off the bones and refrigerated it separately. That evening, I peeled the fat off the broth, put it into a soup pot with the rest of the broth and proceeded according to the recipe. By cooking the chicken ahead of time it was much easier to get the excess fat out of the broth. My family enjoys this soup; plain yet flavorful, like Mom used to make.

My husband and I thought the soup was very good. My daughter said it was better than the stuff from a can, but did not like the mushrooms. I used some vegetable stock in place of some of the chicken stock and I sauteed the onion and some garlic prior to adding the mushrooms. I removed enough from the big pot that did not yet have noodles in it and added noodles to just what we ate tonight. I will freeze the rest and add fresh noodles when we eat the next batch. It was a fun way to spend a rainy day.It is not a quick recipe but worth the time because there is a few meals in it.

In my and my guests opinions, the mushrooms add so much to this dish. I am shocked to see so many folks skipping 'em. In my experience, most folks who don't like mushrooms due to the fact that mushrooms can often have a "squeaky" consistency. That is certainly not an issue when they have been sautéed and added to a soup. I added slightly more carrots and celery, and lots more onion. I used 12 oz of noodles rather than 8, and next time I will go with 16oz. The family loved this, and made a big deal out of such a simple (although time consuming) recipe.

I've just made this again this for the first time this winter. It is always great. Easy, straightforward, but forgiving enough of a recipe that you can add or subtract just about anything. Got more veggies? Throw them in. Not much chicken. No problem. Pre-roasted chicken? Sure! I agree with previous comments that it freezes well but only without the noodles. They tend to go to mush after defrost and reheat. Cook everything together except the noodles. Freeze. After you've reheated the base, add noodles. Super!

I'm making this for the second time. For more flavor, I browned whole chicken breasts and thighs in olive oil and then roasted in oven for about 30 minutes. I used water and better than boullion, and added pulled apart chicken (discarding bones and skin). I added fresh thyme, salt and pepper, to broth. For a change and because I like it, I added long grain rice to broth instead of noodles. It cooked up in about 30 minutes. Very nice. I have to have garlic, so I sauteed 5-6 garlic cloves in pan drippings, along with mushrooms and some lemon. Added this plus veggies, and simmered for a few minutes. A nice addition for me was using frozen pearl onions instead of chopped onion. It was easy and very nice flavor. I will try the sherry this time. Used white wine last time. Will continue to make.

My family absolutely loved this soup. The recipe is simple to follow, the ingredients list is fairly inexpensive and it makes a large amount of soup that freezes well. I added corn as per my daughters' request and used low-salt boullion rather than canned broth with great results. I will most definitely be making this soup again.

I've been making for the past year and have found what I think is the best combination. I saute the veggies with garlic and squeeze the juice of 2 lemons as well as add some lemon zest to the mixture. The combination is great and really adds wonderful flavor to the soup.

I thought this recipe was just OK. The fact that you don't use fresh homemade chicken stock, fresh herbs or much in the way of vegetables leaves a distinct canned soup taste. The least you should expect is to brown and carmelize the chicken for some real flavor...but not in this recipe. If you want a real old fashioned chicken noodle soup with tons of flavor check out "Cook's Illustrated" Best Recipe recipe!

Great variation of "Mom's traditional chicken noodle soup". I agree that the frozen egg noodles are best for this recipe and it also helps to add other spices. I added some roasted minced garlic, thyme and basil. Turned out perfect.

My whole family of picky eaters loves this recipe!! I usually add more chicken, split the dish into two portions and add ramen noodles (discarding the seasoning) right before I serve it. A little spicy kick is great with this receipe too!!

The best chicken soup ever!! I suggest adding fresh squeezed lemon juice to the mushrooms, and also buying fresh organic veggies helps. And slicing the mushrooms very thin is good also. I also used very healthy whole grain noodles as opposed to regular enriched flower egg noodles, which makes it even more healthy! I will make this soup every time anyone is sick, it's also fast and easy!

I made this recipe twice, and I sauted the mushrooms the second time. I love mushrooms but this recipe doesn't need it, they just get rubbery. If you use them slice them really thin.

Amy When adding noodles to soup Boiling the noodles or even cooking them with the soup makes the soup cloudy. So I 1. cook noodles seperate.. al dante . . rinse well add noodles to soup last 10 minutes( just to keep them hot)of cooking the soup. This also gets rid of the starch by cooking noodles seperately...

Answer for Amydyson: Hi Amy, cook the soup wihout the noodles -- especially if you're leaving it on the stove for a while. Egg noodles cook very quickly and will turn mushy. Add the noodles 10-15 minutes before you're ready to eat. Enjoy!

I made a huge batch early in the day to help with my cold. It turned out great ... but I must have let it simmer too long throughout the day, because eventually the noodles turned to mush. Any tips about this problem? Or did I just let it cook too long?

My wife has a nasty cold and I wanted a recipe that not only had the obvious medicinal quality of a classic chicken noodle soup but offered enough flavor to penetrate her congested head. Well, after three bowls she said it was the best soup she's ever had. I doubled all of the veggies, used baby portabella mushrooms, and added some dill (her favorite spice). Fantastic!

Great soup. I used it as a foundation for a chicken noodle soup and added a few things like, garlic. I also doubled the amount -- and after cooking the first chicken I added more broth, more veggies and then bought a roasted chicken and added that meat. That way, I had plenty to freeze for a cold winter's night. Really wonderful recipe. Enjoy!

Fantastic! This is my new favorite soup recipe. My husband and I tried the soup after it was finished and ended up standing over the pot eating for a good 15 min. I added about 10 cloves of garlic, some peas and quite a bit of fresh cilantro. The flavor is outstanding. This recipe is a keeper!

I had a couple of pounds of left-overs from a roasted chicken meal. Tried this recipe because of all the raves. It is awesome!! I used lots of veggies as suggested...4 big carrots. 4 large stalks celery and 3 cups of baby Bella mushrooms with about six tablespoons of butter. Used some rotini pasta that had been around too long and it turned out really well! I froze half of the stock and cooked 8 oz. pasta in the remaining stock. With four adults and two children at the table there were zero left-overs. It's the ONLY way I will ever cook chicken noodle soup.

Wonderful Chicken Soup, but needs some doctoring to make it flavorful. I added a spice bag to the broth with Sage, Garlic, Thyme and Oregano and it was a perfect addition. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. The sauteed mushrooms with lemon made this soup so savory. This was a perfect soup to sooth my husband's throat after his surgery, and we have both been eating it for days. Will be the tradition in my house!

I flah roasted a salt and peppered chicken with carrots, onions and garlic which I preserved and later added to the soup. I deglzed the roasting pan with white wine and added the glze to the final product as well. I added poultry herbs (thyme, sage, rosemary) during the boiling of the broth. The only shortcoming is that I ended overcooking the noodles (can you say ooooooops) however that was my fault completely. My son can't stop eating it!

For a great twist use cut up flour tortilla strips instead of egg noodles. Add them at the end and allow them to soften. This might sound strange, but they are delicious! I've tried both ways and the tortilla strips always taste better.

Rating: 3
A great basic soup to springboard into something with bigger flavor. I salt & peppered the chicken in a roasting pan, added 1/2 onion (quartered), a celery stalk (large pieces) & a few cloves of garlic than flash roasted the chicken at 450 degrees for five minutes each side until browned. Transferred chicken & veggies to my pressure cooker, deglazed the roasting pan with chicken stock (or wine) & put with chicken. Pressured the chicken for 10 minutes at 5lbs. Removed chicken & discarded veggies. It is a few more steps but same amount of time and the big flavor is so worth it.

This is an easy kid-friendly recipe that my family really enjoys! Easy to adapt to any taste preferences. My kids don't like the mushrooms so we delete them and usually add some extra herbs for more flavor.

Good basic base but needs some doctoring. Based on other reviews, I doubled the veggies, added a bit of sherry to the soup and the mushrooms, and added a bay leaf, cayanne pepper, fresh thyme, savory, rubbed sage and sauteed shallots. I also preferred adding the parsley to individual bowls as a garnish so it retained its fresh flavor.

Rating: 3
This has become a family staple. I throw the chicken in water with onion, parsley, carrot and celery and make a stock, then pull the meat off, strain out the vegies, and add new vegies to the meat and noodles. It is really a great standby and for sick kids. You could also try buying a roast chicken at the store and using that. I roasted a chicken with rosemary and stuff, and it made a great stock. I used the left over chicken from the roast and it had great flavor.

This is the best chicken noodle soup that I have ever had!!! I only had 10 cups of broth so I added water and it still tasted great. I also added the bay leaf, garlic, and way more veggies than the recipe called for (a whole bag of carrots, 2.5 cups of mushrooms and 3 stalks of celery). Instead of parsley, I added thyme. Also white pepper and this gourmet jalepeno puree that I had on hand.....absolutely amazing!

I don't generally like chicken noodle soup, but I came down with a horrible cold & decided to make some soup (since it was the only thing i could swallow).

Easily convertable for low carbers! We are on a low-carb diet, so we skipped the noodles and moderated the carrots. Other than that, this recipe is fantastic for any meal. I didn't have fresh parsley, so I had to use dried, and garnished with some thinly sliced scallions for a pop of color. Your guests will think this is straight out of a professional chef's kitchen!

Wonderful chicken soup! Very simple and homey - - the mushrooms and lemon were a nice touch. The only thing I would maybe do is to add potatos or flour to thicken up the broth a little bit. I also made a bouquet garni (peppercoen, parsley and black pepper) for the broth while cooking. I felt healthy after eating this.

I made this soup to comfort my son who's come down with the flu today. Instead of broth I used "Better than Boullion" w/ water. I also added extra carrots and blended all the vegetables (including the sauted mushrooms) in a blender and then added this to the soup-this way the vegetables "disappear" into the soup. This successful trick throws off the picky eater in the family. I also added thyme and garlic as others suggested. Made fresh garlic bread on the side. Pleased the whole family. Recipie is a keeper for the cold/flu season.

As my husband not-so-tactfully declared, "this is the first good Chicken Noodle Soup you've ever made!" However, I roasted a chicken and used canned broth (plus some dried thyme) and leftover meat in the first step. I also made homemade egg noodles, which were delish. Agree that the mushrooms area nice touch!

This was so comforting and tasted even better the next day. I made my own chicken stock the day before with dried thyme and added the remaining bones during the final cooking phase. I agree with the previous reviewers -- the mushrooms and lemon add a bonus homemade touch. By the way, this soup freezes very well. I added a tad bit of the mushroom/lemon mixture, carrots, celery and a little fresh dill and parsley while reheating.

I've made this soup a dozen times experimenting with spices (I like tarragon the best), and never really looking at the measurements. I don't like cooking the chicken with skin in the broth beforehand - I did that for the first time tonite. It just adds extra fat that's a pain to remove, and doesn't really enhance the flavor. I like sauteeing the vegetables, adding white wine, and then the broth, then adding raw chopped chicken with no skin or fat. I think that gives the broth a milky look too, and I like that. And I love the lemon-mushrooms added with the noodles. They really make a difference. I don't bother with garlic in the soup, but I think the garlic bread idea sounds grrreat.

Rating: 3
I thought this recipe was really superb, probably because I followed much of the advice within the other reviews. I chopped up 5 large carrots, 4 celery stalks, probably 2 cups of chopped onions, tons of garlic, couple small bay leaves, rubbed sage, thyme, added sherry to the mushrooms and a splash to the pot (what a great suggestion...added a bit of depth, nice aroma, felt a bit more "grown up"). I added 16 oz of frozen Reames noodles to the dish instead of the egg noodles, just perfect. I went a little overboard with the parsley (my broth had a lovely kelly green hue to it), but it was a great winter weeknight meal.

Fresh Sage leaves are an added bonus as well as a bay leaf and basil. I would reserve some soup w/o the noodles as they become too soggy (even the really thick egg noodles)after a day or two.

Delicious soup- a certain winner for a cold night by the fire. Get a loaf of good crusty bread & a nice glass of wine. I threw a few cloves of garlic in w/the chicken for its initial cooking- it bumped up the flavor just right.

This is a great version of an old fashioned soup for those rainy days when you have a cold. I thought the mashrooms and lemon juice where the twist that makes this recipe unique and yummy.

Felt like some comfort food on a cold fall evening, and this really hit the spot.

This is is a keeper. Love the extra flavor the mushrooms and lemon give! I also doubled the veggies and parsley and added a little extra water. Ditto to the Cook from Atlanta right down to the Picky Husband!!! Second time I made this I used a much heartier pasta noodle and only cooked the pasta for approx. 3 minutes as I was freezing most of the soup and the noodles still cook while the soup cools down. I suggest this if you are not eating all of the soup right away. I freeze this in individual servings - it's mid June and my co-workers have summer colds and this is great comfort food!

Excellent!! I was at home sick when I made it and it was the cure! I used two chicken breasts and a game hen as I was lacking a whole chicken. I threw in three garlic cloves and a bay leaf while the meat cooked. I doubled the carrots and followed the advice to add a little sage and thyme. Don't leave out the mushrooms! I usually don't like them, but they add something special to the soup. I used 4 dried shitake and 4 (accidentally) dried chanterelles. Yummmm!

I feel guilty saying this but this soup is better than my grandmother's chicken noodle.

If you are looking for a real at home flavor this is it! My husband took his first bite and asked if there was more. My extremely picky 7 yr old son exclaimed "this is awesome!!", that's as high a praise as you can get!!! This recipe will definately be made again!!

This soup is very nice. My one suggestion is use water and make your own broth. 16 cans of broth @ about $1.50 each is a lot more expensive then 12 cups of water and it tastes a little better. Otherwise, pretty darn good. Ohh yeah, try dill instead.

I really really enjoyed this soup. It was an unusually chilly day and was craving chicken noodle soup but didn't want to go through the usual hassle and this was the perfect solution. I'm used to making my own stock, boiling the whole chicken and making my own egg noodles, which results in an all-day affair. With a minimal sacrifice of flavor, this was very very quick, easy, and good. I used a diluted demi-glace for the broth and boneless,skinless breasts which cooked quick and were easy to shred. My family doesn't like mushrooms so I just added some more of the other vegetables which worked very well. I really liked the lemon juice which I have not seen in other recipes, but it added an interesting gourmet-style taste. Very good

I added a lot more fresh lemon juice (about a whole lemon's worth)and it turned out excellent! Will make this recipe again and again!!

I made this last night and my family couldn't get over how wonderful it was! It is very easy to prepare and you can even get the kids involved in the slicing and chopping! This is going to be my Chicken Soup for those cold, rainy days!

This recipe was very delicious, the traditional chicken noodle soup. Very chunky. I used a whole head of garlic and boiled it with the broth. Also added green onions. When making it again, I will cut up less carrots and celery.

Really yummy soup and easy! I used store bought rotisserie chicken, which made the meat and broth really good. I tripled the carrots and celery and doubled the onions and parlsey. I also added a few cloves of garlic to the mushrooms. Will definitely make again and again.

The first time I made this soup my wife called her best friend and told her it was awsome. If it passes her taste buds with that type of reaction its a good recipe

This was delicious. I added a little Wondra flour for thickening and I used extra wide egg noodles. It freezes nicely

I've already rated this recipe and felt the need to add to my comments. I was the one who used store bought broth and roasted chickens. Recently, I used Roasted Garlic flavoured broth and it was GREAT. No need to add garlic in mushrooms. Flavour is already there.Plus, I wish I could get a week out of it. My family devours this regularly. Still a great recipe.

The soup was great and my only question regarding the recipe was the use of 16 cups of canned chicken broth. I'm sure my grandma, if she was alive today, would find it amusing to make chicken soup from scratch with store bought broth instead of water, more seasonings and vegetables. The recipe was very good, but I will keep searching and experimenting until I come up with a satisfactory "old-fashioned chicken soup" that uses no processed products. Maybe I'm getting too old fashioned?

This is really a great soup. I have made it many times in the past 3 weeks. I also used the cooked rotisserie chicken and skinned and deboned. I actually put the bones in with the broth and simmered for a while. I don't know if this helped at all but the end result was great. I would use the lower sodium 32oz "boxed" broth because it was fairly salty even without the additional salt added. I prefer this soup without the garlic. Follow the easy directions and this is a foolproof soup.

This was an excellent and easy recipe. I substituted tofu for the chicken (tofu made the prep and clean-up time much less). I added a little extra onion and celery and put the tofu in with the noodles and Wallah! A very healthy soup for the flu season in Alaska.

I absolutely loved this soup. It is the best. I did make a few minor additions to the soup as well and it gave it such a delicious flavor. I added four cloves of garlic to the mushrooms while they were browning in the pan and I also added Sason Accent (used in Spanish cooking - Cuban, Puerto-Rican, etc...), Sason Accent really adds to the flavor of the soup - I used 3 packets of Sason Accent and added it to the soup. Instead of using the egg noodles I subsititued angel hair pasta and the soup was incredible. Great comfort food for the cold nights we get up here in the North.

I added some garlic and spices of my own to pep it up a bit such as rosemary and sage. I think the soup tasted better the next day after the flavors mingled. Thankfully, it didn't become mushy the second day around from the noodles. Either the soup or the labor of love it took to create it cured my husband's cold.

Excellent, easy soup to prepare. Followed advice of others and added 3 cloves of garlic and 5 carrots. Would like to try adding lemon at the end to the broth base instead of with the mushrooms. Will definitely make again & again.

This is definitely a simple recipe that is enjoyable. Adding garlic and some herbs such as rosemary and sage definitly give it that extra something. I plan on making this for some of those Canadian winter nights!

Not only one of the best chicken soup recipes, it's also the best chicken soup I've ever eaten. As stated, saute some garlic with the mushrooms, definetly use the frozen noodles and don't be afraid to season well!

This chicken noodle soup is divine! I used extra thick egg pasta and the Pacific natural chicken broth. I also added 3 sm cloves garlic and extra carrots as recommended by other reviewers. I think the broth and sauteed mushrooms make this soup so good!

I only had about 9 cups of broth, and I added one clove of garlic. I also used shitake mushrooms to jazz it up. My whole family is delighted with this recipe.

This soup is delicious! I, too, added some garlic, and also increased the quantity of carrots and celery. I also added a package of frozen peapods and a bit of dried thyme. I'll definitely add this recipe to my "favorites" list!

This soup is wonderful! I did add a little minced garlic to the mushrooms while sauteeing, and used the frozen homestyle egg noodles instead of dried...yummy! Perfect snowed-in food!
