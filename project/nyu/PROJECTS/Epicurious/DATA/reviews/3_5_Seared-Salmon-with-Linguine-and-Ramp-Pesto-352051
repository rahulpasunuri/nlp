Yah, ramps are wild leeks, and are pretty hard to find. Look for them in mid-to-late spring, and usually only at specialty produce stands, farmers' markets, etc. In season, this is a goto recipe for me. The flavors are intense, and go perfectly together. I've substituted pine nuts for the almonds, which works pretty well, and I've also subbed baby leeks for the ramps in summer, which isn't quite as good, but still delicious. For anyone not familiar with ramps, this is a great way to try to them -- simple recipe with huge flavor.

I just came home from the Union Square Farmer's Market in NYC with two bunches of fat ramps and am looking for recipes. This is the time and I have bought them the last couple years. For those who don't know what ramps are, one may type in "ramps recipes" and get an explanation.

Your best chance for finding ramps is going to be at a Farmers Market. They are rarely commercially available and have a very short season, so grab them if you see them. I bought two bunches today at my local farm market and looking forward to trying them out.

I found ramps, finally at Whole Foods but I had to bug the produce manager for a month. Fortunately he was a good sport. My husband and I really liked this recipe. But, the pesto is very rich. Salmon prepared this way was really good and the pesto went with the salmon very well.

I could not find ramps so I used a combo of 1 leek, 2 scallions and a couple green onions. My husband and I both loved the pesto on the salmon. All the flavors are really present,tarragon,almonds,cheese, and shallots,etc. I think I overcooked my pasta a bit and I'm not sure I added enough of the reserved water. My husband liked the whole dish. I thought the pasta was a bit bland.

Where would one get ramps? I'm pretty well-versed in exotic cooking ingredients, but have never heard of this one!

According to my research, it's a wild leek. It looks a bit like a green onion (in size), although it has broad leaves.

What on earth are 'ramps'?
