I came across this recipe while Epicurious was highlighting corn dishes at the end of summer. I took a chance and whipped up a batch for an end-of-summer-BBQ at a friends house. It was such a hit that the bowl was gone within an hour, and everyone was complimenting me on how amazing it was. The flavors are varied and blend very well together. Texture is great, and it could be used on top of meats, in a tortilla, or straight as a salsa. Highly recommended.

Very tasty. Made a great appetizer paired with steamed shrimp.

I liked this recipe a lot. I agree that you could add zucchini and serve it as side, but I really liked it as a salsa. I might make it more spicy next time, and I'll use lime instead of lemon juice again, but it's great as is. I highly recommend toasting cumin seeds instead of just using cumin.

excellent salsa, i made it for our bbq yesterday and every one loved it, i made a single batch and probably should have made a double. i added cilantro, and lime juice to make the flavor pop even more. 5 star

Excellent! Used only some of the jalapeno seeds and a red tomato and it turned out great. Served it as a side dish to accompany Thai spiced pork tenderloin - yumm! The flavours in this recipe are very fresh and flavourful. -corine webster- Victoria, BC Canada

Great way to use up leftover corn on the cob - even though my corn was already cooked, I followed the recipe and it worked fine.

Several friends have had a variation of this recipe and loved it. I made it more of a side dish with chopped pieces of zucchini and red bell pepper. I didn't have cumin seeds so I put cumin powder in the olive oil. I also used lime instead of lemon.

Delicious and very easy. Instead of using it as a salsa, it was a side dish with Grilled Chicken. Great the day after!
