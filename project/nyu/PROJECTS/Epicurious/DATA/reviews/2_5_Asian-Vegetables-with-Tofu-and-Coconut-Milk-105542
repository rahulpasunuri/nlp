To say this dish would be good for Vegetarians is insulting - it's incredibly bland.

I love Pasteur, and the vegetable mixture in this recipe is attractive -- but there's just not much flavor to this. Perhaps the vegetables need to be seared/stir fried?

How disappointing! Talk about curiosity killing the cat... The combination of oyster sauce and coconut milk just turned out weird. A complete waste of good ingredients.

I really liked this dish but modified it a bit. I used low-fat coconut milk, added veggie broth and used fish sauce instead of oyster sauce. With a few subtle variations I thought it was great.

Although this dish sounds like a nice change from your regular stir fry, I found it a huge disappointment especially after using such a good variety of vegetables. The oyster & soy sauces took away from the coconut flavor and the sauce ended up really thin. I won't bother trying to thicken up the sauce "next time" since the flavor wasn't even appealing enough for me to try this recipe again. Next time I'll stick to the more traditional Thai curries that use coconut milk.

This dish gets my approval because of the sheer simplicity in preparing it! The sauce was great & the coconut milk was an interesting addition. Plus, this recipe makes the perfect amount for two, so no halving required!

This is a good recipe. I used a variety of veggies, and baked my own tofu marinated in a teriyaki style sauce. I liked it, it was different from a lot of the other stir fry dishes because of the coconut milk, but not as heavy as a thai curry.

This recipe was a real dissapointment. I definately won't be making this again. It sure sounds good, but when it's all made, it's not very good at all.

Because I was making this for 6 people, I needed to at least double the recipe, but instead, I decided to add more asian veggies, i.e. bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts. I don't particularly care for tofu so I substituted tempeh instead...it was excellent! I loved the addition of coconut milk, whick I also used to make the rice, cutting the water in half and substituting the coco. milk... It was a hit!

The coconut milk was a nice twist on a traditional stirfry. I will keep the recipe on hand for use with whatever vegetables are in season.

A wonderful,healthy recipe. I used a low fat coconut milk. Since I couldn't find the "baby"stuff, I just used the "normal sized" vegetables. It was great, served with brown rice.
