Delicious! I used a combination of yellow heirloom and vine ripe tomatoes. I didn't have red wine vinegar so used a high quality sherry vinegar instead. I also subbed the regular cucumber for lemon cucumber and the jalapeno for serrano. I also didn't have time to chill for 6 hours so I put into individual bowls and put in the freezer to chill while I made the main course and it was perfect. I garnished with cucumber and cilantro and zing! It was perfect. Main take-away: this is a great foundation recipe that can be altered liberally and still be great!

I recently went to Michael's in Santa Monica and sat outside on the patio and thoroughly enjoyed his spicy gazpacho! I came home, found this recipe, doubled the jalapeno pepper and, to my memory, it was really close to his remarkable soup. I even floated a little minced cucumber and shrimp with a cilantro leaf on a round tortilla just (hidden just beneath the surface)...for an artistic garnish! fantastic!

Excellent. I added 1 clove of garlic instead of 3. Also, omitted the jalapeno since I didn't have any on hand. I had trouble forcing the puree thru our sieve - probably too small. Would serve chunky style next time to cut down on work. I think it's important to use only the freshest tomatoes you can find.

Opps! I rated the wrong Spicy Gazpacho. I meant the one from BA August 1998. I will have to try this one also.

Great Gazpacho and filling too! I omitted the bread and used the jalapeños, as that is what I had on hand. This is one of those recipes that you can change things for suttle differences. Also quick and easy.

My husband and I really liked it. I added extra vinegar, lots of salt and some dried parsley for color. I would definitely prepare it again!

I liked this recipe but I think that the other spicy gazpacho is better. This one had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Could have been the tomatoes or something else. I made this for a dinner party. I will not make it again. There are other recipes that i prefer.

I made a double batch of this gazpacho for a Fourth of July picnic and everyone loved it. Some of the picnic-goers were spice-shy, so I used only one jalapeno. It was still good, but I will use two jalapenos next time. The soup travels well.

very tasty, we all liked it very much. As we had leftovers, my husband suggested we added a few sprigs of cilantro to it, we did and we thought it enhanced the taste.
