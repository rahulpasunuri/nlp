I love this recipe so much, I've made it several times and I'm making it for a casual dinner party this weekend.The watercress salad is so refreshing, and makes the dish pretty to serve. I used unflavored, Greek yogurt instead of creme fraiche, and put a lot more on than what is shown in the photo. Nice, healthy dish!

All the elements of this recipe are delicious. Since I was making it for a larger number, I cut it down a little. I had a huge skinned salmon fillet and cut it into 2" squares. 14 minutes was just right and the fish came out moist. I omitted the watercress and used the herb salad as a bed for the fish on a large platter. It gave just enough hint of the herbs with everything else being served. The sour cream sauce was wonderful. I noticed several guests using it as a dip for baby fingerlings tossed in butter & mint. This salmon dish is a perfect choice for a summer, casual lunch.

Excellent spring dish. I roasted asparagus along with salmon and layered it under fish on plate. Didn't have watercress but used mache(a small gourmet green) was very good.

Lovely recipe!I must confess we didn't do the salad part but instead used the marinade and the lemon pepper sauce on grilled salmon. And one other thing I added was smoked paprika. (But of course everything gets smoked paprika these days, can't leave the stuff alone.) Wonderful flavors that were bright and fresh without over powering the salmon, which I think is a common error. Thank you once again Epicurious!

The marinade is fantastic! The lemon-pepper sauce needed a bit more water, a tiny bit of olive oil, and lemon juice to make it drizzle-able. I also used spinach rather than watercress as it isn't frequently available where I live. I also added a lentil salad with a simple vinaigrette. Was a crowd pleaser-I'll be getting cravings for it!

Wow, fabulous, delicious. Easy to make, fabulous result. I have made this several times. Tonight I substituted basa (catfish) for the salmon, and it, yet again, turned out fantastic. The creme fraiche is much better than any substitute.

I loved this recipe so much I am adapting it for a chicken salad tonight. Also I gave the recipe to a friend and she loved it just as much as I do. I used plain organic yogurt instead of creme fraiche, agave syrup instead of honey, and mixed baby lettuce greens rather than the cress, dill, and tarragon leaves. I'd like to try the original recipe some day but I prefer to use what's at home before hiking to the store. The key to flavor is the lemon, shallots, and the freshest salmon you can catch. So delicious!

I made this last night and loved it--definitely a keeper. My store was out of fresh tarragon, so I hydrated some dried in lemon juice and used that in the vinaigrette with good results. Served it with roasted red potatoes with Rosemary and asparagus. Yum.

Fabulous, simple and beautiful. I served it with a leomny potato salad though which was just too much lemon all around, but this recipe was great, I'd just pair it with something else next time.

I only made the salmon portion; take my review in that context. Too sweet; the honey overpowered the salmon flavor (which I love). Too mushy: marinating the salmon with lemon juice changed its texture. I remain devoted to roasting salmon with a little olive oil, salt and pepper. Whole Foods sells a lemon/dill butter, which is sweeter than what I have been able to duplicate - a thin pat of this melted over salmon roasted at high temp is still an unbeatable salmon dish.

This was delicious, easy to make and healthy! I had lots of sauce left over, maybe there is a little extra for the watercress? Nonetheless, it was fantastic!

This was an excellent recipe for sockeye salmon! Fabulous as is, but even better with a few missing ingredients! I added some extra flavor to jazz this up a little bit& first off the marinade was adjusted: I added some of the fresh tarragon (chopped), about a teaspoon of mint leaves (chopped or dried), dash of dill weed, and cut the pepper back so it wouldnt over power the other flavors. I let the salmon marinate for an hour as indicated. For the sour cream mixture I tweaked by adding: A generous squeeze of honey, dash of dill weed, chopped tarragon, dash of chopped mint. WOW!! This really tied in all the flavors and made my mouth water!

wow oh wow! this was fantastic. i used the creme fraice (vs, suggestions of fat-free yogurt and sour cream) and it took the dish to another level. i also double the lemon rind and juice and was pleased. i agree while this will not blow your mind in originality, it is solid and satisfying and very easy. i look forward to serving this to guests.

good flavors, especially the marinade. Agree with the prev reviewer that the sauce needs something more, but was not bad.

This was very simple, healthy and great. I made half of the sauce and half of the marinade for two pieces of salmon. It just seemed much easier than dividing the recipe in fourths. I made the sauce two hours ahead, whisked the marinade in a 8 x 8 oven-proof dish an hour and a half ahead and added the salmon to the marinade and refrigerated for an hour. Spreading the steps out over time (though this is an easier dish in general than I usually prepare to begin with)made the preparation painfully easy. The only comment I will make is that while I did like the sauce, I felt that it could have used dill or more zest...something. I paired this with the pasta with goat cheese, lemon and asparagus from the Bon Appetit, June 09 issue. FAB combination!!!!

We loved this salmon dish - for two people we made 1/3 the marinade for 2 pieces salmon and 1/3 the sauce but the full amount of watercress salad. Instead of creme freche, we substituted fat free fage (greek yogurt), which worked out great - creamy and delicious and low fat. Even though we took the salmon out at 12-13 minutes, we could have taken it out a minute earlier. To serve, we plated the watercress aside the salmon, with a little yogurt sauce on top and a side of pasta: whole wheat pasta, tossed with spinach pesto and a handful of quartered, ripe cherry tomatoes. Will definitely make this again.

I agree with the description of this "simple to prepare but impressive when served." This was so easy and absolutely delicious. My only suggestion for the sauce would be to let it stand at room temperature for a while, I took mine right out of the fridge and it made a big "blop" on top vs. a nice drizzle. Oh, I also used sea salt vs. the Fleur de sel. Keeper for the next dinner party!

I served this at an "elegant" dinner party. It ended up being the easiest thing on my menu to prepare and got universal rave reviews. I did a mixture for the salad - baby greens, some watercress and dill and tarragon. Like suggested, I served with potatoes - small boiled new with butter and dill. It was pretty on the plate and the salmon was perfect. I agree with the reviewer that it won't stand out as "unusual" or particularly unique - - but it was moist, flavorful and delicious. Everyone wanted the recipe.

I made this for a dinner party and the "meat and potatoe" people cleaned their plate! The best part is that it was fast and easy. The herb salad was a great compliment to the fish. The honey added the perfect amount of sweetness.

The salmon marinade is quite good and the caramelized shallots were delicious on top of the salmon. I let the marinade sit for only 20 min or so but next time I'll let it sit longer. It didn't soak up as much flavor as I would have liked. I didn't make the salad but I did try making the lemon pepper sauce for dipping. Next time I'll just skip it; it isn't anything special and just calls for more ingredients to purchase.

This was fantastic! Will definitely make agian. I noticed a couple reviewers were confused about the pepper taste to the recipie but the watercress has the pepper flavor. I also did like the recipe says and was heavy on the pepper! The only thing I did differently was substitute nonfat greek strained yogurt for the sour cream.

This turned out fabulously, and was very easy to make. My brother, who normally hates salmon, ate it up! I made 8 6-oz fillets, and had about half the sauce left over. Next time would halve the sauce. I also used light sour cream and it was still very rich. Also, the salad wilts quickly so leave off lemon juice and oil until right before serving.

This was absolutely delicious. While I was a bit worried about the presence of honey in the recipe (I'm not usually a big fan of sweet), it really added a whole new dimension to the flavor. However, be careful how much fleur de sel and lemon juice you add to the watercress salad. It can quickly become overpowering. It also likes to settle to the bottom, so if you have some of the salad in a bowl alongside what's on the plate, the stuff near the bottom can nearly sear your tastebuds clean off.

I made this the other night for a friend and it was really easy. I don't have a lot of experience making fish but I thought that the sauce was really simple and looked fancier than it is. Will use it in the future in other recipes for sure. Couldn't find creme fraiche so I used sour cream but my friend was none the wiser. Great for a romantic meal or a simple dinner party. Too bad fish is so expensive...
