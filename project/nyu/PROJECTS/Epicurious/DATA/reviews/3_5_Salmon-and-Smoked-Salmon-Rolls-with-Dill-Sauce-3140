I have made this for 3 Seders and everyone just raved about this

What a wonderful change of pace! I did a "test run", but with relish instead of dill pickle, which is a little too pronounced; I'll stick to the original recipe and serve it at the seders.

I have served this dish for my fish course for Passover every year since since the recipe was published in the April '97 issue of Bon Appetit. I'm so sorry that Kankor and her family did not like this. I have made enough rolls from 8 to 40 people, depending on the amount of guests and it always receives rave reviews. Maybe Kankor left something out or maybe something was substituted. I make it exactly as the recipe recommends (I always use Hellman's mayonnaise) and it always looks elegant and tastes wonderful. Kankor should give it another try.

nobody in my family liked it.

A very pretty dish, but highly disappointing. It simply lacked flavor. It was watery and bland.

This was terrific! This is one of those dishes that looks like it took WAY longer to make than it did. I made it as an appetizer for our Passover Seder. Everyone was very impressed. My mom and aunt even asked for the recipe (one of the highest compliments, I think). I skimped on the mayo a bit (I make my own), but that turned out to be o.k. I also steamed the zucchini for 5 minutes instead of three. It was beautiful and tasted great. I had left over salmon mixture and I'm going to eat it on matzoh for a few days! YUM!!!!

This is really yummy and so pretty. I did not make the salmon filling exactly as given, but mixed a little over 1/2 lb salmon fillet with 5 oz. chopped smoked salmon, 3 tbs. chopped pickle, a couple of sprinkles of dried dill, about 1 tbs chopped shallot (I love shallot with salmon!), and enough mayonaise to make a good consistency. I did not use vinegar or make dill sauce, but put three rolls on a plate, like spokes on a wheel, with halved cherry tomatoes in between. I did not use Pesach mayonaise (which I do not buy, but make) because I made them in August, but I wouldn't recommend it anyway. I think that it would destroy the delicate flavors. Also, I think my above filling mix makes a great spread for crackers!

I highly recommend this. The presentation matched the superb taste. I made this as the first course for our seders. However, I substituted a similar Bon Appetit salmon/smoked salmon filling, and omitted the dill sauce. The recipe was called Herbed and Smoked Salmon Spread from Bon Appetit January 2001. This particular filling had more flavor.

I haven't tried this but I was reading the reviews and saw the comment about the Passover mayonnaise and wanted to throw in my two cents... Passover mayo is indeed horrible (let me underline the word "horrible"!!) so I make my own for Passover. It's very easy and I'm sure you could find recipes on this site, but basically you throw an egg into a food processor with some salt, a drop of lemon (if desired... or some garlic, anything you like really) and then with the motor running you slowly add about a cup of oil (any vegetable or olive depending on your taste). Homemade is a vast improvement over storebought Passover mayo (Elmer's Glue would be an improvement!!!)

All the ingredients are things I like! The combination is great!

My friend actually made this. She said it wasn't the easiest recipe to make, but boy was it delicious!!

It is a good recipe except for the mayonnaise. I have tried this so-called mayonnaise made from cottonseed oil (only kosher l' pesach oil available), and it is terrible.
