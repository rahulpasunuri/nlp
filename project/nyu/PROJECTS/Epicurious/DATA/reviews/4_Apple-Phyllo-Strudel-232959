Addendum to my review below: tossed gingersnap crumbs & finely chopped nuts with dash chinese five spice powder in place of Amaretti or graham crackers. Also did not use berries or yogurt.

Made 6 for a Beer-n-Brats festival for 30 men! Have always used real butter on filo dough. Never used butter cooking spray...it certainly simplified the process and still tasted good. Would I use butter spray again? If I were making more than one strudel, absolutely! Served the sauce on the side; a must!

No raspberries available. Doubled the cherries and soaked them in brandy for one hour before cooking. Everything else the same. A definite repeat at our house.

Great recipe that is easy and quick! I used mac's because they are the apple in season. I believe that you can use any apple that you wish because the filling is cooked, allowing you to control the moisture as well as the sugar. I used only one cup of sugar, which was plenty and passed on the sauce. I suggest to pre-slice the strudel partially as this will help in cutting when complete.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. It is tastier than other strudel recipes that I have made. I only used 1 cup of sugar. I also used half the amount of apples recommended and added about 1 cup of blueberries for something different. It worked very well. This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe is quite simple and tastes delicious. I did not use the berries or the yogurt. However, I did boil the left over sugar/cranberry mix and poured a little bit of the liquid on each strudel before serving.

When working with phyllo, it helps to pre-slice it before baking. That should help prevent it from falling apart when you cut it after baking.

I made this over the weekend exactly as described in the recipe. It was delicious. My husband said it was the best strudel he's ever had. The phyllo was a little difficult to work with, but I also put a damp towel over it while I worked with the other sheets, which seemed to help. I did not put the berries or the yogurt sauce over it, and it was still delicious. It kind of fell apart as I cut it, but it didn't look terrible and tasted great. The leftovers were much easier to cut, so I think it would have held up a little better if I had waited for it to cool longer before cutting it the first time.

i NEVER make desserts so when I presented this with low-fat vanilla yogurt to my family and boyfriend everyone was rather impressed. My trick with phyllo is to leave it under a damp tea towel while you're working with one or two sheets to make it easier to work with. It was a HIT!! I also added a little nutmeg to the apple mix cuz we're big fans.

This is the best low-fat dessert in the world. There is nothing better. :) I made the recipe exactly as written (including the caramel sauce). I sliced it, plated it, and then drizzled the sauce over top. It is delicious!
