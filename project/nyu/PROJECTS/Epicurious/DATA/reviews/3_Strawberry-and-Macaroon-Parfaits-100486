i used low-fat vanilla bean ice cream and used the extra syrup from the starwberry mixture to pour over the ice cream. light and delicious. i wanted seconds...

Too bad that as the first reviewer I made changes but that's how it goes. Had no frozen strawberries in syrup so just sprinkled some extra fine sugar over the sliced berries and refigerated them for an hour or so. A lovely not too heavy dessert, try it.
