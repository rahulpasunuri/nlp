This was EXCELLENT! I added a tad more feta - very very good - you must try!

I will not comment on the filling, since I make mine differently, but I have used the cooking spray trick several times and it works well. Not quite the same as butter, but much faster and less messy.

I was a little worried about making this after the reviews but it turned out great. I agree that the taste isn't strong but it was easy to make and the phyllo dough wasn't hard to work with at all! I would like to experiment to get more flavor but overall I would make it again!

This recipe is pretending to be spanakopita. If you are going to the trouble of cooking with phyllo - you might as well make the original recipe, with lots of cheese and eggs. And eat a smaller portion.

This is for the last reviewer..if they ever come back on to get a response to their question!! The reason why others make suggestions is because they search this site, see the poor reviews, then go to other sites, make a dish, and then come back and recommend the dish to others.I was the one who mentioned the Dobbs Diner version (which by the way is no longer available!!!) I came on this iste first, didn't like the reviews, went on Foodnetwork, tried thier recipe, and decided to come back on to share this with others . That is the purpose of these shared reviews. We are always searching for a new recipe, aren't we???

I don't understand... if you have found the best spanakopita recipe, then why are you looking at other ones?

I haven't made this version of Spanakopita yet, but looking at the reviews, and the recommendation to check out the Dobb's Diner version at the Food network, I have to recommend that while you are there, try Tyler Florence's version of this lovely dish as well. It's incredibly delicious :)

This one needed some help - here's what I did: Increase the oregano to 1 tsp. Add 1 tsp of salt with the spinach Increase the feta to 3-4 oz. I prefer this dish as individual triangles. Defrost the phyllo and bring to room temp. Take one sheet and fold in half like a book. Gently cut each "book" in half - you should have two long strips. Put a spoonful of filling on each strip and fold into triangles. Brush melted butter on top and cook at 400 deg for 10 min.

I've been making spanikopita for years, and I can take one look at this recipe and tell it won't work. One 10-oz. bag spinach? You need to use around 2 or more pounds spinach or the dish is flat. Per readers' suggestions, using puff pastry instead of filo saves time, but is less crunchy and flavorful. Take the time to make it right.

This was terrific, even better than I expected and oh so easy. I followed one reader's suggestions and used puff pastry instead of filo dough and added some lemon juice to the mix. This was as a huge hit at my party!

Bland, I added lemon juice and zest as well as dill and some oregano to give it some flavour.

This was extremely delicious. My mother in law even liked it, and she doesn't like anything I cook! This is a wonderful dish to prepare when entertaining vegetarian friends or family.

As a spanakopita lover who lives in Hania, Crete, Greece, I suggest you try making this dish with fresh spinach (where available) and puff pastry rolled out thinly (one on the bottom and one on the top of the pie filling), instead of using phyllo pastry, which tends to go soggy. Beat an egg, and use a brush to spread it on the top pastry layer, then sprinkle sesame seed and cook till brown.

I really enjoyed this dish. When I make it again, I will probably use more feta and maybe even add a second layer! Also I would suggest making the bottom layer with more than 2 phyllo sheets, since after cooking it became a little soggy. This was my first experience cooking with phyllo and, once it thawed out, it wasn't terribly difficult. Just make sure you follow the package directions for handling.

The filling was great! The feta becomes mild upon cooking (which is good since I don't really like feta). However, in a attempt to brown the phyllo more quickly, I put it under the broiler for a few moments and it caught on fire!! I was able to save part of it and it turned out just fine.

Boy phyllo is hard to work with-- I got quite a work out putting this together, but it was fun. Make sure you don't use mild feta, it wasn't salty enough.

I enjoyed this dish, as did my vegitarian dinner guests. I served it with a greek salad. A little extra feta does go a long way (if you want to cheat on your diet).
