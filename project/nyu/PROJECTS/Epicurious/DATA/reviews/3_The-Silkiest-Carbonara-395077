We cut the recipe in half for all of the ingreds except the pepper! So very hot but still delicious, and really easy. My all-time favorite carbonara is still Jamie Oliver's courgette carbonara, but this was still quite good, being out of zucchini.

I did add garlic and I warmed the entire dish in the skillet to serve it hot. It does take care to serve hot but not overcook the sauce. It is fantastic. The use of mostly yolks produces an exceptionally rich and creamy dish.

I wouldn't say that this recipe is bland, just subtle. You taste each and every ingredient, which is why it's really important to use quality ingredients - especially the eggs. I would make one modification: the recipe recommends that you don't brown the guanciale, but I think the extra caramelization would add wonderful flavor and texture to the dish. And yes, heat your plates :)

I agree with the other reviewers. I was disappointed with the lack of flavor and creaminess. More pancetta and cheese might help, plus the warm bowl.

I thought this was just ok. I made it with pancetta and the flavor was lacking. I agree that you should warm your bowl, it did lose heat immediately. Probably won't make again.

I made this carbonara last week for a quick dinner. It's delicious. The technique is simple and definitely works. I advise using more guanciale (or bacon or pancetta) and using more fat than it suggests. Also, a must is warming the bowls or plate that you serve it on. This got cold (like eggs do) faster than anything, and was much less desirable once cold.
