Yum! We loved it! Added one avocado simply because I had it and it needed to be eaten. It was a marvelous addition! I served the salad slightly warm and the three of us gobbled it up. Will definitely make again and again. Fresh basil a must.

Such a lovely summer meal! I made a 1/2 recipe but used all the dressing. Pan fried the salmon with herbes de provence and some lemon. Used yellow string beans and asparagus. Toasted bread in the oven with olive oil and garlic. Topped the meal with some boursin goat cheese. A definite remake next summer.

This was an awesome easy night dinner which my family LOVED! I usually do not follow a recipe exactly because I like making it my very own. I did not have red onions, but had just picked up some fresh leeks which I used as a replacement, and since they are lighter in flavor I was able to use the directed amount in the salad. I also added some persian cucumbers and substituted pomegranate red wine vinegar. I also liberally seasoned my salmon with dried dill and fresh squeezed lemon. My 5 year old and my 2 year old cleaned their plates of all their food and my husband could not stop saying how delicious this meal was. I will keep this in my rotation for the summer months.

I really liked this recipe although I used less onion the second time. If you're in a rush you can try a quick version that I did the other day with canned salmon and just cutting the baguette in half and toasting it in a toaster oven- almost the same results!

Great! As this was for only two of us, I eyeballed the ingredients according to our appetites-used full amount of dressing. I grilled the salmon, tossed the cherry tomatoes (left whole) and the bread cubes with bit of olive oil and grilled them in a veggie basket. Green beans cooked as suggested,some red onions and the basil completed our dinner salad.

Yummy! I love salmon! Regarding following the recipe, I also halved the onion as other reviewers. And I pan fried the salmon. I think seasoning the salad with enough salt is key. This was a delicious lunch. Very tasty. This is how I like to eat!

Made this last night and it was delicious. A couple of modifications made it even better: macerated the onions in a little vinegar and tsp. of sugar for 20 minutes; grilled the salmon steak on the BBQ, and toasted the outside of the bread by tossing in a little butter and putting in 350 oven for 10 minutes until they were crispy outside, but soft inside. Yummy.

While we really enjoyed this recipe, it might have been nice to use pasta instead of bread, just because my husband and I really like leftovers! Alternatively, we could have left out half the bread for the next day (so it doesn't get soggy). It was definitely delicious, but it didn't blow my mind...And, we also used about half the onion and felt it was adequate.
