Dumping the sauce into the processor, scraping it out of there and into a sieve, and then pressing the mash to extract as much of the sauce as possible resulted in the loss of approx 1/3 of my caramel. The pan, my food processor, and my sieve were all left with a hardened layer of it. In fact, it was hardened enough by the time it got the sieve that I dumped the whole of it back into the pan to return it to a liquid state and then strained it. After adding my orange segments with the juice that came from cutting them, the caramel globbed so I again put the whole thing back in the pan to rewarm in order to incorporate the caramel. In the end, the sauce tasted more like orange than caramel (couldn't really taste the caramel at all) and was very watery, due to the oranges which were VERY juice. Next time, I'll make a caramel sauce with cream (the kind you make to pour over ice cream) and stir in some orange segments with a little bit of orange juice. Boiling the orange slices in the caramel was probably unnecessary. If I want that candied orange flavor, then I'll make candied oranges, chop them small, and stir those into caramel sauce. Or cook them in the caramel and then just pick them out whole. I can think of a ton of ways to make this easier, better-looking, and better-tasting...

When I added the orange-sugar mixture to the caramel -- it seized up and became "concrete" in the saucepan! I salvaged the sauce that hadn't hardened and wound up using it. (But had to soak the pan in hot water overnight to dissolve the crystallized sugar.)
