This had great flavor, but the consistency just wasn't right. Mine seemed almost frothy toward the top. Great recipe for a family meal, but not something I would serve to anyone else.

This recipe is very easy. The creme brulee is among the best I have eaten!

While I thought this was very good and sooo rich and delicious, I will stick with the traditional creme brulee.

This was the first Creme Brulee I tried. It was not too hard and everyone seemed to really like it.

We love cream brulee in our family and this is quite possibly the best I've ever made. This one is definately a keeper!
