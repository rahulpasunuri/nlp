As someone previously wrote this sorbet doesn't freeze. Of course - too much sugar for that amount of water. The recipe calls for 2 cups of water + 1 cup of sugar and then it says that you end up with a quart!!! Water expands with freezing but NOT that much. So the amount of water is wrong. Put more. Look into other sorbet recipes - usually 3/4 cup sugar for approx 3 cups of liquid

Very refreshing. Just the right balance of sweet and tart. A great variation on agua de jamaica.

I used a professional ice cream maker and the consistency came out great. I did not like the amount of sweetness--If I ever make it again, I will recude the sugar to 3/4 cup or less.

I don't know why, but my sorbet would not freeze. I thought that is was the ice cream maker, but it works fine. Even sitting in the freezer, the sorbet never really hardened.
