This is a classic, go=to recipe for frosting. If you are shocked at the amount of butter, I have used Land O'Lakes light butter and acheived great success with it.Never maregine or anything gross like that though! I also will sometimes add 2 Tbs. of Frangelico or Grand Marnier for flavor, or for a berry buttercream, I puree 10 oz. of frozen raspberries, pressed through a fine mesh strainer to remove seeds, and reduce over low heat to 1/2 cup, then add to frosting - excellent pink color and raspberry flavor!

This recipe was the BEST and the easiest to make. I followed it to the letter. I feel that you need to add all of the butter for volume. I also didn't have any trouble with it curdling, but that might be because I used a whisk to whip my meringue. Also, took the advice of another reviewer and created an ice water bath to cool off the meringue. Super easy. NOTE: this was enough icing to ice 2 chocolate 9" round cakes with center filled. But if you also want icing for decorating, you'll need to make another batch or buy store bought (but that would be a shame)

OMG - this icing is amazing! Thanks for the detail about the "soupy look" and the "curdling" because both happened to me when I made it. Cooling the meringue took about 30 minutes vs the 10 minutes indicated in the recipe (I thought my stand mixer was going to burn out on me!)... I finally did the frozen peas trick and wished I started that earlier. But so worth the effort - simply AMAZING!

I have made this recipe dozens of times now and the comments I hear every time are that this is the best buttercream ever. Light and fluffy as can be. It is definitely more difficult to make then most, but if you follow the directions exactly you will love it.

Loved this! First time making this kind of frosting and it turned out wonderfully. Like others,I used a bag of frozen peas and another of frozen corn to cool the meringue after adding the hot syrup. Just held them against the bottom of the mixer bowl. I also stopped at 3.5 sticks of butter. I forgot to add vanilla, but it was still amazingly good. All the guests at the party inhaled their cake.

This was not hard to make but I was shocked about how much butter was required. I just couldn't keep adding it in so I didn't I used 11/4 cups and it worked fine . I actually didn't use this frosting the first time I made the cupcake and I don't know if I would again I like it more sweet less creamy . It is a beautiful frosting but I think I might love it more as a filling .

made a pure buttercream frosting last time...(butter - like 6lbs!, powdered sugar, vanilla, and maybe cream of tartar??? i can't remember)... wanted something just a little lighter this time. Followed these instructions pretty closely - except I don't own a candy thermometer, so I just let it gently boil for 7-8 mins - was in a bit of a hurry, so after I incorporated the syrup, I set the bottom of the bowl in a larger one of cool water to cool it faster. It turned out great! I piped it on top of cupcakes (added a little food coloring) & it was, in fact, much lighter that the last recipe I used. Kind of a yummy blend of buttercream & meringue. The egg whites gave it a nice slightly-glossy finish too, which complimented the sparkly sprinkles :) Not too sweet - not too heavy - was a hit!

Wow, this was a lot more work than just softening up some butter and beating in as much powdered sugar as humanly possible, but the results were proportionate to the effort. The frosting is delicious, not too sugary, and beautifully sleek. I even managed to do some fancy cake decorations with it.

This recipe was a little overly-sweet. I ended up adding extra butter to temper that down.

Wonderful frosting. This was my first time making buttercream using this method, and I did not run into a great deal of problems. I was working in a relatively chilly kitchen (mid-60s), which helped to cool the meringue quickly. The bowl did become too cold while I was adding the butter, so I wrapped a warm moist towel around the bowl, which helped it to regain its smooth consistency. I only used 3 sticks of butter, and I added a tablespoon of cornsyrup to the sugar and water before making the syrup.

I'm not an advanced cook and I avoid fussy recipes. I was apprehensive after reading other reviews but my best friend LOVES buttercream and I wanted to make it for her birthday cake. I followed the instructions exactly and the frosting turned out beautifully! It's so yummy that I had to put down the spatula and back away before I gobbled it all up. A few notes: Temperatures are important but the instructions were spot on for my 68deg kitchen. The amount of syrup is small so you may have to tip your pot to get your candy thermometer to read the temperature like I did. A stand mixer/KitchenAid makes this recipe much much easier. Mine has a metal bowl so the meringue cooled down within 1-2 minutes of the time stated in the recipe. YUM!!

Rating: 3
This is a delicious frosting, but I think the recipe is very wrong about the timing. I used a stand mixer and my egg whites took at least 45 minutes to cool completely. I made two batches and found the timing the same for both. But, I was able to fix a soft frosting pretty easily by holding a couple of bags of frozen peas around the base of the bowl as the mixer whipped. Kinda MacGyver, but it worked! I think with some more practice this recipe will become my go-to frosting.

Rating: 4
This is like any other butter cream I've worked with. It's fluffy, lush, not to sweet and not too buttery. On a side note, don't worry about raw egg whites, that's what cooking the sugar is for, bring it up to such a high temperature ends up pasteurizing the egg white, thus eliminating any potential bacteria (I know this, I'm a pastry cook.) For decorating any "large cake" I would suggest making 1.5x the recipe, just so you have enough for a crumb coating...don't want to have your final product covered in crumbs from faulty icing!

I've never made buttercream frosting before and found this was a snap! don't know why some of the others had issues as I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. It was to be for a lemon cake that is my husband's favorite. Added lemon zest and fresh lemon juice at the end instead of using vanilla. Yummy! Can hardly wait to try a rendition in chocolate!

This turned out really wonderfully for me--sweet but not too sweet, buttery but not too buttery, really beautiful on the cake. (Full disclosure: I used 3.5 sticks of butter, not 4.) Also, I used powdered egg whites to be on the safe side, and they worked like a charm, much to my amazement.

sorry about the double post.

I really screwed this stuff up. I thought I needed to double the recipe, so I doubled the egg whites. I was terrified to over beat them, so I think I didn't beat them enough. After putting my simple syrup with the whites, and starting with the butter, I start thinking...I forgot to double everything else. I added corn syrpu to get the sugar up to speed, then started adding butter. I think it was too warm because it was still soupy. I had to run a child to dance lessons, so I threw the stuff in the fridge, returned from dance, still not firm enough, added another cube of butter, taste is wonderful, just not real firm. I wonder why it didn't work out? It is a good thing I made it for husband, and not a big group. My reputation as a cook would have been ruined. If they only knew.

Ok, I really screwed this up. I figured I needed to double the recipe, so I doubled the egg whites. When I started beating the whites, I was terrified to over beat them, I think I didn't do enough. Then when things didn't look right, I remembered I hadn't doubled anything other than the egg whites. So I added some corn syrup, then pulled out extra butter then got part of that in... still soupy. I then had to take a child to dance lessons. I threw the mess in the fridge, went to dance,got home, still runny, added another cube of butter. a little better. I am glad I only made this for husband and not a crowd. It will be OK, but next time I will have to follow directions. I wonder why it didn't turn out?

Fabulous. Perfect. Dreamy... and then some! I stopped at 3 sticks of butter and half the vanilla and the end result was subtly marshmellowy and totally divine. I will be making it again next weekend. ...I just have to find a better chocolate cake to go with!

Don't worry about getting the sugar syrup to boil all the way. I wasted a lot of time trying to get the temp to 238ºF. When it got to 200º I poured into the egg whites. It did get a little soupy so I put the bowl in ice. It also started to look curdled but just like the recipe says, it came right back. It is the best butter cream recipe I've ever made.

Friends who don't like sweets love the cakes I've made because of the buttercream. A few weeks ago I made the red velvet cupcakes from epicurious, and I used the buttercream from this recipe for them (again, rave reviews for the buttercream). I didn't use all of the buttercream from that batch, and froze it according to the instructions. Used it for the most recent cake, and it was just as good as when first made.

Rating: 4
The recipe worked great for me, although I'm very grateful for everyone's comments. I prepared 1.5 batches, and it was just enough for my 9-inch three-layer cake. I used 5 sticks instead of 6 and it was PLENTY buttery. An ice water bath under the mixing bowl worked great after the butter made it soupy. (My meringue wasn't perfectly cool!) I frosted my cake right away, but I have also been able to used chilled butter cream by mixing it (or whisking it) while moving a blow dryer around the outside of the bowl. Works like a charm!

nxd100 from Oberlin OH is my LIFESAVER!!!! If you have problems with this recipe, listen to her advice. I did and it turned out perfect! I would whisk in the melted buttercream though and not use a mixer (at least that's what I did). I would also have to agree with other reviewers that cutting back on the butter is probably a good idea. I also used the corn syrup suggestion and it worked out well. I would STRONGLY disagree with previous statements about this recipe being along the same lines as a basic confectioners sugar buttercream recipe ... NOT THE CASE AT ALL! This is a more subtle and pleasing recipe, not too sweet. I added lemon juice and zest at the end to complement the lemon cake I was making ... worked out VERY well. A little complicated, but worth the effort!

Rating: 3
This is an excellent recipe, but touchy. I think two key variables are mixer speed and how you add the vanilla. Using a high quality stand mixer can cause overbeating and the meringue to collapse. I had excellent results with no soupiness until the very end, where you add the vanilla and then mix a little longer. At that point the emulsion broke and the frosting curdled. BUT I FIXED IT. I removed 1/4 of the icing and chilled the rest. I melted the smaller portion on the stove. Then I beat the chilled frosting and slowly added the melted portion. The frosting melded and spread beautifully. The same procedure worked perfectly when I went to use my frozen leftovers on a second cake.

I read all of the reviews before trying this vanilla buttercream recipe and I have to admit I was a bit intimidate. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about this recipe was easy and straight forward. I only used 3 cups of butter as others had recommended. For those of you who added the butter to soon. Try testing the temperature of the mixing bowl bottom to determine if the mixture is cool before adding the butter. I great time experimenting with buttercream!

This recipe was a waste of a lot of quality ingredients. I have had delicious results with simple buttercream recipes, but for a special occasion i wanted to step it up with this more complex recipe. The meringue and syrup mixture came out nice and fluffy but the problems began when I added the butter. Even though the meringue mixture was completely cooled, I even stuck it in the fridge for 10 min after beating it, it became soupy when i added the butter. So I put the bowl in some ice water and continued beating in the butter. It thickened up some but the butter never fully incorporated and it looked curdled. The recipe said if this happens just keep going and it will eventually smooth out so I kept on beating. Eventually the butter started clumping together and the meringue turned into a thin liquid. Completely ruined. What could I have done differently?

Rating: 4
I read all the reviews before deciding to make the butter cream. I, like many others had the for a little while a buttery soup because I did not wait long enough for the meringue to cool. To prevent complete disaster I filled a bowl with iced water and put it under the frosting bowl and kept going, sure enough the cooling and added butter helped with the consistency. I stopped at 3 1/2 sticks of butter the frosting turned out delicious and smooth. I will certainly do it again.

I can't figure out what people are doing that makes this not come out. I've never had an issue making buttercream and this is an excellent recipe. I do suggest using European style or fresh butter if you can find it since it is much richer. Really take your time adding the syrup, and like others said, keep beating with the whisk.

Rating: 4
CAUTION: the 4 fork review is for if you are using it immediately. Under those circumstances it is perfection. HOWEVER, if you are storing it in the refrigerator for later use, absolutely DO NOT use an ELECTRIC MIXER to re-blend once it is room temperature again - it will become over-mixed and curdled. HORRIBLE. This went from being the most perfect buttercream I've ever tasted to an utter and humiliating disappointment. I am LIVID.

This recipe did not work out for me. I followed the recipe to the letter. But it just didn't turn out. It started great. I made the syrup, and beat it into the other ingredients. At that point I was very impressed. The mixture cooled perfectly and was light + fluffy. Little did I know how poorly it would turn out. I softened the butter and started adding it in tablespoon pieces like the recipe says. But the butter clumped and would not mix in. The rest of the mixture turned soupy. I would NOT make this recipe again unless I found a better way to stir it the butter.

i made the buttercream with only tsp of sugar in the egg whites and 1 tsp of vanilla, which was perfect for my taste, not too sweet and not too much like a commercial frosting:) but please, everyone, don't go through the trouble of making it in advance!! i made it a day in advance and after letting it soften for 2 hours i tried to whip it up like the cook's note says. it seperated and i had to make it all over again--not fun! otherweise, it tastes AMAZING, especially with chocolate, no matter if cupcake or cake!:)

I made this recipe to go on vanilla cupcakes. I found that 3 sticks of butter was adequate and stopped there. For a variation and to have a contrast of flavors with the vanilla cake, I got dried blueberries for 1 batch, and dried strawberries/ cherries in another batch. I poured a little hot water over each and 1 tablespoon of natural, organic, alcohol free flavor concentrate ( blueberry and raspberry). I let it sit overnight and minced the next day in my mini prep. I divided the frosting in half and beat in 2- 3 tablespoons in each batch. Perfect fruity and buttery frosting on the vanilla cupcakes. They were heavenly! This is an excellent professional grade buttercream recipe I will make again. But I hold the line at 3 sticks of butter!

The frosting is very buttery and not too sweet as others have mentioned.

This was one of the best buttercreams I've ever tasted. My family loved it. I didn't think it tasted too buttery. It wasn't as firm as I had hoped despite putting it in the refrigerator for almost an hour and whipping again before use. I was real careful to get the meringue to a cool temperature before slowly adding the softened butter a tablespoon at a time.

I made this last night in advance for my daughter's birthday party next weekend. It was pretty easy, though I think maybe they should tell you to pour the hot sugar mixture in an EXTREMELY SLOW manner into the meringue. I called myself going slowly, but because of the heat (I think) it got really soupy and slopped everywhere if I ran the mixer on "high". As a matter of fact, I was forced into putting it on the lowest setting and gradually moving it higher as it cooled. Still, it turned out GREAT and it is so wonderfully dreamy. I'm going to have to make the batch again, though...thought I could color it purple to match the party's decor, but did anyone know that blue + red food coloring = a grayish color? Clearly I did something wrong there! The 2nd batch will remain in its natural state and I'm going to use colored sugar and sprinkles. :D

unbelievable! so incredibly good. i used it on some chocolate cupcakes i made. i may have over beaten it because all the butter curdled at the end. even though the recipe said so, it still didn't smooth out. so i heated it up just a little and blended again. after sitting in the fridge for a bit, it all reconstituted and was fantastic. the taste is exactly what i like in a frosting. flavorful and buttery. mmmmmmmmmmmmm

I made this last night and it was so much easier than I thought it would be! It is definitely buttery but oh sooooo good. I couldn't stop licking my fingers once it was done. I added the corn syrup to the sugar water and had no problems with it crystallizing. Next time I am going to try doubling this recipe. I barely had enough for my 9-inch 4-layer cake. I probably used too much in the filling though. Does anyone know the difference in taste between this BC and the swiss meringue BC?

This buttercream was wonderful. I was a bit intimidated by the recipe because sugar syrups and egg whites can both be tricky, but it turned out perfectly on the first try. My guests all raved about it. I do suspect that it wouldn't go over well with kids, since it is not so sweet compared to jarred frosting or commercial bakery frosting. I myself spent most of my life thinking that the only way to make buttercream was with butter, powdered sugar, milk and vanilla. What a differnce!

Rating: 4
OK, you won't like this if you don't like a rich, buttery taste to your frosting, but that does NOT mean it's a bad recipe. I love it. As another review noted, add some corn syrup to the sugar to stop it from crystalizing. It is light, fluffy, and very buttery- you cannot get this texture and taste combination any other way. I only use 1 tsp vanilla, and find that is plenty.

I am a professional pastry chef and this is my favorite buttercream recipe ever! It breaks my heart to see a low review on this recipe, because it is superb. I think some of the negative reviewers must be comparing the taste of this recipe with what a super market bakery calls buttercream- that overly sweet, shortening stuff. This one is perfectly creamy and flavorful, and not too sweet. You may want to add a tablespoon of corn syrup to the water and sugar mixture before boiling (this will keep sugar from crystalizing). If your buttercream "breaks" when re-whipping after refrigeration and thawing, it's either too cool, or too warm to emulsify. Try putting it back in the fridge and let it cool again, then bring it to room temp and whip again, and if that doesn't work, try putting a warm towel around the bowl of the mixer to soften the buttercream then whip. Even if it looks bad, it is not ruined... just have to get it back to right temp to whip. Make sure when you eat it, it is at room temperature! Will keep using this one!!!

The icing was perfect, white, and not too sweet. It did not taste too "buttery" at all. A reviewer said the buttercream frosting needed a lot of air incorporated into it, so I mixed the butter in small batches thoroughly and at higher speeds than recipe called for. Came out perfectly!

Would warn anyone trying to make this frosting to NOT over beat it. I made it one day in advance and followed the recipe exactly. It looked nice enough but I agree, tasted like butter. I put it in the fridge and took it out 3 hrs in advance of when I wanted it. After 2.5 hours, it seemed to be at room temp so I used my electric beater and started whipping it only to have it separate into butter and syrup layers - what a waste!! We had no frosting for the cake...

This is an almost perfect recipe. In a cake decorating class I took a couple of years ago, I was taught to not use a full 2 cups of butter for this recipe. Instead, use 1 cup of butter (for flavour), 1/2 cup of margarine and 1/2 cup of vegetable shortening. Each of the fats melts at a different temperature with butter being the quickest to melt. By adding the other two fats, you give the icing more stability and it lessens the intensity of the taste of the butter which can distract from your cake. This icing is wonderful to work with although it takes a little longer to prepare than plain old icing sugar, butter and milk-type recipes. It has a great mouth-feel without being too sweet.

Just a point of order... this is technically "Italian meringue buttercream" because it's made with cooked syrup and egg whites. Classic buttercream is made with egg yolks. As you can imagine, classic buttercream has a deeper yellow color. It's nice to know how to make both types since you always wind up with extra yolks or whites at the end of any cake recipe. If you're really concerned about salmonella, find a "swiss meringue buttercream" recipe instead of using this recipe with powdered egg whites.
