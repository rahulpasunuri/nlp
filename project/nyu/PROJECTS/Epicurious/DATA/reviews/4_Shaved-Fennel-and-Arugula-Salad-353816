This is my new "go-to" salad. It is easy and sophisticated, and my husband and any dinner guests that we ever have love it. I would recommend grilling or sauteeing the fennel!

Really delicious. Making this made me realise I was in a rut with mesclun, and I resolved to make more of an effort with green salads.

This was delicious.I had arugula and fennel from my CSA and olives and Parmesan left over from a party so it was the perfect way to use them all.

Delicious and refreshing salad though I made one significant change that my guests loved - substituted the olives for sliced strawberries with great results. The strawberries also added a lovely color to the salad.

Absolutely loved it, so refreshing. Used kalamata olives, regular - not the oil-cured ones. Didn't have anchovy paste but imagine it's even better with that. The cheese really made a difference - used only 1/2 cup (trying to reduce the fat I'm eating) and it complemented the flavors really well.

Very nice. A local restaurant serves a similar salad with poached artichoke hearts that my wife and I love. Modifications: use only 1/4 cup of oil and still felt like I had extra dressing left over (5oz of arugula is a sizeable container's worth). I also used less than the recommended parmesan. Even with the witholdings, it was filling. This is a definite repeat dish - the lemon juice really places well against the olive oil. 1 teaspoon of anchovy paste is the perfect amount.

I was initially unsure about this salad ... seemed way too easy/basic. However all I can say is "Wow". Company picked at the leftovers after dinner until there was nothing left. I actually skipped the olives ...don't stinge on the parmesan.

Unbelievably delicious salad: great mix of textures, flavors, sweet-and-salty. We mowed down a huge bowl last night, to raves, and tonight I am eating the leftovers (and let's agree that salad leftovers are not anything to write home about) with as much gusto as last night. Fabulous recipe, just as is.

Simple recipe, easy to make. My guests loved it and it was all gone at the end. Had I made more it would have been eaten ( had six people). Will definitely make it again! Refreshing. Used pitted Kalmata olives that were not oil cured.

The Parmesan shavings really make this salad. I used the lemon zest before juicing the lemons and really liked the extra lemon kick. I made it with and without the oil-cured olives and decided I like it better without. I'm so happy I made this simple salad which somehow results in the whole being greater than the sum of the parts. Delicious and sophisticated and I'm cravng it again already.

Easy salad, quick and light. I cut down a bit on the parmesan, but it definitely gives needed saltiness to the greens. Perfect addition to a hearty sandwich night, like a side to a panini or grilled roast beef dip.

Wow - great salad. I was a bit apprehensive having never used shaved fennel before, but everyone raved and had seconds. I used Asiago instead of Parmesan.
