This was a great dessert--I heard lots of "mmmm" as people were eating it. I'm not sure how well the cake works alone, but as the base for the ice cream and butterscotch, it's yummy. The coffee ice cream (not a flavor I usually go for) was the perfect foil to the chocolate.

The butterscotch was great but the cake was very dry. Next time, I'll try a shorter baking time.

Maybe it's me. I was expecting a "brownie-like"texture(as shown in photo) and got a cakey texture. Cooked faster than recipe. Didn't "fall" in center, just got a little lower.

I made this for my then-boyfriend's birthday and he proposed that very day. Ok, maybe it wasn't the recipe but it's worth a try. I've used the butterscotch sauce as an ice cream topping too.

My friend Bethany prepared this for Superbowl Sunday.She's known for her brownie recipes but this surpassed them all! Fabulous chocolate cake. The deeply intense flavor lingered.Easy too!

Decadent, but worth the extra time at the gym afterwords!
