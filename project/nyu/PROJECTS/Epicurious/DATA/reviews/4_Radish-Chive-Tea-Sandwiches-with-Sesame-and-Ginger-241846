I made these 2 nights in a row just for my husband and I to nibble on with drinks before dinner. The flavour combination is delicious. My kids don't like radishes so I just buttered some baguette for them with the sesame butter and they loved it.

I loved this recipe. The flavors meld perfectly, it's easy to make, especially if you have a mandolin to slice the radishes, and it looks gorgeous. I found beauty heart radishes, which made them even prettier.

oh, so yummy. We just bought radishes at the first farmer's market of the season. These would be a great first course for vegetarian guests.

Good oriental flavor, and a nice change from the usual cucumber tea sandwiches. They looked nice sprinkled with black sesame seeds.

These were delicious. Don't put the salt on until ready to serve. the radishes "sweated" and I had to dab the excess water off of them. Still, a great finger food

I made these for a baby shower to rave reviews. It has a great modern flavour. I love these delicate little tea sandwiches and wish I had a reason to make them more often.

These sandwiches were a hit when I brought them to a potluck luncheon. Changes I made: I added more chives, doubled the sesame oil, and used 1 tsp of ginger. Definitely a little salt atop the radish slices adds to the flavor as well. Prior to these changes, I found the mixture a little bland.

Crunchy and soft with a great zing of flavor.
