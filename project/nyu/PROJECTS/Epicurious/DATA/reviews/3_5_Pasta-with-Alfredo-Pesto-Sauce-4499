The sauce was simple and yummy. I followed recipe with regards to the measurements of the ingredients, but I replaced two tablespoons of the olive oil w/ melted butter.I love butter, lol. I also followed another suggestion to toast the pine nuts. Instead of spaghetti, I paired the sauce with salmon and ravioli filled w/ ricotta. So good!

Made per directions substituting Pecorino Romano for the cheese and penne for the pasta. We added 8 oz smoked ( flaked) salmon at the end which was an incredible pairing. It made very easy and very tasty weeknight meal!

This dish with a few adjustments, is wonderful! First off, if you're not a fan of rich creamy pasta dishes, this is not for you. In contrast, I love creamy dishes. I recommend cutting back on the olive oil as other people have suggested. In the pesto mixture, I added an extra clove of garlic or two. Prior to boiling the heavy cream, I cut slithers of onions and sun dried tomatoes and fried it with a bit of olive oil, and added a dash of white wine (I took this recommendation from a reviewer before me). I also boiled the double cream with added black pepper. This combination was to die for!

To those who said it was a little bland, try adding a little salt to taste. It sounds dumb, but pesto tends to taste really bland to me (I usually don't add much salt to my foods at all), and invariably add salt. To those who are using 1/2 & 1/2 or non-fat milk- it's alfredo! I understand if we aren't making alfredo in the traditional Italian style, but any Alfredo in the Italian-American tradition is very rich, very fattening, and uses whipping cream- nothing lighter!

good but don't put in more than the needed amount of oil. tastes really good with salmon chunks mixed in

Why do so many non- Italians (or is it just Americans) believe that the so-called "Alfredo" sauce is made with cream? It is triplo burro (triple butter) with Parmigiano (NOT parmesan). That's it. Simplicity.

Finally! an amazingly easy and spectacular Alfredo Sauce!! One less jar to have to buy premade. I used 1/2 the whipping cream and omitted the basil and nuts last time we had it, served up with Fettucinni noodles and a pan of crushed garlic and pan-fried shrimp...so so good.

Very good. I used half and half instead of cream and bow tie pasta it was perfect. Lots of flavor and the presentation was great. This seems to be a very versitile recipe...next time I will try it with shrimp and evaporated skim milk.

This is very easy but it has VERY LITTLE FLAVOR. The pasta sucks up all the sauce so it just coats it and leaves nothing extra. I would never make this again.

I roasted the garlic and toasted the pine nuts. Diced an onion and cooked in a little butter until clear, added just a splash of white wine and then the cream. Tossed together with the pasta and some grilled chicken it made a great dinner. Very rich, I may try half and half next time but everyone really enjoyed it.

This is such a good sauce, so fast and so easy to make! Far better in fact than many pasta sauces I've had at certain famous restaurants. I didn't have all of the ingredients in my kitchen when I prepared it, so I altered the recipe somewhat and it was still delicious : I used sliced almonds instead of pine nuts, fresh parsley and a little dried basil and Italian seasoning, no cloves (I didn't have any), and a little garlic salt. The result was quite impressive and beautiful! I'll make it again for sure.

3.5 stars...easy and very tasty. I like to add chicken or shrimp sauteed in olive oil. Don't forget to lightly toast the nuts. I find Penne works the best among the pastas.

I made this recipe in a flash using purchased pesto from our local bread and circus. I also used fat free half and half and added garlic chicken sausage. All five of my kids devoured it-a definate add to our rotation.

I have to admit I completely cheated on this recipe - purchased Classico pesto, and evaporated skim milk w/ a bit of flour to thicken. But it's so good! Add whole wheat pasta and a salad and you have low-fat, high fiber decadence. Yum.

As recommended, I used part fat-free half and half and it worked out fine. I also toasted the pine nuts before making the pesto. And I didn't add the garlic to the pesto, rather cooked it in a little butter before adding the cream, etc for the sauce. And I used 1/2 cup parm in the pesto but finished the sauce with 1/2 cup Asiago and added cooked chicken. It was tasty, but didn't reheat well at all (the oil in the pesto separates from the cream - yuck).

This recipe was really good and rich, so rich and heavy that I am not sure I could make it again. I made it for a meal serving 50 people, and it did go pretty fast. It needed a little more umph though.

This dish is a million times better if you roast a whole head of garlic and toast the pinenuts. I also added a dash of red pepper flakes. This dish is enjoyed at least 2 or 3 times a month! Great flavor!!

Havn't made the recipe yet, but I was just reading about the clumpy sauce gal. I'm pretty sure it's the curse of the homemade, but I've used a roux made of butter and cornstarch (arrowroot works too)instead of flour to start my alfredo off and it seems to smooth it out a bit more. Hope it helps, and good luck!!

I thought this was fabulous sauce. I used it with wide egg noodles. Italian sausage and pea's. I also added a bit of red pepper flakes to the sauce. Yums the word.

Really nice dish. A nice combination of Alfredo and Pesto. I used fettuccine, and perhaps it could handle a little more garlic and pine nuts. Overall it was fantastic.

Rating: 4
This dish is AMAZING! My boyfriend and I could not get over how good it still tasted when we tried the fat-free half and half (not as thick and creamy but worth giving up to save on fat). I recommend adding salt and pepper in the end. Also, good Parmesan or Romano is key.

Rating: 3
Great sauce! Great recipe! Very rich too!!! I used less basil, half of the Parmesan, and instead of the spaghetti or the capellini, I used wide noodles. I added 1/4 teaspoon of ground black pepper. Next time I will use fat free half and half to cut on the calories (and on the guiltiness).

I've made this 2 times now, and it's pretty good, and my boyfriend loves it too. I only have one question - how in the world do keep the sauce creamy? Both times I've made this, the sauce became clumpy, even though I added the cheese as slowly as I possible could. Please help!!!

As suggested, I substituted Romano instead of Parmesan, and I added Grilled chicken. Instead of Spaghetti, I made fresh fetticini, which IMO worked well w/ the dish. Overall, good. I would add peas or red pepper at the to give a good color to the dish.

I make this dish on a regular basis for about 3 years-- no leftovers ever make it to the fridge. My only advice is to use very, very finely grated parmesan cheese, and add it gradually, stirring regularly. This will prevent the cheese from becoming stringy or clumpy, and make the sauce creamier and more flavorful. I add grilled chicken to make it a one-dish meal.

I doubled the amount of garlic & used fat free half & half (Land O Lakes) instead of whipping cream. I then served the sauce over herbed chicken tortellini...easy to make & tasted great!

This would be much better with pecarino romano cheese. Parmesan is much too subtle.

The dish was a success! I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved it. Following the advice in one review, I added toasted pine nuts as a garnish, they were the perfect finishing touch. I also added a bit of nutmeg to the cream sauce. Wonderful!

This has become a favorite in our house. I double the garlic and put a heaping 1/2 cup of Parmesan in the pesto. I don't put the Parmesan in the pasta afterwards because it tends to make it stringy. I also double the amount of cream because we like things a little creamier -- but use half n half. This recipe also tastes great with the addition of chicken and broccoli sauteed in garlic/olive oil. YUM!

This recipe was quick and easy! I decided I didn't want to make it so rich and creamy, so I eliminated the cream altogether. I used 3 cloves of garlic and pine nuts. I used ~1/2 c. parmesan and 1/4 c. romano. For the pasta, I used fresh angle-hair. I also added a touch more olive oil since I didn't use the cream. It was terrific -- the family loved it! I plan to make it again for an upcoming Italian potluck party!

This recipe is very good (and rich!) and has drawn raves from my guests, but I think the pesto proportions should be changed. I increased the basil to 1 1/2 cups, used 6 garlic cloves and toasted the pine nuts before processing.

Whoa! What a disappointment. Followed directions explicitly, but the campellini soaked up the sauce immediately then turned dry. It was unappealing. Either too little sauce or something went wrong, but I haven't figured it out yet. Will not try again.

Great as a side dish with grilled chicken and a simple salad. My guests loved it.

I give this recipe a lower score only because I think I did something wrong...like perhaps added too much parmesean cheese to the cream sauce. The result was clumpy, not creamy. However, my very polite dinner guest loved the flavour, and I think I will make it again to see if I can improve. I'd recommend giving it a try, because when using store-bought pesto, it's almost too easy!

Make a low fat version by using Evaporated milk instead of Whipping Cream. I did it this way, and it came out great. Very Easy, a good recipe for unexpected guests. Keep a tube of premade Pesto, available in the supermarket, in the fridge, and it is even simpler.
