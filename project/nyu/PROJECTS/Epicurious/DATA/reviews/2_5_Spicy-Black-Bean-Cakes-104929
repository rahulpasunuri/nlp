I have read coments on a couple of Black Bean Cake recipes here. Tried this one and it was average at best. In all, people seem a bit disapointed. Check out Epicurious Recipe for "Jerk Pork On Red Pepper Mayo and Black Eyed Pea Cakes". Seems to me you could sub Black beans, add chiles, cilantro and s.w. seasoning and come up with a good black bean cake that will hold together and not be bland.

This recipe took a *lot* of work to make it right. Without modification, it's a bland, gritty and difficult dish to make. I changed several things and had good results. 1. Added red onions and additional spicy peppers. 2. I pulse chopped these in my food processor, after which I added the beans. 3. Even with a rough chop, the mixture was very runny. I tried corn flour, but that left the mixture very gritty. I settled on panko and additional egg. This created the perfect consistency. 4. In addition to cumin, I added ground chipotle and ancho powders. 5. I did not coat the balls/patties prior to cooking. The panko was enough. I served with the sour cream (with a hint of lime), and also a apricot/ginger sauce. Guests loved it.

With black beans as the main ingredient( which are bland in themselves) I give it 3 stars and would make again. The cakes on their own are decent. However, I topped the cakes with guacamole and a spicy tomato salsa. It was the combination of all three that I found to make this recipe work. Added some lime zest to cakes as I was using one for the guacalmole.

I thought this recipe was a good base. I totally agree with the modifications suggested by A Cook from Portsmouth and the comments to use fine corn flour rather than cornmeal. These cakes are not best as a showpiece/statement dish, but best as a support dish in a buffet, etc. or as a sandwich patty, as others have suggested.

Terrible, only can say how terrible this was, tried various ideas to season it but was just awful and tasteless....

I have tried making bean cakes before and they have never turned out well. These worked better than other recipes that I have tried, though I agree they need a punch of flavour. I will also try using masa harina for coating, as suggested above, because I found that the cornmeal coating made them too gritty. Mine held their shape well after I had made a few of them - the first few did fall apart a bit. Letting it rest for a while before trying to shape them may have helped.

I changed this a lot but really liked it. I added half a red onion, diced, and I sauteed that for about a minute with the diced red pepper, jalepeno, garlic, and cumin. I also used leftover black beans that I'd made from scratch (from dried beans). And I used one small grated sweet potato. I omitted the cornmeal just mixed in some flour instead to thicken the cakes. Instead of frying, I put them on an oiled baking sheet and broiled them for about 5 minutes per side. I served them on bread with lime mayonnaise, cheddar cheese and pickles. They were even better the next day without the condiments. I think it would be good as written with the addition of the sweet potato.

i thought this recipe was quite easy to prepare but the end results was horrible boring. I had to add lots of salt and an extra egg to keep them together. Iwould never use this recipes again.

These were a bit bland with the original recipe. They need a lot of salt and seasoning. I also added some grated mexican mix cheese. They tasted much better. I also added some italian bread crumbs to the mix to make the cakes for better.

These are quite tasty, and when made the right size can be a suitable replacement for a burger. I modified the recipe a bit, replacing the cornmeal with masa harina and reducing the amount of onion. This had the advantage of stiffening the dough a smidge so I didn't need the egg. I've also experimented with replacing some of the beans with drained hominy/pozole, which worked brilliantly.

Although I enjoyed the black bean cakes, I felt that they left something to be desired. The mixture was initially too runny to form into cakes, so I had to add more cornmeal. The cakes pair well with rice, soup, and/or salad. I will make this recipe again with some modifications.

I made these last night for Mother's Day dinner and everyone loved them. After a few cakes the coating process became much easier. I served them with spicy shrimp & scallops. Great recipe!

I also used refried beans instead of black beans,and added 1/4 cup of corn meal and 1/4 cup of homemade bread crumbs so it wasn't so runny. I fried one in peanut oil and tried broiling one. The fried one was good and crunchy on the outside. Delicious!

I thought these were so-so, even after taking Portsmouth's suggestions and also adding salt. I dreged mine in flour, and perhaps this is why the result was somewhat dry despite the rather wet mixture. No problems with them breaking up though. I also added extra jalepeno. Just wasn't as tasty as I'd imagined it might be. I might make up my own recipe next time instead. I served them with a kicked up version of soft beef tacos from this site- the sauce from that made the cakes juicier and spicier.

I had problems forming the cakes eventhough I added more cornmeal and some breadcrumbs. My family and I really loved the end the result, but my guests did not. In fact, they looked at me as if I had fed them poison! Make sure you have something "normal" on the side to serve picky eaters! I served these with guacamole and sour cream. :o)

2 forks for the initial taste test. Here's how I changed it and made it delicious. I used 2 cans refried beans (black beans weren't available) I cooked the pepper, oion and 1 clove garlic with salt, pepper, and a dash of white rice vinegar.Used about 2 pinches cumin and a sprinkling of chili powder instead of 2tsp cumin (that's way too much in my opinion) and used crushed red pepper flakes for and added kick. I did have to use more bread crumbs than called for and dredged the cakes in corn flake crumbs. Fried and topped with fire roasted salsa and sour cream. This was fabulous! Let me know how you like it. musicboxsh@webtv.net

These were good, much preferred to the other black bean cake recipe on this site. I did use bread crumbs instead of cornmeal in the cakes (not for the coating) and also chilled the mix both before and after making the cakes. Also getting your hands dirty in shaping the patties is essential - otherwise I can see where they might not hold together. A tasty way to use black beans instead of the usual soup or side dish.

Although the recipe looked good, and the cakes turned out well, they were overwhelmingly bland. Even good homemade salsa couldn't save them. Maybe it was my beans, but I thought the recipe could have used some salt in addition to an increase of other spices. Overall, I was very disappointed.

With some of my favorite ingredients - how could it not be tasty! However, I agree with previous reviewers, it doesn't quite have the right "tang" as it currently stands -- I'll definitely add more spices next time and double the jalapeno (no need to remove the seeds!). I also had trouble making the cakes "stick"; half of them broke. Next time I'll use much finer cornmeal for coating. In spite of all this, my guests liked them! We used a fairly spicy salsa as topping.

very tasty but i had trouble with them breaking up while cooking them. refrigerating them first made it easier to scoop and roll in the cornmeal

I liked this recipe because you don't need six thousand gadgets to make it and the ingredients are easy to find. I'd like to try to put a cube of jalepeno/jack cheese in the center next time, hopefully that will be good.

half the recipe makes much more than 18 cakes,and cooking time is no more than 3 minutes per side. needs spicing up. my suggestion would be more cumin, more jalapeno,and chili powder.
