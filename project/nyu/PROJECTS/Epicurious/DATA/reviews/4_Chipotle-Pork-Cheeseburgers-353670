Overall, very good....the chipolte, avocado and cheese make the dish and would work with turkey as well. Couldn't find the tomatillos so I used Salsa Verde and while good, it really needs the tomatillos. I was hesitate to use too much of the chipolte as it can be very spicy, but next time I will use a little more, as the pork absorbs the flavor.

Hello everybody. This is one of the best I've ever tried!! Before this all my burguers were so boring.

What a terrific change from the usual burger. I used extra garlic and peppers, plus I made the burgers bigger for my family. So juicy and flavorful. I couldn't find a large tomatillo so I used an heirloom tomato. I also made a mayo with lime, chipolte and cilantro. Really delicious

Very nice change from beef, not at all difficult to make. I make a cilantro lime mayo and kick up the chipotle in adobo as well as adding a little more salt. I will make these again and again!!!

I tripled the amount of chipotle. Also used a little Baconnaise with the Mayo. Definately a new family favorite and with the prices of beef increasingly higher and higher....

Maybe the Muenster cheese makes it, as it was the only ingredient I substituted (for white cheddar), and I thought it was good, not spectacular. The pork was juicy and tasty, but as a whole burger I wish it had just a little more "something". Like I said, maybe that "something" was the Muenster. I might make it again, and if I do, I'd probably make a chipotle mayo as some others did, and use the right cheese. I thought this was good enough to recommend, just not a 4-forker for me.

Wow! These were so flavorful, a nice change from beef. I might add a bit more adobo next time. I used onion hamburger buns, and instead of plain mayo I added garlic, cilantro, lime and a bit of the adobo sauce. Instead of tomatillo's I sliced green heirloom tomatoes sprinkled with coarse salt. I will definitely make these again, and again!

Substituted ground turkey breast...still delicious!

Yah-huh. Just add bacon.

This is a great summer burger and a nice break from beef. While I can't find chopotle in adobo in my local grocery story, seasoning the meat with chipotle and adobo seasoning works well. And while the recipe recommends "not lean" meat, we used 90/10 and the burgers were great!

I liked them...however I did find them a little on the bland side. Next time I will add more of the chipotle in adobo and then add an extra layer with some chipotle chili powder. I did serve them with some chipotle mayonnaise (I just added some diced chilies and adobo to the mayo). When I make them again I will also cook them over a charcoal or wood fire to get some more smoke flavor. The avocado, cilantro and tomatillo made them luscious. All in all a good burger.

This was the simplest "gourmet" burger I've ever done. Perfect taste! This is a great treat with little effort. Loved it!

I followed the recipe mostly, but added more adobo sauce and mashed the avocado/diced tomatillo together for a topping. I wasn't sure how a pork burger would taste but it was very good.

I couldn't find ground pork at my local butcher, and made it with a mix of veal, pork, and beef and it still tasted amazing. Make sure you have a sizable bun to keep this burger contained. All those creamy toppings make the burger a little slippery!

This was an awesome summer grilling recipe. Easy, but delicious, with the perfect amount of heat from the chipotle. The only thing I missed was a creamy sauce, but it's possible I just needed a little more mayo. You will not regret making this. It's just YUM.

Very good burger. I think the chipotle would work great with ground beef as well. Cilantro and avocado really make it great.

I found this recipe on my iphone app, after just a small search. I wasn't looking to make anything like this, but I thought I'd give a look. I've never had a pork burger before, nor eaten some of the listed ingredients, like muenster cheese, or tomatillo. But after reading the many positive reviews, I thought I would give it a try. I just finished making the best burger ever. This burger is full of flavor! Unfortunatly I didn't have a grill, and I wish I did, because cooked on the stove makes them come out a little oily. maybe next time i'll pull out the foreman or something. The only change I made to this recipe is adding bacon. Bacon makes everything taste great, but this burger probably could have held its own without the bacon. I also added a little more chipotle and adobo. Overall, this burger is a winner.

Rating: 4
Fantastic combination of flavours! We couldn't find Muenster, so substituted with thinly sliced Camembert instead. I threw some sage into the ground meat, and I couldn't resist adding crispy bacon to the topping (hey.. "in for a penny," as they say :D) We'll definitely be making these again, quite possibly the best burgers I've ever tried.

Rating: 4
Adapts perfectly to 6-8 slider-size burgers, and the smaller size definitely keeps the pork moist since it doesn't have to cook as long. Love the thinly sliced tomatillo!

Made this a dozen times. Have not changed a thing. This is truly a great burger, excellent change from "the usual". Nice heat, texture and flavor. If in doubt....do this one, you will not regret a thing.

A delicious change from hamburgers. A great way to crank up a cook out! Next time I will put more chipotle and adobe and I may use a yellow tomato instead of the tomatillo. I found the tomatillo to be bland. Probably just a bum tomatillo.

Rating: 4
I forgot how good Muenster is! I'm not a big beef burger fan so loved the pork - not as heavy as beef - a more delicate flavor and texture. I made them exactly as recipe stated. Next time, I will borrow from another reviewer and mix the avocado, mayo, tomatillo and cilantro together as a topping. I loved the crunchiness of the tomatillo. A nice, clean taste.

Rating: 1
Well this recipe taught me that I cannot stand the texture of ground pork on its own (without being mixed with ground beef like you often see in burger/meatloaf recipes). Gross. It might be OK with ground turkey, but we're just talking about adding chipotle to a burger, nothing terribly interesting even with the toppings.

Rating: 4
My husband has developed an allergy to ground beef or even buffalo, so this recipe was a blessing to find. Even the traditional beef burger fans in our family just love these that I have made twice now. The Muenster cheese is important. The second time, I doubled the chipotle and adobo with superior results. They are so delicious!! I use a charcoal grill and serve with potato salad, fresh corn on the cob and spring greens.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent recipe. The only substitution I made was ground turkey. I'm not against pork, it's just what I had on hand. But all the other ingredients added up to one incredible burger!

Rating: 4
This burger was a nice change from the usual beef burger. I made this one as indicated but I forgot the salt and it was definately lacking. The chipolte in adobo can taste tinny if from a can so I imagine the salt would have balanced this out. I also used regular tomatoes and made a cilantro mayo instead of using springs of cilantro. Be careful not to overcook these guys or you will get solid hockey pucks.

Rating: 3
yum - like others, I made slight changes. Didn't have muenster, used cheddar. Used chipotle slider buns (Companion bakery, St. Louis MO)from my CSA! Mashed avocado and mixed with (a little less)mayonaise and cilantro and a squeeze of lime juice. Looking forward to making again. Might add a bit more chipotle and adobo as I didn't measure last time and didn't seem as spicy as I expected.

Rating: 4
So worth the extra effort to make a special "burger" for the family! My three year old son LOVED this; the amount of chipotle called for warms the meat and adds great flavor. But it isn't unbearably "spicy" for young palates. Took this poolside. For ease in preparation, I combined the mayo, avocado, tomatillos (I chopped them) and cilantro into a nice chunky topping. Delicious! Don't forget to toast your buns! Fabulous recipe!

Great recipe! Very delish. The whole family enjoyed them. Made some substitutions though, instead of the ground pork i used ground chicken and instead of mayo on the buns i used mexican sour cream. Defenetly making them again.

My 18 year old son enjoyed this, but I didn't much care for it. Tasted like a sausage burger, and an average one at that. Part of my criticism of this burger stems from the fact that if I am going to eat that much fat in a meal it needs to be really special, and this just wasn't.

I didn't have tomatillos or Muenster on hand, but used Monterrey Jack and this was a delicious burger. Four forks up!

Really good! The first time I made them I followed the directions to the letter. Everyone in my family loved the results. A couple of thoughts: pork burgers hold up better on the grill if you chill them after forming the patties. Place them on a plate and cover with wax paper in fridge for at least an hour. Also, when I lived in Cincinnati there was a dive that served pork burgers topped with ham and bacon. I think they called it "The 3 Little Pigs"! Yum.... They don't call it Porkopolis for nothing!

I was not a fan at all. I threw them out. I followed the recipe exactly so I think I did everything right.Maybe a slightly more lean pork and some other flavors/spices in addition to the garlic/chipotle would help.

Truly exceptional. If you're not raving, maybe you made them wrong? I crushed and hand minced the garlic, put on potato rolls as sliders, skipped the mayo, and served at a large party of picky gormands. Rave reviews.

it was a nice alternative to beef or turkey burgers. the amount of chipotle can be changed according to taste. we too made guacamole and spread it on top of the burgers. it was tasty.

Not at all what others had raved about. It was quite spicy and we like spicy food, all you could taste was the chipolte. I won't make this again

Really good. Was a bit concerned that they might be too spicy for the husband - but he liked them ok (although he thought they needed ketchup). At first bite, I didn't know what to think (it looks like a burger but doesn't taste like a typical burger) but after a couple of bites the complexity really shines through. I'll make again.

Really great recipe! I sadly couldn't find any Ground Pork at the Grocery store, so I just bought some pork and we ground it up at home with the Meat Grinder.... Also instead of topping the burger with Cilantro Sprigs...I just chopped up some Cilantro and Green Onion and added that into the Ground Pork Mixture. Overall this recipe was really good and we will definitly be making these again.

"The Best Burger I Ever Had" said a stranger who wandered into our tailgate area as I was serving these bad boys! And they were! I added a chili lime mayo to dress these (Mayo, chili sauce, lime juice garlic and cilantro) and they couldn't have been better. I served them as sliders on mini potato rolls and they were a tremendous success! This recepie immediatly went into my book of go-to recepies. Amazing!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was a winner. Although I don't know where you find a "large (1/4#!) tomatillo; I ended up slicing up about 6 of the usual-sized ones. A great alternative burger option for the summer.

I'm going to get slammed for this (for too many substitutions), but ... my local market didn't have ground pork, so I used good fatty ground beef (80/20) and didn't have tomatillo, either, so I skipped it. Used cheddar instead of muenster because that's what I had. (I know, I know, too many substitutions) However, the chipotle and garlic combination of flavors mixed in to the burger were SO delicious that I give this 4 forks with no hesitation. So, later in the summer when I have a tomatillo from the garden and I can get ground pork from a different market, I'll make it again. In the meantime, though, I might just make it with beef again. Ooh, or maybe with ground turkey.
