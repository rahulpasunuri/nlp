Wonderful. Served with fresh raspberries and blueberrys and whipped cream. Perfect ending to our Bastille Day dinner.

Very tasty and easy to make! I topped my crepes with powdered sugar and strawberry jam.. a great desert!

Very simple recipe for excellent results. I used some crepes that I had previously frozen and the recipe still worked fantastic! I also used brown instead of white sugar, and drizzled the crepes with plain yogurt and blackberry sauce before serving. Delicious!

This is a solid recipe. I made it with white whole wheat, and they still turned out light and tasty.

A decent basic French crepe recipe. I often sprinkle some lemon juice and sugar for a fresh taste, or if I'm feeling adventurous, some Grand Marnier and then light it. Crepes flambees!

Because I'm not the greatest fan for crepes (especially mine!)and I'm sure I did something wrong, I had to give it a two out of four. But the rating had to do with my mistakes, nothing to do with recipe.

I changed this recipe quite a bit with great results. I did not use any butter, but added 2 tsp. oil. I also added 1 cup of 2% milk, and omitted the sugar. Added a little salt. They worked great with savory or sweet filling. My husband loved these too. I added a little extra milk to thin out the batter a little more for lacier crepes. Can not wait to make again!

this is great fast dessert. i usually have crepes in the freezer, so it is easy to thaw a few out and proceed as written..the crepes get nice and crispy and the butter and sugar turn into a caramel. really good.
