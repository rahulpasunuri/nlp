I had several problems with this recipe. 1) the technique for the Crispy Pork says to brown the meat, remove it to a bowl, then place it back in the skillet, add braising liquids and cook. First - why brown it and then braise it? Isn't that making it moist, not crispy? Second, why remove the meat and then return it? Just leave it in there. 2) I used all the seasonings asked for and the chili still had no flavor whatsoever. So, I took some of the flavors in my favorite chili powder and used 1 tbsp each of 3 of them and it finally tasted good. I think the fact that the chili itself had no salt in it was a problem. I realize that you need to cook beans without salt so that the beans aren't tough but you can cook them halfway and then add the salt, once the beans are slightly soft. I have done it a million times and it works well. So for the fact that the pork was not crispy and the chili had no flavor, I give this a 2 forks. Add 1 tbsp cocoa powder, 1 tbsp chili powder, pure ancho chile powder and 1 tbsp salt and it is fine. Otherwise it is overly boring.

I made a few adjustments and changes, so mine didn't turn out quite as pretty as the picture here. But oy, does this stuff taste GOOD. My pork didn't turn out crispy after simmering, but the flavor is fantastic. In fact, the flavors of it all are just...astounding. LOVE IT!!

Rather labor intensive. The other reviewers are right, you really need to have ALL of the sides to get the right flavor, the chili on its own is a little bland.

Taste was excellent, but there was either too many beans or not enough pork. I'll have to get more pork to go with the leftovers.

Had this for dinner last night and it is excellent. I reduced the recipe for the 2 of us and didn't have the problems noted by others. I added lots of salt and it was too salty. I think the key to success is to simmer at a high enough setting to keep the chili 'bubbling'. I made the chili 2 days ahead. Also, my pork turned out crispy. I had the heat high enough to keep the meat cooking (with the cover on) but not burning and I just shook the pan during the process. The salsa makes a lot and the sour cream is a great addition. Cheddar cheese would work as well as the pepper/jack because the chili has LOTS of flavor.

This recipe was a hit with my family. That being said, I modified it a bit. I made the chili two days ahead which really helped the flavors blend, but I did find the water quantity to be off as other reviewers noted. I remedied this by pouring off the excess liquid after cooking the chili into a saucepan, chilled the bean portion and reduced the sauce for at least an hour and added it back into the bean mixture to cool. It ended up being just the right consistency. On the day of service, I trimmed the pork ribs from the excessive amounts of fat and silverskin which I am sure would have ruined the dish. Next time I will use a pork tenderloin and cube up the meat without all the waste. After sauteeing the meat, I placed the meat into my crockpot, deglazed the saute pan with the chicken stock and added it to the meat and braised the meat on low heat for about 40 minutes as per the recipe. I found the meat to be pretty bland, so I added the chili to the meat and continued simmering on high heat (crockpot high heat) for about 5 hours. The meat was fabulously flavored and fork tender. The flavors of this dish are delicious and I served all the accompaniments with it. It was a bit more work than my usual chili recipe, but I will make it again for larger gatherings. We fed six adults and one child with lots of left overs.

The end result was very tasty BUT... 1) there was way too much water - I ended up removing a few cups of the cooking liquid before serving, 2) the beans by themselves ARE quite bland (they NEED the salsa, sour cream, cheese and meat) and 3) it IS a lot of work if you do it all at once (which I did). However, everyone LOVED the end result, and if I had planned better and did things in stages, I would have felt better about the dish (I was rushed at the end). I didn't let things "meld" which probably would have been better. I had lots of sour cream and salsa left over - I could have made HALF the amount of each of them.

I agree that it was a lot of work for the final product. The beans needed a lot of extra seasoning and there was too much liquid. I added two 16 oz. cans of beans (mashed one) to the dried cooked ones. It would be better to use less than the 14 cups of water as there was too much chili for the beans. Make sure you reduce the broth for the pork to nothing to crisp it up. Adding some additional toasted cumin to the meat gave it more crunch & crisp. I also added smoked paprika, doubled the orange peel & oregano to the beans for more smoke flavor as the New Mexico Chili powder was fairly spicy.

We made this for a crowd of friends and everyone loved it. Everyone adjusted the heat level with more of less chipotle tabasco sauce. The beans will need a good amount of salt and pepper (or your favorite seasoning). The crispiness of the pork happens when browning and searing and after the 40 minutes of the pork cooking we took the lid off and let the juices evaporate and that contributed to the crispiness. We couldn't find NM chili powder anywhere so we just used regular chili powder. Not a quick recipe, more of an all afternoon stove on kind of affair but a definite keeper.

I was sorely disappointed in this chili. Without the salsa, the chili itself was totally flavorless. There was nothing crispy about the pork. The Espresso Black Bean Chili (from this site) is much better.
