Lovely! I haven't had a lot of tomato soups in my time but this tasted just right. So creamy, and such a pretty and bright, fresh gremolata. Easy peasy too.

I'd probably give this one 3 1/2 forks. I was a bit skeptical when I first made it -- canned tomaotes? Used San Marzano (sp?) but right after making it had a slightly odd flavor. Since I was making a day ahead for a dinner party, it mellowed a bit overnight and ended up being quite good. The gremolata really makes it -- the lemon zest and garlic freshen the soup -- make as noted. I would make it next time with fresh tomatoes, seeded and juiced, to see the difference that would make. Serving note for summer/fall: serve it cold, in small cups as appetizer along with baked fresh sheep's milk ricotta and rustic bread toasted with olive oil. Very nice pairing. And serve with a French Chablis or CA Chardonnay.

Made as written and hated the outcome. Way too sour, the fennel just disappeared in the soup. I agree with the reviewer who said the soup tasted like canned tomatoes. I put it through a sieve (really stringy fennel) and reluctantly ate it poured over some barley. Too poor to enjoy, to good to throw out. Will not make it again.

This is a delightfully light tomato soup especially for summer. Unbelievable flavor for such few ingredients and little effort. I was afraid the amount of fennel would make it too pronounced, but it's just right.

Been making this for a few years and find it refreshing and fast. I use chopped frozen fennel (from my garden), add sauted onions, 2TB lemon juice, and 1/2 tsp sugar. Love the gremolata!

This is a great soup, and very flavorful. I wonder if Rhonda had a bad batch of tomatoes. Both Trader Joe's and Whole Foods carry their own brand of canned tomatoes which taste great. The fennel gives the soup a sweetness that offsets the acidity of the tomatoes. Whatever you do, don't forget the gremolata. It makes the dish!

This soup tasted like the canned tomatoes that you use. It can be doctored though. I used a Vegetable Medley that I found at the store in one of those cartons and it really put a good finish on it. Along, I would not make it again. But base for something else OK.

This soup is wonderful chilled. I made it the night before and served it chilled for lunch with an asparagus fritatta. It was absolutely fabulous. I also used a teaspoon of sugar.

Easy, delicious and low cal! I love this soup. It's simple enough for a weeknight, but unique enough for a special dinner.

Great flavor; lovely consistency; easy recipe. I make this soup every winter. Sometimes I add some slowly roasted garlic for a change.

light and savoury, fast and easy... a recipe i have transplanted from LA to germany. it was one of the first things i ever cooked for my boyfriend, and he said that it was 'haute cuisine'. ;) good both pureed and chunky... the gremolata is key. guten appetit!

I just finished making this soup and logged right back on to post a positive review. I will be serving it as a starter for a Greek inspired Easter menu. While this is not a Greek dish, the flavors will complement my other dishes quite well. I first prepared the recipe per the instructions and tastes. What a tasty abd healthy soup! But because I'm serving it on a holiday I went ahead and added about 1/4 c half and half with great results. But for normal meals, it's great without any additions. I tripled the recipe, which worked out fine with no adjustments. I will be freezing it, which I expect to work out quite well. If not I'll repost with a note advising against freezing!

I added a teensy bit of sugar and made garlic croutons to float on top. The gremolata was yummy. I think that this would be a good cold soup.

This is the best tomato based soup I've ever had! I, too, added onion and cumin to the fennel saute. The only thing I might change for next time would be to saute the garlic a bit for the gremolata. The large amount of raw garlic was a bit much for many of the people who ate this soup (many of whom said they generally love garlic). I think cooking the garlic first would provide a milder flavor to the gremolata without sacrificing its garlicy goodness.

Beautiful. I followed other reviewers in adding some onion to the fennel - I also added freshly toasted and ground cumin and coriander seed to the saute - It reminded me of my favorite soup from a local Indian restaurant. It makes a simple and delicious lunch - short prep time

I served this soup for lunch, with a few modifications: I sauted 2 onions in butter until carmalized. I then added 1 tsp of ground cumin to the onions and stir-fried for a few seconds, then added the diced fennel. 1 tsp of sugar was then added to the tomato liquid. I made the soup the day before to allow the flavours to develop. The carmalized onions gave the soup a nice sweet undertone. I didn't find the lemon juice/zest too strong - though the fennel flavour was a bit lost. I think I'll add 1/2 tsp of ground fennel to the cumin next time. Overall - Simple soup, yet quite impressive (do use chicken stock - it gives the soup a whole different dimension).

Has anyone tried this a cold soup? I am looking for something refreshing for an outdoor Easter dinner in hot, sunny Florida. But, I don't want the standard gazpacho (sp?!)

On its own, I thought the soup was average. However, I really loved it with a grilled cheddar panini... Since the soup was not cream based, it was the perfect complement to the cheese with the tomato/fennel flavors. Pureeing the soup is very simple with an immersion blender.

Wow! What a great soup. I would definitely make this again...easy, fast, and delicious. The only negative is doing the puree; it can get a little messy. Be sure to do it in batches (as the recipe says)and don't try to put half of it in the blender all at once (like I did--my fault!). But, the pureeing really adds a nice texture to the dish and blends the flavors really well; I wouldn't recommend leaving that step out.

This was so easy, quick, and tasty! I did add some fennel seeds when pouring in the tomatoes to bring out the fennel flavor more and used veggie broth for my vegetarian family - it was so good. I also didn't puree it all and really enjoyed having some whole pieces of the vegetables in the soup. Oh, and I did add a little sugar as other reviewers mentioned. The lemon juice wasn't too much for us, but I can see how it might be for others. Highly recommend this scrumptious number!

Kathy sounds like a moron. Who cares if she's intolerant to garlic? The very hot oil begged? Really, in Italian? Pfffffft.

Yum. Light, quick, easy and healthy. This is a winner, especially for those of us who are trying to watch our fat intake but love real flavor.

Quick and easy to prepare. I initially thought the acidic tomato/lemon combo wouldn't work, but the soup is fresh and flavorful. One necessary addition - add a little sugar!

This is a very funky recipe. It hcontains a mix of flavours complex enough that you have to taste it to really understand how great it is. The soup does not taste complete until you stir in the gremolata. The two are a perfect mix. Love this stuff.

I loved this recipie because I added my own Fusion/Confusion. The very hot olive oil begged to have a tablespoon or more of fresh ground cummin added first to release the flavor. I then added the fennel bulb and sauted as directed. The tomatoes needed a heaping teaspoon of sugar. I served w a dollop of sour cream, big crunchy crutons, and the gremolata on top. I reduced the amount of garlic in the gremolata because of an intolerance to garlic. Serve with freshly popped prawn crackers. (Any Asian food market) A winning starter to any meal.

I didn't think this soup was bland. But I agree the gremolata is a "deal maker" - I added a little chopped fresh basil to the gremolata. This tasted even better the next day and is fresh and light tasting. I liked it.

I found this soup to be a little bland, but it might go well with an otherwise spicey meal. Don't even attempt to serve it without the gremolata
