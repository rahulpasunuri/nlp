Perfect for a cold weather day. I did not use Vienna sausage, and used only ~ 4oz of bacon, minced. One word of caution, it is easy to burn the split peas, so keep the heat low and stir often.

PS The wine recommendation was spot on. We opened a Navarro (Mendocino Coast) Pinot Gris - not the wine I might otherwise have selected - and it complemented the soup beautifully!

Absolutely the most delicious pea soup I've ever had. Credit those chunks of veggies - and maybe the smoked pig's foot I used in place of the pound of bacon (all the flavor, none of the fat). To be fair, I also omitted the canned Vienna sausages (come on!). Can anyone answer why another "Yellow Pea Soup" recipe on this site is rated 4 forks but only 89% of users would make it again?

I used Better Than Bouillon and chopped up 3 Lightlife Smoked Style sausages to make this recipe vegan. It was excellent. This is going to be a staple of mine this winter.

Very good! I hate it when people don't follow the recipe and then submit a rating, but I'm making an exception to my own rule because I don't think I was too aggregiously off the mark. I used green split peas instead of yellow. Instead of the salt pork, I cooked the peas with a dollop of concentrated ham base out of a jar. Used the canadian bacon, but omitted the vienna sausages (frankly, I didn't even see them on the ingredient list until the end and that's just not the kind of thing I happen to have in the pantry!). It turned out delicious anyway, and because my husband is quick to turn up his nose at legume-based soups, I get the whole pot to myself. Yummy lunches all week!

Deeelish! Made it without the meats (we are vegetarians), used half of a big celariac, 1 leek, and 1 huge onion. It was great and still tasted Swedish even without the pork.

I make a similar recipe called "Finnish Pea Soup" using beef but we really did enjoy this recipe the 2nd. time I made it I omitted the Canadian bacon and Vienna sausages and replaced with cooked smoked ham hocks...

Utterly delicious! We've devoured the whole 18-cup batch in just a couple of days! We skipped all the meat but added a ham hock for flavor (shredding the bit of meat at the end, discarding the fat). We sauteed the onions/celery/leeks in 1 T olive oil first then added peas, brought to a boil, cooked for an hour. Then we added the carrots etc but it took SEVERAL hours for the beans to fully cook. Made the whole house smell great while cooking so no one minded. Using this version, soup is only 75 calories a cup, even though very filling!

I made a vegetarian version of this soup for a recent dinner party. Everyone was asking for the recipe! I simply omitted the bacon and sausage and used tamari to flavor the soup instead. I also sliced the leeks finely and sauted them with the onions first, then I added the peas and water (boil this until the peas are soft). 20 minutes before serving time I added the remaining veggies. Yum!
