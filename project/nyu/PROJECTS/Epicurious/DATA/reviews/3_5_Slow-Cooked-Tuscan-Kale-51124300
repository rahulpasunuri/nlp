First time reviewing, but I'm an avid reader of reviews when contemplating cooking a recipe - so I have to give a thank you shout-out to all reviewers and, in this instance, to the reviewer who suggested tossing pasta in to use up the excess oil. Pretty tasty, and turns into a much more substantial side! I was using CSA loose bagged kale, and was unsure of the weight (but fairly certain it wasn't equal to 2 bunches/1 pound), so I put in 1/2 to 3/4 of the recommended amounts of all other ingredients. It ended up oily, for sure (ergo the pasta), but remarkably sweet and delicious and mellow - without a hint of the bitterness I fear in kale. A keeper.

I normally don't cook greens this long but the confiting technique totally transforms the veg. The onion is brilliant. I may have used a touch less oil but I wouldn't back way off because it serves to concentrates flavor. Stir the greens into pasta or other grains if you want to use up the oil. Any sturdy greens will work. I used collards.

Made this as part of our stuffing -- using Tuscan kale is key -- we used baby kale and it cooked down to abt 1 1/2 cups of kale -- not quite enough to make its presence known in the stuffing! Overall, best used as a side dish -- oh, and use less oil! Just enough to coat the bottom of the pan.

This is amazing easy and good! I made as written, but probably used substantially less oil. I didn't measure, just used enough to coat the onions, and then a touch more with the kale. Only substitution was to use a fresh hot pepper from my plant in place of the chili. This will definitely be part of my regular "go to" lineup.

I had a great experience with this dish although I do not disagree with some of the first reviewer's comments. I did also think it seemed like way too much oil (maybe it is the correct amount when you make it for the stuffing recipe it is part of), so I probably cut the amount in half. I also used a bit over 1.5 lbs of Cavolo Nero kale, because you have to remove the ribs and stalks. Otherwise, I was fairly faithful to the recipe technique, although I did substitute crushed red pepper for the chile and I threw in a thyme spring in addition to the rosemary. I served it with some pretty glamorous braised short ribs at a dinner party, but everyone raved especially about the kale and how sweet it was. The recipe was about right for four people as a side dish. I will definitely make this again... it is easy and better than some other Tuscan kale recipes I have tried previously.

Sounded like an interesting recipe, but either the instructions are unclear or the recipe is just not that great. Oily, not remarkable, and a great deal of work for a disappointing result. Also, cooking the kale for so long shrinks it way down, so the yield is very little.
