I must agree with a few of the other comments. Delicious ice cream but way too rich.

This ice cream recipe is okay, but there are too many cooked elements in it and it doesn't taste fresh or really all that "peachy" in the end. I had even put chopped chunks of fresh peaches in it to try to lift it up a bit. If I make it again I would maybe not make it custard based, but I would definitely not cook the peaches- simply sugar peeled peaches, let them sit a little while, then mash them coarsely with a masher.

Liked the ease of this recipe. I did not puree all the peaches as I do like to have some peach pieces in my ice cream. Served over blueberry pound cake. Pretty good but didnt blow my socks off.

Love this recipe! I've used the same recipe different ways: with fresh peaches (a touch of almond extract), frozen blackberries and fresh blueberries (with vanilla). Each time the results were fantastic: super fruity, smooth creamy ice cream.

This is a fabulous peach ice cream. I added some candied ginger and tiny bit of fresh ginger to the simmering peaches. When I churned the custard-peach mixture I added about a tablespoon or so of finely diced candied ginger and a tablespoon of bourbon. I used very ripe local peaches. (I bought seconds at the Green City Market.)

Whoa! Phenomenal! I've been seeking a peach ice cream recipe and I don't see how they can get better than this! I used local Niagara peaches and it captured the end of summer very nicely. I chilled the mixture before churning it, as suggested. I can't wait to try the Cranberry ice cream for the holidays.

This was really good but a bit too rich for me. The peaches kicked off a ton of water so I figured that was why it was paired with a full-custard base, but even given that, it was still too rich (for me). Next time, I'll try it with half-and-half instead of cream.

This is the best fresh peach ice cream recipe I've come across. The custard base really gives it a smooth, velvety texture. I used smaller peaches because they give off less water, and I definitely agree with west ky chef to chill the mixture thoroughly before you churn it. Fruit-based ice creams are notorious for becoming icy. And don't skip the almond extract. It really brings out the peach flavor!

--To the previous reviewer: In the paragraph above the ingredients list it says to work with the ice cream base from the cranberry ice cream recipe. This recipe is amazing. I wouldn't use anything other than fresh peaches for this. I like to use a 1:11 ratio of yellow and white fleshed peaches to balance the sweetness and acidity of the fruit. The key is to make sure that your custard is as cold as possible before churning it to assure small ice crystals and a velvety ice cream.

This recipe is not complete. Please update it with correct info. It says to make custard but you don't have eggs or cream written down in the ingredients section.
