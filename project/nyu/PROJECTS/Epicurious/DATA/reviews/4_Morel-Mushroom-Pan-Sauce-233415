I've made this several times, and it is just awesome each time. I follow the recipe as written, except for the mushroom sauce. I use porcini's instead because of the cost or morels. I can't rave enough about this dish!

I'm going to go out on a limb here...I am pretty sure that the cook from Indy was having a bit of fun to see if others would take the bait and it worked! Even a really bad cook would not change all but one of the ingredients and complain that it didn't turn out well. The recipe is great as is.

This was excellent! We made this for Christmas dinner exactly as printed down to the same sherry. Everyone raved. The pork was also perfectly cooked so that didn't hurt. Served along side fresh pasta with robiola rochetta and truffle shavings. FABULOUS Christmas dinner. Can't wait for leftovers. I didn't read the review from "Indy" in advance of making this, however, just a comment along those lines. I understand some substitutions may be necessary but at some point it's not the same recipe. Try it the FIRST time as close to how it's written as possible. Then and only then can you review it fairly. Happy Cooking in 2012!

Excellent base for a great pan sauce. Chose to use this on a very rare but seared filet mignon, so replaced the absent pan juices with some great veal demiglace I had in the fridge. Threw a little fresh thyme on top and loved it. As a chef (yes, a real one, not one from Indianapolis), I have never found a recipe on Epicurious with a review like the "one" here...what a riot. I'm surprised there wasn't Cool Whip or canned peas involved. Yikes. I'm all for people here who are learning to cook, but don't bag on Bruce's recipe because you chose to slaughter it. :)

@worldbeat LOL! I had tears in my eyes reading your comment. I'm going to make this recipe exactly as written with the morels I found today. You inspired me.!

Excellent pan sauce! I made the mushrooms a day ahead, used 1 oz morels and 1 oz shitaake. After removing my roast from the pan I spooned off fat from juices, added the sherry to deglaze, then added the mushroom base. I then boiled this down to thicken, seasoned, and served. Great depth of flavor!

This is wonderful and it disappears quickly - well before the pork is gone. I used some dried morels, but supplemented them with an assortment of fresh mushrooms to not break the bank.

To the Cook from Indianapolis. I cannot believe the disgusting concoction you created. Grand Marnier? Fish sauce? Salmon? Turnip greens and cream cheese?? And then you say there's something wrong with THIS recipe? Are you out of your mind? I'm a peace-loving person, but I really think you should be tried and sentenced for this abomination. And you say you're really a good cook? Honey, you're living in a fool's paradise.

I am going to ake this this weekend. It sounds wonderful and I, usually, don't comment on other comments, but the"salmon, fish sauce, etc", was truly ridiculous. I am always dissappointed when some one cooks something that doesn't reflect the recipe and then complains.

I have made this several times, usually accompanying wild boar and once substituting port, and it is exceptional. This probably goes without saying but please ignore the cook that substituted salmon for pork and found the results unsatisfactory. The roast drippings are what really make this sauce.

This was amazing. I used fresh Morels from Far West Fungi and served it with pan seared venison medallions. This was truly amazing paired with a Cote De Rhone.

To Cook from Indianapolos Dried Morels have a deeper flavor than fresh morels. If you subsitute them then totally rearange a recipe then how can you say it didnt taste right? fish sauce, oyster liquor and grand marnier plus turnip greens. That is not the same recipe or even close. I dont understand nor would I want to stay for dinner.

I recenlty found several bags of fresh morels, and in need of a new way to cook them I found this recipe. It just didn't taste right to us?? I don't eat pork so I used a nice 4lb fresh salmon filet instead, this was absolutely the finest filet I had ever seen! Brandy wouldn't do salmon justice so I substitued 1 cup of gran marnier liquer and replace the shallots with some fresh turnip greens from the garden. Because this was a fish recipe I used fish sauce and oyster liqour in place of the chicken broth, which only makes sense. Me and my husband LOVE cream based recipes so I used 1 cup heavy cream and added 1 cup cream cheese (softened). A neighbor knocked on the door while this was cooking to inquire what dish I was preparing tonight, because he just absolutely loves my cooking, but refused my offer to stay for dinner? Well, to get to the final result, it was too dry and tasted very odd. If you really must try this recipe you may want to consider using a few cans of Pennslyvania Dutch mushrooms and save you morels for something else.

I used dried shitake instead. Simmered the sauce for quite a while to reach a nice consistency. Perfect with the pork. My kids were extremely disappointed when the left over sauce was gone before the left over pork.

Made this to go with the pork roast. The sauce was a hit. I had simmer a lot longer than 30 minutes to get the sauce thickened.
