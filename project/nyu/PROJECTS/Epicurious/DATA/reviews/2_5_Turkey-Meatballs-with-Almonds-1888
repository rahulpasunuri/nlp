I thought this was too bland and uninteresting.

This was a good dish -- I served it over low-carb spaghetti for my Atkins diet and my husband (who is NOT watching carbs) said it tasted healthy but perhaps a bit too "diet-y". We added a few drops of tabasco sauce and it improved the taste a lot. Also increased the chicken broth to stretch the sauce and as a timesaver used canned chopped tomatoes instead of fresh.

I knew that if they tasted as good as they smelled in the oven that this would be a winning recipe. For a turkey meatball this is "king". I did however make a few minor changes. I had 2.5# of ground turkey to which I added 2c. of panko bread crumbs, 5T. of parsley, 5T. of almonds, 2t. dried thyme, 7 gloves of minced garlic, liberal amounts of kosher salt, and coarsely ground pepper, and only 2 large eggs. Thankful that I didn't double the egg amount. It would have been way too loose. I formed the meatballs using a #24 scoop and baked for 20 mins. total using convection. Yielded 24 meatballs. Loved the texture of the chopped almonds. Didn't make the sauce but used a garden fresh sauce that I had made previously. Served on a buttered and lightly toasted italian roll, smothered with sauce, and topped with grated mozzarella. Baked until cheese was melted. THE BEST meatball sandwich I've had ANYWHERE. Try this recipe. You won't be disappointed.

Liked the taste of the meatballs and sauce. However, it didn't make enough sauce to serve over rice or noodles. I'll make it again, but will double the "sauce".

Quite bland, but tasty. If you are going to use turkey breast, don't forget to oil the baking sheet! I did have to add more broth to make anything like a sauce; next time I'm going to try putting the sauce in the blender.

A unique recipe full of flavor!

For a nice twist, use toasted pine nuts. Put them in the food processor w/ some portabella mushrooms, garlic cloves and some onion (pusle to a mush). I always add the mushrooms this way 'cause they add alot of flavor (and my mushroom hating daughter can't tell they are in there!). Add this to the other ingredients, maybe w/ a pinch of cilantro- use ground turkey BREAST, to make almost fat free!

This is a very interesting recipe, and the toasted almonds make all the difference. I imagine it would be extremely bland and boring without the flavor of the toasted almonds. I used more chicken stock than the recipe calls for, because a cup just evaporates too quickly, and I served it with orzo. I'd make it again, but I probably wouldn't serve it to quests. It was nice and homey, though, on a cold, rainy evening.

Meatballs were exceptional, however, the sauce was too thick and almost not a sauce. Most of the liquid evaporated during the stovetop preparation of the sauce.
