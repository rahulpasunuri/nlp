Prepared these for yesterday's cocktail party. They ALL disappeared. I used thin sandwich bread: toasted it, cut off the crusts, and cut into fourths. This worked out quite well.

Zowie! I am known for usually serving food with a disclaimer, so people were shocked that **I**, made this delicious appie. It was simple and y-um-my! But the second time I made it, I used a rather strong feta which ruined the taste- stick with mild goat cheese and toast the bread. Enjoy!

Easy, flavorful and different from the norm appetizer! I used a 6 oz can of chopped olives and just stirred them in after processing and I toasted the bread before speading the mixture. We love garlic so I used a large clove and increased the amount scallions. I served these in combination with the BA 1/99 Artichoke Bruschetta.
