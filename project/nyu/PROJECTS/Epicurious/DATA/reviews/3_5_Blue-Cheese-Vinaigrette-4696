Yummy! I made this to go with a leg of lamb...it was delicious and all my guests asked for the recipe. The only thing I didn't do was add the basil and the sugar. It turned out great.

LOVE this dressing. I use it to make spinach salad. Every time my cousin and I have it, we sit there saying "OMG, this is SO good!!!".

This is an excellent vinaigrette, especially for those, like me, who love blue veined cheeses but dislike thick creamy salad dressings. The first time I made this I instinctively decreased the sugar to 1 teaspoon and it was still too much. Add just a pinch to taste if needed.

this is my favorite dressing. i would not change a thing except always make a lot more. it keeps a long time, can be thinned, and a little goes a LONG way.

My family really likes this dressing. They love Marie's Blue Cheese Vinagrette, which is very expensive; so I was looking for something similar. Well, this really isn't similar, but it is so good. Marie's is thinner & has blue cheese chunks. This one is smooth & creamy. I went ahead & added some more blue cheese crumbles after blending. My husband said, "I can't shovel enough salad in my mouth at a time, it's so good!"

Sorry, my previous review (below) was for the Blue Cheese & Chive Dressing recipe!

This is so easy and really great tasting. My chives are done for the season, so I used a tablespoon of minced onion and it worked fine. I tasted it without the onion and it was just as good. Terrific over a simple green salad of romaine, onions, and shaved carrot. Could also see this as a dip for crudites...

My husband said this was the best salad dressing I ever made (not that that's saying much). Quick and tasty--I only had red wine vinegar, and no basil, but it was still delicious. We'll have to drive down to Hassayampa and see if they're still serving it!

Not the best blue cheese dressing but it worked well with pear, endive and watercress salad. Having just moved to Europe, I don't have a functioning blender or processor, so I simply whisked. I also used gorgonzola instead of blue, as I actually couldn't easily find a ¨regular¨ blue cheese here in Sweden.

This is a delicious dressing!!! I tossed it with romaine, sliced grilled chicken and bacon and it was a winner.

One of the best blue cheese dressing recipes I've tried. Cooking the garlic first softens it a bit, and less sugar and hot sauce works for me.

Really enjoyed this dressing -- cut the hot pepper sauce to 1/4 tsp. and the sugar to 1/2 tablespoon.

This is a very good vinaigrette and thought the blue cheese was subtle. I may experiment next time around and use balsamic or sherry vinegar. I would agree that the amount of sugar should be decreased slightly.

I agree it's a restaurant-level dressing. I cut it in half and it was enough for 3+ servings. Very tasty!

Delicious. Didn't have any fresh basil, so left it out and it was good anyways. Thanks for the suggestion of using less sugar---I also halved the amount.

I used a half of a tablespoon of sugar and this seemed like the correct amount for us. Try it.

I always try recipes that have received good reviews from previous cooks. Thanks to those who suggested it. It was delicious! :)

A great dressing. My blue cheese lovers ask for this over the standard creamy dressing.

Truly restaurant-quality dressing. Would be excellent on a "white" salad, but I put on a salad of Romaine, Granny Smith apples, mushrooms, walnuts, and hard-boiled eggs. I made half a recipe for 2 and it turned out fine. If you don't like spicy food, you will want to cut back on the tabasco.

Great vinaigrette! I tossed it with baby greens and spinkled chopped walnuts on top.
