Unbelievably simple to make and unbelievably delicious to eat! I have been making this soup for years, and my kids always cheer when they hear we're having it for dinner. I have made it with about 3/4 cup skim milk and 1/4 cup half and half or cream, or whatever I happen to have on hand because I rarely have whole milk that the recipe calls for. I substitute dried dill for fresh, and it turns out just fine. I also just add the milk to the pot and use my immersion blender until I get the consistency I like instead of transferring hot liquid to a blender. There is never a drop left over!

I forgot to mention that I added ham to this which made it extra hearty.

Probably the best potato soup I've ever had. Made exactly as per the directions. YUM! Served with hearty bread, Carb delight:)

This is one of my favorite soup recipes. I have used it many times. The dill is definitely a great addition and I will never make potato soup without it again. I see some people had some issues with their soup coming out watery and bland. I would recommend adding some garlic, using vegetable broth instead of water and putting in some extra veggies so you can puree more of them at the end for a creamier base. I also add sweet potatoes sometimes which is delicious.

What a waste of an evening....... temperature definitely too hot for vegetables.......too brown. Pureed soup with immersion blender - it was an unappetizing shade of brown. And the taste was off as well. Had high hopes for finding something new for my vegetarian daughter, but this is definitely not it. Just threw out.

This recipe was wonderful, it's become a staple in my house. I substituted the 4 cups of water for veggie broth, and added about 1/2 cup of sour cream and 3/4 cups of cheddar cheese, as well as usuing half cream and half milk. These additions and substitutions make it a rich, creamy, delightful soup very reminiscent of a baked potato, I even used to add bacon which really gave it that extra kick. One of the better vegetarian soup recpes I've tried, though. Very comforting.

My husband and I loved this potato soup. I thought the dill was such a good addition to the typical potato soups I'm used to. Was a wonderful meatless comfort food dish =D I will definitely be making this again.

I also used broth instead of water, and half olive oil and butter. I added a leak, and substituted fennel for celery. I also added some dried ham I needed to use up in the fridge. We loved it!

I really like this soup--it was so easy and I already had all the ingredients in my fridge. I used half olive oil and half butter plus 2% milk. Blended 2/3 of it my Vitamix for extra smooth, creamy soup. Easy and good. A beet salad with mustard vinaigrette was a nice complement.

Very tasty and easy to make. Changes -used chicken stock in place of water, light cream vs. milk and added more celery. Recommend stick blender. Will reduce salt slightly and might add pepper flakes or cayenne pepper on next try.

This soup was easy to make; I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting chicken broth for the water. It was good, but not great - I would not make it again.

This soup was great and used a lot of fresh produce that most of us have around the kitchen, I think. I left out the cream and used chicken stock instead, which I think gave it a little more complexity of flavor vs. using just water. Also, I mashed everything lightly near the end vs. pureeing it, to give it a little more texture and weight so a bowl of soup could stand alone for dinner. Also, sprinkled a little parm/romano on top. Num!

I made this soup for the first time two nights ago, and my family RAVED! Yesterday I asked them what they wanted for dinner that night and they asked for this soup again. I made something else, and today was told I'd better make this soup again, or ELSE! The only changes I made were to substitute vegetable stock for the water, 1% milk for the whole milk, and I added quite a bit more fresh ground pepper. Best soup EVER!

Wow - so flavorful for something so simple! My husband said it was his favorite soup I've ever made (and I make soup about once a week!). My only changes were to use veggie broth instead of water, 2/3 cup skim milk + 1/3 low-fat buttermilk for the milk (b/c that's what I had on hand). Added a splash of white wine at the end and way more salt, and used an immersion blender but left it slightly chunky. Huge flavor for so few ingredients! The fresh dill really makes it. Next time I think I'll saute some caraway seeds with the veggies as well.

Definitely don't use water! If you're a vegetarian, use veggie stock. I used homemade turkey stock, and probably 2 - 2.5 lbs of potatoes. I didn't have fresh dill, so I used a lot of freshly ground coriander, fresh-ground dill seed, and freshly toasted & ground caraway seeds. I also used some light half&half instead of milk. Delicious!

I used chicken broth instead of water. Othwerwise I followed the recipe and I think it is an awesome soup. I will definitely be making it again.

Excellent recipe. I also substituted water for chicken broth and used salted instead of unsalted butter. The broth I made from scratch using a chicken boullion, which really added to the flavor. I used 2% milk instead so to enhance the thickness I added gumbo file. Delicious !!!

Wow! Amazing soup! Followed talk2mrsh suggestion to add white wine in the end that definitely intensified the flavor. Should have cut the butter as people suggested here but was too worried it'd stick too much to the walls of my dutch oven, but no - the veggies gave out a lot of liquid. I will definitely make this again. This is a very easy to make, flavorful soup (took me an hour to make from start to finish).

I changed a lot of this recipe based on what I had on hand. I used broccoli and cauliflower instead of celery, and some dehydrated carrots instead of fresh ones. 3 cups stock, one water, and just a teaspoon dried dill. It turned out very thin, so I boiled it down for quite a while after. My family loves it. :D

I used chicken stock, as some others have recommended, and 3/4 cup 1% milk plus 1/4 cup half and half, and it came out just right. Also, I used 1 TBS dried dill weed instead of fresh.

I took the advice of previous reviewers to use chicken broth instead of water. I reduced the amount of butter to 2 T. - it's plenty to saute the vegetables. I deglazed the pot with chicken broth before I added the potatoes and used an immersion blender but left it a little chunky. I used 3/4 cup of 2% milk and 1/4 cup of half/half. At the end I stirred in about 1/4 cup of white wine and a generous splash of white wine vinegar to give the acid that it did seem to need. The wine gives a nice aroma that adds to the richness of the soup. Delicious!

This soup is very satisfying and was creamy after blending with a full flavor. I made two changes: I used chicken broth for the liquid and used about 2 pounds of potatoes. My guests also liked it so I'll be making it again!!

Soup is delicious with a few additions: - crumbled bacon - extra milk - sour cream/cheese garnish Also recommend pureeing the bulk of the soup, leaving just enough vegetables in chunk form for texture.

It was very good but it seriously lacks something I'm not exactly sure what but it really did need some added flavor.

Superb - followed the recipe as written though I used chicken stock instead of water and omitted the dill because I found out too late that I didn't have any. Very easy recipe with excellent results that will be quickly devoured!

This was a decent soup. I used only 3 tbls of butter and skim milk. This may have been why it tasted a little bland the first day... it was much better once the flavors had had a chance to blend. Speaking of blending, I did process a bit more of the vegetables than called for, though not all. I thought that this was a good improvement. I did need to add quite a bit of salt, pepper, and dill.

I think this soup was Ok. I also used chicken broth, but I made a rue, after I sauted the veggies. This made for a creamier soup. I also added lots of black pepper

This recipe was yummy and easy. But, I substituted chicken broth for the water and deglazed the pan before adding the broth with a little white wine. I think the recipe is lacking acid - perhaps why some folks think it's bland and others say that their family makes it with pickle juice. Perhaps I'll try the pickle juice next time!

for j_simone_6, i agree with the milk and cheese comment. but since when is chicken stock "unhealthy"?

I haven't made this soup yet, but as far as the comments about using less water and adding stock, milk and even cheese - isn't this supposed to be a 'healthy' soup?

I had two leftover cups of chicken broth which I used for half of the water. Did anyone else find that a whole stick of butter was a bit much? It seemed a little greasy. Overall, a tasty, easy recipe. I also used my immersion blender, which was a huge help.

This soup was good, but not great. Adding lots of shredded extra sharp cheddar made it a lot better. I would probably not make this recipe again because I am a soup fanatic and there are a lot of better soups out there!

I unfortunately have to completely agree with rkmaus... after following the recipe stricktly, the soup turns out bland, watery and lacks any creaminess that you would want from a potato soup. Anyhow, this might as well be the way other people like it... wasn't for me. I'd have to reduce the amount of water a lot and add cream instead, as well as making sure only potato chunks stay in the soup and the other vegetables get pureed.. and more seasoning... but I guess that would be a different recipe ;-)

My mother-in-law from Poland makes a similar soup to this that is fantastic - Dill Pickle Soup, same ingredients, but with pickle juice rather than milk, and grated dill pickle added. A little evaporated milk added at the end creams it up a touch. yum!

My (German) mother makes this except her recipe does not have carrots, and it has sour cream, and a splash of vinegar added just before serving. When I make it I use a veggie chicken stock and increase the dill. Delicious.

I used chicken broth for some of the water, and 2% milk instead of whole. Also added some garlic to the veggies, and sprinkled with a parmesan and romano grated cheese blend before serving, excellent!

This was exactly what I needed on a cold winter's night - fast, tasty, and used what I had on hand. I had my daughter do a few pulses with the immersion blender rather than pull out the big blender. I believe I also used a can of vegetable broth instead of some of the water. My two teenagers ate it up. Would be great with pumpernickel bread, cheese, and a salad.
