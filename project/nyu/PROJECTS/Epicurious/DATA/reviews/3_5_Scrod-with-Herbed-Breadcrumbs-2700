I Halved recipe. I wanted this to be really quick and easy! Mixed @1 1/2 tbsp. butter and 1 tbsp olive oil with 2-3 slices diced onion, directly in the baking pan. Mixed it all right in the pan and baked in 450 degree oven until onion was translucent. Then I mixed a few tbsp. Italian bread crumbs and @1/4 c. fresh chopped parsley. Coated fish filets and sprinkled with a bit of lemon juice. Baked as directed. It came out delicious! Both hubby and I liked it a lot, and it wasn't soggy. Would make again.

I didn't rate this since I could not find halibut - used cod. Very nice, slightly boring. Easy weeknight meal that's reasonably healthy. Served with asparagus and couscous.

Was super yummy! I did not halve the grated lemon peel, and I did not have any parsley on hand. We thought dish could use a few more spices to give it more flavor, i think i will add garlic next time, but it was quite nice. I used panko bread crumbs and used half butter and half smart balance butter spread. I really covered the fish in the bread crumbs, patted them down with a spatula. just about encased it. The bread crumbs started to burn in the oven after about 10 minutes, so i placed a sheet of foil over the dish for the remaining 10 minutes. Worked like a charm. In the end the breadcrumbs loosened up (I had patted them down) and were a nice balance to the fish. I served with simple steamed green beans. Easy weeknight meal, woo hoo another recipe for the repertoire!

It seemed like this dish did not want to be made because I was out of so many ingredients, but had some haddock on its last legs (or fins) and I didnt feel like going to the grocery store My subs were Whole grain bread for the breadcrumbs, dried parsley (did nothing to add to the flavor), and bottled lemon juice. This recipe gets 4 forks for tastiness and versatility. A nice fresh squeeze of lemon over the top would have been terrific though  darn my hubby and his juicing. No fruit or veggie is safe in my house.

Delicious! Followed the recipe with the tweaks from other reviews--eliminated the grated lemon, added a clove of garlic with the shallots, used Panko bread crumbs and a little mayonnaise to help the Panko adhere to the fish. Fresh herbs really make a difference.

Terrific, easy weeknight recipe. Panko, instead of soft bread crumbs, adds a bit of crunch.

Had this for dinner tonight using true cod. Had to make a few substitutions: garlic and a little sweet onion instead of shallots, butter/olive oil mix instead of all butter, spelt bread crumbs instead of white, a little dried dill instead of fresh parsley, 1 tsp. grated lemon peel instead of two. All-in-all it was still good - hubby said 4 forks. Next time I'd like to make according to recipe as written. It's good to have a few of these forgiving recipes in the recipe box.

I gave this 4 forks because 3 just didn't seem like enough. It is simply exceptional in a easy week night kind of way. I used crumbled english muffins (no white bread in the house) and very little lemon (husband isn't a fan). I mixed equal parts of mayo and whole grain mustard and spread a thin layer on the fish. Delicious.

I used cod and skipped the lemon peel per others' comments. I also took the advice of another reviewer and topped the cod with some mayo to make the crumbs adhere. Fish came out juicy and perfect. Loved it. Baking time is just right.

My husband and I both liked this. Our 8-year-old said it tasted like "cleaning spray". She didn't like the lemon flavor. I will make this again but I will cut back on the lemon zest and use only 1 teaspoon. I used green onions and haddock.

I made this tonight and it came out delicious! And it was very easy! I was a little skeptical about 20 min. at 450; thought it would be dried out. Was not the case at all. Cod was flaky, tasty, done perfectly. A few minor changes. . halved the recipe since I was only cooking for 2. Used a small onion, italian breadcrumbs and dried parsley only because I didn't have the exact ingredients in the house. Would absolutely make again even for company. Husband loved it!

Delicious and easy way to make scrod; leftovers also soaked up the flavors.

This is a great recipe. The bread topping is delicious. I made two minor changes based on a suggestion from my mother-in-law. First, I added two cloves of minced garlic and sauted them for 30 seconds just prior to adding in the panko. Second, I made a mixture of light mayonnaise and dijon mustard and put it on the cod prior to covering the fish with the panko mixture. This helped keep the panko mixture on the fish as well as moisten the dish. I think panko is really plain tasting, so using fresh herbs made a real difference in the taste. The dinner was a huge hit and I would serve it to company.

This was delicious. We're not big cod fans, but this had a lot of flavor--it is now my favorite cod recipe. The kids thought it was OK. I think the lemon flavor was a bit strong for them.

I used frozen cod, sprout bread crumbs garlic instead of shallot and olive oil maybe 2 TBS instead of butter I just mixed everything together in a bowl without ever cooking anything. It was very good and very easy. My fish was still frozen when I started so I cooked longer and accidentally over cooked it a tad. This is a definete keeper.

This is a great, easy way to make cod. (I can't find scrod most of the time.) My family actually likes it better than fried, and plain broiled cod is sooo boring.

Have made this a few times now, and it's always a hit. Strangely, I found no need to futz with anything, unusual for me. Great way to enjoy fish, especially during cold weather.

This was quite good. I halved the recipe as I was only cooking for two. I used two slices of fresh sourdough bread to make the crumbs in the food processor. I followed the recipe pretty faithfully, but added a couple of pinches of dry mustard to the crumb mixture. LOTS of salt and pepper. 20 minutes at 450 was perfect. We don't eat a lot of fish, but I would make this again sometime. Served with roasted asparagus and scalloped potatoes for a nice Sunday dinner.

Delicious but can be improved. Instead of "fresh white breadcrumbs" I used one not two cups of dried breadcrumbs that I make myself and keep in the freezer. I also added 1/4 c. mayo and 3.5 oz. crabmeat. It was wonderful.

Lazy version - micro-melted the butter and stirred it into some crushed left-over crackers...w/little lemon squeeze at end. Turned off oven after ten minutes, residual heat finished perfectly. Easier for me and raves from hubby w/"purist's" palate! Had nice piece of fish but no fresh parsley, etc...still a winning way to prepare this fish.

I improvised wildly with this one. I used matzoh meal I had leftover from another recipe. I threw in some chopped tomatos and leftover romano cheese. I agree... the 20 minute baking time produced a perfect result. If I were to make this again, I'd add bigger, bolder flavours to give this dish some umph. I must admit this recipe gives the cod an opportunity to shine and the other flavours take a back seat to the fish. Three and a half forks for the technique... two forks for the recipe itself.

I used a smaller quantity of dried unflavored bread crumbs. Guests loved it. This is a simple topping that goes well with almost any seafood.

Simple but delicious recipe. I used all fresh ingredients, except for the breadcrumbs (store bought, Italian seasoned)and the results were good. The seasoned breadcrumbs added a little more flavor without overpowering the fish. The fish was moist and flaky but not soggy. I hate soggy fish.

I made this last night for dinner - we liked it! I used fresh cod from our local fish market.. used Panko breadcrumbs - turned out really well. The 20 min cooking time was perfect! I'll make this again!

Thought this was a very tasty recipe. Used potato bread to make fresh crumbs, fresh chives, but margarine, freeze dried shallots, dried lemon peel and parsley and it worked fine. Would definitely make again.

This was my first experience preparing scrod. I will definitely make it again. My family loved it.

This recipe yielded a perfectly cooked and succulent scrod. The 20-minute cooking time was ideal for the thick filets the recipe recommends, although you should probably check the temperature of your own oven for accuracy and time the fish carefully. My family raved about this.

Great way to prepare scrod. The fish did not take 20 minutes to cook, it only took about 15. The flavor was excelent and the fish stayed moist. I will make this again.
