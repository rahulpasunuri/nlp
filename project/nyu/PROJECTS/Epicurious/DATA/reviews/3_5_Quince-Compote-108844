This is just fantastic. After peeling the quinces, I added the peels to the liquid (don't add the diced fruit yet) and let it simmer for about 20 minutes. Then strained out the peels and added the diced fruit. This enhanced the flavor of the dish greatly. I cut them into smaller dice than called for, and let it simmer. It is amazing over vanilla ice cream: The flavor of the quince really comes alive when balanced with the creaminess of ice cream or another dish.

Delightful! Used it on ice cream, and look forward to having the leftovers on breakfast fruit or cereal. Recipe can easily be halved or quartered -- a good thing, quinces costing about $1.70 each (about 1/2 lb.) in my part of the world.

A fragrant and delicious compote! The vanilla really complements the flavor of the quince. I haven't tried the accompanying mascarpone cheesecake, but I imagine that the compote would pair with it nicely. I can understand why the quince is sometimes referred to as fruit of the gods....
