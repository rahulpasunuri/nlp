I LOVE this recipe. Wonderful melding of flavors. I love fresh herbs, and, contrary to a previous reviewer, I think that the finely chopped rosemary MAKES this dish.

ok, this is a very tasty recipie,BUT. if you want to do it right you have to make your own caponata it may take longer but its worth it. im also not nuts about the rosemary but overall a good mix of tastes
