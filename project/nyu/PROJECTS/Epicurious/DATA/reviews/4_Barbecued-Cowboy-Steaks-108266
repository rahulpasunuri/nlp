Nice. Easy and tasty. I added an eighth of cayenne pepper to the dry rub and briskly rubbed the steak after cooking with a piece of garlic to add more zest. Also, patting it lightly with canola oil is a good way to brown the outside, then finish it on an indirect grill to cook slowly and preserve the succulence.

I used this rub all the time. On steaks, prime rib, etc. You can add some cayenne if you like it a little spicy - it is a great rub!

No fork rating because I didn't QUITE follow the recipe: I used 6 small strip steaks (3 1/2 lb.) and grilled over hickory charcoal, without the smoking step. There was just enough spice mixture to coat my 6 steaks on both sides. This rub was GOOD. Everyone was "mmm"ing throughout the meal. I couldn't really tell that there was any coffee involved, but the garlic-paprika-pepper-thyme action was great. I'll be making this again!

This is the second time I have made this. First time did it on the grill as written and we were very pleased. This time, seared them in a VERY hot skillet to make a crust and they were to die! We honestly think this is one of the best steaks we have ever eaten. I threw a little kosher salt in the pan before searing and made the crust even more flavorful. Didnt need much else, just a big glass of Syrah and our appetites!

Increddible flavor! I used the rub in this recipe and grilled boneless rib steaks on my gas grill. The flavors are intense, but not over powering. My husband loved it, and said it was probably the best steak he's eaten. I will definitely make this rub again and possibly use it on my holiday prime rib.

I used a rub without the coffee, but had the butcher cut 2 1/2 inch thick bone in rib eyes. I marinated the meat in a little red wine and garlic for a day in the fridge, then applied the rub and kept the meat cool until the Weber was really hot with hickory chunks added. A quick sear on the hot side before moving them to the cool side, tossing in a bunch of rosemary branches, created a great crust with a medium rare interior. Topped them a little butter, olive oil, and lemon. One steak per couple. Rave reviews from talented chefs. Take the meat off earlier than you think - at 125 degrees. With all that heat it continues to cook quite a bit while resting. Doing it again next month for our dinner club. Looking forward to the practice sessions.

This spice rub is wonderful. The coffe adds a charred (but not burned) flavored that is fabulous. I found that there is no wiggle room on the thickness of the steaks...they must be thick or the spice rub ends up too salty for my taste.

This is the best steak that I have ever done. It is good infact, that my sister is flying me to upstate Vermont from San Francisco to cook for a party. I use a rib roast and divide it into several sections which makes it easier to cook for a crowd. Pricy, but well worth it.

My experience cooking this for the second time last night was interesting, for it was not near as good as the first time (I goofed up managing the flame.) Last night it was just good: last week it was easily the best beef I had ever cooked, and probably ever eaten. So it just goes to show you the recipe by itself can only do so much. But, man, the first time it was UNBELIEVABLY good.

Rating: 4
I always read the reviews but sometimes take them with a grain of salt -heh- particularly when people say "too rich" and "too salty." Most recipes have NEVER been "too" for me. But I have to agree with previous reviewers that the salt needs to be cut back a bit. If it is too salty for me, it is too salty for most I believe. First time I have ever said that! But otherwise a great and flavorful rub. Perfect for a meaty steak. Delish!

This recipe is the only way we cook steaks now. I probably have used it hundreds of times and each time, the steaks turn out delicious. Moist, tender, just fabulous. A tip: If there's some leftover rub, freeze it. It tastes just as good as "fresh". And decaf coffee tastes as good too. Try it -- you'll be hooked!

I have to admit, this is 'hands down' the very best steak treatment my family and I have ever encountered. It soundly dethroned our previously favorite BBQed steak recipe - which was sauce based. Without a doubt, this is the finest 'dry marinade' steak preparation out there. Everyone who has tasted these steaks loves them!

Excellent flavor. I made this rub up a day in advance. While I was on the way home from work my wife decided to go ahead and apply the rub to the steak and grill it - only she didn't know that was the amount of rub for four steaks and applied enough of the rub for 3 steaks to the one steak! Boy was that a powerful taste. But a surprisingly good taste! I give it four forks because of the flavor. I could tell that this was gonna be a winner if the right amount of rub was used. We will do it exactly the way the recipe calls for next time.

Since I work in an upscale steakhouse that serves a delicious coffee-rubbed sirloin, I was very curious about how this recipe would stand up next to the one I am already so fond of. This one is the more superior version, no doubt about it! The smoke from the mesquite imparts an unbelievable flavor to the meat, and the flavors in the rub are well balanced. (Also, we always use a charcoal grill with regular Kingsford charcoal-- the mesquite smoke chips already add huge flavor).We have tried this recipe with a boneless New York strip as well as the bone-in ribeye, and it has been delicious both ways, but the marbling in the ribeye adds terrific flavor. I recommend a nice Petite Syrah or Malbec with this dish. This recipe is worthy of entertaining with--it will blow your guests away!

Rating: 4
This stuff is fabulous! I only made the rub, since I don't have a grill, and for once I didn't want to tweak the recipe! The thyme gives the steak a little zing, and the coffee gives it a deep smoky/caramel flavor. I used kosher salt, and the salt level was perfect. Served the steaks with cucumber salad, steamed broccoli w/ parmesan, and baked potatoes with all the fixings. What a feast!

Rating: 4
The seasoning mix makes the flavor of the steak really POP. I too was apprehensive about using coffee in the rub, but the combination of the seasonings is perfect together. This makes an easy and delicious dinner for both friends and family. My family won't eat steak without the cowboy seasoning now!

At the last minute, had to forgo the mesquite...long story. But the flavor of the rub is a winner. Next time, we'll do the whoe thing.

Since finding this in July 2003 issue, I have used this rub every time I grill steaks and have altered the recipe several times depending on what's in the spice cupboard. Dried oregano works in place of thyme; 1 tsp of table salt in place of coarse; smoked paprika instead of sweet. It's always a hit, even with slight adjustments. I think a key ingredient in the rub is the coffee. I have left the rub on overnight in fridge but I think it's important to let the steaks sit at room temp. for an hour before grilling. Works on BBQ pork tenderloin too.

Make this recipe because it is not only delicious, but it's fun to watch people's reactions when you tell them coffee grounds are in the rub. The smoke adds such a good flavor, and if you combine the recipe with good quality beef, you will have a winner. This recipe is easy, and I suggest you try it.

The ground coffee beans in this rub made us go "hmmmmm" at first, but we just had to try it. This is the best steak rub we've ever had! The coffee beans bring a depth of flavor to the steaks you can't imagine. I now make this rub by the pound and it never goes to waste. Friends and neighbors beg us to make these steaks, 'cause they're just that good! You've gotta try it to believe it!!!

My family owns a cattle ranch, so we eat a lot of beef. I have tinkered with and tried many, many different seasonings, both commercially sold and ones I have concocted. This recipe is absolutely the BEST SEASONING we have ever had on a steak, bar-none! This recipe was prepared for a group of 15 last weekend at the ranch by guests from California. Everyone raved about the spice and I came straight home to look up the recipe. I will be making this seasoning in a larger quantity to season our steaks from here on out!

OMG!!! Wow, this rub has more flavor and depth than any other I've tried. I believe it is the coffee (and I used freshly ground good coffee), that gives this rub it's special quality.

I can't wait for summer and the wood chips . . .

I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a sure bet. This is a very good recipe and easy too. I followed the recipe with two exceptions. First, I had to substitute chopped garlic (it's all I had in the house). And Second, I used the entire rub on only two ribeyes. Delicious!! My husband loved it and I look forward to serving this to friends.

THE BEST!!!! My husband and I are now addicted to this rub. Some of the comments about it being too salty might be from people who did not use Kosher salt. It is perfect for us and our friends. If you have the new rave, smoked Spanish sweet paprika, that even makes it better. We throw mesquite chips that have been soaked on our gas grill and end up with the juiciest, tastiest, steak you have ever tasted. Rub is also great on pork and even makes a thick cut boneless center cut loin chop juicy. I don't know what it is about this rub, but everything comes out juicier than any other method I have tried. Enjoy!

Very easy and quite tasty. I tried this recipe because of coffee addition and was curious to find out what the addition did to the rub itself. Surprisingly I could not really taste the coffee once the steaks were grilled. I thought the rub gave beautiful color to the end result. This one I'll keep for future grilling.

More like 2 1/2, but we will definitely make it again. Less salt next time, though. I am a saltaholic and even I thought this was a little too much. The coffee gives the rub a really neat flavor.

I have an intestinal disorder and I left our steaks out... gee, I'm still here to write the review, guess it's okay to do it, hmm.

this spice rub is great. the first time i used it, my wife said it was the best steak she had had in years. i use garlic granules rather than garlic powder, thyme leaves instead of ground, and give it a few quick pulses in the food processor. it is great on hamburgers or any other grilled beef.

Who Cares, who are you kidding? I challenge you to document one case of illness from a decent steak from a decent butcher, prepared and stored well, that is left on the counter for an hour before grilling. NO way. (previous post: To Blaighe: Some people rate the recipe but don't leave a comment. You can do one without the other.)

Good method for grilled steaks. To Blaighe: You base your recipe decisions on what the yahoos who post to this website think? And to Cook From Who Cares: This isn't chicken, it's beef (and not Tartare). A cold steak left out for an hour is not a problem. In fact, it's a good thing. Room temperature meats make for better "searing," since it's not going lower the temperature of the cooking surface as drastically. Better searing means jucier and more flavorful meat. Also, the warmer temp allows the spice rub to really do its thing.

This recipe is good, but I would cut the amount of salt in the rub in half. I like salt, but it was WAY too salty. A lot of the rub had to be scraped off after tasting the steak. I also used instant espresso, and that worked well. With the reduction in salt, it'll probably end up being a 3 rating instead of a 2.

I am so surprised to see that only 67% would make this recipe again. I hope I can at least bring it up to 68% and my 1% is a RESOUNDING yes! I thought this was a fantastic rub. I made these steaks for company. And also got the "best steaks I've ever had" comment. I didn't read too far down the list, but I thought they were absolutely fantastic and will make them again and again. Of course, you need to get a good piece of meat. I went with the recommended rib steaks. The coffee added great depth. And as I had accidentally overcrowded the grill, I had a little fire, which ended up perfectly charring the steaks. So they were also cooked perfectly. All in all, a GREAT experience.

My husband said this was possibly the best steak he has ever had, and that is really saying a lot. We only grill on hardwood charcoal, so the smoking and cooking method really works well. Not sure how it would work on a gas grill. As for someone "dissing" garlic powder, give it a rest. I am a professional chef and there are many great uses for garlic powder (a dry meat rub being one of them.)

Garlic powder? GARLIC POWDER???? Yech.

If you have a gas grill, put the soaking-wet chips on an old cake pan you don't need for cakes anymore, and set it directly on top of the flame spreader (not on the grill rack) on the side of the barbeque that DOESN'T have the steaks on it. (Don't use foil, it will burn through.) Set that side of the gas grill on "low". Close the lid and let the smoke fill the barbeque. Have a water-filled spray bottle handy in case the chips burst into flame. You want them to smolder, not flame.

USING A GAS GRILL...you can purchase a small cast iron smoker box to hold the wood chips from your local Home Depot. Soak the chips per the recipe, and place box on your ceramic coal. Works just the same.
