I loved this. I didn't even realize, until I was talking with a friend on a "no dairy or pork" diet, that this was actually pretty healthy. Very flavorful. My husband ate 3/4 of the fish and he doesn't even like fish much. I put a ring of sauted spinach around the outside of the plate and then served the fennel & onions in the middle of that with the tomato sauce covered sea bass on top. Fabulous! Looked really pretty with the dark green spinach, too.

Absolutely exceptional. I read prior reviews and to avoid soggy fennel, I removed fennel from pan after brief braise, then reduced the liquid and recombined before preparing with fish for roasting. This recipe could easily be adapted for do-ahead prep expecially for parties. Here's what I'll try next time: prepare tomato sauce ahead & chill; prepare fennel ahead & chill; and to prep for a dinner party -- assemble chilled ingredients (layer fennel/bass/tomato) into a roasting pan; cover. Then time the baking to complete when you need it.

My husband and I liked this dish, but I would do things different next time. I used 2 Tbls of white wine in both the tomato sauce and the fennel broth.. good addition. I only used 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, and that was still too much. It over powered the tomato sauce. I used fire roasted tomatoes as suggested from a previous review and that was a good change as well. I took the fish out of the oven after only 15 min. The fish was still slightly over done, so a shorter cook time there. Also for a little "crunch" to the fennel only Braise it for 15min instead of 20. I didn't mind the very soft fennel however, so I may do that the same. Served it with multi grain pilaf and asparagus. Wonderful flavor despite the excess heat. My husband even liked and he isn't a fennel fan.

delicious! I tweaked it by adding olives and capers..and left out the anchovies. Good with a bit of white whine thrown in the mix, too.

I made this with cod loins and it was delicious. I had to search for the fennel (not readily available this time of year) but it is a necessary ingredient to the recipe's success. I couldn't find anchovy paste so bought a can of anchovies and smashed one to substitute. Amazingly, this was not too salty! Will definitely make again.

This was excellent. I admit to having added some basil and oregano. Bass is expensive and will make it next time with haddock or halibut.

I've made the recipe many times. It's become a favorit "quick meal" at my house. To address the previous reviewer's comment about bland taste: try flavored tomatoes instead of plain. I use Muir Glen Fire Roasted canned tomatoes. Delicious! And serve it with polenta ... those rolls you can buy in the deli or refrigerator case; slice them and saute in a little olive oil on both sides til browned and heated through.

BF is on diet kick, so I tried this in the hopes that the fish would turn out miraculous and tasty. Frankly, it tasted like diet food, nothing special. Not offensive, but just blah. All one texture of soft with very little interesting flavor. Best part was sopping up the juice with sourdough bread. I realize I'm hoping to turn low fat fish into something fantastic, but I really think there's better ways than this to feel satisfied with diet food.

This is a great recipe! The sauce is wonderful! I made it for my husband who is practically a gourmet chef, (I myself am not much of a cook). I found this recipe easy to prepare, and he absolutely loved it! Of all the recipes that I've been preparing from this site lately, this is the one he can't stop raving about. He just can't get that sauce out of his mind. He is eager to try the sauce on many other things like meatloaf. Seems like it could be pretty versatile. The only thing I added was extra red pepper flakes and crushed one of our own dried hot peppers from our garden, since we like our food pretty hot. A definite keeper! Served with brown rice and asparagus as another reviewer suggested, which was a great combination. Very lovely meal.

We really enjoyed it......will definitely make again. I followed the instructions because I had everything on hand.

This is a good recipe. Since sea bass has such a nice delicate buttery taste I didn't feel the urge to add common herbs. I did use fresh tomatoes and added thin sliced potatoes to the braised vegies the last few minutes before adding the fish and baking. Delicious.

Used talapia and fresh tomatoes instead and loved the dish's flavour as is. Served as a light late night supper with Yukon Gold mash. Passed it on to friends! Delicious and simple.

I am commenting w/o rating because I don't believe in rating if one has significantly changed the recipe. That said, sea bass was not available so I substituted halibut; I added garlic, red wine, balsamic vinegar and capers to the (organic diced w/ italian herbs)canned tomatoes. Fresh herbs would have been better. It was pretty good, but at least for halibut I would shorten the cooking time a few minutes. The braised fennel really accents the flavors. I would rate the recipe as I made it as 3 forks, the recipe as written seems as though it would be bland.

This was as excellent as everyone describes. Really sublime flavor. I used halibut because I couldn't get sea bass and had great results. I'll look forward to making it with sea bass next time. I didn't add any additional herbs; I thought the fennel fronds perfumed the dish nicely on their own.

Very nice. I, like many reviewers made a few changes to this recipe. It just seems to beg to be tinkered with. I added about a teaspoon of Pernod, and some garlic. When I make this again, and I will, I will braise the fennel half the time; it would have been a nice contrast if it were a little crunchy. I also wouldn't use whole tomatoes. Instead crushed would have been easier and richer. I served it with asparagus, and a saffron rice pilaf with almonds, apricots and currents (also on this site).

Out of necessity, I made this dish with chicken instead of fish and it was delicious -- I am eager to try it again with fish! I pan-seared the unbreaded chicken breasts for a few minutes before baking, in order to ensure they were completely cooked. I added mushrooms, garlic, black olive paste, and herbs (thyme and oregano) to the tomato sauce and it was delicious. Even the picky 14-year-old I shared it with had seconds!

This was fabulous. I had to substitute perch for sea bass because they don't have sea bass down here. I would definitely add more red pepper flakes next time - the tomato sauce wasn't so spicy... But I definitely recommend this as it is pretty easy to make and tastes fantastic!

Fantastic! Like other reviewers, I added basil and oregano to the tomato sauce. Served it with brown rice and steamed asparagus and it was a lot of food for two people, but in a good way. Such an easy meal for company. I look forward to making it again.

This was a very easy dish and extremely delicious. I used a 24 oz can of whole tomatoes and I am glad I did there would not have been enough tomato sauce otherwise.

Wonderful and easy to make. Looking forward to making it again. I added oregano, basil and more red pepper flakes.

This was very good. I halved the recipe which worked out fine. I agree with the reviewer who suggested using some fresh basil and oregano to spice it up. I think it needed something more to enhance the flavor.

Delicious and so easy. Followed directions exactly except added a bit more red pepper flakes as we like it quite spicy. Served it with rice to absorb the wonderful juices.

We thought this was great. A straightforward recipe with wonderful results. Used groupeer, and it was wonderful. Fire-roasted tomatoes, as used by a prior reviewer, were a nice touch. Certainly not too spicy, but had sensational flavor.

Made this last night for a weekend dinner. It was quite good, but that seemed mostly due to the delicious sea bass; the spicy tomato sauce was only OK, but quite easy to prepare. It could have used some fresh basil and fresh oregano to spice it up a bit more. The fennel is a bit touchy; as one of the earlier reviewers suggested, it is easy to overcook. I will likely make this (or a variation of it) again.

This was REALLY good. If you liked it, also see Red Snapper Veracruz for similar wow points. I added too much broth then overcooked the fennel trying to evaporate, but it was still wonderful and I am looking forward to the next go round.

Fantastic! Rave reviews from my husband and brother in-law, definetely will make again and again. I probably used a little more olive oil than suggested, but that's all. The cooking temp and time was perfect. All round great recipe and very light. Perfect.

Excellent! Easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly, EXCEPT ... couldn't get the "plain" Muir Glen tomatoes that I usually buy, so used "Fire Roasted" variety instead. Divided between two individual casserole pans ... one for tonight and one for tomorrow. (Baked both and will reheat the second.) Don't let the "spicy" in the title scare you ... I used 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper and it wasn't spicy at all. Served with polenta .. the kind you buy in a "roll" and slice; sauteed slices in a little bit of olive oil. Absolutely delicious! Good for a weekday night ... but also good enough flavor for entertaining.

Since my husband has been on Weight-Watchers, I have been on the constant lookout for low-fat, low-calorie dishes that do NOT contain chicken- this one is a great change of pace. I ommitted the olive oil altogether, and used cooking spray instead to save calories. (He's lost 38 pounds since January 13, 2003 , and this recipe has become one of his favorites!)

Another great fish recipe from epicurious, and another great way to use fennel. This will be added to the regular rotation.

I agree with the cook from Iowa: this is a very good recipe. I used a little more olive oil than the amounts suggested in the recipe, but it was not necessary. This is a winner: bravo!

This dish is one of the most delicious fish recipes we've ever prepared. Didn't have to change a thing.
