In response to Cook from New York (four years ago), About.com explains that "U10" scallops means Under 10 (to the pound), so these are pretty huge and probably won't be overcooked in a few minutes. I haven't made them yet, so no further comment.

I did not make this recipe exactly as the directions say. I mixed yams with the plantains. I used soy chorizo and I mixed it with the mash. I omited the raisens, cilantro, and pistachios and I added cumin and garlic to the mash. Essentially, I took this dish and turned it into a cuban mofongo. I'd also like to point out that there is nothing wrong with calling this recipe fu fu bc it doesnt have yams, as one reviewer pointed out. This is actually closer to mofongo, which is a version of fu fu that is made in the carribbean. It has directly roots from African fu fu.

I must comment on this dish..I was looking for a fufu recipe and found this so I decided to try it. Typically fufu is made with the not so ripe plantain (I think either the green or yellow). This fufu recipe was to die for. Its exotic. Fufu gets a little hard as leftovers but its still good. JUst try the fufu, you'll love it. I used not exaclty black bananas..mine were yellow with a little black. (Not as sweet as the all black ones.

I don't much like it when people review recipes they haven't made, but from reading this I had to say something. Why would you cook the scallops, then add the chorizo and cook "several more minutes"? Doesn't that sound like a recipe for tough, rubbery, overcooked scallops?

Fu Fu is typically a west african mash of white yams with some plantains. It takes a long time and some labor to mash and boil everything. This isn't so much fu fu as mashed plantains. Not as poetic, I guess.

In response to Mr. Garkey's query, I would assume that what is implied is very ripe green plantains (black on the outside), just as one would use very ripe bananas in making banana bread.

This recipe was so good (and easy), we thought we were dining in a five star restaurant. Seriously the different flavors were wonderful. This is one recipe I won't forget.

You have Black plaintains, should be green, yes?
