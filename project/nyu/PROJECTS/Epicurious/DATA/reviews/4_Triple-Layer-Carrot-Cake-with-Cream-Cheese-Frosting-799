This cake is absolutely disgusting. I love carrot cake, but this is the grossest carrot cake I've ever had. Please don't waste your time with this recipe. It is horrible. I registered just so I could write this review. Save your time and effort.

I must be a traditionalist because I thought this recipe was fantastic. I made it for my non-pumpkin-pie loving family for Thanksgiving. They loved it. I have used carrot cake recipes before that were bland and this was definitely not bland. I did not add raisins as my boyfriend is not a fan. I didn't do anything to replace the sweetness from the raisins. There was plenty of sugar. I did not adjust the oil at all. The triple layer was a great presentation. The cream cheese frosting was perfectly traditional as well. I loved the cake and received raving reviews.

This recipe is amazing. I'm always being asked to bring it for coworkers birthdays. I do make a couple slight modifications. I use extra raisins and pecans. I also don't use all the powdered sugar in the frosting but make it to taste, usually using about 1/2 of what it calls for. I also make extra frosting b/c its so yummy and I think more is needed.

I made this recipe with a few modifications and got rave reviews from family & friends who all claim to be Carrot Cake lovers. My modifications: 1 c white sugar & 1/2 c brown sugar 1 c veg oil 1/2 rounded c drained crushed pineapple 1 3/4 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp nutmeg 1 tsp ground cloves 1/2 c raisins soaked in dark rum (drain off rum before using) Be careful to not over bake.

An absolutely wonderful carrot cake, far and away one of my favorites to make. Only complaint is that the carrots can take a while to slice, but that's what food processors are for.

I used this as a gluten free recipe and substituted the flour for the kind I use. It was way too much baking powder/soda for my taste! I did not like the way this one converted at all! Usually they come out just like the real thing but this one, just not sure what to make of it. I thought it seemed like a lot to put in to begin with but went with what the recipe called for...

I agree with a previous poster, Martha Stewart has a fabulous carrot cake recipe. However, the request I received was for a "plain and traditional" carrot cake, so I thought that probably ruled out the fresh ginger, orange zest and candied carrot ribbons (although it's exactly what I'll be doing for my own birthday!). On the advice of other reviewers, I reduced the fat to one cup. I did not replace the extra fat with anything, and it turned out fine. I have no idea where an extra half cup of oil would have gone. If I made this again, I'd reduce the fat by a little more still. I found it on the bland side, so I would suggest adding more cinnamon, and maybe some ground ginger to the batter. All in all, I think "plain and traditional" fits this one well. I'll add it to my repertoire for a decent standby cake, but in my mind it's certainly not the over-the-top sort of dessert that other people described it as. IMHO

Love this cake! I have made it about 5 times now. I do what other reviews have done: 1 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. I also throw in a can of crushed pineapple, but am careful to drain so that it doesn't throw off the liquid ratio. I also sprinkle toasted pecans on top and my huz says that really makes it.

Best carrot cake I have ever had!

Disappointing, lacking flavor, I couldn't smell it even after it finished baking. Although the cake seems light it's also quite oily. I hate that I used all those ingredients and spent time shredding a pound of carrots for this cake. I doubt this one will get frosted. I prefer frosting a carrot cake that's a bit more dense than this one and has a lot more flavor.

It was a blast with my friend!!! I used 1 cup oil 1/2 cup apple sauce. Delicious!!!!

This carrot cake did not taste good. It tasted very oily and the spice was too mild. I was very disappointed. I chose this recipe because it had high reviews from lots of other people but it did not stand up to the expectation. Go to marthastewart.com & use her three layer carrot cake recipe, it is far superior to this one.

This was the first carrot cake I ever made and so I was not very confident. However, when I brought it to work, everyone was very impressed with how it looked, and two people told me it was the BEST carrot cake they had ever had. My only alteration to the recipe was that I added more sugar to the icing as it was too runny. I didn't use it all in the end as it made quite a bit.

Amazing carrot cake, made it for my non-sweet-tooth boyfriend for his birthday and it was a huge hit. Did rearrange the spices a bit by using only 1 tsp of baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves and only 1 cup of oil. Adding the cloves made it a bit more tastier and zingy. The frosting I only used 3 cups of confectioner sugar but it was very runny when trying to spread so did most of it in and out of the fridge...Absolutely would make again!!

Excellent recipe that will definitely become my go-to for carrot cake and cream cheese frosting. I made a few modifications for personal preferences and because it was for a 1-year-old's birthday! I subbed fresh applesauce for the oil to reduce fat and calories. I did not add pecans or raisins (I would if they were for adults). I reduced the powdered sugar in the frosting from 4c to 3c because I like it more cheesy, less sweet. Instead of a triple layer cake, I made cupcakes and got 30. They freeze (unfrosted) perfectly. For the cupcakes, I baked at 325 for 25 minutes.

I've made this cake a few times to absolutely rave reviews!!! Cake was moist and flavorful. I added a bit of orange extract to the frosting which was a nice touch. I may fool with it in the future to reduce the calories (subs. splenda for sugar and applesauce for oil). Certainly will be a go-to recipe from now on.

Rating: 4
I used melted butter instead of oil; I soaked the raisins in rum while I was making the cake; I used Allspice because I was out of nutmeg... and I made it in a lasagna pan because I didn't have enough cake pans. It was so delicious that everyone at the birthday party went into paroxysms of joy. Note: there was more frosting than I needed given that it was single pan rather than three layers, but no one complained about the very thick layer of frosting!

This recipe has been our yearly tradition as an Easter dessert. When my daughter was small, I'd cut two giant teeth marks out of it and say that the Easter bunny loves the carrot cake, too!

This is a good and impressive looking carrot cake with excellent flavor. I put roasted almonds around the side and used orange zest as decoration on the top of the cake. Both additions add a flavor that goes well with the recipe. While those who consumed the cake were in awe of its flavor, I continue my search for the perfect carrot cake. The frosting for this recipe was a bit runnier than I had expected.

As the saying goes, "If it ain't broken, don't fix it", and that's true of this recipe as well! I'll be making this for the umptyumpth time this week as the requested birthday cake for my daughter and feel absolutely no need to alter an outstanding recipe. I'll admit to wishing I could cut back on the calories in it, but being a purist, I choose not to tamper with perfection. To make a professional drop-dead presentation, I cover the sides in finely chopped pecans and decorate the top with Martha Stewart's Petite Marzipan Carrots recipe...surprises me every time that I created such a beautiful cake! This was actually one of the two requested cakes that I made for my daughter's wedding! (Then I decorated it with marzipan flowers I made to match her bouquet.)And being carrot cake,it's cute how people think they're eating something "healthy"!!! Truly a perfect cake!

This is a fantastic, moist cake that is not too light, nor too dense. It has a classic carrot cake crumb and is very flavourful. I made the following changes to the recipe as I like flavourful foods: 1 1/3 cups vegetable, rather than 1 1/2 cups; 4 jumbo eggs, rather than 4 large eggs; 1 3/4 teaspoons cinnamon, rather than 1 teaspoon; 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg, rather than 3/4 teaspoon; 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves; 1 cup raisins, rather than 1/2 cup. I divided the batter between two 9 inch square pans and baked for 45 minutes. I filled and frosted it with a lemon cream cheese frosting, which provided a really nice contrast to the carrot cake spice. Yum!

Excellent, easy, flavorful. Added 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves, omitted raisins and added more pecans. Definitely will put this one on the main list to make again.

My favorite cake is carrot cake and have tried many recipes. This is the best so far. Very moist and flavorful. However, I was surprise with the amount of sugar and vegetable oil in the recipe. So, I reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons. And also reduced the oil to 1 and 1/4 cups which turned out perfectly. Will make this again.

Excellent carrot cake recipe! Moist, flavorful and had a nice crumb texture...not dense or heavy at all. I paired this cake with the "Cream Cheese-Lemon Zest Frosting" also found on this site.

STOP! Don't make another carrot cake. This is the one. It's amazingly moist and delicious. The frosting is perfect. My mother-in- law complimented me on this cake and that IS RARE as she is a wonderful baker. Like others, I substituted some of the oil for applesauce and kicked up the spices a bit. Otherwise, I made as directed. I won't even bother with another recipe for carrot cake. This is a keeper. Enjoy!

An exceptional recipe! No fail every time. A huge crowd pleaser. Took less cooking time though...about 40 minutes. Found the icing a bit sweet so I reduced the icing sugar until I achieved the desired sweetness (about 2-1/2 cups). The only carrot cake recipe I use now!

The cake it self was GREAT! I increased amount of raisins & nuts by 1/4 cup. Added a 1 1/2 lbs of carrots and used walnuts instead of pecans. The frosting was a bit too sweet. I also added another 8oz package of cream cheese so it wouldn't be as sweet, but next time I will just use 1/2 the amount of powdered sugar as recommended. Used two 9" cake pans and cooked for 55 min. Will def make this again!

Outstanding! I think this is the first time that I have awarded Four Forks to an Epicurious recipe. I just made it for the first time for my husband's birthday dinner (it's his favorite kind of cake). It was wonderfully light, moist and tasty, and everyone raved and had second helpings. I followed the recipe exactly except that I divided the batter into 2 pans instead of 3 and baked it for about 45 minutes. Since this was just a two-layer cake, I halved the frosting and added some grated lemon zest which improved the taste. Relatively easy to make.

This recipe was AWESOME. My boyfriend loves carrot cake & I hadn't found a recipe yet that really did the trick for him. This had him reaching for 2nds VERY quickly : ) This is very moist & delicious flavor! Huge hit. Will have to find an excuse to make again soon! A few modifications based on what we had on hand. I used 1 cup brown sugar & 1 cup white sugar. Also, used 1/2 cup vegetable oil, with 1 cup homemade applesauce. I made cupcakes instead & ended up with about 24. I realized you need to fill the muffin tins almost completely, as the batter doesn't rise very much. One suggestion -- keep mixing the batter as you fill the muffin tins (otherwise the raisins & pecans sink to the bottom!) Frosting was good too -- not overly sweet : ) Mine came out a little runny... not sure if it was the weather, or if I need to change the proportions. Overall: Rockin' good carrot cake : )

I've made this recipe three times in the past three weeks, and it only gets better! Some things to note... I used two 10" cake pans (all I had), and found that if I pulled them out of the oven when the toothpick was clean they were almost too moist (kind of pudding-like... weird!). So I overcooked them for 10+ minutes and they came out perfect. For the frosting - I found that using Philadelphia cream cheese vs. generic store brand made a HUGE difference... stick with the good stuff! This recipe is awesome, enjoy!

This has become the standard in my cake-hating family. "I don't really like cake, except maybe that carrot cake." This recipe knocks 'em dead every time. I made using 9" pans and only two layers. This pleased even the pickiest eaters. A definite all-star.

Good recipe. I used half cinnamon apple sauce in lieu of all the oil. Omitted the raisins. Took other cooks' advice and gradually added the powdered sugar to the icing. I had my culinary school grad brother taste test each addition. He agreed that frosting is indeed supposed to be sweet, and I ended up using the full four cups.

Glancing at the epicurious.com app for my iPod, I thought the prep said 375 degrees, however don't be fooled, it calls for 325. Totally discouraged that I over-baked these delicious layers intended for my son's 3rd b-day party, I was ready to throw them out. My mom, however, suggested I wrap them in cling wrap and put them in the fridge. They were edible, she said, just maybe not a good idea to serve. Well, two days later at the party, I unwrapped these (my sister was complaining that there wasn't a 'real' cake as I had replaced the b-day cake with a giant frosted b-day cookie from a local baker). After having basked in the condensation of the cling wrap in the fridge, the cake layers looked yummy, so my mother-in-law whipped up the frosting. I received loads of compliments on the moist and delicious cake, even in the face of the baking debacle. This is a testament to the perfection of the yummy recipe! I omitted the raisins, replacing with about 1/3 cup additional grated carrots. Highly recommended.

Made this as a dessert for a holiday dinner. The only changes I made were to substitute the raisins and nuts with a handful of semisweet chocolate chips. Also did not add the full four cups of sugar to the frosting. Instead added 3 cups then added more to taste. Would definitely make again.

the cake was great. i followed the suggestions of many other reviewers and substituted half of the oil with applesauce. while it baked up springy and delicate, even considering all of the fruit, it didn't have enough fat. next time i'll try either all oil or melted butter. also, i added vanilla (1 tsp) to the batter, and used 3.5 cups of powdered sugar for the icing.

I've made this recipe twice and my families demolished it by the next day both times. I only had 2 spring form pans so that's what I use, and I had to reduce the amount of frosting because it was too sweet if I used it all. Next time I will make 1/2 the frosting recipe. So delicious - my favorite carrot cake recipe!

OMG this recipe is amazing!! I love Carrot cake and decided it was about high time that I got around to making one myself and based on the high rating I chose this one, and boy am I sure glad that I did! It was suprisingly moist and the frosting complemented the cake perfectly! I did make a few adjustments however. Unfortunately, I did not have the 9 inch cake pans so instead I used two 8-inch pans and cut the cooled cake into 5 layers. I did increase my frosting by another one half serving to accomodate the additional layers. I did not have enough vegetable oil on hand, and therefore used 3/4 cup vegetable oil and 3/4 cup cinnamon apple sauce. I also used chopped walnuts instead of pecans. I can't wait to make this again!

I made this cake for a Baby shower. So, this cake was reviewed by myself and many others. The cake is outstanding and I would not think twice to make again.

Over all the cake was nice but it needed a little tewaking. I used condensed milk instead of oil with the sugar. I also added a bit of vanilla extract. I pulsed the pecans and dry ingridents with sweet coconut and dried pineapple. At the end I added apple sauce, carrot puree,shreaded carrots and left out the raisins. The frosting was way too sweet so I only used 1 1/2 C of powdered sugar and toasted some dried sweet coconut and put that on the frosting.

The best carrot cake I've had - it was moist and flavorful! A couple of cautions...My cakes were done early, so make sure to keep an eye on them.

I make this cake with a few 'tweaks'. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and added 1 cup of brown sugar, reduced oil to 1 cup and used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1 small can crushed pineapple in juice. I also added 3/4 tsp. of ground cloves and toasted the pecans. I used parchment paper in the bottom of the pans and baked the layers for 40 minutes. For the frosting, I reduced the vanilla to 2 tsp. and added 1/2 real maple syrup. This cake was fabulous. I shared it with other chefs that said it was the best carrot cake they've ever eaten.

I am still thinking about this cake almost a week after it is gone- delicious! My first carrot cake and first layer cake...I had a little trouble with a layer breaking apart. I put as the bottom layer and tried to patch it up but it ended up making the cake sink in the middle. I only put 2 cups of powdered sugar in the frosting and it thickened up too much to put more in, and it still made way more frosting than needed, even for a cream cheese frosting lover. However, this cake was absolutely fabulous despite looking a little haphazard. I did use cake flour which lightened the texture a little and made for a beautiful crumb.

I made this for my son-in-law. Carrot cake is his favorite. It was excellent. I was hoping there would be some left for the next day and there was because this makes a really nice size cake. I used toasted macadamia nuts in place of pecans and left out the raisins. A winner!

I made this carrot cake for a pot luck dinner and it was a hit!

This cake is always a hit with people. I've made it many times with the following alterations. 1) Decrease oil to 1 cup 2) Add 1/2 cup of applesauce OR 8oz can crushed pineapple 3) Decrease sugar to 1 1/2 cup 4) Increase nuts and (golden)raisins to 1 cup each 5) I dump all the ingredients into one bowl and mix them with a wooden spoon at the same time -- easier, faster, and is works perfectly fine. The cake is moist without being oily and is not too sweet when you eat it with the frosty.

Would give it 5 forks if that were an option!!! Substituted 1 cup applesauce with 1/4 cup oil in place of the 1.5 cups of oil stated in the recipe. Also used 1 cup of oat flour with 1 cup regular unbleached flour. I added an extra 3/4 cup chopped walnuts to the mix and doubled the spices. Lastly, inspired by an earlier reviewer, I soaked the raisins in Grand Marnier for about 5 hours prior to cooking. Also used some of the left over Grand Marnier in the frosting (but watch it, a little goes a loooong way in the frosting!). Used fresh lemon juice in the frosting to cut some of the sweetness. Cake was still moist and to-die-for 3 days later!!!

I thought this recipe was supposed to be easy, but grating the carrots was a real pain. I stopped grating and I followed the suggestion of one user: I shredded the carrots with my Cuisinart shredding disk and then used the Cuisinart chopping blade to chop the shredded carrots. The consistency was exactly the same as if I had grated the carrots and I was done in a flash!

I made this cake for a friend. Carrot cake is his favorite. I have never made one before. This cake is so easy. I was not sure about the the three layers, I thought they were too thin when I divided the whole thing, but the cake came out perfect and delicious!! I did not have raisins, so I skipped them. I also modified the spices, I used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of Allspice. My friend (an expert in carrot cakes) LOVED it, as the rest of us did. EXCELLENT!

4 forks for the recipe: Easy, straightforward, delicious. Followed other's recommendations, increased spices to 1 1/2 cinnamon, 1 1/4 nutmeg and used 1 cup oil + 1/2 cup apple sauce. Recipe made 36 cupcakes, baked for 15 minutes. These bake up with a flat top so the cupcake papers can be filled to 3/4 full. Icing was amazing. I made the full amount and only had about 1/2 c. leftover after icing the cupcakes with a large icing tip. Unfortunately that 1/2 cup is now in my belly.

Absolutely delicious. I also enjoy the carrot cake with maple cream cheese frosting on this site, so I added a bit of ginger to the mix when I made this cake. Nothing but raves from everyone who tasted this cake. Will make again!

super easy and a hit with everyone -- even people who claimed they didn't like carrot cake . . . and then had thirds. actually made mini-cupcakes for our son's first birthday -- beware, it makes 100+ cupcakes! but baked for 15 minutes they were perfect. everyone raved.

Rave reviews both times I made this cake. Carrot cake is my mom's favorite and was thus requested a second time for her birthday. The recipe is very easy and as long as you line your pans with greased, wax paper, you'll have a cake that is dead easy to ice and stack into 3 layers. Just keep away from 4-legged friends - our dog found the icing irresistible and managed to lick the whole side of the cake while we were all out for dinner - long story. Suffice to say, this recipe is a winner, highly recommend.

It was the best carrot cake I ever had! It was super easy to make, and the little videos online about how to ice the cake (make a crumb coating first) made it look beautiful too. It was the perfect density and sweetness. I cannot wait for another occasion to make it again! I love to bake and was so proud of it I took photos posted here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/julessilver/3188969512/in/set-72157612401671959/

I made this cake vegan. I subbed the 4 eggs with ½ of a large banana, ¼ cup of vanilla soy yogurt, and 2 eggs worth of egg replacer. I also used a little less sugar, and used ½ brown sugar and ½ white sugar. The cake tasted really good and had some loft (less fluffy than non-vegan, of course) but could have had less sugar and was a little to oily. Next time, Ill try it with less oil and even less sugar. Maybe a total of 1.5 cups of sugar instead of 2 cups. Oh, I also chopped and slow roasted the pecans before adding them to the cake to deepen their flavor. Yum! For vegan frosting, I used 2 sticks of vegan butter and about 2 C of powdered sugar with some vanilla, and about ¼ C of coconut milk, and some dried coconut, and just a hint of salt. This made a really good vegan buttercream. It may have been even better if Id used ½ vegan butter and ½ vegan shortening. However, the buttery frosting wasnt perfect for the already oily cake. Next time Ill try a vegan fake cream cheese frosting. I shied away from that this time because vegan cheese is always weird.

I looooove this carrot cake recipe! It's super easy to make and tastes great. I made this for a group of kids and instead of making it into a three layer cake, I poured the mix into baking cups and made a sort of carrot cake cup cake. It was super easy to serve and eat.

This cake has been a hit every time I have made it! I am now known for my Carrot Cake. I have made a couple of changes to the recipe... Instead of the entire amount of oil, I substitute Apple Sauce. Makes the cake even more moist. I also use half white sugar and half brown sugar. Makes it have a little more depth.

I'm not sure why I'm reviewing this recipe, with 581 people already doing so, but I wanted to add that the cake is SUPER EASY to make and bakes up beautifully in the 3 cake pans. Mine came out of the oven perfectly flat on top, therefore making the stacking and presentation just amazing! It was fun to go out and dig up carrots straight from the garden! I grated mine with my Kitchenaid attachment and it literally took about 20 seconds - fantastically easy! I used 1 c of applesauce in place of 1 cup of oil, added 1 c walnuts to the pecans (both I toasted in the oven first) and added 1/2 c pineapple. I also upped the spices a bit, as others mentioned. Also one reviewer said they put crushed pecans on the sides of the cake - I did this too - and boy is it beautiful!

Based on the positive reviews, I just baked this cake for my husband's b-day. What a SUCCESS! So tender and moist! No problems whatsoever with this simple recipe. My variations: - I used about 3/4 c. chopped pecans (cuz that's what was left in the bag) - I soaked the raisins in 8 yr old Bacardi! OMG! Amazing flavor, subtle, perfect complement. - I saved the soaking rum and exchanged 2 t. for the vanilla in the frosting. Again, subtle but delicious complement. - I grated my carrots by hand with a fine grater for a smooth textured cake. - I doubled the nutmeg (cuz that's what was left in the jar) - I added 1 t. speculaas (cuz the cookies are SO good)

I've never made carrot cake before, but made this one for my mother-in law's birthday because she loves carrot cake. This cake was amazing. The recipe is really easy and the cake stays really moist. I made this a 2 layer 6 in cake by just cutting the existing recipe in half. All I modified was to cut the oil in half, and substituted applesauce for the rest. The cream cheese icing I also left as is - I tried the orange zest in the icing, but thought that it overpowered the flavor of the cake. This is one of the easiest recipes and so good. My husband who doesn't even like carrot cake LOVED this one.

I have made everything from cupcakes to a four tier wedding cake with this recipe. My secret is to add a fresh orange juice and zest from one orange per batch of cake and then add a couple of tablespoons of grand marnier and zest to the frosting. Sooooo good. I made this as a wedding cake three years ago and people still talk about it.

The best carrot cake I've ever tried! I didn't change anything in the recipe and the results have always been exceptionally good!!! You can make 26-28 cup cakes (bake for 25-30 mins). But prepare only half the frosting or you'll have a lot left over.

don't bother to add the raisins and nuts, they sink to the bottom right away. cake was really good out of the oven, but then was very heavy the next day. did use 3/4 cup applesauce instead. didn't like the frosting, tried adding orange zest like other reviewers. i think after mixing up cream cheese, i just lose my appetite anyway knowing how fattening it is. tasted somewhat like spice cake. probably won't make it again.

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times, and it is OUTSTANDING. I have had many requests from my friends on all sorts of occasions, that this is the only cake they want. Sometimes I will make into cupcakes or a sheet cake, (you will have lots of extra icing, but I don't see that as a problem), just because it is quicker to make and easier to serve at some places. Do try, it is truly delicious!

this is a fantastic carrotcake recipe..I made a couple of changes. I increased the nutmeg to l teaspoon and I increased the amount of nuts to 3/4 cup chopped walnuts and l/2 cup chopped pecans. For the frosting I wanted a more "creamcheesey" taste so I used 3 eight ounces of cream cheese . ALSO: I used the 3 cups of carrots but did not grate them. I put them in my cuisinart and they came out grated but a bit chunkier and they were perfect. Gave the cake a great texture. It was a HUGE success with everyone who ate it!!!

There is a reason there are a zillion reviews for this cake. It's outstanding. I "grated" the carrots by shredding them in a FP first, then chopping the shreds with the FP using the metal blade. My variations: I subbed 1/2 cup melted butter for part of the oil. I used 1 full cup of ground walnuts and 1 full cup of ground craisins. Baked the recipe in a half-sheet pan for exactly 45 minutes. CC icing I used was 2 lbs. of softened CC with 1 cup of granulated sugar and 1 tsp. of vanilla. Beaten long enough, granulated sugar will dissolve. This cake is going into my keeper file. It's the moistest, most flavorful carrot cake I ever made.

Delicious! It was devoured at the party I brought it to. I used less sugar (~3 cups) in the frosting which turned out nicely. Also made nice cupcakes.

Rating: 3
This is very tasty and moist, but didn't come out with a standard cake texture. But here's what I did after I read some of the reviews: used a little less sugar, replaced over 3/4 c of oil with vanilla yogourt, grated the carrots extra fine for more moisture (my theory) and added orange peel to the icing. Wow that icing is good. I really whipped it, made it easy to spread. I could have waited just a wee bit longer for the cake to cool to make sure there was no melting from warm cake. A note for those who want some but not tons of icing, I only made half the icing recipe and baked the cake in just 2 layers and there was enough to cover. I might have added a wee bit more butter as I didn't measure, just put what I had left in. So I'll definitely try this again, maybe even follow the recipe more closely.

Rating: 0
Recipe turned out well. I greased the pans with butter and then lined them with parchment paper. I would not suggest wax paper, since the film could melt into your food. I omitted the raisins and nuts, since some folks don't care for them and b/c I don't think they're essential to a good carrot cake. I added about a quarter teaspoon of ginger, but don't think it really came through. I also used vanilla bean paste in the icing, which really enhanced the flavor. Also, I'd recommend spraying the cooling rack with Pam. I didn't and ended up with stuck cake. Whoops.

This is exceptional and very easy to make. Made it for the first time for my husband's birthday - at my 8 yr old's insistence that we make a home- made cake. She was so thrilled to help and aside from me handling the carrot grating, I let her take the lead for most of the steps. Used as much organic ingredients as i could - flour, butter, eggs, sugar, carrots, applesauce. Followed some substitutions as per some of the reviews: For cake, I substituted 1 cup applesauce for the 1c veg oil. Put in remaining 1/2 c veg oil. Subbed 1/2 c crushed, drained pineapple for the raisins as no one in our family likes raisins in cakes. TOASTED the nuts first before I stirred in. Added 1/2 t vanilla. And really, really dont forget the wax paper to line the pan - I was almost going to skip because I had nonstick cake pans but I am so glad I didnt! You will be scrapping your carrot cake from pan if you dont put in the wax paper liner. Poured in 2 10-in pans to make 2 layers. For the frosting, followed another review and mixed 2 8oz cream cheese, 2 c powdered sugar, 2 t vanilla, 1 stick butter and either zest of orange or 2 t lemon juice. Its very easy to adjust up or down on the sugar depending how sweet you want it. Next time i will decrease the butter to 3/4 stick. Refrigerated frosting for 30-45 min before i put in on cake and had no problem of being runny. Wonderful! My husband LOVES carrot cake and he was oohing and aahing the whole time. This is a definite keeper.

I recently baked this cake for a family get together. I was pleasantly surprised when everyone said it was the "best carrot cake they'd ever had". I went ahead and reduced the oil to 3/4 cup and then substituted 3/4 cup of applesauce for the rest of the oil. I doubled the cinnamon and reduced the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp as I am not a big nutmeg fan. I also added a scant amount of ground cloves and 1/4 tsp vanilla extract. I left out the raisins (due to picky eaters) and chose to decorate the sides of the cake with the pecans. I baked the cake in 3, 8-inch foil pans at 325 and it only took 40 minutes in my oven. For the frosting, I took the advice of another reviewer (Page Mavis from NJ) and added the zest of one orange. (The frosting was so tasty that I couldn't stop eating it while I was frosting the cake!) I served the cake cold and found that with each passing day it became more and more delicious! It is true that this cake will win over people who claim to "hate" carrot cake. It is now a delicious addition to our family's cook book.

Wow, this is the best cake I've ever had. Absoulutley delicious. After seeing this on Today I had to make it. I am not a baker and cannot bake at all, but this was so easy!! I don't know what some reviewers are talking about with the bubbling over. Thank goodness that didn't happen to me. I used all oil, and it worked perfect and is absolutley to die for. I cannot wait to bake it again, although trying to watch my weight....I'm going to wait a bit before I do it again. I do highly recommend making this carrot cake!! Awesome.

Okay...this is absolutely delicious tasting, however, I made this twice in two days...thinking I must have messed up the first time, as it bubbled over and was a bit too greasy. The second time, the same thing happened, altough the taste is amazing...I think that the high altitude didn't fair well with the cake. I was so afraid that I "did something wrong" that I did not change a thing. Next time, I will reduce the oil with applesauce (just too greasy) and use a high altitude flour (as it seemed suspect to not working well at high altitudes). With that said, this is probably the best tasting carrot cake I have ever tried....I just need to "fix" a bit for Colorado. That must be the reason for a few problems after trying twice EXACTLY to recipe. I don't know...not exactly what I expected after the reviews, but worth trying.

Soo good. I made cupcakes out of this recipe and followed the other reviewers suggestions to replace half the oil with applesauce and reduce the sugar. I also removed the raisins because I don't like them in my carrot cake. The muffins were moist and carroty and my coworkers thought they were really "gourmet".

Rating: 4
Addendum: I forgot to mention that I baked the cupcakes for about 20 minutes at 350 instead of the recommended 325 (I'd start checking them at about 18 minutes). The tops did brown quite a bit but they weren't burnt and very moist. They're even better the next day!

I wanted carrot cake cupcakes so that's what I made - - and I baked them for about 20 minutes and they came out divine! I did reduce the oil to 1 c. and added 1/2 c. applesauce (like some other reviewers had done). The texture of the final product was more like a muffin/bread than a typical cupcake, but still absolutely delicious!

After I saw this made on the Today show, I too made it and I quote "this is the best cake I've ever tasted". I made it with Tofutti because I wanted it to be Pareve (non-dairy) and look forward to making the real cc. frosting at another time. The grating of the carrots was WAY time consuming so if anyone has a better way of doing it, tell me! This cake was excellent! Add my review the long list of fans.

We had a birthday celebration at work for someone whose favorite cake is carrot. I was asked to make the cake and saw this recipe featured on the Today Show and decided to give it a try. I had heard it was one of the most popular recipes visited. I now know why! I could not believe the fuss this cake received! Once the first slice was made, there seemed to be a mass hysteria to get to the cake before it was gone! I have not been a fan of carrot cakes previously, but, actually think that this cake may now be my ultimate favorite! It was deliciously moist and flavorful! I even made it a few days in advance of the party and was worried that it might loose flavor and become dry. It did not! I have people begging for me to bring it in again. My hat is off to the creator of this recipe. It is fabulous!

Thank you Epicurious! I prepared this recipe for Easter in the early 1990's when I first saw it published in Gourmet magazine and it was OUTSTANDING! and got rave reviews from everyone who was fortunate enough to grab a piece when it was plated. Unfortunately, our family made a move, and this recipe along with a number of other favorites was LOST. I was so thrilled to see this posted again..and my family will be just as happy. This is the best Carrot Cake one could hope to find.

It was a bit runny, but it set up well in the fridge.

I used this recipe to make cupcakes last night, and they are amazing. Substituted applesauce for half of the oil - next time might use even more applesauce. I sprayed the cupcake papers with Baker's Joy but I think it might have been an unnecessary step, and it contributed to slightly soggy papers. I made half of the frosting recipe, and it was just slightly too little. Next time I will make 2/3, but decrease the powdered sugar. Overall, this is a great recipe for cupcakes. They came out delicious, moist and fluffy. I am very pleased with them.

FYI: I was substituting oil or butter with applesauce. . except I completely forgot to put it in and didn't remember that I screwed up until I was popping the cake out of the pans. So the lesson here is, this is a really amazing recipe EVEN when you are beginning to show signs of menopause! I substituted the raisins for a cup of crushed pineapple (as Cook from SF Bay suggested) which must have saved my bum. Didn't tell any one about my error and STILL got rave reviews - the thing was gone by the end of the night. Phew!

I made this recipe and brought it to work. I followed many of the other reviews and reduced the oil to 3/4 cup and supplemented the rest of the oil with 3/4 cup of natural applesauce. For the frosting, I reduced the butter to 1/2 stick and added the zest of 1 orange. The icing was the best part. Everyone raved about it. One of my married co-workers said he no longer thought his wife was a very good baker, after he tasted my cake! Yikes. But none the less, I was still flattered.

I made this for my son's birthday. I made one two layer cake and another batch as cupcakes. The only change I made to the recipe was I only used one cup of oil and added one cup of applesauce.

This cake recipe is really, really good. I made the following modifications and it was still really excellent: substituted 8 oz (1 cup) of unsweetened applesauce for 1 cup of oil (still used the other 1/2 cup oil). Added a small can (about 1/2 cup) of crushed pineapple, drained. Doubled the cinnamon and eliminated the nutmeg because I just don't like the stuff. Also didn't add the nuts. The only thing that I didn't like was the original frosting recipe. Granted, I did use neufchatel, which can get a little gummy/runny when beaten, but I had to add at least two more cups of powdered sugar to get the flavor/consistency of frosting that I like. Though, I tend to like my frosting sweet. Overall, it was a great cake and I'd make it again. It's for my dad's birthday tomorrow (his request) and I think he'll be pleased.

This has become my standard carrot cake. I've made it over and over, and have finally found that a few changes has produced the "best carrot cake ever" for a hard-to-impress crowd. I leave out the raisins as I've never liked them in carrot cake but also use the nuts only on the frosting and around the base of the cake because of a finicky son so he can pick them off. Works best if you reduce the oil to 1 1/4 cup (at most) and reduce the nutmeg - just a bit will do. Add a teaspoon of vanilla for richer flavor. Can bake as a double layer cake as well.

I've been making this carrot cake for a few years now and it has always been a big hit. As others have said, even people who "don't like carrot cake" absolutely love it!! I omit the rasins every time. I have recently started to make a double layer cake only and then I make cupcakes with the rest of the batter. I found that the triple layer cake was a challenge to keep from sliding after iced - the double layer does not slide at all.

This is an absolute winner. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe as is and found it a bit too oily.

I followed the suggestions from some of the others about decreasing the oil to 1 cup and adding applesauce. I also omitted the raisins and added pineapple. I used finely grated carrots instead of shredded. The cake had great flavor, but was way too moist. More the consistancy of bread pudding than cake. I would caution others not to make too many changes at once. I would make this again, but would stay closer to the original recipe.

I have been making versions of this cake for years & it is always a major success. This time I incorporated a few suggestions from other reviewers & it was perfect! I used 1 cup applesauce and only 1 tbs oil, added 1/2 tsp extra cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, omitted nuts & replaced raisins with crushed pineapple [which gave it an interesting flavor, a little more mellow] . For the icing I used only 1/2 stick butter, low fat cream cheese, 3 tsp vanilla & 1 tsp lemon juice. These changes eliminate so much fat and do not detract from the flavor. The cake was nice & moist & absolutely delicious. Brought it to a dinner party & it got rave reviews!

I have made a few changes that might appeal to some, i use golden raisins that i soak in brandy for 2 days, i substitute nuts with crushed pineapple-leave out half cup of oil and add one cup of carrots, also take out one cup of sugar from frosting. I also only do two layers. I love this cake!

I'm sort of confounded by this recipe and the reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, wanting to try it as written. It produced three not-very-high layers which sunk pretty seriously in the middle. It was very oily (left serious oil marks on the cardboard cake round I placed it on). Following suggestions of reviewers re the frosting, I tried to use less sugar, but you really need at least 3 cups to make a proper frosting that's not just a sheer glaze (how the previous reviewer got by with 3/4 cup I can't figure out). The frosting barely covered the cake, and with the big, coarse, oily crumbs all over it was a bit difficult to frost at all. I persevered and put it in the fridge overnight to take to a work party. In the morning I added another layer of cream cheese frosting I had left over (w/orange peel, from a spice cake recipe on this site), and it looked more presentable, though far from attractive. Served it in the afternoon to about a dozen people, most of whom said it was the best carrot cake they'd ever had! It was certainly moist. I think all of the suggestions to cut the oil and sub w/applesauce are worth following, and I'm wondering if a full tablespoon of baking powder and soda might be indicated. The cake does taste better the second day. I'm not sure what to make of all this, but if ten people say it's out of this world they must be right, I guess!

I've been making carrot cake for years and am in constant search for a recipe that balances, taste, texture and healthfulness; I think I can stop searching! I incorporated all of the suggestions from the cook from SF but did 3/4 cup canola oil and 3/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce. For the frosting I omitted the butter, used one package full sin cream cheese and one package reduced fat, added only 3/4 cup powdered sugar. It was a huge hit everyone raved how they loved that nothing was overly sweet. This recipe is a KEEPER!

I've made hundreds of recipes from this website, and I'd consider this one of the best that I've tried. The frosting is yummy, and the cake is delicious, and not too heavy. I received many, many compliments from guests that ate this cake. I'm looking forward to making it again using the suggestions made by the SF Bay reviewer in 2/07. P.S. I found the recipe pretty easy, especially the frosting.

LOVE THIS CAKE. Will try to applesauce instead of so much oil next time. I buy those prepeeled babycarrots and toss them in the cusinart - it saves a ton of time.

Made for Easter dessert and got rave reviews. Would have given 4 forks, but made these changes: Substituted 1/2 C applesauce instead of oil; increased cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp; increased nutmeg to 1 tsp; added one 8 oz. can of crushed pineapple, drained; reduced powdered sugar (frosting) to 2 1/2 C; reduced vanilla (frosting) to 2 tsp; added 1 tsp lemon zest to frosting. I also omitted the nuts and raisins (personal preference). Decorated cake with pecans and refrigerated for easy cutting. Next time I'll increase to cinnamon and nutmeg slightly- otherwise, I'll make exactly the same. YUMMY!!!

I've made this recipe twice and both times it was absolutely wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly, except adding in 1/2 cup of crushed pineapple drained and I also toasted the pecans prior to adding them to the batter. The cake is definitely not oily at all. I was a little alarmed when I pulled the cakes out of the oven - two of them sank in the middle. I'm not sure if it was because the heat was not able to circulate properly in my oven, or because of the amount of fruit in the batter. Regardless, the cake turned out beautifully, and no one was able to tell. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This is a great receipe, most ingreidents are always on hand for those drop in guests. For years I have substituted apple sauce or mayonnaise for oil and never had a problem. I worried about all the modifications in the reviews but my qualms were put to rest when the cakes came right out ot the pan. Yeah for wax paper! I substituted walnuts for pecans without a problem and added a bit more in spices too. I think this receipe if fail-proof.

This is the 3rd Easter I will be making this recipe. It is a family favorite and I one I often share friends who are looking for an easy and delicious Carrot Cake recipe. I read new reviews and can't wait to substitute some of the oil for apple sauce. For those of you making this for the 1st time the Wax Paper is key. The first year I made it I skipped this step and my husband had to scrape the cakes out of the pan! The wax paper makes this a much easier process.

The cake turned out great even though I forgot to add the cruashed pineapple. I used the oil/applesauce suggestion and added extra spice (nutmeg, ginger and cinnamon). 2 cups of icing sugar for the icing worked out really well and was not at all runny.

I'm not a carrot cake fan, but it's my husband's favorite cake, so I made this for his birthday last year. It was such a big hit, I've been asked to make it several other times, both for his birthday this year and for a friend's birthday. It's always a huge hit. I make it exactly as written, with one exception -- I made 50% more frosting. I ended up with a bit too much, but as written, it's not quite enough.

Fantastic cake!! However, DO NOT SKIP THE WAX PAPER on the cake pans. I thought I would be OK with non-stick pans and Baker's Joy, but my cakes fell apart when I tried to take them out of the pan. Fortuately they looked fine after I added the frosting. My husband says this is the best carrot cake he has ever eaten!

I made this cake for my daughter's 5th birthday party. Despite my horrible oven(cooks too hot on one side and isn't level ha ha!) this cake turned out amazing! I changed a few things..2 t of cinnamon instead of 1, I used 1 cup of apple sause instead of oil, used 5 eggs, and used walnuts instead. It was easy to make and very moist. Great recipe!!!

This carrot cake was fantastic! I made it for an office b-day party and it was received with great reviews. I actually made it into a quarter sheet cake instead of the 3 layers and just added about 30 more minutes to my baking time and reduced the heat to 300 degrees for those last 30 minutes and it worked it great. Extremely moist and not too sweet.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous. I omitted the nuts since I made it for a friend who was allergic, and let me tell you, this cake was wiped out when I brought it into work. I'll try and substitute some of the oil for applesauce next time, but man! The cake was moist and delicious, and the frosting came out perfect. Yeah!

As a gourmet cook, I highly recommend this recipe - it's far and beyond the best cake I've ever made. I've had clients request this cake time and time again as their wedding cake. This is THE carrot cake recipe. Remember to save it to your "favorites"!

Rating: 3
I followed the recommendations of prior cooks and substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for a 1/2 cup of the oil; I'm certain that simple change improved the texture and taste of the resulting cake. This cake was moist with a nice crumb, not overly sweet, and left the pan very easily (lining the 9x13" pan with waxed paper did the trick). I love the flavor of vanilla, but, in my opinion, the 4 teaspoons of vanilla in the icing overpowered the milder carrot and spice flavors of the cake. I think 1 teaspoon of vanilla (a normal amount for most recipes) will yield better results the next time I bake this cake.

I love to cook....but not to bake & I decided to make this for Thanksgiving. It was fabulous. Made a few substitutions.....1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup oil. Omitted nutmeg and added equivalent of cinnamon. To the frosting I cut creme cheese to 1 1/2 (8 ounce pkg), 1 box of powdered sugar, and 3 tsp of vanilla. Made the cake on Wednesday, covered with plastic and frosted on Thanksgiving morning. Not enough frosting for sides so I ground pecans in the grinder and sprinkled on the side of cake. Made a very impressive presentation on a crystal cake plate.....Definitely a repeat!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm only rating this recipe a 3 because of the frosting, Delicious ! The cake is another story, I have no idea what I did wrong but it wouldn't come out of the pan (didn't grease it enough ?) and when it did finally come out, it just crumbled. I will definitely make the frosting in the future but I will try a different recipe for the cake.

I make this cake every year for my husband's b'day. As others have noted, this cake can be made successfully w/ less oil and sugar without compromising the taste or texture. Actually, less of both are an improvement. I also typically use dried cranberries instead of raisins. Make this cake! You won't be sorry.

Rating: 3
This was very good. I made it without reading the reviews first. I used one cup sugar and one cup brown sugar for the heck of it because I love brown sugar and I should have stuck to just the sugar. It did seem a bit oily, so I think I'll take one of the suggestions from the other reviews and use only one cup of oil. I put in extra pecans and raisins and it was great.

The best carrot cake I have ever had! I asked my husband to bake it for me for my birthday- a particular challenge as he is very free form with his cooking and to follow directions is nearly impossible. It was perfect! If he can do it- anyone can! I think he added extra nutmeg and cinnamon as that was the only place he dared be creative. Truly a moist and delicious cake.

I am surprised by the rave reviews. Carrot cake is my favorite so I have eaten (and baked) quite a few. I found this cake too greasy and underspiced. I also found the icing did make enough to cover the cake.

I don't even eat carrot cake and I have had a slice each time I have made this receipe. It is really delicious. If you don't like nutmeg you can use 3tsp of ground cinnamon instead. One receipe makes one layer of cake in a 11x15inch pan.

Rating: 4
Because of the modifications made by previous reviewers, this was a fantastic cake!! I made it twice this week and it was a hit both times. Here are my notes: -Definitely use the applesauce to replace some of the oil (1/2 c applesauce and 1c oil). -Definitely increase the carrot. I used 4 cups. -Definitely increase the spices. I added more cinnamon and some pumpkin pie spice. -I replaced 2 of the whole eggs with 2 egg whites only, and it was still moist and delicious. -I made it once with 2 nine-inch pans and once with 3 pans. It comes out fine either way, but I vastly preferred the 3-layer version. Better cake to icing ratio. -I used pastry flour once and all-purpose once, and it was pretty much the same either way. -I cut the sugar to 1 and a half cups in the icing and I thought it was perfect. Don't forget the vanilla!

I just finished making the cake portion of this recipe and it is the worst carrot cake I've ever had. The 4 eggs give it an overpowering eggy taste. The 1.5 cups of oil makes it sickenly oily too.

This recipe is truly strange in that I have never seen such a highly rated recipe on this site with so many reader alterations and suggested changes! OK, I have to add my own: 1. Only used 1 cup of oil and it was perfectly moist. (NO applesauce or pineapple! Plus I can't imagine needing 1.5 cups of oil in this--YUCK!) 2. The icing only needed 1.5 cups of sugar and 1 tsp. of vanilla. With these changes, it has become my carrot cake recipe of choice that I make for everyone to great success.

This was an amazing carrot cake. I used the exact amount of oil called for in the recipe, despite other reviewers suggestions of using applesauce and I'm glad I did. It wasn't oily at all, and the frosting was perfect as well. I was expecting it to be very sweet because of the 4 cups of powdered sugar and it was not. I baked it in 2 9" pans which made extra thick layers so I had a little leftover frosting. I sprinkled the top and sides with sme chopped pecans and everyone thought it was from a gourmet bakery! Great cake.

I'm not rating this cake because I had a problem with it and don't want the rating to suffer if it was my fault. The flavor was very good, but I found the texture of the cake to be quite soggy and wet. I brought it to a party and was quite embarassed. I followed the many suggestions to use 1 cup veg oil plus 1/2 cup applesauce. Don't know what went wrong. Taste is good though.

This carrot cake reminds me of one my mother used to make that always received rave reviews. I made the cake as directed, except I left out the nuts (Husband hates them! I love them!) and doubled the raisins. Used food processor to shred carrots. Also increased quantities of spices a bit. The cake does need to sit in the refrigerator a bit in order for the frosting to set up some, so allow time for that. Took this to Easter family dinner and everyone loved it. Leftovers taken to husband's office - not even one crumb left! Would definitely make this one again. Very moist and flavorful.

I'll add to the accolades. Moist, flavorful and pretty easy to make. Took the great advice on cutting oil by adding apple sauce. Used half white, half brown sugar. Cut powdered sugar to 2 1/2 cups. definitely refridgerate icing to help it thicken.

In the seventies I made a carrot cake that always won rave reviews. Unfortunately in one of my many moves I lost the recipe. I decided to try this one out, but I couldn't help tweaking it a bit. I replaced the two cups of sugar with one cup of brown sugar splenda. Reduced oil to one cup. Used one cup cake flour, one cup whole wheat. Ground the cinnamon and nutmeg fresh and switched proportions 3/4 t cinnamon to 1 t nutmeg, added a handful of wheatgerm and used six cups of carrots instead of three. I would have used currants instead of the raisins but I couldn't find any, so we skipped the raisins. Cake was wonderful. Not too dry, not too moist, not too dense, lovely nutty carroty perfume brought to life by the nutmeg. The icing was a disappointment. I think I would make it next time without the butter. It was too soft and too sweet. Of course my husband thought the icing made the cake!

This cake was awesome. Everyone raved about it and even kids who didn't like carrot cake liked it. I used half oil half applesauce and it was very moist. I used half the amount of 10X sugar in the frosting and it was good but still too sweet for my tastes.

Rating: 4
I went with other reviewers' suggestions (sub out part of oil with applesauce and reducing amount of confectioner's sugar by 1 cup). I made this for my mom-in-laws birthday. Everyone loved it & couldn't believe how moist it was - even 3 days later (when we were eating leftovers)! This will be a recipe I wil l make over and over again! Perfect carrot cake recipe! Also, I took a little of the frosting & mixed food coloring to create orange. I used that for additional piping decoration.

Rating: 4
This is the the kind of carrot cake you want if you don't really like carrot cake!! I leave out the nuts and double the spices so it's much more of a carrot-spice cake, and use simple whipped cream (sometimes stabilized with gelatin) instead of frosting. There is NEVER any left whenever this cake goes anywhere !! It's one the chocolate cake people (like myself) love too!!

Rating: 2
This cake was good, but not mind-blowing, in my opinion. It needed more carrots -- I wish I had followed the advice of those reviewers who recommended increasing the carrots to 4 cups. I also wish I would have done the apple sauce trick -- perhaps that would have lent the cake a bit more flavor. The frosting was delicious, but only because I cut the sugar to two cups. The full 4 cups would have ruined the flavor and texture, I think. Overall, I would say only use this recipe if you make all the changes that the previous reviewers made. I erred in not trusting them enough.

I LOVE to cook, but HATE to bake. My husband requested Carrot Cake for his birthday so I thought I would make one for him. I took the suggestion of subsituting 1/2 applesauce for 1/2 cup oil.

This is the most delicious carrot cake I have ever eaten and I don't even like carrot cake! Instead of the vegetable oil, I replaced with unsweetened applesauce, which makes the cake even more moist. I also did not include the nuts (I hate nuts in cake) but increased the amount of raisins and then decorate the frosting with nuts instead. To grate the carrots more quickly, you can utilize a food processor. Just don't overdo it or the carrots might turn to mush or carrot juice. The frosting is a bit sweet so I decrease the powdered sugar by 1 cup and the vanilla by 1 teaspoon. It tastes terrific. This recipe is requested at every gathering I attend. I am making it for some coworkers tonight.

I prepared this cake according to the suggestions below and it was excellent. I don't think it would be very good without the following changes, as it would be too sweet and oily: Substitue 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 c. oil (i.e., 1 cup oil and 1/2 cups applesauce). Sustitute 1/2 drained crushed pineapple for raisins. Reduce sugar in cake from 2 cups to 1 1/2 c. Reduce sugar in frosting to 2 cups. This edited recipe results in a dense moist cake with an interesting texture and a tangy perfectly sweet frosting.

I made this cake two ways-- with 1 cup oil and 1/2 cup buttermilk (instead of 1.5 cups oil) and still way to oily. the reverse proportion worked beautifully and is what i'll use from now on, i.e., 1/2 cup oil, and 1 cup reduced fat buttermilk. i can't figure out why the recipe requires all the oil-- i think the feel and texture of the cake suffers rather than benefits from it. i also reduced the sugar by 25% in the cake and by 50% in the frosting-- much better. the vanilla in the frosting is overkill in my opinion as well, and would be better substituted with another liquid (i used milk) to keep the consistency. garnished with blackbberries and pecans for an impressive presentation. I also ground 3/4 cup of pecans fairly fine to add to the batter, and got a really gorgeous light crumb with a bit of extra texture. there are many achingly sweet desserts out there, and i think one of the great things about carrot cake is that it's an earthy dessert that can seem almost virtuous while still being fantastically delicious. this is a really great recipe with the modifications. my search is over.

Great recipe and some good tips from reviewers. I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce and used 1 cup oil. I used the cuisanart for the carrot shredding and then pulse them for smaller pieces. I used half the conf. sugar in frosting and it was wonderful. Kids requested to leave out nuts and raisins. We decorated the cake and then added some orange and yellow food coloring to some frosting and added carrot designs on top. We did 2 layers and some mini bundts. A great finish for Easter dinner!

This cake was nice and simple, but tasted fantastic. The icing was exceptionally thick when I made it. I added a couple tablespoons of milk and it still held together very nicely, just like any carrot cake's icing should.

I highly recommend this recipe.

I'm not huge on carrot cake, but my partner thoroughly enjoyed this one. As per previous reviewers, used 2 cups of icing sugar in frosting, 1 cup oil with 1/2 cup apple sauce, parchment instead of waxed paper, and dusted raisins with flour to prevent sinking (which worked!). Made 2 x 8 inch layers and 11 muffins. In the future, I will use another frosting recipe - mine wasn't runny, but still too sweet and I found the powdery texture off putting (could be because it wasn't mixed long enough - I was leery of runny icing). Thanks to all the reviewers for the very helpful suggestions.

I made it for my boyfriend's birthday (and the crazy guy doesn't like cake- go figure) and he loved it. All of our friends raved about it and had seconds- including my boyfriend.

I was making some carrot juice with a a couple of apples with juice extractor for my son and I thought why not save all the leftover from it and make some carrot cake. I used whatever that I had which I did not have raisens or nuts so I omitted them. I also cut back on the sugar to 1 1/2 c and also used only 1 1/2 c of powdered sugar. I don't have 3 - 9" pans so I cupcakes instead. It came out perfect, moist and delicious with the icing. They are the perfect size for my kids, but one is not enough, we keep wanting more. I will definately make this again.

I very easy recipe! Wonderful cake, my guests licked their plate! However, I agree that there is way too much sugar in the recipe for the frosting. I used half the sugar and it was wonderful.

Rating: 3
While the taste of the cake was excellent and got wonderful reviews at the party I took it too, I do think that it had a bit too much oil, I don't know if changing the amount would alter it too much. And regarding the frosting, I didn't use the 4 cups of powdred sugar, I honestly think that it's too much. So I used half the amount and for those of you who had problems with the frosting being too runny, this one came out perfectly nice and just the right stiffness.

Aunt Ruth here again.....What can I say???!!! OH MY GOD!!!! I made this recipe for a co-worker (whose wedding cake was a carrot cake). He said and I quote: "This is the best carrot cake I have ever tasted, even better than my wedding cake and that cake was good!" This is the only carrot cake I will make. In fact I printed several copies and placed them in favorite places so I wouldn't think about where it was if I wanted to make it...Goodness, I should know it by heart at this point! HA! Epicurious, I thank you!

Question and then helpful pointer. Has anyone used this recipe for cupcakes? What timing adjustment should be made for baking? Some tweaking that makes this cake PERFECT: -frosting should have 2 cups of sugar not 4 - Grate the carrots in the food processor with grating attachment and then reinsert mixture (in batches) in food processor with pulsing blade till carrot resembles very fine corn meal. This makes the cake moist, dense but airy and absolutely delicious.

Absolutely the easiest, most delicious carrot cake recipe I have ever prepared. I experimented for weeks for the "perfect" carrot cake. This is it. Prep time is over in a flash, the frosting is not too sweet. I used finely chopped mixed dried fruits (cranberries, raspberries, pears...) and used currents instead of raisins (1/4 cup total). Every person that tasted it asked me for the recipe. Try it. You will not be sorry!

Everyone that has been able to have a bite of this cake always asks me to make it again. They absolutely love it. The only thing I do different is grind the nuts (we have people in our family that does not like the taste of nuts, but they will eat this and ask for it again. Hmmmm... go figure....

This carrot cake is wonderful. I made a few changes to the recipe. I reduced the granulated suger to 1 1/2 Cups, added 2/3 cup chopped pine-apples. And reduced the powdered suger in the frosting to 2 1/2 cups. It was YUMMY! I'm sending it out to all my friends. Thanks!

This is the perfect carrot cake recipe. I don't usually add the raisins just because I'm a purest when it comes to spice cakes. But even with the raisins, it's unbelievable. Without though, there's nothing better in life!! Oh, and I do cut the powdered sugar down by about half as well. Cream cheese frosting should taste like "cream cheese" frosting in my opinion. :-)

I absolutely love this recipe. I only make two layers, substitutey half of the oil w/ applesauce (makes the cake more moist), and cut the powdered sugar by 1 C.

Awesome recipe-- Substituted 1 8 oz can of crushed pineapple (drained) for the raisins and cut the powdered sugar to 2 cups. It was perfect! Plenty sweet but not cloying and sticky like the carrot cakes you get commercially. Texture was not crumbly, it was lighter than some other versions but still incredibly moist. This is definitely going into my 'favorite' file...

This cake is excellent. I always have rave reviews. However, I use unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil and for the frosting, I only use 3 cups of p.sugar. I have never had runny frosting or a problem with the cake crumbling.

I have made this several times, all to rave reviews. I've had it sink in the middle too and it's fine with the frosting! If the frosting seems runny, just frost the cake and then let it set up in the fridge for a bit. It gets warm being at room temperature and during beating, but it sets up nice! I'm having this for my wedding cupcakes!!!

I have made this serveral times and everyone loves it. Does anyone else experience a problem with the texture? Isn't it a bit crumbly? Before it's iced it doesn't look so great. It's usually sagging in the middle and very fragile to handle. Once the icing goes on though, it covers up the flaws. I do love the flavor though.

This cake is very simple to make and delicious. I bought a 1lb prepackaged bag of baby carrots and pulsed them in the Food Processer which made "grating" the carrots a snap. Used finely ground walnuts and a drop of coconut extract in the frosting (FANTASTIC). Refridge overnight for really easy cutting and nice stiff icing. Garnished with fresh cut flowers. A huge hit!

This is now my son's yearly birthday cake. I made it again this year and it was great, just like last year. I used the maple cream cheese frosting recipe on this site, and cut the amount of syrup by about half. The frosting was lightly flavored, but not overly sweet, which was a nice contrast to the sweetness of the cake. Golden raisins are good, along with a little bit of coconut. I went heavy on the jam in between layers (mixed with a little frosting) which tasted great. I used peach-apricot-passionfruit jam found at Trader Joe's.

I made this cake for my son's first birthday and people really liked it. I made a few changes: left out the raisins and nuts (since it was for a kid b-day) and I used a combination of brown sugar and granulated sugar (3/4 cup of each). I also only made a two layer and used the leftover filling to make a few cupcakes. The frosting is really good!

It'll be almost ten years now since I tried this recipe. A couple of years ago I moved and lost the magazine that included this carrot cake recipe. Every time I made it, my sisters just could not wait for me to ice the cake, so, looking at them, the cake on one hand and the bowl of frosting on the other, I knew it would always be a winner! Thank you so much for giving this out. It's the best! I've used it throughout the years for my daughter's birthdays (since she was 2!!) and holidays. On a nostalgic note, my mom passed away at the same time I lost the recipe and now that I've found it once again for the holidays, I'm truly grateful.

Very delicious carrot cake! Although, two layers is perfect. Made it for a friend's birthday who loves carrot cake, he loved it. Even those who aren't big carrot cake fans finished their peice. I topped it with the Maple Syrup cream cheese frosting, yummy! I did not think it was oily (as others have said). I did omit the raisins, and added an 8oz can of drained crushed pineapple, and to further impress the friends, I added toasted coconut flakes on top of the second layer after it was frosted. Will be making this again for Easter, for sure, maybe even Thanksgiving.

I made this for a friend's birthday - she insisted on carrot cake, and I had never made one before. This was fabulous. My friend said it was the best ever.

I cut the sugar and vanilla in the frosting in half, and decorated the cake with pecans. Maybe the wonderful farmers market organic carrots helped!

The smell that filled the house while this cake was baking was not pleasant at all. It tasted a lot better than I expected based on that smell. My canola oil was fresh so that wasn't the problem. Also, the layers sunk in the middle. I had a bowl shaped cake after I had stacked the layers! Overall, I'm still looking for the ultimate carrot cake recipe.

Delicious!I have made this recipe twice and have taken advise from some of the reviews. I added extra carrots,raisin & nuts. I also added 3/4 cups of coconut & substitued the 1 1/2 cups of oil with 3/4 cups oil and 3/4 cups juice (apple or orange). Works great! However, I did find in order to frost cake properly you do need entire frosting recipe if you want to do decorations.

Made according to recipe 1st time - good. Then added stuff from other available recipes - increased carrots to 4 cups, 1/2 cup raisins, 2T minced fresh ginger, cut icing recipe in 1/2, with 1/2 cup less sugar too- enough for a 13X9 cake, which baked for 50 minutes. Delicious!

This carrot cake is one of the best cakes I have ever made. It is relatively easy and is great for party occassions. I have doubled the cake recipe and made it in larger (11" and 12") round cake pans and it serves a tremendous amount of people. I also omit the oil entirely and use applesauce in the same measurement and it comes out unbelieveably moist! The frosting can also be made lowfat. This is definitely a keeper recipe.

Very good cake. The layers are not high-- I would consider making it in 2 layers instead of 3 next time. Also, I reduced the sugar in the frosting to 2 cups and the vanilla to 2 teaspoons. I had plenty of frosting. I omitted the raisins and substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 cup of oil. Beware-- if you let the cake cool for too long in the pans you may have a great deal of trouble getting the waxed paper off.

I've made this cake several times and it has always been wonderful. I only use one cup of oil and add a 1/2 cup of another liquid (orange juice works well). I also cut down on the sugar in the icing. Whenever I make one, I have to make another for friends because it is such a hit.

It's a very good carrot cake, but I did find out why the issue of it tasting like vegetable oil was raised. I had purchased additional oil at the store because I wasn't sure if I had enough at home; when I got home I found an open bottle and used it instead for the cake. Ugh. I could tell from the batter something was wrong. On a hunch I opened the new bottle and compared the two oil tastes... I used the new one on a later, halved recipe (to make into cupcakes) and it *was* spectacular. Obvious moral of the story? Fresh, fresh ingredients are essential.

I made this recipe without any changes EXCEPT I made it in a Bundt pan and increased the cooking time to 75 minutes.

I did have a lot of frosting left over.

Made this for a birthday. Everyone raved and I was asked for the recipe (which I had to translate into Greek!) many times over. I had no trouble with the amount of oil - the cake was not greasy. I suppose one could cut back on it a bit though. Wonderful. Do try this one!

There may be a better carrot, but I haven't tasted them yet (I've been searching bakeries for months). However, I did add 2 tsp of vanilla to the cake recipe. I love the icing, but I did I reduce the powdered sugar (to taste) to 2.5 cups down from 4 cups. One of the complaints about the recipe does make a good point - use of a neutrally favored oil is important. Also, I baked this in one round and cut then sliced the cake to make 2 layers. The only problem was that the exterior bottom edge came out a little chewy due to the extra time needed cook the cake (cooking in one pan instead of 3).

Outstanding cake - I didn't bother with the frosting. I mixed craisins, raisins and pecans, and also replaced the oil w/ 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce; and it turned out delightfully delicious. No shrinkage issues

I've made this one about 8 times in the past year. For the first 6, the cake was great, though the icing kept on varying (perhaps using lowfat creamcheese made it runnier?) The last 2 times, I used 1C unsweetened applesauce instead of 1C of oil. It rose wonderfully in the oven, but as soon as it cooled down, it shrank by about 1/3. Still tasted really good if you don't mind having a really dense cake. Oh, and doing it as 2 squares rather than 3 rounds doesn't change the taste either.

I see in the recipe reviews that this recipe was changed by many bakers -- probably because it doesn't have much flavor and there are definite errors in the sugar and vanilla measurements for the frosing. I made the cake recipe as written and the most pronouced flavor is the vegetable oil. I reduced the powdered sugar to 2.5 cups and halved the vanilla extract (after comparing it to another very tasty and reliable recipe). Also, the frosting will not cover 3 layers. I wouldn't make this again on a bet! It's terrible!

This is probably my favorite recipe that I have gotten from this site. I have made this cake a couple of times and each time it was just awesome. The only alterations for me were changing to 1 cup oil + a half cup of applesauce for the oil, and the frosting only needed about 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar. Oh, and I omit the raisins. Blech! Altogether this is a fabulous cake and I like it the best after it has been refridgerated for a few days. It seems even more moist and flavorful. Everyone who has tried this has given very positive remarks.

ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. The recipe as written probably merits 3 forks but the variations given below bring it up to 4 forks (I've never given 4 forks to any recipe before). The variations I used were: replace 1/2 cup of oil for buttermilk, add a can of drained crushed pineapple and replaced pecans for walnuts. I also added a tablespoon more of flour as the batter looked too wet. I made it in a 9x13 pan and baked for 40 minutes. The frosting is another story. I made a half a batch and used only 1 cup of powdered sugar (amount of powdered sugar in frosting is definitely a typo). 4 tsp. of vanilla changed the color of the frosting and just didn't taste right so I added some lemon zest. Will try orange zest next time instead. I love carrot cake and this is by far the BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Received rave reviews from everyone lucky enough to get a piece before it was gobbled up. The cake is good enough to eat without frosting. Will try it as cupcakes (w/ frosting) or muffins (w/o) next time. TERRIFIC!

I had never particularly cared for carrot cake before, but this was excellent. I have made it twice recently and both times it was very well liked by everyone who tried it. This is a definite keeper. Tastes great one or two days later, too!

This cake was delicious. I made it for my step-daughters 25th birthday and everyone loved it, including me. It was so moist and the frosting was delectable. I will definitely make it again. I think it was the hit of the party.

What would happen if I used 3/4c buttermilk and 3/4 applesauce, or 1/2c each of buttermilk, applesauce, and crushed pineapple instead of any oil? I'm not trying to be facetious, just trying to cut out oil if at all possible. Would these ingredients keep it moist enough, or would it lose some of its integrity? I mean, if I'm going to frost it with cream cheese frosting, it does seem kind of silly to cut out all the oil (unless I used ff cream cheese), but just for interest sake, I'm curious what might happen...

EEEK! Please help; I made this cake but cut recipe in half, baking in 13x9 pan. It was OK but just barely; tasted of baking powder but yet didn't rise enough. I've made the carrot cake in Joy and it was great every time. I know you can't increase a baking recipe by more than 4--can you not halve a recipe and expect it to work? I really would appreciate any advice and help; those on a snark mission can just be quiet and get a life. This is the first recipe from this site that hasn't worked out for me. I love this site because of all the tips I've received from other cooks;thanks!

To the Huntington Beach reviewer: I always add a can (8 oz) of drained crushed pineapple to the cake-- you can't taste the pineapple, but it makes a difference-- very moist. No need to omit anything. (Except if course you are like me and abhor raisins and nutmeg).

I make this cake all the time for my personal chef clients. Most want lowfat meals but request this again and again anyway. I'll try the applesauce/oil combo. I always use whole wheat pastry flour and it's delicious. And I've never added all the powdered sugar call for in the frosting.

Rating: 4
Like all the other reviews, this is a rave! An excellent cake. Using 1/2 c. oil and 1 c. applesauce it was still very moist and delicious. Totally agree about the frosting--you need to cut WAY down on the sugar if you like a more cream-cheesy flavor.

Rating: 3
Great cake recipe! I will definitely make it again. I have one comment on the frosting though. For those of you whose frosting came out runny, or have problems with lumps, do the following: instead on throwing all the frosting ingredients in one bowl and mixing you should first blend the cream cheese and butter toghether until smooth and creamy. Then add the little powder sugar.

I have made this cake several times and everyone loves it. Other than upping the cinnamon because we love it so much, I didn't change a thing! Everyone thinks it came from a bakery and wants my recipie. I am about to make it again, and saw all of the different suggestions. I liked it fine as is, but some of the other bakers out there have given me some interesting ideas - Thanks. Cooking and baking are all about variety and experimentation, I like playing with ingredients and creating variations.

Wonderful - actually I'd give it 3-1/2 forks! I took other's advice and used half applesauce. It came out very moist. I added crushed pineapple and doubled cinnamon. People thought I bought it at a bakery!

Fabulous! This was my first attempt at a carrot cake and it received rave reviews. I followed the suggesteion to substitute applesauce for some of the oil. Also, I used low fat cream cheese in the icing and no one noticed.

Followed recipe exactly; great cake. Moist but not too dense. Would probably 1 1/2 times frosting recipe and decrease powdered sugar as frosting was very sweet. Since cake is rich and crumbles, could have used more frosting to cover crumbs. Used ground almonds on cake to help cover crumbs.

Wow, this was definitely a huge hit! I used approximately 1 1/4 cup canola oil, added about 1/2 TB. orange zest and 1/2 TB lemon zest, along with 1/2 tsp ginger, 1 tsp. vanilla extract and doubled the cinnamon. It turned out magnificently and was devoured by 10 AM at work. I also added just a touch of lemon and orange zest to the frosting, and added a bit more butter and powdered sugar until I reached a consistency I liked. Garnished with fresh orange slices and it was beautiful!

This was an excellent carrot cake. The only thing I might do differantly next time is less raisins, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.

This is a great recipe, easy to make cake. The carrot shredding can take time, but I found using a mandolin (vs. processor) resulted in a better consistency. I also substitued half of the oil with apple sauce. Very healthy, moist and delicious. One tip, the edges might seem hard and dry to the touch, but they are actually just a little crispy and still fine to eat.

This was absolutely the most delicious carrot cake I've ever had; the outside of the cake layers carmelized as they baked, and they were lovely and cruncy on the outside, and moist on the inside. And the cream cheese icing was heaven.

This is a great, light and fluffy carrot cake (I don't like super dense cakes). I used 3/4 C oil and 1/2 C apple sauce to cut down on the fat and it still came out moist and delicious. I also cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 C. Next time, I'll try using half brown sugar and half white sugar. I used a 9 x 13" pan and baked it for 40 minutes, which was perfect, and frosted it with half the frosting. I will definitely make this again!

Excellent cake. I would cut the oil down to 1 1/4 cups next time because it actually was just a little too moist. I used 1 cup of nuts and no raisins, which worked very well.

This was the best carrot cake I've ever had, and only the second "from scratch" cake I've ever made. My guests also gave this cake a "best ever". The recipe was perfect with just a couple of modifications. I cut the sugar in the frosting in half to maintain some of the slightly sour flavor of the cream cheese. Also, substituted 1 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup olive oil for the 1 1/2 cup vegetable oil. It was still so moist I can't even imagine using more oil! Also took much less than 45 minutes to bake. I can't wait to make this again!!

This cake is to die for! I'm the star every time I make it. As suggested in earlier reviews, I cut the amount of oil in half and substitute 3/4 cup of buttermilk. Adding a small can of crushed pineapple is also great. And here's a tip on raisins, boil for a couple of minutes to plump them up. For me, the cooking time was way off, so be careful. This cake is even better on the 2nd day.

This cake was the hit of my Easter dinner! You have to try it! I added one half cup of crushed pineapple and kept the raisins. It was great! I also deleted one half cup of oil and replaced it with one half cup of applesauce. The cake still kept it's moistness. -And the icing was to die for!

Rating: 4
Wow - what a fantastic cake! I made for Easter dessert and everyone raved. I followed the directions pretty much to the note, with the exception of cooking time. My cakes cooked in much less time than 45 minutes - so just keep an eye on them. Also - a hint.. I made two of these cakes, on the first I peeled the wax paper off of the layers as they were cooling and on the second I left the wax paper on until I was ready to frost. I think 2nd cake turned out better - more moist. All in all I thought this was a fantasic and simple recipe that I will definately make again. Oh - another tip - use raisins that are marked as "baking raisins" they are much juicier and hold up better in the baking process.

Made this for Easter and everyone loved it. I ate about a 1/2 cup of the icing straight from the bowl it was so good. I halved the recipe and made two very thin layers and the baking time was about 30 minutes. I also substituted walnuts for pecans. Very moist.

Loved this cake! I made it for our Easter dinner, and it was a lovely end to our meal. Very moist. Not a piece was left. Next time I think I would reduce the sugar in the frosting a little since I prefer cream cheese frosting that is a little more tart.

Followed the recipe as written and I thought it was just okay. It was tasty enough, but I was hoping for a dense moist cake, and although this was moist enough, it seemed too fluffy (only word I can think of). I used 2 9" pans rather than 3 and they were done in 35 mins. - can't imagine using 3 pans for 45 mins. Frosting was fine

Read no further; here are everyone's suggestions (and there are about 15 printed pages of suggestions). Double Cinnamon. Use half white, half brown for sugar. For oil, use 1/2 c. oil, 1/2 c. applesauce, 1/2 c. buttermilk. Use 4 cups carrots (use food processor; it's the least mess). Use 2 cups walnuts or pecans; toast before chopping. Add 1/2 to 1 c. golden raisins (dust w/ flour before adding so they don't sink to the bottom?). Throw in 1/2 cup drained crushed pineapple. Keep ginger; add 1 t. freshed grated nutmeg. I cooked in 2 10" cake pans in separate ovens (so center wouldn't sink?). One cooked in 25 minutes, other 40. Just keep checking. Made another one without nuts and raisins and cooking time almost doubled. After cooling, wrap and freeze. Frost when frozen. I made frosting 1/2 stick unsalted butter, 1/2 regular and 1/2 non-fat cream cheese, and with lemon extract instead of vanilla and only added enough powdered sugar for good consistency. I also added toasted and chopped walnuts. Next time, I'll make in 9x13 pan and just put a dollop of frosting on top. This cake is, truly, so good, it doesn't need anything! Had 20 for dinner; everyone loved it!

Best damn carrot cake EVER! Used half oil and half applesauce. Used crushed pineapple instead of raisins (I don't like the little wrinkly things) and for the frosting I used the two packages of cream cheese with only about 1.5 cups of powdered sugar and a few tablespoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice--it wad FABULOUS! I received many compliments and requests for the recipe and have been asked to make it again and again. I am a cake GODDESS!

Everyone loved this cake. I added about 1/4 c. dark molasses because the batter didn't seem dark enough. The result was a very dark, moist cake. No, I didn't add any extra flour to compensate for the molasses. Also, I baked it in a lasagne type pan (and it worked well).

Carrot cake is a favorite in our house and this is the recipe that we have used the past few times. It is a great cake for birthdays and other special occasions. I like the fact that it does not have alot of extra ingredients (coconut or pineapple) like some carrot cake. If there are any negatives, it is that it is just too big and too rich to have around the house.

My Grandaughter and I made this cake (her first) for her Dad's 30th Birthday. We substituted Baker's whipped cream for the layers and she decorated with little tips of colored frosting, the day before and it held up perfectly great. Rave reviews were heard for a little girl's first try. attempt. She was a little skeptical about the carrots at first, however the end result was a great surprise for her. We got two requests for receipe.

I only used 2 nine inch cake pans (mainly because that's all I had and also added the 1/2 cup applesauce to replace 1/2 cup of the oil. The results were spectacular. This cake is moist and flavorful. I did change the frosting to read: 2 cups powdered sugar, 8 oz. melted white chocolate, 1 stick unsalted butter, 2 teaspoons vanilla and 1/2 tsp. lemon juice. This cake had them begging for seconds. The absolute best carrot cake I have ever eaten.

This is the second time I made this cake. This time I tripled the recipe and made a sheet cake. Won raves at work, even from non-carrot cake loving folks. I made some modifications recommended by previous posters: reduced the convectioners sugar to 2 Cups, substituted buttermilk for 1/2 the oil in the cake batter, and my own modification: walnuts instead of pecans. A great recipe!

I followed the recipe (only my 3rd try at a cake) with the only exception being three 8" pans vs. the three 9" pans. It came out wonderfully, cooking times, et al.

Fabulous! Made it twice and substituted 1/2 cup vegetable oil with 1/2 cup applesauce - no difference, just as moist. Cream cheese icing is the ultimate, but cake is still delicious without it. Bonus: unfrosted cake freezes well (although it was only in the freezer for 1 week) Made it again but substituted the entire amount of oil for applesauce - don't do it! The cake came out too solid and I had to throw it out.

How can some people rate this recipe without even trying it! It is a WOW!

I also ground up graham crackers and decorated the sides of the cake! Delicious and moist even days later!

This is a great carrot cake recipe. Huge success with friends and family. However, I did have trouble with the icing. It wasn't quite firm enough to stick to the cake initially. I worked with it for awhile and refrigerated the cake once I had the icing in place and eventually it turned out fine.

Like others, I made modifications to the cake recipe (applesauce for some oil, crushed pineapple in lieu of raisins), and loved the cake. The frosting tasted good, but I'd prefer a denser and less sweet frosting that could actually be piped. Does anyone have a cream cheese frosting like this, or would I have to use a buttercream?

Ihave not made the cake yet but will be making it for this Thanksgiving. I only have one suggestion about the walnuts. Frost the side of the cake with a thin layer of frosting and add ground walnuts all around the sides of the cake. This is another way for those of you who don't like to cook the nuts in the cake. Also with the frosting, it might be to runny if you mix to much. Only mix until just incorported.

Wow, what a recipe! I made a number of changes. First, I used a cup of applesauce in place of a cup of the oil. Omitted the raisins, used only 2 cups of powdered sugar in the frosting and used orange extract in the frosting. Froze the layers ahead of time. This cake was incredibly moist and delicious, and went over huge at my family reunion. I had several requests for the recipe. I believe the cake could be further lightened without compromising taste or texture by using all applesauce (no oil) and by making two layers instead of three, using less frosting.

After seeing all the rave reviews about this carrot cake, I couldn't wait to try it. What a huge disappointment! I was foolish enough to try it for the first time when we had company so I was not pleased! First of all, 45 min. is WAY too long to cook the layers. I left mine in for 45 min. like the recipe said, and they were way overcooked and even burnt on the edges. I made the icing exactly the way the recipe said and even though I refrigerated it for two hours before icing the cake, it was so runny. Last but not least, three 9" cake pans won't fit on one rack in the oven, when I closed the door, two of the pans got pushed together and so were not flat and the cakes turned out very uneven. Try icing a cake that has three uneven layers. Good grief, what a mess. The cake was so dry it was barely edible. A huge disappointment, BUT I will try it once more and try baking the layers for 22 minutes like one cook reccommended instead of the 45 the recipe calls for. I must say that I would think that these recipes should be tested more thoroughly before being posted so that everyone doesn't have to make so many changes to the recipe before it is a decent one.

I just made this cake for my sister's wedding - One recipe makes one 12" layer - I have made this cake dozen's of times and have received more requests for the recipe than any other cake that I have made. I use 1 cup walnuts and 1 cup raisons and nearly 4 cups grated carrots. It's a hit every time.

After reading the comments, I tried out this recipe with the following changes: replaced 1/2 c oil with 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce, replace regular raisins with floured golden raisins, reduced baking time accordingly (~35 mins?), reduced frosting sugar to 2.5 cups, added 1t lemon zest to frosting, chilled frosting before spreading. It turned out well. I probably will try a new carrot cake recipe before making this one again, but if I were to redo it, I'd decrease frosting sugar to 2c, replace the lemon zest with lemon juice or lemon extract.

And it took care of my craving, so thanks! ;) The rest of my family loves this one, though. I would definately make this one again for them, if or when they ask.

I've made this recipe many times and this is the best carrot cake ever with the following adaptation: 1. Instead of 1 1/2 cups oil, use 1 cup apple sauce (smooth) & 1/2 cup oil.

i just finished making this cake. haven't tasted it yet but it looks delicious. i didn't have enough carrots so i added some grated and squeezed zucchini. added beautiful colour and added moisture to the cake. great icing too. i had enough to pipe a shell border around the top and bottom of the cake. i also made a marzipan carrot for an added touch. looks like it came from a bakery (not bragging or anything). try this one!

Don't skimp too much on the powdered sugar - I only added 1 1/2 cups (all other ingredients as listed). With the addition of lemon it tasted great in the bowl, but it wasn't nearly sweet enough on the cake. And normally I hate sugary frosting. Next time I'm going to try 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar. Cake texture is truly amazing.

I tried michigan's recipe (april 6th i think) and another reviewer's suggestion of using lemon rind instead of vanilla - both ideas were truly delicious - nicely moist and dense. i omitted the coconut and nuts and it turned out fine. had to bake about 15 mins. longer since i was using a convection oven and i had to turn the heat down about 20 degrees. Interesting to use cooked carrots instead of raw- a bit more work but i will definitely make again. Not too oily either.

I will admit that the recipe made for a very moist cake BUT...it was way too oily tasting for me. Wonder if it would work with less oil? Added drained pineapple and coconut. Baked in a 9 x 13 cake pan. Frosting was too sweet and runny. Didn't even firm up in the fridge! I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

This was moist and delicious. I substituted pineapple for the raisins and made 2 9-inch layers instead of 3 since I only had 2 pans. I probably should've increased the baking time slightly, but it was very good. I've also made the Silver Palate carrot cake submitted by the Michigan cook in the past and like that one as well (without the coconut). I do think the cooked carrot imparts a deeper carrot flavor. I sometimes substitute 2 jars of junior carrot baby food instead of going through all the trouble of cooking and pureeing my own.

Rating: 4
This is definitely one of the best carrot recipes I've ever had. I used golden raisins(which I soaked in water so that they would not sink to the bottom). The cake itself is phenomenal and the frosting delicious. However, my family are carrot cake lovers and they thought that the frosting was too sweet and overpowered the cake. I am going to make the cake again (no layers) and use a glaze frosting. I think it would be scruptious plain! This recipe is definitely a keeper and has the potential to be used in several different ways.

Delicious! I made this for our yearly family Easter lunch and hardly had any left for my husband to take to work the next day! I added 1 cup sweetened coconut and 1 cup chopped, drained pineapple. I also used golden raisins instead of the regular kind. If you toss the raisins with flour before adding them to the batter, they will not sink to the bottom. Definately a keeper! (so says my husband!)

This triple layer carrot cake is the best! I served it for Easter and everyone loved it. To add a little different flavor, I added only 3 tsp. vanilla and then 1 tsp. lemon zest. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese. In the cake, I substituted the oil with 1/2 c butter (for flavor and tenderness) and the rest with sunsweet fat replacement. (found near the oil). No one could taste the difference. A definate keeper!

I made this for Good Friday and was definitely pleased with the outcome of the cake. As others mentioned, the flavor improved with a day's time. My family never goes back for seconds on dessert, but this cake was remarkably popular throughout the evening and following days. And I don't think they were just humoring me! Anyway, a few caveats: cutting the cake proved difficult and the raisins all sunk to the bottom of the individual layers. I've never actually used raisins in a cake before. . .perhaps I missed a well-known trick?

For a really fresh tasting cream cheese frosting, take your standard recipe and substitute freshly grated lemon rind for any vanilla extract. After tasting it with the lemon rind, any cream cheese frosting made with vanilla will taste cloying to you. Here's my standard verison: 8 oz. cream cheese, 6 tbl. softened butter, 1 1/2 tsp. freshly grated lemon rind, and approx. 1 lb. of Confectioners sugar. If I don't like the consistency, I'll add more sugar to thicken or a little water to thin.

I'm a big carrot cake fan and thought this was abolutely delicious. I too learned the hard way that you must line pans with waxed paper. Only negative: the frosting was way too sweet for me. I really like to taste the tang of the cream cheese--next time I'll cut sugar down and perhaps do as someone else suggested and add a little fresh lemon juice.

Great! I tried the carrot cake with Maple cream cheese icing also, which was very good, but my entire office voted they liked this cake just a little better. The frosting is a traditional carrot cake frosting, but it's not as sweet and heavy as some. I added a touch of ground cloves and used fresh grated nutmeg, which really helps!

Twice my family has tried this recipe and it's been disappointing twice too. We live at high altitude but even adjusting like we do for all baking recipes, it either ran over in the oven or the layers didn't rise as they should have. The frosting was good but it was the ugliest cake I have ever made. Anyone got a high altitude version for carrot cake?

A definite keeper! I left out the raisins and doubled the pecans. Tried the maple cream cheese frosting, also on this site, which I found runny even after adding a ton more icing sugar. Next time I will chill the frosting before putting it on the cake as it did eventually solidify. Just the same the reviews were magnificent. Everyone wanted the recipe.

This was an easy to make recipe and it turned out delicious! Keep in mind though this will be a very tall cake once you're done. The next time I make this I think I would sift the powdered sugar for the frosting...this might help the tiny clumps.

Delicious and easy to make. I have already made this three times and received positive feed back each time, even from people who normally aren't fans of carrot cake. I did not particularly care for the frosting, however, and have been experimenting with other cream cheese frosting recipes for this otherwise delicious cake. I have one piece of cake left over at home and can't wait to leave work so that I can devour it.

The best carrot cake I've ever tasted. Very moist. Only changes were walnuts and a cup of raisins. Made this for a birthday party, everyone raved. Will definitely make again. Agree, tastes delicious the day after too!!!!

Although an avid and experienced cook, I'm not much of a baker. I do like carrot cake though, so I tried this recipe last weekend. I thought it was one of the best things I've ever made. My only change was to add walnuts at my wife's request. Oh, and I also substituted the Maple Icing recipe also found on this site. Moist and delicious. My mistakes were only due to my "rooky-ness." Next time, I WILL NOT skip the waxpaper on the bottom of the pans, and I will be sure to bake the cakes on an upper rack and watch my oven temperature carefully.

I only used the frosting part of this recipe, and I thought it was just so-so, kind of ordinary, I've had better. It needed some lemon added to it, about 2 1/2 teaspoons. I used it for cupcakes and didn't have any trouble with spreading it. I also did not like the color that the vanilla gave it either. My favorite all time carrot cake recipe is from the Oct. '91 Bon Appetit, Carrot Cake with Lemon Cream Cheese Frosting, this is another triple carrot cake, not on this site currently.

I did a combination of this recipe and Michigan's recipe (located in the reviews). I like my carrot cake loaded with lots of goodness. So, taking a few tips from "Michigan," I omitted the raisins but added 1 cup of pineapple, 1 cup of coconut and 1 cup of finely chopped walnuts. I upped the sugar and the flour to 2 and a half cups and added vanilla. This was my compromise. The result was out of this world! Definitely one of the best I've tasted. I didn't have any trouble with the icing being too soft...actually it was a little too thick and hard to spread--but yummy!!

I used 1C oil and 1/2 applesauce. It was extremely moist. It could have easily used more apple sauce and less oil. Everyone loved it, even my husband who prior to trying this insisted he doesn't like carrot cake. I will definately use this recipe again.

Let me begin by saying that I can't stand when people take good desert recipes and transform them into low-fat, tasteless ones. My motto is "if you are going to eat desert, eat desert!" However, since I was only making this for my husband and myself who are both on diets I decided to experiment and make a low-fat cake on a whim. I replaced all of the vegetable oil in the cake with applesauce and replaced the four eggs with five egg whites. For the frosting I replaced the cream cheese with 1/3 Less Fat Philedelphia Cream Cheese (Neufshatel?) and omitted the butter. I had to refrigerate the frosting a little to harden it some before using because it was a little runny. I watched eagerly as my critical, picky, and very skeptical carrot cake conniseur husband tasted it..."very good...very, very good...beautiful cake"! was his answer and I have to agree! It was very, very moist, easy to make, had all the great flavor of carrot cake AND was guilt free.

This cake is absolutely wonderful!!! My husband & I made it together and as soon as it was finished we made another one! Everyone who tried it loved it! The perfect carrot cake recipe....however we substituted the frosting with the one from the CARROT CAKE WITH MAPLE-CREAM CHEESE ICING (in Epicurious).This is a perfect combination!!!

Rating: 4
Re the frosting -it is essential not to overbeat - the more you do the thinner it gets & people add more icing to thicken it up which doesnt work & just makes it too sweet. I used butter rather than margarine as it sets harder obviously. Soften it & the cream cheese either by leaving it out or you could microwave it for a very short time but do not let it start to melt. Beat these together until just combined then lightly fold in your icing sugar (a little lemon juice is nice)- you dont need all the sugar the recipe says - taste as you go till it is right for you then refrigerate. Pure icing sugar will also set harder than icing mix.

I also made the recipe from Michigan and followed it as written. It was a lot of batter, enough to make a double layer round cake and an 8x8 suare pan as well. I took it for coffee to my family on Sunday and everyone said it was wonderful. It was very filling and moist. I loved the frosting and personally would not change a thing. I think I'll try the actual epicurious recipe too just to compare but I am sure to keep that wonderful Michigan recipe and will for sure make it again!

This cake won rave reviews at my Christmas dinner party. Everyone wanted the recipe. I made it once before as a trial run and brought it to work. My co-workers loved it too! I did make some changes. Used only 1 1/4 cups oil, omitted the raisins and nutmeg and doubled the pecans and cinnamon. Sprinkled the top with chopped pecans as well. I usually don't eat carrot cake and I love this cake!

I have been making this cake since the recipe first appeared. I make it in a 13x9 pan and make half the icing, my kids love it. I have been begged for the recipe and have used it in my catering days as well with some minor modifications. I always use more pecans and toast them as well. I just had to get on here to find this recipe again for my new man's birthday tommorow.(he'll probably propose when he tastes it!)

I made this recipe for the first time today with much success. The cake turned out delicious & moist. You always know you have a winner when someone asks for the recipe. I had several requests. I did not use nutmeg but did use alittle more cinnamon & all spice, no raisins-8 oz. can of drained crushed pineapple instead. Used "fine pecan meal" (finely chopped) & my food processor for the carrots. I baked in two 9" round cake pans at 350 for about 25-30 mins. For the frosting I used 1 pkg of 8 oz. cream cheese, 3 cups Powdered sugar, 1 stick of softened unsalted butter, 2 t. vanilla, a bit of milk, & approx. 1 t. of cinnamon. You may want to eliminate the milk or I may have over beat the frosting, spread very easily yet you do have to keep refrigerated before serving. A friend told me she liked the frosting. Says it was light & not too rich. I highly recommend this cake! Look over all the reviews & see which tips sound the best to you. Alittle here alittle there. Works for me!!

My husband had requested a carrot cake for his birthday, and I chose this recipe. Wow, what a keeper! The cake was moist, not oily as some are. I used golden raisins and added more nuts that callled for (I also toasted them first, yum!). I divided the batter into two pans, then split the layers for a total of four, frosting the tops but not the sids. For the frosting, I omitted the 4th cup of powdered sugar and added some homemade orange marmalade, chilled it well and then frosted the cake. The touch of citrus from the marmalade really enhanced the flavor! I topped the cake with more chopped, toasted pecans My father-in-law went nuts when he tasted it, saying, "This is the way a carrot cake should be...it's perfect!"

The score of 4 is for the Michigan Carrot Cake recipe--maybe there is a lot of sugar, however, we are eating "CAKE" here! I think I will leave out the coconut next time and add raisins instead, only because I prefer them. Also, it made 3 9" layers, not 2 layers. This was really good! (The recipe is listed in the reviews.)

I have made this cake many times because so many people request it!!! This cake is simple and practical since so many of the recipe items already exist in my pantry.

The best carrot cake I have ever eaten. I knew it was good when my mom ask that I make it again. We took the extra frosting, added food coloring, put it in pastry bag, and created carrots with leaves. We also had a cake plate supported by little rabbits, so it looked great, too.

This cake dominated the Christmas dessert table. Everyone fought over the last few morsels. Even people who don't usually eat carrot cake came out of the woodwork! I prepared and froze the layers beforehand and iced it the day before. I iced it by generously topping and filling -- letting it ooze down the sides, as well as dusting the top with finely chopped pecans. I omitted the raisins, used a heaping cup of walnuts, added 8 oz crushed pineapple and a cup of coconut. I took the other reviewer's advise and substituted applesauce for part of the oil and reduced the sugar. It was still VERY flavorful, rich and had a perfect texture. I think making it with the original oil and sugar would have been cloying.

This has been the only carrot cake recipe I've used since it was first published in 1994. It is the absolute best and is one of the most requested cakes I make. I omit the raisins and nuts and quite often double the cake recipe and increase the frosting by 1/2. Since the layers are fairly thin, I find it makes a more impressive presentation to build it 4 or 5 layers high. And my family never has a problem finishing off the extra layers, even without frosting!

So, I gave this recipe to my sister to take to a potluck BBQ celebrating her husband's new job at the boss' home - risky since we had not tried it yet - of course it was a great hit. Or maybe it wasn't a hit, as the other desserts brought by longtime employees wives were overlooked while this one was devoured.....oops. Why is this a top rated recipe? Besides the great taste, it has eye appeal that is not usually associated with what was typically a single layer flat-pan type of cake. It is a wonderful way to re-introduce the common carrot cake taste, so popular in the eighties, in a new way, to new audiences, or even audiences who thought they knew the carrot cake and had made their final opinions. Another thought - perhaps many of these cooks are 'new' - and have not previously had a chance or been responsible for baking, therefore this recipe is truly a discovery. Or, perhaps they are like myself, always searching and testing out 'new' desserts vs well-known desserts, tried and true. The cream cheese icing is a treat, as so many recipes were later adapted sans icing, in keeping with low fat and healthier lifestyles. If you want to have some fun and be on the receiving end of rave reviews, try this one (again)! Enjoy.

I love this recipe. It really is an excellent cake. To the cook from Philadelphia, is it possible that the frosting was overmixed? I have found that the longer it is beaten, the thinner it gets.

I used a small can of crushed pineapple (8oz.), drained instead of the raisins and nuts. It was a great cake, although a bit labor intensive since I didn't have a food processor to grate the carrots and had to do it by hand. The frosting was perfect. To the reader in Phily, mix the powdered sugar in 1 cup at a time. I also made sure that the cream cheese still had a little bit of "chill" to it, not room temperature. This is the new favorite in our house.

This web site is great not only for the recipes, but also because the previous reviewers help hone the recipe. I used a half cup less sugar in the cake, which i made in advance and froze so it would be easier to ice (and this really did work).

While I'm not a fantastic baker, I can really make some nice desserts, so I was very disappointed when I followed this recipe. The cakes were dry, and oh the icing - it was so loose, cakes were toppling over (even after cooling in fridge for a while). Glad I didn't make it for a special occasion, it would have been really embarrassing! Can't figure out where I went wrong, apparently everyone else said it was superlative. Finally, I've tried different carrot cakes recipes over the last 20 years and I've never had one turn out "dry".

I omit the nutmeg (ugh) and the raisins and add 1 cup of crushed canned pineapple instead. Can't taste the pineapple, but man oh man does it make the cake moist. I guess all that oil helps too.

I loved this recipe! Very easy and delicious. I did also follow other's advice and replaced 1/2 cup oil with 1/2 cup buttermilk. Also I don't like raisins in cakes so I used crushed pineapple. The frosting was a bit too sweet so I'll reduce the sugar in it next time. The frosting was also too thin when I applied it to the layers so I couldn't apply a thick coat but it was just as well as I don't like too much frosting. I was left w/ a lot of unused frosting. After refridgeration, the frosting did solidify nicely. Everyone at my son's b-day party/Father's day celebration loved it too! I can't wait to make it again.

This cake was absolutely delicious! It was easy to make, but tasted like I'd spent all day on it. Everyone loved it and there were no left-overs. I'm going to make it for my boyfriend's mom's b-day. That's how much I trust it.

This carrot cake is delicious. I wanted to compare it with the one I have been using, and the one I have is even better. It is 3 layers also, with a caramel frosting between the layers, and cream cheese frosting top and sides. The cake also has crushed pineapple as well as raisins, pecans, and coconut. It's from a wonderful unknown cookbook from Maple Valley WA. The unknown author, Charlene Upson, has 316 pages of secret ingredient recipes. She made the cookbook originally for her family, but Barnes and Noble and Borders carry it. It's called "It's A Secret!"

No need to look any further for a carrot cake recipe - this is it! My husband said it was the best carrot cake he's ever tasted, and he's tough to please. I only used half the amount of raisins and used a half cup of chopped pineapple. I also didn't cook it as long. Yummm!

My 11 and 13 year old daughters made this cake for me for Mother's Day and it was fantastic. We substituted 1/2 cup buttermilk for 1/2 cup oil and used crushed pineapple instead of raisins. The frosting was the best part and we really enjoyed eating it. I'm going to be making this one again.

This is without a doubt the best carrot cake I have ever made or tasted. Like other reviewers, I left out the raisins. Serves a crowd - perfect for parties or when you have house guests. I put some of the icing in a bag and piped a row of stars around the top edge. Beautiful and easy.

Yummy! I made a couple of alterations: I abhor rasins, so I added 8 ounces crushed pineapple (drained, of course) instead. Though you can't taste the pineapple, it seems to really make a delicious difference. And I can't stand nutmeg in desserts, so I simply left it out. This is by far the best carrot cake ever! Don't skimp on the oil. It may seem like a lot, but the moistness of the cake will make you forget about all those calories!

I'm a carrot cake lover but this cake will make those who don't think they like carrot cake convert. I didn't use the oil. Instead, I used 1/2 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of buttermilk. I also omitted the raisins. This cake is wonderful!

Absolutely delicious! I made it for my son's 1st holy communion and it was superb. I also ommitted the raisins and added 1/2 c. crushed pineapply and used 1c. oil and 1 stick butter. It was very tasty and fluffy. The whole cake was gone in about 10 minutes.

I included this cake in my Easter dinner menu. It was delicious and easy to make. As some of the reviewers advised, I decreased the oil in the cake batter, substituting 1/2 cup of buttermilk for 1/2 cup of the oil. I used 3 cups of powdered sugar and one half stick of butter in the frosting. Orange peel in the frosting is a nice touch. This is by far the best orange cake I have ever tasted.

Three pieces of advice.... 1) why use 1 1/2 cups of flavorless vegetable oil when you can use something I call "nectar of the gods". BUTTER!!! That's right, you can sub all 1 1/2 cups for salted butter or so a partial sub (1/2 cup = 1 stick). 2) add 1/2 cup of crushed pineapple...as Emeril would say, it kicks it up notches unknown to mankind (and please keep the raisins in there) 3) Take the pineapple syrup from the crushed pineapple can and boil it down with some granulated sugar until you have 1 tablespoon or less. Then add it to your frosting for some good Pineapple Cream Cheese Frosting!!!

I hate to admit that I have never made it myself, but my sister has become famous for it. She has made it dozens of times and gets in trouble when she doesn't bring it to family gatherings. It's awesome.

This is really great carrot cake. The first time I made it, the layers were dense and didn't rise much. The second time, I really whipped the sugar and vegetable oil well, then whipped well after adding each egg. The end result was less dense and (I think) a little higher.

I made this cake for my daughters 1st birthday. It was so easy. I did however omit the raisins and added 1/2 c. crushed pineapple. I made the cake a day ahead of time and frosted the refridgerated layers the next day adding marzipan veggies for decoration. It was lovely and the best carrot cake we'd ever eaten!

Made this cake for Easter and it was perfect! I cut the oil in the cake with buttermilk and decresed the amount of sugar by 1/2 cup. I also decreased amount of sugar in frosting as well, and used 1 block fat free cream cheese and 1 block regular. The only problem I had was that I baked this cake at 9300 ft. and all three layers sunk in the middle!! Operator error, no doubt. It was hilarious, so I just added extra frosting on the top layer to make it more even. I sprinkled chopped nuts on top too. Will totally make again; the whole family loved it!

This cake, obviously by all accounts, is wonderful. My layers didn't rise either... But I don't think they are supposed to rise too much. Anyway, I left out the raisins and the nuts (the raisins on purpose, the nuts fell on the floor!) and added coconut. Really delicious. Now, if someone could just teach me how to frost a cake!

This was a wonderful carrot cake! I made it for my in-laws, they couldn't get enough of it. It was very moist and relatively easy to prepare (hint, although baby carrots are sweeter, they are a PAIN to grate by hand!) I didn't have pecans or raisins, so I substituted walnuts and craisins (dried, sweetened cranberries). The craisins really gave it an interesting, delicious flavor!

I cut this recipe in half because (a) I only had 2 cake pans and (b) it was only for me & a few other people, not a crowd. Instead of 2 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting, I used 1½ and omitted the butter because I had forgotten to take it out of the frig. Everyone commented the cake was marvelous. I felt it was just as carrot cake should be.

I made this cake with a few revisions and it came out great! First of all I thought that 1 1/2 cups of oil was insane so I used 3/4 of a cup plus 3/4 of a cup of buttermilk. Also I decreased the amount of sugar from 2 cups to 1 1/2 cups. For the frosting I used one reg. cream cheese and one reduced fat and only half a stick of butter and only 2 cups of powdered sugar and the frosting was still very sweet and the texture was perfect. The result of these modifications was the most delicious and super moist carrot cake that I have ever had!

Absolutely wonderful! The carrot cake was so moist and delicious. I'm not a big fan of carrot cake, but I'll definitely make this one again. The frosting was a tad too sweet for my taste, so next time, I will use a little bit less sugar. Even my best friend, who is skeptical of my cooking, said it was excellent. I'll just let her think that I've developed some actual cooking skills. =)

My sister-in-law made this cake for a birthday party and it was fabulous. Soooo moist and rich. I have made it twice myself since then and here's one problem I have experienced both times. EACH LAYER IS AS FLAT AS A PANCAKE. NO RISING ACTION HAPPENING. THE TIME TIME AROUND IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT I TRY FRESH BAKING POWDER SO I DID THAT THE SECOND TIME AND STILL FLAT AS A PANCAKE. SHOULD I BE WHIPPING THE SUGAR AND OIL MIXTURE UNTIL IT IS LIGHT, WERE THE CARROTS TOO MOIST - ANY SUGGESTIONS PLEASE - I WOULD LIKE TO TRY IT AGAIN AND ALTHOUGH IT STILL TASTES DELICIOUS, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME HEIGHT IN MY 3-LAYER CAKE.

This was the first carrot cake I ever made, and it tasted great. Two people who said they didn't care for carrot cake ate the most. I forgot to put the wax paper in the pans, and that made the cakes hard to remove, forcing me to use the icing to hold the cake. Still delicious though.

This is basically the same recipe I've been making for years that everyone raves about, with 2 changes: My recipe has more cinnamon (3t.) and no nutmeg, and I add 1/2 cup of unsweetened coconut, as someone else suggested.

I could not believe the reviews about how easy and delicious. I'm a believer now! The cake disappeared so fast, there weren't even crumbs left. I added ginger for added spice.

Absolutely delicious. This was made as a birthday cake for a "non-cake loving" friend. After having been unsuccessful at buying the famed carrot cake recipe from a local restaurant, I found this recipe. I made it without the nuts and raisins but every bite was so delicious that you didn't notice they weren't in there. I made the cake layers the night before and iced the cake the next day. It was so moist. There was ample icing, an unlikely scenario for most recipes. And he absolutely loved it. No longer will he rely on that restaurant for his carrot cake!
