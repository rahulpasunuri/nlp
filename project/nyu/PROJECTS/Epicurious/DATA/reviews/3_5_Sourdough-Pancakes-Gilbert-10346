I have been looking for a recipe such as this from my childhood. We would wake early in the morning, reach into the fridge and pull out a pitcher of batter and have great pancakes or waffles, then just add to the 'starter' and begin again. I also like being able to make it the night before, saves time. I followed the directions and it turned out beautiful. Thank you for a great recipe. It deserves the full four fork rating. p.s. to the cook from Seattle - I don't think you are being fair - that you judge this recipe according to your own fortune of having a 'true sourdough'. As most household cooks do not, this is a great starter recipe. The one fork rating is based on comparison of your own starter and is therefore, inaccurate. This is a good recipe and hope that readers will try it.

Woah girlfriend in Seattle. I'd love to go into my ancestry of sourdough, from my great grandmother in Arkansas, so the "real" sourdough of Alaska, but, make not judgement. Yeast is yeast whether it comes from potato water, commercial yeast, whey, hops, beer, or the man in the moon. No offense, but I think this is a great, EASY, recipe. I do agree, the more aged, the more sour and I keep starter going year round. I prefer the really "eggy" flat style of sourdough pancakes so I used and extra large egg. Might use 1 and 1/2 next time. Maybe not quite as good as grandma's, but I'll take it any day! I think I can only give "full" fork scoring, but if I could, I'd go 3 1/2 forks.

I love the taste of yeast and these pancakes were easy and delicious. A little prep in the evening means a lot less work in the morning. Perfect!

I have made these pancakes over and over, and My Family LOVES them. If you don't live in San Fran, or know someone who has a "starter" or want to bother with "real" soughdough - Make these Pancakes - they are awesome. I use the recipe exactly as it is written - but you must have them with REAL butter and REAL maple syrup !

I've been making sourdough pancakes for YEARS! I have my mother's soughdough starter which she got from her mother, who probabaly got it from her mother (the starter is at least 50 years old, that I know of - probably older than that). These are NOT sourdough pancakes. Sourdough pancakes are made with a sourdough starter, not comercial yeast! There's no comparison in taste. The difference is like comparing Wonder Bread to real San Francisco Sourdough Bread. If you know someone with a starter, ask them for some and how to feed and care for it (this is the BEST way because it means the sourdough has at least a little age to it). If you do not know someone, there are numerous old time bread baking books with recipes for starting a new starter. Most will use either live culture yogurt or fermented potato water. It will take at least 1-3 weeks to get it started. After that, if you feed it every two weeks, or every time you use it, it will last you a lifetime, and even generations.
