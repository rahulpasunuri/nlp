How does this even count as a recipe? Throwing together some chicken with a the sauce packet from frozen vegetables is something that even the most beginning cook can do without thinking. This is a waste of space, and shameless pandering. Was it sponsored by Minute Rice, or something?

I have to agree with other reviewer complaints about use of frozen vegetables. Although they are nutritious, stir-fries need fresh crunchy vegetables. If one is really in a hurry just use the packages of precut fresh veggies in the produce section. And REALLY it's quick to make real rice!! Tastes much better, too.

I don't agree with the reviewer who said that frozen veggies shouldn't be in any Epicurious recipe; frozen veggies are actually more nutritious, since they are processed right after picking. However, Minute rice is tasteless and that is something that I wouldn't even buy, let alone eat.

What's not to like about this recipe--well, maybe the brown rice (I used white rice)? It was certainly quick and easy, and it tasted great.
