Has anyone tried this with Blood Oranges? Might give it a try...

Great recipe, perfect blend of acid and sweet, cream and crunch. I don't usually make desserts but I ahd a bunch of kumquats from our co-op and found your recipe. Orange and fennel is a classic combo but obviously not for the vanilla pudding palate! I made it once as indicated and again with a ricotta-marscapone-egg filling that I baked, without a crust. No crunch but delicious and saved alot of time not having to make and bake the crust. Maybe I should add some toasted pine nuts for the crunch...

I'd like to give this 3.5 forks. I took it to a party and it was a hit - every bit was eaten and many said it was fabulous. I made it just like the recipe. Slicing and seeding the kumquats is a little tedious, but it's not hard - you just have to have a really sharp knife. Just know that it takes a little time. The filling was a little thinner than I expected. I loved the taste with the toasted fennel, I was just expected a stiffer texture. Maybe I stirred too vigorously? The crust was good, easy to work with (as others, I had to use a spoon or two of ice water.) It stuck to my tart pan, so one part of the edge broke off when I was transferring to the serving platter. I will use another favorite sweet tart dough, next time (and there will be a next time) but this one is OK. I sprinkled some pomegranate seeds over the top before serving just for a little more color - the pinkish red with the orange slices were great together.

While the candied kumquats and crust on this tart were delicious, the toasted fennel ruined the filling. Next time I will substitute vanilla for the fennel.

I am not an experienced cook, but I was able to produce a bakery quality tart using this recipe. My tart pan is 11 1/2 inches but it worked fine. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. My guests assumed that I had purchased it and were very impressed to find out that I made it myself. It was time consuming but well worth the effort. I will definitely be making this again as soon as enough kumquats ripen on our tree!

Even though the slicing did take a while, I agree that it was worth it. The toasted fennel added just the right flavor. My mom said "It's perfect! Who comes up with these things?"

This recipe sounds great, just one question....What do you do with the kumquat leaves?

I think that the previous reviewers must have made a different recipe. Either that, or the people who ate it lied! I have made many of the recipes on this site, and this is by far the worst one ever! My husbands response was "it would be okay if these orange things were scraped off." Don't waste your time!

Followed the recipe exactly as presented in Gourmet and the results were spectacular. Had no problem slicing the tart and in fact cut the 12 inch tart into eight equal size and very generous slices after a filling poached salmon meal. I explained to the guests that I had to completely serve the tart as my wife and I would eat what ever was not served and we didn't really need this tempting dessert haunting us through the night. Might also mention that even though the tart is fairly easy to prepare and serve there is one part of the preparation that will take some amount of patience. In slicing the kumquats you will encounter the seeds which will be of various size and number that don't really relate to the size of the kumquat. All of our fruit came from one dwarf tree that grows on our deck in Florida. I believe it took me as long to go through the slicing and seeding process as it did to assemble the rest of the tart and bake the crust. The results are worth every bit of the effort.

I made this tart as dessert for a twelve course Chinese New Year dinner party this past weekend. Even though everyone was already stuffed after the first 11 courses, not a crumb was left on their dessert plates! Everyone loved it and all agreed it was a five star dessert. I followed the crust recipe as given, though it needed a couple of tablespoonfuls of iced water to bring it to the right consistency. This was the best tart crust recipe I've ever made - crispy and not heavy. The only change I made to the tart was that instead of using the ricotta filling I substituted a simple pastry cream with a little whipped cream folded in to lighten it. Hint: pre slice tart to desired number of sections (but maintaining the tart shape) before placing kumquats on top and glazing - makes serving much easier. I served slices over creme anglais with raspberry coulis, scoop of lychee sorbet, fresh berries and mint leaves. Visually pleasing and yummy!!
