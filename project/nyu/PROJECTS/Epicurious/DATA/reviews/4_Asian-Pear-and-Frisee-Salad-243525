I make this salad for special occasions and it is always very impressive. It's a little complicated for a salad, but pairs FANTASTICALLY with the provencal rack of lamb recipe also on this site. Make them both for a dinner party or special dinner and you will be a super star.

I have made this a few times now and everyone is always very impressed. I just try and keep the secret as to how easy it is to make!
