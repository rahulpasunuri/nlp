Perfect Spring dessert. Perfect way to use up all the excess Sweetzels Ginger Snaps that my dad sends to me - one more Philly sensation that I miss dearly in old VA....

Really yummy recipe! Requires a bit of effort, but definitely worth it. I would recommend Anna's Ginger Thins for the crust--they work brilliantly.

This pie is fantastic! Everyone who ate it found they had to have more. It wasn't too hard to make, either, and unlike other chiffon pies I've attempted to make, it gelled. I will try letting the gelatin/lemon/egg mixture set up a little longer before I added the whipped cream--I would've liked it to have been taller. And the reviewer's suggestion to get more taste from the crust is worth considering. I usually buy Nyakers-pepparkakor ginger snap cookies (at World Market) but didn't have any, so bought whatever brand the grocery store sold. I added crystallized ginger (which I buy from Amazon.com; the kind in the spice aisle of the grocery stores is overpriced and dried out til it's hard to mince). But the crust wasn't very gingery. However, I'm not sure I want a crust that's more gingery--I want the focus to be on the lemon chiffon. Which was scrumptious! Definitely use fresh lemons and lemon zest.

Dreamy!!! Puckery tart-sweet, and what a texture! To insure a really gingery crust, taste the 'snaps to make sure they have the right stuff... if they don't, add more crystallized ginger to compensate. I sprinkle some ground cookie on top, too--very pretty.

Domed up nicely because I chilled it just as written. Not enough lemon zing! Also the crust was hard and unmanagable. I used half graham crackers and half gingersnaps, but still the crust was solid as a rock.

I made this pie today and it came out great. After reading previous reviews I heated the filling to 180 ̊F and cooled it to 60 ̊F. I used whipping cream, not heavy whipping cream. After folding it all together I poured it into the pie shell and it made an attractive mounded center about 1/2 inch higher than the edges. If you want a really pronounced mounded effect I would suggest cooling the lemon mixture some more and using heavy whipping cream. I used a 9 inch glass pie dish that was 1 1/2 inches tall. There was more than enough filling.

Made a Raspberry Lemon Chiffon version which was delicious. Made a shortbread crust (10 oz crushed shortbread cookies + 1/4 c unsalted butter, melted)in food processor, baked 350 F, 9 minutes. Brushed cooled crust with 1/4 c seedless raspberry jam and then topped with 1 cup fresh raspberries. Made lemon chiffon as directed except thickened to 180 F. Also chilled in water bath longer (til slightly set like thick egg whites)thus when folded in whipped cream it was thicker so mounded perfectly in pie shell. Served garnished with lemon twists, raspberries and mint with a raspberry coulis. Wonderful!

If your having trouble mounding the filling it's because the gelatin/lemon curd didn't chill enough. This recipe can also be lightened up by whipping the egg whites and cutting back on the whipping cream. Still an amazingly light lemon taste. Great recipe served with fresh strawberries as well.

Well this is fabulous. Super easy and just delicious. Followed recipe exactly and had the same reaction as others: Uh oh, why isn't this coming together? The filling is very liquidy even with the cream folded in -- I added a couple of dollops of creme fraiche for more body just in case. No mounding in the center. However it set up perfectly, served with a sprinkling of crushed gingersnaps and some fresh berries. Springy and perfect for pre-Easter dinner!

Like previous reviewers, I had problems mounding the cake in the middle. It set perfectly though, and it was really yummy! The crust wasn't ginger-y enough for me so next time I'm going to mince some more, maybe 2 or 3 tsp. I think it would be nice to stick raspberries in the chiffon too, because I think the flavours go really well together.

This is surprisingly easy to make and deliciously cool and citrusy for summer. I made it first for father's day and had the same trouble 'mounding' the filling that other reviewers mentioned. However the 2nd time I made it I cooked the lemon mixture just a little longer (until a good coat formed on the spoon) and chilled the whipped cream/lemon mix in the bowl for 15 minutes before transferring it to the pie shell. It mounded much better this way.

Let me start with the full disclosure that despite how delicious the crust sounds, I used a prepared (organic, whole wheat) graham cracker crust. In every other way, I followed the recipe to the letter. I found it easy, forgiving (it said not to let the curd boil - oops), and absolutely delicious. Light, airy, yet quite rich. Nice and tart. Mmmm.

Awesome!!! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out nice, silky and lemony! Very easy recipe. Will definately make again.

It also works very nicely with a graham cracker crust.

Made this for an Easter dinner dessert...wonderful! Followed recipe exactly as written (8 min.) and had no problem with a hard crust. The only thing I might do differently next time is whip the cream a touch longer. I was afraid of over whipping so the filling didn't mound up the way it could.

This recipe was fabulous. Although I kept getting interrupted the gelatin sat for hours and was still perfect. This was my first attempt at using gelatin and I was a bit worried but it as so light and fluffy. Mine didn't mound as it was runny at first so perhaps if you let it sit a bit before you pour it in the crust

This is easy to make and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderful. It's a great alternative to a chocolate dessert. Regarding the other comments - I used four egg yolks and didn't think it was too eggy at all. My crust wasn't hard after baking but it relaxed and hardened up when it cooled. Yes, it was tough to cut but a sharp knife and deliberate hand did the trick.

I've made this several times and have had rave compliments. Exception, I find the gingsnap crust to be very had to cut - any suggestions?

I thought this recipe was superb! I followed it to a T & thought it came out great. It's a nice, refreshing dessert to make in the summer. I made it for a dinner party & everyone raved about it!!

I made this just as the recipe said and it came out perfect. Light, fluffy, and refreshing. I made two for a party and they dissapeared right away.

Very light and refreshing. Like the cook from Peoria, I found the filling difficult to "mound" when putting it in the shell but it firmed up in the refrigerator.

Used 3 eggs instead of 2. Filling was tart and perfect but I overcooked the crust I think and it came out ROCK HARD. Kept waiting for it to turn color and firm up and that took about 10 min instead of 6. Anyone else have that problem?

Everyone enjoyed this dessert but I found the filling too "eggy." I would recommend 3 yolks, or even 2.

My girlfriend and I made this pie for a potluck. It was delicious! I loved the texture, and the pairing of lemon and gingersnap flavors is brilliant. YUM!

Having made several different pies on gingersnap crust, this appealed to me as it seemed light and a delicious contrast to a heavy Thanksgiving dinner. In fact it was! I followed the recipe exactally and actually think the crystallized ginger is a must. It disappeared amongst many other choices.

The crust was great, but the chiffon pie was only adequate. Not bad, but lacked the "pop" I was looking for in a lemon based cake.

Very, VERY delish!!!! Follow the recipe and use juice from lemons and the rind from the lemons. Don't use store-bought juice or the little spice rack rind on those 2 ingredients; they are what make the pie a stand-out. One problem I had was I made it in a Pampered Chef pie pan, and you don't spray those. So it was very difficult getting that tasty crust to come out with the pie. So next time I make it, I will use a different pie pan.

I would use one less egg than called for, and omit the crystallized ginger unless you are preparing it for ginger fans. Great summer dessert.

I've made this recipe 2 or 3 times now and absolutely love it. I like to add an extra teaspoon or 2 of crystalized ginger, and Freeze the pie, and it is extremely light and refreshing tasting. I've given the recipe to a few people at work, and hopefully CUPPY loves it as much as everyone else! I think this pie is almost as good as that letter I wrote at work to that one person..

My filling was not thick enough to mound as the recipe instructs, but it did firm up nicely after chilling. The gingersnap crust is an important element, because when paired with lemon these flavors really shine.

Great pie. Made this at high altitude in Winter Park, CO and just made sure not to overheat the filling. It turned out great! Very light filling is a nice balance with the crunchy crust. Everyone enjoyed it.

Followed the recipe to the letter and this is a simple, yet elegant summer dessert. Not too sweet with just the right amount of tart lemon. Be careful about sitting it out too soon or too long in really hot, humid weather. As a child, my Mother made a version of this pie and no disrespect to Mom, but this does Mom one better! One might want to try it with a graham cracker crust if gingersnaps are not to your liking. I've made it three times this summer already and it has been a big hit each time.
