I thought this worked well. I grilled the swordfish with a little salt, pepper and olive oil. I used a pretty generic brand of pimento stuffed olives (B&G), a medium garlic clove (perhaps a couple of teaspoons chopped). I made the recipe as is and used on 1.1 lbs of fresh swordfish. Perhaps it would have been a little over powering on 12 ounces of fish. I think the pimento's in the green olives helped temper the dish. Kalamata's would have overpowered the flavors. (and I love Kalamata olives, I can snack on them my blood preasure causes my doc to have a heart attack9.

Perhaps it was the olives, perhaps it was the fish, perhaps it was the cook, but this certainly will NOT go into my recipe hall of fame. The relish didn't taste all that great on its own, then overpowered the fish.

Soso. Caution- use a little, little garlic clove. I love garlic and used a juicy one and it was too much. Certainly quick and easy and it does pack a flavor punch.

I've made this a couple of times, and we love it! I think this olive relish would even do well beside a cheese/cracker tray for a party. Delicious!

This was very good. We like to grill fish often and the relich jazzes it up a bit. To the Montreal cook who was confused about the anchovies...I think the cook from FL simply neglected to mention they added the anchovies on their own (as did I, I might add!) There is a recipe on this same page that involves green olives and anchovies and I think they might have confused recipes.

We loved this recipe - simple and easy to prepare, too! We broiled the fish and added a few kalamata olives. Our suggestion is not to add additional oil to the fish as the relish has plenty for it to be moist. This would be a great topping for bruschetta.

I made this dish for my family and they loved it. However, next time I would not brush the fish with olive oil before cooking it. In my opinion, the olive oil is not necessary, due to the olive relish I found it to be a bit on the oily side. I would rather sautee the fish in a Tablespoon or two of butter. Still a fabulous dish.

I was looking for a quick recipe for swordfish and thought I was in luck with this one. As I began reading the comments I noticed that one mentioned anchovies in the recipe. I must haveread the ingredients 20 times -- no anchovies. I am a seasoned enough cook to know approximately how many should be added to the recipe if need be. However, this little experience kind of left me uneasy. I refer a lot to epicurious recipes for ideas and many times I am looking for sophisticated recipes for guests. I am now wondering how many of the available recipes actually have ingredients missing?

My fiance and I love olives, so we found this to be extremely tasty!! (Better than most restaurant dishes.) The recipe is delicious, light and unique! We did use about a tsp of anchovy paste instead of the fillets, and it was wonderful.

the relish was great- have even used it with tuna and it was delicious.

The relish was excellent, I combined Kalamata olives with the green olives. I served it with grilled asparagus, and grilled some corn on the cob as well.

Very nice combination of taste and texture. Be sure to actually do it on the grill. I used a ridged grilling pan, which made the fish tough and less enjoyable. Still passable in the winter, but good swordfish is worth waiting for.

This was very good! We barbequed prime cut swordfish filets with a touch of mesquite chips. The contrast with the olive relish was very tasty. We opened a nice bottle of chardonnay to go with it. I have also made this recipe using fresh Blue Marlin...delicious also, but needs to to basted as it is leaner than swordfish. Very Yummy!

If you are an olive lover, then this dish is for you! I have made this twice, and the second time I made it both green and Kalamata olives. Both were delicious. I loved the relish so much I have tried it other meats and fish. I think this is a must try!

Enjoyable relish but strong. I have other recipes for swordfish that are better. I did not regret fixing the dish but I would not bother again.

Truly magnificent flavor combination. Extremely easy to prepare and serve. We had a fabulous, and fabulously easy meal of watercress soup, grilled eggplant, and the swordfish. The raves are still resounding. Wine suggestion: a Beringer Chardonnay, which complemented the fish perfectly.

This recipe converted a non-fish eater! The fresh lemon juice combines quite well with the saltiness of the olives. Double the recipe, your guests will appreciate the extra portion.
