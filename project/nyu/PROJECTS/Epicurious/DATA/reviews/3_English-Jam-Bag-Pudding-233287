delicious! tons of effort, but worth it for a special weekend treat.

pretty tasty--my husband is a Brit though he's never heard of this. But being a Brit he's amassed a huge marmalade collection that his American friends keep giving him! I don't like marmalade, but the recipe does say to use your favorite jam--I recommend doing so!
