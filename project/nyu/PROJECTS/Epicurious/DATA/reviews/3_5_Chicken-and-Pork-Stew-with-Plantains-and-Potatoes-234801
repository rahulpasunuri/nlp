This stew is so delicious! Everybody loved it! I used mostly ripe plantains.

I liked this recipe and the different flavors it brought together. I would advise using slightly more ripened plantains because the green plantains were rather dry. Also I thought that the allspice, while a good addition, was a bit overpowering, so next time I would probably add slightly less than 1/2 teaspoon. Overall, I thought that it was a good recipe and I'll definitely make it again.

Great! Each spoonful is different. I did have trouble with the plantains. It took a long time to peel them and much of the flesh remained in the peel. This was more soup than stew. Eliminated the cilantro and used frozen corn.

I used semi-ripe plantains/skipped the microwave instructions & they came out tender & moist. Also, it seemed odd that there weren't any instructions on how to cut the plantains (since all the other ingredients were in 1-1/2" cubes). Not sure if the recipe intended for them to be placed in the pot whole -- I chose to slice them up instead. Also, the amount of liquid/broth was just right as is. This is a stew, not a soup. We served this accompanied by rice with black eyed peas -- YUM!

I have not made this recipe yet, but it sure sounds like a simplified version of a Dominican stew called sancocho. Do not substitute the plantains or the potatoes, but go ahead and add the yucca, in true sancocho style, the more the merrier (you can add malanga and yams too. You can also a variety of meats). This is supposed to be a very hearty stew. Accompany with rice and avocados. I will definitely try.

This was really good, except that I agree that the plantains were too dry. I'd recommend NOT using green plantains. Let them ripen. Also, 15 oz of broth didn't seem like quite enough liquid, so have extra on hand. It was delicious anyway, though.

so the recipe indicates green plantains. do they get tender in the stew? i'm a big fan of black plantains (big sweet tooth), so i'm a little iffy about how the green ones turn out. GREAT suggestion of subbing yucca for potatoes, gonna do that one.

For dkoury from Atlanta : The platains must cook longer for them to be moist. Here in Colombia we use platains all the time.

Nice taste overall, but the plantains were very dry for some reason (I don't have experience with them). If the plantains were moist, then it would be better.

Great dish! My husband is from Honduras and he said this tasted just like something his mom used to make. I substituted yucca for the potatoes. It came out great. We ate it over rice.

We really liked this dish and I will make again. A good one-pot meal. I followed the recipe exactly
