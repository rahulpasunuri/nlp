Very simple, direct recipe. Not too labor-intensive & somewhat exotic. Is there anything to substitute for quince? Also, would dried lemons work? Lamb was not specified. Would beef work as well?

Maybe the best beef stew I have ever made. But, I went off recipe, used beef shanks instead of stew meat. Cutting the meat from the bones, I then browned the bones first, rendering the fat from marrow and then browning the cut up meat in the marrow instead of in olive oil. The original recipe does not call for browning the meat and I really think this dish would suffer without that step regardless. My version is so delicious that I can't wait to do it again.
