this is a real italian dish. my husband is from northern italy and grew up eating this. gnocchi means dumplings. it's delicious! i have always used the recipe from marcella hazan's book, but it's pretty basic and probably hard to screw up. i use bob's red mill semolina, and it works fine.

I made this using Bob's Red Mill Semolina flour. It did not set properly. I am thinking of making quenelles and either cooking them in boiling water or in butter like gnocchi. Why are they even calling it Gnocchi? Americanized Italian food. Avoid.

Really good, basic flavor to build on. I did it plain, with a great tomato sauce, and tonight with chicken cacciatore over it.
