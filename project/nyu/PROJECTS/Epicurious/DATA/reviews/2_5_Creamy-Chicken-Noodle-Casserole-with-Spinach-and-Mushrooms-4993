It was just awful. The flour/cornstarch overwhelmed the sauce and the tarragon was a terrible idea.

After reading some reviews, agreed that it needed tweaking. I sauteed the chicken with garlic, olive oil and added white wine and chicken stock to finish. Changed the sauce completely by using the sautee juices, cream of mushroom and mozzarella cheese. Used egg noodles instead of fettucini and fresh spinach instead of frozen. Combined everything in a big sauce pan and cooked it on low for a bit before putting it in casserole dish. Added fresh garlic and more mozz on top of casserole before cooking. It came out great!

This is actually great IF you tweak a few things. I read the reviews beforehand, so I knew to change a lot. - Used oregano, thyme, rosemary and a liberal amt of pepper to flavor the sauce instead of the nutmeg. - Used marsala wine instead of white wine just because I didn't have white. I'm sure both are great. - Used penne instead of fettucine, which I like more for casseroles - Added about a Tbsp of butter to the sauce after adding the spinach and chicken After all of those alterations, it was great!

This was probably the worst dinner that I have ever made. Had I read the reviews before I started making it, I would have moved onto another recipe. But I made it without reading the reviews and I have to agree with what everyone else said. It was bland and tasteless, and a waste of time and good ingredients. The only positive was the laughs we got about how bad it really was.

i also tweaked the recipe since all these reviews were letting us know how bland it was. for starters, i bought a costco rotisserie chicken and used that. i also used flavored bread crumbs and added butter to the topping. added way more salt and a little of white wine to the sauce. added a whole other dimension. got positive feedback from guests.

I agree with lots of comments but I made it before reading them. Browned panko crumbs. used porcinis fired in butter and fresh baby spinach. More garlic and one pan to wilt fresh spinach, then the mushrooms in butter and olive oil and then sauce. Used fresh pasta and spices as per recipe. A nice wine pinot gris and mixed all together and cooked per recipe. Light, savory and great with a pinot gris. would make again but probably add shallots and maybe leeks.

After reading the low ratings, I also tweaked it. I cubed the chicken and sauteed it in butter and olive oil with seasalt and fresh ground pepper. I added a shallot and 2 cloves of garlic. It's Sept. and I have a ton of super ripe heirloom tomatoes. I then added 1/2 tsp of fresh rosemary, 1/2 tsp fresh oregano and about the same in fresh basil. I used penne, not only because it's all I had but I thought the tubular pasta would let the gravy flow. Instead of milk I added fresh mozarella over the pasta and gravy. I used panko instead of fresh breadcrumbs only out of convenience. So I rated it 3 forks, because I'm a good cook that had to totally re-arrange this recipe!

Yes, bland. A real cream sauce made with butter (vs. cornstarch) may save this recipe.

At first glance of the title I thought it sounded like it would be good. Spinach, mushrooms. I had some handmade fettucini I used in it. I used a good Sherry instead of wine and even it didn't help it much. When my neighbors sid it wasn't my best wrok...OUCH! Sadly, I knew it. I wish I hadn't wasted my good pasta and sherry on such a dish. Live and learn huh?

This recipe was incredibly bland and the little flavour it did have was not suited to the ingredients. This certainly wasn't a simple casserole. It wasted ingredients and time as far as I am concerned. I would not even think about it!

I took this recipe on as a challange because even before reading the reviews I could see a few changes that needed to be made. I diced the chicken and sauteed it, removed it from the pan, and sauteed the garlic, 1/2 onion, 8 oz sliced mushrooms, 1/2 red pepper. Added 10 oz spinach to wilt and then removed the veggies from the pan. Added 1 cup chicken stock to the pan to absorb the flavors and reserved. I then made a roux of butter and flour in a saucepan, added the milk very slowly to make a sauce, Added the reserved chicken liquid, S&P, thyme, parsley, nutmeg and stirred over med heat until it boiled. I then stirred in the diced chicken and vegetables. I added this all to the cooked fettucine and transfered to the buttered baking dish. I sprinkled the parmesan and fresh made bread crumbs on top and baked about 20 minutes. I tried this recipe first for my fiance (my favorite guinea pig!) and we thought it was pretty good. So I made it for two clients. One said it was good but not the best dish and the other client also gave it mediocre reviews. So I would have to say even with improvements this dish is ok/good but definetly wont be in my personal chef repertoire.

This dish was very bland, and the tarragon is strange, especially if you are not used to it. It is overpowering in this recipe. The spinach fettucine doesn't help, and I couldn't think of a way to make this work.

After reading such a plethora of negative reviews, I was reluctant to try this recipe. But I knew, with some tweaking and a revised cooking method, that these ingredients would result in a tasty dish...and I certainly wasn't disappointed! Instead of poaching the chicken, sprinkle with salt/pepper and quickly saute/brown in a little butter. Remove chicken from pan and shred coarsely. To the same pan, add 1/2 of a large minced onion and saute a few minutes, then add 4 cloves minced garlic and sliced mushrooms and cook until mushroms are softened but liquid has not evaporated. Gently toss mushroom mixture with chicken. To this mixture stir in sliced fresh spinach - frozen spinach is so slimy and unappetizing! Deglaze the pan with white wine, then add 1 cup chicken stock and simmer until liquid is reduced to about 3/4 cup and set aside. Use whole milk to make the sauce, omit the cornstarch and add plenty of fresh ground pepper. Instead of tarragon (it is not my favourite herb) add fresh or dried thyme and do not omit the nutmeg -so very good with mushrooms. Stir the reserved chicken stock/wine mixture into the sauce and heat to bubbling and cook until nicely thickened. Add sauce to chicken/mushroom/spinach mixture, then gently mix in cooked pasta. If a little dry, stir in additional milk or chicken stock to desired consistency. Transfer mixture to buttered baking dish. Brown breadcrumbs, stir in parmesan and sprinkle evenly over top. Bake as directed, remove from oven and immediately sprinkle with more grated parmesan. Then sit back and enjoy a very flavourful casserole! Cheers!

I will start off.... 2 1/2 to 3 forks. It was very good and I will make it again. I caution.. it is a dish that requires Impeccablelly fresh ingredients. Old or stale Tarraggon is revolting. Make sure yours is fresh (I suggest mail order, unless you live in an area where the grocery stores have rapid turnoverer or you have the luxury of small purveyours of fresh ingredients.. ie the Costco 1 lb jar of taraggon won't make it in this recipe) I made the recipe verbatim except I cut it exactly in half and used the fresh equivalent of the frozen spinach. I buy my tarragon in small batches from Penzeys and store it in my freezer, I buy and use fresh organic garlic, and I use inexpensive, but quality wine in my cooking. I buy nutmegs whole and have a small grinder when I need nutmeg. I also cooked the sauce for some time .. I whisked the the first quanity of milk with the flour and cornstarch and cooked over low heat for a good 15 minutes.. I added the rest of the milk and tarragon and cookded for anothe 10 minutes and then added the wine and cooked for another 10 minutes... only then did I get a sauce that both tasted good and looked about the right consistency. The final touch is the Parmesan. The stuff that comes in the green cardboard container is not parmesan.. I am not sure what it is ... but it is not parmesan cheese. Find a good cheese shop and buy a pound... a pound of acceptable Italian parmesan will set you back 14 bucks or more a pound.. but it is sufficiently pungent that it will last you some time.. 1 Tbsp goes a long way. This was yummy if time consuming dish.

This wasn't bad, but it was a bit bland. Needed lots of S&P. I sauteed the mushrooms before adding them. It seemed strange to me to just throw them in raw. After reading the reviews I was afraid to make it, but the ingredients made me think it might still be good. I took a chance. Probably won't do it again.

Good flavors, fairly easy to make. Nice variation form the usual.

This is truly one of the great recipes I have ever made and tasted -- the kind of dish you want to keep secret so you can unleash it at a dinner party and impress guests. The spinach and mushroom are a classic combination, rendered here all the more textured by the unique presence of tarragon and white wine. My wife had six (6) servings, and our child, who almost never takes to spinach, had 3. A rock-solid, can't miss and profoundly tasty recipe.

This recipe was ok.I think i helped it more by cooking the chicken in broth and lawry's seasoning salt.I added more fresh crushed garlic and that gave it some kick.However i used frozen spinich(i dont usually use frozen but they ran out of fresh at the supermarket-i know weird !!) Yech..for the lack of a better term.The frozen did not help at all.i know the fresh would give this dish a better flavor.

This is a low fat winner. Although the flavors are subtle and well-balanced, it seemed a bit too bland. Addition of shallots or beefing up the spices might help.

A labour-intensive dish, but worth the effort. A few changes are necessary to enhance flavours: extra garlic, sprinkle of hot peppers on top before baking, mixing parm cheese with breadcrumbs BEFORE baking, and I would make the roux without cornstarch as it was hard to get it smooth. The tarragon was lovely and shouldn't be omitted. I also used some sour cream when combining all ingredients before baking and served a big scoop of it on the side as garnish, which was a hit. (No dish should ever go ungarnished!) Shallots would have been a nice addition. I added brocolli and onions sauted first and FRESH SPINACH was perfect in this dish -I would make it again, but would allow more time ~ my guests loved it!

Although I'm not a big fan of casseroles, I thought this was a wonderful dish - very savory. I used some lite butter in the sauce, and took the hint to to cook the chicken in broth and use the leftover broth for the sauce. too. My parents loved it - it was a very hearty and satisfying dish after a long day.

I have been preparing this recipe since 1998. It has had great accolades since the first time I made it. I just served it at a high school soccer party and the girls and parents loved it. Unfortunately no leftovers. Perhaps the bad reviews come from people who didn't follow the recipe or are used to high fat foods.

I chose to make this dish for my parents, who are on a low-fat, salt-restricted diet. Even my dad, who's not picky when it comes to food, just pushed it around on his plate. Sensing disaster before I stuck it in the oven, I added sauteed onions and cayenne pepper, but to no avail. It was tasteless and beyond bland, and the leftovers will never see the light of day. I don't know what could improve this dish, and in fact, I don't think anything can. Two thumbs down.

I decided to make this recipe despite the poor reviews because I had all of the ingredients on hand. Here's what I did differently: * Poach the chicken in store-bought chicken stock. * Saute the mushrooms with 1/2 an onion in a little butter. I added the spinach (fresh; about 1/2 bag) at the end so it would wilt slightly. * White sauce: melt 2-3 Tbs butter over low heat; wisk in 2-3 Tbs flour and heat about 4-5 minutes. Stir in 1 c. milk and cook slowly 10 minutes. Then add remaining 1 c. milk (I used 1/2 c. cream and 1/2 c. milk), tarragon, salt, nutmeg, and reserved 1 c. chicken stock. When it boils, add wine. * I used regular fettuccine instead of spinach, cause that's what I had.

Gack. The "white sauce" made with lots of flour and cornstarch had a paste-like consistency (and flavor). The standby casserole recipes with a can of Campbell's soup are tons better than this. I'm sorry I didn't read the other reviews before making this.

Tried this recipe with some trepidation because of the previous comments. But with the help of the constructive comments about boosting flavor, produced a tasty cassarole. First I poached the chicken breasts in homemade chicken broth. Then for the cream sauce I made a roux with chicken fat and the indicated thickeners. For the liquid I used 1 1/2 cups chicken broth and 1 1/2 cups half and half. Didn't shred the chicken, but cut it in bite-sized pieces. The result was a savory dish where you could taste the individual ingredients wrapped in a flavorful sauce. My remaining question is why would you sprinkle on the parmesan after the 10-minute cooling off period? It just sits there.

I love this recipe! Contrary to all of the negative reviews on the site, I've had great success with this dish. The terragon is unsual, but it gives a great flavor.

If you're looking for a quick, but good chicken casserole recipe try this: 1 large can of chunky chicken (like Starkist) 1 6 1/2 oz. can cream of chicken soup-low fat, medium size egg noodles, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, tarragon & parlsey, salt to taste, homemade breadcrumbs and butter. Mix chicken in a large mixing bowl (do not drain chicken)-breaking the chicken into smaller pieces with a spoon, add the cream of chicken soup, plus 1/2 can of water, mix in 1 1/2 cups of the cheddar cheese. Boil 3 cups of the noodles and pour into mixing bowl. Add tarragon or any other spices to taste, I even add a shot of tabasco sauce too. Pour everything into a casserole dish, top with breadcrumbs and dot the top with butter. Bake at 400 or until golden on top and bubbling.

The end result was very disappointing. In my opinion, it was a shameful waste of wonderful chicken, mushrooms and fettucini. There are, indeed, many similar recipes that would provide a more pleasing meal. Eliminate the bay leaf and nutmeg, saute the chicken in the wine or, preferably, sherry with roasted garlic and a dash of tarragon instead of poaching are a couple of thoughts to help add more flavor to this dish. Next time, I'll read the reviews and recommendations first. Sounds like many of us are of the same opinion.

Per suggestions I omitted the tarragon, added more onion, garlic, bay leaves and I've used evaporated milk for a creamier sauce. I have made this dish several times each time trying something different. I've omitted the wine and used different vegetables such as brocoli bits and zucchini. We've loved it everytime and what's even better, our 2-year-old will eat it with us.

Original version very...odd. Recommended changes would inlude heavy cream for the lowfat milk, omit bay leaf and nutmeg - this confuses the flavors, and sauteeing the chicken in olive oil and white wine rather than poaching. These changes make for a very rich and unique taste!!

If you choose to make this (there are far better similar recipes out there) you must really doctor this up. I added a lot of sour creme, garlic and onion, as well as a huge dose of parmesan cheese. After all that it tastes OK, but still inferior. Look further for a different recipe.

This dish was a huge disappointment. I took many of my favourite ingredients and turned them into an tasteless jumbled disaster. The only thing I could taste was the nutmeg which I believe should not have been included to begin with. I will never ever make this again!

I made this for a group of 50 and assembled the casserole a day early. I thought the following changes were helpful (some based on previous suggestions): - Add a healthy amt. of parmesan and sauteed shallots and garlic to the sauce. - Make the white sauce in the traditional way, beginning with a roux (The method in these directions caused serious clumping, perhaps because of the large quantities involved.) - If you're going to assemble and refrigerate overnight, I recommend making extra sauce to stir in before baking.

For lack of a sophisticated word....ICK!!! My family was in the mood for a good casserole and this one didn't do the trick. It was very very DRY and without flavor.

Made this as one of two pasta entrees for friends. I made it ahead and froze it, then baked it 2 days after making - that worked well. Everyone agreed that the tarragon made it taste unusual, and if I make it again I will use a different blend of herbs, and also add parmesan to the sauce as well as sprinkling on top. We actually enjoyed the leftovers reheated more that we enjoyed it at the meal - maybe it just needed more time for flavors to blend.

This is the kind of food my mother made when I was a kid-except hers was pretty bland. I really like the addition of wine and nutmeg in the sauce. And I really love the spinach. I'm sure to make this again since it freezes pretty well and it makes good leftovers when I have to work late.

The blandness comes from using milk instead of heavy cream. For those not health conscious, try cream.Adding another bay leaf also helps.

I found this recipe to be nice comfort-type food, and quite healthful. However, on repeated tastings during preparation, I found it rather bland, so I added about a teaspoon of garlic powder and some red pepper flakes. In the future I might saute some onions and add that to the mix...something to jazz it up a little. Or maybe that's the point, the blandness? Well, I gotta have spice.
