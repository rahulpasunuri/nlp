Really good recipe. I used 1% milk and it turned out fine. I added some marjarom in addition to the thyme and threw in some shredded swiss cheese. I also added bread crumbs with butter as a topping-- but I think it would be great without any of these additions or changes.

Great recipe, and I don't even like turnips! I did tweak the recipe slightly. I replaced the half and half with whole milk, but kept the heavy cream. For the sauce, I started with a roux, added the milk and cream until it thickened up a little. Added the aromatics and spices with a dash of nutmeg, 1/2 cup of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, and a small cube of fontina I had sitting in the fridge. Cooked in a square pyrex dish. I sliced the turnips paper thin so I wouldn't be overwhelmed by them and did a mix of potato and white sweet potato. Delicious!

I was so excited to make this dish after reading all of the great reviews, so I followed it to a t. The only thing I did differently was use a glass dish that was an inch too short. When it was all said and done, it looked like potatoes floating in milk... not what i was expecting at all! i was so disappointed. what did i do wrong!?!?!

What's wrong with a little richness? That's why this gratin was so tasty. The turnips were from my garden, and they add a sweetness to the dish that you just won't get with plain potatoes. I lightened it by using all half and half, and served it at a spring celebration feast with roast lamb, braised salmon on wilted spinach, new peas, cauliflower puree and a mixed green salad. Heart healthy? Probably not, but my family and guests (I fed 16)enjoyed an exceptional meal in wonderful company. The chocolate cake with fresh strawberries and cream was rocking too.

Made this for Christmas dinner yesterday and it was a huge hit. I highly recommend it, paired with prime rib, as we had it. Sure, it's not exactly heart-healthy, but there was more than enough for 12 people to split this as a side dish.

Wonderful! This is one of my families requested side dishes. Easy to make,and just a little diffrent than the usual scollepped potatoes.Even if you don't like turnips I bet you will like this!

This dish was wonderful and wonderfully simple. I cheated and used pre-shredded potatoes to save some time and eliminated the turnips because they didnt look good when I was at the grocery store. It still turned out great. My husband who is not a huge fan of potatoes as side dishes loved this dish and since I am a huge potato fan this dish was an instant hit. We will definitely be making this again.

to the cook from NY answering the cook from Seattle, I couldn't agree more! Thank you for saying it. This dish is fabulous. We've made it many times always to raves. In our family we don't overload our diet with fat, so indulgences like this are ok because they are wholly balanced with veggies in e.v. olive oil, fruit and grains, a mediterranean diet. Eat on happy people!

This got rave reviews at dinner last night. I cut the whipping cream by half and added milk instead. Just before I took it out of the oven, I sprinkled a bit of Romano cheese over it. It looked and tasted great.

Good recipe. Great with ham or other meats. For the Seattle cook: I'm sure you never made this dish, so you shouldn't have rated the recipe. The rating system is for those who have actually made the dish. It is, of course, not heart healthy by today's standards, but there is certainly nothing wrong with people serving cream and half and half if they choose to do so. If a person doesn't want to make the recipe, fine. Just don't rate it.

Down home comfort food and very tasty. A nice variation on scalloped potatoes. I used rutabagas rather than turnips - personal preference. The thyme was a good complement and I also added a few dashes of nutmeg for more depth of flavour. Yes, it is rich as it is meant to be. Considering it serves 8, each serving contains approx. 1/3 cup of cream which really isn't so bad on an occasional basis. At first glance, any cook knows this is calorie/fat laden, but all things in moderation. We can't always eat twigs, pebbles and leaves! If this recipe appeals to you, make it and enjoy this guilty pleasure. Then, skip dessert to ease your conscience. Cheers!

I found this delicious but prefer it paired with a steamed or grilled fish because it is so rich. Also needs a salad on the side with a light and tangy vinaigrette dressing for a better flavor balance.

Read the recipe. Whipping cream AND half&half? Substituted half and half with chicken stock. Used russet potatos, baby turnip and parsnip- all thinly sliced. Topped with swiss cheese and baked. Amazing!!

I made this to share with my scrabble group last week. Everyone loved it. I was surprised at how delicious it was. Very, very easy to make. My son found it too rich for his tastes but I couldn't get enough of it. Yummmmm!!!

Just so you don't think everyone in Seattle is a pooh - I made this for a family reunion and it was adored by all. A grating of fresh nutmeg "kicked it up a notch!"

I made this dish for a recent dinner party. The potatoes and turnips are a great combo. It was a perfect addition to my comfort-food themed menu, and went beautifully with roast chicken and wilted escarole. SO rich, but incredibly yummy. To those who have complained about the healthiness of this dish: Bon Appetit does not purport to be a health food magazine. If you don't like it, don't make it, OR modify it with some milk, instead of ALL the cream.

To the cook in Seattle, it's a gratin. People in Europe have been eating gratins like this for generations, and they are much more "heart healthy" than people in this country. Eating real food, even cream in some of your dishes, and enjoying it, is the most "heart healthy" way to live. Moderation, and a love of food, are healthy than puritanism and a fear of food. Let's have more comments about the food and less priggish nutrition comments, shall we?

I substituted skimmed condensed milk for all that fat cream, and it was excellent!

Two cups whipping cream and one cup half and half makes this a very heart unhealty dish to make. What were you folks thinking?

Friends served this recently - it's delicious. I'm going to try it with rutabagas instead of turnips.

This was a very nice potato dish. I halved the recipe and used only potatoes, as I am not a big turnip fan. Very easy to make, too.
