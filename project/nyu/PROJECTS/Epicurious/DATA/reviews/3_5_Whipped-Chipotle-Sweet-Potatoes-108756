My four forks may not be exactly accurate. Per other cooks suggestions, added a clove of garlic (sauteed with chipotle chiles until fragrant). Added to potatoes. Mixed in the 3 tbs butter and added a couple of scoops of sour cream. The result was amazing. So velvety and delicious, I will definitely be making this one again!

I've made this for Thanksgiving for several years now. I think some people miss the marshmallows and brown sugar yuck that is traditional. It's my favorite thing at dinner. I've even cheated when desperately short of time and used canned sweet potatoes drained and rinsed and it still turns out great. I sometimes add a little milk to thin the mixture prior to baking instead of more butter. I saw the idea in the reviews to add a little lime zest. I might give that a try and see how it turns out. Definitely a keeper! Part of my Thanksgiving tradition.

This is a fantastic side dish. Also very versatile; you don't have to roast the potatoes; you can boil them (as another reviewer mentioned) or even microwave them. Can be served this way, with chives sprinkled over and extra butter or olive oil, or do something REALLY fun and use this as a filling for empanadas or turnovers made with filo or puff pastry dough. Really easy and really delicious! More healthful than russet potatoes, too.

I have homemade canned chipotles that a friend makes and I use in this. It gives the potatoes a delicious smoky flavor. I'm too lazy to do all the roasting the baking, so I just boil the sweet potatoes and add the chipotles, chopped really really fine, mash it all together. It's wonderful.

Amazing texture and zing! Have been making this recipe for years now and guests always love it. Great with roast pork, ribeye and also with chicken. And it's not so overpowering that you can't serve it to an "older" crowd-my octogenarian father and uncle as well as my finicky eating 76yo mother all love this.

As it is, I don't think the recipe is anything to write home about (or take to Thanksgiving dinner), but I think it's the start of something beautiful. I added an entire head of roasted garlic, then baked the dish. Once out of the oven, I added sour cream, which gave it a richer texture and taste. It was a big hit at Thanksgiving!

Puree the whole can of chilis and freeze what you don't use it keeps for a long time. This stuff is powerful I would put in 1/2 the amount and test for heat.

I thought it was ok. Hubby didn't like. Why is this recipe in here twice?

Made this for Thanksgiving. I thought I had a can of Chipotles in adobo but didn't. I substituted chipotle chili powder and added grated lime zest and fresh lime juice. Everyone was quite surprised, as they were expecting the usual sweet flavors, and even the non sweet potato lovers liked it.

this is a flavour combo I love, and I'm now wondering if it could be improved on, with the addition of a roasted head of garlic?

A fabulous way to do sweet potatoes for the holidays. Chipotles in adobo are HOT so add in increments and taste as you go. The mixture of sweet, smoke, and spice is awesome. I've made this dish for years to rave reviews.

Hands down my favorite whipped sweet potato recipe. Make it at Thanksgiving & several times throughout the year. Tonight serving with stuffed flank steak.

The long baking concentrates the flavor and sweetness, and the chipotles add a subtle smokiness as well as spice. This is now my favorite recipe for sweet potatoes.

Boo! Didn't like it. For me, I just didn't dig the flavor profile. Sweet potato-chipotle didn't work.

I think the combination of sweet potatoes and chipotle is inspired! I try to keep sweet potatoes lower calorie, however. I left out the butter and added a banana for sweetness and 2 tbls. of lime juice for balance. I thought this combination was even better.

Mmm mmm MMmm! This was great. The smokiness of the chipotles absolutely works with the sweet potatoes. You need to remove all thoughts of the traditional Thanksgiving-candied-sweet-potatoes as this has nothing to do with that. Every time we took a forkful of this, it was lovely little surprise of flavours, and a great texture. PS, if you like this, try Lime Cilantro Sweet Potatoes on this site for a non-mashed, spicy sweet potato.

This is my new favorite way to enjoy sweet potatoes! A great recipe...I didn't make any changes except to cut it in half because I was making it for just two of us. That was a big mistake, because we didn't have much in the way of leftovers. I'll definitely make this one again!

my boyfriend hated it, but I thought it was good...he didn't like the sweet with the spicy - he thought the flavors competed with each other. I (and I generally don't like sweet potatoes) thought it was good. My advice: if you like sweet potatoes prepared traditionally - i.e. with butter and brown sugar - I don't recommend this recipe. If you have a more adventurous palate, then go ahead and try it!

Very good side dish. Will definately make again. I mashed with a potato masher instead of a mixer and added a little sour cream before baking, I don't know if that makes much difference. I don't know who came up with the idea of making sweet potatos with sugar and marshmallows, because they're awesome prepared spicy.

Made this dish for a small dinner party this weekend and it was absolutely fabulous! The sweetness of the potatoes combined with the smoky spiciness of the chipoltes was fantastic. Will make again and again.

I love this recipe! But know your audience - some of the family found it a bit spicy. On the whole everyone loved it. The next day I turned the leftovers into awesome soup with chicken stock and milk.

Nice variation for mashed potatoes. The flavors blend nicely and make a good additional to many types of meals. I served it with grilled salmon and thought that it was a nice compliment.

Made this for Thanksgiving last year and it was a hit! Have made it again several times and everyone loves it. Great combo of sweetness with a zing of pepper. I use ground chipotle pepper and it turns out great.

I love all of the ingredients in this dish but when the potatoes are whipped they are so smooth that I really found it nausiating. It's just me I know, I have a psychological barrier against anything with the texture of baby food. Maybe if I left the skins in and just mashed it instead I could eat it. As it is I will never make this again.

Easy and great flavor! I used a 1 1/2# potato for 2 people and added 1 tablespoon of the mashed chipotle. It was bordering on too spicy. It went great with Ginger Marinated Pork Tenderloin.

Instead of the butter I added 1/2 cup of low fat sour cream. It made the potatoes creamier and healthier.

I made this with our Christmas turkey and everyone at the table (12) loved it. The smokey chipotle flavor really enhanced the turkey and celery root puree. This will become an annual side dish for our Christmas dinners. Perfect just the way it is.

This is a simple but yet spciy version of an old classic. Although, I added a bit more of butter and a touch of cream.
