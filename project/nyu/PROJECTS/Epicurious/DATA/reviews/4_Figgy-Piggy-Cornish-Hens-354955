Yummy! Only change we made was to pour out most of the fat after browning the hens. The sweet/salty profile was wonderful.

This recipe is good but really nothing special. It certainly doesn't deserve the 'best of epicurious' blue ribbon.

I make this all the time when figs are abundant and use pancetta instead of bacon slices. Excellent and a beautiful presentation.

I brined and left out the salt, as one of the first reviewers suggested, and also went a little heavier on the bacon. This was decent, although it was a little too salty (probably the result of brining + extra bacon + the chicken broth that I used to cook the wild rice that I paired with it). I like salty foods, so it was still fine. Although this was a perfectly edible dish, the flavors just didn't come together the way I wanted them too. I liked all the flavors so I might try to find a similar recipe or modify it myself. Perhaps a fig and bacon stuffing for a whole chicken? I'm not sure what this recipe needs..

This recipe is awesome! the flavor of the fig, beacon and thyme works really well with the chicken. I love cornish hens to begin with, and coupled with the figs and beacon, is just delicious to another level. I would definitely make it again.

Cooking method didn't work for me. Pan drippings got black after 1st set of hens. Then in oven, hens started to burn before time was up, but skin was not crispy. Just dark. Will oven roast next time.

This was wonderful, albeit I made a few changes. Rather than cooking with bacon fat, I just browned the hens in a bit of olive oil before putting them in the oven. To still get the bacon/salt flavor, I crisped up some slices of prosciutto on a cast iron skillet and crumbled them. When it was time to serve, I sprinkled the prosciutto over the hens. I also deglazed the pan with some stock and white wine, and drizzled that over the meat. I served this with gorgonzola polenta and an arugula salad with toasted pecans.

Dissapointed :( I think the recipe has potential, but it just did not come together. I think the figs sholud be made into a sauce without it being scattered everywhere and I agree with some of the other reviewers that the bacon can be left out.

Delicious, but very very rich. Would leave the bacon grease out of the gravy/sauce next time, sub in some homemade chicken stock and perhaps a pat of butter. Very good though.

A huge hit with my boyfriend. Cornish hens were a little tough to find, but Whole Foods came through.

Wow! This recipe was not only delicious but easy, too. Aside from halving the recipe, I only made 2 changes - one by accident, the other on purpose. Oops, I forgot to salt and pepper the hens before cooking. No matter, really, as the bacon is plenty salty on it's own. The other change was that I decided to omit the bacon fat/brown bits/lemon juice "sauce" altogether. The hens were perfectly juicy on their own and I felt that with everything being cooked in bacon fat to begin with, I just didn't need it. Unlike many "fast" recipes that say they take 20 minutes but really take an hour or more to make, this one really gets done in the 45 minute time frame stated. I even had time to make a separate meal for my 2 yr old while the hens were in the oven (sadly, she refuses to eat meat of any kind). What an impressive, weekend-worthy meal that can be made on a weeknight! When I brought the dish to the table, my husband was stunned. And, I was stunned to see his plate practically licked clean at the end of the meal! I will certainly be making this again very soon (before figs go out of season) because I don't want to have to wait til next year to try it again!

I brined the hens (as recommended below) and fell in love with the incredible flavor. This is a great,straigtforward method of cooking cornish hens and I will definitly make it again. I served it atop creamy polenta and accompanied with cider roasted butternut squash and a simple green salad. Big hit!

Worth the extra effort (not that it's much extra effort) to elevate roast chicken to a sublime Sunday supper. The figs are key! And the crispy garlic chips -- normally I wouldn't bother, but it's easy and so good!

This was good, but not phenomenal. If I were to do something like this again, I'd go with the Roast Chicken with Rosemary-Garlic Paste recipe (also on this site).

This was a perfect recipe for a quick, yet elegant dinner. My husband raved. I will definitely make this again before autumn is over, we have loads of figs on our trees.

This is such a simple recipe, but it packs a whole lot of flavor. It's a great way to use seasonal figs in a savory way. We licked our plates clean! Visit http://joleneeatshere.blogspot.com for pics and details.

Easy, delicious and open to purposeful or accidental substitutions. I had a bunch of free figs, and wanted to keep the meal cheap so used chicken thighs.

My son-in-law actually took a picture of this before I took it to the table! AND it tastes even better than it looks. Because I was pulling dinner together kinda quickly I used two whole chickens that I had, cut into smaller serving pieces, oh I did it on the grill in a large foil pan because it was too hot to cook inside! Other than that I followed exactly. The leftovers made fabulous sandwiches the next day. Quite yummy!

A real nice way to do C. Hens. I have also added Cranberry along with the Fig and as another reviewer said it really hits with the bacon.

As soon as I saw this recipe in the most recent issue of Gourmet I knew I had to make it. I was just hoping that Whole Foods had fresh figs in...and they did! The roasted meat with the sweet figs and salty bacon were an excellent combination. I paired this with a peppery arugula and blue cheese salad to complement these flavors. I will definitely duplicate for company. I did make three modifications that I think definitely enhanced the flavor. 1.) Before preparing to roast, I brined the hens for 1 hour in a solution of 2 quarts water-1/4 cup salt-1/4 cup sugar. I then patted them dry and proceeded with the recipe. If you do this then forego the salt in the recipe. 2.) As another reviewer noted, scattering the thyme and garlic on top does not lend enough flavor. So, using half of the garlic and thyme and a pinch of salt I made a paste with a mortar and pestle. I then separated the skin from the meat at the neck of the hen and then made a tunnel from the breast to the mid leg, using my finger to loosen the skin as I went. I then pushed the paste into the space I had made, rubbing the garlic and herbs against the meat. You can then scatter the remaining thyme and garlic on top of the roast hens for visual impact. 3.) I found the pan juices after deglazing to be too oily/greasy. I would skip this step or use a fat separator to remove some of the bacon and chicken fat before drizzling over the birds. Or, if you still want the lemon flavor, simply squeeze a bit of lemon over the top just before serving. YUM!

Before preparing to roast, I brined the hens for 1 hour in a solution of 2 quarts water-1/4 cup salt-1/4 cup sugar. This makes the meat tender and uniformly seasoned. If you do this then do not add salt to the hens. 2. With half of the garlic and thyme I made a paste in a mortar and pestle. I then separated the skin from the meat at the top of the neck and then proceeded to make a tunnel from the breast to the mid thigh, loosening the skin with my finger. I then pushed the paste through the tunnel and rubbed against the skin of the hen. This adds more flavor while the rest of the garlic/thyme can be tossed on top for visual presentation. 3. I found the pan juices too greasy/oily, so I didn't use. Maybe next time I will use a fat separator.

This was awesome! Make sure to buy super ripe figs, the sweetness matches the salty crunch of the bacon. We found that pouring the grease over the roasted hens/chicken diminished the crispiness, we will skip that step next time. Also the thyme didn't come across very well so next time we'll put it under the meat. Otherwise this was great, and we'll make it again. an excellent use of figs and bacon!

Made this last night for two and it was fabulous! Quick and easy. Sophisticated and perfect for a dinner party. I added a handful of parboiled tiny potatoes to the roasting pan and they made a perfect accompaniment and since it was only for the two of us, I used the frying pan to roast the hens.
