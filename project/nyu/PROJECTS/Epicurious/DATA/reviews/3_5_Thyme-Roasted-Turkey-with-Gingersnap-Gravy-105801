We made this for our first-time ever Thanksgiving and it was great. The gravy was surprising to the guests and tasted wonderful. Cooking time has to be increased, but no real problems.

I actually made this turkey (minus the gravy) for both Thanksgiving and Christmas (different diners for each occasion). I brined the turkey beforehand. I also inserted cloves of garlic under the skin after the thyme/butter rub. We stuffed the inside with onion, celary, apple, garlic, thyme and sage and added a cup of white whine to the basting broth. We also layered slices of bacon over the top until the last 1/2 hr of roasting. It flavored the entire turkey beautifully and made for an very tender bird.

Wonderful gravy and lots of it! Moist turkey! A keeper!

I made the gingersnap gravy in this recipe with the brown-sugar cured turkey from Nov. 1997. The two flavors worked together very well and the gravy was wonderful - no flour, not thick, just very flavorful and great with the pan drippings. I used turkey stock from Williams Sonoma instead of the chicken broth, which also gave it a great flavor.

This was a big hit with both family and guests. The turkey was moist and nicely flavoured. The gravy was a pleasant surprise to me. I had my doubts when I read the ingredients but it was delicious. I'm going to make it again for Christmas dinner.

So moist! Guests called me the next day as they were eating leftovers to find out how I kept it so moist. The butter under the skin is key. I didn't put the stock in the bottom of the pan. I find it slows the cooking the bottom of the bird. Very tasty gravy.

Wonderful!!! The gravy has a great kick to it. My family loved it. I wish there was more gravy for leftovers!!! If you like spice, this is it!

The turkey and gravy had a really nice flavor out of the oven. However, the gravy did not get thick at all, and the dish did not taste very good leftover. I might make it as a twist on the usual roast turkey (with modifications to the gravy), but I wouldn't serve it on Thanksgiving.
