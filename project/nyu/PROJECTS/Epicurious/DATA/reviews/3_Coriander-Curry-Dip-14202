I thought this dip was just OK. Nothing to write home about. I think sour cream and soup mix is just as good and a lot less work.

Obsolutely amazing..best dip ever made or tasted! Good without the cilantro but so much better with. 3 hours of rest was enough the first time but second time I made it was liquid. Made a day ahead to be sure.
