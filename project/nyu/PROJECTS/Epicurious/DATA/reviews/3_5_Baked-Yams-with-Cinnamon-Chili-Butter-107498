Fantastic butter - on the yams or anything else. I used Smart Balance (healthy "butter"), which didn't taste like a compromise to butter with the robust flavors in this recipe. I also used regular old chile powder and the flavors were great. Yum!

Yum! A really easy recipe for a weeknight. I first made these to go with a Cajun-crusted salmon, and it was perfect. We now have the same meal about once a month.

I thought it to be differnt and very good. I will fix this again, great as a side dish. For those of you who would like more sweetes try puting some marshmallows on top (I did this 2nd day) and micowave dish. Good this way also.

This was okay: not bad, but not great. I thought the cinnamon was a little overbearing and the dish entirely too bland. For a better yam dish try the roasted root vegetables recipe on this site.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. This is a great alternative to the sickening sweet versions we so often find on holiday tables. I am thinking of other palces to use this butter.

What a nice change of pace for yams/sweet potatoes. Served them with roasted chicken and some lovely, fresh asparagus. Try this one.
