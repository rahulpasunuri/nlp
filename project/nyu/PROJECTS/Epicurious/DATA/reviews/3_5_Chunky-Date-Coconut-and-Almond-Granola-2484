Wow this came out great. I did exclude the dates and subbed chopped walnuts for the cashews. Also I only stirred once at the halfway point and it came out nice and chunky. This is a keeper.

Never tried making granola before--had some dates that needed to be used so decided to try it. Delicious! Left out the cashews (didn't have any) and followed the cooking instructions exactly.

YUM!!! This is perfect in yogurt with honey!

Absolutely delicious. Adding cranberries is a great idea, and I solved the problem of the fruit getting too hard by adding it at the very end (really just before taking it out)--it doesn't really need to cook anyway. Sesame seeds also give it a delicious nutty flavor, but can cook very fast. I stirred the mixture A LOT to prevent it from burning.

We have used this recipe for about 2 years. It's great. We add a little salt and vanilla and sometimes vary it by substituting dried cranberries for the dates. We have even given it as Christmas gifts!

Oh, yes, very tasty. I didn't have any trouble with the dates getting too hard...but my oven runs a little hot, so I just put the granola in for another five minutes upon adding the dates after the initial 20 minutes. So maybe just shortening the time a little will help, leaving them in just long enough for everything to get nice and brown.

Excellent recipe. This is my first attempt, and I only changed two things; I used maple syrup instead of the honey, and added a drop of vanilla. I will never buy from the store again.

This was my first successful attempt at granola. Usually it gets too dark. This one is delicious but the dates got so hard you could not eat them. Any ideas what went wrong? I followed the directions exactly.

My first time making granola. FYI, it comes out quite soft but hardens upon cooling. I recommend chopping the dates into smaller pieces, about the size of the cashews and almonds. The suggestion below to replace some of the almonds with pecans seems like a good idea and I may try replacing some of the dates with raisins as well.

I was pleased to find this granola recipe which is easy to make and much better than grocery store granola. I have made it quite a few times and modified it as follows: cut the honey and brown sugar in half, skip the dates and add raisins before eating, and replace some of the almonds with pecans. This is a great granola for over ice cream or yoghurt.

Wonderful recipe! I've made this in double batches and given as part of a hostess gift when invited to brunch.
