We had this for Chinese New Year dinner. Wonderful. You do have to cook the ribs longer to get falling off the bone done. I used baby backs and cooked at 400 for 1 1/2 hours covered in foil. I cooked ahead and left on the counter until we were ready for dinner a few hours later. Coated with the extra sauce and put them on the grill for 5 minutes a side to reheat and crisp. The sauce is great as is.

Excellent recipe!!!! I didn't have any ribs, so I opened a bag of potato chips. I didn't have any ginger or garlic and I really didn't feel like making the sauce so I opened a jar of peanut butter and got a spoon. Watched the Broncos game and finished off the entire bag and jar! Would definitely try again. All you haters who gave this a one fork, try my variations.

I agree with the Riverdale, NY review. Rib meat should fall off of the bone. Short cuts are too good to be true. Plus the flavor was harsh, and not well blended. Our family was disappointed and would not make this recipe again. We didn't even keep the leftovers!

We made this recipe to the T. If cooking delicious ribs in under 40 minutes seems to good to be true, it is. The ribs were not fall off the bone tender the way ribs should be. The sauce's flavor is overly dominated by the Hoisin sauce. If you want Chinese ribs, find a recipe that has many more ingredients surrounding the Housin sauce.

Delicious ribs in record time and no advance fuss! I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

This receipe is definitely a keeper. Not being a fan of bbq sauce this had all the flavours that we love. The kids (9 and 10) really enjoyed it too. We really liked that it cooked quickly. We followed the recipe; they definitely didn't need the extra cooking time that some of the other reviewers suggest.

Put them in the oven covered on 350 for 2 hours and 45 mins. Took off the foil, covered them in the sauce for the last 15 and they are juicy, tender, meat falling off the bone, bursting with amazing flavor.

These are simply delicious! I made these last summer for 15 firefighters. It was a simple recipe to prepare and the results were drool-worthy. Also, prepared these for dinner for my family tonight and even my daughter's (5, 7, 9) enjoyed them.

We tried this last night & were disappointed. We did use rib tips rather than baby backs. In light of comments here we tried slow cooking & 1 hour at 300 & 1 hour at 200 over-cooked our ribs, drying them out. I would try this again, staying closer to the recipe, but my husband wasn't keen on the flavour of the sauce (the hoisin), so likely we won't try it again.

Amazing sauce. I'm not crazy about bbq sauce, so I really enjoyed these ribs. They tasted really great, but were a little tough and definitely not "fall of the bone." Although I had to cut the broiling time short because some sauce had pooled on the pan and ended up catching on fire.

Super, I did take the advice of another reviewer and slow cooked the ribs in the oven at 350 for about 3 hours, they fell off the bone and the sauce was fantastic!!!

Very good recipe. I cut the ribs into individual pieces and placed them close to one another so I could baste the sides as well as top & bottom. I also put some salt and pepper on the ribs & used my usual method for cooking ribs in the oven: I didn't baste them until they'd been cooking about 20 min (was afraid sauce would burn). Then basted twice while cooking and one more time before putting under broiler. For all who like to try different baby back rib recipes, please try this one, from the Silver Palate cookbook, page 14: 1/2 C. Dijon mustard, 1 tsp. ground mustard, 1/2 C honey, 1/3 C. packed light brown sugar, 1/3 C. cider vinegar, 1 T. sesame oil, 1 T. soy sauce. Whisk together mustards in small saucepan. Whisk in other ingredients and heat over low heat for about 10 minutes or until flavors blend. Salt & pepper the ribs and cook in 400 degree oven for 1 hour, basting at 10 minute intervals after the ribs have cooked 30 minutes. (Before basting, reserve some of the basting sauce to serve at the table.) I give this recipe to all my friends and they get addicted quickly. Typical quote: "After my husband finished the ribs, he picked up his plate and licked it." Also, another great and quick way to cook ribs is to use the method above (i.e., don't baste until halfway through) and buy a jar of Bone Sucking Sauce (regular or hot). It is sold at Whole Foods & many farmers' markets around this area (MD). The flavor of the sauce marries perfectly with pork.

Yuck. A total overdose of ginger. I used half the amount recommended and it was still way too much. the meat was tender enough, but no one would eat it.

Rating: 0
The first time, I followed the recipe and the flavor was good but the meat wasn't tender and falling off the bone. On my second attempt, I used a crockpot. Only used one rack of ribs for the recipe of sauce and cooked on low for several hours. They were exceptional, meat was tender, sauce was great. Very easy.

Fantastic! Boiling takes a lot of flavor out of the meat. For ultimately tender ribs (needs time but no fuss): Precut the ribs and put them in a casserole dish. They don't have to be in a single layer. Pour the marinade on top and turned the ribs to coat. Cover tightly with aluminum foil and cook at 350F for 3 hours. They are great as is - or for a crunchier coating - after baking, broil the ribs in a single layer on a rack over a roasting pan or cookie sheet with a layer of water for just a few minutes. You can do the baking part ahead of time. Bring the ribs out a couple hours before you serve them and stick them in the broiler at the last minute!

I've made this several times, mostly because the marinade is terrific. However, I didn't care for broiling the ribs. The other few times I've made it since, I tossed it in the slow cooker . . . that was vastly preferable, as it got the ribs to that delicious, melting-off-the-bones point.

This recipe was excellent. I always boil my ribs first to make them extra tender and they came right off the bone. I served these ribs with Wasabi mashed potatoes and they went so well together. I am making it again tonight!

The glaze on these ribs is incredibly delicious. I agree with the other reviewers on tenderness though; with a 1hr cook time, the ribs were tender, but not quite as tender as a (s)low cook. However, they look and taste quite good as prepared in the recipe.

The marinade for this is quite delicious. As a Southern chick, I was quite skeptical that ribs would be properly cooked in under an hour. Much as I would love for that to be true, it isn't. The ribs were good, and tender, but not falling-off-the-bone-tender, as a proper rib should be. I'll definitely make the marinade again... but cook the ribs in a more classic style- low & slow, baby.

Excellent! I used the same ingredients and did it as a slow-cooker recipe. My whole family loved it even my son who is picky. The only change I would make is to add less ginger and a bit more garlic. It's a keeper recipe!

We were a little skeptical, but these ribs came out very tender and flavorful. Took the racks over to a party and watched them disappear in a matter of minutes. We'll definitely make it again!

excellent recipe, I didn't have time to use the ingredients so I just use regular bbq sauce and it came out very good

Couldn't believe how moist and tender these were so quickly (and so easy!). Will definately use this technique again - maybe even try w/a different sauce.

Good and simple recipe. I marinated the ribs in the marinade after baking. and then finished them under the broiler.

I used this recipe for a New Year's Day dinner. Everyone, adults and children LOVED them. I cook baby back ribs often- usually marinating them overnight and smoking them for hours. I discovered with this recipe that it's not necessary to do all of that to serve incredibly delicious ribs. It's only my husband and I for dinner tonight- anyone want to guess what I'm cooking?

Ick! Meat came out tough and had no flavor other than the Hoisin sauce. No magic here.

I was skeptical about this recipe but I was craving ribs so I tried it last night. My husband and 3 year old could not get enough of this! I will make this again and again and again.

I can hardly wait to thaw and reheat the leftovers! I'll be surprised if this is not one of those recipes that taste even better later. One word of caution: Don't be skimpy with the aluminum foil; i.e., make sure the sauce can't run underneath or the pan will require a good soaking. I followed the recipe exactly, and suspect that the final browning plays an important role.

This was delicious. I made it exactly as written, and it turned out perfectly. I gave it four stars because it's not only good, it's fast and easy.
