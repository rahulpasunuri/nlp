This is really, really good. I doubled the recipe, but only used 4.5 cups brown sugar to make it less sweet. I also used candied ginger and some bourbon in the liquid during the pear softening phase. I used cinnamon, along with the nutmeg, and I added some almond extract and some vanilla balsamic vinegar to it after putting it through the food mill.

I added crystallized ginger as some of the other reviewers suggested, and wished the finished product had a more pronounced ginger flavor. As it is, this recipe is cloyingly sweet. I gave it as gifts, but the leftover 1/2 cup in my fridge will likely stay there until I throw it out. Will continue to look for a good pear butter recipe.

I am just going to comment, not rate, because I used apples. I thought it came out very nicely, although I was expecting and would have liked more of a caramel flavor. I used a stick blender in the pot rather to 'puree'. If I was going to rate, I think I would give it 3 forks - but 4 if I had not been looking forward to a caramel flavor

Mercy! What a fabulous recipe! I combined a couple of previous tips and mashed the pears rather well with a potato masher and added 1/3 c. finely chopped crystalized ginger and then cooked down. I served it over the Cinnamon Oatmeal Pancakes on this site which I had made with diced fresh pears. Very yummie!

Addictive!!! Made this first time with small hard pears from my sisters yard. I added a little cinnamon too. I couldn't believe it when my boys ate every bit that I made. I am now making some with bartlets to send to my son who is now away at college.

Used a potato masher instead of a food mill as I prefer more of a chunky than a smooth butter. Bartlett were good; I will experiment with different types of pears next Fall.

Excellent! I have made it twice already. I add 1/4 cup of chopped crystallized ginger.

This was very easy to make - I used the small sickle pears and did not peel or core , but simply washed the pears and cut into quarters - cooked as directed and processed through the food mill - after adding the remaining ingredients and bringing to a boil stirring until the sugar had dissolved. I then put the pear butter in a pyrex baking dish and into a 350 degree oven. I stirred every 1/2 hour until the pear butter thickened to the right consistency - easier than stirring every 5 minutes and no threat of scorching.

This was fairly easy to make. The only change I would recommend is to up the amount of nutmeg and/or add some cinnamon to add a greater depth of flavor. The pear flavor is concentrated and the nutmeg seemed to almost get overwhelmed.
