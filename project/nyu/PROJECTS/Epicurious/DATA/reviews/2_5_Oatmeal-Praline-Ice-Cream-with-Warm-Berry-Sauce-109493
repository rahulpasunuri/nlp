Yuck. The "oatmeal prailine" stuff is unpleasantly harsh. The toasted oatmeal tastes like candy coated cardboard.

I made this for a recent dinner party (used the quick and easy version) and it was a big hit. I mixed all the praline into the ice cream and did not reserve any for topping. Like the other reviewer, I also felt the praline was too hard on the palate when it was not softened by the ice cream. The gin added an interesting flavor to the sauce. I could not get the sauce to thicken, so I added 1/4 cup sugar and cooked it about 15 minutes. It thickened up nicely.

The oatmeal praline was a bit harsh on the palate and nobody really cared about it. Most of it was dicarded in the plates. The rest of the recipe produced a nice dessert though... Will make again with a more classical nut praline...
