I've been using this recipe for some time now and still get raves over it. Quick, easy and delish!

I have used this recipe as a base for my "three chile salsa" that I love and so does my family and friends. I add roasted anaheim peppers. I use the dried guajillo chiles and chop them up fine in a small food processor. Also, I am generous with the adobo sauce (love it). Great stuff.

This is a good, basic, non-tomato salsa that is great to flavor meat or use as a "taco sauce".

I made this salsa/ pepper sauce with the pastor tacos recipe in the same issue.... the combination was delicious! Possibly better yet was the next morning when I drizzled it over top of my omelet. This is a must have for just about anything Mexican.
