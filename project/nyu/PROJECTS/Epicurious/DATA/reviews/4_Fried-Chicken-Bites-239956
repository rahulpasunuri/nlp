I marinated these for about 4 hours and they were very tasty. I added chipotle powder to the flour mixture. Served them with a huge salad for dinner. Thought they were a little like grown up chicken nuggets and much better than chicken wings. There was chicken wing sauce on the table but we didn't use it. Not necessary.

Definitely marinate for at least 8 hours and it will come out tasty. Tried the recommended time and there was no flavor. Paired with coconut rice and received many complements.

These were fairly tasty, but isn't most fried chicken? While they smelled great frying, were bland on the table. I think it's worth trying again, will marinate them longer next time.

I made these for friends and they were really good BUT they need the hot sauce. Next time I will add a little cayenne to the flour mixture. I didn't use all the oil called for to deep fry but more of a high-heat saute.

I have made these a couple of times in the deep fryer-OMG! I used a little bit of boneless skinless breast and served as main meal.

Wow, these turned out great. Did a trial run last night for a party we are having next weekend. I did not have dark rum so I used regular light rum and substituted the sugar with dark brown sugar, worked perfectly. Add a couple of teaspoons of baking powder to the flour coating mixture, they turn out even crispier.

A few nights ago, I was craving fried chicken -- not the traditional Southern fried chicken I grew up eating -- but something different. Luckily I had all the ingredients on hand -- I only had to substitute lemon for the lime. I would have never thought of marinating chicken in rum but it was a nice change of pace.

Delicious. An ideal way to enjoy the taste of fried chicken without the hassle.

these are so good. really crispy and i didn't think they were bland at all. i didn't follow the recipe exactly because i had no rum. so i used lime, soy sauce, red wine vinegar and some spices. i marinated a little longer than 25 minutes. will make again. delicious!

I doubled the recipe - served it as one of the canapes at my daughter's wedding - rave - rave reviews from all including the professional caterer! Am taking it to a Pirate party Saturday! - don't change a thing!

Mine just tasted like paprika, which is okay I guess if you really like paprika. Didn't even taste like chicken. I think you could really make some changes to the marinade (longer? less soy?) and the flavor would be better, but as it is written this was pretty bad.

I thought these were just okay...mine did not have much flavour and depended on a good dipping sauce. If I do them again I will spice up the flour mixture or maybe put some tobassco in with the marinade.

Sorry Survivorelle didn't like the recipe. I've made this several times with ease and lots of flavor. Make sure to marinade the meat 30 minutes or longer; this is important, as is using a darker (and good quality) rum.

This was quick and easy. No left overs! I used chicken tenders and a deep fryer. Also used more paprika.

These are really good and simple. I didn't measure the ingredients, and used lemon juice instead of lime because I had it on hand. Still easy and great.

Delicious! Easy to make and a big hit, even my German in-laws. We had it as an entree with 4 side vegetables, which was completely satisfying, but it would also be perfect party food.

After reading all the reviews, I couldn't wait to try this recipe for a party. Luckily, I did a little taste test on my family first, and let's just say it will not be in my recipe box. I found the marinade did not add much flavour to the chicken, and the flour did not adhere equally to the chicken pieces and just made for one big mess. Maybe will try substituting with gorilla hands next time ;)

These lil morsels are fantastic!!! Something perfect for parties with a lovely, sort of tropical flavoring.

Gee, I'd love to haveMombasaJoe cater my next party. I had to make these from bonless chicken thighs, but they were deelish.

My son and son-in-law went nuts over these. The only thing I did differently is marinate the chicken for about an hour instead of the 25 minutes suggested. We served with hot sauce and cubed pepper jack cheese. Next time I'll need to double the recipe to satisfy everyone who couldn't get enough of them!

EXCELLENT!! A slight spiceness with distinct taste of the Captain Morgan's rum. Used sweet and Sour Sauce. Great!!

Love the taste the marinade imparts to the chicken. The chicken bites would be great added to fried rice.

I was served these last night at a dinner party and could barely keep myself from eating them all! Excellent and easy to make. I highly recommend this

My husband and I loved these. The marinade gives the chicken a nice flavor. Easy to do and great as an appetizer or main dish.
