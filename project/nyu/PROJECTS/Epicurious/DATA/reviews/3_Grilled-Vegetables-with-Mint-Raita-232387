I leave out the zucchini and add mushrooms. To the 2 c. of yogurt I add 2 t. dried mint, 1 medium cucumber, peeled and diced,1 small garlic clove minced, 1/8 t. ground cumin, 1/2 t. salt, and 1/4 t. pepper. I make this often and we think it has a wonderful flavor. We buy the Indian bread that is similar to a tortilla, warm and roll the vegetables in it. We like various kinds of chutney on the veggie wraps. We like the mint raita on pappadams.

The veggies were great grilled I added mushrooms to the scewers. I wasn't too impressed with the raita (I have never made it) Started out as written but, I kept futzing with it because it just didn't taste right wished I hadn't added the Masla tasted odd. Wish I had just added cumin which sounds much better. The proportions of mint to yohgurt didn't seem to work (not enough mint)... I ran out of fresh mint so added some dried i had on hand...better...still blah... then out of frustration added some dried dill which I'm sure an Indian food no-no. BUT it was better I also added some fresh lemon juice which seemed to "brighten" the flavor a bit. I think I need a better raita recipe.

I love both Indian food and lamb, and served this recipe along side the Grilled Tandoori Lamb -- it was superb!!! My 6 sisters (my guinea pigs!) raved about it and have insisted on receiving the recipe. I substitued the leg of lamb with lamb chops and they were incredible. The suggestion of using Chat Masala instead of Garam Masala was a wise one, which is what I did. I will definitely make this again!

The grilled vegetables were very nice. Do throw a few portabellas on the skewers too, and use various coloured peppers for a lovely looking dish. I made another raita recipe (since I had no mint), with cucumbers and seasoned with garam masala(made at home).

MAKE THIS TOGETHER WITH "GRILLED TANDOORI LAMB" AS SUGGESTED IN THE MAGAZINE. VERY, VERY GOOD. BE SURE TO MAKE EXTRA VEGIES. THEY WERE SO GOOD EVERYONE WANTED MORE. WON'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

This can be a good vegetarian dish for the BBQ. I would not recommend using Garam masala in the Raita though. It just doesn't not go with it. Traditionally a Raita is flavoured with cayenne to taste and roasted cumin powder. If you want more pep, use Chaat Masala instead of Garam Masala. It is available in most ethnic Indian stores and some supermarkets. 'MDH' is a good brand to buy.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. Takes minutes and was flavorful. We used the yogurt dip and leftover grilled vegetables the next day in grilled chicken sandwiches.
