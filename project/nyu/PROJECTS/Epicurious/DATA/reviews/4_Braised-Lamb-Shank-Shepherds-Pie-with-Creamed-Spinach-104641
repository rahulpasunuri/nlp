I made this for Christmas Eve dinner for 6. I made and assembled it the day before, having read all the reviews. It took a good 6 hours to make, but the smells were delicious and it came together beautifully. I cooked it the following day, before serving. I made it exactly per the recipe, except I threw the carrots in with the braising broth, and I simmered some fresh rosemary with the milk for the potatoes. The final result was delicious, yes. However - it was simply not worth the time. I cook a lot and don't mind putting in a full day (or two or three) for good food, but the return-on-investment must be there. In this case, the dish was delicious but I have made many things that were equally delicious in half the time. There was nothing wrong with the finished product and it got rave reviews, but I won't be making it again.

I made this yesterday for last night in strict compliance with the recipe. This was before I read the reviews. The dish is fabulous, an opinion supported by my wife and our guests. Yet, I agree with several of the reviewers: add garlic; lower temp somewhat ( I wound up with barely a cup of broth instead of the 2.5 promised in the recipe and had to add stock, which was OK because the flavor remained even if the liquid had boiled off); at least, braise the lamb the day before or, better, prepare the entire dish the day before. It is labor intensive and time consuming. Overall, the dish is as good as anything like it I have ever eaten, and I say that after working for five hours on it and you know how that kind of effort can sap one's appetite for a meal.

OMG, this is the best thing I ever made. It is heavenly. it took me 4 1/2 hours and the only modification was to add garlic to broth mixture, and add garlic and red pepper flakes to spinach. like other braising dishes, it's better next day. Totally worth the time it takes to make it.

Intrigued by the reviews, I made this for a pot luck yesterday. It certainly was delicious, and leftovers for lunch today were even better. However, the preparation time is too long, and I used almost every pan, bowl, colander, and utensil in the kitchen. It took almost as long to do the dishes as it did to make the dish. Thus three stars instead of four.

I have made this several times, and it's worth the effort! I have done some time-saving tricks like roasting the carrots on top the lamb and then slicing them when done. I also have made it with just sauteed spinach instead of creamed. And sometimes, I just make the lamb shanks by themselves, which is also fantastic!

If there were five forks this one deserves the rating. Do spred the work into two days otherwise you may be too tired to enjoy how incredibly delicious this is.

Rating: 4
As everyone has said, this is definitely a lot of work but we spread it over two days (braising the lamb on day 1, all else on day 2). It was absolutely wonderful - the flavors are perfect together, the lamb really stands out. A few things that we changed/had to change: My store didn't have shanks, so I used a 4 pound boneless leg of lamb. I made mashed on the stovetop and added some garlic and rosemary/thyme to warm milk to add some flavor to the potatoes. Would add more carrots next time.

Rating: 4
As the prior reviewer said, it is a lot of work but I've added it to my winter standards. It is utterly delicious and makes all other shepherd's pies that I previously loved seem inferior. It's even better the next day. In fact, I'm feasting on the leftovers now and just had to write so people will give this a try. Just make sure you have a day to make it, you'll be glad you did.

A lot of work, but SO TOTALLY WORTH IT! The best lamb pie I've ever tasted.

Rating: 4
I am reviewing this recipe again because now that I have mastered it, the pots don't seem to be that much of a problem. What I have come to appreciate is the ease of doing this for company ahead of time; it also gains flavor that way. Furthermore, it tastes great without garlic, which some of my guests can't eat, and there is no butter or cream in the mashed potatoes, a plus for the calorie counters. My previous comments about the temperature being too high in the beginning still stand, however, and I would definitely increase the mashed potatoes.

Rating: 4
This truly was exceptional! I kind of expected to be bombarded by all the big flavors, but the elements come together in the most unexpectedly subtle way. The portions were not entirely to my preference (I ended up with a proportion of 2:1 carrots to creamed spinach and I would have preferred it to be the other way around) so I ended up just making one heaping quiche-dish-worth and saving the extra lamb/gravy for another time. Not the worst outcome! It did take most of the day, but if you the time investment doesn't bother you the end result is definitely worth it. One note: My supermarket was out of shanks, so I ended up buying one big 5-pound leg shank instead. It worked out fine, but if you go this route know that it will take a lot longer than the recipe indicates to get the lamb nice and tender. You can't really overcook it though - I just kept testing it until the lamb was basically falling off the bone. Delicious! I served it with a simple cucumber/tomato salad that complemented it well.

Rating: 4
This recipe is worked very well. It is excellent on a cold winter day. I used bone-in lamb stew meat (not easy to debone but worth it for added richness), and instead of creamed spinach, I layered fresh baby spinach between the meat and the potatoes. As a side note, I simultaneously made a chicken version (I know, that's not shepherd's pie) for my mother who doesn't eat red meat. Boiled chicken thighs and breasts. Also yummy.

Fantastic! Have made this several times as written but today will just roux leftover beef tenderloin/veg soup, top with leftover garlic mashed potatoes, fresh creamed spinach. Won't have to start at 9AM. Looks nice in an 8 quart oval Creuset - no drips!

I have made this delicious dish since seeing it on a Food TV show. It is an absolute must to make at least two or three times over the winter months. I have even made it when entertaining and everyone loved it. If you cook more lamb shanks you can prepare a wonderful Scotch Broth for even more enjoyable meals. Bev

Rating: 4
To clarify, I used about 2 pounds of stew meat since shanks have so much bone and connective tissue, and it came out about right. Maybe a tad shy, but it was fine.

Rating: 0
Wow, this is a far cry from my aunt's ground beef, frozen veggies and instant mash! The only way in which I modified this recipe was that I used boneless lamb stew meat because I wasn't in the mood to clean up the bony shank mess (next time I'll try it as written), and I cut the cooking time of the lamb by half. Fabulous!!

Best shepherd's pie ever! If you double your Easter dinner leg of lamb, mashed potatoes and gravy, an afternoon's cooking will do it (make one to freeze). Otherwise it's a 2 day affair. Fabulous recipe for a large gathering!

OK, it's a meal beyond compare, but my dishwasher threw down his towel and quit after 15 pans. You might as well make Julia's cassoulet from scratch, which is almost as much trouble. This recipe is only for the totally committed cook. Also, 450 degrees seems a little excessive, especially for the potatoes, which can be increased by about a third in my humble, Irish opinion. Furthermore, If you want to do this right and buy organic spinach at Whole Foods, which will cost you $11.00 for the 1 1/2 lbs., and $28.00 for the lamb shanks, it's not cheap, but this makes eight generous servings. Best idea is to make it ahead for company and feast on the leftovers during the week.

Best Sherherd's Pie recipe ever! I can't eat SP anywhere else now, even though I love to frequent the Irish Pub's because this is perfect SP. But of course, I did make a change or two from the original recipe. I've made this 15-20 times over the past few years and I would advise the following changes. First use lamb stock instead of the beef stock. Its not hard to make yourself, just get some lamb neck bones, maybe 1 1/2 - 2 lbs and brown them up in a little oil over medium heat. Add a medium chopped onion, 1- 2 sticks chopped celery, and 1-2 chopped carrots and cook until veggies begin to brown. Add 3 cups of water and scrape up the browned bits. Bring to a boil, reduce to simmer, skim froth and add 6-8 black peppercorns, a bay leaf and a teaspoon of chopped fresh rosemary. Reduce by half uncovered. Standard stock recipe really and very easy. Secondly I use smashed red spuds here instead of russet's. First roast up a head of garlic in the oven. Boil up the diced unpealed spuds and drain add the roasted garlic (cloves only), enough half and half and butter to your taste and I add a little Lawery's Seasoning salt (I don't make any kind of mashed spuds without that stuff) and spread over top of lamb mixture and spinach and baste with melted butter and cook as the recipe directs. I also add quartered sauteed Crimini mushrooms to the lamb mixture. If theres a better rib sticking winter warmer recipe for a cold night on Epicurious, I have yet to find it!

Exceptional. We made this for a dinner party for 12. We doubled the recipe and made everything the day before the party. Even the assembly. The nutmeg made the creamed spinach. It was rich and tender. Using our own mashed potato recipe, everyone raved from first to last bite. Doubling made 3 oval casseroles and we used two by offering generous portions. Very Generous. Froze the third pie and can't wait to have it again! The prep was very time consuming so take several hours for labor and you will find it was WELL worth it. A grand elegant take on comfort food.

This is delicious. Easy to put together if you split the cooking over two days. I was sceptical about the cooking method for the lamb but it came out beautifully tender and delicious. It's quite rich tasting and maybe next time I would serve the spinach on the side. I just made regular mashed potatoes and it was just fine. Worth a try. Also, I halved the recipe and it worked out great.

this was really amazing! i made it and froze - and it froze just fine. i used leftover lamb leg which i think is not as flavorful but was handy and still quite yum! Also used leftover mashed potatoes and it was wonderful. the flavors meld together beautifully and its amazing comfort food. One of my families new favorietes.

I prepared it as directed and it was a big hit for St. Patty's day. The lamb was very tender.

This dish received RAVES at a dinner party. I chose it because it could largely be made ahead of time...and I recommend it for that reason. Once the gravy and pan drippings were refrigerated, removing lots of fat was easy. I also followed a couple of shortcuts posted by other users and ended up with a fantastic and elegant version of yummy comfort food.

This was great, EXCEPT for the lamb and onions. The onions were charred to a crisp and the outside of the lamb was very crunchy, not at all tender. The rest of the pie was fantastic. Next time I'll braise the lamb using one of my other recipes instead of this method.

Rating: 2
This was very time consuming to make. The lamb was falling off the bone, very tender, but the taste was greasy even though I skimmed the fat off the broth. Would not make again.

Rating: 4
I recently made this dish for our dinner group and it got nothing but raves. Definetly do the lamb the day before to make it easier. I made garlic mashed potatoes instead of roasting them (saves time). Also for the creamed spinach, I used frozen chopped and squeezed out all the water when it was defrosted. Didn't cook ahead of time, just mixed in the sauce ingredients and added to the pie dish (also saved time). It was just fantastic.

This was the perfect Easter dinner buffet main dish. We made the layers the day before, as recommended by other reviewers, and doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers to freeze. Used red wine to braise instead of white and the flavor was hearty - we cooked it exactly to the time listed in the instructions and the meat just fell off of the bone. Lamb shanks can be fatty, but after separating the pan juices, there was no fat to skim off of the lamb and gravy layer the next day and it was not at all greasy. This was A LOT of work, even for two people, but all shepherd's pie lovers much try this at least once! It gets a 10 on the comfort food scale. And the leftovers were a big hit at work the next day.

Served this at a dinner party for 8 people on the weekend and it was utterly fantastic. I made it the day before which is essential - i can't stress that enough. It's a LOT of work - so much so that I vowed I'd never make it again. That is until I got to taste it! My tips: I haven't got a dutch oven so i used my crock pot. Browned the meat first and then followed recipe directions. I set the crock pot on low for 6 hours and it Worked perfectly. I added more sprigs of thyme and rosemary as well, and I made more creamed spinach than the recipe called for and I"m glad I did. With creamed spinach don't bother blanching first - just put in white sauce and you are fine. And finally, I made my own red-skinned mashed potatoes with garlic and fresh chopped parsley. It looked great and tasted delicious. So good luck and enjoy!

I hate Shepherd's Pie. I have always avoided eating it and have never ordered it. I can still remember being forced to eat it as a kid. Recently my wife requested that I make this recipe for an irish potluck dinner. All I can say is WOW. I never realized that this is what shepherd's Pie was meant to taste like. This is incredible. Trash and burn any recipe that you presently have for shepherd's pie that uses any kind of ground meat. I have to go now as I need to go to the store and purchase the ingredients for another shepherd's pie.

I have made countless recipes from this site that have been quite good and are now favorites. This is the first time I've reviewed a recipe. I'm taking the time to do so because I was so impressed with this dish. Absolutely wonderful. It is time consuming but well worth the effort. The only changes I made were 1)I left the carrots whole and braised in the pan with the meat and cooking liquid then cut into quarters after cooking and 2)I made my own recipe for garlic mashed for the topping. I would give this 5 stars if possible.

This was great on a cold wintery evening in the mountains after skiing. It did serve six very generously. Maybe I'm slow, but I believe it took a long time to prep - more than the hour indicated - but once done, ready to go!

This got rave reviews from everyone and served 7 easily (but to be fair to their "six generous servings," only one of those 7 was a really hearty eater) with about 2 servings leftover. I made the recipe as directed but baked it in a lasagna pan since I don't have an oval gratin dish. No problems with that. I'm not a huge lamb fan but this was one of the most delicious lamb dishes I've had.

Rating: 3
I would give this 3 and 1/2 forks if I could (I am stingy with the 4 fokr rating). Really good, and yes, time consuming. Cooked the lamb at 400 and it was fine, also did not used roasting pan but casserole dish like another reviewer suggested. Made all the components the night before and assemble pie day of. However, you need to leave the lamb mixture out longer to come to room temperature--maybe two hours? Otherwise it won't all get hot and gooey. Also used packaged creamed spinach but added in grated nutmeg and parmesan. I also used red potatoes cause I had them on hand. Will make again!

the combined flavors were divine--true comfort food. my only complaint was that the potatoes were stiff and rather uninteresting--i would add some sort buttermilk or sour cream in the future. i froze half, without the potatoes; topped them with some freshly mashed buttermilk potatoes and reheated--you would have never known it had been frozen. my husband adored this--used everly superlative in the book!

I made this recipe twice of the Christmas holiday, once for a party of 30 and the second time for a party of 8. I used lamb shanks first and leg of lamb the second time. This is better with lamb shanks, I used frozen spinach for the creamed spinach and added garlic, this works fine. It takes awhile to make but it great for parties so you don't have to spend time in the kitchen.

fantastic! fulfilling to make and to eat. i did substitute roasted vegetable broth for the beef broth. i look forward to making it for company next as you can do it all ahead.

I don't care much for carrots so I substituted bite sized pieces of cooked rutabaga. It added a very rich flavour to the dish. Just don't overdo it. I used one medium sized rutabaga. This dish is also good for using left over leg of lamb. Just reserve the juices from roasting your lamb to use in the gravy for the pie. Delicious.

I made this on cool fall day for my girl friend who doesn't care much for lamb and she LOVED it! It was hearty, full of flavour and thick. I made a few modifications though that I believe are worthy of note. 1. I only used a pound of spinach and doubled everything and only blanched it for about a minute. Freshly grated parm and nutmeg is an absolute must! 2. As for roasting and braising the shanks I recommend using as small a casserole dish as you can. The lamb will just fall off the bone and you will hold that much more gravy, which is outstanding! 3. I also recommend preparing the spinach, potatoes and lamb 1 day ahead and then prepare it the following day. I believe you find the lamp and especially the spinach will just knock you over. Though I believe once everyone smells your kitchen that may not be an option.

This was delicious and was a hit with my family. We enjoyed the leftovers two days later, and it was even better! We don't have a ricer, so I "whipped" the potatoes up a bit after using a traditional potato masher -- it worked great, and the pie looked beautiful.

I made a double recipe as an easy frozen meal for my grandparents using 15 mini-loaf pans which I then wrapped in foil and froze. My grandfather is really hard to cook for, but he enjoyed the old-fashioned appeal, while I enjoyed the nice balance of flavors. The potatoes came out a little too stiff and didn't spread very well. Next time I would pipe them over the filling to make more visually appealing.

While I usually don't review recipes unless I make them exactly as written, I have to write this! I used the leftover lamb from Easter dinner and simmered that in broth with onions and herbs till very tender. I also halved the recipe, as there are only four of us, and the two kids aren't guarenteed to eat a lot! Having said that; this is incredible!!! The creamed spinach layer is wonderful. My husband and I each had three servings (and perhaps more, if there was any left??) My nine year old loved it, and the seven year old ate some as well. A definite keeper, regardless of the amount of prep work. (I realize that I didn't have to do the lamb as written, but I made the spinach, potatoes and carrots ahead of time-as I will with the lamb in future-and time wasn't really an issue)

Rating: 1
Cook this at 450 degrees for over 2 hours???? You must have a different stove than mine. I checked the lamb after 20minutes and it was already burnt. Had to put those shanks in the soup kettle to save the meat. Went out and bought fresh shanks which I did at 350 degrees and the meat was falling off the bones in less than 2 hours. A bit of work to assemble the main dish but it was very good though a bit rich

Verygood. I would cut back on salt. Also agree that more potatoes would be good. Definitely make the day before.

A very differnt kind of shepard's pie that those I've have previously made (the ground beef kind), but also the best. I would suggest making more mashed potatoes, and decreasing the salt, or at least tasting as you go. The creamed spinach really made the dish special. I had to use 6 lamb shanks to equal 5 1/2 lbs. and I also suggest making the dish over 2 days, the braising takes a while. Make sure to remove the herb sprigs, or strain the braising liquid before moving on to the gravy. I agree with a previous cook's comments about potential "twiggy-ness" of the sauce.

Fabulous. Best Shepherd's Pie ever. I prepare gourmet meals every night, so I found the prep only a bit time consuming. Clean up as you go. I cut the recipe in half, substituted 2 (1lb) turkey thighs for the lamb, and used garlic instead of onion in the creamed spinach. There is really nothing to improve on this recipe. Rich and delicious.

Perfect dinner party fare. Labor intensive during the day but all I had to do was put it in the oven once my guests arrived. The recipe didn't specify what to do with the herb sprigs and I had to pick them out after making the gravy b/c I didn't want my guests eating leaves and sticks...

This is delicious and does have a very intense flavor. I would have given it four forks if it hadn't been so time consuming - I would definitely advise making it over two days. They must have bigger lambs in other parts of the country, because I had to buy 9 lamb shanks from my local Fresh Fields to equal five and a half pounds. Other notes - more mashed potatoes would have covered the dish better and you need to remove the herb sprigs if you don't want woody stems in your pie!
