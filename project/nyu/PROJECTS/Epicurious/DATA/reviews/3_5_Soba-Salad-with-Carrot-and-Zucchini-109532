I have made this recipe twice and substituted cucumber for the zucchini which really pumped up the freshness. I also used 2 T of sesame oil and 2 T of vegetable oil which helped make it more robust. I also like to add a little chili garlic sauce for a kick. Red pepper flakes work as well. Very tasty.

This is delicious and a great side dish. I think it might be boring as a main dish, but it goes nicely with salmon. We also made the peanut asian slaw recipe on this site, the two went together nicely and fed a lot of people.

I like this, but now see why the sesame oil would give the dish more depth. Light and refreshing. Satisfying.

I have made this twice, both time to rave reviews. I actually like this even more with about a 1/2 tsp of sesame oil. Very refreshing and great as a side with cedar plank salmon marinated in some of the same ingredients.

Did we all make the same recipe? I made this as written (no substitutions additions or deletions- as written) and it was absolutely one of the most disgusting things that has ever come out of my kitchen. The lime/ginger/soy sauce were totally out of balance with each other. The noodles were oily. I tried adding a little more salt to take the sharpness out of the lime, didn't help. I thought maybe it was one of those things that would be better the next day. No, definitely not. All of the lime seemed to dissolve some of the soba noodles...so they became no just oily, but pasty also. Overall, a total train wreck and a disappointing waste of beautiful farmer's market carrots and zucchini (which might have been the only part of the dish that tasted good after I picked them out).

Fast, easy, so flavorful and delicious. What more could you ask for? I like to add a little heat (chili or chili garlic sauce). Bell peppers are great in this and I think green onions are must. But any finely sliced or julienned veggies would probably be good. Very addicting. For ease of eating...try chopsticks.

This was very good and it really surprised me when just about my entire extended family like it (not a lot of vegetable fans in the group). I have a peeler that cuts julienne so this was super fast for me. Followed almost exactly (used sesame oil like other reviewers suggested, only 2 carrots and 1 large zucchini, added a thinly sliced red pepper and substituted fresh chives for the scallions (because that's what I had). I toasted some sesame seeds and sprinkled them on top. Made the whole thing ahead of time but kept the dressing separate until just before serving. Got rave reviews.

Great base recipe. Use as a side dish or add lots of veggies and/or a little seafood for a meal. I didn't use precise measurements on the dressing and used brown sugar instead of white. Next time I'll use fresh limes, but had to use bottled keylime juice today -- still very tasty. Oh, and I also added a bit of chili-garlic sauce for a little heat, but the dressing was good w/o, too. Easy to eat with chopsticks. ;)

The flavor was OK but I didn't like this so much because it was so difficult to eat.

I love this recipe, and knowing that my family is actually eating buckwheat noodles is an added bonus. I don't like zucchini...use a whole bag of shredded carrots, snap peas, red pepper strips, scallions and cilantro. Loaded with veggies it's my kind of a meal!

Good dish. Remember to whisk well. I refrigerated before serving and felt this brought the flavors out more in a better combination. Also, I replaced zucchini with cucumber and soaked the cucumbers in sesame oil before mixing into the batch. Also added brown sugar.

I used this recipe as reference, and adulterated it according to what I had in my fridge: I used sugar snap peas instead of zucchini, green onion instead of scallions, and added some pan toasted sesame seeds. I included a tbsp of sweet chili sauce for extra zip. Lovely.

I thought this was delicious! I added frozen peas instead of the zucchini. I didn't use all of the dressing, and added more lime juice and more vegetables than called for. It's a great recipe that you can easily customize to your liking.

Wonderful summer dish as you can incorporate whatever is fresh at the moment and serve it cool. We served it with grilled salmon. Next time I may incorporate a tablespoon of sesame oil.

The absolute best thing to do to this recipe is to add sushi grade sliced salmon or ahi along with decent chunks of avocado. Maybe some extra soy on the fish and avocado, but then it's perfect...a meal actually

This recipe was delicious and very easy to make. I made the everything the night before and tossed 15min before serving for a party of 30. Being Asian, I did do some improvising. I skipped the carrots and zucchini but added cilantro,fish cakes, shrimp, sprinkled toasted sesame seeds and used a bit of sesame oil. Very delicious and will make it again.

This is a great summer side dish, I served this with a grilled salmon with hoisin glaze. I added minced garlic to the dressing and a little more lime juice and sugar to add more tang. I also tossed in fresh snow peas for added crunch. Really good!

I thought this was okay, I wasn't too impressed with it. The only highlight for me was the marinated tofu I added. Not sure if I would make it again.

This is the greatest soba noodle salad i have eaten. i made the alterations people suggested, but i used toasted sesame oil instead of regular, and i would probably suggest using only 4 tablespoons of soy sauce. I marinated some extra firm tofu in a ginger-soy marinade over night and sauteed them and added them to the dish. it was a really wonderful meal, and both the noodles' and the tofu's flavor became much more rich when left in the fridge for a day or two after first preparing it.

This dish is great. Add some baked or fried tofu cubes and it's a great main course. Also, you can add any veggies. Whatever's in season.

My boyfriend said it was "professional quality." I thought it was great too. I halved the oil and used sesame oil--really think that made a difference. I added heat too, just a couple crumbled up dried red peppers. less carrots and more zucchini, b/c carrots are less tasty!

I make this all the time and my entire family (husband and 2 year old) loves it. I sometimes use edamame in place of the zucchini and I always add cilantro and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

The changes I made were to add abotu 1/4 tsp hot pepper flakes, and I used sesame oil instead of regular veg oil. It was great as a light main course with fried tofu added.

As written, this would have been good, but with some crushed red pepper and cubed tofu, it was fantastic. I also subbed sesame for the vegetable oil and reduced it by about 1/3. I think it was much better that way. I served as a vegetarian main dish and with the added tofu it was perfect. Ideal make-ahead food, and totally vegan too!

As is, the recipe is just alright. By following some of the recommended additions/alterations, the recipe becomes much improved.

What a different side dish to serve with Asian meals, a great alternative to rice! Deciding to make this on the spur of the moment, I did not have the specified noodles so used linguine. On reviewer recommendations I added some red pepper flakes and reduced the amount of oil and used only sesame oil--1 T. for the fourth of recipe I made. The leftovers were especially fragrant and flavorful so this would probably benefit from advance preparation.

Added red and yellow peppers, broccoli, cilantro and black sesame seeds. Also marinated chicken breast in tamari, garlic, ginger and red pepper flakes, which was diced then stir fried. It was all mixed together and served chilled. Quite tasty.

I made this recipe for a potluck and everyone loved it. I followed the advice of the person who said they added sesame seeds and firm tofu. I also used Sesame oil instead of regular veggie oil and cut the amount of oil about in half. I can't stand cold oily salads. It was quite tasty.

Not great. I would use much less lime than the recipe calls for. The lime taste was a bit overpowering.

amazing, really good, I added sesame seeds, and string beans half cooked. for presentation I recomend to fry some noodles and put them on top of your dish, it makes it look very presentable.

I made this for a Fourth of July picnic and we loved it! I didn't have soba noodles, so I used ramen noodles. I threw out the overly salty, msg-laden flavor packets and rinsed well after cooking. I used about three packs, which was about right for near-instant eating (next day it's a little bland). I also used cukes and celery instead of zucchini. I used a garlic press on the ginger to get the flavor w/out the fibers. I'll definitely make it again.

Tasty, and super easy. I added a bit extra sugar (1/2 or 1 tsp), which balanced overpowering lime juice. This was served w/ pan-seared tuna steaks w/ a cilantro, lime and ginger sauce, as well as panko-crusted pan-seared tofu for the vegetarians. It was actually quite tasty w/ the tofu, and I might add firm cubed tofu in the mix next time.

This needed a little more zip. I added a few tablespoons of season rice vinegar which helped. Also added chicken. Was much better as leftovers.

Delicious! I substituted chives for the scallions and added some toasted sesame seeds and blanched chopped chard. I will definately be making this (or a very close version) again. My three-year-old really liked it as well. Jenny
