This has to be one of my families all-time favourite meals. I have even served it as the main course at a dinner party (with a soup starter) and it got rave reviews. Extremely tasty and easy to prepare.

Wow! So good. I used baby greens instead of arugula and seared the Belgian endive pieces in the hot pan after I poured off the vinegar. Definitely a keeper recipe!

Delicious and very filling. I even dared to follow the directions verbatim.

This was unbelievable. I have cooked pork tenderloin several different ways and this is by far my favorite. The savory, nutty, meaty, and slightly spicy flavor was perfect with the spicy greens and tender pork. I paired this with orzo in a citrus vinaigrette for a nicely contrasted dish. Everyone who ate it agreed it was one of the best things they'd ever had. I can't wait to make (and eat) it again!

Delicious. I made it as written and even my husband who thinks salad belongs in a salad bowl with store bought Italian dressing enjoyed it and had seconds.

I have tried a few pork tenderloin recipes lately and this was the first one that didn't have some sort of fruit associated with it. I typically dislike fruit and meat together (call me crazy!) so I was pleasantly surprised to come across this recipe. I found it very easy to make and absolutely delicious. My dinner guests really enjoyed the meal too and thought I put a lot more work into it than I actually did. I should note that I followed the recipe to the tee and did not find the vinaigrette to be too thick. I will definitely be making this again.

This was incredibly easy and, ohhh, so delicious. I used two smaller tenderloins and turned them occasionally in the oven for even browning creating a delicious crust. My only addition was 2 T. fresh thyme and lots of black pepper to the dressing. Sweet potatoes are a fantastic side to this dish. Will make again, for sure.

I thought this was pretty good and I think with some adjustments it could be even better. I felt that the raw garlic overwhelmed the dressing somewhat, so next time I think I'll either blanch or, better yet, roast it for a subtler flavor. I also agree with a number of the reviewers who felt the dressing to be a bit to thick, so I'll also probably cut back on the walnuts and adjust liquid ingredient quantities.

Fabulous! The toasted walnut flavour made the vinaigrette exceptional. A wonderful one-dish meal without carbs for a low-calorie meal.

This was fantastic ... and so easy! I loved the pork preparation, which kept it moist. The sauce was delicious - "creamy" without fattening dairy products.

Great recipe and very easy to make. Served with butternut squash which I highly recommend! Will be saved in my favorites.

This was wonderful, and with no changes. Another time I might use two 3/4 pound tenderloins rather than one larger one, but with the same amount of vinaigrette. Served with a baked sweet potato, we loved this meal.

Delicious, and even more easy if you grill the tenderloin. I grilled on medium-high for 16-17 minutes, turning 4 times during the cooking. I served with baby greens containing cherry tomatoes and tossed with the vinaigrette. I also garnished with some fresh chopped parsley and basil from the garden. Wonderful!

Loved this and am planning to make it again. My entire dinner party raved about the recipe. I thought it tasted divine over the arugula. Yum.

I thought I had everything in the house to make this dish. I didn't, so I had to sub-in almonds, white wine vinegar and shallots for walnuts, red wine vinegar and garlic. It was really good anyway but I would try this again with the correct ingredients. I would also thin the dressing out a little as I too thought it was too thick over greens.

My family loved this. My father told me several times that this is a keeper. It's also easy to make, so you know I'll be making this again. My 12 year old sister was also a fan.

This is a healthy flavorful dish that is very simple to make. My boyfriend made it for me last night. While he is not very experienced cook it turned out lovely! He used radicchio instead of endive. He also did not have a blender, so he just crushed the walnuts by hand. I though it added a lot of depth and texture to the dish. Great light meal for the fall!

Made this for a quick weeknight meal. Everyone loved it. My 16 year old watched me make this and was prepared to "eat four bites and pretend I was full" ... but came back for seconds and thirds! A keeper!

This is such a simple and delicious recipe. Simple ingredients, easy prep and you end up with a great healthy meal that you know you will make again and again.

Two thumbs up. Even better than I'd hoped. Yes, the dressing is thick but I had no problem mixing it with the greens, didn't need to thin it first. Served with some warm bread for a complete meal that was easy to pull together. This will be a household favorite.

I thought the walnut vinaigrette was excellent and so was the tenderloin but putting it over greens just didn't make sense to me. I served it with roasted vegetables.

A tasty, interesting, and fast new take on pork tenderloin. The vinaigrette complements the flavor of the meat very well.

I too cut down the amount of walnuts, for fear of the sauce being too thick. I added juices from the meat after it rested, which helped thin it and add flavor. It a great dish, I'd say. I added to the salad crumbled Stilton cheese, and would consider finishing the dish with some pommegranate seeds.

Agree with the other reviews that the sauce was a little thick as written. I used half hazelnuts and half walnuts because that's what I had. Worked great. Also marinated the pork in garlic/dijon/apple cider vinegar before cooking. Used a coffee grinder to grind the nuts and blended everything else in a bowl. So much easier than lugging out my food processor. This was a delicious recipe and a beautiful presentation too! Serve it with bread for sopping up extra dressing ... yum!

We thought this was great for a quick and easy meal. I changed the vinagrette proportions to 1/3 cup vinegar, 1/3 cup water, 1/3 cup olive oil. It came out thin enough to toss the salad, yet thick enough to drizzle over the pork. My husband, who picked the recipe, said he was pleasantly surprised with how good it was.

Delicious! Based on comments here, I used alot of salad greens including radicchio, thinned the dressing a little by adding more water and vinegar, less oil , served it as a big salad with pork slices on top. A new favorite.

This was good but not a rave. I used balsamic vinegar after reading a review because that's all i had, but wouldn't use it again. It made the vinaigrette a dark brown unattractive color, for one reason. The dressing uses an unholy amount of olive oil and is a paste, not pourable. I enjoyed the combination of greens. For the pork tenderloin, I used one from Trader Joes already marinated in pepper and garlic; it had a great taste on its own. If you do this, eliminate the pepper from the dressing. Overall, this was a good concept but not one of my favorites.

My fiance and I loved this dish! Like the reviewer below, I used sherry vinegar, but only because it's what I had on hand. Add a baguette and you have the perfect meal! Delicious!

I have made this twice - best made with sherry wine vinegar. Once I used some fennel when I didn't have enough arugula. It is a terrific dish.

Rating: 4
Just excellent. Very easy to make, sophisticated flavor for such a simple recipe. I agree with another reviewer that there weren't enough greens for all the dressing. We saved what we didn't use and had it on a salad the next night.

Rating: 4
this is a sleaper hit - we weren't expecting the refined flavor this recipe packs. salad on it's own would work great with other matches. rich dressing offsets the bitter endive. our dressing ended up more like a paste, but that worked very well with the porc as well. definite keeper.

I used balsamic vinegar because I've got a sweetie who doesn't like tart dressings. We both loved this recipe. I added some radiccio for colour and texture. I also left the sauce thick to drizzle on the pork and thinned out the vinaigrette for the salad greens. However, I had to keep telling myself..it's the healthy fats...it's the healthy fats. This is a great meal for a special occasion - you know, those nights when calories don't count :)

Quite delicious! I rubbed the pork with a bit of Dijon mustard and garlic paste and let it sit for while, prior to wiping it down (so it wouldn't burn) and searing it. Loved the vinaigrette. Served it with steamed hericots verts, which were great with some of the vinaigrette drizzled over.

Rating: 4
Easy, delicious, and a great addition to the "greens topped with protein" menu. Adding the pork drippings to the dressing gives it such great flavor, the recipe is fabulous! Allow way more greens than called for, we both wanted more.

I made this last night and loved it. So easy, and the pork needs no additional jazzing up besides the delicious dressing. It's a great dish for a couple: one of whom is a serious meat eater, the other a greens lover.

The two forks are for the salad and dressing. There are many better ways to cook pork tenderloin. If it were possible to split up the elements of this recipe, I would rate the dressing a big four forks -- the pork 1.

This was good not great.. these are all my favorite ingredients so I was expecting something incredible. The dressing was quite good but I would have added a head of radicchio to the greens. The pork needs something to jazz it up.. mustard?

Lots of tasty going on! Roasty...toasty...ga rlicy & greenery. It all comes together delightfully...enjoy !
