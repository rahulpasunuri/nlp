This is not a good recipe if you have a picky eater.

To prevent the wrap from cracking, drizzle some water over it and then pat it so it's semi-dry before you heat it up. : D

Needs a little tweaking as written. In stead of the mayo, cheese and dried berries, I use cream cheese mixed with lingonberry sauce (cranberry sauce or even jam also works well), spread over the tortilla; it glues the wrap together much better. I also chiffonade the spinach - much harder to pick out that way!

I really liked this and have made it often. I skip the carrots most days, and use regular bread instead of wraps because I had trouble with the wraps cracking even if I heated them. Otherwise it's a nice combination and the cranberries are a great touch.

Very yummy. My kids loved the addition of cranberries.

Too bland and my children didn't like the texture. Took out the meat and cheese and left the rest.

this is a terrible recipe and i do not recomend it to any of the parents who are trying to find good, easy, and fast school lunches.
