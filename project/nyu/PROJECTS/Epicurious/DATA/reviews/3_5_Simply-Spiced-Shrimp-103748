Made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving to bring a little bit of Baltimore to my Pittsburgh in-law family and it was a hit! I made 4 pounds for about 17 people (6 boys under the age of 20) and had no leftovers :)

This was just OK. The spices did not do much for the shrimp it tasted very mild and "boring"

Whoops! Peeled shrimp before carefully reading recipe. Made the spice mix then decided to pan fry the shrimp. Melted butter in pan, stirred in about 2 tsp of spice mix and cooked shrimp. The flavor was delicious. Saved the rest of the spice for other fish or chicken at a later time.

Loved this recipe~! Cut the cayenne down to two teaspoons and used smoked salt. Disappeared faster than any other appetizer at our Thanksgiving dinner.

I just made this but I put the shrimp in a rice cooker/steamer. It worked just fine. I mixed the spices together and the taste was mildly spicy. This recipe is excellent with brown rice and green beans! Healthy too!

This recipe is quite delicious. I'm hooked. I make this recipe all the time now. I am going to cause a mass extinction of shrimp LOL!.

I made this and it was outstanding. I nixed the Old Bay (due to the MSG) and used Penzey's version. It was so good, it didn't make it out of the kitchen! On top of that, some of the spice mix dropped into the water and flavored the steam.

Tried this over the thai-like jasmine rice salad here: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/104147? -- (without the shrimp bits called or in h the latter). Great union.

I have made this recipe several times now and my husband and I have enjoyed it each time. It is a great dish to have ready in the fridge for healthy, after work snacks or unexpected guests.

This was perfectly simple, and excellent! I am glad for the spices recipe because I thought the Old Bay seasoning was a bit too salty for my taste. HOWEVER!!! by accident, we discovered that Old Bay mixed with lemon juice is a GREAT dipping sauce for garlic bread.

Have prepared this shrimp dish many times. Often serve along with rice, or steamed vegetables. It is easy and always a hit!

Made this as an appetizer for a Christmas party last week. The shrimp were tender and perfectly flavored. No one could believe how simple the recipe is. I'm making it again this week.

This is for the person who is wanting to find Old Bay Spice. In the US you can find it in the spice aisle of almost any grocery store. It comes in a bright yellow can with blue on it and white and red printing. You can find it here: www.marylanddelivered.com/oldbay.htm

I thought I already had the best recipe for shrimp, but that's because I hadn't tried this one yet. Made it just as written, except used all the spice on only one pound of shrimp. Exceptional!

Cajun and just good eating .I like the one big pot method , use the crab boil and veggies in one pot ,added small ears of corn with potatoes .Throw in the shrimp and crab when veggies almost done .Depends on how much spice you like.This is a keeper , my family loves it

I couldn't find the spice , in the store , so I just followed the recipe, to make your own . Oh my what a suprise. we made enough for 4, but the 2 of us ate it all.

Why steam? Down here in louisiana we use a bag of crab boil, a couple lbs of boiling potatoes, some lemons, lots of whole cloves of garlic and even more halved onions. Just through it all in the pot, when the veggies are done throw in the shrimp and you have dinner less than 5 minues later.

Sometimes the simplest things in life are the most pleasing. As mentioned by a previous cook, I use beer instead of water, and actually just toss the shrimp in rather than using a steamer basket.

As I was reading the writers version for a prepared spice mix, I looked on the back of my 'Old Bay' mix. The only simularities were paprika, mustard seed, bay and S& black pepper? I'm in N.Ca and accidentally stumbled upon it in the ethic section of the grocers, not in the spice section. Go figure? The very day that I found it in the store, I had searched it out to order via the Internet. I thought I would share the address for any of you who might be interested: http://www.mccormick.com/mc/index.cfm From that main page click on "OUR PRODUCTS" on the left hand side of the page. I use it all the time in just about everything! I have no idea why they make it so hard to find? It's not hard to find anymore...have fun with it!

One crack at this and it become a regular on my summer menu. Ridiculously quick and easy as well as healthful. I've used all sorts of shake-on seasonings, from cajun to curry, and it's a hit no matter what. I've also used bay scallops (sea scallops would work too), and it just doesn't get any better in the summer kitchen than "five minutes and dig in." Thanks for this one!

Very simple and very good. I used shrimp without shells and sprinkled lemon and lime juice on the shrimp just before they were done. May be too spicy for some, but not me!

I was looking for a recipe for this evenings dinner, and wanted something simple . . . the basics of steamed shrimp slipped my mind until reminded by this recipe. Yes, it is a basic recipe. Yes, those of us who have lived in the Chesapeake Bay area do know how to do this. However, with the availability of Old Bay Seasoning throughout the country (thank goodness! since I now live in California) there are many folks who do NOT know how to steam shrimp with this wonderful spice.

Quick, easy, and very yummy! These are all "key" words, as this simple recipe saved my hide after hastily inviting several travel-weary co-workers over for a home-cooked meal. We feasted on a few pounds of this shrimp outdoors along with a warm potato salad, cold dressed lettuce and a few pitchers of Bloody Marys.

A great starter for all who have lacked in the seafood experience!! We all have to learn somewhere and somehow.We appreciate that the Epicurious web site appeals to ALL levels of cooks in different types of cooking!!

Other reviewers have said that this is too simple to be called a recipe. However, when I wanted to know how to prepare some simple peel and eat shrimp for the first time, I couldn't find any other resource to tell me how to do it w/o wasting my spendy shrimp! This recipe was a great help, and the shrimp turned out great.

This is a basic receipe, but I usually boil the shrimp in beer instead of water, then dip them in butter laced with lemon. Simply irresistible!

NOTHING NEW HERE. I'VE ALWAYS MADE SHRIMP THIS WAY!! IF THIS IS A SAMPLE OF THE BEST FROM THE COOKBOOK, I WOULD SAY IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA ABOUT COOKING! I LOVE SIMPLE AND EASY TO PREPARE RECIPES, BUT, THIS IS REALLY TOO BASIC.
