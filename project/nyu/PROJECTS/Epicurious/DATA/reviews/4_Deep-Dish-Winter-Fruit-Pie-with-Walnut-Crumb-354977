I made this pie for Christmas dinner and everyone went totally gaga over it. It worked great in the springform pan. I followed the directions compulsively except that I omitted the figs as I didn't have any, used dried craisins, and a bit of snipped crystallized ginger. I will give it another go next weekend and try figs plus ginger.

This is my go-to pie recipe. I've made it 6 or 7 times now, for casual and more formal dinners. Always gets rave reviews. The only change I made was to use dried cranberries. The figs in it are wonderful. A definite warm winter comfort pie!

Pie crust has been my Achilles heel in the kitchen, but I hate to use store-bought crusts which always disappoint. Thrilled to say this technique turned out the most perfect flaky crust ever. The filling was excellent, but the plating was a challenge. Once I cut into the high crust, the filling wanted to tumble out of each slice. Not elegant, but man did it ever taste good. I might add a bit more cornstarch next time to bond the fruit together more, and make it in a deep dish pie pan rather than a springform. I used four small comice pears, two Granny smiths, and two Golden Delicious apples, Smallish black mission figs, and about 1-1/2 times the fresh cranberries suggested. Figs did not need pre-softening in hot water; just sliced them in half. As others have mentoned, this would be excellent as a fruit crisp without the bottom crust, but with my newfound crust success, I wouldn't skip that next time

Now that I live in California, there's this Apple/Walnut pie made at this bakery in New York City that I sorely miss. I've missed it so much, I've had this NY pie Fedex'd for a holiday dinner one year -- $80! Now THIS recipe makes a tremendous homage to that very pie, and for a lot cheaper than $80. I have a small apartment kitchen without specialty baking gadgets or standup mixers, so I subbed the crust with pre-made crust from TJ's or Marie Callender's. I dont use figs, and prefer to keep this a strictly apple/walnut pie. It turns out AMAZING every time -- as in, zero leftovers. Everyone loves this pie. I've used pears and cranberries in this too, but still prefer the simple Apple/Walnut combo -- mostly because it reminds me of my ol' pie place in New York City. Enjoy!

This was a big hit at my boyfriend's family for thanksgiving. I substituted some of the figs for dates, which was nice but didn't really make much of a difference. I also added extra cornstarch, as recommended. I should have added more because a ton of liquid spilled out in the car on the way over. The filling was delicious but it was messy and didn't hold together well. Almost more the consistency of a fruit salad than a pie filling. Tasted great, but be prepared for messy serving. I overfilled, also as recommended, and was really nervous when it came out of the oven still huge. However, by the next morning it had deflated some and was much more manageable. I also used my own family crust recipe so I can't comment on that part. The topping also tasted great. Overall, a good recipe that I will certainly keep for the future.

Absolutely amazing! Love the addition of the figs and cranberries. I can see why a spring-form pan was needed!

One of the best pie crust recipes I have ever used and I've used a ton. It gets the ratios just right for a perfect flaky crust. Also, I substituted frozen sour cherries for the cranberries and pecans for the walnuts and my family absolutely went crazy over how delicious this pie turned out. This just became our favorite pie ever!

I made this recipe based on its rave reviews. I thought it was okay, but not really worth making again. I didn't really get why it has to be made in a springform pan. I was afraid that it would fall apart if I took the sides off. If I made it again, I would just do it as a fruit crisp in a baking dish and skip the bottom crust.

This pie was an absolute hit at Christmas Eve Dinner--delicious. I only have one springform pan, and it was being used for cheesecake. I used two deep dish pie pans and made a little extra dough and crumble, the filling was plenty for two pie pans. I am glad I made two pies because my sisters who don't usually eat desert picked at the pies all night and then asked me to bring the leftovers to Christmas Dinner. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding extra cranberries.

This pie was fantastic! Perfect way to end Thanksgiving dinner. I made this with 2 large granny smith apples, 4 bosc pears, figs and slightly more than a cup of cranberries. I added some cardamom to the corn starch and sugar. I used a pre-made pie crust to save time and effort and i don't regret that decision for a second. I changed the crumble topping to 1 stick of butter and added a cup of oats. I had too much fruit even after mounding it, but it was fine to snack on while we spent the afternoon cooking and baking. I baked this for 70 minutes on 350 with convection, which was the perfect amount of time. Delish!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving. Have to love figs because the figs stood out. I may try making again without the figs and adding more cranberries. The crumble topping was really good. The pie crust was really easy to work with but I added closer to 7-8 tbsp water before it came together.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving & never reviewed it.... & It deserves to be reviewed because it was absolutely delicious! The only change I made was the crust... I used Trader Joe's to save time. Do not omit the figs as others have suggested. I thought they added a wonderful flavor as did all the different fruits. Only change I will make this year, since I will definitely be making it again next week for Thanksgiving, is to increase the cranberries.

This is a fabulous recipe! I tried it with sweetened dried cranberries and it was just great! The pie crust and topping can be made ahead of time ( the night before). Was a big hit with everyone!

This was good but I have some suggestions for next time. I'd pre-bake the crust so it'd have a richer taste, and I'd omit the figs - they seem out of place with the other fruit. The crumb topping was delicious, though.

This was ABSOLUTELY delicious. I made it as a crisp, doubled the fresh cranberries, and served warm with vanilla ice cream. Heavenly! I think this recipe would work well with almost any pie-friendly fruit. I look forward to making it with peaches, blueberries, raspberries, and rhubarb. I might increase the nuts in the topping as well, and the cinnamon and add cardamom, while eliminating the nutmeg (just not a fan).

Rating: 4
What can I say? It was delish! I made two minor adjustments. I cooked the figs in orange juice for a little added flavor. And I used 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup oatmeal in the crumbly topping because that is how I always top a fruit crisp. I baked it for about 1 3/4 hours. Next time I'll add some fresh purple plums for added color.

I had some troubles with this, although the results were good and I'd make it again. It was in the oven for an hour and 45 minutes, which meant my guests waited longer for dessert than I wanted. At an hour and 20 minutes I stuck a wooden skewer into it and a pretty uncooked piece of apple came out. At that point I turned on the convect to hurry it up. I would cut the fruit thinner than 1/2" thick next time to speed cooking. The juices were very thin (I used 3 tablespoons cornstarch) so next time I would use more, or something else as a thickener (I find tapioca a little more thickening than cornstarch). But it was quite tasty. I used 4 Fuji's and 4 Anjous, raisins and cranberries. Loved the topping but I didn't put it on until the pie had already been in the oven a while (I was sure it would burn if it was in the whole time).

Yummy! Excellent. I made it with apples only because that was all I had. Very good. Will definitely make it again.

Delicious. I had already made my dough and filling when I realized that my springform pan was way too small to accommodate the whole recipe. I split it up into two regular pie pans instead (it stretched the dough a bit, but was still adequate). I followed the recipe except for substituting reconstituted, dried cherries for the cranberries (not a huge cranberry fan). Don't skimp on the dates--they keep the pie interesting.

Soooo good! I didn't have the deep dish pan, so I just did about 3/4 of the fruit & made it in a regular pie pan. Loved it!

I loved the dates (chopped into smaller pieces after reading reviews) and increased cranberries by half a cup. I found the crumb topping a little sweet, but otherwise a delicious pie for a novice like me (I used a frozen pie crust and will be more adventurous next time). :)

amazing winter pie. delicious crust, wonderful crumb topping. only thing I would alter would be to multiply the cranberries (use fresh--it makes a WORLD of difference!) used by 3 for 4.

This was fantastic. My non-sweets loving Russian mother in law requested it again after just having it for Christmas dinner. I only used Rome apples and substituted pastured lard for the butter in the crust. Delicious.

Definitely a keeper. Homey, very seasonal for the holidays, but uncommon too. I followed recipe pretty closely except I used a different crust (the vodka crust from Cooks Illustrated) and a deep pie dish rather than a springform. Couldn't fit all the fruit quite. It set up very well and was not too juicy. Sliced pretty easily given the lack of structure. I would cut back on the crumb topping next time and maybe add a squeeze of lemon juice. It lacked acidity, just a tad, but I love tart so it might just be me. Needed 75 minutes for the thick bubbling to start around the edge. You could even make this with no bottom crust, just fruit and crumb topping.

Wonderful combination of flavors makes this a fantastic recipe. However, when evaluating a recipe in terms of directions and end result this one is just fair. I made 3 of these pies over the holidays. All were fantastic. I wasn't sure how the kids would like the figs so I diced them into pieces the size of raisins; also roughly chopped up the cranberries. The recipe doesn't specify what type of apples to use. I used a combination of granny smith and red deliscious. My pie was very watery and I actually poured liquid off and cooked for an additional 15 min. (1 1/2 hours total) End result was great. Each slice held it's shape and the taste was phenomenal.

I thought this pie tasted very well. It's was one of the more successful cranberry pie recipes I've tried. But I wasn't fond of the crumble topping, it tasted ok but it didn't look very pretty, and so next time I will use a different crumble topping. My pie also didn't fall as some people's did, so it was very deep (we called it a cake/pie) and very difficult to serve. So I would make it again, but there would be some tweaking involved.

This is a very solid fruit recipe. It's easy to make and the flavors and good. I recommend serving with vanilla ice cream as it does add another dimension.

I was a bit wary of the recipe at first (only because of the figs!). I followed the directions of one review below and I second recommending finely chopping the figs up if you're not too crazy about them; the taste is hardly noticeable if anything. The crust is definitely worth making although it is a bit time consuming. I made this for thanksgiving dinner and had rave reviews about it! This dessert is perfect for people who prefer their desserts not too sweet. This is a delicious & perfect "rustic" pie. I am making it today again for Christmas dinner!

I brought this to a dinner party last night and it was so fabulous! I boiled the figs in bourbon as another reviewer suggested and they were great. It took a little longer to cook than I thought it would, almost 80 minutes, so I will adjust the heat next time - it may be my oven. I also used Harry & David pears that we had gotten as a holiday present (the best pears I have ever eaten in my life). I used fresh cranberries - they were perfect. My husband and I had the leftovers (not much) this morning for breakfast. Wow. Perfect!

I made this pie accidentally forgetting the last step where you coat the fruit with water, cornstarch, and sugar before you add the filling to the pie crust. It came out fine. It wasn't as sweet as you would expect a pie to be but the walnut topping is sweet enough that I was very pleased with the result.

Rating: 4
This recipe is divine! It has replaced the traditional apple pie for the holidays in my home. I adjusted the amounts of the different kinds of fruit according to what I had on hand. I used bosc pears and a mixture of gala and red delicious apples. I reconstituted the figs in brandy instead of water (yum!) I also had a lot of fruit...overflowing my pie dish. I ended up making some extra crumble topping and turning it into a tart. It was so good I have another one in the oven right now.

Please don't use store bought pie crust. The crust in the recipe is so good, crispy, light, flaky, it's the perfect combination with the heavy fruits. When boiled the figs are not at all overpowering. In fact, I may consider adding a few more next time. Also, definitely add more cranberries if you would like them to stand out as the apples tend to overpower them a bit. Made for Thanksgiving and my family loved it. Ice cream is a MUST. Would definitely make again!

This pie is a masterpiece. I added a little orange zest and some juice and also used a combination of pink lady and granny smith apples. Like other reviewers suggested, I over filled the pie and it came out beautifully. Family and friends raved.

delicious. absolutely delicious. I can see how some people might think it is on the sweet side (it is, due to the walnut crumb topping and the figs) but the cranberries, apples, and pears help tone it down. I used more fruit than what the recipe called for but thought the pie lived up to its "deep-dish" name by using a springform. because I added more fruit than originally called for, I made 1 1/2 times the cornstarch/sugar slurry to make up for that. It may've added to my having to drain the fruit juices during the baking process (the crust wasn't browning as well as I had wanted) and I did have to bake it for longer but ultimately, the moist interior, flaky crust, and just overall melding of flavors made this a winner. Will definitely be making it again. Oh, I used 3 Braeburn apples, 1 Granny Smith, and I think 3 green Anjous.

this was good but not as great as i expected given the reviews. i'd add more cranberries next time, and maybe skip the crust all together. make sure that the topping is broken into small bits.

I riffed on this recipe, adding less flour and more butter to the "crumb topping" and then dotting that between an added lattice-top. I skipped the berries, instead adding more figs, and baked it for about 50 min. It's a delicious pie!

Great way to mix up the typical autumn apple pie. I made this today for friends and one said she doesn't even normally like apple pie but loved this. It looks like there's a ton of filling, but as everyone says it bakes down a lot. We had to bake it for approx. 70 minutes. Served with freshly whipped cream. I really enjoyed the figs in it. Wouldn't change a thing except that we used a store bought crust, and it sounds like it's worth making my own next time.

Made the crust and put it in the pan the night before and then made the fruit filling and walnut crumb the day of. The crust was wonderful, definitely use it vs a store bought. Definitely use all of filling as it will fall down. I thought the figs were ok, but might try a replacement next time. The topping is wonderful. Served it with brown sugar and balsamic ice cream and it was great. Very sweet, but yummy.My topping stayed on when cut. Will definitely make this again. Great the next morning.

When I made this pie, I followed the recipe with one exception -- I followed the recommendation of one reviewer to overfill the pie -- using 4 large apples and 4 large pears. The pie tasted great, but with so much fruit in the pie, once the pie was cut into pieces, the crust tended to crumble. I plan to substitue raisins for figs next time. The figs were OK, but were too much of a contrast to the softened apples, pears and cranberries. The pie was wonderful served with vanilla ice cream.

This turned out to be a wonderful dessert. I highly recommend making the crust per the recipe, because it turned out fantastic. Just perfect! I definitely would not try store-bought, and really, it's not all that much work. I too could not find frozen or fresh cranberries anywhere, so I went with blackberries (yummy). I am a fig fan, but I did not much care for them in the pie. After eating a few servings I found myself picking them out. When I make it again I'll use fresh figs, or just substitute them altogether for another fruit.

Incredibly delicious and impressive! My family could not stop raving about how this pie looked and tasted like it was from a bakery because it was so impressive! I would do this deep dish pie idea using the crust and toping for a number of other pies. Even just doing this with simple apple would be spectacular. I highly recommend this recipe. I followed it exactly, my only problem was my oven decided to stop following the dial and I eventually realized that the temperature wasn't high enough, so I had to cook this a lot longer. But it was totally worth it! Really wholesome, filling and a real winner!

Made this over the weekend and the whole family loved it. I used 2 Rome Beauty & 2 Granny Smith apples, and followed the recipe exactly. It came out great. I did use a different crust recipe - not that this looked bad, I just went with the one I always use. I covered the pie loosely with a piece of foil after 40 minutes of baking to slow down the browning.

My whole family enjoyed this pie last night, and we were all impressed w/ the recipe. Will make a great finale for any holiday meal. I chose to use rolled pie pastry from the grocery store; was OK, and worth the time it saved. I buttered and floured my springform pan prior to fitting the dough, and I think that lead to some greasiness in the crust of the final product. I used 5 huge Honeycrisp apples, 4 bosch pears, one cup figs, and a little bit extra cranberries. This huge mound of fruit fell about an inch while baking, as noted by a previous reviewer. I baked for 70 mins total b/c the fruit wasn't quite tender after 60. Vanilla ice cream is a must, and i made my serving into a dessert casserole. B/c my fruit mound was towering, the walnut crumble needed to be pressed down into the top, and that made for a solid, single-piece crust atop the pie instead of a crumbly topping. Not ideal for appearance, but no problem otherwise. I definitely suggest over filling this pie w/ too much fruit! I had a pomegranate handy, and thought the seeds might've added something desirable; maybe next time.

I could not find frozen cranberries and it was too early in the season for fresh, so I used blackberries. I also added pecans to the topping. I usually don't make pastry items but I gave this a shot, and it came out fantastic, everyone loved it! Make sure your spring form is heaping with fruit, it falls about an inch. If I make this again I would use premake pastry dough, way to much work! This is very good cold and last for about 2-3 days.

This was a great autumn pie! The crust came out perfectly, flaky and delicious. The only changes I'll make for next time are using 5 apples (rather than 4) and 3 pears (rather than 4). This time I used Macs and green pears and those worked very well. I used fresh cranberries because I couldn't find any frozen ones. I skipped the step about boiling the figs, which was fine. The dried figs I bought were nice and moist, so I'm not sure why that was necessary. Rather than slicing them, next time I'll chop them, though -- the slices of fig could be overwhelming. Delicious and pretty easy!
