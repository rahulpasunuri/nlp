Had a version of this at the Ritz Carlton in Cancun served in a Coconut Shell. . . Outstanding. . . So I make this with cream and coconut water or Coconut milk and water and then chill it to within an each of its life. . . .

Agree with the cook from Maine - with the revisions, this is a wonderful soup that I have also eaten for breakfast (maybe we Mainers are just weird?). But I will also freely admit that my husband and 19-year old daughter are less enthused, though my 23 year old daughter liked it. But I love it and make it several times a summer.

I really didn't like this soup. It was bland and not as refreshing as I expected. I followed some reviewer suggestions and did not add the water, but I wanted the soup a little thinner and added more buttermilk instead. I wish I had added water instead; the buttermilk flavor seemed a little too strong (though perhaps I'm just not a buttermilk fan; I've not used it much before). Adding lime juice did improve the flavor somewhat, but I still wasn't very happy with it. It wasn't so bad that it was inedible, but I won't make it again.

I used the proposed revisions (no water, increased buttermilk to desired consistency). I thought it was great but my boyfriend only took a couple of spoonfuls before pushing it aside. I was happy to find a gazpacho like soup without tomatoes.

Luckily I misread the recipe and didn't add any water, but added buttermilk to taste, as a previous reviewer suggested. It came out so well I ate it for breakfast the next day too - one of those hot days when you can hardly breathe. Give it a try!

Delicious. Skipped the water and simply added buttermilk until the soup reached a consistency I liked in the blender. Added the avocado, crab & caviar timbale from another recipe at this site. Yum.

Sorry to have wasted perfectly good vegetables on this!!! Very bland and watery!!

There is a way to make this taste good. Do not add the 1.5 cups water. Do add several squirts fresh lime juice. Do not be tempted to increase quantity of mint, lest it overpower the more delicate components. Otherwise prepare the recipe exactly as specified (though I omitted the scallion, since I have an aversion towards it) and you will have a thick, creamy, cooling concoction with distinct notes of cucumber and avocado. Thanks to previous reviewers who alerted the public as to the tastelessness of the original version.

This was very bland. A real disappointment.
