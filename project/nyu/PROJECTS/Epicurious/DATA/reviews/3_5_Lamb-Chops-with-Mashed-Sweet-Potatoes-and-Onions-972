I just made the sweet potatoes. The recipe filled up my DLC-8 Cusinart and came out creamy. Next time I'll mash by hand for a chunkier consistency. The taste is very nice - not sweet and a bit nutty.

i just made the sweet potatoes... followed the recipe to a tee and they came out perfect. i had to add a tiny bit of water each time i pureed them so that my blender wouldn't clog, but not much.. just enough to get them smooth. normally i like a chunkier mash, but the smoothness in this recipe works. and the hint of cloves and thyme adds a certain sophistication to the taste.

I prepared only the sweet potatoes and the sauce with a beef roast for a luncheon of 30 people. I received great compliments! The sweet potatoes I boiled in chicken bullion with two bay leaves. Then, the onion I chopped very, very finely, sauteed in the butter for quite a while. Then, added the fresh thyme, pepper, salt and mashed together by hand. To improve the consistency, I added half and half. For the presentation, I added parmesean cheese which added a nice touch both for flavor and for the site.

this is by far one of the best recipes i have come across.. the potatoes and stock can be made a day ahead without any fault in taste. I have a hard time finding lamb neckbones, so sub with my butchers "selection"..all have worked well...i prepare potatoes a day ahead and reduction...so day of dinner is just a simple roast/grill of lamb chops. this is one of the best recipes ever....period.

LOVED the lamb, but didn't care for the sweet potatos. I like my version much better (1:2 red potatos to sweet potatos, mashed with butter, brown sugar, milk, sour cream and salt/pepper) and take alot less time. This dish really takes along time to make. I must not have "simmered" high enough because after 2 hours I was at least 6 cups and certainly not 20 minutes away from 2/3 cup. Anyway, it was so worth the time because that gravy was fabulous! I wish I could have thought of something else to do with the leftovers--it pained me to throw them out! I will definitely be making this again.

I followed the recipe for the sweet potatoes as indicated. I'm afraid it was not too appetizing. For some reason, onions and sweet potatoes are not a good match. I would just stick with the traditional method of making sweet potatoes--some brown sugar, cinnamon, and even some marshmallows, if you prefer. I will not make this recipe again.

Like cobcobb, I made just the sweet potatoes as part of Turkey Day dinner. Loved the flavor and consistency. I prepared this about two weeks ahead, then froze the casserole . Thawed, and reheated for about an hour (350). Will do it again. Next time I'll try the whole recipe.

By accident, this recipe has resulted in two great meals at our house. The first time I made this, I went to several high-end groceries looking for lamb neck bones. I finally bought lamb shanks instead. I used those to make the sauce (substituting red wine for some of the broth) and the meat was so fantastic we ended up having lamb shanks that night instead of the chops. The incredible sauce (which is worth the time, especially when you get great lamb shanks too) was used the following day with chops and sweet potatoes. The potatoes are excellent -- I have passed that portion of the recipe on to a couple of friends whose cooking always leaves me drooling and they loved them, too. The potatoes also make a great thanksgiving/holiday side dish. BTW, I have frozen the sauce with good result.

Just made the sweet potatoes. Turned my sister, a sweet potatoe hater, into a devoted fan. She insists I make this for Christmas dinner. No more canned yams!

Love this dish!!Two suggestions - add roasted garlic to the sweet tatoes and pull up the Turkey Croquette recipe here, sub the lamb neck pcs and the reduced sauce for the turkey & chix stock. Two wonderful new dishes!!

Yes, making 2/3 cup of sauce is worth the time and trouble. This was delicious even though I didn't make the sweet potatoes. I and my husband kept pulling the meat off of the neck bones and dipping it in the sauce long after the dinner was finished.

outstanding recipe as the potatoe and sauce can be made a day ahead with no loss in flavor......nothing to do but heat and cook the lamb chops day of dinner....and the sauce is simply outstanding! No matter that you only make a tiny bit of sauce as you just need a little of this rich deep sauce to add all the final fireworks to your masterpiece! Have done several times now, and thrilled with the ease and compliments!

while it was very easy, and quite tastey, the sauce took a very long time 2+ hours cooking... was it worth it for 2/3 of a cup???

The sauce is a bit labour-intensive, but worth it, and is better if you substitute some red wine for broth. I mashed the sweet potatoes by hand, leaving them chunky, for more texture. Great.

I loved this recipe and enjoyed making it. I did substitute rum for some of the broth, with wonderful results!
