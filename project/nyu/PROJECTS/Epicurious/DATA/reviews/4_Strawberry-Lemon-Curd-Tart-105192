Made this for work due to a glut of strawberries. Apart from having to figure in all the chilling time (don't start this at 8pm on a work night) the recipe is fairly straight forward and I didn't make any significant changes. Free dessert is always popular but lots of people sought me out to thank me for bringing this in.

Easy and quick to make and very good. I love the crust. I sliced the strawberries and laid them on top instead of leaving them whole and the presentation was lovely and simple.

Really good, and very simple. The crust is easier to work with than a pie crust (the yolk gives it more stability). I refrigerated the dough in the tart pan overnight and baked it the next day. I was surprised at how easy the curd was to make. Looked very pretty and was gone in minutes.

Making a fruit tart is simpler than I thought. There's not a lot of cooking involved. I think the only part that takes a while is making the crust. The curd is extremely easy to make. The recipe says to whip the curd for about 8 minutes but I found that whipping it a few minutes longer gave the thickness that I wanted. DO NOT take the curd off of the stove until you've reached the consistency you want. I went easy on the zest because I didn't want the lemon flavor to overwhelm and I added less sugar in the curd. I topped mine with strawberries and blackberries and it was deeeelicious. Definitely a recipe I will make again.

delicious and very easy to make. perfect for spring. only changes i made were to the crust. used half and half instead of cream with no problems. and i cut back on the rest time for the crust and after putting it in the pan, i did a quick 15 minute freeze instead of an hour in the refrigerator. still turned out great.

this recipe is amazing! it is pretty easy (although i would prepare it a day in advance) and it tastes amazing! it also tastes and looks great with blueberries which can sometimes be cheaper at the supermarket.

This was pretty good, my friends all liked it at the BBQ I made it for. It was not quite the texture I wanted, but perhaps I am unaware of what curd is supposed to be like? Mine came out like thick pudding, but I was hoping for something more like egg tart texture. Nevertheless the flavour was amazing! I put fresh blueberries and raspberries on it. I highly recommend putting raspberries on it, they go REALLY well with the lemon. The glaze adds a really nice touch, reminded me of the little tarts I had in Paris! The only change I made was multiplying the curd by 1.5 (this was the perfect amount), and whisking it on the stove for a bit longer so that I got a thicker consistency.

Well I went the same route as halfnhalf and was lazy & cheap. I used Krusteaz Lemon Bar Mix; I've made the lemon bars before & had raves, I didn't have tart pans and used compote cups, hardest part was arranging the sliced strawberries on top. Looked & tasted great.

I was super lazy with this one and it turned out great. I used lemon curd in a jar from Trader Joe's and refrigerated prepared pie crust from Pillsbury and I microwaved the jam. Quick and delicious.

Very easy and an elegant presentation. Very good and easy tart crust. I added more lemon juice and zest and liked the extra tartness.

My all-time favorite spring/summer dinner show-stopper. Amazing tart.

This is a wonderful lemon tart recipe! I have made it several times and it gets better each time. Be sure to constantly whisk the curd so you don't get egg chunks and make sure its thick before you remove from the heat, that way it won't get runny. As for a tough crust, I always pull it out of the oven a few minutes early as I find it cooks just a tad more even after its out. Trust me, this is a really good tart!

Tart tasted nice, but the comments below are absolutely accurate. The curd WAS runny and the crust VERY crisp. This combination equaled a mess when I came to serve it. As I said, the taste was fine, but the presentation abysmal (at least for me), so I probably would not be tempted to attempt this again, seeing as there are many other (more ascetically pleasing) tarts out there to try.

Delicious and light. Use a real removable bottom tart pan (much shallower than a pie pan) and you will not need extra curd. Curd is a little tricky, you must whisk it constantly in a high quality saucepan or it will not have the volume or consistency required. Chill it for at least 2 hours before you add the fruit. I used a combo of sliced strawberries and blueberries to top it.

I wish I had read these reviews first! I needed to double the curd recipe, and also strained out the little cooked egg bits. The crust was a bit too tough, and the curd a bit runny, but everybody still loved it! Lots of raves. I'll probably make it again with blueberries, but I may try another pastry recipe. It does look and taste great.

I enjoyed this tart very much. My dinner party guests did as well. It was a little runny when I cut it, and the crust broke up a bit. The taste was superb.

Good taste and easy to make, but the presentation was odd and the big stawberries sticking up made it very adward to cut, serve or eat. I prefer the lemon chess pie with blackberry sauce for a similar taste - it's a little more time consuming but a lot more elegant.

I've made this one a few times now. I love the taste and the beautiful look of the finished tart and have received many compliments on it. I've used both a 9" and an 11" tart pan, either works with the amount of dough. I've one and a halfed the lemon curd as suggested. I found the curd was runny so I added a teaspoon of corn starch. That seemed to work. I still have a problem with the "running" even though the curd was now thick enough. I think it's the brand of jam I'm using for the glaze, it's watery, next time I'll try cooking the jam down for a few minutes.

Delicious! The only problem was that the curd turned out a little runny and didn't hold together well. Next time, I would add an extra egg yolk to thicken it up. The taste was delicious though. As for the dough, I didn't bother refrigerating it prior to rolling it out. I took the dough right out of the food processor, kneaded it until it held together nicely, rolled out the pastry and fitted it into the tart pan and then refrigerated it for about an hour or so. It was delicious.

I agree that I'd increase the lemon curd by 50% next time I make this, but overall it was a great dish for a Spring dinner.

I made this tart last Sunday, and followed all the directions. The lemon curd was delicious, it would make a nice cake filling. Strawberries with the jam glaze was nice with lemon. The crust though, leaves something else to be said. Perhaps it was because I didn't whirl the dough in a processor, and used a pastry blender. I did not knead it either, I gathered the dough together like one would with making pie crust. My crust came out tough, and I had to eat the slices held in my hand. Would someone know why it came out so tough when I worked with the dough delicately? Thanks.

I have made this recipe several times, using what ever fruit is fresh and seasonal at the time. I plan to make it for Easter.

Excellent recipe. I made this a few weeks ago and will now make it again for St. Patty's day. I'm going to double the lemon curd amount this time and try very very hard not to follow the instructions of another poster and melt chocolate on the crust when it comes out the oven!

I made this tart for a dinner party dessert. Everyone loved it. My only problem with it was the crust was very hard, too hard to cut with just a fork. Maybe I cooked the crust too long? Next time I will not cook it as long. It makes a beautiful presentation and is very easy, especially since you can make the crust and curd ahead of time. Definitely a keeper!

My first tart - and it was fabulous. I was really nervous and at first I thought the crust was going to be a complete catastrophe, but it was just lovely. I didn't use the lemon peel (didn't have any at home right then) and it was still lemony enough (I did put in maybe a little extra lemon juice). I cut the strawberries up - the ones I had were just too huge for people to eat them comfortably without cutting. My one problem was that cooking the curd over medium heat started the eggs cooking, so next time I'd do that part at a much lower heat. I guess it just depends on your stove. But even though the crust takes a lot of steps, all were easy and it was so good that I'm definitely going to make it again. My non-lemon fan boyfriend even loved this.

FABULOUS -- I increased the lemon curd by 50% and strained it -- I didn't like the lemon peel -- this produced a much more silky texture too. Simple to make.

I prepared this tart for friends and they loved it. I made individual tarts and wish I would have made more curd. Will next time. I also melted dark chocolate on the tarts as soon as they came out of the oven and waited for it to cool before applying the curd. I couldn't find nice looking fresh strawberries so I substituted fresh raspberries. This was an easy to follow recipe and I will make it again for sure.

This is one of the best tart recipes I have made. I have made it three times now and each time it was a winner. I used my own tart dough, but the curd was delicious. It was easy to make, and the presentation is outstanding. Everyone loved it!

Very good. I made 4 individual 4" tarts instead of one 9" tart. Also, it took me about 8 minutes longer to achieve pudding-like consistency for the lemon curd.

I have to agree - this is great and easy. I one and a halfed the lemon curd and would probably do that again, although it was maybe a little too much. No one complained. In fact I had a tiny slice and my boyfriend and brother polished off the rest of it in one sitting. I would recommend the lemon curd with muffins or scones as well.

We love this recipe! My husband and I returned from Paris, where we indulged in 'tart au fraises' every day, to find this recipe waiting for us! I've made it three times in the last month and now that strawberry season is over I'll try it with fresh raspberries. It's wonderful.

My family and my guests loved this dessert. The lemon and strawberries were a wonderful combination. It was easy to make and extremely tasty. I would definately recommend this recipe.

Fabulous! I made this as well as the raspberry trifle for Father's Day and both were a hit. This one rated hired than the raspberry trifle, so I gave it 4. Great taste, great look! I used strawberries we picked the day before and a strawberry jam my mom made for the glaze. It didn't take all of the glaze,so next time I won't use as much jam. This is an easy recipe. The crust is really easy to work with, just throw it in the food processor and frig, it has a great buttery and sweet taste. Fun and pretty dessert for the season!
