Delish! I made homemade ranch dressing with buttermilk and used that; made the salad very flavorful. The colors are beautiful and everything is crunchy and textured. Lots of chopping but worth it.

I love this! It is sooo great on a hot summer day, and will make a great lunch to take to work...filling but not too much. Instead of ranch, I used olive oil mayo, then seasoned with fresh ground pepper, dried dill, fresh sea salt, a little dried thyme, and some Mrs. Dash since I was lacking some of the spices I was craving...it turned out great! Also, I used cukes that had been peeled the night before and refrigerated and they didn't seem too watery atall...maybe the overnight peeling helped???

We made this as the main dish for a summer lunch and it was a big hit. We were in Italy where tuna in oil is more common and I think it actually added a lot of flavor. Also, I used mayo instead of Ranch dressing and provided grated parmesan cheese which was terrific sprinkled on top. We also passed on the dill and it came out fine.

I used mayo and instead of dill, mint from my garden. It was very tasty and will be a staple in the summer at our house from now on, most certainly.

I tried the recipe and it was too rich as the ranch dressing over-powered it. I made this again but I replaced the Ranch with part low fat mayo and part Wasabi dressing (bought at FreshFields/Whole Foods.. Trader Joe's also has a Wasabi dressing) I used spring onions and shallots. I also grated the cuke and salted and squeezed out the liquid. The 3rd time I made this, I substituted the canned tuna with freshly grilled tuna steak. Impressive.

I tried it with mayo instead of Ranch (suggested below) and liked it much better. Also, "dried" the cukes. Great suggestions! a colourful and crunchy salad.

Next time. . . I'll use more tuna, I think. I could hardly tell there was tuna in this salad at all! I loved all the veggies and I appreciate the reviews I read before making this! It helped me make it better. I will definitely make this again. The colors were nice on the table. I used grape tomatoes instead of a big tomato cut up. Great taste!

Would make again if I used a homemade dressing but I used some Kraft Zesty Italian with some Hellman's Mayonnaise. The success of this recipe depends on the choice of dressing and store bought isn't my favorite. It's easy to make but quite a bit of chopping but if you're going to put some effort into the salad then you may want to choose a dressing that you love. To the first reviewer of this recipe, what does "mix in pasta" mean then??

This recipe deeply satisfied my craving for tuna salad, and it was improved greatly by a few adjustments. It was significantly brightened at the very end by a generous squeeze of lemon juice and a half-T of olive oil. The salad also benefited from a decent dose (didn't measure) of salt and a vigorous couple 'a shakes of cayenne. For added flavor, I subbed a cupful of grape tomatoes for the biggie, drained the cuke as described by an earlier cook, subbed a chopped carrot for the two stalks of celery, and added about 15 chopped Kalamata olives. I used only 4 T. of non-fat mayo instead of the ranch. (More added fat was not necessary for this lushly gratifying dish.) One small caveat: It may be because my dried dill was a bit dated, but I couldn't taste this lovely spice in this recipe. I think this dish would certainly benefit from using fresh dill, but if you don't have it, you might consider adding at least an extra half-T of the dried stuff. This recipe easily served my husband and I for last night's dinner. I liked it so much I'm making another batch today.

I am usually not good with new reciepts. This was easy. Went to the store at 5, with everything else going on, it was on the table at 7. Two of us ate the four servings for dinner with some french bread and loved it. Definately will do it again. Thanks

I made this the 1st time with tuna and the 2nd time with small salad shrimp. I also used about 1/3rd of a large English cumcumber, sliced in half lenghwise and scaped out the seeds with a spoon. Then lightly salted it and set it shell side down on paper towels for about 30 minutes. Then dried it with dry paper towels. The cukes are a wonderful addition, but tended to sog out the salad. This way worked better. I also dressed it with mayo the 2nd time instead of Ranch and added some chopped olives. Green olives with pimentos one time and black olives another time. The one with the mayo was rated much higher!

Simple and quick to make, delicious to eat. How could cucumber ever be too strong?

This is very good and would go nicely with a picnic lunch; however, it needs to be consumed fresh. It doesn't keep very well for leftovers (the vegetables made it soggy).

This was really good! Go easy on the tuna, though.

We loved this recipe and will make it again and again. Very colorful, wholesome and healthy!

the cucumber is too strong for this salad

It was excellent & very colorful, my wife suggested that it might tast even better if crab meat was substituted instead of tuna.

The recipe should probably say combine first 7 ingredients (or else tell us what to do with the pasta)! Thanks!
