This recipe is good but agree it needs some tweaking. I think so many various reports are due to the fact of the recipe using a very generic terms for things such as "Jamaican jerk or Cajun seasoning" and "Lime- or lemon-pepper seasoning" I did not think this recipe had enough flavor with the initial recipe. I added a little sriracha and an avocado sour cream dip. Make the corn relish a day ahead of time for the flavors to stew together. For me it tasted better the second day. Also I had to lower the heat for cooking the shrimp. The suggest heat was too much and burned my test shrimp. Might make again with a lot of adjustments.

I forgot to add that I mixed a 1/2 cup of sour cream with siracha (to taste-I used to generous squirts) to put on top of the tacos.

I read all the reviews and made one change....I doubled the entire marinade recipe for the same amount of shrimp. It was delicious and a hit in my house. It was be a regular in our rotation of dinners.

I've made this recipe a few times, I love it. I like to dice the shrimp into chunks and marinade it for several hours instead of just one hour. For the relish I use fresh corn cook it briefly so it's still crunchy - I don't bother with the tomatoes (not a fan), and instead add cilantro and lime juice to the corn and green onion. The reduced marinade sauce is great, and really adds to the taco. I will continue to make this!

The first time I made this it wasn't very good. The second time it was very good because I made these adjustments: 1. Double the honey, cajun, and paprika. 2. Add to the corn relish: lots of cumin, paprika, lemon-pepper, salt. 3. The glaze is key. Everything is tasteless without the glaze. Make as much of it as you can because it boils down low and you end up with too little.

Very nice and quick. Great week night meal and ned not stay true to the veggie recommendations. I ran out of scallions so subbed diced green peppers which I browned with the corn. I also diced the shrimp before sauteing.. to give more edges that slight char and make it easier to pile on the tortilla (which in my case was also corn, not flour).

Very tasty! Loved the marinade. The only changes I made was using corn tortillas instead of flour and I garnished with red cabbage and a little bit of feta. I'll definitely make these again!

I just cooked this for dinner and it was a big hit. We loved it!!! I did make a cream sauce to go with it, which put it over the top!!! 3/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup mayo, 1 chipotle pepper (from a can) plus 1/4 tsp sauce, juice from small lime. Yum Yum Yum

I made these last night! They were SOOOO good!! The only alteration I made was using corn tortillas instead of wheat. This was a keeper in my family!!

This was just okay. I also added black beans and was able to use the leftover corn relish w/ a sauteed zucchini served on tortillas. Definitely a good summer dish because of all the great corn and tomatoes around right now. I think it was better without the shrimp, but then again I don't really like shrimp but wanted to try this in hopes it might win me over. No dice. I would probably only make the relish again, which I could have thought of on my own.

I added a can of drained black beans to make it a heartier entre. Instead of using 1/2 a cup of lime juice, I added the juice of 1 lime, which tasted about right.

Absolutely delicious. The reduced marinade provided such a nice extra kick and sweet/tangy contrast to the relish, to which I added minced jalapeno and chopped cilantro. A simple dish with a complex flavor profile.

I loved this recipe! Very easy and was able to make it with what I had on hand. The flavors go well together, and I loved it in a taco. While it's not a wow 'em dinner party recipe, it's great for a weekday night.

This is exactly the kind of simple, low- fat recipe that I love: can fix easily for the family or serve as a lunch or light dinner for guests. (think patio) I didn't have any jalapeno on hand, but I tossed some cayenne flakes in the corn salsa - perfect.

We LOVED this dish. Any modifications are welcome ... it's all about the marinade and the Cajun seasoning. I also added sides of guac and Wendy's Wicked White Sauce (three parts sour cream; one part mayo; juice of two limes; two dashes of hot sauce).

I added some lemon juice and cilantro to the corn relish.. but, I will say -- this is one of the best dishes I've had in a long time. Also, I added a avocado, garlic, sour cream and lemon juice sauce to the tortilla.. this will be a favorite in my house for years to come!

I had low expectations for this dish based on some of the other reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. Easy and flavorful. Be generous with the seasonings. Corn tortillas instead of flour would also be good.

I've been making this recipe for a couple years. It's simply fabulous and so easy!

This recipe may seem a little bland but it is EASILY saved!!! First off, I took the honey out of the marinade and replaced with Triple Sec, the shrimp really takes in the flavor. I also added some minced jalapeno cause I like alot of heat but it could be easily left out. For the salsa, add LOTS of fresh lime juice!!! A little bit of white vinegar also upped the "tang" factor a little bit. I also added 3 small cloves of fresh garlic, chopped jalapeno, and tabasco; it came out heavenly. Other than that, I'd recommend reducing the marinade quite a bit before drizzling. With just these few simple tweeks, it was really flavorful and delicious; also great with a small dallop of sour cream!

This recipe has potential. I actually added a little dash of Tabasco chipotle into the shrimp maranade-I also added yellow bell pepper. I sauteed over med heat this mixture. I used sundried tomato wraps and also added spanish rice.

the flavors did not really go together, and certainly didn't belong in a taco!

The marinated shrimp was definitely flavorful, but didn't work for me in a soft taco--plus, the corn relish was so dull and the recipe makes way too much relish for how completely dull it is! If I made this again, it would only be the marinated and sauteed shrimp.

I did not like this dish at all. The shrimp was too sweet and the marinade did not taste good. I don't think it can be redeemed. Even the corn relish was pretty flavorless.
