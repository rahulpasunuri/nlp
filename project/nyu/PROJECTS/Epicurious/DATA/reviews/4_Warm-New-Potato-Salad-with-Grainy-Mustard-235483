My favorite potato salad. Very simple, but well-balanced, although I usually increase the dressing with smaller potatoes. Fresh cracked pepper makes a big difference, and I like substituting in cider vinegar for white wine vinegar. Sometimes I sub in scallions for the shallots for a little color.

Delicious!!! Will make this again and again!

Great recipe. I didn't have whole-grain mustard, so I substituted a grainy, spicey brown mustard, and the salad was still a hit. In fact, every one I served it to requested requested the recipe!

This salad is FANTASTIC, and I say that as someone who never eats deli type potato salads. A splash of chardonnay was a welcome addition, while I must say the whole grain mustard makes this dish (don't skip that ingredient!) Made this, intending to do lettuce wraps also, and my husband and I wound up eating the entire batch in a single setting. I will use this all summer to impress guests and reward myself!

I added steamed green beans cut into 2-inch pieces for a little extra crunch, and adjusted the dressing so the proportions were right. I used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and it came out great. Making it again this week for a dinner party.

Loved this! A crowd-pleaser too. I was afraid the raw shallots would be overwhelming but they weren't. I didn't have two kinds of mustard, so I just used one and it was fine. I used cilantro instead of parsley and that was also fine.

What a flavorful way to eat potatoes. Makes me wonder why we don't eat potato salad this way more often. It's far better than the standard version. I think this is going to be a regular in our house. Chopped onion was all I had, and it was fine in place of shallot.

Sorry- senior moment-I guess I should look before posting. Just lets you know how good it is!

Great recipe! I add finely chopped celery for crunch, and prefer white balsamic vinegar. I sprinkle a little vinegar (beyond the amount called for) over the potatoes before adding the dressing. In my experience, the salad tastes best soon after being made- I end up adding extra vinegar and a little salt to any leftovers. Everyone I've ever served it to has loved it.

This salad is awesome, never fails to elicit tons of compliments, with the following changes: Onions are fine if no shallots are handy, and I use white balsamic vinegar instead of the wine vinegar, sprinkling it over the potatoes before adding everything else, at least 2 Tbsp, and probably more. I also add finely sliced celery, as I think it benefits from some crunch. I let leftovers warm to room temp, and usually add a little more salt or vinegar as the spuds seem to steal some of it over time.

delicious and easy (and no mayo!). would definitely make again! used yukon gold potatoes.

Excellent potato salad and goes together real fast if you have all the ingredients on hand. I made exactly as written, but found I would prefer more vinegar, so will double the amount next time. Otherwise perfect.

I roasted the potatoes for this recipe instead of boiling them- the result was fantastic! This is easily my new staple potato side.

Followed recipe. Nice change from traditional potato salad.

A wonderfully simple and tasty preperation. Cooked green beans are a very good addition. especially if you want to limit the number of side dishes.

The dressing is excellent, and makes a great foil to a rich dish. I made this with roasted potatoes instead of boiled, and loved it.

Tasted something similar out to dinner. Found this recipe to try to duplicate. Very good and the bonus - the creaminess is from the olive oil not from mayo! Yay!

Really good, easy and different side dish. Will make again!

I'm a stickler for potato salad. It can't be too creamy, etc. I made this once and since then, it's been on my table every week. It comes together in a flash and is great as leftovers the next day (I've only had that pleasure once).

Very good potato salad -- with new potatoes, fresh parsley, high quality olive oil -- great! Will make this again.

This was a fast, easy, tasty side dish for a weeknight. I used a few small yukon gold potatoes and it was great. I had forgotten to get shallots so I skipped that part, but otherwise followed the recipe to a t. I will make this again!
