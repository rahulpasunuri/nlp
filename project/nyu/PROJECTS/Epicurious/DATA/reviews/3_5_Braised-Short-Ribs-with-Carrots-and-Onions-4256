While good, the flavor was similar to that of pot roast, which takes a lot less time to prepare. I'd pass on this version and look for another recipe that has a bit more excitement.

Love short ribs! Changed some ingredients and the technique in this recipe as follows: Marinated in red instead of white wine. Brown ribs using a stove to oven braising pan. Remove ribs and discard some of the fat. Chopp veggies chunky. Brown in pan w/ leftover juices, stirring up the brown bits. Did not use the 3 3/4 c. beef broth. Nor did I thicken the sauce in the final step. Baked for more like 3 hours. After baking let ribs sit to cool a bit. Remove ribs to seperate bowl. Strain veggies out of broth and set them aside. Put the broth in the freezer for about an hour. While broth is chilling, remove rib meat from the bone and chop chunky. This also makes it possible to remove a little of the fat from the meat. When the fat in the broth has solidified, take broth from freezer and remove the not surprisingly thick layer of fat. Combine the broth, veggies and chopped meat. At this point I froze the whole darn thing. Took with us when we went skiing, heated with a bit of extra broth and served over whole wheat noodles after a day on the slopes. Fed about 6 cold and hungry skiers.

This is a fantastic dish! I make it several times a year, it's that good. I've substituted red wine for the white at times and adds a new and better dimension of flavor. I cook it in my cast iron dutch oven with half the meat the recipe calls for. Ends up using less broth that way too. Still comes out divine!

OMG!! this short rib recipe is the best! The ribs were so moist and tender and the sauce was to die for. I reduced the liquid, strained out the veggies, pureed them and added them back to the sauce before thickening. This is a recipe that would be best made the day before so you can skim off the fat from the sauce. Also, based on the reviews, the size and amount of meat on the short ribs varies all over the place. The ribs I had were pretty small by comparison to others that I have bought. I made the suggested risotto cakes that were very good but also time consuming.

I prepared exactly as directed and they were deligiouc, really wonderful. Unfortunately, one of my dinner guests (whose gall bladder sugery turned out to be imminent) had to excuse herself and go home midway through the meal. May be too rich for some people to tolerate.

This was good, but I much prefer a red-wine base, more like that in the recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=106096

I would make it again, but I would halve the number of ribs and it would be plenty for 6 anyway. We ate two apiece. Maybe mine were unusually meaty/large, but dealing with the bulk was a real pain: four containers to marinate, so I doubled or tripled the marinade so there would be enough to go around (I was afraid the red pepper would overpower the rest of the gravy but the gravy was delicious-I didn't strain either); couldn't fit all the ribs into two roasting pans; wouldn't fit into the large Le Creuset either. I had to work in batches, and there's a ton for the freezer.

This was delicious, very tender, cuts with a fork. I served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli. The gravy is wonderful, I have leftover. I will use it tomorrow with grilled chopped steak and potatoes.

Acutally added some Coors at the end & cooked it for a couple minutes, turned out really tastey.

ABSOLUTLEY WONDERFUL!! This was my first attempt at short ribs and I can't imagine preparing them any other way. The meat was so tender and flavorful, and quite easy to prepare. I'll definitly make this for may family again.

I fudged a bit; I would rate these ribs at about 3.5. I've been making them every since the recipe appeared in B.A. I've used beer instead of wine, played fast and loose with the vegies, and in general, made a mockery of the recipe. No matter what I do, though, they are superb! I serve them with mashers, and I don't strain the gravy either. Try a little sour cream mixed with horseradish and dry mustard as a compliment to the meat itself.

This dish was heavenly. The meat literally fell off the bone and was like butter. I did not strain out the pieces of carrot, celery and onion and liked the texture they gave to the sauce.

I told my kids to be sure and be home for dinner. After all it took two days to make. told them we were having short ribs. (They are used to baby back pork, fall off the bone) These were not, they were tough and stringy. However, the gravy was good, along with mashed potatoes. These should be cooked for 3 hours, not 2, and, if I were to make them again I would only do it for the gravy and throw away the meat and serve the gravy with prime rib or a good roast.

TREMENDOUS!! I "had" a number of Short Rib recipes that I threw out,after making this one. Don't change anything! So it takes awhile...figure a way to use your time better,you won't be sorry.

This is the best recipe for short ribs I have ever had. I make it at least once a month and it seems to get better and better. The only draw back is the length of time - not a spur of the moment type dish.
