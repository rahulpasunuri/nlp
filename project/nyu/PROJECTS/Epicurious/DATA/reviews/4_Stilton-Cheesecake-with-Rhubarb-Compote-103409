This is exceptional. Every time I serve it, my guests rave. It also keeps well and seems to be better after a few days.

This was as good as others reported. One of several desserts for my big party. Gone in a flash!. Crust did not cut well, though. Maybe a different crust next time.

Absolutely amazing! Thank you! I tried the cheesecake at Notables the other day and it was wonderful. I love blue cheese and Stilton so I had to attempt to make it! It was easy to make and absolutely delicious!

After reading the reviews for this Stilton Cheescake, I would agree with the ones who rave about it. I made it for a group wine tasting and everyone asked for the recipe. I do think that those who didn't like it either don't like Stilton or else didn't make it right. Chef Michael Noble just recently opened his own restaurant in Calgary, Alberta, "Notables" and I had this cheesecake there - my husband and I both thought we had died and gone to heaven it was soooooooooo good. If you are ever in Calgary make a point of dining at his restaurant, you won't be disappointed.

I am about to make this cake for the second time for a dinner party. The cake is light and funky; it puts guests into a poetic frame of mind not achievable from standard desserts. People tend to remember where they were when they ate Stilton redeemed by rhubarb. And it's super easy to make. I substituted Deborah Madison's nut crust for the shortbread: Ambrosial.

I tried this recipe last week. I love Stilton and Rhubarb and thought that this might be a great match. My wife does not like Stilton. I made the recipe without changing anything. It was great, the cheescake had a great consistancy however the Stilton was a little strong. I would probably cut back just a little on the amount of cheese next time. However even those who did'nt really like strong cheeses liked it as long as they had some of the rhubarb compote with each bite. The compote really adds to this recipe!

I was excited to find this recipe last week and was planning when would be a good time to make it when my darling boyfriend sprung it on me as a Valentine's surprise :-) As a huge blue fan I loved it, but did find it intense (in a good way). I was planning to take other reviewers' advice and make a walnut crust but the boy made the recipe as is and I was actually very impressed with the shortbread crust-- it was one of the most standout aspects. The rhubarb was amazing and could be eaten by itself, but the beauty here is how well everything works together. Loved it but next time need to share with a crowd--I had a whole cake to myself!

I tried the Stilton Cheesecake last night, to mixed reviews. I was hoping for a stronger taste, something that I could serve as an appetizer or part of a cheese course - something like the baked bries in fruit sauces you sometimes see at restaurants. This is most definitley a dessert. As it is, I liked it enough, but not good enough to justify putting $17/pound cheese into it. I still like the idea, and might experiment with it a bit more. Thanks!

Fabulous! Just wonderful served at room temperature. Wonderfully creamy and decadent. Not cloyingly sweet like many cheesecakes. Rhubarb port compote is delicious and helps cut through the richness of the cheesecake. Caveat: only bleu cheese, cheesecake and rhubarb lovers will appreciate this dish. Also, I suggest preparing guests ahead of time. The Stilton flavor might turn some tasters off if they aren't advised of the unusual flavors ahead of time. Only need a very small amount to be satisfied. Made into 2" individual cheesecakes. This size was more than enough for one person.

I made this recipe for a cocktail party and it got rave reviews. Deciding how long to bake the cake was a challenge, though, since the recipe said "1, hours" (a misprint?). After one hour it was clearly not done so I eyeballed it after that. I think the total oven time was 1.5 hours.

Remarkable! The tartness of the rhubarb compote off sets the richness of this creamy delight. I could not find stilton in my locale and substituted Danish blue cheese. This is a definite do again recipe!

I can't say enough good things about this recipe. I've never had a dessert almost bring me to tears like this did because it was so incredible. Every single person at my dinner party asked for a piece to go - and it was very hard for me to part with the leftovers. I can't say enough how wonderful this was, especially if you don't like really sweet desserts. I recommend having a glass of riesling dessert wine with this as well - the sweetness of the wine was a nice foil to the almost savory flavor of the cheesecake. I can't help but say don't pay any attention whatsoever to the other reviewers who made changes or who didn't like it - I think they're used to the typical American sweet cheesecake with cherry topping, and that kind of person just won't appreciate the truly wonderful dessert this is. I've made a lot of desserts in my time and this one easily claimed the title of the best dessert I've ever made or eaten in any restaurant.

Makes a great appetizer. I used a high quality blue cheese instead of stilton, reduced the sugar in both crust and filling, and made two cakes in small (6") springform pans. These wedges pack a punch! Place the sauce alongside and it is beautiful on a buffet table.

I was not impressed, although I really wanted to like this cheese cake, given my love for both stilton and cheese cake. I also gave it to five friends to sample, all of whom agreed--great texture, strange flavor (too strong).

Excellent with a few modifications. I made a half walnut half zwieback crust -- don't like shortbread crust with cheesecake. Also, I (like the reviewer from 4/8/2001) was "lucky" to find the flavored (blueberry, lemon, strawberry) stilton at my local Costco. I had originally purchased the chese trio for serving guests over the holidays. Before setting it out on the buffet, I took a nibble. Yuck! I like stilton, but the flavored stilton is horrible. Instead of chucking the $8.00 cheese trio, I put it to work in this recipe -- the result was amazing. Note: I did have to extend the cooking time by 20 mintues because the middle was not cooked.

Excellent taste and texture and simple recipe. Had to use frozen rubarb in the compote and it still had a lovely flavour. I would suggest letting your guests know how unique it really is before they taste it. Otherwise it just tastes like a really good cheesecake and they miss the whole point. The Stilton adds indistinguishable distinctive flavour but most palates would not figure came from this strong cheese. The port is also an excellent addition to this recipe.

Wondering if this is the cheesecake that is used by the chef at Catch in Calgary. A friend had it there and said what she loved about it is that it was fluffy. I would love hear suggestions regarding how to alter this recipie, (with what...a little flour?) so that it 'fluffs' up a bit. I think I will be making it with a walnut crust as many others have suggested.

This is a distinctive not sweet cheesecake perfectly complemented by the rhubarb compote- and a very pretty presentation.

Although a bit time consuming, this dish is heaven on a plate. Find the VERY BEST Stilton you can, that makes a huge difference! Our dinner guests couldn't stop raving!!!

I was so disappointed! Being made into a cheesecake seems to bring out the worst in Stilton. All but a strange "decayed" taste is lost. The cake isn't sweet enough either. It tastes more like the cheese course than dessert. The compote was o.k., though.

This is just plain wonderful; a thick New York style cheesecake with tang of stilton - great. Change the topping if you like.

Rating: 3
This is an interesting dessert but I think that it would be even better with a pecan or walnut crust with some walnut oil - the shortbread crust didn't seem to add anything to the dish. As for the rhubarb compote, I'll be making it again and again for many different uses.

outstanding, I served it with a Roasted Pine nut, rhubarb and Red Peppercorn confit, infused with ginger.

I also have eaten this cheesecake at Diva and am really excited to have found the recipe. I have never met anyone who did'nt like it and it is somewhat of a legend in this city.

This dish was excellent. What a pairing! And unique too. I served it at a neighbourhood party and it was a hit!! I made it again with cranberry topping instead and it was a great pair too.

I have eaten this at 'DIVA at the MET', and it is truly glorious!!! I have been raving about it ever since. Imagine how thrilled I was to find the recipe at Epicurious!!!

This recipe is amazing. I have tried different variations of this. If you are lucky you can find flavored stilton (lemon, blueberry, strawberry) which are sweet. I generally make this without the compote using a flavored stilton and it is fantastic. Top it with real, homemade whipped cream (very lightly sweetened) and fresh fruit.

There was only one serious problem with this cake; it was addicting and it was rich enough to prevent us from eating as much of it in one sitting as we desired! Incredible!

Well I thought this was going to be a real winner, but I have to say was a little dissapointed. I guess you could maybe use more stilton, I couldn't taste it as much as I would have liked. I didn't use the base out of this recipe, I suggest you try a digestive biscuit base with butter, it sets very solid and is just the right consistency. This was a very rich cheesecake! However the rhubarb compote, "oh my god!!", this was wonderful, so very very easy to make and was a great compliment to most cheesecakes I would think!! If you don't like rhubarb, you could always serve the stilton cheesecake with a dash of quince paste at the side with a nice glass of port. So its not all bad!

Mike - what were your questions? I'm not sure they were for me, but I'm the cook from Toronto. BTW, graham cracker crust does work as does longer cooking & cooling of wheat crust.

Great dish, but, I would like to ask the cook from toranto to give us the suggested changes her newspaper got from the restaurant. Please contact us or give us an E-Mail address. It's not fair to tempt us like that. Thanks in advance.

Amazing! Incredibly well received by friends with discerning palates. One guest, who had gasped in horror at hearing 'stilton', gave it a try and polished it off. I went a little easy on the stilton, baked the crust longer to ensure it was not soggy, and served it with the tawny port that I used in the compote. I'm already getting requests to make it again!

Help please....This sounds wonderful, however, I am wondering at what point during the meal this should be served? Appetizer, dessert? Also a wine pairing suggestion would be appreciated. I had an appetizer that may be similar to this at the Riviera Grill in Houston, a layered Fig and Stilton terrine, it was fabulous. Thank everyone.
