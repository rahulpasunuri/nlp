I decided to make them like regular muffins and not upside down, which may have been the reason the muffins looked a little like a conehead? But otherwise that they tasted really good!

The favor was wonderful but the cooking time was much too long and when I took them out they were almost burnt and had to be thrown in the trash. Either cook at 350 or cook no more than 18-20 min. Took a long time to prepare.

hmmm, really average. i followed the reviewers instructions below this except for omitting the nutmeg and chopping the cranberries (i floured and added whole). i should have added orange zest but didn't have any. the muffins are edible but not special.

After reading the mixed reviews of this recipe and knowing I basically wanted a cranberry muffin, nothing fancy, I simply mixed all ingredients together. (no heating cranberries, melting sugar, putting them on the bottom, etc) I chopped the cranberries in the processor and folded them in at the end to avoid pink batter. The muffins turned out great, even had that nice sugary crust on top. I put them in muffins papers to avoid the whole stuck on thing.

Really disappointing! Was looking for a fresh cranberry muffin--this eliminates all the fresh plumpness from the berries. Plus the nutmeg was an odd taste addition, PLUS the cooking time was too long. Now what do I serve Xmas morning?!

Wow these are really great muffins. It was too easy, one thing I changed was added just a tiny bit of water when cooking the cranberries.

Uninspired! Overly sweet muffins smothered with what looked and tasted like CANNED cranberry sauce! Not worth the effort.

I love this recipe. Can't wait to use it again this holiday season. No probs with the recipe instructions. Great dish to bring to a gathering! Z

the cranberry part is too sweet, and the muffin part is quite bland.

I thought this was the worst recipe I have ever tried! The cranberries stuck to the bottom of the muffin tin despite thorough greasing. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone! It was way too time consuming to boot!

I followed the other reviewers' advice . . . I stirred the butter into the warm cranberry mixture, added about 1/2 cranberries to flour mixture, filled the muffin cups about 2/3 full, added a layer of leftwover cranberries to muffin cups, then topped with remaining batter. The muffins were moist and delicious! No sticking to the muffin tin.

The recipe was good, although I added some orange zest to the batter, put the cranberries in the middle, and added some quick struesel...It got raves and no sticking. :)

I think this a great recipe and I've never had any trouble with it at all. It is a perfectly delightful fall treat and always receives rave reveiws from friends. I have made these muffins every year during the season ever since you printed the recipe years ago.

I liked this recipe and have also recieved rave reviews from friends. I loved the mixed textures and the tangy zip of the cranberries. My muffins did stick, but this recipe is enjoyable mixed as previous cooks suggested.

I found the muffin part of this recipe very good, nice crumbly texture. I also had the cranberries stuck in the muffin pan. Next time I'll mix the berries in. Thanks Lauren for the feedback!

The first time I made this, the cranberries stuck to the bottom of the muffin pan. The second time, I mixed the cranberries in the batter instead of "upside-downing" them. Much better! They were less messy and had a more even flavor.

I used buttermilk ( a little more than 1 cup) and found these delicious. I have made them several times and they have always turned out well. The only problem I have is not eating the whole dozen by myself!!

I love cranberries but hated this recipe. The muffin texture was dry and the cranberries were way to sweet. I would suggest less sugar, but there are so many better recipes I won't bother to fix this one.

I'm a cranberry fan and loved this recipe. Others were not wild about it. There is a lot of cranberry flavor for those who really like cranberry. I had to add 1/4 cup of water to the sugar and cranberry mix on the stove. I just couldn't get enough juice out of my carnberries to bring it to a boil.
