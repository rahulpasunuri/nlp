Good comfort food. As Hubert's suggested for possibilities, I went heavier on the veg. And dear cook in LA, salt would have been your misusage/handling since there was no amount suggested.

Lots of time to prepare. Chose to allow potates to roast open for the last hour. Seemed salty and I followed the receipe exactly

Wasn't able to find juniper berries, and didn't use lamb because one of the guests doesnt eat it. Everyone really liked it. Surprised that it does t have you brown the meats first, etc. but the technique uses almost no fat except that in the meat and is still quite flavorful.
