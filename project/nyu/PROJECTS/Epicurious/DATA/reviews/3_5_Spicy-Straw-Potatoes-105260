Great and easy potatoes that my family asks for over and over.

I changed the recipe a tad. I added cheddar cheese, sour cream, and chopped green onion on the top. Yum. I also tried it with horseradish sauce. Yum. (I use 2 parts sour cream to one part horseradish). Ok, I like just about anything with french fries. It's not gourmet, but my gourmand 3 year old loves it! She won't stay out of them!

This is a very good recipe for a variation on it, try using some Tony's and throw in some extra cayenne pepper. I have done this several times and it is always a big hit.
