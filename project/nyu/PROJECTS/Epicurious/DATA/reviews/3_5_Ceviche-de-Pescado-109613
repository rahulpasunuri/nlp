This recipe is delicious. I used flounder, omited parsley (because I don't like it), doubled the cilantro, and used 1/2 the onions suggested. I couldn't find aji amarillo so I used a habañero as another reviewer suggested (thanks!). I ended up using about 1/2 of it without any of the seeds. I also ended up adding more salt. This was a delicious recipe! I didn't do the corn/sweet potato/lettuce route, and this recipe is amazing just as-is.

SO happy that people like this dish, Im Peruavian so you guys can be jelous haha just kidding, well just to say that the word can be write in different ways and all are correct: -Ceviche -Cebiche -Sebiche Well and also to say that here in Peru we eat the dish very raw beacuse the original peruvian cebiche must be eat raw, the fish must have contact with the lime juice just for 3 minutes.

SKIP THE BRINE... no worries about that step. That step is very unnecessary but I still give it 4 Forks because the ingredient proportions are right on. As I am of a Peruvian background, I have been lucky enough to eat ceviche of the best calibre - fish caught less than an hour before. Amazing and this recipe is definitely good! If you don't have ají don't worry, I'd recommend a habanero over a jalapeno in replacement. Just use a 1/4 of a habanero! Don't forget to eat it with sweet potato or yucca... goes great and evens out the acid, if one finds this dish too tart. Anyway... yes childhood memories here! Love it!! Oh and by the way, in Peru most people do spell it "ceviche".

I made this for my Peruvian friend for his birthday and he said it was fabulous. I got him to bring me the aji amarillo so it was authentic. We used tilapia because it was the freshest at the market and it was really tasty.

The correct spelling is "cebiche" from the Spanish word for onion 'cebolla' to put down in onions.

Overall, this is a good recipe that I would definitely make again, with some tweaks. I made this dish with jalapeno instead of aji amarillo. I used swai and shrimp, which I did not brine. I used more parsley and cilantro than indicated and used red onion. I did not make the accompanying corn/yuca/etc. The timing on this recipe is unrealistic; it took much longer than 20 minutes for the fish to cure. I expected the shrimp would take longer, and it did. I would not recommend swai for this dish, at least not previously frozen swai. If I made this again, I would only use fresh, never-frozen fish, or maybe just shrimp. I used two smallish jalapeños, and they were not spicy enough for my taste. If you like it hot, use a pepper with higher heat.

Very good ceviche. I strongly recommend you do not brine the fish. It comes out too mushy. The best way to go is to use a good firm fish like snapper and skip the brine.

Really delicious! I made this for Father's Day and my husband loved it. Next time I'll probably put more garlic. I used tilapia, which was perfect and firm. Great recipe and very easy.

This dish was excellent. I made if for a summery dinner party to break up the SAD (seasonal affect disorder) that myself and some of my midwestern friends had been experiencing. I marinated over night and that really did the trick. I will definitely make this recipe again, but next time I will probably double the jalapeno to make it good and spicy. This version did not have enough kick for me.

exceedingly delicious and equally easy to prepare. i made it with halibut (no fresh sole available) and this worked quite well for the dish, as it is a firm fish and therefore well suited for ceviche.

I added a chopped up red pepper to add some color and it was delicious

In my humble opinion (and I just about live on ceviche), you should avoid corvina, flounder, etc. Any soft- fleshed fish such as these will not hold up to the rigorous "cooking" that it takes to make an excellent ceviche. If you use one of the soft- fleshed fishes, you will most likely end up with mush. Instead, try Tilapia, Swordfish, or Red Snapper. Otherwise, this is a good recipe and there are also lots of great riffs on it.

Yum. Used lime juice, didn't have a lot of the rest of the ingredients, but from what I had it was delish.

I had good luck with this recipe using grouper and snapper. I skipped the salt water soak and the fish was very tender. The Key limes sold in most supermarkets are horrible unripe rocks unsuitable for use except for garnish. Ripe Key limes are YELLOW.

I made this with the hope of duplicating the ceviche recipe from a local restaurant chain. I used fresh flounder and real key limes as the other reviewer suggested. The limes gave a somewhat bitter taste, so may use reconstituted lime juice (gasp!). Also the fish wasn't as firm as I would have liked. may try cod or halibut next time, even though they are not really a "native"seafood here. Definitely worth trying again, though.

Delish...only use key lime or Mexican lemon if you can get it instead. That's more like the lemon available in Peru.
