Excellent recipe. Mixed some milk chocolate with the dark(for the kids). Young and old loved it!

Under "wine pairings for this recipe" you list Taylor cooking wine. Seriously? Where are you coming from with this? Most chefs/cooks don't use "cooking" wines in recipes due, in part to the added seasonings. As for actually drinking it-you can't be serious!!!

You can make your own superfine by putting granulated into a blender or spice grinder.

I really wanted to make these but I had to substitute granulated sugar for super fine sugar and the batter came out nicely although it was a little stiff. Further, I added some lemon zest and juice to give it this fresh taste and I am afraid it didn't turn out well. Just stick the recipe. I also used regular chocolate chips instead of cutting it up and I still think they look nice. I don't know, after all my substitutions I am impressed they still came out so well.
