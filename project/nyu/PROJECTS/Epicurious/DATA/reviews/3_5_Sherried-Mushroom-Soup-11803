OK as is, but gets raves with a tweak or two. Added a t. of dried tarragon (absolutely necessary, in my opinion) and about 1 T. dried parsley (no fresh available), as well as a pinch of RPFs (red pepper flakes). This is best when a variety of mushrooms are used. If you have dried shiitakes, by all means use them. When the muchrooms are cooked, chop some about 2/3 and leave 2/3 in large pieces. Add chopped reconstituted dried 'shrooms if you have them, along with the strained liquid. Hey! it isn't an exact science! :)

Good basic recipe. I have a Time-Life book with a terrific mushroom soup recipe in it, but my books are all packed in storage, and I was looking for a close approximation. Used dry sherry. Used dry cepes, as well as a bag of Trader Joe's frozen mushrooms (shitake, field and shimeji abalone). Split fat between butter and olive oil. Used more onion, and substituted half-and-half for cream. The smell alone as it cooks is worth it! A simple swirl of cream and a snip of fresh chives is a good presentation.

I added chopped, fresh rosemary to give it more flavor. Then, at the end I added whole cream to give it the body and flavor it needed. Otherwise it is too thin and flavorless.

This was very good, and seemed well-liked at my dinner party for which I needed a good hearty fall soup that was not too heavy for a multi-course meal. I used vegetable broth and crimini mushrooms, but otherwise followed the recipe. I think it has the potential to be even better with some experimentation such as adding different herbs (perhaps tarragon?)

i would make this recipe again, solely because my wife enjoyed it. perhaps i am missing something, but to my taste, the soup was not terribly distinctive of flavorful. sorry.

I doubled this recipe and served it as a first course for 4 at a small dinner party. It got lots of praise! I used crimini mushrooms and dry sherry instead of cream sherry (which I don't like). Rather than using unsalted butter, and low-salt broth, I used the less-expensive, easier-to-find salted versions, but skipped the "season with salt to taste" step at the end.

We really loved the soup, but there wasn't nearly enough of it! I wish the Epicurious site had a scaling feature like another recipe site I visit. It makes it so very easy to make more without all the bother.

I love this recipe. It is so easy and tastes so good. I agree with another reviewer that this makes 4 servings. I prefer green onions for this dish but it really doesn't matter. Very quick and simple.

Absolutely loved this! I used 8 ozs. sliced mushrooms and followed rest of recipe, omitting the S&P at the end. Did as previous reviewer mentioned and added a splash of sherry just before serving. Delicious! KIMBER

This was very tasty. I didn't have cream sherry, so I used regular sherry, then used a bit of light cream right before adding the broth.

Easy and quick. Loved by all who've tasted it. I like using Sherry instead of Cream Sherry though both are good.

This was wonderful and simple. I added 5 dried (reconstituted in boiling water) shitake mushrooms,chopped them fine in a food processor along with 1/2 of the regular mushrooms.I also added the water the shitakes were reconstituted in (very shitaky flavored!) which added a wonderful wild mushroom taste to this soup, making it a 4 fork recipe.Agree with adding parmesan as another reviewer added in serving. I think this actually makes 4, not 2 servings.

Very good. I used shiitake mushrooms which may not be the best choice; next time will try brown or porcini. Would use 8 oz. mushrooms; ended up with all mushrooms and no liquid in bowl. It might benefit from a dash of sherry immediately before serving

The sherry in the broth brought out a good mushroom flavor but was strongly onion. I would use less shallots and make it a little simpler. I also added a touch of parmesean cheese when served.

This was delicious! Elegant and healthy. I used my Cuisinart which made the preparation easy and fast. I used the 2 mm blade to slice the mushrooms very thin. I used Pacific Mushroom Broth from Trader Joe's instead of the chicken broth to intensify the mushroom. I didn't have shallots or Cream Sherry on hand but scallions and Pale Dry Sherry worked really well. I added more sherry than the recipe called for and used the greens of the scallion finely minced in the cuisinart for garnish. I'll be making this again.

Very good. I didn't find the shallots over-powering at all.

The taste of the shallots was overpowering in the recipe. It tasted like onion soup that just happened to have mushrooms in it. I think the recipe has potential if the shallots was reduced to 1 small instead of 3 large.

Fabulous. Delicious. I improvised a bit by using a variety of mushrooms and made it vegetarian-friendly by substituting mushroom broth for chicken stock.
