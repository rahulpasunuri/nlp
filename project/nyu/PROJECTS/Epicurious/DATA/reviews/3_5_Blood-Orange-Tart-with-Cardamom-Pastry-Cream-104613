Disappointing. Cardamom pastry cream does not get thick enough to slice, even spending over-time in the fridge. Had to freeze it for a bit to allow me to cut it, which while not ruining it did turn it into more of an ice cream-esque tart with oranges on top. A lot of fuss and effort for a subpar recipe, in my book. If you're determined to make it I would use your own tried-and-true pastry cream recipe and be sure to give it ample time to set up in the fridge.

Tried to make the recipe as described, and the cream turned out really poorly. The cardamom gives it a strange flavor. 5 yolks is an overkill, 2 whole eggs would have been just fine. Had to trash the cream, and make another batch using a simple vanilla pastry cream recipe. The crust is great, however, and the idea of blood orange + apricot preserve is also a hit. I refrigerated the crust dough overnight (it is better than refrigirating just for a few hours), then rolled it out really thin. The amount of crust dough is actually enough to make two thin 10 inch crusts. I also added brandy to the apricot preserve. With all above modifications this was a hit. With the second crust I made another tart with raspberries and blueberries and powdered sugar on top. My guests loved both!

I have made this tart three times. Once with peaches and twice with strawberries instead of oranges. The first time I made it the pastry cream was runny as other reviewers described. The second and third time I used a solid 1/2 cup of flour and a bare two cups of milk for the cream. I also used 1 tablespoon of ground cardamon and trippled the vanilla. It was fantastic! The cream was not runny at all and stayed nicely solid, even after cutting.

I loved the flavor of this tart, but found the cream to be a little runny when sliced.In my second go-around making the tart I added one teaspoon of unflavored gelatin, that had already been dissolved in two tablespoons of cold water for 10 minutes, right after I removed the milk and cardomom from the stove. The first step in the pastry cream part. It turned out beautifully and the pastry cream held up alot better.

This was a custard tart that had blood oranges on TOP. The custard had a great flavor with the cardamon but the oranges on top made it impossible to cut. I would try something smalled like rasberries.

On the whole I was rather disappointed with this recipe; I followed the recipe to the letter (as I always do first time around), and have the following suggestions: use a different pastry recipe - any good sweet, short-crust pastry will do, I found the given one to be rather tasteless and heavy; leave out the vanilla extract in the patisserie cream, or halve the amount - it masks too much of the cardamom flavour; segment the oranges so that the tart is easier to cut, and if you have the patience slice the segments into thin sections so that they lie flat. I would also try to make a thicker patisserie cream - this may well have been my failing, but the one I made was to thin for its intended use, IMHO. I am glad that I tested this out at a Sunday lunch and did not produce it as a dinner party desert.

I found this tart very easy to make - simply follow the directions and you will end up with a beautiful tart that tastes delicious. I brought this to a Christmas party and received tons of raves from all attendees

I made this tart because it sounded so unusual, and the flavor certainly was. However I found it to be difficult to made (and I make tarts all of the time) and not worth the hassel. I would not recommend it.

I would like to try this tart for a dinner party so would like to prepare the dessert a day ahead. Can I do it without spoiling the taste?

This is a fantastic tart! The cardamom cream was out of this world. The first time I made it was with navel oranges. Since then (4 more times!) I made it with blood oranges. The crust and pastry cream are great.

i was too lazy to make the crust, so i just used a frozen deep-pie crust instead...turned out fine. i found the cardamom a little bit too strong for my taste, so i think i would only leave the pods in for 5 minutes instead of 15! (or leave'em out entirely) i also used real vanilla beans for this, giving that 'speckled' look. i used both blood and regular navel oranges (3 each), the contrast between the orange/yellow and the red made the tart look simply AMAZING! (my stove was too powerful, i almost made curdled eggs instead of custard.) :)

I haven't tried this yet but I was wondering if anyone has tried it with a different fruit?

I used this recipe as a base for a modified fruit and cream tart and it was fabulous. The crust recipe is terrific as is the pastry cream, even without the cardamom added to it. I'll definitely use this as the base recipe for all kinds of fruit tarts in the future.

This recipe was a big hit with my supper club. I went for the cardamom in the pastry cream and I think the very subtle flavor made the dish distinct. I sectioned the oranges with knife and removed all the tough outer skin, then fanned them out on the tart. It made for easier cutting, but I must say that next time I will chill this longer. The pastry cream was oozing out each slice. Still it's a delicious recipe. One last note, I added a small amount of hot water to the preserves, otherwise they were too thick.

I was too cowardly to put in the cadamom pods - when I was crushing them, they just didn't look (or smell) like something I wanted in my creme patisiere. I substituted Grand Marnier and it worked extremely well. Everyone loved it. I would make it again when blood oranges are in season.

Excellent! As Gary mentioned it was difficult to cut with the whole slices of orange on top. Next time I will cut the oranges into small pieces, toss with the apricot jam and then losely pile them on top of the tart, it will be easier to cut and eat.

I'm adding this to my regular repertoire of desserts... the combination of the citrus and cardamom is as satisfying as it sounds. It's beautiful to serve, and everyone raved about it. If blood oranges aren't available, I'd readily substitute small navel oranges, as suggested. (One suggestion: arranging the orange slices atop the cream in closely-arranged "spokes" instead of concentric circles would make slicing easier, and neater.)

My guests were blown away. The cardamom flavor in the cream makes the dish, and it is abslolutely worth it to track down the blood-oranges. I served it after a Curry dinner, and it went perfectly.
