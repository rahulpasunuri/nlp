Awesome summertime dish. I have made this into margarita chicken (realized my rum was SO old it had mold, yikes) and subbed tequila. Love this with the grilled lime squeezed over the top. The flavors really come out the longer it marinades, too. I ususlly make my own mint syrup and keep extra on hand to sweeten tea or for mojitos. SO good.

Been making this dish since the recipe came out in 2004...love it!!! And don't skip the grilled pineapple to accompany it! YUMMY!

I liked this well enough, but my husband dubbed it "Chicken a la Crest." Maybe it's because I used homemade syrup from the mint in my garden, or because I clipped the fresh mint just minutes before using it in the marinade, but the minty freshness was a little overwhelming. Commercially-made syrup and not quite as fresh store-bought herb might have toned things down a bit. Definitely don't forego the grilled lime squeeze to finish. That really helps balance out the sweetness and mint from the marinade.

I've made this recipe many times on the grill, but it was pouring rain tonight so seared the chicken in a pan and then finished it with 25 minutes in a 400 degree oven. Came out great (after 24 hrs of marinating).

This was excellent - and so easy. Served with mixed grilled vegetables. A tasty summer meal.

Yummy. Marinated for over 24hours. Made my own mint syrup and will use extra for Mojitos! The grilled limes were a surprise-warm and juicy on the chicken!Hubby loves this one.

I only marinated my chicken for about 3 hours but still it was extremely moist and flavorfull. The marinade really sunk in. I served it with corn salad and more mojitos to drink. Delicious!

This recipe was wonderful. I took the advice of the reviews from the website and marinated the chicken over-night. I would say it is a must to get the flavors. I used leftover chicken and limes on a salad the next night and it was just as good. I loved the grilled limes, will have to do that more often with other recipes as well.

This is my new go-to grilled chicken recipe for the summer. I make my own mint syrup from the recipe on this site (make extra & use it to sweeten iced green tea). I also use a whole chicken cut in pieces. Once, I marinated for 3 days (due to a schedule snafu) and the chicken was even better!

My husband and I make this every summer! It is one of our favorite dishes. We also let our chicken marinate at least 24 hours. I have trouble finding the mint sauce, so I substitue a mixture of simple syrup and 3 or 4 drops of peppermint essential oil. It really as a wonderful minty end note that we love.

Mint syrup may be hard to find at the grocer, but any coffee shop has tons of it. I went into my local coffee shop and bought 6 tbls. It cost $1.10 and saved me the trouble of having to locate it and having a bottle of the stuff sitting around the kitchen.

I loved the chicken! The only problem is the time to marinate the chicken was not long enough, in my opinion. I tried 24 hours & the flavor was great.

I made this recipe again over the weekend. I've made it three or four times now. It always gets rave reviews, so when I read some of the poor reviews I am a little confused by the inconsistency of them and wonder why the differences in opinion. I usually let the chicken "steep" in the marinade overnight and cook it for dinner the next day. Perhaps the 24 hours in the marinade makes the difference? My chicken has been moist and tremendously flavorful. To those willing to try agian, leave it in the marinade over night. My experience with the recipe has given consitently delicious results.

Also, to add. I marinated the chicken for a whole day because I was too busy to cook it. Perhaps that helped with penetrating the chicken more and I used very thin slices of chicken.

This was a wonderfully versatile dish to make. It was a lot of work dealing with the fresh mint because I had to make the mint syrup from scratch. If you do a search using Epicurious for "Minted syrup" they have a very simple recipe for it. Perhaps this was part of the secret to this recipe, VERY fresh ingredients. I agree with the poster above that the grilled limes are a must! Not only is the marinade delicious with chicken, but it is phenomenal with tofu. It is difficult to maintain the cohesiveness of the tofu, but if it is cut into small square, it is much easier to grill. A++++

I made this for a large Labor Day party and used boneless skinless chicken breasts that the butcher pounded thin for me. It was great. The leftovers also made a FANTASTIC tarragon chicken salad (the chicken chopped up with fresh tarragon, mayonnaise, lime juice from the leftover grilled limes, and a touch of tarragon mustard).

This recipe was wonderful. The juice from the grilled limes is a must.

I really enjoyed this dish. I used corn syrup with some mint extract because it was hard to find the mint syrup. The key to this dish is the rum infused limes. They're surprisingly juicy and really bring out the mojito flavor.

This dish was absolutley wonderful. Was a bit skeptical at first and was making it for a group (never a good idea to make something new for a group, I know) but EVERYONE loved this so mucht hat I didn't have enought. Everyone wanted seconds.

I tried using the "best of fryer"...it was good, but the breasts were by far and away the best. I thought that the marinade was very simple to make & quite tasty. I didn't have time to hunt down mint syrup so I just made a simple syrup with a mint infusion. I thought that would be handy to keep around for mojitos at a later date! My guests loved it!

This marinade was alot of work with so so results. I would much rather just drink a mojito and have plain grilled chicken! I was disappointed because I was sure with the amount of ingredients in the recipe that the chicken would turn out to be very flavorful. Boy was I wrong! So save yourself the trouble and just make a pitcher of mojitos!

I wonder if the previous reviewer actually tried this recipe... if so, I am puzzled by the "loads of flavor" part. This made some of the most bland, tasteless chicken I've ever had the misfortune of eating. My guests tried a bite, then politely requested some barbecue sauce for dipping. If not for my top quality organic chicken, I think this would have been completely inedible.

I think this is a wonderful recipe. Loads of flavor. I bought the mint syrup at Starbucks...I think it's important to soak the lines in the rum....and then grill then and squeeze over the chicken right before eating. I have made for 2 dinner parties and everyone raved about it!!

Just drink the mojitos - no need to spill it on your food. Plenty of decent marinades out there that would COMPLEMENT the cuban cocktail (like mojo).

You guys, this is awful. for the REAL DEAL, do a search on epicurious for "mojito marinade" and you will see a dinosaur bbq recipe. that chicken is SOOOOOOOOOOO good - on the grill - in the oven - wherever. i've bbq'd chicken thighs with it, i've oven roasted a whole chicken in it. that marinade is to die for.

Of all the chicken marinades I've used, this was one of the more disappointing ones. It certainly wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything to rave about. Plus, I only had green mint syrup, and the green tinge it gave my chicken kind of ruded me out--but that was my fault. I only made this for my husband and I, so the green tint wasn't a huge deal.

I made this dish to raves for a dinner party along with some of the salads in the same issue. I made one change on purpose, using skinless, boneless breasts, and one out of necessity - because I couldn't find mint syrup, I microwaved the equivalent amount of mint jelly. My only complaint is that you don't need quite that much marinade for that much chicken, so either make more chicken or cut the marinade down to avoid wasting all that lime and rum. But in terms of taste, we all loved it and everyone wanted the recipe!

I have never had a mojito drink, but found the chicken to be very good. It looked nice, and was a bit different. It wasn't the greatest meal I have ever made, but it was simple and different.

It came out looking just like the photo, but the taste was a lot blander than expected. It was basically a waste of good rum. I used drumsticks and thighs along with breasts for a little variety, so that helped. The only reason I would bother to make it again is to use up the bottle of mint syrup I bought.

Nothing really wrong with this, just a disappointing lack of flavor. I agree, the drink was better than the dinner. The marinade didn't really seem to punch through the chicken, though the crispy skin was tasty. Maybe removing skin and marinating longer would help, but I give up on it. Not worth the trouble.

This is one of those I threw something together and missed recipes. This was utterly disgusting. I will stick with the drink!

I love to drink mojitos, but was disappointed with this. I think I'll stick to the drink version.

This was very good, and looked great as well. I would definitely marinate the chicken overnight next time - we did it all day but it could have used a little more time. Don't skip on the grilled lime step, either - it was a nice punch of flavor. Also, though we normally take the skin off chicken, don't do it here - it caramelizes and adds to the presentation. Served with a grilled corn salad and rice. We'll definitely make this again...a great excuse to have a mojito!
