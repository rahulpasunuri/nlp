We make this alot during the winter. It's a strong flavor, quick to make, but light. I add rice noodles that I've pan fried, but that's just a variation. I do play with it alot though - adding different veggies and things, but the broth and the vinegar make the base the best. It's definitely an "I don't feel like cooking but want something really tasty" dinner.

This is a great quick soup! I used leftover prime rib and added cillantro as another cook suggested. I think it is the ginger that really makes this soup though. My son loves it too.

This is a mild little soup. I made it with bok choy because I needed to use it up, and I didn't have any leftover beef, and it tasted lovely. Keep in mind that the flavor drivers here are the rice vinegar, the sesame oil, and the ginger. Don't leave out any of these flavors or you'll be disappointed. I also added cilantro per a previous reviewer's suggestion, which contributed a lot to the flavor! It's easy to make... however long it takes you to heat the broth is basically how long it'll take you to cook it. Cut up the veggies and ginger while you're heating it.

This soup was very quick to make (you can do all your chopping while the broth heats up, and by the time it boils, you're essentially finished!). The vegetables were crisp and colourful and the broth was flavourful. Instead of pouring it over rice, I added vermicelli noodles as the broth was heating.

I have found that this recipe works as a good base for creativity. Definitely add rice wine (mirin) or sake to the soup, and probably some soy sauce. I've added cilantro to no ill affects, and I tend to leave out the peppers. This is a great recipe for when you want to make a small amount of leftover roast into a meal. I also suspect it would work with fresh cuts of meat---just add them to the broth and let them cook a bit before adding other ingredients.

Made the soup and found it too bland and the sesame oil taste too strong. Added some soy sauce and it was definately better, but I wish I had used the left over beef for hash or sandwiches instead.

This recipe was excellent. It was a quick and unusual way to use leftover roast beef. My boyfriend insists that we use leftovers in this soup instead of in sandwiches, etc. I especially liked it becuase it was FAST and easy to make after work, with few ingredients.

This is a simple and fast recipe for a tasty, very easy to make soup. I used home-made leftover beef, and with lots of rice, this is quite hearty!

Awesome soup! The presentation is colorful with the red bell pepper. The broth has a wonderful flavor. When I purchased the roast beef, I had them slice a little thicker than your typical deli meat, that way the beef didn't fall apart in the soup. This one is definately a keeper!

This was a very quick and easy soup to make. I added a little more water to make more broth and did serve it with eggrolls. I thought it was pretty good and my husband had seconds.
