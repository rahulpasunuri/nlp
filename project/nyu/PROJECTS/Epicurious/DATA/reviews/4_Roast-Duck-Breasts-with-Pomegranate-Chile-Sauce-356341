I made this for friends and it is very good! The sauce is a little time consuming but the duck breasts were so easy. The searing on the skin side really renders the fat. I bought the duck from Whole Foods and 1 package had 4 breasts ($12.99/lb) and I bought 4 packages thinking one per package. I ended up using 2 package as some of the breasts were small but we didn't eat it all.

Really loved this sauce! I agreed that it could have been a little bit less sweet for the duck as it tasted a little more asian style than southwestern. We saved the left overs and plan to make another dish with it. Also, we were unable to find duck breasts (after trying 10 different stores in Manhattan.. who knew?) but used duck legs instead. The preparation was the same, though the cook time was significantly longer (nearly 40 minutes in the oven). It was quite messy to eat and we ended up using our hands like bbq but enjoyed every last bite. Finally, we paired it with this salad and a shiraz which were both great compliments to the dish. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Citrus-Salad-with-Fried-Rosemary-and-Olives-51134440

Loved what the heat of the chili did for this dish, gave it a wonderful depth instead of just a sweet sauce. I happened to have some pomegranate molasses and pomegranate vinegar in my cabinet so I used a combination of the 2 which it seemed to me is where the recipe was headed anyway. The sauce was more than ample and I imagine the leftovers will be wonderful on the lamb we're having tonight. The duck breast came out just perfect, crispy, moist and pink. This was such a tasty meal most definitely will repeat.

A few weeks ago I had duck breast with chile sauce in a well-known Chicago restaurant. It was very good and that prompted me to search for a recipe. I found this recipe and made it for a special dinner with an old friend. I was thrilled - it was better than what I had at the restaurant! I love the addition of the sugar syrup, it adds interest to the flavor profile. I've made this recipe twice now in a one-week period; and I'm sure I'll be making it often in the future. Oh, did I mention it's easy, easy, easy to prepare (an added bonus).

I made this tonight for Valentine's day dinner and it was incredible. Followed the recipe exactly as stated with the exception of removing the seeds from the California chiles. The sauce was so good and the time on the duck was perfect. It was my first time ever preparing duck at home so I actually used a timer to count the cooking time and it was awesome. I will definitely make this again.

This was my first time preparing duck (for Xmas Eve 2011) and it was a big hit. I threw 1tsp of duck fat into the sauce to give it some gloss. Cannot wait to make this again!

This turned out great! Overall, it was a fairly straightforward and delicious dish that I would prepare for company in the future. We followed the recipe to a T with the exception that we omitted the California chiles. In the future, we would be curious to try it with the chiles. We paired this with boiled fingerling potatoes, and it was a nice combination.

This sauce was excellent! I would reduce the stock next time and did have to add arrowroot/cornstarch to thicken it up a bit, but the taste was great!

I have cooked this sauce several times. I prefer to leave out the adoba sauce and chiles. I do throw in a generous amount of blueberries for the last 5 minutes of the sauce. It is very good with the duck. I just like a sweeter sauce with the duck. The base recipe is very good and the duck is great.

This was delicious. The sauce is kind of unexpected as I always associate duck breast with a sweet more refined tasting sauce. This was a sweet (not overly) sauce with a kick and flavor of the Southwest which I did enjoy. Served this with a pecan wild rice pilaf (and added more pomegranate seeds to the rice. Very nice, easy and would do again.

This was my first go at cooking duck and it came out brilliantly! I have problems aquiring some ingedients so the adobo was omitted and replaced with red chillis. I thought that the sauce was too sweet so I added more vinegar and a little lemon juice. I would probably omit the sugar/water stage next time and add a little butter near at the end for some gloss. Husband thought this sauce would go really well with cervena. A huge thumbs up from all the family

The sauce is really good but it has a distinctly barbecue-like flavor. I tend to think of duck as deserving something a little more elegant. It would be AWESOME on pulled pork. I followed another reviewer's recommendation to strain the sauce after blending - very good idea if you want it to be perfectly smooth. The heat is exactly right - not too spicy, just spot-on.

The pomegranate sauce was complex, sweet and tangy with a little heat, and nicely complemented the rich duck. I tried to soak up the sauce with all sides of the duck breast. The recipe was well received by all at dinner.

This sauce is to DIE for... It makes quite a bit of sauce, and was so good that we used it for 2 more meals!! As long as you scrape out most of the seeds in the chiles it's really only a tiny bit spicy - or leave in more seeds and veins if you like it spicier. Duck breasts cooking was about right, although if the breasts are smaller reduce the time by 1 minute or so, or they will be beyond medium rare. Pretty simple to make, oh so yummy, got rave reviews from everyone, and presents beautifully on the plate - a WINNER!!

Really delicious, elegant and fairly easy. Maybe it's my blender, but there were still identifiable pieces of the dried California chiles in the sauce, which I found ruined its texture and people would tend to pick out. So I would recommend straining it before you add in the adobo sauce and balsamic vinegar. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing. Paired it with the wild rice and wild mushroom recipe here. Fantastic!

I made this for a Christmas Eve dinner and it came out wonderfully. I substituted canned chipotle chilis for the dried chilies and it was SPICY, but delicious. Rave reviews from all around the table. Easy enough for a weeknight dinner if you make the sauce the night before.

This was our first time cooking duck, and it was a great success! The duck was flavored extremely well. The sauce was the perfect topping. The only minor adjustment we made to the recipe was to extend the roasting time on the duck breasts; we wanted them less rare and more done. Delicious!

LOVED this sauce! We made it following the recipe exactly and it was excellent!!! Will try it on a seared pork tenderloin next!

I've never made duck before, but this was a great first time recipe. Finding duck was surprisingly hard in the city, apparently its something you must pre-order at a butcher shop. The pomegranate sauce brought out the good flavors in the duck, but when making the 1st part with the sugar, there wasn't enough water, so the sugar crystallized before 8 min. I thought it was little too sweet, so next time I would half the sugar. Also, since I love spicy foods, I doubled the adobe sauce and threw in a jalapeno pepper. Overall - it was very tasty.

Delicious! However, I suggest cooking the pomegranate seeds towards the last part of the sauce reduction (about 20 mins.) Much easier to swallow than raw!

My husband came home from hunting with fresh duck and I had never cooked a duck in my life! I followed this recipe, except for adding the chiles and I cut back on the adobo sauce a little, and it was absolutely FABULOUS! The pomegranate sauce was perfect for the duck. I let the sauce simmer a little longer for a more flavorful sauce. My friends loved it and are looking forward to my husband's next hunt!
