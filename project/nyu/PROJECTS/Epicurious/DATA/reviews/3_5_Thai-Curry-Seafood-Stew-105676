Really tasty and easy, although you could probably reduce the amount of coconut milk & water by half, as there was a ton of broth left over. Flavor-wise, this is a pretty standard Thai dish, there's really nothing unique about it.

Well, I am not the most experienced thai cook but I want that to change so I tried this tonight. As with so many other people on this site I had to do a few substitutions. I made it with shrimp and cubed cod fish and instead of the broccoli slaw I used some spinach and shredded cabbage. The rest I kept the same and must admit we were disappointed with the spice level so I added a finely minced tiny hot pepper to it and a squirt of hot pepper sauce. After that we really enjoyed it. I teamed it up with the jasmine rice with garlic, ginger and cilantro from this site. I would make this again.

This was SO EZ & yummy! I used finely sliced, savoy cabbage instead of broccoli slaw & served the stew over short-grain brown rice. You could use any combo of firm fish and/or shellfish in this stew. I didn't have basil or mussels, but next time I will include them, as I'm sure they will elevate this already delicious stew to a higher level of tastiness. Mmmm mmmm good!

This was fantastic, super easy and inexpensive. I used a pound of little frozen scallops and a pound of mussels. I made my own broccoli slaw by cutting the florets off and shredding the stems. It felt great to actually use the entire head of broccoli. I was out of fish sauce and the lemongrass at the store was all dried out so omitted those. I did add fresh ginger slices and kaffir lime leaves because I had them. I simmered these in the coconut milk and curry paste. I used green curry paste because I think it is better with seafood than red. The one tablespoon was a perfect heat for me - hot but not over powering. I've made other recipes with curry paste that blew my head off. One thing that I think really made a difference - fresh thai basil. I love that stuff. I think this would still be good with fresh cilantro though. The whole meal was made in the time it took to steam the rice. A really successful weekday meal that I will make for guests in the future - thanks Epicurious!

Very spicy, definitely benefits from some brown sugar, and curdles easily. There seemed to be an excessive amt of sauce, so I recommend less liquid, less curry. Just OK.

This was yum, yum, yummy and easy to make. I made some changes to meet my own taste. Added snow peas, subbed clam juice for water. I also used 2 cans of unsweetened coconut milk and 1 can of coco loco (what you use for pina coladas). Definitely not low cal, but a nice blend of sweet and spicy with the curry paste. My guests raved.

I gave this 4 forks for being both yummy and easy. I added some ginger and some brown sugar & halved the curry (so that the kids didn't complain) It was great. Next time I think I'll add some snow peas or other vegetables to make it even more substantial.

This was really great and so very simple. I used green curry instead and doubled the amount of curry. I also added ground red pepper and cilantro at the end. I used Thai basil instead of regular basil. It gave it a more pungent flavor.

I'm sorry to be the party-pooper -- I love curries, but not this one. To me, the sauce tasted mostly like spicy coconut milk. It just didn't have the complexity of a restaurant curry. Maybe it was the brand of curry paste I used (Maesri).

I also used clams instead of muscles and it was really good. This is a very versatile recipe, you could substitute any type of seafood, even chicken. My boyfriend thinks he hates Thai food, I just never mentioned it was Thai and he loved it ;-) It's very quick and easy, too!

This was a great recipe. Easy enough to alter to suit your seafood tastes. I used light coconut milk. The brocolli slaw actually works, great way to sneak in more veggies! Definetely one to repeat!

Outstanding. Easy. For budget nights I make it with shrimp and tofu. Freezes and reheats well.

This recipe deserves 3.5 forks. The curry came out quite beautifully, but it needed both a significant amount of curry paste to really come together, as well as longer than recommended cooking time for more concentrated flavor. On a student budget my seafood options were limited, but shrimp and tilapia worked!

Rating: 1
Sorry to be a dissenter, but this just did not work for us. We really like spicy food, but 1 tablespoon of Thai Curry Paste is way too much. Maybe it is the brand we used, but I had to thin the stew with more water in order to make it even edible. That, of course, thinned out the coconut milk and made it taste watery. Not a repeat for us.

cook asking broccoli slaw made me laugh! broccoli slaw comes pre-packaged at vegetable markets, grocery stores...it is the stalk of peeled broccoli and carrots julienned. just curious what exactly you used as alternativ that allowed the recipe to be "good"? i say, "good" for you!! cooks can be SO creative! last but not least...i make this recipe very often. everyone with i add extra curry for a mit more heat, a tablespoon or so of brown sugar, use cilantro as well as basil and top as garnish a handful of fresh bean sprouts!! enjoy!

I make thai curry all of the time. I'm not sure why, but this was more flavorful than others. I used bay scallops and shrimps, and then also zucchini, green beans, red peppers, and onion.

An outstanding quick Thai Curry. Pulled some Black bass out of the freezer and followed this recipe, substituted the cubed white fish for the seafood called for in the recipe-so good, my husband declares this recipe a keeper. Followed the recommendation of addition of grated fresh ginger.

a great recipe. i followed it exactly the first time, added a "seafood medley" (from a frozen package containing shrimp, squid, cuttlefish etc.)the second time and it was just as good. the third time was for my wife's potluck lunch at her office so to appeal to everyone i used cubed chicken and apparently everyone loved it. when it's just for the two of us i add another teaspoon of curry paste. top notch recipe.

Rating: 4
This is a first rate recipe. Great for guests or family. You can change the seafood ingredients to suit what looks fresh at your fish store. If you don't have fresh basil, just drop it. Dried basil is no substitute Adding fresh ginger, lemon grass and snow peas make this dish even more authentic and multi-layered.

Yummy, and it just couldn't be easier. I added some water chestnuts and snow peas and substituted chopped broccolini for the broccoli slaw. I tried the recipe a second time with cilantro rather than basil-- it was an interesting flavor twist.

This is amazing! Even my aunt who is the creme-de-la-creme of cooks raved about it. The second time around, I used coconut cream in the beginning with the red curry paste, then added the coconut milk until it was a nice rich texture. I used thai basil and thinly sliced lime keiffer leaves found in China town in TO. This is really simple but remarklable!

This was really good. I've made other thai curries but this one came out the best. This may sound like a completely different dish due to the changes I've made but it made the curry more complex and flavorful. Made the following adjustments. Sautéed butter (2 tb), ginger (1tb), garlic (2 tb), one julienne red onion, with the red curry paste, then added 5 plum tomatoes, used 1/2 cup of seafood/clam stock instead of water, 1/2 lb of halibut instead of the scallops, used Cilantro rather than basil and added bok choy in the last 2 min instead of the broccoli slaw as well as added some brown sugar to sweeten it a little. I grated some lime rind as well as squeezed some limejuice near the end--would of used Kefir lime leaves but didn't have it. Don't forget the fish sauce it makes a big difference. Served with Jasmine rice. My husband said it was better than the curry at the thai resturant we order from.

I loved this recipe, and so did my guests. Easy, delicious -- it's a winner. I used canned fish stock instead of water, and I found the curry paste heat to be just right. Any type of fish works. I did as one reviewer suggested and added the fish at the very end and cooked it just until the shrimp was pink. Fabulous!!

Rating: 3
Delicious! I used extra thai curry for more spice (we like things HOT!!), added a bit of raw brown sugar to make it a tad sweetened, and used wild cod filet instead of mussels (couldn't get them the day I prepared the soup)...results were wonderful! only suggestion from my boyfriend was to add shrimp at the very last moment to insure their softness rather than rubberiness. Great recipe!

I really can't take spicy food, so be warned that 1 tablespoon of the Thai paste can be too much for sensitive mouths- 1 to 1.5 teaspoons is just right for me.

This is amazingly good! After you rinse your seafood and peel the shrimp, it takes only minutes to prepare, but people will think you spent hours! The 1 tbs. of curry paste was just perfect "heat", and I love the presentation of the molded rice with the stew over. Will do again for sure!

Yet another one to follow others' advice and omitted the water. Great idea ..... the coconut flavoured sauce was absorbed beautifully by the rice to make the dish more stew-like. Added fresh garlic and ginger and substituded crab for the scallops. This is fast, easy and fabulous!!! Huge hit with everyone.

Excellent! I substituted lite coconut milk and clams for the mussels. We had leftovers because there were only three of us, but it probably would have served five.

I omitted the water as others suggested and I'm glad I did. I used 1 tablespoon of curry paste and it was too hot for one of my guests but everyone else thought it was just right. Had a small bowl leftover and after two days in the fridge it was even better than the first time!

Delicious! I would leave out any water next time. There is plenty liquid without it and it only diluted the flavor.

Probably the quickest dinner I've ever made. It tastes great too, and looks much more complicated to prepare than it really is. I took the advice of previous reviewers and omitted the water entirely; I couldn't see what purpose it could serve except to dilute the wonderful flavors. I would also suggest using the fish sauce. It added a wonderful complexity to the broth. I also used a smidge of brown sugar, just for fun. This is such an easy yet satisfying dinner that I'm sure it'll be a frequent "go-to" recipe.

Wonderful, easy to prepare recipe! Used exactly 1tbsp of Thai Kitchen curry paste and thought it was just right. I also added 6, half inch pieces of bruised lemongrass stalk for extra flavor. The sauce spooned over the molded rice has excellent presentation (makes it look like a lot more work went into it!)

Rating: 3
Although I really liked this dish as written, when I make it again, I will omit the water completely. It only waters down the delicious coconut and curry flavors and gives the broth a thin, watery consistency. I also think I will try this with green curry paste instead of red to better compliment the seafood flavors.

Rating: 2
We made this last night and had to omit the mussels due to lack of availability. The sauce has a good Thai flavor, but I found it a bit watery. My husband really liked the dish. We will try it again and reduce the amount of water - also might increase the broccoli slaw amount. I like a thicker stew.

Rating: 3
Simple and deliscious. I didn't have any broccoli slaw so I used chopped broccoli spears and shredded carrots. I also used a mild white fish in place of the shrimp and the mussells. Next time, I'd like to try some crab. I substituted some chicken broth for the coconut milk to make it a little lighter. It still tasted rich. Lastly, I added a little green curry paste in addition to the red. It added a nice zing.

Was very good. For the person asking about other recipes, I found the Mann's website (they are the ones that make the slaw) with some recipes for using the slaw - http://www.broccoli.com/kitchen/mkrecipestoc.htm

Very tasty, my husband and I both enjoyed it and I gave it extra marks for quick and easy prep. I used the full 2 tblsps. of red curry paste and did not find it too spicy, and I'm VERY sensitive to hot foods. After reading other reader's comments I cut the water down to 1/4 cup and the consistency of the broth was perfect, ie. like a cream soup. I used 1 lb. each of scallops and shrimp, no mussels. I managed to find, (eureka!!), Broccoli Slaw, in the produce dept. of our local Safeway store. It's a prepackaged bag of shredded broccoli hearts, carrots, and red cabbage, from a California based company named "MANN"S".

This had interesting and exotic flavors and it was fast. I had no clue what brocolli slaw was so I just used the tough ends and julienned them. That worked fine. I thought it a little bland and would add more chili paste next time. But the best is that it took nearly no time to make!

We liked this very much; it was easy and quick to put together. We like spicy food, but I would urge those who are more cautious to start with less curry paste, this is a bit overwhelming otherwise. Do you have any recipes for the remainder of the broccoli slaw?!

Outstanding. Had a good kick to it too. Not fond of scallops so used 1 pound of cod instead. Also used Thai basil and substituted 2c of lite coconut milk for 2 cup coconut milk. Used 1/2 cup of the regular coconut milk.Doubt it compromised the recipe b/c it was absolutely delicious.

Made this for my girlfriend and brother and absolutely loved it. Only problem I had was finding brocolli slaw. I wasn't sure whether it was a coleslaw, so I left it out and added imitation crab meat instead of mussels (I'm not a big mussels fan). I used 1 and a half tablespoons of the curry paste as I felt 1 wasn't hot enough. My only complaint was that it was a little too watery (since I thought it was actual stew) but will definately make it again as a soup! *over*and*out* *SiLver*RoBoT*

FABULOUS! This recipe was quick and easy for a mid-week supper, but also elegant and good enough for company. My husband and I are not crazy about mussels so we added some mild white fish instead (skin side up, so we could peel it off before serving). I also preferred Thai basil (thanks to a previous reviewer).

It was overall great. I thought it could be thicker as well and would omit the water. Also use full fat coconut milk. The light stuff is too thin. I also added 1 tblsp. sugar to sweeten it up. The curry paste is perfect on the spice, don't underestimate it's power. Yummy stuff!

This recipe, true to the 'fast and easy' spirit of the column, was so quick to make. So much so, that I had to keep it warm for a few minutes while the rice cooked. I did, however, find the 'broth' a bit runny. Next time, I would omit the water entirely and work with only the coconut milk. I added 2 small Kafir lime leaves and substituted Thai basil for regular sweet basil. These additions further enhanced the flavor and launched this recipe onto my "quick-fix" list for dinner.
