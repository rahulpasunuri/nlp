Hey people! We are in the u.s. home of Taco Bell! Authentic Mexican food is terrific. But sometimes, you just want a yummy in your tummy taco-ish. I thought this was great!

This is not a mexican dish. A mexican taco is much simpler and asks for less ingredients. Just cook the beaf on a low fire with some Maggi sauce. Serve on a tortilla, adding chopped cilantro and onion, lime juice and green salsa! NEVER add cream, cheddar cheese or tomatoes to this, as you would convert it into a TEXMEX dish, not MEXICAN!
