I made this as an entree with these alterations: 1. I used an apple instead of the jicama. 2. Topped the chicken with sliced avacado 3. Finished off with chopped toasted pecans It was seriously good. First I mesquite smoked two boneless skinless breasts in my stove top smoker which was about 1.5 times the recipe. This worked out perfectly with one granny smith apple, and I toasted the pecans for about five minutes while I was toasting the cornbread. The pecans add a whole layer of complexity to this dish. The avacado has nice flavor and adds a textural counterpoint, but the pecans are crucial. Also, be certain to toast the coarnbread to a good crispness to prevent it from becoming prematurely soggy which can be an issue when served as an entree.

We've made this recipe for years and it's perfect everytime as is. We do smoke our own chicken and make little sandwiches using potato bread rolls. Yum!

New suggestions for this recipe: Shred the smoked chicken (whole breasts acquired from a butcher) and instead of the jicama, use 1/2 cup of shredded green mango. Top with cilantro leaves and garnish with a slice of habanero chile. Shredding of the chicken and mango drapes nicely over the cornbread triangles, while the other vegetables cling nicely to the lengthy bits. A small spoonful of creme fraiche or Greek yoghurt as finishing touch and the dish is transformed into an elegant, but edgy, first course.

So good! I turned this into a fresh main course and it was a huge success. I used less mayo, more lime, and added to cans of black beans and a head of shredded red leaf lettuce. Salt and pepper to taste with cornbread on the side. Will definitely make again.

I originally made a version of this for New Year's, but unlike another reviewer, since I made so many substitutions I knew it wouldn't be fair to rate the recipe. Today I made the real deal. I smoked my own chicken and found the flavors of the chicken salad to be quite good. I couldn't wait so I had some tonight, but I can tell it will be better after the flavors blend overnight. Both times I did make the cornbread exactly as the recipe says, or so I thought. After checking my pan I realized it is 10 by 5 1/2. The difference may have been what helped it hold together since my triangles were actually much smaller. The slices came out rectangular so I first cut them in half to make 2 squares and then those were cut into triangles. Toasted just like the recipe and they made a perfect one to two bite appetizer.

This is one of my favorite party appetizers! I made again this year for a Christmas party and they quickly disappeared. I make the chicken salad a day or two before the party and refrigerate. I use apple instead of jicama. And, rather than the cornbread triangles, I scoop the chicken salad into phyllo shells (from the freezer section of the grocery store) a few hours before the party. Quick, easy, and delicious!

We also used our own freshly smoked chicken. I subsituted corn toaster cake rounds for the cornbread to cut a little prep time - worked really well - this is now a requested item!

I made this with smoked turkey and was under impressed by the flavor

To compensate for ingredients I didn't have, I made some changes to this recipe, but still enjoyed it, especially the longer it sat. If I *had* been able to use the specified ingredients, I think it would've been wonderful. Instead, I used chicken, baked with BBQ sauce, hoping to add smokiness. It didn't work, yet didn't harm the taste of the salad either. Based on the result, if smoked chicken/turkey isn't available, I'd like to try substituting smoked salmon or adding a handful of chopped smoked almonds instead. I love chipotle peppers, but 2 tsps was too much for me. Next time, I'll try 1 1/2. Though corn is one of my favorite flavors, too, I had to find an alternative to cornbread. Since flour tortillas yielded the best taste, I suspect that corn tortillas would be even better, quicker than cornbread, and maybe avoid the crumbliness of cornbread that earlier reviewers mentioned. Corn would also be good added right into the salad. To mine, I added sharp cheddar cheese and was very happy with the result; made the salad more interesting. Black beans might be fun, too, along with sour cream, which could be piped or spooned over the chicken salad to create a pretty garnish, along with a sprinkling of cilantro.

What a treat for our guests! They hovered over the appetizer table. We used our own smoked chicken so the fresh smokiness blended with all the other ingredients after a day of sitting in the fridge, but you still got a slight kick from the adobo . I toasted the cornbread to make it a little more "pickuppable" but in the end I think a little bit of the flavor of the cornbread was compromised. Will cut the cornbread a little different and not toast it next time. Maybe I'll "lighten" it by substituting half the mayo with low fat sour cream.

I served this as part of a party I gave, appetizers for 80 people. I had quite a few dishes, but this is the one that everyone seemed to rave about. I kept some for myself and had it the next day for lunch - it was really good.

I made this for a party and everyone raved about it. The cornbread was not as much of a hit. Next time I make it I'll omit the cornbread.

I thought the cornbread recipe one of the best I ever tasted. However, I didn't think the chicken salad was very good and it didn't seem to mesh well with the cornbread. Also seemed pretty heavy as an apetizer.

I thought this was great, but I didn't get many comments on it. The cumin makes the chicken salad. I bought a whole smoked chicken at the smoker stand at the store and it was wonderful. I think starting w/ a cornbread mix would make this easier. It's hard to get the cornbread toasted...mine was a little limp, but I will definately make this again.

Great recipe! So many flavors and so unexpected! It was the hit of my party. It took some time to put together but well worth it in the end. I used Chiptole corn bread mix that saved me time and was a perfect compliment to the chicken salad (which I used turkey instead).

This is a hit at cocktail parties. In a pinch, I substitute water chestnuts for the jicama in the salad and chopped green chilies for the poblanos in the corn bread. The secret to this recipe is the chipotles.

I made this for a party..it was a hit! I used smoked turkey breast instead of chicken, I didn't find the jicama so I used celery instead and didn't want to open a whole can of chiptole peppers for such a small amount so I omitted it. Still it was great!

This was delicious! I can't wait to make it again. I used smoked turkey, since I couldn't find the chicken. Also I omitted the poblanos from the corn bread, simply out of laziness. To die for!

This is a wonderful recipe - the chicken has a little heat and bite and the cornbread is the perfect foil. I made this for my sister-in-laws wedding reception and it was the hit of the menu!

I had a party this weekend and this was the favorite of all the recipes I made!! The corn bread made an excellent combination for the salad. It was really easy to make and made great sandwiches for the leftover salad that I had. It was a hit!!

This recipe is wonderful any time of year. Everytime I bring this dish to a party, I offer the recipe to at least 5 people.
