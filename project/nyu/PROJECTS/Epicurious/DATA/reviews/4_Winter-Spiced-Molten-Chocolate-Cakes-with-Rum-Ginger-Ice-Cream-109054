My husband and I have made these our holiday dinner party staple, and they garner praise without fail. We just did them for New Year's Eve, and used freshly-ground cardamom, white pepper, and cloves (store-bought for the remaining spices), and it was exceptionally good. I agree that the rum-ginger ice cream adds an exquisite layer to the sumptuous flavors of the cakes, but we've also just used vanilla and that was fine, too. We skip the ramekins and just use well-buttered muffin tins, and they make great portions after a big dinner. Definitely recommend.

This is absolutely THE best molten cake ever! It's easy to assemble and you can bake it the next day which is a huge time saver for dinner party day. You DO have to VERY liberally butter the ramekins. If you think you've buttered them well enough, go ahead and do it again. Follow the cooking time carefully because you do not want these to over-bake. You'll lose the "molten" effect. The rum-ginger ice cream is the perfect accompaniment so don't try to save time and substitute another. This gets raves every time and I've had several guests who ate two!

This is my go-to recipe for molten lava cakes. I make them without any spices, and I never have a problem getting them out of the ramekins. I usually half it, and cook the cakes for no more and no less than 12 minutes. It's imperative to have the exact cooking time in order for perfection. Depending on yor ramekin size, and how high you fill them, the time could differ. This recipe is so so easy, you can throw it together in under 10 minutes. The best!

These are delicious! When I couldn't get them out of the ramekins, I stopped trying and just served them in the dishes. They looked cute!

Very, easy, very delicious, and very rich. The ice cream seems like it may be a small thing, but it was so delicious, so worth the extra 5 minutes to make. I halved the recip for a 4 person dinner party and my boyfriend was very upset that he couldn't have more... And he's been talking about it ever since! Definitely follow the advice to liberally butter the ramekins, though. I thought I had done so, but the tops of the cakes stuck to it and "bled" everywhere.

I love this recipe not only because it tastes amazing, but it's super easy. I consider myself a novice baker/cook and easily whipped this up. The spices are a great blend and I definitely felt like I was eating a little piece of Christmas. Because of its unique taste I probably won't be making it a regular desert, but more for special occasions. I used the amount of sugar called for and didn't find it to be a problem; however, I used a 60% cocoa bittersweet chocolate bits. I'm wondering if people are finding it too sweet if they used a chocolate with more sugar? It is a very rich desert, but what would you expect from a pure chocolate desert :-). I just did a trial run so I didn't use any ice cream. I bet it would have tasted even better.

I freeze my ramekins. Butter them and use room temp butter on a paper towel or tea towel. Liberally butter them! Then add granulated sugar, knocking off the excess. Throw them in the freezer until you're ready to fill and bake. And do not fill the ramekins to the top. If this recipe filled more than 8 ramekins, they were smaller than advised. You would have had to adjust your cooking time, but not the temp. Hope that helps! It's a yummy one! I, too, omit the cloves. And I make a ginger, rum, anglaise. Enjoy!

I've made this recipe multiple times (6 or more) and love it! I get rave reviews on presentation and taste. Just remember to butter your dishes really well or you will have difficulty getting the cakes out intact. I highly recommend it.

This recipe is superlative. Granted I've made this a few times before, but I was able to whip this up last night in ten minutes after the main course at a dinner party, and it was perfect-the cakes even turned out onto the plates without so much as a crack. My advice: melt the butter and chocolate separately in the microwave in small silicon bowls, which make it easy to pour. While the microwave is going, whisk the eggs in a big silicon bowl, add the sugar and vanilla, and measure out the flour for later. Then pour the butter into the chocolate, add however much you want of the spices (I used white pepper, cardamom and cinnamon but no cloves). Heavily butter the ramekins while the chocolate is cooling. Then add the chocolate to the eggs, whisk it all together, whisk in the flour, pour from the silicon bowl to the cups. Et voilà. No mess, no fuss.

I hate to say this, but this recipe basically ruined my Christmas dinner. I followed it exactly to the T. I buttered the dishes really well. I didn't have enough of one type, so used glass, ceramic and foil souffle dishes. I was feeding 10, so hoped the recipe would stretch. Well stretch it did. I poured at least 13 all the way to the top of the dishes and still had loads more left. As I had extra I thought I'd just test two out before the big day. I have a new stove so my temperature is really exact. I put them in for the stated 15 minutes and they looked really promising. They rose up beautifully and were crispy on the edges like the recipe said. Then I took a knife and went around the edges...basically did everything, then tried to get them out of the dishes... there was no way these things were going to come out. Eventually I had to scoop them out and what I had was a bit of cake and big pile of gloopy chocolate. I didn't panic, I just thought on the day I would lower the temperature and cook for longer. Same thing. They wouldn't come out of any type of souffle dish and when they did, they were just a pile of chocolate. I would consider myself a pretty good pastry chef, so I wasn't phased by doing these, but there is definitely something wrong with this recipe. The chocolate tastes gorgeous and so does the ice cream, but I really don't know whether I'd want to go to the expense of trying these again to test whether I'd did something wrong. Oh well, at least I had a few laughs on Christmas day about the piles of chocolate sitting on my lovely gold plates....not quite the response I was hoping for and a big waste of time and money.

Made this last night for a family Christmas gathering of 15. Based on reviews used half the cardamom, but otherwise followed the recipe. Made the batter one day ahead and refridgerated. I used 1/2 c ramekins (not full to the top) and in addition, a cupcake pan. I made a total of 18 desserts with one recipe! The size was plenty big, especially after a rich dinner. Everyone loved these, young and old. The spice did not overpower. I made the rum/ginger ice cream and gave guests a choice of that or vanilla. Great recipe...definitely a keeper.

I've made this many times since it was first published; always a hit. As one other reviewer said, cut recipe in half for 4 servings. The spices can be omitted or substitute a flavored liquor. I have frozen the uncooked ramekins for up to six months and they baked up beautifully!

Big hit and a perfect ending to an evening of homemade Indian food. I liked the spices as is, but could definitely seee it being a little too much for some. It is VERY rich; coming from someone who doesn't like sweet sweet desserts, next time I might play around with a little less sugar. I liked the ice cream but thought it could have used MORE ginger and rum. The ice cream on its own would make a great dessert.

It's almost New Years Eve and time to make these amazing cakes again. They are always the hit of the party and I am not allowed to serve anything but this for dessert!! As recommended by one reviewer I use half of the recommended cardomen and other than that I follow the recipe exactly. The spices are not overwhelming, what they do is intensify the chocolate. I have never used the Rum Ginger Ice Cream, but always serve with Vanilla.

First time making them, figured I'd follow the recipe. (Usually I take into account the reviewer comments, but they seemed mixed as to amount of sugar, cardamom, etc.) I think they turned out great using the recipe as listed. They were sweet, but not cloyingly so. Be careful not to overcook them. 2 min turns them from lava-y gems into more like a souflee. The ice cream was essential. We tried both plain vanilla and the ginger rum--much preferred the second. Easy to make; store well in the fridge for several days and would definitely make them again.

Wanted to like these more than I did. First time around they were undercooked (crusty top with warm "pudding" as bottom), 2nd time I made them over-cooked. I am sure you could get it just right, especially if you are not distracted by wine, dinner guests, kids, or the Cobert Report, as I often am around dessert time. Overall, not the best dessert in the world. I LOVE the idea more than the dessert. I liked the spices, I really did, but... I am not craving this one again. Might try with slightly less cardamom and slightly more cinnamon next time. Also, I made it with the honey mousse suggested by others - not sure if this is the best pairing though. I don't think the ginger ice cream went either - too much spice. Maybe something orangey? I also served with a fig-cherry compote with orange zest. That was tasty together - very luscious. Is easy to prepare!!! Did not have any problems with it being too sweet as others had mentioned.

Delicious and decadent! Easy to prepare, though I think I overcooked by a minute or two. I would have preferred them a bit more molten in then center, but I think that's easy to rectify. My oven (Viking) runs a little hot. I added an 1/8th tsp of chipotle powder; it added a warm, smokey hint.

FANTASTIC. I didn't want to spend the $ on Cardamom. Instead I added a dash of mint extract. I also cooked them in a muffin tin. Second time I've made them and they are great. A bit was left over for the wife and I tonight. This recipe is awesome.

Rich, Rich, Rich! I cut the recipe in half, omitted the cardamom, and baked the batter in 4 - 6oz ramekins for my future daughter-in-law's birthday. My son described it as a "chocolate blow to the head". I made the rum-ginger ice cream but didn't think it added enough to bother with it in the future. Whipped cream would complement the cake nicely.

These were perfect to bring to a friend's house, due to the make-ahead factor. Would definitely make these again - everyone raved about them and the presentation was beautiful. It was so intense that the serving was just a bit too big, next time I will try cupcake tins to remedy that. I am so often disappointed by molten chocolate cakes served in restaurants, but these didn't disappoint at all. The spices made it very special, though I did skip the cardamom.

These cakes were fabulous. The spices gave the cakes a wonderful aroma and depth. These were served for a birthday gift and our first bite was pure ambrosia. We wanted to fall into the dessert. Using another's advice, I served them with Frozen honey Mousse which was the perfect pairing. Good ooze factor. I've made other molten cakes with ganache in the center, and was worried that these would not ooze, but they did not disappoint. They were pure heaven.

The spices are fantastic. I agree that the cardamom should be decreased to 1 tsp as it can easily overpower the other flavors. I also agree that it is too sweet. I advise cutting back on the sugar or subbing some unsweetened choc. for bitter/semi- sweet chocolate. Otherwise, very delicious.

I agree with the reviewers that the recipe is a bit too sweet for my taste. I loved the spices though. The recipe as written makes a large quantity and a large serving.

A lovely recipe, if you have an intense sweet tooth. However, I found the batter to be a bit too cloying, so I added 1/4 teaspoon salt with the flour and also added about 3 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder (not Dutch-processed) to the chocolate mixture. Next time, I may use unsweetened chocolate and cocoa powder and then add sugar to taste... I wanted my cakes to be more like very moist, slightly underdone brownies, hence the addition of the cocoa powder. I also baked them in a 12-cup muffin tin. (Actually, it was more like a tray for round financiers.) Finally, to further cut down on the sweetness, I served them with whipped cream with some minced fresh ginger and chopped crystallized ginger folded in. The spices in the batter are actually very subtle and lend it a wonderful perfume. Quite divine!

This was amazing! I halved the recipe and baked in cupcake tins. Perfect amount for two cupcakes per person. Absolutely delicious. But don't skip the ice cream!

I refrigerated the batter while we had dinner - so convenient! I filled smaller ceramic ramekins to the very top and cooked them for an extra minute or two since they were chilled. They rose like soufflés in the oven, and made for a very dramatic, tall presentation! We had them with raspberry ice cream and they we simply delicious. I used Ghiradelli semisweet chocolate, but next time will try 70% dark for more depth of flavor.

Perfect! As suggested by previous reviewer, I reduced the cardamom to 1 tsp. but added 1/4 t. cinnamon, 1/4 t. cayenne, and a pinch of nutmeg. I served it along with regualr vanilla ice cream, which I thought was better as a complement so it didn't compete with the cake. Also, cooked it only about 13 minutes. which was perfect. Makes MORE than enough! Very rich.

I have tried all 7 of the molten lava cake recipes as all my friends are great fans of this. All the recipes are great but just not perfect. So I went back to the drawing board- selected this recipe as it had the most chocolate per portion and significantly reduced the sugar to 4 tablespoons as we prefer our desserts to seduce the senses not overpower them. With or without the spices this is THE ONE!

Looking for a tasty, easy dessert beyond just a plain chocolate cake, I found this recipe and it has been my stand-by ever since. The spices definitely make the cake, but sometimes I add a little cinnamon or nutmeg, or both. I find the serving size too large as well and use a large muffin pan, and reduce the bake time by a few minutes. (Go by the visual clues to tell when they are done or you miss out on the ooze.) I just serve with vanilla ice cream and a pinch of spice on top. Scrumptious!

My hubby made this last night for our Valentine's dessert... it was a trule magnificant treat. Didn't change a thing. I'd be interested to see a hint more cayenne papper (we have a cookie place in town that sells a dark chocolate cayenne cookie and it's got bite, it just works). This dessert is really impressive. And it makes a LOT. We froze the rest of the batter.

Wonderful! I was nervous about the spices because of all the reviewers who didn't care for this cake even though they normally love the spices listed. Happily, I did love them in this cake, as I'd thought. And there really is something to the comparisons to gingerbread; something about them does evoke it in spite of the lack of cinnamon, nutmeg, or GINGER!! (All of which would be worthy additions to this recipe, methinks.) Anyway, like others, I, too, did not achieve the desired molten effect. But the cakes were still very tasty. Thanks to all the prior suggestions, I also used foil muffin cups in an XL muffin tin. I didn't even need to grease them, and clean-up afterwards was a snap. I halved the recipe and had enough for all six of the muffin cups filled just below the brim. I saved the extra cakes in the freezer and just nuked one tonight to share with a friend for dessert. Turns out these babies freeze well too. I look forward to making them again and actually taking them out while they're still gooey. I'll probably add 1-1/2 times more spice next time, though. Also, these cakes were tasty with vanilla bean ice cream. So glad I finally tried this recipe; I was not disappointed!

Rating: 4
This has been my dinner party stand-by for years b/c it's elegant, easy and make-ahead (mostly). The unusual spices are a fantastic hit with everyone. A suggestion - i never bother with the ice cream. Frankly, ginger ice cream on spicy cakes sounded like too much spice, so I substituted a wonderful frozen honey mousse, which is a snap to make and people's eyes roll to the back of their heads when the eat it. It's a Joyce Goldstein recipe from her book called The Mediterranean Kitchen. I swear it's got about 4 ingredients and you can make it a day or two in advance. The soft, cold, not-too-sweet honey mousse is the perfect foil to the warm spice of the cakes.

I was a little apprehensive about the variety of spices involved in this recipe but it concluded in a pleasant surprise! The cakes were amazingly delicious and I will definitely be making them again! Because the recipe makes eight, i kept two for me and my family and gave the other six away for christmas gifts. Everyone absolutely loved them! The recipe makes more than needed for eight souffle dishes I think. I used a mini cake pan for six cakes and then put the rest of the batter in cooking dishes. It made more than was expected but that just added to it's appeal. Definitely recommended!

I don't love chocolate for chocolate's sake (my wife, however...) but I have been making this ever since it caught my eye on the Bon Appetit cover. It is simple to prepare, yet very interesting. The warm, exotic (for dessert) spices make it useful for both casual and more refined gatherings. Only the richest of bock beers, such as the Austrian Samichlaus, or a British barleywine can keep up with this. The Swiss beer BFM La Meule, brewed with sage, would be a clever pairing as well.

I made this for a dinner party when the recipe first became available. Everyone was so blown away, years later, they continue to request these lava cakes. I was skeptical of the spices at first, but followed the recipe. The spices make the dish, almost like a secret ingredient because no one can put their finger on what makes these cakes taste so unique. Great presentation for dinner parties. Stopped bothering with the rum ice cream. Much easier going with vanilla. I now serve them in the dish after struggling to get them out in one piece. A small bump considering the great wow factor in this tasty, easy-to-prepare dessert.

I've made this several times & it never fails! Over time, I've found that our preference is to halve all of the spices. If you first blend all spices together in a small dish, you can add it to the chocolate part a little at a time until it tastes just right to you. Have always used store bought ice cream; no problem. Also, our ramekin size is 1/2 cup (not 3/4 cup like the recipe calls for). Even this is too big for a single portion (but we always manage to finish it anyway...!).

I wanted to find a recipe for the gooey chocolate cakes I get at restaurants. This was definitely it. I didn't have any ramekins and could not find large muffin holders. I ended up using my regular muffin tin with a silicone (?) liner. They came out perfect. They cooked in 15 minutes from the fridge and really were a good size. I paired it with blackberries and raspery organic icecream for valentines day but the vanilla ice cream with rum sounds good. Definitely will make this again.

Though a bit skeptical about the spices, I can't imagine making this dish without them now! They add enormous depth and warmth. I never made it to the ice cream, just used a whipped cream. I also used extra-large foil cupcake tins, with a spritz of Pam and a sprinkling of sugar. I put them into cupcake tins for easy handling, filled them to the brim and stuck them in the fridge til 15 minutes before dessert time. It made 14 more-than-ample cakes. The foil peeled right off, and I inverted the cakes on dessert plates, topped them with whipped cream and raspberries and ooh-la-la. A go-to recipe for nearly any occasion.

Oh, and the ice cream, well, I think next time a plain vanilla or nice rum ice cream. This one was just not worth any effort for us.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and was very impressed as were my guests. I followed the recipe exactly as is with all of the spices.

I halved the recipe, which fit perfectly in 12 regular-sized (i.e. 1/4 cup) muffin cups. In this case, bake for 9-10 minutes for the desired ooze effect. Since this dessert is so rich, it is the perfect serving size for guests. Flavour-wise: incredible. I was a little hesitant about putting ground corriander in a dessert, but the blend of spices was wonderful. Cut the cardamom in half, so that the other spices stand out a little more.

In addition they are perfect for a leisurely meal for a group--can be done ahead and then cooked while the dinner plates are being cleared. This recipe is a great find.

Excellent! Cakes and ice cream simply delicious. Made for a Christmas party and everyone was impressed. The spices were perfect, this recipe is a keeper.

This is a very easy, but impressive dessert for a large dinner party. The spice mixture imparts a unique flavor in these cakes so they are not too sweet. I served them with a homemade blackberry sauce and plain vanilla ice cream. Asbestos finger tips help when removing the cakes from the ramekins.

I made this yesterday, and it was incredibly simple to prepare. This would be a great desert for a dinner party. I ended up having enough batter to fill 9 remekins, so if you're not having a party, you may want to cut this in half.

These turned out great, despite a potential disaster. I was housesitting and, not being familiar with the oven, didn't get the timer turned on correctly when I put these in while we were eating dinner with our guests. I kept thinking it was the longest 15 minutes I'd ever experienced. I think they must have cooked at least 25 minutes, but, interestingly, they just puffed up, cracked a little, and got a light crust on the top, kind of like a souffle. I left them in the ramekins, told everyone I was serving "erupting" (instead of "molten")chocolate cakes, and everyone loved them. A good-luck kitchen mistake!

I've made this dish, to rave reviews, many times. I don't particularly like to cook but these cakes are so delicious that they're worth it. They look gourmet but are quite easy to make. If you love rich, spicy chocolate these are the best.

This was soooo good. I skipped the ginger ice cream in favor of fresh whipped cream and a drizzle of spicy chocolate liqueur, which made it over the top delicious. My family is still talking about it 4 months later. Make sure you eat it right out of the oven. Warmed over it just isn't the same.

This is an awesome recipe - a definite keeper. The 2nd time I made this I cut back on the cardamom (by half) - and it was still intense enough for me. Both times the "ooze factor" did not disappoint! The portions are big even without the side of ice cream.

Made this for my chocolate-obsessed family for Easter this year and it was a big hit; but I would also make the servings smaller, no one could finish theirs, even without ice cream on the side.

Rating: 4
A delicious, impressive dessert. Surprising how easy it is to make. Regarding the comments of my friend from Cedar Creek, TX, my advice is to avoid the temptation to overcook the cakes. It's easy to think that the middle looks too "liquidy." However, it can go from liquidy to "not molten enough" very quickly. Since all ovens are different, you'll need to make it a couple of times to figure out the right baking time.

Rating: 4
I wondered how the spices would blend with the chocolate, but was very pleased in the end. I found that I needed to cook the cakes at least 20 minutes so that they did not fall apart when removing them from the dishes. They were still runny in the middle, though. I have made this recipe twice and will definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
This recipe was wonderful. Only suggestion would be to use smaller ramekins, since it is very rich. It's also quite easy to make. Don't be thrown off by the white pepper in the recipe. It helps temper the sweetness of the chocolate.

"O, Lord, please let me into heaven, because I know that these puddings will be on the menu!" Truely a WONDERFUL desert, and soooo easy too. I followed everything to the letter, except the cooking time, which I reduced having read previous comments, and we were treated to possibly the best chocolate pudding I have ever eaten (and, believe me, I've had my fair share!). If you don't do any other chocolate recipe on this site, do this one.

Rating: 4
This was excellent. I'm constantly looking for new ways to make molten chocolate cakes, and the spices in this one give it a great twist. I served it with ginger creme anglaise instead of ice cream because it was cold outside. It worked wonderfully. As with all chocolate dishes, however, the quality of the chocolate you use will affect your end product. I used Valrhona. I would definitely recomment this

Magnificently subtle and very rich...and very easy to prepare ahead of time. (We made the ice cream and prepped the batter the day before, so all that was left was the quick baking.) Our guests raved, and several asked for the recipe. Don't be afraid of the spices!

Unbelievable. Even better the next day. We made this for a fancy dinner party for 35 people. It was a knock out hit. These cakes are extremely rich-we used smaller containers. Don't let the recipe intimidate you!! They are that good!

To Cook from Princeton: I think a practice run would have served you well. I'm usually afraid to try an untested recipe - especially one with a variable such as "molten" - when I'm serving guests. Once, as a guest at a dinner party, I had to witness the embarrassed agony of our hostess as she sliced into a raw-in-the-center stuffed leg of lamb. I vowed that would never be me

Rating: 3
Made the batter in the afternoon and refrigerated the ramekins. Followed recipe and baked for 18 minutes. The problem is that it is quite difficult to tell when the cakes are ready. So the result was too much molten and not enough cake. My guests were slightly perplexed. However the flavor was great. Ice cream is simple to make and tastes fantastic.

I made this recipe for company from out of town. It was a HUGE hit. I was a little scared to add the spices in the recipe, but decided to go for it. I am so glad I did! Wow! I can't wait to make it again. Definitely a great recipe to "wow" people with.

Rating: 4
What a hit! I've made this twice for company. The second time, my guest actually called me the next day to reiterate how fab it was! I may even like the ice cream better than the cakes, yum! I used frozen yogurt because I thought the heavy ice cream would be overkill. So easy to make ahead of time.

Rating: 3
I had difuculty unmolding these little cakes, probably because they were slightly undercooked. I have a history of overcooking ¨molten¨cakes, so I over compensated. The flavor was very interesting, and well recieved. Guests played ¨guess the spice¨ Spice flavors are much more pronounced when cool than when warm. Definately take the time to make the ice cream, it gives that detailed touch. I made the crystalized ginger from scratch because I couldn't find it in the store. Buy it if you can!

Every one at my house loves spices and this cake was a huge hit! I really like a tart foil to decadent chocolate desserts so instead of the ginger ice cream I served it with home made Cranberry Sorbet. I probably won't make it again till next fall but it was So easy and impressive there will be a repeat. JS

It seems that every January issue of Bon Appetit has a recipe for molten chocolate cake. I enjoyed this recipe, and the spice added a different twist, but it is not my favorite. It was still pretty good though!

I have made this recipe twice (served with vanilla ice cream), once for a chocolate expert and another time for my family, which is not very adventurous. Both times it was a hit. I only transfer 5-10 recipes a year from Bon Appetit to my keeper file and this is one that stays. Also great because it is easy to make ahead and transport. I don't think the spices were overwhelming, but all of those I served it too are those who love spice.

All I could taste in this recipe was the spice. I'm a big fan of spices but they are too overwhelming here.

This was amazing...and so easy to make for a party (just pop them in the oven at the right moment). I didn´t have time for the ginger ice cream, which I´m sure would have been great, so I omitted ginger altogether and added some cinnamon and a pinch of cayenne pepper to the cake in addition to the other spices. It was incredible. Even my husband liked it (though if I had told him it had cinnamon or chili pepper he never would have tried it!) A real winner!

You can really taste the winter spices, which to me give it an "off" flavor. I prefer the molten choc cake recipe with the mint fudge sauce (on this site). We also had a hard time taking them out of the ramekins, unlike with the other recipe.

This recipe was unbelievable!! It was also so easy that my husband, who can barely make grilled cheese, was able to make it. There was one slight mishap getting one of the cakes onto a plate. We didn't have ginger so just served vanilla ice cream and poured some rum over it. The spices were a great compliment to the chocolate. There wasn't a drop of chocolate left on anyone's plate. I will definitely be making this again as an easy was to make a great impression.

I agree whole heartedly with the cook from Brookline. The only way this recipe has potential is to eliminate the winter spice and make it plain molten chocolate. The rum ginger ice cream was a nice accompaniment, however.

I've made this recipe twice and my wife and daughters love it! They like it better then the Molten Chocolate Cake recipe I used to make from Godiva.com (I'm not a big chocolate fan) and it's MUCH easier to make.

The spices were too overwhelming. I was expecting to get a nice sophisticated blend of spice and chocolate but ended up not caring for the "winter-spiced" component at all. I was much happier with the flavor when I made the cakes a second time without the cardamom and coriander. Nonetheless, you can never go wrong with oozing chocolate!

Rating: 4
Damn tasty. I made these for Valentines Day. I tried to follow the recipe as closely as possible, but realized too late that I didn't have cardamom or coriander. Alas, they were still delish, and the boyfriend was sufficiently wooed. Like a few other cooks, my cakes did not ooze onto the plate, but did stay nice and wet inside. I refrigerated them, but only cooked for 16 minutes. I also agree that the ice cream is a must, as it adds a nice refreshing quality to the very rich cakes. Besides, it's so easy to make you have no excuse not too.

Rating: 3
It was absolutely delicious! I thought about omitting the spices, but decided to follow the recipe exactly, and I'm so glad I did. I used a very good quality chocolate and did not find that the spices overwhelmed the chocolate taste, but rather complimented it and deepened it. I had no trouble unmolding them. However, I didn't get a molten center. I tried twice, as I had refrigerated the cakes and baked them later. The first time, I baked for 18 minutes, and the second time for 15 minutes. Both times the center was soft and creamy but not liquid. But both times absolutely fabulous, my husband raved. I'll definately do it again, with exactly the same spices, and next time reduce the baking time a bit more.

The easiest Delicious dessert! It's great presentation. I served it for 10 couples at Valentine dinner party. I tested one prior to serving...spices were delicious and extremely interesting to me. When I served it, they ate, but no ooohhhhhs and ahhhhss like other times. Depending on taste, the spices could throw some off, like it did this group. ;) I baked in half cup ramekins, for only 11 mins. perfect ooze factor.

Excellent and easy. As a chocolate lover, I would omit the spices next time, they definitely took center stage with this deliciously chocolate dessert. Also, trust the time, I cooked the cakes a couple extra minutes (for fear of the cakes being too runny) and they didn't run when cutting into, they were just wet. Still delicious!

Fantastic. Works like a charm every time. It's relatively easy to make, and is very impressive. Note: the ice cream is mandatory, not optional. It is definitely needed for balance. Try this tonight!!

I made this for Sunday dinner dessert today - I omitted most of the spices, with the exception of the cinnimon, only cause I was lazy and didn't have all the others on hand - I buttered the dishes really well, but the tops still stuck - so the presentation was not what I had hoped - guests loved it though - and I will try again soon - I served with raspberries, as had to cut down on calories somewhere! Next time with whipped cream!

I made this recipe for a Valentine's dinner for four. I made half the cake recipe, and all the ice cream. Easy and delicious. I was suspicious about the unusual spices paired with chocolate, but to my relief they were wonderful. I wouldn't change a thing. I highly recommend this recipe.

BIG HIT!!! We were not big chocolate dessert lovers before but who said you can't change your mind. Trying this has really opened our eyes to a good chocolate dessert. The ice cream was great too. Very easy to put it all together and making it the day before was a big plus. Just popping it in the oven after dinner was finished and to serve something warm I felt was very personable for our guests. They asked for the receipe after the second bite. Most certainly a redo. Can't wait to have more friends over to treat them also. The spices are a must!! Great combination... you have to try it as is. Couldn't find Cardamon but did everything else just as listed. Thanks... it's a keeper, a good one with a great presentation.

I found this recipe to be okay, but not absolutely fabulous. I did try it with all of the spices and the rum ginger ice cream, but the overall flavor was not quite what I was looking for. The rum ginger ice cream is good, by the way (to the last person who reviewed this recipe). I have made it again, but modified it and changed the flavorings completely- I used nutmeg, kirsch, cinnamon, and chopped cherries and thought it was quite nice. The portion sizes on this are a little large and I would concur with the earlier evaluation that smaller portions would work better.

Calling all chocoholics...this dessert is for you! Its terrifically easy to make and very decadent. But be sure to have everyone save room for dessert because its very rich -- in our case, we tried this on Christmas eve dinner with family and friends. The kids found it a little too rich for their taste, but the grownups raved about it. We served it with HagenDaz vanilla ice cream...I'd be curious if anyone has made the ginger rum ice cream to go with it?

I would have to say this is the best dessert I've ever made, and possibly ever eaten! Reading the other reviews, people have left out the spices, but I implore you - put in all the spices. That's what makes it so special, and they're not overpowering - they're fantastic. I halved the recipe & I got 5 cakes - the fifth I baked 2 days later & it was just as good as on the day.

The spice combination in the cake was wonderful, it even tasted good raw! Easy to put together and a real plus that it could be made the day before. The 5 minute resting time after cooking is important. I found it better to use 1/2 cup dishes. It then makes 12 and they are plenty big enough as chocolate batter is so rich.

Excellent dessert as long as you ignore the calories :-) You have to let them rest for 5-10 minutes to get them out nicely. I used only 2 cups of sugar and semi-sweet chocolate and was still too sweet for us. I will try again with even less sugar. Nice presentation and taste.

This is just superb. I have made it twice. The comparison with the flavor of gingerbread is very apt. I have found that 1/3 the recipe makes 3 lovely desserts in 1-cup ramekins. I have had no problems with the texture, I remove them when set on top and they are beautifully runny when served. The ice cream is delicious.

I will add my praise. I made this for a dinner party and it was a hit. People were talking about it days after the event. It was the dessert at the end of a pretty light main course (pasta with grilled veggies and mahi mahi) so we had the space to really enjoy it. The spices were wonderful--a surprisingly different flavor for a chocolate cake. I used black pepper instead of white pepper. I served it with cinnamon gelato instead of the rum-ginger ice cream--a nice complement. Rumor is on the street--other friends who didn't come to this party are asking me to make it for them.... a definite hit and easy to make as well.

This cake was incredible!!! I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. It tastes slightly like ginger-bread. The combination of spices is very different but very additive. I didn't make the ice-cream and it was great without it. I will definitely make this again, though halfing the recipe seems like a good idea.

So decadent and delicious! I halved the spices and omitted the white pepper (personal preference) and loved it. The spices were subtle, but definitely there, and the chocolate was still in the foreground. It is tricky to get the cakes to the "proper" doneness...The ice cream came out scrumptious as well. Great do-ahead party dessert.

Awesome, tasty & easy dessert recipe that you can make the night before! I omitted all the spices and served it with a raspberry coulis on the bottom of the plate with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on the side. My guests loved it! I baked it for the 18 min, ran the knife around and they came out perfect! The recipe also halves very well.

The ice cream was fabulous, and the flavor of the chocolate with the spices was interesting, but I had a problem getting the cakes to the right degree of "doneness". After 18 minutes(the batter had been refrigerated), the tops were puffed and the edges were even slightly burned, but when I unmolded the first cake(yes, I waited 5 minutes as described), it wasn't just "molten", it was complete chocolate soup. I put the rest back in the oven for another 5 minutes(now the edges were really getting black), let them sit and tried again. These were better but still much more liquidy than I would have liked. This recipe is not a keeper for me. With the addition of the spices with the chocolate, I could see this dessert going with a Mexican themed dinner.

Fabulous! We l-o-v-e-d the particular combination of spices in this cake. We will probably bake a bit longer to get it just a tiny bit cakier. Some of us liked it really runny and others liked it with a little more cake and a little less "molten." We served cakes with plain vanilla ice cream and it worked great. Will definitely make this recipe again.

These were terrific! I had a few friends over for dinner and everybody raved about them. One of my guests used the molten middle to create a kind of hot fudge for the ice cream.

Also, I made them the day before and stored them in the fridge, so dessert was simple on the day of the party.

Fantistic! To ease unmolding, after I buttered the ramekins, I sprayed a little PAM in each. They popped right out! Made homemade ice cream to accompany - used an easy vanilla recipe and threw in 2 T. of Williams Sonoma candied ginger chips and 2 T. of rum during the last 5 minutes of processing.

My wife and I have made this dessert twice so far, and it received rave reviews both times. I particularly liked how easy it was to prepare. We made sure we pulled them from the oven while the tops were still runny and plated them immediately. As such we didn't have any problems removing the cakes. I think this dessert would be good any time of year. However, the spices seem to classify it as a winter dessert. Any ideas on what I could substitute for the spices? Thanks

My husband and kids made these. I don't usually like chocolate cake, but these are pretty good! The ice cream is heavenly! We gave the extra cakes to our neighbor, and she has requested this as her birthday cake this year! One problem, they didn't unmold well, despite extensive (excessive?) buttering of the pans by our 10 year old. (The 12 year old did the ice cream).
