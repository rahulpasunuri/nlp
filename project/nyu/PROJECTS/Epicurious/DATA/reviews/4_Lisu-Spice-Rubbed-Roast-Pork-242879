Wow. A new no-fuss staple. Sichuan peppercorn and nutmeg created an interesting faint numbing tingle on the tongue. Delicious. Recipe is perfect as-is.

Easy and delicious. Wonderful, different flavor with very little investment of time. I rarely repeat a recipe and have made this 3 times.

this was the first recipe I made from the Beyond the Great Wall book, I love the flavor and only wish it could penetrate to the interior of the roast. We served this with a recommended tomatillo salsa which is another recipe to keep on hand and make again.
