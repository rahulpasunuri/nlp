To the cook with the question below - when the recipe says "add the chamomile", that's when you add either the tea bags or the loose tea. Then you remove the tea bags or loose tea after 20 minutes (it says "steep 20 minutes". Then you chill. Have not made this but looks good.

This was a very refreshing dessert on a 100+ degree day! I made this with loose-leaf chamomile flowers that I purchased from a spice shop. I was too excited to wait the full 2 hours for the cream to chill--instead I made the whipped cream after 30 minutes of refrigeration. It had a very delicate, lovely flavor. Next time I definitely want to try chilling the unstrained mixture for 2 hours and see if that makes a noticeable difference.

This is the dessert I make when I want to wow somebody. Very very simple to do and the results are fantastic.

How do you use the teabags in the recipe?

I can't say it doesn't provide for a good dish, but it's complicated to make and missing some key parts. Also, it doesn't turn out all that well if you're not actually adding some of your own experience
