Quite good in flavor, but a little dry. I only used 1/2 of the sypup otherwise it would have been too sweet, but also, maybe that is why it was a little dry.

Not sure what I am missing with this recipe, but we didn't like anything about it - the taste, the texture or the smell. It was on the dry side and very ordinary. After we tasted the first piece, we threw the rest out!

The cake was delicious though a little on the dry side. I made salted caramel ice cream to pair it with instead of the whipped cream. The only reason I would not make this again was the difficulty in finding the syrup (which I finally just ordered from Amazon)

This recipe worked exactly as written. Steen's Pure Cane Syrup is a little hard to find, but you can order it online. I made this for our family's Easter dinner and it was a huge hit! It does have a spice cake type of flavor, but the brown sugar and syrup give it a distinct sweetness.

My husband and I loved this moist cake. While its texture is like gingerbread, its caramel taste made us think of spring -- it's like gingerbread to welcome warmer weather! I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.
