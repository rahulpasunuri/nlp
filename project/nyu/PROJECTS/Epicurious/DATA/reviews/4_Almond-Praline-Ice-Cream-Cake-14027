This is an elegant dessert but must agree it is heavy on the time commitment. More than I am will to give.I won't make this again anytime soon.

Yes, twice the ice cream is best. And I made a caramel sauce to drizzle over the top.

I added twice the ice cream as well. Still, the praline butter makes it a very sweet dish. If I were to make it again, I would cut the amount of praline.

This was a huge success! I made this cake for a small Birthday party. I only made a few adjustments. First, I added about twice as much ice cream and mixed in 1/4 cup amaretto into each ice cream layed. I also piped meringue over the entire cake(which freezes much nicer).

This is one of the best desserts I have ever had! It is very time consuming - about 4 hours - but it is well worth the result. Make it for special occasions and people will not be able to stop talking about it!!!! This is a show stopper.

I was just searching for ice cream recipes, saw this listed and noticed that it had not been rated. This is an EXCELLENT dessert! I have made it three times. It is a lot of work but well worth it. A few tips: When mixing the praline into the ice cream, make sure the ice cream is not too soft. Also - its important to line the springform with foil to prevent leakage while the ice cream is hardening. I also put the pan on a tray in the freezer just in case.
