It has been a big hit ,but I substituted fresh grated ginger for the spices and used unsweetened whipped cream with a hint of vanilla instead of the meringue . I also made an 11" tart ,rater than lots of small ones !! Note : taste your mangos .. if bland and boring so your tarts will be!!

We really enjoyed this. Skipped the meringue & used diced mango with fresh mint on top.

Fun summer dessert! Use manilla mangoes if you can - you will need more than 3 due to their small size.

A beautiful and refreshing take on tarts. In order to have a pronounced mango flavor, use about 2 cups of puree. The crust benefits from a bit more coconut as well.

It was a lot of work, but the mango filling just didn't have enough flavor. It made a beautiful presentation, but was disappointing.
