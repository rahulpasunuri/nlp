My kids weren't as wowed with this as I would have thought. I think it just ended up being - "TOO SWEET!" if you can believe it! And maybe the croissants I bought from our terrible grocery store made them too soggy and hard to kind of firm up. I would use this recipe for the dipping parts (so luscious!) but I would use regular bread.

I served this recipe at a New Year's Day breakfast and it was a great hit. They are sweet and decadent - not for every day, certainly, but great for a treat on a cold holiday morning. There is no need at all for syrup!
