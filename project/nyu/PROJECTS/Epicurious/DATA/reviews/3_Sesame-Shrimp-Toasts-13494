I've made this several times, it is always a hit. The last time I made it I had two professional chefs in my kitchen snarfing them up before I could get them out to the rest of the guests. Don't let the negative reviews dissuade you. If you know how to deep fry foods (i.e. you own a fry thermometer) and are willing to make them at the last minute, they're a great treat. I would never bake these. If I wanted baked shrimp there are better recipes. DON'T OMIT OR SUBSTITUTE FOR THE SESAME OIL! I swear, some people should just buy frozen dinners.

THis was the most digusting recipe I have ever made. I followed the instuctions and I just didn't like it. It was way too greasy and no outstanding taste to it.

I modified this recipe so that they would be the "toasts" they are said to be. Instead of deep frying them, I toasted them on a heated pan and added a few drops of oil to the toast on both sides. However, before toasting, I patted the sesame seeds on the shrimp paste so that they would remain in place when I turned the toast on the shrimp side. Also since i did not have any sesame oil, I used cornflour oil (1 tablespoon) and one teaspoon of sesame seeds in lieu of sesame oil. It turned out very good. I used whole wheat bread without trimming the edges.

I'm shocked this didn't get better scores. It is always a huge hit for me. I serve with a soy/sesame sauce. They also freeze and re-heat extremely well. I fry them in an electric pan to control heat and fix the mixture in food processors.

Just had a cocktail party and this was one of the biggest hits of the evening.

In its printed form this recipe has some flaws. I found that by broiling the bread on one side, then coating the other side of the bread with the shimp mixture and then re-broiling that side. the flavor is really quite good and the ugly frying step is completely avoided. I have made it several times in this modified form and gotten complements.

Great if you like a mouthful of warm frying oil! These things are like sponges! The pan-frying method is also really messy and fills the whole room with a greasy smell that's hard to clear. The oil temperature is also difficult to contol without a proper deep-fryer and must be constantly skimmed of topping particles that burn and smoke. A real disaster!
