Would use 1/4 of the butter and fill in with olive oil. Saute a clove of garlic in there. 1 10 oz bag of spinach, a head of escarole and a head of frisee served 8. Delicious greens mixture idea!

I am actually a big fan of sauteed bitter greens, but 7 tablespoons of butter? I make a similar dish all the time but with olive oil. Needless to say I didn't make this recipe so no forks...

I totally agree with your brother, jwb2. With so many other more flavorful choices of winter greens available: chard, kale, collards, etc., why on earth cook salad greens? This was a poor choice of ingredients.

Enjoyable winter green mix for veggie lovers. My brother however asked why I cooked the salad.
