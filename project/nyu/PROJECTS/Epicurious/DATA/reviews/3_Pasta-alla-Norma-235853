this is excellant, but not the same as I enjoyed in Sicily. It is spicy, and without any capers. The eggplant is wonderful, but lacks the creamy texture of the one I enjoyed in Sicily. To be more authentic i would leave out the peperoncini, not brown the eggplant and add capers.

Delicious! I couldn't find the ricotta salata on short notice so I substituted a mild feta. It was fairly simple to make, had nice body & balance & got rave reviews from dinner guests. I will definitely make it again.
