Amazing recipe, with a few modifications. First off, living in a dry climate, I decreased the amount of flour (just under 4 cups total instead of 4.5) and added 1/4 cup olive oil to the wet ingredients. I also added 1tbsp honey to the yeast to help it flourish. I followed the recipe from this point exactly as written until it came time to top. Not having a taste for olives, I omitted them and instead added basil leaves and finely sliced onion. I also found that due to climate differences, the top of the bread browned very quickly (almost burnt within 5 minutes of entering the oven) I lowered the oven temp to 425 and it came out perfect! I will definitely be using this (modified) recipe again!

Top-notch recipe! I thought for sure I had messed up because the dough didn't rise very much once it was spread out on the pan, but voila! Perfect focaccia; thick enough to slice in 1/2 for a gourmet sandwich. Only put olives on 1/2 as per picky husband's request.

Love this recipe, and it's so adaptable. I have made this recipe, and then also used the dough recipe for pizzas. This dough for pizzas, on a heated pizza stone in the BBQ make THE most delicious crispy crusts. I pre bake for 3 - 5 minutes and then add pizza toppings. For a bread recipe, this dough makes beautiful bread.

I have been making this recipe for about 5 years, and it's always a huge hit! I omit the olives - my kids don't like em - but sprinkle with coarse salt and rosemary. My family could eat nothing but this bread for a meal, and the kids beg me to make the "dipping bread", as they love it dipped in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

I used the dough recipe and rather than use olives and rosemary, added fresh herbs, red pepper flakes and sea salt. The dough itself turned out perfectly. I also split the dough in half and baked in 2 pie tins using the same bake temp and time. Worked perfectly. I will continue to use this dough recipe for many variations to come!

This bread was fantastic! I took some of the other reviewers' advice and kneaded in some of the olives and rosemary so they stayed in the bread better. I probably should have drizzled a little more olive oil over the top than I did, but it still turned out incredible - and I'm a novice bread maker.

The flavor was good since I mixed some of the olive oil into the bread, but the texture was so dense, not like focaccia at all. Next time I'll try a different recipe.

Delicious and easy. I followed the directions completely but should have added a bit more salt to the dough. Also should have made two smaller focaccias - mine was far larger than a large sized pizza and it barely fit on the cookie sheet! Used fresh rosemary, fresh thyme and sea salt on top - incredible!

Simple and delicious! I bake this (and just about all my breads) on a Silpat on top of an oven-safe cooling rack. It requires no oil on the bottom, and the crust is crunchy an uniformly browned.

I liked, but didn't love, this recipe. The preparation was a snap, but the final product, even with the dimpling and ample olive oil, had a texture a lot more like white sandwich bread than it did focaccia. Next time, I'll stick to the sage focaccia recipe in this website: I much prefer its sponge starter and resulting consistency.

had a cocktail party tonight and made 10 of these, with varied toppings, and grilled them directly on the barbeque, on low flame. people were eating them like crazy! easy and so rewarding--even for a large crowd.

My 10 year old son is learning how to cook so tried this recipe. It was easy to make, he did it perfectly with minimal supervision, and it tasted fantastic. We did not use olives (not a kid fav).

I made this today and it got rave reviews. The only thing I changed is, I used oregano instead of rosemary and added tomato slices on top. I also mixed some olives into the bread when i kneaded it the second time, as well as putting them on the top.

Excellent. You definitely can't be cheap with the amount of olive oil added to coat the bread before cooking. It makes all the difference.

Easy and wonderful. Definitely a keeper!! Pair with a ripe juicy tomato,fresh mozzarella, basil and good EVO. Buen Appetito

This was good, but it needs more olives or at least more salt. Next time, I will add sea salt to the top. Also, as other reviewers have noted, the olives and rosemary need to be poked into the bread, or they pretty much fall off. Great flavor though, and the texture was perfect, even after a few days (keeping it wrapped up).

I love this recipe -- have made it several times, and I'm now doomed to disappointment when I have focaccia at a restaurant. Decadent.

This was my first time making any type of bread with yeast, and it turned out very well. The instructions were easy to follow, although my baking time was more like 15-16 minutes rather than 20. As others suggested, I kneaded some rosemary and olives into the dough--I doubled the amount of rosemary but cut back on the olives. I also added some caramelized onions to the top and a light sprinkling of flaky sea salt. The onions got a little crispy but still tasted good. The texture of the bread is great and the golden top is delicious, but next time I might add a little more salt to the dough. (I like salt!) Has anyone tried this recipe replacing some or all of the flour with whole wheat flour? Did it work? I'd like to try that, so any pointers would be much appreciated!

Very nice & very easy. I poked in pitted Kalamata olives, frewh rosemary & sliced cherry tomatoes. Next time & will add garlic & perhaps goat cheese. Maybe some roasted jalepenos? I like spicy. I made 4 small rounds the size of small pizzas and shared them. Especially with my neighbour who gave me the cherry tomatoes & the rosemary!

like other reviews this was really easy. I made 2 "loaves" at once- didn't double, just made 2. I made one w/ the rosemary and olives and one w/ goat cheese and sage. came out great. Perfect adn deliciuos. The dough was really wet. I add about 7 cups total of flour! will definately make again.

I was really impressed with the ease of this recipe. The bread turned out crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Listening to other reviewers I sprinkled some cheese and garlic on top of the dough. I omitted the olives. I also used half as much olive oil, it still turned out great (my husband noticed the decrease in oil, but he proceeded to soak his bread in olive oil to compensate). Just delicious!

Fantastic. It was golden crispy outside and soft inside. I added some olives inside the dough and pressed a few before baking + sprinkled a bit of oregano. I also made one with cheddar and parmesan. I did not add rosemary. Dough was extremely manageable. Olive oil on baking sheet and on top of focaccia is a must. I also added about half of teaspoon of sugar and next time will add half a teaspoon more salt. I baked it on silicon-type pad (called a Silplat) so bread did not stick and baked beautifully.

The first time I made this it was unmanageably sticky and required an extra cup of flour to knead it. The second time I reduced the water by 1/4 cup and it worked out fine. I also kneaded half of the rosemary into the bread. The olives fell off the first time, so I gently incorporated them into the dough on the second knead. I tipped the bread with rosemary, 1/2 c shredded Parmesan, and some slivered onion. Heavenly!

I changed the toppings to fresh chopped garlic, dried herbs, and kept the full two tablespoons of olive oil on the bread. It turned out really well. I've made focaccia before with other recipes, but this was the only one that I think looks, feels, and tastes like the focaccia at restaurants. Also, I think my bake time was about 17 minutes, instead of the suggested 20 minutes.

My only problem was getting this out of the pan when it was finished cooking. It was so stuck I gorged the bottom a bit. I was told to take focaccia out of the pan asap or the bottom will get soggy. Could it be because I made it in a corningware pan instead of a metal pan?

Made this for a 4th of July gathering. Used rosemary from my garden, and a mixture of pitted Italian olives from the farmers' market. The only change I made was to add some shredded asiago. One suggestion, if you want to transport this dish, "push" the olives (gently) into the dough before baking. I am an avid bread baker, and this dough makes a beautiful sponge when you follow the directions exactly. Fabulous...this is a keeper!

This is a great standard focaccia recipe, you can substitute the toppings with your preferences, such as sundried tomatoes etc, and it is just as good. I would highly recommend this recipe, and look forward to making it again!!

This is awesome! My family doesn't care for olives so I sprinkled the dough with parmesan cheese and greek seasoning. Can't wait to make it again.

Great recipe. I've made it twice - once w/ rosemary and olives on top and once kneading them into the dough and putting extra on top for presentation - the latter worked best. Definitely press your toppings into the dough so they don't fall off. I also think a sprinkle of sea salt over the dough prior to cooking enhances the flavors nicely.

On the back of the other comments I doubled the olives and rosemary, incorporating half into the dough and putting the other half on top. Lovely.

Delicious! Everyone raves about it. I took the advice of previous reviewers and incorporated the olives into the dough. I also made it again and substituted 1 finely chopped small spanish onion and 2 finely chopped medium roasted red peppers. This made a sweeter focaccia good for those who are not olive fans.

I never knew it was SO easy to make this stuff at home...it came out exactly like in the restaurants! I skipped the olives entirely, I kneaded the rosemary into the loaf, and I sprinkled a little bit of sea salt on top just before putting it into the oven. Don't skimp on the olive oil! It's what makes the crust so rich and crusty...yummy!

I made this while visiting my daughter for Christmas and her wedding. Having previous experience with focaccia, I kneaded a little more than half of the olives and almost all the rosemary into the dough, then put the remainder on top as recommended. I made a point of pressing the olives into the dough so they would be less likely to fall off. I find the full amount of oil on top helps to keep the bread fresh and moist, especially if it isn't totally devoured at the first presentation.

This is a great recipe!! I've always been a bit intimidated by yeast breads but this was a cinch and so yummy. It does require 3+ hours from start to serving for the dough to rise but very little actual work. I can't wait to customize it with different toppings. Thanks to the cook in D.C. about limiting the oil. I don't have a mister but a light oiling of the baking sheet worked fine. And 1 T. on top was plenty. Keep an eye on the cooking time, most of my bread was perfect but one end was a bit too chewy. If I had left it in for just a minute or two more, it would have really suffered. I preferred it to be just barely brown not a deep golden brown.

We make this recipe without the olives so that kids like it too. It dissapears quickly!!!! We make it all the time.

Bravo to the review that said use olive oil spray or misto. That worked great and for my family I could use a little more rosemary and 1/3 to 1/2 of the olives because then their yummy saltiness would be a treat. Pushing them in is a great idea, too.

I've made this recipe to accompany a variety of Italian menus. It went particularly well with a tray of grilled autumn vegetables (eggplant, zucchini, peppers, portobella mushrooms, etc.) lightly dressed with olive oil and fresh garden herbs.

Very good, but a few tips. First, I found the amount of olive oil called for to be too much. The baking sheet could simply be misted with olive oil, and I only used one tablespoon of oil on top of the bread rather than two. Second, I would recommend pressing the olives and rosemary into the dough or else they will fall off after the baking is complete.
