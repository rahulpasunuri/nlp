I had never made meringues before and this was really easy to follow and easy to make. It took me less than 30 minutes to prep and make the meringues and pop them in the oven. I didn't have a piping bag but used a zip-top plastic bag and cut off one of the corners and piped tight spirals to make the rounds. I doubled the recipe and had room on my cookie sheet for five 5-inch rounds and still had some of the meringue mix left over! To save time, I didn't make the sauce. I used Hershey's syrup with cinnamon added instead. It was good, but next time I'll try the real deal!

I make this every valentine's Day. I form the meringues into heart shapes. The crunch of meringue with the cold ice cream and hot sauce is deightful !! Easy to prepare ahead too..

I only made the sauce, which is terrific. The first time I made it, I had a little trouble with the butter separating (as I did not use the sauce right away, but saved it for the next day) The second time I made it, I cut the butter down to 2 tbs & it was just as good, if not better! I love chocolate & cinnamon. I may also try it with orange zest.

This was a big hit at a recent dinner party. Although it did taste GREAT, the best part was the fact that it could all be made ahead of time--perfect for entertaining.

Oh, Yeah Baby! This was very easy to make, and definitely more than enough for two! I made it for 3, and there was still heaps left over. I didn't put any cinnamon in the sauce either. This is a stylish dessert, that can be made completely in advance. Perfect dinner party food.
