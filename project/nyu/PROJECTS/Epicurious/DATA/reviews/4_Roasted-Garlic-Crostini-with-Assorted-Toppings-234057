We really enjoyed these crostini. Roasting the garlic made the spread subtle and buttery. I put the bread under the broiler as it wasn't toasting well and flipped to brown both sides. Will definitely make again.

I was looking for a method for roasting garlic and this was great. It's much simpler than other recipes I've tried and gave me just the results I was looking for. The only thing was some of the cloves ended up sort of burnt. I don't know if that's normal or if there's any way to prevent this such as roasting for less time or wrapping with foil. Any suggestions?

I will definitely make this dish again! My friends were impressed with the various topplings on the smoky garlic crostini served. They thought that I ordered them from the Deli caterer. A good choice of "canapes".

I cut the garlic roasting time in half by microwaving the garlic heads for a minute first in a ceramic garlic roaster.

Better yet, prepare the crostini with roasted garlic paste, then set out on a table with all of the assorted toppings on the side for guests to assemble as they wish. More fun, less work.

What a super party idea. Almost negates having a main course. Roasted Garlic is absolutely perfect for this.
