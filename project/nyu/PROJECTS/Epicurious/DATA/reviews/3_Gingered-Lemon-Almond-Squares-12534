Next time, I would add the lemon's zest and more ginger but I will definitely make these again. Yum.

these squares are amazing! my daughter made them for us the other week and they turned out great! with regards to the butter, i don't think it's so much a typo but just should have been spelled out a little more clearly; it should say "one 1/2 cup." for the readers that couldn't taste the ginger, perhaps theirs was old? my daughter doubled the amount as per the suggestions, and it was a bit too much. but on the whole, these are fantastic! definitely a step up from regular old lemon bars.

There an error in the ingredients. 1 stick of butter does not equal 1 1/2 cups. Should it be 1/2 cup? I used 1 cup because I knew the quantity was wrong. The crust didn't set up as well as it should have so I think 1/2 cup is the amount.

I used only 1 c. of butter for the crust and absolutely loved it. The thickness of the crust and the nuttiness was a perfect balance for the sweet lemony topping. Only thing was I couldn't taste the ginger!

1 stick of butter = 1/2 cup, which is what I believe was intended here. I thought this recipe would give an extra kick to the traditional lemon squares I grew up with. Not even close. Not enough lemon flavor, and though tasty on its own the crust overpowers this dish. A real disappointment.

These are lovely, have made them twice. One stick of butter (1/2 cup) is plenty for the crust. I also added a tsp of almond extract to enhance the almond flavor of the crust, and doubled the amount of ginger in the topping to 2 tsp to give it more zing! A winner!

I only used 1 cup of butter and and a half teaspoon of ginger and they came out great. The crust is very oily and moist, but after they sit overnight everything sets very well and they taste wonderful.

There is definitely a typo in the recipe with the amount of butter you add. I think there is double the butter amount that you need and should be about 3/4 cup. I don't think I got quite the right proportions and the crust was very oily and moist. I wouldn't try it again.

These lemon squares were very delicious and pretty....the ginger adds a little something extra.
