While not quite as light as a regular angel food cake and lacking in air pockets, there is definitely an ethereal quality to this cake and I really do love the spongy, almost homemade-marshmallowy texture. It was so easy to make. I will definitely be making it again.

This cake was wonderful. I don't know why others had trouble with it. If you follow the directions for the cake exactly, you'll end up with a lovely cocoa cake that is slightly denser than a regular vanilla angel food cake. It was like a pillow of delicious chocolate meringue cake. I used about 1.25 tsp of ginger (because I love ginger), and a little more than a tablespoon of vanilla. The glaze worked fine for me. I reduced the cream to 3/4 cup based on the reviews that it never hardened. It is necessary to use all of the icing sugar to ensure that it will firm up. I added a touch of instant coffee (about 1/4 tsp) to bring out the chocolate flavour. Don't skip the candied ginger at the end. It is beautiful and adds complexity to the cake. Enjoy. This is a great recipe.

The cake looked completely done, but wasn't - fell apart when I tried to remove from pan.

It took much longer to beat the eggs to soft and to stiff peaks, but when I took the extra time, it came out perfect! I used a fluted bundt pan, sprayed with Olive Oil Pam, cake slipped right out (was worried about an oo flavor, none to be found). The glaze worked fine for me, using reg 1/2 and 1/2, semisweet choc chips (no need for chopping then!), and the powdered sugar. As it cooled I just popped it onto the flame a few seconds more to thin it out. Although much more like an icing, its delicious!!!

I made this cake twice with mixed results both times. First, there is the issue of the pan. The recipe says springform or Bundt. Since this is an angel food cake and, by definition, does not use chemical leaveners, it should be baked in a tube pan. But trusting the recipe I used a springform the first time and the cake collapsed badly. I used a Bundt pan the second time. This was better but there is no way to line a ribbed Bundt pan with parchment. I buttered and floured the pan but still had some sticking. Note that the texture of the cake is much heavier than commercial angel food. The ginger flavor in the cake itself is extremely subtle. I upped the amount of ginger on the second cake to a full teaspoon and it was a little better. The other major issue is the glaze, as others here have mentioned. It is extremely thin as written. I recommend discarding this glaze recipe and finding yourself a good ganache recipe.

I think I over-beat the eggwhites and thus had trouble folding in the dry ingrediants my bad that the cake was not as light as it might have been but I followed the glaze instructions exactly and it was a disaster ... stayed soupy, never firmed up at all - would try this recipe again but definitely would reduce the amount of cream in the glaze by at least half

This is one of the best cakes ever. Very subtle cake flavor with the ginger on top to give it a bit of a kick. I made it as written except for making a slightly thicker glaze by reducing the milk and increasing the sugar. It was a big, big hit with kids and grownups at my party.
