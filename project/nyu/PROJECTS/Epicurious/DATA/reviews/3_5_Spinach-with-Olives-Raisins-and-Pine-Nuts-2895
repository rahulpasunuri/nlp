Made it with Balsamic vinegar, I'll try red wine vinegar next time or lemon juice. You have to make sure you have all the ingredients on your fork to make it tasty, otherwise if you just pick on the spinach (to taste in pan) it doesn't have flavor. It has great presentation colors!

I used this recipe with beet greens to accompany my La Puerta Garden Beet Soup and it was wonderful.

I did this recipe exactly EXCEPT I replaced the balsamic vinegar with fresh lemon juice. We liked it. I will make again.

Very easy and delicious. Not sure if draining the spinach is necessary.

The best spinach recipe I have ever tried. My sister-in-law, who is a fantastic cook said it could have been served alone and she would have been happy. My husband loved it and he is finicky, my brother loved it except, he said you could skip the olives. Don't hesitate to make this one, even if you don't have spinach loving guests, it is great!

Because it is cookedin oil, this is a wonderful dish for Hanukkah, or any special occasion. I especially like it because it goes well with any meat and it quite an elegant vegetable dish that cooks quickly. Be usre to use good quality balsamic vinegar.
