Although I loved the flavor of this ice cream, one out of 12 guests actually ate it. It must be eaten with a contrasting dessert such as Rhubarb pie or ginger spice cake. Most of my guests just wanted ice cream alone and the flavor was too much for them.

I did NOT like this recipe--all the other reviews were raving. The Buttermilk was too much, it made the ice cream taste metallic--a good description would be sour, but it was metallic. One guest out of 9 liked it--the others preferred to have polite, small portions. I was very disappointed.

Delicious and tangy. We had this with sliced strawberries and it was divine. I will definitely be making this again.

really good and easy. took one reviewer's suggestion and doubled almost everything - kept it to 7 yolks (some of mine were medium sized) and didn't do a full cup of sugar. there was a very nice citrus-like tang to it. served with fresh berries. this is a new staple in our house.

This ice cream is a breeze to make and is really delicious. I only wish that I had made a double batch so that I could eat more of it before my company arrives tomorrow. Delicious!

Slightly tart and tangy. Unusual and delicious with a fruit crisp. My guests said it tasted a bit like cheesecake ice- cream. I will make it regularly.

Don't fear the buttermilk! I doubled all the ingredients except the egg yolks and got a generous quart of ice cream. My sister described the taste as "cheesecakey" and utterly delicious. Next time I would use a bit less sugar to emphasize the buttermilk "tang".

You could not get me to drink a glass of buttermilk, but this ice cream is fantastic. Clean, slightly tart, and not as heavy as vanilla type ice creams. A real surprise. So easy to make it will be in my freezer often.

Very popular...I have made this twice and never told anyone the flavor right off---Let them guess! Not too sweet and best paired with the rhubarb-raspberry compote recipe on this site.

The buttermilk mixture and ice cream tastes great. Because I was making it to go with a blueberry tart, I swirled in some blueberries that had been boiled with sugar and cornstarch. I would not advise doing this because the blueberries have a very icy texture when frozen and do not mesh with the ice cream.

A surprisingly great ice cream! It's definitely an ice cream we would make again. The buttermilk flavor is very very bright (and for some reason, even slightly fruity) so definitely something for buttermilk lovers. Rich and different. We made it to eat on its own, though we would imagine it would taste great with a strawberry dessert.

Fantastic. Different, but great. I'd make it again.

Delicious! I made this and served it with Rhubarb Crisp (as recommended by the rhubarb crisp recipe) and it was the perfect compliment. I can't imagine plain vanilla coming anywhere close after tasting this combination.

A wonderful compliment to a gourmet meal
