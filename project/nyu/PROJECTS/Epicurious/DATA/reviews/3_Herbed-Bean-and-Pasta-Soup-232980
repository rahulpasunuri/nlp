I found this recipe to be delicious and easy to make. The herbs impart a fresh flavor that works in warm or cold weather. I cleaned my bowl and would make it again.

A gloriously flavorful soup that I make at least once a month.

Given the list of ingredients, it's not surprising this soup is extremely bland.
