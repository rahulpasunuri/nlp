Lovely, fragrant, healthy stew. Used mahi pieces and head-on shrimp to add flavor. Also substituted home-made chicken stock for the water. Delicious with a french Sancerre.

This was a very simple soup to make. it was very flavorful. I used shark only and it was very good. In the future I would plan for this to be an appetizer rather than an entree.

Very good basic recipe. I added a tablespoon of chopped fresh rosemary and a teaspoon of chopped hot peppers. Also substituted vegetable broth for water. Made it a more flavorful dish. I used striped bass (also known as rockfish in the Chesapeake Bay area) and it was great, but any flaky white fish would do.

This recipe represents purity in cooking. For such a few ingredients to present a fresh, healthy and complex flavor is a testament to the Sicilian way of cooking. I make this for my family about once a month and for friends who are not fish lovers and everybody loves it. I do think that it is important to use at least 2 kinds of fish - one flaky variety and 1 firm variety. That way the flakier one helps provide a little mor body to the soup.

I thought this was really good. The recipe is so simple, it invites innovation. I used Italian parsley as the herb (although I can imagine using many others); and I added carrots and zucchini to the tomatoes, to give it some additional veggie heft. I added some vegetable stock powder, Tabasco, and a touch of salt. For the wine, I used an inexpensive Pinot Gris. The recipe doesn't say when to add the fish, but I would definitely add it toward the end, maybe 10 minutes before serving; the rest of the stew/soup can simmer for 30-60 minutes.

I was dubious about using water but did it anyway - and it was subtle, bordering on flavorless. Threw in a few veg bouillon cubes to save it. Other than that, I made it with tilapia, shrimp, squid and a few cockles, plus zucchini and some fresh corn at the end. Delicious!

Loved it. Super simple and surprisingly flavorful. I used 4 tomatoes instead of 1, and would definitely do the same again.

This turned out great (a bit of a suprise considering I used about 4 pounds of freezerburnt mystery white fish). I sauted leeks and carrots seperately with dill seed and added them at the very end to prevent overcooking. I substituted the tomato with a well-drained 28oz can of diced tomatoes.

I make a similar stew with clam juice, leeks, fennel, red pepper, and grated orange peel which is superb. I've made this recipe once and will definitley make it again. Of course, fresh is best, but I would consider it as a pantry dinner using frozen fish, canned diced tomatoes and frozen herbs.

A little bit of parmesan was good with this quick easy recipe.

This dish was a HUGE hit with my guests. I took all the advice of the others from adding the veggies (used roasted zuchs and carrots), using shallots, and multiple types of fish (used 2lbs of mixed scallops, shrimp, clams, cod, and Halibut). Fresh tomatoes kept it light and the wine adds nice flavor. At the last minute I added a little saffron which really rounded out the dish. To the previous reader, the fish can be added when you add the water.

This dish turned out great. I decided to add canned tomatoes, no juice, cut up instead. I also added red pepper flakes, 1 tsp of oregano and a few more veggies (peppers/zucchini/fresh spinach). I used cod and shrimp. I thought it was a refreshing change from my usual fish dishes. Hubby loved it too. Served with Toasted Focaccia drizzled with olive oil and rubbed with garlic. This hearty bread went perfect with the broth

I am sorry, but for use newbies this recipe does not indicate when we are to add the fish to the dish.

I don't know why there is so much enthusiasm for this. For starters,it's a soup, not a stew, and is very predictable - wine,garlic,tomatoes; one can taste it from the recipe - the usual Italian mix. I threw in some shrimp and bay scallops with the cod and haddock. It was fishy...that's about it.

Rating: 3
Variations on this dish got me through the winter! The parsley is really key. Keep a bunch in the freezer, then bang on the bag when you need chopped parsley. No need to chop. Just grab a handful! I've also added various shellfish, and red fish. All are fantastic. A little cayenne helps a lot too. My favorite!

Rating: 4
This dish was simple, delicious, and so easy to make. I did follow the advice of former epicureans. I doubled the garlic and tomatoes, used more liquid, substituted fish stock for water, and added a couple of anchovies and peperoncini with the garlic. I also reduced it for a few minutes before adding the fish, which I barely had to cook. It's a great base recipe and turned out even better than I expected. I will definitely be serving to company.

Rating: 3
This was pretty good but don't expect anything really unique. It's just your basic tomato sauce with fish. I used cod. I didn't have fresh tomato so I used canned diced tomatoes. I also didn't have parsley so I used a bit of dried oregano. Came out great. I thickened it all up with a cornstarch slurry and served it over pasta. My husband loved it.

Rating: 4
Took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and used leeks instead of onion. A great substitution. Also used smoked baby clams along with orange roughy and mahi mahi. I also used one large can (28 oz.) of roma tomatoes and included about 1/2 cup of the tomatoe juice. Substituted fish stock for the water and used 1-3/4 cups. Upped the wine to 1-3/4 cups too. And finally, I added about 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes (what would you expect from a Southwest cook?). Really tasty and just mildly spicy. A hit all the way around.

The list of ingredients seemed dangerously bland but I prepared the dish without changes or substitutions and thought the result was delicious. I agree with those who say it's a tasty starting point for variation and experimentation. A keeper.

Very versatile, great for easy substitutions or improvisations. I used snapper and chopped clams, canned San Marzano's, no water, all wine... Added two extra (smallish) garlic cloves, a bit more onion than called for, a full cup of parsley, plus extra for garnish if desired.... plus a lot of salt and white pepper. Turned out hearty and pleasant. Served with pesto or fresh grated parmesan as a stir-in if desired, plus a steamed artichoke and some excellent local rosemary-olive oil bread. And the rest of the wine, of course. ;) An excellent supper.

I used only codfish, subbed the white parts of three leeks for the onion, added a few extra cloves of garlic, and increased both the water and wine by about 1/2 cup each because I wanted more broth. I forgot the tomatoes, but it came out delicious anyway. Served with hot, crusty bread. Yum!

This is a great recipe; very easy to make, and it tastes great. It is also very flexible because I didn't follow the recipe exactly but it still came out really good, so this is a great one to experiment with. I will definitely make this again.

I make this often. Everyone just loves it. I really don't change this one too much, except that I increase both the water and the wine. I have, on occasion, just made with cod and it is still outstanding. The reason for increasing the liquid is to have more to soak up with some yummy french bread!

Rating: 3
Very tasty. I added no water and more wine and used a large can of good quality Italian tomatoes. I may try adding the clam juice next time. Used oregano instead of parsley (picky husband) and more garlic. I love the idea of artichoke hearts, capers or olives, but since my family likes none of those things, we may try adding potatoes next time (hardly Sicilian at all, I wouldn't imagine) to please those who wanted more of a "stew" stew. Serving it in a bowl over a substantial pasta came to mind also.

Really lovely and easy recipe. I followed it precisely, though doubled the garlic and used both wine and sherry. Used fresh tuna, tilapia, salmon, squid and shrimp, baked a couple of loaves of French bread -- mmmm, yummy!

I also added capers, and some chopped up artichocke hearts. Be careful not to overcook the fish. I cut mine too small, and the fish was very well done. Next time, I'll add all the ingredients except the fish, and cook it down a bit, then add the fish last.

Delicious basic recipe. I also added capers and black olives and some extra parsley at the end. I used three medium tomatoes; surely one medium tomato will not make one cup.

This is a fine base recipe that just needs a little tweaking. For the same 2 pounds of fish (I used Hake), I doubled the called for amounts of onion, garlic, & tomatoe and added about 1TB fresh thyme. I used slightly more wine and 1/3 cup less water. It is important to use a good white wine and also to season generously with salt& fresh ground pepper.

Hearty, delicious and VERY EASY. I added frozen peas for variety and increased the wine. I think next time I'll add some spicy sausage or chicken.

It's a great dish, but I couldn't help adding two ingredients. I followed the receipe to the tee and used the amounts listed. When the fish went in I added a 25 ounce jar of Emeril's Roasted Garlic Pasta Sauce and 1/8 teaspoon of crushed pepper flakes. Salt to taste. Don't be a purist and have fun playing with the receipe.

This recipe has quickly become a standard at my house. It's very quick and easy and besides the fish, it calls for ingredients that are usually already in the pantry or fridge. And for being so easy, this dish is absolutely delicious. The stew, a salad, and a loaf of bread make a great weeknight dinner.

I first made this about a year and a half ago - at the time, I was capable of burning water. It was simple and delicious. Since then, I've made it often and it's always been great. I've used all different kinds of fish and have switched from white wine to sherry for a richer flavour. Enjoy!

Buon appetito. This was wonderful. I improvised a bit using what I had in the house. I had bought fish from the frozen food section that was seppie, polipo, calamaro, gambero, mitili (cuttlefish,octopus,squid,shrimp, mussels)in a 16oz. bag. Since, I had only made half the recipe, I adjusted the ingredients accordingly, except for the garlic, parsley and tomatoes. I had a can of DelMonte Italian style stewed tomatoes with all the seasonings. So very low in fat calories; I am ready for another cup!! Served with a nice slice of pane toasted to soak up the broth. Hmm Hmm Good

I have made this recipe several times. Super-easy, and delicious, and very versatile too. Scallops or shrimp in place of some of the fish worked out well. Definitely increase the parsley and add some anchovies. The biggest plus: very fast (especially if you have your fishmonger cut the fish into chunks for you!)!

This stew/soup was a hit -- but I added lots of extra garlic (how can anyone ever taste garlic in recipes that call for so little? really?), some more parsley, and quite a bit of salt and freshly ground pepper.

For what this recipe is supposed to be, it is great. It is not supposed to be a cioppino or a frutti de mar or that, it is just a simple poached fish soup (zuppa) and as such it is beautiful in the simple way the Italians have with food. You take a simple chicken noodle soup, say, and start adding this and that and more of this.....pretty soon you end up with a minestrone or something.....'nuff said!....:)

super-easy recipe. I followed most of Peter Colosi's suggestions, and I imagine the undoctored recipe would be pretty bland. Next time I think I would add even more wine and tomatoes (for flavor) and even less water (to make less watery).

What a great recipe. I'm heading for Italy and Sicily in June and wanted to fix something to celebrate the scheduling of our trip. I agree that clam juice makes for a stew with more depth. We also melt a few anchovies in with the onions and garlic. It has become a family favorite at our house.

Coming from a Sicilian/Mexican family, I altered the recipe slightly to fit our tastes and to punch it up a bit. I made the recipe with 1 lb. of halibut and 1 lb. of bay scallops with the following modifications: I used 4 tomatoes instead of 1, a whole bunch of parsley (approximately 2-3 cups chopped), 4 cloves garlic, 1/2 lb sliced mushrooms, 1 cup Chardonnay (not the fruity/yuppie kind) and 1 cup water, and approximately 1 teaspoon each Mexican oregano, thyme, and crushed red pepper. The spices were added with the tomato. The scallops add enough "fishois" to the broth that the use of fish stock or clam juice is unnecessary (and probably undesirable). Next time I plan to make the same with a more oily fish and clams or mussels (I would add shellfish to the above recipe also to improve the complexity of the broth and to add salt). All and all, a great recipe. Peter Colosi

It lacked depth of flavor, was somewhat watery. If I were to make it again, I would use bottled clam broth or fish stock instead of the water,and use more tomato, perhaps with some fresh shredded basil in addition to the parsley.
