Made this with fresh-brewed decaf coffee and excellent cocoa. It was initially quite bitter (even though I like bittersweet chocolate) and I needed to add a great deal more sugar just to achieve a lightly sweetened, very dark chocolate flavor. After increasing all the other ingredients too, except for the cocoa, it made a delicious sauce. In the future, I would start with half the amount of cocoa, then add more gradually to taste. I like that this makes a rich chocolate sauce using relatively little fat.

this is a great chocolate sauce to accompany....anything! the texture and the taste area excellent and i used espresso coffee instead of water. i served it with the "easy chocolate cake," from the september 2003 issue (not on the web). the cake is a great, moist cake. i baked it for 45 min. instead of 50 min. and it got rave reviews -- especially served with this warm sauce.

Very easy and adds such a professional touch to a dessert. I made it at someone elses home and did not have my pastry bag handy. I put it in a ziplock bag and cut the corner and zigzagged it over a chocolate cake with ice cream. It was great.

Excellent sauce, I always burn sauces or they turn out lumpy, this was easy. Very dark chocolate flavor.

An excellent chocolate sauce. Not too bitter or sweet and (if you use a good quality cocoa) a real intense chocolate flavor. Used plain water but will surely try with coffee to see the difference. Also excellent cold.
