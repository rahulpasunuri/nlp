Quick, easy, and delicious. I used frozen corn, and it came out great

Tastes like summer! Please don't use canned tomatoes or frozen corn and then criticize this recipe: it should ONLY be made in the summer, to showcase vine-ripened (preferably heirloom) tomatoes and fresh FRESH corn, cut off the cob right before sauteing. This is essentially, "fresh tomato salad with sauteed fresh corn in it". WONDERFUL.

I've made this 3 times in the last couple of months and everyone raves about it! It is so simple and so delicious at this time of the year . . . even in California!

Using fresh corn makes a big difference with this recipe- I've made it both ways. It's good with frozen corn, but with fresh it is absolutely delicious. I admit that I added extra butter.

I found this really salty (maybe because I used canned corn?) but it was good. Although it didn't keep very well for the next day. I don't think it's worth trying to do again though.

This is fantastic....IF you are making it in season with local sweet corn and tomatoes from your garden. If you make this with grocery store vegies it is bland and not good. It goes great with the Balsamic Glazed Baby Back Ribs.

I like the simplicity and ingredients, but the end result was pretty dull. I will not make this again.

Because I love highly seasoned foods and probably have an overstimulated palate, I was underwhelmed by this dish. Were I to make it again, I'd use 1/2 to 3/4 cup of chopped red onion in place of the scallions, toss in a clove or two of minced garlic, and if that didn't liven things up sufficiently, stir in some chopped cilantro and parsley right before serving. (Admittedly, these tweaks would make for a very different salad.)

This recipe is great with fish. The ingredients are something I always have on hand. I used Del Monte Summer Crisp corn which gave the dish extra crunch.

Yum, this was delish! Easy, flavorful, I served this with white clam quesadillas.

This was really good, everyone enjoyed it. I will try with olive oil in place of the butter next time, just a personal preference.

This was delicious and I think the butter is what really makes this special. Hubby doesn't like raw tomatoes, so I made recipe as is except I let it cook awhile after adding tomatoes. Yum!

I have had this recipe for a month and have made 4 times so far. THIS IS A KEEPER!

This is outstanding! Tried it tonight in prep for 4th BBQ with adults only--made exactly per recipe. Don't like to serve corn "on the cob" in dinning room. Based on previous reviews, did a trial run tonight. Never had this combination of flavors but--believe me--it is great! Aside from which, it can be done well ahead of time for dinner party p.s. As other reviewers said, make some extra corn--I also had a hard time not eating up bunches of the corn before dish was finished. Enjoy!

Tape this recipe to the inside of your pantry or cupboard because once you try it you won't stop making it for a while. Imagine - a delicious dish that takes mere minutes to prepare. My wife had three helpings.

I can't count how many times I made this salad last summer, and am so glad fresh produce is coming so I can start making it again. I would echo all the other comments about this salad - how it is amazing how something this simple can be this good! I'll also add that my nephew and his wife - not big vegetable eaters - couldn't get enough of this salad. I think it it sure to be a hit for you!

So delicious and easy to make! Fresh sweet corn really plays well against the tangy dressing and tomatoes.

seriously, there's some sort of alchemy going on here. go get some good fresh corn and make this, it takes just a minute and is an absolutely delicious side dish. i make extra, because as noted by a previous reviewer, you're going to be eating it way before it makes it to the kitchen table.

Excellent recipe, especially in late summer when corn and tomatoes are at their best. I found that it needed a bit more olive oil and vinegar if the ears of corn are large. Added a little fresh chopped basil and thyme for extra flavor. Also added crumbled goat cheese.

We cooked the corn according to the directions, and waited to combine it with the tomatoes until the rest of dinner was ready. At that point, I ate some of the corn by itself and thought that it was just the most amazing thing ever. I have no idea how such a simple thing could be so delicious, but it was. I refrained from tossing my corn with the tomatoes because I thought that the corn was just so perfect by itself. My boyfriend tossed his corn with the tomatoes and liked it that way, as well. I have every intention of simply sauteing fresh corn this way in the future. Many times.

I made this dish for my family and they loved it. I made it again for a summer party that I had with friends and everyone absolutely loved the dish and asked me for the receipe! Great alternative to roasted summer corn.

Made this for a BBQ, and it got rave reviews. I can't think of a better recipe for peak corn & tomato season. Yum.

Simple and simply delicious! I used part tomato and part grape tomatoes. It was just wonderful. I'll repeat someone before me, summer in a bowl.

Summer in a bowl! Just a lovely, easy dish. We at it with a big plate of heirloom tomatoes, bread and goat cheese. Perfect.

For what it is I had to give this 4forks. It is so simple and the result is so fresh and flavorful. I even used thawed frozen corn and it was great! Nice summer side served at room temperature.

I made this as written but it seemed a bit bland, like it needed some extra something. So, I added about 2 tablespoons of fresh herbs from the garden (oregano, lemon thyme and basil). That did the trick. Very good along side roast pork with the green beans with sweet onion vinaigrette from the same edition.

WOW! My husband made this with a pork tenderloin and I LOVE THIS!!! The next time we will serve this with a cornmeal, green onion crusted salmon. I can taste it already.

Amazing - I live in PHX and this is perfect for those hot summer days (and nights!) when you want something light and cool. It is also hearty enough to really be a meal and good enough to stand alone! Delicious blend of flavors and easy to prepare.

A friend brought this over for a 4th of July cookout -- My husband and I fought over the tiny bit leftover the next day!!! It was fabulous. I just made it to take to a party tonight -- super easy, yet surprisingly interesting and complex flavors.

Simple to make and tastes wonderful. It was the perfect summer salad for the 4th of July- had rave reviews from everyone.

Very tasty, simple and fresh. I made this for a 4th of July BBQ and it received many compliments. I cut way back on the green part of the scallions as what the recipe called for seemed to be a bit much.

Very refreshing. I followed the recipe except I had 6 rather than 8 ears of corn. The ingredients are simple but it turned out surprisingly flavorful. I served with some crackers and it was fantastic.

I made this pretty much as written for a barbecue party and it was a big hit. Super easy. I used canned peaches and cream corn, as it is still a little before season, and it worked great.

Rating: 3
Delicious! Cut the amount of butter and oil called for in half, and it was very tasty. This recipe didn't say how much it yields in terms of servings. After making it, I would say it makes about 8 healthy sized side dish servings.

This is delicious, so simple and very tasty. I served it last night at a dinner with 9 teenagers-they loved it! It is a keeper.

I was looking for something simple to show off my vine ripened tomatoes and freshly shucked corn. This looked like just the thing. It wasn't. There was a slightly funky taste. Maybe it was the scallion... sorta "eh" dressing. It was just not perfection and it should have been. I won't make it again.

Wonderful, easy dish for a light summer meal. Made it this weekend for friends and everyone wanted the recipe. This is a recipe we will enjoy all summer while corn and tomatoes are in season.

This is delicious and very easy to make. Can't wait to make it again in a few weeks when our local tomatoes are ready.

Served this dish with the green beans and sweet onion vinaigrette and the two together were loved by all. Also served the lemon potato salad from this same issue replacing mayonnaise with a little olive oil and it was yummy too. Made them all to serve with a classic BA recipe for trip tip with red wine barbecue sauce and carmelized onion. Delicious summer meal.
