there are a few things I noticed about this recipe. It is not the traditional way that they make it in Lebanon for a few reasons. If you are going to call a recipe "Lebanese", then make it the way they make it there. First of all, there is no boiling hot water for the bulgur, nor does it need to be cooked in any way. You soak the bulgur in COLD tap water for 15 min or until all the water seems soaked up. Once you measure the bulgur dry, you add only enough water just to cover-no more than that. You get the bulgur from a middle eastern market and it never comes with a seasoning mix, nor do you add any seasoning or spices to it except salt and pepper. no garlic, no cumin, no anything else. second, the traditional way is to add green onions your recipe does not reflect that. third, there are no cucumbers in the traditional recipe. fourth, you do not use flat leaf parsley. you use regular parsley and it needs to be finely chopped very carefully so as not to make it mushy. lastly, the measurements shown above of lemon juice, olive oil, mint and onions can vary according to taste. You always add less of the liquid ingredients and taste as you go, just as any chef would do. I prefer a bit more tomatoes, mint and bulgur in mine, however, the ratio of ingredients should always be the largest with the parsley. do not give in to the temptation to violate the traditional way of making this. Try it and you will see that the success of the reciipe is in it's simplicity. I have made it so many times just the way I've told you and there is never a drop left at the party.

Great! I'd never realized mint was such a key ingredient in this dish. Per others' suggestions, I threw in a green onion and a bit of cumin, and those were nice additions. I used hemp seeds instead of the bulgur and that was nice, too. I'll definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe for a great meal. I've made this 6-7 times and every time, I think "Wow, this is GOOD!" The past couple of times it was even better because I actually bought fresh mint for it, rather than using dried. Very easy to make, fresh, great taste, crowd-pleaser. I brought this to a chili cook-off at work and a lot of people told me they liked it and it went well with the spicy chili. All in all, very glad to have had this from Epicurious, one of my favorite recipe sources for many, many years.

Super easy and tasty!

I don't recall Taboule as such. The Taboule I eat has no cucumber and much more parsley than here (it will be thus green with these beautiful red tomatoes small pieces). Also the bulgur is eaten without mixing with boiling hot water, thus it will keep its crunch.

It makes a nuttier tasting tabbouleh to brown the grain in sparse olive oil, stirring all the while, then adding water to simmer, then lots of lemon. I also add corriander and honey. When you brown bulgur, it kind of 'pops' like popcorn does. Also, adding balsamic vinegar just to taste is wonderful too.

I wasn't sure about the cucumber, but tried it anyway. Added half an onion (diced) and then substituted whole wheat berries instead of bulghur and increased both the lemon and olive oil. For a little extra lemony flavor, I sprinkled the top with a little lemon zest (a few strokes with the microplane ought to do it). Maybe it's cheating to review this recipe, but it seems to stand up to tinkering :)

hi all. i am lebanese from beirut. authentic Tabbouleh does not have cucumbers and the burghol portion is way too much. the olive oil and lemon juice are inadequate...

I make this regularly. It is possible to find packaged bulgar where I shop, so I use that an follow the recipe here. I don't like it with so much parsley, so I only use 2 bunches. We like our taboule tart, so I always add more lemon. Love this recipe.

I don't care for tabbouleh where the wheat is the dominant ingredient. I used 3 bunches of parsley leaves and 1 bunch mint. I also added double the lemon juice. One key I think to any tabbouleh recipe is the olive oil. I used Lebanese olive oil. Rich and delicious! It was a big hit at a Middle Eastern themed dinner party.

I liked this recipe a lot. I added a tsp of cumin and I thought that really made the dish.

I've never been a huge fan of Tabbouleh as it feels like eating chopped parsley. This recipe was pretty good however, and I should have added cumin as suggested. I thought there was enough lemon juice and there wasn't too much parsley.

Turn out very good. I left out the olive oil for diet reasons, still tasted great! Next time will use more bulgar and a little less parsley.

Have liked this recipe for many years,...have also added feta to this and it's very tasty. Also added more lemon.

This is such a tasty recipe. Per what others have suggested, I would add a tsp. of cumin, and a couple green onions are a must. Besides that, a great dish.

I have been making this recipe (basically) for the last 15 years, since I tasted it in Albuquerque, NM.

I added more lemon juice.

I used juice of 2 lemons and 5 T. olive oil. Went perfectly with lemon-dill baked salmon for Easter dinner.

As an old tabbouleh fan I was glad to see this recipe. I made it a few times, deleting the cukes, keeping amount of bulgar the same and adding a bit more oil and lemon. One ingredient missing in my opinion, is cumin. I added almost a teaspoon to the dressing and it really improved the depth of the dish.

Very good with a few modifications. As others have already said, this recipe needs more olive oil (4-5 tbs) and more lemon juice (2 lemons). I reduced the bulgur to 1/4c. but thought that this was too little an amount.

This is a great dish. Your recipe is good, but I agree with other reviewers & left out the cucumbers & used less bulgar wheat & more parsley. That's the way my Lebanese grandmother made it. It's more authentic, and it's better that way.

This is very similar to a fantastic recipe that my mother gave me from the January 1973 issue of Gourmet. That recipe makes a "dressing" of the olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper but also has garlic and a dash of cayenne pepper. Chopped scallions are also in the salad. Unfortunately, I have lost the recipe. Is anyone out there holding on to some real old back issues? P.S. My Lebanese friends all say the parsley to bulgar ratio should be higher but my American friends prefer it lower.

I made this exactly as directed and was pleased with the outcome. It was a colorful and fresh side dish that went well with grilled lamb kebobs. I am a parsley lover, but the rest of my family isn't quite so keen on the stuff, and they weren't enthusiastic about this dish. All of us agreed that there was a bit too much lemon, and I may have used a particularly sour one, but next time I will start with a bit less and only add more if necessary.

This was an excellent starting place for tabbouleh. I agree with the previous review - more lemon and oil - addded the salt and tomatoes just before serving and no cucumber. Lived a long time in the Middle East and this comes closest to what I remember, perhaps one needs to be a native to get it just right...

Being Lebanese we eat tabbouleh at least twice a week at our house, 1/2c burghul for 2 cups of parsley is too much, you need to decrease that to a 1/4cup. Also both lemon juice and olive oil need to be increased to about a 1/2 cup each, although lemon and salt should really be adjusted to one's taste. Cucumber should be eliminated altogether. Tabbouleh is usually served with romaine lettuce on the side or fresh grape leaves off the vine.
