I thought this was pretty good and it was easier than I initially thought it would be. I agree with other reviewers that heating to 300 degrees results in a somewhat burned taste. I tried to take it off the stove before it reached 300 but it ended up close. It was still quite satisfying though.

Thank you to the other cooks who warned me about burning. I took this one off the heat before it hit 300 because it was getting too dark. It got to 280, though, and that was fine. ***** I added a gentle dusting of paprika and cayenne to the popcorn, and I used flax and wheatgerm instead of nuts to make a teeny bit healthier. The spiciness contrasted perfectly with the sweetness. ***** The recipe says "kid friendly," but I would not let children make this. Too much risk of burning and serious injury! ***** A yummy, three-fork recipe that I would make again.

I agree with the folks who say this is a waste of good maple syrup. Mine turned out slightly burnt tasting, even though I used a candy thermometer and got the syrup to just under 300 degrees. Maybe the maple syrup is supposed to be healthier than traditional caramel with sugar, but didn't taste nearly as good. I used the "B" grade pure maple syrup from Trader Joe's.

I just finished making this and I have to say it worked out perfectly. I'm sure the sticky problem from some other comments is because they added coconut, which adds moisture, thus making your syrup sticky. I made a triple batch and it was amazing. The perfect texture and flavor. Worth every penny!!

Followed directions precisely and monitored my candy thermometer very closely after ~250 degrees. Mixture turned black in places and gave off a strong burnt smell starting at about 270 degrees. Removed from heat at precisely 300, but it was completely blackened by then. Tossed it over my popcorn anyway, remembering previous reviews, but the burned tasted was horrid and had to throw it all out. Won't risk wasting expensive ingredients on this recipe again.

I wonder if the moisture in the Seattle air might have affected the stickiness. Or maybe she put in coconut, like I did. I've made this a couple of times. The first time I added some coconut (the usual sweetened flakes) and, though delicious, it seemed to lose its crunch after a few hours and become somewhat sticky. The latest batch didn't have the coconut and remained crunchy. By the way, I attempted to make a half batch and the syrup mixture almost started burning before it hit 300 degrees. I caught it in time and it still worked, but I think I'll just do full batches from now on. I also added twice as many nuts from a can of mixed salted nuts. For first-timers with this recipe: Be patient with the thermometer. It creeps along till it hits 280, then almost zooms to 300, so watch it carefully. Wonderful, addictive stuff!

I had high hopes for this recipe after reading the other reviews. It did have superb flavor, but the texture was too sticky, even though I was careful to be sure the maple syrup mixture reached 300 degrees. I also made the "Caramel Corn Clusters" recipe from this website today, and they came out perfectly, so I don't think it was a problem with my candy thermometer. I'll still eat this one, but it's too sticky to give out for Christmas gifts.

Deliciously addictive. So easy, sooo good. Ran just shy of maple syrup, used a little Aunt Jemima, and microwave popcorn.

This was really good! Definitely will use this recipe whenever I want a sweet popcorn treat.

This maple goodness was delicious and addictive. I've made 4 batches in one week for Halloween and 4 year old bday party. EVERYONE scarfed it up. I think you could make some more popcorn to make it stretch and still tasty. Very easy to prepare takes but as earlier reviewed said watch it when it hits 280 because it spikes quickly. I used tons of Pam on aluminum foil (seemed easier). If you're looking for more affordable maple syrup try Costco/Trader Joes. A new family tradition!

HARDLY health food, BUT it was terrific using Smart Balance microwave popcorn (one packet makes more than 8C) and Smart Balance margerine (in place of the butter). I also mixed pecans and walnuts (definitely more than 1C) and, as described in another review, mixed it all in a paper bag.

Wow, this is incredible and you won't believe how easy it is as long as you have a candy thermometer. I wouldn't even try it without one. The hardest part is coating the popcorn with the mixture before it hardens. It also takes me quite a while to get the syrup up to the required temperature. Still, very little fuss involved for a treat that's better than anything you can buy at the store. I give this away at christmas and it is always a favorite, even with the poppycock fanatics in my household.

The first time I made this I think the mixture got burnt , but once you started eating it, it was so addictive, the initial burnt taste went away. The second time I made it, I watched it more carefully and cooked it to probably 290 degrees. I started to smell a burnt araoma, so I took it off. The results were a lighter color and more sugary coating. Both times this snack is still delicious. I think you really do need to stir it now and then. And once the temperature reads 275, the degrees rise rapidly. Next time, maybe it will be perfect, but I will rate it 3 forks for now.

Very easy recipe, but the taste was nothing special, considering the 1 1/2 cups of maple syrup.

One of those to "die for" recipes that takes so little time. I had to give the batch I made away to refrain from eating the entire tray.

I just tried this recipe after having tried the caramel pecan popcorn(yuk!!) This tastes much more like a caramel corn. It's not as sweet as the other recipe, also on this website, and it doesn't get as clumpy. I put the popcorn, the nuts, and I also added some coconut to a large brown bag. When the mixture was ready, I poured it into the bag and shook for several minutes before spreading into the pan. This makes it easy to get the mixture over all the popcorn. I am definitely going to make this for holiday presents this year instead of cookies.

I've made this numerous times - it's the best caramel popcorn recipe I've tried. I prefer to use peanuts instead of pecans. I tried drizzling chocolate over the popcorn, but that made it too sweet.

WOW! I made this as part of a chocolate and candy mixed christmas package and it was by far the easiest treat of the bunch. In fact it's probably the easiest treat I've ever made! I definately couldn't have gone without a candy thermometer and I ended up having to keep the mixture cooking for longer than the suggested time. Much better than any commercial brands I've had. My grandmother, who is addicted to poppycock, now prefers this one. Maple syrup might be expensive but this recipe is definately worth it for special occasions and makes a fantastic and incredibly simple gift.

This was ok, I wasn't overty impressed. I followed the recipe as outlined, including the use of the candy thermometer, however the taste seemed to have a burnt taste & smell in my kitchen. Another recipe that some might find more to their liking & that's easier on the pocketbook is: 'Caramel-Almond popcorn', also an epicurious recipe. This one uses light corn syrup & brown sugar as a base instead of maple syrup. One thing to add, I lightly salted (using popcorn salt, cause it's finer) everything during harding set-up, that way it had the sweet-n-salty taste just like Fiddle-Faddle from the store. Next time I'm going to omit the nuts all-together & just add the mixture to the popcorn. The nuts seem to get in the way. Enjoy!!

The three forks is entirely my fault. I made this twice today, but I didn't have a candy thermometer. I figured it would be okay because the other cook said it came out great. However, it turned out a tad too runny or a tad burnt. My suggestion is use a candy thermometer!

This is delicious. Took about 35 min for the maple syrup to go up to 300F. And so easy!! It does not make as much as I hoped. Definately not 10 cups maybe around 8 cups

I agree that this is a pricey snack! After making 3 times with Pure Maple Syrup and having fabulous results, I tried it with Log Cabin. It took a lot longer to reach the appropriate temperature (who cares, right?) and is almost just as good. It is a lot stickier than the original recipe, but still excellent! This recipe is a definite keeper, and I will continue to make it both ways.

Yummy. I made it twice in two days. The first time I pulled the 'caramel' off at about 280 degrees for fear of it burning. Bad idea since it was pale, lacked the hit of flavor I expected and was gritty. Letting it get to 300 degrees is imperative to accompish the color, flavor and texture. My taste buds can't give this the 4 forks that others did ie. that this is beyond compare. But it is easy, fast, delicious and makes a wonderful gift when put in a pretty package. Note: I thought this was a little pricey to make but it is a kind of indulgence.

This makes the best candied popcorn I've made! I use almonds instead of pecans. Unlike some of the other reviews, it took a lot longer than expected to get to 300 degrees, but it did get there. I just couldn't stop eating it.

I loved the coating especially on the the nuts and I was glad I doubled the amount of those-I used walnuts and pecans. I will never buy Crunch 'n Munch again and come to think of it no more microwave popcorn either! This was way to easy.

wow! I won't make it again because it is too good and we couldn,t stop eating it! I used microwavable popcorn (with butter) and turned out great. Didn't have thermometer and it took only 8 minutes boiling time (it started to burn!)...

This is an excellent recipe!! I had a dinner party with Germans, some Irish, a Dane, and a Finn, and all loved it! Anytime you have a recipe that crosses cultures like that, you know it's a keeper. But you have to bear one thing in mind: this caramel REALLY hardens and quickly. So if you get the caramel on any kitchen surface, clean it up immediately!

This is a wonderful recipe for the Holiday time to give as gifts. It was a moderately easy recipe and everyone raved about it! I will definately keep making this delicious treat!

Imagine, all these years that I didn't know I could make caramel corn out of maple syrup. I usually use a brown sugar/butter combo, but this was much more flavourful. I substituted walnuts for the pecans and hence had Maple Walnut Caramel Corn. It never reached the cooling stage before it was devoured. And yes, you can double the recipe but it will take longer to reach 300 degrees. Don't quit before you have reached the hard crack stage though, or you will not have such a lovely, nutty flavour. Try serving with fresh apple wedges. Great Halloween treat!

This came out very yummy, but it took longer than the 15-20 minutes listed to have the mixture reach 300 degrees. Does anyone know, would it be ok to double or triple this recipe
