I have made this more than a dozen times and I agree with reviewers, that as is, the cheese is bland. Thus, I mix into the cheese the juice of a lemon, and plenty of pink sea salt and freshly ground pepper, along with the walnuts. Makes a big difference. I also double the amount of pear.

I enjoyed this. Would actually make MORE of the marscapone mixture next time. The recipe overall seems to need a little extra something, but I found it interesting enough to go ahead an give it 3 forks anyway.

My husband and I loved this recipe. If you're careful with the dressing (i.e. don't go overboard on the lemon juice), the 3 flavors are very complementary: the pear's sweetness, the tartness of the arugula and dressing, the nuttiness of the cheese. I discovered that Mascarpone cheese is relatively tasteless and bland until something is added. Never knew that before!!

I won't fix this again because I have other arugula recipies I like much better than this one, perhaps because the cheese mixture was too bland. Was pretty though.

All of my guests loved this salad. It was simple to make and not a complaint in the house.

The cheese was too bland. The dressing and other ingredients were good, but overall just okay.

Excellent Dish! Heavy on the cheese factor though. My fiance made this dish and I thought it could do with about 1/4 the mascarpone cheese dip/sauce. Just to make it a bit lighter. But the dish was wonderful overall and I would definitely like to have it again.

Excellent dish. Flavors combine very well. I mixed the arugula with mache and made an entree of it, served with a crusty baguette. My husband loved it too, although he would have liked some meat too... Highly recommended!

An excellent easy to make, visually appealing salad. I found that field greens work as well as arugula in this recipe.

What a nice change from the every day hum-drum salad that I usually make with dinner. The only change I made was to use 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 walnut oil. The fact that I really like walnuts, this salad really suited my tastes.

Since I had no ripe pears, I substituted sliced strawberries, which were delicious. My guests loved the marscapone/walnut combination. I topped the salad with a red wine vinaigrette and some shaved Greek mezithra cheese. Delicious!

I really liked this recipe, but I changed the set up a little bit so that the flavours would complement each other better. I first set up the base as pear slices (I used a few pears for 4 servings), then I added the arugula on top, and then finally the mascarpone with walnuts on the very top. I thought that this turned out well because the pear added a nice fresh taste to every bite.

Very good salad, the toasted walnuts add a nice gentle flavor to the dressing.

The mascarpone and pears were delicious, but I wasn't impressed by the dressing. I might have been too free with the lemon juice, but it tasted too strong and didn't complement the arugula. I would make this again, but with a different dressing.
