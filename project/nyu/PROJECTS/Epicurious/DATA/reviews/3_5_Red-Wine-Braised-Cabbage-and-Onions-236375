My father-in-law said this was the best cabbage he'd ever eaten! It really is delicious. It's just a little bit of work for a tasty result; I definitely recommend.

This is the perfect Thanksgiving side dish - I compliments the turkey and stuffing perfectly! We have made it for four years now, and each time it has been a hit. It also makes your home smell delicious!

I wanted to love this recipe especially with the description of "becoming incredibly aromatic" and the "incarnation of mulled wine". It really was just OK. I made it exactly as written using good quality balsamic vinegar red-wine vinegars. After two hours of simmering it was certainly tender, but also pale and kind of watery. It just didn't have much flavor. I let it sit refrigerated for 2 days hoping it would develop a better flavor--I love red cabbage and wanted it to pop. I had planned to serve it for Thanksgiving, but it didn't make the cut. I"m on the lookout for a better recipe.

I was trying to replicate my friend's German cabbage recipe when I made this. It was just delicious and so easy. Even people who aren't fans of cabbage loved it.

Good. But, not outstanding. I made it two days ahead. Headed a smidge to taste the next day and decided that it needed something else. Added some golden raisins. That helped. But, still just good.

Delicious! The time it takes is worth every bite. Be sure to make enough for leftovers - it was even better the next day.

Red cabbage lovers take heed. This was wonderful! It has great flavor and is excellent the second time around. Yes, it takes forever to cook, but it is worth every second. (I served this with a Butter Schnitzel.)
