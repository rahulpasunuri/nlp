I rather like the bitterness of broccoli rabe. So I usually just trim it, give it a dunk in boiling water and drain.

I cooked the broccoli in advance as the recipe says is possible. I only gave it 3 forks because Broccoli Rabe has a strong flavor so this dish with no changes didn't appeal to everyone. I and half the family loved it, other half, not so much. Careful, don't overcook the garlic.

YUM YUM YUM! So easy and delicious. I added two shallots, caramelized them with the garlic, and sauteed the Rabe.

Made it exactly as written. Delicious with potato gnocchi and cider braised pork shoulder with caramelized onions. Yum.

I think maybe I just don't like broccoli rabe. The blanching helped but despite the garlic, the bitter unusual flavor of the broccoli rabe itself was more then I could take, as much as I wanted to.

yes, ma'am. this is good. i'd never prepared broccoli raab before and am so glad I did today, and so grateful for this recipe to have guided me. I used the stems, chopped small, let them boil a minute or three before adding the leafy part. I also may have had more than the recipe's quantity of raab so I added another clove or two of garlic for good measure. Yum. Don't skimp on the EVOO.

This was easy to prepare and very, very tasty. Blanching the rabe before sauteing really improves the texture of the stems which can be stringy. I'll be making this over and over again.

I made the mistake of trying to cram all of the broccoli into a medium sized pot because my big pot was occupied. As a result, the broccoli was rather underdone/tough. You really do have to pre-cook it a bit. Someone else mentioned that they just cooked the broccoli for a long time over low heat, but I would prefer to cook it over higher heat in order to brown it a little bit. I used more garlic and less olive oil, and I thought that this was a delicious side dish.

Absolutely amazing. Only had two small bunches of rabe, and had run out of olive oil, so used a few tablespoons of vegetable oil and butter, and used Hawaiian pink sea salt. This'll make you look at greens in a whole new way.

Simple and crisp greens, the way broccoli rabe should be cooked! Classic. My mom loved this dish, too.

This dish appealed to all of our guests equally and disappeared quickly! The garlic was a sweet contrast against the slight bitterness of the broccoli rabe. Have already made it again.
