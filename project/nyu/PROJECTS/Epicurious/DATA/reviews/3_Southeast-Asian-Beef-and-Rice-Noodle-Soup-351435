Excellent flavor in this beautiful soup. See my entire review on this and other recipes from Gourmet Magazine's February 2009 issue at: http://themomchef.blogspot.com/2009/12/southeast-asian-beef-and-rice-noodle.html

I love pho. This was an easy-enough recipe to follow, and I didn't have to search far to find the ingredients, which was a definite plus. The broth is very bland until you add the salt, hoisin, and sriracha - then all the flavors magically come together to create a pretty authentic tasting bowl of soup. With that being said, I don't think I would make this again. It's easier and cheaper to go buy a bowl at your local noodle shop.

I had to alter the recipe when I saw the price of the short ribs. My butcher suggested using stew beef. Thus I used the stew beef and beef shank and no ribs. PLUS I couldn't find star anise, and did without. This was probably why my broth was bland. My kids and I dressed it up with lime, scallion, fish sauce, and sriracha (lots) and then very much enjoyed this. Don't think I'll make this again as there are so many other noodle dishes that we love.
