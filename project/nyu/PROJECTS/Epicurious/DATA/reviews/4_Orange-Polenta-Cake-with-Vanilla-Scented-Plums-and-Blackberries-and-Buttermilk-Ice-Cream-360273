I've only made the cake. I recommend cutting back the butter to maybe 3/4 cup (it really doesn't need two sticks), but other than that, it's delicious! Make sure you heed the fine cornmeal requirement - I did, and didn't find the result the least bit gritty.

very good cake, but too gritty

The cake was a bit too sweet and gritty for my liking. The ice cream was great and the berries were good, but I think I'd save the vanilla bean for something more special.

this was fabulous- all of it- the cake- fruit and the ice cream. My kids and my guests raved about this dessert. super easy to make.
