This is a very good recipe  highly recommend, but you have to change the mixing instructions. Ive been making Mandelbrot for years and was out town and used this recipe to whip up a batch for work (they went over great.) When mixing the ingredients, cream the eggs and sugar together first, then blend in the oil. Sugar is considered a liquid, so by dissolving it w/ the eggs, you get a soft dough. I did reduce the point oil to 1/2C (what my regular recipe calls for) and youll not have any problem with the dough. Follow the rest of recipe. Enjoy!

Agree a little less oil makes it easier to handle, but chocolate chips! Peanut butter chips!!? This is mandelbrot after all. Quite good and non mandelbrot eaters dug in.

I've been making mandelbrot for many years and thought I'd try a new recipe. This is one I won't be saving. I followed the recipe exactly and the dough was way too crumbly. It never did form well no matter how much I worked it.

The amount of oil called for was way too much for this recipe. The "dough" was overly greasy making it difficult and messy to handle. I had to keep sprinkling more flour to make it manageable to work with. Other recipes call for 1/4 - 1/3 cup which sounds like the correct proportion needed. I reheated the sliced pieces for 6 minutes on each side rather than standing them up. The mandelbrot turned out crunchy and delish. I will make this again reducing the oil.

My mom bought freakin' jumbo chocolate chips! It was super hard to knead the dough, because they kept falling out. But, the cookies turned out really good. I think next time I'll try it with fruit or macademia nuts or something, but I probably won't make it if it's not for a special event.

20 years. My recipe is almost the same as this one, but I only use 1/3 cup vegetable oil; the dough is stiff but much less greasy, and makes a tastier cookie.

I found this recipe to be very easy and user friendly. I liked the basic dough and next time will add in dried fruit or peanut butter chips.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used regular-sized chips and I toasted the walnuts first. Everyone raved. However, the dough was SO difficult to work with -- greasy yet crumbly, and I could not integrate all of the chips and nuts in -- that I do not think I'll ever attempt it again. I'd certainly not add more oil, although perhaps adding a tablespoon or two of water might've made it easier to handle. It did remind me of that which my grandmother used to make.

Excellent! I will definitely make these again. However I recommend reducing the amount of chocolate chips to 1/2 cup and adding a 1/2 teaspoon of almond flavoring.

I found these cookies to be delicious and addicting every time I made them, as did the rest of my family. I found that I actually needed to add a little extra oil, since without it the dough did not stick together at all and was very difficult to handle.

I think these cookies are DELICIOUS! They're kind of rich and rather tender but I don't find them at all greasy, as the previous reviewer did. I used the cinnamon sugar topping which I sprinkled over the cookies in the first baking. I also used 4 medium eggs rather than 3 large eggs (they were on sale, what can I say). The extra liquid made the dough sticky, so I formed them into two logs strait away rather than kneading the dough. This gave the cookies a cobbled look which I find really appealing. Basicly I think this is a great cookie recipe.

There is too much oil in this recipe. Cookies were very greasy and a little too sweet.
