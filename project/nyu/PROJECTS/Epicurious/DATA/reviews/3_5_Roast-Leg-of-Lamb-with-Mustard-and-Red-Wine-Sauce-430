I don't want to rate this recipe because I only used the idea... but I used lamb chops instead of a leg of lamb. I cooked them at 500 for about 10 minutes and then broiled them for 3 or 4 minutes. It was delicious and very easy. After taste-testing the sauce, I added 2 T of unsalted butter to cut the saltiness; however, it didn't seem as salty when actually paired with the lamb.

Have been cooking for years. Have no idea the value of the whole mustard seeds.They would have been better if put in a blender. The "sauce" of a reduced concoction of wine, beef & chicken stock was overpowering to the mild flavor of the lamb. Would much prefer a "natural" gravy created from a "burn" in the roasting pan induced with rosemary and thyme along with wine & stock. Overall, this was a waste of time.

Wonderful recipe... I added more dijon and let sit in frig 1 more night. Very delicious! Served with a butter lettuce salad with balsamic vinaigrette, basil, pinebuts and shaved parmesan and a side of creamy mashed potatoes. YUM!

I made this for Christmas Eve and everybody loved it. BUT the leftovers were even better. I ground the leftover meat in the food processor, put it in a casserole dish, added one can of beef consomme. Topped that with corn and leftover mashed potatoes... It was the best Sheppard's Pie I ever had!!

I made this dish for Christmas Eve and everybody loved it. BUT, the best part was the leftovers... I ground up the leftover pork in the food processor, put it in a casserole dish, added the leftover red wine sauce and 1 can Beef consomme. Topped with corn and leftover mashed potatoes and it was the best Sheppard's Pie I ever had.

I made this recipe last year during the holidays, and am making it again this year! The lamb is delicious and the red wine sauce is one of the best I have tried. Excellent.

This was an excellent recipe. The lamb turned out very juicy and tender. I followed the recipe as stated. The only change I made was to make a roux out of 1tbsp butter and 1 tbsp flour. Then I added the reduction sauce to the roux and slowly simmered, stirring, until a thickened. The sauce compliments the lamb wonderfully. This recipe is superb.

Wow! What a fantastic delight for the taste buds. I was not a fan of lamb until I tried this recipe. I'm a bit of last minute kind-of-gal so I didn't marinate over night, only for about 3 hours, and still the taste of the mustard was exceptional. Will make this recipe again and again.

A great treatment for lamb. The mustard and garlic brought out great flavor in the lamb and the wine reduction sauce was fantastic. I found the wine sauce to be too salty even using low sodium beef and chicken broths. I will make my own next time without salt as per the recipe. I reduced to 1.5 cups then put in the blender to smooth out the diced shallots. Also, I took out of the oven at 117 degrees and let set for 15 minutes. It was a perfect medium.

Excellent recipe. My sauce was thick with the shallots. It didn't say to strain the sauce - it was so good. The mustard crust was fabulous. I roasted the lamb on convection and it was so moist and tender.

I've made this recipe a few times, and with not much experience with cooking lamb. It was fabulous - the red wine sauce is wonderful and one of the best parts of the recipe. I'm making it again this Easter. It gets great reviews at my table!

This was OMIGOSH good! I do not have a lot of experience with cooking lamb, but I can't wait to make this again. We did a small boneless leg on the grill. It took much longer for my sauce to boil down to 1 cup but that could be the whole boiling temperature at altitude issue. This recipe's a keeper.

This works so well BBQ spit roast style - forget about taking the bone out or trimming the pan - webber M off M around 2 hours and it is swooningly great

I'm a vegetarian but I'm writing this review based on the reaction of my guests (delicious!!) and based on the fact that it was really easy to prepare. I'd definitely do it again.

This recipe is an Easter tradition for my family. I follow the recipe except that I usually cut the leg of lamb into 3 or 4 pieces and grill it. Also, this year I substituted some passion fruit wasabi mustard we brought back from Hawaii for the Dijon mustard. Everyone loved it!

I love this recipe because and it is so great for company. With the sauce made ahead, it really simplifies life. I just made this for the second time. The first time I had homemade beef stock with no salt. This time I bought a box brand with 470 mg of salt per cup - low salt. This resulted in the sauce being bit on the salty side - on of my guests still asked for the recipe. I took the roast out at 127 degrees and let it sit to reabsorb the juices. It ended up being medium well to well - but still tasted delicious.

This will be the third time I've made this recipe - and husband asks for it every year. Whenever I try a different recipe for Easter, he always asks for this one again! Thought it was super easy to make. First time I made it was actually the first time I ever tried cooking lamb. Lamb was so tasty, it made me look like a pro! ha. Am making it again tomorrow, which is why I'm logged on... looking for the recipe again.

Just wonderful. For the paste I just used Grey Poupon and dried rosemary, and it flavored the lamb perfectly. The paste didn't really form a crust, and all the flavor of the mustard and herb went right into the meat, leaving a cooked paste that I just scraped off. The sause also had a wonderful intensity. Not only will I make this again, but I'm going to start cooking more lamb in general, especially when I can find leg of lamb for 2.99 a pound, like I did for this. Yum.

Also here, lots of 'best lamb I ever had' comments. I never had lamb I liked until this one. It's become an Easter standard now.

Several "Best lamb I ever had" comments heard at the table. Super easy and really good. Mustard crust seals in the juices and the red wine reduction is great.

This is an outstanding recipe. The sauce is a reduction - therefore, it is not to be thick. It is similar to a beef au jus. If you found the lamb pungent - blame your butcher for selling you a poor quality piece of lamb - not the recipe. We have made this many times with a great result every time. The only modification is - I cook the roast longer and slower - but that is personal preference.

Hi I just needed help with one area of this recipe. Well,it is the sauce. I followed each ingredient precisely and everything. My problem was that my sauce was not really "thickened" at all. I did reduce it to one cup. My sauce was was good but basically runny (watery). As directed, I used low salt broths (both chicken and beef) but the broth was also "Fat Free" I couldn't find low salt broth by itself without being fat free as well. Do you think this was why my sauce was watery? Or is this the way it was supposed to be? Thank you SO much. If anyone wants to write and help me,I would be very grateful Sincerely,Michael (elikas1@home.com)

Very easy, tasty recipe that will be a good substitute for an old favourite from Bon Appetit, Lamb Zinfandel. Next time,so that it spreads on the roast easier I will make the paste a bit thinner by adding a few drops of wine.

Served this at a dinner party. Like others, loved the wine sauce. I found the lamb too pungent for my taste. Perhaps it would do better butterflied & grilled. Guests served themselves. Did not hear the "mmm.." sounds I'm accustom to and many did not clean their plates (ouch!). Found the hype better than the actual experience. Not worth the expense & effort - unless perhaps you really, really like lamb.

This was really easy, and delicious! I made it for a small dinner party and it was a hit. The sauce is excellent. I left out the additional salt before roasting, and it was perfect.

Excellent recipe for dinner party. Leaves the hostess plenty of time to mingle. A zip lock bag for marinating is neater and less cumbersome than plastic wrap. Have made with Pinot Noir, which is also good.

This recipe was a cinch to make and the lamb was delicious. I made slits in the lamb and stuffed in slices of garlic as well. Yum! Unfortunately, I seasoned the lamb with salt and pepper as recommended, just before putting in the oven, and that sent the salt level way over the top! Needless to say, my gravy was too salty! I thickened the gravy as well.

This recipe was a definite hit at our Easter celebration! The mustard coating was the perfect complement to the flavor of the lamb and the wine sauce finished it off perfectly. Nothing about it was difficult and preparing it a day ahead just made Easter day that much easier.

This received rave reviews as centrepiece of our Easter dinner. Perhaps it was the wine I chose but the sauce when reduced was still thin and tasted nasty. I hastily made a roux and turned the watery wine sauce into a fabulous wine gravy, incorporating the pan juices. I shall make it this way in future. Its definitely a repeat recipe.

I made this lamb for Easter dinner and it was fabulous. The red wine sauce was incredibly delicious - the best thing about the dish was that most prep was done a day ahead.

The Lamb lovers immensely enjoyed this recipe. Letting the leg marinate in the fridge overnight in it's "mustard" cover cut down on time in the kitchen they day it was served.
