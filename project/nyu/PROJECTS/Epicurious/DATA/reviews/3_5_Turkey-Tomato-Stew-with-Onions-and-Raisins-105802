Following the advice of "A Cook from Mount Pleasant" in another review, I made this a second time using Garam Masala that I had made and stored some months before. I let the works simmer for a few hours to let all the flavors do their thing, including some salt and about a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice with Cardamom (similar to Trader Joe's mix). Brilliant-fantastic-and the guests this second time liked it even better than the first time I made it last fall. It became their favorite dish then, and it's become a greater favorite now.

After reading all the great reviews, I had high expectations for this dish. Everyone else seemed to like it as an alternative to the same old turkey sandwich stuff, but I wasn't particularly impressed. I would give it two forks myself (like it, don't love it), but the three other people who ate it thought it was really good, so I'm bumping it up to three forks.

So easy--and so, so good. I made this with leftover Thanksgiving turkey, taking the previous reviewer's suggestions to add black beans and sweet potato and sub garam masala for pumpkin spice (which I didn't have). I did find that, with the added ingredients, I needed to add an extra half-cup of chicken broth. It was a hit!

I made this for an office Christmas lunch.I put in black beans and sweet potato chunks in addition to the listed ingredients. It was well received. I think this recipe could use Garam Masala spice blend in place of Pumpkin pie spice-my pumpkin pie spice blend had sugar in it, and that just seems strange in a supper dish. Also, I think orange wedges, dried apricots or other fruit could be put in the dish (late in cooking) to add an extra exotic feel. Also, the fruits' sweetness would counter hot pepper put in. *Garam Masala is Indian, it includes cinnamon,coriander,black pepper, cumin, cloves. And it smells fantastic.

We really enjoyed this dish- even better the next day! I used roasted chicken breast (did not have turkey) and fresh green pepper (rather than diced tomatoes with green pepper). Can't wait to make this with leftover turkey! I love the unusual flavors in this dish.

This was terrific. Amazing way to use leftover trukey, without feeling like you're having turkey again. I was halving the recipe, until I was adding the spices, and I forgot, so I ended up with double spices in the final product, but it wasn't too strong at all, it was delicious. I also used fresh bell pepper instead of tomatoes with bell pepper, and currents instead of raisins because that's what I had. I will make this year after year.

I love this recipe! I'm making it right now -between Thanksgiving and Christmas- with a cooked turkey leg from the store. And I'll probably make it again with Christmas leftovers. My favorite part is telling people what's in it (pumpkin pie spice, chili powder, vinegar?!?) then letting them taste it. Their faces really light up! Everyone loves it.

I made this recipe last night, and have to tell you that you MUST try it. It is easy, quick and very tasty! The green pepper I added was a wonderful addition. Also, the "leftover" turkey I had was from a cooked (purchased that way) turkey breast roast. I was afraid it would be dry, so cut the pieces about 3/4" to 1" instead of the 1/2 as called for in the recipe. It was not dry. Therefore, I can make this again without having to cook a whole turkey to get the leftovers! Believe me, I will!

Delicious! When dealing with leftover turkey, my expectations are pretty low, but this is a recipe I'll make many times in the future. I used chicken broth instead of water, craisins instead of raisins and concocted my own pumpkin pie spice (50% cinnamon, 25% allspice, 25% ground cloves). Very very tasty, and a nice change from the Thanksgiving leftovers that everyone was getting tired of.

My recipe was missing a few things, but it was a great way to combine sweet with spicy. Omitted the raisins and didn't have any apple cider vinegar. If I make it again, I will include the vinegar.

This is the most unique recipe for leftover turkey yet! We absolutely loved the spicy flavors coupled with the sweetness of the raisins. What a pleasant surprise for a midweek supper.

I agree with other reviews that it is a nice combination of flavors, vinegar added like cuban black beans which we love plus sweetness. I added another layer of flavor with Muir Glen fire roasted tomatoes. The following day added a can of beans to the leftover and served "chili" with tortilla chips to the kids for lunch. Great use of leftover turkey.

Delicoius! Sweet and savory and a little spicey all at once. I'm not a big fan of turkey or turkey soup, but we had a lot of turkey leftovers and I needed to do something with them. I made this stew and loved it. I added a green bell pepper, chopped, and some sundried tomatoes. Good over rice or just by itself.

My family loved this. We bought an after-Christmas-cheap turkey and had plenty of left over turkey to deal with. This was the best and most delicious recipe we tried. The left over stew was even more yummy the next day.

This was a perfect post-Christmas turkey meal. Pumpkin pie spice?? We used some cinnamon bark (removed before serving), cloves, and nutmeg, as well as a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar to balance out the vinegar. We also added a couple of bay leaves. We served it over rice. Turned out very well.

You must make this stew! It is one of my top 5 favorite recipes! It was a huge hit. It is a great use for all of that leftover Turkey at Thanksgiving! Enjoy!
