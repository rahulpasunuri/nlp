This was fantastic! Shockingly balanced and full of flavor for such a small number of ingredients. I served at a dinner party and everyone loved it / asked me for the recipe. I caramelized the onions and garlic, added the juice of a 1/3 of an orange, but didn't have time to roast the squash. I was a little worried about that but it turned out wonderfully. Highly recommend.

I LOVED this!! I've never made soup and it was great. I used 2lbs already cubed butternut squash, roasted it with olice oil, salt, pepper and cinnamon as others have suggested for 1 hour on 400. Then, I followed the receipe without the orange and added a cinnamon stick during the boiling. Can't wait to make it again

Really a fabulous soup with a nice depth. I only had dried thyme & it was fantastic. I also roasted the squash first at 400 for an hour after dousing with olive oil, salt & pepper. It gave a lovely depth of flavor. I did use a teaspoon of apricot preserve this time in place of orange zest. Very elegant & easy!

I'm giving this 4 forks with the following changes: I like a thicker soup so I made a roux of 2T. butter & 2T. flour and then slowly added the broth that had been drained before pureeing the vegetables. I roasted the squash for 1 hr. in a 400F. oven before sautéing with the other vegetables and I addred 3 ribs of celery to the onion to sauté. I left out the orange peel, used chicken broth and added one-half cup of cream at the end. Also: the Roasted Red Pepper Puree is a must!

was nervous about this soup because of the mixed reviews. turned out beautifully. the red pepper puree is a must. it brightened the soup and provided a nice sharp accent. i made one variaton. I roasted my butternut squash whole for about an hour at 400 degrees and then I added them to the onions and broth (I used chicken broth). It was easier and added a nice depth of flavor.

I roasted the squash first as per some of the previous reviews. I also took the advice of the reviewer that added a splash of heavy cream to the soup & went a tad heavier on the orange zest. The Red Pepper Puree was a nice garnish, I halved it and made half very spicy with ground red pepper and made the other half mild (without ground red pepper) and let guests add whichever taste they preferred. It was outstanding and the perfect start for Thanksgiving dinner.

I've made this soup many many times over the years and it's absolutely delicious. I often make without the vegetable broth, and use water instead and it's still very tasty. I have little kids and they love it too. The red pepper puree makes for a beautiful presentation and I often make it with it but it is very good even without. One of my favorite recipes.

I do wish recipes would say teaspoons for garlic. My cloves were huge and proved to be too much. The Puree was too garlicky and too hot. Could be my fault for using red pepper powder. We tossed it. I used a 3 lb Squash. Next time I will roast it and the garlic. I'm a novice trying to get it right.

This soup was very good. I was nervous at first because the soup by itself did not taste good to us. I then added fresh ginger and a 1/2 cup of greek plain yogurt as other reviewers suggested and it was a little better but nothing specials...BUT after adding the Roasted Red Pepper Puree it changed everything. It was delicious. Very easy to make. I did not roast the butternut squash as I forgot about that suggestion when I first started the soup. Roasting the squash seems like a good idea for this recipe and I will try again with that suggestion. I think if I do that it may bring this recipe to a 3 1/2 - 4 star recipe.

I made this soup as part of a Halloween dinner. It was wonderful. Like other reviewers, I too roasted the squash first. It gives it a deeper flavor. Next time I would roast the garlic for the puree as well - maybe along with the squash - as it left a pretty strong after taste in our mouths. Definitely a "do again".

Rating: 4
This soup was delicious! Although I would suggest roasting the squash first, it adds a deeper flavour. I cubed up the squash and added olive oil, salt and pepper and a splash of chicken stock (so it doesn't stick) and roasted at 475 for about half an hour to 45 minutes.

Rating: 4
This recipe is delicious! My husband claimed to hate butternut squash until he tried this, and he loved it. I definitely agree with the other people who recommend halving and roasting the squash. I brushed the cut side of the squash with olive oil, then sprinkled on minced garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper and roasted at 400 for 50-60 minutes. I also upped the orange zest and sometimes add a bit of ginger. This is one of my all-time favorite soup recipes.

Rating: 4
The thought of peeling and chopping a butternut squash is always too much for me - I just halve it, roast, it, and add the mash I scoop out from the roasted shells about two minutes before I'm ready to puree. I also leave out the garlic and caramelize the onions a little bit, which makes for a really rich soup.

Rating: 4
My guests loved this soup, I found it simple to make, and I intend to make it again and again. I used all vegetable broth and added about one half cup orange juice in addition to the zest, per others' suggestions. I like thyme and didn't find the flavor to be too strong using the recipe amount. The pepper puree is easy and its tartness is a great contrast to the sweetness of the soup. My guests enjoyed doing the swirling themselves.

I've made this twice and both times added between 1/4 - 1/2 cup of orange and a dash of cream or milk. With the fresh thyme (which grows in my garden) and the red bell pepper puree, it is a flavorful combination. I will make this again.

Rating: 3
Even after seasoning generously with salt and pepper, the soup seemed to lack something. The secret ingredient turned out to be, of all things, yogurt...the unsweet Greek kind that you would use for cucumber sauce (tastes a bit like creme fraiche.) I slowly added a cup of soup to a cup of the yogurt to thin it, and then stirred it back into the pot. The tang of the yogurt offset the sweetness of the squash and smoothed out the flavors. The pepper sauce was easy and added a gorgeous dollop of color and zing to the soup. I will definitely make this again, and will substitute chicken stock for a less sweet/more savory result.

Eh. I roasted the squash, and added cumin, creme fraiche, and cinnamon, and it still wasn't very memorable. Was also *way* too liquid - I had to let it sit in the fridge and then pour off some of the liquid that came to the top to get it to the right consistency. Also: the red pepper puree did not really mesh well with the soup: the harshness from the garlic and dried red pepper didn't match the sweetness of the soup.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and took other people's suggestions of roasting the squash with the onion and apple. I topped it with the roasted pepper puree that according to my guests, really made the soup. Overall, I was pleased with the soup but not the consistencey (there was still little bits of veggies in every mouthful so it seemed more like baby food to me) How can I get a smoother consistencey? Roast the veggies longer than 20 mins so they are softer and puree smoother? If so, how long is too long?

Rating: 3
I think this soup is rather bland if prepared according to the recipe. As others have noted, I prefer using chicken stock to the vegetable broth. Roasting the squash also gives it more depth of flavor. I cut the squash in half, seed it, and roast it at 425 degrees until tender. I scoop out the flesh and toss it into the pot with the other ingredients. This is also a lot easier than cutting up the squash into cubes! Wonderful for Thanksgiving!

Rating: 3
This soup was wonderful even with out the red pepper puree. I did make some changes: added twice the amount of squash, 1 cup extra of broth and a bit more garlic. The orange peel made for an interesting and appealing flavor but don't go overboard ~ it can be overpowering. My friends raved over it. I'll definitely make this again.

Outstanding! I tossed the squash with olive oil, thyme and rosemary and roasted it at 425 for about 40 minutes until it was soft and carmelized. I also used the rind of a piece of parmigiana reggiano cheese that I had been saving (tip from a magazine). I used 2/3 chicken stock and 1/3 beef stock (ran out of chicken). I didn't add the orange rind. I also made the pepper puree but added 2 roasted garlic cloves plus 1 fresh. I used garlic infused oil. It was more of a paste than a puree but was delicious anyway. Everyone raved about the soup. I think the roasting step is essential and the cheese rind gave it an unbelievable taste.

We loved this soup. I used the Trader Joe's packaged butternut squash that is already peeled and in one inch pieces.

This soup is creamy and tastes richer than it is.

I used this recipe as a guide for a roasted butternut squash soup recipe I had tried and failed.

This dish was a hit at a dinner party of 30 I hosted. I added more squash making it almost a double recipe, increased the garlic,onions and apple, cooking it for about 4 hours cut down the need to puree the soup, I liked it with more texture. Adding my own chicken stock really made a difference. Next time I will try vegetarian. Many compliments on this soup, my guests went home with the recipe! I also roasted my own red peppers then put them in the blender to puree.Adding rice to the leftovers the next day was delish! Four forks!

This is warming and wonderful. In this part of France it's difficult to find every type of winter squash, so I had to use a close, or early relative of the pumpkin, but it was perfect.

I took other's advice and added two medium size cortland apples, however, I thought this made the final taste too tangy and not compatible with the rest of the spices.

I combined tips/ingredients from several different Epicurious recipes for a fantastic soup! I roasted cubed butternut squash, 1 medium onion, and 2 peeled gala apples--all drizzled with olive oil--for 20 minutes first. Also sauteed 1/2 onion/celery/carrot and garlic in the pot while waiting on the roast. Transferred the squash to my pot and seasoned with cumin!!--a must--cinnamon and S&P. Added chicken stock and simmered for 40 minutes. Had to use a hand mixer to blend, and tinkered with stock/cream additions to my taste. GREAT! Also had a recent suggestion to top off with crumbled chicken sausage and gorgonzola...great garnish!

This is a terrific and easy soup to make. You don't even need the puree to go with it - it's great on its own. To reduce the fat, I omitted the olive oil, and used cooking spray to saute the onions/garlic (cover with a lid to semi-steam them) - yum.

Such a tasty and easy soup for a rainy weeknight. I did not add the orange, but curry instead. I also used my immersion blender which makes things so easy. Because of time restrictions, I used jarred roasted red pepper in the puree. It was a nice touch to the soup and looked wonderful. Served with salsa and cheddar quesadillas. YUM! I am looking forward tot he leftovers.

Great dish, but making a few changes made it absolutely delicious. I added about 1.25 ts curry powder to the onion and garlic (the whole recipe was halved) right before adding the squash, cooked it in a pressure cooker for 10 minutes or so (love that pressure cooker), but when i blended the result it didn't have enough of a personality of its own, so I added a few dashes of cayanne and about .5-1 ts of Garam Masala which really was an incredible addition. Squash goes so well with those desert spices that make up part of garam masala, but it also goes with the cardamom and black pepper, etc. As this was part of a full meal, I plated the soup with some seared sea scallops and a jullienne of roasted red pepper. Delicious. Try the curry plus garam masala, you won't be disappointed.

Made this for a dinner party of eight and am happy to report that it went over really well. The contrasting colors of the soup against the pepper puree and the thyme made for a great presentation. I took a writers suggestion and added a bit of cream for added richness.

After the onions have been in the pan for about 5 minutes, add the butternut squash and sauté for about 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the pieces, before adding the liquid. This will bring out the sweetness of the squash and will produce a superior soup. A hand-help blender makes quick work of blending this very fine soup. I give it high points for its excellent taste, ease of preparation, and attractive presentation. The red pepper puree and sprinkled fresh thyme add to the visual interest. Incidentally, credit for this recipe should be given to Bon Appétit.

When you read the changes I made, you will probably wonder why I used this recipe in the first place. Answer it was a starting point, my children hate onions and orange. And trust me they can taste them. Omited onions, replaced with about 1/4 c of finely chopped sundried tomatoes. Puree sundried tomato's, 1 roasted red pepper and 1 roasted garlic bulb. Add thyme, 1/4 teas of saffron, 2 teas chopped fresh ginger and 1/4 teas of green chili paste. Simmer slowly, puree until smooth. At time of serving add cream to make a rich vibrant smooth soup. It's a keeper

Reading the reviews, I thought I'd better at least make a couple changes... I used chicken broth instead of vegetable, added some saffron for a little extra flavor, one more clove of garlic, Half white onion and half red onion(with same total amount), and about 1/4 cup of butter in the last step. I left off the extra thyme at the end in fear of overdoing the spice. We loved it and will definitely be making it again.

Being a fan of butternut squash soup, I was intrigued with the roasted red pepper puree. We usually have the soup with a dollop of sour cream. But, we loved the puree, it's something different and makes a nice presentation. To tweak the soup a bit, I always put in a cinnamon stick while the squash is cooking and add about 1/4 cup of Sherry wine at the end. The wine makes the soup smoother and gives it a more interesting taste.

OK. So now I'm a convert to squash. After 'having' to eat squash as a kid I never cared much for it as an adult. But when your husband makes puppy dog eyes and your the only cook in the house...how could I say no. With a few adjustments, we now have a new staple. I used chicken broth and marsala wine in the broth, then added about half cup of heavy cream after pureeing. Swirl in red pepper puree and top with toasty croutons. What a treat on a cold rainy night.

I tested four other recipes for squash soup before making this one for Thanksgiving. It was a hit. People who like squash loved this soup and people who do not like squash liked it. The best part about this recipe was that I was able to spice-up the roasted pepper sauce such that people who like mild food could have the basic soup and those who like spicey food could add as much roasted red pepper sauce as they liked. I made some modifications to both the soup and the roasted red pepper sauce. For the soup, I used 1/2 butternet squash which I barbequed beforehand and 1/2 acorn squash which I added in fresh. I added a peeled, chopped fuji apple with the squash to sweeten it, fresh sage and dried bay leaf. For the roasted red pepper sauce, I used fresh lemon juice instead of olive oil. I topped it with toasted pumpkin seed meats (coat lightly in avacado oil, salt, then bake at 250 for 1 hour or until golden brown, turning once).

I love this soup! I too made it without the orange peel but I added two extra cloves of garlic - which gave it a really nice flavor - not bland at all!!

Since butternut squash is in season and currently on many menus in finer restaurants, I decided to make this recipe for guests this past weekend. It turned out beautifully and swirling in the roasted red pepper puree gave it a wonderful gourmet appearance. I am glad I didn't add too much vegetable stock or it may have come out too thin. I also left out the orange peel as the puree added a kick of spice so it did not taste too sweet.

I made this soup on the weekend. The great thing is you can make it a day ahead and it just romances the flavours together even more! I used chicken stock instead of the veggie stock, and it worked out nicely. The creme fresh was a really nice touch too.
