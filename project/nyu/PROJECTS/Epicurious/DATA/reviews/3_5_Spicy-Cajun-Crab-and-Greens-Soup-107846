Yummy recipe for an easy weeknight dinner when crab meat is on sale. Caramelized 1 medium onion and used 28 oz Muir Glen Fire-Roasted diced tomatoes (double the tomatoes).

Superb and so easy! Followed the suggestions and used half chicken stock and half clam juice.

I used the base to make a pasta sauce so I can't rate the recipe. However, it was not salty at all without the clam juice and the broth. So all the comments about too much salt really are a result of the clam juice.

Love this soup!! It has become a regular choice in our recipe box. The only change I made was to sub chicken stock/broth for the clam juice. The chicken stock/broth adds a certain richness to the soup!!

This was so delicious! Used homemade seafood stock in place of clam juice. And, I too, had to caramelize my own onions. Served with jalapeno-cheese cornbread. Yum!!

Delicious hot or cold. Quick and easy to prepare and great for company.

excellent light meal. I also carmelized my own onions as I could not find the tomatoes with carmelized onions. I used small frozen shrimp and added one can of crab meat, which was much cheaper and came out delicious.

I followed other reviewer advice and cut the clam juice with some chicken stock, wasn't salty at all. A great soup. Next time i'll pick over the crab meat though...oops

Although we found it a tad salty for our particular taste, it was an absolutely delicious dish. We couldn't find the tomatoes with carmelized onions either but that was no problem -we just chopped up an onion and carmelized it ourselves. I would call it more of a chowder than a soup and found it delightfully satisfying - light but filling. At a BBQ that we had this past summer, we served it chilled and were thrilled with the results, as were our guests. It was a very well received dish and disappeared quickly. I would definitely serve this again.

I have made this recipe over and over. Coming from a family of serious 'fish eaters' we are rather picky (to say the least). Everyone loves this. As a substitute: in lieu of fresh crab meat (very expensive), I use chicken of the sea LUMP CRAB. It's super and more economical, so I can make it over and over.

I agree that a low-salt Cajun seasoning would be preferred. At first I thought it was too salty, but I got used to it. I happened to have shrimp in the house and thought "why not?". I followed the directions preceisely other than using shrimp and we really enjoyed it. Also, I think I would sub 1/2 clam juice for chicken stock. It tastes much more complex than the few ingredients would indicate but the seasoning carries a lot of weight very well. Will make again.

This is one of my favorite recipes and is always a hit. The only thing I do differently is for the amount desired of cajun seasoning, I use the salt-free version for 3/4 or it, as the seafood provides a little of its own saltiness. I also found that sometimes a tablespoon or so of balsamic vinegar at the end of cooking can add a nice touch for a special occasion meal.

This was delicious and fast (about 20 min.), but I walked out of Whole Foods Market last night with a $50 grocery bill and it was only for these ingredients. Come on guys - this is not an everyday meal. I'll make it again for special company and will use a substitute for crab for everyday.

This is now one of our favorite quick meals. I added my own carmelized onions, salt-free cajun seasoning (found at a health food store), and fresh shrimp instead of crab.

This dish was easy enough, but both my husband and I agreed that this soup is bland. I followed the recipe and did not make any changes. There are to many better recipes out there to waste time modifing this one.

Great "spicy" flavor...Deffinately a main course soup with salad and hearty bread...Not a "family" dish however, as the children (under 15) did not appreciate the combination or the "heat"... I made it (and saved the leftovers) for nights when the kids would eat pizza after soccer/swimming practice and I wanted something healthy, quick and filling!

Our family loves this dish. I use olive oil, only 3 tsp of cajun seasoning, S & W has canned carmelized onions and tomatoes but I just use peeled and diced tomatoes from the can and I use peeled crayfish which is much cheaper than crab @ $44.99/lb (no kidding) where I live! After those changes following the recipe does work. I have made his over and over with great success.

Wonderful! I used 1 can of chopped clams, then added steamed clams and mussels at serving time. Crusty French bread is the best for mopping up juice. I will definitely make it again.

This soup is dynamite, easy to make, super flavors, and healthy. I've made it many times, even for my very fussy family. They really enjoyed to too. I was not able to find the tomatoes, but did find Delmonte diced tomatoes with garlic and onions. They work real well.

I used Hot and Spicy Clamato juice instead of clam juice and Thai seasoning instead of cajun. I didnt find it salty at all. It was a really fast, healthy, filling lunch. I couldnt find the right tomatoes either...I throw in whatever kind I have. Yum Yum Yum

This recipie was far too salty, and the flavors did not blend well at all.

Very good. We used it as a main course with French bread and a salad. Couldn't find canned tomatoes with the carmalized onion, so carmalized my own. Recipe is very easy to make. We are going to try it with chicken broth instead of clam and used some cooked Isernios chicken sausage next time, just to experiment.

I have not made this dish but have a suggestion: for similar dishes I have used half clam juice/half low sodium chicken stock. Makes the dish less fishy and salty but still has good flavor.

This was extremely mediocre. It was too thick to be a soup, it might be better to put it on rice or pasta. I would not make this again.

I made this for a Mardi Gras party and am glad I served several dishes. Yes, I did add clams and it was probably this that put the flavor over the edge into "fishy". It was so bad that I have no desire to try it again. It was a waste of really good crab.

SUPERIOR FLAVOR WHICH ANY COOK COULD ACHIEVE !!Even the most inexperienced cook could achieve a delightful sensation. Since it is Lenten season I needed to quickly whip-up a lenten soup with pantry items on hand. I used Canned crabmeat in a pinch and had excellent results for a last minute meal. I am sure the better the quality of crabmeat would enhancethis dish as the cook from Chicago commented.

Great BUT too salty what with salt in clam broth, tomatoes and cajun spice. Next time will find cajun spice where salt is not the first ingredient or will make my own (1-3 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp ground thyme, 1 tsp sweet paprika,1 tsp ground cumin).

I couldn't find the tomatoes with carmelized onion so I used chopped tomates with sweet onions. I also added a bit of water as it was rather thick. But it was delicious!! Very easy & very healthy!! Everyone at our table loved it and I will defintely make again. Thanks.Even better reheated the next day with fresh Parmeasan cheese sprinkled on top.

to Oil City: as a Cajun seasoning, I would use either Tony Chachere's, or make up a batch of Emeril's Creole seasoning. Either are good, but at least with Emeril's, you can control the amount of salt you put into it.

Can anyone recommend a cajun seasoning? I am assuming Old Bay does not qualify by the comments. I hate to waste the money on unsatisfactory spice blends. It makes me crazy to see them sitting in the drawer! Thanks!

This was delicious. I added some whole clams in with it. Very quick and easy.

This was a really good "soup". I call it a soup, but it was more of a crab stew. If you want more of a soup, add more oyster broth. Be careful of the amount of cajun spice you use in the soup. The "heat" of the cajun spice can spice the soup up too much, wathc out! Other than that, it was one of the best damn soups I have had in a long time. I intend on making it again for several friends, this weekend! Low fat, low salt, good protein source! Also, good fiber content with the spinach!

We added chorizo sausage to the dish which added a great flavor. We also served it over rice which added heft and texture. Unfortunately, we used crushed tomatoes, instead of the tomatoes the recipe called for. Next time we'll definately follow that part of the recipe.

You can't imagine how good this is! I couldn't find tomato w/carmelized onions, so made my own by slicing a large spanish onion and browning with 2-3 T. sugar and combining with canned diced tomatoes. Also used a can of clams in lieu of 8 oz of clam juice. Fresh thyme is a must and splurge on the crab meat. Used 5 tsp. McCormick's creole seasoning mix and it was nicely spiced.

I am pure cajun from Abbeville, La. and it seems to me this "soup" is an attempt to make gumbo. The missing ingredients are the other vegetables of the cajun holy trinity (bell pepper and celery) and the rice. Of course it's good; it has been for over 100 years.

Absolutely wonderful soup. I used a little less Cajun spice but added some Old Bay Seasoning. Next time I will also add mussels. We ate it with a French baguette but we will use anything but French next time.

This was a fabulous first course at my Mardi Gras dinner! Everyone raved, and it was so easy. I used the freshest jumbo lump crabmeat, which was key. I couldn't find the tomatoes w/ carmelized onions, so I just roasted an onion in the crock overnight, chopped and threw it in... A great soup I will certainly make again!

This soup was really easy to make and very delicious. It was a great Friday evening dinner. I was skeptical that I would find the tomatoes with carmelized onions in them, but there they were, right on the shelf at the grocery store, S&W brand I believe. Highly recommended with a nice crunchy baguette.

I couldn't find the carmelized onions with tomatoes so I just used diced tomatoes. And I substituted claw crab meat for lump. Use less Cajun seasoning if yours is as hot as mine was! This was absolutely fabulous! Will definitely make again, and again, and again!

This soup was fantastically easy and very delicious. The better quality of crab meat you have, the better the dish will taste.
