I didn't have the fresh vegetables, so I couldn't make this as written, but it adapted well. I used frozen corn, sun dried tomatoes, and sweet onion sauteed in the tomato oil and the deglazed with red wine vinegar. Cooked the bulgur in turkey broth and added some crumbled feta per other cooks. Hubby loved it, and he doesn't like bulgur. Will try this again as written on market day.

I've experimented with this recipe until I unwittingly ended up with something more like Gourmet's April 2000 version (Bulgar with onion, tomato, and feta), although I like the flavor of the toasted bulgur here. I tend to add a little more salt at the end, along with some chopped cilantro & crumbled feta. Sometimes I substitute diced red onion for the scallions and lemon juice for the red wine vinegar, or sometimes do a mix of these ingredients. A really healthy, satisfying summer salad!

I made this countless times over the summer, when it was possible to get good fresh produce. I added cilantro for more flavor, and substituted lemon juice for the vinegar. Add crumbled feta or chickpeas and it's a full meal!

I felt that the basic recipe needed something so I added minced cilantro. Also, I cooked the corn in the microwave for about 2 minutes per ear and then cut the kernels off the cob.

I had expected this recipe to be somewhat bland. I was really surprised. My entire family enjoyed this dish.
