Don't mess with this recipe it's brilliant! The combo of the almond extract and cinnamon somehow works and they are so easy.

Pretty good; not-too-sweet, and the cinnamon is a nice touch. I omitted the almond extract, and halfed the recipe so I ended up with ten cookies. That was a good call--I'm not sure we (an urban couple with a late-night yen for something sweet) could have eaten a whole batch!

I made two batches of these cookies, the first with some extra chocolate (2 more ounces than the recipe calls for) which was good, if you are a chocolate lover, but it kind of drowned out the taste of the cookie. This is a very flavorful cookie, and so the next batch I made with 6 oz. of chocolate was perfect..so my advice would be don't go crazy with the chocolate even though it doesn't look like a lot. Very simple to make. Easy, fast and fun!

Nice cookie. Easy.

If I made this again -- which I probably won't since there are so many other great cookie recipes -- I'd keep the chocolate in larger chunks. As it was, it was more like "Chocolate Shreds and Pecan Cookies."

I adored these cookies and so did my guests. We liked the combo of pecans and the chocolate.

I couldn't believe the amount of chocolate this recipe required, so I only used half that amount. I thought the biscuits were delicious and will make them again. I did double bake them though whereby you cook them, cool them, then set oven to very low & bake about 40 minutes to dry & crisp.

The first batch came out a little flat, so I decided to do things a bit different. I added an additional cup of pecans and left out the cinnamon. They taste pretty good, except the almond taste was a little strong. Good luck

MAKES NICE LARGE COOKIES. DO NOT EAT WHILE TOO HOT, THE CHOCOLATE IS TOO LIQUID. THE CINNAMON PUT ME OFF BECAUSE I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE SO PUNGENT. I INTEND TO MAKE THEM AGAIN BUT WITHOUT THE CINNAMON THIS TIME. MY FIANCE RATES THEM A 8.5-9 OUT OF A POSSIBLE 10.

This was an o.k. recipe for choc. Chip cookies. It wasn't the best I've tried or the worst. I'm not sure I cared for the cinnamon in them. There are so many choc. chip recipes out there, that I would probably try something different.

It could be the altitude or any number of things, but I did not have good luck with this recipe. I took the first batch out of the oven when the edges started to brown and the centers were soft like the recipe said. It was too soon. The centers were not cooked. Then I cooked the second batch too much. I'm anxious to hear what kind of results others have.
