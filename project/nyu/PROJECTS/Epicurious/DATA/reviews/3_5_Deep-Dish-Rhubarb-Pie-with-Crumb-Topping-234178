This is not Rhubarb pie. It's strawberry rhubarb pie. Still looking for a true mouth-puckering rhubarb pie recipe like my mom used to make.

This. Pie. Is. Perfect!

Wow! Was I surprised at how delicious this pie was. My son has been asking me to bake a rhubarb pie for awhile and I thought it would be sour and unappealing. This is a fabulous recipe! The crust was flakey and light and the filling had the right amount of sweetness and firmness. I would slice the strawberries thicker next time. Highly recommended.

This was delicious: a nice balance of sweet, tart, smooth and crunchy. Received a quart of tiny, sweet berries and rhubarb stalks in this week's CSA package, and it was just the right amount for the recipe. I used a pre-made, refrigerated crust and did not have a deep dish pie plate. However, the extra, leftover filling is tasty over ice-cream. Discovered at the last minute that I didn't have brown sugar (missed this setting up my "mise en place") and white sugar worked just fine.

I cannot go on enough about this pie! It was stunning! The only problem that I had was that the crust sort of slid down into the pie plate while I was trying to get it to set. I may have put just slightly too much shortening in, but I'm not sure. Otherwise, it came out beautifully. This was only the second pie I have ever made, and everyone loved it. The filling was so good on its own, I think it would make a really delicious alternative for a strawberry shortcake topping.

While it was better than some I've tasted it was certainly not the best. I am a purest and think that it does not need any spices whatsoever. A little lemon juice to help bring out the flavors of the fruit is all this needs. I could taste too much of the nutmeg and not enough of the Rhubarb. Texture is was fantastic.

I did not have time to make my own crust and used a store-bought...and I did not put 1 cup of sugar in the filling (substituted 1/2 cup of agave syrup) but this turned out to be a great pie. I used really ripe strawberries and green rhubarb from the farmers market. (Green rhubarb is not as tart.) It holds together well- not soupy when you cut into it. And though I was not pleased about cooking the filling before popping it in the oven, the fact that it holds together and the filling doesn't have any cornstarch blobs compensate for the extra dish to clean. Next time, I would like to try making the crust, and top it with freshly whipped cream with a hint of agave syrup and cinnamon.

Wonderful recipe! I didn't find that any of the suggested changes needed to be used. I actually used a pre-made crust with great success. Got rave reviews from rhubarb fanatics!

I made this pie twice this past weekend for two different BBQ's -- both times I used fresh-picked strawberries and rhubarb from my garden, but frozen pie crusts (with a 7-month-old baby I have limited time in the kitchen :). For the first one I followed the recipe exactly. Upon tasting the first, I made some changes for the second one as other reviewers suggested. I added 2 Tbsp. (not teaspoons) lemon juice, omitted the cinnamon from the filling entirely, and used a dash of ground nutmeg. The second one was so much tastier - I found the cinnamon really masked the flavors of the strawberries. Everyone enjoyed it both ways, but I got requests for the recipe on the 2nd one. A great summer dessert.

The consistency of the filling was excellent, not runny at all. I will include a little less sugar next time, though. The lemon juice mentioned in previous reviews may also help this situation. I am rating this three forks because I used a crust I already had in the freezer and did not get a chance to try the crust in the recipe. Nonetheless, I'll make this one again!

Made it with a store bought crust and skipped the cinnamon. The egg wash on the crust kept it crispy and I had no problme with burning. It set up really nicely and the strawberries were not mushy.

The pie overall, once finished was very tasty, especially with vanilla ice cream. The problem was the crust, the ratio of butter to flour is wrong, the crust was too moist and didn't set up correctly so it required additional baking time and even then the crust wasn't sturdy enough for the filling as presentation was not a slice but more of a crumble type dessert. With a sturdier crust it would be excellent.

OOPs, I didn't have any strawberries. Substituted raisins - it worked out fine.

This was an excellent pie. I made a few changes: I used a purchased crust for time savings but followed the directions for preparation. I also left out the cinnamon and nutmeg in the filling but added the 2t. of lemon juice that another reviewer suggested. Yum!

I use the wholly wholesome organic pie crusts so I am only reviewing the topping and filling. Four forks! Perfect. The filling is sweet tart with a marvelous glazed quality and the topping sets it off just right.

Great filling, tho I only used 1 pint of strawberries, and 1 cup sugar. Used a lattice crust over a store-bought shell (organic) and it was fabulous and quick!

This pie took the better part of the afternoon to make because there so many steps to the recipe. For all the effort, the crust didn't impress me at all and I probably will not use the same crust recipe again. BUT the filling of this pie is excellent and this is the first that I have made a strawberry rhubarb pie that didn't turn out runny. I think cooking the filling on the stove top first, until it is thickened and then pouring it into the baked pie shell made all the difference. It was delicious but very time consuming.

I was fine with the cinnamon...I felt fewer clicks would be better!
