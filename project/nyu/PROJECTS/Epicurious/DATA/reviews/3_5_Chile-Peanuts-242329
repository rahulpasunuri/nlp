These were okay... not spicy enough for me. Also, the spice mixture is messy and sticks to your fingers. Don't serve to company.

Using El Rey de la Vera Pimento for the papkria added a great smoky flavor. Coastal Goods makes a medium grain sea salt which worked well too, not too salty but a nice balance of warm, smoky, spicy and tang.

We liked this recipe very much. In reading the reviews these are some ingredients I used and this may solve the salty issue. Paprika, El Rey de la Vera Pimento de la Vera, smoky. Coastal Goods sea salt, medium grain. We found using these made it well balanced and spicy.

I used smoked paprika and cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp. They're sooo good!!

Halved recipe but otherwise made as directed. Kept 1 day in a jar before serving. None of us liked it -- too sour. And we are seasoned-peanut- lovers. Spice mix was otherwise good.

Easy and delicious. Served as part of a Latin engagement cocktail party menu. I don't think it is too salty.
