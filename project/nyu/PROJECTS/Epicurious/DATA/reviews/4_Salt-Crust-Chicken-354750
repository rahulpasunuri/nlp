This recipe made a tasty chicken. It only took about 4 lbs of salt to surround my 4.5 lb chicken. No pan juices for gravy, but nicely roasted chicken with great flavor. Also, cracking the salt crust was fun.

Okay, I haven't actually prepared this at home, but I have eaten it -- the salt-crusted chicken at the Francis Mallman restaurant in Mendoza, Argentina. It is *astonishingly* good. (Related note -- I've made salt-crusted whole fish and salt-baked shrimp before, and those have turned out well.)
