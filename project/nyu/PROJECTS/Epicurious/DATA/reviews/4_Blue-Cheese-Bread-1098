I made this for a wine club party and it was a HIT! It was so fast and easy as well. I used half the butter and only 4 oz of blue cheese which was enough to cover a loaf of sourdough bread. Try it! You won't be disappointed.

Everyone loved this bread. Although I forgot to sprinkle the bread with the celery, no one missed it.

This didn't look like much but really went over with our dinner company. The better the bleu cheese the better the results.

I made this with 1/2 stick of butter instead of 2 sticks and it was still delicious and probably a little better for you. We used a chewy sourdough that rocked. everybody loved it
