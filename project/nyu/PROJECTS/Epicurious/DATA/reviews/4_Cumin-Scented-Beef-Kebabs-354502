Made this for dinner tonight and it was fabulous. I followed other suggestions and substituted white wine for almost all of the oil in the marinade. Loved the roasted red pepper and walnut spread too.

I used T-Bone cut. It was really good. I didn't marinate the meat for the full 2 hours. Ididn't bother with the skewers. Just wonderful.

I made this for a Syrah wine tasting party and with the red pepper sauce it was met with rave reviews! The flat iron was so tender even when done in the oven (at 375 for 12-15 minutes). I also used dried oregano but cut it down to 1 tablespoon. Stayed true to the rest of the recipe and the pepper sauce one too. Perfect! This is going to be a regular rotation for parties.

This recipe had good flavor from the spices. But, I would recommend marinating in white wine instead of olive oil so you get some acidity to make the meat more tender and so you reduce the calories.

No flap steak available without ordering way ahead, so we used sirloin instead. Fabulous flavor and oh, so tender.

I didn't have time to marinate the full two hours and the meat was still fantastic! I will make this again with some vegetable kabobs on the side.

I stumbled across this recipe in my old copy of the August 2009 issue of "Gourmet." I made the entire menu, including garlic-oregano grilled pita bread and roasted red pepper and walnut spread. I use the epicurious website frequently, but my heavens, this made me long for "Gourmet" and the hard copy of the greatest magazine ever for food lovers.

Exceptional results from such an easy recipe. The cumin and coriander combo is delicious. Flap meat is a must - it gets beautifully crisp when grilled over high heat while retaining its juiciness. Grill only to medium rare for best results, and remember to season well with salt before grilling. My favorite kebab recipe!

I made it under the broiler with good results. I marinated it for 24 hours and the flavor was good. My husband, the meat expert, says the toughness is due to the way the pieces are sliced. He recommends cutting against the grain. The roasted red pepper spread is super easy and has a great flavor. I'll be making it as an appetizer in the future.

I tried this with flank steak, but I should have used another cut of meat because it was a bit tough. The marinade was good though.

Made for a friends Mediterranean B-day BBQ. So, I had to like quadruple the recipe!! I made marinade as directed and used it for the chicken kebabs. Then with the leftover marinade, I added a little balsamic and used that to marinate the tri tip for the beef kebabs. (couldn't get flap steak) They both were amazing! FYI, ziploc bags are great for marinading anything, push all the air out, and you'll need less marinade. I did marinade overnight, and it wasn't too much.

Very easy and delicious. Worth the effort to seek out flat iron steak. I first tried this recipe with another cut and the meat was a little tough, but the flat iron steak was tender and very flavorful.

My family of five really enjoyed this marinade, altho I used it on pork tenderloin, and didn't have time to make the kebabs. I do think either a longer marinating time (I only had an hour) or smaller pieces of meat would have made for a stronger flavor. I served it with the red pepper sauce, corn on the cob with feta-mint butter and grilled pita from the Free Wheeling menu and it was a big hit!

I made this for my husband's 60th birthday party for 25 guests. Everyone raved about it! Not only was it delicious, but it was easy to make in quantity.

This is excellent - although it feeds 4 in our family (with 2 teenage boys), maybe 5. Made it with the spread, pita and corn, and it was all very wonderful.

Excellent! Made this one just as the recipe is written and the whole family enjoyed it. Served with fresh pita and store-bought muhamarra, couscous, and a salad. Will add this to the regular rotation.

Made this for a dinner party and everyone raved. Make sure to marinate longer than 2 hours - we did 8 hours. The beef was tender and fragrant with just the right amount of spice. The beef with the red pepper spread was a great combination.

The flavor was really good on these and I will make them again but I will use a good tender cut of meat next time. I didn't enjoy all the extra chewing and even my kids commented on this. but again, the flavor was good enough to do it again. Very easy meal.

Very good. I used the marinade with a flank steak to cut down on prep time. The meat was excellent with the romesco-like sauce. We enjoyed it very much!

This was lovely. Although I didn't have time to let marinate for more than half an hour or so, and used the oven instead of a barbecue, they came out and made us feel like we were somewhere in the Mediterranean region. I served with a bulghur salad with summer veg, a great match. I'm sure a thick yoghurt/herb dressing would be fantastic with this as well. Will be making again for sure.

This was fantastic with pita bread, the greek salad and roasted red pepper & walnut spread. I would only make half of the spread next time since I had a lot left over. Also, I needed to save time, so I used 2/3 cup of regular bread crumbs and the spread came out perfectly. I might try a 2 lb. flank steak and marinading it all day next time.

Served these to the Poker Guys along with the Greek Salad, it was a big hit for sure. I also used Lamb with the same seasoning and it was good as well. Have some fun with this recipe it is worth a spot in the recipe box.

Oh, yeah! This was a restaurant meal for sure. And the flat iron was so inexpensive compared to the higher- end cuts of beef. I paid around $4.50 for about a pound and a half. I served it with the roasted red pepper spread from the same page, as well as the garlic-oregano grilled bread, also from that page. I used naan instead of pita, which was just perfect. Can't wait to make it again this weekend. With recipes like these, why dine out?

I made this as part of a Mexican dinner for my boyfriend and it was great. It definitely needs salt! Not sure why it was left out of the recipe. I added some, but next time I'll add more. I think adding a hint of cinnamon would be good too. Since I'm a vegan I substituted tofu for beef and let it marinate all night! I ended up searing it on the grill and finishing it off in a 350 degree oven for about 20 min b/c the skewers were being burned even though I soaked them for almost an hour! My boyfriend loved it and I'll be making it again!

I loved this dish so much I'm making it again this weekend! I no longer eat beef but I made it with cubed chicken breasts and it was sensational. I loved the pita bread, used multi grain. Served this with tabbuleh, hummus and green beans. Yum!

Amazing flavour. The cumin and garlic mixture is exceptional! My family loved it! Green beans were a lovely complement.

For the reader from Dallas, TX--i found the correct type of meat at Central Market (marketed as fajita meat for 4.99 a pound) and at Market Street (for 6.99 a pound marketed as flatiron). It was FANTASTIC. Not too greasy, perfect, perfect perfect. Will make it again this weekend.

Very good, and delicious with the walnut and red pepper spread and pitas. I missed the part about the salt and found that it needed to be salted at the table, but that was my mixup. I made the marinade the night before, and threw the steak in the next morning before work. It was ready to go when I came home. Good stuffe

Had great results with this recipe, though used regular sirloin, as we didn't want the fatty cut of meat. Be sure to marinate for a long time (I did 5 hours, but next time will do even longer). If you have the time, do the roasted red pepper spread- it's a great compliment to the beef.

I didn't get the sense that the flavor truly penetrated the meat. It sure didn't tenderize it (probably since no acide in marindade). My butcher swore sirloin tip would be the same as flap or flatiron, but I'm not to sure. The meat was dry.
