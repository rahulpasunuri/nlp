These are delicious, but the real knock-out is the relish...fantastic!!!

I actually modified it by using pork tenderloin and cut it into kabobs - marinating overnight is the difference - also felt it needed a little spice so I added some red pepper flakes to the marinade - everyone loved it. I then skewered pineapple and red onion and served that with the pork kabobs. Perfect summer meal.

Very easy and very marinade. After 24 hours of marinading I grilled the chops with slices of pineapple (I didn't make the salsa). The teriyaki flavor is not overwhelming at all, just the right amount of flavor and the chops were so moist. This marinade is a keeper.

I made this recipe for 50 people. I used 12 Pork Tenderloins instead of pork chops. I made the recipe as written for the other ingredients. For the Relish I used Cilantro instead of Mint. It was fabulous! Everyone raved. Will definitely keep this one

This is one of the best marinades that I have ever had. It was great! I tried it with chicken too, it was good but I liked it better with pork. The secret is to marinade it overnight. I served it with brown rice and green beans. very good low calorie dinner!

This should get 4 forks just for the ease of preparation and as another noted, most of this menu can be made ahead. Served to 4 hungry men and not a drop went to waste. Will definitely be serving again.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. The relish was beautiful, most things could be done ahead of time, and it turned out delicious. I will definitely make it again.

This dish was great! So easy to make. I had already defrosted some chicken breast so I used them instead of the pork. I took some fresh pineapple and finely chopped it and added the juice and the pineapple to the marinade. I basted the chicken a few times while grilling it. My family really enjoyed it...EXCELLENT!

I thought the marinade was very good in this recipe. The first time I made this recipe, as is. It was really good. The second time I made a few changes for an easier midweek dinner. I substituted 1/2 cup pineapple juice for the water and vinegar in the marinade. Then I broiled the pork chops in the oven. The last 5 minutes of broiling I placed 1 ring of pineapple on top of each chop, instead of making the salsa. It was a hit with my family. Very easy and tasty. I recommend marinading the chops at least 4 hour if not over night for a great tasty dinner.

This marinade is outstanding! I did add a minced shallot,3 tablespoons of sherry,and about 2 heaping tablespoons of crushed pineapple. I also used it for chicken breast and cornish hen which I wrapped in bacon and placed on the grill(the bacon wrapped chicken recipe on this site)I can't wait to try it on pork chops.

The day was much too sultry to monkey around in the kitchen, so we skipped the pineapple/papaya relish and served the chops with sliced mango, jasmine rice, and the green bean salad with soy glazed almonds on this site. The chops were wonderfully moist and flavorful, the delicious marinade fortunately bore no resemblance to bottled teriyaki, and we didn't miss the relish.

My husband is not a lover of salsas and relishes, and he just loved the combination of the relish with the meat. I felt that all the different textures and tastes complemented each other perfectly...definitely a repeater!
