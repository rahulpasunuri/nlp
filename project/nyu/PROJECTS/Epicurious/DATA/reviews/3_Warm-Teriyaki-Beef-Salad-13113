I am about to make this recipe for the fourth time. Based on the reviews I am bit heavy handed with the liquids--otherwise I make no changes. It is great! A nice easy-- but different/lovely--weeknight meal. Tonight I have a guest who is allergic to mushrooms (and my husband tends to pick them out). I think I'll sub zucchini and maybe and some fresh bean sprouts. The recipe is that versatile. Maybe Ill add some red onion too.

Great recipe to enjoy on a summer day. The recipe certainly makes more than 2 servings. Pair with some warm bread and glass of wine or ice tea.

I thought this recipe was just okay. The marinated beef was fine, but I'd probably just prefer to put the beef over a more traditional oriental salad.

I just made this dish for my husband and he loved it. The only problem was that there was not enough sauce. When he added additional soy sauce, he loved it. Would definitely make this again, but increase the sauce quantities.

I love this salad. It is simple to make and the flavor is fabulous. I have served it several times and everyone has loved it. I find that the flavors develop better if I marinade it overnight. In fact, the extra time makes the steak more tender.

I made this dish several times and it always turned out very well, even with some substitutions (canned bean sprouts, a commercial teriyaki sauce for the soy sauce/vinegar/sherry mixture, sliced sirloin, etc.)

I wish the rating system allowed us to rate with 1/2 a fork. I would rate this 2 1/2. It was good and an easy meal to make on a work night. It feeds more than two people, however.
