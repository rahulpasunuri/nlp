Easy and delicious. My guests loved the beets.

Very tasty, better than the Epicurious recipe for balsamic glazed beets and better than the traditiional harvard beets. The combination of butter and orange juice etc. makes a great sauce. Taking heed of other reviews, I added a teaspoon of corn startch to 1/4 of cold juice, then I cooked the liquids for about 5 minutes before adding the beets. Sauce thickened nicely. This is a rare 4-fork review for me, and it is deserving.

This was a really quick and easy sauce that I added to a Pepper crusted Pork Tenderloin and garlic mashed potato dinner. I ended up making the sauce in the drippings of the pork, and substituted meyer lemon zest for the orange peel. Yum.

This was okay, the orange flavor reminded me of Christmas. That said, it was way too sweet and the orange flavor overwhelmed everything. I won't be making it again.

This is delicious! I used balsamic, instead of red wine vinegar. It's worth it to allow time for the sauce the reduce and become syrupy. I topped it with chopped parsley and chevre, which were tasty and colorful additions. This is a great recipe!

I loved the flavor of this sauce and how well it complimented the beets. The recipe is also very easy to make. It didn't get as syrupy as indicated in the recipe, so I added a bit of cornstarch.

I love roasted beets and this is a wonderful, fresh citrus alternative. Even my hubby who normally won't touch beets scarfed this recipe down!

Made this for my mother at Thanksgiving last year and it was a huge hit! I don't even like beets, but I liked the way these tasted. Made the whole house smell nice, too.

Excellent Recipe. Easy and delicious. The sauce is just incredible. Will definitely make again.

Solid side dish. I found the level of sweetness to be right. An hour and a half was a good cooking time for my beets.

Used fresh squeezed orange juice (which was not too sweet) and balsamic vinegar instead of red wine. I also thickened just a tad with cornstarch. A very good staple dish.

I love beets and decided to try this since everyone seemed to love it. I found it much too sweet, and the orange flavor was overpowering. My husband liked it more than I did, but we won't make it again.

This was good for beets and easy to make. My mother, whom is my biggest critic, scowled when I said I would be bringing them to our family's Christmas dinner. Everyone who tried them, including my mother, liked them.

Of my guests who like beets these were a big hit. Now I must have had really large beets becuase some of my beets took more than 3 hours to become tender, thankfully I did these the day before so this didn't really screw up my day.

Very nice, not fabulous. Beets are terrific (we are those yes-we-like-beets people) and we use them often. I'll do this recipe again.

Great way to make beets! I used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar, and they were very good. My husband, who is not a beet lover, liked these very much!

What a wonderful way to liven up a boring veggie! I think the key is baking the beets as it keeps their flavor. I made it as part of the "full menu" and it was perfect for it. It was so simple and nice to be able to make it ahead of your company. I wanted to try the suggestion of putting beets in orange cups, but didn't have time. Maybe the next time I make it, as there will certainly be a next time.

Funny thing about beets...I loved these beets, but was surprised when my husband who is non-plus about this vegetable, found these much to his liking. I served them in the orange shells as well and found that a great solution for the "spreading red beet" on plate.

This is absolutely the best beet recipe I've ever made. Once the beets are baked/roasted, the rest is easy from there. I know--you either LOVE beets or you HATE them. My husband and I happen to love them. This is a recipe that we will definitely be serving often. I have trouble with the butter/margarine though--so I left it out!! Didn't seem to be needed. And we ate them cold, but they were good warm when I tasted them that way too. DELICIOUS.

This is a wonderful beet recipe. This will probably be the dish I make in the future when I crave beets.

I have made this many times--always to good reviews, even from non-beet lovers. The last time I cubed the baked beets, put them in the sauce, and served them in orange cups (hollowed out orange halves with rim dipped in brown sugar). It was not only pretty but kept the beet color from spreading to the rest of the plate.
