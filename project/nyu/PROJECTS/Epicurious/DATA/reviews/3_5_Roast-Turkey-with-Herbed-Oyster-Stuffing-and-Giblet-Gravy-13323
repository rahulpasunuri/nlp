Time consuming - but truly worthy results. followed 97% to the tee. meat arrived jealously succulent, all were held in disbelief. used a fresh, organic 13 lb bird. cooking times were exact, evidenced by the pop-up button. *get fresh shucked oysters, had to buy fridge/canned ones and they were edible but smelly, esp. when cooked. i was afraid it would ruin the stuffing but oysters dissolve anyway & it passed finer noses. get fresh herbs, ripping sage is easy enough but to get fresh thyme off their thin branches, hold the stem with one hand and then pull the leaves off backwards with a few fingers & medium pressure. i forewent the stock/butter/cheesecloth basting @ 20 min intervals by wrapping the entire upside of the bird in bacon. all the oven-opening increases cooking time anyway. so a 1LB pkg of bacon saves time - 1/2 for the stuffing & the other to wrap the bird in. i also brined it overnight, so no need to season inside & out; rub on a little goya adobo outside if you want - that's all. the cavity stuffing will sufficiently season the inside. i didn't have a "V" rack to roast in, but i improvised using a large ceramic casserole with an inverted 6 cup muffin tin to rest the bird on. this circulates heat & drips the fat off which you'll have to pour into a separate pot when making the gravy (deglazing not needeed); pt III of this project. don't give up yet. the giblet/neck stock is easy but getting the meat off the boiled neck for the gravy is tricky. you have to press, push and pull it off the vertebrae; a lot of fingerwork. then mince it together in a blender with the giblets, adding a tiny bit of stock so it doesn't clump. use a nice dry white with the fat/some drippings & flour for your roux, stream in the stock slowly, stir constantly, and you're good to go. For sides, go with homemade cranberry sauce (add sugar), wild rice (steamer), a salad or other greens and a warmed pumpkin pie with super-premium vanilla ice cream. This bird deserves it.

I loved this. I don't know quite what to say other than it was my favorite stuffing ever. Now, if you don't like oysters or anything a little "seafoody" don't do it.

I have only ever done the stuffing, but I have done it 5 years running. I do it without the bacon and outside the turkey. I use brioche or sourdough. Please try it.

This was my 4th year making this stuffing for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I use a sweet bread, brioche, and instead of the bacon I use olive oil. We always have plenty of oysters at the holidays so I put in more than called for. The best stuffing ever!

I prepared this dressing outside of the turkey as it was an additional dressing at the Thanksgiving table. Unfortunately, there wasn't any leftover. I added just a little oyster brine and it wasn't "fishy" at all. I used a pint of fresh, shucked oysters and that yielded precisely 18 oysters. Next time. I will add 1/2 cup white wine after sauteeing the vegetables for extra flavor. Other than this, this dressing is perfect.

I've made this stuffing 5 years in a row with one modification: use half the raw oysters and add 1 can of smoked oysters. No fishy or oyster taste, just an incredible overall flavor. It seems that no matter how much I make, there is none left over!

Both items were excellent! The cheesecloth was absolutely the best way to make the turkey. This was my first ever turkey it it turned out perfectly! The sign of a good turkey is how good it tastes the next day after being chilled in the fridge then used for sandwiches. This turkey made for amazing gourmet quality sandwich meat. However, I did make some modifications which I would definitely repeat: -Stuffed the turkey with sliced apples, quartered onions, & garlic cloves; cooked all the stuffing together -Used 2 cans (the flat type) of smoked oysters which was a great taste with the bacon -Drizzled @ 1.5 cups of chicken broth over the casserole dish before baking the stuffing

This is my first effort at oyster dressing, and it was a huge success at Thanksgiving 2002! In fact, most everyone said it was their favorite dish! I will definitely make this dish again!

This was the most delicious stuffing I've ever had. And a table full of "foodies" agreed. It may hinge on good oysters, mine were in a jar but fresh and very tasty, and they permeated the stuffing with a background flavor and aroma that was distinct and subtle at the same time. Almost like truffle oil. I had no sage, but otherwise followed the recipe faithfully. Well, perhaps I did cut down the celery by half a cup....

Hmmmm... I don't know, edible, but not good. Maybe it is because I had to use oysters from a jar. I am SO glad I tried this before Thanksgiving- I would have been devastated to be stuck with what I ended up with for all of my guests! I am going to stick with a standard this year- Emeril's brined turkey, nothing to exotic about it- for Thanksgiving I think that is what most people want anyway. The turkey itself though, turned out great.

This was my first try at an oyster stuffing after my family rebelled at another "sagey sausage" dressing. It was actually very good. I added much more broth to the dressing than it called for, because it seemed to be going a bit drier than I wanted. Also, instead of following the turkey instructions completely, I rubbed down with butter and all, but cooked on the grill in a bag and roaster pan on low flame. The butter kept the turkey from sticking. Will probably pass on the gravy though. I liked it but they didn't. Can't please them all!

Wow! Fabulous recipe. We followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out really beautifully - lovely golden brown turkey, fabulous stuffing and a gravy to die for. We have used a tried and true roast turkey recipe for holidays for years, but this one is certainly a keeper. There were no malpeque oysters available at our fish market, so we used the big pacific oysters (2 jars, each containing 4 oysters) with great success. We didn't soak them in milk, as some of the other posts suggested, but we our guests are big oyster fans (ourselves included) so we weren't concerned with a too "fishy" flavour. It wasn't fishy in the least, as it turned out. You could tell there were oysters in the stuffing but the flavour was certainly not overpowering. Definitely make the giblet stock from scratch - the layering of flavours is awesome. Try this recipe - you'll be glad you did!

Thanksgiving dinner 2000 was a huge success and I have this receipe to thank for everything! I think I have hit on a new tradition!

This was our first experience with oyster stuffing. I followed the suggestions and soaked the oysters. This was the most talked about item at the table. Everyone loved it, even those who who are not stuffing or oyster fans. Since I didn't stuff the turkey, I added a little more of the giblet stock since it seemed a little dry for dressing. All in all this is an extraordinary recipe.

This recipe was perfect for a large dinner party with divergent tastes. Most had never tried an oyster dressing before, but it was unanimously enjoyed. I did soak the oysters in milk to cut down on the fishy taste, however. All in all agreat recipe, with the perfect accompaniment in the giblet gravy. Would certainly prepare again!

I used just the dressing recipe and it was delicious. After making oyster dressing for years without a recipe and with mixed results I am thrilled to find this recipe. It is a definite keeper, I'll never make oyster dressing any other way.

This stuffing got rave reviews at my house. I cut down on the "too seafood-like" flavor by soaking the oysters in milk.

A bit too seafood tasting, but was overall very good

I must echo the words of the woman from Massachusetts who first made this recipe when it appeared in "Gourmet" in 1992. It has become the family standard; we begin talking about it in early October. I have occasionally been foolish enough to suggest trying a different stuffing recipe, but everyone insists on this one. It's a wonderful tradition. Guy Molnar, Traverse City, Michigan

Most of our 16 guests liked this stuffing (only used the stuffing recipe) but Mom said it tasted too much of oysters. It is a dry stuffing and when I baked the remainder of it I added lots of stock to moisten it.

I first made this recipe for Thanksgiving of 1992. It was such a big hit that every year, I have to drag out my dog-eared copy of the magazine (which has survived three moves and countless spatters) and make it again. It is time consuming but worth the wait.

We love this recipe, especially the stuffing, which is very aromatic and flavorful.
