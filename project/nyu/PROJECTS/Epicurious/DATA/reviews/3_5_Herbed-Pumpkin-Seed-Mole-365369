just watched the video associated with this recipe. Could we get a host that's a little more educated? Lard = Crisco ? C'mon Epicurious.

A good condiment for chicken. I think it needs a bit more of a kick and next time I would kick up te cumin , oregano and salt. I did not use the epazote.

I found epazote at the local market and it takes this from a very good to an excellent sauce. I love it on fish and chicken and the aroma is divine! I will make this many more times.
