I loved these. Thanks to Kirkland WA for the tip on milk and lemon since I had no buttermilk. Can't wait to make them again!

I used sweet onions and it made the thin, sweet onion rings I was craving. (We don't like the thickly battered, overly browned ones.) Substituted skim milk and lemon juice for the buttermilk and it worked just fine. Yum!

Excellent! I use vadalia onion and do not bother to "reserve the smaller inner rings for another use" - they are delicious too!

These were wonderful! The lightest onion rings I've ever had. I soaked the onions for a bit longer than in the recipe (30 minutes or so) and used shortening. My first deep frying at home in 25 years, and they were a great success. Note: the buttermilk marinade makes a great base for a ranch dressing afterwards.

Maybe I did something wrong, but this was a mess and a lot to be desired

A bit messy and labor intensive, but delicious! The seasonings were perfect, and the coating is delicate and almost tempura-like. I used only one large onion, and my husband and I gobbled it all up. Next time, I will put the buttermilk mixture in a big Ziplock bag and soak the onions that way.
