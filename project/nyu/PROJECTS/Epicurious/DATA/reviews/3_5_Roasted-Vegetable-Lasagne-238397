I had high expectations for this recipe as it is quite labor intensive. I ended up roasting some garlic and then mashing it in to the bechamel sauce. Even two days later I'm surprised at the flatness of this dish. I thought the flavors would be more intense. The next time I'm just going to toss the roasted vegetables in high quality fresh pasta like De Cecco and add cheese on top(with no heavy bechamel) to mute flavors.

I won't review this recipe because I changed it so much. However, the end result was really excellent and had a ton of flavor. Plus this recipe seems very adaptable. The first change I made was to increase the amount of vegetables, cheese, etc. to fit a 9x13 in pan. I also roasted some shallots and added them chopped to each layer. For the zucchini layer I used one large zucchini and one large yellow squash. Instead of the bechamel sauce I made a creamy roasted tomato sauce with fresh basil and added the cheese (fontina, mozzarella, and romano) to each layer. The end result was excellent, and I would highly recommend this recipe with or without changes.

Roasting vegetables is key to the flavor. The smell in the house when roasting and baking this lasagna makes me want it all that much more. We use more vegetables that what is called for, but then again we really like the roasted veggies.

Good. Nothing spectacular. I doubled the amount of garlic. Added spinach. Left out the pepper. The sauce was good and pretty easy to make. I was disappointed to find the final lasagne, however, a bit bland. However, I do think soaking in itself in the fridge served this lasagne well: leftovers on day 2 were tastier.

This is the first time I've left a review and this lasagna is scrumptious! Give yourself time to make it once, but then you'll love it so much and figure out ways to prep faster. If you've never made béchamel sauce before, it's a fantastic recipe to learn and then you'll make it all the time for many other pasta dishes. I use whatever vegetables (and cheese) I have in my frig, especially the ones about to go off. Sometimes I add a little leftover chicken sausage. You can't go wrong. The last time I made it with butternut squash, lots of colorful bell peppers and fresh spinach and mushrooms (that I sauteed first). Guests have 2- 3 helpings and clean the entire pan. Have fun!

Overall a tasty dish. To involved in making this, the timing was way off on roasting vegetables. Needs to be simplified a bit.

I've never left a review before, but love this recipe so much I just had to! I did what many others suggested and added red sauce in addition to the bechamel I also add (and in a pinch have replaced with) mozzarella cheese. I enjoy it with the pesto as well and have also at times added a layer of sliced tomato. I am making this tonight and am going to try adding spinach. This recipe is so much easier than it initially seems to make, pretty quick to put together, packed with veggies and not only do my husband and I love it, but my 2 year old gobbles it up and even helps me assemble the layers. A keeper!

Definitely read all the reviews to liven this one up. I reduced the amount of white sauce in favor of some red, and also a thin layer of pesto. I used fewer mushrooms and more red peppers. Also used some traditional lasagne cheese in place of some (not all!) of the recipe's cheese. I was worried that I was adding too many ingredients and all the flavors would be lost, but it wasn't the case!

I did what previous reviewers said and did both the bechamel sauce and a tomato sauce, and layered the sauces every other throughout the lasagne. I also used less eggplant and more yellow squash and zucchini, and added a bunch of mozzarella to various layers and on top. Although there are a number of components it was still an easy recipe to tackle, and the result was really, really good. I'll try this again with different vegetables from my CSA box.

I added roast tomatoes and a sweet basil and tomato sauce. Without this, I think it may have been a little bland and less lasagney. A great vego dish, I will be making it again.

This is the first time I ever made white sauce, instead of using ricotta, for a lasagne, and the improvement in flavour was quite distinct. I did however increase the cheese. I also made a red sauce to go with the lasagna and added roast mushrooms, which I love. The result was a hit.

I hate no-boil noodles! This recipe is great, with the exception of using no-boil noodles. If I make this again, I will find a way to use regular lasagne noodles.

I thought this was just okay, a bit bland. I substitued gouda for fontina. The bechamel really wasn't worthwhile. I even included some red sauce as previous reviewers did. I also made the mistake of using gluten free (rice) no boil noodles and they had a bad, tough texture. Anyway, maybe it was my modifications/screw ups, but I wouldn't make this again.

I made this recipe as listed except I doubled the recipe. I also use the extra fontina and parm-reg as another reviewer suggested. I can't seem to get the layers to come out as suggested, so my top layer is usually noodles with shredded parm or a shredded parmesan, asiago, romano mix - whatever I have on hand. Makes nice crunchy top that everyone loves. This is a favorite at our house. Also it can be made and frozen for a future meal. Defrost in the microwave then bake for about 1 1/2 hours.

I added a layer of ricotta cheese/egg mixture after the pasta layer. The recipe turned out nicely though I was a tad short on the sauce for the final topping.

I make this slightly differently each time. Most recently I ran out of milk so I used half milk, half plain yogurt. I used a bit more Fontina, plus a few oz fresh Mozzarella in the cheese sauce. I put pesto in with one of the veggie layers rather than putting basil in the sauce. I agree about adding different veggies such as tomatoes, onion, etc. I layered some homemade tomato sauce on the bottom this time and it added a layer of sweetness.

After reading all of the reviews, I made a few changes to the recipe and the result was a rich, luscious lasane. Because I believe that more cheese is always better, I used 8 oz fontina and about 1 cup of parmigiana reggiano. Following the advice of another reviewer, I made a tomato sauce in addition to the bechamel: saute 1 onion in butter, add one big can san marzano tomatoes and 1 can tomato paste and cook about 45 minutes. Buzz lightly with the immersion blender. For the veg, I roasted portabella mushrooms as well as those listed. When I layered, I did pasta, tomato sauce, pasta, one of the vegetables, bechamel, pasta, then repeated. Bake as directed and the result is a decadent lasagne. Yum!

I really liked this, especially with it being the first recipe from this site. However I would have to say it was slightly bland. I think next time I make it I will add more mushrooms, maybe some onion and some other tricks Ha! But I really enjoyed it, more so since I didn't burn anything..

This was a hit with my family. Instead of doing eggplant I roasted a tray with tomatoes, garlic (in the skin) and onions. I also added a layer of fresh mozzarella. I highly recommend it.

I made this for a group of vegatarians and omnivores, including 4 kids and everyone gobbled it up.

While making this recipe, I told my family I would never make it again - it took too long and used too many pots and pans. The kitchen was a mess. But after one bite... it was all worth it. Have made it several times since. So, so yummy.

Loved it!!! Made a few changes...roasted tomatoes with other vegs, and added one layer of ricotto/pesto mix for extra flavor. Even my brother who dislikes 'cheesy' dishes loved this, I didn't find the flavor heavy at all. Wonderful!

This recipe worked out really well - HOWEVER, based on other reviewers' comments about its blandness, I made a very simple but intense tomato sauce (sauteed onions plus 500 ml tomato sauce, reduced until very thick) and added it with the roasted vegetables. And I couldn't find Fontina in Paris, where I made it, so I used peppered Pecorino instead. Worked perfectly, looked stunning and tasted even better. (Cooked it the day after putting it together and it took at least an hour in the oven).

This recipe was great. I added portabella and tomatoes for flavor. Next time I would slice the vegetables thicker and use less oil when baking. They were a little soggy. I also added Pecorino for a salty flavor. I would recommend not putting sauce on top, but rather a layer of noodles then some parmesan and pecorino. This creates a nice crusty top. Overall this recipe is definitely going into my box.

This is good and really adaptable. I'm not crazy about eggplant, so I used an extra layer of roasted peppers one time. Another time I did roasted tomatoes, which was good and added a different flavor. I could see doing this with all sorts of different veggies in different combinations.

I thought this dish was pretty tasty. I added the pesto as suggested by another reviewer and omitted the peppers and used tomatoes instead. The only thing was that my boyfriend and I were up half the night with indigestion, probably from the garlic. (We also had a pretty garlicky garlic bread along with it so I guess it was just a little garlic overload for us.) It certaily was "lush" tasting - almost verging on a little heavy. Maybe that's how lasagne is supposed to be. I had thought of fixing an eggplant parmesan, which I love but which can be a little intense, and thought this would be a bit lighter. Oh well! As I said it was pretty delicious.

This lasagne is good and fresh tasting, but I felt it could have been more flavorful. I think adding the mushrooms would be a good idea to give the lasagne a bolder taste.

I was pretty disappointed by this recipe--it didn't taste like anything! I added pesto and lemon zest too it, but still-- blah! white goo on white vegetables--my poor farmer's market zucchini!

I, too, enjoyed this lasagna very much. Next time I would roast more vegetables than the recipe calls for. I only had enough for one zucchini layer and added a layer of diced tomatoes. In addition I added a layer of sauteed mushrooms. Regular lasagna noodles work fine. Add grated parmesan on top of the final layer of bechamel. Very rich flavors. Excellent served with a field greens salad with sliced strawberries, spicy / sugary toasted pecans, blue cheese, and a honey - balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Mmmmmm!

I have to admit I did not follow the recipe to a T. I did not have red peppers so I used eggplant, zucchini, and roasted tomatoes. Instead of layering the veggies, after roasting and letting them cool off a bit I chopped them coarsely and mixed them with the chopped basil (I trippled the amount of basil, added more flavour and did not overwhelm the nice sauce). I didn't have fontina either so I only added a high quality Parmigiano to the Bechamel and it was delicious. I made it yesterday for my mother-in-law's birthday party. Everybody raved about it and even had second helpings.

I followed the recipe exactly. Using ITALIAN fontina--rather than domestic or Scandinavian makes all the difference. Everyone loved it! There's no need to waste so much eggplant though. Buy one just large enough to provide enough crosswise slices to form a full layer in your pan.

Followed the suggesstions of the Savannah, GA cook except I put all the zucchini on bottom layer and added a mushroom layer. The 2 tablespoons of pesto added just enough flavorand did not overwhelm the other flavors. The red pepper is a must but I would cut it into strips to make the Lasagne easier to cut! I baked it in a 7 1/2x11 inch dish. Made 6 generous servings. Yes, it will be made again and again--especially if the grandchildren like it also.

Great lasagne. I'll use more eggplant next time, and probably sprinkle some cheese on top, but otherwise great as is. I'm making it again this weekend for guests!

This was really really good. I did modify it a bit: I didn't have any red peppers so I only used eggplant, zucchini, and yellow squash. I layered the roasted vegetables with dabs of basil pesto. Also, I added a handful of grated mozarrella in addition to the grated fontina. While I was roasting the veggies I also roasted a head of garlic and I smashed a few roasted cloves and added them to the bechamel. I didn't use the other, raw, minced garlic. I used regular lasagne noodles, soaked in boiling water for a while. I have a baby and need to prep when I have time so I roasted the vegetables one day, made the bechamel cheese sauce and assembled the lasagne on the second day, and baked it the third day. The noodles held up fine. I could probably have skipped the soaking part as I let it sit in the fridge for so long, assembled.

We loved this recipe. I added roasted mushrooms in the zucchini layer. Also, I used about 2 tablespoons of homemade pesto in place of the fresh basil. I didn't have no-boil noodles, so I cooked regular lasagne noodles and used them. The flavors worked very well together. I'll definitely make this again!

The general idea of this recipe was good, but the sauce did not have as much flavor as we would have liked. I think it would be improved by adding roasted tomatoes and increasing the basil.
