This recipe results in a very crispy duck skin and the sauce is tangy and delicious. It's also quite easy. A nice way to make duck that isn't sweet like so many recipes.

Yummy! I made this recipe this evening and my husband and I thought it was fabulous. The sauce is lovely in combination with the duck. I also followed the idea of another reviewer and deglazed the pan I cooked the duck in with cognac, scraping up the brown bits. I then poured that into the sauce. I definitely will make this recipe again and highly suggest it to everyone.

I've made this a couple of times and have enjoyed it immensely. Maybe it's just me, but there seems to be a trick to getting the skin really crispy, and I haven't mastered it yet. No matter, it's still pretty good. Also substituted black peppercorns in the sauce, and I thought it came out great.

I have made this dish several times-- very easy but delicious! You really have to be careful on searing the duck, depending on your stove. I had a gas stove the 1st time I made it, and it was very effortless. Having used an electric stove, I had a much more difficult time controlling the heat as well, so the heat has to be adjusted down (in the initial preheat). This one's impressive!
