Simple, easy, tastes great!!! Leave some of the jalapeno seeds in to give it a better spicy flavor. Look for skirt steak with some fat in it but not to much - cook it quickly and turn with in 1-1/2 to 2 minutes - medium rare is preferred (by some of us anyway!!!)

This recipe was bland. It has potential, but I would add more ingredients to give it a little "ummph". Try: mushrooms, red wine, & peppers. Would only try again if I was in the mood to experiment.

I didn't have regular canned whole tomatoes, but used instead a can of fire roasted tomatoes from Trader Joes...sauce came out GREAT! I don't think it would have been as good using regular canned tomatoes. Also, I didn't have any chiles, so instead, I sprinkled a little chipotle chile powder on the steak before cooking...added a good kick!

Loved the sauce. My steak was a little tough. ANy suggestions?
