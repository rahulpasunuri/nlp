If your favorite part of a gratin is the crispy part on top, you'll love this dish. I mostly followed the recipe and used the amount of butter specified. The only changes I made were sauteing the mushrooms longer, adding a tiny bit of cheese in the mushroom layer to help it stick to the potatoes, and baking a little longer to get the potatoes well-caramelized. I was also very generous with the salt. I liked all the butter since it gave the dish a nice crust, amalgamated the layers, and gave the galette a rich flavor. But the dish could probably be made with less, or with some olive oil substituted. I like the recipe as is, but it's also great starting point for improvising and creating your own signature dish.

To get this to four stars you have to cut the butter by a half a stick and add two ounces of Gruyere cheese. Grate and layer the cheese on the potato slices after you season each layer. We used Herbs de Provence Sea Salt and cracked India extra special bold peppercorns. I ended up leaving the potatoes in for 50 minutes because we wanted them crispy on the top(bottom). They presented very well and we had compliments all around.

I made this a couple of years ago. It was great, but you have to use more butter, to make sure the potatoes caramelize, like a tarte tartin. It was heavenly with the oyster mushrooms, really earthy and went really well with the black truffle turkey!

I am making this dish again after making it for a new year's eve dinner. I did make changes, though. Used a mix of crimini and reconstituted dried porcini sauteed with finely chopped shallots and onions (can do this in the am and leave, covered on the counter until needed same day). Fresh thyme is great but dried works well. Cut the butter, you don't need all of it. I'm trying butter and olive oil next time. Salt (sea salt)and pepper are absolutly necessary. I served this with a roast filet and will serve it with sauteed chicken breasts in a vermouth, dijon mustard and cream sauce.

This is great. We have made it to go with pork roasts, tenderloin roasts, etc. When I serve it for guests they always ask for the recipe. I add 1/4 cup parmesian cheese to the butter when I coat the potatoes. And Fresh thyme is essential. I have made it with many kinds of mushrooms and all work.

The dish was slightly soggy but I did not slice the potatoes thin enough. I also did not season the potatoes enough with salt and pepper. I will try this again with less butter and more seasoning.

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I only had half as much butter and half as much time to prepare it. So, I microwaved for 10 minutes before baking. The dish was great. The second time I made it according to the recipe and it turned out greasy and soggy. I will make it again but only with the modifications I mentioned.

This was a definte weird recipe- it was really greasy and didn't even stay together in wedges- we ended up scopping it out of the pie dish with a spatula- it's better if you just slice some potatoes up on a baking dish, drizzle with a little olive oil and make a ranch dressing packet.

I made 2 of these for a Thanksgiving dinner party, and I don't think anyone went for seconds. I was very disappointed - wished I had just mashed them.

As mentioned by the previous reviewers, this is a bit on the greasey side however the flavor was not bad. I used shitake mushrooms which gave a nice earthy mushroom flavor. With some minor adjustments such as cutting back on the butter and increasing the herbs, this might not be that bad. I happened to enjoy the crunchy potato pieces.

Don't waste your time on this one. Not worth the work at all. It was a greasy, slippery mess that didn't stick together when served. Save yourself a lot of time with better results by slicing potatoes while sauteeing mushrooms. Melt a half stick of butter and add minced or dried thyme. Arrange slices in shallow glass dish. Drizzle with thyme butter, cover with plastic wrap and Microwave for 15 minutes on high, turning dish once. You won't get the browned edges on the potatoes, but my guests pushed those off to the sides of their plates anyway.
