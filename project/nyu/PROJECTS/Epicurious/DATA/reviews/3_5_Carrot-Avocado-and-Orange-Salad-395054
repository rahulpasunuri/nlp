Haven't made this yet, but noticed that there is some discussion in the reviews about what one is meant to do with the orange. Bluemoon72 is wrong on this one-- what is intended is called making "supremes" as an earlier reviewer mentioned. This is done by cutting off the two ends of the citrus, then cutting off the pith and peel in strips with a paring knife (when I first learned to do this it reminded me of skinning a pineapple). This will leave you with the fruit in segments and the membranes between each segment. With the paring knife cut along each membrane to separate the individual segments. This gives you pretty, intact segments for your salad without any pith or membrane. Talking about lemons was a confusing move by the author, I've only once done this with lemons but supreme oranges and grapefruit all the time.

This was a delicious salad with fresh crabs from our dock. The spice mix with the roasted carrots was outstanding and unexpected with these ingredients. Sectioning the oranges was the most work, but worth it. I will make this again and have already shared the recipe with others.

We really wanted to like this, but it just didn't work for us. We like every component, but it was not good as a dish. We ended up pushing bits around our plates.

We loved this salad. I chopped larger carrots down to finger size. I was heavy handed on the red pepper. Will cut down to a tsp.

I made this for Mother's Day and was afraid it would be too spicy for my mom, who normally has no tolerance at all for spicy foods. She loved it, despite the heat, and so did everyone else. The avocado and oranges did a nice job of cooling the dish. I thought the three main ingredients went together beautifully, and the combination of spices was very good.

This salad didn't do much for me. I like the main ingredients, but maybe not combined with cumin and coriander. I don't know what went wrong or how to make it better.It could be the cumin and coriander in this salad that I don't like.

Surprisingly delicious. The 3 main ingredients work together very well and the spicing is perfect. I served everything at room temperature and it was great. Used regular carrots, peeled, and cut baby size. Want to make this again! Don't be put off by the rambling prose in the recipe; the end result is worth it!

This recipe is FANTASTIC! The flavor is amazing. It's so healthy and fresh and delicious. HUGE winner. I'm making it for my mom as a side for mother's day. I also roasted beets since I had a bunch left over from our farmers market box and they came out equally delicious. Next time I'm planning on adding some sweet potato to the mix as well :)

A note about the orange segments: my thought is she meant to section the orange like a GRAPEFRUIT, not a lemon. E.g., cut the orange in half, cut the segments out from the membranes with a paring knife or grapefruit spoon, then squeeze the leftover membrane-and-juice-filled half orange shell, like you'd squeeze grapefruit juice into your bowl (or mouth, lol). Repeat with other half. Hope that helps!

Great salad, you can easily add couple pinches more of salt.

Great for lunch/dinner when you want something bright and lively, but not heavy. Prep was a lot less involved than it looked. I substituted a couple of pinches of ground Cayenne (to taste) in place of the pequins because that's what I had on hand.

We want to add more "healthy" fats to our diet with avocado...based on these comments, this recipe seems to fit the bill. (In regards to segmenting the orange, the proper terminology is "supreming".)

Unbelievably good. I accidentally bought blood oranges but they were perfect. I cut them into quarters and squeezed them in, then scooped out what was left into the salad, which was probably not as pretty, but still yummy.

Delicious! What's not to love about the avocado-orange combination? Even better, the roasted carrots on their own were a treat! Since the tops of the carrots were looking a little rough, I cut them off. This could be why they cooked a lot faster (?) This salad alone was substantial enough as a meal. I may repeat this recipe and substitute avocado oil for olive oil to enhance the warmth. Either way, it's a great recipe!

delicious, simple, and comes together quickly - we enjoyed it with the pancetta roast chicken with walnut stuffing recipe (also on epicurious) and some sauteed kale.

I cut down the quantity of ingredients to 1/3 but used all the garlic and spices. It was tasty. I suggest being very sure the carrots are well roasted for the best texture.

Just a comment to the above post. I believe you peel the orange, release the segments for the salad, then squeeze what is left over (the membranes).

Lovely blend of flavors! Didn't have young carrots so just used regular ones, peeled and cut into 2.5 in pieces. I mixed with red quinoa to make it a more substantial main dish and it was perfect. Only, I didn't really understand the deal with the oranges - squeeze them then peel them? but arrange as slices?
