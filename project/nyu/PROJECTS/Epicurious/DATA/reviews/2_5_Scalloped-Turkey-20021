This recipe is an annual tradition for us. You do, definitely, have to have a lot of gravy, and because we baste our turkey with wine it's flavorful stuff. I delete the hard-boiled eggs, of course. I might try the sour cream or cream-of-mushroom ideas this year. Usually I just stretch the gravy with some canned stock. It also benefits from spices. Or just a heap of salt.

This recipe is a great BASE recipe. The stuffing is the key - it must have a lot of flavor.

I think the problem is with the topping. Here is what I did. 1. I left the eggs out. 2. I sprinkled a generous amound of grated cheese on top of the mushrooms. 2. I beat together 3 cups of soured cream with two eggs and poured it over the dish. Last I sprinkled grated cheese on top and baked. It was very good. Next time I might top it with a light bechamel sauce.

Made this recipe using two cups of gravy and one cup of sour cream as described by the first reviewer. It made it okay, but this meal is very bland. It really need the help of some spices. Maybe leaving the eggs out, too. I don't anticipate making this again.

The recipe is rather vague as to the amount of gravy needed - I had one cup of turkey gravy and added one cup sour cream and heated it together then poured over the top, the whole dish was very dry. I think if you had 2 cups gravy and 2 cups sour cream OR added a can of cream of mushroom soup and 2 cups milk or sour cream the dish would really be excellent. A very good way to use up leftover turkey.
