Having tried the Butterscotch Budino in Mario Battali's Mozza Pizzeria in LA, I tried the topping here. I don't believe it's the same. I caramelized this to a medium/deep amber and the sauce is about the same color as at Mozza, but lacks something. They have done something else to their sauce that I don't believe is captured in this recipe. Thoughts?

This recipe was fantastic, but I wish that I would have known how it would have transformed overnight! It was just okay the night I made it after the 3 hour chilling, but the next morning my god it was amazing! I served it with Nocino walnut liquor that I ordered online at K&L wine merchants and it could not have been a better pairing! cazzacooks: You have to use a high fat cream or else it will turn grainy, and the cornstarch has to be added to cold eggs and whisked in completely in order for it to be smooth.

I read the reviews before I tried to make this recipe and then I did make it and it turned out fine. But, it is vague when it tells you to caramelize the brown sugar and water, you need to actually caramelize the sugar to at least 320 degrees to start to get any flavor out of it. You can go as high as 360 but must use a thermometor. Going by color is not going to happen, it is brown to start with. There is also a big difference between the saltiness of different brands of Kosher salt. Mortons is almost twice as salty as Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt. I think that it was a nice dessert and hope that other people will still try it.

I have had this dish at the restaurant and I have made it at home too. The Mozza version was definitely superior, but mine was good too. The most difficult task is getting the sugar mixture to the dark amber color without over or under doing it. I under did it because the brown sugar imparted a dark color from the beginning and I was overly worried about burning it. It didn't quite get to the deep color of the one I had at Mozza. Next time I'll try for a darker color. If someone thinks that the flavor is too mild, they must have cooked the sugar for the 7 min. estimate in the recipe. Actually, the amber color should be your guide and not cooking time. The caramel sauce was amazing too. I used whipped cream instead of creme fraiche.

Too salty!! The budino was not very flavorful--didn't taste like butterscotch, or really anything. But the caramel and whipped topping were great. Just not great enough to help the pudding. A big disappointment after the real thing at Mozza.

Warning: not for the faint of stomach. This is a SUPER rich, intense dessert. Batali's portions are HUGE for how intense this is; I made 1/2 recipe for New Year's and served it in 5 oz servings, and none of us could finish even one of our own. It really needs a long time to get very cold, and it is salty- you must like Salt Caramel to like this. I found it difficult to avoid graininess, even with straining. I also thought that the creme fraiche topping tasted like yogurt, and though it does need some sort of counterbalance, a bitter element, like dark chocolate, would do better than sour. A thin shortbread dipped in dark chocolate would make a great accompaniment, with regular whipped cream that wasn't too sweet. It IS delicious, but I would advise cutting down the 8 oz. servings he divides it into, and it could easily be made with something less rich than 3 cups of heavy cream. All half-and-half would work just fine. And start with less salt, taste to adjust, you may not want it as salty as he makes it.

I am lucky enough to have eaten at Mozza- I highly recommend it if you are in LA...having had this dessert at the restaurant, I was excited to try it at home- it is as delicious as in the restaurant- though, there they serve it with two little rosemary and pine nut short bread cookies- I used a recipe from epicurious for the rosemary shortbread and just added a few pine nuts as garnish before baking. Delicious!

Read the directions carefully before starting as I added the cream, milk AND egg, egg yolk, cornstarch together before I saw large bowl and medium bowl. All worked out just fine but clearer directions on the budino would have helped.

This is a great dessert, but very rich. So, it may be worth it to serve smaller portions.

Fantastic and delicious!
