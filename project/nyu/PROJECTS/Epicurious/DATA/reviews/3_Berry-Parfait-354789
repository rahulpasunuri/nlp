This was a big disappointment. The pudding texture was grainy and soupy and the cracker crumbs were like eating sand. Not a fan at all.

Fairly healthy for a desert. Will try with Splenda next time to reduce calories. Didn't cook the berries, but used fresh blueberries, blackberries and strawberries. Made for a pleasing presentation worthy of company. I'll be putting this one in my recipe box.
