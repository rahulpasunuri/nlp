I make this all the time. I double the broccoli recipe using frozen and because I don't eat pasta, I give my family half of it with pasta and I keep the rest of the broccoli as a side dish. Because it uses frozen broccoli, it's something you can make anytime you can't get to the market.

A dish as simple as this begs for fresh and good quality ingredients, both of which are hard to come by where I live. I increased the garlic and red pepper flakes, used less oil and used fresh broccoli. I used good quality oil and freshly grated Parmesan. My husband liked it which made this dish a success for me, since he's my harshest critic. This will be a good go to recipe for busy evenings.

Very tasty and quick/easy. Used fresh broccoli instead,more garlic and a little less olive oil. Will definitely make again.

it is okay a bit spicier that i expected. I have a feeling this isn't making it into my rotation.

Great broccoli recipe. I did use fresh broccoli instead of frozen, and I added two slices of cooked, crumbled bacon to the top. It tasted great. Even my hubby enjoyed the broccoli!

Some more quick and easy Italian cooking. I have to admit that I took inspiration from an earlier review and started with a little bacon. I had fresh Sprouting Broccoli, so used that, and as I had a bottle of white wine open, instead of adding water or stock, I poured in about a 1/4 cup of that, let it cook down a little, then covered for a few minutes until the broccoli started to wilt. I used Lumicorti as there was no Orecchiette in the shop, and I wasn't keen on hand making my own after a 12 hour shift. As with all simple recipes like this, good, fresh ingredients pay huge dividends, and the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

This dish has grown on me. I made it with fresh broccoli (left over from another meal) and used chicken stock instead of water. My only complaint is that I would have liked a more substantial sauce. I was thinking a touch of cream, broth or white wine with the pasta water would have done it. The parmesan clumped up because there was so little liquid to combine with. However, the flavors are even better the next day and I really don't mind the lack of liquid.

I made this with orzo and it worked very well. My family thought it was too spicy (although I loved it) so I'll cut the pepper flakes in half next time.

This was awful. I should have known from reading the cooking time of the broccoli but thought I would try it as many people had reviewed it well. It was mushy and tasteless even with extra garlic and red pepper. I was also curious to cook with the orecchiette for the first time but it was a waste with this recipe.

I've made this dish a few times, and each time my husband and I have loved it. I have tweaked it a little bit, and now find it even better. I sautee the broccoli in a little olive oil and garlic, then add the cooked pasta, a can of cannellini beans (drained), and a can of diced tomatoes. After the flavors combine, I add the red pepper flakes, fresh basil and asiago or parmesan cheese. It is delicious, and so easy.

I make this a lot-- it so easy and quick! But I like to use fresh broccoli and I add pancetta. Just cook the pancetta in the frying pan, then add the garlic, a little less oil, red pepper, broccoli, and then steam. I also like pecorino romano instead.

Change the water to either low fat or non fat chicken or beef bouillon.Cook the Broccoli separate for 5 minutes in advance. Drain and add to the garlic oil mixture.Stir for a moment to coat the broccoli with the oil. Then add the bouillon and bring to temperature. Done.

I thought the dish was super simple and that's exactly what I was looking for after a long day at work. I added extra pepper flakes and Italian sausages. Accompanied with a nice red wine, perfection.

I added a lot more hot pepper and served with grilled chicken which I shredded in my mini prep so it was ground up.

Yum! I used fresh broccoli & chopped into bite-size florets. I also used fettucine instead of orecchiette. It was delicious. We loved the crisp broccoli with the garlic, cheese & pepper flakes. Next time I will not use long noodles, because they were a little diffifult to manage with the broccoli. Also, best to eat fresh. The broc. is not as crisp after the microwave, but still ok. We loved this!

My kids LOVE this recipe!! Seriously, it is so quick and simple. I throw it together on a week night, everyone gobbles it up, and the kids rave about what a great cook I am. What more could you ask for?! I think the simple flavors appeal to the kids, but it is nice for adults as well. The flavors are subdued, but very pleasing. Our new comfort food...

The only reason I did not give it "4 forks" bis because it didn't knock my socks off. Otherwise, for a minimal recipe, it was delish. A great dish for vegetarian guests! It was simple and my three year old loved it. I made it with sea shell pasta because my grocery store doesn't carry orecchiette. What a great idea. Very good and a repeat for us!

I've been making a version of this recipe for years. I also throw in a can of artichoke hearts (rinsed and quartered) right at the end. It's a good, simple dinner. Nothing fancy. You can also use gnocchi.

I was a little less than overwhelmed on this one. I may not have added enough cheese and ballparked the ingredients, but in my opinion, it was just a pasta and veggie dish- not really worth a recipe that I kept running back to the computer to follow.

This was amazingly good, given how easy it was! Much more than the sum of its parts. Btw - I did not need the reserved water. I think whether or not you need it depends on (1) how thoroughly you have drained the pasta and (2) how much of the liquid is left in the pan with the broccoli (which will depend on how hot the pan was and how tightly covered).

This is an easy dish, I used canned chicken broth instead of water and it added a nice taste.

Great recipe! Very tasty! I used fresh broccoli and it turned out just fine. I did not, however, add the reserved water, so the cheese was thicker, which I prefer. So easy to make and the ingredients are easily acquired.

Delicious! Using frozen broccoli made it so easy. I added a generous amount of salt as well to bring out the cheese in the sauce. Will definitely make this healthy, yummy dish again.

I make this dish all the time with broccoli rabe. It's delicious. It's nice when you can come home from work and make dinner in 15 minutes and it's healthy.

Nice lunch dish. I would use fresh brocolly next time. Easy!

Nice recipe. Relatively healthy with ingredients you should be able to find around the house. DO add the reserved water. Also don't skimp on the cheese. I added a chicken breast to make it a bit more filling.
