I took the advice of many reviewers and assembled the pork the night before. It's time consuming but worth the effort. I also used half of the porcini mushrooms called for and used shiitake for the other half. I would recommend searing the roll as it helps the roll keep its shape. Very impressive! I served it with an old world wine... 2006 Chateauneuf de Pape. Will definitely make this again.

I had 14 guests for dinner and took the challenge to make this dish. It sounded wonderful for a group this large. I had the butcher butterfly a whole pork loin. It was huge!! I had overnight guests so we had fun putting this together the night before. The next time I will use spinach. The kale was just a bit too much texture for me and a little strong. There was a lot of Kale left on plates. I used 1/2 dried porcini mushrooms and half shitake. I don't think the expense of the dried porcini was necessary except for the flavor that the soaking water gave to the excellent sauce. Put the granny smith's in for the last 20 min as suggested. Mushy and not really flavorful to eat but added to the sauce flavor. I wouldn't plan on serving the apples. Because the loin was so big, it had to be cut in half to fit in a commercial size pan. Everyone kept saying how it would take forever to cook so against my better judgement and the previous reviewers, I cooked it for 1 hr 25 min. I think it would have been more moist if it had been 1 hr10 at the most. I did not sear, which might have helped hold the juices better too. I did not cook the ground pork. Beautiful presentation and while time consuming, fun to make with friends the night before...with a couple glasses of wine of course! Served with roasted asparagus and brussel sprouts and rosemary garlic roasted potatoes. 1 slice was enough per person, maybe someone had 2 but I have a lot left over. Warmed up well in the microwave with extra sauce. My guests enjoyed it!

This is the second time I've made this recipe and it is so good and beautiful!! I used spinach instead of kale and fresh cremini mushrooms instead of the dry. Presentation is very impressive.

I made this last year for Christmas and then woke up Christmas morning with the worst flu I have ever had. Had a friend wrap the roasts, because I had done two of them and put them in the freezer. We pulled the first one out in March and it was one of the best meats I have made. Am making it again for this Christmas.

I did not make this, but had the pleasure of a great friend and great cook serving it to me and 7 other guests for my birthday dinner on Saturday. It was spectactular. I realize it is time consuming, however being able to do it the day before will enable me to serve it during the holidays.

I have a mixed review on this recipe. The roast's aroma and presentation were great BUT the apples fell apart and I thought that the filling lacked something. I cooked according to the recipe. My guests loved it, I liked it - but it's a time consuming recipe to only like. I will make this again but for the filling: use a sweet Italian sausage, increase the spices, and maybe increase the apples. I will decrease the amount of apples for the roast to cook on and I would peel them - then as the roast rests puree them for the sauce. The sauce was very good. The recipe is good but I think it could use some tweaking. Also, the roast does cook faster than the recipe states so watch your times.

Exceptional dish! But Nix the ground pork! It's absolutely unnecessary with so many wonderful, complimentary layers of savory flavor. There seems to be numerous comments about a "dry result." I maintain a moist roast & filling by first, simply braising the rinsed, wet kale in a piping hot skillet. Use fresh sliced (Gala) apples (cut 1/8") in the filling, rather than re-hydrated, as most versions suggest. Avoid directly salting the loin at any time. Tying up the roast should require technique and patience, as you should be dealing with a fairly wet product by this time (it's 50% larger than shown!) A tight, plastic wrapped roast and minimum 3 hrs in the fridge is essential. Browning or searing can be done safely within 20 minutes of being removed from the fridge - the roast is still firm and this limits any small portions from coming loose. Lightly cover the roast with foil for the first 60 minutes, then remove & baste at least once. The result is an evenly cooked, firm but incredibly moist roast with an earthy, succulent reduction.

This dish was not only tasty, but pleasing on the eye. I added dried cranberries to the filling, used fresh mushrooms and apples, but otherwise followed the recipe. The only exception was that I seasoned and browned the ground pork along with the other ingredients. I didn't bother browning the roast before sticking it into the oven. The prosciutto gave it enough color. I'll be making this again!

I made this for dinner this evening; even my mushroom-hating 7-1/2 year old daughter LOVED it. Absolutely gorgeous presentation (the prosciutto crisped up nicely; the kale kept its dark green color). Took forever (3 hours start to finish), but definitely worth it.

I found this recipe to be worth all of the effort, but that the apples make the dish. I didn't have dried apples for the stuffing, so I used fresh and that worked beautifully. I also sliced rather than halved the remaining apples for quantity purposes and that worked well too. I will definitely make this again, but only on special special occasions for cost and effort purposes.

Cooked it at 380 F for the full 1 hour and 40 min before it reached 140 degrees throughout. So Succulent and savory! This recipe is the works!

Would have been better cooked at a lower temperature. The apples burned and the kale in the stuffing saved the roast - flavours were still very good. Used celery instead of dried apple as I wasn't sure about all the sweet flavours. Will make again but cook for less time.

Made this for a dinner party this weekend. Did not use the ground pork in the stuffing. Instead, I added about 1 cup of toasted pecans. Had no problem with moistness (another reivew indicated that the ground pork helped keep it moist). It was still really moist. Did not brine the meat but definitely would next time; although the stuffing was delicious, the meat itself could have benefitted from the brining. A modification I did make: I deglazed the roasting pan at the end (to make the sauce) with cider, then I added the mushroom and chicken broths to that, plus I made a roux and then added the sauce to that, to thicken it up a bit more. Very tasty. I'd say the gravy was what really made this sing, but all in all it's a good recipe, and great for a party, as you can prepare in advance (what a lifesaver!).

WOW! This was go good. Company raved about it. Followed recipe to a T except for the butter. I omitted it since we are dairy free but quite frankly I don't think you would miss it. I would cut down on the cooking time though and tent it for longer. The presentation is beautful too- I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
Great Recipe. Follow it exactly and don't skip the sauce which I think makes the recipe. The uncooked ground pork stuffing makes the roast moist. That combined with the crunchy exterior made this recipe a hit with the family. One that doesn't like pork roasts because they are dry thought this was the best pork he had eaten.

Made this for a dinner party saturday night. I was afraid of undercooking with the raw pork in the center, so I think I left it in a little longer than I should have, but it tasted great. Followed others directions and it does not need to be browned in the skillet. Cooked at 375, and added the apples 30 minutes after the start of cooking, they were yummy. Also thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch.

Thank you to all the reviewers that gave feedback on the too-high temperature and the too-long cooking time in the original recipe. We cooked this at 350F for what ended up to be 1 hour and 35 minutes. I checked the temperature in the middle of the roast (using a Thermapen) at 45 minutes and then after 30 minutes, 20 minutes and (finally) 10 minutes when the internal temperature was 142. The roast was gorgeous and delicious. The only change I'll make the next time is that I think I'll add some fresh, sauteed mushrooms and apples in with the reconstituted dried mushrooms and dried apples, a little sauteed minced garlic and a little more thyme than called for in the stuffing.

Spectacular and delicious! Used regular curly kale for kale. Used mild Italian pork sausage for the ground pork. Using a 4# pork loin roast, it made enough for 12 servings.

This looked fabulous and tasted wonderful!! I used spinach instead of the kale and when I made the gravy I added fresh chopped mushrooms, shallots with garlic. I did add extra cider to the pan as suggested in the reviews. My only problem was when I bought the pork roast it was wrapped in a mesh...so when I removed the mesh to butterfly it the loin was actually in two pieces. So I ended up with two beautiful stuff roast!

Delicious and fabulous presentation! My friend and I cooked this together for a New Year's Eve party, along with the Roasted Domino Potatoes in the accompanying article. We made two large roasts, wrapped in thinly-sliced prosciutto. We did not brown the roasts before we put it in the oven, and the prosciutto still crisped up nicely in the oven. We also cooked it at 375 for about an hour. The apples fell apart, so we removed the skins and incorporated them into the gravy. I think you could use sparkling apple cider instead of the hard cider, as long as it was not too sweet. We also did not need even a full bunch of kale for both roasts.

Served this per recipe at our Christmas gathering. Prep is fairly time intensive but very much worth it. Flavors are great together in the pork. Served potato pancakes and sherry glazed carrots and our guests raved. This is now in my top 10 best special time recipes.

This was great. Made it for Christmas Day and wouldn't do anything different. Roasted it on pretty big apples to ensure they did not get mushy; worked. I served it with the wine braised cabbage from this site (the one that goes with a duck recipe) and mom's scalloped potatoes. Eggnog icecream with warm rum sauce for dessert. Yum.

Rating: 2
The flavor of the Thyme and Rosemary were just too strong for me, AND I used only half of what was called for. I think I was hoping for a sweeter flavor from the apples, but it just wasn't there. I didn't use hard cider, just regular, non-alcohol apple cider. The guest were polite, but my husband was honest....and I probably won't make this exact recipe again.

Rating: 4
I made a few changes. First, I brined the pork overnight in a maple brown sugar brine. I used apple-maple sausage for the stuffing and added dried tart cherries and cranberries. I read the reviews and roasted at 350 with a probe set to 145. I didn't bother with the apples. It was moist and juicy with incredible flavor. I will make again.

Rating: 4
OMG! Succulent, as elegant and beautiful as it is delicious. Company Ohhed and Ahhed. The only change I will make next time (and there WILL be a next time!),is to add a little butter to the stuffing, or maybe to use pork sausage as a previous reviewer did, as it was a tad dry. (No one else seemed to notice, but I did.) This may be because I decided to saute, then cool the ground pork before I added it to the stuffing. I rolled the roast from the short side (It was a lot wider this way than it was for some reviewers.). I was afraid this might make it necessary to cook it a lot longer, and harder to carve; it didn't. I roasted it for about an hour-and-a- half, and turned the heat up to about 415 degrees after about an hour to speed up the process. A real winner!

Rating: 4
The oven temp and time is WAY off on this recipe. I put it in at 375 for an hour and fifteen minutes and it was fine but a little dry. Any longer and it would have been dried out. I added forelle pears to the apples and tweaked a few things here and there but overall this is a great recipe. Just watch the pork in the oven.

I just made this last night for a pre-christmas dinner party and it was great. I followed the directions exactly with 3 minor changes - 1) I didn't put the apples under the pork, but rather around the edges to ensure they roasted properly 2) I didn't brown it prior to putting it in the oven, and 3) I added 1 cup of cider based on the previous posts mentioning that the liquid dried up. It did take 1.5 hours to roast properly, but the presentation was lovely and very tasty.

Made this pretty much per the recipe. I increased the liquids by 50% to be sure to have enough sauce. Based on reviews I lowered temp to 375 and was expecting it to be done in an hour, but since the rolled up loin was over 4 inches thick, it took an hour and a half to get to 140 degrees. It was still moist and delicious. Highly recommended.

I loved the flavour of the roast. My family really enjoyed it. I was glad to have looked at the website reviews before cooking as it did need to be watched and I cooked it at a lower temp for less time. Remember that the temperature continues to rise as it rests... expect it to go up as much as 10 degrees.

I wish that I had read the comments more closely before making this dish for Thanksgiving. The cooking time is ridiculous and results in over cooked pork and apple mush. I did knock 20 minutes off the cooking time because the time called for seemed so wrong. Unfortunately after prepping the stuffed loin it had to be baked elsewhere as the turkey needed my oven (we are weird and always make two mains for holidays)so I was unable to assess its done-ness. Even knocking off 20 minutes resulted in it being over cooked. The apples were mush but I strained them and extracted all of the juice I could and discarded the apples. This was a fundamental flaw with the recipe so why am I giving it 3 forks? I loved the flavors and the sauce was amazing. I will make again but will halve the stuffing called for and bake for about 1 hour.

I made this for 20 people for a Halloween Party, and everyone loved it! I had rave reviews, and a couple of propositions. I used rib loin roasts, about 14 ribs, had the butcher remove the bone from the loin, and then butterfly the loin. This is work I know how to do myself, but they have so much more practice. When I got it home, I pounded it, stuffed it, reattached the bone, and cooked it from there. Yes it can be time consuming, but it's well worth the effort. And yes, the time and temps are wrong. I just used my comon sense. After all, I more than tripled the recipe. My apples cooked to mush, so I mashed them and incorporated them into the sauce. Used hard cider, but think plain fesh cider would do as well. Friends we are having Christmas with this year, have requested this dish.

Rating: 4
I also made this as an alternative to turkey for Thanksgiving. We LOVED it! BUT I had exactly the same issues as the previous poster - the cider/water mix burnt to a crisp and the apples burned, which led to an unpleasant sauce. And it cooked in about 30 minutes less than noted here (I used a 3lb loin). I would add ALOT more cider and water next time, and reduce cooking time to 350 or 375 perhaps. But I would still make it again. Even if I now have to buy a new roasting pan because my current one is destroyed by the charred mess!

Rating: 4
We made the roast for Thanksgiving. My question is the oven temperature. My apples burned, the cidar and water boiled up the side of the pan and resulted in a charred mess. The prosciutto on top was very crisp. We felt the roast was overdone, at a temp of 140, a little dry and there were no juices left in the bottom of the pan. We really liked the flavor, everyone raved over the roast. So, even though it was a little overdone, it was a hit. We used a non-stick black roaster, maybe that was our problem. Any suggestions??

I have made this twice now and once got the pork bone-in and butterflied and once already prepared. Both are great. The combination of flavors are just fantastic.. both times I never used up all the Kale.. it was wasted. 1/2 lb is fine. next time I will make a full on flour based gravy. the presentation is fantastic. the cook time listed here is far too long. 45 minutes, I feel, is sufficient. the first time the apples went to mush.. second time.I had no hard cider so used brandy in place and did not cover. and apples were perfect. not traditional apple sauce in presentation, due to skin still on. the adventerous eaters ate it up. enjoy..I made this with turnip gratin

I made this tonight and followed the recipe. I wasn't a fan but others liked it so I'm saying I'd make it again but I won't. The apples were cooked into applesauce. They tasted okay but looked a mess.I had to drain them to try and get some fluid for the gravy. I overcooked the pork loin because it was done in about an hour and ten minutes. The gravy never thickened, didn't have a lot of flavor and I was done with messing with it. To be fair, I like a savory pork loin and this just didn't have that flavor profile.

Please consider advising the temperature & time may be too much--(400 is too high, 1 hr. 40 min too long) I hadn't read beyond the latest page of reviews so I missed others' warning! I just hope my roast isn't over-cooked! Its done at 5:30 and not serving until 8:00, but I just might have to move it up! Smells wonderful and know it will be good-- just want it to be the best it can be!

Made for a very special dinner party last night and everyone loved it. Definitely time-consuming to prepare but well worth the effort. I did not brown before roasting as others suggested and it really didn't need it as the prosciutto turns a beautiful rich color.The flavor of the ground pork mixture is so good, I am going to make it again on its own as a sausage dish. I do think I cooked it too long as the pork was a bit drier than I'd like but the pork filling was cooked to perfection. Really a special dish for a special occasion.

I made this roast for 7 for my sons birthday dinner. EVERYONE agreed this was one of the most delicious pork roasts we have ever had. I love it when i entertain and i can do all the prep work the day before. I couldn't find the dry hard cider so i substituted 1/2 regular cider and 1/2 apple brandy. Superb. Next time i would use more fresh apples as they were delicious and not everyone got an ample amount. Make this recipe if you want something delicious, beautiful to present and easy!

This makes a stunning presentation and tastes just as good as it looks. Yes, the cooking times and temps are wrong, but if you use a meat thermometer, you'll get excellent results. I couldn't find dried apples, so I used a combination of currants and dried cranberries, which worked out fine, even if I did forget to put the brandy in the stuffing. I also couldn't find hard cider, so I used the unfermented variety. To avoid overcooking the apples, I added them to the roasting pan about 20 minutes before the meat was done. Yes, there was a sticky black mess on the bottom of the roasting pan when I took it out of the oven. But when I deglazed it the sauce was tasty indeed. I didn't have enough prosciutto to wrap it entirely around the meat so I just draped it over the top before I tied the roast, which worked fine. I also skipped the browning step and waited until the roast had been in the oven for about 15 minutes and had started to develop a fond before I added the cider and no water. One last thing...it took two hours from when I started preparing this until it was ready to go in the oven, so getting it ready the day before is a good idea.

This was an exercise in creativity. I live in a small town--no TJs, no Whole Foods, no Costco. Subs: swiss chard for kale, dried my own apples four hours in the food dehydrator, used 1/2 dried porcinis and 1/2 fresh criminis (porcinis were really expensive), couldn't buy a small amount of hard cider so subbed apple juice/dry sherry mix. All that said, my guests loved it! The gravy/sauce was great. The apples held together and were just soft enough. I rolled it the long way which just allowed the two sides to meet. Made it a bit easier by putting down plastic wrap, laying out the cotton ties 1" apart, laid the proscuitto down and put the opened up pork roast on top, then the greens, then a cylinder of the mushroom, pork sausage, apple mix. Simple then to bring the sides up and tie the string. I did roast it at 375 to 155. I was concerned about the sausage not being thoroughly cooked at 140. The pork was still tender. A definite winner.

I prepared this for a dinner for 10 to celebrate a few birthdays. While the prep was a bit complicated, the meal got rave reviews. I loved being able to do all the prep ahead of time. Then I could concentrate on sides and dessert the day of the party. As I took it out of the oven, the guests made me pose with it for a photo. I used a 5lb roast so I multiplied recipe by 1 1/2. I pretty much stayed with the recipe and will do this again for special events.

Although I am an accomplished cook, this was probably one of the most elaborate recipes to prepare - I am glad I could do the prep in advance of the dinner party. I found the amount of kale to be a bit excessive - next time will use less - but the rest of the filling was divine! No problems with browning the roast in the pan before placing into the oven. The apples stayed whole, but cooked through (I used Galas) and the sauce made from the drippings was perfect. The roast was not only beautiful in presentation, but was a hit with everyone. I'll make this again.

This was a fairly involved recipe. We prepared it for a Birthday dinner and found it quite good! We stayed very close to the original recipe (that's hard for me to do!). I do wonder, however, if there might be a few ways to simplify it a bit. The kale stayed a vibrant shade of green and the prosciutto maintained a nice, red-pink color. It looked VERY nice when served!

Delicious, used a mix of dried mushrooms as that was what was on hand, precooked some italian sausage instead of the raw ground pork, minced the kale as my better half is not a real fan and used conventional cider as I could not be bothered to try to find hard. I am sure hard cider might have kicked it up another notch but it was both pretty and delicious. Cooking time, I did not brown it first, cooked at 375 in convection roast with a meat probe, it took about 1 1/4 hours to get to 145. Yes the apples were kind of mush but I love apple sauce and there was plenty of pan sauce as well.

Wish I had read the other reviews before I made this. Apples, turned to mush, so there was no pan sauce to be made. The temperature was way too high so getting the pork filling done without overcooking the outside loin didn't work for me. When I browned the roast covered with prosciutto the prosciutto stuck to the pan and came off. I also made the Brussels Sprouts with Walnut Vinaigrette and it was way too bitter witht the brussels sprouts and radicchio. It was a lot of work to separate the leaves.

I always read the reviews before I attempt a new recipe and once again you guys didn't let me down. This was exceptional with the alterations mentioned by previous reviewers.

I really enjoyed this dish. The stuffing is so good. I used italian sausage instead of just ground pork. I followed the instructions as shown. I did check the doneness early based on the other reviews, but ours did take longer probably because of the thickness of the butterflied pork loin. I am never able to pound meat thin. Just don't get the concept. So it was thicker (which did make the roll a little difficult too) and therefore took longer to cook. Unfortunately that also meant that the ends were very done and the very middle was a bit pink, but 70% of it was perfect. I also enjoyed the apples the way they turned out. Yes, some were more "saucy" than firm, but most held their shape and were just quite soft. I thought it was appropriate for the dish. I also did not brown the meat in advance and it was perfectly fine. I served with the Roasted Sweet Potatoes, Potatoes and Sage recipe and it was delicious.

Made this for a Progressive Tuscan Dinner Party this past weekend and it was perfect. I used a 4 lb. roast, and an internal thermometer. I used Crispin hard cider and Fuji apples, which made a pan sauce that was out of this world with the reserved mushroom liquid. It was cooking too fast at 400', so I turned it down to 350 for the last 30 minutes or so. It rested for 2 hours before dinner, and I rewarmed it under foil at 200 for about 10 minutes before serving. For Demps - yes, the pork is uncooked. It will cook just fine in the roast.

As many others have said, the cooking time is much less. Mine only took 40 minutes at 375 and I made two roasts. Also found it took about half the kale indicated in the recipe. It is a spectacular presentation. Was very glad that I did the roasts a day a head of time as it was very time consuming. Served with roasted brussel sprouts and carrots to rave reviews. A great Thanksgiving dinner.

This is perhaps the best recipe I've ever made from Bon Appetit. It is a bit time and work intensive, but if you start it the day before, it's not all that bad ... and definitely worth it. We had company for dinner and they all said it was simply amazing. I wouldn't change a thing.

FANTASTIC! Spent a rainy Sunday afternoon preparing this. Well worth the time and effort. Attractive presentation and delicious. Used swiss chard from my garden rather than kale; and used sweet Italian sausage. As recommended by others, reduced the temp to 375. GS apples turned to mush, but melded into the sauce nicely. Caution your butcher to butterfly the roast as directed by recipe; mine thought cutting it in half would be sufficient. Not.

Oh man. SO GOOD. So totally worth all of the hours of prep and cooking. I don't have much experience with more involved recipes, nor roasts. Heck, this is the first time I've ever cooked pork beyond bacon. So after a few calls to Mom during the process of cooking, I took her advice and lowered the temperature to 350, and checked it after an hour. I also cooked it with the lid on for the first 30 minutes, and then removed it for the rest of the cooking time. In all, I ended up cooking it for 1 hour and 15 minutes at 350 (it was a somewhat small roast, I should add), and it turned out PERFECTLY. In fact, I'm about to go for a second serving. So flavorful on its own, but that sauce (at the end of the recipe) makes it ridiculously awesome. Thanks, Bon Appetit and Epicurious! My husband, neighbors, and I are happy campers!

I read the other reviews and figured it was a winner. It wasn't. It was just ok. The stuffing was great, the gravy was not. The meat was not as juicy as a brined pork roast usually is. I was underwhelmed, especially given the amount of work that went into it.

I prepared this last night and it's a homerun. I agree with others that cooking time is at least 30-40 minutes too long. Fortunately I checked it after an hour or so. I chopped the kale first before blanching briefly and this helps. The crunch of the kale is a fine foil to the meat. I used a bottled hard carbonated cider from the fridge which worked great. Great presenation for a group.

Made this yesterday. The recipe doesn't specify which side to roll from; I rolled up from the short side. My 2.5# roast was done after one hour of cooking. Absolutely delicious and the spiral-looking slices look pretty. Will definitely make again and may try using Italian sausage instead of ground pork next time.

My husband and I just tried this! It really didn't work out. The temp is just too high and cook time too long. The juices and apples burned completely up. The apples were mush within the first 30 minutes...I'm not sure why. We haven't tasted it. The pork loin actually looks good, although the internal temp is too high. We're going to have to wing a sauce since we won't be able to use the pan juices. I love the idea of this recipe, so if anyone tries modifications and has success with them, please post! Thanks.

Served this for Sunday dinner. Be very careful with cooking times as mine was done in just under an hour and forty minutes. Used Granny Smith apples, but next time I'll think I'll try something just a bit sweeter. All in all, a very nice dish and would be excellent for guests.

Fabulous dish for entertaining. I let it rest over an hour after I took it out and was able to enjoy my company and appetizers. When I served it the dish was warm. However, the cooking time needs to be monitored carefully. My roast cooked 1 hour 20 and could have been taken out 10 minutes earlier for perfection. I rolled the flattened loin so that it was longer and narrower, and I think that is the difference.

Delicious! Substituted mild Italian sausage for half the ground pork. Yum. Used a roast just under 2 pounds and cooked it for 1 hour. It was done perfectly. Be sure to periodically check the juices in the bottom of the pan. Had to add some water part way through the cooking. Great presentation and flavor and not difficult to make.

I had a small pork loin (about 1-1/2 lbs.) so didn't cook it the entire time and it came out perfectly. Such an elegant and delicious dish with the added bonus of being able to make a portion of it ahead. I wrote a blog post about it with a step-by-step tutorial if this helps anyone.

I served this at a dinner party and everyone loved it. It is a gorgeous presentation. The stuffing is very flavorful and the sauce rich and easy to prepare. I cooked it at 400 for an hour and a half and it was at 140 degrees exactly. Unfortunately, the stuffing was perfectly done but I found the loin to be on the dry side. I'm not sure how it can be made with the stuffing being cooked through and the loin not a bit overdone. I will make it again. Not sure yet what I will do differently.

Very good potentially, but 1 hr 40 mins at 400 degrees was too high! The top got burned, the liquid in the pan burned off so that I couldn't make the sauce and the loin was too dry. I will try this again (the stuffing part came out amazing) but I will cook at 375 and check periodically, tenting with foil if it browns too much and adding more liquid if it dries out.

Help! I want to make this for a dinner party tonight but I am not sure if the ground pork should be cooked before I add it to the stuffing. I can't tell from the recipe. Any advice?
