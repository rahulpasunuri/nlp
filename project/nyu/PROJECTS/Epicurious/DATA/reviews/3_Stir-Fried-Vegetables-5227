What a joke. I was looking for something new to cook. Anyone can make this.

This was a colorful topping to the pan seared tuna and wasabi green onion potatoes.

Unfortunately the cook from Calgary must not have discovered the wonderful mahimahi dish the sauted vegetables accompany and thus missed the lovely sauce that is added to the vegetables. I have made this recipe several times and am never disappointed.

You've got to be kidding me - like a recipe is even needed for this! What a bland, boring dish...please, I thought this was a web site for interesting recipes! Veggies fried in oil and seasoned with salt and pepper barely even counts as a recipe.
