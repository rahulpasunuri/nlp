The only good reviews for this recipe are from people who added more stuff to it, which seems like a great idea.

I was not impressed with this recipe. I also thought that the time to cook the veggies were not correct at all. If you want to make this, ignore the directions and timing and just do whatever is best to make the veggies easy to chew. I threw away the leftovers because neither my boyfriend or I liked it.

I cook the rice in my electric steamer (rice cooker) while I prepare the remaining ingredients. Very simple, very quick, and it tastes so rich without any unhealthy ingredients. Wonderful.

I thought this was good- not great, good. After a few forkfulls, I dusted a little Chinese five-spice over the top of each serving and found it enhanced the flavor quite nicely. A big improvement. Still, did not find the effort of preparation worth the yield.

I roasted all of the root veggies with EVOO, thyme and garlic cloves, than made the puree with the original amount of parsnips. Seasoned the rice with a pinch of saffron. I followed the recipe for the rest and it was delish.

This recipe might be right for you if: 1. you like unseasoned veggies 2. you are part of a CSA and got a crate of root vegetables in February 3. you don't mind making a simple dish that required three pans and a blender This recipe might not be for you if: 1. you don't have two hours to put into a rice dish 2. you are thinking of making this dish for company 3. you hate bland I read the other reviews, and thought if I implemented their suggestions I'd be okay - but I still was far from pleased with the result. Adding some thyme both to the puree and the finished rice helped. As did a generous helping of cheddar on top. I thought some diced, roasted beets would pull everything together, but even with these old-fashioned tricks the dish wasn't good. Three pots and a blender for this? The dish is too much of a time warp; we're passt "Perfection Salad" and other weird, white, bland foods.

Meh too. Neither my wife nor I were impressed with this dish. The basmati just wasn't substantial enough to stand up to the other textures and it's not like the flavours made up for it. Our ingredients were reasonably fresh, so I can't blame that. The idea of herbs and bacon does sound like a good one, and if I was making this the first time I would try that. Having tasted it as written, I'm not sure I can be asked to try this again.

not sure if this is worth the chopping and the different steps. if you are looking for a way to showcase the sweetness of these root veggies, it's good...if you just want a delicious rice side, i would pick something else.

Meh. After a day of fatty eating, The Boyfriend requested a dinner of "all vegetables", and those in this recipe happened to be in the crisper. Serving this as a main dish was my mistake, but when I reflected on the time and energy that went into it, it doesn't seem worth it for a side. All in all, the flavor was nice, but it lacked anything really special to recommend it. The consistency was also correct for a side, although not nearly as risotto-y as I was hoping; rather, it was more like vegetable porridge. I like the herbs and bacon idea listed below, though, so I'm saying that yes, I would make it again, but only to try that mod.

Really great. I added more veggies as well, beets made it a great color. I also added fresh herbs and bacon at the end for extra flavor.

Really delicious. I added some extra veggies as well (beets, great color) as well as fresh herbs and bacon at the very end.

I loved it! It is so healthy yet tastes so creamy. I would suggest adding more than 1 cup of carrots to increase color. I also chopped up chives to bring a bit of green to the dish. It was a little time consuming, but I am still eating the left-overs and enjoying the wholesome, winter root vegetable combination. Also, I would suggest not adding all of the puree at once, but instead mixing it in and finding the right consistency to your taste.
