KK boyz and grrls. Let's not get all literal whilst cooking, LOL! Face the reality that this recipe was conceived before many of us were. Sooo take the serving sizes, can of beef gravy and amt of butter and remember whyyy your antecedents died so young. A recipe no matter what century it's written in, is about techniques. Don't follow this slavishly; use what you've learned! Subbed demi glace for a can of gravy; lowered amt of butter, utilising beurre manie for finishing and used more fresh parsley than prolly thought wise back then..still used the beef marrow, although opted for homemade marrow jam because there are times in my life that retro is good ;). Slamming good eats for my book.

Broiled chateaubriand but made sauce per recipe. Meh. Good, but not worth the calories or particularly interesting. A waste of really good ingrediants.

a great, easy, and artery coating sauce. a wonderful way to dress an inexpensive cut of meat. used the sauce on deer steak, too.

I second Nancini from NJ's question: what canned gravy are you using so I can use it too? Thanks.

This was a wonderful recipe and the sauce is so delicious! One pound of meat is quite a lot per person. Six to eight ounces per person is adequate. I grilled the meat instead of broiling it. First, I seared it on all sides and than lowered the temperature, closed the grill cover and let it cook slow until done. Watch it carefully as you do not want to over cook the meat. I also did not use the beef marrow. For the sauce, I followed the recipe as directed. Reducing the wine sauce really brings out a beautifully rich flavor. I used a quick brown gravy mix and blended it until it was thick and creamy before adding it to the recipe. I served this recipe with a grilled baked potato, and a lettuce, tomato and crumbled blue cheese salad. We also had a lovely bottle of Rosso Di Altesino, a delicious Tuscan wine.

Actually This is a cry for HELP. Using a can of Brown Gravy doesn't sound to good. Can I just use a Gravy Recipe if so any recommendations? Has anyone found a good can of Gravy? If so what brand? Thanks for the input

This is the 1st recipe I have ever rated 4 forks. To the freaked out reviewer about the 50's person-this is AUTHENTIC French cooking at it's best. Get over yourself. There is no substitute for the real thing. I did use veal and beef stock as a previous reviewer and a little less lemon- one lb of meat served me and my oh, so appreciative husband, along with the Lyonnaise taters and carmelized pearl onions with asparagus. It doesnt get any better than the Old Masters. Read and learn......sometimes you have to throw aside the fat/calorie/carb thing for what is important in life.....

I suggest you take the cook from Boston's comments 'with a grain of salt' - no one's hands are 'tied' to following recipes verbatim. Common sense and appetite should decide the serving size, and use other than a 'can of brown gravy' if it is a horrible thought to you. I made this as part of a 6 course meal for 8, and used my homemade veal demi-glace for the sauce base. Portion size was 4 ounces before cooking. The general consensus was 4 forks - a classic meat entree.

My family loved this recipe. My 9 and 14 year olds kids had three helpings. I used less wine that required and it was great. All my son can talk about is the great steak. I can't want to make it again.

I have made this recipe twice already and can highly recommend it. The portions are large, but I would rather have to much food than not enough. I will definitely make this again.

I wouldn't trust a recipe from the '50's that suggests a pound of beef per person, and a 'can of brown gravy' for the sauce.

I made this with a fairly cheap Bordeaux. The sauce came out wonderfully-- my fiance was licking the plate---this is a classic sauce for beef. Yum!

This is a lovely presentation. I would like to share another sauce after the chateaubriand is placed on a hot platter, ready to serve: Cream 4 tablespoons salted butter ADD: 1/4 teaspoon salt a few dashes of cayenne pepper 2-3 teaspoons finely chopped parsley... then ADD: 2 tablespoons strained fresh lemon juice. Spread it on your meat and serve.

Haven't made this recipe yet, but am anxious to after reading the reviews. MY QUSTION: One POUND of meat per person? Am I missing something?

This is outstanding! My family loved it - my 5 year old daughter couldn't get enough of the sauce. We didn't have Cognac in the house so I used a dash of Brandy instead. I will be making it for a Valentines Dinner with 5 other couples in a few weeks...can't wait to have it again!

I made this recipe last evening. It was excellent and everyone loved it! I served it with small white potatoes laced with melted butter and chopped chives. I was told it was the best meal I have made. Will definately make it again.

Elegant indeed. My husband couldn't get enough of the sauce/meat. One idea--I would cut down a little on the lemon juice, and up the amount of cognac/brandy to 1/4 cup, but a delicious and easy dish.
