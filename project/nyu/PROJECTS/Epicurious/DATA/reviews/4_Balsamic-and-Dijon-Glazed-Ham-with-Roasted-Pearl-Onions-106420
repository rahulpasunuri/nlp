Excellent. I would just suggest to adjust cooking time to the size of the ham, mine was done earlier and it ended up a bit dry.

This is our go to Christmas dish... easy for an exhausted wohm to prepare after all hectic last minute holiday preparation. Kids call it Big Red and Mom calls it impossible to ruin.

This is a great recipe that I've been making for years. Tonight, however, I was inspired to make a few significant changes: I cut all the hard skin and fat off the ham, then I attached thick-sliced bacon all over it to replace the fat and add flavor, and finally, I poured 2 cups of orange juice all over the bacon & ham, letting it flow into the bottom of the roasting pan. I covered the whole thing with aluminum foil, basting it as needed with the OJ. This kept the ham moist while being nearly fat-free. Everything else was exactly the same as the great base recipe. 45 minutes before it was finished, I removed the foil and 20 minutes later (when the bacon had crisped up) started basting with the delicious mustard/brown sugar/vinegar sauce. It melted into the bacon and ham, adding a marvelous flavor and taste. I served it with the roasted pearl onions and bacon slices on top and it was absolutely delicious. Peas and scalloped potatoes made it a meal to remember.

This was an excellent recipe! I followed the recipe exactly as listed and the product was delicious. The only suggestions I have would be to cook double the pearl onions, as they were so delicious there was clamoring for more. And also, I would suggest doubling the glaze as a dip/spread for ham slices. This recipe was easy to execute and the product was thoroughly impressive. I will be making this again.

This was FANTASTIC! My ham was on the small side (7 lbs.), so I heated for 10 min./lb. and glazed as the recipe directed for the last half-hour. The onions (thawed frozen) didn't get nearly the time this recipe called for, so when the ham came out of the oven I poured off half the liquid and turned the heat up to 500° for 5-10 min. Caramelized perfectly, and so delicious. The leftovers make an amazing grilled ham & swiss!

Here's a variation: No pearl onions, but I had two large, mature (read: tough) leeks. I cleaned & cut them into 2" lengths, braised them for an hour in 1-1/2 c. water with a touch of butter and salt, and dumped them, with the 2 T of water left, into the pan at the point in the recipe where you put the onions in the oven. Added 1/3 c. water, left out the butter and the salt. The result was fanTAStic.

Delicious! And very easy! I don't much care for pearl onions, so I used whole carrots for the side dish, prepared the same way except I put about 5 or 6 whole garlic cloves in with the carrots as they cooked, and discarded before serving (tasted great).

This is amazing. I followed the recipe exactly. Even the ham-haters in the crowd loved it. I used a bone-in shank and left the fat on (I love fat - there, I said it). I made another batch of the glaze the next day for dipping leftovers.

Super recipe. Don't recommend adding the salt to the glaze. The onions were excellent. Soft and creamy inside. Sightly carmelized outside.

I've made this several times always to rave reviews. The pearl onions are especially delightful ~ even my kids ask for them so I've learned to make double. =) If you want to impress at Easter dinner (or anytime for that matter), this is one of the best and easiest ways to do it.

Perfect! I doubled the glaze as well and used frozen onions. The glaze was so good over the Light and Silky Mashed Potatoes on Epicurious. Also served with green beans for Easter Dinner.

Rating: 4
I used frozen onions--next time I will thaw them before putting them with the ham. Glaze got too thin. Also, the outer skins on some were a little tough. Fresh probably better. Not so hard to peel, but I would do the day ahead. DH kept saying it was the best ham we'd ever gotten--and he can live without ham. Had several servings.

Rating: 4
Used red onion chunks instead of pearl. Cooked everything together and omitted water and butter. Used half the sugar. Added a little thyme. Super easy and turned out great! My guest who later confessed that she usually hates ham, had two servings! Will definitely do it again with pearl onions when I can get them.

Rating: 4
Yum! Yum! Yum! Made it for Easter Dinner and all of my 12 guests raved about it! Definately make the onions a day ahead and double the glaze (I still only used 3 tblsp of dijon mustard so it wouldn't be too mustardy.) I added onions to ham after roasting ham for 45 min. Next time I would add onions to ham right from the beginning - they needed the extra time. Ham was not pre-sliced. Served with scalloped potatoes with thre cheeses recipe from this site. Fabulous!

Was lazy and used frozen pearl onions but it was still delicious.

I rated this recipe 4 forks, because it was so delicious. I did make a two changes, but nothing major. I cooked the onions with the ham and I didn't use the full amount of brown sugar. It was a hit with everyone at the table. My in-laws were particularly thrilled with the onions. They were a lovely addition to our Christmas dinner. I served the onions in a separate serving dish with some of the glaze. Terrific recipe.

Rating: 4
This was brilliant! I'm still learning how to cook and don't always have the best results. I knew it was a hit when my husband starting nodding his head at the first bite. I even goofed up the recipe by combining all the ingredients at the beginning rather than just the first three for the glaze. I had used the last of the brown sugar and dijon so I couldn't redo it. It still tasted delicious! I too added the onions to the base of the ham and they came out perfect.

to the Cook from LA - this is the same dilemma I was faced with after 1/2 hour - the onions were pretty unappetizing and pale looking, with lots of watery liquid. After putting them around the base of the ham and basting the ham with the glaze, everything turned a lovely carmelized colour and the liquid reduced to a great sauce consistency. Hope this helps - definitely worth trying again.

to the Cook from Los Angeles - I had the same dilemma with the onions looking fairly pale and unappetizing after braising for 1/2 hour, which is why I placed them around the ham and they did indeed carmelize and were delicious.

Rating: 4
This was fabulous. The only variation I made was that after braising the onions for 1/2 hour or so I placed them, along with the liquid around the base of the ham and added the reserved glaze - marinating the ham every 15 minutes or so while it baked, for close to an hour (at 325). Once the sliced ham was on the serving platter I drizzled some of the glaze from the pan over it and placed the onions over top. It looked great and both the ham and onions were delicious. the glaze made a wonderful sauce. Very good - definitely a keeper.

The ham was delicious; I am wondering if I did something wrong with the onions. They were sweet, but there was so much liquid in the dish that they did not appear glazed or dark brown (even after roasting uncovered for the 80 minutes as directed). I left them in the oven for about 20 minutes extra after the ham was done, but nothing seemed to change. Were they supposed to carmelize? Was the liquid supposed to evaporate? Any thoughts?

Rating: 3
I made this dish for Easter and everyone enjoyed it. The onions were fabulous! Only difficulty I had was getting the onion mixture to have more of a syrup texture vs liquidy. The ham was also good but I didn't taste a lot of the glaze from the basting. I will definitely be making the onions again for other meals.

Excellent! I made this ham for easter and it was a real hit. The balsamic vinegar really cuts through the sweetness and gives this ham the savory bite I was hoping for. And the onions were melting in my mouth. Definitely a keeper!

This was an incredible dish. The glaze was great and the onions were the rage. I absolutely recommend using fresh onions. It is more work but truly worth it just peel the onions the day before. I snipped at the root and squeezed the onion out. I would go with at least another 1/2 pound of onions. I cooked the onions separately but would consider using only one pan, it probably would work. The glaze is great but the fresh onions make the dish.

I made this for Christmas dinner and my entire family could not stop raving about it. I cooked the ham in an electric roaster to free up my oven for other items and reduced the temperature in the beginning to prevent it from drying out. It was absolutely amazing. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Huge hit!! Modications...We added the onions (fresh) and brussel sprouts (fresh and halved) halfway through the cooking time. Next time I will double the amount of onions and brussle sprouts to 4 lbs of onions and 2 lbs of brussel sprouts. Served this with gruyere + cream fraiche scalloped potatoes from this site.

We make this again and again, especially if we have unadventurous guests for dinner; nobody can turn down ham and the onions are mouth-watering. Make with scalloped fennel and potatoes for something decadent.

An outstanding glaze. The complex flavors really compliment the ham.

Poured all the glaze over a spiral cut ham. Added 2 1# packages of frozen pearl onions to the pan after the 1st 45 minutes of ham cooking time. No additional water. Salt & peppered & dotted with butter. Continued basting often. Onions were caramelized & added so much to the dish. I didn't see any reason to cook them separately & thought adding them to the ham made more sense. One less dish to wash & several steps less to do. Excellent!

I made the onions only with a pre-cooked spiral ham and some other vegetables for Easter - everyone raved about it, all the women in attendance wanted the recipe!!

Rating: 4
WOW! This glaze was amazing. We couldn't get enough of it. I make my ham differently (in an oven bag) so I didn't glaze it but just served it on the side. Didn't bother with the onions (although they sound good and I'd like to try them some time). I just combined the ingredients and brought them to a boil and let simmer for a few minutes. It's a great combination of sweet and sour - goes great with ham!

My brother in law made this for Christmas Eve, and I loved it so much I made it for Easter - it came out just as wonderful! The only change I made was that I used a spiral cut ham. After peeling about 10 onions I found an easy way to do it - cut off the top end, then just squeeze at the root end - the onion pops right out of the skin.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe, except I used 2 small bags of frozen pearl onions. The best ham ever! The glaze for the onions was a bit watery so after some experimenting I don't add any, the frozen onions have enough water in them. I don't defrost the onions, just throw them in the pan with the glaze, and they cook up just fine. I use 1 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/2 c. balsamic vinegar and 1/4 c. Dijon mustard to make slightly more glaze and reserve the extra, mixed with a litte of the cooked onion glaze, to serve at the table. I'm making it again tomorrow!

This really was the best ham I have ever had. My husband quickly stopped whining that it wasn't a spiral ham. Much more moist and flavorful than a spiral. I almost didn't make the onions and that would have been a big mistake.

First of all, let me say that his ham definitely exceeded my expectations. The flavor was amazing- even my husband who is rarely "wowed" by my cooking really loved it. I cooked it in the crockpot on high for an hour and then on low for four hours, which was a bit too long. It would have been juicier if I had cut back on the cooking time. I started by rubbing mustard all over the top and patting on some brown sugar, and then I added some of the glaze. I put it in the crockpot and didn't open the cover until the last hour of the baking time, at which point I spooned more glaze on a few times. I made the onions in the oven, following the recipe exactly. I had peeled and cooked the onions the night before, so they were a cinch to prepare the day of the party. I have never eaten plain onions (except onion rings!), but let me tell you these are OUTSTANDING. Our guests gobbled them all up! I also served the balsamic potatoes (on this site) and a garlic green bean and tomato saute. Yum!

The dish was delicious but I had problems with the cooking time. It was done an hour before the total time elapsed & actually was a little dry when I took it out. Did anyone else have this problem? Maybe it because my ham was presliced sprial cut?

Best ham I've ever made, or had for that matter.Though the pearl onions are a nice accompaniment, I cannot say they are worth the effort or expense. The ham, on the other hand, is beyond compare. The only advice I would offer is to keep the 2/3 cups of glaze that is used for the onions and use it as more baste for the ham. I found the amount remaining to be insufficient --and had to make more--for a large, scored ham, as I like to assure that the basting sauce goes well into the scored surface of the ham. The glaze will impart a deep, dark rich and flavourful finish and the slow roasting assures moist and tender meat. There is no reason to look for another recipe for glazed ham, as this has become the definitive recipe in my collection. The recipe for Potatoes with Leeks and Gruyere, also found on this site, makes a delicious accompaniment to this ham, and is a nice departure from the traditional scalloped potatoes. This recipe is a must for anyone looking for success with a holiday ham.

Great glaze on this ham! Since there are only two in my family we only made the glaze portion & poured it over our smaller ham to cook. Served the extra sauce for those who wanted it. It was delicious! Even my husband-not a huge meat lover-loved it! Definitely make it again!

FABULOUS!! I will definitely make this recipe again. It was incredibly delicious and very easy to prepare. The only problem, if you can call it a problem, was that the 2 lbs of pearl onions would have cost $16.00!! I opted to use just 1 lb, which was plenty enough for the 6 people for dinner.

This is a great dish if you want something that's not too much work, but looks like you slaved in the kichen for hours. It's always a crowd pleaser. I used a spiral cut ham, so no need to cut any X's in it. I also substituted onions in jars that I rinsed well. They still tasted great and it really cut down on the prep time.

I'm a newlywed. I made this and my husband said "DAMN, BABY! This is the best you've made yet." I prefer to chalk this up to a wonderful recipe, not the quality of the other dishes to which he's comparing. Don't skip the onions - they're a pain to peel but they're delicious! Used the leftovers (including leftover liquid from the onions) in ham and bean soup the next day!

The glaze is excellent. Accidentally added butter directly to the glaze, and will always add the butter to the glaze. Very tasty, makes a succulent and flavorful ham. Additional notes: glaze is excellent on pork tenderloin or other cuts of pork as well, have made this several times now. Husband has never shown so much enthusiasm for a ham. Use leftovers in a bean soup (or the cheese and potato soup on this site!), the flavor of the glaze really enriches soups.

Unfortunately, the onions didn't work for me at all. At the end, they were just a charred mess. But I'm still giving this one a top rating because the important part -- the glazed ham -- was absolutely superb!! Usually include ham on our Thanksgiving menu for those who aren't wild about turkey. This will definitely be the recipe used!

It is very difficult to do something 'different' with a fully-cooked ham. Generally a sweet glaze is spread across the top, occasionally we do the pineapple ring and cherry thing, but most of the time, ham is ham...until now. I tried this recipe on impulse for Easter dinner for my husband and myself. Both of us say it's the best ham I've ever made! I didn't make the onions, but I added the salt and fresh-ground pepper to the glaze mixture. After baking the ham I poured the leftover glaze and drippings at the bottom of the pan into a saucepan, added a cup of water and a tsp of cornstarch and made the most wonderful gravy!I served it with mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. We believe it's a perfect dinner for company! I next plan on using this glaze on a grilled pork tenderloin. Can't wait...

I made this dish for Easter last year for my husband's family. Even though they are very much the traditionalists and usually only want the very same dishes prepared exactly like great grandma did they all LOVED this recipe. I did too. I am going to make it again this year and I can't wait.

We didn't even get to make the onions and thought this was a four-star. If you skip the onions, by the way, a half-batch of the glaze will suffice. I have made the glaze with half brandy and half whiskey (because I had the mixture on hand) and that is wonderful, also. This recipe warrants a nice quality balsamic vinegar,too.
