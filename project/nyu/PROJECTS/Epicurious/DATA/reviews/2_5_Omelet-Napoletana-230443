DELICIOUS. Very easy to make and a really quick easy dinner that can be made with staples that most people keep around the house. I loved it.

This is actually very GROSS!

This became scrambled eggs. The cheese melted and stuck to the pan, so when I lifted the edges as instructed, the omelet fell apart. Also, I am not sure it would have looked like the picture, even if it did hold together.

Absolutely delicious and extremely easy to make. The contrast of the omelet with the spaghetti on top is amazing.
