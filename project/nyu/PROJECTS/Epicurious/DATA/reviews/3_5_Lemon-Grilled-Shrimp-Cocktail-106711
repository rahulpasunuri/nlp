This was easy, tasty and fairly quick to do.

made this dish the other night as a last-minute addition for a dinner party, and it stole the show! I added a splash of white wine to the marinade, grilled on a grill pain, didn't bother with the dipping sauce -- and it still turned out great! A simple, delicious dish.

Where can I get the recipe for the mayonaise dip? For some reason the hyperlink is invalid.

I've made this several times and it's always good and highly appreciated. It looks festive and is really easy. You can make it in a grill pan too. Use light mayo a/o non-fat yogurt to cut down on the fat calories with no loss of texture. Grilled potatoes/onions and a salad complete the meal.
