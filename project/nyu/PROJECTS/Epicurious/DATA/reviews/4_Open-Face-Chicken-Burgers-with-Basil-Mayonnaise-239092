I used whole chicken breasts instead of ground chicken. I also used a really good quality white bun instead of bread. It was fabulous! Loved the basil mayo.

Like other reviewers I used half light mayo and half greek yogurt and ground turkey instead of ground chicken. No other changes (no bread crumbs or eggs). It stayed together just fine while cooking. Really yummy.

Used pickled Asparagus because did not have pickles in the house, and 2lbs of ground chicken with the half cup of mayo mixture. Felt it was too wet so added a heaped tablespoon of italian breadcrumbs. Chilled patties on a plastic chopping board covered in plastic wrap for 30 mins. and then flopped them into a skillet. Cooked in about 8 mins. They were a big hit. However we also love the Greek Burgers but made with Ground Chicken rather than Turkey.

I will definitely make this again while basil is plentiful. However, I will make it with the following changes: 1/3 cup light mayo + 1/3 cup plain greek yogurt instead of the 1 cup mayo (seriously?) I also used ground turkey breast (easier to find), added 1 egg & 1/4 cup plain bread crumbs. My recipe made 5 good size burgers, plus 1 baby one, resulting in about 213 calories per burger (bread is extra). The basil sauce really made this very tasty. A few simple substitutions made this a reasonable meal, even if you're not counting calories.

Excellent! Very tasty! Seems that mayo could be made with just about any pickled picy veggie.

Becoming a summertime tradition in my family using fresh basil from the garden. After seeing how incredibly high in fat ground chicken is, I switched to turkey breast. That also makes the patties easier to work with.

Very good. We had it without the bun so it would be low carb. My husband always wants a dip or sauce of some kind and the mayo is great.

Delicious with some of the suggested changes. I only used half the mayo, substituted capers for pickles, and cooked in a frying pan 2.5 minutes per side. Will definitely make again!

I have made this recipe many times - we really like the taste. I had a problem keeping the patties together until I discovered that placing them in a single layer on a tray covered with plastic wrap and refrigerating for a while does it. Just lift up one end of the wrap and flip the patty on to a spatula, and flop onto the pan. This flip-flop also works great for vegetable pancakes.

I don't see how this recipe could contain 730 calories!!! Is this correct????

This recipe is a family favorite! I've made it 3-4 times and have shared the recipe a few times too. Nice change from the traditional burger. I make the recipe exactly as instructed w/one exception. I mix a little less of the basil mayo w/the chicken than the recipe suggests to make sure it all stays together better.

Excellent recipe which I will alter in the future with different herbs. I used a grill basket to keep the patties together. It worked perfectly!

I improvised a bit, using somewhat less mayonnaise, dried basil and sweet green relish instead of the pickle. I also baked the burgers at 350 for about 40 minutes - probably a bit too long, but the results were tender and not too dry. Since I was just making for myself, I had leftovers the next day which were particularly tasty, both reheated and cold.

Delicious. I used about half mayo, half low-fat yogurt. Substituted capers and their juice for the cornichons. Also added a little panko to the meat to help hold it together.

Excellent. Seriously awesome burgers. Moist and delicious!

Delicious! I used light mayo and still put in about 1/2 - 2/3 what it calls for and they came out great. They are very hard to keep together, though, so I can't imagine putting them on a grill. I cooked them on a grill pan and they came out beautiful!

Mmm, great burger! I used turkey and rustic buns instead and added sauteed mushrooms. Next time I'll try substituting mayo with plain yogurt as some reviewers suggested...I hope I won't be able to taste the difference!

We loved these burgers! I used an ice cream scoop to portion the burgers - minimal handling, as well as leaving them on the grill a bit longer for the 1st side (as another reader suggested). They cooked up beautifully & were delicious!

Tasty and differnt but not awesome. Served with a tangy bruschetta which really helped round out the meal. Husband liked it. May make it again but it's on my "perhaps once a year" menu.

I've made these a couple of times, and each time they are better than the last. Everytime I make them for a party everyone insists on the recipe. Added a little bit of garlic and djion mustard to the basil mayo. yummy!!

Since I don't have a barbecue, I broiled the burgers for about 5 minutes on each side. I think this helped cut back a bit on the fat, too! I also added breadcrumbs to the otherwise gloopy mix and after forming the patties I dredged them lightly in more breadcrumbs. This helped them stay together better and added a nice crunchy crust.

Loved them. Followed recipe except replaced roll with finely shredded lettuce. The Mayo sauce is delicious.

I was going to make this recipe -- just back from the store -- until I read the nutritional information. Holy cow. That's an enormous amount of saturated fat and calories. I'm going to look for something healthier for the package of ground chicken I just bought.

Love this recipe. We kept it on the grill for a bit longer until the bottom side was browned. It made flipping the burger much easier and, as a result, we ad no problem with the burgers falling apart. The grandchildren adored them!!!

These burgers were delicious, husband loved them! After forming the patties I put them in the refrigerator to firm up and then pan fried them. Instead of the bread I served them on a bed of salad greens. This one is a keeper!

It's a great tasting flavorful buger! Instead of mayonnaise I used Plain Yogurt, you can't tell the difference. I also added some crushed sun chips (French Onion) to stick a little better. Worker great! Enjoy-

Yum! A quick and easy recipe with a delicious result.

These were delicious and easy to make. I did substitue a "light mayonnaise". With the grilled bread it made it difficult to eat with a knife and fork. Will definitely make these again, but think I will use a grilled ciabatta sandwich roll and eat it as a closed sandwich.

This was an awesome Sunday afternoon meal. I had no problems with the mixture holding together. The burgers were a huge hit and I will certainly make this again.

I used panko, grated parmesan and an egg - they held up, but I had to grill them longer than 5 minutes per side to get them to brown. Pretty good. Next time, I'll cut the mayonaise wtih low-fat yogurt. I felt guilty with all that mayo!

These were delicious and super easy to make. I used mini brioche and just as delicious. Also had the problem with the burgers not staying together well. I welcome any suggestions.

I used ground turkey instead of chicken, added in 1/2 c. shreadded asiago cheese and 1 egg in addition to the mayonnaise to help hold the mixture together. Make sure to add the brine from the Cornichons - I forgot at first... the addition made all the difference!

These burgers were very flavorful, but they wouldn't stay together. I added breadcrumbs to try and thicken the texture, but they were still way too gloopy to grill, so I pan fried them instead. I'll definitely try again, but maybe with ground turkey instead.

Cut recipe in half for 2. It was easy and delicious. Will make often!
