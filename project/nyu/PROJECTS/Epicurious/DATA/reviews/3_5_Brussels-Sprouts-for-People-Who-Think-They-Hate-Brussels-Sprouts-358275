OK, I still hate Brussels Sprouts, but my husband LOVES this recipe and asks me to make it often. I use a Jamie Oliver blend of chrushed chili pepper, salt and ginger instead of the plain pepper flakes.

I actually love b sprouts, but was looking for alternative to my usual roasting with drizzle of olive oil & kosher salt. I liked this quick and easy recipe very much. Forgot to add the nutmeg, and only used a sprinkle of the cheese. Very tasty and perfectly cooked with the times given

All the Parmesan cheese did was to turn an otherwise healthy veggie into a high calorie fat bomb! I far prefer steaming them and adding salt/black or cayenne pepper at the table to individual taste. Fresh, young, not over-cooked....that's all you need.

Just made this for Christmas and it was a huge success....love the bite of the pepper. I doubled recipe, but did not double the garlic and red pepper, increased both by 1/4. And, it still had plenty of both(depending on size of garlic cloves).

Um...NO. I can see why this is for folks who don't like sprouts, because under that many red pepper flakes, I certainly couldn't taste them. Like several others, I also didn't think the nutmeg served the dish well at all. I will definitely go back to my usual roasting or sauteing and finishing with balsamic vinegar.

This couldn't be easier, all of our guests enjoyed this. Might even add more red pepper flakes next time. B.J. Harrick

I don't know if the red pepper flakes I used were too hot or what, but this is not a recipe I would repeat. The nutmeg did not go well with the other flavors and the parmesan cheese was overwhelmed by the pepper flakes and nutmeg.

This is the first time I made a 4-fork dish and not liked it! All the parmesan melted and clumped in one sort of solid piece that I had to break up for each bite. It was a little too spicy and I didn't like the nutmeg with the sprouts.

Very tasty and very easy. I used pre-grated cheese and it was fine.

I love Brussels sprouts. I thought this recipe was too overpowering of the natural flavor. I guess that's the point. It was easy but not worth the sacrifice. Roasting is a better method.

I made the recipe as described and the taste was still very bitter. I got used to it after 99-10 bites but it's still not something I would make again.

I followed the recipe to the letter except that I just eyeballed the red pepper flakes... Woooo! A tad hotter than I expected, but loved the flavors! I will definitely make them again. Soon. This was my first experience cooking the "B" sprouts... and I did think I hated them. Aaaaaaaaand I don't. It's like they knew. Creepy.

Absolutely delicious - my new quick favorite go-to for brussels sprouts. If you don't have red pepper flakes, chili paste with garlic (an asian ingredient) can be substituted with fantastic results.

Wow. So delicious. This is a great way to get people to eat their veggies. I cut back on the parmesan by a lot becuase I was just too lazy to shred and it was still fantastic.

These are so yummy! I don't know if anything wouldn't be with garlic and parmesan! I did not use the nutmeg.

Loved this recipe. I only had 10 oz of sprouts so adjusted the remaining ingredients accordingly. Made 3 servings, so full recipe probably is 4 servings, BUT it's so good, maybe not. Probably would lighten up the oil just a tad. Will try feta as someone else suggested next time. Kudos, a repeater for sure and a snap to make.

This is a great recipe! I followed it to a T with the exception of substituting feta cheese cubes for the Parmesan at the end. I would recommending subbing feta to anyone, the flavors really work well.

Very tasty. I steamed the sprouts, then cut them in half to put them in with the spices. Hubby was digging them out after dinner to finish them off. But then, he likes his veggies. I had the usual 9 oz box of sprouts so I cut the other ingredients in half ...

I loved this recipe! I stayed light on the nutmeg for the first time and I could have used a bit more. I diced up some Portabello mushrooms and threw them in from the beginning step and they were a delicious addition!

I wanted to make this ahead of time. I blanched the brusselsprouts for three minutes, sauted the garlic in the olive oil with the crushed pepper and tossed the sprouts in the oil with the nutmeg. Placed in a flat casserole, topped with the parmesan and baked for 20 minutes before serving. Delicious!

We enjoyed this recipe, particularly loved the nutmeg. Must admit that we like brussel sprouts already, but always looking for good recipes. I will definitely make this again. It sure stunk up the house, though! :-)

This recipe is simple and delicious. Next time I will cook the halved Brussels sprouts 4 minutes instead of 5 to keep them a bit crunchy, as they continue to cook after you drain them. Despite the amount of garlic, it was appropriate for the recipe.

These were yummy, but how many servings does the recipe make?

Rating: 3
We really like the sprouts cooked this way; it was low calorie, which was a plus. Since there are only two of us, we used a little less than 1/2 lb. I think preparing the recipe as written doesn't require as much olive oil and cheese.

Nope. Still hated them. The recipe itself had a lot of potential (and the end product was pretty good), but it couldn't overcome the bitterness of the brussel sprouts, for me. I may try it with a different green, because all the ingredients were good. I should also add that I forgot the nutmeg.

I LOVE the layers of flavors in this recipe, especially the depth of the nutmeg and the kick of the hot pepper. So simple and easy to make - I will make this a basic in my household.

It's true! Thought I didn't like them, now I do! Same with others in my family- key not to undercook them or you will hate them!

To cpschaeffer: The recipe says to quarter the Brussels sprouts if large, halve them if small. So you shouldn't have seen whole sprouts sitting on your plate. I agree with those who said the amount of nutmeg and red pepper can be excessive and to start with half the amount and work your way up. Otherwise, this is a delicious combination of flavors and easy to make.

Both my wife and I happen to really like Brussels sprouts so we thought for sure we would love these. They were tasty but go easy on the pepper flakes and nutmeg. In fact, if it were me, I would cut the recommended amount in half at first. You can always add a little more.
