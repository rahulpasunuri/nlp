The desert tasted great and was a nice presentation. The desert was a little soft and would have benefited by cooking the rice mixture a little longer.

I followed this recipe to a T! It was a little on the sweet side but the worst part was that is was a solid as a brick. I had my suspicions about the gelatin and if I had the chance to do it all over again, I would omit that ingredient.

This is a very good recipe. I suggest soaking the rice longer at first. The rice pudding texture was very creamy but the rice needed to be more tender.
