I've made this daquoise several times and it's always a huge hit. It turns out so beautifully that my guests question whether I really made it. The filling makes a little more than you need and I've started using instant decaf after being awake half the night after eating it.

I was in a hurry and used Ben and Jerry's ice cream in lieu of the layer filling. (two pints, any flavor, softened) That turned out fine and was a big hit. But one day I'll try the cream filling. This is a keeper.
