Normally I don't cook with milk chocolate but a friend of mine bought me a really nice peice of it and I had to find some way to use it. This pudding was the perfect thing. I loved it with the raspberries. I served in wine glasses and left off the whip cream. Normally I like my chocolate desserts to be dark and rich enough to knock you off your chair and I was afraid the whip cream would detract from the nice but already mild flavor of milk chocolate.

Elegant, yet simple dessert. I used half milk chocolate and half semisweet chocolate. Seemed to help cut down on the sweetness. Also served it in martini glasses. Definite keeper!

Yum! What a great rich dessert. Not terribly difficult and a good dessert for a small dinner party or a cozy dinner for two.

The taste of the pudding was very good. This dish would make about 10-12 parfaits though. I would cut down the amount of whipping cream. 1 cup or 3/4 would be plenty. It was a very rich dessert. Good for Valentine's day for that chocolate fix!

I liked this recipe and would make it again, but I would definitely do a few alterations. It was too sweet for my taste, I would cut down on the sugar in the recipe. Don't forget that the milk chocolate you add will also have sugar. Also I like a thicker pudding, I would add a little more cornstarch next time to give it more of a traditional pudding consistancy. The berries and whipped cream both of which I served on the side were wonderful complements.

this was a quick and easy recipe to prepare! i served it in champagne/parfait styled glasses and it looked very elegant. i used high quality chocolate and the texture was rich and creamy. the tartness of the raspberries offset the the rich chocolate flavor. this dessert got great reviews!!!!!
