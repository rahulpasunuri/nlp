Perhaps it doesn't look appetizing as a recipe, but this is a family favorite and a recent holiday staple. I've only followed the directions, which has worked out well. The color is striking (as described), and my only issue is the best way to serve the dish (to maximize attractiveness). So far, I've stuck with family-style, so it doesn't matter much - but watch out for that table cloth!

beyond good. needs to be tripled, though (smile*) make it a lot, and tried it once with fresh dill, beet and dill are so good together.

I increased the feta according to some reviews here, but found a larger amount to be overwhelming. I will make again, but next time stick to the recipe as it was written because there are some good flavors here.

People who like beets loved the dish. I brought it to a party, and I don't think non-beet eaters touched it, but they did remark at how brightly colored it was. Truly, if you need to dye any t-shirts, save the beet juice. Bonus: if it's for a Mexican or Italian occasion, the colors match the flag. It's really easy to make. Again, beet eaters will be impressed. I tripled the recipe, so I had several layers of beets. Next time, I'd distribute some of the feta in the lower layers, so it's more evenly spread.

Easy, delicious and showy, this recipe is a real keeper. I served this at a girls' dinner and everyone loved it. The pink is unusual and the garlic-infused cream adds nuance. Make it ahead and enjoy.

This was very good! I'm not a lover of beets, but the cream and the feta made this a beet dish I could even eat.

Do you think I can make this for Thanksgiving to take? Everything except the mint, then just re-heat, and sprinkle on the mint at the destination.

Made this for the first time tonight. Definitely a big hit. Agree with "Infrequent" from Canada who suggests "Don't skimp on the feta!" Also, I added more mint in the layering process (many small torn bits of leaves); may even add more mint next time. Used a cup of cream instead of 3/4. Will likely increase all ingredients next time since it was so yummy... want more to serve! Delicious and delightful!

I have made this twice over the past two weeks, it is delicious. I did not have red beets, so I used yellow ones, which have a milder flavour. It is easy to make, and it's nice that some of the prep can be done ahead of time. Don't skimp on the feta!
