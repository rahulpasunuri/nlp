These were a treat! I loved the touch of black pepper, too. I used stevia and they turned out great.

Loved it... I often eat strawberries with balsamic topped with vanilla yogurt so this was a nice treat for me. I'll be making the pops all summer long. *** I used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda also did added to my 2nd batch a pinch of salt and some fresh lime juice.
