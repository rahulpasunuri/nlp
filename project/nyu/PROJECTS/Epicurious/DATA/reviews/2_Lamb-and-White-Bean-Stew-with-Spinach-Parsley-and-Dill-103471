Good idea to make sure your tumeric is absolutely fresh. An old spice can be dreadful.

I did a little experiment with some beef and broth... Even a teaspoon full of tumeric was enough to make it inedible. Quite the vile pollutant, actually. Not only is the spice off in this recipe, but it appears to me that the method would lead to an unappetizing result as well. Too much heat on the greens.

The problem with this recipe is that in order to get the lamb tender you have to cook it much longer than the recipe suggests and if you do, well the other reviewer was correct - you've got pond scum. I served this to first time visitors to our house and they said they liked it a lot, but perhaps they were only being kind, although they did take seconds. Adding spinach near the end is a good suggestion. There are lots of other recipes for lamb in the world much tastier than this one. I'd say don't bother.

To Sybilla: THERE IS DEFINITELY A MISPRINT IN THE AMOUNT OF TUMERIC IN THE RECIPE. I have the GG Cookbook and the recipe calls for only 1 Tablespoon of tumeric. I haven't made this recipe but it seems that maybe the additional tumeric was the reason for any negative reviews. According to a review I read on this cookbook, this was one of the recommended recipes!

First---the positive: It was filling. Next: It was a waste of good lamb. It was also more trouble than it was worth. It wasn't visually appealing unless you find pond scum attractive. What we didn't eat, we froze. We will thaw it out and serve it the next time un-invited company drops by for a free meal. This stuff will end that nasty habit.

I've made this twice with pork (since I don't like lamb very much) and baby spinach (instead of crinkly leaf), which I added at the end to prevent it from becoming slimy. Furthermore, I used only half the amount of parsley. Very tasty, especially the combination of dill, turmeric and pork.

This was an excellent dish that my family (they all love lamb) raved about. However, in my opinion two tablespoons of tumeric must be a misprint. This is a powerful spice: I use it a lot an have never used more than a teaspoon in a recipe. I used a teaspoon for a pound of lamb it it was enough

This was elegant and easy to make. I cooked it for a big crowd, including an aunt who is quite a gourmet, and it was really a hit. Serve with warm pita bread and orzo.

Replace the spinach with a winter green (like kale or escarole) and it comes out better, not much more, but better.

Ok, this dish was just nasty. I followed the recipe to the letter, but the flavor was horrible. Maybe my tumeric was bad, but the whole dish tasted like dirt - not earthy, just like dirt. My fiance, who likes almost anything I cook couldn't even finish a bowl. I wish I hadn't wasted good lamb on this dish.

We made this recipe for a family gathering. While it was tasty, it looked horrible due the brownish colour of the spinich once it cooked. In fact, we referred to it as 'swamp stew' in the kitchen. Tried dressing it up with a little chopped parsley (and dimmed lighting) but it didn't help much. I wouldn't suggest making this if you want to make a strong visual impression with guests.
