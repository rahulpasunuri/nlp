Made this recipe with pecans (what I had on hand) for some friends and they were delicious. Would definitely like to try with the macadamia nuts. This recipe is filed away for all those over-ripe bananas my husband leaves on the counter.

Loved this and will add it to my "best macadamia nuts recipes" blog on Squidoo. Try using fresh Hawaii Macadamia Nuts from Ahualoa Farms. The freshness and brand definitely makes a difference in taste. www.maunakeagold.com.

The flavor combination is unexpected but quite successful. The nuts cut down on the sweetness a bit and the nutmeg works well with bananas and macadamia nuts. Do make sure to toast the nuts as it makes a big difference.

I followed the path of many of the other reviewers and cut the sugar a bit. Also substituted walnuts a dark chocolate chips for the macadamia nuts. The outcome was most excellent! Imagion using the macadamia nuts and small white chocolate chips. Hmmn. Happy New Year to all?

Really yummy, but not as exotic as I had hoped. Macadamia nuts kind of got lost in the flavor. Maybe keep larger or use a different nut. Also, probably would have liked more spice. Very cake-like and sweet/delicate.

Turned out ok. Slight chemically taste from the baking soda and they were more cake like than muffin like. Nothing special.

Yum! Took earlier suggestions and halved the white sugar and added an extra banana. I also used half whole wheat and half white flour and added 2 Tbs wheat germ. These are delicious, light, moist and flavorful. Definite keeper.

This recipe is a great on it's own and a great base for experimenting. This time I made many of the previous adjustments: reduced white sugar to 1/4c., used 4 bananas and used 1/2c. whole wheat flour + 1c. all purpose flour. Some additional changes I made: substituted 1/2 coconut oil for butter, substituted 1/4 coconut milk for milk, added 1/4t. coconut extract and added unsweetened coconut and topped with macadamia nuts, coconut and raw sugar. The topping was beautiful and crunchy, the muffins moist and delicious!

This recipe is a keeper, it's fool proof! I made a double batch for a pot luck lunch at work. I used half the butter and used applesauce as well. I also forgot to add the milk. I was concerned they wouldn't come out right. They were good. I used pecans, they provided a nice crunch. I shared the recipe and Epicurious with a coworker.

We LOVE this recipe! Made it first without modifying the recipe and it was very good. Like others, I used 4 large bananas the next time I made it and liked that batch better. With the third batch I substituted applesauce for 1/2 of the butter (1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup butter) and subbed choc. chips for the macadamia nuts and these were the best by far!

i followed several users' recommendations on cutting the sugar, and even though they turned out good i think they could have been better with the original recipe.

I know there are tons of positive reviews of this recipe but I thought I would add to the abundant praise. These are extremely moist and fluffy muffins. I reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup (as recommended by others), upped the banana to 2 cups, and added some chopped white chocolate. Reducing the sugar makes these muffins noticeably less sweet than a regular muffin, so keep that in mind. All in all, really delicious!

Rating: 4
Yum! I made a lot of the same adjustments as others: 1/4 C white sugar, 1/2 stick butter, 1/4 C veg oil. I added 4 bananas. I also added a cup of fresh cranberries (leftover from Thanksgiving I was looking to use) instead of the nuts. The muffins were all gone the next day. Moist, fluffy, not too sweet with a nice banana flavor. I couldn't wait to try it again! A week later, the second time, I substituted 1/2 C applesauce for all of the butter. It definitely made it a little more dense. But still delicious and healthy too!

Crazy, but I took everybody's advice and changed the recipe and it makes a very good muffin. Reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup, did half butter/canola oil and replaced 1/4 cup white flour with whole wheat and yogurt for milk. Tasted great! Next time I would go for 1/2 whole wheat flour.

Perfect recipe for the dreaded ripe bananas that I am sure plague many a kitchen.I made the recipe as directed, however, I thought it could do with less sugar as many others commented. The muffins turned out moist and flavorful. I will make this recipe everytime we have bananas lying around.

really exceptional! i have searched for years for a banana nut bread/muffin recipe as good as my mothers and this is it! a secret: add two tablespoons of sour cream to the wet mixture for even more smooth, creamy moistness (mom's secret and it worked great on these too!) also, feel free to cut back on the white sugar and add more banana... you basically can't ruin these!

Excellent, moist and delicious. I too substituted pecans, half wheat flour and left half the white sugar out. I also cooked them for about 20 minutes rather than 25. They are worth making again.

I'm grateful to all of the reviewers who provided excellent suggestions for reducing the fat and sugar in this recipe. I reduced the sugar by half, substituted applesauce and canola oil for most of the butter, and used half whole wheat flour. I also used pecans left over from Thanksgiving pie-making. The muffins are moist and delicious and plenty sweet. I made a double batch and froze them. They thaw beautifully.

These muffins were delicious! They're really easy to make and they turn out super moist! My mom that never eats muffins had 3! The banana flavor doesn't leave (which I have experienced prior to making these) and they stay pretty moist (if kept properly) for a good solid 2 days. If there is someone out there who really loves fruit muffins that are really moist makes these ones! I'm definitely using this recipe from now on.

I altered the recipe quite a bit and it turned out delicious! I made some alt. for health reasons ie. sub. 1/2 cup rice flour in place of flour to reduce the glutens, and used 1/4 cup applesauce in place of half the butter, rice milk instead of milk, walnuts instead of macadamias, and I used quite a bit less sugar and it is definitely sweet enough!!

I loved these muffins. I didn't have macadamias, so I used walnuts. Other than that, I stayed true to the recipe. Delicious! I ate these for breakfast all week. To reheat, I wrapped two in foil and baked at 300 for 15 or 20 minutes, then buttered the warm muffins. Was just right for these cold winter mornings.

Great versatile recipe. I've prepared as directed and with variations - and always had success. The most recent rave review was using half bananas and half chopped to-ripe-to-eat-raw apples after harvest, a pinch of cinnamon and ginger, and almonds instead of macadamias. Oh, and a squeeze of lemon juice in with the wet ingredients. For wonderfully light, fluffy and perfectly moist muffins, make sure to not overmix. Results will be awesome!

I made these and used walnuts becuse that is what I had on hand and threw in a big handful of coconut. They were perfectly moist and had wonderful flavor. Instead of nutmeg I used 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.

Very good. I have made this once a week for the last three weeks - the first time I made it as written, the second swapped macadamia nuts for walnuts, omitted the nutmeg and added cocoa to the flour mixture, and the third time added toasted coconut to the batter and topping. Wonderful each time. I'm going to experiment to substitute baking powder for the baking soda though. My one criticism is that my most recent batch had a wee bit of that metallic baking-soda-taste, and I'm not sure why - it may very well have been an error on my part. Still though, a really good recipe - the texture is lovely.

These are fabulous! Absolutely delicious. Stay with the macadamia nuts, avoid changing out for another nut. (Hand chopping is a must, keep the pieces pretty large.) I don't consider them "tropical" but I love them, as did all of my guests. Have made them several times now.

Absolutely delicious! Macadamia nuts make the recipe! I made it with few small variations: instead of nutmeg I added vanilla, and also added a handful of chocolate chips. Since I needed more than 12 muffins, I baked them in a mini muffin tins for about 15-18 minutes, and had 36 muffins that disappeared within a few hours! Next time I'll try some healthy substitutions (whole wheat flour, apple sauce instead of butter)

This is a great recipe! Of course, I made a few modifications, which, I think makes them out of this world! First, I was pretty apprehensive about this mod but i used 1 cup of AP flour and 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour. Instead of the 1/2 cup of white sugar, I used 1/2 cup of Agave Nectar. I added 1/2 cup of unsweetened dried coconut to the batter. For the topping, I added to the remaining macadamias 3-4 tblsp brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg. I topped the muffins with this mixture, then sprinkled them with a little bit of raw sugar. Then finally sprinkled them with the dried coconut. This is an awesome muffin. My friends and family were blown away!

I'll admit right up front I did not put any nuts in the muffins (they are for the kids) but these were so good anyway. The muffin was so moist and tender and has such a great banana flavor. I did put 1/2 c mini choc chips in them (they are for dessert) and sprinkled a very little bit of raw sugar on top. Even w/ those additions I did not think they were too sweet. The sugar gave a nice little crunch on top. Next time I will definitely add the macadamias.

these muffins have the perfect banana-baked good texture - dense and moist, but not too much so. i add a generous sprinkle of cinnamon and half a cup of chocolate chips. works well with walnuts if you don't have macadamias.

I was looking for a new banana nut muffin recipe since the Joy of Cooking's muffins weren't rockin' my world. These were fantastic!

I can't wait to try this again with other people's recommendations of chocolate chips and coconut.

This is an easy and delicious recipe. I would recommend it to all. I used all brown sugar, as I prefer it to white. I also put dark chocolate chips in 1 batch with success. The bananas I used were too-ripe bananas that I had then thrown in the freezer for later use in banana bread.

I have made this recipe many times with many variations and substitutions. I eliminate white sugar and use 1/2 c. brown only. I substitute 1/2 c. flour with 1/2 c. almond flour/meal (from Trader Joes.) I use only 1/2 stick butter because the almond flour has fat in it. I know, I know, it is annoying to rate a recipe and blather on about substitutions. But, I wanted to make a lower carb/sugar variation, and there is no compromise at all in flavor or texture with these subs. Everyone asks for the recipe for these muffins, so I thought I'd share.....

Rating: 4
Excellent banana muffin recipe. Very moist and flavourful. The only thing I did differently was sprinkle a little turbinado sugar on top of the batter along with the nuts. My husband didnt care for the macadamia nuts but everyone else loved them. If you dont care for the nuts, the possibilities are endless. Add chocolate chips, coconut etc or add nothing at all. This is a keeper.

Rating: 4
These were indeed delicious muffins! The only change I made was to substitute 1/2 cup of applesauce for half the butter and to use buttermilk instead of milk. These came out impressively banana flavored (I am confused about other reviews saying not enough banana flavor - maybe they did not use ripe enough bananas?) and the texture was wonderful. I think next time I would use either pecans or walnuts, because the macadamia nuts were expensive and didn't really add anything extra that the other nuts would not. I wish I had thrown a 1/2 cup or so of coconut in - maybe next time!

Rating: 3
I substituted 1/2 cup wheat flour, used 1 tablespoon cinnamon instead of the nutmeg, used 1/2 stick of butter, 1/4 cup of plain lowfat yogurt instead of milk, and used chopped dates instead of nuts. They were beautiful with the dark dates poking out. My family said they were rich and melt-in-your-mouth but I felt they did not have sufficient flavor--next time I will add coconut, more dates, strawberry yogurt instead of plain, and chunks of banana in the batter (or try slices on top). I also wish the muffins rose more but that part is my fault probably, since I used some wheat flour.

Mm, very good. I'm afraid I made some alterations (below) to make these more of an everyday treat. Even so they were wonderful- not greasy, fluffy but filling, and sticky on top. I'd rate my own at 3 forks, but have no doubt that the real version are divine!! 1)white flour = 1 cup white and 1/2 cup whole wheat 2)1/2 stick of butter = 1/4 stick cup butter & 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce 3)white and brown sugars = 1/2 cup light brown sugar 4)1/4 cup milk = 1/4 cup fat-free yogurt 5)1 cup mac nuts = 1/4 cup pecans & 1/4 cup dark chocolate chunks 6)Nutmeg = 1 tsp vanilla extract, as I dislike nutmeg and wanted some extra sweetness 7)Add 1/4 tsp baking powder for an extra lift. If you're going for the full-out version I'd definitely recommend devising a sweet and crunchy topping too!

Loved this recipe! My substitutions (based on what I did/didn't have on hand): I used 1/4 cup of fat free sour cream instead of milk and 1 cup of roasted and chopped pecans, pistachios and cashews instead of the macadamias. Omitted the 1/4 teaspoon of salt (the pecans were salted) and used 1/4 cup of packed Splenda brown sugar blend. Baked in paper-lined cups for 20 minutes (not 25), and they were just amazing! The texture was moist and the variety of nuts in the batter was a delicious and flavorful accident!!! This is definitely a keeper recipe.

Added 1/2 cup of Hershey's milk chocolate chips and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. My boys won't even wait until they cool. Cooked for 17-18 minutes in my gas oven at 350 degrees.

This is my second time making this. I make a loaf instead of muffins. This is truly the best tasting banana bread/muffins I've ever tasted. Very moist!

Great recipe for your old bananas. I could have used a little more suger.

Quick and easy recipe as well as delicious! Easy to adjust as needed. I had walnut, not macadamia. Next time I want to try with macadamia and chocolate chunks. (i don't lean toward the healthy versions). I use a wooden spoon to mash the bananas and mix the liquid stuff, so the bananas stay chunky, not smooth as when you beat them.

These are truly outstanding, although I probably shouldn't be rating them as I substituted for just about everything, to make them healthier and to account for the materials I can get here in Greece. Anyway, here goes my version: substituted 1/2 C whole-wheat flour, added some ground vanilla, used neither white nor dark brown sugar but 2/3 C regular light brown sugar plus 1 tbs molasses, used only 1/4 C butter and substituted another 1/4 C buttermilk for the rest, used soy milk instead of milk and toasted almonds instead of macadamias, 2/3 of which I added to the batter. And everyone LOVES them! I realize I have essentially made a different recipe, but I figure there must be other people out there who want healthy versions of delicious food and I wanted to share that, with all my substitutions, these are absolutely incredible and they got wolfed down by everyone, including people who don't care one bit if what they're eating is healthy or not!

Made as-is except that I substituted walnuts because I had them on hand. Easy to prepare and delicious!

I made this recipe using 1 cup AP flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour to make it a bit healthier. I also substituted almonds because I had them on hand. I made this recipe in a small round cake pan. I cooked the cake about 40 minuets. It was moist, delicious, and somewhat healthy with the whole wheat flour.

I will definitely make this over and over again. I will loose my old recipe for banana nut muffins. I didn't use macadamia but pecan pieces instead. Everyone loved them!

This was great! I omitted the nuts (since I had none), and made as a loaf rather than individual muffins. The center "fell" a bit, but the taste was still great. This is my NEW banana bread recipe!

Oh, these are GOOD! I added 1c choc chips and 1/2 tsp. vanilla, also substituted walnuts 'cause they were on hand...YUM! and they're so easy to make. I will definetly make again. I would love to have them with a crumb topping, perhaps a recipe will surface, and I can combine them...hmmmm

I'm throwing away the family recipe I've been using ever since I learned to cook; this one is so much better! I substituted walnuts (no macadamias in the house) and also added 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and 3/4 C. of chocolate chips. The entire family raved over these moist, buttery, banana-rich muffins. They can't wait for the next bunch of bananas to over-ripen!

Very moist and much more banana-y than my usual banana muffin recipe. I used half whole wheat flour and substituted cashew nuts that I was trying to use up. I ate one and my husband ate the rest in two days. I think he likes 'em.

Very moist and delicious. I substituted walnuts for the Macadamias. This is a keeper!

Best muffins we've ever eaten! I used the toss- and-taste method- tossed in some toasted coconut flakes, drained crushed pineapple, and grated fresh ginger-then I tasted the batter until it was just right. I was trying to copy gourmet muffins we get in Hawaii. These are better.

I have been on a quest for a moist banana nut muffin/bread, and have found it! This recipe is easy and the result is delicious. I especially liked using butter instead of oil - that and the macadamia nuts are what make this particular recipe really stand out. I added a bit of vanilla and made it in mini pans, cutting the cooking time by half. I may add some crystallized ginger or white chocolate chips next time for an extra kick!

Oops! I made these in a hurry and accidentally left out the white sugar. They were still very good (my bananas were about black)---also used finely chopped walnuts and added all of them to the batter. Next time I'll use some white sugar, but maybe only 1/4 cup.

As far as banana muffins go, this is the best I've come across so far. I made 1-1/2 times the recipe which yielded 18 muffins. Substituted walnuts for macadamia nuts, 1/2 & 1/2 for milk, and topped with hawaiian large grain sugar for a nice crunch. Crystallized ginger, coconut, or dried mango or pineapple bits might be a nice addition for next time. Incredibly moist.

To make them even more tropical, I added some grated fresh ginger root, as well as a small amount of golden raisins. My friends loved them!

Recipe is wonderful even with other kinds of nuts.

These are amazing! Moist and full of flavor (I used REALLY ripe bananas). I subbed pecans and allspice only because that's what I had. I'd do these with walnuts too. I'll be making these often especially since it took me no time to throw them together.

We tried to make a low fat version of this recipe, so we didn't add any butter. It tasted great, though a little rubbery. Also, if you decide not to add butter, the muffin sticks to your muffin cups so be prepared. Overall great tasting, but prefer with walnuts instead of macadamians.

These are terrific, especially when they're hot out of the oven! I ate a couple right then, and it was only afterward that I realized that I had forgotten something -- the butter. So, I realized that I was eating essentially fat-free muffins (okay, divide the fat in the egg yolk by twelve muffins and see what you get), and they were great! They still had a nice texture, a good flavor, and it was all by accident. Oh, I also substituted almonds for the macadamia nuts (that one WAS intentional), just because it was what I had on hand. I can't wait to try it now with all the butter! Mmmm..

This muffins are delicious, the texture stays moist even the following day. I substituted Pecan nuts for the Macadmia and it tasted wonderful. However, I found it a bit too sweet, it's probably because of the banana which added to the sweetness. Will definitly make again.

I Now have a winning recipe for my MUFFIN TOPS! unfortunately I added a little too much moisture for them to come out the way I prefer, BUT I made some wonderfully tasty soft flat cookies! My fault. I would cut out the 1/4 cup of milk or at least cut it to 1/8 cup as you do if you are using the package muffin mix. My substitutes were in the spice. I used a "cake spice" that contains some nutmeg, cinnamon, etc. I also simply used some finely chopped walnuts. I am sure the others would be wonderful too! Oh, it's better to use those ol' black bananas too, otherwise you don't get the flavor.

You can add rock sugar to the top for an additional texture and flavor.

Very simple to make and yet very delicious. Texture was very light and spongy. I made them in mini muffin cups and made 24, they're excellent snacks for kids lunchboxes.

Just made these this weekend to big compliments. They are very moist and the macadamia nuts are so nice, but my only quibble is that I felt they could have benefited form a little more banana flavor. Maybe I didn't use enough banana, or maybe the addition of a couple drops of banana flavoring would help. But overall they were delicious and wre gone in a flash.

Have made this with and without nuts and, on occassion, added dried cherries and/or strawberries. The kids just love these muffins.

Nice texture...I added honey to my mashed bananas. Instead of baking soda used baking powder..they came out just fine!!!

These are truly scrumptious but then how could you go wrong with a cube of butter (sinful but great). Made them for a luncheon and they were a hit. I didn't have macadamias but they were still great with walnuts. Can't wait to try them with the macadamias.

I have made this recipe 2 times, the first time I didn't have macadamia nuts and used walnuts in their place, I also baked this in 2 small loaf pans which I placed in a water bath and baked it for 50 minutes. It was the best banana bread I have ever tasted! The second time I used macadamia nuts, stuck with the loaf pans but added a little more baking soda to give it some extra rise.... I baked it without a water bath and reduced the cooking time to 40 minutes ~ This is a first class recipe - I will make this many times Mm-m-m-m!

Have made these muffins many times. They're great as is but sensational when a little coconut and pineapple are added to the batter.

I make this recipe often; my family loves it! I substitute hazelnuts for the macadamias; they're not so oily. I'll try the coconut option one reviewer mentioned; sounds good!

Very impressed.....I used a cup of choclate chips instead of nuts and they turned out A+..would definitly make them again and again.

I've already made these twice. Love the texture. Lighter than banana bread, hearter than cake. I, also, am too cheap to spring for the macadamia nuts, but walnuts are just fine!

A nice recipe for a favorite comfort food. Here's how I varied this recipe with great success: First, I substituted honey for the brown sugar, and walnuts for the macadamias. Second, I made mini muffins instead of the regular sized version and thus decreased the baking time to just 15 minutes. I ended up with 36 delicious muffins!

These are great, a nice change from banana bread. I'm glad to have another recipe for brown bananas!

I used this as a basic banana-nut muffin recipe, using walnuts instead of macadamia nuts. The muffins were delicious (I loved the texture) but not quite sweet enough. Next time I'll probably use an extra banana and a little more sugar.

This was one of the best muffins I've come across! It's definately not fat free, but it's worth every calorie. I added 1/2 t. coconut extract and sprinkled some sweetened shredded coconut on top before baking for a more tropical flare. They look and taste awesome!
