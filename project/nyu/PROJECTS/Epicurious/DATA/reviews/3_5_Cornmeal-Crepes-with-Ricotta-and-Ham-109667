I didn't like this, at all. It sounded good but once it was done the flavors just didn't do it for me. It will be interesting to see what my son and husband say...

i made this with a couple variations and it was quite delicious. i used chiles in the ricotta instead of the jam, though i really like the sound of the jam. I also used crumbled bacon instead of ham, which was great! i used 5 pc thick sliced, but i'd use less next time. for the topping i added fava beans and roasted baby squash, a little white wine and 1/2 c cream. worked out lovely

Fabulous! A big hit with all the different textures and flavors. Very easy to make and a huge crowd pleaser.

I'd never had a cornmeal crepe before, but I ended up liking the end result, which was somewhat heartier than the traditional crepe (and more apt to crumble). I recommend doubling the ham and browning it a bit before adding it to the filling -- mmm.

I love all the ingredients that go into this recipe and am a huge fan of crepes, but I must dissent and say that I and all my family members thought the end product was rather dull. I would not drain the ricotta as the previous reviewer suggested, as the crepes are not runny at all after baking and would probably be too dry.

These were outstanding, and definitely worth the effort. A bit of advice: The batter separates quickly, so be sure to remix it before each crepe. And do make them in the size noted. Smaller won't hold the filling well, and larger are too unwieldy for turning.

Drain the excess liquid from the ricotta in the fridge for a few hours to keep the crepes from getting mushy once you fill them.
