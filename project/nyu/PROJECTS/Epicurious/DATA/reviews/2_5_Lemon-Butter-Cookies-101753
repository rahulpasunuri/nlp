This is one of my favorite cookies to make. I love the texture of the cookie and the mild lemon flavor. Overall is good.

These cookies really need much more lemon zest. The flavor was very mild. I might consider making them again if I were serving them with a lemon sorbet or something very intensely flavored.

We took our chances with this one...and were quite disappointed. Not very much flavor at all, despite the lemon rind. Definately quite disappointed, but we iced them with confectioners sugar and lemon juice and they tasted alot better.

It's really between a one and a two forks but it's too doughy and not buttery nor lemony enough. Don't bother - you'll be disappointed.

Very, very yummy cookies. Nice light lemony flavor. I ended up icing them with a powdered sugar and milk mixture, which is very nice. Dough is fairly sticky, so keeping it chilled is a must

Nice texture for the cookies, but I was looking for a more intense lemon flavor. I iced the backs of the cookies with a thin layer of icing made with confectioner's sugar and a little lemon juice. I'd make them again with the icing.
