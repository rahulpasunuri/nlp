This is what I did: Toasted 1/2 baguette split down the middle lengthwise. Grated 2 plum tomatoes by halving lengthwise, seeding, then flattening the cut side against big holes of grater and grating into a small bowl, minus skins. Added some good evoo, s&p, and a clove of garlic grated on the small teardrop holes. Mixed in a few chopped anchovies. Spread this on the toast. Delicious! Every bit as good as what I've had in Spain.

I have to agree with the previous reviewer about the preparation of this dish. Where I stayed in Mallorca, however, they served it with white anchovies which are milder and very flavorful. They are more expensive than 'regular' anchovies and are usually found in the deli section of gourmet markets but do try to seek them out for this dish - makes a heck of a difference.

I lived in Barcelona for a year, and the traditional dish is called pa amb tomaquet, or bread with tomato... I'm sure that there are places to find it with anchovies, but the were never part of my experience. I think that the quality of the bread is one of the most important factors in enjoying this dish... a more artisanal bread will make a much better end result. The host family i lived with would slice the bread in 1/4 to 1/2 inch slices, and toast it... then a peeled garlic clove would be rubbed all over the crusty, toasted bread and it would be drizzled with a premium EVOO (again - quality VERY important... an extra light olive oil wont give the same result). the tomato could either be rubbed in the same manner as the garlic or sliced thinly and placed on top... with the right ingredients, this is an awesome "tapa"!
