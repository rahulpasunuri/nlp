If the eggs are to be filled with candies, sterilize them instead of just washing. Fill a saucepan with water. Place the blown eggs in the water one at a time, holding each one down until it fills with water and stays submerged. Make sure the eggs are covered with water. Bring the water to a boil and simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Remove the eggs to a drying rack (see tip, below) and let them drain as much as possible. When they are cool enough to handle, drain any remaining water by blowing it out with a straw. Submerge the eggs in a bowl of cool water and then drain again. Transfer them to an egg carton and let stand at room temperature to dry. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Blown-Eggs-351969#ixzz1I65ncFwQ

So, I conceived of doing this 6 years ago, when I was 15... but the issue came up of how to sterilize a blown out egg. Usually to sterilize one boils, but blown eggs want to float, and even if you submerge them to get water inside, all egg shells have a membrane on the inside of the shell, that is tricky to peel off even when the shell is halved. Since the instructions assume everyone knows how to sterilize the inside of an egg-- could someone please impart upon me this knowledge? Thank you.

These may look complicated but they're fairly easy to make. I used large eggs and they required about 3 oz of chocolate each. I dyed them after sterilizing them instead of spraying them and I used Hershey's special dark chocolate with cayenne pepper added to fill them. I did put aluminum foil with a hole in it over the eggs to fill them so I didn't get chocolate all over the egg.

really. what a delight. the name does not lie. a pleasure to make. a thrill to give as gifts. i did however make one change: I used quail eggs instead of chicken eggs. The shells come pre- splattered and the amount of chocolate is easier to enjoy in one sitting. all and all though (and I can't say this enough), the name does NOT lie. chocolate-filled delights are truly that: A DELIGHT!!!!
