I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and Christmas. It is soooooooooo good! My family always had the gel stuff out of a can which I've never liked. I decided it was time try and make my own. I looked at alot of recipes and tried 2. There's really no comparison. If you are a cranberry fan, you'll be in heaven eating this one.

I made this recipe several years in a row. I've served it both hot or cold and everyone loves it. It does make a lot, so I think I'll try the canning suggestion this year. The cranberries cook fast, so I prep the apples before I start. I also like to cook my apples a little more, so I add them at the beginning. Orange zest and/or orange liquor would be great addition/substitution for the calvados.

Very good. Added a small amount of cloves and some vanilla.

Excellent. A keeper! Very fresh- great texture. Added a few passes of orange zest.

Love this recipe - yummy, easy and impressive. It really brightens a holiday table. It makes a big batch so there is enough to put into glass jars and give a away. It freezes nicely and goes well with many things pork, beef, chicken and on sandwiches.

I substituted two cups of walnuts with one cup of raisins. It turned out absolutely amazing, although the raisins made it a bit too sweet. Otherwise, it is definitely a keeper!

Loved it! I did the recipe exactly as given and it turned out great. It was a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner and I have requests for Christmas. I just used regular brandy and it did add a bit of complexity to the recipe, but I wouldn't say it's required. I made it the night before, but I think I might try it hot for Christmas because it was so good just right out of the pan.

This recipe is really good. I'd been making another cranberry sauce recipe with cloves and cinnamon for years, but I think this tops the other one in a second. The recipe is so simple and fast and the combination of ingredients is just perfect. It's more like a compote with the stewed apples, but with the crunch of the walnuts, it's just the perfect touch.

Wow. This is delicious warm right out of the saucepan (I didn't even know I liked warm cranberry sauce). I upped the brandy just a bit, which added more depth but also meant it's probably staying at the grown-up table. I would reduce the amount of walnuts so it's not so nut centric, but delicious either way and super easy.

FANTASTIC!! i used both stick & ground cinnamon - (we love it!) and it turned out scrumptious!! The brandy and all the textures -- DEEE-lish! What doesn't get scarfed today, will be jarred for dressing up a ham for dinner some night!

The brandy and cinnamon gave it a nice complexity and made it more suitable for a holiday meal. The apples add a nice crunch and sweetness in contrast to the tartness of the cranberries. Unfortunately I had to omit the walnuts after burning them during the toasting process...still delicious!

Delicious. I made it a week ahead of Thanksgiving for an office party and froze it. The walnuts retained most of their crunch. Adding the cranberries in stages really gives the chutney an interesting mix of textures. I added a splash of orange juice and Grand Marnier in place of the brandy.

I come back to it year after year - it stays forever, I eat it way after Thanksgiving with cottage cheese or on bread. It isn't too sweet and the 'staging' of the cranberries gives it heft. I winner all around

It's easy to make and everyone loves it. I've been making it the past three years and it's a hit.

This is a fantastic winter accompaniment & I agree with the previous user about canning - it's a great recipe for it & it's very pretty. I put it in jars & have already given away a couple as gifts. I'm not big on allspice, but I thought it enhanced the recipe & it's a small amount so I've kept it in. I also used ground cinnamon instead of a stick (2t but I really like cinnamon). I will probably bring a jar to Thanksgiving dinner, but it would also work well at Christmas time. It made my kitchen smell very Christmas-ey. I'm going to try a mini- batch with Splenda next to see if it will translate into a more "diabetic friendly" version for a few diabetic relatives.

I made this to can it. I can't see why the recipe doesn't mention that it's perfect for canning. It's also delicious warm or cold, on it's own or as a side dish.

This is a great dish. it's easy and makes a ton. you'll have enough for days

I liked this dish a lot. I thought that it was better fresh because you could really taste the toasted walnut flavor. I would skip the allspice next time. I didn't use the brandy either. I made it for Thanksgiving, but everyone seemed to prefer the boring plain cranberry sauce I made.

I loved this cranberry sauce so much that I had to stop myself from eating too much of it after it had cooled. I didn't have turbinado sugar, so I used organic sugar and added a small amount of molasses. Just delicious!

I gave this 4 forks because it is easy, versatile, and delicious. I made it Thanksgiving Day for dessert, layered with pudding and puff pastry squares. I just had it this morning on toast, and I think it would be great on turkey or pork. I made the recipe as written, but cut it down to 1/3 of the amounts. It still made plenty! Will be making this one frequently.

Absolutely delicious! Made this on Monday and let it mellow in the 'fridge until Thanksgiving. The walnuts retained a nice crunch and the combo of cranberries and apples and spices was wonderful. It was a big hit!

I made this for Thanksgiving today. It was so easy and better yet everyone LOVED it. Even my dad who "hasn't eaten cranberries since the '59 cancer scare" liked this recipe. I'll be making this again next year!

Use a large pot, this makes enough for an army. It is really tasty.

This dish was very easy to make, plus it tastes and looks super. I didn't have walnuts, so I used pecans. Also, I substituted orange brandy (Gran Gala) for the Calvados, this added a nice orange flavor. Thumbs up!

Absolutely loved this, and I'm not wild about cranberries.

Made this Sunday night for Thanksgiving on Thurs. It is really quite good; I just hope the walnuts hold up (the recipe says that it will hold a week.) I'll re-post if they don't -- but this is delish and easy.

I just made this recipe in preparation for Thanksgiving in a few days. It's currently cooling, but my husband and I just tried it. My husband's grandmother used to make cranberry sauce, and he says its far better than hers! I thought it was a lovely taste - sweet, but still with a nice tart and spicy flavor. It was also very easy to make.
