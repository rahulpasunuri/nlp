I only use the freshest ingredients and this dip, served with dark, whole grain crackers (West Coast Crisps) and fresh veggies, has guests raving every time. I use real Mayo, 1 tbsp fresh lemon, and grate my Parmesan-Reggiano fresh. The flavour of the dip is very suttle but really compliments the dark crackers & veg. Let sit for at least one hour before serving.

This dip is not worth the ingredients or the time (although minimal) to make it. It was very bland - and I did use high quality ingredients. I had to add Frank's Red Hot to give it a bit of oomph but still my dip loving friends didn't eat it.

I thought this was great!! Very easy, and different from the normal dip. I put together a veggie platter with blanched asparagus, green beans, marinated artichokes, red pepper, muchsrooms, etc and my guests ate it up. I'm making it again today. I used a very high quality Parmigiano-Reggiano, which is key.

I hated this as a dip. I spread it on phyllo dough with sundried tomatoes and basil. Baked it at 350 for 25 minutes. This was delicious!

Liked it better with the minced white onion and red pepper flakes.

I "kicked it up" with minced white onion and red pepper flakes. Also yummy on pasta hot or cold.

I stuffed this into cream puffs that I made with cheese and they went first on the table as people kept coming back for more. Also stuffed some with cream cheese, mayo and dill which also were a big hit.

Good, good, good. Simple,quick,and great with raw veggies. It's essential to use good quality imported Parmesan and real mayo.
