Too sweet. So sweet that all the fruits tasted the same.

Made this for my dad last Christmas. He loves mincemeat pie, but no one else does, so this was a nice change and everyone tried it. He still prefers traditional mincemeat pie, but did tell me this pie is a keeper.

I would much rather use my sour cherries on a real cherry pie than waste them on this recipe. It was overly sweet and spiced. Not my taste. On the other hand, the pie was a hit at work.

WOW! This is a fabulous pie. I did a run through prior to Thanksgiving. I let the mixture "cure" for 4 days before making into a pie. Everyone who tasted it said it was the best pie they'd ever had. I added 1/2 c. fresh cranberries (simmered until they popped)and doubled the Brandy. It was sensational! "Mincemeat" as the title does not do this recipe justice!

I make this pie every year for Thanksgiving. Life just doesn't get any better than this. The flavors are so deep and complex you'll be surprised. Get absolutely the freshest ingredients. I make the filling when pears come in season and put it up (i.e. can it) to let the flavors develop. Not necessary, but soooo worth it! I rarely make the same recipe twice, because there are so many to try and so little time, but this is one is very special.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving. However, a friend from Britain said "this is not mincemeat" while my husband claimed "this is the best apple pie I've ever eaten". So if you're looking for a delicious alternative to the standard apple, check this out.
