I made this for a dinner party tonight. It was fantastic. I brined it for 24 hours then rinsed and patted it dry. I didn't have fresh sage and used a tablespoon of dried. I didn't have enough pan juice to make a sauce but it didn't need it. Everyone loved it and raved about the flavor. It was tender and juicy. I was worried it would be too salty because of the brine but it was perfect. I didn't add any other salt or pepper. When I make it again I'll probably finish the last 5 minutes under a broiler to crisp up the bacon on top. It was easy to make with impressive results. Will definitely make again!

The recipe is very straight forward to make and definitely a pretty dish. I wasn't as impressed with the pork itself as I thought I would be, but the pan jus sauce makes the dish! It took a relatively boring, typical wrapped pork tenderloin and made it extraordinary. I'll definitely be making this again and trying to figure out how to double the sauce from this go around.

My niece and her husband made this for our Easter dinner tonight. They followed the directions to a T. Love the results, tender, flavorful with a great sauce to drizzle over the sliced meat. Delicious! I saved the recipe so I can make it at home.

Made this for Easter dinner this year and we made extra to make sure we would have enough. Although the loin we used did not make much sauce, it had such rich, excellent flavor that not much was necessary. This was quite delicious and although a bit time consuming and requiring a little planning, it wasn't difficult and yielded excellent results. Just a note, it didn't take a full 1 1/4 hours to reach 140 in our oven, so be sure to check it closer to an hour.

made 1/2 of the whole loin and it fed 13 adults. Relatively easy with great results. Very moist and flavorful. Used some Hickory chips and cooked it indirectly on my kettle grill. Bacon wrap made for neat presentation and held in moisture plus adding flavor.

delicious. Made this with a pork tenderloin, so had to reduce amount of bacon on top and basting liquid, but it was tender and delicious. Served with mashed potato and carrots cooked in the same maple syrup/vinegar.

Exsqueeze me, but how in the world did this multistep recipe make it into the quick and easy category? I'm a lazy chef, no, wait... I'm lazy. I trust that clock symbol to mean "quick" and easy.

Made this recipe for Christmas Day for my Mother in Law. Everyone at the table absolutely moaned with pleasure. I served it with a tart cranberry sauce, kale, and mashed potatoes. A delicious meal- don't change a thing!

I love reading these reviews where people blame the recipe for a dry peiee of meat. If your pork came out dry, it isn't the recipe's faulty, it's YOUR fault. Don't over cook the pork!!!!! Pork does not need to be roasted until it's shoe leather!!! This recipe has bacon around it so if you can't cook a moist pork roast, especially when it's wrapped in something as fatty as bacon, then you clearly need to go back to square one. This recipe is lovely just as is.

This was a part of a three course meal in Gourmet which was dedicated to Canada. My roast yielded hardly any fat juices, so I could only make about a quarter cup of gravy. In the future I will make sure to have pork stock on hand. This recipe was a part of an amazing three course dinner in Gourmet, dedicated to Canada. The salad was amazing. Its in epicurious under the following title: "Orange and Endive Salad with Maple Chipotle Vinaigrette"

In my usual style, I picked a "quick and easy" recipe for the meat I had on hand, scanned the ingredients and put it together in a rather imprecise way. Didn't brine, no sage, sprinkled a smaller piece of pork with chopped garlic, thyme and rosemary (the rosemary won and was good), drizzled with maple syrup, draped bacon over and shoved it in the oven in about 5 minutes. Poured the syrup and vinegar over later; that is a nice touch. Baked small potatoes at the same time. I like sweet things, and I liked this. It was easy, there was a good flavor combination. The pork stays white and unappealing underneath the bacon strips which move when you cut the pork, is the only thing that detracts. Not enough juices to make a sauce. Just poured what little there was over the meat. Good and easy.

This dish was exceptional and the recipe was written perfectly. Will excitedly make this again!

Amazing! It was a great dish! The only minor disappointment was, despite following the directions exactly, there were not nearly enough drippings left for the sauce. I substituted home-made apple sauce for dipping, and it was the perfect complement to the pork. I'll definitely make this dish again!

I made this for Easter and it was fantastic! I wrapped it in 1/4 inch thick bacon so I didn't need all 16 strips, and it worked well. I recommend serving it with red potatoes sauteed in garlic butter, its a great match :)

This was definitely good, just not my favorite. Made it pretty much exact with a smaller tenderloin--oh, and thyme instead of sage... it was juicy and flavorful, but not a "wow" for me. Would definitely use the brine again.

The salt overpowered this recipe and didn't give it the desired juciness I had hoped for. The maple fell short of flavoring the meat. Merely an "ok" recipe but I wouldn't make it again.

Well this recipe look really good but, i had to put my touch on it. you can follow the recipe but instead of putting it in the oven I put mine in the smoker. with soaked wood chips. it was done in an indirect heat with a pn in the middle of the smoker but the best part is in the pan I put some rum about a 1/2 cup or so with a few wood chips in it as well. and all i can say is WOW. I cooked it about 2 hours. now that is one great recipe.

This was FANTASTIC! The brine did wonders.....I accidentally overcooked it by about 10 degrees, but thanks to the brine it was still nice and juicy. Some reviewers mentioned that it was too salty.....well, the recipe doesn't actually instruct the cook to RINSE the meat after the brine. It just says to pat dry, and if you've never used a brine before you might not know that rinsing is important. Just a tip for people new to brining meat!

Rating: 4
I was told by guests this was the best pork they had ever had. Brining insures juiciness but is not mandatory if you are running short on time. I have made it several times both ways and it still comes out great! I tweaked a few things here and there but nothing that drastic to mention. I would make this again and again, it was outstanding. Who doesn't like bacon wrapped meat anyway?

Rating: 3
This was delicious. I started the oven off hot at 425 and then lowered the temperature to 350 after about 15 minutes. It was a bit salty, might try using less salt in the brine. Watch the timing so that it does not overcook.

This was a great New Year's Eve dinner for us! Only quibble was that the bacon did not crisp up. May need to uncover earlier in the cooking process. We used maple bacon to bring out the flavor of the maple more. The brine really kept it amazingly moist.

Rating: 0
This was spectacular. Anyone who had problems probably did not: A) Start with great meat,know your butcher!! B)Use an accurate meat thermometer, VERY IMPORTANT!!! C) Proper standing time is crucial for moist meat. I brine all chicken, pork, and turkey. All to rave reviews and never a complaint about being too salty. Adjust accordingly if you are on a restricted sodium intake, or prefere low sodium taste. I will say that I always rinse the brined meat, and do not salt it again before roasting, even if the recipe says to. I hand tied two small pork tenderloins together with butchers twine, and had a nice roast about 4 1/2 lbs. Brining does make a difference, although if the loin is tender enough you certainly can get away with not doing it, or time constraints don't allow it. Fabulous recipe!!!!

Rating: 2
Okay recipe, but bacon flavor is too overwhelming. I don't know that the brining really added much. Be careful on baking time. Pork is so lean now that it dries out if cooked as long as the recipe recommends.

I had company over last night and made this recipe with roasted fingerling potatos and carrots. The sauce was drizzled over the prok and the veggies and was delicious. I brined the pork the night before and it turned out moist and tender. It got rave reviews and I will be making this again in the future

I haven't made this yet but I'm planning to make it for our annual Epiphany dinner party in January. It seems to me that the brining is completely unnecessary. Here's what I plan to do: Double or tripple the quantity of the garlic-maple-herb rub, pierce the meat, rub it down with the mixture and refrigerate for 24 hours to marinate. Before cooking wrap the roast in brown sugar bacon (probably half the amount called for) and continue with the instructions but at a reduced cooking temperature -- 300 on my oven's convection roast setting, increasing to 350 for the last 15-20 minutes to crisp the bacon. I will also add some apple cider and cognac or stock and calvados to the sauce, reducing to intensify the flavors and whisk in some butter and perhaps a touch of cream to finish. Sounds excessive but I always splurge when I'm entertaining. Think I'll serve it with roasted fingerlings. I gave it four forks because I think it's going to be great. I can't wait to try it!

Great. The maple and the pork loin really work well together. Like so many others, I skipped the brining. I'll try the brine next time--when I have more time, just to see what it adds. Is there really anything that isn't improved by wrapping in bacon?

I thought this recipe was delicious, however I did alter the roasting time. When the meat reached 130 I basted with the syrup and vinegar combo. I removed the roast at 140 degrees, wrapped in heavy foil and let it rest 30 minutes, the roast was slightly pink in the center and very juicy.

Like judik81, I skipped the brinning. Found Maple Bacon, very sweet and juicy. Will be on the menu for my next dinner party.

I made this for a Sunday dinner for my parents and fiance. It sounded so delicious that I was very excited to make it. It let me down a little bit. It was good, not great. The flavor was good, but despite the brining for 24 hours and cooking for only an hour, it turned out rather dry. I have brined meats and poultry before, and they always came out so incredibly juicy that you have to practically wear a bib. I sauteed some apples with thyme, brown butter, and raisins to accompany the pork, and if you ate the pork and apples together, it was delicious. I guess this just didn't meet my expectations.

This is an excellent recipe. I didn't even wrap the pork loin in bacon and it was still very tender and moist. I cooked for 1 hour at 350 and then finished it off in the pan on a hot BBQ (400 degrees). AWESOME! I'm making this for guests at dinner ASAP.

Absolutely incredible... with a few changes: skipped brining, used maple bacon, used white balsamic vinegar, and doubled the maple syrup (from Quebec, of course!). Absolutely moist, flavorful, and pleasing to the eye. An easy recipe that let's you do other things when roast is in oven, and makes it look like you worked away for hours! Highly recommended!

Very good pork recipe. Used half the bacon called for. Served with brussel sprouts. The sauce for the pork was a wonderful addition with the sprouts. Didn't heat up well the next day, so eat up!

Good, but despite the brining, the pork cooked much faster than I expected and thus was dry. Also, the bacon overwhelmed the relatively subtle flavor of the pork loin. I guess pork loin is not my favorite cut of meat.

Have made this for company three times. Each time to rave reviews. Made it just like recipe each time. It's all about the mixing of the flavors with the sage and the garlic. Substituting rosemary as one reviewer did below would make this an entirely different dish. The brining adds some moisture but also, since you are brining it with the sage,imparts additional subtle flavor to the pork. If you don't care for sage, should probably make a different recipe.

I only had time to soak the pork in brine for 6 hours, but the roast still came out moist. I don't understand why you brush with vinegar towards the end of the cooking process?

This recipe is ridiculously salty! Brining the pork AND roasting it in bacon? Like ingesting a salt lick with a hint of maple syrup. Also, I agree with other reviewers that the bacon overpowers the pork.

Rating: 1
I followed the recipe for brining, however omitted the sage and added fresh rosemary, thyme and chives to the rub after brining. The roast tasted just like bacon! The rub was a waste of time because all the flavors were lost with the bacon wrap. If you want your roast to taste just like bacon, spend the time to make this recipe. If not, don't bother!

I loved this recipe! I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon and the flavor was still fantastic.

Delicious, but I do recommend that you go by temperature rather than the listed cooking times; mine took about 20 minutes longer than the recipe calls for. Still well worth it for a meal that looks and tastes far more complicated than it is to make.

It's tough to come up with a festive recipe that will satisfy children 3-8 and adults with discriminating palates plus a mother who is 87. Well, this is the perfect recipe. The kids thought the bacon and pork were "cool" and the gourmets among us were delighted. Even mother was impressed. Easy and wondeful!

This was FANTASTIC! I didn''t have any maple syrup so I mixed molasses with a little Torani caramel syrup and rum. I also added 1/2 cup of brown sugar to the brine and used dried sage, doubled the amount. I had a pork tenderloin roast so I had to reduce the cooking time. I browned it on top of the stove first to cook the bacon, then roasted it for 20 minutes at 375. We loved it!

All I can say is , fabulous, fabulous, fabulous!! I served this in my cafe for lunch and everyone RAVED about it. The drippings made a great base for a sauce but I added some of the leftover glaze to give it a little kick. Smashed sweet potatoes and steamed asparagus rounded this dish out nicely.

I think this recipe produced a wonderful tasting and variable meat for the entire week. I live alone and I was a little hesitant to make it since the smalles loin that I could find was 4 pounds! However, it reheated even in the microwave very nicely, perserving the texture for the most part with the pan dripping/maple sauce. The bad thing is that in the reheating, the bacon doesn't stay wrapped around the loin. Also, the bacon did not add that much to the dish except for the first day when freshly roasted. An excellent side dish is coriander flavored bulgar after removing the bacon and not putting on so much sauce and adding a of crushed coriander to it. It was surprisingly delicious.

Rating: 3
Overall, I thought this was a good recipe. I was hoping for a stronger maple flavor, but it was certainly tasty and the cooking time was right on. But I don't understand why I was instructed to remove any srings before wrapping. I did this and by the time the loin was done roasting, it had split apart. Was the bacon supposed to hold it together?

I had previously brined some pork and couldn't tell the difference, so I skipped the entire step and this still turned out great. Delicious!

My whole family (including 3 small children) loved this recipe as did my neighbors who I also made it for. I made 2 small loins (from, where else, Trader Joe's) rather than 1 big one. They turned out tender, moist, and delicious. The sage in the rub was perhaps a bit too strong but overall a keeper. Made it with mashed yams (boiled yams, cream, & some goat cheese)...great combo of flavors. Only wish I had a bit more "jus."

My husband and I loved this dish. We thought the flavors were wonderful with the Pork. I found it to be a very easy recipe that did not take long to get in the oven and cooked in the amount of time the recipe indicated. The only change I can say I made was to use a little less salt, 1/4 cup since I was cooking a 3lb pork loin. I also did not add the last Tbspn of syrup to the sauce, since I missed that part and it still tasted wonderul. I am always looking for great easy recipes for pork and this is definitely one.

Rating: 3
I thought this dish was very good. Flavor was wonderful, and I loved the sauce it made with the "jus". The bacon is a very good accompaniment to the pork. Surprisingly good combination. Where this recipe lost a star for me was in the preparation. This took me WAY longer than the recipe said it would..a good 45 minutes extra. It may have been my oven, but I even increased the temperature by 15 degrees, then switched to convection cooking when I saw that I was not making good progress. If not for that, this would have probably earned a 4 fork rating from me.

Thought this dish looked really good, but I found that the brining and all the seasoning masked the flavor of the pork. My husband liked it, though.
