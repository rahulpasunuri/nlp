I was a little disappointed by this recipe. I followed it to a tee, from the Bread dough to the folding part. A great portion of the butter/sugar mix ended in the pan, however, which was not a problem in itself, until the sugar caramelized as it cooled down and became so hard that it was impossible to cut through. The cake in itself was good and close to the taste of the French kouign aman (as a French cook, this brought back nice memories), but I think I would cut down the butter/sugar quantities by 1/3 or 1/2 next time. I also wondered why the bread dough quantities have not been revised by anyone yet to fit the 2/3 of the recipe that you really need (instead of making an extra 1/3 that you have to bake separately and for no other purpose than to have a loaf of bread for breakfast -- how weird...). Here are the quantities you need just for the kouign aman: 1/2 cup water 1 teaspoon yeast 1+1/4 cup flour 1/2 teaspoon salt (same)

I used a SLIGHTLY different dough recipe but apart from that this recipe is delicious. Tasted almost like when I had it in Paris. I did not have too much trouble rolling out the dough, actually got a little overzealous and did 5 or 6 turns. Also baked it for longer than called for.

This is a difficult thing to make and will help in gainning a few pounds but, it will also gain you some praise. I feel that if the 7x4" sugar-butter mixture was placed into the "frig" and chilled to a rolling consistancy, maybe 15-20 minutes, the entire thing would come together much easier. Also, I believe that if you chill it again, for the same time duration, before the third roll, it should have the same benefit. Afterall, that trick is used in making a Croissant. I think I like the dough as well, maybe doubled, for cinnamon rolls.
