Holy cow, this was good. High quality ingredients made this simple sauce crazy delicious! I used local, organic, homemade sausages, really fragrant olive oil, fresh basil instead of dried, herbes de Provence instead of oregano because that's what we had on hand, the heel from a wedge of Parmigiano Reggiano, and omitted the parsley. I recommend making a double batch. I wish I had.

I thought this turned out very well. I did not make the meatballs with it as I figured the sausage was enough. This is a good base for making many different types of pasta dishes. Next time I might use ground beef, make meatballs or make it into a spicier sauce. This one is a keeper that wont get old.

This is the basic spaghetti sauce I've been looking for all these years! I used loose sausage so it "melted" into the sauce and made it meaty and thick. I left out the parsley because I had none and it made no difference. Yum.

With two adults and two small children, a double batch easily covers three to four meals. Instead of simmering the sauce, I throw the sauteed onions, etc in a crockpot with the rest of the ingredients, then put in the (raw) meatballs without browning them, and cook on low for six hours or more. It is easier that way and reduces the amount of fat by quite a bit, while retaining excellent flavor. It freezes very well.

This recipe really is quite easy, fast and you can adapt it in many ways. My partner is vegetarian, so I ommit the sausage. I used fresh basil instead of dried and I add 1/4 cup of red wine, for that special touch. You dont need another Tomato Sauce recipe...this one is the one you're looking for!

Excellent "basic" tomato sauce. I also used ground sausage and added a large glug of red wine and the heel from a wedge of Parmigiano Reggiano.

This is the best sausage sauce (gravy) I have ever made! the couple of changes I made were to use turkey Italian sausage links which I took the casings off and crumbled. I did not use the meatball recipe because I use my late italian grandmothers...howev er my secret ingredient that I put in all of my sauces is at least one short beef rib, just like nanny taught me. It gives it a unique meaty flavor. Thanks for sharing this recipe and coincidentally my grandmother is from Calabria! guess we are Paisans!

This is the best sauce I have ever made. I chopped up the sausage, added ground beef, used onion powder instead of whole onion. I made double the sauce and froze the extra in zip locks... The sauce withstands its flavor.. Its incredible. My fiancee and his children love it and can't wait to have it.

I recently moved to Israel and I have been unable to procure many ingredients for my favorite recipes(try finding decent pork in a Jewish country sometime). So a note: for those of you unable to obtain spicy Italian pork sausage, the following substition works just as well: Add an ample amount of crushed red pepper, some whole fennel seeds, a little extra garlic, and the same weight of meat, either ground or in sausage form. It literally tastes the same and gives you greater flexibility.

I have made this many times, and it is really delicious. The meatballs that go with this recipe are also tender and very flavorful. Highly recommend this recipe.

Easy and delicious!. Good weeknight meal. I only used a tablespoon of oil and added a couple extra sausages. My son's new favorite!

Fabulous! This was great sauce! I used half regular and half hot Italian sausage - and crumbled it. I also added mushrooms. Next time I will add a tiny bit less onion and leave out half the oil as the sausage adds a lot on its own.

The best we've had. I can't imagine using another recipe. It was easy and most ingredients were in my pantry. The spicy sausage was wonderful and we had plenty left to freeze.

I made the recipe as written, but took the sausage casing off and crumbled the meat. Also, used a bit more crushed tomato with puree. Served with Mary's meatball recipe. My husband gave it four forks and said it was even better the next day!

An excellent gravy recipe. I added about 1/2 cup each of chopped carrot and celery. Also removed casings from the sausage and crumbled as they were sauteeing. Added about a cup of red wine. This recipe is easy, delicious and fast. What more can you ask for?

I eliminated the sausage as I was adding meatballs and wanted to lower the fat. Even as a vegetarian sauce, this was very good. With the meatballs, it was fantastic -- and very fast.

Great - i could never master a good gravy and this does it for me (and everyone i've served). Only change that i made was to break up the meat.

This is one of the best sausage recipes I have tried. I reduced the amount of olive oil by half, and that was still too much, I threw in a couple of extra sausages, because it's a lot of sauce, I also crushed my own tomatoes, all I had was whole and I would recommend using san marzano tomatoes if you can get them, and lastly I used ground thyme instead of the oregano. Delicious.

Good stuff! I dumped everything in the crock pot and cooked it on low for 10 hours or so and it was excellent. The flavors really come out with linguine or spaghetti.

I'm not big on tomato sauces (too watery, banal, overused), but this stuff is thick and good.

This dish was fantastic. I used the mild Italian sausage instead of the hot and my wife and grandchildren cleaned their plates. It is easy to make and the kitchen smelled divine. I let the sauce simmer for some time after I cut up the sausage and I deglazed the meatball pan and added that as well. Excellent!

Really easy and delicious. I use hot and sweet Italian sauage and slice the sausage ahead of time (works if you have a good sharp knife). I use less olive oil and add a healthy dose of crushed red pepper. I also double the entire recipe so I can freeze some - makes an easy weeknight meal with fancy fresh or just plain dry pasta. Almost better than my Italian mother's!

Easy, Simple and Delicious. What more can I say! Let it simmer for at least 2 - 3 hours to bring the flavors together. I agreed with the cook from England and added some ground beef and tomato paste. This freezes well, too. ENJOY!!!!

I doubled this recipe for a group of 10 and cooked it in the crock pot. It was so easy and delicious. I tried slicing the sausages ahead of time but they just squished under my knife. It was much easier after they were cooked. I served it with penne, a greek salad and garlic bread. I will make this sauce often.

This is the traditional sauce that I like with everything. I also like to add roasted red peppers to the sauce they add some lovely contrast

This is almost the same recipe I grew up on and have made millions of times. The only difference I do is to add 1 1/2 pd ground beef, decase the sausages and add a small can of tomato puree. I've converted my husband's English family to it instead of their instant spaghetti sauce, where they throw all the ingredients together, warm it and serve. I cook mine for two + hours and they wonder why it tastes different than theirs.

I have made this yummy sauce several times and have made a few modifications that makes it the *perfect* sauce for getting rave reviews ... I use sweet italian sausage instead, and slice it before cooking. I also add sliced mushrooms as the onions saute, then deglaze with some italian-style red wine (any good excuse to open a bottle!). I also add a full 2 cans of crushed tomatoes plus a small can of diced tomatoes and a small can of tomato puree. Perfect if you have time to let it simmer longer and let the flavors meld. Finally, I throw in some fresh basil, a couple extra garlic cloves and a healthy amount of crushed red pepper. Goes really well with the meatballs (for which I use a combo of sirloin, pork and veal) and french bread, sliced and baked with a combination of butter, minced garlic, chopped italian parsley, course salt, crushed red pepper and parmesean cheese baked on top. Enjoy!

I am an Italian American, and this is pretty close to the way my family makes this dish. I have learned that frying the meat isn't really necessary...you can just as easily put it in the simmering sauce. I usually add red wine to the sauce and serve it with cheese raviolis

I was not a fan of spicy Italian sausage until I tried this recipe. This sauce is fabulous, and the sausage is unbelievably good. I made it just as the recipe said and sliced the sausages at the end. I have made it before with the accompanying meatball recipe, but you really don't need the meatballs, the sausage is enough. Delicious!

I have made this dozens of times with rave reviews each and every time. Sometimes I remove the sausage from the casing and sometimes leave them whole (pierced w/fork). Both ways work well. I elimimate the oregano and bay leaves and use fresh parsley and basil. Also, if you only have whole canned tomatoes, you can puree them in the food processor or blender and still get great results.

Tasted great but next time I will use half the olive oil. Browning the sausage creates enough oil in itself. Found at the end I needed to skim off some oil in the sauce.

My sister and I have been looking for a sauce that was like our late grandmother's and I think this is it. In fact, Mary Gareffa is from the same little town in Italy as our grandmother and is approximately the same age! I'm going to try and contact her. She may even be related. Weird, huh?

Great sauce-the only thing I changed was to add a green pepper with the onion. I have made it with and without meatballs and love it both ways.

This is a very good recipe, but the percentage of sauce to sausage is too low. As written, I would use 1/2 lb. The second time I used 1 lb. hot italian sausage and doubled the rest of the sauce ingredients. This is a better balance for us for all the meat. It is yummy.

I've made the same family-favorite spaghetti sauce and meat balls for over 40 years, and my picky husband, who loves Italian food, says this is "different but just as good" -from him a four-star review. I used spicy turkey sausage, which was fine, and feel the sausage makes the meatballs extraneous. For the half can of tomatoes I substituted a small can of diced tomatoes and about 1 Tbs. of tomato paste. Great! I might try slicing sausage from beginning.

The sauce is good. Adjust for seasoning at the end. Some sausages are made with more salt than others. If you are not careful you could over salt the sauce.

I have been looking for a recipe like this one since 1964, I use to work at "The Brewery" in Corning NY, and they made the best spaghitti sauce and would serve 2 meatballs and 1 large spicy saugage with the meal and this matches it almost to a tee.

I looked this up under the spaghetti and meatball recipe. I'm a transplanted New Yorker and like Joel, sauce is called gravy. The Basuino family gravy has sausage cut into 2-3 inch strips and simmered in a dutch oven in water (just enough to go 1/4 to 1/2 the height of the sausage) for about 20 min. (the water is usually evaporated at this point) Then remove and add the onions, garlic and even green peppers. Imported canned tomatoes are better if you can find them and my aunt adds tomatoe sauce and paste. My other aunt often used a big bone (ie: lamb) as the base meat. Return everything to the pan and let it cook a long time, use a splatter sheild for thicker sauce and add red wine the last half hour. I double the recipe and freeze half.

My family loves Italian food, and have longed for an old family recipe for a rich delicious sauce. This was great and easy. I used both sweet and hot Italian sausage, and they blended well together. This sauce would stand well on its own, but with the meatballs in the companion recipe it was out of this world.

Rating: 4
Excellent and simple sauce that I made as part of the Classic Spaghetti & Meatball recipe. I would suggest using this sauce without the meatballs as it holds a rich, meaty taste all by itself. I always add a tablespoon of honey to any tomato sauce, especially when it comes from a can.
