I agree that the tuna should be cut to about 1` inch. Do not over cook. I rated it a 2 because I overcooked it a bit, but that was not the fault of the receipe.

VERY disappointing! The mayonnaise had a very unpleasant taste, yet managed to be bland at the same time. I tried doctoring the mayonnaise with hot sauce, garlic, and even dill, but nothing helped. Don't waste good tuna on this one!

Get the tuna in thinner hunks if you can or cut the standard cut in half. Best grilled! Just needed something to add some flavor. Some louisiana hot sauce was the trick.
