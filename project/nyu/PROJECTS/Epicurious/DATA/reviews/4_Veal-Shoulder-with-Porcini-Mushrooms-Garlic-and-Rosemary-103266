Question, I would like to make this for my Seder but how do you grind the dried porcini without washing off the dirt, are you supposed to soak and then grind wet mushrooms? That sounds like a mess and wouldn't make the mushroom powder that this recipe calls for. I have this question every time ground porcini mushrooms are required. Thanks

this is a richly flavored dish - quite delicious. because it so intensely flavored, i would use something less expensive; no one could tell that it was veal. next time - pork or beef.

Getting ready to make it again for Easter this year. The flavors are bold enough for the adults, but subtle enough for the children. Serves nicely with Potatoes Lyonaise or roasted potatoes and whatever fresh green vegetable looks best at the market. Sounds like there are a lot of steps, but it is fast and easy to do the day before.

I agree with many other reviewers. I have made this for 3 Seder dinners and it has been a hit. The recipe requires work but nothing difficult and the ability to make ahead more than compensates. Although this can be prepared at any time of year ithe family looks forward to it.

Very pleased with the results of this recipe, but a few refinements might help. Agree that the garlic is a tad too much...cut back to 5-6 cloves and the dish will have better balance. There seeemed to be a city-wide thyme shortage when I made this, so I substituted tarragon and liked the results. Finally, as the sauce gets boiled down at the end, don't adjust the seasonings til after that...mine was a little saltier than I'd have liked, so be careful w/the salt esp .. can always add...hard to take away.

Made this as one of the entrees for our Seder, and it was a big hit. An added plus is preparing ahead of time-not only a huge time saver, but the extra day or two allows the flavors to meld nicely. Didn't use the bones, and still tasty and delicious, especially served w/ garlic mashed potatoes. A definite keeper!

This was delicious and surprisingly easy. I did it all in advance, and then stuck the finished dish in the oven when my guests arrived. One aspect I did not love was the garlic-herb stuffing; the garlic was a bit overpowering and took away from the porcini flavor. Next time, I'll stuff it with some of the porcini powder instead.

Superb flavour. I have made it a few times now. Never fail. Make sure you use the porcini mushrooms.

Agree with other reviwers. An excellent holiday dish. make ahead and grat for company. Like others this has become our Seder standard. Agree that any bone with meat on it is a good substitute. Happy holiday!

The whole family loved it. Although it isn't the easiest of recipes it is one of the best veal roasts I've had. The advantage is that you will be making it at least one day in advance so on the day of the holiday you don't do anything but put it back in the oven to heat.

This was a fabulous hit at a dinner party with a lot of foodies. The best part is that although it takes some work, and mess, the big part of the cleanup is the day before. Plus, the guests could appreciate (tho' not see) the effort.

I could not agree more with the previous reviewer. "Mysonvaughn" submitted the same response to another recipe and it immediately generated 19 comments. So, out of curiosity, I conducted a recipe search using the keyword "veal" and discovered that mysonvaughn had submitted the same review to ten of the 211 results, stopping at this one probably only because a complaint was made to epicurious.com. I am submitting mine as well and listing four forks to compensate for the negative review. Let's hope that's the end of it. I'm tired of political activists ruining an otherwise pleasurable experience -- and I'm sure that others like me are not helping the situation.

This is an inappropriate use for whatever political views one has. I have complained to epicurious.com. I haven't made this recipe yet but I compensated for the one fork by using four forks for my comment. Everyone is entitled to his or her opinions but this is not the place to air them.

I have served this dish to 25 Seder guests for the last three years---everyone loves it and making it ahead is a huge help.

This was the best dish I have ever made, everyone loved it. Used Osso Bucco and added sauted mushrooms as suggested. Did not have purchase tied roast so we were able to spread garlic mixture in center and tie roast. Worth the effort!

We made this dish for passover, and it was a big hit. Because of family preferences, we served the meat from the neck bones as well, and they were remarkably tender.

I really was not impressed with this dish. It tasted too much like pot roast. It needed more of the garlic/rosemary mixture, but even then I would not say it is worth it. Nothing exciting.

Everyone but me loved this dish. I just felt it didn't have enough zing. The key is to make sure you reduce the sauce enough so it has a real strong flavor. It intensified and became more earthy mushroomy.once reduced. I added some sauted baby bell mushrooms in the end, and everyone agreed they were a must.

An outstanding company dish. I accompanied this with rissotto and baby artichokes . Dessert was oranges stuffed with orange ice cream (Frozen oj conentrate mixed with softened vanilla ice cream then frozen) The beauty of this delicious roast is making it up to two days ahead of time !!

Fairly easy and great to make for company since you can make it all the day before and just heat it through rather then have to fuss in the kitchen.

This is the best veal roast dish we have ever eaten, bar none. In fact, I made it for a Passover Sedar and it is now required eating at all future Sedars. The sauce with the mushroom taste was just excellent. My butcher didn't have veal neck bones so I substituted a single Osso Bucco slice about an inch or so think and it worked fine. This was a great dish.
