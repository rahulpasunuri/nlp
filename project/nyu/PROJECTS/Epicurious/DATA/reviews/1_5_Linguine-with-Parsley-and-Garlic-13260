Wow. What a big snore this one turned out to be. So many promising ingredients and so little result. Takes waaay to long for what you get. Adding garlic sauteed shrimp did nothing to help. Just wasted perfectly good shrimp.

Very bland, uninteresting. Not worth the effort.

I would put olive oil in the pan. saute the garlic and add a little butter to the sauce and some parmigiano cheese

Novice cooks beware! When I added the red pepper flakes and wine to the hot oil, the contents of the pan exploded in my face and filled the kitchen with a red-pepper haze that sent my husband, my six-month-old, and me into coughing fits. Maybe I should have heated the wine first? I tossed the pasta with (fresh) oil, wine, the parsely, pepper flakes, and parmesan, and it was just fine.

I just assumed the quantity of parsley was a misprint. The 1/2 cup works fine.

This is one of my favorites, a simple variation on pasta with garlic that's easy to make.

I made this for my boyfriend and we took 5 bites total before throwing this dish away and making something else. The parsley is VERY overpowering. I would never make this dish again.
