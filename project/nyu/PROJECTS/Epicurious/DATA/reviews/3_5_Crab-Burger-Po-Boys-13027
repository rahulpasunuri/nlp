These were phenomenal. I used panko bread crumbs to coat the outside. This made 3 large crab cakes and I served one each on a round roll with lettuce and tomato. The sauce is so easy to make and goes well with the crab. So good!

Yummy! I was looking for something to do with extra crab I had on hand and decided to make these. They were wonderful and I'll definitely make again. I didn't put them in a sandwich, but just ate the cakes. They were super rich; I might even just serve with a cocktail sauce another time.

We used (PF)puff pastry sheets brushed with egg butter. This made our crusts golden and crisp and Calzona's were poustanding These ingredients are classics. Together the amass more then alone. With some good wine and a green salad a week end dinner to be sure. Thanks for the great posting by Epicurious.com note: 1 box (2 sheets) makes 53 puffs.

I followed this recipe using fresh Dungeness crab meat and Panko bread crumbs but it was way too crumbly. I couldn't get a patty larger than 2 inches wide. It was delicious but because it was so impossible to form a decent sized patty, I'm not going to make this again.

delicious! I used panko for the bread crumbs and it worked wonderfully.I toasted some wheat buns and placed the burger on it with creole mayo or sauce and coleslaw. UMMMMMMMMMm.

These are the best crab cakes I've ever had! I just made the crab cakes, no sandwich, and they were great. Very moist, very tasty! The sauce/dressing isn't even necessary. Definitely a recipe to double/triple!

My wife and I made this for dinner and it was absolutely scrumptious. We should have doubled the recipe because I wanted to have more. There was extra dressing left over.

I couldn't believe how great this dish was! Now I'm simply talking about the 'crab cakes' portion, as I'd like to call it. Usually, I am against using crab meat in a can, but the ingredients used in combo with the crab simply masked the fact that fresh boiled crabs weren't used. I know this is a super recipe because my mom, the hardest to please cook of all cooks, raved about it. And please note, I am from the land of seafood, New Orleans, so please don't take my review lightly!!
