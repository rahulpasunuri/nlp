naughtydogcafe; Because of the oil mixed with the chocolate, the coating stays soft enough to eat easily.

Simple, delicious, and fun to make. People will think you spent more time on it than you actually did! Didn't have cherry ice cream so used Ben and Jerry's Cherry Garcia and the extra chocolate was helpful! *Make sure you don't use an organic white chocolate (such as Green and Black's organic) because it won't melt right in the microwave!*

This isn't a review, so please excuse me--I just can't help but say that that is the sexiest picture of ice cream that I have ever seen. Hats off to you, Mr. Toma.

Since you've got the melted chocolate thing going on already, you might want to drip some into the bottom of the cone before putting in the ice cream - keeps it from leaking, and it's a nice surprise!

Not a review, but a question - wouldn't these be awfully hard to eat once the chocolate hardened up in the freezer? They look fabulous and delicious!

The cherry ice cream really adds something. It makes it kind of like Ben and Jerry's Cherry Garcia Ice Cream, but really impressive, just because it's so good!

This is a show stopper. Super easy! Kids and adults love it. Used strawberry ice cream as cherry was not available. Would be yummy with any flavor. Impress your friends!
