Very simple and tasty recipe. Made it for my parents and they loved it! Although I used instead of 2kg clams, about 250gr mussels, 500gr clams and 250gr shrimps. Definately will try it again for myself sometime or for my girlfriend. Simple and Tasty as I said previously!

You can use clams, mussels, shrimp or lobster or all of these. But the important thing is to boil all the shells for a little while and use this broth as a base.

I used cherry stone clams, scrub them, boil them in 3 cups of water. Take them out of the shell, (caution HOT!) coarsely cut up the clams. RETURN the shells to the water and boil 5 - 10 minutes. Discard shells but RESERVE this broth. In another deep pan, I use Olive Oil, red pepper, 2-3 garlic cloves coarsely chopped, white wine. Add 1-2 cups of the reserved clam broth and reduce at little. Add the undercooked pasta and parsley to pan and if needed, add more clam broth. I use no salt, but the broth, and/or grated cheese adds enough salinity. Sometimes I add asparagus when I make the sauce. Adds color and veggies to the mix. Generally, this recipe is better than ANY italian restaurant, NY or in Italy. It's hard to mess up this recipe. Always comes out excellent.

For my birthday, my best friend sent me a package of Italian cook books and threw in the May Italian Edition of Bon Appetit. This recipe was in the magazine and I made it that same week. The results? Fantastic! It was easy, elegant, and delicious. I just loved it so much that I posted it on my personal blog for my family and friends to try. Definitely a winner! http://lowfatchick.com/2011/08/06/spaghe tti-alle-vongole/

Amazingly tasty for such a simple recipe. My clams were super fresh and perhaps that is why the dish was a little salty (and I love salt). I will boil the pasta with barely salted water next time.

Doubled the recipe and added 4 anchovy filets I had left over from a caesar salad. It was rally tasty. Can't wait to make it again.

This is one of the tastiest dishes I've ever made. I found the recipe made plenty for two people. I finished this with olive oil and grated parmesan, and it rivals the dishes at my favorite Italian place.

Very delicious but I would double for someone with a large appetite. It turned out better than a dish from one of my favorite restaurants in Little Italy

I really liked this and thought it was easy, tasty and attractive. My only problem was that the clams ( I used Little Necks) were VERY salty. Is there a method I should have used that would have reduced the saltiness? Maybe soaking the clams in fresh water? Hopefully someone can help because I would definitely like to make this again.

This is an easy, tasty weekday meal. I did add a bit of cream and butter to the sauce (because, really, what doesn't improve with a little cream and butter?) and then sprinkled the finished dish with crumbled bacon. Served with a warm bagquette for soaking up all the yummy sauce.
