I made this for a Fourth of July BBQ. It got RAVE reviews. I substituted Turkey Sausage for the ham, and Great Northern Beans for the butter beans. It had a delightful flavor! At least 5 people asked me for the recipe.

Ugh. Something must be wrong with my taste buds, because I thought these beans were terrible. I served them at a BBQ last weekend. The adults seemed to like them (although no one asked for seconds) but the kids thought they tasted "weird". I'm with the kids. Maybe it was the curry that didn't work for me. Or maybe I am weird myself, seeing as everyone else on this sight seemed to like these beans.

Excellent! Very hearty, and great for a winter day! I followed earlier reviewers' advice to saute the onions first and it definitely makes a difference.

Love, love, love this recipe!!! Made it for the first time last year for a BBQ and the host ran all over the party feeding it to everyone. This is my favorite recipe to take to a summer time event. The curry and soda give it a really unique flavor. I also add andouille and it really takes it up a notch.

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a big hit. Last night I served it with fajitas and it made the whole meal more entertaining. I concur with others that sautéing the onion first brings out better flavors. Also, almost any four cans of beans will work. I have used whatever is on the shelf more than once with rave reviews each time.

Excellent! Sincel, easy, tasty, hearty. Great for after skiing!

Very good and very easy. I made a few modifications as suggested by other reviewers. I first sauted (sp?) the onions and peppers together, then added the liquids, sugar and spices and let it boil for about 10 min. before throwing in the beans and meat (I also used anduille (sp?) sausage instead of ham.) I then let the mixture simmer for about 10 min. and stuck it in the warming oven for a couple of hours. This part was unintentional; our ribs took forever to cook! By the time we were ready to eat all the excess liquid had been soaked up. Very good flavor! My husband, who normally doesn't like beans, thought they were great!

These beans are terrific but I did make a few changes. The first time I make them they were too soupy. So, the next time I mixed all of the ingredients together EXCEPT the beans and boiled them and reduced it until thickened. Added the beans and let it cool. Reheated it just before serving. No soup! No Mush!

This gets four forks for being an incredibly flavorful bean side dish. I used previous reviewers suggestions, substituting the ham for andouille chicken sausage, halved the sugar but only used 1/2 cup of root beer and no other soda. It cooked up to a nice texture within 15 minutes.

The dish tasted great--wouldn't change anything there--but it turned out like chili, not like traditional beans. The consistency was very disappointing. I let them simmer for almost 45 minutes and it was still too soupy.

These beans were very good. I used the Andouille sausage as well. They were very spicy. Next time, I'll omit the cayenne pepper. Everyone enjoyed them.

A husband pleaser. Will make again and again.

Added the Andoulie and also cooked for an hour or more. Was absolutely fantastic. Everyone was coming back for thirds and fourths.

So easy and sooooo delicious....Can't go wrong with this one for your barbeque.

Will be a staple at every barbeque, Kansas City BBQers rate it the best!

WOW. We kicked it up a bit by using andoulille sausage rather than the ham. We also grilled the peppers, onions and andouille before adding to the rest of the ingredients. Agreed with other reviewers needs to cook at very low heat for at least 1hr. Served with Cheddar Burger with Chipotle Ketchup and NC Coldslaw (July'08). The heat and sweetness of the beans was slaked by the cool crispness of the coldslaw,excellent combination! Topped off with Nectarine Raspberry Crisp with Spiced-Oatmeal Crumb Topping (July '08). Wonderful summertime meal.

Fantastic! I've made these beans for the last two summers on our beach vacation and now is expected every year.

I give these sweet, interesting beans the elusive 4 forks. The dish was beautiful, fragrant, delicious, simple, and unique! And even better on day 2! The next time I need an informal take-along I will make this and soak up all the praise.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I sauteed the ham and the onion, pepper with a clove of garlic before adding 1 can pinto, 1 can great northern, 1 can black, and 1 can butter beans. I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. They were still pretty sweet and I might reduce further next time. I also didn't have a red pepper so left it out. Had several ask for recipe at last nights dinner. Very colorful.

I made this last year and it was wonderful! I lost the receipe and now I am so glad to have found it again. This is a picnic winner.

Very tasty. A bit too "loose" but extra cooking remedied that. 1 hour and 15 minutes did the trick. Here in Texas we like beans cooked a long time anyway. Substituted best quality Root Beer for Cola on second try. Actually liked it better but the original is fine. A keeper

I doubled the recipe for 40 people, used andouille sausage, and did not rinse the pork & beans. I loved the taste, but was hoping it would be thicker (like baked beans). I'll make again for sure, but as soup for football games.

To cook from England -- yes. British baked beans would be fine. I've discovered that this recipe is really versatile -- I didn't add the lemon-lime soda the second time I cooked it and used a different mix of beans AND a little less brown sugar and it was also great. It's a good recipe and freezes well too -- so making a big batch is a good thing.

This had interesting flavor--would be a good dish to take to a potluck or BBQ since it's a little different than your everyday baked beans. Made a LOT, though.

We don't get 'pork n beans' here in England. Would ordinary baked beans and perhaps more ham or bacon do instead?

I'll admit I was reluctant to put together a recipe with soda in it! But the curry and dark brown sugar along with the two peppers make for a sweet, savory and very colorful mix of the beans and veggies. Since we bring a rather large portion of beans on our beach vacation with us-it was quite a departure to choose this recipe over my old standby, but it was worth it to try this new fun one. I substituted the ham called for, for crisp bacon, about 2/3 of a pound. All things considered really good.

These are good -- a little too sweet for my taste, so I'll tone that down a bit next time. I used kielbasa instead of ham (because I had it) and would do the same again. I also used vegetarian baked beans instead of pork n beans (again, because it's what I had) and it was of course fine. Good, versatile recipe. Just a little too sweet to me.

Very good. I made them in my crock pot, and used andouille sausage rather than ham.

This was very tasty. I used half haram masala and half curry powder for our taste preference. It is my husbands new favorite.

These were fabulous. Although part of a full meal, this is the item all the guests raved about. The seasoning and flavor were perfect. The variety of colours and shapes made an attractive presentation. I could not find canned butter beans so used frozen.

This was outstanding - a nice alternative to traditional baked beans. It's also a colorful addition to the table. I couldn't find canned butter beans so substituted Great Northern. Like the previous reviewer, I cooked longer than the recipe called for, approx. 40 min.

I've made this 4 times so far. I don't bother wiht the green bell pepper and I cook it for closer to an hour. EVERYONE loves it.
