This is a wonderful breakfast meal but the recipe has some notable errors. The pudding came out as a sugar mess not a custard or pudding. The ratio of liquid to sugar is off and the amount of vanilla is excessive. They state that the pudding should fill the ramekins 1/4 the way. For eight 8 oz ramekins this would take 16 oz. The recipe has 2 oz in heavy cream and 6 5/8 Tlb in eggs (3 5/16 oz) for a total of 5 5/16 oz of liquid for 1/2 c sugar. There is ~ 10 oz missing. A typical custard is 2 c milk, 4 egg yolks, to 1/3 to 1/2 c sugar and 1 tsp vanilla. The is more in line with volume needed and the consistency I experienced eating at Alice's. Steep the tea in the heavy cream as directed andI then blend the infused cream with 1 1/2 c whole milk. The egg coating for the brioche bread slices works as written. Steeping the 1/4 c heavy cream with a black tea bag and adding 1 - 2 tsp of flavored brandy work well as a short cut if you don't have or want to get the apricot brandy tea.

It was really tasty, but a bit dry. I wonder if the pudding ratio should be doubled or if I should have under-cooked the french toast. I added five strips of roughly chopped bacon which added a really nice complexity to the dish.
