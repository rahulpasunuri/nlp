Nothing special. Held together nicely. Looked very pretty. But the taste... not so much. I'd skip it next time.

This was a lot of work and the turkey was not as flavorful and I would have liked since I let it sit seasoned overnight before cooking it.

WOW! Great flavor! Cutting and flattening the turkey breast was a first for me, kinda tricky. I used less on the cumin as another reviewer suggested. Used some poblano chiles from the garden. Roasting the peppers was a first as well. A bit of a warning when saving leftovers of this dish, the peppers were getting hotter as time passed in the fridge. It can be a bit over powering. Be brave and try something new in your cooking methods. I'll be making this again, maybe with chicken.

Very easy to make but has a big taste and an elegant presentation. Good dinner party dish. I used chicken breasts for individual servings. Very well received.

Wow, what a disappointment after all the rave reviews. I did it exactly as directed. It was dry (and I have a remote digital thermometor and baked it to exactly 160*), the feta was uneventful. It just didn't come together the way I expected and I won't make it again. It did look nice.

This is one of the easiest and tastiest recipies I have been able to find for chicken - and even my husband likes it. Instead of rolling the chicken, I stuff it and close it with skewers. It's simple and tasty and can be made as a weekday recipe.

I was looking for a new way to prepare a turkey breast and tried this recipe. It was easy to put together and tasted great. The fresh oregano was a nice flavor. All the prep work was completed in advance so it made cooking dinner a pleasure.

I paused when I saw how much cumin this dish asks for (I love cumin, but 2 tablespoons??)- but all of the flavours work beautifully together. Don't worry about the amount of oregano either- it's perfect. I would say though that unless you cook meat regularly (I don't!) you should stick to a boneless/skinless just for ease. I didn't end up adding the bones to the dish, and don't see a real need (it might improve it, but not to the point of warranting home-butchering if you're a novice). I also browned my roulades in a pan beforehand for flavour. Worth trying!

This is very tasty but WATCH THE SALT! The feta cheese is already very salty and I would suggest not salting the inside of roll, just some on the outside. It may be a little heavy on the cumin and oregano, too, but that may be my personal taste. This certainly has great potential and I will make it again with less salt. It was tender and juicy and 35 min. was perfect cooking time.

A fabulous dish that everyone likes. I was wary of the cumin/oregano/goat cheese combo, but it worked. I took off the skin, but made it per the recipe otherwise. It's worth it to find poblanos.

My roulade-style dishes don't usually work out very well (swiss melts and runs out of my cordon bleu, goat cheese out from under the skin of chicken breasts) but I guess feta has a higher melting point so this turned out very well, and looked good despite a very fragile turkey breast that was difficult to skewer and tie. Gives great flavor to the turkey breast, which otherwise can be bland.

This was the hit of Thanksgiving. People loved it even more than the regular turkey. I used a very large tukey breast with no skin and no ribs, the meat thermometer wasn't registering it hot enough until I had cooked it for almost 50 minutes. But it still came out moist. I did use fresh poblano peppers (which I found at Super Target), they were very sligthtly hot but even the kids could eat this. I received a cooking "sock" from the butcher to place it in to cook instead of twine. I didn't bother with the sauce - didn't need it. I think I will try with chicken and pork as others have suggested, but the turkey will become a thanksgiving staple.

Very delicious and quite easy. I used a different type of pepper; would make it hotter next time. I totally forgot to make the sauce, but it was still tender and flavorful. Two thumbs up!

This was really tasty and easy to make. couldn't find fresh peppers so I used dried and reconstituted them. Easy.

If I could give this recipe 5 forks I would. This might be the best dish I have ever made. My boyfriend was DROOLING when I gave it to him. The best part is that it is SO EASY! I used chicken breast instead of turkey, and instead of roasting the chillies myself, I just used canned jalepenos. Turned out amazing. I will make this dish over, and over, and over again & you should too!

Fabulous recipe and so easy to make ahead. In fact, I assembled the roulades one night, cooked them and made the sauce the next, and then served them COLD on the third night. I couldn't find the turkey breasts, so I used turkey breast cutlets, which turned out really well for individual servings. Also, while I would have preferred to use fresh oregano, I was stuck using dried and got away with it just fine. The flavors are wonderful together. Definitely take the few extra minutes to make the pan sauce.

I made this with pork tenderloin rather than turkey...I really liked the taste of pork and this worked particularly well with it.

Made one roll for Mother's Day dinner. I took the skin off - didn't want all that grease inside the roll - but stuck it on top of the roll while it cooked to keep it from drying out. Was delicious!!! Will definately make again.
