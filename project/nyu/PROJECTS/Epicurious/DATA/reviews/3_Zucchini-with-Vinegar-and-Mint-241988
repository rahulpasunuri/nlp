OK, I substituted fresh for dried mint. It's not quite "I didn't have fresh mahi mahi so I used two cans of Fancy Feast Fish-Delish", but otherwise I followed the recipe as printed. Give it a try, but consider following the suggestion of another commenter about tossing the veg with the vinegar rather than reducing same. Overall, though, the combination of flavors was hardly felicitous. I'm sure there's something worthwhile in this, but it wasn't obvious to me.

A bit oily, as one of the other reviewers stated, but balanced by the vinegar if you do not let it reduce till evaporated. Fresh mint is what I had and what I used -- about 3 times the amount of dried that the recipe specified.

Very tasty, a little on the oily side though. Be sure not to overcook the zucchini, mine was a little mushy. Simple and good flavor overall.

The way I make it... cook the zucchini in olive oil until it is cooked down and is very browned. When it is still warm, toss it with balsamic vinegar (less than 1/4 cup) and FRESH mint, a generous amount. A little sprinke of salt and pepper. I sometimes also roast grape tomatoes with some olive oil and S&P and toss with the zucchini. Put on top of sliced semolina bread. Fresh mozzarella on the side... Fantastic! make sure to cook all the way down.

This is actually a recipe from the south of Italy. The difference is that the vinegar and mint (lots of both) is added to the zucchini plate once it has all been cooked - it's all tossed together. There is also no butter and you eat it with crusty bread as the vinegar is powerful, yet so goooood!

easy & simple. good taste. the zucchini exude a lot of liquid so i ended up overcooking them slightly waiting for the vinegar to "evaporate". don't wait that long.
