I won the Oscar for best appetizer at an Oscar party with this recipe. I followed the instructions. The only change was that I mixed all of the ingredients together and then spread them on the phyllo. Delicious.

These are great. I wrap the filling up in triangles (like for the spinach- feta Greek appetizer) makes it easy for guests to eat. I also toss in some toasted pecans which taste great with the date and cheese- always a hit and can be made ahead and frozen too.

This is always a hit, have made it 10 to 15 times since it was published 15 years ago (yikes..how time flies)...if you don't like things too sweet, reduce the dates, but I like it just as is!!

I so badly wanted to love this recipe, and I just can't... nor did the party-goers at the New Year's Eve shindig I made it for. Made it in the proportions given-- changes included putting it in mini phyllo cups, chopping the dates a bit smaller so they'd fit better in said mini phyllo cups, and omitting sesame seeds, which I now wish I had not. I don't think they would have entirely saved this recipe from its rather overbearing sweetness, but they would have added an extra layer of interest. Really, the comment I heard most was that it was simply too sweet, and I have to agree. I may actually try this recipe again, because it's full of things I just love, but I'd make some major changes. I think I'd use about half the dates and make up the bulk with a little more goat cheese and some toasted, chopped walnuts. In addition, I think I might replace the scallion with shallot. Might also try the idea from South Haven, MI about the balsamic vinegar reduction. This recipe needs that kind of punch.

I made these as twists rather than strudels. Worked really well and were a hit at the party I took them to.

About to make this for the first time tomorrow. I'm going to try the triangles as it looks easier. Does it mean that I should use 3 layers at the bottom and another 3 to cover on the top? Can I cut it into shapes before cooking? How do I use a towel to help me as I could not find anthing about it?

These disappeared within moments at a dinner party and one by one enthusiastic guests appeared in the kitchen asking "what were those wonderful phyllo appetizers?" I had to substitute crushed pecans for the sesame seeds and chives for the scallions, and mixed all ingredients but the pecans together before assembling. I made one using three phyllo sheets and one with four and they rolled equally well (a quick and light touch is essential in assembling) and made a beautiful presentation. They were a huge hit and I will definitely make them again!

I make these frequently for parties I cater, always with rave reviews. I omit the sesame seeds, add a good grind or two of black pepper, and make individual traingles instead of the more unweildy strudel. They freeze beautifully. Great to have on hand during the holidays when people drop in.

I've made it both as strudels and served it to a small gathering or as small triangular bites. Every time I get reviews. When I make it as a strudel I put the sesame seeds with the butter they adhere to the phyllo much better.

In spite of my vow to avoid phyllo at all costs, I thought this was very good. I mixed all the filling ingredients together before placing atop the phyllo and served the slices with a basalmic vinegar reduction. Next time I will skip the sesame seeds and add some toasted, chopped pecans to the mixture.

This recipe is far too sweet for an appetizer and too fragile to be a finger food. Thank goodness I didn't wait until Christmas Eve to make this very disappointing recipe. This is an instance were the sum total is not as good as the individual parts. Putting this together is not hard, but the outcome isn't worth even that little bit of effort. If I had been served this at a restaurant it would have gone back to the chef. Search for a different recipe.

I made these last night. Instead of "strudel style", I made individual, triangular "packages". Much neater to serve, and more manageable for guests. Everyone loved the interesting combo of flavors.

Made this for a party this year,and they went FAST!!! Will make again per several requests.

I agree with all the other cooks who love this recipe. I make it exactly like it says, and it is wonderful every time. I do get frustrated, though, when I bring home a supposedly fresh box of frozen phyllo and the leaves flake away like they have been thawed out and re-frozen. But that's a supermarket issue, isn't it?

This is a fabulous recipe! Last time I made it with fake bacon and it was still delicious. Here's a huge time saving idea: skip the phyllo hassle and just spoon the mixture into little, ready phyllo cups. Talk about easy!

Really terrific and different. I used mini-muffin tins to make bite-size portions for an al fresco dinner in the park. The phyllo was a little tricky to work with, but they turned out delicious (if not too pretty).

My guests were blown away by this recipe. A few suggestions. First, if you're going to make them on day one but serve on day two, rather than cook on day one and reheat on day two, it's fine to simply wrap them in plastic wrap, refrigerate and then cook for the first time on day two. Second, use at least two but not more than three layers (with butter brushed between them) for the first layer in the recipe. This gives them more strength and keeps them from falling apart if the first layer flakes when you cut the strudel after cooking. Finally, start with dates that are pre-chopped when you buy them, and then further chop them in the food processor. Guaranteed that you and your guests will flip for this recipe.

I LOVE this recipe. I have made so many off this site and this is one of the best, bar none. I tripled it for a dinner party and everyone devoured them. Make them and you won't regret it. Also, follow other readers' suggestions on the damp towel.

Fabulous!!! Next time I make it I would add another sheet of phyllo to help hold it together and I would cut the dates into smaller pieces. Everyone asked for the recipe!A real keeper!

Very good recipe...one tip...instead of using 3 sheets of phyllo to make the strudel, use 4. This way the strudel will hold together better. Also, phyllo is kinda a pain to work with...the trick is to be patient, follow all directions and above all, don't let the phyllo dry out (the wet towel is a MUST)!

A big hit! I've made this several times. People are skeptical when you tell them what's in it, but once they take a bite they're hooked! As one other review mentioned, it's messy when you slice it. I think next time I make it I'm going to make individual phyllo triangles - like spannikopita - and see if that helps.

Delicious - easy - great that you can make a day ahead - a hit at my gourmet club...different flavors that blend together beautifully...a keeper!

Delicious! Though I must offer a word of caution to those who have never before worked with phyllo pastry--it's a real pain in the rear if you don't follow the instructions to a "T". Phyllo dries out quickly so I wouldn't recommend this for the leisurely cook... but YUM YUM!

I made this strudel for a progressive dinner. Not one piece was left on the plate. I would make it again as it was such a hit. The only problem I had was the phyllo dough flaked a lot , leaving only a minimal layer to hold the filling. However, this did not deter guests from eating it!

This was phenomenal!! I have made many recipes from this web site but this was the first one that inspired me enough to come back and rate it. It was one of those recipes that I thought could be really blah or a real winner--made it for a cocktail party and it was a hit. It was just the right combination of sweet/salty/creamy. I used Oscar Meyer low sodium bacon because I grabbed it by mistake, but it came out fine. I also added about 1-2 tsp. minced shallot because I didn't have quite enough scallion.

I made this for a dinner party and it was great. worth the extra effort to make.

I have made this several times for parties and it has always been the big hit! Everyone just raves. I did find, however, that the dish is best served and presented at room temp rather than warm. At room temp, the strudel pieces hold their shape better and the goat cheese isn't as messy.

I would use less dates and more bacon next time. The dates made it very sweet. I also substituted pinoli nuts since i didn't have any sesame seeds on hand. They were a good substitute.
