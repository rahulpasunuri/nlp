I used this dressing on a completely different salad because I was looking for something interesting and different. It was really delicious! My salad was pan seared salmon (with some of the fennel oil) with oranges, radish and a mix of baby greens. The orange and fennel were great together.

I really liked this and so did my guests! Brightly flavored dressing with some deep flavor provided by the toasted fennel seeds.

This salad is refreshing and light but with a really interesting flavor from the toasted fennel seed.
