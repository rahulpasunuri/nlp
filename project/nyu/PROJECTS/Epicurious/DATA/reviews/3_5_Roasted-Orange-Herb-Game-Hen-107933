Delicious, but the sauce didn't really work out for us. More of a broth and it didn't add much.

I really have to laugh--and wonder-- about people that write such a terrible critique for a recipe that most everyone enjoyed. I know--all tastebuds are different! We LOVED this recipe! It was easy (had the butcher cut the hens in 1/2), did not add the chicken broth, but basted with the juices from the hens as suggested by others. Skin was crispy. Everyone was impressed with the presentation (hens over a mound of wild rice) & the recipe. Easy & sooo good!

Wow, this was terrible! Followed the recipe to the "T", and bland and boring. I would definitely pass on this one..

I chose not to add the broth & basted with the juices in the pan. Crispy skin & loved by everyone.

I used rosemary, thyme, mint, parsley and garlic. Made a paste with olive oil and sea salt to rub under the skin. I also used lemon instead of orange peel. It was absolutely amazing!

This is one of our favorite dishes. Our favorite combination is rosemary and mint with the orange gratings under the skin with the herbs. Rub the skin with plain butter and baste as directed. I usually serve with sweet potatoes and asparagus and bread in some form.

I made this for Valentine's Day dinner. Based on the comments that the herb/shallot mixture did not taste "cooked" when made as directied, I sauteed the thyme, parsley, orange zest and shallot mixture in a bit of butter just until the shallots began to soften. I let this cool and used it as a rub on the hens. While the hens were tasty, my family agreed that there was not enough meat to make them worthwhile. I will try this recipe on a roasting chiken next time at my usual roasting time and temperature.

we made this with the suggested potatoes and a dry white wine. Very tasty and fairly easy and fun to make.

I made this recipe using chicken breasts with skin. (I did the prep work ahead of time.) It was marvelous! Very intriguing taste with the orange zest, fresh parsley and fresh thyme. When I make it again, I'll add more broth + juice, but otherwise, I'll make it as is.

This dish was delicious! I used thyme for the herb and substituted olive oil for the butter - I also used about a half of a teaspoon of seasoning under the breast skin of each cornish game hen half. My entire family loved it and I received many great compliments from several picky eaters!

I made this wonderful dish with mint and cilantro. I also tucked in a small pat of butter with the herbs and locked it all in with a toothpick. Excellent, time consuming and well worth it.

Shallot/herb mixture tasted undercooked under the skin, although there is a chance I used a little more than the recipe called for. This is was just OK- although I would make some adjustments in the ingredients if I made again

Even after roasting, uncooked shallots, herbs and orange peel put under the skin still taste uncooked. The individual ingredients sounded appealing but they just don't come together.

Tasty rub, however I think that the herbs weren't as fresh as they could be when I made this as I tasted mostly orange. I'm definitely trying it again.

This dish was easy to make. After putting all the herbs on the hen, I let it sit for about an hour and then cooked it. It was infused with flavor and very tender. I made sides of the caramelized spiced carrots, creamy mashed potatoes with goat cheese, and a light mushroom cornbread stuffing on the side which all went well together. It turned out great.

This is so simple, yet delicious. This is one of the handfull of recipes i've commited to memory so I can make it anytime/anywhere. It's elegant enough to be impressive, simple enough to let you spend time with your guests/hosts.

This is an excellent dish which is both delicious and a treat for the eyes. The herbs and zest mixture give the chicken a real zing. I will make this often for company.

A delightful way to serve a standard. I had the butcher split the hens with backbone removed (save them for stock!). I used blood oranges for the zest and juice, and a deep golden sherry making the au jus rich in taste and look. Also, I roasted the potatoes separately tossed in grapeseed oil, whole thyme leaves, salt and plenty of fresh ground black pepper. You can't go wrong when plating this dish - it really is pretty.

Fantastic. I find the bigger the game hen the more juicy using that cooking time and temp. If they are very small you may need to decrease the cooking time. This dish makes a great presentation with mashed potatoes and green veggie. Garnish with sliced fresh oranges.

Delicious! I used chicken thighs, but it came out perfect and looked impressive. Served it with wild rice. The guests raved.

This recipe is wonderful with the mix of fresh herbs and citrus flavors-- a perfect blend of flavors for spring. It combined elements of sweet and savory perfectly. I made it with roasted potato puree (this website) and arugula, corn and tomato salad. Delicious.
