Yummy!! Can't wait to combine this with the caesar salad tonight! I did change the recipe up just a touch -- I first brushed the bread slices with a little bit of olive oil and added some kosher salt before putting on the garlic-lemon mixture!! SO good!

Really great homenade croutons and easy, too. The lemon flavor added a lot to these croutons.
