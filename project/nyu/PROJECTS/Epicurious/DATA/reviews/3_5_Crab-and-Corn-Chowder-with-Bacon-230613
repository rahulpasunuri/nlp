Quick and easy weeknight meal, but somewhat bland...if I were to make it again, I would double the bacon and make a roux to thicken it up.

This was awful. I could not even finish eating one bowl. It has such wonderful ingredients I don't know what could have gone wrong.

Gosh, I am surprised at the favorable reviews. This recipe was so disappointing. The potatoes were no where near cooked after 10 minutes. I let them simmer another 5 minutes before adding the crab, but they were still practically raw. There are other really good bacon/corn/potato chowders out there. Crab is a special indulgent treat and it was just wasted in this bland recipe. I tried this the next day (didn't help much) nor did the addition of cayenne and salt.

This is a nice chowder & very easy to make, so it gets forks for flavor as well as week-day ease. I used frozen crab, creamed corn rather than fresh or frozen, and homemade seafood stock rather than clam juice - made for a very rich chowder with more complex flavor than with just clam juice. I would definitely make this again, especially since I'm always looking for ways to use up the crab in my freezer.

As suggested by other Epicurious recipe users, this must be made a day ahead of time. The difference from one day to the next is amazing! I also used a thickening agent because that is the way I like my chowder. I found it to be costly and very time consuming but the end result was quite good. The next time I make this I will use equal parts chicken stock ALONG WITH the clam juice. I also added 1/4 cup of lime juice. The fishy smell was overpowering for me thus the change in ingredients.

This has become our NYE tradition for the past 6 years. Fresh dungeness is a winter treat that every San Franciscan looks forward to. Paired with Presseco and crusty garlic bread, it feels luxurious, but is easy to throw together. I recommend making it at least a day ahead.

The sweetness of crab and corn combine well together. Reserve some of the lump crab, also, to use as a garnish.

This is excellent. I spice it up with some cayenne and always make it a day ahead because it improves tremendously overnight. I like to make it in the summer with very fresh sweet corn. Don't think I would make it with frozen corn.

Delicious soup recipe. This is a "light" broth (not in calories but consistency), however my husband and I do not prefer a "stick to the spoon chowder" so this was a perfect blend of broth, potatoes, fresh corn and crabmeat for us. My only change was to add diced red pepper (1 pepper) about 3 minutes following the saute of the onion. Served with baking soda biscuits to which I added a teaspoon or two of Bay Seasoning and grated cheddar cheese.

I agree w/ cook from Denver--"atsugi" is nuts! The recipes that are listed on this website should be used as a base. If people have other ideas as to what would make a recipe even better, please keep them coming! I thought this chowder was delicious. I also used scallops instead of the crabmeat & used both thyme & rosemary as bingbong72 in Denver did. Then I added some roasted red bell peppers I had left over from a meal the night before which added great flavor! This is a great winter warmer soup!

All I have to say is, what is the deal with "atsugi's" comments from 11/24/07?The whole point of this website is to get ideas from other cooks. I usually never adhere to the exact recipe, so I welcome variations! Sheesh, "atsugi" needs to lighten up a bit!

This was a great recipe. I gave it 3 forks only because after making it the first time, I had to adjust the measurements. Although I can understand about the use of a roux, this recipe didn't call for it. If you cook the soup long enough, the cream will reduce and thicken. After adjusting with salt, i tfelt it needed an acid to round out the soup so I added drops of tabasco in relation to the amount of soup. That did the trick!!!

I have been making this chowder with this recipe for the last 2 years and I love it! My son and friends request it all the time too. I agree you should only give a review if this is the recipe you used,not your variation. Of course I did garnish with cheese,scallions and bacon on top, and it is fabulous!

delicious.....I used crab,chopped clams,imitation lobster........could'nt find any clam juice so i used canned chicken broth........put it in the slow cooker........there were no leftovers

This was fantastic! I substituted the crabmeat for scallops, however. I also didn't have enough thyme so I used 2 TBSP thyme and the other TBSP rosemary, and it still tasted superb! It was a big hit with my husband as well.

THIS WAS GREAT! NEXT TIME HOWEVER, I MIGHT CUT THE HALF AND HALF WITH MILK JUST TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THE CALORIES. OTHERWISE, IT IS PERFECT.

I made this for someone who doesn't like crab, so used small shrimp instead. It came out more chunky soup than chowder, but that didn't stop it being delicious. I highly recommend some fresh biscuits with this.

I made this for a football party. It was a good basic recepie, but I had to adjust it to taste. I substituted whole milk for half of the cream. Next time I will leave all of the bacon bits as a garnish. I didn't enjoy soggy bits. Otherwise it was a good recepie for tinkering with.

I made this soup for our New Years Eve party, and used a crock pot so that I could make it ahead and it would stay warm. It took a lot longer this way, but worked fairly well. I also experimented in making it lower fat by using half and half and skim milk in equal proportions- I wouldn't recommend doing that! The flavor was great but it turned out runny. It was a big hit with all of our guests nevertheless.

It took quite awhile (and a roux of 4 tablespoons each of butter and flour) to achieve the velvety, creamy thickness I like in a chowder. Here in the Chicago area, a pound of good quality crab meat is $24, so I wasn't going to add that until I was sure the end result would be worth it. As for the flavor issues that others noted, I did sautee some chopped celery and carrot with the onion, I also used about half chicken boullion and half clam juice, plus I added a bay leaf to the simmering process. All in all, I'd probably make it again as a tasty corn chowder with bacon, and I'd find another recipe of some kind for the crab meat!

Used rock shrimp instread of crab and used vegetable stock instead of clamb juice. Served as a first course on Thanksgiving to rave reviews. Make 1 day ahead to let flavors mingle. I added in raw cleaned shrimp after I warmed the soup so they wouldn't cook too long and toughen.

Loved it. Simple and quick. All the guests loved it, none left over and requests to make it for the next gathering. Now that I know how well the basic recipe works, I might use some of the other reviewre's suggestions about red pepper for kick, or perhaps some shrimp or even scallops.

I made a double batch, as I was serving it for an early brunch on Thanksgiving day. I doubled the base and the crab, and only used one pound of corn. Like others, I made it the day before, and let the flavors merge a bit more. The reviews that day were unanimous, as were the co-workers who had it the following Monday in the office. I would certainly make it again, and in fact, have already had four requests for the recipe. Next time I may add a touch of red pepper to give a bit of punch, and would not skimp on the cream, it would just not be the same.

Tasted great. I used 1/2 shrimp and 1/2 crab and it tasted great. Must say my lactose intolerance kicked up. Next time I'll remember to take a pill. Can't wait to try it again

This was delicious! The only thing I did differently was to make it the day before and allow the flavors to mix and blend overnight in the fridge. My three guests enjoyed it. There was none left over.

I followed the recipe verbatum and I've got to say that it was a complete waste of perfectly good dungeness crab! I will admit that it was better the second day, and that grated cheese on top helped, but I don't like throwing away expensive ingredients on a so-so dish. It got the same review from 3 of my co-workers who shared in my disappointment. We really did have high hopes...and I'm the chef in the group.

To Cook from Vienna - I wouldn't worry about a few people rating variations, rather than the recipe as written. If you're worried that it "skews" the results of this highly scientific survey, then you lack confidence in your own ability to assess a recipe. Besides, the people who posted their "ratings" might all be a bunch of syphilitic circus mutants.

gwen72 is so right. The review should be about THIS recipe. It is discouraging to see 3 or 4 forks review and then find that the recipe has been added to, changed, substitued,etc. Everyone can change a recipe to their liking, but this forum's remarks should be confined to the recipe as stated.

very bland tasting the first day. next day al ittle better. would not make again

It was flavorful, but lacks the chowder consistency, probably because I used full milk instead of cream. But it tastes good, and was very filling.

I wish to thank those that responded to my question about a corn substitute. My husband has a severe digestive disorder, and eating corn would put him in hospital. I'm new to fine cooking, and your suggestions are so helpful! I wish that I could make the chowder as written. It sounds wonderful! I'm sure I'd give it four forks if I made it as written!

Thank you to the previous reviewer! Before rating a recipe, shouldn't you try it as is and make your desired changes the next time around? I made this for lunch today and found it quite tasty. Will I make a few tweaks next time? Of course but well worth trying "as is".

Rating: 4
Yes, you can do other things with this recipe, but isn't this supposed to be about THIS recipe? I thought it was great, easy, and a repeater. Don't forget, soups, stews and such are better the second day.

To cheekymaid - Try fava beans; or failing that, red lentils. The recipe itself was wonderful, substituting lowfat milk and a slurry of flour and water for the half/half. The recipe also inspired me to make crab, bacon and corn fish cakes - another home run!

Instead of Corn, I quick sear portobello chunks in a butter and rum liqueur or Xtabentun (X-ta-bu-tion) until just firm, then finish in chowder with a dash of fresh coarse ground chipotle.

I make a similar chowder with clams and crab, but for fat free, I substitute evaporated skim milk.

I added a sweet red pepper for colour. I blistered the pepper over a gas stove, removed the skin and seeds and chopped it roughly. It added a bit of extra flavour along with the colour.
