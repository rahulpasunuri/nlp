This will now be a regular for lunches in my household. Cheap, easy to make, and quite tasty.

So simple and so surprisingly delicious. I used black forest ham. Served it on both hamburger rolls and toasted flour tortillas, and put homemade sweet pickles on top.

This is an excellent recipe. I just made the deviled ham part and served it with crackers. Everyone loved it. It's sort of old-fashioned and homey which is great.

I never made any sort of ham salad before, but I was looking for a fun way to serve my ham leftovers. My husband and I loved this ham salad - it had a funky yummy taste (sweet and savory and zesty all at the same time) -- I incorporated the pickles and onion into the ham salad by dicing up several bread and butter pickles (without the seedy middle parts) and a shallot. It was great on both lightly toasted Arnolds Country White bread and Townhouse crackers! I thought the other proportions in the recipe were just right!

Perfect devilled ham! It has a wonderful balance of flavors. I took a shortcut and added chopped pickles to the ham mix. I made a batch and it was so good I immediately made another for the weekend.

I may not be the best judge, as I have never had deviled ham. It sure was easy and a great way to get rid of Easter ham leftovers, however, I found it kind of sweet and would try it with Dijon instead of grain mustard or maybe even a hotter English mustard. I used about half the mayo and added a pinch of cayenne. Straight out of the Cuisinart, I was bowled over. Let's see how it pans out in a sandwich on high-quality bread. I may go with gerkins instead of dill pickles and the red onion.
