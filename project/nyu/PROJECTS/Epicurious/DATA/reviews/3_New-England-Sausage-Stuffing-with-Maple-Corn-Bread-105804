What a great recipe! Such a wonderful medly of flavors. I stuffed a few cornish game hens with this and baked the rest on the side in a baking dish. The corn bread recipe for this is a must. This is definitely my favorite stuffing recipe.

People LOVE this recipe. I moved abroad to Hong Kong and made Thanksgiving dinner for expats living abroad and this received RAVE reviews. One friend asked to take home just stuffing since he loved it so much. I suggest instead of the crumbly cornbread recipe, use the Pepperidge Farm Cornbread Stuffing mix and just add maple syrup to your eggs when you make the stuffing. I also omitted the apple juice which didn't seem to make a difference.

Excellent! The key to this recipe is the corn bread, purchased doesn't count!!!. Also use 2lbs of apples. For more moist stuffing, add broth or apple juice while stuffing is baking.

I had high hopes for this stuffing, but it just seemed-blah. I did substitute corn bread stuffing for the corn bread itself, which may have thrown it off slightly, but mine also turmed out rather dry. It was more the lack of flavor, though, an d you could taste the maple but in my opinion, the apples did NOTHING for it.

This received mixed reviews, largely because I also made a traditional herb and bread stuffing. I experienced none of the problems of dryness with the stuffing or crumbly corn bread, and the maple syrup add a wonderful sweetness to the bread.

Great addition to the Maple Glazed Turkey, very moist and lots of flavor

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving. I must admit, it was not as good as I expected it to be. Like the other reviewer, it was crumbly, and wouldn't stay together. The stuffing had a good flavor. I used more chicken broth than the recipe called for and it still seemed a bit dry. The maple flavoring in the cornbread was a nice touch.

This was good, but not as good as I thought it'd be.Everyone seemed to love it but I have most of it left over. It makes a LOT (didn't double the cornbread recipe as I was tempted to, thankfully) and it does have good flavor, but the cornbread was really crumbly, more crumbs than chunks, despite having made it the day before and toasting it to dry it out. I'll look for a comparable recipe but won't make this one again.
