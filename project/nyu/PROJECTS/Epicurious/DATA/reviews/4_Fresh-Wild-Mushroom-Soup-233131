Was a great soup but I think that the recommendations from the reviews are the way to go. I did way less butter and didn't feel the extra would have been anywhere near missed. Any mushrooms will be fine. Garlic is a good addition and yes up the fresh herbs and Brandty, sherry or what have you. I did actually add some pecorino at the end for some extra depth plu a bit of cayane just enough to add a bit more oomph. I puréed mine and added some extra sauted mushrooms on the top plus a bit of cream. Quite lovely, quick and easy. A good staple recipie to play with.

I took some advice from the reviews and halfed the butter then added a little cream at the end. Just enough to lighten up the color and cut down the flavor of the beef broth. With some sourdough to accompany it, this dinner was perfect.

"Tastes like La Madeleine" is what I heard. I used shallots instead of onions, cognac instead of brandy, who-knows-what prepackaged mix of mushrooms, and finished off with heavy cream - oh, say, less than a pint. And started with half the butter called for. Delish.

Really tasty. I agreed that there was far too much butter which I will be cutting back on next time. I added a little extra thyme and substituted the brandy for wine. Loved how easy and quick it was to prepare.

This is a delicious soup, and I love being able to choose the texture of the wonderful mushrooms. I would reduce the butter a little (I may have put too much in). I also wouldn't mind a slightly sour flavour or something to just cut through a tiny bit (but preferably not sour cream- it's a little too buttery for me already). If anyone can recommend anything I'd love to make this soup again.

added some additional mushrooms. Didn't cut back on the butter as suggested and didn't find it too heavy or oily. Added finely chopped celery, thyme to the chopped mushrooms. Then 1/2 pint heavy cream along with 1/2 freshly squeezed lemon, sea salt, course ground peppercorns. YUMMY!!!!! My son-in-law and I made this together...and I normally do not like mushrooms soup, and even I went back for seconds! We used the beef stock from the Beef Wellington we made the night before along with the shroom soaking liquid for the dried morals.

I used freshly-foraged chanterelles (an obliging neighbor with eighty wooded acres out here in the country). Anyway, I used 2 cups chants and 2 cups crimini and 1 oz mixed dried (soaked) from Fungus Among Us. The beef broth you use is crucial. (Looking back I wouldn't have used boxed stock). I used grape seed oil to saute (for its neutrality) and added a mini-pat of butter to each serving once finished. I also stirred a bit of dijon mustard in with the broth/stock. Didn't use flour. Other than totally changing the ingredients I stuck pretty close to the recipe. A winner!

Fantastic soup! I used fresh foraged oyster mushrooms - foraged mushrooms really pack a lot more flavor than those you get at the supermarket. Only thing I would change is the amount of butter. I did half butter and half Olive Oil and it was very oily/fatty. Next time I will use Olive Oil and cut the amount in half (maybe even 3 tbsp). I'll definitely go the extra distance to get the wild mushroom from that farmers market, just to make this soup. This'll be a staple in my recipe box for sure!

i never make anything on this site until i have read some reviews. more more more! the onions i used were shallots. the butter was italian. the shrooms i used=chicken of the woods, shitake, crimini & dried procini & chantrelle. i boiled water & soaked the dried, chopped & used the broth. 3xs the brandy (i learned from the reviews). if you don't like the thickness, put your wand in & puree some of it. i also used 5 times fresh thyme & a lot of fresh rosemarry. this is perfect. lots of room to grow. go nuts!

This is the best mushroom soup we have ever had. Everyone who ate it loved it, even our 2-year-old grandson. I did, however, cut back somewhat on the butter and added 1/4 cup half & half.

I only gave it 3 forks because of adjustments. I've made this soup a couple of times now and finally got it. I followed the recipe as written the first time,but wasnt crazy about the texture. Like other reviewers, I pureed 1/2 and got the right texture. The next time I upp'd the brandy about 3x, added rosemary and purreed some to get a thicker, creamier texture. With adjustments, this is now a staple.

We had some really nice quality mushrooms and this soup came out delicious. It is very rich, so I added an extra cup of broth and I think I could even add another. Very easy to make, the onions took a little longer to golden and the mushrooms didn't take as long to brown.

Rating: 4
This soup is easy and delicious. The first time I made it exactly as written and it was very good. The second time I pureed about 2 cups of the soup and mixed it back with the rest, and then added 1/4 cup of half and half I think this made it even better - smoother and creamier with only a small amount of half and half. Any mixture of mushrooms seems to work well. I also added a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper in addition to the salt and pepper.

Very simple, loved the aroma and taste. I did make a few modifications: more shrooms, 4c beef broth and 1c culinary broth (herbs, white wine), 1/2 c butter, olive oil, more thyme, rosemary, basil, whole garlic cloves, peppercorns....delicious!

Everyone seems to like this recipe - who wouldn't with 1 1/2 tablespoons butter per person! Instead of all that butter, I used 2 TBSP plus a small amount of olive oil for cooking the onions and mushrooms, added the beef broth and then simmered. I mixed the brandy and flour together and thickened the soup with it at the end of the cooking time, and then, to make up for the lack of butter, enriched it with 1/4 cup half and half, which has much less fat but added a creamy texture and rich flavor.

I love the idea of the soup, and when it was completed, I loved the idea even more. I did use brown, oyster and shitaki mushrooms all in a little more quantity chopped finely. I also used thyme and rosemary as I love both together in many dishes. I Finally, an additional spot of brandy and bureed about a cup and a half of the soup to give some body to the mixture. It is fabulous. I had a similar soup at a 5-STAR restaurant in Beirut and hoped I could make something similar. Thanks for the recipe. Bon Appetit!

This was incredibly easy and quick to prepare and was also very delicious. Everyone loved it. Next time I make it I'm at least doubling everything, if not tripling. Followed the advice about adding some cream at the end, which went over well too.

Question: Why all the different types of mushrooms? I can't seem to taste any difference at all.

Quite good. Very light so it makes an excellent first course. I used a combination of chicken and vegatble broth and used about 2 cups more than the recipe called for to thin it out some.

I really liked the simplicity of this soup and it came out very good. I followed recipe exactly except for following: - used store bought organic Mushroom broth instead of beef stock (I don't eat meat) - added 1 TB of white wine vinegar as I thought the soup could use a teeny bit of acid to punch up the flavors and also reduce salt a bit. Will defs make this again.

I haven't tried this beauty yet but I feel compelled to to give credit where credit is do. Bengland had a years supply of cheese rinds saved - I love the way you think! Peace.

Very tasty. I didn't have oyster mushrooms, but with 2 varieties the taste was great and the mushrooms had wonderful texture. I also used fresh rosemary instead of thyme. I used a little extra all purpose flour to thicken the soup. As mentioned by other reviewers, the second day tasted even better. I also used the leftover soup as the sauce for some meat balls. It was divine.

Rating: 4
Like most of you, I cannot just run with the recipe as is! I had a year's worth parmesan cheese rinds saved up and made a great rind broth, replacing the beef broth. This also added a bit of a creamy consistency without adding the fat of cream. Didn't have brandy so I used cognac and used 1.5 times the mushrooms....

Very easy to make! Used dehydrated oyster mushrooms and added the water to the soup being careful not to add the sediment at the bottom. Excellent mushroom flavor. I made it the day before then warmed it up and added warm cream with a squirt bottle and made hearts in it. (Hokey yes, bu it was Valentine's Day and the guests loved it.) I served it in stemless martini glasses which was great since it was part of a 5 course meal and the perfect portion. It really was even better the 2nd day. I'll be making it again very soon. A definite keeper!

Beautiful! It's a wonderful simple recipe, with a lot of flavor. I added a bit of Khalua because it was next to the brandy and it worked really well. The only downside is that mine at least turned out looking quite terrible, brown mush really. The taste makes up for it though :)

I added a stalk of finely chopped celery and one carrot cut into small pieces and a 1/4 cup of water. The carrots added color and the extra water and celery took down the salt content a bit.

Don't be afraid to experiment with the types of shrooms you use. I usually put in 7-8 varieties. You can use dry mushrooms. Steep in hot water, then rough chop. Reserve the flavorful mushroom water to add with the broth. Just increase your cook time to reduce the volume. I also sometimes add heavy cream, or use a submersible hand blender to make it smooth.

Excellent recipe! I made a few modifications, not finding oyster mushrooms, I substituted portabella mushrooms. I also cooked the mushrooms in a crockpot retaining the broth and combined 1/2 the beef broth. Probably not 'haute cuisine', but it tilted the flavor more towards the mushroom triumvirate and away from the salt.

We really enjoyed this soup. It would be GREAT as an appetizer before a beef dish. It's very strong in flavor and rich. I felt it needed a little lemon juice at the end and I did run it through the food processor because I like my soups pureed. Would not change much else. Enjoy!

Wonderful & satisfyingly mushroomy. I added some reconstituted dried porcini plus their soaking water for extra depth of flavour. Also did not have enough brandy so added half brandy & half sherry & this was good. I also used a little less beef broth & used a hand blender to puree a little of the soup at the end to make a thicker textured soup. A splash of whipped cream at the end to finish.

In addition to using sherry and adding cream, I modified this recipe by leaving out the flour and, instead, pureeing part of it halfway through the final cooking period. We loved it.

Really nice. I followed the recipe fairly closely, although I used a little less butter and added some half and half at the end of cooking. My husband and I both enjoyed the soup.

Wow! Used the suggestion to add reconstituted dried porcini mushrooms and the soaking liquid. Also, used consomme instead of beef broth, because that was what I had on hand. The result was a rich, flavourful soup that was a big hit at a small dinner party! I made it a day ahead and it was just as good the day after. I will definitely make this again.

Well, I'm sorry to spoil euphoric mood here, but I made it as per instructions, let it sit 7 hours to "get flavorful", added a dollop of cream and really didn't think that it was special at all.

I had to use dried mushrooms for some of the fresh, so I substituted the broth after reconstituting for some of the beef broth. My only criticism: WAY too much butter. I cut it down by about 30% and it was a little oily; I'll go about half next time. Great, easy recipe.

I agree this is a keeper. I used a combination of button, cremini, and shiitakes (all fresh). For creaminess, I served with a dollop of creme fraiche in each bowl and topped with a few whole chives, which made for a nice presentation as well. My guests loved it!

This soup was delicious - I doubled the recipe (without quite doubling the butter in the first step), and added as many wild mushrooms as I could find - I don't think you can add too many, as it will only add to the overall flavor and consistency. I made it today for a special dinner tomorrow, and although it was delicious just after it was made, I can't wait to serve it for my guests after a day of all those flavors blending!!
