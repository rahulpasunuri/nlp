Husband: "What do you call this dish?" Son: "GONE!" it was yummy and pretty fast for such a good dish. nice way to do pork.

This makes for a very inpressive dinner-party meal. I served this to my Mother, Aunt and Grandmother at they first real dinner I hosted, and the were all impressed, and I think a little envious. The secret is, it's very easy to make. It's all in that wine sauce.

This was a real disappointment - it sounded so good on paper but really had no flavour. I might try omitting the bread crumbs and just use the mustard seeds on the pork. The sauce could have used some garlic or shallots. I'll try it again but I'm not to sure about this one.

I used boneless pork chops instead of tenderloin. An OK dinner, but nothing super special. Husband loved it more than I did. I didn't think the mustard seeds added much flavor.

Excellent! Easy to prepare and the red wine sauce is a must. The pork was so moist and flavorful. Will make again and again.

Although this was good, I can't say it was as great as all the reviews. It is quick and easy to prepare. I served it with the sauce, which is also, good but not a wow, and the Semolina Spinach Gratin. It was a nice dinner but not special as I had expected.

I JUST had this at my Aunt & Uncle-in-law's house in Colorado over the Thanksgiving weekend. It was REALLY good! The mustard really give the sauce that "what is it" flavor. Make it. You'll love it. NOT low-cal since it's breaded but SO good!

I have made this twice now. It is a terrific hit. I loved the red wine sauce and everyone at the table raved about the recipe.

These were easy to make and very tasty, and so is the sauce. The Spinach Gratin from the same menu was also good and goes well with the medallions.

I will definately make this recipe again! It was easy and delicious. Since it's just 2 of us I halved the recipe with no problem. I used 1 whole egg rather than dividing 3 egg whites in half. The wine sauce is a nice addition. I served this with rice and a light salad. Yum!
