Bluemona - you can start saving the (thoroughly) washed trimmings from onions, leaks, carrots, celery, fennel, etc (even the paper you peel off the garlic cloves) and throw them into a resealable freezer bag that you store in the refrigerator. This will cut down on the fresh vegetables you will need to buy in order to make the broth. It may change the flavor profile some but that's what I do when I make vegetable stock.

Bluemona - don't fret about 'wasting' good vegetables - you've extracted all the delicious nutrients, minerals, and flavour into your broth. You're only left with the fibre which you can compost with good conscience.

Bluemona - Agree about the good stock as well as not liking to waste vegetables. Unfortunately composting seems the best solution. Have pureed and added to soups/stews/quiche/etc. but honestly can't say it ever added anything of substance (flavor's gone and there's no texture left after all the previous cooking).

This is a great broth. I used it for the red lentil recipe and froze the rest, and have used it on a couple of occasions for other soups. It has plenty of flavour and I love the addition of garlic, which the other stock recipes I have encountered so far lack. I used less water (6 quarts) because my stock pot was not big enough to accommodate 8 (that's a lot of vegetables). I also had some homemade beef stock around which I substituted for one of the 6 quarts. The thing I don't like about making stock is that you are left over with some very bland vegetables. I don't like to throw them out so I try to eat them, but I did end up throwing most out on this occasion. Any ideas what I could do to avoid this waste?
