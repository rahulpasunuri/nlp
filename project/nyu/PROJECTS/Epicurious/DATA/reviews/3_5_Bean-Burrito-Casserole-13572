Great recipe: delicious, fast and cheap. I have made this several times and have increased the spices, jalapenos and cilantro. It's also good topped with sour cream.

I improvised a lot with this recipe. I used a whole tomato instead of the sauce and taco seasoning mix due to the sorry state of my spice cabinet ;) there wasn't enough filling, it only made enough to fill 7 tortillas so next time I'll double it, use half an onion and maybe add some ground beef. But there will definitely be a next time!

Simple, quick, and tasty. Don't omit the fresh coriander (cilantro) because it makes the dish. Because I have young kids who aren't crazy about cumin and jalepeno, I make the bean and tomato sauce mixture the separate it into two portions. One gets the spices (for the grownups) and the other not. The kids love it this way.

Made this for a potluck and it was delicious! I added a few more spices: chipotle chili powder, oregano, and smoked paprika to spice it up a bit. I also used corn tortillas since that's all I had in stock at home. It was a huge hit and very easy to make. If I were to make this again, I would fry up the corn tortillas a little bit to give them some crunch. I would also add salsa or stewed tomatoes to the top to give it some more texture and moisture. The black bean mixture could easily be a side dish in itself and this will be my go-to black bean recipe in the future.

Delicious as written! Added a whole shredded rotisserie chicken to the filling and increased tomato sauce to a full 14oz. can. This made the meal much heartier. The ski house loved it!

I halved the recipe since it was only for 3 people, used canned black beans and fresh jalapeno. It was quite tasty!Would recommend trying it, nice to have a vegetarian dish in my recipe pile. Also made the Mexican rice recipe to accompany it-- added the other half of the tomato sauce to the rice and baked it like a pilaf...not too shabby, if I say so myself.

I substituted a can of corn instead of half of the beans. It added a really nice dimension. I would add more cilantro next time. I prefer corn tortillas and they worked really well with this recipe.

I also used a potato masher to break up the beans, and broke up all of them instead of just half, as I didn't think my household would enjoy mouthfuls of whole beans.

This was really good, a quick, easy and inexpensive weeknight meal. I only gave it two forks because it isn't a very nuanced recipe, but it is delicious and does the job (with leftovers), and I will most definitely make it again. We are trying to eat less meat, so this was a nice, healthy alternative. We don't eat garlic, so I jazzed up the onions with red pepper flakes. I also used a can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and chopped up the better part of a bunch of cilantro. (I left out the coriander because I couldn't find any.) This is definitely going into the regular rotation.

Rating: 1
I guess I should have not gotten my hopes up, but based on reviews, I did and I was quite disappointed. Although looking at the ingredients list, I suppose I should not be surprised that this was only okay. The only thing I can think of is that I used dried beans instead of canned which can sometimes have lots of sodium. Perhaps I should have more generously salted the bean/onion/garlic mix... but I will not be trying again and will look for another burrito casserole recipe instead.

Rating: 3
This was really good! I used diced tomatoes rather than sauce but otherwise was pretty true to the recipe. I like this for a weeknight meal - the prep is not too cumbersome and can mostly be done in the processor and the main ingredients are canned so it comes together quickly. I'll make this again.

My brother said that I could make this for him anytime, so I take that as exceptional praise. The things that I changed were: because the grocery store didn't have montery jack (well, it was flavoured jack, and I didn't know how it would taste in the recipe . . .), I used white cheddar; also, I added garlic powder, chipotle chili powder (only a sprinkle), and extra cumin to the beans; instead of mashing beans with the back of a spoon, which I thought to be too labour-intensive, I used a food processor; and I added more cilantro than the recipe called for- about a 1/3 to 1/2 a cup instead of 1/4- because I lost my 1/4 cup measurer! You could definatley taste the cilantro in the recipe, although I didn't consider it to be overpowering. The other spices were just right. For the jalapeno peppers, I only coursely chopped them and left the seeds in them. Maybe it would have made a difference presentation-wise, but they were presented inside the tortillas, and as far as adding spiciness to the dish goes . . . well, I heard that this is a myth. Anyway, according to my brother and I, it wasn't too spicely with the seeds. With it, I served my own homemade guacamole, which also went over well, and some salsa and sour cream.

Made this with pink beans which I had never used or eaten before and it was delicious. Added a cup of corn and 1 1/2 cups of cooked brown rice. Put hot enchilada sauce on the side. Everyone loved it. Served it with guacamole and salsa. I will make it again.

Rating: 2
This was good but not great. I made a lot of changes based on previous reviews. Added diced tomatoes, green onions, and ground beef. Layered it like a lasagna. If I made this again, I would would make it as written, as I think the simplicity of it is probably what would make it shine. If you want something with meat, more cheese, and more flavor, the Crusted Chicken and Black Beans on this site is much better.

My husband, kids and I love these burritos and have made them weekly since discovering this recipe. I use a can of Rotel tomatoes rather than tomato sauce, found that using pickled jalapenos adds such a great flavor, and I put just a little cheese inside before rolling up whole wheat flour soft taco size tortillas. What a tasty, healthy, inexpensive meal!

This is one of the few recipes I make over and over. My 13-year-old can't get enough. I substitute mild rotel tomatoes for the tomato sauce. Pouring a can of enchilada sauce over the top really improves this. Oh, and it takes more like 20-30 minutes in the oven.

I decided to make this because there were soooo many rave reviews - and they were right! It was easy, quick and tasty. Per other reviews, I subbed diced tomatoes with mild chilies for the tomato sauce, added a cup of corn and about a cup and a half of cooked rice. Put some cheese inside b4 I rolled 'em up. Topped with enchilada sauce and more cheese. Whole family loved it!

This was a hit at our house. I didn't have tomato sauce so I mixed bottled salsa with some bottled smooth taco sauce. I used dark red kidney beans which were beautiful. I like this recipe because you can use a minimum of (fattening) cheese and it has lots of high-fiber, low-fat beans. You can also personalize it in many ways.

Rating: 4
One of my standards now. Almost everything I keep in my cupboard already: cumin (of course), Rotel with lime & cilantro (as recommended by another), beans (my favorites are pinto and great northern), and tortillas I keep in the freezer and chopped jalapenos in the fridge. You just need an onion (I use 1/2 instead of a whole), cilantro, and cheese. I put the cheese on the inside. And I serve it with chopped avocado. Mmmmm

Rating: 3
This was a crowd pleaser. As noted in a previous review, it needs the salt and pepper at the end. I also topped each serving with a generous dollop of homemade guacamole (from a great recipe on this website) and a spoonful or two of bottled salsa. As long as you're not expecting a saucy, cheesy casserole, you'll find this dish to be easy and delicious.

Rating: 2
I used canned pink beans which were quite good and added a small can of green chilies. This recipe still needs something - a little more texture - so next time I'll add some rice or roasted corn in with the beans. A good, simple recipe for adaptions...

Rating: 3
I used my own homemade beans - dried pintos cooked with onion, garlic, cumin, salt and chile powder. I cooked them so long (too much water) that they were divine - like velvet. I used regular small corn tortillas. I didn't put any tomato sauce in it. I did put in some dried mild chiles (we don't like hot things). I grated way more Jack cheese than called for, so there was a generous layer on top of them. I didn't have guacamole, unfortunately, but served them with sour cream and cherry salsa. They were wonderful - the kids liked them too. I was surprised that such a simple dish was so good. Oh, they didn't stick to the pan either - surprisingly.

Rating: 4
This is a very easy and delicious recipe. The only thing I changed was I used a Chipotle pepper rather than a plain jalepeno and it came out great! From reading the other reviews, I suspect the "bland" problems resulted from a failure to follow the "salt & pepper to taste" note.

This was excellent. I didn't have enough tortillas, so I spooned the remainder of the bean mixture on top. Served with salsa and sour cream and beer. Boyfriend raved.

Unfortunately, this made somewhat bland burritos. It really cried out for a sauce of some kind. The cheese alone (even with the salsa etc) just didn't cut it.

This was a great versatile recipe. I took the advice of other posters and used Rotel in place of tomato sauce and used kidney beans--next time will try black or pinto as the kidneys were not a huge hit with the 12 year old. I layered flour tortillas to make a Mexican "lasagna" rather than burritos--layering filling, cheese and tortillas. I had enough filling for three layers finishing the top layer with last of the filling and last of the cheese. Also, I drizzled some cream over the top of the dish before baking to cut the acidity of the tomatoes as well as adding some richness. Very good and I am sure I will make this again.

This was great. I doubled the filling recipe and will use the rest as roll-up filling for lunches the rest of the week. I added chili powder and dried oregano to the filling and replaced the tomatoes with a can of Rotel. As I didn't have any sauce to put on top, I took crushed tomatoes, tomatoe sauce, 1 spicy chicken bouillon cube, oregano, chili powder, cumin and made my own sauce. It was great, added a slightly tart topping to the burritos... We topped with soy cheese as we can't do milk - and it turned out great. Next time, will do the veg version for sure. Only other suggestion would be to make sure and grease the dish first... My husband thought that these were different than enchiladas in that there was more to the filling than just meat... and I agree. Great recipe, easy to modify for personal tastes.

Wonderful dish - especially when you are short on time like I am most of the time. As suggested by some reviewers, I added ground beef and diced tomatoes with excellent results.

Yes this IS a basic recipe, and it is done exactly right. That's what makes it so great. Throw in whatever appeals to you. I like tons of roasted poblanos and hot enchilada sauce on top (which actually makes them rolled enchis but who cares). If I'm feeling fancy, I serve on a bed of shredded lettuce with homemade salsa on top. I love the contrast of soft, spicy, warm burrito with crunchy, cool salad.

I gave this three forks because I did not make the entire dish, I only made the filling and used that in place of beans in regular burritos and it was great! Do not skimp on the jalepenos or cilantro, they really make a difference. Also used diced tomatoes, but it's such a small amount compared to the beans I imagine you could use anything to get the tomato flavor and it wouldn't make a difference.

Once again, I'm not sure how to rate the recipe as printed - my meal was a combination of excellent reader suggestions and imagination. I was all set to start chopping when I realized my leftover chicken caciattore contained all the basic ingredients. Shredded the chicken, used all of the sauce, added corn, pinto beans, chipotles in adobo, fresh tomatoes and cilantro. Wrapped in jalapeno/cilantro tortillas, topped with enchilada sauce and two cheeses. Excellent.

I like the concept, but the recipe as written is rather bland. I will definitely make it again using the recipe as a base. Could use some Rotel tomatoes, some spiced ground beef, roasted corn, etc. I also liked the idea of layering it as opposed to rolling the tortillas, but think I might use corn tortillas instead if I layered it. The recipe has great potential.

I enjoyed this recipe with the modifications made based on reviewer suggestions. Next time I make it I will use spinach flavored tortillas (so much flavor), one can of black beans, enchilada sauce, cheddar and jack cheese, pureed chipolte's to spread on as a layer, corn and a small amount of jasmine rice to give it some body. I layered it like a lasagna and added sour cream to the top to cool it off a bit! I warmed up some chicken as a side for my non vegetarian husband and he enjoyed it too!

This was a great quick and tasty dish. I thought the use of tomato sauce was weird, but I made my own used diced canned tomatoes, garlic and basil, and the sauce did not overpower at all, but blend. I am not sure what makes this a "casserole", it's more like just burritos to me, but it tasted great.

I thought this was good and easy, and I think you could add just about whatever you want to it. I used canned nopales instead of the chiles, just because I happened to see them at the store. So I think mine turned out milder than the original version, but my sister thought I was pretty hip, using cactus and all.

A great recipe, with the one significant change that I poured enchilada sauce on top. First time I made it I used leftover adzuki beans, the second time black beans and black-eyed peas (all I had on had) - turned out great, both times, and even better the next day.

This is very, very similar to a black bean enchilada recipe I got from the newspaper ages ago. It is a standard in our house. Our version adds picante sauce to the beans, and a quick sauce of picante and fresh chopped tomatoes goes over the top. Cover with foil and bake 15 minutes, then remove foil and add cheese (a blend is best) for 5 more minutes. Top with ridiculous amounts of sour cream. We always keep these ingredients on hand, and my husband has something he can make when needed!

We liked this. Found it a nice way to use leftovers...'stead of the jack cheese used a corner of sharp cheddar, and stead of the chilis, used four pieces of Goya canned chipotles...Turned out the four pieces chopped up were just a tad too hot for both our tastes. Next time I'll make my own guacamole as a cooling side, and throw in double the cilantro so that it can better compete with the delicious accompanying flavors.

This was okay, for kids and indiscriminately hungry folks. I used Rotel tomatoes and chilis instead of tomato sauce. I made my burritos pretty stuffed, used only half the tortillas before the filling was gone. But the meal was ample anyway; if anything, too carbo-heavy.

This is a great recipe if you're in a hurry, too. Try using tomatoes and green chile in place of the tomato sauce, tho. True Mexican dishes don't use tomato sauce. It gives it a completely different taste. Red chili sauce might be good, as well. Will certainly try it and see.

I wouldn't make this again for myself, but my husband would never stop complaining if I didn't make it again!

This recipe was great, although I altered it a bit. I shuddered at the idea of tomato sauce in burritos (blech!) so I substituted one can of tomatoes with chiles (I think Chi Chi's makes it). I also used one can of black beans along with about 3/4 pound of shredded chicken. There is no way that this recipe would serve 6 - two of us almost ate it all! We made 5 burritos out of it, as 3 Tbs. of filling is such a meager amount!

This time I used a combination of queso quesadilla cheese and jack; layered everything like you would a lasagna, and topped the whole pan with chopped green onions, sliced black olives, and more chopped cilantro. Served it with a green salad. Even my kids liked it, and they hate everything!!

This was pretty good. I used comments from other reviews, added 1 lb ground beef & can of green chiles to onion/garlic saute, used 1 can of black beans, small can of corn, 1 can Rotelle for sauce and chile powder instead of cumin and coriander. Layered tortillas in bottom of pan, topped with filling and cheese, then did this 3 more times with final layer tortillas and cheese, poured can of enchilada sauce over that and baked as directed covered. Family loved it. Very easy and would be a good "make ahead" dish for those busy nights. Chicken instead of beef would be great.

I made this dish many times before I realized I was doing it completely wrong. Instead of rolling the tortillas, I laid them flat and added layers of ingredients lasagna-style. This is a terrific entree for a dinner party if you're looking for a dramatic vegetarian dish. The looming tortilla tower makes quite a spectacle when brought to the table, and is even more gorgeous when sliced. It moves from 3 forks to 4 if you cook your own beans, but with canned beans or not it's still pretty tasty.

I loved this recipe....great for a quick but delicious dinner and I love the fact that it can be made ahead and heated at the last minute. As others before me, I also made a few changes....instead of 2 cans of black beans I used one can of beans and one lb. of ground turkey. As another suggested, after putting the cheese on I poured a can of enchilada sauce over the top and since I forgot to mix the cilantro (coriander)into the black bean/turkey mixture I just sprinkled it over the entire casserole before putting in the oven and this actually added wonderful color and flavor!

This dish was easy to make but seemed to be lacking something. I added more cumin and some hot sauce and it still wasn't enough.
