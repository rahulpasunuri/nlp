Yum! I call it Chinese comfort food. You can get these chinese donuts things (not sure what they are called) and slice them up and put them on top. Delicious!

Personally I thought it was fantastic. I love the very subtle flavor before you add any soy sauce or sesame oil and how the flavor is still subtle but very tasty after the soy sauce. Of course I may be partial to this recipe because I really like porridge-type food textures.

Having my mother's turkey congee on Boxing Day is the best way to soothe the overeating hangover from the night before. Sort of like a culinary hair-of-the-dog! If you cannot wait til Christmas or Thanksgiving for a precious turkey carcass, you can use a couple of turkey drumsticks instead. Just as delicious...
