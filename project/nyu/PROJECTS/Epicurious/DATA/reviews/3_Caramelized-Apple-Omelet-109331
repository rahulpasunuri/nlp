Made this for the 2nd time last night--I must have been in a VERY bad mood the 1st time I reviewed it in 2006 (I had tried to plate it as written). This time it was EXCELLENT, made MY way. Still decreased the sugar to 1/2 tsp, and again used a home-grown, tree-ripened Winesap apple. Subbed Greek yogurt for the creme fraiche. After sautéing the apple slices, I placed 3/8" slices of 1&1/2 Ball Park NY Deli Beef franks (pre-cooked) in between the apple slices. After the step of letting the raw egg flow under the omelet, I covered the skillet for a few minutes, then added the mixture of Greek yogurt and dulce de leche. Folded the omelet in half in the skillet, covered it again for a minute or two, then flipped the half-moon for another minute or two while toasting English muffins. Cut the 1/2 moon in half, and put a section on each serving plate. REALLY DELICIOUS!!! Will make this many times.

There is not much good that I can say about this recipe as it is written. 1) Sure am glad I only used 1/2 tsp. of sugar, 2) When using my non-stick skillet with perpendicular sides, how is the fluid supposed to run under the cooked bottom of the eggs? 3) No problem lifting 1/3 of the omelet into the middle of the omelet, but then, how do you tilt this pan with upright sides to SLIDE it out onto a plate so that you can invert the skillet??? Color me disgusted with the presentation. Also, the canned Nestle "La Lechera Dulce de Leche" was almost cement. I froze the rest of the can, but I will probably throw it out. I am NOT a novice cook, and my finished product looked like barf. It tasted OK. Did ANYBODY try this as written??? Most Epi recipes are wonderful...

Good recipe. Only change I make is to add a little extra egg, and/or substitute with egg beaters. I also reduced the sugar intake. You need toast with butter only to offset.

I enjoy making breakfast for houseguests and after trying this recipe (on myself and my husband) look forward to including it in my 'tried and true' recipe notebook. A perfect occasional treat! We loved it! And, I followed the directions for home-made dulce de leche (sweetened condensed milk in the oven for an hour) and it worked perfectly! I look forward to finding more recipes that include this delectable ingredient!

I found this recipe just ok. However, the idea of the apple in an omelet intrigued me so I tried this the second time: Sauteed some Granny Smith apples in a little butter (a must for flavour), added diced, cooked prosciutto & a very light drizzle of maple syrup (any good ham will do) When all was nicely coloured, I poured in egg mixture and cooked a couple of minutes on the stove then transferred to the oven to finish (a'la frittata) YUMMMMMMEEEEEE

In Holly Garrison's wonderful cookbook, Comfort Food, she has a recipe for condensed milk pudding. She says this pudding was made in times past by gently heating the unopened can until it caramelized inside. She adds that the cans were sometimes known to explode, and gives a safe alternative that she says yields the same results. This is her method: "Preheat oven to 425* F. Place the contents of a 14 oz can sweetened condensed milk in a pie plate and cover tightly with aluminum foil. Place in a water bath and bake for about an hour, until thickened and slightly caramel colored." I've never had an urge to eat this kind of food, so I've never tried this recipe. But it's got Holly Garrison's stamp of approval!

Haven't made this dish but was interested re the boiling of the condensed milk which I did for years. Fortunately, in South Africa, we can now buy it ready boiled in the tins. Makes life very easy and I always have stashes of it in my cupboard as it can be used for so many desserts,

My guests liked it very much (though, due to our South American background, we are all a bit partial to dulce de leche). Tough I don't like the idea of actually cooking anything for company while they are there - would certainly due it again for the family.

Re: boiling cans of sweetened condensed milk. I too have done this many times with no problems. My Mother-in-law did have a can explode on her once when she allowed the water to boil away. So, just be careful that there is enough water to cover the cans for the whole two hours.

Not good.

While the inside of this omelet was quite sweet and tasty, once it was wrapped inside an omelet it tasted a bit too much like custard that had gone off.

To: Cook from Austen TX ....re. boiling unopened cans of condensed mik. I regularly simmer 4 cans at a time for 2 hours (I've done this hundreds of times) and never had a problem. Use along with sliced bananas to fill a pastry (or biscuit) case, top with whipped cream and plain chocolate curls for the easiest and most delicious Banoffee Pie (one of the biggest sellers in my tea rooms!). Personally I think it would be far too sweet for this recipe though.

re the comment on making dulce de leche from a can of condensed milk -- I have had it made this way in Latin America, but I have also heard cautions about boiling / heating the closed can of condensed milk in this fashion.

I hosted a foreign exchange student from Chile who loved to cook. He made his Dulce de Leche by boiling a can of sweetened condensed milk in a pan of water with a tight fitting lid, the water was 3/4 up the side of the can. He cooked it for over an hour, making sure it did not boil dry. It was excellent.

It is delicious; my husband liked it sooooo much, asked me to make it two days in a row; did not use the Dulce de Leche; not familiar with it and thought perhaps would be too sweet, it came utterly delicious without it. Thanks Epicurious for your wonderful recipes. A cook in Aurora, Colorado

This is neither sweet nor a classic breakfast egg dish. There is no distinctive flavor to make it special. The consistency is heavy. Perhaps if the apples were thinly sliced, the overall dish would be light but I am not interested in trying it again.

Can someone tell me what "dulce de leche" is? Is it a cheese? Better yet, what can one substitute? Thank you, as I would like to try this recipe...
