Delicious and couldn't be easier--and I think of myself as someone who doesn't like cabbage!

I used a slice of bacon instead of prosciutto - the flavor was good, but there was a little too much fat. Next time I will only use 1 T. olive oil. Otherwise, this was great. Served w/ roasted quail and rice; everyone loved it. Quick to prepare, very fresh and light, good balance of flavors.

Not bad - an unusual taste pairing of napa with peas, but nice to have something besides stir-fry to do with napa in overabundance in the garden!

I suggest that you use real bacon and diced onions and red peppers with this. A little garlic salt won't hurt either. Then it is downright heavenly!

My husband and I thought the recipe blah...added a few onions and still would not do again. Very nutritious but not satisfying..no taste. Pass
