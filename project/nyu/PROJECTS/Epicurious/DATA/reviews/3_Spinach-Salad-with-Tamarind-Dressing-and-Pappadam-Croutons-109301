I served this salad (minus the pappadums) alongside the Bombay Sliders also on this site, and it was a big hit - everyone loved the tamarind concentrate in the dressing.

This was very tasty. I did not fry the pappadums - I used my microwave instead. As long as you add them at the last second, they stay crispy. I thought the dressing was pretty good. The tamarind flavour didn't stand out that much...I think you could easily substitute a maple balsamic dressing. FYI - you can buy the concentrate at any indian grocery store. I added some peppers for colour as well. I thought this was a nice way to incorporate the "indian" theme of my dinner party into the salad course. Very fun.

a correction: pappadams (or papad, the north indian word) are actually made from gram flour (gram are legumes that look like little chickpeas, and are related. however there are also rice pappadam, but they are not as common). i am addicted to pappadam, and my indian roommate taught me that one can cook pappadam simply, quickly, and without fat by simply microwaving them (one at a time!). put one in the microwave and give it about 30 seconds to cook - you can watch as the beam of the microwave hits them and puffs them up. incidentally, cooked this way they are a very nutritious and delicious snack, high in protein, much healthier than chips, but with lots of crunch. too bad they're so hard to find in germany... but in LA you can buy them in every indian market, in about 6 different flavours (plain, black pepper, cumin, green chili, etc). they also keep very well - you can just leave a packet in your cupboard until you're ready to use them.

I used the recipe for the dressing as an alternative to other dressings for the salad I made for guests. The dressing was a big hit! Tamarind concentrate can be found in the Goya section of frozen foods. Also, tamarind can be found in Asian markets as it is used in a lot of Thai food. To the person that used garam marsala instead, tamarind should not be substituted because you miss the whole essence of the recipe. I think it's worth trying again!

Couldn't find tamarind concentrate, so added garam masala for a kick. Added more lime juice as well. This salad seems to suffer from what I'm finding with many salads featured in Gourmet menus--it's nearly an afterthought and is the weak point of the menu. In all fairness, not having the tamarind concentrate may have been the turning point for the salad.

Pappadums are light, crisp wafers made of lentil flour served at Indian restaurants.

What the heck are pappadams?
