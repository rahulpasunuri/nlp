the word "scant" anywhere in a recipe means "just less than". it's sort of a judgement call.

Yuck. Strangely salty (from the romano chees), but not in a good way. I couldn't figure out "scant 1/8 inch" meant, so I tried different thicknesses from 1/8" (which would make only about 8 ravioli and was unpleasantly doughy) down to 1/10" (which burst open while being fried). Nothing produced something I'd want to eat. I feel like I gave this recipe a chance, and it gave back nothing in return.
