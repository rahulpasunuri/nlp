This recipe was much better than I expected. I almost skipped the raisins, but I'm so glad I didn't. The anchovy flavor was surprisingly subtle. I must have added an EXTRA large glass of wine because my sauce had to simmer for more than ten minutes (so I doubled the tomato puree), and although the sauce wasn't at all "thick" as described in the recipe, it came out great. Didn't find it too salty at all, as other reviewers did. Very forgiving and delicious and made from all pantry ingredients. Can't beat that!

I made this for valentine's day dinner for my husband, who is an anchovy fanatic (I am not!). It was super easy and incredibly delicious. I also used plain premade breadcrumbs from the store, and linguine.

I used canned anchovies and rinsed them per other reviews. The dish still came out too salty, but I think my mistake was to use the recipe (which makes enough sauce for 4) in a dish for two people. I ended up smothering the pasta with sauce and that made the saltiness overwhelming. If I made this again, I'd be careful to go easy on the sauce.

what might he mean by margherita pasta? I know what margherita pasta and pizza toppings are; an internet search tells me 'pasta margherita' is actually a kind of Italian cake, which he surely does not mean. Is there a photo somewhere giving a clue as to what sort of pasta to use?

We are NOT anchovy fans. Has anyone an idea on what we could substitute that would give a similar result-- but not too fishy??

I use marsala and large golden raisins, both of which I had on hand on a weeknight, as well as panko, anchovies in olive oil (no rinsing needed) and whole wheat linguine. It was delicious. It WAS dry for my taste, but that is easily fixed by making twice as much of the delicious sauce as called for with the same amount of pasta, and maybe a little more tomato puree. A great recipe to mess with-- fast and simple. I will be making it for my man tomorrow night, with wine this time!

I served this as part of a birthday dinner for my daughter-in-law, increasing it a bit to feed 6 instead of 4. I got the salted anchovies, but the recipe did not say to wash them, so for the first couple I threw into the pan I didn't wash off the salt, then they seemed so EXCEEDINGLY salty that I washed the salt off the rest. Good thing. Then to make up for the extra salt I cooked the pasta without salt. It all evened out pretty well. And the raisins counterbalanced any extra saltiness. My guests (including an Italian) LOVED it. Even my 3-year-old grandson ate and ate. It comes together very fast, especially if you use fresh pasta, as I did. It was unusual and delicious.

I made this using tomato paste for "tomato puree" and it thickened up beautifully. That said, the sauce was delicious, but I'm not sure I loved it on pasta as it was a little too sharp and "wine-y", but I will definitely keep this recipe and try it on grilled tuna or swordfish, perhaps served over pasta. It might also be a nice change of pace for grilled chicken breasts. Definitely a "keeper" sauce.

Can people PLEASE stop reviewing recipes that they have not made? What is the point? Do we really care that it "sounds good," or that your husband would not like a meal with raisins? Anyway, I made this recipe from the cookbook and thought that it was pretty good but certainly not exceptional. I would prefer a good puttanesca any day.

This recipe appealed to me right away and my son loved it. Do not omit the raisins! The only changes I made were to add more anchovies. The nutty flavor they impart was not pronounced. Also, I added some pasta water as the final result was a little dry.

This recipe appealed to me right away and my son loved it. Only things i would change are to add more anchovies. We didnt feel the nutty flavor they impart were pronounced enough. Also, I added a little pasta water as the final result was a little dry. The additiona of raisins was awesome!

This was fantastic. My family loved it. I added fresh mushrooms and several more pieces of anchiovies and it was a hit.

i thought this recipe was delicious. lots of different textures and flavors going on (sweet, salty, nutty, etc.) and really easy to make. i don't LOVE anchovies, but they really don't taste fishy in this recipe as they blend into the sauce. i may have used more wine than intended, i had to simmer the sauce for a while to make it thick.

Okay, I did read the list ingredients and wondered what this would taste like. . .and I am willing to experiment and expand my taste-comfort zone - my taste buds and nose are not willing to go there again. "Odd, fishy, tomatoey goo on pasta" is what this recipe should be renamed. As the foreward suggests, I'd really have to be down and out to make this again!

I sounds lovely, but my husband would divorce me if I put raisins in his dinner.
