I made this for my family while on vacation and it was a huge hit! Flavorful and easy, perfect for rental house improv. Plus the vinaigrette is great on veggies and bread. Perfect anytime, but always reminds me of the beach. Oh, I used sherry instead of vinegar and add lemon or a light vinegar depending on what I have.

We loved this too. I didn't have sherry vinegar so used half plain vinegar & half sherry, as suggested below.

This is phenominal!! I did not use the sherry vinegar, but real sherry in it's place (I hate vinegars) and it was PERFECT! This sauce is also excellent on chicken and steak. Even my kids fight over the sauce!

We loved this dish! Added chunks of smoked sausage to the kabobs which gave the shrimp a delicious smoky flavor. Also, doubled amount of tomatoes and green onions. Tomatoes took much longer to char, even on high heat. At least 15 minutes. Didn't have any sherry vinegar so added some sherry and white vinegar. Tasted great!

I thought the vinaigrette was delicious -- adding great flavor to the grilled shrimp. A good sherry vinegar is a must.

I made this last night for friends and they really liked it. The vinegrette wasn't that impressive. I don't think I grilled the tomatoes long enough to give it some flavor. I'll be making this one again just for the sake of making the dipping sauce better.

I wrapped the shrimp in prosciutto instead of using kosher salt. Excellent recipe!

I tripled the amount of tomatoes and halved the amount of olive oil, amount of vinegar stayed the same. Results were excellent. Added garlic and smoked paprika to the marinade for the shrimp. We served it with the rice with green onions and black olives also on this site. Grilled asparagus on the side. Decided it was a meal good enough for Saturday night guests.

Everyone loves this one. I made one change as suggested by a reviewer. I marinated in salt + chopped garlic for 1/2 hour. Excellent and beautiful presentation. Never fails.

I loved it (with the garlic of course) but a lot of my company preferred other shrimp items I've made in the past. Will make it again just for me!

I agree it needed garlic. It was ok - nothing special. Better shrimp recipes out there.

Not too hard for novice cooks!

Very nice. I made it as written but agree that some may prefer to "tweak" the vinegrette a bit. I might add a bit of lemon juice next time. I served it with a fresh mix of greens with some cukes and green onions, using the vinegrette to lightly coat the greens - which made for a nice summer salad.

I made this last evening and followed the directions to the letter. The dish was delicious. Roasting the tomatoes and onions added a wonderful flavor, but the tomatoes took closer to 15 minutes to blister and start to char. I used medium-sized shrimp, but would recommend larger shrimp, as by the time you cut off the tail, there's not much left! Very pretty presentation.

After reading that the vineigrette needed something, I added 2 cloves crushed garlic and 2 tablespoons fresh basil leaves.

Very good and very easy to make. I agree the dressing needs something. I added a splash of fresh lemon juice. The flavors work well together and the dish makes a nice presentation. I served it with boiled edamame, a crusty baguette, and a glass of good champagne. It was great served outdoors on a warm summer evening.

Pretty good. The charred tomato vinaigrette needed something, so I added garlic.
