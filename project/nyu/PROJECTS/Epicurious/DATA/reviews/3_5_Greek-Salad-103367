Used the small Campari tomatoes (much tastier than regular cherries) and Dimitri's feta cheese, crumbled, that is not at all salty. Excellent! Served 4 people as a side salad with some having 2 servings

I thought this was great. I was looking for something simple, fresh and low-cal. I followed the recipe to a point. I used red pepper, instead of green, not quite so much red onion, and freeze-dried dill, instead of oregano. I also sauteed four shrimp in olive oil and a squirt of lemon for added protein. Oh, and I ate it in a pita. Delicious!!

Great flavors! Simple, and easy, as well. I made this for a dinner with my boyfriend's parents, and got good feedback.

This was easier than my previous favorite Greek Salad recipe, from Cooks Illustrated-I like that you don't have to mix the dressing separately. We were very glad we doubled it-it was just enough for two main courses each for DH and I. It is very like the Greek Salads we had travelling in Greece, with the exception, that others pointed out, that in Greece you only see dried Oregano. And the people who say it's not authentic because it doesn't have lettuce are nuts :) We never saw lettuce in a salad in Greece. Yum!

Simple and delicious, I too added romain and thought it was great.

This was the best Greek salad I have ever prepared! I used red wine vinegar instead of lemon juice, and I used dried oregano rather than fresh. I cut the olive flesh from the stone in slivers, and I used a Cherokee tomato cut into chunks. But I made these changes only because I had to make do. I will make this salad again and again.

Just what I wanted! Finally, a refreshing (and quick!) recipe that uses enough fresh vegetables to make me forget it's the dead of winter. Fresh lemon juice makes all the difference, don't bother with anything in a bottle.

Perfect recipie for a large dinner party. I made this for an international feast my friends and I had at his house. I got to bring the Greek salad since I'm part Greek. They love it. Infact they couldn't get enough of it and now I"m incharge of the salad at all get-togethers.

I thought it was great. Nice change from the usual Minnesota salads (lettuce and tomatoes) we typically make. I like the idea of adding fresh garlic.

This salad is wonderful and simple. I've made it several times and my husband raves about it. I crumble the feta right into the salad. I usually double the recipe and bring the extra to work for lunch.

I had this salad (less the bell peppers) for the 1st time about 10 years ago. It was the 1st time I ever tasted greek olives or feta cheese. I don't know what is was that took hold of me? There was a pungent flavor that I had never tasted before, yet it was balanced by the sweetness of the cucumbers and the tomatoes. Every year I look forward to vine ripened tomatoes and this salad! As for being authenic or having lettuce in it or not, I really don't care. As a 1st generation Italian I have tasted 'Italian' food that is nothing like what I learned to be Italian, but it still tasted great. Every Country has it's own regional cooking. It's all just a matter of taste, and the taste of this salad is at the top of my list!

This was a great colorful salad that I took to an Easter barbeque. I substitued yellow peppers for green and doubled the recipe. I used two types of Greek olives for an interesting variety. I also crumbled the chese over the top and tossed at the last minute. Wonderful tasting, easy to make and low in calories.

To the cook from Toronto: The Greek salad without the lettuce in the restaurants on the Danforth are 'Village Salads' (and you can get them in every greek restaurant on the Danforth) Most people prefer this to the one that is overpowered by the soggy lettuce.

I'd made this dish twice before realizing that it doesn't call for iceberg lettuce! All the Greek restaurants I've been to (btw, Toronto has the largest Greektown in North America, which is why I have the privilage of sampling so many authentic Greek restaurants) have included lettuce in their salads. This is a delicious starter, but I like to add the head lettuce. Somehow, it just doesn't feel right to call something a salad if it doesn't contain lettuce! (Potato salad excluded-- but you know what I mean!) :)

I liked this recipe, but I used it as more of a guideline for a greek salad, than as an exact recipe. I omitted the green peppers entirely.

We have made this several times and we realy like it. It's really excellent for these warm summer months. Only problem is that there is always extra and it doesn't keep well. And yes, i used fresh oregano even though "true" greek salad uses dried-why used dry when fresh is always better?

Allison Ford Ft.Wainwright, Ak I loved this salad. I prefer the feta crumbled on top. Made for guests we had over for dinner. They raved about the salad more than main dish!

The reviewer below me sounds like a crazy road lizard. What's with all the jargon? This is a great salad... I make the dressing the day before and refrigerate... add more oil.

Tzantarakis sez: no oregano. ?!? Jeez, all the greeks I know put oregano on EVERYTHING. The only things I would change with this would be to specify *sheep* milk feta, and be sure to use greek E.V. olive oil. Oh and maybe sardines or anchovies on the side ;-)

Gourmet Greek Salad? It may be gourmet but not strictly Greek, bar the feta. Has the cook been to Greece? Where's the lettuce & vinegar as for cherry tomatoes & oregano, pah! Feta should be placed on top of the salad & broken & shared by those eating.

A pretty good salad but it needs some additional help. Try adding 1/2tsp of capers, radish slices, 2 flat anchovies per person and the most important ingredient of all, Red, Ripe, Roma tomatoes. As my father used to say, It's not a real salad without tomatoes.

I'v been making Greek salads since joining the "comunity" back in '84. This is a good classic salad reciepe with one exception, you forgot the fresh garlic. We also add boiled potatoes during lent and, the feta is almost always served on the side with fresh bread, bread, bread. opa!!

A nice variant to the traditional greek salad. I would definitely make this again......the bell pepper giving the whole thing a nice crunch. Maybe next time a will use 3 different coloured peppers for added flair.

It sounds really good, but you put in on 4 plates and serve 6--who has to share?

The best part of this "Greek" salad recipe is the presentation - it makes the feta the "star of the show". My most requested Greek salad also contains pepperoncini peppers and sliced radishes and my knock-out dressing has equal parts red wine vinegar AND lemon juice, dried oregano and thyme, and GARLIC - I'll stick with mine, thank you.

The results of this recipe depend 100% on the quality of the ingredients - garden fresh, ripe tomatoes and cucumbers, genuine Kalamata olives, the highest quality olive oil, and some really delicious Greek feta . . . And, of course, a big chunk of crusty bread for dipping in the juice that accumulates from the vegetables and dressing ingredients. If you've got all these things right, this can be one of the best foods you'll ever eat! Otherwise, it will just be a dull salad. (One side note, I've lived in Greece for the last 9 years and I've never seen fresh oregano on a Greek salad. It is always a sprinkling of dried oregano over the top.)

Yes, I am Greek American too. This is the classic greek salad with one exeception as noted by others. Cherry tomatoes do not have the intense flavor nor are they common in Greece. The key to this salad is the very best of in-season produce. My garden in California is now producing roma tomatoes (soon meaty beafsteaks), cucumbers and herbs. Find the best imported feta you can and dress with the best virgin olive oil. Food for the gods.

Pretty good, but I found that I liked it better, as did my family, when I added some chopped dry sausag--we like landjaeger--a couple of chopped hard-boiled eggs, and a bit of spinach, chopped very coarse.

This recipe was good but nothing really special. I added fresh greens to this and probably would make some other additions if I should happen to make it again.

I'm Greek and I agree with Judy from Canada, we usually use roma tomatoes and red vinegar for this salad. In the spring and summer months we use fresh or dried mint instead of oregano. It gives this salad a wonderful flavor. Adding the feta in the salad is a must. It absorbs the taste of the olive oil and the mint.

I much preferred when I switched the cherry tomatoes for roma tomatoes. They give a richer flavour. I also replaced the lemon juice for red wine vinegar, a truly Greek experience.

Simple, and tasty. Is there anything more one could ask for in a recipe? I realize it's an oxymoron, but I think it's about time Gourmet went back to basics!

This is definitely my favorite salad. Absolutely delicious. I, too, serve this on a bed of lettuce. Pita on the side is nice too.

Great recipe! I served it on a bed of red leafy lettuce, and I just used crumbled feta cheese on top of the lettuce to go under the Greek salad.
