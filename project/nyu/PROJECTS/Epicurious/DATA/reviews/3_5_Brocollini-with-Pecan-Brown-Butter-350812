So, maybe we can all come to a consensus. Is it broccolini or brocollini? Title is one way, body of the recipe is another. Even the reviewers are of two minds about it.

Being able to blanch the broccolini ahead of time made this a great recipe for the holidays. Our pecans got a little too toasty in the pan so next time I will only toast them a bit before putting in the pan and let the pan do the rest of the toasting. Frankly, the hardest part of this recipe was finding the broccolini!

Fantastic. I added baby bella mushrooms and used walnuts instead of pecans. I will abolutely make again...next time with pecans.

I made this for Christmas Day dinner and everyone loved it. I changed it up a bit since we had a vegan at the dinner table, instead of butter I used olive oil and it was still delicious!

I made it with baby bok choi, since no brocollini could be found. The browned butter gave the greens great depth and sweetness. I didn't rate it since I didn't use brocollini, but I would give what I made 4 forks.

Easy to prepare ahead of time and delicious. I cooked the brocollini ahead as directed and refrigerated. Toasted the pecans as well. I added sliced Crimini mushrooms to the garlic and butter and then added pecans and brocollini. I served as a side with the Pork with Gorgonzola recipe, plus mashed potatoes. Fabulous!

If you search on Google, you will find about 102,000 entries for broccolini, some with pictures. Wikipedia says it's a natural hybrid of broccoli and Chinese broccoli,not young broccoli or broccoli rabe. I haven't made this, though it sounds really good.

Delicious!I kept the pecans whole and that added great texture & visual interest.A nice take on my families' Italian greens! Can this be made ahead of time with success? I hate last minute dishes to fix at a dinner party.Does it reheat well?

I thought this dish was delicious, and I don't like broccoli! The flavor was great, and I left out the pecans, and it was perfect without them. Brocollini is a cross between broccoli and chinese kale, for anyone who is wondering.

I thought this was so so and probably wouldn't make it again. Or maybe it wasn't a hit with me because the beef tenderloin and horseradish au gratin potatoes that I served with it took center stage!

This is good - I do prefer the flavor of Broccoli Rabe over Broccolini as I find it somewhat bland. Nope - they are not the same - Broccolini is a cross, between Broccoli and a Chinese Brocolli,

emeisel, this vegetable is known in the US by a number of names, with broccoli raab being the most common. That is the name you will find in the food dictionary. If you are unable to find this vegetable in Mexico, broccoli may be an alternative ingredient for you. We thought this preparation was delicious!

I believe broccolini is young broccoli.

Simple and tasty- we cooked the broccoli ahead of time (at this time of year, I find that boiling is a better bet--sometimes they can be a little bitter, and although steaming helps preserve vitamins, it also preserves the bitterness more) I also browned the butter and nuts ahead of time, adding grated garlic towards the end. A snap to reheat and salt at the last minute to put on the table. Simple but deep flavor--our guests were convinced that there must have been something else besides nuts, butter, and garlic!

Quick, easy and tasty - just as the other review said. However, left out the garlic - the shallots were plenty and since the butter had to brown worried the garlic might get that "burnt" taste. It wasn't missed and the result was a hit even with the kids @ Christmas dinner

What is broccolini?? Living in Mexico it's hard to find things that are not even in your "food dictionary". Emiliano -- Emiliano's Cocina in San Miguel de Allende

Broccolina better steamed than boiled. Do not overcook. Quick, easy & tasty.
