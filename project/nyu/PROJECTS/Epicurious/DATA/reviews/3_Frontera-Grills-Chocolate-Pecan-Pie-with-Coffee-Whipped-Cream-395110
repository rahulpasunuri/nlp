Did not like this recipe. Too sweet. Chocolate pecan pie does not need all the added ingredients of this version.

This pie is exceptional! I originally got the 10" recipe from Rick Bayless' web site and have made it many times. The recipe has been in several BA publications since 1991. I've taken this pie to many dinner parties because it was requested. It always gets rave reviews so be prepared to share the recipe. Rich, delicious, and a bit different; leaving you wanting more of 'that' flavor.
