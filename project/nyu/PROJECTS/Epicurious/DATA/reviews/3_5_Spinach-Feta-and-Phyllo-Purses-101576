A hit, to say the least. I, too, used fresh dill and mini phyllo cups. Really a very nice, basic recipe. Don't hesitate to jazz it up, but don't add anything too salty, as it's just about right in that respect as it is.

I also use this with the mini phyllo cups-- it makes about 40. It's also a really good filling for calzones. I recommend fresh dill instead of dried.

I doubled the recipe and used mini phyllo cups. Served at a Christmas party & they were gone. Everyone loved them.

This was a great finger food served for a party. Instead of making purses I rolled these up into little cigars. Also added a little freshly ground nutmeg like traditional spanokopita.

So good! I had to stop myself from eating all the filling. I only used one package of frozen spinach and it still made 30 (I cut the phyllo exactly as directed) - they were very small. I would recommend using some fresh dill if you have it. I made them ahead of time and reheated and it worked out great.

Very good. Will definately make again. I used the sheets the size they were when they came out of the package and just rolled them up and baked them on parchment. I will add a little salt and a very small amount of red pepper flakes the next time. A welcome additional to my Greek food suppers. A keeper!

I used the phyllo shells and added toasted pine nuts and parmesan as suggested. Added salt to the spinach mixture. Used mozarella because that's all I had. Cooked at 375 for about 20 minutes. Very easy. Very good - I'd make it again.

Huge success at my party, but I followed other reviewers and used phyllo shells. I also put parmesan cheese and pine nuts over mixture before baking. Everybody asked me for the recipe

I, too, use the prepared phyllo cups. One recipe makes about 40. You can make them ahead and freeze them right in the little plastic trays the cups come in--just cover them tightly. I use and recommend fresh dill. I do find they cool off quickly and they really need to be hot. They work best when people will be scarfing them down. The filling also makes really good calzones.

This was a huge success at my cocktail party. I made about seven different hors d'doeuvres and I think this one was among the top favourites. Couple of comments: Firstly, the dill was not apparent to the taste, maybe add more next time. Secondly, I had also made phyllo shells for another recipe. That recipe had called for butter to be brushed on the phyllo instead of olive oil, which this recipe calls for. I found the butter worked much better. Next time, I will probably use melted butter to apply to the phyllo.

These are great appetizers, but instead of making the phyllo purses, I used premade phyllo shells. I just put the spinach mixture in the shells (each shell is bitesize) and added parmesan before baking. They were much simpler and were great appetizers!

there are so many things you can do to maximise this recipe - adding toasted pine-nuts, a pinch of nutmeg, or adding an egg to the mixture to bind and enrich. you can also add parmesan and ricotta, which will make the recipe much richer, or goatcheese and/or marscapone, which is what i would recommend.

I used this recipe to embellish one of my own. I added a tad of red pepper flakes, a bit of grated munster and placed the filling in prepared phyllo pastry cups. They freeze very well and were gobbled up quickly at a holiday brunch I hosted. I have made them twice and will definately make them again....especially since they can be made ahead.

Use a potato ricer to squeeze the water out of the spinach. Easy, fast.

These are great. Use an excellent brand of Feta--next time I will follow one reviewer's suggestion to use half Feta and half goat cheese. The only pain was drying the spinach, but that's never fun. I made flag shapes instead of purses, and I always use melted butter on phyllo dough. We quadrupled the recipe and they freeze very well.

WONDERFUL! All my guests raved.... To the previous reviewer: I cannot imagine WHY you'd make the recipe, if you "hate spinach and really don't like feta." Do you understand the review/rate concept???

I hate spinach and I really don't like feta. I would not recommend this to anyone.

I used this recipe differently. To finish up my early crop of spinach, I prepped the filling as is. However, with the phyllo, I rolled out in the shape of a streudel. Thus, the ratio of filling to phyllo was almost 5-1 (filling). I sliced on an angle in the shape of a log, beautiful presentation. Also, made small scores in top prior to putting in the oven @ 375 until golden brown. Served as an appetizer & people just kept cutting more for themselves. This way, I alleviated the need to worry about refilling plates etc, additionally, my guests enjoyed it once it had cooled off & was no longer hot.

I thought the filling for these hors d'oeuvres was very good and easy. I crumbled the feta (attempting to grate was messy and unnecessary). Making the purses was kind of a pain. I'm pretty anal about visual appeal, and wasn't satisfied with how these were turning out. I made a few, then decided to roll up the remaining filling in sheets of phyllo, bake, then cut into bite size pieces. So much faster and easier! I used cooking spray to cut down on fat - still tasted just as rich as oily/buttery phyllo.

my guests loved these. i also added the garlic. you will definately need to use the extra sheet of phyllo or they rip. also if you haven't used phyllo before it dries out very quickly. i made the filling into little balls of about 1/2 tbls. first then got out the phyllo. made about 65 servings.

This dish was easier than I expected to make. I like the ability to freeze and reheat later. I used the suggestion for using Pam, and it worked just great. I added some chopped garlic to the pan while the onion was cooking to improve the flavor of the spinach.

A bit bland for my taste although several of my 60 guests liked them. Not a favorite, though; I ended up throwing away more than half when the party was over.

This was a wonderful, and fairly easy, appetizer. It's so much more innovative than your normal triangle-shaped spanikopita. I used half goat cheese and half feta, and the taste was great. You can make the filling ahead of time and then whip up the purses in about 10 minutes. One tip: use Pam instead of olive oil to spray each layer. It is so much faster, and you don't risk tearing the phyllo dough.

I was living in the States when I made these appetizers back in 1988 for a reception and they were a big hit. I don't know how many people asked for the recipe. Now I'm living in Cairo, Egypt and still are a hit every time I make them and I am asked for the recipe here as well.

This is a great recipe. I will make it again. I don't know where they get that it makes 30 it made about 70 for me. Phyllo is eaiser to work with when you don't over stuff it. easy to make too!

These were such a hit at the party I took them to, I wish I had made a double recipe. They disappeared almost as soon as we put them out on the serving platter, and everyone who managed to get one raved about them. Phyllo is always a bit of a pain to work with, but it's worth it! Definitely a keeper.
