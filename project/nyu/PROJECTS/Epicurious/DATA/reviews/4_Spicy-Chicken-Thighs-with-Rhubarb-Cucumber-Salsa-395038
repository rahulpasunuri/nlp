Super delicious, sweet & savory dinner. I substitute celery for the rhubarb, just because rhubarb isn't consistently available in my neighborhood. It definitely adds an earthy flavor against the sweet, light dressing of honey and lime juice.

I toned down the heat and did not make the salsa, but this is a different and very flavorful rendition of baked chicken, a nice addition to the recipe box. The method would be a winner with other sauces, too.

Although I enjoyed the "different" flavoring of this dish, it was not a big "hit" at my table. Also, it was not super kid friendly. I imagine a more experienced chef would yield better results (comments) and I did prepare the dish ahead and reheat it...

I didn't have rhubarb so I substitute it with sweet yellow peppers. It came out delicious! I grilled instead of baking and use skinless boneless chicken thighs. My kids loved it!

The only change we made to the recipe was that we grilled the chicken. Besides that we followed it line for line and it was absolutely fantastic! Best dinner we've made all summer!!

This Salsa is the Bomb!! Used chicken legs with backs attached because they were on sale, but like another reviewer I removed the skin to reduce fat content. Didn't read the instructions very well and did not process sauce but left coarse and used as a marinade. Also used 2 jalapenos like other reviewers. Also grilled instead of baking and the chicken had a lovely flavour all through it. Did flare up a lot though due to oil. Had fresh rhubarb from the garden and made salsa as written. Both hubby and I enjoyed it a lot. Very easy and quick recipe with lots of flavour. Will keep portions of rhubarb frozen so this can be made all year.

I used a half habernero pepper as it was a large one and maybe that was my problem. This dish just did not have enough heat as I anticipated. I let the thighs marinate several hours in the fridge and also scored the the thighs. The rhubarb=cucumber salsa was very good but the main dish was lacking in flavor. Disappointed.

Easy and delicious. I marinated the chicken overnight, up the garlic, and sub habanero for serrano bc that's what I had at hand. I highly recommend this.

This recipe has amazing flavor--we loved it. The only problem I had was that the smoke from my oven was taking over my entire house and that was with all the windows open. I guess the combination of the higher temperature and the fatty skin was too much for my stove vent. Anyone else have that problem? I'm thinking next time I will grill the chicken outdoors, or take the skin off. Maybe both.

This was so good I'm making it again tonight, even though I had to substitute tart green apple for the rhubarb. Can't wait to try it as written!

Outstanding - followed recipe ingredients exactly, but baked at 450 for approximately 30 minutes and the skin was fine. I can imagine substituting celery for the rhubarb would be fine - but not as good- if you don't have rhubarb, I would substitute with something citrus.

Yum! Used boneless, skinless thighs, cooked for about 15 minutes. The salsa was absolutely perfect with the flavors. Good use of the rhubarb which is prolific in the garden. I too used a jalapeno pepper and it was spicy enough.

I marinated the chicken*, not the skin! Doh!

First at foremost, this chicken rub is AMAZEBALLS! Like a few of the others below, I used a jalapeno pepper in lieu of the suggested. I just really enjoy the flavor of a jalapeno more than the other peppers. As a test, I removed the skin from some of the chicken to spare myself a few grams of fat (the nutritional info on the recipe said 39g per serving and that is just entirely more than I want from one piece of chicken). I actually marinated all of the skin in the sauce for about 30 minutes prior to cooking. Like someone stated before, why let all of that sauce go to waste? Both the chicken with and without skin turned out marvelously, so I you're skeptical about taking the skin off, don't be. Just make sure to keep a closer eye on it in the oven. My grocery store was out of rhubarb for the day, so I opted for celery, since I read in the reviews that what others used as a substitute. I must say, I'm really NOT a fan of this. It's not bad, but it's not something I would ever make again. Would love to try it with actual rhubarb at some point, though!

Really good...used a jalapeno pepper because I am a sissy. Asked one of the employees at Wegman's if rhubarb was out yet 4/25, he said he'd look in back. He came back with several beautiful slim stalks.Basted the chicken halfway through the baking because I just couldn't see wasting the extra sauce.

I almost never give 4 forks, but between the ease of this recipe and the flavor factor, I had to rate it exceptional. I did use @ 5 cloves of garlic and a jalapeno pepper to make it a little less spice, but man does it make the chicken flavorful! Could not find rhubarb so used frozen corn and everyone loved it. Can't wait to try it with the rhubarb next time.

Just made the salsa, it makes a good salad.

Simple, easy and delicious. Substituted frozen sweet corn for the rhubarb and used 1/2 lime juice. Really good salsa.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I could not find fresh rhubarb so I used celery. I will make this again. Very simple too.

The flavors are fantastic but I'm a free range whole chicken gal. The first time I cooked this I cut off the thighs but it was so much better when I roasted the whole humanely raised chicken with the sauce. I roasted it frozen at 400F with the chile, garlic soy sauce until it is 165F. So much moister and easier. The Salsa is great on fish as well. What a great way to welcome spring!

This is really delicious! I too was skeptical about the raw rhubarb but it was really good. I used whole skin on chicken breasts and legs and cut them to the bone as the recipe instructed and seared the chicken on our gas grill then transferred to a baking dish and finished on the top shelf of the grill. This is a great chicken recipe and I will be making it often!

I made this exactly as written. It was so interesting and unique that I am making it for company this week. I serve it with coconut rice or orzo, and fresh, gourmet red and yellow cherry tomatoes. It's truly beautiful and very healthy.

Used a hot red pepper in place of the habanero (we dont have any super hot peppers up here) and celery instead of rhubarb. It was great! The chicken sauce was SOOO good, really surprising because of the relative simplicity.

Great recipe and very simple to make! I was also unable to find rhubarb in March/April so I substituted with celery. The celery/cucumber salad was very refreshing with the habanero chicken. The spicy of the habanero wasn't overpowering and I would feel comfortable serving this for a crowd, without having to worry that it would be too hot.

Ridiculously easy. Couldn't find rhubarb in March, so I substituted with a 1/2 pint of gooseberries which I diced. Also added 1 tbsp of sesame oil to the marinade. I anticipate this will become a weekly staple.

I served this with the lemon rice in the same issue of Bon Appetit and both were really good! I never ate raw rhubarb but it was surprisingly mild and fresh tasting. I used a bit less hot peppers for my taste but the combination of flavors was delicious--and easy to prepare.
