Mighty yummy! I used what I had available and got something better than expected. I used half & half and milk instead of heavy cream. No ricer so I used a potato masher instead. Also no food processor so I used a blender. I did have 5 large carrots on hand (not sure of weight - probably more like 1 pound instead of the 2.5lbs. the recipe called for). I had the gold potatoes, unsalted butter and salt. Used more than 1/4 cup liquid in the blender with carrots. Also used more than 1/4 cup liquid in last step. The time it took me to make was longer than 1 hr total time... But then most things I attempt in the kitchen take a little longer! Really yummy and easy too. Highly recommend.

I wish I had read the reviews before making this, as it was bland. I think sometimes cream minimizes the flavors of vegetables, and milk is a better choice. I saved the dish by drizzling with really good white truffle oil.

Perfectly easy and yummy, but a few extra steps compared to regular mashed anything. I would give it four forks except I also added two cloves of roasted garlic and about a teaspoon of chopped fresh rosemary. The ricer does make the potatoes perfect! I do think without any additional herbs or a hit of flavor it could be a little bland. Glad I added what I did. The color is amazing.

Awsome dish. You can add some roasted garlic and rosemary to spice it up a bit. The sweet and creamy taste makes it a good pairing with steak au poivre.

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was very colorful and rich. We were afraid that it would be to carroty, but it wasn't. I don't think it needs any improvement

Nice and colorful variation on mashed potatoes. How could it not be good with butter and cream?

I would have given the recipe as written two forks -- good and worth making again, but not exceptional. Adding a large chopped jalapeno pepper and a few teaspoons of chipotle powder gave it added flavor and some heat that, for me, boosted it to the three-fork level.

I have made this recipe twice for my family and will definitely make it again. It is so easy to make and not much more time consuming to make than a lot of other "faster" foods (this is important when I get home from work to hungry kids). I made it ahead of time one day and it was still delicious. I did not have fresh carrots one day so I used frozen -- it worked great. I didn't have heavy cream so I used half and half, also just fine. The best thing about this recipe seems to be that it is forgiving. Exact measures don't seem to make that much difference as the basic ingredients are all yummy. This was my first try at a recipe from epicurious and I'm going to try some more.

i made this as part of the pork chops and hard cider menu w/ the watercress and endive salad - this was the only part that was worth eating, in my oppinion. thank goodness it was extremely worth eating! it's beautiful, fun to make (pushing the potatoes thru the strainer? a first for me!) and velvety smooth perfection in the mouth.

I remember eating this dish all the time when I was an exchange student in France (many, many years ago!). My host mother would make this with a meat entree and salad for our warm lunch quite often. Dessert was often fresh peaches, sliced and put into a small glass with a little sugar and red table wine. I found this to be a pretty good replica of the dish my host mother would make. Thanks epicurious!

I made this according to the recipe. It was very easy and very good. Made it with the Roasted Pork Chops with Hard Cider Jus. Absolutely wonderful. Even one of my guests who doesn't like vegetables ate it.

YUMMY!!!! I made this for a dinner party and everyone just loved it. The beauty of this recipe is that it is so straightforward, yet not your everyday side dish. This one will definitely get made over and over.

Absolutely wonderful. I made it exactly as the recipe was written. I got rave reviews from my guests and also a perfectly empty serving dish! I will definitely make this over and over again.

Sounds good, but need to know quantity of carrots, please.
