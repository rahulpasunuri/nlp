Yum! Will definitely make this one again. As other reviews have stated... 20 minutes is way too long to roast at 400! I checked 'em at 12 minutes, and the little ones were actually a little over-done. When I make it again (which I will!) I'll check at 8 mins. I added pepper which was a good addition - next time I may salt a little too.

Classic. Tastes great. Kids and hubby love it. I have made it many times--but do use good olive oil. If you use Canola or any other oils it will be awful.

I can never roast asparagus correctly. The taste is good, but they get too overdone and they're hard to eat. I like the taste, but prefer the texture of grilled asparagus.

I make this all the time, especially in the summer when we're grilling. It's always well received, and it's a very robust recipe. I also like to swap out the lemons for oranges, which changes it up a bit.

while i liked this quite a bit, my family members at thanksgiving were less enthralled. perhaps the lemon did not mesh well wtih other flavors.

These are great!!! A wonderful, quick and easy side dish. Be careful not to overcook the asparagus, since they will lose their crunch. My husband doesn't even like most veggies, but these he eats and loves!!!

I've never tried this exact recipe, but I do roast asparagus with lemon and olive oil quite frequently. I've always loved my asparagus still crunchy. All you have to do for it to remain crunchy but still have that wonderful roasted flavor is watch it carefully. I would only cook it for a few minutes, probably eight tops.

What a colossal disappointment! My family had been looking forward to this ever since I found the recipe, and what we got was a limp, discolored vegetable that didn't taste the least bit like asparagus. I'll stick to the steaming method where it turns out tender-crisp and a lovely bright green.

Fast, easy, but no great shakes. I recommend you use lemon as much or as little as you like, depending on your own preference. Husband liked it. We'll make it again because of the convenience, but it isn't whoop-de-doop special.

The "fork" rating system here is a bit skewed towards the favourable - one fork should be "unpleasant to eat", not "just so-so". One fork (my version) is certainly how I found this dish. It was lemony to the point of fakeness - I had one spear and tossed the rest. I also agree with the comments on cooking times (I baked for 15 minutes at 400, which was fine for texture). As a sidebar, I made this as part of the '02 V-Day menu, and I don't think a lemon asparagus dish is a good match for the other flavours in the menu (not to mention that the proportion is off).

Like others, I cooked for only 15 minutes and would check at 12 minutes. I had 20 people coming to my house in 1 hour and needed a second vegetable. I had enough time to make two separate times as my oven couldn't hold two all the asparagus. It was fast and easy. Received nice feedback. Next time I would line the pan with foil for easier cleanup.

A very no frills, no fuss way to get a dish done when all your burners are full and delicious to eat- perfect

I also used balsamic vinegar (instead of the lemon juice) after cooking the asparagus with olive oil, salt & pepper. My asparagus only took 15 minutes to cook to the crisp tender stage. Its important not to overcook them for the best flavor and texture. The dish was extremely easy to prepare and very popular with my dinner guests.

Simple and delicious way to prepare aspargus. I used the lemon zest, olive oil and salt during the roasting period and then squeezed some fresh lemon juice on just before serving for a fresher tast. Note: Because aspargus comes in varying thicknesses be sure to check them every few minutes so they don't overcook.

Rating: 2
I adore asparagus, so I was disappointed not to like this recipe more. Mine were fairly thick and took about 20 mins. Usually I steam it for 5-6 mins. in the microwave and sprinkle on lemon juice and salt. I am going to try roasting one more time with the balsamic vinegar variation on this site.

This came out well using asparagus that was on the thin side. I cooked it for 15 minutes, stirring once midway through. Much more flavorful then steaming and adding lemon afterwards.

Very good... and this coming from a group who generally despises asparagus. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Probably the only way I'll serve it from now on :)

I thought the asparagus cooked this way was just terrible. Although tender crisp, the flavor tasted "over-steamed." This recipe was the only blot on an otherwise delicious dinner.

This dish was awesome. VERY good. I added chopped garlic (2 large cloves) and shallots (2). Quite tasty. A keeper.

WELL, Some recipes are just bad... You never really know why, but some recipes manage to get written wether they should or not. I was a little hesitant just reading it, but decided to give it a go anyway. It just doesn't work.

What a great way to cook asparagus. Steaming can get so boring! I loved how the spears stayed bright green and the lemon was a nice accent. I tried it again on the grill and it was just as good!

I used a non-stick roasting pan and it made for a very messy clean-up. I think I must like the texture and flavor of asparagus better when it's steamed--seemed a little too limp with this recipe and the flavors were just so-so.

a standard for me since finding this recipe. i have reduced the oil to 1 teaspoon and it's still tasty. lemon rind makes it.

This is a great new way to prepare asparagus! I added some minced shallots for extra flavor and it came out fabulous. I highly recommend this.

This was excellent. I happened to use very thick stalks, so there was no overcooking. If the stalks were thinner, I would have reduced the time. The amount of lemon was perfect for our taste!

Far too lemony and the recipe calls for roasting too long. They overcook. This one is a dud.

Rating: 4
Great alternative to steaming and now my favorite way to prepare aparagus! So simple, and comes out perfect every time (I have not had the problems with overcooking mentioned by other reviewers). I have learned however to serve immediately as the asparagus absorbs too much of the lemon flavor if allowed to sit too long after cooking.

Okay, I've converted. Roasted asparagus is the best! This is a great recipe, although I'd cut the lemon juice a little (too sour) and toss in some minced shallots like some other reviewers suggested. Delish!

I made this to accompany Grilled Chicken Brochettes with Red Bell Pepper and Feta (Bon Appetit, June '97), and it was a great compliment to the dish. So simple to make, and a nice alternative to simply steamed asparagus. A keeper.

I love asparagus, and I love roasted asparagus. However, this dish, although very easy to make, was nothing to write home about. I will definitely experiment with different herbs and seasonings.

This recipe is definitely a "keeper" in my repetoire. So easy - especially when I can find very thin asparagus. And delicious! However, it is necessary to keep careful watch as cooking time will vary with thinness of asparagus.

Roasting vegetables (esp. asparagus) is now a staple in my kitchen- half the time I don't even use lemon, but adjust the spices depending on the vegetables used. ie oregano for Italian flavor, etc. Delicious!

I will never steam asparagus again--it comes out so much better roasted! I like it with the amount of lemon juice called for in the recipe, although it does come out "quite lemony"!

Yum! Until I discovered this recipe my husband would only eat asparagus if I made hollandaise. For a little different variation omit lemon juice, add some minced shallot and sprinkle with a little balsamic vinegar.

So simple to do. My wife raved about it although it was a little acid for my taste. I agree a little grated parmesan makes it more interesting.

As a lifetime member of Weight Watchers, I need to try new recipes and ones that are light and simple. I don't particularly care for asparagus, but found petite asparagus and this recipe was great! I added fresh basil to it as well...adding it into the recipe 10 minutes into the roasting! Thanks!

The texture of the asparagus was good and the preparation was easy, however the lemon flavor was to overpowering. I would use the cooking technique again but change the flavorings.

Just wonderful. Easy to make and a terrific change from steamed asparagus. I have made it twice in two weeks and plan on keeping it a regular dish in our home.

For an asparagus lover, this is a simple, elegant recipe that discourages the time-saving use of the microwave. The roasting brings out the delicate flavor of the delicious vegetable the way no shortcut can. If you use very thin asparagus, I recommend cutting the cooking time to 10-12 minutes. Also, I could not resist adding two cloves of minced garlic to the basting juice. Yum!
