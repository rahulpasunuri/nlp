Used the potato puree as base, topped the puree with grilled tuna; spooned ragout over the tuna. Excellent. Used half shiitake, half button mushrooms. Crisps took longer and higher temperature; next time I will make them thinner.

This is one of my favorite recipes and is perfect for a special, and meatless, meal. While the crisps are a nice added touch, they are a little time-consuming and fiddly to make. If you skip them, the recipe is rather quick and easy. I have also found that the mushroom ragout benefits a bit from sitting so make it ahead of the potatoes and just warm it up before serving.

tasty, but more complicated than its worth

The shiitake ragout really makes this recipe. It probably can be used to dress up any other bland dish. I will add more roasted garlic when I make it again.
