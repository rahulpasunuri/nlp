Very good, hearty, healthy main dish, especially for a winter weeknight meal--not fancy in any shape or form, but very, very good. I did cut down on the orange juice by half, because I was afraid it would be too sweet, but probably would have been ok. Used fresh squeezed OJ. Served on soft cheddar jalapeno polenta, but would have enjoyed the crunch of the crispy polenta. Good meal.

I made very minor changes to this recipe. I halved the OJ and did not rinse the beans--just used the whole can with the liquid. I added smoked paprika. That said, this recipe rules. It's one of the yummiest things I've ever cooked, and I cook a lot! I serve it with cheesy jalapeno polenta, plus avocado and sour cream as suggested. I will definitely make this again.

Way too sweet! I wish I had switched out the orange juice for broth, or even beer.

Reading through the list of ingredients on this recipe, I'm sure you'll agree they seem to be quite unlikely companions! The orange juice just adds a wonderful, yet undetectable, balance to the spice. My auntie discovered this outstanding stew while looking for a dinner suitable for our family of many dietary restrictions... this recipe also duplicates well, if you're cooking for a large group. Aside from the sour cream garnish (which is a delicious accompaniment) it's completely vegan, though you'd never guess it! And yet, so delicious even the meat eaters in the crowd will be asking for seconds and thirds! In our big family, we often just make a big pot of the polenta poridge and don't bother with making the triangles. Both ways, everyone will want the recipe! The avocado and sour cream garnishes are a must, but skip the oranges (it also makes this enticing stew much more mysterious when they can't guess that secret ingredient!).

For anyone interested, this worked really well in a slow cooker. I added everything at once and cooked it on low all day.

My family and I love this Recipe. We made a few changes after reading the reviews. Added about 1 cup of water to thin out and cut the orange, added two cans of diced tomatoes with juices. Added 1/2 tsp extra of chili powder, and 1/4 tsp extra cumin. I'm sure the recipe is great just like it's printed but this is what made our dish. Had to make the polenta from scratch. Next time I want to add some diced pickle jalapeño to the polenta to give it an optional kick of heat. Well the polenta took an hour to make, but I have alot of it and have been using it for a lot of things since... Oh yeah I made polenta fries instead of triangles.

I made this for a few friends on local election night with some homemade bread, a salad and an apple crisp. Perfect comfort food for an otherwise dismal evening. Everyone loved the soup and most people had seconds. I made a double batch, and followed the recipe except used packaged polenta and served it on top of the soup with avocado and sour cream instead of on the side. I was worried that the poblanos would make it too spicy, but they added the perfect flavour. Will make this soup again and again.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I whip this recipe up frequently for dinner parties and it is met with rave reviews! I always top the stew with your suggested avocado and orange slices with a dollup of sour cream! This is one of the BEST vegetarian recipes I have ever made and it makes my friends and family happy with full tummies! Laurie:)

Loved this recipe and my husband felt it was the best I've ever made. Of course, I never follow recipes to a T so made my own minor changes. In addition to the yams, I cut up carrot and celery to add to the mix as I like to sneak as many veggies into meals as possible. I also added a can of organic diced tomatoes. I sauteed a pound of ground chicken with the onions. I used jalapenos instead. Because of the additional veggies, the two cups fresh oj was not enough so added chicken broth to my desired consistency. The oj with the sweet and hot veggies and seasonings was out of this world. Adjusted seasonings as needed but used the same ones only more...Delicious!

i love this recipe as is. adding the avocado makes it exceptional.

I have a recipe that uses red wine vinegar (not OJ), caper, and cilantro (without the chili) but otherwise similar; and I like that recipe better. This was somewhat disappointing. But my husband and I like the polenta triangles. So I will probably make the polenta triangles with the other recipe if I wanted to make something with black beans and sweet potato again.

Rating: 0
DELICIOUS! i didn't have any poblanos handy, so i used two orange bells and one yellow bell pepper. i added in part of a little jalepeno, also. i didn't have any sweet potatoes, so i cut up half of a butternut squash. i added a little extra oj and water to the soup, because it was very think. i made the polenta triangles: yummy, but perhaps better just to make some cornbread? but the soup itself is fantastic. i would definitely make again.

This is a keeper. Not only is it tasty, it is pretty. My kids thought it looked like a nice fruit salad ;-) My only change was to add 2 cans of diced tomatoes, because I wanted to make it more soupy than thick stew. It was still quite thick.

Great comfort food that's relatively healthy. I subbed a chipotle for the poblanos for the sake of convenience. Also served with rice since I didn't feel like making the polenta.

I treated myself to this one night so I could enjoy the left overs. I added a chicken breast and used guacamole instead of the avocado. I almost skipped the polenta but it was so easy to make it while the stew was cooking it seemed too lazy to skip and I'm glad I made it.

This was really good, kind of different. I liked the sweet/spicy combo. I followed the recipe as it was and made the polenta as well. I served it with a piece of polenta on top and a dollop of sour cream. Next time, will probably serve over brown rice.

I found this recipe when I was looking for something to cook for a Gluten-Free house guest. I followed it to a T and it was amazing. Very filling and very flavorful. I never would have thought to add OJ to a stew. I now cook variations of this recipe all the time, sometimes serving it over quinoa and with a fried egg and a little cheese on top.

I love meat, but didn't miss it here. Also halved the OJ (used fresh squeezed), skipped the cumin, and substituted one of the cans of black beans with cannellini. At the end, used a blender stick to get a more stew-like texture.

We really loved this. I only made one change by using canned chipotles instead of the poblanos. Even with the full amount of OJ it was great. The polenta triangles really put it over the top. We liked it so much we ate leftovers the next morning with scrambled eggs!

I must admit, my husband picked this out and I was skeptical. But it turned out scrumptious! The OJ and the ginger combo really worked, followed the recipe to a "T" - came out great. I omitted the orange sections, kept the sour cream and avocado. The polenta triangles were the perfect accompaniment. A keeper.

i have made this twice now. i used jalapenos instead. good stuff. got requests for the recipe.

I think I used a little too many beans - I used 2 cups of dried beans - and a really large onion that probably yielded more than 2 cups chopped. I used fresh squeezed oj and ended up with a little over 2 cups and it didn't seem to be enough so I added a little bit of veggie broth. Oh, and I roasted butternut squash cubes in the oven and stirred them in at the end and it was delicious. I would have used sweet potatoes, but I had a squash that needed to be eaten. I don't think the oj made it too sweet and I can't imagine using less liquid. I know it's a stew, but it seems to need a tad bit more liquid. Will definitely try it with the sweet potatoes next time to see if it makes much difference.

Rating: 2
This is tasty and easy to make. I will add this into my recipe rotation because it is healthy and quick but it wasn't so great that I just had to have more. I did make the polenta triangles which were a nice accompaniament. I might cut the OJ in half next time.

Rating: 4
A delicious recipe!! And so easy to make! Maybe go easier on the OJ, &/or go heavier on the poblanos for a more robust stew, but regardless, it has turned out great every time I've made it!

I have made this quite a few times, but only last night did I bother making the polenta triangles. They are perfect with the stew! Contrary to other reviewers, I always use the full amount of orange juice and haven't had a problem with it being too sweet. I have made it with both poblanos and chipotles and I, too, prefer the chipotles, although you could probably add both... hmmm... I should try that. Any combination of the suggested toppings works great. I will make this again and again and again - and I will never omit the polenta triangles again! Like other reviewers I thought the recipe for the polenta appeared bland, but now I believe this is intentional so it will support, rather than compete with, the flavors in the stew.

Rating: 4
Loved this! I'm making it again tonight (made it last week and didn't get sick of having if for lunch everyday...) I am adding jalepenos because I like more spice. The orange/ginger/cumin combo is an unexpected and tasty addition to bean chili!

Rating: 3
Tonight when I made this, I added a can of diced tomatoes, which I think is a good addition. Cilantro makes a nice herbal topping/garnish. I think this makes 6 two-cup servings of the stew, by the way. I figured out the nutritional info, and it comes out to about 400 calories, 6 grams of fat, 10 grams of protein and 70 carbs per serving, if you care. I always skip the polenta in favor of a green salad.

Rating: 4
Oh yeah, this was good stuff. I omitted the red pepper and poblano chilies (my girlfriend doesn't like fire in her food), and it was still packed with flavor and easy to make. I must say, the polenta triangles left a little to be desired in terms of flavor. I guess that's to be expected with only three ingredients (cornmeal, water, and salt). They make a good complement, but I recommend jazzing them up a little with an additional ingredient or spice.

The polenta compliment the warm soup very well. Great combo.

1/2 the OJ like th other reviewers suggest, add chipotle chiles and I blended it a little w/a hand blender to make it a little creamier. Unique flavor combo, delicious

I love this recipe and have made twice now - somehow the second time I must have used too much orange juice (maybe a half cup) I guess just a drop is more than enough for me in terms of added sweetness. I also use chipolte's in adobe. For additional protein and texture, I added some veggie sausage crumbles - not too attractive looking, but provides a more savory balance. Very yummy and filling.

Rating: 3
Terrific! I'm no vegetarian, but I love a healthy alternative that doesn't taste light. I keep dried chipotles on hand, so tossed one in instead of poblanos. Also, cooked dried beans and used 1 cup fresh orange juice and 1 cup bean cooking liquid. Worked great.

Rating: 4
Delicious, hearty, sweet and spicy stew. It's nice to find a truly filling vegetarian dish, rather than having to rely upon a selection of smaller, lighter dishes as I usually do. This will definitely become one of my favorite chili recipes, as it's so unique and easy to make. The aroma is tempting and the textures are creamy and satisfying. I used pre-made polenta, which turned out just fine. I think when I make this dish in the future, I will definitely substitute chipotles in adobo for the poblano peppers; I think the subtle smokiness of chipotles would really add to the dish.

Just made this today, on a snowy Sunday. Delicious, hearty, healthy, sweet-hot stew. I think the trick to making this stew work is the right balance between sweet and hot. I made it with roasted poblano chiles I've had in the freezer since last September's farmer's market. I've learned that chiles really vary in temperature, so I used somewhat less than what was called for in the recipe, and was glad I did. I also was a little short of black beans, so threw in a few garbanzos as well, and I really liked the color contrast they gave the dish! Kernals of corn or yellow summer squash could provide a similar hit of yellow. I'm serving it with corn bread today, will try the polenta with the leftovers (made a double batch!)

Rating: 3
Like another reviewer, I always use chipotles in adobo sauce when I make this, mainly because they're easier to find than poblanos. I also think they add a smokey richness of flavour. I cut the orange juice in half too, but compensate for the reduced sweetness by adding a little honey or sugar. We really like this dish.

Rating: 3
I've made this a few times, but never can go back to the orange juice. For a more savory, satisfying dish, lose the orange juice and roast the chiles poblanos - they will not be hot, just buttery earth. Add cilantro on top with crema and you will enjoy this, especially when you cannot take another bowl of chili but still need to warm up. Polenta pulls it all together.

Rating: 2
This recipe was a great disappointment for me. I love black beans. I love sweet potatoes. Even the reviews had me intrigued and excited for this dish. The taste was just rather blah. The only thing that came through was the heat. Perhaps my poblano peppers were too big? But really they aren't that hot as compared to others. I took others suggestions and used half water and half orange juice. I wish I had used all orange juice. That could have made a difference. Either way I won't be trying this again anytime soon.

Rating: 3
Very good! I was skeptical--the combination of ingredients seemed a bit odd--but it came together quite nicely. I made a few changes: I used half OJ and half water, as another reviewer suggested. I also browned the sweet potatoes in a little hot oil first for depth of flavor, and sauteed the bell pepper and garlic with the onion.

delicious and easy. i followed the suggestions and put half orange juice and half water and it turned out sweet enough. i hope the left overs are as good as it was tonight.

This continues to be one of my favorite recipes. The last time I made this I put everything but the black beans in a slow cooker and it turned out great (I added the black beans about an hour before I served it). I've also served it with brown rice as sometimes I think polenta is too time consuming to make.

Rating: 4
Tasty! I followed reviewers' advice and cut the orange juice in half (replacing it with water) and I think it was the right choice. It was still sweet and I could taste the essence of orange. I enjoyed this dish because of its many flavors and textures. I had to substitute a jalepeno for the two poblanos, and it was still spicy enough. I will definitely make this again, and I'm looking forward to the leftovers!

Rating: 4
I have made this many times since it first appeared in the magazine, and have been asked for the recipe over and over. The combination of sweet, hot, and earthy flavors is wonderful. The OJ really affects the overall flavor, so use judgment -- may want to add more or less depending on how sweet your OJ is. Diced avocado is my favorite garnish. Yum!

Rating: 2
We liked this quite a bit, although neither of us really understood what it is. This is an easy-to-make stew, and I'll make it again if I find myself with the same ingredients on hand. I do wish Epicurious gave measurements for the salt and pepper--I have a nasty burn on my tongue from trying to make sure this was properly seasoned!

Rating: 3
I love this. Great flavors. For once I follwed the directions exactly, except that I added extra garlic and ginger, and used pre-made polenta (in my experience, it's not really worth it to make your own. The only thing I would mention is that it makes way more than four servings. I split my pot into six servings and found these to be quite hearty portions. This freezes well and reheats well in the microwave or on the stovetop.

Healthy recipe, simple to make. I used thai chiles which made it a bit too hot to taste some of the other flavors. I doubled the recipe and added lots of cubed tofu for protein and a different, interesting texture. Next time I won't drain the beans in order to thicken the stew.

This was a very tasty stew but I thought the orange juice made it a bit too sweet. Next time, I'll use water and perhaps some lemon juice. I served it with rice instead of polenta, which worked very well.

I have two other recipes similar to this, so I sort of combined them with good results. I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and minced garlic. I also used less OJ. I thought it was delicious, but lacking texture, so I made a pot of brown rice and served this stew in a bowl topped with a scoop of brown rice. perfect! surprisingly good.

A simple recipe that gives a lot more taste than it would seem. It can take a lot of trifling with and still produce a wonderful mix of flavors. I'm not so hot on this particular polenta recipe there are a lot better in the search file. A great dish for a cold rainy night.

Really good! More like 3.5 forks. I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes so I substituted roast butternut squash instead; it worked very well. Instead of the poblanoes and chilli powder I used a couple of chipotles in adobo, and I added a green pepper. Make sure that you use either use freshly squeezed OJ or something good like Tropicana, this really makes a difference. I also followed the suggestion of garnishing this stew with avocado, orange segments and sour cream -- yum yum--

Rating: 2
I used green pepper instead of red, only 1 can of beans, an extra 2 cups beef broth, and dried chipotle and cayenne powders instead of the chiles. I also added cubed sauteed coriander-pepper pork at the end as a garnish along with lots of cilantro and plain yogurt. This made it a little more soup than stew-y, and I served it with a whole-wheat corn quick bread. Very healthy, but my husband pronounced the resulting broth "wonderful," while he picked out every cube of sweet potatoes.

Rating: 3
This is an unusual and delicious stew. Don't be put off by the orange juice--it sounds a bit weird, but really works. I've found that the polenta needs more (in fact about twice as much) water than is specified, or else it gets way too thick right away. Add enough water so you can cook it long enough that it won't taste raw. I also never bother with the orange segments as garnish, but the avocado and sour cream really complement the stew nicely. Incidentally, this dish travels and reheats well.

This sounded so strange, I just had to make it. It has a great flavor & is really colorful. I had to go to a specialty market (Nature's) to find the poblanos, but I'm glad I did as they have a deeper flavor than green bell peppers & are a slightly firmer which allows them to hold their shape in the stew.
