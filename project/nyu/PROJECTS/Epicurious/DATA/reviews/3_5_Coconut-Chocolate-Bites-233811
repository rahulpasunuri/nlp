Well, I managed to make an easy recipe into a difficult one! I lined mini-muffin cups with non-stick foil (time-consuming) and poured melted choc into each one (ended up running out of chocolate so could only make 19 cups). Chilled and then put the coconut in, chilled and topped with more chocolate. Took way too much time, but popped out easily, and look like cute little round sandwiches. Probably should've stuck with the basic assembly but was afraid of all the cracking.

Based on all the reviews, I tried something slightly different. I made a 'quadruple' batch (I give these as gifts), but instead of using 4x the condensed milk, I used one small can of condensed milk and one can of coconut milk. Spread it flat in a large 11x17 pan (with greased wax paper on the bottom). Then - popped it in the freezer while I made the chocolate. I used 24oz of melted chocolate, then when ready used a thin flexible spatula to spread on top of the coconut mixture (you have to be quick since it will be cold). The trick to getting it to slice 'easily' is a thin even layer of chocolate. Don't refrigerate the bars yet - just let it sit until the chocolate is set. Use a sharp paring knife to score your lines in both directions first - it should be much easier to slice now without the chocolate being hard set. Then - pop it back in the fridge until you are ready to serve/plate. :) This process worked much better for me...hope this helps.

Well, the taste is good but it doesn't stay together or look anything like the picture.

I used a bit less condensed milk than called for, because it was all I had on hand. I mixed the coconut and the milk together into little balls (about an inch in diameter). I then dunked the balls in melted bittersweet chocolate and then rolled them around in more sweetened coconut. Mmmm!! I love them because they're a good size and I avoided the chocolate-cracking problems most reviewers mentioned. A bit more time intensive then just making layers, but I thought it was worth it!

I made these to give for Christmas presents. I rolled the coconut mixture into balls and coated them entirely in dark chocolate. I hadn't realized that you were supposed to refrigerate them, so I left them out all night. However, I tasted one and they are fine. The sweetened condensed milk, thankfully, did not spoil overnight in my 60 degree house. I agree with another reviewer, if I was making these for me, I would use all unsweetened coconut and possibly unsweetened chocolate as well.

Amazing! This is a favorite of everyone. We love it.

Super easy and quick. Tasty (I used lindt chocolate). Easy to cut if you don't let it chill too long - just until the chocolate is set (doesn't make a fingerprint when you touch lightly).

I use sweetened coconut and a splash of vanilla. They never cut well, but they taste delicious.

Very easy to make and very tasty. Look in health food store for unsweetened coconut. Don't expect to get 36 squares of any substantial size.

Outstanding. Quick and easy. Chcolate cracked slightly for me too but noone seemed to care. Will make again soon.

If you have trouble finding the dried coconut, check the organic section of your grocery store. Mine didn't have it in the regular baking section. These were unbelievably easy to make, will be tinkering with the presentation though as they are not so pretty. (maybe shaping into balls and enrobing with the chocolate?)

I couldn't find dried coconut, so I used frozen, unsweetened, which I think contributed to my filling being runny. I also had trouble slicing the chocolate layers neatly without the filing squishing out the sides and the chocolate cracking all over--any tips on doing that better in the future? Anyway, tasted great, even if not pretty!

Lots of requests for the recipe. Very easy. Only issue was with cutting the chocolate layer. I basically ended up smashing the bottom layer. So, they looked okay - but I did end up placing them in candy paper cups, which helped the presentation.

These were very good and so easy to make. Next time I may try another reviewer's suggestion of doubling the recipe and coating both sides.

The photo is what sold me on these! I prepared these for a shower and used white candy cups they were beautiful. I also liked how FAST these could be put together. I will most certainly be making these again.

After reading through the recipe and knowing my preference for not overly sweet desserts, I used fresh shredded coconut (just slightly sweetened) from a Thai market and Lindt 70% dark chocolate. The results were what I had hoped for. Since fresh shredded coconut is not always available, I think I would adjust the ratio of unsweetened to sweetened coconut and use 85% dark chocolate -- or even 99%! -- for future tests.

My husband who likes Mounds/Almond Joy did not care for it. But several friends liked it enough to ask for the recipe. If I attempt it again, I may use more dried, unsweetened coconut and less of the sweetened. Otherwise, terrifically easy and really nice presentation.

I love the taste of almond joy so I give you following additions. Added 1/4 t of almond extract and 1/2c chopped toasted whole almonds to the coconut mixture. Lined a mini muffin tin with plastic wrap and placed 1 t melted choc into bottom. Cooled then pressed coconut mixture into tin. Topped with remaining choc and ganished with chopped almonds. Chill and unpeel. Quick, easy and the best thing is they taste just like an almond joy. Terrific! (btw added 1 1/2 t of canola oil to the melted choc....easier to work with)

My husband, who does not eat sweets, loved this and ate all of it. Cooled too long and had trouble with the chocolate breaking.

The recipe was superb, with no need for adjustments at all! A very delicious, easy, and quick alternative to the store-bought candy bar.

These were excellent and so easy. I doubled the recipie but still used an 8 inch pan - just layered both sides with chocolate and cut. Don't chill these too long before cutting or the chocoalte will break a bit.

Delicious! Use a piece of wax paper to press coconut mixture into pan (it sticks to the offset spatula). Couldn't hurt to use a bit more chocolate to make the chocolate layer a little thicker.
