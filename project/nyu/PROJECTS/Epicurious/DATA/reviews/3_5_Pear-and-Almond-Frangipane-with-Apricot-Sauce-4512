This dish was lovely to look at and fairly easy to prepare. I made two for a large event (150 people) that I catered, to rave reviews. It's moist and substantial, and if you fan out the pears (hint, hint), it looks even more "pro".If you like rum, you'll love the sauce (again, super easy) Having said that, you can skip the rum and add something else to keep the sauce from re-jelling. Grand Marnier, a pear brandy (Hmmm!!Next time!)or apple juice for non drinkers would work.Caveat: Maybe, being from California, land of great produce, our pears are bigger, but there was no way in God's green earth that the number of pears they called for would fit in my pan.I think I used 6 and 1/2 per. Play it by ear, and peel the last couple as you need them.It was yummy!!

Next time I'll slice the pears after poaching and fan them out. The pieces were too big. I may thicken the glaze and frost. But overall easy and tasty for passover, the nice thing is the recipe needs no modifications and the nuts and fruit fit in well with the rest of the meal.

Made this recipe for a friend who cannot eat any flour. There were eight others at the dinner and the frangipane was a real hit and the sauce was delicious. Our baking dish was not quite 10 inches so the pears barely peeked through. I would recommend taking 1/2 cup of the batter out if the dish is not as recommended.

A lovely, easy dessert. I served with a dollop of fresh whipped cream in addition to the apricot sauce, which lightened the texture of the dessert, since the frangipane itself is quite dense.

Aside from peeling and coring the pears, a very easy recipe and VERY impressive to serve. Although listed as a good Channukah dessert, it is flourless, so perfect for Passover, as well as anytime pears are available.
