Bland. Lemon juice improves it but still bland.

I've make this a few times and it always goes over well, with a few adjustments. First, you can decrease the amount of simmering time if you sauteed the rice longer - about 10 minutes. Second, treat this more like risotto than pilaf. I start simmering with 2 cups of liquid and add as I go - I've never needed anywhere near the 7 cups the recipe calls for.

Way too much liquid. It ended up turning into mush, and I had to throw it away. I was worried it was too much liquid, but figured they knew what they were talking about. I was wrong!

You need about an hour and a half to make this recipe, but that is wild rice for you. It starts off like a risotto, ant the end product was very creamy.

As suggested in earlier reviews, I added 2 cloves chopped garlic with the chopped onions and then added mushrooms (6 oz., 3 oz. sliced & 3 oz. chopped) after the onions were slightly browned. Also added 1/4 tsp. dried rosemary. Thought the results were okay, but not special. The best part was the sliced almonds sauteed in butter. One point: Those who thought the rice was too wet or too mushy might not have noticed the instruction to drain the rice before serving. This isn't like regular rice, which is supposed to absorb all the water.

As recommended by other reviewers, I added rehydrated porcini mushrooms, fresh rosemary, fresh sage and minced garlic in addition to the almonds toasted in butter and sautéed onion. It was bland and really only the taste of wild rice came through. Thats fine, I like wild rice, but I expected something more.

The suggestions below about adding mushrooms and fresh herbs are a must. I added sliced creminis (1/2 cup) while cooking, and some sage and rosemary. Then I sauteed about 2/3 cup with the almonds to add at the end. I only used 5 cups liquid (all stock but a combo of chicken and vegetable) and it was perfect. Loved the almonds and will add this to the fall staple menu!

I made this as a side dish for Mother's Day and it was a big hit. I was worried I'd have too much so I took other reviewer's advice and halved the recipe. Boy I wish I hadn't! I wanted leftovers but didn't get any. The halved recipe served 6 adults and 1 child. Love the texture!

I made only 6oz of wild rice and it was enough for 6 servings (used half of the liquid). Added garlic, rosemary and thyme. Also added dried cherries with the almonds. Very good!

This is so simple, and so good! I followed advice and added fresh rosemary, then served this as a bed for grilled fillets for Valentines Day. It was perfect!

I realized from the other reviewers that this was a recipe I could play with a little. My kids don't like onions, so I sauted carrots and garlic in the oil, and added fresh parsley toward the end of the cooking time. Mine was done in an hour, but the wild rice is labeled "quick cook", so that is probably the difference. I served this as a side dish to grilled chicken; they went together well. I liked the nutty flavor of the rice.

This was very tasty (and addictive). It's extremely difficult to overcook wild rice, so I left this on the stove for about 4 hours to get more of a risotto. Easy and certainly something I'd make again.

halved this recipe and it was a great side-dish. nice nutty flavah. added garlic at beginning and a touch of wine plus rosemary and thyme for simmering phase.

I halved the recipe, and it still took FOREVER to cook. I added sliced baby carrots for color, plus also minced garlic (both to the olive oil, before the rice is added)

Absolutely add about 20 sautéed mushrooms to the original receipe. Add the mushroom juice from sautéing, about a 1/4 cup (adjust the recommended water in recipe accordingly). Add the mushrooms to the cooking wild rice. Vegetarian alternative - add 1/3 cup miso paste and 3 cups water instead of chicken broth. After I made the dish I thought about a tablespoon of fresh sage would have been nice.

Halved the recipe and still had WAY too much. It was too wet -- took forever to cook, and then it was mushy. I'd drop the amount of water, definitely. It could have used some more flavor, and next time I'll probably add mushrooms. Probably also try some seasonings during the saute. I too toasted the almonds in the oven with no butter, so next time I'd probably use butter instead of olive oil to saute the onions and rice, for the flavor.

This turned out great, but the recipe seemed a little dull, so I added a finely chopped clove of garlic in with the onions at first. Then I took about 15 mushrooms, chopped half very finely and sliced the other half. I sauteed these in about 1 tsbs of butter and some salt while the rice was cooking. Also, I baked the almonds on a cookie sheet in the oven at 400 degrees as I've had better success with them toasting evenly like that in the past (but keep a close eye on them, they burn easily). When the rice was done I stirred in the almonds and mushrooms and lots of salt and pepper. This all turned out great, but the rice does take much more than an hour and a half to cook and I had much more than 6 servings. However, the leftovers go very well with some browned hamburger.

First off, I halfed this recipe and STILL got servings for six as a side dish, which it should definitely be. Does not have the pizzazz of a main meal. Sauted onion in only 1 tsp. of oil in a non stick pan. I also added 1 tsp. of salt to rice as it was cooking and added at end. Needed lots of salt and pepper. I toasted almonds without butter too. perhaps if I added the butter it would have been a 4, but didn't want to chance it for the extra calories and fat. I think if you added a box of frozen chopped spinach half way through cooking, it could be a whole meal. Also, it needed at least an hour and a half or longer! I think I would add lots of minced garlic next time around too. But definitely put some salt in while cooking, otherwise it is like an afterthought.
