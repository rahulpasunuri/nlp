Absolutely scrumptious. Makes for a lovely hearty fall or winter meal. For some reason, the walnut stuffing seems to disappear quickly when I make it... I will probably double the stuffing in future!

For neatness, I used this recipe with chicken breasts rather than whole birds. I just pushed a knife into the top of the thickest part of the breasts and packed the cavity with the stuffing, then closed it with toothpicks. I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter **remembering to baste regularly**. My guests were bowled over with it - delicious!

This is one of my favorite recipes from epicurious.com after using it for almost eight years.

everyone complains about this recipe saying the pancetta dries out but if you bother to read it through you'd know enough too baste it diligently then the problems you experienced would disipate like the liquid you neglected to baste with,its not 4 forks but it is not hot garbage either dont tear it down because you are not attentive enough

I pounded out chicken breast to 1/4 inch and then spread the stuffing over the chicken, added the pancetta and rolled up and fixed in place with toothpicks. I then pan seared and roast in the oven. I added a molasse bourbon sauce. Hugh hit with the family.

Perhaps not fair to add a review since I used an 8 pound turkey and cooked the stuffing separately, but the flavors were just wonderful! Did 1-1/2 amount of the stuffing recipe and baked at 350 for 40 minutes in a buttered dish. Perfect. Great crunch. For the turkey, I put herb butter under the skin, topped with pancetta, added some white wine to the roasting pan (along with carrots and fennel). Wow! The basting kept things moist. The pancetta was deliciously crispy and not burned. The carrots & fennel were very flavorful!

I doubled the recipe (roasted 2 chickens just about 7 lbs each) and I tripled the stuffing and still was not enough. Stuffing was excellent so plan on making a huge batch, put some in chicken and bake some in a separate dish in the oven. I did not use the fennel. I feel like the pancetta did not really give much flavor. I put some under the skin and some on top, the pancetta on top of the skin did not burn i think beacuse it was sliced pretty thick. Will definitely make again with alot more stuffing!

Had this for Sunday Night dinner. The group loved it, I too put the pancetta under the skin of the chicken along with fresh herbs. They loved the stuffing, I should have made extra.

I made this recipe a few nights ago and was pleased with the result, but not blown away. The stuffing was excellent, and once done roasting the chicken I mixed in the fennel with the stuffing and was rewarded with wonderful flavors. What I am going try the next time I make this dish is place the pancetta between the skin and the chicken, so that it doesn't dry out and burn in the oven, and hopefully maintain more fat. This recipe could use some additional herbs to rub the chicken with. All in all, good dish.

Fantastic recipe. I'll definitely make this again. The pancetta added great flavour and the stuffing was phenomenal! Rave reviews from guests and not a speck left over. I did add the fennel at half time rather than at the beginning of the roasting process and threw in some baby potatoes then too. Perfect.

Great recipe, would keep the fennel in larger pieces and add extra to the stuffing. Deglazing the pan with stock and white wine after also made for nice sauce.

This chicken was flavorful, moist, and DELICIOUS! The pancetta on the top flavored the chicken well, but it definitely burned before the chicken was done. Also, I would NOT add the fennel with the roast. It did not taste good because it cooked way too long. You can skip that. The walnut stuffing was so delicious. The whole meal (peas, mashed potatoes, and chicken) from the magazine reminded me of a springtime thanksgiving.
