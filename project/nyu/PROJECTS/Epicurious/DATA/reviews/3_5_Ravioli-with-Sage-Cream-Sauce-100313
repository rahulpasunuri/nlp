Surprisingly delicious for how easy it was. The sage didn't overwhelm the dish, it just tasted yummy. I cooked the sauce in a wide skillet an extra minute to thicken it a bit more.

Very good. Measurably improved by also sauteing a diced portabello mushroom, which added more flavor and texture. Grate some fresh Parmesan, preferably a young, mild one, some pepper and (kisses fingertips), Yum.

I love this recipe. It's super fast and really tasty. The butter pecans make it. My girlfriend loves it so I make it for her all the time as a quick weekday dinner.

Delicious! Used cheese tortellini instead of ravioly... walnuts/pinenuts instead of pecans

Rating: 1
Edible but not good. The sauce was more like soup. The wine needed more cooking or perhaps some starch to thicken as it tasted like wine-soup. Not even sure if I should take it to lunch at work tomorrow. Under the influence and all that... Will not make again. Yuck.

I found this recipe just for the sauce to pour on top of my Italian Sausage Stuffed Apples that I thought were really blah and needed some oomph. I followed the recipe except added the wine by itself to give it extra time to reduce. This was exactly what the doctor ordered!

I doubled the sauce and it took quite a while to reduce it. It's a good sauce. I did't think it warranted twice as many pecans when I doubled the recipe. 3 1/2 stars.

We just finished dinner and this was good. Not great because of my mistake, after cooking the pecans I forgot to sprinkle on top... Otherwise it is an easy flavorful pasta dish that I will make again. Easily a weeknight dinner and although I used cream I think you could sub 1'2 & 1'2 or milk and reduce a little longer. I used a frozen squash ravioli from whole foods that was amazing. The dish was rich even without the nuts. Very satisfying with a spinach salad.

This dish is by far our new favorite on this site. The flavors are amazingly intense. I used chicken stuffed ravioli from Costco and I have to say the combination was perfectly paired. Add the pecans to the top and it was divine.

Good sauce, easy to make. I tweaked it here and there like everyone else, and would reccomend to try it.

A totally easy recipe with good taste. I used 2% milk instead of the cream, so our sauce wasn't quite as rich or creamy. But I think the compromise was probably worth it. We used cheese tortellini and substituted walnuts for pecans. The nuts make this recipe.

I really enjoyed this sauce. I think that cutting down on the amount of wine used as suggested by previous reviewers is a good idea. I will use less wine next time I make this, but I will definitely be making it again. I served the sauce with fried ravioli, and it was fantastic.

This was a delicious and easy entree to fix. I would add more fresh sage next time, and top with the nuts, parmesan, and extra chopped sage to add color. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I used it with Butternut Squash Ravioli. My husband loved it.

this is a quick and impressive meal that I have already come back to again and again for something simple (quick) I can throw together for guests. I have not found a need to reduce the amount of wine, but to boil longer.. basically reduce to taste. A real winner!

Rating: 4
This was easy and delicious! My husband raved about it. I used the suggested amount of wine but let it cook off for a significantly longer time period until the sauce was quite thick and creamy, then added the ravioli. I used spinache and ricotta ravioli and might add mushrooms to the sauce next time.. definately a hit!

Rating: 4
This recipe is rich & wonderful! The shallots had a slightly sweet taste in the dish, and that blends nicely with the sage & pecans. I added the wine before the cream, boiled off the alcohol, then added cream and reduced. I couldn't find vegetable ravioli, so used 4 cheese ravioli instead. It worked fine.

I too followed the other users suggestion to cut the wine in half and it was perfect. My boyfriend is now craving this dish every night. I'm definitely going to make this again.

Anybody have any issues with the cream curdling? I'm using half and half, which I know curdles faster than cream due to the low fat content but...this has never happened to me before.

This dish required minimal effort and is a great way to showcase fall flavors. I fully agree with other reviewers that you either need to reduce the amount of wine or let the sauce reduce longer. Next time, I would add more sage. I used fresh sage but it was difficult to detect. Some reviewer suggest skipping the pecans but I think they are a must. I think the sauce pairs best with butternut squash, pumpkin or sweet potato ravioli.

Liked it, pretty easy. Had to substitute pignolas for pecans (allergy) and added a little salt. Also, I ended up blending the whole thing; I must not have gotten the chop right. But the flavors are all there.

Followed many of the previous reviewer's suggestions and was pleased with the results. Added a little flour to the butter, shallot, sage mixture to thicken. Reduced the wine by 1/2 and added it first to the pan to reduce before adding the cream. Also added a little salt & pepper. Served with lobster ravioli. I would make this again.

I made this for a small dinner with friends, and it was delicious and very easy. I used a butternut squash ravioli, which complemented the sage well. Surprisingly, I would likely use a little less wine next time -- it seemed to overpower the sauce a bit, and I never could get it to reduce down as far as I'd like. Still, the dish got rave reviews from our guests.

Rating: 3
I used this recipe as a base to make a sauce out of leftovers! I tossed in some chopped leftover grilled portobello mushrooms, grilled apple slices, scallions, and a splash of apple cider. I have a pot of sage on my deck so I used both fresh and dried to amp up the "sagey" flavor based on the other reviews. I served the sauce with pumpkin-filled ravioli topped with parmesan shavings for a perfect blend of fall flavors. It was very bland before my additions, so I'll continue to use this as a conveyance for more assertive flavors.

Rating: 2
I agree with the others, too much wine. I also reduced mine by half. I think I will make this again next time, but reduce the wine a bit before adding the cream. It's simple and good - kind of basic.

Rating: 4
Yum. Use fresh sage if you have it, it really adds to the sauce. Asparagus ravioli with this is delicious. I did use fat free half and half instead of the heavy cream... I know, a sin, but I'm watching my health. Tasted diving. I think next time I might use walnuts to spice things up.

Rating: 3
I thought this was a wonderful recipe. I made it with a nice pesto tortellini and it came out very good. It was a little heavy on the wine, so next time I would put about 1/2 cup in instead of 3/4 cup. Then, I would add a little flour at the end to thicken the sauce up. In my version, I served with some shrimp that were sauted in a little butter. Next time, I would add 1 or 2 cloves of corsely minced garlic to the shrimp, but it was a welcomed addition.

Rating: 1
The recipe has possibilities as this is a classic sauce, but as written it is not very good. Unfortunately I made it for my boyfriend w/o doing a dry run before hand AND without checking other reviewers' comments on this website. What a disaster! Next time I would make a roux so the sauce thickens nicely, and cut the wine to 1/4 cup because 3/4 is way too much for the delicate flavors. The amount of shallots could also be cut down a bit. I served it over pumpkin ravioli which imparts a sweetness that will go well with the savory nature of this sauce. In short, there are better, more successful recipes for classic dish.

Rating: 4
This recipe is fabulous! I served it at a dinner party and everyone raved. By increasing the recipe to 8 servings I found myself adding a little extra sage and a few more scallions for added flavor and also adding 2 teaspoons of flour to thicken at the end. Great - one of my new favorites!

Rating: 3
I made this with Butternut Squash pasta and liked it enough that I will definitely make again with the fresh sage in my garden. After reading the other reviews for tips I decided to double the butter, fresh sage, white wine and wh. cream. I left the sauce on a slow boil to reduce for about 30 minutes. I doubled the pasta (entire package) and boiled for 8 minutes and it was perfect. The sauce was very flavorful...almost like a menu item in a restaurant! Walnuts work as well as pecans and I liked the shallot ingredient.

Rating: 1
Disappointing after reading so many great reviews. Could have possibilities with I few adjustments. Next time, I would cut the shallots to two tblsp as I felt they overpowered the dish. I added 1/2 tblsp of flour to the butter/shallot/sage mixture after sauteing to help thicken the sauce. Also wound up adding the whole (1 cup) carton of cream as I felt the wine flavor was too strong. Added 1/2 tsp salt too. I used portobello mushroom ravioli and a chardonnay wine.

I made this with the butternut squash and ricotta ravioli originally paired with cider broth from the Epicurious site. I also substituted hazelnuts for the pecans. It all turned out great as a company dish, although I agree with the other reviewers that the sauce as prepared is a bit thin and requires more time/heat for reduction.

Great recipe -- followed it exactly. It turned out perfect. I used a Savignon Blanc for the wine and butternut squash ravioli. Put ravioli right in the sauce and let heat for 1 min. Topped with pecans, some more fresh sage, and grated parmesan. The parmesan strips covered too much. ENJOY !

Rating: 3
This is one of my favorite sauces for ravioli! However, I think it tastes best with mushroom or butternut squash ravioli, rather than "vegetable." Also, I like to add a couple of cloves of garlic. I don't think it needs the pecans, and if I do use them, I think that they taste just as good toasted, chopped, and sprinkled on top.

Really good and easy, but sauce takes about 20 minutes to reduce; definitely give this a try.

Delicious and fast. Made this for a dinner party I hosted - everyone loved it! I used half and half cut with a little soy milk and used tarragon instead of sage. Was just rich enough. I would have loved to have used a squash filled ravioli, but lacking the time to make my own and not finding any at the grocer's, I used riccotta filled. Can't wait to make this one again.

Rating: 4
What a delicious and easy recipe! I made it exactly as directed, and it reduced to a perfect consistency. The recipe didn't stipulate to add the pecans back in, but I assumed they weren't used to just flavor the butter, and added them with the tortelloni (which I used in place of ravioli). I wonderful, fast meal for weeknights.

Wow! I love stuffed pasta sauced with something involving sage, and this was absolutely delicious! I'd make it again tomorrow, if I could. I doubled the recipe and my husband and I both devoured it. I used a goronzola-walnut ravioli, and will go with something milder/sweeter next time - the strong flavors in the ravioli detracted from the wonderful taste of the sauce.

Wonderful flavor. Made this with gorgonzola and walnut ravioli. Used walnuts in the sauce in place of pecans and added some thyme as another reviewer suggested. Only used 1/2 cup wine and wished I had used the full 3/4 cup. My sauce reduced and slightly thickened nicely. I added the walnuts 3 minutes into the reduction time and at 5 minutes it was perfect. Great fall dish. Easy but elegant.

I've made this recipe as written many times and continue to love it. I use a good quality white vermouth and fresh sage (the one time I used dried sage my husband and I agreed it was on the bitter side). Adding the wine a minute before the cream seems to extract more flavor from the sauteed shallots and sage. Five minutes reduction time- it's OK to really BOIL it as long as you stir frequently - seems about right for a sauce that clings to the raviolis without being sticky. So easy and so elegant!

Rating: 3
I just finished making this, and the sauce seems a bit thin-but, I read some of the reviews and it appears that I'm not the only one to experience this. I think next time I'll use less wine, and reduce the sauce for much longer than the recipe calls for. Otherwise, this is an easy and tasty alternative to my usual sauces!

Would anyone like to recommend a white wine to use in this recipe? I used a very good Chardonnay, but the flavor was too strong. I must also agree that it calls for too much wine. I'd start with a 1/4 or 1/2 cup. Also, it definitely needs more time to reduce. I used butternut squash raviloi from a great Italian market and I'd highly recommend them. Next time it'll be perfect...

You cannot go wrong with this recipe. I've made it with squash-filled ravioli and cheese filled. It is a super easy dish, but impressive enough for a dinner party. Be sure you don't overcook the pecans when you brown them, and use good quality wine. This one is a keeper!

My husband made me wash the sauce off so he could he the plain ravioli, nuts, shallots and cheese. Maybe it was the white wine I used, but I think that 3/4 of a cup of wine is too much for a small recipe. Also, we did not like the sage flavor.

My husband, a great cook, made this recipe and we really enjoyed it. The sauce was a little thin, but still very tasty! It is simple to make.

I agree with several of the reviewers - definitely tasted overwhelmingly of wine and the sauce didn't reduce as well as it should have. I was pleasantly surprised that the sage flavor didn't overpower the sauce and the pecans were a nice addition, although my husband thought they weren't necessary. I used homemade chicken, spinach and cheese ravioli and I think the flavors competed a little bit. Next time I'll try something a little milder, like the veggie ravioli the recipe called for. My 10 year old son gave this recipe two stars, my husband gave it three, and I.....?

The sauce was very good. I made a few changes: I let the onions carmelize for about 20 minutes before adding the sage. I also added some fresh thyme which added a great flavor.
