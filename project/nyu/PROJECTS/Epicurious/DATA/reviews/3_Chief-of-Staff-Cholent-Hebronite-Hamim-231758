This would have been a nice beef stew without the addition of all that sugar, which I am sorely regretting. It's not needed to caramelize onions, and nothing fails to go with sugar like beef.

I also like to put whole cloves of garlic in cholent...turns out nice and tasty when roasted with the rest.

For the people who are concerned about how to serve: there are 2 schools of thought. One is to omit the cheesecloth and cook everything together which is the eastern european way of doing it. Then fish out the eggs, let cool and shell and serve them sliced on the side as garnish. The middle easter way is to fish out the cheesecloth bags and serve the barley and rice on the side in seperate dishes and the kishka too if you are using it and the egg too and then serve the (cholent) stew in a big dish.

Excellent. The only change I made was to use about 6 large onions and cut down on the brown sugar, as I they were sweet enough to caramalize on their own. Very traditional, but it had the eastern spices that are different to my palate, as my family is from Russia. To those wondering what to do with the grains, Cholent is usually served on a large platter. Put the in with the cholent and let it all cook together. You end up with beef flavored rice, grain and beans, grain flavored beef and a flavor of browned onions over everything.

The recipe is incomplete. When ready to serve, what do you do with the two bags of grains?
