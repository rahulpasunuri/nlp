let me start with the fact that my husband would rate this 2.5 forks, i'm rating it one. Some of the problem might be the pkg of dough i used, I used Trader Joe's pie crusts, they fell apart, not nearly hearty enough. Also, I was hoping they'd taste like something my British neighbor used to make, they didn't. I added the whipping cream as called for, maybe a touch less than the 1/2 cup, I would NOT use this again, I couldn't stand it. Also, if I did it again I would use less butter. I think with the amendments of a more suitable pie crust and less butter, no cream, it would have been a 3 fork rating, MAYBE.

Subbed turnip for rutabaga - poor choice in my opinion, will use rutabaga next time. Had a bit of a culinary disaster since I didn't cool the mixture completely. I thought that 30 minutes on the counter would be enough...WRONG! The sauce was too liquidy & that caused the pie crust to disintegrate. Ended up putting half the mixture in corningware dishes & topping with a biscuit mix (like a modified pot pie). I really enjoyed that. Used a slotted spoon with the other half of the mixture so that there wasn't as much liquid for the other pie crust -- thought the meat was a bit too dry. Oh well, lesson learned...follow instructions next time!

I am the one who submitted a pasties recipe to Bon Appetit. THIS IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE VERSION I SUBMITTED, and is not a traditional pastie as I know them. My father (Frenchy) was from the UP in Michigan. This was a family tradition, however, really not meant to be a quick recipe OR to contain any cream. Apparently, the magazine took extreme poetic license in order to get something into the "quick to make" category. Sadly, I have not ever tried this version. The version I submitted takes and hour to cook, and contains no cream or garlic. This is a beloved memory...my dad used to take the pasties to my grandfather (who worked on the railroad). A tip: yes, butter on the crust and ketchup on the filling...only time I use ketchup.

My husband and I are both from Northern Michigan and grew up on local pasties in town. These definitely reminded us of home. We thought these were delicious. Followed the recipe exactly. We look forward to eating them again when the snow starts to come down .

Based on fairbanj's review I tried this - again, I was something easier and quicker. It was very OK, we ate them all and enjoyed them. Not authentic, but passable. I grew up on the pasties from Marquette bakery on Third St. in Michigan. BUT I have yet to find another recipe that does include my Yooper veggie of all time: the humble rutabaga. Could not bring myself to add garlic, or cream, though, but did add a bunch of fresh, coursely ground pepper as Mqt. Bakery used to. Absolutely edible, in a pinch, and when you are craving a pastie (with ketchup, of course.) MUCH better than the Gourmet recipe from 2001 ("Copper Harbor" edition) which listed mushrooms AND garlic in the recipe and no suet in the homemade crust. Why make it homemade, without the suet, if you're going to go through all that trouble? Heading to Champion/Lake Michigamme soon, and hope to score some real stuff on the trip to our yurt!

Just a note. My grandma used to make pasties and for years I tried to make them and they always came out terrible even with her recipe. I finally discovered the secret is the Suet used to make the crust. It quite simply makes the whole dish. I'm going to try this recipe as well, because I need something easier to make and suet is hard to obtain somtimes, but you can't beat it when it's used.

The cream is necessary and I believe is the secret ingredient I have been searching for. Don't leave it out!

I am from Michigan and so I have tried many pasties. These were wonderful and easy. Served with gravy, they are very satisfying.

Rating: 3
Ok folks. Why downgrade your rating for a recipe that you haven't tried or haven't prepared according to the directions? These little pasties aren't the same that my Grandma made but they are really quite good (unless you don't like rutabegas--in which case add extra carrots or potatoes). I make this recipe often even though I grew up on the Northern Wisconsin variety.

My boyfriend whose mother is from Cornwall declared these pasties "gorgeous" - translation - delicious!! I'm a reformed vegetarian so I used double the veggies - which did not hurt the recipe at all.

Rating: 4
I am from NE Minnesota and pasties up here are traditionally made with carrots, potatoes, beef and rutabagas. However, I have had pasties with pork & beef as well as without carrots. Heck, I've even had breakfast pasties. No, not traditional, but still good. This is one of those recipes, where pretty much anything goes. I make mine with a homemade crust and no rutabagas - but only because my boyfriend doesn't like them. I serve them with both ketchup and gravy to give people a choice. They are absolutely WONDERFUL!

I left out the cream, it just didn't seem right, and seasoned the beef well. But it was still kinda blah. I Even the kids weren't too excited.

Mr. pastyman from New Milford, Is it possible to share your pasty recipe? I went to Michigan Tech and had some wonderful pasties. I since graduated and left Houghton. The ones I tried later didn't taste half as good. I would really apprepriate if you would share the recipe. Thanks. Bin

Ok.....I read the recipe. Didn't make it. Anyone that would use "cream" is in the wrong Pasty World. My mother, rest her soul, should probably be in the Guiness Book for making the most Pasties of all time. She was a Hot Lunch Cook in the U.P.(Channing Michigan) which was a Railroad town. Pasties were not a novelty, but a necessity for survival. She literally made 1000's of Pasties in her lifetime. Estimates are that she made at least 50,000 or more Pasties(low estimate) whether it be for her family or for local fundraisers($1.00 per Pasty). She passed the recipe on to us. We moved to Connecticut 12 years ago and make them a couple times a year. One of our traditions is to make a batch on Super Bowl weekend. We just finished. No cream. No carrots. Home made crust. With Crisco. Round steak...Rutabaga(not called turnips) onions, potatoes, and SUET. Yes, SUET. Maybe you've heard of her, but Millie Olson knew how to make a pasty. Frenchy's......I'm sure yours taste good, but with all due respect, what you are making is in the Pasty family, but a distant cousin at best. I won't tell you that it's a secret recipe, but in Dickinson County Michigan, this is the way we make a Pasty. Thanks for reading.

We were hankering for a nice homemade pasty, so I decided to use up the leftover beef roast in the fridge and try this recipe. It was perfect. Exactly what we wanted without a lot of fuss. I followed the directions to the letter ( except that I used leftover,cooked roast beef), and it tasted just like the ones we buy up here in Northern Michigan. Serve it with homemade applesauce and a green salad. It is a wonderful Saturday supper!

My father (rest his soul) was French Canadian. My Uncle is English. Dad loved his pasties with catsup (horrors!) on them. Dad came from Northern Michigan. Uncle liked his pasties with good gravy on them. And then there is my mother-in-law (rest her soul). She was also from Northern Michigan. Catsup was the sauce used on hers, also. I think this is a great case of whatever you like or whatever your Mom made is what is good. Hey! I'm putting catsup on mine! And cream? My Momma taught me to try everything. How does one know that it won't work unless one tries it.? If it doesn't work, don't do it again! :)

I was born and raised in the Upper Peninsula and, as a Yooper, I can vouch for the relative authenticity of this pastie. I have never had one made with cream, however, this adds great flavor. Don't discount this on reviews alone.

Rating: 3
Cutting the veggies to similar size really helps. The rutabegas maybe should be cut slightly smaller because they take longer to cook.

Rating: 4
I am rating this recipe "4 forks" not because it is a dish beyond compare, but, to counteract those people who have "be-rated" this recipe and never even made it! The recipe title is NOT "Frenchy's 100% Authentic Cornish or Finn Pasties from the Michigan UP". Give it up, folks! I made the recipe (with carrots and cream), enjoyed it and will make it again. I'm not from the UP, Cornish or Finn; but, I do know how to spell rutabaga! (100% authentic spelling)

Rating: 3
Philestine that I am, I decided to jazz the recipe up a bit with red & green bell peppers and yellow hungarian pepper in the saute, then I added roasted and chopped anaheim and pasilla chiles, grated monterrey jack and crumbled bacon to the filling mixture. It may not be an authentic pastie, but I'm ok with that...

Rating: 4
I made this recipe as listed. I have served it to several people and never had left-overs! This is an easy recipe to make and turned out the same each time I made it. I was raised on the Iron Ramge in northern Minnesota and my mother made something like this. This was ever as delicious! The only addition I would suggest is gravy over the top.

My Goodness I haven't seen such a fuss over a humble dish in a long time. I also was from the UP (Ironwood) and I've had pasties there many ways. My girlfriend's mother used mashed potatoes; I never had carrot or parsley; I've had more ground meat than whole; there was never a trace of pork. I made some yesterday and looked today to see what this site had to say. I used a suet crust and pre-cooked the rutabega, onion and potato. I used both ground beef and sirloin. It was great and I haven't decided to share them with friends of keep them myself. Moral of story: You can make pasties all sorts of ways which the humble Finns and Cornish no doubt did.

JEEZ WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!!!! IT IS JUST A RECIPE!!! CALM DOWN. YOU ARE SUPPOSE TO TELL US IF YOU LIKED IT OR NOT. I DON'T GIVE A CRAP ABOUT HOW AUTHENTIC IT IS!!! SOME OF THESE REVIEWS ARE NOT HELPFUL AT ALL!!!!

I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THIS PERSON:A Cook from the Edge of Insanity on 01/03/02, WHY DO ALL RECIPES HAVE TO "AUTHENTIC" OR DONE HISTORICALLY A SET WAY??? ISN'T THAT WHAT COOKING IS ALL ABOUT, CREATNG??? DISCOVERING SOMETHING NEW?? WEREN'T THOSE OLD TIME RECIPES THAT WE DARE NOT VARY, ONCE THE CUTTING EDGE AND SOMETHING OF AN ADVENTURE??

A great meal served with Mashed Potato, Cheese and Chive Gratin and Minted Vegetable Salad, both on this site. At the risk of annoying those who want things the way they've always been, I substituted turnips for the rutabagas and used the Cheddar Crust to be found with one of the site's Apple Pie recipes. And, we all loved it. I've eaten traditional pasties in Cornwall and love them but experimentation is fun and change, good!

Rating: 3
Nearly all the reviews I read on this recipe were not very helpful as most of you had not made the recipe. You chose to condemn it instead. If any of you think you have a better pasty recipe, please submit it! Frenchy's is the only one here! I did try it and I liked it and so did my hubby. The ready made crust was a great time saver. I did omit the cream to cut out some fat.

Rating: 0
The title of this recipe is not "An In-Depth Dissertation on the Exact Ingredients Used In An Authentic Cornish Pasty" It is simply this person's recipe for a pasty. Some people might love this rendition, some people prefer their own spin. There's room for everyone.

I, too, grew up in Butte and know a real pasty. No real pasty maker would ever use cream, or pre-made crusts.

This is all wrong, I am Cornish by way of Michigan's UP. It's fine to call this a "turnover", but it's not a Pasty in my book. I've grown up learning to cook Cornish style pasties, and earned my way through college working at a Finnish pasty shop. (The Finns included rutabaga and carrots). The crust was always made with shortening rather that the traditional lard in either case. We NEVER cooked any ingredient before cooking the whole thing. I suppose the cream was added to counteract the dryness of the pre-cooked ingredients in this recipe. YUCK. My grandma used a bit of butter in her pasties, the bakery I worked at used a bit of pork shoulder meat mixed with the beef (1 to 4). If you EVER are served a pasty with ground meat in it, you have been wronged! Thanks

I too, have a Butte pasty addiction...grew up on them. Being a purist, I couldn't bring myself to add cream, use sirloin, (skirting or flank.. OR use (God forbid)... a ready made pastry. Franies rendition is OK if you're in a hurry or have never eaten the real deal. - Oh, always ketsup!

NO CREAM,please

This is a little different then the NE Minnesota regional recipe, but we adjusted it and really liked it with homemade pie crust. No cream; yes, we like carrots though.

Rating: 3
Who said pasties had to be Cornish or Michigan or other. This is "Frenchies Pasty". If Frenchy uses cream, carrots, rutabagas & carrots...good for him. I'm partial to the Butte (Montana) Pasty made with potatoes, onions & surloin or flank steak; Envelope of pastry dough made from scratch. Smother with Franco-American canned, brown gravy to eat.

Rating: 2
I agree with those who said no carrots and a homemade crust. My Dad's people from England passed down a very simple and plain type with round steak, onions, potatoes. We also cook it from the raw state. Very delicious and filling. We would make them larger and save half for the next days lunch. We have even heated the leftover pasty and poured milk on it. Very good also.

Rating: 0
I won't make this as I agree with Deborah and Doug. My northeastern Wisconsin relatives used flank steak (round will do), onions, rutabegas, potatoes, parsley and salt and pepper. NO CREAM, NOR CARROTS!! The argument there was ketchup or gravy. Homemade crust is better and not just like pie crust. Suet was used to moisten during cooking, but is not necessary!

So maybe the recipe's not authentic, but it is awfully good (and easy).

I have to agree with Doug Allen's review of this recipe. A true Michigander (especially one from the U.P.) would never use cream in pasties. This is a traditional dish for our family. The recipe also includes carrots. My 90 year old grandmother, who was taught by her Cornish mother-in-law to make pasties, has never included carrot! When I asked her about this addition she simply said, "Yuck!" I find myself nodding my head in agreement.

As a former Michigander from the UP where Pasties rule, this recipe is not correct. The authentic Cornish pasties used by the copper miners of upper Michigan wrapped in newspaper and stuffed down their jacket were much different. All the ingredients are cooked in the pastry from a raw state and no cream. I do have a recipe if anyone is interested.
