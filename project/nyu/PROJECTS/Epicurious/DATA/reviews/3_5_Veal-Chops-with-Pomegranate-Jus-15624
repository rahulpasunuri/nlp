A fantastic recipe - paired it with Soft Polenta With Leeks. I only made 2 chops but made the whole "jus" recipe and will grill chicken breasts with fried polenta this evening. A definite keeper.

The veal was tasty but had way too much thyme for our taste. I'd make this again but probably substitute something for the thyme.

This was a great dish. The flavor of the pomegranate juice accented the lamb really well.

Absolutely delicious-look forward to making it again and again. (I added lemon zest to rub!)

Peppery and sweet--a great combination of flavors. I extracted the juice myself and think it was well worth the (small) effort. Our guests thought it was very exotic. Begin the meal with cheese and a small salad because this rich dish is worth saving an appetite for!

Two tablespoons of black peppercorns overpowered the delicate flavor of the veal chops. There are much better ways to prepare this expensive cut of meat.

When I saw that 100% of the reviewers would make this recipe again, it motivated me to try it. It was Ok, but not good enough. My reason for submitting my review is to bring down the rating of 100%.

Fantastic - had to wait for all 3 kids to call and say they couldn't make it for dinner, though. Three l 1/2 inch veal chops and $30 later, my husband and had a perfect meal. Served with roasted vegetable melange of beets, carrots, asparagus and Vidalia onion, chestnut spaetle. Beautiful presentation. Folowed previous cook's suggestion and made a fresh herb pesto for the marinade.

This is a great way to fix veal chops or filet mignon. I did whisk some butter in the sauce right before serving it. Fabulous!

Changed the herb- and made a "pesto" of olive oil garlic,pepper, salt and fresh sage leaves. Rubbed the chops and marinated overnight. Grilled it on high heat on BBQ for 10-15 min, brushing marinade over it and more olive oil. Then turned down the heat to 375, and continued grilling. It still tasted juicy and great on its own without the sauce.

Quite delish. You can use dark cherry juice if you can't track down pomegranate "jus".

Delicious!! I made the sauce ahead of time and just cooked the chops right before we ate. The finished product looks beautiful on the plate. Squeezing the pomegranates was messy (wear an apron!) but other than that the recipe is very easy. Also, I found 2 pomegranates only yielded about 3/4 cup juice, so I added a little extra wine. I will definitely make this again!
