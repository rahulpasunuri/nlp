I have made this many times and it is always a delicious treat! The honey and orange together are great. I serve it warm with vanilla ice cream.

This pie is pretty simple. The only problem I had was that 8 min. for the sugar was too much and if the sugar is too deep in color it has a bitter taste. I will try it again but be more careful with the sugar. Lovely presentation.

Very nice - the grated apples made it even better than the French version which has been getting mushier over the years as real patisseries disappear. This tastes like Paris! Somehow captures the flavor, if not the texture, of the best chaussons aux pommes.

This tart is wonderfully delicious! I made it ahead for a picnic since it keeps well. It was easy to grate the apples with the blade on my food processor.

I have made this twice since the May issue came out.We loved it with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream!
