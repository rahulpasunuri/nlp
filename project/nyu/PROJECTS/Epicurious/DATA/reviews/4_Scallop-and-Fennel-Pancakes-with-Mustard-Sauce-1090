This was wonderful, and really quite easy. The pancakes would probably be very good with other proteins as well, but are great with the scallops. I followed the recipe except for subbing brown mustard seeds.

This dish wonderful! The fennel is a bit understated in the pancakes but the perfect complement to the scallops. For serving and presentation, it's worth thickening the sauce with arrowroot or corn starch

I made this as an appetizer for Valentine's day, and it was absolutely amazing! Because you can prepare the sauce and pancake batter ahead of time, it was was a lot easier to prepare than I expected. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except that I had to add more flour to the pancake batter because a lot of liquid had been released from the fennel. I served it with a dry sparkling Italian wine, and it was absolutely perfect.

My guests wanted the recipe too! Great combination of flavors and textures. The pancakes were excellent and I'll definitely make it again. This is going to be my new favorite appetizer!!!!!

Excellent recipe! I had this as an appetizer to thyme infused honey duck breasts (a very tasty dish which I will make again) and this stole the show! One of my guests stole the hard copy of the recipe on her way out. Definately worth the effort, I will make again.
