This certainly isn't a curry. It's pretty bland -except for a lot of cayenne - and has a poor balance of flavors. I had all the required spices, but the way the "sauce" is put together shows a real absence of knowledge of Indian cooking (The mustard seeds go first, and you add the other things when they pop). Won't make this again. Might be a decent vegetable stew but disappoints if you're expecting an Indian meal.

This was sooooooo yummy - I made it with the vegs I had on hand - carrots, eggplant and a pepper. I put less than 2 cups of coconut milk (400 ml) and an equal amount of vegetable broth and it was fantastic. Will definitely make it again and again, with whatever veggies are around!

OMG! This is fabulous! Could not find Curry leaves but substituted a good Madras Curry, no black mustard seeds so used brown, and I used Fungreek powder instead of seed, and it was fabulous!!! I also did not use as much coconut milk - I would add to taste. Will definitely make again... and again... and AGAIN!

I've made this recipe using the full ingredient list and also make a quickie version using only the sauce and adding peas. Quick, easy and delicious and great leftovers!

This was one of my favorite curry dishes ever and I am a meat lover -- didn't miss it at all. I added cilantro at the end.

From the first time I read this recipe I couldn't wait to make it...but... I made it last night and didn't feel like the curry flavor was as intense as I would have liked. I would definately add more spices the next time. The combination of vegetables was very nice, though. I would make it again but more the way I usually make it- HOT & SPICY! :)
