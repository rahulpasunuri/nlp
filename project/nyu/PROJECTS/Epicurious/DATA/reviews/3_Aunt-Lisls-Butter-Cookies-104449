As every one else said, it did take about twice as long to bake these. The taste was rather dull to me, but they did make for good dipping in coffee.

The ingredients and prep were easy, but the work to roll out the dough just didn't justify the final product. I found the cookies to be bland but to be honest, I probably should have expected it considering the ingredients.

To the baker from Jerome, MI... Are you saying that your recipe is better than the Aunt Lisl cookies?? I notice that you didn't comment on the ORIGINAL recipe listed. I'm not saying that your recipe isn't better, you just didn't offer a basis for comparison. I did make the Aunt Lisl cookies and they came out pretty good.

My Great Grandma Watling used to make these butter cookies when I was a kid. This is the absolute EASIEST cookie I've ever made. You only use one bowl and mix with your hands, so cleanup is a breeze. Just mix 2 1/2 cups flour, 1 cup powdered sugar, 2 sticks butter, dash salt and 1 teas. almond extract. Form the dough into one or two rolls with a 2 inch diameter and refrigerate 2 to 24 hours. Slice about 1/8 in thick and bake at 400 for about 4 minutes. This is a very basic recipe but the cookies are very tasty and tender. Because this is so easy, it's a great recipe to make with kids.

Excellent. Would not change a thing. Even my husband who doesn't like dessert ate them!

I'm not that experienced with butter cookies, but this seems like a standard one. The only unusual thing was that the cookies consistently took much longer to bake than the recipe stated.
