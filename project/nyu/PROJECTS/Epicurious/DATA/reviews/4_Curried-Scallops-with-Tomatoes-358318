Excellent and so simple recipe. I did not have tomatoes, so I used fresh asparagus that I had gently steamed. Highly recommend - and I am sure it is great with tomatoes.

Made this last night. Tried to follow recipe exactly, and it was amazingly good. Colorful, fragrant and tasty. Kept wishing for angel hair pasta as the sauce was so good, but my boyfriend is on low carb diet. My scallops were not crunchy but this did not bother me!

My husband and I love this easy and delicious recipe. We have strict self imposed dietary constraints and can perfectly tailor this recipe to accomodate our no salt and no oil preferences. The sea scallops and tomato provide the right amount of saltiness, the pepper adds an additional kick and the curry powder flavor really enhances the scallop flavor. I used non-fat greek yogurt but the water content is too high and didn't produce the creaminess, it didn't taste bad but I wouldn't use it again (maybe lowfat could work better). I served over whole wheat penne pasta.

Quick, easy, and tasty. I used yogurt with tomatoes and it was a bit soupy but yummy. I served it over cous cous. Next time I'd add some green beans and other veggies on hand and make it more of a curry stew. Very good though and quick.

Loved the curry aspect. I used yogurt which added great flavor but made the whole dish a little soupier than I would have liked -- probably should have squeezed some more liquid from the tomatoes. Easy and fast. Will definitely make again.

This is easy and very very good. The first time I made it I used Maharajah curry powder from Penzeys( expensive but worth it) and cream it was just amazing. The second time I used a much less expensive curry powder (though also from Penzeys) and Greek yogurt and though it was good, it was not nearly as spectacular as the first one. Still, a really nice combination either way.
