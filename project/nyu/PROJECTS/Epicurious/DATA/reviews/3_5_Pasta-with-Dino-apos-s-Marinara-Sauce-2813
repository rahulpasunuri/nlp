I loved this recipe, it came out delicious. I made a few changes I would highly recommend: since it's tomato season and my fridge is overloaded, I used about 5 cups of very ripe heirloom tomatoes. I used 1/2 fresh mushrooms since they are expensive and about twice the sugar. I threw in a whole jalapeño (sans seeds) and used fresh basil, oregano and rosemary. I also threw in about a 1/4 of a good Pinot. The flavor combination of spicy and sweet was excellent - use cheese tortellini! I also simmered for an hour to evaporate the excess liquid. Great, easy and cheap!

This was quick, easy, and really good.. I added sautéed shittake mushrooms and leeks and chopped black olives. The sauce was nice and thick. Excellent!

I made this recipe today. I used 8 oz. mushrooms instead of 1 pound. I had fresh basil on hand so used 1/4 cup fresh. I saute'ed chicken tenders seasoned with salt, lemon pepper and panco flakes. Served these with sauce, lot's of fresh grated parmesan cheese. delish!

I made it exactly as was written and it was excellent. Definitely more sauce than you would need for just 10oz of tortellini. I recommend 20 oz. of tortelli for one batch of sauce.

This is the recipe I use any time I need a marinara. I do substitute honey for the sugar (for dietary reasons) and add ground bison as the meat. I agree with the poster that you have to follow the directions - especially how long you cook everything. It's perfect over spaghetti squash for a low-carb meal!

Made this and two other pastas for a "carbo-loading" party for a bunch of folks who were going to run a marathon. This was definitely the least favorite of the lot. I think the heat from the crushed red pepper is weird with the otherwise light, slightly sweet sauce. I like spicy food, but in this dish the heat seemed to work against the other flavors.

I like this recipe for its ease, but I didn't find it extraordinary. I did make it with mushrooms, which made it interesting, also served it w/four-cheese ravioli. This is good for stuffed pastas, but not enough to stand on its own, especially if you exclude the mushrooms. I'd make it again but add a little tomato paste for body, maybe a little more red pepper.

This recipe turned out great.I used diced tomatoes with jalapeno and added fresh plum tomatoes.I added roasted red peppers for extra flavour.I omitted the red pepper flakes. Thank you epicurious for this web site.I am inspired to try new dishes It's fun reading the other user reviews and experimenting with flavours.

Excellent and easy. I substituted 3 tablespoons of fresh chopped ginger for the mushrooms, added a little bit extra on the red pepper flakes and loved the resulting sauce. I made it for a dinner party for the first time and will definitely use it again and again.

We left out the mushrooms and served the sauce with homemade ravioli. The sauce was quite good - the crushed red pepper gave it a nice bite.

This is actually a very good recipe when made without modifictation., As much as I appreciate modifications, they must be made within reason. Marinara sauce is ver simply onion, garlic, tomato and herb. Anything else is not Marinara... it may be a superb sauce bolognese, tomato sauce or sauce somthing else but its not Marinara. This recipe started out adding mushrooms.. which I did so it was already teetering away from Marinara. That being said, I did not find this sauce bland at all. If you rush it, I think it will be.. let those onions cook for 10 minutes without browning.. big slices of garlic,... yumm... I used a mix of tomatos.. 25% hunts and 75% Muir Glen (an organic brand which I love.. beats the heck out of the imports) and maybe my idea of a garlic clove is bigger than others.. but I found this rich with tomato/garlic flavor and just a little kick.. exactly as it should be. It went great with my cheese tortolini....

Cook from Canada: Reading the "how to" for giving a review it does say you can provide substitutions etc. I find actually that when cooks provide others ingredients they have added or substitutions it gives me ideas and makes cooking fun. Isn't this what it is all about? I am sorry that it has not worked out for you.

not so good. I have had much better sauces.We did add ground pork. Perhaps it is better without meat?

Tasty recipe! To get a more intense flavor, I used fresh basil and oregano. (I doubled the amount called for in the recipe). I let the sauce simmer for over an hour so the flavors could blend together nicely.

An excellent basic sauce. A mixture of mushroom types adds to the texture.

My husband and I love this recipe -- it has become our "house" spaghetti sauce. It has a nice consistency and is very tasty even if you cut corners (canned mushrooms, dried parsley).

Just finished making this sauce, and plan to thow it down the drain. It is not just bland (which I could doctor up) but has a funky taste to it. Made the recipe as stated, using best quality ingredients, and cannot find a way to save it! There are much better recipes out there.

We liked this sauce a lot, both taste and texture. Took other contributors' advice and cooked the sauce for a couple of hours. (I added quite a bit of Italian parsley during the simmering process.)

Excellent! I omitted the mushrooms, added sweet sausage and small meatballs, and a "little extra" fresh ground jalapeno. Will definitely make this again. It's thick, bursting with flavor, and very quick and easy to make.

I really loved this marinara sauce! I used fresh Oregano and fresh basil, very yummy!! I let the sauce simmer for about 3 hours it thickened up really nice! I also added cooked ground beef and turkey sausage and used this in a lasagne, very nice!!

I thought this was a great marinara sauce- it really had some kick to it! I left out the mushrooms just because i dont like them and used diced tomatoes instead of the italian plum tomatoes, as that is all i had. Next time i think i will cook the sauce as long as suggested, i was hungry and impatient and only cooked it for 20 minutes, so it was a litte runny. Still fantastic though!

Delicious! A tasty red sauce with some zip. I made this twice in one week - it was definitely better when I added 1/2c red wine. I also crushed (rather than sliced) the garlic, finely chopped the onion in the processor, and used tomato paste and lots of fresh basil. Also skipped the mushrooms. Found that if you cook the *whole* plum tomatoes long enough (I simmered this for a good 2 hours) they eventually break down, and the sauce was not chunky. My husband mopped up every drop with bread, and then took more bread and hit the leftover sauce on the stove!

This is the best marinara sauce I've tried to date. It was easy and very flavorful. I did the sauce exactly as written with one exception. I didn't put the mushrooms in because I was out! The sauce was not thin either. It was rather chunky, so I used my hand blender (wand) and whirred it through the sauce while in the pot, just to make it a bit smoother. Perfect. That hand held blender is wonderful. Also, I always make this as a double batch and freeze in smaller portions.

i have been making this dish since december 92. i use the diced tomatoes w/seasonings. after i add the tomatoes and juices, i add the other ingredients and skip the first 15 minute cooking time. works for me!

This was a fabulous recipe and needed very little "tweaking". Although I did increase the amount of red pepper to give it more Zing. It's not smooth like the usual marinara sauce, and the chunkyness is a nice change. I served it with homemade gnocchi and it was mouth-wateringly good.

I thought it was pretty good but it was a little blah. It could use some red wine or something. I will try it again and make some adjustments. My husband loved it with meatballs.

I liked this recipe. The sauce was very good and was the right consistency. I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of chopping whole tomatoes. I used 1/2 tsp of red pepper and didn't find it spicy at all - maybe I'll double the pepper next time. I like this recipe better than the "Spicy Tomato Sauce" listed on this site - I think this one has a better consistency. I'll be making this sauce often!

Ithought this sauce was delicious, as did my family. I doubled it and added a can of paste in place of the tomato sauce, and thought the thickness turned out perfectly. Very versatile.

I had a craving for a recipe like this and I could have bought the bottled/canned stuff, but I wanted to be creative, I just needed a start. I researched a bunch of recipes, and this one just felt right. At the risk of the wrath of purists, I changed it but followed the basic gist. I used a 28 oz can of puree, and then a smaller can of diced tomatoes, I used many more spices too, including sage, and cloves. I let it cook with a bottle of beer (yep I drank one and put the other in with the sauce). Made good meatballs with parsley and the REAL Parmesan, this all works. I believe a sauce like this needs to cook down, I let it cook 2 hours with the meatballs, and it was very good. Use the principals and then use your sense of food.

This was simple to make, but I found it the sauce to be too thin and watery. I didn't use the mushrooms, but didn't feel that it would have made a difference. I used less red pepper than called for and still found it too spicy. Not an exciting sauce.

After reading the glowing reviews, I decided to make this sauce. However, because I had no red pepper flakes in the house (and because I worried that the 10-year-old coming for dinner might not like spicy food), I omitted them. I would not do this again. Although the sauce was very good, it needs the red pepper (as other people have said). I doubled the recipe, and this worked. Now, however, I have quite a lot of sauce on my hands. Using an idea I found here, I poured most of the sauce over lightly-sauteed chicken pieces before baking in the oven.

This was a very good sauce. I used fresh oregano and basil and it came out very good. I would make this again, but next time I'll use fresh peeled and seeded tomatoes. A definite keeper!

Although technically not a "true" marinara sauce. I love this recipe and so does everyone I've served it to, (kids, sauce lovers and nonlovers). Pretty easy and makes the kitchen smell wonderfully also. A definite keeper. Some of my changes: I always double the garlic, (and the onion if I want it heartier).

This was easy and a winner. I made it to go over risotto cakes and served as an appetizer. I did sligtly run it through the food processor to chop the mushrooms and added another 1/2 teaspoon red pepper.

Excellent basic sauce. Easy to prepare. I was craving mushrooms and this was perfect. It would be a great sauce even without the mushrooms. A definite keeper. What makes this particular sauce so good is that it does not need any tweaking... one of the few recipes that's perfect as is!

Simply perfect. Great on white flour pasta as written! I'm always looking for a good red sauce for whole wheat pasta. Wheat tends to drown out most sauces and absorb moisture. Added extra crushed red pepper, and reduced the sugar (I just don't like sweet sauce, the onions are pretty sweet themselves!) Substituted dried mushrooms (presoaked) for fresh. Threw in herbs de provence in place of green herbs. Finally, kept thinning sauce with water (for wheat penne I like a very thin sauce). Mmmmm, this one's a keeper! I've made it many time with many alterations for various pasta types/shapes.
