Amendment to my review below - I baked at 375 not 350 :)

Mine came out pretty tasty for an oven "fried" dish. I would definitely make again. However, I did make some changes. It wasn't the ingredients that scared me, it was the construction. I choose to construct the dish closer to a traditional fried or breaded dish. Meaning, I marinated the chicken (flattened to 3/4") in the dairy for at least an hour and added the seasonings to the crushed cornflakes. I also did a 1/2 yogurt half buttermilk marinade to which I added 2 tsp of fresh minced garlic. Let the chicken set an hour. I added the seasonings to the crushed cornflakes and reduced the garlic powder, black pepper, and salt to 1 tsp. I dredged the marinated chicken into the cornflake/herb mixture and placed on a rack over a cookie sheet. Then gave a light spray of cooking oil over the chicken. Baked 30-35 minutes at 350. The chicken came out browned, crunchy, moist, and flavorful. Will make again.

Followed the recipe to the letter. Soggy, yuck. Sorry, just being honest.

Mine came out soggy on the bottom side that was against the baking sheet. The top was crispy. You dont need a full 2 cups yogurt. I used less than that and the thickness of it was still too much, and it spread out into a gooey mess on the baking sheet. Maybe buttermilk would be better. The seasoning was yummy but the presenation was bad and it was a little too salty/tangy because of the salt and yogurt. I wouldnt make it again.

The chicken was great. I opted for low fat buttermilk and the chicken stayed nice and moist. I did cut back a bit on the herbs as I could see how they would be overpowering. I served these to my 4 year old and he enjoyed his dinner which makes me feel good.

This was not a hit at my house! The herbs were a bit overpowering, and the Special K was just like having Rice Krispies coating my chicken. I won't be making this one again.

I cooked this for 35 minutes and the top didn't brown and the chicken was too dry.

This chicken was great. I opted for the yogurt but made sure it was just a thin coating. I breaded it with a combination of panko and the cereal and mixed in a little freshly grated parmesan - it was a nice complement to the spice. I preheated the oven with the baking sheet inside and I think that helped to limit the softness on the underside of the chicken. Overall they were great and wonderful paired with a big salad.

I subbed poultry type seasonings such as thyme, sage & savoury for the "Italian" tasting herbs. I also used Panko because I don't care for corn flakes or Special K. It was pretty good. Not outstanding. Try buttermilk instead of yogurt. Yogurt's too thick. I'll try something different next time because that's my style! :)

I agree that the herb and spice coating was overwhelming and too salty. I would not make this again unless I made substantial modifications to all three of the coating steps, including using some lowfat buttermilk, and making sure that the cereal was thoroughly crushed. (Larger pieces of cereal caused a less pleasing texture.) I will be looking for a different low fat "fried" chicken recipe.

My kids loved this. I used chicken strips instead of whole breasts and cut the cooking time by 10 min. I also had already marinaded the chicken overnight (last minute recipe change) and loved the flavor that came through. Also used buttermilk and the chicken turned out really moist. What a healthy and tasty way to make 'chicken nuggets'.

I did not listen to previous reviewers and did not adjust salt - I should have listened - very salty. I also found first coating the chicken in the herb combo to be a very overwhelming taste. However, I used a combo of buttermilk and yogurt for the second coating and the boneless chicken breasts were extremely moist and tender.

Absolutely delicious! I have made it twice, and plan on making it again tonight. I think I will try the suggestion of low fat butter milk. All in all this is a quick and supremely satisfying treat when you are craving that deep fried flavor.

I've now made this recipe several times and have a few suggestions. I use lowfat buttermilk instead of yogurt. I like the taste better and the chicken does not get as mushy. I also use real garlic vs. powder for more flavor. To give it a good crunch - don't use a food processor to crush the cereal. Just put the cereal in a bag and hand crush. I also used corn flakes vs. Special K. Not any different in calories, but much better flavor. My family loves this and I will continue to make it!

This chicken tasted great! I would definitely agree with the above reviewer's suggestion on cutting back on the salt. I would also sprinkle in the garlic straight to the yogurt. All in all, I think the yogurt worked wonderfully with the chicken , keeping it moist and juicy. Easy to make!

No kidding, this is a really great recipe! Per previous reviewers' suggestion, I sprinkled the garlic powder into the yogurt, which seemed to work well. I'd cut the salt a bit next time, but all in all it was tender and crispy and yummy.

This really came out good. There are two things to consider: 1) the recipe calls out for 2 cups of the cereal, this is two cups after it is crushed, so really you are using four cups. 2) the garlic power I think over shadowed the flavor, I would recommend using fresh garlic and add it to the yogurt directly, about two cloves.

This was a great weeknight main that satified my desire to be healthy and my fiance's desire for something "fried". He's a super picky eater and even went back for seconds. This is a versatile recipe that could be served over salad or used to make healthier chicken tenders. Yumm!

I forgot to mention that I heard the author of this cookbook on NPR and was skeptical that this recipe would be any good. It is, though!

Delish, easy and healthy! I love how zesty and nicely seasoned the chicken was, and the yogurt made it so juicy and tender. My only complaint is that the bottom got a little mushy and soggy, but maybe it's b/c I coated the chicken too heavily w/ yogurt. At any rate, much better than icky Shake-n-Bake.
