This salad was well liked by everyone and we didn't have any leftovers. I especially enjoyed the dressing in this recipe, which I doubled. I did stray from the recipe a bit by adding gorgonzola.

I stumbled across this recipe while looking for ways to use tatsoi, which was in my CSA box this week. the salad dressing was amazing. I think that the flank steak needs to be marinaded first though. But definitely a great weekday supper.

Great recipe! I made a few minor adjustments since I don't have a grill. I cooked both the steak and scallions under the broiler. For the bread, I went ahead and cubed that and threw it into a skillet with a the olive oil and a little chopped fresh rosemary. It was a great summery salad and the only improvement I think could be made is me not spilling half the dressing on the counter! haha

This recipe is fantastic ! I doubled the vinegerette, which is the star of this recipe. The ciabatta, I rubbed with garlic first and then continued directions. I marinated the flank in the " grilled flank " recipe. White wine vinegerette, garlic, olive oil, s/p... 3 hours marinated - grilled- hmmmm... Like butta... A keeper

Very, very good! I made it more or less as written.. easily the best steak salad I have tried. It is beautifully simple, and a very nice balance of flavours, each complimenting the others perfectly. I've had quite a few different steak salads involving far more complicated flavours and ingredients, such as berries and radishes, and they were excellent, but I think I prefer the subtle marriage of tastes and textures here. btw, if you don't have a functioning BBQ for the steak, this method is an excellent substitute: http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-a-steak-in-the-ove-108490

Made this tonight. Quick, easy, AND delicious! I also added a dollop of herbed, garlic goat cheese I had in the fridge and it was perfect! Also loved the idea of grating tomotoes and I will definitely utilize this technique again. Thanks BA - a winner I will be making many times over!

My son also wanted this after flipping thru the BA magazine - must be a good photo! He cooked it and we thought the salad was very good although it seemed like I had had something similiar before. It's pretty basic so adding whatever you like should add interest and work out great.

My boyfriend asked me to make this for him after he saw it while flipping through BA magazine. It turned out great! Easy and delicious. I added crumbled blue cheese and chopped avocado to the salad. I used arugula because that's what I had on hand. Definitely a keeper.
