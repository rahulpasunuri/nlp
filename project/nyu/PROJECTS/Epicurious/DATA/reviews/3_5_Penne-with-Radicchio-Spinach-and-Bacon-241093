Very tasty- rich, flavorful and perfect for a quick dinner on a cool fall evening. My husband immediately requested that it be added to the regular rotation. I substituted arugula for the radicchio, added a splash of white wine and saved the olive oil for a generous drizzle at the end. Next time I would reduce the amount of bacon a little and start cooking it before the onions. A bit more wine wouldn't hurt either. Definitely a keeper!

Good combination of flavors. I used turkey bacon, which is lean and takes long to cook, so I slivered the onions (vertically) and cooked them with the bacon, so in the end they were completely carmelized. I skipped the radicchio and it wasn't missed. Also, the basil isn't really necessary b/c the flavor of the onion, garlic, and bacon overpowers it. The roasted garlic is delicious and provides a subtle garlic flavor that is slightly sweet.

I diced cooked chicken breast and added it at the end. In my family, with two teenage sons, the recipe was enough for a meal with no leftover. One son came up with the idea to use broccoli rabe as the greens, and I thought that would be delicious.

I didn't expect this recipe to be as good as it was. A real keeper. Everyone I make it for raves about it.

I made this without the radicchio or red pepper, substituted very thinly sliced jamon serrano for the bacon and used red onion, not brown. Er... I suppose, on reflection, that makes it a completely different recipe, but it was delicious!

This is a good dish, but not much of a showcase for radicchio. As other reviewers point out, other greens, like arugula, would work just as well. Next time I'll save my radicchio for something special.

I couldn't find the radicchio so I sub'd organic purple kale, hoping to get the color contrast. Followed the recipe exactly and was really impressed with the results. I sprinkled in a 1/2 tsp sugar along with the pepper flakes to offset the bitter greens and think this is a definite keeper. While the garlic roasts you have enough time to do everything else. Nuts on top would be a perfect addition if you weren't too worried about fat/calories.

This was delicious, a nice balance of flavors. As another reviewer mentioned, I didn't explicitly taste the fresh basil that went into it, but I'm sure it contributed to the overall flavor of the dish. I used Castelfranco radicchio (pale green with magenta variegation) and purple orach in place of the spinach, so mine was beautifully flip-flopped, colorwise (and the orach turned my pasta pink!). Also added about twice the crushed red pepper since we like a little more heat, and next time I may add extra roasted garlic as well.

Wonderful taste and fragrance. Allow enough time to bake the garlic and then do rest of prep. I cut this recipe in half and it could have been a side dish for six. Just a note - radicchio turns brown when wilted - not that pretty red anymore. Funny, I couldn't taste the basil in it now that I look over the ingredients again. I think it would be nice with a grilled boneless chicken breast next time.

Very flavorful dish. Used peppered bacon (what I had on hand) and added garlic toward the end of cooking. Made this for a casual family dinner and it was easy, fairly quick, had a nice presentation with a little parsley on top, would make it again for a more formal occasion.

Wow, was this good! I had some leftover rainbow chard leaves which I subbed for the spinach and radicchio. I added it to the sauce to cook for about five minutes, then added the basil at the end to wilt; the chard had a nice texture, was very flavorful and not bitter at all. I also used rigatoni instead of penne, and I mashed the garlic before adding to the sauce. Although decreasing the fat would be healthier, I used all the fat called for and savored every silky bite!

"Flavor-packed" to say the least. I subbed brussel sprouts instead of radicchio (cut into halves) and turkey bacon instead of real bacon. I also patted the turkey bacon/ onion mixture on paper towels after they cooked. But overall, very delicious.

This recipe was pretty good, however it called for a little too much radicchio for my personal tastes- it made the dish too bitter for me.

I usually trust Bon Appetit and don't edit their recipes, but I agree with others on this one. You can drain the bacon fat and skip the oil. It's delicious!

Excellent!! Each bite offers a different flavor. I would make it again!!! Suggest to add toasted pinenuts at the end!!!

Subed baby arugula for spinach and did not add all that olive oil as directed. The oil from the bacon was plenty. Cooked the radicchio a little longer than directed since the bottoms of the leaves were a little tough and bitter. Still yummy and a great way to get veggies into a toddler!

Great recipe. The only change that I made is that I wilted the radicchio in the bacon and onion mixture. I threw in the spinach and basil at the end and just let the heat of the pasta wilt them. Making it again tonight

Sounds simple and delicious. I was waiting to prepare it until someone came up with a substitution for the bacon...has anyone tried sun-dried tomatoes?

Loved the taste and texture of this dish; I substituted leftover pancetta for the bacon with great results.

Used half the bacon, and added 2 boneless chicken breasts, cut into cubes. It was good, and a great way to use up radiccio and spinach I happend to have in the fridge.

Radicchio was not readily available so I substituted baby arugula and omited the spinach. I doubled the bacon, cut away most of the fat and drained the rest. Family and I loved it!

Thanks to the reviewer below with the tip to wilt the radicchio first. Good recipe but I don't know why the recipe wouldn't have you drain the fat from the bacon. I did that, and also did not add the additional oil. The dish came out fine without all that added fat.

delicious, super easy and everyone loved it. a real crowd pleaser.

It was a nice recipe but the Spinach and Radicchio wilt at different rates so I wound up with pretty sloppy spinach. In the future I would put the radicchio in much before the spinach (or even omit the radicchio).
