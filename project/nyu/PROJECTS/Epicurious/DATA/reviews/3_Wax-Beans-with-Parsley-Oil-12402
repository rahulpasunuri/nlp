Very easy to make. Don't overcook the beans. It might be good to submerge the beans in a ice-cold water bath to stop the cooking and help keep the beans crisp. We paired this with the Swordfish with Olive, Pinenut, and Parsley Relish recipe. It was delicious!

Yum. Made with local, organic beans and parsley from our CSA. Doubled the recipe and we polished the whole thing off... the kids had doubles and triples. Great color too. Looks fabulous on the plate.
