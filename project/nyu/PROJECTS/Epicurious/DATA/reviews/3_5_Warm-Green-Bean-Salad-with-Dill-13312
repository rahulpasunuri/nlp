This is our family's favorite string bean recipe. Been making it for almost 20 years. Just follow the directions and make sure you don't overcook the beans. Also if you aren't serving right away, shock the beans in ice water, dry on paper towels and dress 30 minutes before serving. That way the beans retain the bright green color and crispness.

Only so-so. Can't decide if I'm going to say I'd make it again or not although I did make a couple of changes. I was in a hurry and grabbed balsamic vinegar rather than the red wine called for. Also we ran out of our premium olive oil and only had a bottle typical of what you can find in the only grocery store in a town of 1,000 people. Maybe next time I have a quality oil on hand I'll try this again. The beans out of our garden were excellent. Guess the reason for not liking this could have been more my fault than the recipe.

Goes to show that some of the simplest recipes are the most delicious!

This dish is easy to prepare. You wouldn't think that guests would get excited about green beans, but when I served this at a dinner party I received several compliments and requests for the recipe.

I made this with left-over green beans and added 1/2 sliced sweet, white onion. I also thought it was too sour and added 1 tsp salt. I served it at room temperature with baked ham. Everyone loved it! It wouldn't even be bad with canned green beans.

Used walnut oil and did not have any dill seeds. Still very good.
