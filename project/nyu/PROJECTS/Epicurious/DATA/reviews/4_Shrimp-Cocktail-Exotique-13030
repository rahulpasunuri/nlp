Just not that special for the work involved. Would make Ina G's recipe instead

I was a bit cautious of this because I didn't understand how the flavors would match, but was I wrong to have doubts! It has an excellent, fresh, light taste, yet a bit spicy. -- I did not mix it all, but served it plated. I first put a bed of dark greens and butter lettuce, then added the various ingredients by layer, drizzling the sauce on top. I also used canned mandarin oranges to reduce my prep time and they were a nice addition. With leftover sauce, one night I made it as a full dinner salad. Excellent!

This is a great turn on the standard shrimp cocktail. It has become a holiday first course for us. Everyone loves this. I made no changes to the recipe; it is excellent as stands.

Excellent salad just as is. Over time, I've made some changes: I sauté a 1/4 cup of coarsely chop hazelnuts in 1 tablespoon of butter (salt and pepper to taste) in a large skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until a shade darker. I drain the nuts on paper towels, and then used the reserved skillet to quickly sauté the garlic and shrimp. I layer the avocado, oranges, and shrimp over a bed of chopped romaine, drizzle the sauce over all, and top with the hazelnuts. My family loves this recipe.

Great appetizer course. I have always substituted fresh pink grapefruit for the oranges. I also add the zest of the limes to the sauce, and I am a bit heavier-handed with the alcohol content -- Limoncello, or Grand Marnier go well with this recipe. I also prefer Tabasco instead of cayenne to add a little kick to the sauce.

I love this salad. You never need all the dressing, and it really isn't shrimp cocktail; more like a shrimp appetizer. The dressing is amazing, and you can always make it ingredients you have on hand, so it's a very good sauce to try once, just to have it in your arsenal.

I have to agree that this recipe is different and the sauce is nice but I don't think that it's a wonderful recipe. I won't make it again.

Just delicious! And relatively easy to prepare. I used lite mayonnaise and substituted marinated artichoke hearts (well drained)for the hearts of palm and it was wonderful. An interesting blend of flavors and textures. Everyone raved and asked for the recipe. A definite keeper!

YUMMY and FAST! A perfect summer dinner - fruity, spicy and delicious. I didnt have any hearts of palm on hand so made it with avacodo only. I used "light" Hellmans and added a bit of extra cayenne and orange, t was SCRUMPTIOUS. Served it with multi-grain bagette, honey-ribboned butter, and a dry reisling. Next time I might sprinkle some freshly-roasted almonds on top for extra crunch.

Great change of an old favorite. Served for a dinner party and was well received.

Nice balance between the citrus and creamy texture. A bit of punch with the cognac...could have added more. I topped each dish with some fresh, grated orange rind. I could easily picture poppy seeds as an alternate decorative topping.

The sauce is absolutely fantastic! Great dish. I plan to serve it for Christmas this year.

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe and hardly should be called a shrimp cocktail.

My husband prepares for the ladies bridge luncheon.Each time they wish recipe and gobble down. Have used artichoke hearts in lieu of palm. I prepared for my sister...She talked about it days later...I only had grand marnier...went very well. Made it numerous times...Have used the mandarin oranges in a pinch...or both at times. a keeper.

This recipe was so wonderful that I served it four different times, from a luncheon to a light dinner with fresh fruit and bread.
