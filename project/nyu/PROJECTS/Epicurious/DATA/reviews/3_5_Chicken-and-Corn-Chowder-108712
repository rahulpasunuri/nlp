I make a lot of soups and this is probably my family's very favorite. Like most soups, it gets better with age. In fact, it's so bland the first day I wont serve it on the day I make it. After the flavors meld it's terrific. I use 2 cups of buttermilk instead of whipping cream and increase the potatoes to 2 lbs. A pinch of red pepper and some McCormick Chesapeake Bay seasoning are good additions too.

I made this chowder for a large group, and had well over 10 servings. It was a huge hit and has already been requested again! I used the bacon as a garnish since the recipe doesn't specify what to do with it.

I'm very slow in the kitchen, so it took me awhile longer to prepare this soup. The end result was definitely worth it, however. Omitted the green onion, but put in everything else. For the chicken, I used leftover roasted chicken and stock from the previous day. That threw my liquid portion off slightly so I had to use cornstarch to gain the desired consistency. I would definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
The flavors here are great! Don't skip the bacon or the cilantro! It does need salt & pepper. If you use the packaged butternut squash and cook the potatoes for about 10 minutes before you add them, everything comes together and the consistency is very good! Even the frozen corn is fine. Next time I will cut the potatoes and the squash into bite-sized pieces (same size as the chicken) for consistency. Definitely will make this again, but understand that it takes a good hour to get it ready.

I thoroughly enjoyed this chowder! I made a few modifications including leaving out the squash. As other commenters did, I halved the recipe and blended the chowder before adding the corn to make it even creamier. I also used dried thyme and probably put in too much. It was fantastic to have all of those great flavors in one spoonful!

It is a good base soup. Not a great soup (and more soup than chowder). I halved the recipe and otherwise followed as written. I agree with others that the squash doesn't really add anything and it is labor intensive ... but that is what I like about making soup. Will play around with the leftover and see what works for punching it up a bit. Don't think I will make it again - too much work for the results when there are so many scrumptious other soups to make out there!

I halved the recipe, but still did 10 slices of bacon crumbled in, 3 cups chicken, no cilantro only because I forgot. Added about 1T chipotle powder and one diced jalapeno (with seeds). Used dried thyme. I also used hand-held kitchenaid to blend for thickness after adding pots and squash. Loved it!

Fantastic Recipe! I would love to see this for half the quantity. I will pass along to my friends and make again. My husband really liked it. I definitely recommend buying the pre-cut squash. Also, I use the dried thyme that I had, and it was fine. Enjoy this one!

Yummy! Did not put cilantro in - too strong a flavor for me. Interesting, though. The recipe mentions the bacon once and then there is no other mention! I, like most others, put in the chowder at the end.

I made this recipe up to the point of adding chicken. I then divided it into thirds and served it the first night with chicken as the recipe calls for. The other 2 thirds I put in the freezer. I plan on adding crab to one and maybe clams to the other. I think this is one of the best chowder bases ever.

Made this following the recipe exactly. Wow! Incredible layers of flavor. It's even great warmed over. The cilantro, green onions and bacon sprinkled on top make this a memorable recipe. I've made many of the chicken corm chowders on Epicurious and this is by far the best.

Rating: 3
quite yummy! i made a few changes that were recommended by reviewers: halved the recipe (it does make a LOT); used half-and-half instead of heavy cream; pureed half the soup in the first step for a creamier consistency; used fresh squash cubes from trader joe's (huge time saver) and put them in with the corn rather than the potatoes; added a jalapeno pepper; and served with the crumbled bacon (makes a huge difference). Also added some smoky paprika, and instead of roasted chicken I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts that had been marinated for a few hours in some chicken broth with crushed garlic, thyme, smoky paprika, lemon juice, and a little olive oil, then poached for about 10 minutes in a covered pot with a bit more chicken broth (incredibly moist and tasty!). The soup was still a little thin for a chowder, I thought, so I might add more potatoes for pureeing purposes, but still delicious.

This was a great recipe. I actually served it to both my mother and my mother in law and both asked for the recipe. I mean, usually they ask for a recipe and leave without it. They made sure they left with this one. It was easy, quick to prepare, and fed my family on several nights...but most importantly, it was good! I did as another review suggested and used half and half and also used a rotisserie chicken.

This is my favorite fall chowder. It is rich and extremely flavorful. It is also great with Heart of Gold Squash instead of Butternut Squash. Although the recipe fails to mention this, remember to garnish the bowls of chowder with the bacon as well, which gives the chowder a nice saltiness and crunch.

I made this once before many months ago and we found it didn't have enough flavour...which was horrible cause this took me 3-4 hours to prepare. So, this time around, I substituted 1 cup of chicken broth with a can of Campbell's cream of chicken. I don't like squash, so I did 3 lbs of potatoes instead. I also used 1 TBSP of dry Thyme instead of the fresh stuff (cause who has time for that) and I used freeze-dried cilantro as well. I also put in about a TSP of paprika. TURNED OUT AMAZING!! My husband and I LOVED it.

This recipe makes a lot and is somewhat labor intensive, but it's absolutely worth the effort. You can buy roasted chicken, pre-cut squash, frozen corn, etc. to speed up the process. I followed the recipe exactly as printed, serving the bacon with the extra cilantro as a garnish for guests. I love this soup and everyone who has ever had it loves it, too.

The chowder was very good. Does make a very large pot but family enjoyed it so much they won't mind eating it the next day. Followed recipe fairly close, but did put the bacon back in at the end. Put a little more thyme and the cilantro is a must. I don't think the squash was worth the peeling (not much flavor) - all potatoes would be fine. Did sprinkle some cheddar on top and added some crushed red peppers - very tasty!

I took the advice of other reviewers and blended the cooked potatoes, corn, and broth to make a creamier, more traditional chowder base. Doing so also let me cut down a bit on the whipping cream without losing consistency. Served the chowder to guests with tomato focaccia and spinach/roasted beet salad for a hearty autumn meal. It got good reviews, but I'm still looking for the perfect chowder recipe.

Excellent, full bodied soup. Hearty enough without the chicken, too, if you so choose! I have made this a number of times, and prefer it without the chopped scallions and cilantro. I add some chopped parsley for color instead; bacon bits for garnish if you haven't snacked on them all!

Wow, this makes A LOT of soup-at least 14 servings. So I have a lot in the freezer now. Used 2 med. onions, and one very large red bell pepper. Put all the bell pepper in at the beginning to saute with the onions. Used dried thyme- about three teaspoons. Did not use in the soup or pass green onions or cilantro for sprinkling on top but did sprinkle with the chopped bacon. The butternut squash cooked quicker than the potatoes and when the soup was served, the squash had sort of disintegrated-which was fine, still tasted great.

Funny experience with this. First of all I ended up with about 35 plus cups of soup...that served 4 adults and 2 children with two more meals for the freezer. Secondly I served it with the Pastry-Wrapped Sausages using some horrible hot dogs for the sausage. The meal flopped. Tonight I found one of the frozen containers and served it with the "Caeser Salad, An Even Greater" from this site. It got rave reviews and everyone wanted to have it again soon!! I believe this served with a simple salad makes a memorable meal.

This chowder received rave reviews at a recent post-8k road race. It was fairly easy to prepare and I omitted a few items as well as substituted chick boullion for the broth. Didn't get to the store for cilantro or the scallions but I don't think this hearty chowder needed it.

I made this recipe, with a few tweaks (thanks to previous reviewers), for our "soup group" at work, and it was a big hit. Instead of cubed squash, I used three 10-oz packages of frozen pureed squash. I just dropped them right into the soup with the potatoes. Then, when the potatoes were tender, I added half of the corn and simmered the soup for about 10 minutes. Then I stuck an immersion blender into the pot and used it for about 45 seconds. I added the rest of the corn and red pepper, along with some cumin for added flavor. Since I was serving the soup the next day, I waited until then to add the cream, which I cut down to about 2/3 c., and chicken. I left out the green onions (had a bowl set aside for garnish) and cilantro (gone completely), and floated the bacon pieces on top of the soup as it heated up. The results were delicious, and I will definitely make this soup again.

This soup paired nicely with cornbread and salad, although it wasn't quite as good as expected. I pureed a portion of the finished soup in order to create more of a "chowder" texture and used regular sodium chicken broth instead of low-sodium (it needed the extra salt). Next time I'd 1/2 the recipe and add jalapeno for some kick.

I doubled the recipe for a large party. I made one pot for kids using less scallions. I added habanero chiles to the other, along with lemon grass. I also processed half of the chowder after adding the corn and 2nd round of red peppers to give it a smoother consistency. I will make this again and again.

This is just lovely! I followed other cooks recommendations and cut in half, roasted the squash first, used dried thyme, and pureed, with half the liquid, the potatoes and squash, before adding the remaining veggies. The only real change in the ingredients I made was to use canned evaporated milk instead of the cream and it was great. I am wondering if anyone who has used the frozen squash that some of you were saying is available in the U.S. could advise me as to whether or not it is cooked or blanched before it was frozen? I can't buy that in my part of Canada (just cooked,mashed squash) and would like to know if I can just cut and freeze fresh squash without cooking it first. And would the squash suffer from not cooking it first? Can you just cut it into wedges, freeze it and bake it from the frozen state?? What a huge hassle that would save me every fall!!! I would really appreciate any feed back you could give me. Thanks!

I love, love, love this soup! While I agree that it's more "soup" than "chowder" I just don't think it matters. It doesn't have that overly thick, bland taste that so many chowders can have. It's wonderful and hearty and refreshing. It's part of our permanent file, and the only reason I don't make it more often is that it's so labor intensive. Lots of chopping, but it can be done while other things are cooking and simmering. If you can buy any of the veggies pre-chopped (especially the butternut squash!), I am sure that would help too. I put the cooked bacon in small dishes on the table alongside the chopped cilantro and green onion and allow folks to garnish the soup themselves. Everyone I've ever served this to has asked for the recipe. It's awesome!

Delicious! I cut the recipe in half and had plenty for dinner for three people with some left for lunch the next day. Since I don't care for cilantro, I substituted parsley, and it was great. Will be sharing this with my new daughter-in-law, as she and my son love soup, too.

This is the second time I'm making this recipe. I used chicken that I cooked rather than buying a rotisserie chicken and pureed most of the soup to make it into a bisque. My kids loved it and never knew how many veggies they were eating. PS, if you change every ingredient, how can you rate the recipe badly?

Absolutely scrumptious. Unlike some other cooks, I wouldn't change a thing. Occasionally I will make it without the chicken. I give this recipe out to friends every time we make it. If there is a Trader Joe's in your area, I suggest going there to pick up the ingredients as they have butternut squash in their refrigerator section that is already cubed. Cuts down on much of the prep that way! Happy eating!

This is a great fall recipe that is easy to make. I pureed all of chowder before the step of adding the corn, cream and the rest of the red bell pepper.

Our guests raved over it and they all left with the recipe!

Today as tempretures dropped to a balmy 80 degrees here in Miami I found myself feeling nostalgic for October in a city that actually has seasons, and this chowder is Fall for me. I've made this recipe 4 or 5 times now and it is probably my favorite thing on Epicurious. A few bits of advice on it. The soup can be a little thin, so be sure to chop the potatos and squash small. Then you can either mash them up against the side with a slotted spoon or puree some of the soup like other reviewers have suggested, I recommed about a blender full and not half the soup. Secondly, it makes a ton of soup so be prepared with tupperware or lots of hungry guests. Definately add the bacon over the top when serving and not into the boil, as it gets mushy if you leave it in there. You can add a jalapeno for a little kick, or a couple teaspoons to taste of chipotle chili powder for smokiness. Be liberal with the pepper at the end, but careful with the salt. Using bags of corn and preroasted chicken are major time savers, and chopping the squash is the most labor intensive part. Serve with a good crusty bread and enjoy on a cold night, or like me, with your AC on full!

My family went crazy over this recipe! I can see why they discard the bacon, though. It can get chewy and hard, which doesn't make for great texture. I substituted glace de poulet for the broth (adjusting the salt accordingly), and roasted the butternut squash separately, adding it in at the end with the chicken. I don't like the texture of boiled squash, so roasting it was great, albeit more work.

After reading all the rave reviews, I finally decided to make this, but unfortunately my husband and I found it rather average. There was just something "insubstantial" about it. In retrospect I would recommend taking another reviwer's suggestion to puree half the soup before adding the chicken. That might have given this a richer mouthfeel. Otherwise, it's kind of thin and brothy. I'd also increase the amount of chicken too. We thought the ratio of corn to meat was too high. A touch of tabasco or dried red pepper adds a nice kick too. Beware, this recipe makes a TON of soup. We cut it in half and didn't even come close to making a dent in it. My husband even remarked how he'd like to meet the 10 people the whole recipe supposedly serves. They'd have to have very strong appetites!

I am happy to report that this recipe was quite tastey. I did make a few alterations such as adding the juice of one lime, reducing the cilantro to 1/3 cup, reducing the chicken broth to 8 cups (six 10.5oz cans to be exact), and reducing the onions to 2 (instead of 3). Also, before serving the chowder, I sprinkled with avocado chunks and tortilla strips (crumbled Tostado chips). I squeezed lime juice on the avacado for extra flavor. I purchased a rotisserie chicken (Mojo) from Publix for convenience. Another idea...I served with jalapeno cornbread from the Publix bakery (it's really spicey and sweet). I should have reduced the recipe b/c it is too much chowder for two people. Lot's of preparation...but, we will make again. It was very flavorful. Happy cooking!

This soup was a hit at our house. My husband loved this soup. To make it easier to prepare, I poked the squash 4 times with a kinfe and microwaved for 10 minutes and scooped out the soft flesh. I also used left over turkey breast the second time I made it and it turned out great.

This one goes in our permanant file. We used nearly double the amount of chicken called for, though it would have been just fine as written. To maintain the light color of the soup, we used white pepper when seasoning. Be careful with the cilantro -- I'd probably omit the second addition. I just haven't gotten to appreciate the Ivory soap taste of too much cilantro. When chopping the squash, try Chicago Cutlery's bread knife. It saws through the squash with no problem. Be sure and steam the squash to facilitate peeling.

Cook from SoCal -what are you talking about? Jello? Recipes from the 50's? How is that relevant as a response to my original comment about progressive dinners and white zin, which BTW, was meant in fun. I actually was complimenting the idea. I love it!. I also collect recipes, slides, photographs, etc. from the 50's and 60's. I serve things like Ambrosia at kitschy dinner parties. Yes, I was ribbing the progressive dinner party hostess a little (for possibly thinking that it was truly a "progresive" idea), but I think a little good-natured fun is harmless. By the way, I'm from Oklahoma (not a "blue" state)!

I did things a bit differently than called for-and would make even more changes now that I've had the soup. I added only the corn after the potatoes/squash mixture had cooked about 10 minutes. After about 2 mins I removed half of the soup and pureed it. I then tossed in the cream, chicken, remaining bell peppers and onions. It needed quite a bit of salt and I also added some red pepper flakes. I definitely would make it again, altho this time I would cook the butternut squash separately and puree all of it as it has a weird texture compared to the rest of the ingredients; but I do like the flavor and color it adds. As the previous reviewer mentioned - Trader Joes sells butternut squash peeled & cubed in the produce section-its the only way to go and one bag is just about 4 cups. I think this recipe would be a great way to use your leftover Thanksgiving turkey in place of the roasted chicken. And lastly, "Cook" reviewer of 11/20 - what a snobby B*&#!

There was sooo much to add, I didn't know if all the ingredients would fit in the pot! but I do have ONE question....After you fry the 10 chopped strips of bacon in the beginning of the recipe and drain them on paper towels...???do they ever get added to the chowder??? I would make this again!!

This chowder tasted fine.The problem being, it not only looked like vomit, it smelled like it also. It made a great prop for the front step on halloween. I have probably made 300 recipes from this website, all all others have been great.

Much as I hate to be the lone dissenting voice, this wasn't that great. I made a half recipe (thank goodness!) based on prior comments about the quantity. the only other change was to omit the bell pepper, as I don't like them. It was just a basically uninteresting soup. No outstanding flavor, and not that impressive to look at. Perhaps adding the bacon in (as others have mentioned) would help, but I don't think I'll bother to try it again.

Absolutely wonderful soup! My husband thought it was the best soup he's had. Everyone gave rave reviews. It was worth every bit of effort.

This is a delicious, satisfying soup that really provides lots of comfort. Everyone that tried it raved. We added a little of the bacon on top of each serving as a garnish with the green onions. Wonderful recipe that I'll make again.

This was excellent! My store was out of butternut squash so I used calabacita (Mexican squash) and it was great.

This was a wonderful soup, a real keeper. Freezes very well, too. If you live near a Trader Joe's, they carry 1 lb. bags of squash cut up in 1" cubes--much easier than hacking through a whole squash. How can this make 10 servings? I got almost 9 quarts out of it! That's a really big serving size...

Worth every bit of effort. This is a great chowder, very hearty and filling. Cut the squash into manageable pieces and then steam it for a few minutes, then peel and dice it. Just wait to add it to the soup towards the end instead of with the potatoes so it doesn't get overcooked.

Good soup. Worth the wrestle with the butternut squash.

This recipe was AMAZING! I put the bacon back in the soup as an added bonus. I served this to guests two weeks ago who are STILL raving about it.

I completely skipped the cream and added more chicken broth and it was great! I accidentaly cooked the green onions in the soup but added more for garnish at the end. I put everything in the blender then added the chicken and corn to get a better consistency. My halloween party guests raved about it! Even the kids ate it. great recipe

This soup was absolutely delicious!! I nearly lost a finger trying to hack into the butternut squash--I had no idea it would be that hard! But it was worth it! I used less cream because it already looked very creamy and tasted fantastic. Next time, I am going to take the reviewers advice and roast the squash first. Enjoy!

This is a delicious, but very labour intensive dish. I've never peeled a squash before and let me tell you, I broke out into a sweat trying to saw at it!!! I guess I should have read more of the reviews and steamed it first before cutting it. I'll probably make this again but try to make it less fattening and less work. Mind you, you get a workout chopping everything, that counts for a few calories, doesn't it? :)

Great soup for this time of year and fairly simple to make. To make it low fat I skipped the bacon and cream, adding a dollop of yogurt upon presentation - not the same but still good. I browned boneless skinless chicken thighs and started the recipe from there, adding the onions, etc. Well worth the 'effort' of chopping.

Rating: 3
Very tasty and hearty soup; well worth the time. In an effort to cut calories, I used one cup of half and half instead of heavy whipping cream. It turned out great! I couldn't find pre-peeled butternut squash, so I hacked it in half and roasted it while I cooked the bacon, sauteed the onions, and simmered the potatoes. I then added the scooped-out, cooked, cubed squash and it worked well.

My two "I don't like ______ (fill in the veggie)" children (ages 4, 6)just polished off their bowls of this chowder. My son and daughter usually pick out anything red, green, or orange from their food, but not only did they finish this meal, they even commented on how yummy it is! I microwave my bacon for 10 minutes and it turnes out perfectly crisp and not overcooked, plus the splatter is contained inside. I took a turkey baster (bulb) and sucked 1/4cup fat and transfered it to a pan with the butter. I assumed that the bacon was to be added as garnish, but since I'm serving the majority of this meal at a later date, I just dumped it all in the soup. It adds great texture. I've also dealt with cutting butternut squash before and was not looking forward to cutting it into tiny pieces without a chainsaw. I was pleasantly surprised that it peeled as easily as it did, thus making the cutting-into-pieces easy as potatoes! I look forward to leftovers!

Although this was truly delicious, there was way too much chopping involved for me. It is a hearty, terrific winter soup. I do recommend the flavor. But, it's a lot of work.

Not fond of corn chowder but made this for my husband. We both gave it raves! Time consuming to prepare but worth it. A hearty winter soup.

Is it just me or does the recipe leave out what to do with the bacon??

This is a terrific soup that got rave reviews from my dinner guests. Our dinner for 8 had the soup, freshly baked bread and salad, and we had about a quart left over. It's a lot of work but worth it!

Had it with a group of 6 people and everyone loved it. Did not change anything. Excellent flavors and good comfort food.

This is a great soup. I can't believe so much flavor emerges in a broth that has only fresh thyme added to it. I was skeptical about using the squash since I'm not a big fan of it but it absolutely works in this recipe. Yes, it is hard to peel--I had to use my cleaver to hack it into slices and then a vegetable peeler to get the skin off. Also--I had to use 2 deli rotisserie chickens to get enough meat for 4 cups.

Delicious soup! The family loved it. There was a lot of chopping involved, but the texture and taste of the soup made it worth it. I did add the squash and found it added color, texture and maybe a little taste. I used the bacon as garnish instead of adding it to the soup.

Great comfort food and it made lots. I fed 8 people that loved it and there was plenty leftover. I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I used dried thyme. I added the bacon along with the cilantro.

This is so comforting and delicious! The leftovers are even better! The recipe did not indicate when to add the cooked bacon pieces so I added it when I put the chicken in. It turned out great.

I cook a lot of different soups and stews, and none has made a *bigger* hit than this chowder. (Lucky me since I chose to try the recipe because of leftover cooked chicken breasts and a need to clean out the fridge!) Don't be afraid to substitute. I didn't have cream, but sour cream worked fine, especially with a big dollop for garnish. I was out of thyme and used a seasoning blend that contained that as well as flaked red peppers--that helped since I had no bell peppers. I also took the advice of the gentleman who suggested jazzing it up a bit, and diced 3 tablespoons of Pepperoncini peppers--fantastico! Finally, I did crumble the bacon to add to the sour cream, green onion and cilantro garnish. Just doesn't get much better.

The chowder turned out delicious. There was a lot of chopping involved, but in the end it was worth it. I substituted some of the ingredients because I couldn't get them at my local grocery. Also, I used less onion than the recipe called for. Adding shredded cheese after putting it in bowls made it even better.

Even after cutting roughly in half, this barely fit in my dutch oven. It made alot. Yes, odd that the bacon is left out - so I served as garnish, along w/sour cream and green onions. I bought a whole chicken, saved the dark meat, roasted the breasts and made broth out of the rest - which worked great. Added fresh rosemary too, add used sour cream and half/half instead of whipping cream (since I had that in the fridge). My kids picked out the squash and peppers, but we all loved dipping fresh corn bread in it. Next time I'd zip it up a bit with a jalapeno. This stuff is so filling, I dont know how you'd add an entree as suggested.

Everybody loved this, kids and adults. I lightened up some: used 2 pieces of bacon and crumbled into soup, buttermilk rather than cream. I'm not crazy about quality of supermarket roasted chicken, so I bought two breasts and poached in broth. Makes a very thick chowder. Everyone was vying for the leftovers to take to lunch.

Made this last weekend. What a hit. I forgot to buy squash but I think it turned out well without. Also added a hot pepper to perk it up. It made a lot but didn't last long.

I halved the recipe and it was perfect! I also used glace de poulet instead of chicken stock, and it added a depth of flavor that was very nice. Odd that the bacon was not used later in the recipe, so I saved it for garnish at the end. This will now be our traditional dish on Halloween!

Made it and served in our restaurant. The customers really liked it. Something Different. We added the bacon with the corn for a better "meat" flavor.

I made the soup for a party of ten as part of the Harvest-theme menu. It was well worth the effort to have good broth made ahead and I only needed to use 1/2 cup of light cream for it.They were delicious! The corn and squash definitely go well with the fall season.

My husband (who is a HUGE fan of chicken and corn chowder) and I thought this was ok. There was alot of chopping. The recipe makes enough to feed a small army. I can't say I am looking forward to eating this for the rest of the week. Once was enough.

I thought this soup was excellent. I halved the recipe, which generously fed my husband and me for dinner and lunch leftovers for a couple of days. I used turkey bacon and a little olive oil. I added the bacon at the end. I also cut back on the onions just a bit. Really, really delicious!!

Made the entire menu from bon Apetite for a potluck birthday party - great plan for a large group. The soup was definitely the highlight though. Like the cook from Northern Illinois, I was looking for ways to save time. Frozen corn, potatoes, carrots are a great way to cut down on prep... the squash was really hard to cut uncooked. Next time I will use all frozen veggies and will reduce the onion. Don't substitute with dried thyme though - that needs to be fresh for the flavor. I didn't use the bacon, but will next time for a garnish. Great soup - but it does yield a lot! Will also try it in my crock pot next time.

This chowder was very good. Regarding the bacon, I added it back in when the corn went in. It defintely gave the soup a wonderful smokey flavor. I started this recipe rather late in the day, so to avoid peeling and more chopping, I found a 1.5 pound bag of baby yukon potatoes. I only had to cut a few in half and that was it. Also, I subbed 2 lbs of carrots instead of the squash. I've made soup with squash before, and the flavor wasn't that much different! The color was good also. Can't wait to reheat tonight. It's only going to be 50 degrees today.

This soup was good the first day. The second day, I put the leftovers in the blender and my husband and I thought it was great. I guess we like a thicker soup. To each their own...

Made this last night for our annual pumpkin massacre. It got rave reviews. I think the point of the bacon was just to get the bacon grease. I skipped that step and just used 1/4 cup of canola oil. I also subbed parsley for the cilantro (my husband isnt a fan) and used light cream. I will be enjoying the soup for rest of the week!!

This was perfect soup for a chilly fall day. Yes, it did require a lot of chopping, but the requests to make it again made it worthwhile. I , too, wondered about the bacon, so I just added it as garnish just prior to serving the chowder.

This soup is so awesome!!! Sure, like some others said, it is labor intensive but well worth it. And you get a lot of soup to last. I used eight ears of fresh corn, as it is in season, I thought the fresh corn would have better flavor than frozen. If you are like me and only eat white meat, two chickens will suffice, which I shredded instead of chopped. I also added some roasted chopped green chile, for some spicy flavor, it made the soup. We fill the freezer with this soup and it doesn't last long. I've made it twice in the last month.

This soup has a lot of nice flavors in it. I was surprised at the massive amount of soup it yielded. I wasn't prepared for the great amount of chopping involved, either. But overall, it's definitely worth making.

The chowder recipe was a bit labor intensive and there was far too much onion in the recipe which overpowered the taste of the chowder. I cut out the chopped green onions which helped a lot. The cilantro added a nice flavor.

I really enjoyed this with some crusty bread and a nice salad. One comment though, the recipe never reveals when to add the cooked bacon.

I had to make one change to this recipe as I am Allergic to wheat gluten. Instead of using flour to thicken I used a little corn starch at the end. It was really good and easy to make.
