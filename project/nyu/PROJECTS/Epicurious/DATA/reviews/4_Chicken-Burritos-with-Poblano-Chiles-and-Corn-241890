Excellent! Used 1/4 of poblano and still spicy!

Sorry, but I only found this recipe, as written, to be okay. Nothing special. In fact, due to the use of bottled taco sauce, it tastes like a processed product. Sure it is is easy, but it was bland. Poblanos are very mild peppers and I even used slightly more than specified. If I make this again, I would add many of the things others have suggested (onions and black beans) and increasing the heat factor with chili powder or jalapenos or seranos. Tastes like something you'd get at one of those chain Mexican restaurants.

I've made this dish twice. The first time I subbed jalapenos since the store I was at didn't have poblanos and it turned out great. Both times I've also used Trader Joe's enchilada sauce for the red sauce. It turned out great and yummy. Next time I'll use the red taco sauce to make it even better I'm sure. Definitely a great weeknight dinner option.

I used a Costco chicken as well, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was SO EASY and fast, and the end result was yummy. I added black beans and served with mexican rice and avacado and it was better than I expected, even after reading all the positive reviews. Will definitely make again, maybe next time saute the poblano chiles longer and leave in the seeds for added flavor and spice.

WOW! My family LOVED this recipe and hadn't finished eating it before requesting it again! It was a tad too hot for my husband, but not for my son and me. Very flavorful just as written. I had a big oven-roaster that I'd cooked and cut up the day before. So, rather than 1/2" strips as called for, the chicken was more chopped up: still delicious. Go for it, you won't be disappointed!

Another 4 forker! Delicioso. Followed the recipe exactly (did add a Spanish onion as suggested & used a Costco rotisserie chicken) but can't figure how they came up with 6 burritos. I made 13 & they weren't small. Served with beans, rice, guacamole, homemade salsa & a dollop of sour cream on top. If you can find homemade tortillas as I did, so much the better.

Yummy! Added a medium sized Spanish onion while sauteeing peppers. Used closer to two cups of peppers and medium heat Ortega taco sauce. The fresh cilantro is a must...delish!

This is as flavorful and easy to prepare a recipe as you'll ever find. I made a few revisions, having made it twice in 3 days! I used one extra poblano and the full bag of frozen corn, about 3/4 cup extra. I made these as tacos and used corn tortillas, microwaved 15 seconds. The corn adds a sweetness that the flour could not. Microwaving makes the tortillas warm and moist. I used 2 tsp. ea. of cumin and chili powder. I used canola oil. I used a bottle of Trader Joe's "chili pepper sauce." Whatever you do, DON'T use some tired, flavorless taco sauce like heinz..you'll miss all the fun and flavor. Warning:this chili pepper sauce is fairly spicy, but this can be offset some by adding sour cream. I used the frozen corn right out of the freezer and cooked everything a few minutes longer. I added chopped scallions, cilantro and a squeeze of fresh lime to the top of the taco. Fold over and enjoy! It's as good as I've had, and I spent a lot of my life in Texas and San Francisco, eating many spanish style dishes.

How funny people can't find taco sauce! Maybe it's just a "west" thing! These are awesome - I too liked the chicken and peppers grilled and top with quacamole.

I really liked this one! I bet it would work with beef, and how about shrimp with lime juice? Many posibilities.

Great go-to recipe - fast, easy and tastes great. I added black beans and probably too much corn - didn't taste the chicken as much as I would have liked with all that filler. Made guacamole to go with it and skipped the salsa even though we had some - didn't think it needed it.

I made this recipe last night and it was wonderful, was able to find the taco sauce. However, I marinated the chicken with the spice rub first then added lime juice and let it sit the whole day. I grilled the chicken and the poblano pepper. My husband just loved it.

This is a great, easy go- to recipe. I usually double or triple the recipe and then make up burritos and put them in the freezer. I do add black beans to stretch it out. I can't find taco sauce so I use enchilada sauce and it's perfect.

I used 1.5 poblano peppers b/c I was serving it to kids, too. I also added black beans w/ the corn to stretch it out some more. And, finally I used enchilada sauce b/c I couldn't find taco sauce (in NYC of all places) and it was good. A nice quick weekday meal.

I could not get over how delicious this is with so little effort. I sauteed onions with the chiles and used enchilada sauce since I could not find red taco sauce- -is there another name for it?

Rating: 3
I also added black beans and I used fresh corn cut from the cobb. Quick and easy with good flavor. I made homemade green salsa by pulsing tomatillos, cilantro, and 1 jalapeno with a little lime juice.

This is great and so versatile! We've settled on a Herdez salsa (orange cap and label--it's smoky and sorta spicy) as our 'taco sauce' of choice, and we've made it as filling for tacos, taco salads, and nachos. Nachos are our fave, and this is perfect with homemade salsa verde and guacamole. Definitely a weeknight keeper!

This was so good! The peppers were a bigger pain to chop than I thought but worth it. I only used 1 lb of chicken and added coriander, black beans and rice to the recipe.

Wonderful recipe. Easy to make and would serve as a terrific meal on a busy weekday. I would recommend this recipe for anyone who is always busy and wants a nutritional, tasty meal.

What a surprise! This was a really great easy recipe!!! I added black beans and would do it again! I wish I had made more so I could have it for lunch today.

I roasted the poblanos and used Enchalada sauce instead of the taco sauce (that was what I had) and it was delicious. Also make sure to use good Mexican chili powder. Too hot for my children but my husband loved this very simple dish.

This was just so-so, but I blame that on the brand of taco sauce I chose. I added a liberal amount of Mexican oregano, which made it more authentic, and I also served it with boxed yellow rice. Better the next day served with chips instead of the tortilla.

So easy yet so delicious. Use different bottled taco sauce to change the taste.

I thought it was good, but fairly standard fare. Definitely not a dish that I will crave or probably even remember in a few days. My husband was a big fan.

We are always looking for a mexican dish which doesn't require hard-to-find ingredients or hours of labor. This was easy to make, yet the flavor was authentic. We used 1 tbsp. of spices and it was just right for us. The faint of heart (or stomach) should opt for 2 poblanos rather than 3.

Followed recipe without any doctoring and it was very good. Served with yellow rice on the side. This one goes in the repertoire.

This was pretty good. I was a little puzzled by the fact that the recipe did not include rice or beans, so I added both and cooked the cilantro in with the rice. I feel like it would have been a little dull without those.

This is a great quick and easy dinner. I made this exactly as written. Like another reviewer, I made half the recipe and had four fully loaded burritos.

Very good! A week night keeper. I upped the spices to one tablespoon a piece and was happy with spice and heat level (mid-high heat).

This is a very tasty recipe. As the cook from Mexico City points out, Pasillas and Poblanos are not the same, although since both have mild to medium heat, I imagine that they can substitute for each other. Fresh Pasillas are also called Chilacas; dry Poblanos are also called Anchos or Mulatos. They are smaller than Pasillas.

This is a yummy recipe. We forgot to get the red taco sauce and the cilantro, but it was delicious without it. I halved the recipe and it made 5 burritos.

After deciding to try out making some Mexican cuisine, I tried this recipe. It was a huge hit. Increase the spices a little more, and squeeze some lime over the chicken after you take it off the heat. Besides that, great as is.

the recipie is great. Only one thing, i am from Mexico and the chile poblano and the chile pasilla are two completly different chiles. Pasilla is usually sell dry and is long and the poblano is the one used to fill and make chiles rellenos.

This was a great recipe. I did not use all of the chicken the recipe called for and the flavor was excellent, so I would double the spices if you were using all the chicken. Also, I could not find the poblano chiles, so I used a variety of sweet and spicy peppers that were available at the grocery store. It turned out great and I will definitely make this again. Very quick and easy!

This recipe was easy and delicious! The cilantro was an excellent touch. I substituted feta for the mexican blend cheese which was an interesting taste.
