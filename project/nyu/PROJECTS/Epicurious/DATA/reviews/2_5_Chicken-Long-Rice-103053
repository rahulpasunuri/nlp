I was born and raised in Hawaii and this is your standard Chicken Long Rice recipe. If you want to cut the fat, then simply remove the chicken skin.

I have been making this recipe ever since it was published and the February 2000 issue of Gourmet was in our mail upon our return from Maui. It is authentic (from what we enjoyed at a luau) and easy to make. It is one of those "comfort foods" that is always consistent. Half a recipe is great for just my husband and me with enough left over for a following lunch.

did not think it served up nice too many bean threads

I used boneless, skinless thighs and skimmed the froth frequently. It wasn't greasy at all and it's now our favorite chicken soup.

Two things: this makes a TON of soup, but the recipe can halved. Also, the greasy broth problem can easily be avoided by straining the liquid through a double layer of paper towels in a sieve or colander. It's quite a good recipe if you take that extra step.

To quote my husband, "yuck"! Cooking the noodles in the broth made from the chicken thighs made it too greasy. I would suggest using fat free chicken broth to cook the noodles instead.
