Really good. I used rice wine vinegar because that's all I had, and added a sprinkle of dried thyme at the end. I also used bay scallops and didn't have to cook them in 2 batches. The sauce is indeed silky and flavorful. It's worth saving your allotment of saturated fat for the day and blowing it all on this dish.

This was an easy, quick, delicious recipe! I made a couple of minor changes: I halved it, added 1 minced garlic clove with the wine (I used dry vermouth) and vinegar, and added a sprinkle of tarragon both to the buerre blanc (at the end) and on top. Wonderful!

Rating: 4
Whew. This was fantabulous. The only thing I didn't follow on the recipe was wiping out the skillet between batches of scallops. That made it more of a buerre noisette I guess, but it was so darned delicious. I made this for friends and was nervous about doing a new recipe (to say nothing of the fact that I sometimes have difficulty following directions after a glass or two of wine, which was obviously going to happen when cooking with/for friends!), but the reviews were so good I couldn't resist. And since I'm making it in Phoenix I had a grocery store which actually HAD good scallops, unlike my home town store...carpe diem, baby! Oh, it might have helped a teeny bit that I served it over good mashed potatoes (got that brilliant idea from the Pink House in Savannah last weekend), which soaked up the rich, buttery brown sauce quite nicely, thank you very much!

The sauce was delicious and the scallops came out perfectly. I roasted the asparagus instead of sauteing them, to cut down on the oil. Also added some sauted garlic to the scallops as other reviewers suggested.

A very solid and simple recipe, but be sure to use good scallops. I substituted beer (a medium bodied ale) for the white wine, and added a little worcestershire sauce which worked out nicely. I also and also cut the butter back to 1/4 stick and the sause was still pretty buttery.

this was absolutely delicious -- we all loved it....i agree the only problem was the temperature so i reheated the scallops with the asparagus at the end. perhaps next time i will try to make the 2nd batch of scallops in a separate pan as the beurre blanc sauce is simmering. a keeper!

I wonder if the few reviewers who didn't care for this recipe used less-than-fresh scallops. I splurged on some fresh wild ones (we only had four each), and they were out of this world. I roasted some garlic, chopped it finely, and sauteed it with the asparagus (like another reviewer, I blanched the asparagus first), which livened up the sauce. To make up for the small portions of scallops, I also served a wild rice pilaf and a nice salad. My boyfriend was very pleased.

I don't know what people are fussing about, calling this recipe bland. It was perfectly delicious and allowed the flavor of the scallops to shine through. Also, to those who say 1/2 stick of butter was too much? I say too little! I doubled the beurre blanc recipe, served it with steamed white rice and watched three teenagers and myself make every last bit disappear!

This recipie was so easy and delicious. I had never made scallops prior to trying this, and everyone at my house was amazed! I will be making this again!

This turned out great. Really reminded me of a scallop version of Steak au Poivre. My scallops were extremely fresh and that made it that much better. The asparagus got a bit chilly while the scallops cooked so I tossed them back into the pan right after pouring out the sauce. I think if you warm asparagus this is going to be a requirement.

This was very good. I made it as directed but doubled the sauce and served it over linguine. Served with a spinach salad and sourdough bread. Lovely meal!

I have made this twice now, and still love it. I got home at 6 and ate by 7, including making angel hair pasta- which I highly recommend with this recipe. It probably took all of a half hour. I doubled the sauce and added a clove of garlic (grated) to the sauce at the end. Everyone has loved this-with and without the asparagus. The best part about this is that you can feed 4 for under $25. with a salad.

This recipe turned out great. Made it for my boyfriend and he was really impressed. One thing I did differently was to blanch the asparagus and not saute it. It kept the bright green color and I could control the doneness much better. I made the sauce in a separate pan than the scallops, didn't add the scallop juices and it gave it a cleaner butter flavor. Then I just heated up the blanched asparagus in the butter sauce and served over the scallops. Wonderful!

Very quick, very easy, not fussy. Just yummy. I divided the recipe in half, and it worked just fine. The flavors work well together. If you want a simple supper this is a good one. I will make this again.

I made this last night for some girlfriends and we all loved it. I am a beginner though and for others in the same boat - next time I would cook the scallops for 2 minutes on each side - and then before flipping maybe turn up the heat for 20 seconds or so to brown each side. I was very scared of over-cooking and would have appreciated this tip beforehand. I will definitely make this again! It was quick, easy, healthy, and delicious!

I added sliced crimini mushrooms, used Trader Joe's Lemon Pepper to season, used a pound of asparagus with 1 pound of scallops for two of us.

Made this twice now. Both times with the 2007 Cliff Lede Sauvignon Blanc. First time I did it verbatim, second time I added the shallots and tomotoes as suggested. Both ways worked, but with a really crisp wine, I like it better without the added shallots and tomatoes. The asparagus and the wine are so good together, diluting the asparagus with other vegetables reduces the overall effect.

Taking a hint from others, we used marinated scallops and wow! This is be a weekday regular in season.

I followed directions with the exception of steaming the asparagus in the microwave (3 minutes for one trimmed bunch and it's beautiful every time!). I, like some reviewers, found the scallops to be a drop bland. Good, but just not as exciting as some I've had in restaurants. Other than that, it was a great meal.

ON a whim, I bought scallops but didn't know what to do with them. I found this recipe and made it for myself. This is the best meal I have ever made for myself. The sauce was unbelievable, yum!

Rating: 4
This was great--used bay scallops so searing wasn't really possible due to the amount of liquid in the scallops but this still worked--I just poured off the liquid from each half of the scallops as it accumulated. Even though the scallops weren't "seared" as in crispy on the outside, the flavor was great. I added a couple cloves of garlic with the second half of the scallops. I also took the advice of a previous reviewer and sauted some diced tomatoes separately and then added them in a ring around the outside of the dish to serve--they really added a depth of flavor to the dish. Will definitely do this one again, on top of couscous next time.

I made this for valentine's day dinner for my hubby as he LOVES scallops and asparagus. the white wine sauce was absolutely delicious! I don't like scallops, so I made myself some chicken which tastes great with the sauce as well. I loved cooking the asparagus like that, it was so tasty and crisp. I would definitely recommend this recipe, and I will definitely be making it again. It was also fairly simple and fast.

Delicious, elegant, fast and simple. We are transplants from LA and accustomed to excellent seafood. This recipe does not disappoint. I made last night with a few modifications. I roasted aspargus in oven after tossing with a coating of olive oil and pinch of sea salt. Substitued about 3 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice for the white-wine vinegar. Next time, I will add 1/4 reduced chicken broth to the sauce, to make more yummy sauce while reducing the butter. For added flavor and color, I sauted 2 diced tomatoes, (peeled, seeded) with a pinch of sugar and sea salt). Beautiful presentation with scallops served on bed of Israli couscous, and garnished with the tomato.

An excellent recipe for scallops and a favorite - asparagus. I made this for my parents for Christmas Eve as illness prevented them from attending the traditional Italian "fish" dinner. I did cut the dish down for 2 servings. They did eat it with steamed white rice and loved every bite. I have made it for myself since and will continue to make it once in a while. Unlike others, I always try to follow the recipe exactly the first time and rate it that way. Then, I will experiment with personal changes/additions.

This recipe was excellent; the beurre blanc was a great sauce for the asparagus and the scallops. I didn't have white-wine vinegar, so I used a bit more wine and regular 1 teaspoon of vinegar. I also cut the recipe in half in terms of the scallops and asparagus, but made the standard amount of sauce, which worked well.

Rating: 4
This was easy and great! I did add a minced garlic clove to the asparagus and the recipe could easily be made less fattening by using a LOT less oil to sear the scallops by using cooking spray (1 T is too much oil especially since the scallops have a lot of their own juices that come out when cooking) Important to pat them dry in order to get a good sear. I also added a tsp. of lemon juice to the reduction and it is important to use no salt butter at the end, otherwise it's too salty (as I found out)

This is indeed a great recipe! I took the advice of previous reviewers and sprinkled the scallops with creole seasoning. I also used halved cherry tomatoes and sauted them with the asparagus. However, no dish is good without garlic, so I sauted 3 cloves of minced garlic in the oil before adding the veggies. Also used a splash of lemon juice at the end. Definitely a keeper!

Loved the delicate sauce. My husband hates scallops. When I made this dish he practically licked the plate.

Rating: 4
Delicious. Honestly- this is a keeper. A few comments? I learned that using canola oil instead of olive oil gives you much better results when searing- it burns hotter to give a nice dark crust without overcooking. Also- per another reviewer: the alcohol cooks off of wine when cooking (!!). And as for the butter- sure there's fat but it makes the dish and is delicious. Leave it in and use the good European butter like Plugra. Life is too short not to enjoy it in a recipe like this

I have made this recipe twice now and absolutely loved it. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and although it was delicious, I thought it was lacking something. The second time, I reduced the scallops to 1 lb. and added 1 lb of shrimp. I also replaced the salt and pepper with Creole seasoning which added a little spice and was absolutley incredible. I will absolutley make this again.

This recipe was excellent, and with the nutritional benefits of both scallops and asparagus, how can you go wrong? ...butter. I made the recipe with 6 scallops and 1/3 a bunch of asparagus (perfect for 1 person), but I made all of the sauce. First, I sauteed the scallops in fat-free olive oil cooking spray (3- 4 second spray to coat the pan). I did not wipe the pan after the asparagus, and I added about 1 sec. more of cooking spray before I sauteed the scallops. (Caution: Fat- free cooking spray DOES have fat, but the little amount of fat in a quick spray falls within the no-fat guidelines of the FDA! ) I only used 1 tbsp of butter in the sauce, and it was very good. However, it would not have made enough sauce for additional servings. Next time I might reduce the vinegar. You DO NOT need all of that butter. My recipe may have not turned out as the creator imagined, but again, it was excellent and MUCH healthier!

This was terrific and easy too. I added some grape tomatoes that I had which I sliced in half. They added a bit of depth to the recipe and some color too. If you make this addition they don't need long to cook so add them just a couple minutes before the asparagus is finished.

I made this recipe for my husband and myself with half the amount of scallops very quickly and easily. It requires very little cooking skills but tastes like a grand recipe with the excellent sauce! I actually used champagne white wine vinegar and added in addition, some white asparagus (which are now in season in April here) to fill up the plate. It tasted fabulous! The presentation looks like in some fancy restaurant too. Made to impress with little time to cook! We will definitely be making this again!

Just made this and it was delicious; got rave reviews from my partner. I halved the recipe since it was for 2, used slightly less than half the butter, used rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar since that's what was on hand, and added a sprinkle of garlic powder on the asparagus since i can't live without garlic. Was surprised how quick and easy for such great flavor.
