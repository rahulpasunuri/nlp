This recipe calls for separate measurements of whole coriander and ground coriander. Then the whole coriander is ground and added to the ground coriander. I would recommend combining these to one measurement of 6T fresh ground coriander. To add a bit more complex flavors, separately toast the spices a bit and then let them cool before grinding. Really wakes up the essential oils. Dry spices of suspect age often need the extra boost. I would also crush a few bay leaves into this cure for posterity. Cheers!

Dan Barber is an exceptional chef, I had the privilege of working for him briefly at Stone Barns. Blue Hills is what all the forward thinking restaurants try to emulate now. This recipe is great!

This is a fragrant and delicious spice mix! I made it for the pork belly also on epicurious. OMG, amazing. i didn't have any white peppercorns, and used black instead. Otherwise, i left the recipe as is. Scrumptious, flavorful, and fragrant. This recipe does yield a lot. I recommend halving the recipe, or putting half aside and using for future dishes (which is what i'm doing and still experimenting). EXCELLENT!
