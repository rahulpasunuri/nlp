This was good and relatively healthful, so I would make it again for guests.

Lovely dish, really, and thankfully simple! What a charming way to add sparkle to carrots! I recommend it as a side dish that willl add 'oomph' to the main.

Another vote for making this dish a day ahead.

I made this with 1/3 parsnips and 2/3 carrots. Also much less butter, about a third of a stick. It was fabulous, we had it for Passover and everyone loved it.

A burst of flavour! Wonderful combo and great colour on the plate. Definitely make ahead and let the falvours meld.

I just wasn't loving this. It felt like I was eating baby food.

This was a simple, no fuss vegetable side dish bursting with flavor. I noticed that you hardly need any salt at all to bring out the flavors. In fact I only used 1/8 tsp. This would make an excellent filling for a vegetarian ravioli.

Delicious made exactly as directed--except I used well-scrubbed, unpeeled organic carrots. My guests raved.

I've made this dish twice, and everyone has loved it. The only change I made is that I used 1 Tbsp of ginger. This is one of my favorite vegetable dishes.

I agree with the person who wrote that this is better the next day. I made it for a family function for which I had to prepare it one day ahead then reheat it. Everyone really liked it - my mother-in-law loved it enough to keep the leftovers for herself - but it was a little too 'orangey' for my tastes. Would probably make again, as it is pretty easy and good for a make-ahead vegetable, and generally well-accepted for group dinners. I imagine it would make a nice soup too.

Just made this for Easter (with stuffed pork) and it was fabulous. Followed the recipe exactly and didnt find the ginger overpowering. Was so nice to have something that I could make ahead and just zap in Microwave. It was very light and fluffy and the color was beautiful. Would love a recommendation how to reduce the amt of butter - just cant figure out what to replace it with

I'm away at school without my food processor, so I left the carrots in coins. I also cooked the juice/ginger mixture until it reached the consistency of a glaze. The resulting side dish had wonderful flavor. This is simple enough to do often.

Would not make this again. Despite following the directions, it just didn't taste right. No one at the Thanksgiving table would touch it. It was unappetizing both visually and to the taste.

I have made it almost every year since 1998. It may not be the most attractive dish to guests, but they love it!

A flavorful delight! I scaled down the recipe to use a one pound bag of baby carrots, and it worked fine, making a perfect side dish to feed four. I used refrigerated pasteurized orange juice rather than fresh, given that it was going to be heated anyhow, and I was very pleased with the results. The orange zest is crucial, as is the ginger root. Also, I needed to add a touch of sea salt and a bit more lemon juice, perhaps because I had a particularly sweet bunch of carrots. My husband, who doesn't particularly like carrots and yesterday told me he doesn't like ginger, took three helpings! And my son, who won't eat vegetables, ate this.

This is very good but I used half of the orange rind. It almost tasted like boiled yams, and I think it's probably good with all birds and with salmon too.

A lovely side dish with great flavor and color. Rather than blend/puree, I simply mashed the carrots so they still had some texture in deference to a picky house guest who I was sure would think I was serving "baby food". Next time I will puree as directed. A nice change of pace from glazed carrots.

I very rarely rate a recipe a "4", but this one is deserving. Happened to make it for Christmas Dinner (with prime rib, roasted potatoes and Yorkshire pudding) a day before to minimize cooking day of. Flavors were intense and delicious. Color was spectacular on the plate. We ate the leftovers the rest of the week. Used carrots and really liked it. Even my husband who does not like carrots ate this one up!

A wonderful side dish to pork roast with ginger and orange sauce. Colourful, flavorful and delicious. Perfect for a festive ocasion for you can make it day or two ahead.

I substituted sweet potatoes for the carrots and make a point of using oganic oranges for the juice and peel. Everyone loved it, even my 9 yr old -sweet potato hater!!

I substituted sweet potatoes for the carrots and loved it. The first time I made it, I followed recipe to a t. One guest commented that these were the best sweet potatoes he had ever eaten (and they were!) The second time I had to not quite double the recipe and my flavor was off a bit. So, stick to the recipe (and try sweet potato!) Also great because you can make 1-2 days in advance and easily reheat. Helps the flavors to meld too.

I made it this the other day using Odwalla 100% pure pressed carrot juise ( a company out here in Nothern California that sells organic carrot juice) and it lifted this meal from a 2 forker to 4! The carrot flavors were intence and I will definitely make this one again with the Odwalla juice. Thank you again Epicurious.com

This is a WONDERFUL recipe. THe first time I made it, I decided that it was too much trouble and not all that great, but then I had the leftovers a couple of days later and finally figured it out. Just like lots of great recipes, this is much better a day or two after it's made. All of the flavors really come together. Also, be sure to really puree well until the mixture is sort of "fluffy." It makes an absolutely beautiful presentation. Even my very finicky fiancee requests this one. I can certainly understand how some might think it's bland if they ate it the day of preparing it. Also, I added an extra tablespoon or 2 of sugar and cut just a tad off of the ginger to keep it from being quite so potent. This is a great dish for adults and kids, for any occasion!

I used baby carrots and the bottled orange peel (found in the spice section), powdered ginger and I did not puree the carrots. Fast and yummy.

This Thanksgiving is the second time I made this dish for my family and once again it was a hit!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving. I did add one sweet potatoe, (microved the potatoe for about 7 minutes) then added it to the carrots. We only had five people to dinner and everyone tucked in to the dish and thought it excellent.

This was an excellent dish, even for carrot-haters, and easy. After I saw the praise heaped upon this recipe, I had to try it! I was skeptical but it was as good as everyone said. Everyone loved it.

I added one baked acorn squash to the ingredient list and cut the carrots down to 1/.5-2 lbs. Made this for Christmas last year and it was awesome.

I have three words for this dish: Fab-u-lous! I was a little worried about serving pureed food to my Thanksgiving dinner guests but they were unanimous in their praise. Gorgeous colour and exquisite flavour - a perfect complement to a harvest meal. And super easy too. It doesn't get much better than that.

Didn't cook the carrots for so long or puree them...results were TO DIE FOR. Wonderfully sweet.

Absolutely delicious. It couldn't hurt that there's an entire stick of butter in it, but I think this is one of the best recipes I've ever made from Epicurious. Looking for a crowd-pleasing advance-prep veggie? This is it.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving this year. One might never guess that it's a carrot dish; looks more like a beautiful squash dish. Even those who are not carrot-lovers will probably enjoy it; my niece doesn't care for carrots, but commented that it was "sooo good!"

This is a fabulous carrot recipe! Everyone to whom I serve it asks for the recipe. I make a double recipe and freeze it it one pint containers. My 8 month old grandson devours it in large quantities....it's just great.
