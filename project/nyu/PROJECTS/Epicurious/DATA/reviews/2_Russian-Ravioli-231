I agree with Cocofalco and Orlando. It sounded good but was very bland and impossible to make. You cannot seal a "generous 1 Tablespoon" of filling into a little won ton wrapper. None of mine sealed, and when boiled, it became an amorphous, watery glop. Strangely enough, the children liked it! I guess because it was bland. And the wrapper was all slimy and ick. It was not redeemed the next day by baking it in the oven with garlic butter poured on top, either.

I wouldn't even try to make it. I am Russian/Ukrainian, born in West Ukraine, grew up and lived for 35 years in Moscow. NEVER even heard of using cabbage+barley+feta to fill PELMENI - or VARENIKI, or more common name for an American ear - PIROGI. First of all - Russians don't have feta cheese, period. There is a close cheese we call BRYNZA, which is harder than feta. You actually can shred BRYNZA. It is used sometimes in salads, sometimes, when it is not too salted, we eat it with black Russian rye bread, garnished with dill, parsley or cilantro. No feta, though. Somebody commented that the recipe sounds like a famous Russian soup. That is right. If you want to make real Russian ravioli - search for PELMENI recipe.

For those of you who are russian who had difficulty with the name of this ravioli, russian dressing should also be blamed: "Actually American in origin, this salad dressing includes mayonnaise, pimiento, chili sauce (or ketchup), chives and various herbs. Some think that the "Russian" title comes from the fact that earlier versions of this dressing contained CAVIAR, for which Russia has long been famous." -food dictionary of epicurious.com Should somebody suggest that this would be a russian meal, they'd also suggest french fries were French instead of it's proper ancestor, pomme frites.

As soon as I saw the words "low-fat," I knew this couldn't be a real Russian recipe. I lived in Russia for years and never saw any ravioli (or 'pelmeni') made with rice, barley, feta, or dill. Real pelmeni are stuffed with minced meat and onions, made with homemade dough, and are absolutely delicious. I haven't tried the recipe listed here. Whatever you do, though, don't make this for a Russian audience and tell them it's a Russian recipe.

I didn't make this recipe, but the name Russian Ravioli caught my eye and I wanted to comment. A true Russian dish would not use won ton wrappers. The dough is a classic egg noodle dough made with flour and lots of eggs. The fillings would be either mashed potatoe, cabbage, meat or cheese. The filled dough is boiled for about 10 minutes or until done, and some times fried in butter and onions after boiling to give a crisp outer skin. It would be served with sour cream or sauted onions. Russian names for the several variations are: Pel Meni, Ver-ren-ki, and pit-a-he.

Though I'm russian I've never heard about this recipe.It sounds very unusual.The "very russian" ravioli or PELMENI are made from ground meat,ground fish(mostly in Northen parts of country),mushed potato or farmer cheese(or ricotta cheese).The filling in this recipe (cabbage with onion and barley) looks more like ingradient for very famous russian soup.Russian recipe for pelmeni always requires sour cream or butter with vinegar.Maybe your recipe is very delicious.But don't call it RUSSIAN.

I made this recipe with barley and it turned it out great. The only thing I did differently was add some cinnamon when cooking the cabbage, that makes a big difference. Otherwise, it's a pretty good recipe, time consuming, but good.

This was really bad. The recipe looked great, but was bland and had an awful texture. Don't waste your time!

This caught my eye as a non-meat dish until I tasted it. A touch of ham or bacon would add what seemed to be missing in taste. If I were to make it again some would definately be added. There are too many other untasted meals available here for me to do this one again, as I feel it needs more umph to it to be a satisfying dish.
