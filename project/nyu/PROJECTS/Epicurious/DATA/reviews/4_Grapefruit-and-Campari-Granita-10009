Devine! Served this as a palate cleanser between courses at a dinner party. Garnished with a sprig of fresh mint, which went wonderfully. A keeper recipe that is very forgiving. I have also made this with France's Lillet fortified wine, and it was a stunner. Next time I want to try it with champagne!

This is absolutely delicious and the easiest dessert you will ever make. I have made this several times now, sometimes with campari, sometimes with 3/4 cup pinot noir instead, and it's always amazing (I've also made it without alcohol and it's still very tasty). If you can't get good grapefruit (or are too lazy to squeeze them), a quality grapefruit juice still makes for a delicious granita, though the pulp is pleasant. I also have forgotten to stir and mash in the hours after making it but the granita is easily mashed at a later time. Try this recipe, you will not regret it!!

This recipe is perfect as it is - do not change a thing. Bright, fresh grapefruit flavor that is enhanced by the Campari. The stirring is crucial to get the right consistency and texture. I absolutely love this recipe!

I have been making this recipe so long I thought it was my own invention. It is perfect - just as it is - in every way. It was the recipe that taught me that every fruit has a complimentary liquor - one that makes it MORE of what it already is. Another, for instance is cantelope and madeira.

I have made this a number of times. The last was a big hit. My guests asked for "seconds" on dessert!

I agree with the other viewer. This is wonderful especialy if served just before the main course.

This granita is fantastically refreshing and delicious! I served it in tiny cocktail glasses with a demitasse spoon before the main course at a formal summer dinner party. My guests were ecstatic. The remainder kept well for weeks; most of it went surreptitiously, spoonful by spoonful, but once we enjoyed it with icy vodka poured over.
