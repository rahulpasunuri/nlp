I love this recipe, and I make it a lot during the summer (without seeing it ever..) I use more wine for falvor.. it works well with chopped Italian parsley instead of basil as well.

Interesting recipe. There are many dish with fusilli and squids; my recipe is without tomatoes, capers and raisin, and has only carrots, zucchini, artichokes, squids and a bunch of aromatic herbs. If you want to take a look my recipe: http://www.academiabarilla.com/recipes/search-recipes/fusilli-pasta-salad-with-vegetables-squid.aspx

If you follow this recipe carefully, you will definitely not over-cook the squid. However, you may undercook them. I found it necessary to cook the squid a bit longer than stated. In the end, the squid were not over cooked, but the sauce was a bit disappointing. It seemed to be missing something and for me, the raisins did not add much (and maybe detracted) from the overall flavor. I'm will not make this again, but will certainly use some of the techniques that ensure not overcooking the squid in future cooking endeavors.

Simple, fast, fresh and delicious. Can't imagine why some people don't enjoy this dish: perhaps they substituted something? At any rate, as is, the flavour marriage is absolutely perfect. If you like more heat, add a touch of red pepper flakes while sauteeing.

The flavor was a bit bland. Possibly due to that fact that I only had frozen squids. Used red bell pepper instead of tomatoes (husband doesn't like) and pecans instead of pine nuts (didn't have). Did not add raisins because I'm not that enthusiastic about them. Might try dates next time. And I will definitely add anchovies and sliced black olives the next time.

I tried 2 versions, the second time I swapped out the squid for shrimp, and liked it better. Changes that I made: Whole Wheat Fussili, 3 serranos chopped and sauted with the garlic, 1 pint of tomatoes halved, lemon juice along with zest, and no raisins. Everything else was followed as written and this dish it delicious. I will be making this at least every other week, and I bet it will even be good cold tomorrow. A true crowd pleaser in our house!

A fast and fantastic meal. I made almost exactly as given, but with whole wheat pasta, currants instead of raisins and only half the olive oil. The flavors are rich and beautifully balanced, with a pleasing hint of heat. I used fresh squid from the Greenmarket; it was already cleaned, so this took less than 20 minutes start to finish. It's beautiful, too.

Very quick and delicious!!! Took no time to prepare....Love the raisins with the spice and saltiness of capers, very nice match. So good my six year old ate three helpings.(they weren't small either)

Excellent recipe. Substituted currants for the raisins, since they are similar in size to the capers and are less sweet than raisins. My husband loved the contrast in flavors. Will definitely make this again!

Well, we had fresh caught local squid, and added a bit of precious abalone, home grown tomatoes and basil, and we used everything else as directed and were disappointed after all the effort. If we're ever lucky enough to have an abundance of squid again, I may try the recipe for a 2nd chance, but I certainly won't buy squid just to make this. The only suspect in this crime would be the Trader Joes capers...any ideas?

I thought this sauce was very tasty, but it overpowered the squid. I would use it with a stronger-flavored fish, but squid needs something less powerful, I think.

Excellent marriage of ingredients . . . Don't fchange a thing! But of course . . . at our home . . . we had to use more Thai chilis because we like the heat!

My whole family loved this dish. I'm not a big fan of pine nuts so I substituted roasted cashews instead and it came delicious. We finished the whole thing and wanted more. This one's a winner.

This was incredibly good, with wonderful bright/piquant flavors, and very easy. I used frozen squid in a bag from Trader Joe's, which I thawed in a colander before using, and it came out extremely well. One great thing about the recipe is that almost all of the ingredients are regular pantry-shelf items (especially if you use TJs frozen squid!) so you can make it on a moment's notice. I used fusilli lunghi--long corkscrews--but bucatini (hollow spaghtetti) would also be good; I don't think I'd like it as much with campanelle or another small pasta. I could also imagine eating it as a stew without pasta. Definitely a keeper, for weeknights and for dinner guests!

It is squid season on Cape Cod and this recipe is a great find. I used half the pasta and two of us ate the whole thing.

This was delicious! I actually made it with scallops and shrimp. And, I made a vegetarian version by omitting all seafood that was equally as good (I added some pecorino cheese on top)!

This recipe is excellent with sea scallops substituted for the squid. The sweetness of the scallops complements the raisins really well.

This was delicious, I'll definitely make it again. I'd like to serve it for company, but I'm not sure how many people eat squid. I wonder if it's possible to substitute chicken breast? Maybe that's sacriligious.

A great dish, and easy to make. The saltiness of the capers together with the sweetness of raisins and the freshness of the lemon zest made for a lovely combination of flavors. I think the reviewers who substituted olives for the raisins may have missed out on a special treat. I did not have fresh basil at this time of year, so I had to use dried, and instead of pasta, I served the squid concoction with quinoa. No problems with either substitution. I will make this again!

Definitely a keeper! Tasty, simple to make, and healthy. I used the suggestion of another reviewer and added olives in place of the conversial raisins.

I used this recipe to enhance Marcella Hazan's simple recipe. I omitted much of ingredients -- nuts, raisins, wine, lemon, and used canned tomatoes. Delicious.

I highly recommend using the raisins. It is such an excellent combination of flavors. Sweet with spicy, salty capers and the pine nuts, and the wonderful squid. Can't wait to make it again!

This dish was so light and elegant, well-balanced flavors. I took the advice of another reviewer and substituted black olives for raisins...delicious. Not one ingredient took over the dish: you taste everything! I added more fresh garlic, a dusting of cayenne to bring out the serrano pepper, , and drizzled basil oil on top before serving. Served with shaved romano cheese and rosemary bread, this dish was a perfect main course.

This dish was really good...and was so light-that could be used as a first course, as well.

Great recipe! As my tasters are not fans of raisins, I substituted black olives for the raisins. Received raves!
