The salad dressing was excellent. I didn't toast the almonds and used fewer oranges. Delicious, fast, easy.

YUMMMMY I was cheap and only had 1 orange and no orange juice, so I just squeezed a bit from the remains of the peel when I cut the top & bottom off, and it was fine for 2 people. The cut up oranges get juice all over the salad anyway. Omitted green onions and tarragon. Chopped up some whole roasted almonds. Worked great and we wished I made more.

this was fantastic and "seems" fancy when you serve it, even though it's fairly simple to make. i added feta cheese and it was equally tasty. i've already made it twice and will make it again for sure!

A great(lighter) alternative to my standard Spinach salad. Served it for Easter dinner with Paella Valenciana from Saveur and it was approved by the family! Omited the tarragon as many others- want to love that herb, but just don't like it's flavor. A bit of flat leaf parsley or cilantro depending on the meal it's going with are much more to my liking. Love all of the ideas for marinating chicken in it for a main dish salad idea.

I omitted the green onions and added a pinch of salt. Also used pineapple/orange juice and a little more tarragon. Very refreshing.

Very tasty salad. Makes nice addition to brunch. I used red onion in the salad instead of green onion in dressing, which was pretty and tasty. I recommend serving dressing on side. I've made this salad twice, the last time dressing it right before serving, and it was still wilty.

A great salad. I used cilantro instead of tarragon because it was what I had on hand.

I've made this salad a bunch of times. It is amazing if you are in a rush and don't have time to fuss around with a more complicated salad. Saying that however, it doesn't taste like an easily made salad and everyone always compliments me on it. I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and clementines when they are in season - like right now!

This recipe is a great compliment to any oriental style main course. It was fresh and light. I used mandarine orange sections along with baby spinach and the fresh tarragon was a nice curve. I am always looking for different ways to use the tarragon in my garden. This is a new Favorite

Delicious. Used canola oil and pecans. Had no fresh tarragon so used dried. All was fine!

Really enjoyed this - used much less onion in the dressing and put the rest on the side to sprinkle over. Omitted tarragon. Try olive oil next time. Refreshing - the oranges were a bit too much citrus - would use one less and cut the segments in half to spread more evenly. Will make again

Too much onion flavor. If I made it again, I would leave onion out of dressing, put sliced onion in salad, so those who don't like it can pick it out.

Wonderful dish! I made it for a dinner party. It was tasted clean, fresh, and healthy!

This is a "summer" version of spinach salad--the orange and tarragon combo makes the heavy, rich leaves (I use regular, wash-it-yourself spinach) light and bright. I used E.V. olive oil and added slices of a mini cucumber variety, otherwise followed recipe as written.

I have made this recipe several times and it is one of the most refreshing salads I've ever had. I always use olive oil instead of vegetable oil and I don't care for tarragon, so omit it. For a complete meal, I sometimes marinate 2 chicken breast halves (pounded thin) in part of the dressing for about an hour, grill, and serve on a bed of baby salad greens along with some grilled zuchinni, corn, tomatoes, cilantro, avacado & maybe some black beans & baked tortilla chips. Great!

Definitely worth making. I used olive oil, didn't feel like buying tarragon. It came out great.

Fantastic, easy recipe. I don't alter anything. I've made this for countless parties and have always been asked for the recipe. I also make this often for my family - delicious way to serve spinach.

YUM! This was very good. I served this with ORZO WITH SHRIMP, FETA CHEESE, AND WHITE WINE on this site and got rave compliments on both recipes. I don't like tarragon, so left it our of the salad dressing. Both recipes are keepers!

I have made this several times and it has become one our favorites. The dressing is so light and refreshing. I use olive oil and don't care for tarragon, so leave it out. I have also made a whole different salad using the dressing: Marinate 2-3 chicken breasthalves in about 1/3 of the dressing for about 1 hour, grill and set on top of a bed of baby salad greens. Add sliced, grilled zuchinni or fresh corn (or both), cilantro, avacado, black beans, tomatoes, or whatever sounds good to you. Top with a few baked tortilla strips and the reserved dressing.Yummy.

I made some fundmental changes to this recipe but not because I tried it and thought it needed any. I just prefer a heartier salad so I added grilled chicken which I marinanted for a short time in oil and seasoned with salt and pepper. I also added the candies pecans from another spinach salad recipe on this site in place of the almonds. Finally, I added goat cheese. The fresh oranges, spinach, nuts and cheese tasted truly wonderful on the spinach with this dressing. Based on other reviews, I added a bit more honey and used seasoned rice vinegar for more zip. I thought the fresh tarragon added great flavor. I will make this often.

My husband and I were looking for a dressing to put on a salad to serve with Fried Rice. This dressing was perfect! We added avacado and used mixed greens (what we had on hand)and thought it was a great combination. I agree that it was a bit watery but was a nice light dressing. Will make again.

This is a summer time staple. I've served it at many dinner parties and have gotten wonderful comments from guests. I always use mandarins (much easier and quicker). I also use season rice vinegar and add extra tarragon for more zip.

A nice little salad.. tasty.. Went well with ham and sweet potatoes. All I had was seasoned rice vinegar, so used regular white vinegar.

Very easy, very tasty. I cheated a little and used OJ from a carton and mandarin oranges, as someone else suggested. I don't think the salad suffered any, judging from its disappearance from the salad bowl into peoples' tummies. A great salad for someone, like my mom, who's on a restricted sodium diet.

I made this for a dinner party and my guests seemed to really enjoy it. Instead of using a bunch of oranges and dealing with pith, I just used a can of mandarins. I liked it.

I liked the flavor of this dressing, but not the consistency. I found it sort of watery (the orange juice), so added more olive oil. My guests enjoyed it a lot.

I made this for a family dinner and everyone LOVED it. I thought it was standard when i first tried the dressing, but after transporting it to our relatives house and after the dressing had sat for a while, the tarragon really came through and people LOVED it. Everyone asked what was in it and several asked for the recipe. I used olive oil, seasoned rice vinegar and mandarin oranges. I also squirted a bit of dijon mustard in to give more zest. I highly reccomend it!!

This recipe was easy to make and was delicious. It was a real change to the traditional salads with vineger we make at home. I already had all the ingredients in the house, but I did use mandarin oranges. My children really liked it too!

This spinach salad is good and simple. The toasted almonds are a great touch. It borders on a bit boring, but is great for someone who prefers a mild, subtle spinach salad as opposed to a spinach/pear/gorgonzola/walnut style, which has more pronounced flavors.

Bonnie from Orlando - This is a delicious warm weather salad. I used toasted walnuts because I didn't have any almonds and we loved it. I think pecans would be good also. I don't think you can beat fresh oranges for this salad. I know it is a lot of trouble, but it is worth it.

Loved this dressing but felt the tarragon overpowered it. I used canned mandarin oranges and no orange peel. I will definitely make it again, it's so quick and easy, but I will leave out the tarragon next time.

i have made this recipe 3 times now. its pretty good. it is a pain to cut the oranges so next time i will give canned mandarin i try but for the non-winter months it is a pretty decent salad especially if you are serving asian fare.

I used chives instead of onions - put it all in a blender. It turns a wonderful mint green color. I also used mandarine oranges.

This was a very nice salad. I simplified it by using a can of mandarin orange segments and Tropicana orange juice. I also used basalmic vinegar instead of the rice vinegar and it was very delicious - even with the improvisations.

This was actually really nice, the dressing was lovely. We used mandarin oranges(packed in water, don't use the ones packed in syrup) to save time. Also mache lettuce.

To the cook wondering about oil substitutions...I use canola oil in place of vegetable oil for health. (Canola oil is a type of vegetable oil.) Olive oil could be substituted, but it will have an olive flavor. My guess is that the recipe was developed using a neutral-flavored oil that doesn't overpower the orange juice.

Is it okay to substitute olive or canola oil in this and other salad dressing recipes that call for vegetable oil?

I hate to be the rain on this parade but I was pretty disappointed with the vinagrette! Not the greatest taste and I found it separated worse than other vinagrettes I've tried. The toasted almonds and oranges (I used mandarin) were a great combo, though!

I love this light, tasty dressing! I, too, added sliced raw mushrooms to the baby spinach. I used clementines, rather than ordinary oranges, as they don't require the laborious pith removal and are a bit tastier.

Rating: 3
A really nice light salad. I also added fresh mushrooms and I didn't use slivered almonds. I crushed into large chunks dry roasted almonds and they were heavenly - gave the salad a nice texture. I also used canned mandarines and the zest from a tangerine - yum! A keeper.

This is delicious, with light, bright, intriguing flavors. It's the first salad I've ever made for Thanksgiving dinner that actually got entirely eaten up. I used a can of mandarin oranges, which looked pretty and tasted great.

Served this to a group last night and everyone loved it. I was leery of mixing tarragon with spinach, but that turned out to be what made the the dressing so intriguing. It is essential, of course, to use really good oranges.

If I could give this recipe 6 forks, I would!! Even my doctor approved of the dressing!! I only used 1 tablespoon oil and frozen concentrated orange juice (diluted half and half with water). I also used half spinach and half romaine lettuce and substituted canned Mandarin oranges. Wonderful dressing I'll be using often!!

This salad was great. My husband even commented on how good it was! I used fresh sliced strawberries instead of oranges and sliced the onions into the salad rather than dicing. The dressing was delicious and light. Definitely a weekly salad in my book.

Just great--everyone was quite impressed. Made without the tarragon and it was fine. Cutting the orange pieces into bite-size chunks seems like a good idea too, I'll try that next time. You have to have good, fresh oranges though--essential!

Outstanding. Made this for a special gathering and everyone loved it. Did not use spinach -- instead I used a bagged European salad blend with red leaf, green leaf, frise, bib and radicchio. Used O.J. & navel oranges cut into bite size pieces. Use the best fresh oranges you can buy!

I made this for Easter Sunday dinner and it was a big hit. Sectioning the oranges was well worth it as it made for a beautiful presentation, I plan to make again, but omit or reduce the fresh tarragon. It is a strong enough salad without it. For those of you who are looking for a variation on a plain spinach salad, this is a keeper.

I served this salad to another couple. We had mixed reviews. One person loved it. Two people said it was o.k. and the fourth didn't like it at all. I thought it was refreshing and more of a summer salad. I used canned mandarine oranges because the fresh oranges I purchased ended up being tough and stringy. I also mixed the spinach with romain lettuce. The almonds gave it a nice crunchy texture. I don't think I will be making this again.
