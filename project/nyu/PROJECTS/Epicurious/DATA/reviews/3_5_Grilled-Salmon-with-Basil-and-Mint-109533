Delicious! Served it with chili pepper and lime green beans for a fantastic combination.

Very nice and easy. Fresh mint and basil from my garden made this a last minute favorite.

Made this for a quick weeknight dinner (also cooked the grilled sweet potoatoes recipe found on epicurious). Didn't have any lemon or mint, used only lime and basil. Very yummy! Be sure to serve the grilled citrus with the fish - I served the fish on top of the grilled lime. That way when you cut into the fish, you pick up the flavor - that's the key! I let the basil go too long in the skillet and ended up with almost "fried basil" - which you can do, but next time, I will be sure just to wilt it.

I made this for 2 with the indoor grill pan instructions and it was very good. The citrus slices definitely were more of a garnish but squeezed nicely onto the fish. Used about two cups of fresh mint and basil, reducing the oil to about 3T and we were delighted with the flavor in combination with the salmon.

I was looking for a simple grilled salmon recipe. But I did make a couple of changes. I used 1 lime, 1 lemon and 1 orange. I used fresh dill from my garden. The orange was really the best, most edible of the citrus, and the dill in olive oil was fine.

We had this for Easter dinner and received rave reviews from everyone. The grilled citrus with a nice touch and the resulting juices adding some depth. This recipe will be included in my favorite salmon dish collection.

This was surprisingly tasty for such a simple dish. For best flavor, use more of the greens when making the oil. Make sure you use the best fish you can get. Straightforward and good!

A very simple dish to prepare. I really enjoyed the grilled citrus. The presentation is simple and nice with the green cilantro on top of the red fish garnished with the grilled citrus wedges. Very quick to prepare.

I'd maybe give this recipe another try, but I honestly didn't think the basil mint oil was that flavorful. I used fresh basil and mint from my garden, and it didn't give the oil as much flavor as I had hoped. Maybe next time I'll chop it up a little more before I add it to the oil. However, I did enjoy the grilled lemons.

Loved this. Reduced it to feed 2. Every bite was a delight. The citrus slices, though good, are optional. The herb sauce turned our favorite fish into a masterpiece. Definitely a keeper.

My friend and I followed the recipe exactly, except for reducing portions from 6 to 2. We used the side burner on the gas grill to prepare the herb sauce while the Copper River King Salmon cooked on the main grill. Results were excellent. We really liked the grilled citrus slices and thought they were worth the effort; they were chewy and flavorful and compensated for the potatoes we have given up. We did brush some crusty bread slices with olive oil and grilled them alongside the lemons and limes---easy and tasty. We loved the herb sauce but would double the herbs next time. We served the salmon with a salad of greens from the farmers market dressed with a light vinaigrette (red wine vinegar, fresh garlic, 1 T dijon mustard, 1 t sugar, extra virgin olive oil, sea salt and fresh ground pepper). We prepared this simple dinner in 90 minutes, but next time it would probably take half that time. We think we could prepare the meal as quickly for four or six people as for two.

Very simple but a nice change to grilled salmon. of which I eat a lot. I saw no advantage to grilling the lemon and lime except for presentation. Also, it was a nice way to use some herbs that needed trimming.

Made this since it was one of the very few grill recipes in Gourmet's so-called grill issue. Nothing special.
