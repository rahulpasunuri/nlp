This salad was fantastic, even though I sauteed the vegetables instead of bbq-ing them(it was raining :) and used olive oil with lemon as I had no truffle olive oil. A definite repeat!

We turned this into a chopped salad, using green beans, wax beans, radicchio, red pepper and artichoke hearts. It was a very pretty dish with grilled meat. I have never grilled beans before, and they were excellent. As a chopped salad, it needs much less dressing; maybe one-third of the amount called for in the recipe. Canned artichokes don't really cut it in this dish, so we will either use fresh or skip them next time.

I was looking for a pasta salad vinaigrette. The truffle oil intrigued me - excellent flavorful addition. Cut the olive oil by 2/3. My main dish consisted of pesto marinated chicken breasts (shredded), yellow, red peppers, red onion, zuchinni, all grilled. Added cheese tortellini, fresh herbs, and tossed with vinaigrette. Family really liked it.

I find this salad truly addictive, but the bitterness of radicchio is an aquired taste. I don't recommend serving this to guests unless you're certain they eat greens like arugula, etc. Otherwise, go for it!

Wow. No one has mentioned the green beans - they are transformed into something incredible. I was leary of grilling them, now I would serve them on there own. The beans with the most black parts were the yummiest. The artichokes needed to be cut in half after grilling. This salad is a keeper. I added the truffle oil to the dressing just before serving to keep the full aroma. I served it at room temperature and it was great.

The combination of truffle oil and lemon is fabulous. I served the grilled vegetables on a bed of frisee and the texture combination was great!

This was not all that fabulous, and given the price of radicchio, I doubt I'll make it again. I didn't think the dressing was anything special, in spite of the truffle oil.

Made it for dinner at a gourmet club dinner. The salad has a beautiful presentation. Dressing was good that night....leftover the next day, it was a little oil-heavy. Perfect summer grill recipe!

Terrific summer salad. Will definitely make it again. Had to add additional sugar to the dressing otherwise it would have been too tart. Served the salad with a German Reisling - it was a good pairing.

Terrific - it becomes a favorite of everyone who tries it. We've served it at three parties since seeing it in Bon Appetit a few weeks ago!
