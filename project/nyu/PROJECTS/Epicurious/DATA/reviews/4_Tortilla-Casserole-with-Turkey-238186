This is a great recipe, although I found the call for green beans odd. I substituted about 5 pablano peppers charred on an open gas flame, cleaned, and sliced, instead of the green beans. I also added a good handful of sliced onion and crushed garlic at the beginning of cooking the vegetables. Made as a vegetable casserole, this pairs well with a turkey mole.

I made this super simple. I used one large can tomatillos, store bought corn tostadas (already crispy) and one can black beans instead of green beans, zucchini and squash. My 16 year old son loved this. Will definitely make this again.

made this recipe last week as we have had an abundant crop of tomatillos. It was delish! As others have I switched the turkey out for chicken that I had on hand. It was perfect. My fiance requested that I make it again this week.

Better the 2nd day. I omitted frying the tortillas; don't think it would add much to the dish except calories. There is too much for a standard 13x9 baking dish. Use a larger pan if you have it. I was not able to use all my veg. and still had trouble sealing the pan. As other reviewers suggested, I used chicken (home made). The tomatillo salsa was great and easy to make.

Really delicious. I used a roasted chicken and jarred tomatillo sauce. I am sure it would have been even better if I had made the sauce, but the jar worked well and the roast chicken was really flavorful and moist. Using the jarred tomatillo also helped make the recipe really easy to make.

Great recipe which will become and standby at our house. I used purchased tomatillo salsa and a rotisserie chicken to save some time. Served it with sliced avocados on the side. Delicious reheated the next day, too!

My whole family really enjoyed this, especially my 2 year old! Now I know how I will use up the rest of the tomatillos from the garden. I also used chicken and acorn squash. I think in the future I will stick to that combination because it worked so super well.

I made this recipe with all the ingredients except substituting chicken for turkey. It was terrific! And what's more every one of my kids loved it also! They would normally complain about squash and zucchini, but ate it all up in this delicious casserole. Worth the time!

We had this with a butternut squash in place of the chayote, Monterrey Jack cheese, and two 16-oz jars of Frontera Tomatillo Salsa. It's a great mix of meat and vegetables, and is well worth the effort.

I feel compelled to review after 3 of the 4 reviews are from 1 person. This is a fabulous, versatile dish which always pleases. It works well without meat and makes a great side for almost any meal.

Being from Austin and already in love with Fonda San Miguel, I trust anything in this cookbook to be phenomenal, and this chilaquiles recipe doesn't disappoint. I usually make the tomatillo sauce a day ahead and buy a rotisserie chicken (or two) if there's no leftover turkey on hand. It's such a hit my friends demand it every Cinco de Mayo. I usually don't remove the seeds from the chiles... we like spice (and it's not too overwhelming, especially with the sour cream/cheese contrast).

My 14 yr. old grandaughter wrote the 1st review. She knows "4 forker" ratings very well & was anxious to be the first to rate this one. She helped me prepare most of the ingredients & put it together, a labor of love. There are a lot of steps! 3 adults & 2 kids ate it & we were disappointed. We averaged our ratings & the best we could do was a 2. Although I followed the recipe exactly, we felt it was lacking something.

We mostly gave it a 2.5. It wasn't our favorite and my grandchildren wouldnt eat the green stuff inside. Not a kid dish.
