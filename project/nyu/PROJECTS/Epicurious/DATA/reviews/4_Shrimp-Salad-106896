This goes together quickly and my husband said the shrimp was perfect. I served this over fresh spinach and romaine.

This was delicious. I expected a typical Asian taste but it somehow tasted more unusual. I served on a bed of arugula with avocado and no peanuts. I also pan sauteed my shrimp in a skillet with sesame oil, ginger and garlic. My husband and two children (5, 3) gobbled it down.

This was fabulous. I made a couple of changes. I used pre cooked shrimp as I had bought them before I found a recipe, so I chopped the ginger and sauted it with the oil and garlic. I used 1/2 the oil, trying to cut down on the fat...didn't miss the other half. I also used 1/2 the fish sauce as I ran out and didn't want to go out for more. I used the whole chile because we like spicy and added some cilantro instead of using it as a garnish. I am going to make this again for a party this weekend!

Amazing recipe, I used 1 lb shrimp and 1/2 lb fresh peconic bay scallops. The taste completely floored the group!

This was a big hit with my family the other night. We like our food spicy so I went ahead and added the whole chili pepper, other than that I made it as written. Delicious!
