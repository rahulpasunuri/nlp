At Thanksgiving, I like to serve things that, if not truly authentic, could theoretically have been eaten by that first gathering. This year's addition was this grape crisp, and though a humble preparation, turned out to be a sensation. The pear tart and maple pumpkin custard I made were great, too, but my husband raved to anyone he exchanged "how was your Thanksgiving" with about this dessert. The pecans (I used small whole, then coarsely chopped) added a bit of crunch that avoided the sogginess that can overtake a crisp. I searched Epicurious for "something different" and this will now become a standard!

Absolutely delicious! I will definitely make this recipe again. I served it hot with vanilla ice cream.

Terrific! A great way to use up grapes that are past their prime or not especially tasty for eating.
