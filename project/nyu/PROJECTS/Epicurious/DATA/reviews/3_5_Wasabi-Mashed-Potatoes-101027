made this many times. Yukon Gold pot work better and I leave on the skin. I used Eden Wasabi powder and found I needed to double the amount to get a kick (but still lacked any real heat- which was ok) Paired with Black Cod with Miso - the kick of wasabi was great with the sweet fish.

This was a great recipe, but I wish I had used russet potatoes instead of organic golden potatoes, which gave the dish a different texture. I followed the advice of an earlier review that advised to make the wasabi paste with cold water and let sit 10 minutes--and I'm glad that I did this.

Tasty and easy.

This was a very nice recipe that complimented the grilled teriyaki salmon I made this evening. I followed the directions as stated. When mixing I thought it needed a bit more milk to make the mixture creamy and fluffy. Not all brands of wasabi paste are equal, so I started out with 1 tbsp of wasabi paste and then added more to my taste. I like the dish to have an nice hint of wasabi, however not overpowering. The recipe was easy, quick and tasty. I will definitely make it again.

The wasabi mashed were perfect as written - a nice subtle wasabi flavor not at all overwhelming.

Rating: 3
A major problem with this recipe is that it does not specify what KIND of wasabi to use. Take the time to read the labels and you will see that sushi grade wasabi contains cornstarch, and other flavorings, whereas natural wasabi powder does not. Cornstarch dilutes the heat and that is why it doesn't have that kick. Another thing is that you should ALWAYS make a paste with cold water before mixing with anything else as this blooms the heat in wasabi. Otherwise you can continue to increase the amount of wasabi, but the flavor never develops. I would recommend that you purchase your wasabi at a Japanese market.

I also wished I read the reviews before making this. I will search for a better Wasabi mashed potato recipe because i've had excellent versions dining out.

I was dissapointed in these. I wish I would have read the reviews first. I couldn't taste the wasabi at all. They also seemed a little dry. I would definitely do as another reviewer suggested and add some sour cream. Double, maybe even triple the amount of wasabi powder. I will not make this again without modifications.

Good but I needed to really increase the amount of wasabi to get any kick out of it.

Everyone loved these mashed potatoes but I did make some modifications. I added about 1/3 c sour cream and doubled the wasabi powder. Still could have used a little more

Rating: 1
Well I cannot say that this recipe is a complete loss but it is close. When cooked by the recipe your potatoes will taste ever so slightly like wasabi and will be dry and bland. I had to double the milk and butter and quadruple the wasabi powder to taste anything. Given that the recipe stands as is, I cannot recommend it at all.

I loved these....I would add double the wasabi powder next time for more of a kick, but overall delicious! I great side for an asian-themed meal.

I love wasabi mashed potatoes, but I have a trick I use to make them tastier/more interesting. Boil 1.5 cups of frozen peas, then put them in a food processor with a little bit of milk, salt/pepper, then add them to the potato mixure. It adds a good green color to the potatoes and a really interesting texture and great flavor. It's a big hit at my house!

Rating: 3
I served these at a dinner party with asian marinated salmon and my guests cleaned their plates. I, too, added an additional teaspoon of wasabi as others suggested. The only change I would make next time is to cut back a little on the milk, as I thought the result was a little too thin. Delicious nonetheless!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. I didn't find the potatoes to be very flavorful.

Rating: 4
Spicy food lovers will love these potatoes if they follow the reviewers' suggestions to up the amount of wasabi powder and to buy a good brand. I used Sushi Chef, boiled one large russett to feed two, and used 1 T. wasabi powder. The potatoes complemented the Pan-Seared Tuna with Shitakes and Ginger, recipe on this site, wonderfully. This will be a definite repeat at our house.

These potatoes were great. I made them per the recipe to acompliment pan fried tilapia w/chili lime butter and for the non-fish guests, grilled ribeye steak. Quick and easy menu. I always select recipes based on reviews and therefore always get my own 3-4 fork ratings from my guests. I no longer buy cookbooks because the latest as well as old standards are always at my fingertips at epicurious.com!

Delicious! An amazingly simple way to make regular mashed potatoes extraordinary. We used wasabi paste instead of powder, and served with miso-marinated salmon. We will most definately make again. 3 +1/2 forks ++

A lovely change from the pilaf & fish combo we often eat; have made this w/ NF milk (not whole) to cut down on fat & there is no discernable difference in texture.

I too doubled the wasabi powder and added a bit more butter. If you like wasabi and mashed potatoes, then you'll like this dish. I thought it was excellent. I served it with Seared Tuna, and it complimented it very well. Very simple too!

Although a nice twist on mundane mashed potatoes, I doubled the wasabi and still found this dish rather bland. I much prefer the Mashed Root Vegetables with Horseradish (from this site) which has far more interesting and complex flavours, with just a hint of sweetness that is nicely offset by the tangy bite of horseradish. Please give that recipe a try - it is far superior to this one.

I added more wasabi after reading the other comments but felt it was too spicy though delicious. It goes well with the fish.

I doubled the wasabi powder and used yukon gold potatoes with skins still on.Delicious. Served with nobu black cod with miso and sauce from soy ginger grilled steak, all from this site.

I have not made this yet, but definitely will soon. I want to see how it compares to the fantastic Wasabi Mashed Potatoes that I enjoyed at Asia Nora in Washington D.C. last night. The Wasabi added just the right amount of interest to something that can be very bland. Even my husband, who is a traditional "meat n' potatoes" kind of guy, loved them. The potatoes were a perfect accompaniment to Pan Seared Day Boat Scallops with Sake-Yuzu Emulsion. I will be looking for a similar recipe for those as well.

Rating: 2
Could barely taste the wasabi (ended up being more of an after taste), and I added more than the tablespoon--they seemed a little dry, to, so I did add some cream. Not sure if I'd make again, but if I did, I'd definitely double up on the wasabi. I made them to accompany the Miso Glazed Sea Bass on this site.

gee, i thought this was a wierd flavor, kind of gross. and i like wasabi! hmm...

Because we had 20 hungry guests waiting, we didn't have the time to boil 3 pounds of potatoes. We ended up microwaving the pieces for 4 minutes and blending them slowly. They still turned out fabulous! We also doubled the wasabi and used lowfat milk. Our guests kept coming back for more! My wonderful cooks were left with only a little, but they took freshly sliced mushrooms and used the mashed potatoes as a dip...and enjoyed it just as much! So tasty, but so easy!

Rating: 3
Great idea for mashed potatoes. We have a milk allergy so I used soy milk and margerine. Also, I used Wasabi Ginger Finishing Sauce (from Bittersweet Herb Farm)instead of the wasabi powder. I did have to add more wasabi sauce, but it was delicious. My seven year old loves them!

Rating: 3
Wasabe added a gourmet or fusion touch to good old mash potatoes. Very impressive for so little work especially if you use a food processor. It was served with cod with miso from the Nobu recipe. Excellent combination! I only used one and a half tablespoonful of the S&B brand of wasabe powder from my local supermarket which gave enough of a kick but did not overpower. 3 or 4 tbsp would be too much for the type of powder I used.

These taste like a lot of work to those that do not cook. Let's keep it that way, shall we?

I made this recipe to accompany the "pan-seared tuna with ginger-shiitake cream sauce" recipe and it went great. Because I had leftover whipping cream from the sauce recipe I used that instead of whole milk and I added a bit more wasabi powder than the recipe called for. Very very good.

Rating: 3
This is an easy was to jazz up mashed potatoes.I used twice as much wasabi as recommended and still could barely taste it. In fact, my husband doesn't like spicy foods and I don't think he even knew it was there! Next time I will start with 3 tablespoons and taste - probably needs 4. I get my wasabi powder at the Asian maket, so I don't think the quality of the wasabi is the problem. Will definitely make again, just with more "punch".

These are fabulous. I served it with the recipe for Chinese Barbecued Pork/Garlic Sauce. The last time I made them I tried using sour cream instead of milk/butter and the results were not as good. Like other reviewers, I made a paste of wasabi powder and water first.

An absolutely wonderful side dish! For a special dinner with friends, I served this along side grilled pork tenderloin, steamed asparagus(drizzled with sesame oil and a sprinkle of sesame seeds), and Ginger-Shitake Cream Sauce(also from this site). What a memorable meal!!! I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding 2 tablespoons of wasabi powder; it gave a mild kick without overpowering the rest of the flavors. Next time, I'll add a bit more. Definitely a keeper recipe, these potatoes would make any dinner special!

I loved the idea of wasabi and potatoes. The first time I made just as the recipe states with Wasabi powder but it was unbearably bitter. I threw it away. The next time I made it with Wasabi paste, now that was delicious! That's how I will make it from now on.

I used yukon gold poatoes with the skins on. They were a very pretty yellow color. I also added a bit of sour cream to the mixture, this gave them moisture. I only had one problem, opening the jar of wasabi powder, some flew out and got in my eye. My advice to you is to be very careful while opening wasabi powder. I had to flush my eye, which did the trick, but gee it burned when i added water at first.

Delicious, and different. The wasabi gave the potatoes a pretty hue, too. I also added more powder; otherwise, I think the flavor would have been too subtle. (Only had 2% milk, but it worked out fine). I riced the potatoes to make them extra smooth. Good with flank steak.

I hereby confess to the following. I whipped up a batch for four people of instant mashed potatoes (Hungry Jack brand) and added wasabi paste to taste (quite a lot of it). Boy, were they good! Once I bought a tube of wasabi paste and it was terrible. Maybe it was the brand, but now I only use the powder with water added.

Needs a little extra Wasabi powder, I could barely taste it with the suggested amount. I used 2-3 more teaspoons.

These were the best mashed potatoes ever! I loved them! I followed the recipe exactly except I followed the other posters' advice and used about 3 tbs of wasabi powder. That amount gave the potatoes a subtle, but noticeable wasabi flavor. Next time I would probably use more. Also, I served these with Seared Tuna with Shiitake-Ginger Cream Sauce. The combo is a winner! I recommend making both together. Delicious! Also, I made these 2 hours ahead of time and when I found I was short a burner, I took a chance and microwaved to reheat. It worked perfectly and you don't run the chance of overworking the potatoes with the extra stirring.

I made this with 2% milk and the taste is still great, just not quite as smooth. I more than triple the amount of wasabi and it becomes a sinus clearer and table pleaser.

I'd make this again if I didn't feel like rice with an asian meal, but I'd definitely add lots more wasabi. I doubled the amount given in the recipe and it was fine, but not as spicy as I probably would prefer. These are pretty much exactly what you expect them to be.

Wonderful! I love wasabi, and was excited to use it in such a classic dish. I doubled the wasabi, used fat free half&half, new red potatoes, and a cup of fat free sour cream instead of butter. They were great, but someday I will make the "all fat" version for a treat.
