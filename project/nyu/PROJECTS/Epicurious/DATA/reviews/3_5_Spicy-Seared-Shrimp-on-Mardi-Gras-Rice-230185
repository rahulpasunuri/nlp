This was okay in my estimation. The shrimp has a nice "kick" to it and is very flavorful. For those with a sensitive mouth, decreasing the spices is advised (maybe half the amount of garlic and cayenne?). The rice is good with the shrimp, but is nothing spectacular on its own (which is probably the intention as the shrimp is spicy enough for both). A nice venture into a new shrimp recipe, but will probably never make again.

At the suggestion of other reviewers, I added onion, but I also added some cajun seasoning I had to the shrimp, and then added some chopped parsley in at the end. It was delicious! Very simple, quick, and easy: perfect for a weeknight dinner.

I also added onions, but i also added a little honey. It gave it a litt sweetness to it without losing the flavor.

extremely yummy. I added onions though and think it made all the difference. Would also go for fresh thyme.
