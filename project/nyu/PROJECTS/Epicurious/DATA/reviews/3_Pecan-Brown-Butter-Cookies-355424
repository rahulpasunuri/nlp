The sophistication of these cookies exceeds the ease of making them. The batter is indeed runny and turn out very thin and very crispy. Thus they are absolutely lovely with tea. I allow them to run together, then they break apart into square-shaped cookies, which fit nicely into gift bags. If you know what to expect, you're sure to be delighted. I think a lot of the disappointment is simply due to mistaken expectations.

These cookies are wonderfully delicate and not too sweet. I will definitely make them again.

These would better be called, nut crisps. If you like thin crisp cookies, then this is the recipe for you. Much of the brown butter flavour didn't come out and they were very sweet. As the recipe uses baking soda and has no acid for it to react with, even freezing the dough in balls before baking them will not rectify the spread. Maybe replacing the soda with baking powder and increasing the flour would result in a cookie a bit thicker.

These cookies were a waste of ingredients. I have made other cookies that use brown butter, so I was looking forward to trying these. The batter was too thin. I spaced the cookies more than the specified 1" apart and they still ran together. The taste was very bland -- they definitely needed something, perhaps more salt and some vanilla or spices. I checked the recipe to make sure I had not left out some key ingredient or perhaps baked them at the wrong temperature, but found I had followed it exactly. I will not be investing the ingredients to make these again. Two cups of excellent Texas pecans are too precious to use for a completely unsatisfying cookie like this.

I made them without pecans, just simple brown butter sugar cookies. They spread out quite thin when cooked, and were absolutely delicious, just the right chewiness with a little crispiness on the edges. And I mean, brown butter and sugar - what's not to like?

Wonderful cookies. The brown butter gives them a rich taste. These cookies were a hit at the office and at home. I will be making them again!

Bleghh!! Terrible!! Awful!!! When I first mixed up the dough, I was very skeptical because it seemed way too runny. However, I figured that the pecans might add some needed body. Also, the previous reviewer had not mentioned any problems. But the first batch turned into curdly-looking bits floating in butter pools. I dumped some flour into the second batch and the texture improved enough that they actually looked like cookies. However, the taste was still rather bland. It seems that the cookies need more salt, or maybe some cinnamon or something. This is absolutely not a recipe that I'll try making again. What a waste.

The brown butter gives it a wonderful rich buttery flavor and the pecans add a nice chewy consistency. I will add it to my favorite cookie recipes.
