Great way to use up your zucchini from the garden. It was not as spicy as I would have expected (used 2 tsp) so will likely up the chile measurement the next time I make it. Using the recipe again and using summer squash.

I have not made this yet, but for the previous reviewer that requests an ingredient that will up the spiciness, you could use Serrano chiles instead of Jalapeno. Serranos look a lot like Jalapeno, except they are a little smaller and a lot more slender. They vary in spiciness, but can be VERY spicy- especially if you leave the seeds in.

Great recipe, but it needs something more spicy. be sure to use LITE coconut milk, and more spices than it calls for. Am searching for something to make it extra spicy. hints? This was great because I had a lot of Zucchs and Summer Squash in my garden and it was a great way to use them

I used Thai green paste because I had it and it came good as always. One of my favourites for courgette uses.

I made this again on Sat but didn't have enough zukes so I added a can of chickpeas and a can of sweetcorn, both rinsed and drained. It was fab.

I found this to be a little one- dimensional, flavor- wise so I added some grated palm sugar and a tablespoon or so of fish sauce, which gave it a bit more depth. I did use light coconut milk, so that might have been part of my issue. I also added cubed eggplant (which I salted and let sit for about 1/2 an hour), and trimmed green beans along with zucchini-- for a total of 3 lbs. of veggies. I might try roasting the veggies first (at least the eggplant & zucchini) to try and boost the flavor some more.

Delicious, savory curry that's easy to modify -- vegetable-wise. I've made this recipe a handful of times. It's easy to overcook the zucchini, so keep your eye on it. I usually cook it separately and add it at the last minute to avoid overcooking. Have also used potatoes to good effect. I garnish with cashews, raisins, cilantro and -- get this -- bananas (my husband's suggestion, sounds weird but is very nice).

I added potatoes and chicken to the recipe and ball parked the amount of spices for the curry, as I would need more. It was very very tasty. I enjoyed making fresh curry paste, it was easy. I am enjoying it all over white Bastami rice. cheers.

I added potatoes so it took much longer to cook but I didn't stir a lot so zukes kept it together. I also forgot to garnish but who cares? I'd make it again but I'm worried about the calorific and fat content of the coconut milk... It's pretty tasty tho if you like coconut.

This is a great recipe! My first curry made from scratch& Although an amateur cook and curry maker I have eaten great curry (the best to date is from a Nepal restaurant in Yotsukaido, Japan.) I made the following changes: doubled all contents of paste  except tripled the garlic and halved the Jalapeños pepper  I also did not include the seeds. I tripled the onions and let the zucchini cook with the onions until it was almost one disintegrated mash (covered  stirring every few minutes for about an hour) and then added the coconut milk (dont forget the last tsp of salt!) brought to a boil and then simmered for an hour. The prolonged cooking times really brought out the different tastes. It was delicious!!!! I will play around with different vegetables. Curry in a can& NEVER AGAIN!!!

This was amazing. The flavors have so much more depth than using jarred curry paste. It was pretty easy to make too. I happened to have an Asian eggplant on hand and I added it to the mix. I think the curry base is quite versatile and I might experiment with other vegetable combinations.

Wouldn't make again as written. Smells great though. Doubled the spices, but the zucchini overwhelmed the sauce. Used "Taste of Thai" coconut milk, which was thick. Next time, I'll add red or yellow peppers, half the zucchini, and some potato. But that's a different dish.

We love curry and this is one of the best curry recipe's I have found. I left out the pepper because the kids do not like food too hot. Otherwise I made it as written and my family loved it!!

While this recipe was very good, be careful not to overcook the squash or - better yet - cook it uncovered. The squash gave off too much water and the result was more like soup than a creamy coating. The dish would have been just as good, perhaps better (less watered down flavor), without adding the coconut milk and instead topping with a dollop of plain yogurt.

Quick & easy and very good. I also threw in some leftover shredded chicken from the previous evening and it was great. Very healthy and tasty.

This is by far the best recipe using zucchini that I have ever encountered!! I followed it almost exactly, with the addition of a diced red pepper for some contrasting color. The spice proportions were perfect. All were more than satisfied. I will be sharing this with friends!

This is good stuff, but I pumped it up spice-wise and withheld some coconut milk water until I was sure what was going on. Used half again or double all the spices and had slightly more than 3 lb of zukes. I wonder if some folks had coconut milk that was very thin? There is a lot of variety on the shelves at stores. I was almost fooled, it looks dry - then all the sudden the zucchinis let loose a lot of liquid. I did end up using the entire can. The flavors were complex and distinct. All curry powders are not created equal so that choice can have a great effect on the results.

I agree - a little too soupy even after reducing for a good while, which runs the risk of disintegrating the zuchs, but tasty nonetheless. I didn't have any ginger on hand so that got omitted and instead of coconut milk i watered down some coconut cream that was extra from the night previous' pina coladas. I also added some shredded chicken for the non-vegetarians. Overall a quick painless dish to make.

This is yet another delicious way to hide the fact that you've fed your family zucchini for three dinners this week! This is very tasty and pretty simple to make. It seemed a little soupy for my tastes--next time I'll reduce the sauce a bit before serving.
