I have made the squares many time because they are so wonderful! I love the lemon hazelnut combo. I typically make more filling (increase by 1/2) and add a bit of flour. Everyone loves them. And the recipe works well in high altitude.

I followed the suggestion to decrease sugar and add more lemon juice. It was still too sweet. I also added a tsp. of cornstarch but didn't like the consistency. Probably wouldn't make it again.

I substituted whole wheat flour and added 1/2 cup cold water to the crust. I also doubled the filling and added 2tbs. more lemon juice. I would have liked the lemon filling to be even more tart, but otherwise they came out great, and were a big hit.

I make these exactly according to the recipe - people love them and someone always asks for the recipe - these add an exciting flavor mix to an assortment of cookies

I have used this recipe repeatedly over the past 15 years and it's always a hit! The hazelnut crust adds an extra dimension to an old standard. These squares may be rich, but they're worth every calorie!

I skipped the hazelnuts in the crust, after my experience with a cheesecake recipe. Crust came out rather hard I thought, but everyone eating it thought it was fine. It did not seem to me that the filling ever completely set, but the flavor was very good and it was worth it to squeeze my own lemon juice.

Reduced sugar to 1/2 cup. Used zest of one lemon and juice of two. Kids didn't care for nuts in the crust, so I'd make it without nuts next time. Froze extra crust mixture in a freezer bag. Used 2-inch foil cups instead of making squares (removing the paper insert). Sprayed bottom of cups with Pam. Be sure to tamp down the crust - I used the bottom of a glass ramekin, dusting with flour each time. Poured filling into cups using a funnel. Made very pretty and portable dessert.

This is exactly what I was looking for. It was wonderful. I used pecans instead of hazelnuts because we prefer pecans. I also doubled the filling and added a little flour. They were great.

Added ground almonds instead of hazelnuts to crust and baked it for 25 min. Increased filling 2.5 times but decreased sugar to 1/2 cup per recipe requirement. Added 1/4 cup flour to filling to thicken it. The entire cake was wonderful but the crust was the best. I will use it for my cheesecake recipes from now on.

I just made this recipe and it's excellent!! I got just the right amount of piquantness after reading the other reviews and then added my own extras to that. I took the advice of one contributor and doubled the filling - excellent idea. So, I used 1/3cup of lemon juice, plus 2 tlbs., and two tlbs. of lemon zest. Be sure to tamp down the crust well before baking. One contributor found the filling texture a bit odd. I think it has something to do with using the processor to mix it. I suggest beating with a wire whisk - not as inclined to become frothy and light. Also, I added 1/3 cup flour to the filling to give it body. Don't look any further - just tweek this to your own taste. BTW, I love this site and I enjoy all you comments. Very helpful. Thank you.

This is the recipe everyone asks me for. Always gets raves. I double the lemon topping - if you don't it's way too thin and not lemony enough. Often leave out the nuts and still everyone loves them. Easy and yummy.

Super easy. Really good. They probably aren't gonna win any contests, but they're still mighty good considering how easy they are to make.

I'm still looking around for the best lemon square recipe. These were very good, but didn't really turn into lemon squares. The crust was great, but the topping was a funny texture - it got very bubbly in the bowl. Tasted great, thoroughly enjoyed them, as did my parents, but never considered them lemon squares.

So easy to make and delicious. I was glad to have reduced the sugar on the filling to only 1/2 cup, otherwise, this would have come out too sweet for my taste. I also ended up doubling the lemon juice cause I prefer it tart. Instead of sifting powdered sugar, I spread some apricot glaze on top giving it a nice rusty gloss and keeping it moist even after being put in the fridge(c/o Francois Payard's lemon tart recipe). Bec of ease in preparation and the same tart-taste gratification, I prefer to make this over lemon tart now.

Delicious and easy to make! I increased the filling by 50%, and the thickness of filling to crust was about half and half. I liked this proportion. The hazelnut crust was fantastic!

Wonderful! I prefer my lemon squares lemon-y and slightly tart, so I doubled the filling and also doubled the quantity of lemon juice. Also added a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken. Got great reviews!

Used pecans instead of hazelnuts. Big hit at dinner party.

Lemon squares are one of our favorite bakery treats, but I never had made them from scratch. These were excellent and easy to make. The hazelnuts were very good, but next time I am going to use almonds. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Wow! I've always adored lemon squares, but it never occured to me that it was possible to make them from scratch, much less so easily and successfully. The only ingredient I didn't have immediately on hand was hazlenuts -- but now I do, and you can bet that I'll be making these again and again.

Be sure to toast the hazelnuts well, and bake the bottom layer adequately...until edges are quite brown. On the first try, I felt the bottom layer was doughy. Next time around it was perfect.

I too added a 1/4 cup of flour to make the lemon part a little less runny and it worked well. Very tasty!!

Maybe I did something wrong? First attempt came out totally flat and was too tart. Second attempt was better, but I assembled using mixer and added 1/4 cup flour to the lemon mixture. Anyway, the final product is delicious and perfectly textured. Definitely will make again.
