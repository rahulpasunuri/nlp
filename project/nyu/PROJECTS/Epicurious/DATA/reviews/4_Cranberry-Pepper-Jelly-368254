I made the recipe almost as written for our Thanksgiving dinner. I didn't add the jalapeno because I thought it would be too hot for some folks. It was great! Everyone loved it! The sweet/tart/slightly hot combination. I will be making this again for social gatherings.

After reading the other reviews that said this was more like a relish then a jelly, I added three more cups of sugar and a 1/2 cup of water to the fresh pepper mixture, cooked that down and 2 more cups of cranberries and 1/2 more teaspoon of red peppper flakes and cooked all until the cranberries popped. Then at a rolling boil I added the liquid pectin (1 pouch), rolling boil for another minute and then placed in steril hot jars. A sublime jam that looks absolutely gorgeous in the jars and has just the right amount of sweetness and heat. Made 8 cups.

The flavor wasn't exactly what I had expected/ desired but it was delicious on a sandwich with leftover turkey & mayo after Thanksgiving. I would maybe use slightly less bell pepper and maybe use 2 jalapenos. (?) I couldn't find liquid pectin anywhere, so I used 1/4 cup water and 1 tsp of gelatin and it worked out okay. I agree that it was more of a relish than a jelly.

Made following the recipe exactly. I thought it'd be a "jelly" but it's more of a "relish" consistency. Nice little "after-burn" from the peppers. Had originally thought about leaving the jalepeno seeds (or some) in, but with the "zing" still lingering on my palate (and I like spicy stuff), I'm thinking that would be a really bad idea. I think this is a nice sweet-hot balance just as is. This is going to be included in our Christmas gift baskets for sure!

Fantastic! A tasty jelly! Perfect for giving a Christmas gifts and there is much less sugar in it than the traditional pepper jelly.

Wow...I don't usually like pepper jelly, but this is phenomenal.
