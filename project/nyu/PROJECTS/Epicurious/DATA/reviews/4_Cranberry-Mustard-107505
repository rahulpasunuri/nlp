This recipe was such a hit that I was requested to leave the mustard at both the dinners I went to. I did not have raspberry vinegar so I used red wine vinegar which may have cut down on the sweetness. Can't wait to try making other flavoured mustards. Be perpared it makes a lot.

With all of the amazing reviews, I was sure I would love this recipe! It was good, but I was not as impressed as I was hoping. It was a bit thicker than I would have liked and I would have preferred if it had some heat, rather than just being sweet. I might try making it again and tweaking it a bit. I do love the pop of the mustard seeds in your mouth, though-definitely don't leave those out!

Very good. Lots of work. My first time making homeade mustard. Looking forward to having it on a sandwich. My husband didn't like it, and thought it tasted too cherry-like.

This recipe is absolutely incredible. At first tasting, I thought it might be too sweet, but when paired with ham...amazing! My husband raved about it - no small feat. It does make a lot, so beware. We will use it on ham sandwiches until the ham runs out and then probably chuck the rest. I will be giving it out as gifts next Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I made this w/ the orange marmalade/horseradish glazed ham. The Cranberry mustard is definately an acquired taste. I probably wouldn't make it again. Those w/ more sophisticated tastes said that it was ok. It makes a ton, I halfed the recipe and it still made more than enough for 8 people, plus more than we will use up for leftovers.

Unusual and fantastic. I've made it now three times and have yet to have any left to go with the leftovers.

I like it very much. My friends ask me to make enough for them whenever I do and it's a hit with ham, turkey and sausages so far. I use it as a spread for left over turkey sandwhiches. It is better the next day and you should make sure to chop the fresh cranberries well to avoid lumps.

Delicious and easy. Used frozen cranberries, as fresh were unavailable. Read recipe through. You need to start a couple days ahead of the big event. Very strong tasting, so a little goes a long way. This recipe makes enough for an army! Almost everybody used it, yet it looked like it was untouched. (Maxed out my large gravy boat.)

I made this as a side to the marmalade-horseradish glazed ham. I substituted rasberry/walnut vinegarette because I could not find the rasberry vinegar. It cleaned out the sinuses but all my dinner guests kept asking for the dish again. It was wonderful

I didn't care for this recipe at all. It tasted like something from Hickory Farms. Maybe cranberry mustard just isn't my thing.

As all the others say, this is wonderful. I served it with ham and prime rib. It was bold and spicy enough to hold it's own against the beef and the cranberries added a nice zing. It has become a tradition at our house!

Be sure to make this recipe. Very tangy but great. Goes well with any ham,but was a nice addition to the marmalade basted ham. I made the recipe 3 days ahead and it mellowed from sitting in the fridge, would suggest you do ahead.

This was wonderful!! I served it with the baked ham with marmalade-horseradish glaze and everyone loved it!! I would make it a day ahead because I thought it was better the second day. I certainly would have it again (and again!!).

Goes very nicely w/ the orange marmalade-horseradish glazed ham. The only thing I would advise is to process the sauce in a blender the day of serving to smooth the texture. (mine had unappetizing looking chunks of cranberry, even after the food processor step. But whirring it in the blender fixed it right up). Guests very much enjoyed the mustard. Note of caution: advise small amounts for first bite as the mustard does have a bite of its own.

This stuff is to die for. Made it for a Christmas buffet ham and people raved about it. Better yet, served the leftover mustard the next night over a log of goat cheese as a spread for crostini. Incredible!

Great recipe! Have finally found recipe that is as good if not better then fine gift shops around the country. This is a keeper and a gift giver. Worth the time and effort.
