This was excellent!

Great! If time consuming, at least the first time. My dill was pretty potent, so I added the dill to the sauce, but not the veggies. Be sure to LIGHTLY butter the gyoza...

I made these as an appetizer for my Valentine's Day dinner and thought they were amazing! I used wonton wrappers for the crisps and cut into heart shapes with a cookie cutter before baking. I prepared the crisps, cooked the lobster and prepared the sauce the night before. I used 4 lobster tails rather than whole lobsters. The sauce took closer to 1.5 hours to completely reduce. When assembling, I sautéed the vegetables and lobster about 20 minutes in advance and kept covered in the warming drawer until ready to serve. Delicious!

For an appetizer for 7 I used 5 (4oz) tails, and puff pastry rounds instead of gyoza. Doubled the sauce and veggies, and it was awesome. Presentation is so pretty!

This is the second Valentines in a row that I have made this delicious and gourmet dish, except this last time I turned it into an entree. I think it was even better that way and it makes it more worth the effort (even though its really not that labor intensive). I made the sauce according to direction and cooked the lobster with the vegetables (good carrots are a must), but I used a puff pastry instead. Just cook it according package and spoon the veggies, lobster and sauce over. Trust me, one of the best lobster dishes ever.

I am planning to make this as a first course for a Valentine's dinner. We'll be 10 people. Any suggestions as far as quantities (lobster, champagne, etc)?? Thank you!

Wow! That is all I can say about this recipe... just made it for my hubby (who is fairly critical) for valentines day appetizer and he said it was time to open a restaurant. I served it with the cranberry champagne cocktail also on this site. Truly unforgettable, this one is a keeper!

We modified this recipe to serve 2 as a main course with won ton ravioli. It is fairly time consuming, but absolutely delicious. The details of our modifications are here - http://jenniferhoel. wordpress.com/2008/0 3/05/vegetable- ravioli-in-lobster- champagne-sauce/.

I have made this for three years as an appetizer at our family Christmas party. It is absolutely delicious. I have trouble finding live lobsters, so I use 2 or 3 tails. Everyone raves, and wolfs them down. Truly a four fork recipe.

Does anyone have any experience scaling this recipe? If I were trying to make it for eight as an appetizer I don't think I should use eight cups of champaigne and reduce it for hour and hours, should I? Thanks for any help.

Fantastic! Even though I had to alter it a bit. Wifey doesn't like fennel or dill so I left it out. Also used the whole bottle of champagne. (A modest Korbel) The creamy rich sauce is still incredible and the perfect cover for lobster tail.

WOW!!! I made this for Valentine's Day. Cooked the lobster and sauce and cut out heart-shaped crisps 1 day ahead. It's a lot of work but definitely worth it for special occasions! YUM!

This was really rich and fabulous. The lobster broth was heavenly even before adding the cream. I used green onions instead of leeks and wonton wrappers for the crisps but otherwise stuck to the recipe for my Valentine's Day menu. It is an indulgent dish that everyone deserves to enjoy at least once.

Very nice flavor! Love the veggies. My sauce was very thin...anyone have tips for thickening?

I made this dish along with the Caviar Tart last night as appetizers for my bi-monthly dinner group. The Caviar Tart won out and was much less work. While this recipe was very good and well received, I didn't feel it was worth all the work that goes into it. It is also a tough dish to take to someone else's home as you have to put it together just before you serve it. I did use the phyllo cups as some others did which made it a little easier, but had to saute the vegetables and finish off the sauce at our host's home.

"Ditto" to the other reviewers' comments! Wonderful, subtle flavor and creamy texture. I added the tamale (light green interior) of the lobster along with the juice, and used Filo cups, filling them at the last moment so they didn't get soggy. This recipe received raves.

Incredible! A restaurant quality, elegant meal. This is my husband and mine anniversary dinner. I prepared it exactly as written, using tails though instead of whole lobster.

I made this as an appetizer for 20 people on Christmas and it was a huge hit! I made the "crisps" but they were not a hit, but I also had some puff pastry so we substituted the puff pastry for the crisps. The advance prep. made this an easy, "wow" dish for the holiday!

Absolutely incredible. Made it just as suggested. Hopefully you'll have something more moderately priced around the house than the $35 bottle of champagne I used, though. And do prep the veggies the day before to prevent yourself from cringing when people wolf them down at an alarming rate!

This is the best appetizer I have ever made. I save it for special occasions and special friends who really appreciate awesome food! I'm helping my son make it for his new bride for her birthday dinner tonight!

Another "WOW"! Made this last night for our anniversary dinner. Used a heart-shaped cutter for the "crisps". Unbelieveably delicious! The veggie saute is also delicious on its own so I'll likely make it as a side dish for other meals.

What a great start for an elegant meal! A lot of time, but worth it! We prepared and served this for FOABS, a small vacation group very critical of appeal, presentation, aroma, and of course, flavorfullness. This one passed with flying colors and many cheers.

Amazing recipe both in taste and presentation! To save time & hassle, I bought steamed lobster from the grocery store and used the shells. The sauce still had a strong lobster taste. I also had to use phyllo sheets which worked great folded into triangles!

I brought this to a New Year's Eve party and it was the first thing finished and highly complemented. I added 1 tablespoon of fresh tarragon to the sauce and let it steep for 10 minutes - Next time I will cut down on the time or the amount since it was a little too strong. I would also thicken up the sauce a touch with some flour but it really did come out great as is.

We made this appetizer in 02/99 and have served it every New Year's Eve. All of our guests beg for the recipe! Although rich, it is to die for!

I made this for my boyfriend on valentines day back in 1999. He still talks about it to this day. He tells all his friends what a wonderful cook I am just because of this recipe. I am going to drop the crisps and try the sauce to use over a filet mignon -- for surf and turf.

I made this for my birthday with the wonton wrappers and thought it to be fabulous. I can't wait to make it again!!!

This is truly a fabulous dish and is a MUST TRY!! I did make some substitutions. I used wonton wrappers, as they were easy to find in my local grocery store and worked beautifully. I also used canned, frozen lobster, so did not have the shells to use for the broth. I purchased a handful of prawns for $5.00 and cooked them in place of the lobster shells. Absolutely delicious! If I had royalty coming for dinner..I would know what to make.

This was a *terrific* dish! The sauce is incredible. After making the recipe as written, I dropped the "crisps," and used the carrot/fennel/lobster/dill as filling for ravioli (using the wonton wrappers), and used the sauce over them. Delicious! I would make it again as an appetizer, or as an entree (ravioli). Save your lobster shells in the freezer and make stock *just* to pull out for this sauce!

My husband claims this is the best appetizer he has ever had. Very good. The gyoza wrappers are perfect to use for other appetizers where you need a base.

We prepared this dish as a special entree in our restaurant. The only thing we changed was a substitution for the won ton crisps. We had flour tortillas available, cut them in wedges, brushed them lightly with oil and baked them until very crisp. Very good. This dish sold out!

This was incredibly delicious, but don't try to make it all in one day, or you'll be too tired to enjoy it. Also, don't spoon sauce and lobster over crisps or they'll get soggy pretty quickly- we found it better to place crisps around dish.

this was the hit of a dinner party, made most of it ahead so that it was quick to prepare.

Delicious! My husband thought he'd died & gone to heaven. We made it without the dill and with frozen tails instead of live lobster. Still great!
