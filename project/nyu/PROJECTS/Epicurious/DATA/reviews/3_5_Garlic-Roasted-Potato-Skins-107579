I love potatoes and garlic, and I made this exactly as written but it was really about as interesting as white bread. I made it for company too, and it looked sad and unloved in the corner. Guest munched politely. Depressing.

I made these for a football party and they were a huge hit. I doubled the recipe and they were all eaten. As advised, I did everything up to the final step the night before, and they turned out perfectly.

These were so good! Nice and cripsy and loaded with garlic. I shredded some parmesan over the top when they came out of the oven. Would definitely make again.

These always go up in a snap. I liked the original dip, but not as much as dipping these into sour cream & chives, or better yet: the gorgonzola dip from this website --Mmmm heaven. I'm making them for the 5th time this Friday. Perfect for having a few people over.

I made these for a party and couldn't find the Knorr's spinach dip and didn't have time to make the one with the recipe. I bought premade ranch dip and everyone loved them. Big hit. They were really easy too. Definitely going to serve them again.

Seemed like a lot of cooking time spent on a recipe with little flavor...then again, it wasn't bad, just a bit bland. It might be good to add more garlic.

Rating: 2
Good not great. I doubled the garlic and butter as previouly suggested,left a little more potato on the skin and served them with sour cream. Our guests liked them but didn't love them. I will probably make them again with more of the roasted garlic since I love potatos and garlic...might try the bacon as has been suggested. My husband liked them with the chipotle Tabasco sauce! He wants me to sprinkle cayanne pepper on them next time.

i doubled the butter and garlic and used the knorr spinach dip. skins were good, not exceptional. if i were to make again, i would rub the whole potatoes with a bit of butter or oil before baking to prevent the skins from becoming so dried out during the baking process.

Very controversial and very, very good! You must roast two heads of garlic, while at it, for roasted garlic mashed potatoes later. I lightened the recipe with light sour cream and light cream cheese. Also used frozen spinach. YUMMY! Got the onions slightly overly browned and guess what, the spinach dip had a nice toasted flavor.

Easy and delish! I will use this one for more parties and as a tv snack. I served it with sour cream and chives.

Incredibly delicious!!! An amazingly simple but very tasty appy! I doubled the garlic but kept the amount of butter the same :). Yum! I also had dip available but no one even sampled it! If you feel you must have something to dip the skins in, sour cream would be great. This is the type of dish that you should anticipate making again and again.

Rating: 4
These were so great - real crowd pleasers. I made the Knorr dip (as recommended by reviewers, as opposed to the dip that comes with the recipe), and hardly anyone ate the skins with the dip. The are so good -- buttery and crisp, that they really stand alone. Delicious.

So good! Great weekend snack to eat in front of the TV. Made a half recipe and although I coulda eaten a full recipe, it was perfect for two. Will go into heavy rotation for parties :)

These are great! They went over very well at recent party, especially with the garlic lovers. I doubled the garlic and the butter the second time I made them and that made a big difference. Used Knorr Spinach dip and that was a hit as well.

Good as a starting off point. As I am on Weight Watchers and watching calories, I didn't use any butter, but instead just spread the roasted garlic on the potatoes. As suggested, just used Knorr spinach dip instead of the onion-spinach dip recipe. Makes a good side dish.

Rating: 3
Left more potato on skins. Doubled butter, doubled garlic and poured it over rather than spread as a paste. Delicious as a first course, 4 per person + dollop (an anglo-saxon word) of sauce. Saved on dishwasher time and soap tablets as plates licked clean.

Delish! We devoured these skins within minutes. I will make these on another occasion for my potato lovin' friends. Don't know why you need the spinach dip though- these are great without anything additional besides a little sour cream. Bon appetit!

Rating: 4
If you want to turn this into part of a meal, double the garlic (to intensify the flavor), mash the potato that is scooped out (w/ salt, pepper and milk), and after spreading the garlic/butter mixture on the skins, fill them back up like a 'traditional' twice-baked potato. The garlic is wonderful and then no more leftover potato to deal with.

I also made these for the Superbowl. People liteally inhaled them, a huge platter was empty in just a few minutes. They are delicious and the roasted garlic browns beautifully. I made the spinach dip and brought the skins out with the dip & crudites, I agree you don't need the dip but it is a nice accompaniment for those who want a richer dish. A total 4 fork make again.

Awesome skins! And I agree with Susan from Sonoma: they don't need any dip. These can stand on their own. I initially tried them with the suggested Onion and Spinach Dip but found it way too rich (together, that is.) The Skins are fine on their own. The dip, however, is also pretty tasty but is best, imho, with some fresh raw and/or blanched veggies to 'cut through' the creamy/cheesy texture and provide a better contrast than the skins. But don't get me wrong. These skins are the bomb!

Rating: 4
Wonderful!! I made them the night before my party as stated and also baked a couple that night so I could try them before serving them to guests. I decided that adding bacon would make them even that much better and they were a HIT!! I did a little more garlic paste than it asked for, but didn't regret it!! :)

Sooooooooo good! Doesn't need dip! Can stand on it's own just fine!

To Cook on 1/23: A dry cup and a liquid cup are the same. I think that is the mostly widely held but wrong kitchen myth. The only reason they make dry measuring cups and liquid measuring cups is because the ingredients are easier to measure in their respective cups. (E.g. if you're measuring flour, you can even off the top in a dry cup but not a liquid cup.) But the volume is the same--as long as your cups are well-made.

Rating: 0
weight and volume are 2 different things. in the us, the term ounce is used to label weight, (lbs and ounces) as well as liquid volume (16 ounces in a pint). a cup is always volume, but can be either dry or liquid, and they aren't equal. kinda confusing, which is why so many countries use metric. ;-) here's a good link for metric conversion. http://www.recipegoldmine.com/kitchart/kitchart2.html

To: Cook on 1/22: you don't need to be such an arrogant snot. In the length of your pointless attack and subsequent preening you could have provided the conversions yourself. How many chat rooms have evicted you? Try less surfing and baking, and more socialization with human beings. To: Charlottesville: grams are measures of weight; cups and tablespoons are measures of volume. Grams cannot be converted directly to cups, but they can be converted to ounces. Here is one link: http://www.auntrunnersrecipes.com/conver.html 1 oz = 28.3 grams 1 g = 0.0353 ounces 250g = 8.8oz; 200g = 7oz; 50g = 1.75oz

These were delicious just as is. I served them as a side dish with fried chicken cutlets and the apple, dried cherry, and walnut salad with maple dressing on this site. We didn't even miss the dip.

Fresh garlic is best, but if you don't have any or prefer not to get your hands all smelly, try using Outrageously Garlic from Two Sisters Gourmet (www.twosistersgourmet.com). It's also good to use for the garlic mashed potatoes. If you order on line, make sure you use consultant ID #0002. Enjoy!

i've made "yemas de coco" with the leftover insides. they're dessert/tea sweets made with potato, coconut, egg yolk and sugar. here's the recipe if anyone is interested. 250g potato insides, mashed with a fork, add 200g sugar and 200g shredded coconut, when mixed together add 2 egg yolks and combine well. roll into yolk-sized balls and then roll in 50g sugar and 50g coconut to coat. enjoy.

These skins were so good, I wish I would have doubled the recipe. Made them exactly as the recipe described and would not change a thing. I served them at a party, and not only were they the first dish gone, but were gone in about 10 minutes! Easy to make and a real crowd pleaser! No wonder they knocked the salted boiling water business out, it's about time!

This was quite good and made my kitchen smell wonderful. I just made them for my husband and me, so we dipped them in sour cream. A bit messy but tasty. As for the garlic debate, I must note that all versions are fine for some things, but my least favorite is the minced in a jar -- too bitter.

All the good reviews prompted me to make this tonight. It was fine, but not a great dish. It was easy to make, and my company enjoyed it. The roasted garlic flavor was very nice. The best part was the delicious smell of the garlic roasting. I'd consider making this again, perhaps as an appetizer or alternative to fries with some kind of sandwich.

Nice simple recipe. Roasting the garlic adds a lot. And as for "Spuds from Idaho", is the federal investigation making you cranky, Martha?

These are delicious! Made as is, the fresh garlic is easy to prepare and so rewarding in aroma and taste. If you must use dried, try garlic powder instead of garlic salt - no sodium! Another suggestion for the leftover potato innards would be Bubble & Squeak, fry it up with onion and add leftover veggies (must have brussel sprouts or cabbage, plus whatever else you have on hand - carrots, peas, corn, bell peppers, etc). Fry and stir until browned and crisped in places. Serve for breakfast with or without eggs and baked beans. Serve with worcestershire sauce or tabasco, pepper and salt to taste, for flavour.

I have had a subscription to Bon Appetit and Gourmet for years, but am relatively new to this website.

Yummy, easy, everyone love it and both potatoe skins and garlic are so good for you. By all means use real garlic, way too much salt in that powdered garlic plus the kitchen just doesn't smell as good.Baked potatoes make good mashed spuds, have them the night before or whip up a Shepards or fish pie, potatoe panckaes ... use your imagination for goodness sake.

The potato skins were great; the garlic was a nice addition. As for the reviewers who criticize others for their chosen cooking techniques, I wonder if they realize that they come across as obnoxious and small-minded?

What a waste of time for people to be so negative in a forum that attempts to bring people together through the simple pleasure of enjoying food.

Simply good. Variations on what to stuff/serve these with seem endless, and for a potato lover like me, the concern of what to do with the scooped out flesh of the potato is simple... eat it! :-)

I'm surpirsed no-one has mentioned it yet, but for all that extra potato you have left over after the scooping, I suggest heating (med-high)two to three tablespoons of corn oil in a very large skillet, adding a little butter, and then sauteeing/spatula-chopping the potato pieces for the absolute best home fries you will ever taste. I sometimes add chili flakes, a little cinnamon, and chopped cilantro sprinkled over them at the end (as an accompiniment to all things mexican). A huge hit with my wife and son :)

I saw the "skins" recipe just after finishing dinner that included my side dish of left-over baked potatoes from yesterday. Since somebody asked what to do with the extra potato "innards", here's what I did. I chopped up an onion and sauteed it in 1/2 stick of butter, then added about a cup of sliced mushrooms, salt and pepper, letting the mushrooms cook and brown somewhat. Wild mushrooms would be nice. I then crumbled the cold leftover potatoes in a bowl (about 3 cups), adding the onions and mushrooms, mixing well, and turned them out into a baking dish. Dotted with more butter and baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Delicious, according to my husband.

Made this recipe exactly as is. Was great. To the "TriBecA" cook; Your garlic "product" sounds innovative [and funny!!]. Perhaps you could tell us about dry parsley flakes. You know, the ones people use when they find snipping real parlsey a chore. Couldn't resist. It's all in fun. Sounds like material Jerry Seinfeld would use for his act--and we would all laugh.

Fresh garlic does make a difference, but so what if you have to improvise with something else? Any decent cook knows that sometimes you have to make do with what is on hand. And if you know what you are doing, if usually turns out OK. I appreciate the constructive comments from other cooks,who have done so and want to share.

Really, really delicious and super-simple!! I would encourage anyone who wants to try this out to definitely roast garlic instead of using substitutes, as the difference is incredible. One suggestion: drizzle a little bit of extra-virgin olive oil on the garlic before closing up the aluminum foil. As for all the obnoxious pedants: life is too short for negative energy

Not a review, simply an affirmation of the comments by the cook from Fountain Hills AZ. There are so many websites, set up for constructive comments, that become forums for obnoxious know-it-alls with an axe to grind. If you need to critique and vent about the comments of others, go to the forum, a happy haunt for high-minded jerks. Leave the reviews department to those of us who enjoy providing constructive comments. Anything with roasted garlic is superb - including these potato skins.
