Look, these are lovely beans and all, but BOSTON baked beans do not ever ever have tomatoes in them....!

This is hearty, nutritious and easy to make. Very popular at a ladies' luncheon.

My family is used to a more Spanish-style bean, so they didn't like it at all. It was too sweet for my taste. I know baked beans are sweet, but there was something missing, or maybe I'd just decrease the molasses. I added the dijon with the other ingredients. Maybe pancetta would give it a more smokey flavor. Perhaps that is what was lacking.

I made this for a BBQ, with raves about it. It has a lot of flavor, not to goo of canned baked beans. I added 2 slices more bacon and left all the fat in the pan. It tastes like you spent hours making it! I didn't bother with the crumb topping because I served corn bread as well.

Good dish and easy to prepare. I'm going to quit using the red pepper flakes--too easy to overdo.

East, fast, and very good. Will definitely make this dish again.

Excellent quick baked bean dish. When preparing I substituted sorghum for the molasses with excellent results. It was served at a company party with many requests for copies of the recipe.
