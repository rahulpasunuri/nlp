I added an equal amount of papaya pieces to this and a little bit of ground chile arbole to make it more beautiful.

This was pretty good, but I kept thinking it needed something else. I think I will try again w/ either Mango, red onion, and possibly fresh chili peppers...

Just like Mexico. Simple and resfreshing and light. Yum. Added mango, too.

eh. somehow this didn't thrill me the way it has thrilled the previous posters. Not bad, just nothing special.

I always buy this from street vendors when I am downtown in LA and am so happy to be able to serve it to my guests now. I also add mango slices, like the vendors do...a BRILLIANT combination of flavors.

Great recipe! Guests raved about it. I would just use Jicama the next time. I also added a little bit of rice vinegar to give it a little zing.

I only used jicama for this recipe and the results were fantastic! I wish my mom knew this trick when she used to put jicama in my school lunches. It's yummy.
