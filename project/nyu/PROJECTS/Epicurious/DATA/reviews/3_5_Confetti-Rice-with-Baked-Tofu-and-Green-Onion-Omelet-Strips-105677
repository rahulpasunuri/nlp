Yum, I love the flavors in this dish. It's more or less a fried rice variation, but with a lot less "fry". Per prior reviews, I doubled the egg mixture (well, 3 small eggs with double the other stuff), and I'm glad I did. The steaming technique for the veggies was great: they kept great color, flavor, and were perfectly done. As others have said, you could use almost any veggie combo you like. You could also make this with beef instead of tofu if you have die-hard meat eaters. Oh, and I just made the rice about 15 minutes before cooking everything else and it came out fine.

A quick and tasty recipe. As mentioned by others, I would increase the egg next time. I might also increase the garlic and ginger. It was also a bit too salty for me (which is quite unusual).

One of my husband's favorites! A quick and complete vegetarian meal.

Delicious, definitely will make again. I did use two eggs instead of one. Also used asparagus instead of broccolini (didn't have broccolini and don't care for it anyway). Family loved it -- it's a comfort food type of dish.

Good comfort food. Easy to make and flexible enough to accomodate any leftover vegtables you have in the refrigerator. I would double the eggs, one just doesn't seem to be enough.

I made this for my husband on Valentine's Day. He cooks the other 364 days of the year. It was very good and very simple. I would use a little less ginger and would double the broccolini (it really cooks down). I might even add some bok choy. The egg strips were completely overwhelmed by the rest of the dish, but definately very good and I would make again!
