I impulse bought a five pound bag of blueberries at the farmer's market, even though I'm not a huge fan, and have been making every blueberry recipe that looks interesting. These were pretty tasty, though I made it with vanilla yogurt, so they didn't have as strong a blueberry flavour as you might expect. The hardest part, by far, was finding popsicle molds for sale! I found push-pop molds at Bed Bath and Beyond. If you're concerned about the skins, just strain the mixture before putting it in the molds.

As far as popsicles go, these are outstanding. We'll be making these again soon!! A little sweet, made as written, yet oh so delicious...and it feels good to be eating blueberries that are so good for us.

My kids ate these, but we all agreed they were too sweet. Honey doesn't seem to be great in pops. We won't make them again...but loved the lemon-buttermilk pops on the same page.

I agree with the first 2 comments. They were very ordinary. Disapointing waste of blueberries. Plus you have blueberry skins all over your teeth when you're finished... Not something you want to serve at a party! I'll stick with the lemon-buttermilk ones.

My preschooler liked these, but I didn't care for them. They tasted too much like honey. (You could probably just skip it.) One thing I did like was the consistency. They came out very thick -- more like a creamsicle than a popsicle.

Great to eat & cool down on a HOT summer day!

I have to agree with Lorrie. They were ok, but not worth repeating.

I have no idea why I wasn't thrilled with these-- I usually like blueberry anything. The honey and yogurt taste somewhat muted the fresh fruit flavor I was expecting. They did look pretty, but I probably wouldn't make them again.
