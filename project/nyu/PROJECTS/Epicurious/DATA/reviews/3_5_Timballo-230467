It's so good. This was a great hit with the family. I will definitely make this again.

I followed the other reviewers suggestions and doubled the sausage and doubled the mozzarella. I should have also doubled the amount of tomatoes. But it was quite good. I also cooked it for much less time (1/2). I think it would have been dried out if I had cooked it the entire time.

just made and ate this. presentation is terrific! things i would change: 1. mozzarella cheese shredded or cut smaller 2. substitute garlic for the carrots add red pepper flakes 3. add herbs to meat sauce; thyme, oregano,sage could use hot sausage instead of sweet or half and half

This recipe has a lengthy prep time, but the reward is well worth it! I would choose this any day over similar italian recipes--lasagna, manicotti, etc. I even use the red sauce as spaghetti sauce for a quick fix. The presentation gets tons of oohs and ahhs.

I'm giving it 2 forks because it was good, not really delicious or exceptional. I made the meat sauce, diced my cheese, and cooked the chard the night before, so it came together pretty quickly. I had no problems using a souffle dish, but I kind of wish mine was a little bigger. Mine did start to fall apart as I served it. That is probably my fault for only waiting 10 minutes before flipping it out of the dish. I just think there are better baked pastas that are not as much work.

This is a great recipe for a dinner party. I prefer to make dishes that can be left unattended in the oven once guests start to arrive and this one worked well. I would suggest adding more cheese as it did come apart somewhat when cut. Also, I arranged the ziti vertically around the outside which made for very nice presentation, but the pasta did dry a bit so more chese or sauce would help that as well.

Worth the effort! I used spicy sausage as suggested and I recommend looking for Swiss Chard if possible it does taste different (spinach is good in a pinch). I was worried about flipping soufflé dish and the water bath- it work flawlessly, but will try doubling in a springform (as suggested) third time around.

Yes, it took a while, but it wasn't so difficult to make me flustered! It was nice to finally assemble it, after making the individual parts. I used fresh spinach as well, chopping roughly and adding to the béchamel just before the parmaesan, after I took it off the heat, letting warm sauce gently wilt the leaves. I made it with 12 oz penne, and I would suggest cooking a bit more, even a full pound. I was a bit short but it worked out -- I think I was a bit short on the cheese too -- a little more would have made a better 'binder' for the dish, helping to hold it together once you take it out. Used a springform, as well.

You will need at least 1.75 hours to prepare this and a well-equipped kitchen - but it looks impressive and tastes fantastic. My family enjoys it so much that I double the ingredients and make it a 9-inch springform pan. I too substituted spinach for the Swiss Chard.

Recipe method was fussy but tasted good and mine looked just like the photograph in the magazine. I substituted chopped spinach for the Swiss chard and it was still delicious.

Why do people insist on making recipes harder than necessary? Why not use a springform pan for this???

I made this as written except that the sausage was spicy. It was very good, although for a weeknight dinner took longer to prepare than I would like. Next time I will increase the bechamel/chard portion - that was great on its own, and we would like a larger layer of it!
