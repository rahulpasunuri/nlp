This was a nice marinade for the left over red pepper and mushrooms I had in my fridge. I thought they were tasty even after 48 hours.

This is the second time I made this. I doubled the marinade and marinated the veggies 2 days and thought they were a little bitter as mentioned by another reviewer. Next time I will try 1 day. I think roasted red peppers would be better than the raw. Also, I added sliced eggplant which was good.

Excellent! Found that the recipe made plenty of marinade. With an italian bread and a bit of provolone, salami, prosciutto and melon this made for a substantial meal.

Wonderful colors! I made this twice for two different groups. The first goup liked it so much more than the second--the flavor is nice, the texture is great. It makes a lot, it's easy...what more could one ask for?

This was very good for a party or potluck. Marinated it for 24 hours, and did not use the small onion. I did 1&1/2 times the marinade however, as there did not seem to be enough.

A perfect hassle free dish that can serve many people. I took some advice from the other commentaries and added mixed olives and fresh mushrooms. I also added hearts of palm and feta cheese. The guests truly loved this dish.

Very good! The marinade is delicious. I made it a day ahead and liked it better the day I made it - I thought it took on a hint of a bitter taste the following day. For now on, I would make it the day of and not refrigerate it.

I have made this recipe several times,for different occasions, and have received great responses. Doubling the amount of dressing works the best for me.

This mix is truly delicious. I substitute the frozen artichoke hearts with the small jars of Italian artichokes for a more Italian antipasto salad. I use the Holland peppers, all colors. The mushrooms are fresh, not canned. My family loves this, and now they expect me to bring this for every holiday! I've doubled and tripled this recipe and it's consistently excellent.

Great for parties, I add additional types of olives, nicoise, oil cured ect. Also great with chunks of feta cheese.

I don't really like stuff like this, but it was a good addition to an open house that I had, with appetizers to serve 80 people.

This was a pretty good recipe- I'm not a big fan of marinated vegetbales so thats why I would not make it again but the people I served it to loved it and one asked me for the recipe.

I made this as part of a buffet, and it was a smash! To add more substance to the dish, I tossed the veggies with some cooked cheese-filled tortellini. Makes a great pasta salad! The veggies are great marinated a day ahead, but don't toss in the pasta until 4 hours ahead or so.

Delicious. I used 8 ozs. of mushrooms and reduced the olives to a 1/4 cup, and also added cubed feta which I think was a great addition. A good dish to make at least one day in advance to allow the marinating to take place. I let it sit at room temperature for about 6 hours prior to serving.

I make this dish often but I add two quartered tomatoes.

This recipe was great. I took it to two parties and it was a hit both times. I substituted half of the red wine vinegar for balsamic.

Simply great. This recipe received RAVE reviews from my guests.

I made this mushroom recipe to take to an outdoor Thanksgiving feast for forty. The recipe recieved raves. It is so simple to make, but very tasty. I substituted more mushrooms for the olives, so it was only mushrooms and artichokes. The marinade is particularly flavorful. Would definately make this again!!!

I am very stingy with my fork ratings, but this one is a 4. I took other reviewer's advice and let it marinate for 3 days. While it's marinating, don't forget to mix it up occasionally. The frozen artichokes are a must. I doubled the recipe b/c it went farther - also, next time, I might use slightly less olive oil.

Great marinade and combination of vegetables. I substituted hearts of palm for the artichokes because I was also serving Artichoke Bruschetta. Makes a nice appetizer. I took another reviewers advice and marinated the vegies for 2 1/2 days.

Better when longer marinated (longer than two days). And then, absolutely delicious!! C'est très bon!.

Ooo la la. but you can cut down on the olive oil and eliminate the artichoke hearts and it's still good.
