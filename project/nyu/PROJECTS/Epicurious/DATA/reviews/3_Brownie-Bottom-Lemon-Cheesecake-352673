I am the official baker for birthdays at my office. When I made this cheesecake, I had non-dessert eaters taking second helpings. Rave reviews! Everyone loved it. I don't always add the final layer and it still tastes delicious.

I had high hopes for this recipe as I love the flavor of lemon and chocolate together, but what a disappointment. The lemon was very weak in the cheesecake. Also, I used an 11" pan and the filling was an inch out of the pan when I removed it from the oven. It would have been way to much filling for a 9-inch pan. Also, be careful not to overbake the brownie crust, it can get too hard to cut very quickly.

Excellent taste, especially the next day. However, there is too much filling -- make only 3/4 or 1/2 of the recipe.

I must have done something wrong....but the cooking time wasn't sufficient for the cheesecake and although the brownie crust looked great when I took it out of the oven, when the cake was done it became super thin and impossible to scrape off the parchment paper (as other cookes advised). It was a mess - but it tasted good. Wouldn't make it again.

Tastes great, however, brownie crust needs to bake much less. Bake it 20 min, and it turns out like a brick when the whole cheesecake is done. Also, I cooked it for not quite an hour, and that was more than enough time. And, I would use a 10" pan. Good ingredients- time needs adjusting.

I made this cheesecake last night and had a piece today. Flavorwise, the brownie bottom tasted great, the sour cream topping went along great, even though I was skeptical, but the filling didn't have as strong of a lemon flavor as I was hoping. Things I would change are: Add more lemon. I increased the lemon peel and juice when I made it and it still didn't have as strong of a flavor as I was hoping. Line the pan with parchment paper, mine stuck. Use more sour cream for the topping, and make sure it covers it all (the top of my cheesecake burned slightly). But overall, presentation and flavpr was good.

Excellent!! My family & friends loved it. The texture is light & fluffy -- not dense. Thanks to all the wonderful reviewers on this site! I made the suggested modifications and made some of my own. Used choc crust recipe for Cappuccino-Fudge cheesecake on Epicurious. Increased lemon zest to 1 1/2 - 2 TBSP. Increased the sour cream for the topping to 1 1/2 Cups. I made a 9inch cheesecake and had leftover crumbs and batter to make 12 individual cupcake sized cheesecakes. Definitely a keeper and will make again!!

After reading the other reviews I made some adjustments. I used boxed brownie to save time, using only half for the crust and cooking the other half for the kids. I also used parchment paper which worked well. I took it out of the frig before serving so cutting it was not a problem. It was a big hit and easy to make

I made this for Easter dinner as well and I agree with a previous review and will use parchment paper under the crust. It didn't cut with the rest of the cake, but it was delicious when we ate it on its own after serving the cake. I too would add a bit more lemon juice or zest and more sour cream on top. Overall a good recipe!

Also made this for Easter Dinner. The cake rose so high it browned on top.Amount of sour cream has to be increased. I was going to cut the top but found decorating with lemon all around the cake and chocolate in the middle was sufficient - great looking. I had checked the batter and found it a bit bland so increased lemon juice. The brownie bottom was a disaster when cutting at the table. Everything tasted great but the presentation was ruined. I'd substitute another bottom - maybe ginger snaps or chocolate cookie crumbs.

I made this for Easter dessert and everyone raved about it. Make sure you use a pan with 3-inch sides. I filled it up to 1/4 inch from the top and still had about a cup of batter left over. I would also use a little more than 1 cup of sour cream next time for the topping; it thinned out a little too much.

Made this for Easter Dinner with the in-laws, and everyone loved it. This makes a lot of cheesecake - my 2-1/2" pan was full to the top and I still had filling left over (3 cups!). I think going forward I would make the bottom twice and make 2 cheesecakes - or reduce the filling by @ 1/3. The cheesecake was delicious - light, lemony, and flavorful. But the brownie crust was very compressed by the large amount of filling, and difficult to cut, so I would put parchment on the bottom and line the pan next time. The brownie bottom was delicious & rich once you got it on the fork! I will make this again with modifications noted.

Ok, so it's still in the oven, and I didn't have a 9" spring form pan so I used the 10", thinking it would just be thin...it is billowing above the sides, but very pretty...light brown and almost done..stay tuned...
