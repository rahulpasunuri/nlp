This recipe was a great way to use overripe cherries. I loved the Goat Cheese Cream. I make a goat cheese ice cream that is to die for but it requires advanced prep, so this recipe was a great last minute alternative.

My guests and I all liked these. I loved the combo of sweet and tart cherries, and have access to both since I live in northern Michigan. The goat cheese cream was awesome, the goat cheese is very subtle and the vanilla bean adds a lot. I think these would be good without the pastry but I am not a big turnover fan.

My husband and I thought this recipe was just OK, but my co-workers raved about it. I made only the turnover portion of this recipe, not the goat cheese cream. I used rainier cherries, which were sweet when eaten raw but after cooking turned very tart. The turnover was too tart for my taste (the goat cheese may have balanced that, had I made it) but others loved it, so not sure what to make of that. Will try with regular red cherries next time.

I made these several times last summer. I am in so cal so fresh sour cherries are nor easy to come by so I just use all sweet. what I like about this recipe is that it is not too sweet. Don't skip the goat cheese whip cream. It really plays well with the cherry. My only warning if you make ahead is to keep the out, the get soft real fast, which kills the texture of the puff pastry. (Or I am doing something wrong) But I recommend making ahead and baking before serving if need be. I have yet to have anyone not love these. They are a big hit every time!
