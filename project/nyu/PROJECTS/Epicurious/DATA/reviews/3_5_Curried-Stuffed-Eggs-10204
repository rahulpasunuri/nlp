I made two dozen of these for a Yuletide reception at church, & they evaporated quickly, raves especially from vegetarians. I used my own chutney - ginger/Asian pears (homegrown) & garnished them with a small chunk from the chutney.

I followed the recipe and took the curried eggs to a ladies luncheon and didn't get one compliment, and two ladies said they were too spicy. I only added two teeny drops of tabasco so I think they just didn't like curry. What a group of hard to please ladies! Well, for what it's worth I thought they were delicious.

If you like deviled eggs with sweet pickles, then you will probably like this more sophisticated version of the stuffed egg. The chutney imparts a sweet, tangy flavor that is wonderful. The hot version of Major Grey's is excellent and is my preference in most recipes.

A big hit at a party! I was skeptical about the curry/chutney combo, but it worked out perfectly. I didn't have any yogurt so I added a bit of creamy salad dressing to make up for it. I also didn't add a scalion either. I would certainly make this again!

Great change from more familiar recipes. Family (even fussy eater son) ate with pleasure. Wonder what different chutneys would add -- think I'll find out!

I made this for a party three years ago .... my guests are STILL discussing these eggs! They are a delicious variation to the old standby.
