I have picky eaters in my family -- a child with high-functioning autism that doesn't eat anything I fix -- except for this! He loved it and wanted his own plate; that gets high marks in my book! I did just medallions instead of a roast. I lined them up like a roast and rubbed the outsides with the seasonings. We were very impressed with how accurate the temperature and time settings were for cooking medium rare. I am not a mayo person at all but will admit that adding the meat juices and seasoning to the mayo and dipping the tenderloin in the topping was absolutely divine. This is a must make meal for company and special occasions. I will be making again--soon!

WOW! Devoured! I will admit I used about 8 cloves of garlic, 2 tsps smk. paprika, 2 tsps cumin, 1/4 c. oil and pureed everything in the food processor before pouring/rubbing mixture into meat. Roasted large moose tenderloin on a bed of onions. Lots of juices left to mix in with mayo. To save a step I just kept back 1/4 c. of rub mixture and mixed with mayo instead of adding more spices. Easy and oh so good!

Wow this was so good. The best part is the leftover sandwiches the next day. Really flavorful.

Delicious; but I have a question. I roasted a 1 3/4 pound piece as a rehearsal for Christmas Eve dinner. The 500 degree oven resulted in a lot of smoke and char on the bottom of the pan, when I'd like to have some nice "au jus." Would it ruin the roasting to have a little water or broth in the bottom of the pan to prevent scorching at that temperature? (Assuming the meat is well above the liquid on a rack)

I have made this about 5 or 6 times now and felt I should give it the rave review it deserves. Not only is it a huge party pleaser, it is very easy to prepare and serve - either cold, warm or hot. Definitely double the rub and marinate overnight for best results if you have the time. The mayonnaise is an excellent accompaniment and the leftovers make any sandwich taste gourmet. My teenage boys LOVE this!

I liked this and everyone thought it was great- but my boyfriend commented that he didnt think it had that much flavor and I would have to agree with him. I doubled the rub but maybe I could have even put a little more- I liked the mayo but again maybe i could put in a bit more flavor ...

YUMMY. Perfect twist on tenderloin in the summer when you don"t want to start the grill. You can hang out with your guest and the Mayo makes it a lighter steak option. Serve with roasted potatoes and your guest will dip in the mayo

I made this for a cocktail party, serving it in thin slices with the mayo and a basket of french bread, and it was devoured. Wonderful flavor! This will be my go-to recipe for tenderloin from now on.

Made this as part of an appetizer table- -the guests loved it. Made it with pork tenderloin instead of beef. For the mayo, used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayo, so it was more of a sauce. Wonderful!

Just outstanding. It didn't take long to cook--I took it out after 23 min just to test it and it was done. (We have a hot oven.) Also, I bought the tenderloin from a wholesale club and trimmed and tied it myself and there's a great video on youtube that shows how to do that.

FANTASTIC! Loved this recipe. The rub had me a little concerned. The cumin was strong in the rub, however, when roasted the smoked paprika really took its place. This was awesome! I followed the recipe to the letter, with one exception. I doubled the rub recipe and used a 2lb roast. Cooked at 500 as directed and the roast was perfectly rare! I would suggest cooking slightly longer if your guests are "medium" people! I served it with a Shiraz from Argentina, Bacon and Gorgonzola potato salad, bitter greens and young carrots. Delicious!

Very easy and outstanding flavor. Cooking for the described time and allowing the meat to sit under foil produced a perfectly medium rare roast. The aoli is delicious and any left over is perfect with crudites. Exceptional for a special meal.

Excellent flavor and so easy to prepare. I also doubled the rub ingredients and marinated the meat for about 5 hours. I did heat the oven to 500 but lowered it to 450 because it was getting too dark (I even put a foil tent over the roast during last 10 minutes). The mayo was fantastic

i loved this recipe!! so easy to make and delicious. excellent without the mayo if you are trying to limit the fat. smoked paprika (i used hot rather than sweet) is my new favorite spice! definitely double the rub - you can always use the extra another day. this will be a regular on my table. beef tenderloin is always an elegant choice when entertaining and this recipe gives what might be boring an interesting twist. you'll love it!

As ever, a large beef tenderloin is an easy entertaining hit. This is delicious (nice crust formed by the paprika rub), however I would recommend making double the portion of rub if you have a large (4lb) piece. Also, if you're going for medium rare with a nice seared crust, I like to put the beef into a 500 degree oven and never turn down. When the beef gets to 115 degrees internal, pull it out and let sit 10 mins. Perfect medium rare but with a darker outside.

AWESOME!I bought "invested in" a beautiful Coleman loin roast;tender beyond belief. Spice rub excellent as well as dip. Very easy and quick to make for a crowd. I agree with previous cook to marinate.

WHOA! This was a HUGE hit. The flavors are big and everyone enjoyed. In the future I would make the rub and apply to beef 8-12 hours before cooking.

Super easy to make and delicious. Everyone loved it with the mayo dip - from grandma to my 4 year old.
