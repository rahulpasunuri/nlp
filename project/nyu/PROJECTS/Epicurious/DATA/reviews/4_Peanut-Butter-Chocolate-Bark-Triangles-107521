I made these last year and they were universally loved. Also, peanut brittle is suprisingly easy to make, so I suggest making your own. That way you end up with two types of candy if you are thinking of giving them out as gifts. (Joy of cooking Peanut Brittle recipe--a silicon matt for pouring and cooling works astonishingly well). A final thought on this recipe: last year I had no problems with layers seperating; this year I had some problems. I think relatively humidity may be the culprit. It was raining this year. I hope to try again this week when, hopefully, the weather will be a little less humid. If I see any difference I'll post back. Enjoy.

Overall, a very good candy - the taste was delicious. I agree that the process was a bit time-consuming, though, and I had difficulty cutting it. The different layers often separated when cut, leaving me with some pieces that were incomplete and not too attractive.

An excellent Christmas candy recipe- my new favorite!

These are really good--I was pleasantly surprised at the nice combo of texture and flavor. I agree with the easy but time-consuming part. I also had a little trouble spreading the layers after the first one. You do have to work fast.

These were a huge hit. I used a little less brittle than called for. Easy but time consuming.
