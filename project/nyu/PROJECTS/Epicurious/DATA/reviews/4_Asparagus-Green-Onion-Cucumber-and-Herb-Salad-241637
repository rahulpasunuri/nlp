Loved the do-ahead part of this. I didn't have fresh chervil, mint or tarragon; I used celery leaves instead and driet tarragon. Also agreed with other reviewers and cut down on the oil in the dressing. I used Meyer lemons and the dressing was fantastic.

Excellent. Although I didn't bother following the quantities in the dressing; I used the same ingredients and my good judgement in terms of proportions. I almost doubled the recipe (about 2 kg of asparagus) for an Easter brunch buffet for approx. 20 people. Everyone raved and I found it fresh, tangy and flavourful. And practical to make since it's a do-ahead. A great way to indulge in fresh asparagus without dousing it in heavy hollandaise.

Very tasty. I made the dressing with 1/3 cup of oil. Then half the salad. No chervil, but the dressing was excellent. poaching the green onions worked very well. Nicely do ahead and not very hard to make.

With a couple of tweaks, this salad recipe is delicious. It is very fresh and flavorful. I agree that it needs much less oil, and more herbs.For my full review, please visit my blog at http://three-egg-whites.blogspot.com/2009/04/asparagus-green-onion-cucumber-and-herb.html

I REALLY like this recipe and have made it several times. Everyone says they like it, but I always have lots left over and other then me no one goes for seconds.

Wonderful summer dish. Made for a dinner party of 6 people and had massive amounts of leftovers! At least enough for another 6 people. Only used half the dressing and was plenty. Wonderful flavors and although a little labor intensive, well worth it!

This is a quick, easy and delicious side dish. I will certainly be making it again.

It was so pretty with the cucumber salad on top of the asparagus. I found a man at the local farmers market that makes fresh goat cheese. I used a spring onion and cucumber flavored goat cheese from him and it was amazing.

Yum! Made this for Easter and everybody loved it. I agree, I would cut the oil in half. Way too much. Ended up an oil soup in the bottom of the platter.

This was such a great salad!! A little heavy on the oil. I only had fresh parsley and mint, and dry others. it was good anyway. Everyone loved it at our Easter dinner. Will become a regular.

Very refreshing and everyone appreciated it.

I would make this only if the asparagus is not of high quality or out of season since the flavors are so strong, especially the dijon mustard. If the asparagus is not super great in and of itself, this is a great way to experiment with different flavors.

This was pretty okay. If asparagus is in season, I probably would not make this, but if you have asparagus that is not super high quality, then I'd take the time to make the dressing.
