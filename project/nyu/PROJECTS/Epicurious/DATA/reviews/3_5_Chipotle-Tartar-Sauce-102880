Delicious on turkey burgers and I bet it would be great in tuna salad. I did add two teaspoons of the adobo sauce the chipotle comes in because without it, it didn't have the spice level I was looking for.

This sauce is excellent on turkey burgers!

Good -- not spectacular. However, it is so convenient (since I always have every ingredient in my pantry) that I am certain I will find myself making it again.

We found this to be a very unique and interesting spicy tartar sauce... great to dress up a number of dishes, and very easy to prepare.

I always make a 1/2 recipe and it is now the only tartar sauce we use. It is delicious. Friends keep asking for the recipe.

I put all ingredients in my mini processor and blended it. I didn't have lime juice so I used lemon. It was terrific. I'd put this on tamales, sandwiches as a spread, on chicken. It's great.

Very good, but too much.

Was great with my crab cakes! The only change I made was to blend the chipotle with the mayonaise first and then add the other ingredients. I found it spread the flavor of the chiles more evenly.
