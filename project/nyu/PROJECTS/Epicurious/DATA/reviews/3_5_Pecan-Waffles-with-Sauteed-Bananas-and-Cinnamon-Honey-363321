I only made the waffled and they had a very filling, distinct taste. I would replace half the pecans with whole wheat flour for a flurried texture. Definetly yummy, though.

Very good. Light. The bananas really round it all out. We didn't make the full cinnamon honey recipe. Instead, we just added some cinnamon and honey to the bananas.

This was such an unexpected surprise! I made the batter for this and was not feeling good about it, I was sure they wouldn't turn out well. But we made them just to see and my family loved them--toddlers and adults alike! And it got a lot of good nuts into little tummies. My husband loved them because normally he feels waffles or pancakes make him feel sluggish from the sugar, but since these are such high protein, it's a different feeling. And they are very filling. However, I will say, if you are craving a WAFFLE, this recipe is probably not for you. They are very distinct tasting. So, if you want to try something a little different, give it a try!
