Like many others, I am surprised at how flavorful the ragout is. As a home cook who goes through a lot of garbanzos and tomatos, especially in curries and things, this is a nice new twist on great flavors that I hadn't thought of. I will be making this again and experimenting with the combination much more in the future. As a side note, the ragout is very chunky, and the visual presentation of the dish really depends on how you prepped your onions and tomatos. They are really visible and prominent in the final product. Needless to say, I prepped in a hurry, so my ragout is a bit ugly. I wonder how this sauce would hold up to a pulse or two in the food processor...with garbanzos pureed or whole...So many textures to try! I must start eating this batch so I can make more!

Made this without the Gremolata. It was AMAZING! the feta crusted chicken is delicious on it's own and so quick and simple to make. The ragout takes a little more work, but still not too bad. Delicious!

Overall, this dish was very good. I personally ate the Ragout and the Chicken seperate and did not add the gremolata.

My husband and son liked this a lot more than I did. I couldn't find "creole" mustard so used a spicy brown, but it wasn't enough flavor. I didn't like the gremolata at all, but my husband loved it. I think my mistake was in using pretty fat chicken breasts. Thin ones would have been much better.

This recipe was so delicious. I made it for an informal regular dinner party and it was one of favorite dishes. The ragout is easy and tasty (I could not find creole mustard so I used spicy brown and added a bit to it). I also used turkey jerky for non red meat eaters of friends. This combination of flavors is tremendous

It was wonderful but cut back on the mustard and use fresh Garbanzo beans if you can find them - I get them at WinCo

this was an excellent recipe. i used it in a dinner tasting menu and i did change a few things though. i omitted the gremolata, beef jerky, and used more feta. and for the ragout i added roasted green and yellow peppers. this was exceptional.

I found this dish wonderful, although I did not follow it to the letter. I skipped the jerky (didn't have any) and the gremelata (don't typically like gremalata and didn't have the ingredients). The ragout was wonderful and I ate it with a little left over cheese mixture the next day. The dish was a great hit.

Followed the recipe to the letter. OK flavour but quite a lot of work for a dish that isn't visually appealing ~ thus not company quality and therefore not worth the effort IMHO.

This was absolutely delicious! I was afraid the feta topping would melt off the chicken when placed in the hot oven, but it crusted up beautifully. I used bone-in split chicken breasts for better flavor. The ragout is lovely; I omitted the beef jerkey and used Gulden's since I didn't know what Creole Mustard was. A keeper.

I was pleasantly surprised at how good the chicken and ragout were. The gremolata didn't suit our tastes, so next time we'll omit it altogether. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.

This recipe was interesting, different and flavorful. It isn't as hard as the longish directions make it seem. I added some zucccini to the garbanzo ragout to up the vegetable quotient and it was great. A nice cold weather bowl!!

A big hit! Quite unusual ingredients, and delicious. The recipe looked time-consuming, but wasn't at all--made the ragout the day before, so all I had to do was make the gremolata while the chicken baked. I served w/steamed sugar snap peas because plate looked a little dull, even w/the gremolata. But the dish itself was not at all dull. Would definately make again!
