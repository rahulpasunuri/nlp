This was really good although straining the soup is a pain. I ended up with a lot of "fish mush" (tilapia and red snapper) that I wasn't quite sure what to do with. I ended up adding some more broth to the mush and pushing it through the strainer again just to extract some more flavor from it; then I threw a few spoonfuls of the mush back into the soup. Using sea salt instead of plain old table salt adds some more "briny" flavor to it, too. The aoli was just okay. Rouille would be much better.

Excellent recipe. Very authentic. Don't use epensive fish for this soup. You don't need to. I bought some tilapia for the "soup" part and some sea bass for the "fish" part. I cooked it all until I was almost ready to puree, and pulled out the nice piece of bass and set it aside. I then made a silky, saffron colored soup as instucted Then added some mussels for taste and variety. Put the bass back in and served with the ailoi toasts. Stir a small dollop of aioli into the soup, yum. Note: if you like the soup more pulpy with small bits of fish, instead of smooth you can add crushed up fish back to the soup from the sieve.

Easy, except for the actual fish part, I made everything a day ahead. The day of my company, I just assembled a salad, reheated the soup and added the fish. Super meal. Great reviews

Instead, try Soupe de Poisson, the original french version of this dish. Instead of Aioli, it uses Rouille, a traditional french sauce. A search on the www.sfgate.com website will turn up the recipe.

Agreed that the aioli is far too much and I too will halve it next time. I also preferred halving the slices of toasted baguette - more bite sized. This is an superb recipe! I did not blend the soup entirely nor did I push it all through a sieve -- turned off by the idea of "mush" to which other reviewers alluded. I only partially pureed it with my hand blender directly in the pot (luckily the charge ran dry or I might have gone too far!), preferring whole chunks of fish and vegetables amongst the partial puree - more palatable texture. I also used less fish than called for: about 1 lb halibut, 1 lb catish (tilapia might be a milder choice) and 1/3 lb NZ orange roughy, which may have helped to keep the soup/stew's integrity. The leeks I bought were huge (about 2 in. in diam.) so I used less than two, and my fennel bulb was nice and large. This makes an excellent meal of fish and vegetables complementing one another. Fish stock? I went with organic free range chicken stock from cartons in keeping with the recipe, and this taste divine! Yum!!! This dish will definitely find its place in my permanent file!

Rave review from my husband. I plan to make it for my next dinner party. I plan to make a few small changes: Make the croutons smaller, not slices (easier to eat in the soup); puree less forcefully, so the soup will be thinner (not so much like "baby food"- my husband's words; and add and cook other fish and shellfish at the end, so it can be a fuller meal. Otherwise, loved it. One other comment: the recipe for the aioli is more than needed for the soup recipe. I would halve it. Additional comment after making this a second time: Don't need to use expensive filets to make stock - can use whole cut up fish, head and all, and then puree only soft parts. I then added to basic pureed soup various fish and shellfish to make a more solid and impressive-looking meal. Other reviewers' suggestions of saving some of original fish as solid and not pureed might also be valid. It has become a company dinner in our house, and it impresses.

Bouillabase is a lot MORE difficult to make - this was fairly easy to make, and if you spend that much on fish ($50) you're using a better quality fish than necessary. This recipe can be left "chunkier" (more like a stew) and, served with a salad, can stand on it's own. I served extra toasts topped with aoili on the side and everyone grabbed and dipped over and over. Serve with a medium to full bodied wine and you have a great meal!

Way too much trouble for the product. While it smelled wonderful while cooking, the traditional bouillabaisse would have been much better. Especially didn't like leaving behind $50 worth of fish mush that didn't fit through sieve. Here's a tip -- either leave some fish pieces whole or get creative with fish puree. It did make a great fish salad sandwich when mixed with leftover aioli.

I made this soup for a dinner party. Everyone loved it!! One of my guests, a chef, raved about it. It was easy to make. I used orange roughy, catfish, and dorry--because that is what I had on hand. Although I pureed it, I think it would have been good either way. The aioli was wonderful on toasted crusted bread.
