Being Cuban I can guarantee some fixes to the recipe, tips to consider: 'It's better to cook the beans in a pressure cooker, adding to the beginning 1 or 2 bay leaves for flavor, this reduces the cooking time of beans just a half hour or 45 minutes depending on the beans. -Salt and pepper should be added along with the other spices in the pan -Near the end, before turning it off, add a teaspoon of sugar and two ounces of dry wine (try first with one ounce, just in case) Sour cream, cilantro and jalapenos are Mexican additions, not Cuban.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was horrible. They must have left out a step.

After reading reviews went with this recipe and it was so bland. Will need to add something to make it edible.

I thought this recipe was so so, but was shocked at how much my family enjoyed it, much more so than other black bean soups i've made that took me hours... I would use chipotle puree (puree canned chipotles in adobo sauce) next time instead of the canned chilis for a little more punch and interest.

I sauted the onions, peppers, garlic and some carrots in the oil and added bacon, added the beans I soaked overnight, some homemade hot sauce (very hot) and cilantro. It was very very tasty and a good consistancy after I blended with a hand blender in the pot.

This is a quick and easy meatless soup with a lot of flavor! I cheated and used canned beans to save a step and also added a few red pepper flakes for a spicier taste. I will definitely make this again!

This soup was easy and very good. I soaked the beans overnight and I also cooked them with 2 dried hot peppers. (Beano would be a good additive)
