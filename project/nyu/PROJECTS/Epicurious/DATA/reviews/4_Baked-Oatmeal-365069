This was an easy and delicious recipe my family asked me to slice the bananas thinner because they thought the thick banana slices left a mushy baby food texture on the bottom. With the thinner bananas they love this for Saturday morning brunch.

Very simple to make and delicious. Great way to use very ripe bananas. I made it without the egg and it was totally fine. I did mash up a bit of banana into the milk mixture to take its place.

this recipe is really good. Naturally I altered it a bit because I didn't have bananas handy. Like other reviewers I added vanilla soy milk and apples (I also cooked it a tad longer than normal) and I had frozen blueberries on top. I also added some ground flax, pecans and pistachios. I'll be making this again!

I used almond milk due to a lactose intolerant family member and it turned out perfectly. I used vanilla flavored, unsweetened.

Easy and delicious! I love the taste of the roasted bananas so I add more. I also use brown sugar and omit the butter. Great breakfast dish for a group or made to eat with leftovers during the week. Looking to try some variations -- maybe apples, pears, etc.

Made this recipe for friends for a late breakfast and it was heartily enjoyed by everyone. Used all the ingredients called for, but misread the instructions and mixed everything together. Worked out great.

I'm in love with this recipe. Not only is it easy but it's DELICIOUS! I use brown sugar or sugar in the raw instead of the maple syrup. I've also used chopped apples in this recipe along with the berries. Amazing! I found that I needed to let it bake a bit longer with the apples included. This oatmeal is also great as a dessert with ice cream on top.

Really liked this oatmeal, as did my friends and coworkers. I used steel cut oatmeal that had soaked in water all night. I rinsed and drained it very well before mixing it with the dry ingredients. I think I'll be making this often.

This is fabulous and unbelievably easy. I have made it for work and home. Everyone, without exception, raved.

I have made this using pears instead of bananas, 1 TBSP of brown sugar and 1/4 tsp. salt. I have added slivered almonds instead of walnuts and it is a hit in our house. I like to heat the milk to speed up the baking and allow it to soak the oats a bit. Trader Joe's old fashioned oats from Canada have the best taste I have found.

I confess I did not make this recipe as written. However, it is extremely flexible. I've made it with mangoes on the bottom, and raspberries or blackberries in the middle. I also use chopped almonds (i like them better). I found that maple syrup didn't really add much, I like using brown sugar better. Also I have not found a good way to get the cinnamon to distribute throughout - it doesn't really blend with the oats, and in the liquid ingredients forms clumps that are unpleasant to look at but actually distribute better. This reheats in the microwave VERY well so you can cook on the weekend & have a really nice breakfast later during the week.

Just LOVED this recipe. I follow Heidi's blog, 101 Cookbooks and have tried so many of her recipes that it is love, love, love at every bite. Quite often I throttle back on the sugar/syrup/sweetner but she is usually right on the mark. For this recipe I subbed the milk with 1/2 skim and 1/2 vanilla almond and that works so well for us. Additionally, I only use two tbs of butter and serve with vanilla and honey greek yogurt and an assortment of add'l fresh fruits on the side. HEAVEN! I've made this dish five times and swapped out different fruits and each time my family and friends RAVE about this. Try it and you won't be disappointed!

This is a superb on a cold winter day. There were a few modifications that I made to the recipe. I used sliced almonds instead of walnuts because I prefer them. I used additional cinnamon, vanilla paste, bananas, and blueberries. My husband said put in the keep file and use often!

Great texture and much lighter than oatmeal normally is. 1/2 recipe worked well in a 7 1/2" souffle dish. I'll be trying other fruit and spice combinations.

Wonderful! I used brown sugar, and was lucky enough to still have some huckleberries from the summer in the freezer just waiting for a worthy use. We'll be making this again for the family's Christmas breakfast. And I don't even like regular oatmeal!

Great! Made it with frozen raspberries and blueberries and used brown sugar. The kiddo loved it and it smelled wonderful in the oven. I made it for dinner and he kept saying, "it's like dessert for dinner!" Definitely a keeper!

Nice simple wholesome. Not too sweet, so perfect for breakfast. I used a few berries and substituted the rest for apples mixed with marionberry jam (what I had) and used pecans instead of walnuts. I plan on making a double batch with the berries for Thanksgiving breakfast as it is a nice and easy thing to make and makes the kitchen smell wonderful.

Yummy, filling, and wholesome breakfast option for my kids. Amen.

I substituted flaxseed and more milk for the egg because I don't care for custard and substituted honey for the sugar/maple syrup. Turned out wonderful! I'm going to try it with apples and cranberries this winter.

Delicious! I'll definitely be making this again. I used coconut milk instead of regular milk, and it worked well. I also used frozen strawberries instead of the blueberries because it's all I had on hand...tastes great

I made this for the first time today. I used vanilla rice milk since there were some dairy allergies, omitted the butter and vanilla and used bananas, raspberries and blueberries. Fantastic! Milk substitution was perfect. Would work with soy or almond milk for sure. Bananas made is very sweet. Next time I am going to try sliced apples and berries since apple, oatmeal and cinnamon are a natural. Great cottage recipe for easy, filling recipe and the aroma from the oven was intoxicating!

Just made this with soy milk; it is so good. Definitely a keeper.

My family enjoyed this. I used sliced bananas (3, because mine were not very big), and then frozen blueberries. I used only half the amount of butter and pure maple syrup, and it was plenty sweet. I took it out of the oven at about 36 or 37 minutes, but think I'd bake it a bit longer next time because it was a bit more moist then we'd like. Still would give it 4 forks for ease and taste, and I'd give it pretty high marks for nutritious - dairy, whole grain and fruit. Next time I'm going to use rhubarb sauce as others suggest, I stew it with chopped ginger and brown sugar, and think that would make a fine base, put the nuts on top. As the weather thaws here in the tundra, this recipe will probably go into storage till fall when it's nice to have the oven on in the morning.

I love berries but I'm not a big banana person, so I went to the grocery store with an open-minded approach to fruit. I would have loved to add some peach or nectarine, alas, they are not in season. I settled on pears, blueberries, and rhubarb, the latter of which I poached before adding to the baking dish. It was a great combination... the tanginess of the rhubarb was offset by the sweetness of the pear, and the blueberries are like little fruity explosions when you dig in. I was low on cinnamon, so I threw in a little allspice. It came together beautifully. I might add another egg next time for some better adhesion, but it was really nice just as written. I think this is a very forgiving recipe. Use the fruit you love best. Yum.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't change a thing in this recipe my first time...but now I'm thinking of all of the different fruit combinations I want to experiment with. Leftovers are fab reheated in the microwave, I just add a bit of extra milk and zonk it for a few minutes - a great breakfast to pack and take to the office when you're on the run.

When this recipe popped up as the recipe of the day I RAN to WF to find blueberries. I already had all of the other ingredients, ready to go. I love the idea of baked oatmeal and was looking for an alternative to banana bread. Very easy and the house smelled like heaven. The final result is yum, if a little hippie-70's. Best when eaten straight out of the oven with a little bit of vanilla ice cream melting in the bowl next to it. mmm. The bananas on the bottom were a little sad & mushy on the bottom the next day. Make sure to reheat any leftovers.

I absolutely LOVE Heidi Swanson's blog and cookbooks, so I knew I'd enjoy this recipe! I used maple syrup and blueberries here, and replaced the egg with a flaxseed/water combo. My bananas weren't quite ripe, but I actually liked that they didn't add too much sweetness and kept their shape. I didn't do the butter/extra syrup on top, but did serve it with vanilla yogurt. It was a hit!

I made this oatmeal for my mom on mother's day! Total winner. I would make it all the time. And SUPER FILLING! I also add it with Greek yogurt which is delicious. I say the more fruit the merrier. Bananas are key, they add alot of sweetness. Next time I want to use toasted almonds and add a few dates in there.

Delish! I doubled the recipe to serve 11 (mostly teenagers) and it was great. I second kandinskydog's comment about Heidi's blog--the photography is beautiful, and the recipes so creative.

Wow! This will now be a Sunday staple at our house. We had no berries, so I used rhubarb. I cooked the rhubarb down with 2/3c sugar and a tsp of grated lemon zest, then used the syrup as the sugar for the recipe. It turned out fabulous.

Delicious, easy alternative to oatmeal. You can lighten this up by using Truvia or Splenda as the sweetener and low or non fat milk or fat free half and half. I don't use butter to grease the pan just a non stick spray. Yummy!

I don't like "regular" oatmeal but love baked oatmeal. Don't add the extra sugar...its not necessary with the ripe bananas. If you need it sweeter, add maple syrup on top when you eat it. I only use 1 cup milk and add an extra egg these days but that is a personal preference change. It is great as written.

There is nothing better than baked oatmeal; kids love it - adults love it; the variations can include fruit and even chocolate chips!!! It's a great breakfast treat that keeps well if you make it in larger quantities... give it a try!

It was a cold, dreary morning here, and this recipe seemed to fit the bill for breakfast. Using what was available in the pantry, I substituted a combination of cranberries and raisins for the berries. Also, for just the two of us I cut the measurements in half and baked it in a deep pie dish. Delicious comfort food! I'm eating this as I type and am already thinking of future variations. The first will be banana, cherry, almond. How about banana, peanut butter, peanuts (or chocolate chips)?

Loved the idea of this and based on the ingredients, thought it would taste a bit like a crisp, but it didn't. Was very 'healthy' tasting - more so than when I make normal oatmeal. In light of that, I'd rather make normal oatmeal, which takes less time, and mix in bananas, strawberries and nuts! I really wanted to like this more, but can't give it more than 2 forks.

would like to know how many calories in a serving..recipes never give this info too fattening.

One of my favorite feeds is Heidi's blog, 101 Cookbooks. I have already made this (a healthy delicious and nutritious alternative to my fav oatmeal drowned in heavy cream and maple syrup) as she got an 8 page spread in the May issue of Whole Living with this as one of the recipes. The only thing equal to her recipes are her cooking along photos. Go look and get addicted like this oat dish and all things Heidi! LOL

Excellent, and very filling... great for serving to overnight guests, as it doesn't take long to prep. I used fresh strawberries and the maple syrup option, and next time I might opt to leave out the bananas and just use more mixed berries. I thought it could use a little brown sugar in addition to the syrup, but not much, since the berries do make it fairly sweet.

This is so delicious, I will never eat oatmeal any other way again. Used maple syrup, blueberries and bananas, everyone loved it.

it wasn't exactly how i like my oatmeal, but it was alright. it was sort of like a dry rice pudding of sorts. after a couple of bites though, i was pretty addicted to the stuff. btw, instead of the fresh fruit, i used dried cranberries and raisins.
