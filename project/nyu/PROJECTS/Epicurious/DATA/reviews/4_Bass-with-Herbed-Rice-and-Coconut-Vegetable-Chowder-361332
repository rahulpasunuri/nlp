There were so many unnecessary steps and /or ingredients. No need to strain the "chowder", why use two different types of potatoes? And plenty of flavor going on without using herbed rice. Even the fish was unnecessary as it makes a nice vegetable curry over plain rice. I enjoyed the dish, but if you are going to go through the trouble for a complex recipe it had better earn it.

I omitted the jalapeno to make this dish child friendly. I heard words like "best dinner ever" when serving this up. No bribes were involved. More eggs than stated are needed for the first part of the fish to keep the flour/egg mix from being overly dry. Make sure you keep the pan for the fish well oiled, any dry spots burn. Other than that, my only thought is that this dish is a LOT of work, if you're thinking of a quick 30 minute meal this is NOT it. It is fantastic and worth the effort but it is a 1.5-2hr meal.

This recipe is fantastic, but I agree that you will want to taste for seasoning as you go. I made the broth as written (though I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable broth), and after simmering it needed at least a little saltinstead I added about 2 tablespoons each of additional fish sauce and lime juice (like most Thai recipes, you usually need to adjust the sweet/salty/sour balance). Other than that, this recipe was great. The fish is not the star herethe broth is the centerpiece, so next time I may just broil the fishthere was plenty of crunch from the veg that I do not think Ill miss the panko and definitely will not miss the extra calories. What makes the recipe a standout is the clever use of carrot juicesure, substituting red curry paste would work, but it is the carrot juice that makes the color so beautiful and the flavor so unique. We loved this!!

Carrot juice is a nice touch, but next time I'll just add red curry paste rather than taking an hour to boil down the broth, which didn't do much for the flavor. Definitely salt the fish enough - otherwise it's pretty plain.

We made plenty of minor substitutions to use what was on hand at home but the chowder was still excellent. Everyone loved it. I would definitely take the "tip" advice and start it a day before if time is an issue. We used Talapia but feel that any light meat or tofu would work.

High praise for this recipe at a recent dinner party. I added asparagus and zucchini (omitted the red bell pepper) and used coconut sugar instead of palm sugar. I couldn't find kaffir lime leaves so followed the substitution advice. Also went with fingerling potatoes rather than yukon gold. Used Jasmine rice in the pressure cooker instead of herb rice. It all worked very well. Fresh halibut, while expensive, was excellent.

Delicious dish! Well worth the time it takes to make. Have made this a few times and even the kids like it. I omitted the potatoes and substituted water chestnuts for crunch. Any vegetables you have on hand work - mushrooms, red pepppers, asparagus etc. Could use a bit more spice and less sugar. Carrot juice is a must. Will definitely make this often!

I thought this was excellent; however it does not take 2 hours and 45 minutes. I don't know how they come up with that. It took me 1:15 start to finish. i didn't strain it though. I took out the lime leaf and used an immersion blender. Next time I will cut back on the sugar, skip the potatoes and just use the sweet potatoes, and make it hotter. That 1 T. of jalapeno was not enough. We added Siriaca at the table.

I made one change to the recipe -- I omitted the sugar completely. Did everything else as written. An interesting combo of spicy,crunchy and subtly sweet (if you don't add the sugar). Used cod, held together well.

I've made this recipe at least 6 times already - twice for special company! But my teenage girls love this recipe! A real winner in taste & you feel so heathly afterwords. This is in my permanent file.

This had a gorgeous taste and looked beautiful on the plate as well. I used a stick of lemongrass in place of the lime leaves, which worked very well. I think next time I'd replace the potatoes with a less starchy vegetable or just leave them out altogether; there's plenty going on in this dish as it is.

Absolutely delicious! Followed directions for chowder to a tee, including directions for prep ahead. I think the carrot juice is essential because it adds a sweetness to the chowder.

Sublime. Worth the effort. Used seabass cut into 1/2 inch slices, lime juice and grated rind, low fat coconut milk, Swansons veg broth (and I mistrust any broth in a can) yellow skinned sweet potato, and baby Dutch potatoes, and did not strain the sauce (forgot - no need). Used fresh basil and parsley in the rice. Complex sauce with great interest from all vegies. Great textures. I was in the moment with this dish. Thanks to its creator.

We couldn't find any halibut or bass so we did it with orange roughy. It was a delicious meal. However, we did leave the seeds of the jalepeno in and it nearly overpowered the dish. If you are cooking for people who don't like spicey stuff I would cut the seeds in half or leave them out completely.

Deelish. I used 4 cups of chicken stock instead of veg broth and carrot juice and cut out the sugar (my kids don't like sweet main dishes). Skipped the fish and sauteed up frozen shrimp with lime, garlic and hot pepper and added them on top of the dish. Am sure fish would be good, too. This is a keeper--and a great way to get kids to eat veggies.

Too much sauce. Do not use the carrot juice. It overtakes the sauce.

Rating: 3
this is delicious. I made some changes becouse I did not have all the ingredients: I used 1 small bay leaf instead of the limes one, I did not used carrot juice I just omitted..anyway it tourned out very good and the left over is maybe better...just try to make it ...

I thought this was a really good recipe overall but I had to add some more spices to the chowder for my taste. If you can find them, I strongly recommend using the kaffir lime leaves as they add a very unique flavour. I tried it with both striped bass and halibut - I preferred the striped bass (note that my cooking time for the bass was less than for the halibut). While I thought this was a great recipe, I am not sure it is entirely worth all of the time it takes to put together (but it took me longer than I expected).

Made this last night for friends who thought it was fabulous. I was less enthused, perhaps because I like spicier and they don't. I made the chowder the day ahead and added extra veggies. Also used cod because there was no halibut at the fish markets. Also used rice with herbs. All in all, it was good, but I prefer the recipe on this site for a coconut sauce with red Thai curry paste . . .

Rating: 3
So after the sauce was done, it turned out tasting like a sweeter, slightly carrot tasting, less spicy version of a thai yellow curry sauce (made w/ red curry). If I were to do this again, I'd just do the authentic thai sauce and cook the fish/rice the same way...if you have any asian markets nearby, the ingredients for it would be easy to find.

Would any breadcrumbs do as I can't find panko?

Super yummy. Made the chowder as per the recipe, used plain steamed rice and for the fish I broiled some Mahi-Mahi (hey, it's what I had in the freezer) after first marinating in soy sauce. Will I make again? Heck yes!

I only make 4 fork recipes and this is to die for! If you are watching your calories this is how I made the recipe...I used the zest and about 3/4 of the juice from 2 limes. I threw the rest of the juice in with the rice. I doubled the basil and cilantro in the rice. I used light coconut milk and 2 T dark brown sugar + 2 T splenda. The sauce was still really rich. I also used fresh carrot juice from a local health food cafe. I doubled the peas, red peppers and carrots because I wanted more veggies. I also sprayed the fish with pam, browned in a nonstick skillet and then transfered it to the oven to finish at 350. You get the same crispy outside that was with a lot less calories.

Wonderful recipe! Flavorful and great presentation. My husband said he felt like he had a personal chef cooking for him. I knocked this recipe out in 1 3/4 hours total by working fast and cutting down the chowder cooking time by about 10 minutes. It probably wasn't quite as thick but that was fine--this was weeknight cooking. And, yes, I did change the recipe up a bit because I am gluten-intolerant and my husband does not eat white potatoes. So...I used Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Flour instead of regular flour. (It has a strong odor-- ignore it--it will disappear in the cooking) Instead of using panko crumbs, I finely crushed Glutino Original Gluten Free Crackers. I used all sweet potatoes in place of potatoes. I did not have kaffir leaves so I used limes. I used the palm sugar. Two stores did not have snap peas so I used snow peas. Last, halibut was $20 a pound so I substituted a deep sea flounder that had the same thickness as the halibut (at about half the price) If I would change anything, I might double the jalapenos because we like a little kick, but if I were you, I would try the recipe as written first. This is a winner!

Wow, this is excellent! The gravy wasn't that complicated to make since I chopped everything roughly because I was goind to puree it instead of discarting solids(before the potato step). I used more garlic, basil, and kaffir. I used swai fillets because it was cheap, and they turned out delicious! I will cut down the sugar amount next time. I cooked the potatoes in the curry pot. Served with jasmine rice and shrimp summer roll from this site. YUM! everyone loved it!

This is exceptional! Everything about the dish works well together and it's a truly beautiful presentation. You could easily leave off the fish for an amazing vegetarian dish, but it's wonderful with the crisp fish on top (I used halibut). The only change I'll make next time is to use a scant quarter cup of sugar instead of the full amount--the chowder was just a touch sweeter than I'd prefer. It's a great weekend meal, because it does take some time to put together, but it's well worth it. I'm already excited for leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

Amazingly delicious but very time consuming. A special occasion treat!

I substituted mahi mahi in lieu of bass which I couldn't find and it was quite good. Instead of the basil garnish, I topped it off with fresh cilantro sprigs which were a really nice addition. Next time I will try the basil garnish. The chowder recipe is quite time consuming, so I made the full recipe for the 2 of us, but cooked just enough fish for one meal. I froze the remaining chowder. Now I have two future meals with the ease of just cooking up fresh fish. Can't beat that! My husband loved it and suggested it would be a great dish for company! I agree. Just a lovely, lovely dish!

So good! This was the perfect dish for the beginning of autumn. The flavors and textures of the rice, chowder, and crispy fish (I used snapper) were great together! I didn't have Kaffir leaves like many of the other reviewers, but it was wonderful anyways. I'm always on the lookout for inexpensive but richly delicious recipes, and this is one I'll definitely be making again!

Where's the recipe for the herbed rice?

Loved this! Worth the time it takes. Used halibut, lime juice instead of lime leaves (and not even lime rind because I was lazy), bottled ginger juice instead of fresh ginger, jarred minced garlic, light brown sugar instead of dark, and we forgot the carrot and it was amazing! Can't wait to have this for lunch tomorrow.

Agree with the cook from Toronto. The chowder is incredible!! Used Japanese sticky rice and was perfect in the bottom of the bowl.

Oh my god, this chowder is to die for. Seriously. I will name my next child after this chowder. Songs should be written about it. It is, bar none, the most awesome liquid ever detailed on this site in the history of time. I could not find Kaffir lime leaves so went with the substituted lime juice / lime rind - no problem. I also played around with different fish - halibut, snapper - it makes no difference, because you mouth is paralyzed by the awesomeness of the chowder such that you forget there are other foods there. Cooking time on the vegetables is perfect, but don't forget to do that rice. You'll want to have a neutral- ish rice to soak up that chowder, which, I might have mentioned, is the greatest concoction known to humanity. Five forks, hands down.

Outstanding, well worth the time and effort. You can definately do the chowder 1 day ahead. I will repeat this one again for dinner guests.
