Colorful, crunchy, tasty, not to mention full of vitamins! This is my go-to recipe for cole slaw. It's even better made the day before. Roasted nuts are a great addition, as one previous reviewer suggested. Highly recommended!

Oh boy...this was really delicious! I used already shredded slaw mix which had grated carrot already in it. I halved the recipe for the sauce, used 6 cups of the slaw mixture, about a cup of shredded yam,1 red delicious apple, 1/2 green pepper, and 3 green onions, all with good result. Adding maple syrup to the sauce kept everyone guessing where the sweetness came from. I'll be making this again, and again, and again!

Made this for 4th of July with the Memphis ribs, corn on the cob and Soda beans. Everything was a hit. The slaw did not discolor, but I did reduce the cabbages by half.

Very good summer salad -- guests emailed the next day for the recipe! I doubled the amount of apple cider vinegar, subbed red pepper for green, omitted the yam, put in a third apple and used store bought shredded carrots (about 1 cup). Would make again and possibly add yellow raising!

Definitely the best coleslaw! My stepson who doesnt like coleslaw, vows it was the best he ever had  and even asked for seconds

Unbelievable! Everybody raved, and I have never had a better cole slaw. We even put some on the grilled shrimp tacos as a garnish. Definitely use the packaged/pre-chopped cabbage.

I have to say, this is one of the best slaw recipes I've ever made or eaten! But, there seems to be a flaw in the recipe amounts for cabbage. It says the total amount made is around 8 cups, yet the amount of each of the cabbages is 8 cups. I ended up halving each of the cabbages (I shredded just 1/2 a head of each kind) and the vegetable to dressing ratio was perfect!! I also used the shredding disc and grating disc on my food processor (for everything except the green pepper, which I hand sliced) and this was one easy recipe for a hot afternoon! Put some cling wrap real upclose to the mixture in your serving bowl and you won't get any discoloration!

I used packaged slaw mix which saved a lot of time. In spite of measuring I ended up adding additional cabbage and the result was quite bland. This is a GREAT mixture I just didn't think the dressing was anything special. I will make this again because it is so interesting and colorful but I will use a different creamier and more flavorful dressing.

by far the best slaw recipe i've tried. this one has become part of my recipe collection. the flavors blend wonderfully, and it's just as easy to make as any coleslaw recipe around, but w/much greater results.

Fresh and delicious. Have made this tima and again - Just pop all ingredients in the food processor before trimming with a knife. Lots of requests for the recipe. Perfect compliment to ribs & bbq. A word of advice: make sure you measure; too much cabbage makes for a bland slaw.

Turned out very well - no discolouration at all, and was a hit at the family BBQ.

Amazing slaw recipe. My boyfriend and his sister do not like coleslaw and loved this dish. They both questioned the recipe due to the fact it had apples and a yam, something they were not interested in, but it turned out fabulous. And unlike a previous review I had no problems with discoloration in fact it makes so much we kept in in the fridge for quite a few days and it was just as great if not better after a day or so. I would higly recommend this recipe.

This is a great slaw - it gets rave reviews whenever I serve it. To make it easier, I used packaged slaw mix and shredded red cabbage from my grocery's salad bar. To simplify, I omitted the yam and it wasn't missed. Dicing the apples gives it a nice crunch.

I made this sald for a July long weekend BBQ. Everyone raved about it and frinds went and bought the magazine. Would highly recommend this slaw.

This slaw tasted good except that it discolored quickly. The picture in the magazine looked much nicer than the actual slaw did once it was made. Alot of work chopping which wasn't really worth it.
