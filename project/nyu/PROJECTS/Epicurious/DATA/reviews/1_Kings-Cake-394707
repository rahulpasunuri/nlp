This has the potential to be a great cake, once the recipe is corrected! One cup of flour? I used two, but it probably should have been at least three. I tried to mix the dough in a food processor as directed, but with that much liquid to dry, it was a mess! The egg wash amounts have to be wrong too, I used just one egg and still used only half of it. I hope to see this rewritten!
