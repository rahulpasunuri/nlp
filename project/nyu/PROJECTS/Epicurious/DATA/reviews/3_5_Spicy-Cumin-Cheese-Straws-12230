I had no trouble with this recipe made exactly as written. I used Wilton silicone coated parchment paper and had zero sticking problems, even with some leaky cheese. I would rate this very high on flavor (you could do more salt and cumin if you wanted to) but I used Pepperidge Farm puff pastry and found them to have a slightly wierd, greasy mouth feel after eating. I assume there was hydrogenated oil in the pastry and that is why. My guests loved the flavor but noted the same wierd after feel. Next time I will look for a different, higher quality puff pastry and see if that does the trick. Yummy, though!

This is one of my go-to appetizer recipes. It's a little tricky getting all of the cheese sandwiched in there, but it can be done.

Delicious and a great prepare ahead dish

Yummy recipe. Added more cumin and cayenne to dish. Thought sea salt was a bit too salty. But it was a hit. First dish to disappear at cocktail party. However, had some issues: I used too much cheese which created the cheese to melt out of the pastry making the straws appear messy. Finally, biggest problem - getting the straws off the pan. Tried one user's suggestion of using parchment paper - it didn't work nor did greasing the pan. Any suggestions?

Such an easy make ahead snack item for a Holiday Party. I had a number of people ask me "where I bought these" and "what brand were they." The could hardly believe that they were homemade since they both tasted and looked so good. They need to go immediately from the freezer to the oven - if they start to soften they begin to loose their twirl.

I'm sorry but this wasn't that good. After reading the reviews I figured I had the perfect thing for an office potluck. Turns out, I'm heading to the grocery store to buy some cookies. I followed the recipe exactly but these weren't good enough to keep and definately not good enough to share. This is my first negative review on Epicurious but I felt I needed to warn others.

I made these last night. They were easy and impressive. Did not use the cumin seeds because I did not have any. Like the other reviewers, I think you could use any combination of cheeses and herbs. Will definately make again. Delicious!

I measured the cheese by weight, and then was only able to fit half the amount in the puff pastry and still get the two sides to stick together. Regardless, they were the hit of the cocktail party! First item to disappear.

Do yourself a favour and bake the staws on parchment paper (rather than on a greased sheet). Not only does this cut down on fat (not that this recipe is anything near low fat), but the straws come up from the baking sheet with no effort at all. I also found that the straws I baked on parchment were crisper than those I baked on a greased sheet. A bit fussy but I'll repeat, especially to try some of the alternative "fillings" suggested by others.

In a brunch with a lot of really yummy food, this was the big hit and not one straw remained. Didn't change a thing in the recipe and they came out perfectly. No need to ever look for a different cheese straw recipe; this one rules.

I'm not expert on puff pastry and had a little trouble rolling it out but otherwise, this recipe is super fantastic and easy! Used 3 cheeses (parm, sharp cheddar, and jack) cayenne, salt and basil and they turned out delish! sooo good and fun to make!

Great recipe! Next time, though, I will cut the straws smaller.

I chose this recipe for a 4th of July party that I am catering. The key here is to experiment a bit. I made the recipe exactly and then twisted and baked three to see how they would come out. I decided that they weren't flavorful enough, so I sprinkled parm. cheese over the untwisted ones, added a dash more cumin, some garlic powder, and some more cayanne. I buttered one side of the pastry to make it flakier (so people would think I made it) and dashed some more sea salt over the twisted products. Found that you have to grease the cookie sheet, even if you are putting them in the freezer, so that the twists will stay twisted. Also found that just a light twisting makes them come out best. Think I'll serve these with a hot tomato dipping sauce.

Very delicious. They are definitely salty with the coarse salt, but that's not a bad thing, particularly if there are drinks on hand.

This recipe is fabulous! I've made it for years (bridal showers, tea parties, etc.) and have never had a problem. I especially like that the straws can be made ahead of time for a special occasion and then frozen. But...don't forget to grease your baking sheets or they are impossible to remove!

I served this as an appetizer during a bridal shower (followed the recipe exactly), and was very pleased with the results. Cooking time was dead-on. Even guests who weren't fans of "spicy" found these delightful.

Terrific, I make this a lot, nice to keep some in freeze for whenever needed

I made half with cumin on the outside and half without. It made the presentation really pretty. My guests loved them! Would definitely make again and store in freezer for a quick snack for surprise guests.

These taste great, look elegant and are very easy to make. I had a lot of cheese left over, so next time I'll know to decrease the amount. Also, I'll skip the dusting of coarse salt, as they are perfectly salty without it.

YUMMY! YUMMY! YUMMY! Made it for a dinner party and everyone RAVED! Even the picky folks loved 'em.

I've made these many times, and they're always devoured the second they come out of the oven.Great because they freeze really well, so you can make them way in advance. I omit the cumin seed and kosher salt garnish - they're salty enough.

Slightly complicated for the payoff, but still a popular dish at a recent party. I was too sparing with the cheese on the first batch -- don't be afraid to pile it on! Makes a big difference.

I didn't have any trouble twisting these, but I did find that the kosher salt was way too much. Next time I will use regular table salt (sparingly!).

Everyone loves these - yes, a bit fiddly to twist, but well worth it. Delicious, and good things to have on standby in the freeze.

These were tasty and easy to make. I would watch the temperature and time--since all ovens are different and they are easy to burn.

These are great. Not wanting to bother with the twisting and freezing, I shaped mine as palmiers so I could just slice, top with the cumin seeds and bake.

Maybe I used the wrong kind of pastry (phyllo sheets), but these straws were nearly impossible to "twist". The end product was tasty and messy. They weren't eaten as fast as the reviews I read suggested they would- plenty of leftovers.

I've made these three times already, and I plan on making them again for an appetizer party I'm throwing this Christmas. They are easy and delicious ... everyone raves over them. Best when hot out of the oven. mmmmmmm.

Tried this recipe when some friends form New York came for lunch...we all loved theses cheese straws! And they are really easy to make! I then made more and kept them in a plastic container for snacking!

Have had the recipe in my files for some time but made it for the first time for a party last night. What a hit! I made a double recipe just to make sure I had plenty and not one was left! Easy to make and freeze ahead of time, too.
