When I went to make the salad my jicama was spoiled (yikes!) so I quick substituted apples for a similar texture - sort of. It turned out really well although I'm sure the jicama would have been better. I increased the oj and added a bit more balsamic vinegar (+1 tbsp) and the dressing was delicious.

I added a little extra orange juice to the dressing because the soy sauce was a little too dominant. Worked out well. Also, I couldn't find frisee, but the chickory type of endive worked just as well. My guests complimented it without prompting, and even a teenage boy took seconds.
