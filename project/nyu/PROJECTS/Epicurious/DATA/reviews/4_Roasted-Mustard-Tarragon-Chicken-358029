This sauce could make anything taste great, but the chicken itself turned out so crazy good it could stand on it's own! I may never roast a chicken any other way again!

excellent dish, simple, quick and delicious. Instead of mashed potatoes like some recommended, I served new potatoes and a salad. Perfect! I will defintely make this again, next time for a dinner party!

This really is a wonderful and simple method for roasting chicken. I added vegetables as well, everything turned out great. The dijon really makes the gravy something special.

This recipe for a simple roasted chicken might be overlooked a bit on this site, but it's simple and delicious (especially the sauce that it makes). I did substitute chicken broth for the water, and put the roasting pan into the oven as it came to temperature so the bottom of the bird would get a bit of a sear when I put it in. I'll certainly make it again.

Easy & wonderful. Chicken turned out moist & flavorful, gravy was amazing over smashed potatoes with bacon. Highly recommended!

Tasty, easy, delicious...perfect for a weekday meal with no hassle. Roasted veggies and made mashed potatoe. Hubbie raved...but there again he LOVES food. My son, the 'foodie' loved it also...this is now part of my recipe box.
