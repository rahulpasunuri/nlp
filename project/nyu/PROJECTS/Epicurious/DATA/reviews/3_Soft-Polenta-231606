Good creamy soft polenta requires far more than 5 minutes cooking time. Start with 4 parts liquid to 1 part polenta. Bring liquid to a boil. I use 3 parts water to 1 part milk for creamier polenta. Once boiling create a whirling vortex in the pot and pour the polenta in, stirring vigorously with a wisk so things don't get lumpy. Then simmer slowly for THIRTY TO FORTY MINUTES, stirring occasionally and adding more liquid as needed. I add milk or half milk, half water. About 5 minutes before taking it off the stove, add some butter or add some grated parmissan and stir it in. Great stuff! Creamy good.

I would make half of this and add pepper jack cheese and minced garlic to kick up the flavor. I like the idea of baking it in the oven, too.

Why mess with stirring? This is made in the oven and works every time! 2 quarts water, 2 Tbsps butter, 2 tsps salt, 2 Tbsps minced It. parsley (optional),2 cups coarse-ground cornmeal Combine water, salt, cornmeal, parsley and butter in a large oven-proof saucepan or bowl (I use large clear Pyrex bowl). Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 1 hour and 20 minutes. Stir polenta and bake 10 additional minutes. Remove from oven and set aside 5 minutes to rest before serving. Recipe can be cut in half.
