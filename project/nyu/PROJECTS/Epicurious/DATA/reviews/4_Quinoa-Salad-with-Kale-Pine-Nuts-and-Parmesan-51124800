I made this with a number of changes. First, I happened to buy kale and chard at the farmer's market before I decided to make this so I used them both. Second, I used pearl couscous instead of quinoa because I had it. Third, I used chicken stock instead of water. My take on this - it's really good the way I made it, but I would use twice the greens at least, they cooked down to almost nothing. I would definitely cut back on the dressing, in fact I did, it makes far too much unless you are making something else the next day. Next time I will try it with quinoa and more greens.

Delicious! We used spinach instead of kale, and pistachios instead of pine nuts. It lasted 3 meals for 2 people, so we were able to try it at a variety of temperatures. Like the others we preferred it warm. We will definitely make this again.

I served this only slightly cooled and it was still good, though I'm looking forward to trying the leftovers cold this evening. Love that it was so easy to make, only had to chop onion as I bought the kale pre-chopped. Will definitely make again. My kids liked it, too, which is a huge plus.

I made this forgetting that it needed to chill for 2 hours. We ate it slightly warm instead and it was good that way. Looking forward to trying after being chilled. I also realized too late into the cooking that I did not have Dijon mustard but only Spicy Brown Trader Joe's Mustard. Substituted that and it was still tasty! My children didn't like it because of the spicy brown mustard tastenext time I make it I wonder if they'll prefer the milder Dijon taste it might offer.
