I'm not sure what the fuss is all about. I've never made brittle before, but I followed the recipe exactly after reading the reviews and it turned out great! Just remember to tilt the pan when pouring at the same time because it will not move if it cools even slightly.

five tries! the last time I lowered the heat to 3 1/2 where I had been on 4. It took a lot longer. I also swirled the pan most all of the time it was on the burner. It says don't stir but once it turned to sugar I continuously moved the sugar like you do for aunt bills until it melted. It didn't thin out as much as when I cooked on 4, but it is not burned and can be used to finish the recipe, unlike all of my previous tries! Then I will know if it was worth it.

First x I didn't follow directions and added nuts at 300 degrees, wherein it turned to sugar. 2nd try I did same but continued cooking sugar & nuts till melted, but was burnt by the x it melted. 3rd try watched mix turn to sugar and continued cooking till melted before adding nuts. Says don't stir but I think you must have to break up sugar while melting to get it done before burning. Temp of mix was 360 degrees before all melted. This x mix burned but nuts not. Off for 4th try.

This recipe was a disaster for me, too. Tried three times (I also laugh in the face of certain defeat) but could not make it work. Off to try the Microwave Peanut Brittle...

Found a recipe for Microwave Peanut Brittle on this site. After the two messes I made following this recipe, I figured how bad can it be? Subbed 2 oz walnuts for the peanuts and 10 minutes later and voila - walnut brittle! Not the beautiful, clear, caramel glass stuff in the magazine but it tastes great and I think will be a hit.

I've made similar things before without a problem, but for some reason I could not make this work! Tried twice, and my husband tried 3 times (he does not like to be defeated!) but it would not set up correctly.
