I didn't have buckwheat groats so I used bulgur. (If using bulgur, skip the egg and stir frying...). I added celery per recommendation of another reviewer. Super tasty and due to the porcini mushrooms, very, I don't know how else to say it, but, "deep." Give this a whirl for sure.

I don't understand the negative reviews, this is a wonderful recipe. We even used plain button mushrooms with the porcini and it was great. This is a perfect risotto alternative - it's a pilaf, so it's not meant to be highly spiced. The whole family loved it and we'll definitely make it again.

I cooked the mushrooms and onions with coconut oil. Also, try with some herbs, I added some thyme, turned out great.

Creamy Buckwheat cereal can be used. At the end though, when you add the mushroom water and broth, it will cook pretty fast 5-10 minutes, depends on the heat. I did not have to add any more liquid it was cooked.

This was very uninspiring. It was dull and lifeless. It was very bland I nothing I did to bring life into it was successful.

This was pretty good, though I think it could have used more garlic and some celery to boost the flavor (the way my grandmother used to make it). The cooking method was very good, so you'd get good results if you choose to make it following this recipe. The leftovers are great reheated and topped with a fried egg!

Made this. Have never had Kasha, so really did not know what to expect. Probably will not make Kasha again if this was the result. Probably great with something like a roast chicken, but by itself, extremely bland. And I really like mushroom anything. I have to modify view of "mushroom anything" from now on.

made this today and it was fabulous. used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added 2 extra cloves of garlic. didn't have vegetable broth so used low fat low sodium chicken broth. Tastes like a great stuffing...but no bread. wonderful
