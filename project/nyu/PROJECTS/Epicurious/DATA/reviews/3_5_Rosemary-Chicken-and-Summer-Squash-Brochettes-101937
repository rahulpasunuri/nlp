Couldn't find pattypan, so used a mix of green & yellow summer squash, skewered through the skin. Also added sweet red pepper as others suggested and some quartered purple onions, and upped the dressing amounts a bit to compensate. Served w/ baked potatoes, which went really nicely, though I understand the rice impulse.

For the brief prep time, the return on investment is fantastic. The grated lemon peel shouldn't be omitted! I would also miss the slight smokiness of the barbecue. I was surprised the marinade had no heat; I added a dash of Tabasco. This could become a weeknight staple while summer squash is in the garden.

This really exceeded my expectations, and was so easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly (but wound up marinating for about an hour) and the result was fantastic. Even my picky boyfriend, who was weary of squash, cleaned his plate. This is definitely going into my rotation.

Easy to make and turned out well. We marinated the meat and squash for about 3 hours, and I think that helped build the flavor. I would definately do it again.

I just made this for my husband and me. I made it indoors on a grilling pan, and cut the chicken into smaller pieces because we had miniture pattypan squashes. I used fresh rosemary, lemon, and garlic. We liked how easy and fast it was, and it tasted good with a spinach salad on the side, but next time we will use regular yellow (crookneck) squash I think. The pattypan squash was a little bitter for us. I also think that next time I would follow previous reviewers' suggestions to either add red bell pepper slices or cherry tomatoes between for flavor and presentation.

This is a great recipe! Be careful to use summer squash if you're doing skewers with chicken, since winter squash takes longer to cook. I have adapted this recipe for potatoes, winter squash (auyama here in Venezuela), and it's absolutely wonderful - it brings out the best of all the ingredients, the olive oil, lemon, and rosemary. It's excellent!!!

This was a quick and easy recipe for a weeknight meal. I cooked the chicken breasts whole on a grill pan rather than skewering them in chunks. Came out great, especially when paired with the goat cheese mashed potatoes (also on Epicurious).

This is too tasty! I did not cut up the chicken. Actually, skewered the squash, added zucchini and cherry tomatoes. In a cabbage leaf or lettuce, I also served roasted garlic couscous with a sprig of fresh mint. Lovely!!!! Actually, I think I do that for tonight's company. THis is so easy to do it is one of my favorite weeknight receipes.

Delicious, fast and simple. I used an herb blend when I discovered I was out of rosemary. Definitely worth it. I agree with the previous reviewer who said it needs some color in the presentation. Red pepper would be good.

This was so simple and easy, my boyfriend and I threw it on a bed of greens with a lemon vinagrette. He raved and raved... a keeper for sure.

The next time, I will add some COLOR to this dish via the use of red bell peppers, as it was visually boring (escpecially when served with rice). Other than that, it certainly is a quick and easy dish to make with a good taste.

I was suprised at how very flavorful this was with only a short space of time marinading. I was delicious! Definitely a keeper.

Very nice summer dish...I liked the lemon, too.

Very yummy!! I added balsamic vinegar to the marinade, but what made it so special was the lemon zest and juice. I don't know what that squash is, so I just used regular green summer squash. Here in Israel, I don't know the proper names for fancy squashes.
