I am not sure about the quiche, I am sure it is good, but the short crust pastry recipe is superb. I use it all the time and it always comes out great. I can't stand Crisco or other transfatty vegetable pseudo fats, its butter all the way for me.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I thought it was a lot of work sauteing all those recipes. I also think there is too much liquid for 3 eggs. I cooked the quiche for twice the length of time called for and still had a runny custard. I may try this again, but with 6 eggs or less milk.

As they weren't specific with this one, I decided to go with Chrysanthemums for the 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flower. My thinking was: you can use them on Mothers Day, on a date, or if just feeling winsome on a rainy day. That's pretty all-purpose in my book. I might try sunflowers or roses next time. Mmm-mmm!

I wonder if it would be ok to make this using "flour" instead of "flower"? Don't have any botanicals handy...

To be honest, I only made the actual quiche and didn't bother with the rest of it. I was impressed at how perfectly timed the entire quiche was and how it yielded a very fresh tasting quiche. I also omitted the artichoke hearts because I didn't have any on hand. For a good tasting quiche, with good simple ingredients, I highly suggest giving this one a go.

Great mix of flavors. I did have some difficulty with the recipe. Too much milk with the eggs plus the mushrooms and the zucchini release water when cooking. The quiche didn's set well. I would cut down the zucchini so the egg mixture and vegies would set well. Plus I used good quality canned tuna, Oregon's Choice, with capers and lemon juice. It was really great!

I was the Queens Chef for 12 years, never made this once !!!!!!!!! Wish you wouldn't put things like that without checking them out first. To a cook from Chicago........ you should have said. I would have given yo uthe real recipe and made "the dream " really come true. :)

To Royalchef, this recipe is derived from a dream, not from a royal kitchen. A funny story - read below: A Taste of My Family, Karen Palmer, editor. This jolly family scrapbook includes "Queen Elizabeth's Favorite Quiche," contributed by Marilyn Olsen. No ingredient list or directions are given, just a description of a dream Ms. Olsen had in which she visited the Queen and stayed for lunch. The royal hostess served an oh-so-tender quiche with a hint of bacon flavor and an array of exotic vegetables, garnished with tuna-filled tomatoes.This seemed a challenge too good to pass up, and we recruited the Epicurious recipe tester to turn dream to reality.

To the cook in Manchester. I lived and cooked in England for a few years...you should have seen me noodling on those grams. I became pretty proficient when I realized that you have to go with the native system and buy a scale. I even became familiar with that dark side of my Pyrex measuring cups...the metric side. Here's my advice: Go to Sainsbury's and look in the cooking gadget aisle, you'll most likely find American style measuring cups and spoons. Bon chance!
