I have made this at least 10 times. It is excellent. I was surprised by some of the reviews. You can adjust the spicyness based on the type and quantity of chile powder used, but don't leave it out. The shallots add a lot to the dish also. This tastes better and is a lot more interesting than the typical glazed carrots made with brown sugaar. To the reviewer that burnt the syrup, anything burnt is not going to taste good. Sugars burn easily, but the red wine/cider should have prevented that if you cooked it with the lid on as directed for most of the recipe.

I made this dish for a dinner party, and received rave reviews. It was really easy to make, spicy, and delicious. I would definitely recommend it and make it again.

This was less than awesome... it took a long time to make, and the flavours just didn't mix well. The whole thing looked burnt and tasted too much like caramelized maple syrup. I'm still on the lookout for a good recipe for glazed carrots... this is NOT it.

My husband was cooking me dinner for my birthday, and he put the entire menu together from Epicurious (as he said, he learned from the best)! These carrots were fabulous - great combination of flavors with the chili powder (we used cayenne) and the touch of fresh dill at the end. You have to be open to something different, but if you are, these deliver!

I served this to my husband and two kids and I was the only one who ate it. The red wine turned the carrots a dark red color and perhaps that made it look unappetizing. Also, I didn't add the chili powder or the fresh dill because the kids don't like those flavors, and maybe that had something to do with it too. However, this dish was easy to make and I thought it was good. I'd like to read others' reviews before I make it again.
