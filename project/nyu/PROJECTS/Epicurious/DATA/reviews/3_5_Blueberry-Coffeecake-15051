Loved it...especially that I had everything on hand and that it was so easy. Took the advice of others and added more blueberries to the batter. Think it made a big difference. My husband and son loved it. Will be making this one again...:)

This is a super fast and easy recipe. I added some sour cream to the batter and it turned out great. Next time I will add a little vanilla to the batter also.

I really liked the texture of the cake but I was a little confused as to why the blueberries were only put on top instead of folded in...I thought, incorrectly, that they would sink in. The recipe should clearly state that they just sit on top. Next time I will fold them in because the cake is kind of bland.

This cake was delicious and easy. I think the reason some people thought the batter was too thick is because they didn't sift the flour BEFORE they measured it. My batter did pour into the pan very easily. I also added 1t. vanilla ext.

Wicked easy and wicked tasty. Used frozen blueberries and kept the rest exactly as is. Needed about 10 more minutes baking time than indicated. Otherwise, this is the perfect last minute breakfast treat.

Great recipe and very easy to make. I followed the original recipe, the batter was thick but it came out fluffy and yummy. I did not add walnut because of tree nut allergy in the family, substituted rice crispies instead. Will use this recipe again.

This is delicious and so easy to prepare. I added half a cup of raspberries with the blueberries and half teaspoon vanilla to the cake mixture. This is foolproof and everything is in my cupboard minus the fresh fruit. Dust with icing sugar and serve with whipped cream for a casual dinner party dessert. Yum

Great coffeecake. I added a extra 1/4c of milk. Batter was a little thick. I also added 1/2 tsp of lemon oil to the blueberry and batter. I will make this recipe again

No one mentioned that this cake didn't rise, so either I did something very wrong or doubling the batter is necessary. I used a 7x9 glass and had to bake for 35+ min. as interior was not set at 35 but topping and bottom was "burntish". Used Buttermilk powder and didn't fold berries into batter. I see the potential, but didn't have the results of others. Any thought for my improvement?

This is now my favorite blueberry coffee cake. I tweaked it based on other reviews and my own preferences. Added 3/4 C berries to the batter, used half white whole wheat flour, decreased the sugar to 1/2 C and added an extra 1T milk. Easy, healthy and delicious. What more could you ask for?

Rating: 4
Very good. For the cake, I used buttermilk instead of milk, added juice from 1/2 a lemon, few vanilla drops, and frozen blueberries. For the topping, I doubled everything except the cinnamon and added nutmeg. Baked in an 8x8 dish, took about 45- 50 minutes. My cake batter had a thick doughy consistency. In no way was it pourable, but the end result was fabulous.

I made this using Marf's variations, made 1 1/2 times the topping, added the blueberries to the cake and extra on top. Moist, flavorful, delicious! I think the buttermilk and the extra spices in the topping are key.

this worked out great - it was a totally impromptu midnight snack for my flatmates and i using stuff we already had in the cupboard. really yummy and moist. i folded the berries in and just sprinkled plain brown sug on top (as didn't have butter or nuts) it worked out great! very american coffee cake - mighty fine!

Yum! This cake is awesome. I made 1 1/2 of the recipe and put it in a standard bunt pan, I think it is just the right amount of cake for the pan, any less and we would have been disapointed. I also used buttermilk and added about 2 tsp of grated lemon peel. I think the lemon rind was key.

Rating: 2
Pretty good. I made this with buttermilk & the other changes as suggested by Marf, including mixing most of the berries into the batter as well as putting more on top. That said, I am not much of a blueberry fan (but my husband is) so I couldn't give 3 forks, but if you like them a lot then this is a simple, foolproof, quick and tasty coffeecake.

My husband is on his second helping and asking for a third. Need I say more? I did double the recipe also and was trying to make it a bit healthier so I halved flour with wheat/white and also used 3/4 cup sugar and 3/4 cup applesauce. Also used a few blueberries in the batter just for kicks. It rocked! Very good and not too heavy. Could be eaten for breakfast with some fruit on the side or as a dessert w/ice cream. Will definitely make again!!

I agree with all the positive comments. I trippled the recipe and baked it in 2 9x13" glass dishes for a large group of friends (about 35 people at a meeting/social break). I received nothing but compliments. I made the following modifications: for the Topping, I added non-instand oatmeal. Also reduced the cinnamon by 1/2 as recommended by several readers, and added 1/4 teaspoon of fresh ground nutmeg. I think next time I will not include the oatmeal. Also - commercial walnut pieces need to be broken even smaller. For the cake, I substituted buttermilk and added the necessary baking soda. Mace and lemon zest plus a pinch of ground cloves make a very nice addition. I also used my counter top Kitcen Aid mixer for the batter. It still was "stiff," but do not worry, the cake baked as light as a feather.

I have made this recipe multiple times. It is a solid coffeecake recipe that never fails. Smaller blueberries usually work better. If you are short on time, this is perfect to bring to a potluck or party.

Rating: 3
Deceptively good recipe - quick and easy to make with truly delicious results. I (uncharacteristically) made this one without looking at the comments first - my only substitution was pecans for the walnuts and it turned out very well, despite the sticky bake batter. Next time I will use buttermilk instead of regular milk, use my KitchenAid mixer instead of just stirring the cake batter, and I'll add a touch of ground ginger to the cake. I don't think it needs double the streusel or blueberries - I thought the proportions were just right. I'm planning to make this one again very soon!

This was one of the first deserts to go from the recent gathering I attended. I love that it's so easy to make. I used the suggestions noted below, increasing the topping and blueberries. I made a double batch, and to that, I also added about a teaspoon of grated lemon peel to the cake batter - excellent addition, I think. Next time, I will also cut back on the cinnamon by one half. I agree that it's a bit overpowering in the amount given in the recipe.

I made a few modifications to this recipe that gave it over-the-top flavor. Replace milk with buttermilk for tenderness. To the flour mixture, I added 1/2 tsp baking soda, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp ginger, pinch cloves. I folded frozen blueberries into the batter instead of just putting them on top of the batter. Finally 1 cup old fashioned oatmeal was added to the topping. Serve warm. Oh yum!

Really delicious, it was eaten right up. Non-fat yogurt was good in it, gave it a more tart taste. Also used peaches and blueberries together and increases the streusel as suggested.

You have to try this recipe! After a bumper crop of blueberries from my Dad's bushes, I had to make something to go with our Sunday dinner. This is the perfect dessert to make if you aren't into real sweet desserts. I made this recipe as stated, just increased the amount of blueberries and I had no problems at all with it. To mix the batch I use a KitchenAid tabletop mixer, so that way it was pourable and not thick and doughy as some has stated. I also put the batter in a greased 11x7 glass baking pan, instead of 9" square. It was the perfect amount for 8 generous servings! This batter would also go great if using cherries, peaches or rasberries! Canned, frozen or fresh! Thank you for a delightful recipe. Easy and scrumptious!

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe and so easy! I used fresh blueberries and used lowfat yogurt instead of milk. Laying the blueberries over the batter instead of blending them in (as in muffin recipes) is a must - it allows the berries to melt in and bubble with the delicious topping. I increased the topping by about half which was the perfect amount and used a combination of pecans and almonds (which is what I had on hand). I have only made it once but I think this recipe will become one of my staples!

It has become the number one breakfast demand at my home! I experimented a little bit by adding a dash of vanilla into the batter.

After seeing how much batter this recipe makes, I decided to double it and baked it in a 13 X 9 inch pan, for about 40 minutes, although I think 35 would have done it, since it was a little crisp around the edges. Quicker than most blueberry recipes I have and very yummy.

Rating: 4
This was a great coffeecake. Moist and delicious, even a day or two after cooking. I made a couple of changes that may have affected the outcome. First, I substituted cake flour for all-purpose flour, resulting in a less dense batter and finished product. Also, I used frozen fresh blueberries and cooked the cake for about five minutes longer than suggested. The result was fabulous - friends and family loved it!

Very easy to make and delicious.

Admittedly, I am not a baker, but this receipe looked easy enough for even me. However, when I made the batter the first time, it looked more like cookie dough, and definitly could not be "poured" into a pan. I thought I had made a mistake, and tried again. Same result. It turned out far too dense, and the edges burned by the time the middle was done. Flavor was not so bad, but you better have plenty of milk on hand to wash it down.

great recipe. so easy, not too sweet as the other reader's stated. good idea to add more topping. after making the topping, i added another half (from the topping) as you do need more to cover the cake.

I follwed the recipe exactly except for substituting almonds for the walnuts. The part that was fully baked was very tasty, but I also had trouble with the middle being underbaked. I used a convection oven and turned down the temp by 25 degrees, as is standard for all recipes using convection. Baked it an additional 10 min., but still sank in the middle. Wonder if it was calibrated for convection to begin with? Or is the baking time a misprint? If I make it again I'll keep the temp as written and see if I have better luck.

I made this for my staff and they raved. Everyone got a chuckle out of which "flower" to use

Very easy to make. I also used 1 cup (frozen) blueberries (did not defrost, just plopped them right from the freezer) and did need to increase bake time to nearly 50 minutes (carefully watched the last 15 mintes and lightly covered with foil to prevent scorching). I am at 5200 feet, however, so minor adjustments in the dry ingredients were made as well. This is quite good but best, in our opinion, the first day, shortly after cooling down.

I also replaced the oil with apple sauce and halved the sugar. I doubled the blueberries and topped it with cinnamon and sprinkled some brown sugar. It was a perfect, light, midweek dessert (and breakfast today!).

I made this today to take over to my parent's house for dessert and if I have enough time, I'll make it again to take to work tomorrow. It was quite simple to make, yet quite tasty. I used approx double the blueberries and double the nuts (I estimated rather than measuring). I had to cook it longer than the recipe called for (probably about 15 extra minutes). That could possibly be because of the extra moisture from the blueberries (I used frozen).

Rating: 4
I didn't exactly follow the recipe, but the results were great. Instead of oil I used applesauce, adding a little extra for moisture, and ended up with a cake that was much like spongecake! Not really coffee cake, but delicious. Also, I cut the nuts in half and used already toasted ones instead, giving the cake even more flavor, and added fresh ground nutmeg to the topping. Delicious!!!

A fine, easy recipe -- which I liked even more when I used 1/2 scant cup of whole milk yogurt instead of milk. Also, crushed toasted almonds (1/3 cup) are a nice substitution instead of walnuts. I followed the good advice offered, too, of adding more fruit and cutting down on the sugar: 1 1/2 cup fresh blueberries and 1/2 cup sugar. Delicious.

Rating: 3
This is a fantastic, nearly guilt-free recipe. I don't know if everyone else secretly doubled the batter, but I had barely enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Couldn't even think of layering batter and blueberry mixture. But I did nearly double the topping for extra happiness. I make this every few weeks for brunches and getting my coworkers to like me.

This is my new favorite use for blueberries. I did take advice given below and spread half the batter, sprinkled half the berries, and put the rest of the batter on top, topping that with the other half of the berries, then the cinnamon topping. Yummy! I also like that it doesn't make a huge amount, otherwise, I'd eat too much of it!!

Overall, it was very good. I put extra cinnamon and walnuts on the top of the cake. I also substituted 3/4 teaspoon baking soda, instead of baking powder. This make's it rise a little more, and I think that it's better.

Overall a very good coffeecake. I followed previous suggestions and layered half the blueberries into the batter and half on top, and I used a 7x9 pan (perfect size -- takes about 35 minutes to cook). I also doubled the topping mixture (a must!). Next time, I will use a lot more blueberries (about 1 and 1/4 cups).

I didn't particularly care for the coffeecake. I thought it was rather blah tasting. My husband thought the cinnamon topping overpowered the blueberries (he couldn't taste the blueberries). I used freshly picked ones blueberries too. I would not make it again.

This is the best coffeecake I've ever made. I did it in a bundt cake pan and layered the cinnamon nut mixture, blueberries and batter twice.

I followed advice of some of the previous cooks and made some changes of my own. At the recommendation of others, I cut down on the sugar, using a slightly generous half cup in the cake. I used a 7x9x2inch pan and it was the perfect size. I don't see how a larger pan could be used. I spread (thanks for tip from the Hauppauge cook) half the batter, distributed the blueberries, then spread the remaining batter over the blueberries. I was slightly generous with all the topping ingredients and substituted pecans for walnuts. This was a real hit at work -someone else brought a coffee cake inthe same day. This one was completely gone and only one piece out of the other. Quick, easy preparation, too. Can't beat that combination.

First of all I just want to say the cake was delicious, but I wanted to let any future chefs know a few bits of advice.....I found this recipe to be a little off. The consistency of the batter is not pourable into the pan. When they say pour, do not be suprised when you have to spread it into the pan. I almost threw it out thinking I messed up. Dont throw out. It will be fine. I was also unhappy with the crumb mixture. After mixing it, I found it to be very little to spread over the entire cake. I would definately make this cake again, yet I would make my own crumb mixture. Do not let this discourage you. The cake was very good, just change the crumb portion.
