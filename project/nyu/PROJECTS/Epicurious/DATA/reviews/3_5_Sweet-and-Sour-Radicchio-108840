I don't know where I went wrong with this recipe but I made it for Thanksgiving and it was so horrible I had to throw the entire batch out. I was so disappointed because it would have been so beautiful on the table. I would not recommend this dish to anyone. It was so sour that no amount of sugar or raisins could penetrate the offensive flavor.

My father-in-law loves this recipe. He grows the radicchio and I cook it for him. The whole family loves this dish.
