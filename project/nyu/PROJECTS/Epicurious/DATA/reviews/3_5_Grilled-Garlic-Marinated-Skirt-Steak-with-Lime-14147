I doubled the recipe and changed things up a bit: I chopped the garlic in a food processor, then added the lime, salt, and olive oil. Additionally I added a good handful of chopped cilantro. I then marinated skirt steak, organic chicken breasts, and a swordfish steak for about four hours. The chicken was amazing, the brightness of the lime came through, but wasn't overpowering - I had used a little extra lime. The swordfish was also quite good - originally I had planned to use sea scallops and think that would be even better. Unfortunately, I thought the steak was just OK. (I will try to follow the recipe if I do it again.) The steak was tender, but not as flavorful as I had hoped. The steak definitely needed an extra spritz of lime at the end, as the lime flavor got lost in the grilling. I'm giving the recipe four forks because I can't wait to have the leftover chicken for lunch.

This marinade is so awesome for its flavor and simplicity! I've even used it to marinade rib-eye steaks with fantastic, flavorful results. When I use it for fajitas, I add a teaspoon of ground cumin to the marinade...wonderful! Oh, and don't forget the Rajas Con Crema...they are wonderful...even make them to top the rib-eye steak! Pure heaven!

Great for flavor and simplicity. Usually have to substitute flank steak as most groceries don't carry skirt steak which gives an even more authentic flavor and texture. The real find however was the Rajas con Crema - great with the steak or with grilled chicken and as an ingredient for a "Mexican" casserole with past and chicken and cheese.

I deviated. I marinated 1 lb. of skirt steak in 3 tbsp oil, 3 tbsp lime juice, 1 tbsp inced garlic, 1/2 tsp coarse salt for six hours, then grilled it. This was terrific with rajas con crema (from this web site) and pico de gallo.

Good with carne asada tacos. I used Anaheim chiles from my garden, and substituted a mixture of Greek yogurt and cream for the Mexican crema. I think this would be great with chicken in enchiladas.

Easy to make, also made the accompaniments that went with the dish. So easy that I would make it again if I thought about it a day in advance.

My neighbors came over to see what the heck smelled so good and ended up cleaning us out of all 3 pounds. Added cilantro to the marinade, let it sit for 24 hours. Hot grill, cook fast, delicious!

A definite keeper! My kids loved it! I served the skirt steak with warm tortillas, Rajas con Crema, fresh chopped cilantro, fresh tomato salsa and spanish rice. I also cut the recipe to serve 4. Love it!

This is one of my favorite dishes. Here in the desert it's better known as Carne Asada. We marinate the steak in lime, garlic, and cilantro over night, then grill it fast over a hot mesquite pit the next day. For three pounds of skirt steak you had better use one lime - rolled until it's softened, a dozen large cloves of garlic - crushed and diced, and about one quarter cup of chopped cilantro leaves. Eat with Pico Pica or Pico de Gallo sauce, not a vinegar based pepper sauce.

This was excellent. I love skirt steaks. Another marinade I love is 1/3 olive oil, 1/3 red wine vinegar, 1/3 soy sauce and lots of garlic.

I loved this recipie, it was so easy. I got the steak on sale, the butcher trimmed it, cut it and put it though a tenderizing machine. After I grilled it, it wasn't tough at all. If you plan to make tacos out of these, I suggest adding some additional spices. It's great as it is but in a taco could use extra zip and saltiness.

This is easy and delicious. I have made it three times already, and it has turned out great each time. I started adding lime juice to the marinade, and it turns out wonderful. A great summertime dish - perfect for casual entertaining outdoors - although, I'll make it year-round. Excellent with ripe avocado and fresh salsa. If you like tacos al carbon, you'll love this recipe.

This was really delicious. I gave it 4 forks because it was also so easy to make. I had bought a flap steak from Costco the other day thinking it was a skirt steak and decided I'd try using this recipe with the meat. I grilled the meat for about 8 minutes total on the barbecue and it came out extremely juicy and very flavorful. The lime juice really gave it a boost of flavor. I will most definitely make this again. This would be great party food!

Excellent! I added even more garlic (sliced) to really emphasize that flavor. I also used a whole fresh lime for marinating as well.

This was so easy and so good! I made it as writen except we cut the recipe down for only two people and I had to use flank steak rather than skirt steak because it is all the butcher had. Drizzeling the lime over the cooked steaks realy makes the dish! I served it in homemade flat bread wraps with queso blanco cheese. Yum!

Super good! I added a little lime juice in the marinade and served it with "party salsa" from this site, guacamole, and sour cream. This is going to be a summer standard.

This was a very good quick dinner. While it was marinating, I made a mango salsa (from a salmon recipe here) that went very well with it.

This was very good. I used chicken breast instead of steak, grilled it, then sliced it up for tacos. Great with the fresh tomato salsa!

I used supermarket skirt steak and marinated it overnight. By following the grilling instructions in this recipe, the steak result was perfect. This was great for tacos.

This is an easy recipe and the salsa is great. Not sure I would heat the tortillas in the oven next time.

I have made this dish several times as part of the taco menu in the July 1997 Gourmet. All the recipes are great, including this one. Very simple yet flavorful, this is always a hit at parties. Tastes best when you can find fresh corn tortillas to serve with.

This was so good that my 4 year old said it was the best tortillas and meat she has ever had in her life, (ha,ha) she had 3 servings. My husband and I enjoyed it as well. We added to the marinade some cumin and when we served the meat we added some fresh cilantro...this is a keeper! Enjoy!

This was a very good marinade; I couldn't find skirt steaks locally, but carne asada made a very good substitution.

my family is full of picky eaters and they just raved on how good this was. My son also wanted me to cook it again the next day.
