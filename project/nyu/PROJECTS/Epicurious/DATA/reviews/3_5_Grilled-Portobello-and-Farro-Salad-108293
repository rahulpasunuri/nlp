Farro and spelt are different! I used spelt and it took 45 minutes and used only 2.5 cups of water. Instead of using portobellos I grilled brown mushrooms and zuchinni on the bbq and then sliced into thick slices and tossed with the spelt once cooked and cooled. I also followed others instruction and used only half the oil. It is a super salad and will make again.

Just a quick comment, Spelt and Farro are not the same grain, and cook very differently- Farro cooks much more quickly. That said, this recipe would be great with either one.

Wonderful! I did make it slightly differently, but I'm sure it would be really good the "original" way too. I couldn't find spelt or farro in my grocery, and I had to get something to use so we could have it for dinner that night. I picked cracked wheat. It may be very different from spelt, I've never had spelt, but the cracked wheat still made an extremely tasty dish. I also couldn't find currants, so I just used dark raisins. Accidentally I didn't put the oil in, and I don't think that would hurt it to add it next time. We had more than we needed for dinner with the 'bellas, and it was still quite tasty the next day on its own for lunch. I'd certainly make it again!

Excellent! First time I used and ate farro/spelt, and I loved it! The sweetness of spelt and combination of ingredients makes this a yummy recipe!

Instead of serving on a portobello, I used baby bellas that were sliced and mixed it all in there. Added some zucchini because there was a large influx of summer squash.

Ok, I'm just about to make this salad, just read the reviews and just have to point out that if you ask for smelt in the health food store instead of spelt as the cook from Bethlehem suggested you are going to get fish. I'm guessing that would be a one fork experience at best...

This recipe was very good - though even after cutting the oil in half, it was still way too oily! 12 TBL for 4 servings?!! I would have thought it was a mis-print except there are the separate references to 7 and 5 TBL as well. Funnily enough, virtually the same recipe was on the box of spelt I'd bought at Trader Joe's - also using 12 TBL of olive oil! I used 3.5 in the salad and 2.5 on the mushrooms, and I would cut the salad amount down to at most 2 T next time. Can't imagine what it would be like with the whole 12! The oiliness tended to dominate, but there were still some good flavors. I will try it again with less oil, I think it has potential.

This is just so good-- the perfect vegetarian salad

This was a very flavorful and different salad. I had some difficulty finding farro (sold in health food stores as smelt), but I'm glad I did. I served it as part of vegetarian meal beginning with the cold morrocan tomato soup. The farro salad is also good served as a side dish the next night.
