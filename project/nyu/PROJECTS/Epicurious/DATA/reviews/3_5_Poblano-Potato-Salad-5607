Not a great recipe. Although we love all the ingredients individually, the end result is bland and unexciting. It was so underwhelming that I had to doctor it up substantially just to be able to bring it to a friends house. Even with my improvements it was only OK.

A great recipe we've been enjoying for years. I recently substituted non-fat Greek yogurt for half of the sour cream to lighten it up, with good results. This is an excellent tounge-cooling side dish to the chili-crusted tuna tacos (on this site).

Wonderful! I added a full teaspoon of salt, used no-fat sour cream with 1 tablespoon of mayonaise, and reduced green onions to 1/2 cup. I agree with another reviewer that the tomatillos add a lot of tartness, so definitely do not be tempted to increase them. This recipe will go into my "keeper" file.

This is a great summer dish. I agree it needs more salt, and I add more chiles and tomatillos. I also like to kick it up with some cayenne.

I used more herb and spice(to taste)than the recipe.

Loved this, but add salt.

I think this has potential but needs something. I followed the recipe exactly, even weighing the potatoes and poblanos. It was too dry. I think next time I will increase the dressing and add some other spices like cardamom. It absolutely needed salt for my taste. I will give it one more chance.

My family loves just about everything but this salad was not great nor well liked. I think between the lime juice and the tomatillos it was too tart, and the amount of green onions could have been reduced. Unfortunately, the poblanos got lost in this recipe and added no flavor. This will not be a recipe I'll be saving.

This is a nice dish to take to cookouts. I was in a hurry and substituted a good green salsa (I used Montezuma but fresh would have been even better) and a can of green chiles for the poblanos, tomatillos, onions and cilantro in this recipe and it was still tasty.

This has become my families favorite potato salad. I make it with non-fat sour cream to eliminate the fat. It's easy to make and everyone loves it.
