One fork should be for YUK! I made this last night for my husband and I and we both thought it was blah, blah, blah!! With all the great ingredients how could it not be great? it just wasn't. The only flavor/texture that came through was the custard - 1 1/2 cups liquid and 3 eggs, too much maybe?

I loved the cornmeal in the crust!

This was very cheesy and good, but I could not taste the bacon. Next time I will add some diced green chilies and serve the bacon on the side.

This is an easy to make dish for a busy midweek dinner. I used frozen pie pastry instead of making my own. That cuts down on the overall time to make. Yummy dinner!

This was flat for me. I used fresh eggs and bacon from the farmers market and felt as i wasted great ingredients on this pie.

I found this recipe while vacationing. I used premade crust and it was excellent! There was so much filling that I had to use both crusts, so I would suggest half the recipe for less servings. The leftovers were great though!

This is an especially wonderful recipe. I liked that it has much less cream and more vegetables than a typical quiche. Next time I make it, I'm gonig to use my food processor for the crust.

I used a premade crust which makes this recipe so much simpler! I placed it in a smaller dish, (I am cooking for two!) and halved the recipe except for the thyme. I used 1 3/4c. corn and two eggs. Also I used peppered turkey bacon. Easy and delicious.

I loved this so much I tweaked it a bit for health reasons, since I knew I'd be making it quite often! I omitted the shortening and water in the crust and replaced it with about a quarter cup yogurt (enough for the dough to come together.) And I added about a tablespoon sugar, I like anything with cornmeal a bit sweeter. The corn/bacon filling was a big hit, and I tried it a second time with chorizo sausage, onion, and peppers ... next I'm thinking ham and brie, then apple sausage and onion ...

What a pain for a mediocore dish. The crust was too dry, the size of pan recommended was too small, couldn't taste the cheese or the bacon....

An awesome bake! Would definitely make again!

Excellent recipe. However, if you do not use a deep pie dish, you will have tons more filling than will fit in a standard pie plate. Next time, I'll add some chili peppers, change the cheese to pepperjack, and swap cilantro for thyme. Super brunch dish.

This recipe was a disappointment and I will not make it again. It called for way too much thyme, maybe a 1/4 teaspoon would have been better, was on the dry side, and the bacon was overwhelmed by all the other flavors and we really couldn't taste it.

This was my first attempt at quiche, and I was serving it to guests. So I was a bit nervous about it, but in the end, everyone had seconds! I will definitely make this again. The flavor was great. My only negative comment is that the ingredients were overflowing out of the dish when I first put it in the oven. I might cut back slightly on the cheese and corn next time.

This was good, though nothing to rave about. It was a basic corn quiche, not amazing. I liked the cornmeal crust twist. I would occasionally make again, but not put it on the list of must haves.

This was great! I didn't have any problem with it falling apart. Here are my changes: 7 Tbsp butter, (omitted the vegetable shortening), 1 1/2 cups of corn instead of 2 1/2, 4 large eggs instead of 3. The crust also used at least 5 Tbsp of water. This is a keeper!

this is delicious, but mine didn't set up and hold together. the fillings were falling out of the slice. Anyone have this problem?

Made this without the crust, and served with corn muffins as a side- --choosing a lighter take on a fab recipe!

I made this exactly as the direction stated and it was delicious. I think that I will play around with this recipe and use monterey jack cheese and some green chilies next time for a SW twist. A really good and comforting food and perfect for the brunch table!

The pie plate displayed appears to be pottery.

I believe that the pie is displayed in a pottery pie plate.

To Chenderer: I believe that is a stoneware or pottery plate in a neutral color, not metal. Therefore, the cooking instructions would be correct.

I made very close to the actual recipe, but didn't have an onion in the pantry so that was left out. I had quite a bit of roasted red pepper on hand, so I substituted that for the fresh red pepper called for, and used about 2 cups (one to replace the onion.) Didn't have quite enough gruyere on hand, so I added some Sage Darby cheese to make the 6 ounces. Fabulous - even better the second day. The crust was wonderful, easy to work with. Will definitely make again.

I haven't made this yet, but has anyone noticed that the picture shows the quiche in a metal cake pan, yet the recipe calls for a glass pie plate. Glass and metal cook differently so I wonder if anyone used the metal cake pan and if any problems were encountered besides the obvious difficulty of getting the first piece out.

Very Yummy recipe -- says QA

The crust is very tasty. I made this on Sunday and have been eating the leftovers for breakfast ever since. It is tasty. The only modification I might make is to increase the egg and decrease the cream. I had no problem fitting the filling into my standard glass pie plate.

I'm a longtime quiche- maker so we're used to fabulous pies. I stuck to the recipe more or less, except for using all butter in the crust, fitting it into a 12-inch quiche dish, and adding an extra egg white to the mix. Very comforting and worth making again.

I didn't have the green onions so I left them out, and it was still delicious. Used a 10 inch tart pan because the filling was too much. Great leftovers.

My filling was just the right amount. It baked up real nice. I even made mine the day before and warmed it up for a lunch party. I actually didn't have whole grain cornmeal, just regular, and it was still good.

I made this for a brunch and it was a big hit. However I did take a shortcut and used a premade pie crust to save time.

Recipe make way too much filling for a nine inch pie crust. Otherwise, flavors were very good

Wow..I made this for a potluck dinner event, and it was a hit.. I substituted raw coconut oil instead of the less healthy vegetable shortening and it worked just fine.

I used coarse-ground cornmeal in the crust, and it worked fine. VERY tasty. Yum.
