I prepared this with tilapia because my store was out of sole, and it was GREAT! i was worried that using a "lesser" fish would negatively impact the taste, but the pine nuts provide an subtle sweetness to the fish. the 2 things i'd say are that it takes longer than 1 minute/side unless you actually have 1/2 inch thick fish, so dont hesitate to go longer and 2, dont hesitate to lubricate the fish with a tiny bit of white wine or lemon juice while its on the pan. i seasoned my flour with dill & paprika, and used salted butter. served with a simple gazpacho, and this was a hit with a very hungry husband!

This was a really nice, simple preparation for sole filets. I had some really small, thin (barely 2 oz) filets and this cooked the perfectly. The pine nuts were a nice addition to the recipe. They provided a flavorful accompaniment to the mild fish without overpowering it.

Quite good and very easy. I would follow the suggestions of more chives for the sauce and lemon zest in the dredging mixture.

Stunning fish recipe. Used a combo of chives and spring onions (scallions) since I had both and included some paprika in the dredging flour. I took another reviewers advice and had the other dishes ready to serve before putting the fish in. Lovely!

He who only eats fish because it's good for him has declared this dish "edible, a 3.5" on a scale of 1-5 with 5 being "very tasty, are you sure this is fish?" and 1 being "please pass the mustard". I personally thought it a little bland, but good. I probably won't make it again, however, because I wasn't super impressed with it. There are better fish recipes to be found on this site.

SIMPLE AND ELEGANT. I USED GREEN SCALLIONS, A LITTLE LESS BUTTER AND ADDED A TOUCH OF LEMON ZEST TO THE PINE NUT/SCALLION MIXTURE. WITH STEAMED SPINACH AND A BAKED POTATO...LOVELY!

I really liked this dish...very easy to make and tasty. First time I ever cooked sole, how 'd I miss this fish all these years? I only used about 1 tablespoon of butter for the whole dish, tho, and skipped the flour part. Still came out great. Served over couscous with steamed zucchini.

Thank you to those who took the time to review this recipe prior to my review. Their comments were very helpful. It took so little time to make this delicious recipe, so few ingredients, was very economical, and yet it was delicious! I used the side burner of my Weber grill to prepare this dish, no mess, no fishy smell, and I was able to enjoy my backyard instead of being stuck inside. A perfect summer recipe!

This dish was easy to make and tasted great. I doubled the pinenuts and used shallots, because I didn't have scallions or chives on hand. I also took the advice of others and added a bit more butter before cooking the fish. Enjoy!

I used lemon sole, lots of lemon pepper in the flour, poured in pine nuts (with some extra butter) and a fistful of scallions. Make sure your side dishes are finished first: you won't find a quicker main course to prepare and devour.

This was so quick, easy, and delicious I will definitely make it again. The key to the receipe is adding the fresh butter to the browned butter from which the pine nuts and chives have been removed. The fish had a lovely nutty flavor. You can't go wrong adding more pine nuts and chives of course, just don't start over with a clean pan.

I made this last night and also doubled the pine nuts & chives. I also added Italian seasoning and cayenne to the flour. I definitely recommend these additions. Served with green beans and pilaf. Very easy, very fast, & very good.

I have fixed this recipe three times and each time, it was sensational. I served it with snap peas and garlic mashed potatoes for dinner guests last week and everyone raved about it and requested the recipe. It's easy to make, too. I used tilapia instead of the sole.

3 and a half forks. This was extremely quick and easy to make. A very subtle taste. I doubled the chives and nuts, and put some italian spices in the flour, as well as a little cayenne pepper. Served with steamed string beans (avec pepper, garlic powder, and lemon juice) - complemented very nicely.

Although I found it to be ever so slightly bland I would definetly make it again, and most people probably wont find it bland at all. However I do recommend taking the advice of some of the others and adding more pinenuts and chives. Its is also an excellent idea to add a little shredded arugula as well.

Quick, easy and tasty! (I had to laugh at the cook from Springfield, VA who said they hadn't tried the recipe yet.)

I used some butter/oil to brown the pine nuts and chopped scallions, and added a little shredded arugula at the last minute. Dipped the sole in milk, then breadcrumbs laced with "cajun seasoning", browned it briefly, and poured on some lemon juice. Delicious! If you make enough of the nut/greenery garnish, it can go on top of a rice pilaf as well.

I took the advice of several reviewers and added more pinenuts and chives. Tasty and easy to prepare, that makes it a keeper.

Good dish- use a lot of chives and pine nuts for the flavor, since sole is a very bland fish. I would definitely make it again. It is good served with couscous that also has pine nuts in it.

quick & easy served with aspargas & a spicy yellow rice added an extra teaspoon of nuts & chives a great dish with no time in the kitchen

Sole is a delicate fish and pares well with sweeter nuts. Macadamia nuts are also a good pairing. If a 'stronger' flavor is needed then fruit like mangos can be added. You want it sweet but not too sweet.

I didn't think this dish had enough flavor. Sole is a very mild fish, so it needs more "umph" to give it a great taste.

It was FAST! And it was GOOD. We had it with basmati rice and vine-ripeneed tomatoes.
