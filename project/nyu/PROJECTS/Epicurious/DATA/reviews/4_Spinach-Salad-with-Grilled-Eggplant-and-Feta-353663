The strength of this mild salad is that all flavors combine into one balanced taste. No single flavor stood out. I'll use this again as a side to a flavorful main dish. This keeps well for 24 hours even with the dressing mixed in. Add a few fresh spinach leaves to give height, and enjoy again.

excellent. Only thing I added was some grilled onion.

Delish! Had no marjoram on hand or at the store, so opted for oregano and it was still terrific. Used a bit less feta than called for, but enough to not overwhelm the eggplant. Easy and delicious!

I never thought I was much of an eggplant eater but this was terrific! I mistakenly used mozzarella, feta would have had added more flavor. This is so easy it will become a weeknight regular!

Loved this. Got ahead of myself and grilled the eggplant w/ just EVOO and S&P. To adjust, I marinated the grilled eggplant in the dressing (with less garlic, since it was raw). Added grilled asparagus and roasted red pepper to the marinade along with the eggplant. Used that mixture as the "dressing" on top of the greens. Would be awesome with chickpeas or grilled chicken and then put inside a wrap/tortilla.

Sooo good, making it again! I personally found the fresh marjoram too strong, so plan on using dry this time. Definitely a favorite!

Thanks to other reviews I modified the recipe. Seemed a bit bland, but after adding the roasted vegetables and the kalamata olives, the balance was really nice. Wonderful picnic fare to take to outdoor concert. Will definitely make this again

Just amazing. I had fresh marjoram and followed recipe precisely, although I can see additional possibilities from other reviewers. Served with leftover chicken, but think it would be sensational with lamb. Absolutely will make again. So exciting to find a different salad for summer!

I cut the eggplant into 1 inch pieces and cooked it for 20 min. in a grill basket. I then removed the eggplant and cooked the spinach with the sauce on it in the grill basket until it wilted. I also made 1 cup of Israeli couscous. I placed the eggplant at the bottom of a big bowl. then the couscous, the spinach, pine nuts, and feta cheese. Delicioso!! I will make it again!...:)

Yummy! The dressing is divine! I made a couple of small modifications due to inventory restrictions: used dried instead of fresh herbs, spring mix rather than spinach, no pine nuts. I added roasted red pepper, sliced cucumber, kalamata olives and grilled onions marinated in the dressing. I will be making this all summer.

OK, so I modified it but the essence is the same: broiled eggplant, added chicken sauteed in the salad dressing w/dried oregano, replaced pine nuts w/blanched asparagus (happened to have it), added a sliced roasted red pepper, stuffed the salad into warm pita bread. WOW. What a delightful light supper with tomato soup & hummus on the side. Relatively quick too, about 30 min, and healthy. The asparagus is key, adds a nice flavor and crunch. Definitely becoming a weeknight favorite.

Not only did I use eggplant, but I also grilled one zucchini and a few shallots to add to the salad. And instead of adding the pine nuts, I added some slices of chicken breast that I had left over from the other night. I thought this salad was quite delicious and refreshing, and I will definitely make it again!

This recipe is proof that simple is best. Served it at a dinner party where I had 1 vegetarian and 1 gluten free person, so was looking for easy. Served this salad along with grilled chicken breast and some tortellini, so there were at least 2 things to choose from for everyone. Fantastic.

I am always on the hunt for different salad ideas - this was fantastic. The spinach, egglant, pine nuts, feta and oregano were a great combination. I served it with a grilled leg of lamb - it was a hit.

Fabulous! The hubby was initially skeptical about a salad-only dinner, but loved it. I was looking for a recipe to use what I had in the fridge: spinach, eggplant, and a little goat cheese happened to be hanging out in there (no feta). I used a lot less cheese than the recipe called for and I didn't have pine nuts, so I used toasted slivered almonds instead. It was fantastic and everything blended together so well.

Fresh eggplant, spinach, garlic and oregano from the garden. Very nice and easy. Also added grilled red peppers and not so much spinach. Perfect for a summer evening.

I followed the recipe (almost) to the letter and this salad was WONDERFUL. Even my eggplant-picky husband devoured it and loved it. Will make this over and over again!

a perfect recipe for a Mediterranean dinner - served with a grilled pork loin butterflied and stuffed with oregano, along with the sesame orzo with scallions from the August 1995 Gourmet. WOW. our discriminating guests devoured it.

This was super easy and tasted great. Served as a first course in a Greek-themed meal. I also recommend adding grilled red pepper strips. Such a pretty salad! This would make a great vegetarien meal or with some grilled chicken. (I have a husband who must have meat at dinner)

Delicious! I made this for a quick dinner one night for myself and substituted goat cheese instead of feta (didn't have any on hand) and it was wonderful. Eggplant was creamy and satisfying!

Made this salad for a small dinner party and it was polished off. Great combination of flavours and textures between the spinach, eggplant and feta. And don't skip the pine nuts, they really add a much-needed crunch. Easy to make, and definitely a keeper!

I was skeptical of this recipe because I'm not a big fan of eggplant, but it turned out really well! The eggplant seemed almost creamy when paired with the feta and pine nuts, and the smokiness from the grill came through nicely, adding a lot of flavor. Not boring, and tasty.
