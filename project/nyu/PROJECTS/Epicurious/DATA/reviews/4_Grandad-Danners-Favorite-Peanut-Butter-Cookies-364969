I added chocolate chips, because I didn't have peanut butter chips--good combination.I like this recipe because the cookies stayed soft, just the way I like them.

While riding out Hurricane Sandy with a friend in NYC I was craving a good cookie, preferably with chocolate and nuts. Found this one and added 1/2 C cocoa and a 1/4 C milk. The butter was frozen and when the lights flickered we decided to melt it on the stove while we still had power. We didn't have brown sugar so I used some brown raw sugar. We also used chunky peanut butter and added 1/4 cup chopped pecans. Didn't take the time to cream anything, just mixed it by hand. Did away with the the 1/4 C granulated sugar and just forked the golf ball size mounds. Cooked em' 12 minutes and they are delicious with ice cold milk while we still have ice. We have renamed them PBC Sandy's!!!!!!!!!

A new favorite! Substituted the peanut butter chips for chocolate chunks and reduced the sugar by 1-2 tablespoons. Had to bake an extra 5 mins, but still came out chewy

I read the reviews before making this recipe and I took the advice to make them less sweet. I used a heaping 1/3 cup of each brown sugar and substituted a scant cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips for the peanut butter chips. I also added a scant half cup of chopped peanuts, but I imagine using crunchy peanut butter would have the same effect. They were a big hit, and I would make them with these revisions again. they may not look done after 10 minutes, but they are! When they cooled they were crunchy on bottom, soft in the middle and just cracked on top. P.s. to the person that substituted white sugar for brown and hated the recipe... your cookies were dry because brown sugar has moisture, white does NOT.

I tried these exactly as written. They came together very quickly, and were very good. The texture is perfect if you like the edges firm and the inside chewy...this cookie was even better the next morning with a cup of hot coffee...

Please review recipes fairly. How can you post a poor review after not following a recipe as originally written/published? White sugar is NOT the same as brown sugar. Altering ingredients changes a recipe.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I like my peanut butter cookies soft and chewy. These turned out dry and hard. I followed the recipe except I had no light brown sugar so I used white sugar.

Very easy to make. Delicious....10 minutes doesn't seem like long enough for them to be done. But I left them on the cookie tray for about 10 minutes after I took them out of the oven. They are especially yummy warm...the peanut butter chips are soft and blend into the cookie.

Oh Wow! These are amazing cookies - not too chewy, not too cakey, just perfectly scrumptious!!!! The only changes I made were to use 1 cup dark brown sugar (it was all I had) and I used 1/2 cup peanut butter chips and 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips. Mmmmmmmm, these are to die for!!!! I did find them a little too sweet however - next time I will use only 3/4 cup of the dark brown sugar.

This was far and away the best peanut butter (and possibly the best) cookie I've ever made! I followed the recipe as directed minus the white sugar.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe. Taste was fine, but they didn't hold together well. Wouldn't be good for a crowd with a discerning palate for sweets. Have used other recipes with much better results.

These cookies are melt in your mouth tender. Not chewy like I was hoping. The flavors are good and they hold their shape. Good overall, but I was prefer a chewy PB cookie.

I used almond butter since my family wouldn't eat it on it's own. It has no sugar in it so it adapted well with other readers' suggestions to lower the sugar. I also only used light brown sugar, but used 3/4 cup. They were exquisite when rolled in raw sugar.

I doubled the recipe and used 1/4 C less brown sugar. I used Recess Pieces instead of peanut butter chips, and it worked great. They look so cute sitting in my glass cookie jar. We all LOVED these cookies! They're soft and chewy and perfectly delicious.

The cookies are great. They're soft and chewy. A little too sugary for my taste -- but I rolled the cookies in sugar before baking. All the same, next time I make them I'll put in at least a 1/4 cup less sugar.

After reading other reviews, I tweaked it myself and was really happy: used natural, chunky peanut butter (loved it), less sugar overall but more dark than light...then, because I like chocolate, I used half peanut butter chips with half chocolate chips. I'll definitely save this recipe to make again. A real hit!

I absolutely hate all peanut butter cookies.... EXCEPT for this one. I made these as written. These are light and buttery with a nice light yet not overwhelming peanut butter flavor. I love the addition of the crunchy PB and the PB chips. Definitely my all time favorite PB cookie. Even my 75 year old mother said she could grow to like these as she feels the same way I do about traditional PB cookies.

I just made these cookies this morning, and I thought they were great. I used white chocolate chips instead of peanut butter chips, and they still came out well. My one small criticism was that they were a little sweet, so next time I will cut down on the dark brown sugar a little. This was an easy and fun recipe, and I am excited to make them again.

I loved the texture of these cookies. I'm not a fan of crisp cookies and these were perfectly soft and delicious. I didn't have any peanut butter chips so I left them out. However, they were incredibly sweet. The directions don't say to use natural PB so I used regular old skippy, but they were just way too sweet for me. Next time I'll try using the natural PB, or maybe just cutting back on the sugar a little. I'm worried that might ruin the texture though. I don't know, I like sweet but these were just over the top to me!

Well, they are delicate. I could not roll into balls, so dropped onto the cookie sheet then pressed with a fork. Still cooling, but it seems they will harden to a transportable cookie stiffness. I did modify, adding some Nutella for being short of peanut butter, and had no peanut butter chips. From advance tasting, they seem very sweet so I would cut the sugar down next time. Why Gwyneth Paltrow felt she needed to enlighten the world with by publishing this recipe in a book is a mystery. . .

Loved loved loved these cookies. I was not a peanut butter cookie person...but in a household of sweet boys I succombed to making a batch. These were VERY easy to make & TOTALLY tasty :-) Next time I will use chunky peanut butter to give it a little kick. This will NOW be a family must-have cookie.

Delicious! Everything I was looking for in a peanut butter cookie. The peanut butter chips are a really nice touch. I used only dark brown sugar and I think that gave it a little more depth. Make these cookies!

I decided to give Gwyneth Paltrow's recipe a try , glad I did. I've always used an old recipe from Better Homes & Gardens cookbook, which produces crisp peanut butter cookies. These were tender & delicious. Used chunky p.b., light brown sugar, & chocolate chips, because that's what I had on hand. Formed the dough in balls, flattened with a fork, baked for 12 minutes. Will use this recipe from now on. Doesn't look like Gwyneth eats these cookies does it??

I was skeptical of the high rating of this recipe after seeing only 3 reviews (other pb cookie recipes have 200+ reviews), but I've just rated it 4 forks myself. This recipe is so good I made it two days in a ROW! Last night we made it with melted butter, 1 cup dark brown sugar (didn't have light brown), and 1 cup chunky peanut butter (didn't have pb chips). It turned out AMAZING! They were thick, didn't spread during baking, and had a rich and almost sandy peanut buttery texture. They were gone by the end of the night. I made another bath tonight, with 1/2 cup white sugar + 1/4 cup molasses because we were out of light and dark brown sugar, and same sub with the peanut butter (1 cup chunky bc we didn't have pb chips), and they were still good, although not as good as the ones with dark brown sugar. Rambling aside, the bottom line is MAKE THESE COOKIES! They are soft and crumbly, not thin or crispy or chewy. Way to go Gwyneth!

I, like the cook from Denver, worried that these cookies would disintegrate because one of them fell apart as I was taking the pan from the oven. But after they cooled they were fine. More than fine. They were wonderful. They are melt-in-your-mouth tender. Not chewy, not crisp, not cake-y. It's hard to describe the texture. Sort of like flaky, but with crumbs instead of flakes. But not crumbly. The flavor was just the right balance of peanuttiness and sweetness. I made them smaller than the recipe said: I rolled the dough into balls the size of walnuts, not golf balls. I got 40 2-inch cookies. Probably not enough!

I was pleasantly surprised by these. I am a pastry chef and I am not ashamed to say that I am really, REALLY picky when it comes to recipes and their finished products. I set out looking for a chewy cookie with a lot of peanut flavor that wasn't too sweet nor too salty. This comes pretty close. This is very easy to make, it would be a great recipe to make with kids! The dough comes together very quickly and easily, the resulting dough is very soft but don't let that scare you! They spread about half an inch after baking which resulted in beautiful thick cookies (I took the liberty of rolling mine in sugar and pressing them down with a fork). I did feel like they took a bit longer than 10 minutes to bake and my oven tends to run hot, so you may have to adjust your baking time as you go. I like a doughy cookie, that's just my personal preference, and the final texture of this cookie was soft but substantial which I really enjoyed. I confess that I didn't have dark brown sugar so I used all light brown sugar instead which compromised a bit of depth in flavor, but of course that was my fault. I also substituted crunchy peanut butter because it gives a softer cookie a bit more body and adds a constrasting texture to the finished product, again my personal preference. The flavor was good, I'll definitely make these again, but next time I'll be prepared and I'll use the dark brown sugar :)

I was worried at first that these were going to fall apart, but after they cooled off, they were fantastic.
