I thought this was fabulous. I used regular noodles and boiled them first but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. My wine was a dry Riesling and I used 1 lb of white mushrooms and .5 lb of portobello. I thought the proportion was perfect. This was a very simple yet beautiful lasagna.

I was hesitant to make this after reading some of the reviews. I don't regret trying it! This is not your typical lasagna, it's much lighter. I liked it much better the next day. Where I live mushrooms are really expensive, so I didn't use as much as called for in the recipe. I added the juices to the lasagna together with the mushrooms. I found the tomato sauce very good, maybe due to the wine but I agree with other reviewers - add a bit more seasoning. Next time I may use tomato puree instead. One word about the parmesan sauce, it needs more parmesan and less nutmeg which really overpowers the delicate flavor. I had some parmesan sauce left over and added it to my plate when reheating the lasagna and it was just fabulous. I wouldn't hesitate to make this ahead and serve it to guests - it improves with age! Even my husband loved it - and he doesn't like many new foods. Enjoy!

I've made this recipe 3 times now. Obviously it's popular or I wouldn't have done so! I prepared a double batch last Sunday and I managed to get the scrapings.... I don't agree that the nutmeg overtakes the parmesan sauce -I put more in! Could have used even more white sauce, though. I used white button mushrooms, "baby bellas" and portobellas, reserved some of the mushroom liquid, just in case. But it was very moist and absolutely delicious. One 'veggie' friend went back for seconds - speaks for itself!!

My family loves this recipe. My daughter says "because the sauce is kind of tangy." It is a very creative, fabulous dish!

We loved it. We will make it again. It's a winner. I think the bland comments can be fixed. We salted and peppered each filler to taste. If each tastes good on it's own, you'll have a good end product. There was liberal use of pepper in our kitchen, as usual. We made it just like the recipe called for and it turned out perfectly. (We did use a metal pan instead of glass, because that's what we have.) We were glad that we put the mushroom juice into the pan. I think the extra moisture was needed. We enjoyed that it wasn't as heavy as the typical lasagna. My husband hates ricotta, so not having ricotta is a plus. (I like ricotta, but didn't miss it.) I'm recommending this to friends. Very tasty alternative to the familiar lasagna - a great break from the ordinary. The lasagna has a nice, fresh flavor. I will serve it at a dinner party with Italian sausages and spinach. I think those will all go well together.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. The nutmeg flavor takes over, and the parmesan "sauce" really just replaces the traditional ricotta layer, but isn't as good. The recipe doesn't call for enough red sauce, so the entire thing is too dry.

Excellent recipe. I have a vegetarian in the family so that was a great recipe and the whole family loved it. I used 2 cans of the crushed tomatoes and I found it was to much actually. The only thing is that iy is a lot of work but I find all good lasagnas are work but well worth it in the end. Will surely make it again.

I made this for a dinner party for 5 and it was fantastic. I took the advice to make more of the tomato sauce (added some morel mushroom soaking liquid then reduced it slightly). You really need more of that or it would be dry. We thought it was great, and 5 people finished the pan. Will definitely make again.

This is really good, though does not come out looking or tasting like what one normally thinks of as "lasagna". Have made several times, add some extra garlic, and the leftovers are great.

It's not a big lasagna -- but it was yummy. It just fed eight people, no leftovers. I also added an extra 14-oz can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and onion, and my own usual tomato sauce seasonings (oregano, bay leaf).

I served this for a dinner party and my guests liked it. Like several of the others, I made changes in the basic recipe. I followed the suggestion to use two 28-oz cans of tomatoes (one plain, one garlic-basil). I also added a half ounce of dried porcini, reconstituted and chopped, to the tomato sauce. I have to wonder, though--if we have to make so many adjustments to the recipe in order to make it worthwhile, why not just look for another recipe?

The recipe was excellent. I made a few changes after reading the other comments: added an extra 14 oz. can of tomatoes with garlic and basil (you could even go with 2 28 oz. cans), added some red pepper flakes to make it a little spicier, and cooked a large white onion to which I added the cans of tomato. Next time, I will also make a little extra parmesan sauce to make it creamier. Excellent!!!

YUM! I heeded the warning of the blandness and I took appropriate steps. 1) used Red Gold brand tomatoes with roased garlic and onion(one of this, and the other a normal can of tomatoes). 2) I bumped up the chopped garlic a bit. 3) I added a dash or two of dried rosemary and thyme. It turned out great. Before assembly, I took the cooking juices from the mushrooms (about a cup or so) and added it to the sauce. What great flavor. I didn't find it to be dry at all. I used one pound of portobello caps and a half pound of button mushrooms. This is a great combination for this dish.

Very bland. Also, there was not enough tomato sauce which made it dry.

Bland flavor, not worth the cost of the mushrooms!

Good recipe, but it really was a little on the bland side.This was partly my fault, since I used an assortment of (milder) Japanese mushrooms instead of richer portabello and crimini mushrooms.I'll make it again sometime with Shiitake, portabello, and crimini. Could use a little more garlic, too, I thought.

This recipe defies description!! Just reading it made me hungry. I added more garlic and Italian Seasoning (heavy on the rosemary)to the tomato mixture. I did note that the tomato sauce was too running for my taste. I would make sure I drained the canned tomatoes well before using. Also, I was left a little short on the sauce towards the end but that is a tactical error on my part. The Parmie sauce could be eaten with a spoon (if you were so inclined). SUCH A GREAT DISH!!!

This recipe was good, but a little bland for my taste.

Good recipe. After I removed the foil and continued to bake the lasagne, it was ready after 15 minutes, so watch yours carefully. Also, I used grated fresh Romano instead of Parmesan in the sauce and it was so flavorful that I didn't need to add any additional salt or pepper. If you like a thicker cheese sauce, just whisk in the (warm) milk very slowly.

This recipe is a great variation on the standard lasagna and is easy to make. The parmesan sauce referred to in the recipe can be found in the recipe file directory if you search for "Parmesan Sauce" and is dated February 1998.

I loved it. Unfortunately, in the last paragraph it mentions a Parmesan Sauce for the first time! At that point it was too late to do anything about it so It only have the cheese to sprinkle on the top layered inbetween (i got extra but not enough). I should have paid more attention knowing how much cheese a lasagna typically requires.

This recipe was not only delicious, it was very easy to make.
