Excellent! A few modifications: Used thighs and whole legs with skin and bone Ended up with 45 min total cooking time but not overdone at all -- perfect! Did 30 min broiling while turning roughly every 5 min; 5 min with heat off; 10 min at 350. Was an experiment but worked well and will repeat Did not trust bottom of broiler pan so just basted chicken with lemon juice concoction around 25 min mark. Used truffle oil salt instead of regular salt. Was so good and well-received by a discriminating chicken lover! Think I will make regularly but experiment with seasonings that go into lemon juice. What a flexible recipe!

I used leg quarters, I little too fatty. I added a double splash of Chardonnay.I'm glad I did, there was not enough liquid aside from fat. It is really good and pretty easy. I'll make it again.

Very good! I used skinless chicken breasts and it was a little dry, but that might also have been my fault because I think I also cooked them for too long. I am going to try again though because the dish had good flavor.

It is delicious and easy. I eyeball the ingredients as well and it turns out superb every time. Weekday staple.

this recipe is great for an easy fix. just eyeballed the measurements and it came out fine. used leg and thigh so the meat was very tender but if you had trouble with the breast, try brining it first but remember to ease up when adding salt to the recipe.

great recipe! i marinated the chicken a lot longer than the recipe said to and it was much more tender.

This recipe was a huge hit with my family, and easy to make! I used legs and thigh pieces, and found the cooking time to be perfect.

I have made this recipe a few times and every time it was amazing. I am not a fan of chicken at all, and don't cook a lot of meat but this recipe is extremely easy and tastes so good when done with thighs. It's a great recipe to serve for just my husband and myself, but I would also pull it out for special guests.

Quic easy and taste is excellent. The breast is especially good.

I loved it and would rate it excellent. My roommate liked it and would rate it good. Quick and easy to make. Thick, boned chicken breasts took a lot longer to cook than listed--a meat thermometer is your friend.
