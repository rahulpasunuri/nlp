Yummy! I breaded the scallops in an egg/cornmeal with salt and pepper mix, then cooked them in a skillet as per recipe. Love the pea purée. Divine!

For the amount of time spent I did not find this to be a WOW recipe. The pea puree was too heavy with the lightness of the scallops. I found the mint oil heavy for the whole dish. And overall there just wasn't enough flavor. We liked the pea puree on its on and are going to find other uses for it. Also we added the juice of a lemon and a pinch of sugar to the mint oil and now like it for drizzling on salads, meats, etc.

This recipe contained two of my most favorite foods: fresh peas and scallops. I followed the recipe exactly, except served the salad/honey vinagrette on the side separate from the pea puree/bacon/scallops. I have also made this pea puree combined with the mint oil and served with grilled swordfish - also outstanding. Mind you, this is not a recipe for everyone.
