WOW! I love Epicurious and still rarely give 4 forks, but this recipe was so good! I usually eat my oysters fresh from the farmer's market, home, and shucked within a day, but had a dozen that stayed in my fridge a couple days longer that I'd like so didn't want to eat them raw and this was the perfect alternative. Great flavor. Used Sambuca so would definitely recommend the liqueur. Will absolutely make again.

My oysters turned out a little too watery for some reason, but I liked the flavors. Next time I will use more of the garlic/bread topping and a little salt.

I used lots of butter and garlic for the breadcrumbs, and put the oysters (not on the half shell) in a baking dish with the breadcrumbs on top and baked it. Simple clean flavours, wonderful!

We had a huge dinner party last night and these were a HUGE hit! I don't know about the last reviewers suggestion of using Ritz crackers. I just cut the crusts off some french bread we had laying around, cut the white part into bits, and followed the rest of the recipe. SUGGESTION: DO use liquor as the recipe suggests. I didn't want to buy a huge bottle of Pernod ($40), so I bought one of those tiny bottles of Sambuca and it did the job beautifully. I bought the oysters fresh and unshucked, and shucked them at home myself. Not a bit deal IF you wear a heavy glove and take your time to avoid a puncture wound. (Really, make sure you take safety precautions if you've never done this before.) It was my first time shucking at it all went great!

I tried Ritz crackers crushed instead of the panko-although the panko is also very,very good.I think the ritz crackers is a better blend with the butter and my choice of spices(garlic,pepper,hot sauce,etc.)

Make sure to use a panko style bread crumb. it works the best.
