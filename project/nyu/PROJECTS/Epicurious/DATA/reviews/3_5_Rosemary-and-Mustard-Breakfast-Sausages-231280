* My favorite breakfast meat. So easy and the taste is fantastic ! I use INGLEHOFFER STONE GROUND mustard, in the round plastic 10 oz bottle/jar. Enjoy These :)

A wicked good success once again! Everyone from kids to adults loved this and gobbled it up. I made in advance, froze, then thawed and baked it the morning I needed it.

I have made these sausages for about four different brunches by now and they are always a hit.

One of the few things my husban hates one being rosemary and he loved these. That really tells you they are yummy.

I have made these twice and both times I was glad I doctored up the tube of breakfast sausage using this recipe. It just feels a little fancier! Tastes great, too. My guests enjoyed it.

These are, simply put, AMAZING!!! As with all savory dishes I cook, I improvised. I used a 1 lb tube of sausage instead of links. I pressed 3 cloves of garlic into the onion. I also added thyme and oregano. For me, mustard seed is a new dicovery on the cooking frontier. I plan on finding as many recipes as possible to use them in. This recipe could also be changed into any sort of sausage you wanted, I assume. They are also incredibly easy.

Love these! I make these along with the Eggnogg French Toast on this website for Christmas breakfast. I prepare everything on Christmas Eve, then just pop it into the oven Christmas morning while the kids are tearing into the presents. Then breakfast is ready with no work at all!

I thought these were very tasty. I chopped the onion and rosemary together in the food processor which got it as fine as I needed it. I also used a 50% less fat breakfast sausage.

WOW! These are exceptional little sausages. A HUGE hit on Mother's Day. I can't wait to make them again.

Fantastic and make-ahead, always a plus. Made the recipe as directed, garnished with rosemary, voila. Gone. This quantity is perfect for 6 at a brunch with multiple dishes.

I made these the night before and then just heated prior to serving. Forgot to add the mustard, so spread on top. Can only imagine how much better these would be if made according to the recipe as they were delicious even with the goof.

This was great. I made it up early for Christmas morning. The sausages were gone instantly. I wish I had made more -- and so did my family.

This was a nice change from your typical breakfast sausage. Loved the flavor. I didn't have room in my oven to bake it so I cooked it on the stovetop and it came out great.

I thought the mustard taste was too strong but several people at our brunch liked the taste.

Made these for a brunch and not a one left. Soo good.

You may want to reduce the amount of rosemary and mustard as they were a little overpowering.

Delicious! The family was fighting over the last one. Did make a few changes: add an extra 1/4 tsp rosemary, used 16-oz. Sage flavor sausage (Jimmy Dean), an extra 1/4 tsp. mustard, and heaping 1/2 tsp cracked black pepper. Will definitely make again.

These were delicious, and sooo easy to make ahead on Christmas Eve, and toss into the oven Christmas morning. We used honey-sizzler sausages made locally, and the sweetness of the honey and the caramelized onion, combined with the sharply distinctive rosemary (my favorite herb!) plus a touch of mustard was suberb! Absolutely will make again - and I'm not usually a big sausage fan!

YUMMY! A delicious addition to our Mother's Day brunch. Onions definitely need to be minced small. Easy to prepare!

Very tastey sausages. The course mustard is a must. Served it with a goat cheese and potato pancake salad (also from this site). Made for a good light, but satisfying, meal.

It would be so great if you could include Preparation time for the recipes featured.

I made these for my sister for dinner one night, and we love them. She said that with all teh mustard in it (I added a little extra), they tasted like dumpling filling from our favorite Chinese resturant.

Fabulous..........I made these for Christmas breakfast, I should have doubled the recipe!

I have used the same mixture with a little garlic as a stuffing for a Turkey. The flavours permeate wonderfully throuhout the Turkey. Try it.

I made this recipe for my husband and brother-in-law Christmas morning and we all loved it. The sausages are so easy to make using a roll package of sausage (instead of links). I mixed everything the day before, then formed the patties and baked them Christmas morning. I will definitely keep this recipe in my breakfast repertoire!

This was a hit at our Christmas breakfast. I made it with regular breakfast sausage but it would be lovely with a spicier sausage too. Delicious!

I made this for my family on Christmas morning (along with the whole menu from the Bon Appetit issue) and everyone raved! I used a Walla Walla sweet onion, which made for great flavor. My husband, who usually doesn't like mustard, loved this dish. My parents said it was better than a restaurant! I followed the recipe, which was very easy, and used a 1/4 cup measure to scoop and form the patties, which was much easier than shaping them by hand. I'd definitely make this again.

I made these for Christmas breakfast, and they were very good. The mustard gave the sausage a nice tang, and the rosemary was just enough without being overwhelming in flavor. I made a double batch ahead of time and froze what I didn't cook, so I'll have them to pop in the oven whenever we want them again. Instead of sausage links, I used 12-ounce packages of low-fat breakfast sausage(the tube-shaped package).
