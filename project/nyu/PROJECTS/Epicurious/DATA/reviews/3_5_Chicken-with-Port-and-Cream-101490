The reviewers below are morons. Herbs instead of quatre epices? Half-n-Half is NOT heavy cream! No wonder you didn't like it enough to give it 4 forks. Follow JAMES BEARD'S recipe and you will be very happy.

I also changed up the spices for herbs and the heavy cream for whipping cream. It was tasty and my guests' responses are quite flattering!

Delicious and easy - even with several substitutions (Boneless chicken breasts, tarragon for spices, 1/2 and 1/2). Just be prepared for the sweetness from the Port!
