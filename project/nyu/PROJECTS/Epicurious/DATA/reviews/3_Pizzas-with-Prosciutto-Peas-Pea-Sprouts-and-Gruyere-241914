3.5 forks, actually. Followed recipe EXACTLY with one minor exception: I made two large pizzas instead of 6 personal sized-ones. Good with aged gruyere, and who can beat freshly shelled peas and sprouts??? Subtle flavors. So pretty! My one incy-wincy complaint was that is was a little on the dry side without a sauce, but the flavors are definitely there, so don't let that stop you from making this! I think next time I would just brush the rolled-out dough with olive oil before topping.
