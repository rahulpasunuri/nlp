I have made this multiple times for many occasions. I love this recipe. I have even formed the cakes and kept them in the freezer. when I want to use them I defrost, bread and fry them so I can have something elegant and easy during a quick week night meal with my husband.

These were insanely good. My entire family, even my picky 17 year old, liked these (though she liked the risotto better before I put the chives in them and fried them). I only wish I hadn't coated and fried the entire batch, because the panko loses its crispness when refrigerated and reheated in the microwave. I followed this recipe exactly, as it was the first time I had made them and you can't really judge a recipe if you make changes. The flavor is wonderful, texture with the crisp panko is amazing. I didn't feel the need for any sauce with these--I think it would overshadow the fabulous flavor. I did salt & pepper well, and I tasted before I cooled the risotto mixture to make sure I had it right. The only change I would make is to next time only coat and fry what I think we will eat at that meal, and do the rest fresh when we eat them. I believe this is the best Epicurious recipe I've ever tried. My daughter said it was the best risotto I'd made.

I was looking for a side to make for a buffet at my sisters house and didn't want to spend all day in the kitchen. Thankfully I stumbled upon this recipe and it has become a permanent part of my recipe box. After reading the reviews I chose to omit the fontina and added a good handful of nice sharp parmesanno reggiano-wanted to give it a bit more of a kick than the Fontina would have given.Everybody LOVED them and I added a side of a nice garlicky marina to use for dipping. I can't wait to start playing with this recipe even more....veggie broth with sauteed portabellos, seafood stock with crab and/or shrimp, a nice saffron base for the stock. The possibilities are endless! Woderful find!

These risotto cakes were delicious. We made them as an appetizer to bring to our friend's house and they were a huge hit. We created a grape tomato dipping sauce that went over well, too. The recipe, review and pictures are on our blogsite, Friends Food Family - Epicurious' Fontina Risotto Cakes with Fresh Chives http://bit.ly/id4ZFJ Thanks for such a great recipe!

I have made these risotto cakes several times and they always bring rave reviews. Making the risotto the night before and finishing the cakes in the oven is a must if preparing these for a dinner party.

I love those oversized Italian American rice balls stuffed with mozzarella and served with a ragu of celery, carrot and onion. So I was excited to try a new version. I made these a year ago on Christmas Eve. I was surprised that no other reviewer found the chives overpowering. Perhaps I measured incorrectly but nevertheless, I am inclined to omit them next time. I served them with an aioli. The panko bread crumbs were a key textural ingredient. Gave the rice balls a nice crunch to its soft bite otherwise. My rice balls did not fall apart as some others indicated. I consider this a party dish...not the time to be counting calories so...fry away. The recipe, as is, tasted much better with a light marinara sauce a few days later. Next time I will add 1/4 cup grated asiago and season more generously with salt and pepper. Oh, and I'm omitting the chives.

Excellent and easy if made ahead as indicated. I made risotto as I usually do (this method seemed to complicated) and then followed for making the cakes using panko. I baked them so they wouldn't be greasy and it worked fine at 350 degrees for 5-10 minutes per side.

Have not had the courage yet to try stuffed rice balls, but did try these both with seasoned panko and unseasoned panko. The unseasoned were far superior tasting. I did sprinkle very generously after the fry, with salt.

These were excellent. I had never made risotto before, but it was easy and the result was delicious. I could only find Fontella cheese. I made these for Christmas Day and my guests devoured them.

This is a really delicious recipe. That said, if I were to make it again (which I might not, solely based on the amount of time it takes - not a lot of work, just a lengthy process and a lot of dishes), I'd probably pick a cheese with a bit more flavor than fontina. Additionally, I followed the user review suggesting inclusion of truffle oil, which was a real help. They aren't joking when they say salt and pepper GENEROUSLY. If you don't do that, this recipe will fall flat. I see how these could end up becoming greasy with the oil-fry, but as long as you use a slotted spatula and let them drip off a bit before putting them in the oven, this can be avoided. Also, I found that topping the cakes generously with chives, and both parm and fontina really helped. But I might try serving with a basic marinara to help add some acidity to the dish. At very least, maybe a squeeze of lemon after frying. Definitely worth a try if you've got some time to spend!

I thought this was a terrible recipe. I make great risotto of all kinds. This was tremndous amount of work and the end product lost it's risorro creaminess and flavor. Would not recommend at all.

I love risotto, but found this recipe a little disappointing at first. As others have mentioned, the flavours of the final product were a bit underwhelming. I fiddled with the recipe for a while, and found a more flavourful and moist variation that also makes them a bit easier, especially if you're doing them for a party. The alteration that made the biggest difference was skipping the frying in favour of just baking them. When frid, I found the oil masked the more subtle risotto flavours, whereas baked they're still nice and crispy on the outside, but you really get all the risotto flavour coming through. The other modifications suggested also increased flavour. * Use a little more stock than the recipe suggests when making the risotto -- closer to 4 cups. * Substitute Raclette cheese for Fontina (Raclette has a stronger flavour) and use a little more cheese than the recipe calls for, about 2/3 cup instead of 1/2 cup. * Substitute a tiny little drizzle of truffle oil for the butter when finishing the risotto (only if you like truffle -- it's a pungent flavour -- if not, try a little lemon juice instead) * Use a full egg instead of just the yolk. * Instead of dipping the cakes in egg and pan frying -- just roll them lightly directly in the Panko crumbs, set them on a lightly oiled baking sheet, and bake at 400 degrees (F) for 5-6 minutes per side. They came out very crispy but not at all oily, with rich creamy insides. They came out crispy on the outside, and rich and creamy on the inside.

An outstanding recipe for a hearty appetizer. Made just as written; I served with a marinara and shredded parmesan. Relatively easy to make and could easily use leftover risotto to make.

These are little bites of cheesy heaven! I wanted something unique for a cocktail party and I think this will be perfect. They were definitely a LOT of work, so I would only recommend if you're doing a potluck party, or if you have time to prepare the cakes a few days ahead of time and fry day-of. I can't imagine trying to make a bunch of other apps in preparation for guests!

Wow, these are TDF! Perfectly crispy and creamy. A lot of work, but worth it. The recipe made enough for me to serve half as an appetizer for 10 and freeze the other half to fry later. I also used a bit more broth than it called for, just went for a typical risotto consistency.

These were very good, I did forget to add the panko to the risotto, but they still held together very nicely with the panko just on the outside.

These are delicious - my husband asks for them every chance he gets. I find that it requires closer to 5 cups of broth, which may be why some people are having trouble getting them to hold together. Otherwise, i make per the recipe. Enjoy!

These are great. I made them a few months ago (by the recipe) and put the extras in the freezer. Took two out earlier today to thaw in fridge to cook tonight. Didn't refer to the recipe again and forgot about coating with the panko--just browned in butter in a skilet. Outsides were crispy even without the crumbs! Perfect. Great side dish or would be wonderful with just some grilled summer vegetables.

Made these this weekend without any modifications for a small dinner party and I got pretty rave responses. I served them as a main with a couple sides. A heavy skillet is key...otherwise they'll burn instead of crisp. I concur with the other poster who said they were great microwaved the next day.

Made these tonite. They were indeed deelish. I didn't have chives, so used the green part of the scallion. I did follow the recipe completely, but next time I think I'll try shaping them, then just put them into the oven for heating. Do away with the frying.

I've made these twice and the second time they were very easy to make. The first time, I had trouble getting them to stick together. I didn't add any crumbs to the mix and I formed the risotto around a cube of Edam ( no fontina available). Followed the recipe after that and they were lovely with a molten cheese centre. Arranged three on a plate with a plume of chives for garnish. Everyone raved.

Mmmm. Fabulous! In place of the fontina, I used a 4-cheese blend of parmesean, asiago, mozzarella, and fontina, which gave it a nice extra kick. I made one batch as the recipe directs, but on the next batch I skipped the oven, and liked those better. The ones I put in the oven got a little hard (I left them in too long), so next time I may skip that step.

I made these for New Year's Eve and they fell apart, although they were good. I swore I wouldn't make them again, they are very time consuming. I threw the rest of them in the freezer and got desperate last night and heated them in a 500 degree oven for about 10 minutes. They were delicious. Never say never.

I hate to give somewhat of a negative review. I fried them the day before and then cooked them in the oven the following day and when I tasted it, I thought it tasted very bland. Plus I find fontina cheese to be somewhat blah too. I think using scallions as another person recommended might have made all the difference. Everyone thought they were crabcakes - they looked great. I might try them again with some modifications.

What a jewel of a find this is! If I could give it more stars I would. They are a bit time consuming, but soooooooo worth it. They work just as well as an hors d'ouevre as they do a side dish (you can pare them down to bite size so people can just pop them in their mouths). Believe it or not, they are also great leftover heated through in the micro. They lose their crispiness this way, but the insides melt into an oooey gooey delight. I just love these little things!!

I've got a bit bored by risotto recently, I like it but have just had a bit too much - this recipe returned my love of risotto!!! Absolutely delicious! Easy! Great to do ahead for a dinner. I made these for a main course (served with green salad), it would have served 4 people. I reheated the leftover cakes in the oven the next day and they were still yum! Changes I made to the recipe: used Edam cheese instead of fontina (I can't get it at my local shop), I used vegetable stock as I was cooking for a vegetarian and I used normal bread crumbs.

I made these risotto cakes for Easter dinner as an appetizer and received rave reviews! I served them atop a mixed green salad with basil parmesan dressing. Asolutely fabulous! For those of you who are risotto lovers you know how much time is involved in cooking it. I loved that this dish could be prepared the night before. It meant less time in the kitchen the day of my dinner party and more time to socialize with my guests!

These were delicious right out of the pan. Crisp outside and creamy, cheesy inside. Almost followed directions exactly (I can't help myself from changing a little) I added prociutto finely diced (about 1/8 cup) to the risotto mix. Could not find Panko at local grocery store so I used regular bread crumbs. Easy to make ahead of time and heat again in a hot oven for about 5-7 minutes. Although they are not as "perfect" as when eaten immediately. Brought these to a party and it was the only appetizer completely eaten.

I also made these last night,to take to a New Years party. I doubled the amounts, put in a little more fontina in them and a little less panko in the mixture. I used a cookie scoop to portion them out. They fried up beautifully. I took them on a baking sheet to put in the oven at the house we were going to. Their oven was set to 350*, so I just stuck them in for 5-7 mins. They heated through and everyone thought they were wonderful. A lot of steps but it was fine to bring to a party. Might be more difficult if you were doing many other dishes at your house. I wonder if these could be made with any left-over risotto after it cooled?? Something to try next time.

Made this recipe last night (Happy New Year, all!) for our midnight dinner party. Wow! Thanks for the response (Lowell, Mass.) re oven question. I ended up skipping that step altogether, but the cakes were a perfect complement to our menu and received hearty praise. (Tip to the cook whose cakes fell apart in the oil--make them thick when you form them. The flatter they were, the harder they were to keep together, so making them "taller" was a simple fix.) My husband, who is really the chef in our house and is used to lots of culinary compliments, went crazy for these and declared them "a real find." Will definitely make again.

These were great! They had quite a few steps, but they were worth it. I made them a day ahead, then fried them the day of and then reheated in the oven and they turned out great.

This is a great recipe and I plan on making it many times. My family and dinner guests loved it! I did make the cakes a day ahead, refrigerated them, then prepped and fried the 'day of'. I reheated in a 350 oven to crisp. The cakes were easy to form and handle.

I thought this was good, although I had trouble keeping some of them together when frying. I felt like there should have been something "wet" to go with them (as a sauce), though my partner loved them as they were. Next time I'll try another reviewer's suggestion and put the fontina in the middle.

This is a simplified recipe for oranicini, the sicilian rice balls that are essentially risotto molded around a little ljmp of cheese. Wouldn't be much more work to dice the fontina, put in the center of the cake, roll in the panko and shallow or deep fry. To the no fry cook. Frying done correctly is not going to add all that many calories and the happiness factor is way higher.

Served this for my holiday party and everybody RAVED, including my relatives from Italy. (now THAT is something :)). I did not incorporate the breadcrumbs to the risotto--only used on the outside. I did not have chives, instead I used green onions; they added great flavor. Also, I coarsely chopped pecans to add texture to my plain, unflavored bread crumbs (didn't have Panko). Finally - no fontina, only pecorino romano. Fried on the stove and placed in sterno to keep warm. Yummy!

All the ingredients make for a great dish...but there has to be a way to lighten this up and skip the frying by baking them to crispness for 2 reasons: (1) baking would dump some of the calories and (2) baking would make it easier to prepare.

To the cook in California: Your are just "pan frying" the exterior of the cake in the pan. The Oven time is to warm the product through. The low temp helps with cooking the interior to keep the risotto moist (would be my professional opinion). However, this recipe sounds great on many levels. Though i am confused as to why one would fold the panko into the actual risotto, I don't think it will maintain the crispness of the texture and won't help binding any more than the yolk. Try it there way and then I will try my own.

This looks delicious and I can't wait to try it. However, a few questions first: Since they're fully cooked after being sauteed, why do the cakes go into the oven after being sauteed? Is it just to keep them warm until serving time? Or??
