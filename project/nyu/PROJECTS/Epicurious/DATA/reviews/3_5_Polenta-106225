I love that there is a basic recipe on this site! You can fallow what another chef has dicovered is good, but here, you can add anything you like. I followed another reviewer and made mine with 3/4 C corn meal and 3 C liquid. I used milk and water. I grated garlic, heated it in the pot with a little olive oil and a small bit of boulion and added the milk as soon as the garlic was a little brown. I added the milk in small amounts and whisked feverishly. I added quite a bit of black pepper, a little ground red pepper, and nutmeg. Once all the milk was added, I threw in a generous handful of cheese and whisked it in. I let it sit on low stirring often for 15 minutes. Then I added parsley and chives. I poured it on a baking pan lined with saran wrap and covered it, threw it in the frige over night, and it was fabulous! I'm made this for my husband for Valentines Day :) I thought some grilled chicken and grilled polenta would be great! With a sauce of roasted red peppers, goat cheese, and key lime juice, so I wanted the polenta to be a little spicy :) Have fun with this! And if, when you add the polenta (or corn meal) it clumps up, as it did for a former reviewer, add enough liquid to make it thick but soupy and just keep stirring until it's very thick and you'll work out the clumps. Have fun! :)

I'm a great fan of Polenta, but my recipe is even simpler. Use a 3-1 ratio: 3 cups water with 1 tsp salt to 1 cup polenta (ALWAYS use coarse cornmeal and NOT the stuff in the box from the local supermarket). Into the boiling salted water, gradually stir in polenta and reduce heat to low, stirring constantly. I scarf mine up with a dab of butter for breakfast, but with little effort it can be dressed up and taken out for dinner by adding Parmesan.

Very decent when using finely milled corn meal as the recipe suggests in the footnote. I substituted chicken stock, added onions, white pepper, parmegian (at the last minute) and salt. Came out thick and creamy.

Okay, I gave it 4 forks without using the exact recipe. I used a local store brand corn meal which was not coarse. I also added 3/4 stick of butter and canned diced tomatoes with chili spices (DelMonti). Using 6 cups of water, 1.5 cups of corn meal and adding salt made enough polenta to feed 4 families. I recommend 3 cups of water and 3/4 cup of corn meal. This recipe is a good starter. I recommend. Note: When you blend the corn meal with the liquid you are using, you must take some time when wisking the batter. The batter will continue to thicken. Last note: My experience with this recipe has given me the idea to use this as a substitute for eggs in a crustless quiche.

This is a good basic recipe to start with. You can customize this by adding more ingredients. My favorite is to use chicken broth for the liquid. At the end I add some fresh lemon juice, lemon zest, grated parmesan and chopped parsley. But you could add mushrooms, sundried tomatoes or other preferred ingredients.

I got mush. I refrigerated 24 hours!! I got mush. I wasted good food which is a real shame. Now I have to eat it for breakfast as a hot cereal with stuff added. This recipe could NOT have been made according to directions. I followed them exactly and the first part of it should have been a warning because you can't simmer solid globs. I used yellow cornmeal. This recipe is a waste of time & good food. My first try at polenta is not going to be my last - I'll go with a recipe that someone actually tried & succeeded.

This gets the job done, meaning it cooks polenta, but it is awfully bland. I added a little milk, some chopped garlic with the liquid, and a little butter, parmesan, and fresh basil at the end.

I make this all the time and we love it. Over the years I've used it a lot of different ways, but (to me) the best is just adding some butter, a little salt and some milk or cottage cheese (I know, it's strange but it's a personal preferance) and this makes a wonderful hot breakfast cereal. My mother told me that her mother made it for her and her 10 siblings. They were all from Latvia, and they came over in 1905!

A bit of not much on its own...i imagine it served with herbs and a flavorful meat would improve it... Add milk, butter, a grating cheese and some pepper sauce and things improve in a hurry... I also added sugar to a serving after cooking it, along with a teaspoon or so of nutella, and whipped it together...that was good.

great recipe, but there are some tricks to really make polenta creamier, adding milk and a little nutmeg are key to getting a great flavor. margorim is also a great bit to add.

Here(southern US) where "grits" are a staple,and cheese in them is normal.But "sugar!" ??? Whatever for darlin??? Ever tried them made into a loaf,preferably with sausage, fried,til golden on each side, served with syrup though? You should! The restaurant chain,"Bob Evans", serves them. Give a try when visiting.

Wonderful. This recipe is so easy to modify. Add some sauteed onions, garlic, or mushrooms, substitute broth for water, add meat or greens such as spinach, broccoli or mustard. Yummy

PUT SOME GRATED CHEESE, 2 SPOONS OF SUGAR AND 1 SPOON OF BUTTER IN THE POLENTA WHILE STIRING IT. DELICIOUS WITH FISH.
