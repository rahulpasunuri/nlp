Bland does not begin to describe this recipe. Took twice the amount of tomato paste, wine and a handful of spices culled from a good pantry to make it palatable. Will not make again.

Having researched many different recipes, Mario, Anne Burell, Lidia & others, I incorporated them all with this one as the base. Many call for paste, not puree or chopped tomatoes, even Mario has both versions. All in all, I used both paste and chopped tomatoes. Had to brown the meat (all 3 kinds) separately since my pot could not have held the meat & veggies while browning but it was still quite good. Not your mother's meat sauce! This is different, a taste that is of it's own, very good. Much left over so I stuffed some shells the next day and topped it with simple tomato puree and cheese. Very good. Will make again and not fear whose recipe will be the best since I know that the basic is where it starts.

This recipe was the guideline for my first attempt at bolognese and I must say, I will make it again! I made some changes to the cooking process which I firmly believe can make or break a dish. I believe in layering the flavors, giving each ingredient the time and care to do what they do best. After each ingredient had its deserved attention then was pushed aside to allow the next ingredient the "stage". For example, rendering the pancetta then deglazing with white wine. HUGE flavor builder, oh and a Tbsp of butter melted into the wine...yum. I let the meat set out to get the chill off of it (cold meat + hot pan= tough meat) and I cooked it over med low, gently folding into itself until just cooked through. I cooked the meats separately, building the flavor in both the veal and pork w/ S&P. (next time I will use beef as well). To build the sauce, I pushed all of the meat and sauteed veggies aside. I cooked down the tomato paste for a minute or 2, then wisked in ROOM TEMP heavy cream (otherwise it could curdle). I let that work together and bubble, then I wisked in 2 C white wine (no h2o- boring). I let that marry and bubble and blush on med low. Then I incorporated it all very gently. Added some crushed red pepper and S&P. Cooked uncovered on med- low for 2 hours. Covered on low for 6 hours. At the end I used a handblender to smooth out any lumps of meat. I added 1 cup red wine, thyme, parm cheese and let simmer, uncovered for 20 minutes on med low. Serve over pasta with basil and parm cheese. Voila!~

Like others, the first few times I made this I thought it lacked the appropriate flavor and firmness. I now make the following modifications and it's, well, incredible. Double the carrots (Ive started sautéing these in oil first, then adding the rest to make sure they get a little softer). 1.5 times the celery. At least double the garlic. Add at least a teaspoon red pepper flakes. Double the Pancetta. Double the Tomato Paste (I add the original, then add more as it cooks until its the color I want it). Sub Heavy Whipping Cream for Milk. Skip the water and add just a little more wine. At least triple the thyme  I usually use as much of a full thing of fresh thyme as I have the patience to pull apart. Add at least 8 oz shredded parmesan and/or asiago slowly towards the end  sometimes up to 16 oz. (Firms it up and adds flavor). Ive also made this with veal and bison instead of veal and ground pork and its good, but the pork is good too. Enjoy!

I made this sauce two nights ago and just finished up a bowl of leftovers that was as delicious as it was the first night. I made this recipe ALMOST exactly as written, because unfortunately, I read the reviews and watched Bitali's video once the sauce was already simmering. Whether this is an "authentic" bolognese or not, it tasted very much like those I've eaten in restaurants, only perhaps a bit better because it was less expensive, and I didn't have to tip the waitress. So I just added everything in the order specified and cooked for the time specified rather than letting each part reduce, and I can't say that it could have been that much tastier if I had. My market packages a meatloaf blend that has a third each of beef, pork, and veal, so I used two pounds of that for the meat and regular bacon because I already had an open package in the fridge. I cut all the veggies in the food processor, which cut down on prep time dramatically. Perhaps it was so yummy because I ended up letting it simmer for nearly three hours and added a pinch each of nutmeg and red pepper flakes at the end. All in all, less attention paid to it than some reviewers would argue for with a delicious result. I did serve it over homemade papperadelle.

Not knowing Mr. Batali and how deep his Italian food knowledge is, I will not make any negative comment about this recipe or him as a chef. I just wanted to say that, being Italian and living in Bologna, the city where the sauce comes from (hence the name Bolognese), I would advise people to check out some real Italian Bolognese sauce recipes. Where I live, we would NEVER EVER use milk, thyme, bacon or garlic. I would also point out that Bolognese Spaghetti are served everywhere in Italy or the world except for Bologna and Emilia Romagna. The American equivalent of Spaghetti Bolognese would be stuffed Thanksgiving Rabbit (which I do not believe is being served for Thanksgiving) instead of stuffed Thanksgiving Turkey.

I just made this recipe for the first time this evening, and it is a keeper! My husband, who is from N. Italy, and a total food snob, loved it. He said that it is very authentic and wonderful! Used pancetta, pork, and veal, and also used chicken broth instead of water. EXCELLENT! Please do yourself a favor, and use pancetta, it will make all of the difference.

This is one of the best things I have ever made - and I cook A LOT. What amazing depth of flavors. The one reason I hesitated on trying this recipe was that it only had 1 can of tomato paste and logically that didn't make sense being that its a red sauce. Trust me, it's fine. The wine, stock and milk make the sauce and the paste makes it a deep flavor. I changed a few things but I'm sure the original recipe is spectactular. My changes were I didn't use celery, used blend of pork, beef and veal that they package for meatloaf, used marsala wine instead of white (I forgot to buy) and used chicken stock instead of water. Some other people suggested and I followed of letting each liquid addition simmer for a while before I added the next (tomato paste then milk, then wine, then stock). I also sauteed the vegs separate from the meat. Also, I'm sure some would think I was crazy but I drained the cooked meat of some of the fat. Don't worry - it still has plenty of flavor. You know it was good if the first thought I had when my eyes opened this morning was "wow, that was really good Bolognese". It is truly high end restaurant quality.

Excellent! Can't belive there is a better recipe. After reading the other reviews. I cooked the veggies in a combination of olive oil and butter for 30 min. Had salted the meet ahead of time and then added the meet and cooked in the rendered fat for 1.5 hours, added the tomato paste and cooked for 30 min. Then added half and half cooked another 20 min lastly added the wine, chicken stock, thyme leaves, red pepper flakes, salt pepper and let reduce for another hour. Then added the cooked Pappardelle right to the sauce plated with grated parmigiano reggiano. Everbody loved it.

An exceptional recipe; the proportions are perfect, though the cooking times needed adjustment to become a truly velvety sauce: I doubled the recipe overall and subbed in some sweet fennel sausage and prosciutto for a portion of the pork and subbed chicken stock for the water; it was cooked it in two stages. On evening one, I rendered the meats with the softened veggies for a couple hours before adding the tomato paste and cooking an hour more. I refrigerated the base over night, and in the morning added the liquids (using light cream) in a crock pot to simmer all day on low. I skimmed off most of the coppery fat, made a rue of it, and thickened it slightly. I finished the sauce with thyme, generous black pepper, and a little bit of sweet balsamic (for brightness). Served with steamed/roasted broccoli rabe, a light garden salad, a rich chianti, and some fresh italian bread... fantastic!

This is an amazing sauce. The key is to take it slow. Let the meat render in the fat for an hour. Then add the tomato paste and let that all caramelize for 30 minutes, THEN the milk. It makes all the difference. Check out this video of mario making it himself! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqBqiGM1O54

My search for a delectable bolognese sauce is finally over! I have tries so many recipes and all have lacked flavor. I used my mini food processor to chop the veggies very fine, quick and easy. I only used just over a pound of meatloaf mix (combo of veal, pork and beef). I don't care for a whole lot of meat. A good pancetta is a must and finish off the dish with a good parmigiano rigliano. You're gonna love it!

This is my first review, so bear with me~ This sauce is delicious. I had to replace some meats (I live in the middle of nowhere), ground chuck, mild Italian sausage and half bacon/prosciutto. The key thing is, you MUST be patient. Do not follow the instructions after the meat cooks, but add the milk by itself. Let it simmer away and reduce, then add the wine. Let that simmer and reduce, then add the tomato paste, thyme and water (I used chicken stock that I had on hand) and simmer for a couple hours. And a pinch of nutmeg is lovely, added with the thyme. I've tried other recipes, varying on amounts of milk and wine, but this one is so much better. Just follow classic bolognese technique, not the 'dump and simmer' as described in this recipe. Time consuming, yes, but it made my knees weak.

I followed the recipe pretty precisely, using hamburger. I did add one small can tomato sauce and some Lawry's spaghetti seasoning at the end/ it seemed so bland. I would call this sauce one-dimensional, tho. It's smooth, not chunky, which I don't like so much. Tastes good but not great. I may be pedestrian, but I think I'll stick to Lawry's and canned tomatoes. Makes a more interesting spaghetti sauce.

11/8/09 Sunday 1 PM Made with plain Hormel Bacon this first time and ground beef. Veal was $20/Llb, hence the substitution. Didn't realize I could get pancetta at the grocery - next time! Used Chardonnay vs. a dry whiite wine, again, didn't want to make an extra trip. Homemade pasta and Mc Manis Petite Sarah - 2007 is planned for dinner tonight. First taste after making it: Quite sweet, not the tomato strength/depth I'd thought to taste. Needs salt, but holding off on that until the cheese is added on the served dish since the parmasan is pretty salty. Stay tuned... OK Here we are after dinner. Good wine choice. The sauce was kind of bland/sweet-added mucho salt and some red pepper flakes - that seemed to redem it. It seemed really white and fat and then we remembered "Mario Batali", of course it's gonna be white and fat!!! Maybe some fresh parsley and use it for a lasagne. Don't be gonna doin dis again!

I made this over the weekend and it was super easy and delicious. Since I don't eat veal I subbed in ground beef and it was fine. I also reduced the milk and water and used some heavy cream. Who cares if it's not THE recipe for Bolognese it's a delicious interpretation!

This is a terrific Bolognese recipe. While it's great as-is, we do make a few small adjustments.. I use 3/4 cup whole milk with 1/4 cup (generous) of cream as we prefer a slightly creamier taste. I usually add a little more veal and a little more tomato paste. And finally, (and what I really thinks makes the biggest difference) we cook it for a minimum of 2 hours. Richly flavored, easy to store and freeze - a huge favorite in our house! (And if you've ever been to Batali's Tarry Lodge - a very close approximation to what they serve, which is fantastic.)

this was a good recipe - lighter than you would expect, and very flavorful - and I would make it again with the following changes: 1) season the meat with salt + pepper at the time it is added, not at the end 2) use more white wine, less water 3) press the garlic, rather than slice it 4) use cream instead of milk, and add it before the wine so that it binds with the meat fat before you cut it with the acid

Perfect for a cold winter's night after skiing. Fried up slab bacon and then diced it since 2008 is the year of the recession and pancetta is expensive! Also, couldn't find veal up here in Winter Park so substituted ground beef. Really delicious. Used Pinot Grigio as the wine. Added a nice sweetness.

Love this. I didn't have all the ingredients and didn't want to use real meat so I substituted the meat with Morningstart Meat Crumbles. I also dry sauteed 2 portobello mushroom caps (cubed) to brown them and get rid of the liquid and added that after the meat crumble was all cooked. Then I used about 3 ouces of tomato paste and one can of whole plum tomatoes w/o the juice. I crushed and seeded the tomatoes. Used 2 cups of water since I didn't have wine and used dried thyme leaves. It still turned out great and hearty and w/o the meat/fat guilt. Will definitely make this one again. The whole recipe makes a lot of sauce that you can def freeze for later.

Bad, but quick version of a great sauce. This is how to change it... 1-sautee veggies in olive oil 2-add ground beef and pork 3-one meat is cooked add milk and let reduce (10 minutes-ish) 4-After milk reduces add wine to reduce. should be twice as much wine as milk; Let the wine reduce, about 15 minutes. 5- Add tomato base and one "bouquet garni" tied or in meat cloth 6-let simmer on very low heat for 90 minutes to 2 hours.

This is a standard in our home. I have found that when using slab bacon, it is best to cook it first to avoid having lumps of fat in the sauce (which is what I achieved adding the bacon / pancetta as written). For best results I brown the slab bacon / pancetta first, then cook the onion / carrot / garlic in the bacon fat instead of the oil.

This recipe lacks flavor. I added extra salt, pepper, thyme, and parsley and it still wasn't enough. Also, agree with other reviewers that the expensive meats probably weren't worth it. Next time I'll use regular ground beef, and regular bacon instead of that expensive pancetta. Also, in line with other reviewers' suggestions, I'll omit the water; add an entire can of peeled tomatoes and sauce; and use cream (1/2 amount) and red wine the next time. I'm sure it will be delicious then.

This is a great sauce- and fairly easy. Although I can only find the ground veal at one local gormet market, its worth the effort to find. I like to use a good red wine inplace of the dry white. I also add a can of tomato sauce. I love the flavor that the veal and pork give. This is an excellent sauce, I make it at least twice a month!

Skip this review if you're looking for 'authentic bolognese' and move along to the discussion below. Otherwise, read on: used 1 lb. beef and skipped the pork & veal. Didn't have tomato paste, used about a cup (or more) of canned strained tomatoes and skipped the water. Skipped the milk (because I didn't read the reviews until my sauce was simmering and I didn't know what the milk was for), and added a little cream at the end. No thyme leaves. Served w/ fettucini. Result was a delicious dinner with some good veges for my kids; my 2-year old had 3 helpings, and no complaints from the other 2, plus I really liked it. Don't bother to tell me this is just meat sauce, you're right, I know, but it was good meat sauce.

It's somewhat silly to imagine ONE single authentic recipe for the ragu that Battali makes here. That's sort of like saying there's ONE single authentic recipe for chicken soup. For starters, when the idea of the ragu originated, the Northern Italians didn't really use tomatoes or olive oil. The hearty dishes helped to keep them warm in the winter. So actually, red wine is often added to a lot of ragu's, but only if you're not using much tomato. On the other hand, many chefs in Italy these days split the fat between oil and butter to retain some of the 'authenticity' of the dish and give a more flavorful taste to the meats (veggies are sauted in oil, butter added when browning the meats). And as a side note, never cook any of the ingredients separately. The point of this ragu, and many others, is that the sum of all the ingredients is greater than the individual parts. Many nonnas throughout il centro and the surrounding areas will simmer there sauce in thick iron pots for 6 hours, letting all the ingredients fuse into one mouthwatering dish. Now, as for the pasta/sauce debate, as one reviewer pointed out, there's no right or wrong - it's a matter of what you like. The Italians tend to highlight their pasta, because it always tastes better than what we can get here. Even a sauce as hearty as the ragu is spread delicately over some papardelle or tortelloni. All the same, even in some restaurants in Bologna, you'll get a sauce-rich meal. Battali's got all the right stuff (the garlic is more of an American thing), just make sure to get good ingredients. That's what make the dish.

I think it's funny to say that this isn't THE recipe for Ragu Bolognese. Is there any dish that has solely ONE interpretation? It seems like even green bean casserole has its worthy variations. I have eaten Bolognese in Italy that was quite similar to this sauce-- I know that in America, we are looking for something as tangy as pizza sauce, but in Italy, pasta is the star. Sauces dress up the pasta, to enhance the pasta, in Italy. But here, we prefer to see pasta as a vehicle for transporting the sauce into our mouths. There is nothing wrong with either view; it's just a difference in perception. I recommend that you make your own changes so that the sauce suits your tastes-- then, you will have your own Bolognese sauce. I add plum tomatoes in large quantities and am liberal with the fresh oregano. And you don't even have to do the milk, although it does add an incomparable fullness to the dish.

I made this recipe, with a few exceptions, beef and veal instead of pork, omit olive oil(pancetta gives off enough fat to saute the veggies), chop the garlic, and reduce the tomato paste to 2 or 3 Tablespoons. Also, add the milk a little at a time during the 2 hours of simmering, and some cream at the end. You should be left with a wonderful thick sauce that is very rich and authentic! And it has just the right amount of garlic! Mangia!

The recipe is a good one and has an authentic taste. I prefer sauces made with beef rather then the pork and veal. One of the better recipes I have found for authentic tasting Bolognese is from Antonio Carluccio. I have never tried Emeril's recipe but mttempts to use his Italian recipes in the past have had less than sterling results. In reading the other reviews it seems there is a wide variety of tastes in Bolognese. Ameircans should remember this sauce is not meant to taste like tomato sauce with meat.

Rating: 0
Ok, I might as well jump in, too :-) The reason for adding the milk is to protect the meat before adding the acidic wine and tomatoes. Marcella Hazen's recipe for Bolognese is excellent. It doesn't have garlic in it, either..but I don't suppose garlic would hurt. Another thing that she recommends, which is very valid, is to salt the meat immediately upon putting it in the pan. The reason for that is to force the meat to release its flavor for the later benefit of the sauce. This is a very common method in Mexican cooking as well, where the sauce is the star, not the meat. She also uses whole tomatoes instead of paste and only 3/4 pound of meat and only beef. I like the idea of using pork and veal, I think it will yield a more flavorful sauce. I think I'll take the best of this recipe and use her techniques and see what I get! Oh, and Emeril has it even more backwards than this recipe does, he's adding the milk after the wine and tomatoes. The reduced cream should wait until the end, though. A lot of recipes call for cream or a bechamel added to bolognese to stretch it for lasagne and such. I don't think I'd use thyme or bacon, though...when done right, a bolognese doesn't need it.

WOW! I think I just stumbled into the Bolognese War. This recipe and the others like it certainly are pertpetuating a lot of heated discussion. I feel compelled to add my two cents. I have not yet prepared this Battali recipe, but I can tell you, I've tried the Sept 2002 Bon Appetit version and I will never use it again. It was greasy, not a good color and frankly it never thickened after two and a half hours of simmering. I finally had to add tomato paste. When I reheated the leftover sauce I was sure to add milk which got it a little closer to the real thing. I'll definitely try Mario's the next time I attempt Bolognese sauce. And by the way folks, if you ever have the chance to eat in a Mario Battali restaurant, you WILL believe that he is a food god.

I suggest the following changes: Eliminate the thyme;brown all of the meats in a separate pan and drain the fat,then add;do not use bacon, the flavor is too overpowering; use less salt and more pepper,to taste; key: add dried Porcini mushrooms and a bit of sugar.

This recipe is fairly accurate except there is NO garlic or wine in Bolognese sauce. A small amount of milk is added if it is to used in Lasagna alla Bolognese. More milk is added to stretch the sauce when used over tagliatelle. Also, chicken livers are used in addition to the meat but I have always omitted them.

So good! I made this when my three sisters-in-law came over for dinner; they are very picky eaters and not very adventurous, and they loved it!

I am pleased that Epicurious offers this site; otherwise I would never have tried this recipe. I wont say it was the very best thing I have ever eaten, however it was fascinating to make. It has a strangely peculiar flavor, very rich too. I read all the reviews, and enjoyed those! Made the one from Emeril, which is the most similar to this version. Cooking is an art, and this sauce offers a version of a classic that is well worth the time to experience. I will note that my child and husband (not exactly food snobs) remarked that it needed ketchup, ugh. My Mother loved it, and I enjoyed it. It is not spaghetti and meatballs; it is a version of a special recipe that is worthy of the experience (and fun to make).

I was faithful to this recipe and made it exactly as written and I wasn't crazy about it. For one thing, I did not like the color, and it could have had too much meat, (if that's possible).

And to the people saying real Italians would never use that much garlic, Mario B. is of Italian heritage and goes to Italy just to eat Italian food at least once per year. He makes his living trying to serve Americans real Italian food. So at least somebody in Italy must be using that much garlic in their sauce.///Never said he was a food god. I'm just surprised that people were saying _nobody_ from Italy would use that much garlic. whether Mario is a good cook or not I think he has as much right to determine what's Italian as people reviewing these recipes.

It's a shame that people feel compelled to review recipes they didn't even make. Please, exhibit some self control and refrain from commenting until you have tried the dish. The Bolognese sauce is delicious with any kind of pasta. I didn't try the Papardelle (so I won't review it)

To the cook from MA: just because Mario is of Italian heritage and ooh, goes to Italy every year, does not make him an Italian food god. I keep watching his show hoping that he'll make something that looks good and isn't covered in 2 inches of olive oil which he considers "guilding the lily". No, it makes things greasy, and I have yet to see something appetizing. I'm by no means saying that his recipes are wrong and not true Italian, so people, don't write hate mail about me, but he is not the be-all, end-all of Italian cooking. Plus he acts like a snob.

Wow! Seems like "bolognese" is the new kitchen buzz word! Check out "Pasta with Bolognese Sauce" (Feb. 1997). With the recommended additions, it makes an excellent sauce.

I have not made this bolognese yet, however, I wanted to recommend two other recipes to review before making your final decision. 1) This first recipe is rich and has less tomato than some recipes: Emeril Lagasse has a recipe for "CLASSIC RAGU BOLOGNESE", claiming that the recipe is the most typical and authentic-tasting rendition of the city's famed sauce, according to the Bologna chapter of Italy's gastronomic society, L'Accademia Italiana della Cucina. Go to http://www.foodtv.com and search. 2) As some people have mentioned, there is a recipe for "FETUCCINNE BOLOGNESE" by Mario Batali, from Babbo restaurant in NYC, available in the September 2002 issue of Bon Appetit magazine. You can find it here on epicurious.com at the following URL: http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=103894

I agree with Golden, CO--I haven't made this particular sauce, but the bolognese sauce recipe from Bon Appetit Sept 2002 is the best thing I've ever made!

I'm with the New Yorker, what is this North American obession with garlic in tomatoe sauce, a true Italian would never make a bolognese sauce with that much garlic!

I do agree with New York that it may be too much garlic, but I love the taste of slow cooked garlic, so I used it all. Don't hurry this sauce, let it meld into what it should be. Great as a pasta course, I thought it not bland at all. I would not use it as a main American Course.

To the cook from New York: this is not too much garlic. The sauce is cooked for over an hour, making the garlic more subtle. One clove wouldn't do much.

Wait everyone don't make this bolognese. Go to Bon Appetit's September 2002 issue. There is a recipe for pappardelle bolognese that is out of this world

Yikes, only an American would use 5 cloves of garlic in a bolgonese sauce. Where is your subtlety? And why bother tenderizing the veal and beef delicately in milk if you're just going to slam it with so much garlic. Only use one clove, that's more than plenty!

This is absolutely delicious and freezes very well. I wasn't ambitious enough to make homemade pasta, so I served it over fettucini. Delicious!
