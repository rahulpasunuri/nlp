Ok since epicurious doesn't let you change or update your review, I had to write another one. The cake tasted good the next day...when it had time to sit some time. But I still think the cake was pretty dry ....and i still think its too much work for the cake. As some other reviewer said, its a challenging cake. And you learn some new techniques. But will I make it again....well not likely....unless someone asks for it specially. But my friends loved it. So I came back to change my review.

First of all the cake is not worth the effort. For the amount of work that goes into it, it tastes blah. The cake is dry. I know its a sponge cake, but still its dry. The mouse filling is very runny especially on hot days. My cake layers were literally sliding down. I was not able to taste the hazelnut much. I worked on it for two days...and it was not worth it. Will not make again. I learned a lot of techniques though. I would rather have made a chocolate cake with ganache frosting.

Forgot to mention this took me around 10-11 hrs over two days. It's a "challenge yourself" recipe :-) Epicurious really should let us edit our own reviews :-P

Noted that some people said the sponge cake was dry so I only cooked it 12min (15 would have been far too long...I probably could have stopped at 10min). It's also important to assemble it and let it rest for 2 days...the sponge cake absorbs moisture from the mousse. Only thing I can complain about is the sides aren't pretty...you just can't get the ganache to stick very well even though the cake is frozen. Maybe if you chill half the ganache a bit, you might be able to stick it on the sides, but it's probably simpler to just take some chopped toasted hazelnuts and glue it to the sides. For the chocolate ganache, I used 8oz chocolate, 1c cream, 1TB corn syrup, and 2TB diced warm butter.

Delectable cake! I wanted to make this into a Buche de Noel for Christmas Eve so I used a "flourless chocolate souffle sheet cake" from Joy of Cooking. However, I used the ganache, mousse, crunch and glaze recipes as is and the combination of the flavors was amazing. I am a hazelnut-praline junkie and have been searching for a really great hazelnut-praline dessert for awhile. It worked great as a Buche de Noel. I brushed the sheet w/ a simple syrup flavored w/ Penzey's orange extract and then layered the nut ganache. Chilled in the fridge. Layered the mousse and let chill in the fridge. I rolled the sheet into a "log" and then chilled in the fridge for an hour or so. I also chilled the glaze in the fridge for 45-60 minutes in the fridge and it worked beautifully. I decorated the top of the buche de noel with the crunch and it looked just like bark! Yes the recipe is a bit time consuming, but it was JUST what I was looking for! LOVE IT! My guests also thought it was great!

I don't know if it's just me or if it's everyone else that got a super hard cake that tasted horrible. Just didn't work for me, used a different recipe. Hazlenut butter is lovely, praline crunch is all right. Cake, use your own recipe. Glaze use a different recipe. Too troublesome to make unless you have all the time in the world.

This brought the wow factor! It is a long process to make the cake, but if you do it ahead, crunch time isn't an issue. Blanched hazelnuts were impossible to find, so just toasted and rubbed off the skin. Also couldn't find hazelnut butter, so made my own (search epicurious for a recipe). As others noted, recipe doesn't specify to brush brandy over the top of the cake (not the side that was in the pan). Overall, a great cake to learn multiple techniques, and to show off once you are done! And really really delicious.

This cake is way too much trouble for the results. I would rather have a jar of Nutella on some chocolate cake for the trouble and time this cake takes. Recipe has some confusing terms.

Admittedly, I can't fairly review the complete recipe because I cobbled together chocolate praline crunch cupcakes instead of this exact cake. I did, however, make the chocolate crunch and the hazelnut mousse from this recipe, and both were heavenly. The only suggestion I would make is that if you're using organic puffed rice cereal instead of Rice Krispies, then crush them a little first. And reduce the amount of cereal. I somehow ended up with way more cereal than chocolate, and the crunch, while delicious, didn't come together too well. In the end, I made chocolate cupcakes from another recipe, frosted them with this hazelnut mousse, and topped each cupcake with a shard of chocolate crunch and a couple of toasted hazelnuts. They were a hit at the party I brought these to, and I even received a marriage proposal after a guest tried a cupcake.

This cake is a little too "fiddly" and complicated although impressive once cut. I made it for our cooking group, and the multiple steps took way more hours than it was worth. The "shards" could not be added until just before serving so the "look" was just that of a large chocolate loaf cake up to that point. I ended up serving it with praline- crunch ice cream and jutting the shards out of that. People all enjoyed the result. Two minor points: 1. the 17" x 11" sheet pan didn't fit easily on the shelf of my side- by-side Subzero; fortunately the sponge cake was solid enough that a little tilting to get it in was all right but frustrating by the third time in the freezer. 2. The instructions about brushing the cooled sponge cake with 1/2 cup of brandy or orange liqueur didn't specifically state that you had to flip the cake BACK over after removing the parchment and brushing the first side---the amount of brandy made it clear that must be the right technique.

This recipe would have rated 4 forks but for the glaze which did not set up properly. Even after an overnight in the frig it had the consistency of a sauce. I tried to compensate by freezing the assembled cake and applying layers of glaze with trips back to the freezer in between. Everyone loved the "crunch" garnish,which I will make even without hte cake. I would make cake again, but will look for a better glaze recipe

@ A Cook There is no recipe for Chocolate Glaze included in this recipe because it was separate in the magazine. Of course, no one would know this unless they had the actual magazine. The Chocolate Glaze recipe (from the same issue!) linked... http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Chocolate-Glaze-367733

okay...Is my computer playing tricks on me? or is there not a recipe for the chocolate glaze?
