I entered this cake into a cake contest and the judges were not really impressed. I tried it after the judging and found it tasteless and dry. I would not make this cake again. The most interesting part of the cake was the mascarpone frosting, but even that needed more clove, which I added in the process of mixing together the frosting. I put in 1/2 tsp. instead of the 1/4 tsp used in the recipe. My recommendation: Do not make this cake without trying it first.

Wow, what a cake! This will definitely be my go-to coconut cake from now on. And, yes, the ground clove was a great touch in the frosting. If you use fresh coconut, I think the cake stays moister longer? I baked mine 1hr 15 and checked, and it was already a clean center. I DID rush frosting it, though, due to time constraints, and the interior heat of the cake caused the frosting to run. So don't do what I did. It was still yummy, anyway, and I just scooped up the frosting and coconut garnish and applied as a shmear to my cake. Who needs presentation when it tastes that good? Actually, it's too bad I didn't take a picture of it when I first frosted it, as it looked really lovely; I chose to cover the entire top with the coconut arcs, as it looked neat from a geometric perspective. Enjoy...

To answer S. Central VA's question, the brown rind that stays with the coconut is completely edible and doesn't even affect the taste of the coconut. I'm trying to figure out why it is not normally used.....

Wow, this is great. I garnished this cake with hazelnuts and baked grated coconut in stead of using shaved coconut.

A question to those who have made this.....is the coconut really edible with the brown peel left on? I would think it would be tough. I might make some wide strips of just the meat, then lightly toast in the oven for color and flavor. Also, what about the cloves? I'm intrigued by adding that flavor to the party?!? I am definitely making this next time I have a cake occasion, but would love some feedback beforehand. Normally I would never dare to write without actually having made the recipe, don't wanna mess up the whole fork average and all that, but this recipe really puzzles and interests me. Thanks

This was great - the only change I made was instead of the milk I used coconut milk - it was rich and worth all the trouble.

Mine was a bit dry. i will cook it for less time if I try it again. The frosting was very good.

I just finished making this cake. It's too soon to review the results but it's hard for me to believe that it will turn out to be worth the incredible amount of work it required. Cracking and grating the coconut took over an hour. That's too much for a cake.

This cake is outstanding. It is very light and fluffy. The fresh shredded coconut really tastes better than the packaged kind. I added toasted macadamia nuts to the top for crunch.
