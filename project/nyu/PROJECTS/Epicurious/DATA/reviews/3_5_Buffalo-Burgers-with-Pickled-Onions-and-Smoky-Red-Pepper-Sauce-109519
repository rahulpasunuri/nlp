Made this again, still absolutely wonderful! The burgers don't need anything extra, the onions, sauce and arugula make them perfect. Tons of flavor and low cal!

No flavor whatsoever. The Jamaican Jerk Burgers that we had last week eclipse these!!! To add a positive point, the grilled onions were very good.

Our first experience with buffalo burgers, it was a fabulous recipe. I changed the sauce however. Per the suggestion of another reviewer, I used jarred roasted pepper, 1 1/2, put in the blender with 1/2 cup mayo, 1/4 cup buttermilk, lemon juice and pepper, it made a wonderful sauce for the burgers. Also we added a touch of Worstershire to the buffalo meat before making the patties. The pickled onions went well with all the flavors. A keeper!

My boyfriend and I made this last night and were astonished by how good they were. I was laughing to myself as I made the sauce because there was so much for two burgers (even after halfing the recipe since there were only two of us). But we ate it all. The sauce was so good I went back for seconds. We both thought it tasted like a healthier version of the big mac. SOOOO yummy. Two tips - BJ's carries great Buffalo meat and 2 - try the Thomas sandwich size english muffins, they worked perfectly! This one is definitely a keeper.

For some reason, it was kind of bland. I'm not sure why because I made it dead on following the recipe. Maybe it would be tastier with beef burgers.

The buttermilk dressing got such poor reviews that I substituted this recipe with very good results (2/3 c. buttermilk, 1/3 c. mayo, 1 t. lemon juice, dash salt, 1 t. finely chopped fresh rosemary or basil).

These were wonderful. I took the advice of the other reviewers and used bakery hamburger buns bought from whole foods and these burgers turned out great. I will definately make these again!

Haven't made this recipe, just wanted to say that Thomases' makes larger-sized English muffins for sandwiches. They might hold the burger a bit better.

I think the last commentator meant to say "substantial"--yes, a 1/4 lb burger is a bit much for an english muffin, especially with toppings added. Get bigger rolls, or make much smalled patties ^_^ Practical matters aside though, these are delightful.

Excellent but you need to serve these burgers on something a little more substitional than English muffins. We kept losing the toppings. Next time, I will try some hard rolls from the local bakery.

Ahhhh....Anchorage says "I rotate buffalo meat with ostrich, emu, rabbit, eel, possum, raccoon, and whatever other animal is fool enough to wander past my front porch" Yuck!

Great burgers! Making the roasted red peppers earlier saved time. The roasted red pepper sauce was a hit!

HEAVY, DO NOT LIKE THE TASTE. MIGHT BE IN THE HEAD AS I HAVE SEEN THE ANIMAL AND THEY ARE UGLY.

I used ground chuck instead of buffalo - after reading the reviews, I'm going to have to search out the buffalo. The smoky red pepper sauce was wonderful -- instead of smoked paprika, I used hot Hungarian paprika. I'll have to find some smoked paprika, since I'm seeing it come up in recipes more often these days. Serving burgers on English muffins is a nice touch, too -- good combination of flavors.

MMM, I just love a good buffalo burger! However, just to mix things up, I rotate buffalo meat with ostrich, emu, rabbit, eel, possum, raccoon, and whatever other animal is fool enough to wander past my front porch. If it's moving fast, it's bound to be extra-lean! Add a little onion and saute - yummy!

I had Hungarian paprika, and it tasted fine. Buffalo meat is pretty easy to find in our local grocery, and is pretty delicious. The onion was a bit too sweet for me, so next time I'll reduce the sugar.

Smoked Spanish paprika is one of the best spices I know of... you can also get it at The Spanish Table, for anybody who lives in Seattle. I think they're on line too. It's like four or five dollars for a tin that will last you a year. Definitely worth the money.

Yum! Easy recipe to follow. I didn't have the Spanish smoked paprika, used regular one instead. Just be sure not to overcook the meat as it's leaner than beef. Got buffalo burgers at www.Eurogrocer.com, got them next day, fresh and perfectly packaged.
