These are DELICIOUS. Maple syrup very expensive here, and buttermilk not too common either, but still good with the fake stuff and normal milk or yoghurt. Great with chopped jalepenos too

Double the eggs and add maple syrup, corn and cheddar cheese to it. Perfect.

My new favorite thing. I used Grade A syrup because I was in a time crunch and couldnt find Grade B but they turned out great anyway.

I just made these for my neighbors honey processing party (they raise bees). They went over like hotcakes. I took clues from previous reviews using two eggs & added a cup of corn to the finished batter. I used honey (from their hives) instead of sugar. Had to increase baking time to 23 minutes. I think that if the muffins weren't being served with butter and honey, that they could use a little more sweetness. Otherwise, they were very light and moist.

Just made these. My 10 year old loved them. I added a couple of tablespoons of honey to the wet ingredients as well as some frozen corn. Yum.

great recipe... I listened to the other reviews. I added an extra egg, a little extra buttermilk and a little extra butter. I also addded half a can of corn. They are moist and delicious. Next time I will add more sugar. Overall, a great basic recipe. I will start experiementing.

I substituted canola oil for one of the tablespoons of butter and substituted three tablespoons of maple syrup for two of the tablespoons of sugar. I also added about 1/4 cup sharp cheddar cheese. Turned out great -- moist and with just a touch of sweetness. Next time I will increase the maple syrup and cheese since both flavors were very subtle. I don't see a need for the maple butter -- which is why I went for the maple syrup in the batter.

I love these muffins, and they've been well received at every gathering I've made them for. This is the only cornbread recipe I use, with or without the maple better. Tonight I'm even planning to serve them alongside a spicy vegetarian curry. On occasion, I substitute molasses for the maple in the butter, which tastes incredible. Just keep in mind that molasses hardens in the refrigerator, so I would plan to make the butter right before serving, or allow it to come back to room temperature if you do make it ahead of time.

Amazing! The most tender muffins ever. Easy and delicious. Will make again and again.

Good, added an extra tablespoon of butter as per previous reviewer, batter/muffins still a tiny bit dry. I'd add another 2 tablespoons buttermilk next time, or measure my flour/corn meal a little on the scant side.

Note: The muffins will be better if you don't line the muffin cups with paper.

Not bad but not great. I would have preferred a more "corn" taste. Still, they're nice and tender, and I wouldn't mind making them again.

My "go to" recipe for entertaining! I use 2 eggs and add tsp. vanilla mmmmm My two daughter claim it as their own...but it is MINE...lol..

These were great and so easy! I made honey butter instead of maple butter, as that's what I had on hand, and it complimented the muffins quite well. I didn't have a problem with dryness as other reviewers mentioned, but I also pulled the muffins at ~13.5 minutes rather than the 15 specified in the recipe. I will definitely make these again

Substituted self-rising flour (my baking powder is dead) and corn flour, and baked for 14 minutes as a previous reviewer recommended. They were excellent-- moist, cake-like crumb.

I have made these about five times now, and they have been a hit every time. I like to pair them with braised meats or some kind of savoury saucy dish. If you aren't doing that, they do need the butter spread to retain moisture. But the flavour is simply wonderful. The last time I made them, i used a little extra butter in the batter and it made them just moist enough. My boyfriend is an experienced chef and he loves them.

Quick and tasty. I made mini muffins (24 yield) and baked at the same temp for 10 minutes. The butter was good as well, but next time I would pair these with honey butter instead.

I made mini-muffins and baked them 10 minutes. They were perfectly done (and completely pale). They might be a little bland without it, but with the maple butter they're delicious!

Delicious. I am going to make these all the time!

This is a great go-to recipe for cornmeal muffins. You could reduce the sugar if you're looking for a less-sweet muffin, but I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be a perfectly suitable accompaniment to a savory dinner. If you're looking for something that has the feel of a typical, oily blueberry muffin, this is not it, but I didn't find these to by dry or crumbly at all, as some other reviewers have reported.

Excellent cornbread, good flavor and very moist (But be sure not to overbake given they are so light in color! I baked mine 14 mins) One substitution -- didn't have buttermilk so used 1 c milk + 1 Tbsp lemon juice (mix and sit 5 mins before adding). Yum!

Good texture. Bad taste - bitter aftertaste. Maybe my corn meal was too old (6 mos or so?). Used brown sugar instead of white. No maple butter. Family didn't like 'em.

p.s. I didn't bother making the maple butter - I prefer them savory!

Mmm, I'm enjoying one of these right now, warm from the oven. They are super easy and quick to make, and are very tasty! I modified the recipe by adding a few tablespoons of shredded sharp cheddar, and about a teaspoon of herb de provence to the dry mixture; I also substituted oil for butter, as I didn't have any. They are light and moist!

Made these for a party and they were a huge hit. The maple butter definitely gives it that yummy taste.

I made these for Super Bowl Sunday to go with Chili and it was very simple to assemble and I a used mini muffin pan to bake them and reduced the baking time to 12 minutes. They were moist, but needed the maple butter to enhance the flavor. I will definitely make again.

Good flavor, slightly crumbly. I have made these twice and each time I was only able to get 10 muffins instead of 12. Oh well, just less for me to eat I guess!

We're quite picky about cornbread, and these were delightful. They are indeed pale, so any "dry" results as previously noted may have been from overbaking. Didn't make the maple butter (was looking for a quick bread to go with some soup last night), they'd probably be even better with it.

I found this recipe because my husband likes his cornbread slightly sweet. I was hesitant, because I don't, but these turned out extremely well. Perfectly moist and fluffy, I didn't even make the maple butter for them.

Rating: 4
These turned out perfectly - moist and not crumbly. The maple butter is critical - without it the muffins would be too bland and not sweet enough. Make 1/2 the maple butter - the amount is way too much for one dozen muffins.

Rating: 4
I think the other cooks overcooked the muffins. I have made these quite a few times and every time they are moist and flavorful. I also make the maple butter. It adds a totally different taste to the muffins, or you can do plain butter. Either way they have always been a HUGE hit!

These were dry and didn't have much flavour. Easy to put together though.

This made excellent cornbread, but I do recommend cutting the sugar to 2 TBSP and throwing in a diced jalpeno and a can of sweet baby corn - delicious!

I wasn't a huge fan. Sweeter corn bread is better. I didn't make the maple butter, I'm sure that would've helped the taste.

Good basic corn muffin recipe. Don't use muffin cups and the edges get nice and crispy from the oven. Didn't use the maple butter.

These were fantastic. Quick to assemble and the maple butter was a huge hit. I'll be making this again for serving on pancakes.

I think they are great, though a bit dry. However, not too oily like many corn muffin recipes.

I've tried a few different corn muffin recipes, and I like this one the best. Pretty easy and very tasty, not crumbly. The maple butter is excellent, but the quantity is a bit much. Leaves leftover butter for pancakes tho.

This were very good. I did not prepare the maple butter. Just spread some butter on the muffins and drizzled with maple syrup.

I thought these were awful. The recipe makes way more maple butter than you'll possibly use.
