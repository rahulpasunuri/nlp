From the first time I made these wings they were a big hit. For almost a year they were requested every sunday and they always disappeared. After making them so many times I would suggest that they are turned a couple of more times than the recipe calls for. Make sure to baste them every time you turn and they will come out sweet and sticky and delicious! These are my go to wings, even though they have to be tended to so often it is well worth the effort.

Had to make peach jam from peaches I had around but, since jam is easy, it wasn't much effort. I totally forgot about the soy sauce so, if I had included it, this would have probably been less sweet. But it was very good and was definitely a hit with my 6 year old granddaughter.

I've made this recipe 4 times and every time it gets better and better! Use plenty of jelly to make the sauce stick, kick up the heat with more red pepper and don't go crazy with the soy or you'll cover tanginess of the garlic, ginger and peach. It usually takes me about an hour in the broiler (I broil low and turn those wings often re-basting as many times as possible) instead of 25 minutes as the recipe suggests. If you do up right and trust your gut, there's never anry leftovers and everyone asks you to make it again!

These wings were really yummy but I gave it two stars for the amount of doctoring I had to do to get them there. I also used Alton Browns wing prep method of steaming, chilling then roasting. foodnetwork.com. I didn't toss them in sauce until they had roasted for 10 minutes. Then I found the sauce to be too thin, so I reduced it down and put more sauce on the wings after another 10 minutes and left them in for another 5 until they were all roasty and sticky. In the sauce, I put in some fish sauce to the 2/3 of soy sauce, this gave it a fantastic funkiness that you couldn't quite put your finger on. I used tangerine juice instead of water, I added about a teaspoon of siracha for extra spice. In the end, my husband said they were the best wings he had ever had, and he's a chef to my cook, so good doings. Finger licking good. I used the extra sauce that I reduced for dipping that that just put it right over the top. If I were to do a fancy presentation, they would have been fantastic with some cilantro and tangerine zest.

This sauce is a winner. I added the juice from one 1/2 orange to the other ingredients in the blender, to give the dish a little citrus kick. I also sprinkled the chicken with pieces of fresh orange peel before broiling, which made it a nice presentation. I have a feeling the leftovers will be good, too!

The flavour of the sauce was nice. Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't keep the sauce on the chicken. While cooking it got runny and basically slid off, leaving the chicken bare. I think I might try the advice below about cooking the chicken first, then adding the sauce after. It certainly didn't end up looking like the picture.

I LOVED this chicken, and I am planning on making again soon. I made for 4th of July dinner with the Salt & Vinegar Potato Salad, and it was a really great mix of flavors. I also used chicken thighs and drumsticks, because that is what I had, and my husband and I loved both.

Ssssoooo yummy! I skipped the hot red- pepper flakes b/c I don't like hot things,but this was superb. I just about took a spoon and ate the sauce on its own it was so good.

After reading previous reviews, I decided to use Alton Brown's buffalo wing cooking method: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/good-eats/buffalo-wings-recipe/index.html I lacquered the wings after 20 minutes in the oven, and then again after another 10 minutes. Crispy skin, tender meat, and the sauce is excellent!!!

My parents and little sis visited from 4 hrs away, and this was the perfect entree. I used a little less garlic and more soy sauce. After broiling both sides, I knocked down the heat to 325 for about 45 minutes but still basted 3 times. They weren't as charbroil looking, and it made them tender and done. Potatoes and zucchini with ranch dressing made the meal complete! Everyone fell in love with this. Thanks a mil.

I followed the recipe to the letter. The sauce burns fairly quickly, so turning the wings over several times was necessary. Even so, they were not cooked all the way. Maybe splitting the wings at the joint might help, but I doubt it.

Ok I did not follow the recepie as described. I made my own jam. I used apricot and peaches. To no avail. The flavors didn't pop. I'll do them again as directed/ Hmmm :/?

These wings were quick and easy, however the aromatic flavors were almost nonexistent once I tried the chicken. The chicken was juicy and moist, but next time I'll try adding more peach preserves and hot sauce.

From someone who is a foodie, as well as a chicken wing afficiando, these wings definitely were a disappointment. My husband, who is also from upstate NY and knows good chicken wings, couldn't even finish my dinner. He thought, and I agree, the sauce was way too runny, lacked flavor and simply didn't stick to the wings. I followed the recipe as described, but the sauce was way too thin and the flavors just didn't pop as you would expect. Very disappointing. I am going to pass on trying to perfect the recipe as it's simply not worth it.

Very easy. My guests loved them.

OK these were good wings with this sauce, and we made them as the recipe called. The Poker guys and i agree though, another way to do these is to cook the wings your favorite way first (as in grill them with mesquite or hickory or other) while they are cooking put the sauce in a pan and bring to a simmering boil, remove from heat and pour into a large bowl. Add the wings coat them in the bowl and serve em up. This way the sauce stays on the wing more and you get two taste rewards rather than everything tasting like sauce. Try em both ways and you decide.

The flavors all meld together nicely, tho I do agree the sauce is quite runny. I might try again without adding water.... I used a smaller piece of ginger (about 1.5 inch) and I thought that adjustment was perfect. Make sure to use a good soy sauce...

Fast, cheap, easy, and delicious! My toddler says: "These are my most favorite chicken wings I ever had!"

the ingredients all sound great together but in reality the marinade was very runny and didn't stick much to the wings. Flavors were not bold enough for me. Also, I used very large wings but there is a lot of skin on those--maybe that's why the flavor didn't pop. Thinking about playing w/ the recipe to make it more of a basting sauce than a runny marinade.

Delicious! Couldnt wait to try this recipe - I love chicken wings. This did not disappoint. I chose to let the marinate over-night in the glaze, with about 1/2 C reserved, then once they were done cooking I tossed them in the reserved sauce to recoat. Wonderful.

I got everything to make them & then started thinking that pureeed chipotles would be nicer than the flakes to give heat & smokiness. I decresed some of the soy sauce. They were awesome.My husband loved them!I maded them again for a swimming party & everyone loved them.I"ll be making more of these.
