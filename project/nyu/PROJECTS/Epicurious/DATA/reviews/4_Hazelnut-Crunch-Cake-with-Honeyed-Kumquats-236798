This cake is spectacularly delicious; perfect sweetness with piquant kumquats, and soft, creamy, crunchy textures. And gorgeous. It took about 5 hours to make, requires a LARGE flat platter to hold the 5 1/2 inch by 12 inch cake, and serves at least 16 (more like 20 adults after dinner).

This is every bit worth the extensive effort - I made this for our son's first birthday party, and everyone voted that this should be a regular tradition; several of my friends were amazed that I had actually followed a recipe completely, as I am fairly experimental, but their admiration for the recipe meant that much more! Also, I doubled this recipe to accommodate the number of guests, so did two panfuls to equal four larger layers, and I think that made it just that much more impressive to our guests. Anyway, I will have to find "excuses" throughout the year to make this again and again, as it is the most unique and delicious cake I have ever had (also, the best cake ever, per several of our friends)!

Simply amazing! The prep for this cake is laborious. But...TOTALLY WORTH IT. Layer upon layer of flavor and a delectable combination with the hazelnuts (my personal favorite), mascarpone, and kumquats. I made it for new year's eve and we had a ton left over and it was even more tasty with each passing day. Two thumbs up!

Very tasty; sort of an unusual spice cake--the nut crunch between the layers was great, and the frosting is sublime. One note: I may be the only obtuse person out there, but the recipe doesn't actually direct you to peel the kumquats before you stew them. I didn't, and once I did, I thought they were a bit mushy and worried the flavor would have stayed in the peel and not in the fruit. When I redid them, however, I didn't think it made much difference either way. They didn't look as pretty as in the photo. Oh well. I repurposed my extra kumquats in the Spicy Pork and Kumquat Stir Fry recipe also on this site.

This was the BEST CAKE I ever made. And it's not even chocolate!

The cake was a little time consuming but SO WORTH IT. My whole family rated this cake as one the best ones they have ever had. I will be making this often, it was so good it was gonne within minutes because everyone had seconds.

Correction to the below review, I meant that I baked this in two cake rounds instead of the suggested pan sizes. If you are considering this recipe, go for it!

I agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers. This cake takes a good while but is beyond yummy and very pretty. This is the best dessert I have made from this site and everyone at our Christmas pot luck was really, ahem, quite impressed. I made it in 2 rounds which took about 28 minutes to bake. I had about a cup of hazelnut crunch leftover which we are using on ice cream. Also, my crunch never turned a dark amber so it was less caramelized. The recipe instructs you to turn the heat up on the suger/water mix but does not tell you how high.

This cake is really time-consuming and involves expensive ingredients and a lot of steps, but damn if it isn't delicious! And very gorgeous, too. I ran short on frosting but that's where covering the sides with nuts comes in handy. This cake still tastes good on the 2nd and even 3rd day. If, like me, you're not too keen on really rich, chocolatey desserts, this is a wonderful alternative, and a real show-stopper.

Really like this cake. It's easy and delicious. I made two accommodations for friends who don't like liquor: the frosting w/o the cognac and served the kumquats on the side. Next time, I'd stew the fruit w/o the wine so that I could put it in the cake. The icing was fine without the cognac. I was a little concerned that the cake might be overly sweet because of the carmel/nut mixture & the kumquats but it wasn't at all. Final comment - I think this serves more than 10. The cake is fairly dense and a large piece seems unnecessary. I could see serving as much as 20 by cutting the cake down the middle to get two pieces per slice.

My best friend is a chef, and she chose this recipe for my wedding cake as a gift. It was AMAZING!! Everyone raved that it was the best wedding cake they had ever had, and I even got calls from two friends who were getting married the same year to see if I minded that they copy my cake. It was made as a three tier cake, the top of which, I froze. My 1st year anniversary just passed, and my husband and I ate the top. We were hesitant because how good can year old cake be? But I tell you, it was still incredible.

I made this for a Christmas party, and everyone was very impressed. It is quite involved but worth it both for taste and appearance. I found that smaller kumquats worked better for the flowers on top.

I started this three days before (candying the kumquats and making the hazelnut brittle), which made the task manageable. For once, my cake actually looked better than the picture in Bon Appetit. Guests took photos with their cellphones.

I found it hard to make the kumquats look like the picture. This apparently takes technique I haven't mastered yet, but it still looked good. Three layers made the cakd too tall. I would do it again but with two layers.

This is, indeed, a very involved process, but it is worth the effort. The "presentation" value is incredible. I used toasted almonds, and it worked well. This is a rather sophisticated dessert, and won't appeal to everyone. I will make it again for the appropriate occasion

This is quite a complicated recipe and took most of an afternoon to prepare. When I make it again I will prepare the hazlenuts and the honeyed Kumquats ahead of time and then just make the sponge on the day of eating and then just place the filling. As it was I mixed the wine mixture and the minced kumquats together. When completed this really does look a spectacular dish indeed and the comments from friends made the time spent worthwhile! Lovely, subtle flavours great with either dessert wine or a cup of espresso.
