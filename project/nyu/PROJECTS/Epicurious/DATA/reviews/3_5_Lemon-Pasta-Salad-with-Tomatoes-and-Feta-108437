It was quick and easy. I added some chopped fresh spinach into the mix, which was nice and colorful. The taste, however, was somewhat bland. I would double the dressing next time.

I made this recipe for our supper club. The theme was "lemon" and even if it was -20 celsius outside and January, not bbq season at all, I decided it would be a nice salad. Everyone loved it. I used feta marinated in herbs and spices (brand name Apetina) and used yellow bell peppers. I also added flat leaf parsley. Very colourful and excellent lemon taste, not to strong.

I love this salad and so do my husband and guests. I've made it exactly as written and it's great. But it's also good with other additions; like broccoli florets added to the pasta pot in the last 2 minutes, or cooked chopped chicken or turkey breast. My husband and I often have this salad as a one dish meal; yummy!

Just made this as close to writen as possible. Did not double dressing and had plenty as it's quite flavorful. We ate as a main dish with a side green salad. To keep it kid friendly I added green beans, peas and left over chicken. It was delish! Would do again with whatever is on hand and look forward to the leftovers for lunch tmrw.

This is my "go to" pasta salad. As written, it is delicious and easy. I like to add blanched asparagus to it for color.. and because I like a lot of veggies in my salads. It is a good idea to give it time to mellow and the flavors to blend. Always a hit!!

Another favorite of mine! The first time I made it, I did add extra lemon juice and mustard as some suggested, but my friends thought it was way too strong. The next time I made it I followed the directions to a tee, and they loved it. it's great to have in the fridge in the summer, like most pasta salad recipes, this makes a lot, so you can eat it over 2-3 days. lately I've been adding chicken, and it's even better!

Got lots of compliments on this recipe! I reduced the amount of mustard to 2 Tbs and it seemed just right. I also omitted the grated lemon peel to simply things. It still tasted very lemony. Am planing to make this again.

This was quite good, but too onion-y. Next time I'll reduce the onions by 2/3 to 1/3 cup. It's better in general after it marinates for at least a day.

I made this recipe for a BBQ and it was loved. I was asked for he recipe twice I added a little more lemon juice, lemon peel and garlic than the recipe calls for. Yummy pasta salad and well liked by many different people.

I first made this almost exactly as written - I used orange and yellow bell peppers instead of red, for more color. (I also increased the dressing a little bit as other reviewers suggested.) It was delicious - I got lots of complements. I made it again this morning with cheese tortellini instead of the penne pasta. I left out the feta since there was cheese in the tortellini, but now that I'm tasting it, I wish I had put it in, I miss that feta taste. I also forgot to put in the grated lemon peel and I miss that taste too. I recommend that you try this exactly as written and then decide how you want to change it. It's a recipe you'll make more than once.

I am not much of a cook, but this was simple to make and really delicious! I used multi-colored rigatoni instead of penne. Next time I am going to try sun-dried tomatoes instead of cherry and maybe some fresh basil. I didn't feel the need to make extra dressing (as some have suggested), as it was pretty moist already. I used grainy Malle dijon and found the mustard taste a bit strong. I would probably cut down a little on the mustard next time. Other than that, it was really visually appealing and yummy! :)

I would give this 2.5 stars if I could. A great idea - greek salad on pasta! I added a bit more olive oil to make it less lemony and doubled the amount of dressing, as many prior reviewers did. I also added oregano and olives. The possiblities are endless. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
as many other reviewers have mentioned, this is better if you double the amount of dressing. i used an orange bell pepper instead of the red since the tomatoes are red, it made a very pretty salad! i also used farfelle instead of penne and added a bit of fresh italian parsley. very light and fresh and summery, great for a backyard bbq!

I have made this salad a few times and it is always successful. You definitely need to double the dressing, otherwise its a bit on the small side. I find it helpful to use half the dressing right away and then let it sit for a while and put the rest of the dressing on top. I have added olives and shrimp. Wonderful!

Made this with fresh parsley, added some parmesan cheese, and used whole wheat penne - delicious!! I actually made 4 lbs of whole wheat penne pasta and guesstimated on the other ingredients. Took it to an outdoor BBQ and left there with a completely empty bowl! After I initially tossed the salad, I let it sit in my fridge for 2-3 hours, then mixed in the feta, parmesan, and parsley once we arrived at the BBQ. The lemon flavor was strong at first, but after sitting in the fridge for a couple of hours, all of the flavors melded and the lemon calmed down quite a bit and was nice and refreshing. Definitely use freshly squeezed lemon juice for this!

I made this for an office picnic and received rave reviews. Because I only had green pepper, rigatoni and grape tomatoes, I substituted those in lieu of the red pepper, penne, and cherry tomatoes (I had all the other ingredients and used them per the recipe). Regardless, the recipe is likely to be well received no matter if you use the ingredients in the recipe or have to substitute.

Rating: 4
This was so good. I used gemelli pasta because I don't like penne. I didn't put all the green onion because I thought 1 cup is excessive but I put too little. It does need some green just for color. This pasta is really light and refreshing.

Fresh lemon juice and zest give a freshness to the salad. Took to an outdoor gathering today for the first birthday celebration of our grandson. I packed it in a gallon freezer bag to transport, adding the feta cheese prior to serving. So easy to take to a gathering like this. I made it the night before. Heard positive comments about salad and its dressing.

I revisited this recipe yesterday after recommending it to an Epi forum friend, and this time made it as written, with just the addition of some dried mint & oregano to the dressing. I used a full pound of beautiful multi-colored rotini, but did not increase the other ingredients. At first I thought, oh no - it's too lemony! But after letting the dish sit in the fridge for an hour or so, found that it was just right. Enjoyed as a side with dinner last night, and will dig in for lunch today. Perfect flavor, and gorgeous colors.

I loved this pasta salad! It's very lemony, but it's not tart. It tastes very fresh. I used sugar snap peas (cut into small pieces) instead of the red bell pepper and it was fantastic. It provided a lot of crunch. I will definitely make this again.

Yum! Just made this to take to a Memorial Day BBQ tomorrow, and it is delicious. The lemon dressing adds a nice zing. I used whole grain dijon mustard, and it came out great. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I notied other reviewers used other color bell peppers besides red to change up the color mix a bit, but it doesn't need it - with the red peppers and the green onions, it's defiinitely colorful. I hope that, as the other reviewers said, it's even better the next day!

This pasta salad is highly recommended. My family loved it. I used corkscrew pasta, however, which I thought worked better. Also, make extra dressing. The amount called for in the recipe gets absorbed and it turns out dry.

Quick and easy. The mustard makes the flavor of this salad stand out from a lot of other pasta salads. Go easy on the garlic, because it's raw the flavor is strong (and I love garlic). I ended up adding more tomatoes and peppers as it seemed a little pasta heavy.

Okay. It really bugs me usually when people change pretty much everything about a recipe and then trash it or sing it's praises. BUT I just HAVE to give this recipe four forks for being the starting point for a pasta that my kids' dad told me was the best I've ever made. And that's after hearing him praise me cooking for twenty years. This is a little labor intensive, but bit excessively so and totally totally worth it. I posted my modified recipe in the member recipe section.

A light and refeshing basis for a summer pasta salad, with some tweaks to personalize: added some dried mint and oregano to the dressing, as this is how I do a classic Greek salad; used roasted red peppers instead of fresh, sun-dried tomatoes instead of fresh (only 1/2 cup), and also added some chopped Italian parsley, as Middle Eastern dishes are also replete with parsley. Upon tasting the dressing alone, I thought the whole grain mustard would be too strong and obvious, but in the finished dish, it's just right.

I've made this one twice now. Great for BBQs. It has been very successful. The lemon makes it particularly special. Try using yellow grape tomatoes instead. The contrast with the red peppers and green onions is very Summer-y! I also use an extra smooth goat's fetta. My friends love it.

Great recipe!!! It really would benefit from the addition of another clove of garlic and a bit more lemon zest. Also, I cheated and used a whole 16oz. box of pasta to feed a large group, but the dressing was spread far too thin, so don't make the same mistake because it compromizes the flavor and texture.

I'm not sure how other reviewers say this lacks flavor. Between all the lemon, garlic, mustard (I use a GOOD stone ground mustard)and onions, I'd say it has plenty of flavor. I've made this twice pretty much as written and I've had people rave and ask for the recipe both times. I have to admit, I may go a little heavier on the garlic, lemon and pepper but I think this recipe rocks. The last time I added chicken and marinated artichoke hearts - yum! Definitely make it the night before your event, if not 24 hours before. It gets better the longer it sits.

A friend originally made this recipe for my birthday potluck last weekend. Since then, I've made it 2 times now, once for myself and once for a work party, which the salad took center stage! At first look of the recipe she was making, I worried about the lemon. That night the salad was good, but after allowing the salad to sit overnight, the small amount of leftovers were fabulous! My only recommendation is to allow an overnight sit before serving, if you don't like the stronger lemon. Otherwise, this was wonderful!!

I added yellow bell peppers for a little extra color and let it sit in the fridge overnight before taking it to a pitch in.

A nice salad and very pretty to look at, but it definitely needs something to help tone down the brightness and acidity of the lemon and mustard dressing. Something sweeter and earthier would be good -- maybe adding honey to the dressing recipie, and some sundried tomatoes, caramelized onions or even mandarin orange slices would help.

I love this pasta because it is fairly healthy and very simple to make. I like mustard and lemon so this is one of my favorite dishes.

I never got to taste any, so I'm not giving a number! I made this for my kids' school picnic. I did use a green bell pepper, partly because that's what I had (the reason I made this recipe was that I had all the ingredients, and didn't require a trip to the store!), and partly for color contrast. My son did taste it when he checked for salt and pepper, and said it was "really good". By the time I got to the food table, it was gone.

Talk about twisting a recipe. I had zucchini and yellow squash I wanted to use with a light pasta salad recipe. The dressing on this one appealed to me.

I'll be taking it to a barbeque in about an hour and hopefully others will agree with me!

Nothing extrordinary, but that's not always what I'm looking for on a rushed weekday evening anyway. Kept well, and tasted as good or better the next day.

I used orange cheery tomatoes unstead of the red ones, and it is pretty lemony--doesn't need the grated lemon peel unless you have time to do it. Quick, easy, and quite tasty! Thumbs up, way up--it is a keeper!

Milano, What does pasta have to do with being Italian. We loved this resipe.

Lighten up, Milano. If the rest of us can risk something out of the ordinary in pursuit of a good meal, then so should a "born and bred" Italian like you. I tried this tonight and it's great on it's own, but also ripe for variation as others have shown. Mangia bene.

The idea of pasta with dressing doesn't appeal to me at all. Having been born and raised in Italy I have tried over a 100 different pasta recipes. The ingredients of this recipe are wonderful over romaine lettuce or rice maybe.

This recipe rocks!! But of course I twisted it. I added grilled chicken, sun dried tomatoes, roasted peppers, and avocado. Yummy! With a best friend and a bottle of great BC red wine!!

My familly loved it! It is a great summer dish. I added black olives and fresh chopped basil, and instead of regular feta, I added tomato basil feta cheese. It was awesome!

This is an excellent pasta salad, and serves as a perfect side dish to just about any summer meal. I added some green bel peppers for some color, and olives gave it a great added touch. Make a little extra sauce than what the recipe calls for to prevent the pasta from getting too dry.
