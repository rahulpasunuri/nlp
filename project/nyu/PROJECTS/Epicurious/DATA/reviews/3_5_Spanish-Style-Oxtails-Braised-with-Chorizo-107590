Excellent recipe, I did ask extra chorizo and some of the other people suggested. This is definitely a rich recipe, I would a lighter side of vegetables. We served with mashed potatoes and a full bodied cabernet sauvignon, worked beautifully.

This dish was absolutely perfect! I used real Spanish Leon Chorizo from a local Spanish deli as well as Spanish smoked paprika. The oxtails and chorizo make such a good mix. I can't wait to make this one again.

I have made this dish plenty of times and every time it tastes even better....I served it to my father when he came to visit from Puerto Rico and he said that it was the best ox tail stew he has ever had aside from his mothers.....I COULD HAVE NOT GOTTEN A BETTER COMPLIMENT IF I PAID FOR IT MYSELF!!!! I have been lucky to have been raised with such wonderful cooks....

My husband is from Colombia. He has very high standards for food and judges dishes without mercy. Kind of a Spanish Chef Ramsey.Loved the recipe. It it's used for special occasions and to impress. We buy Colombian Chorizo at the local Colombian store. It is handmade and is much better than any packaged spanish chorizo you will find.Really GOOD

Very savory. I only had smoked paprika, which can overpower a dish, so I used half a teaspoon and added a couple of diced piquillo peppers. Served it with saffron rice. Despite three and a half hours in the oven, the chorizo was still on the chewy side.

This was quite tasty but I ended up following the roasting pan route rather than keeping it in a Dutch oven. I put the oxtails in a baking dish and sealed it off with foil but I don't think this created the slow braising environment that the oxtails needed. The foil didn't create a strong enough seal and the oxtails didn't get to that 'fall apart on your plate' level of tenderness. It was tasty but I would not say this is the best recipe for oxtails that I have tried. The Chinese star anise recipe on this site is much much better. I'd try this again though. The flavors were good.

This recipe is awesome. We used short ribs instead of oxtail, as the store was out. Based on the previous reviewer who used fresh chorizo from Whole Foods, we also went that route as we had some around. I was a little concerned that the long cooking time would dry out the fresh vs. cured sausage, but it didn't. Great recipe overall. We'll probably make it in the future without the short ribs and eat it over pasta or whole grains. Four forks for sure.

I just made this for a dinner party with friends and they loved it. I threw in more chorizo than the recipe called for (abt 1/3-1/2 lb chorizo, though you could probably get away with more) because I absolutely love the stuff, and it turned out just fine -- in fact I think it added more to the overall flavor of the dish. Would definitely make this again.

After searing and sauteeing, I cheated and used a slow cooker, so the dish would be ready for guests without much after-work- effort. The meat fell off the bones, and the sauce was rich and hearty (if not a tad too fatty). Overall this was a great succes and suprisingly easy.

Made this recipe as we love oxtail but are bored of the regular red wine stew recipes that are usually out there. This was absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe and the chorizo really adds something special to it. Would definitely make again!

Made this for New Year's Eve dinner and it is delicious. I used fresh Whole Foods chorizo and more than twice the amount called for. This makes a rich, thick, chunky sauce that stands up on its own. I've been making braised oxtails with red wine for years, but this beats all recipes I've tried before.

Made this last night using beef short ribs as I could not find meaty oxtails. Really loved the chorizo and smoked paprika flavors. I followed the recipe exactly and found the cooking time to be a little too long, as the meat was on the edge of burning and most of the sauce had evaporated, but all in all would definately make again just not cook as long

A perfect combination of flavors. I used vermouth and subsituted the chorizo with a link of sweet Italian sausage. It was tangy enough at the end to leave out the sherry vinegar, and if I made it again I probably wouldn't use it, since it tasted so perfect without. Fabulous winter dish!

Great dish. Followed the recipe and the result was wonderful. Will definitely do it again.

I mistakenly used a spicy chorizo, so the dish was much more spicy than it should have been. That's my fault. The remainder of the recipe would probably produce an edible meal. To make it something I'd do over again, however, I'd have to change the meat. I just don't understand the fuss over oxtails! Way too much work to eat, and certainly not something I'd serve to dinner guests. Probably personal preference, but maybe beef shortribs would be more appealing to me.

I usually use the recipe for oxtails braised in red wine with root vegetables on this site, but I decided to try this one for a change. It is delicious. I had sweet smoked paprika which I had never tried before and we have access to good fresh chorizo. I cooked it on top of the stove one day ahead. It was fantastic served with parmesan mashed potatoes and asparagus. What a lovely late winter treat.

this recipe is a definite keeper. i have made it twice now with great results. make it two days ahead of a dinner party and it's even better. i had good results with the spanish smoked paprika the 2nd time around, and also with substituting 1/2 regular paprika and 1/2 ground chipotle the first time.

I was amazed at how easy it was to make and that it didn't take that much time. I had to substitute crushed tomatoes in puree as I could not find whole tomatoes in puree.
