Not having leeks, I substituted shallots and a few green onions. I added chopped turkey bacon for flavor and texture, and white pepper. My son was putting the tray of potpies in the oven for me when our stupid beagle jumped on it, flipping the pies onto the kitchen floor. Anyway, it was a great use for the chopped cod my husband insisted on buying and Trader Joes because it was inexpensive, and the sauce tasted great before I assembled the pies. Probably will not make it again.

I made this recipe, but with quite a few adjustments. End result was DELICIOUS. It appeared that recipe as it was was a bit bland. I started by leaving the veg a little chunkier, and added a little onion and fingerling potatoes. I doubled the liquid. Deglazed the pan with white wine and added lemon juice and fresh dill at the end.

Delicious with the adjustments to the filling as suggested. I added dill,peas, white pepper, white wine and garlic. I used white whole wheat flour for the biscuits.

Great weekday recipe and is very flexible. I have made it a few times subbing between fish and seafood (bay scallops, shrimp, crab) and I agree that it needs a bit of a flavour kick so I usually hit it with white wine and hot sauce.

This looked like a good base recipe but since most of the reviews complained about lack of taste I started off by rendering the fat of small bits of bacon until crisp, then sauteed the onions and veggies in the bacon fat to give it a smoky flavor. Next used a bit of white wine to deglaze the pan as well as add taste. Also added small dices of a potato, pinch of nutmeg and fresh thyme to the recipe. Didn't have the time to make fresh crust so cut out large circles of puff pastry, attached to the ramekins, sprinkled with sea salt and cut a seam in the top. It made four large ramekins, I ate one and froze the rest for later. YUM good meal on a cold fall night!

We just had this for dinner tonight and everyone enjoyed it; especially the pastry. I can see how some would find the meal bland so adding dill to the white sauce would be a nice addition but we enjoyed it as is.

Made this using teh last reviewers suggestions with lemon & lemon zest. Used corn since I had no peas - it was really very good!

I made this for some friends, one of whom doesn't like fish (I didn't know) and they all loved it. I added the juice of half a lemon, a pinch of lemon zest, parsley and peas (because you can't have a pot pie without peas) and it really helped it sing, it was a bit bland before I added the extras. Because I made this on a "school" night I used canned biscuits but I'd like to try it again and make the whole recipe.

I love a pot pie, but this one left me wanting. I cooked it for the family, including a three-year-old, so no white wine, which normally I would love. I think it just needed a little more kick to be great, for me maybe a dash of red pepper flakes next time -- because I will make it again!

I did this in a large casserole dish instead of ramekins and it turned out great, although the crust wasn't that easy to work with. I also added mushrooms. Comfort food!

Great dish, but next time I'll DEFINITELY increase the liquids, by 1/4 c. for starters. I added a few cubed turnips (b/c I had them on hand), and I took the advice of another reviewer and subbed white wine for some of the milk. A few reviews mentioned a lack of taste, so I also added dill and the juice of half of a small lemon to my white sauce. This, combined with the wine, must have done the trick. Impossible for anyone at our hosue to say the dish lacked any flavor! Easy, delicious. Great weeknight wintertime meal!

This recipe is simple and quite nice. Comfort food all the way! So many possibilities for the adventurous. I added some lemon juice to perk up the flavor, substituted some of the cod with 31/40 shrimp, cooked it in a casserole dish instead of individuals, and I also used a different savory herb biscuit recipe for the top. It is a moister mixture, similar to a muffin batter, so it can be spooned on, no rolling required!

I am surprised by the less-than-excited reviews for this recipe. I made it last night with wonderful results. It's quite easy to make, has a subtle but rich flavor, and looks fabulous. Maybe give an extra minute or two of baking time to make sure the biscuit is completely done, but other than that, I would make no changes!

I thought it was well worth the effort, although I agree with other reviewers: an experienced cook can skip some steps. I used refrigerated biscuits to save time and just pressed some dried dill into the biscuit dough. I also used dill in the sauce - which I made with 2% milk and it turned out just fine. This is a great alternative to chicken pot pie! My picky husband LOVES it. Can't wait to try the Jamie Oliver version - thanks for the tip!

I had to try it, but have to agree that it just wasn't worth the effort. I took other's comments on board and added more seasoning, plus a dash of cayenne and even some nutmeg to try to bring out the flavour. It was still just okay. If you want a superb fish pie recipe - use Jamie Oliver's. It is second to none! His is topped with the more traditional mash, but you could always switch it to biscuits as in this recipe, or simply add some dill to the mash!

This recipe has potential, but really needs to be tweaked. By chopping the ingredients for the sauce, then preparing the biscuit dough, there's no need to remove the sauce from the heat before stirring in the fish. The sauce needs more flavour (I added dill, but the flavour didn't really come through). It was also nice and thick on the stove, but came out of the oven runny and watery (I think the cod released water). The biscuits weren't completely cooked through when I pulled it out of the oven after 17 minutes. I think with a few improvements, this could be very good. As is, I was a bit disappointed.

Superlative comfort food for a chilly, damp weekday. We added a medium Yukon Gold potato, and baked it in an au gratin pan with the crust rolled out to fit (cook it a little longer so the biscuit bakes all the way through).

This was really good! I halved the recipe, but added a small potato and omitted the leek, and substituted some of the milk in the filling with white wine, as mentioned by a prior reviewer. Used 1 teaspoon dried dill weed instead of fresh (but remember I halved the recipe), and also added some dill while making the filling. I'll make it again!

this was surprisingly delicious. I was leary and thought it might be on the boring side but not at all. Oh, but I made a couple of changes - first I used pillsbury flaky biscuits (1/2 biscuit per ramekin) and added 1 small potato, diced to the sauteed veggies. Then, just because I had some, I substituted 1/2 cup of the milk it called for with 1/4 cup of buttermilk and 1/4 cup of dry white wine. Added the chopped dill directly into the finished sauce instead of the biscuits. Superb and only took 30 minutes!!

Easy enough, but I found it pretty rich for what it is. Yowsa, 2-1/2 Tbl butter per serving.

I made this dish with Haddock and it was delicious and easy. Definately comfort food after a wintry day.

Leek warning/advice: because leeks are extremely dirty within their layers, you will have to rinse them more than once. I like to wash them in a large bowl, then lift out rather than draining, so that the grit gets left in the water. If you drain into a colander you will pour the dirt right in with your leeks. I rinse at least two times this way, sometimes three just to be sure. Can't wait to try this recipe...it looks great...will rate then..

I say three, my husband says four forks. If you like potpies and you like fish, this is a must try. For company, I might use less dill and for a slightly lighter dish, a thinner biscut. i'm sure that you could use purchased biscut dough as well. I will add this to way of using cod/scrod and make it again - comfort food to be sure.
