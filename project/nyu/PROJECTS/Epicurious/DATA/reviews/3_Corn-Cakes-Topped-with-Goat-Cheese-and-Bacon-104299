A big hit at an appetizer pot luck. I used frozen roasted corn kernels. I added them directly and did not cook them with the onions.

This was a great way to fancy up a green bean salad. I didn't use butter at all, but sauted the peppers and onions in olive oil. The majoram and toasted almonds are really what made it stand out.

These were ok. They were a bit greasy, and I felt they needed an element of sweetness to cut the rich, greasy, saltiness of the dish. Maybe a balsamic reduction sweetened with some honey or sugardrizzled over the top? I also found that using a tablespoon yielded cakes that were a little too big. I made them a little smaller, which made them easier to eat.

This recipe wasn't one of the best. I think next time I will eliminate the cayenne pepper.

Other reviews commented that this dish was dry, and I agree. However, the combination of flavors is delicious, and just needs to be juiced up a bit. Try serving these as a first course, instead of an appetizer, and arrange a few cakes atop some wild mushroom ragout. I serve it this way, along with some chipotle cream, and the guests always rave.

I loved these! The combination of the goat cheese, bacon and scallions really accented these wonderfully. Without those I can see these being a bit bland and boring. Definitely mix the goat cheese with yogurt or sour cream to make topping easier. Can cook ahead of time and reheat in oven to no detriment. Try them at your next cocktail party - people will love them.

I made this dish for a dinner party and thought it was just OK. Some people said they liked them, but they might have just been being polite because there were definately leftovers. I wouldn't make them again.

I made this as a Thanksgiving appetizer, and all of the other guests raved about them and asked for the recipe. Made them the night before and warmed them up in the oven, which made it look effortless for me.

This was very dry; I would not make it again.

A hit with the Thanksgiving crowd. Very tasty. Seemed a tad dry so I added sour cream to the goat cheese topping which moistened it up and helped keep the bacon crumbles in place on top.

A little greasy, but that is easy to remedy. The flavor and texture were wonderful. I made this dish as an Easter appetizer. Yum does not begin to describe this delicious dish. The combination of the corn, feta and baccon made for a sweet/salty taste that was devoured by my family. I wonder if there is a creamy sauce that would compliment the flavors of this dish. If anyone has thoughts on this please send them my way. Also, note that this dish is not pretty to look at. For better presentation I suggest placing them on a bed of large green leafed lettuce and maybe a dipping sauce in the center of the cakes. Add a bit of color to a darn-near monochromatic dish. Easy to make and great flavor. Definitely will make again.

These were good, but I thought they were way too salty. Next time, I'll cut back on the salt. My husband thought they were dry, but everyone else seemed to enjoy them. I think he got the ones that I left on the griddle too long! I will make these again, but with some modifications.

Everyone loved this! Very flavorful and elegant. The cakes warmed up beautifully in the oven so I give this points for make-ahead.

Made this for Thanksgiving hors d'oeuvre - only problem I had was getting them out to the guests as we were eating them as fast as they were topped right there in the kitchen! Yum YUM YUMMY! Another starter that cost three times as much as these was largely ignored by people in their haste to get to the corn cakes. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were very flavorful and tasty when warm - but cooled down very quickly. Not very good when cold!

Would recommend this dish, it is easy to make, and will make again. If making this dish for company would suggest making ahead of time and reheating. Don't omit the goat cheese, and must use soft goat cheese.
