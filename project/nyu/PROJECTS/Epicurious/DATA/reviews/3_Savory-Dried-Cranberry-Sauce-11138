I was drawn to this recipe because I had a stash of dried cranberries at home from some flavored mustard I had made. I didn't notice how unspecific the cooking instructions are until It was half an hour before Thanksgiving dinner was to be served!! This recipe does not specify how high of a flame to use, and whether or not to bring the sauce to a boil after adding the wine. So I started with a low flame, brought everything to a boil once the wine was added, and then reduced the flame back to low again for the 15 minute simmer.

Paired this sauce with the "Crisp Roast Duck" recipe from Sep 2006 and it was phenomenal. Used white wine this time around but will probably try it with a dry red next time.

Have made this many times for pork tenderloin, always with rave reviews. Quick and easy!

mmmph, sweet! The dried cranberries are naturally so sweet that it is almost like having jam on chicken. The flavor is very nice though, and I think by halving or eliminating the sugar it will be an easy and tasty sauce.

I, too, used red wine instead of the white. What a wonderful sauce.

This sauce is delicious and very easy to make. I used red wine rather than white because I have a Thanksgiving-type cranberry sauce which calls for red wine, so I knew it would work and be good. I served it over sauteed chicken breasts, and there's enough sauce left over for a pork tenderloin in a few days. I think that adding a few more dried cranberries than called for might be a good idea. Note: I added an additional teaspoon of balsamic vinegar.

This is not your typical cranberry sauce that you would serve at Thanksgiving, but it excellent on pork or roasted poultry. I have made over and over again and everyone loves it.

We eat pork often and this is an easy way to jazz it up and gives a different twist than applesauce. Even kids like this sauce!

I am not a lover of this relish so my opinion would not be very helpful
