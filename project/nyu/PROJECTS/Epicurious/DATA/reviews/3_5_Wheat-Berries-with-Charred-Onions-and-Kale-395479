I made this recipe as written. I really liked the flavor the charred onions added. I didn't have a lemon so I added rice vinegar. I thought it needed way more than just 1 T. Maybe with the lemon juice it would be different. I loved the kale cooked in this manner. Not sauted, but charred in the cast iron.

Followed the recipe exactly. I love different ways of cooking kale and less common grains, but I wasn't expecting this recipe to be as flavorful as it actually is. Cooking the wheatberries with the onion, thyme, and salt imparts a wonderful flavor, and I'm thinking of doing this with other grains. Next time I might reduce the salt when cooking the wheatberries, just to see how much of a difference it makes. The charred kale is tasty. Charred onions always win in my book. The lemon at the end really pulls it all together and brightens the flavor.

Love how no one reviewed this recipe specifically. Everything written about this was a modified version. I would enjoy seeing what someone has to say after having made this dish as the recipe calls.

Great basic recipe to play with. I had a fridge full of veggies I had to use before going on vacation. I love the crunchy nuttiness of wheat berries. I cooked them as the recipe directed and they came out great. I roasted 5 veggies: eggplant, summer squash, baby potatoes, sweet yellow peppers and an unidentified striped squash. I added 2 kinds of cheese: asiago and feta, braised the kale with garlic chives. Later I threw in arugula, curly lettuce and radishes. WOW! Raise a glass for crunchy summer goodness. I'll be making this through the Fall. :-)

This was very tasty, liked by all who tried it. I cut the olive oil in half for caloric reasons and it still tasted good. My only complaint is the wheat berries took way much longer to cook than the recipe stated...I left them cooking for 90 minutes and they still were a bit too crunchy at that point. I used a brand new package of them too. Maybe they were sitting on the shelf at the store a long time? Never having cooked wheat berries before I'm not sure what happened. I will make again but allow much longer time to cook before planning to serve.

Couldnt find the wheat berries in my pantry so used 1 cup barley and treated it the same way and cooked redquinoa and added to the cooked barley. Added a cute little yellow patty pan squash, cut in wedges to the frying onions, added spice mixture (ras el hanut but curry or other mixtures could be used.) Otherwise kept to the recipe and loved it. With the quinoa adding protein we used it as the main coarse. yum.

Easy and delicious! Substituted quinoa for the wheat berries.
