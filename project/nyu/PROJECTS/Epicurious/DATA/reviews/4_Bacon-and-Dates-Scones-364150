Really great recipe. I put mine in the freezer for 10 mins instead of the fridge for 2 hours. Also subbed the buttermilk with watered down plain yogurt and added a diced apple. Really delicious, even the next day

i used all whole wheat flower bc that's all i had on hand and was desperate to use leftover bacon from easter. then didn't use the bacon grease but melted butter instead... still, turned out amazing and i will definitely be making these again. maybe left them in the oven for a few additional minutes... delish!

Just made these for a brunch party. KILLER is all I have to say. Tried not to over work dough and baked for 18 minutes. Served with butter mixed with orange marmalade. Heaven.

OMG! The Best thing I've ever put in my Mouth! Bacon, Dates, butter, raw brown sugar - oh my! Do bake them longer.

Absolutely delicious. But what a great idea to add pecans! Will do that next time. I used about 8 oz of bacon instead of the 10 called for. The sprinkle of turbinado sugar before baking is genius.

These were a big hit with the men in the crowd. I was thinking the scone part of this would be less sweet and would allow the dates and bacon to play off of each other better, but alas, the batter was too sweet for me and the scones were overall too sweet. I will try a different base and use the bacon and dates as additions as that really was a pleasant combination. I also made a recipe and a half, which turned out well. The texture was nice. I liked the ones that got cooked a little longer to a bit more than golden - had a nice, crisp crust and delicate center.

Those were great, but you need a lot more dates than the recipe calls for. maybe a tiny bit less than double the amount.

Served these to company...everyone loved them, marvelled at the ingredients ( quelle surprise!) these are rapidly going to become a staple for brunch and tea...beyond delicious...might add some chopped peans or orange zest next time

These are awesome. My husband said the "best scones he's ever had." Of course they are probably the only scones he's ever had with bacon!

These are just delicious. I love keeping scone dough in the freezer so I can just bake one or two at a time. These worked perfectly and are a nice change from my usual flavors.

I made these and we loved them. I added Parmesan cheese to half of the batch and the cheesy ones won out over the others. (Perhaps I'll add some blue cheese next time.) I wrote about the recipe here (http://bit.ly/hR7HYG).

Really wonderful! Did not chill 2 hrs but put in freezer for 8 minutes. Worked fine. Added chopped pecans...a nice addition. Baked 18 minutes.

I doubled this recipe and made 32 smaller scones instead of the 16 the doubled recipe called for. I'm glad I did! These scones are rich with a wonderful buttery, bacon flavor and the dates add just the rate amount of sweetness. The bacon is not cooked to a crisp and the dates are soft also so they add a nice texture to the scones. I'll definitely be making these again. The one suggestion I would make is to be sure that you bake them long enough. I initially followed the 16-18 minutes but had to pop them back in the oven for 3-4" longer ... and that was for the smaller sized scones which I would think would have baked more quickly. In any case, the longer baking time did the trick and the scones were great.
