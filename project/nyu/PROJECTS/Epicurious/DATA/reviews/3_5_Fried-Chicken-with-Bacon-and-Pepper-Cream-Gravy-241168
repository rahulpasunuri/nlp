I lovvvved this fried chicken. My whole family enjoyed it. I'm so making it again soon. I did not make the bacon and pepper cream gravy, but I will next time. I only marinaded the chicken for 9 hours, and it turned out delicious. I think the trick is to let it sit for the 30 minutes after you flour it. I let it sit for 40 minutes. I also fried zucchini using the flour mixture. They were also awesome!

I found that the chicken didn't have enough flavour, maybe next time I'll increase the paprika/cayenne. The chicken turned out okay, but there are definitely better fried chicken recipes. The gravy was delicious though!

I'm actually a vegetarian which is why I'm giving it three forks, I've never eaten it. I made it for a tailgate, no grave and everyone ate it cold. It was then demanded that I have to bring it to every tailgate.

We made this chicken without the bacon and gravy part. It was blah. Moist, but blah. Also it was raw in the middle. We clearly do not have a talent for frying chicken! From now on, we will stick to take-out when we crave fried chicken.

OK - anybody from GA 1st time making fried chicken must be a transplant. That being declared, u must know that fried Chicken is not a difficult thing to make, DO NOT stress, and certainly does not need all this prep! With bacon. Honestly. I usually prepare a bag w/flour, salt, pepper and garlic - and/or whatever else spices you want! lol (rosemary is a nice change sometimes and really adds a nice flavor, for example. Try . . ginger. Cumin. U name it). Coat the chicken. Milk the chicken. Re- coat the chicken. Fry in hot (canola!) oil about 20 min. first batch, 15 min next. This is not difficult. The chicken will be bronzed, u will know when it is done. And boneless / skinless works just fine for all you yankee health- concsious folks. Enjoy!

This was my first time making fried chicken and it was perfect and delicious. I made half the bacon gravy and chopped up the bacon and threw it in the gravy. I'm really looking forward to making it again.

Is a good recipe flavor wise, but incompleste on the plating of it. Why not try serving the Chicken seperate with some Southern Butermilk Biscuits on which you put the bacon, then Gravy. If your gonna have a heart attack have a delicious one. Now thats a meal!! Apple pie for dessert??

The fried chicken was very good! Exactly what my husband had been wanting. He sliced the onions very thin. Then we breaded some of the onions in the left-over flour. The onion rings were great too! We will definately make again soon.

With this one recipe, I feel like I've earned a couple of Southern Cooking merit badges. I didn't have time to marinate for 12 hours, but even 6 resulted in an exceptionally moist fried chicken. I used a cast iron skillet but didn't have a deep fat thermometer. It's easy to cut up a whole bird (plenty of online resources) but finding a pre-cut whole chicken is easy. The gravy turned out awesome, the first time I've really nailed it. Great recipe.

I made this without the bacon and gravy, and it was mind-blowingly delicious. Easy to make, too. It was my first time making fried chicken. Also made the slow roasted tomatoes from this issue, and those were awesome too!!
