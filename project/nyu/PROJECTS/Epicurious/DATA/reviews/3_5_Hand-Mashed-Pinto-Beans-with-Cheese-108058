Big disappointment. Bland and unappealing. Made recipe exactly as instructed. Tried to rescue them by adding chipotle salsa but still not tasty. Ended up throwing them out after eating what we could of them.

I subbed bacon grease and used Jack cheese (what I had handy) and soaked the beans overnight. They didn't look like much but the taste just hit the spot - yum. Great comfort food, particularly with tortillas and rice - and very toddler-friendly, which is always a nice bonus for us. Will definitely add this one to the rotation.

excellent and easy. the beans are great even before the mashing step.

Pinto beans have always been a staple in my house. I can remember Mom making beans every Sunday for the rest of the week. This recipe is pretty close to the basic. These days there are so many tweaks that can be done with pinto beans. I made these and the recipe was great. Thanks.

These are wonderful. Never again will I go back to beans from a can. I'll keep some frozen and thaw when needed. I always suggest soaking the beans overnight. They cook much faster.

Using olive oil in place of the lard, these beans were fantastic. Best I've made from dried beans. I actually served with feta cheese of all things, and the family thought the flavor worked really well.

This is a great easy recipe!! Instead of lard I used bacon grease-because it is what I had on hand, cut down on the salt a little because of the grease.

This was my first time working with dried beans, and I found this recipe to be very easy and tasty. The only changes I made to the recipe are I doubled the recipe and I didnt mix in the cheese at the end. Instead I melted the cheese on tortillas just before serving. I used Monterey Jack and found it was very subtle and made the beans taste creamier. Next time I will use a more flavorful cheese like Sharp Cheddar or Pepperjack. Reheats great, very versatile leftover. Will make again.

These were the best pinto beans I've made. I used olive oil instead of lard. It took longer for my beans to cook, but it may have been because I added a bit of salt at the beginning. My onions got a touch over-brown, but they added a delicioius carmelized onion flavor to the beans. I didn't even use cheese, and they were delicious!

Very good. Added cilantro and chili powder. Used as dip for corn chips.

Made these for dinner  so easy and yummy. I used organic, low sodium chicken stock instead of water, half a large red onion coarsely chopped, as I didnt have any green onions on hand, 3 smoked pork hocks (so I left out the lard) and 4 cloves of garlic. I simmered all for about 1 hour, added the salt and simmered for an additional 20 minutes. I reserved about half of the beans whole as we like them whole with rice, carne asada and corn tortillas. Mashed and fried the balance as the recipe states. Had some for breakfast and theyre better this AM.

This is wonderful - my first time ever making pinto beans, complete success. I couldn't stop eating it for four meals straight. Other reviews were a great help, both in the decision to make it and in what to do. I added no salt at all except for a couple of shakes to help along the boiling. Used bacon fat instead of lard as some others did, and onoly two-thirds the amount called for. Upped the garlic and onion considerably - 5 cloves garlic, and half of a HUGE sweet yellow onion, probably triple the 1/2 cup called for. Used twelve green onions including part of their stems for the initial cooking process. Used "queso oaxaca" 'cause I couldn't get manchego at the store. The resulting flavor is heavy on garlic and onion, but quite fresh, almost as if these ingredients were added raw. I t was even good cold! I didn't get around to tortillas, just served with white rice. Next time I will include tortillas, and will see what real Manchego does for it. Next next time I'll experiment with less fat and cheese, maybe some different sorts chiles or chili powder. Ancho chili powder is usually successful in many things I cook. Almost sweet.

Nothing better! I am now ruined for all other beans. You must follow the instructions to a the letter. Do not be afraid of the lard. Be aware that the cheese that you use greatly influences the flavor, therefore use a flavorful cheese. So quick! So complex!

These are the best ever. Don't be fooled by Rosarita fans. (That stuff looks and smells like dog food, LOL!) I don't "refry" these as the recipe states, just boil and mash, adding extra garlic. They are totally worth the time and last for multiple meals. Super economical too, dried beans are very inexpensive.

These are the best refried beans I have ever eaten. Do not substitute canned pintos. If you think there is no difference in canned and freshly cooked Pintos you are probably on the wrong website to begin with. Added juice of 1 lime with the cheese. Will definitely make often.

THESE BEANS ARE THE BOMB! These are the best I ever made. I put my beans to cook in the crock pot in the morning, and they are ready for mashing when I get home from work. For the person who found them bland, dried beans need LOTS of salt; I use at least a tablespoon in the crock pot. All you who used canned beans, PLEASE try this recipie with fresh. These beans freeze beautifully also. I make a double batch, mash them, add all the ingredients except the cheese, divide, then freeze. I warm them up in the mircowave, adding water or broth as necessary, then stir in the cheese.

Followed directions exactly and not worth the effort whatsoever!!! Much prefer canned rosarita fat free refried beans with green chili and lime.

It was good but very time consuming. Served with quesadillas, tomatoa salad with cilantro, and freshly made guacamole. Used pink beans instead of pintos because my supermarket didn't have them.

I will never buy refried beans again! This recipe is great! I try to avoid salt when I can (canned refried beans are salt infused) and making this dish is a great way to do that. Also, you can control the texture of the beans. I made nachos for the Super Bowl--perfect!

I thought it would be fun for once to try making refried beans from scratch. In my opinion it wasn't worth it. I thought these were very bland. Maybe they needed more salt or some chiles. I'll keep searching for another recipe.

This recipe is fantastic! Do NOT use canned beans!! We follow this recipe exactly and it is a huge hit everytime we make it. The best refried beans I've ever had. Yes, using dried beans takes longer, but definitely worth it.

How anyone can used canned beans and say they are making this recipe is beyond me. Cooking your own makes all the difference in the world! Yummy! I ended up using all the "bean juice" in the pot, since they had to stay warm while the rest of the meal finished. I also used Crisco, since my daughter is a vegetarian. Will try the Manchego (sp?) cheese next time instead of Jack, but they were delicious and even better warmed up the next couple of days. Served them with the Carnitas, Avacado Salsa, Red Rice, and Tomato Salsa from the same issue. It was one of the best meals I have ever made or eaten.

Used canned pinto beans. Added diced jalapeno with the onions, and some cumin with the garlic. Very good!

I used canned pinto beans (Goya brand) and canola oil instead of lard. These beans were so superior to canned and received lots of compliments. Leftovers were good as a bean dip the next afternoon!

I made it with bacon grease of 1/2 lb of bacon and added the crumbled bacon. Excellent.

Excellent and highly flavorful with a few minor adjustments. I used chicken stock instead of water and bacon drippings instead of lard.

I cheated and used canned pinto beans. But the results with the onions, garlic, cheese, and milk were really good. Better than refried beans by far.

I thought they were very good. Much better than the ones from a can. I do think bacon inproved the flavor.

These were pathetic! The flavor utterly lacked any semblence of moxie. Perhaps some bacon might have helped, but I won't waste any more ingredients trying to improve on such mediocrity.

Made these for a dinner party -- along with the rice recipe on the same page of the May issue -- and both were superlative. Totally different from the canned variety; exponentially better. Double the recipe to feed 8.

Beats the stuff out of the can any day. Freezes well too if one can ever get leftovers. I also add a sprig of epazote and a few dried chiles like japones. Beans, fresh hot corn tortillas (I live near a tortilla factory) are heaven on earth. I also like to serve a radish and cabbage slaw.

Very authentic and very tasty. This was a hit with my family. Next time I might not add quite as much cheese.
