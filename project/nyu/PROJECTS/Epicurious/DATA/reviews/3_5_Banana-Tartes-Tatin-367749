These were a big hit and they were super easy. They would be good with a lot of different fruits too. You don't really need to turn them out, just brush the puff pastry with a little egg wash and serve right in the ramekins.

I assembled and baked this in a medium-sized baking dish, reduced the sugar a bit, and overlapped/layered more thinly sliced bananas. It inverted without difficulty and made a lovely presentation. Simple and tasty. Great use for bananas that won't survive another day without being overripe.

Made it this evening, I am home alone so I made one, should have made two. Took about 5 minutes to put it together and 20 to bake and it was incredible. This is definitely in my new go to for a fast tasty dessert.

Very, very good. Make ahead of time and pop in the oven when dinner is finished. Would definitely "add" the vanilla ice cream next time. Also good cold (leftover) the next day!

I just received my October 2011 Bon Appetit magazine and saw the photo of this recipe (YUM!) and decided to try it for company tonite. I must say, it was a huge success! Very easy, could be 'made ahead', and has a very sophisticated presentation (even though it is so simple). Would recommend it! Also, just to note, I used considerably less butter than called for.
