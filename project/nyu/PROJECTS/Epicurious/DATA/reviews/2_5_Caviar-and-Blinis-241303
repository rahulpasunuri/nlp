This is a recipe for buckwheat pancakes and caviar, not blinis. There is no good reason to create a recipe for a prepackaged item. This was quite the waste of time.

Worthless recipe for blinis! Why even post this?!?

Buckwheat pancake mix masquerading as blini? Is this REALLY epicurious material? I agree with Taash, Who needs epicurious or any other real recipes when you can just look at the side of the box of packaged mix. If you don't like authentic blini, then don't make them. But calling THESE blini is like calling lumpfish roe real caviar.

Oh snark snob, Taash. I've been doing something similar for years. I frankly don't care for yeast blinis--even at the Russian Tea Room. It might be best to call these buckwheat mini pancakes. They aren't really blini. I doubt that you have tried the Whole Foods mix. It is really quite good. I usually serve half paddle fish and half salmon, with creme fraiche or sour cream.

Working with yeast is easy, and frankly, without it, a key flavor component is missing. And mix, for crying out loud????? This isn't blini, it's really nasty not-quite-buckwheat pancakes. I happen to love buckwheat pancakes AND blini, and these are to blini what a Hostess cupcake is to a sacher torte. Why is this on Epicurious? It belongs on the side of the Bisquick box.
