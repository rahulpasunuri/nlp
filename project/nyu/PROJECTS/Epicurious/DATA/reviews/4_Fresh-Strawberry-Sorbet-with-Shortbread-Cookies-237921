I give this the full four forks for versatility. I made it with the first fresh berries of the season and since I don't have an ice cream maker simply froze it overnight in an 8x8" pan then cut it into about 16 squares which I then bagged up for later use. As well as a beautiful dessert on it's own it is a great cocktail mixture. For two servings, I added 2 squares to my trusty magic bullet along with about 3 ounces of amber rum and a squeeze of lime juice, pureed it then topped it off with a couple of ounces of sparkling water. Soooooo...good! Can't wait to try it for margueritas!

Delicious and so easy to make. Not too sweet and the lime enhanced the berry flavor to taste like a mouthful of fresh berries in every bite! My husband, who is not a dessert person, kept eyeing my bowl and asking if I was going to eat all of mine, so I know it was a huge hit!!! I didn't even make the cookies, it was yummy enough to be served alone. I will absolutely make the sorbet again for a light, refreshing summertime dessert.

Strawberries are beginning to appear in our farmer's market. This is a great use of them!-simple and delicious. I think next time I might increase the lime juice a little as I like the combination of sweet and tart. My husband loved it just the way it was!
