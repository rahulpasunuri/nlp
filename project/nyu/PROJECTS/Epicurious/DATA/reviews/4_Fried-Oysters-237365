Regarding the baking powder: the batter on the oysters rises and becomes lovely and tender. Be sure the oil is hot enough of the batter will soak up grease and be heavy, not light and fluffy. We loved the famous Bluff oysters (New Zealand) done this way.

For 1.5 cups of flour, I can't imagine that you'd want 2 Tablespoons of baking powder. Is this a typo?

Dear Auckland cook. From the introduction: "Oysters are one of those three fruits of the sea permissible to Buddhists and were therefore insisted upon for New Year lunch by my grandmother. Cooking them with a batter is traditional. Their name, ho see, sounds like the Chinese words for good business." An old Chinese proverb says" it is very hard to put your foot in a closed mouth".

No Buddhist vegetarian would eat any form of seafood including oysters and mussels. They would only eat kelp or seaweed, so I don't consider this a vegetarian recipe at all.

very good batter, light and tender. I added a tsp of 'Old Bay" made it even better. would be good on fish as well.

although very heavy, the fried oysters were delicious. i didn't need to use huge amounts of peanut oil (as suggested), just poured deep enough to cover ~2/3 of a battered oyster in a wok. it worked well, though i did need to flip the oysters over a few times.

Very easy and delicious. I served this with a remoulade sauce.
