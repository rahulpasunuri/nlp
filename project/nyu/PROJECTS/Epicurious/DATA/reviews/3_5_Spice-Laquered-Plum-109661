Simple, versatile, and delicious. Accidentally put in extra brown sugar in the first step, but it turned out fine. Everyone gobbled it up. I also added ripe pears from our store because they were so good. Even not-fantastic quality fruit really shines in this recipe. Plus this is dead easy to make and immune to many mistakes. Change as you choose.

Really easy and delicious. So many alternatives you could use too - apricots, nectarines, etc. Ice cream, whipped cream, sorbet...the combinations are endless!
