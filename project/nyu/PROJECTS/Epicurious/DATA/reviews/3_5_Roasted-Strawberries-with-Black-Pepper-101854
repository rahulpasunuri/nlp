I have made this recipe a number of times with rave reviews. The type of balsamic vinegar is what makes it so delicious. I use Villa Manodori dark cherry balsamic vinegar, available at Williams Sonoma. It is a splurge but is totally worth it!

Surprisingly good. I made with just a little less pepper but with the full amount of the balsamic. To my husband, a little less pepper would have been better while I thought it was fine. To me, less balsamic would've been better but he thought it was just right. Long story short, you will have to try it as is the first time and make your adjustments the next time. I served it over mascarpone and thought it was very good. I will serve it with homemade vanilla ice cream next time. Yes, there will be a next time.

I made this on the Fourth of July and was a little worried about the response I would get from it. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe! It is important to point out that I went a little easy on the pepper and vinegar, just to be safe. Served with vanilla ice cream.

I have an adventurous palate and I liked this recipie. However, my boyfriend, who is a lot more conservative when it comes to food, just pushed it around and ended up leaving it!

Delicious! Although the flavor is something you either love or hate. Definatly recommend if you have an adventurous palate.

I gave this recipe the benefit of the doubt and made it. I usually love new and different flavors, but...I don't know what the fuss is all about over these strawberries. I made it last night and immediately had it over vanilla bean ice cream. One word...yuk. It wasn't the balsamic that made it unappetizing, but the pepper. Live and learn.

I was curious about this recipe and warned my husband that it could be strange. We absolutely devoured these strawberries! Now that fresh strawberries are coming in, I'll be making this often.

Sorry to say but I don't know what other reviewers are talking about. I made this and tasted awful! My husband who loves strawberry thought it was pretty bad, too.

Oddly delicious. And I mean that in the best possible way. I've only ever served it with mascarpone, and it's so delicious that I can't imagine serving it with anything else.

It sounds odd, but it's a delightful dish. The sweetness covers your tongue and the pepper shows up only in a burning in the back of your throat. I served it with vanilla ice cream and it got rave reviews. It did take longer to get "bubbly" in the oven than the recipe said, but my oven might be slow.
