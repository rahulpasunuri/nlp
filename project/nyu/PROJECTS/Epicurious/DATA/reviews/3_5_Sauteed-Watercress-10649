I added a little bit of feta and I thought it was great! I don't like raw watercrass so this is a good solution, fast and delicious! will make it again for sure.

very fast and tasty. adding lemon zest - about 2/3 of a lemon- really enhansed the flavor. will use less oil next time.

This is especially nice with a rich meat entree, such as lamb or rib-eye steak. And sprinkle delicate Australian pink salt in lieu of regular salt. It tastes best when prepared just before service, and I found a big wok to be the best vessel for cooking because of the heat that's attainable. I loved the fact that it took minutes to prepare. So put on a little show for your guests: The sizzling noise and the fragrant garlic emanating from the kitchen will impress them as they wait for the watercress.

Taks special note of "discard the stems" for the stems arent' inedible taste-wise but they are unchewable tooth-wise unless, perhaps, you're a cow.

Really easy, flavourful stir-fry dish. I added 4 tbsp chicken stock (left over from another recipe) and it kicked up the flavours nicely.

We really enjoyed this! It has more body than sauteed spinach -- the stems add a very nice texture.
