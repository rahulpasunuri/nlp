Have made this several times and each time my wife and I agree that it is one of the best quick recipes we have. The recipe does not need another dish, just some crusty french bread and you have a delicious meal with complex flavors - and healthy.

My friends made this for my birthday as it has many flavors that they know I like and it was fabulous. One of the best meals I've ever had. They substituted fish stock for clam juice, added sliced leeks to the vegetables, and cut down a bit on the dill since none of us are big fans. Otherwise it is pretty well as written. I'm adding it to my recipe box today. Definitely a keeper!!

Very bland. We didn't like it.

I made this last night with some fresh Alaskan Halibut that my Dad sent me.......Yummy! I didn't have Pernod so I made my own by reducing white 3/4 cup white wine, two teaspoons honey, and three tablespoons of anise seeds. Then I just strained off the liquid when it was about 1/4 cup. I also increase the veggies, because we love greens! The wife and I loved it, but the kids cared more for the broccoli resotto that I made as a side!

Made it as written, unusual for me ;^) The taste of the broth was complex and delicate. Next time I will pull the fish a bit earlier, it was good, but I would like it less cooked. The flavors are almost haunting. A bit of veggie prep time with the berininer and then it goes together easily.

I was surprised! When my husband smelled the fishy clam juice he started to back away from the kitchen. But as the herbs simmer, and with the liquor, it really mellows down and is unique and delightful. I wasn't trying to be creative, but I ran out of clam juice and added a cup of chicken broth; used the Sambuca I had on hand instead of Pernod; and as another reviewer mentioned, used tilapia. I don't think these substitutions altered the taste much. Really - wonderfully healthy and a lovely taste.

Unusual, tasty and light. I only wish I had used a better quality of fish, as it does not hide the true flavor of the fish. I was a little suprised at how much broth was served - this was almost a soup.

Quite spectacular combination, using the best fish America has to offer.

Have made it several times. So easy, elegant and light and gets rave reviews. Have also made it successfully with sea bass and tilapia.

This was so delicious and light- I made it for company and everybody was amazed at how good it was! It looked and tasted fancy and gourmet, but it was not that hard to do well. I'll make this again next time I want to impress!

I made this dish for dinner last night. Got rave reviews from 15 year old step-son and my mother-in-law. Would make it for company

I've made this a few times now ... only I used sea bass instead of halibut (it holds its shape better). This is an excellent dish, and everyone I've served it to has loved it. It is also EASY! I used more carrots and asparagus than it called for...just to load up one veggies.

Not only would we make this recipe again, we did - to raves. It is light, tasty and I would not hesitate to serve it again.
