The perfect cornbread for the Mexican Cornbread Pudding-not sweet and perfectly dry while still maintaining it's texture. Will not stand alone as cornbread.

This isn't a stand alone corn bread recipe. It was meant to be used in the Mexican cornbread pudding several recipes up.

When it called Dry Corn Bread, they really mean it. Definitely not making it again.
