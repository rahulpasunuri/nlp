I've made it as written, and it's perfect. I've also made it with a mix of Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago, and it was fantastic!

My garlic bread is ready for the oven but I had to sit down and write about how delicious the butter is right now. I had only parmie so that is what I used but this butter is so amazing. I let my three little boys have a taste and they loved it even with the "stingy" raw garlic taste. The perfume of it is starting to permeate the house. I followed a fellow reviewer's suggestion and I've wrapped it in tinfoil and am baking at 300 for 15 minutes. This is going with steamed mussels and I cannot wait to pick up the left over juices with this bread!!! Yipee!

Absolutely wonderful the way it's written.

Thought that this time I might roast the garlic. We took a medium head of garlic, 1/4 cup vermouth, a tablespoon or two EVOO, two 2-inch sprigs of fresh rosemary, and wrapped it in foil. Popped that in the oven at 400 for 45-55 minutes. The garlic butter has been sitting for about a day in the fridge. Judging by the smell it should be a keeper.

I have been searching for a garlic cheese bread and this is it! Perfect everytime. The Romano Cheese is an excellent choice, just the right flavor with a bit of a tang.. I tried other cheeses and it wasn't half as good. My 7 year old niece likes it without the cheese and that does make a great garlic bread, very nice with Spagetti.

This was really good - but the cheese did not melt. Next time, I will bake it and then run it under the broiler for probably 30 seconds or so...otherwise, it was fantastic and we ate it all!

I am making this recipe for about the 100th time this weekend - it never fails to be a hit! Make sure to have plenty on hand -- we usually go through 2 loaves for only 4 people...

When the bread gets special mention alongside Lidia Bastianich's lasagna, I'm pleased. This is a keeper. Made ahead & wrapped/baked in foil, it was perfect.

This was very good. I wanted to prepare as much ahead of time as possible. So, I cut a whole loaf into approx 2 inch pieces. (I did not cut it lengthwise first.) I spread the butter mix on each piece and stacked them back together. I wrapped the new loaf in foil and put in the refridge the day of the dinner party. Then, I just popped it into the oven when the guests started to arrive.

This is my favorite garlic bread! I made it to go with chicken, shrimp, and chorizo stew. It was so delicious we ate it all. Too bad the dogs patootie reviewer appears to have removed their review. I suppose some people do realize when they've made a fool of themselves.

Yum!! I felt purely decadent using all this butter and cheese, but this is one recipe that makes the calories worthwhile. It's a good thing this is so easy to make because it's addictive.

Deeeelish!!! Yum! If you are looking at the reviews for this bread, take my advice. Make the bread.

We've had a lot of garlic bread in our house, and this is by far the best recipe we've ever tried. My husband asks for it all the time. A keeper for all times.

I must agree with Sue from N.Y. Trust no one who's culinary tastes include that of dog parts! (Referring to the person from Brain-nerd, MN. Why do you think they called the town that...Brain-less and Nerds!) On the other hand, I have made this recipe on several occasions. The key is to not over bake it. Wrap in foil for softer results.

I wasn't so sure before, but now I definitely plan to try this recipe. My motto is, don't take culinary advice from anyone who has tasted a dog's ----s

I cut baguette bread into small slices and spread the mixture on each slice. I also mixed 1/2 Romano and 1/2 Parmesean cheese (Pecorino Romano can tend to be too salty on its own). We had 6 people for dinner and went through 2 loaves of baguette bread!

I made this recipe for a large dinner party along with lasagna, and could not keep enough of it on hand! I had to keep making more, because evertone loved it. It's important to make sure that the cheese is grated very fine, but the romano gives it a wonderful flavor.

Made this for ladies luncheon. Seemed to be a little hard to chew. Maybe should have grated chees more or enclose in foil as suggested to make it softer. Disappointed in bread.

Made this bread twice, the first according to the recipe, the second by wrapping the bread (not cut all the way through) in foil and putting it in a 300 degree oven for 12-15 minutes. The bread is still delicious, only softer on the palate and good for sopping up tomato sauce. Just make sure the cheese is finely grated; use a food processor.

I can't give it 4 forks because it is just jumped up garlic bread, but it is very good. I substituted margarine for the butter ( no butter in the fridge at the time!) and I added a little olive oil. I also upped the garlic but I always tend to do that!! The secret to this recipe, I believe, is the quality of the cheese.
