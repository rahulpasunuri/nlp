I have made this recipe 4 times, trying to get it to be moister, and raise more. I give up. I keep searching for a dark, moist raisin rye bread recipe, but having NO luck.

Didn't get eaten in my party, though for me it tasted all right. As always in making bread, it takes some precious time (which I could have used for making something else), and when the result just gets ignored, then it was definitely a waste. I will try maybe another limpa recipe in the future, but not this.
