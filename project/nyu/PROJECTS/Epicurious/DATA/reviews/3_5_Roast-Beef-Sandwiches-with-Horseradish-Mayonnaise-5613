I made this sandwich for an outdoor summer concert with friends. My local bakery makes a mean ciabatta, so I used that instead of french bread. The horseradish mayonnaise is wonderful. Everyone loved it.

My family isn't too enthused with horseradish, but I enjoy it, so decided to try this dish out on them. My husband agreed that it was good, but the kids weren't enthused. I would make this again for adults, but not for kids. I thought it was a delicious alternative to mustard on roast beef sandwiches.

I thought this was great! I used individual french rolls and ignored the amount of roast beef suggested and put on what I thought was a decent amount of roast beef. (Who wants to weigh roast beef for a sandwich anyway?) The horseradish sauce was perfect. My husband first said he didn't want it on his sandwich, but after tasting it, decided to add more.

Liked this a lot - a good summer meal. My only complaint is that you could hardly taste the roast beef. Next time, I'll increase the amount to 12 oz.(The horseradish mayo was perfect!)
