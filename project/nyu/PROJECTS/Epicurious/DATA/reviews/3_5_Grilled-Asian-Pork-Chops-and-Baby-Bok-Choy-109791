The kids were unsure about eating until they saw the pork chops and because they looked good, they decided to eat. The pork chops were good with the cilantro and lime. The bok choy had a smokey taste and the childern had seconds. May not be an everyday favorite and will cook again.

Made as directed using kikkoman black bean sauce and I thought this was just an ok recipe. I probably will not be making this again.

Excellent! Made it with chicken. Tasty, definitely a keeper.

This recipe isn't bad for a base, but one key piece of information would've been helpful when deciding on this dish: Black Bean Garlic Sauce is VERY VERY salty. Many users mention the soy sauce in this recipe, but the real culprit is the black bean garlic sauce. I purchased the sauce from an asian grocery in chinatown (I live in NYC), and it was apparently the brand Lee Kum Kee(after reading up on it since I couldn't believe how salty it was) that has the highest level of sodium of them all. Of course, fermented anything is going to be salty, but straight out of the jar I couldn't figure how we were going to serve it. I eventually tripled the limes used (3 limes) and doubled the sesame oil and the soy sauce. I doubled the fresh ginger and added a teaspoon of sugar. Finally it was palatable. I brine all my pork, so the chops were pre-brined, but I also marinated them in the new mixture for 20 minutes. I used a cast iron skillet (live in NYC- no grill, and its middle of winter) and they got a nice seared flavor to them. I also pan sauteed the bok choy with some oyster mushrooms and used the sauce as flavoring. All in all, not a bad meal since we like pork chops and bok choy. BUT as written, there should be a warnming re: black bean garlic sauce and saltiness. I may go as far as making my own next time- I have read you can wash the fermented beans really well so they are less salty.

Loved it - quick, easy and delicious. I added some dried chili peppers for some heat.

The pork was exceptional. Not to salty at all. The bok choy was a bit different, but even my husband who refuses to eat cooked leaves thought it wasn't bad. I paired it with a homemade concoction of five spice seasoned roasted butternut squash puree. Delicious.

Sorry - the black bean sauce was a bit much. The other ingrediants were excellent. Perhaps skipping the black bean sause and using olive oil with the other ingrediants would have been better. I could not get the taste out of my mouth.

Didn't have any pork chops tonight, but had everything else. The marinade makes a great sauce for the vegetables. I threw in a bag of pot stickers (prepared occording to package directions) and a sliced yellow bell pepper. Fabulous!

This is excellant for a taste change. My family wants me to make it again.

Fantastic recipe - It is so easy and the pork comes out very very juicy. Good suggestion on other vegetables - I can't get my husband to eat the bok choy (I end up eatitng it all) but there is enough sauce for more veggies.

Great, easy weekday meal. I added asparagus to the baby bok choy, I think you could use any green vegie you have on hand. This will be a staple at our house.

Made this for my husband and I. It is so easy, quick and fabulous flavor. I served it with Rice Pilaf with Almonds (out of the box). I didn't find recipes for either of the suggestions. Also, I sauteed the bok choy based on reviews. Next time I will grill them too.

Did not have black bean paste, added 1/2 cup mixed berry juice strained from some thawed frozen berries instead. Also added more ginger (two Tbs)to the marinade. Since my chops were still a little frozen, I sliced them into 1/2 inch strips (against the grain), mixed 1/2 of marinade w/ pork, defrosted in microwave until chilled but no longer frozen. Used a non-stick pan to sear strips, turned only once (each side only takes a min. or two - do not overcook!). Drained the pan juice (fat) and removed the strips. Put the remaining marinade in the pan, wisked in a teaspoon of cornstarch while on medium high heat. Once thickened, poured over the strips of meat. Out-of-this-world.

This is a standard dish at our place. It's so easy and delicious. I usually don't bother with the bok choy or limes, just use the sauce as a marinade.

Incredible-really good and easy to put together.Rather than grilling, I simmered covered on the stove in the marinade for 15 minutes one side and 10 minutes on the other. Husband loved it, our gourmet cat loved it too - licked up the marinade. Would be great on pork tenderloins or chicken.I'm impressed.

Made some changes to lower the sodium. Used low sodium soy sauce & added water. Also substituted chili oil for sesame seed oil. Otherwise, everything else the same. The recipe turned out very good with 2 double-thick chops from Walmart.

This recipe was great...very easy to prepare and quite delicious. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and removed all of the marinade from the chops before grilling...the flavour was still impressive, without the salt. Will make again for sure!

Very tasty dish. My husband LOVED it. The cilantro with it is excellent. Due to the mixed reviews of the bok choy I made steamed broccoli instead. I agree with other reviewers who say this dish is too salty. I used reduced sodium soy sauce as well as using less soy sauce than recipe called for. It still ended up being WAY too salty! I will look for black bean garlic sauce that has less sodium before I make this again.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS RECEIPE. IT'S ALWAYS A WINNER!!!

It was salty though I took care to marinade exactly 20 minutes. My daughter (6) liked it though, so I will make it again. I'll add more lime juice to balance the saltiness, and scrape off all marinade before grilling. Might be good marinade to try with ribs and steamed.

The pork chops are a bit too salty. I will subsitute rice wine for the soy sauce, serving it with steamed broccoli without the marinade.

very flavourful - but too much of the same with the the sauce being used for both the pork and the bok choy. Left-over pork was great in fried rice!

Great recipe! Even my kids (ages 8 and 5)loved the pork...we skipped the bok choy. You can pair this with a ginger rice (but I think it's a bit of overkill). I made a mushroom risoto and it was a great compliment. Nice fall/winter hearty.

My guests and I thought this dish was delicious. The only thing I would change is to purchase a black bean sauce with less sodium.

Outstanding! The black bean sauce is delicious! I didn't have ginger when I made this and it was wonderful even without it.

My husband and I enjoyed this easy recipe. However, the bok choy got a little crispy before it was tender.

The flavor is amazing! Had a hard time finding the black bean garlic sauce, but finally bought it at Cost Plus (who knew?). Definitely worth the hunt.

While this dish was flavorful, I found it to be very salty. Possibly because I used regular soy sauce and not low salt. We grilled the bok choy too long and it got too crispy on the grill - I think it would've been better steamed. Regardless, I'll probably make it again since my husband loved it.

Delicious. I marinated the pork chops all day. My guests raved about this and I was glad that I made a couple "extra" - they were gone before I knew it.

This recipe is great. While the pork was grilling, I took the remaining marinade, added a little orange juice, and boiled to reduce it by about half. This made a great sauce to spoon over the bok choy before serving.

Wow!! this is a super recipe and very easy. I have make this with boneless chicken breast also. The marinade is great to make up ahead of time to keep on hand.

I haven't made this yet, but it reminds me of the silver-wrapped chicken on this site. If you like this, you must try the excellent silver-wrapped chicken.

I used a grill pan to cook the pork and a wok to cook the bok choy. Very tasty and everyone raved.

this is an easy and quick way to have a very flavorful grilled pork. My whole family raved about it. I would use more of the marinade on the bok choy. It burns quickly so have your grill on low. Do not over marinade the pork.
