My husband made this for dinner last night...very good...not over the top, but very good. He cut the chicken breasts up rather than leaving whole since he didn't have time to marinate for 4 hours. He also cut way back on the balsamic...we use a very good (ie, expensive) balsamic and 1 1/2 cups would have been overkill. We always use mesquite and cook on a Weber, so everything is always more flavorful on the grill...and the aroma was divine. Rather than rice he made Israeli couscous...nice change. We would make this one again.

This is a very good and easy dish. I prefer chicken with the skin on it, however. I've made it lots of times and clean plates result all around.

The vinegar is very strong in this recipe. When I was reducing the sauce, the odor of vinegar was so overpowering that my boyfriend literally grabbed the pan off the stove and put it outside. We threw it away!

The combination of herbs and spices lent an odd flavor to the chicken. I did not care for this at all, nor did my husband or brother-in-law.

Simple and delicious! I only had time to marinate the chicken for two hours...even so the chicken was moist and flavorful. The grilled vegetables were wonderful.

Loved this recipe. Did not have sage on hand, but I tried it without it. It was quite amazing!!

My husband and 5 year loved this recipe. It's a keeper and so easy to make. I marinated the chicken overnight and put the veggies on skewers to cook after I brushed the leftover marinade on them. Did not make the wild rice. I will be making this again and again.

My husbands favorite. Cut the chicken and veggies for kabobs. Marinate overnight in ziplock bags, skewer and grill. I serve with a green salad and grilled garlic bread.

Excellent and so easy. I premade the marinade and packed it in our cooler for a beach vacation. Bought the chicken & vegies at a local market, tossed all on the grill. Everyone loved this. Thankfully, our chicken was not dry.

Used whole chicken cut up w/skin, kept the meat so very moist. The flavor us a little bland, but just added extra balsamic afterwards (great condiment). Actually thought the chicken was better the next day. Used left overs, including veggies & rice, to make soft tacos. Good recipe overall.

I've made this recipe several times and each time everyone loved it. My family prefers chicken with skin, so I've always left it on. The honey in the marinade makes a nice glaze on the skin.

The chiken had a lot of flavour, though a little bit on the dry side, despite the fact that I marinated it longer than suggested.

This recipe was wonderful. I didn't expect much because it seemed like just a plain chicken and grilled vegetable dinner, but the marinade made everything taste delicious. It looks great too. I served it on top of couscous instead of rice. This also travels pretty well for picnics. I just packed up individual servings in bowls and served it lukewarm.

This is the best chicken marinade recipe I've found on Epicurious, and I recommend it. The marinade flavors melt into the chicken, and the result is subtle but memorable. I wouldn't bother using it for the vegetables, though, as the flavor did not come through. Next time I'm soaking the veges in olive oil and rosemary instead.

This is the BEST marinade I've ever eaten and it's the one meal I know everyone will eat. The best is making extra chicken and putting it on a salad the next day. Yummy!!

Why wait for summer? Even my 20 month-old, who is normally a picky eater, gobbled down the zucchini and mushrooms. Wonderful dish.

Fabulous marinade! Added soy sauce and ground pepper, used less balsamic vinegar (cost cutting measure), and grilled chicken kabobs with red onion, green and yellow zuchinni, red and yellow pepper. Smoked for 10 minutes with apple wood chips. Served with fruited jasmati rice. Family thought I'd been cooking all day and declared this a keper.

Excellent marinade! The sweet taste was welcome on a hot summer night.

As many before me have noted - this is a great tasting and easy recipe. If desired, any of your favorite vegetables will work. I will also try it with boneless pork loin chops.

Very moist! I halved the recipe for our small family and it was great. I substituted fresh basil for the sage. Great recipe with ingredients on hand in the house.

..made this for company..and they LOVED it -- even my vegetarian teenager ignored the chicken by devoured everything else. As we say in my family, "a definite do-over."

I had a difficult time getting this marinade to come together smoothly. The honey kept on clumping. Also, the marinade didn't flavor the chicken as much as I thought it would. It leaves a nice subtle taste. I ended up pan frying the chicken w/ a little olive oil and some of the marinade. I then reduced the marinade by simmering it and poured it over the chicken.

this recipe was easy and delicious..I omitted the eggplant and used portobello mushrooms instead. I wasn't really concerned about re-using the marinade for the veggies ...I'm in the food industry and it's not a real concern if you are careful about temperatures.

Marvelous marinade, great for summer grilling... And about the marinade. It is perfectly acceptable to use a marinade for meat and then pour the remainder over vegetables, provided (as in this recipe) that the marinade is boiled first to kill any bacteria that may have been in the meat.

This recipe is so fabulous and easy. I have made it twice now and everyone loved it!! They think I am this great cook now (I have them all fooled). This one's a keeper!!

I made this recipe for a special get together w/family, and everyone loved it! The presentation of this recipe with the rice, chicken, and vegetables on a platter looked fabulous. Everyone was calling me "Chef Brigette!"

I cheated! I added even more honey than the recipe called for. We all went to Heaven.

This recipe was a welcome addition to the annual Luau we hold. It has got a great flavor and everyone loved it. Other vegetables I used were: aspargus and green peppers. Very well received and a marinade I would recommend highly!

I did change one thing. I used a separate batch of marinade for the vegetables. I don't think it is wise to place vegetables into a marinade which has had raw chicken in it. Then to take that same marinade and put it over your grilled vegetables. Oh, dear God, please come to your senses. Otherwise, great grilling recipe.

We loved this dish. My husband raved about it and said it was definitely a gourmet meal! The only thing I did different was I separated the marinade and used some for the chicken and some for the veggies - I felt uncomfortable adding the vegetables to the marinade that the raw chicken had been in.

I made this recipe for company and it was delicious... It got lots of compliments. I used the dried herbs and they were fine and italian eggplant was fine (instead of japanese).

I didn't make the entire recipe, but instead used the marinade to make "chicken ka-bobs". The result was excellent, well received by guests. Great marinade!
