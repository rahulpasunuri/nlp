It's good to enjoy crab cakes as part of your diet -- crab and other seafood are sometimes forgotten when we're ready to include fish in our diets. Crab cakes are a tasty way to pamper yourself and still enjoy a balanced diet. http://www.fisherboy.com/smart-food/

This recipe is a good starting point. I don't think it requires a full cup of bread crumbs. Next time I'll cut back to 3/4 of a cup.

Add diced jalapeños for an extra kick!

this recipes was delicious and so easy. we didnt have them as sandwiches but as our entree with salad. i used soy nayonaise instead of mayo to cut back on the fat and cooked them in canola oil instead of vege oil.

I made this as an appetizer for a dinner party, and it went over swimmingly. The recipe (as modified - see below) made 17 mini crab cakes. I followed the recommendations of using thyme instead of parsley, 1 c. panko breadcrumbs instead of standard, 1.5 t Old Bay, 1 T mustard, and frying for a couple minutes a side then baking at 350 for about 7 minutes.

This is a good "starter" recipe, but it's begging for a few changes. 1. 2.5 tsp old bay seasoning is way, WAY too much. I found 1 tsp to be perfect. 2.I went with 2 tbps of light mayo, and 2 tbsp of dijon mustard, which adds a lot more flavor. 3. Departing from tradition, I went with 1/2 tbsp of fresh chopped thyme (goes with with the dijon) instead of parsley. I also added 1 red bell pepper (and sometimes, 1/2 ear of corn) to give it extra flavor and texture. -I used panko breadcrumbs instead of the regular kind--I like the lighter texture (though I stuck with 1 C--the extra bread is needed to absorb moisture from the vegetables)

Good recipe, but I found 3/4 cup breadcrumbs made perfect conssistency. I also added modified it by adding 1and 1/2 tsp cayenne and substituting 2 fresh cut scallions for parsley. Got raves from guests!! Really delicious.

I had to make a few minor modifications given what ingredients I had on hand (e.g. used dry mustard plus white wine vinegar since I had no dijon). This was made with freshly steamed crab I had caught the day before. The one bit of advice I would have is to add the breadcrumbs slowly as the last item, folding in as much as you need to give it the right consistency. I think 1 cup would have been too much. I made golf ball sized appetizer portions and served with a spicy aioli (mayo + chili powder).

The recipe as written is pretty so-so compared to other crabcake recipes on this site. I've made crabcakes a few times from Epicurious so I combined a bunch of recipes together (I did try this recipe as written first!). I know usually people are wary about following extensive modifications from reviewers, but keep this in mind if you're looking for improvement: 1) I used the chili garlic sauce from http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/107053 . It's more interesting than cocktail/tartar. 2) I used 1/4lb fresh bay scallops, chopped in food processor briefly, with 3/4 lb crabmeat to give it some more flavor. 3) 2.5 tsp Old Bay was way too much, I used 1.5 tsp instead. 4) I used 1/3 cup mayonnaise so the crabcakes would be a bit more fluffy. 5) Instead of plain breadcrumbs, I used panko, since those are lighter. 6) To give the crabcakes a crispier crust, I dipped them in flour, then beatn egg, then coated with additional panko. 7) Instead of frying in oil, I used equal parts clarified butter and oil. This gives a bit more flavoring. 8) My crabcakes only made 4 servings, I suppose you could make 6 but they'd be rather small. 9) Instead of frying until done, I fried for a couple of minutes on each side and then baked at 350 for about ten minutes. Just frying them for 10 minutes makes the crust way too hard/dark, although maybe this is temperature dependant. Don't bake too long though or they'll dry out.

My husband made this last night. I thought it tasted excellent. Of course, he made a few modifications. We skipped the light mayo for regular. Used lemon infused olive oil. Added green onions and shallots. Really don't need the bread - since the crab cakes alone are great. Great way to use up the rest of the crab.
