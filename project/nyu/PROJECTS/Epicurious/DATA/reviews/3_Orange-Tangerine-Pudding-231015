After reading the previous reviews, I decided to slightly decrease the sugar and I added a bit more zest (I used tangerine AND orange zest), plus I didn't make any adjustments over the fact that I only had salted butter in the house. And I was very careful to make sure I'd bought the correct juice (not from concentrate) as the ingredient list states; though I wasn't sure if it would set thick enough, I was pleasantly surprised that after the butter was added, and the cold-bath cooling time, it was just fine. Well, something worked out well! Very much like an orange curd (as another reviewer wrote) and not too sweet to my taste...and setting it to cool in a cold water bath actually does make a difference. OH - I also layered some dark chocolate mousse in the middle - just in case it WAS too sweet (orange pudding - chocolate mousse - orange pudding, topped with Grand Marnier whipped cream, and sprinkled with dark chocolate shavings). That definitely stepped things up a notch! Tasted a lot like a Terry's Chocolate Orange with a CreamSickle on the side! Maybe a bit over the top, but it moved things into the 4-star-level, and definitely makes this dessert 'company-worthy' by stretching the servings to at least 10!

The family really enjoyed this refreshing dessert. I used orange juice instead of tangarine juice with no complaints about it being too sweet.

After reading the reviews, I reduced the sugar a bit. I also used fresh juice from satsuma mandarin oranges. The results were incredible! It was a nice ending to a rich meal as the tartness is quite refreshing. I will definitely make this recipe again!

I agree with the other reviewers who write that it has great flavor, but is a little too sweet, and doesn't thicken quite enough. I used 3/4 tangerine juice anf 1/4 quarter orange.

Good flavor, but too sweet, and didn't thicken enough. Next time will use less sugar, and more cornstarch.

Used all tangerine juice. Good flavor, but much too sweet. Next time will use less sugar, maybe 1/4 cup. Also, didn't thicken enough. Will use more cornstarch if I make it again.

This is perfect kid food. I made it with fortified juice - kids will never know you just served them up vitamins and minerals. The adults liked it too - sort of a cross between orange curd and cake filling. Wouldn't make it for company, but it's great home food.
