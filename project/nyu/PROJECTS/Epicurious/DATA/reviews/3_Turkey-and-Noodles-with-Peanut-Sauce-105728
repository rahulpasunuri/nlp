I made this to use up extra turkey. I didn't read the reviews but ending up using less peanut butter than called for, only because we didn't have enough in the house. I omitted the celery and scallions, again because I didn't have them on hand. I thought this was great! It was the perfect amount of spiciness for me and thought it might be too spicy for some of my friends. I wasn't sure of the lemon juice (seemed out of place), but it worked fine in the sauce. I will definitely make this again and make it with water (not broth) and without poultry for my vegan friends.

I was disappointed that this wasn't more flavorful. I thought that the crushed red pepper and giner would come through more. If I make this again, I'll double those ingredients. Also, some Tabasco wouldn't hurt. That said, this is a great way to hide Thanksgiving leftovers--it sure beats more soup!

I've fixed this recipe many times over the past few years. I use chicken and simmer it with Thai seasoning. I don't add the celery. I recently discovered Spicy Sesame Linguine (by the brand Al Dente). Those noodles truly make the meal special. It's easy and so very delicious!

I adapted this recipe and it turned out GREAT. We will add this to our regular menu. Changes: Replaced dried red pepper with 1 serrano, 1 red frenso. Doubled the garlic and ginger Replaced celery with bean sprouts. Also added sugar snow peas, carrots and sweet red pepper strips. Replaced the cooked chicken with raw cubes of chicken breast and sauteed that with the garlic and ginger and simmered it in the sauce for several minutes. Cut back the peanut butter ever so slightly - used crunchy instead of creamy. Dropped fish sauce. Served with chopped cilantro and lime wedges. Yum.

Instead of pepper flakes I used a red Thai curry paste and added cilantro. I also made sure that the sauce didn't get too thick. Next time I'll add some fish sauce as well. This was a great use of leftover turkey, although I can see using shrimp or chicken with this dish as well as other vegetable, such as bean sprouts.

This recipe needs too much work to make it right, so I don't plan to make it again. It's boring and the sauce was too thick even after I added some pasta water. I regretted using leftover Thanksgiving turkey in this manner!

Used snow peas instead of celery and just added broth as needed to the sauce to keep it as desired. I used leftover turkey. Even my picky son-in-law enjoyed it!

I basically made the sauce down to a T with the linguine, but changed everything else. No chicken or celery (instead I tossed it with shredded cabbage, carrots and green bell pepper, lightly steamed, slices of tofu, and also added mixed cilantro with the scallion). It was good; got compliments from my family. But I thought it could've used more zip. Next time, I will up the soy sauce a bit, and mix in a 1/2-1 tsp of curry powder, which I've done before with other peanut sauces. (For anyone who thinks this is "bland" I would definately recommend this!) BTW; if you like noodles more wet instead of dry, this is definately not enough sauce.

Bland and so so. I love peanut sauce but this did not thrill me. won't try it again. To thick and not enough going on with the dish. I must admit I did not read the reviews. May have found something in there to make it more interesting.

Easy and delicious. I used chicken and left out the celery.

I have made this many times abd everyone always loves it. I usually leave out the Turkey and toss the pasta and peanut sauce right before I serve it making it creamier

I thought this was a fantastic recipe! Delicious, easy and quick. I subbed chicken for the turkey and used chunky peanut butter because that's what I had on hand. For noodles, I used some Thai rice noodles, the kind used in Phad Thai. Sprinkle a little red pepper flakes on top and enjoy!

The turkey doesn't work well, too bland. This is a leftover-turkey-I-don't-want-throw-out recipe.

A delicious and easy-to-make recipe! If you like a kick to your food, increase the red pepper flakes and the garlic.

I made this recipe with the chicken option. My husband and I both found it delicious and unique. I was not a big fan of the sliced celery and may consider replacing it with pea pods next time. I also think that I might use 3/4 pound of pasta rather than a full pound. Otherwise... it was fantastic and we'll definitely be having it again! The sauce would also be really tasty as a sate dipping sauce.

This recipe is a favorite in our house, with a few substitutions: we use chicken instead of turkey, and we use at least 1 T ginger and 1 t red pepper flakes (if not more) to give it a little more spice. Adding red pepper is also very good. With these changes, a great weeknight dinner - quick and delicious.

WOW! I wanted a thai-esque recipe that didn't involve the blender. (Do you know how hard it is to wash peanut butter out of the blender? Bleck!) My husband likes spicy food but I don't like it too spicy. This dish pleased us both. He just added more flaked red pepper to the dish after I served it up and he was happy. I recommend seasoning the meat while cooking it. That was the only compliant. The ground turkey was bland. Next time I will add some of the pepper to the meat to add a bit of spice to the dish. I was very pleased with how easy this was to prepare and it had nice presentation too. A great change from the standard mid-week meals. I cut the recipe in half, but did not skimp on any ingredients. The only thing I changed was the heat the veggies with the meat before tossing - just enough to warm them and wilt the green onions.

I LOVE this recipe -- leftovers are even better cold! I cut back the peanut butter, too, and I use chicken instead of turkey. I buy the pre-cooked chicken at the store and shred it myself to save time.

Great way to use up leftover chicken & a hit with my family! I added about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking liquid, which cut the peanut flavor enough to not overpower other ingredients but still retained enough peanutty flavor. I also served the pasta separately. Next time I'll add some sliced red pepper at the end to liven up the color a bit. Loved the contrast in texture the celery added; fresh bean sprouts would probably work great too.

This is a great peanut sauce, I used the full amount called for and didn't find it at all overpowering. Would suggest cutting down on the amount of noodles or serving them separately. Didn't have enough celery so substituted some orange and red peppers and bean sprouts. Great with rice too instead of pasta.

I added red bell pepper, snow peas, and bean sprouts to the recipe - delicious. It also works great over rice instead of pasta.

This is a great peanut sauce. Following others' advice, I lessened the amount of peanut butter (using only 1/3 cup). Also, I used crunchy natural peanut butter b/c it was all I had in the pantry--the peanuts added a nice texture along with the crunchiness of the celery. Substituted sauted chicken breast for the turkey and only used 3/4 pound of pasta.

My husband and I thought this was great - much better than I had expected! I substituted chicken for turkey and red peppers for celery and reduced the amount of peanut butter to 1/2 cup. I thought the combination was perfect, definitely the best peanut sauce I've ever had.

Ugh! As one reviewer said, you'd better like peanut butter! I do, but this time, it overpowered the dish. I just didn't like the taste of turkey, pasta, and peanut butter together. Doubt I'd take the time to adjust this recipe.

This dish was a hit with my entire family. I have two children ages 2 and 5, and wanted to try this because it contained peanut butter. I should have added some of the reserve liquid as suggested by the recipe, which would have brought out more the of flavor of the wonderful sauce. I substituted shredded chicken for the turkey and Thai spices for the red pepper. It was very easy.

I made the full sauce amount, but cut pasta and meat (I used leftover pork roast) in half for 3 of us. I think it would have been too dry with a whole pound of pasta. It was good, but tasted like there was something missing. Maybe more garlic?? I'll definitely make this again, but play with it.

If you like peanut butter, you will LOVE this recipe. It is good, easy to make, but definitely not for those who don't like peanut butter flavor. The combination of flavors is interesting. My husband loved it, my son turned up his nose, I thought it was fine.

so disappointing. an americanized version of pad thai. for those who cook and eat more authentic thai, don't bother. this is even after adding some more traditional thai ingredients that i happened to have on hand: palm sugar, fish sauce, tamerind concentrate, shrimp paste....

A tasty, different way to use up all of the leftover turkey. I added extra Thai spices and everyone (including 2 kids) loved it. Great cold, too.

Great stuff! love the combination. I used indonesian sambal oelek to spice it up and added some ginger syrup in stead of sugar. Great with lemon grass and a chillie cucumber/yogurt salad Bon appetit

If you like Thai food you'll love this recipe. We used it as an after Thanksgiving turkey dish! Use original Thai noodles instead of Linguine. Has a nice bite to it, but not overpowering.
