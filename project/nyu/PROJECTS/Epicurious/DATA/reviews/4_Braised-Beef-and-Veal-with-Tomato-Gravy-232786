Excellent! I added mushrooms at the beginning and Carrots and potatoes half way through. Yummy!

Just to be up front - I changed this recipe a tad - used all beef and a rub from Penzy's. Nontheless - it was fantastic and even better the second day!

Delicious! Used just veal, added brown sugar to counter the spicyness, extra wine and served over buttered herbed egg noodles. Rave reviews, and amazing leftovers.

Used a large veal shoulder blade steak, no beef. Didn't pound the veal either. Also used a seasoning mix on hand named "Butt Rub". It was great! The veal was very tender and the flavors blended wonderfully. Great leftovers.

Very, very good. I also will forego pounding out the meat as the braising will tenderize the cuts just fine. I served this over polenta, rather than grits, and it was just incredibly delicious.

Made this last night and intended to say I'd not make again, just because I have some other similar recipes that are easier. Had some leftovers this morning and changed my mind. I will make it again, but will use sirloin instead or round steak. The beef did not get as tender as I like. I will also just cube the meat and toss in flour mixture and saute. Pounding all of those little pieces took too much time.

Delicious. I simmered about 45 min. longer than the recipe called for, and the gravy thickened up nicely. However, I think the veal is unnecessary. The beef was so much more flavorful. Also, why flatten out the meat? This was a time-consuming step, and it simmers so long that the meat becomes very tender. I would skip that next time.

Emeril never fails, this dish was amazing! Would concider foregoing the beef for all veal. The sauce on its own was fantastic and would be great over egg nodles if you didn't want the grits. Great comfort food for cold weather! This one will be in our regular meals for a long time to come!
