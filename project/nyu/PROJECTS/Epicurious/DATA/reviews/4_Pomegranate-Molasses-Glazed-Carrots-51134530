This flavor was great- unexpectedly delicious and a wonderful blend of tart and sweet. Just FYI, my carrots didn't brown in the 5 minutes indicated.

Yum! Just a little sweet, just a little tangy. Good on their own, but a great complement to the more complicated flavors of the Christmas dinner menu. Takes longer to brown/caramelize than recipe indicates.

This was OK. I loved the texture of the carrots and I usually love pomegranate molasses, but these were too tart for my personal tastes. I will probably cook the carrots in this manner again, but create a different glaze. Technically sound recipe, just not to my tastes.

I had bought a bottle of pomegranate molasses and was looking for more recipes to try when I came across this one and it's a winner! So easy and absolutely delicious. I was a little concerned that it might be a bit sweet with the honey and molasses but the pom. molasses gives it a nice fruity tang and it was perfect. This will definitely be our new go-to carrot recipe.
