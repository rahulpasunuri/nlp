These were perfect with my bean soup, especially right out of the oven. If you do 12 muffins they each turn out quite small. When you just barely combine the wet and dry ingredients the muffin texture turns out well.

I have made much better corn muffins although the bacon did add some newness. I would never make these for a breakfast again...only to be partnered with some new orleans style dinner foods.

Rather heavy, dense muffins. If you leave your bacon fairly large, the pieces will lose all crispiness. These are probably best as a breakfast substitute.

Not my favorite corn muffin recipe. The bacon weighed down the muffins, and the result was much too heavy.

these muffins tasted good (how can they not with bacon?) but they were VERY dense & heavy. not sure i did something wrong but not worth it to try them again.

Decent - although i followed the 2 reviewers suggestions to omit the sugar & I wish I hadn't. They need some sugar.

I've been making these for years and I agree, never, never add the sugar. Sometimes I add a little shredded cheddar. They're satisfying with almost any vegetable soup to complete a meal.

I am giving this 3 forks with a reservation! In order for them earn the 3 rating you MUST omit all of the sugar! Making these savory muffins with any sweetness will reduce the rating to a 1 fork (or less). With no sugar they are delightful and a great compliment to a heavy bean soup. It's a perfect winter combo!
