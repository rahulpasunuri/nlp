I made this with Israeli feta and it was pretty darn good. I think the thing pushed it over the edge from an "alright" dish to "great" was the brown butter sauce I made to go over the top of the chicken (roasted asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes on the side). I used the same pan the shallots/rosemary were in and burned about 3-4 Tbsp of butter in it. I then added the pan jus from the chicken when it came out of the oven. Seriously awesome. Will definitely make this again.

Easy, moist and you could vary the goat cheese mixture if you wanted to. For example, adding sundried tomatoes, garlic, etc... My chicken (bone in skin on) did take more than 25 min to cook though... about 35.. they were quite large. YMMV. Made a side of roasted brussels sprouts and opened a nice Grenache. Couldn't have been better. Definitely a keeper.

Incredibly good recipe. Made it twice in a month. I put it in at 425 for 25 minutes, then broiled it for the last few minutes to give the skin a beautiful crispiness.

An awesome recipe for chicken. I don't like a lot of rosemary so I used less and it tasted very good. Also, I recommend using the chicken breast with skin/bone vs. skinless chicken breast. I have done both and for some reason the chicken breast with bone and skin comes out more moist.

This recipe was easy, moist and delicious. I prepared it the day before and baked it for 30 minutes instead of 25 since the breasts were large.

Delicious! Made this directly according to the recipe, only leaving the chicken in for about 5 or so more minutes than recommended after reading some of the other reviews. My husband loved it, so I'll definitely make this again!

This is fantastic. I have made this multiple times and it comes out perfect each time. I use herbed goat cheese and instead of baking it on a baking sheet I bake it in a casserole dish. It makes it extra moist. This has become a dinner staple in my house.

I made this for Sunday dinner and it was a HIT. I used skinless,boneless breast and stuffed each breast leaving enough cheese sauce for a dollop on top of each breast after grilling. I did grill the chicken on a baking sheet to avoid flare ups at 425 for 30 minutes

Really delicious. I used skinless, boneless breasts and just put the stuffing mixture on top. The chicken came out moist and flavorful.

I made this last night and I followed the suggestions of the previous reviews saying to double the stuffing. I did precisely that and it was delicious! For side items I braised some brussel sprouts and sauteed zuchinni and squash.

Good, but not as good as I had hoped for. Used boneless/skinless breasts and that was probably the problem. Will try this again soon with skin-on breasts.

Rating: 4
Just so easy for the flavor and elegance. I had some herbed feta on hand and it was great along with the rosemary. I think it is key to use good quality chicken. I didn't have a lot of cheese so the filling was sparse but still great. I also roasted small potatoes alongside.

I made this for my brother's birthday dinner and he really liked it. We both agreed that it would have been 4 forks had there been more shallots...so next time I'll add more. I served it with roasted yukon gold potatoes and a mixed greens salad with balsamic dressing. YUM!

needs much more filling for two breasts double the recipe please

I made this tonight - no butter so used olive oil and it was still wonderful! I used boneless, skinless breasts and spread the cheese mixture on top - it stayed on nicely. Even my 2 year old ate it! I made four in total and subbed mozzarella on my husband's piece - he hates goat cheese - and he thought it worked well.

Absolutely delicious dish with very little effort. Like others, I used feta and dried rosemary which I had on hand. I, too, found it took longer to cook, a good 40 minutes. I Ididn't bother with the toothpicks and found some of my cheese did ooze out. Next time I will try the suggestion of a reviewer from a different but similar recipe on this site who suggested putting thick bread slices under the chicken on the side where the stuffing could ooze out which absorbed it, crisped up and gave you a kind of "side" dish. I'm also considering cutting a small pocket in the breast and putting the stuffing there instead of under the skin.

Rating: 3
This recipe is easy and delicious. I used fresh rosemary and added a clove of minced garlic. Like another reviewer, I subbed feta cheese for the goat cheese. The breasts I bought were so large that I cut them into two pieces each. I cooked them on top of sprigs of fresh rosemary for extra flavor.

Rating: 4
Delicious! My onion/shallot-fearing husband even adored it and is already requesting again! I made exactly as written with dried rosemary. May try with skinless breasts, but I think I would cut a pocket in for the goat cheese as opposed to just putting on top. I used A LOT less butter than the recipe called for.

Typo: I meant to get the chicken to 145 using a meat thermometer.

Excellent. I didn't have goat cheese so mixed crumbled feta and parmesan and it came out great. Cooked two large in-bone breasts with skin and it took about 45 minutes to get them to 14--very moist.

This is a tasty, crowd pleasing recipe. I wouldn't serve it for a fancy dinner party, its better for a quiet evening at home with friends and a good wine. I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and just spooned the cheese on top and popped it in the oven. So easy. I mixed a little Boursin cheese with the goat cheese for a little more flavor.

Lazy variation: I combined white wine, stock, goat cheese, rosemary & shallots and warmed all in a saucepan to dissolve the cheese. I baked the breasts in this mixture. When done, I removed the chicken and covered with foil to keep warm. I poured the baked sauce back into the original saucepan and reduced on med high heat until creamy, about 5 minutes. Served sauce over chicken with a sprinkle of rosemary on top. Very yummy, quick and easy.

Great dish! I've used boneless, skinless chicken breasts with great success -- either make roulades or stuff the breasts or just pop the goat cheese mixture on top and bake!

I've been making this for years. My suggestions: Use whole chicken breast halves with bone and skin. Increase the amount of cheese and add a bit of garlic. Salt and pepper the breasts. Finally, I bake this in a dish with some dry vermouth and a little broth. I make a thin sauce of the chicken broth and vermouth to pour over the chicken . Easy and delicious.

I've made this recipe twice in the last week, it was that delicious! Once for family and then wowed company with it. I cut up some Kalamata olives along with the garlic and herb goat cheese. The best part was using free range, organic chicken breasts from the farmer's market. Takes about 1 hour with the bone-in breasts. Superb!

Would I make this again? We make it all the time - favorite way to do chicken breasts when it's just the two of us on a weeknight. Using herbed goat cheese perks it up a bit, as does some chopped Kalamata olives or sundried tomatoes. Instead of rubbing the skin with butter, try spraying with EVOO.

YUM! And so pretty looking, too! It browned up beautifully, and stayed perfectly moist throughout what were unusually large chicken breasts. I served it with broccoli rabe/pecorino cheese recipe, and wild rice. Topped it off with a bottle of Sonoma Syrah. Lovely dinner! And so very easy. Perfect for a week night.

I was looking for something new to do with chicken and I found a recipe that was delicious! This recipe is VERY simple and quick to put together. I did have to cook it a bit longer than the recipe stated. I also misted the breasts with olive oil instead of the butter. I would imagine that this would be a great meal to serve guests as the finished product smells wonderful and the skin was beautifully golden and crispy. The chicken was unbelievably tender. My husband loved it- finished every bite! I will make this one again.

I agree with the timing comment of the last reviewer. I've made it a few times (with bone), and it definitely needs much more than 25 minutes. Otherwise good and really easy.

I've served this dish three times at three separate dinner parties and not once have I had a guest leave a morsel on his or her plate. It's especially perfect for a Friday night supper with company; you can stuff the breasts in the morning before leaving for work and pop them in the oven when you get home. I prepare exactly as specified but find that the chicken requires 20 minutes more cooking time than the recipe states. Other than that, I highly recommend it.

Had a good flavor, but the boneless chicken breasts I used were too thick so it was somewhat dry. Next time I will pound them much thinner. I served it on a bed of herbed couscous. Easy.

This is a staple recipe--easy enough for every night dinners (and reheats wonderfully for lunch the following day) yet impressive enough for guests.

This is a delicious and simple dish. I always use boneless skinless breasts now as they're simpler and come our perfect every time. I also have used onion instead of shallot and even have used those goat cheese crumbles premade for salads (don't add more herbs in those cases). While it's best plain goat cheese, the crumbles are great in a pinch! Really excellent dish that never fails to WOW guests.

I'm not known as much of a cook, so this went over like a house on fire. I think more so because people don't think I can pull this kind of thing off! It was VERY easy, looked impressive, and yes, it tasted good, too. I don't really think I would make it again as I would seek something more to my tastes, but it did turn out very well, so I've said "YES" anyways. Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and it turned out just fine.

I LOVED this. The sweetness of the chicken toned down the strength of the goat cheese perfectly. I too made it with boneless breasts and just spread the cheese on top prior to baking. Yum, yum, YUM! I am making this for my parents when they come to visit in a couple of weeks. It's sure to impress.

I really liked this recipe. It was simple and delicious. I am interested to try it with pounded boneless chicken as my hubby prefers chicken that way rather than with skin and bones. I cooked mine about ten minutes longer and used regular onions instead of shallots. I was surprised the cheese didn't melt out of the chicken!

I think this is one of the best recipes that I have ever made for how simple it is. When I have made it I have just done a slight alteration. Instead of stuffing the chesse mixture in the chicken, I have spread it ontop of the chicken and then baked it about 25 minutes. It comes out looking so good and there is never any left over between my girlfriend and I. Everyone I have given this reccipe loves it and says it is so simple.

I made this dish for a garlic loving friend, so I took the advice of the cook from Salem Oregon and added garlic to the mixture.

This dish is very tasty. The one thing I am going to change when I make it again is to double the cheese filling so that those flavors come out more. I used whole boneless skinless chicken breasts; pounded them out then covered one half with the filling and folded the other over it.
