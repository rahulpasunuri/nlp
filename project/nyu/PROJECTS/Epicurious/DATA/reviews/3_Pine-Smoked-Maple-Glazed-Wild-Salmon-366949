1 out of 14 comments is actually a review. The Epicurious review process is more of a joke than this recipe.

It looks like I am the first person who actually attempted to make this recipe before reviewing it. I have been trying to increase my consumption of oily fish, but never much cared for salmon when I made it in the past. Although I was hoping that the pine flavor would be strong, it was subtle, but nice. The glaze added a pleasant maple-sweetness, but I would probably re-glaze halfway though the cooking next time to up the ante, and on my grill, I might also cut the cooking time to 10 minutes. Also, I think next time I will put a piece of foil under the needles to protect my cast iron skillet from sticky sap. Overall though, this recipe presents a clean and simple salmon that I will definitely make again. Try it! You might just like it.

I plank smoke the wild B.C. salmon over alder chips on the Egg. I finish it with cracked pepper and a ceder syrup glaze. I always use an alder or ceder plank. But pine needles? Blech!

Oh my! I might just have to try this, don't worry, I will take great care not to "...drizzle combustible bourbon into the flames". Wish me luck!

From the sound of the other reviews it appears that the editors have left the building leaving the loonies in charge.

I don't ever remember howling with laughter at anything on this site before but this recipe and the previous comments are a hoot! Maybe it really is a joke????

This one just seems strange. Is there nobody at Epicurious vetting these things?

I think cooking with carcinogens seems risky. I think pine needles have the capacity to release creosote, which WILL kill you. Good luck with this... I am going to also light the briquets with NEWS PAPER soaked in Turpentine just to make sure this recipe does kill me!

Really?! This is written by a specialist in campfire cookery? Where would "one" find this campground, Buckingham Palace? Does "one" wash the kitchen floor with the pine scented glaze or eat it? It does confuse "one".

Using Pine needles successfully sounds interesting. But calling for "freshly tapped maple syrup" makes me disregard the recipe altogether. There's no such thing! What you get "freshly tapped" from a maple tree is sap.

You have to be kidding? Freshly tapped Grade B maple syrup? How about a recipe for the rest of us that don't live on a farm in Vermont?

I'm sorry,but it sounds like a waste of good bourbon..I've tried to use pine needles before like this and it do not work out...too strong a flavor.

It does seem oddly written but I couldn't actually get past the word "whilst" . I had pine in a turkey brine once and had to discard it becasue it tasted too much like a degreaser. I would try this prep on the grill minus the pine.

Wow...This recipe sounds like a "truth or dare". Could it be more disjointed?
