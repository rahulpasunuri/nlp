Freekeh can be hard to find, but should not deter anyone from trying it with another whole grain if not available. I found the vinaigrette too acidic and bland, so I cut out the lemon juice, added black pepper and used a little less sherry vinegar (actually, increased everything to taste except the vinegar), which came out fantastic--2+ TBSP of oil for the kale seemed excessive to me, which would affect the balance. Also cooked pilaf with broth and garlic, rather than browning the crushed garlic.

I found cleaned (no stones or dirt) freekeh @ freekehlicious.com It is delicious and was not aware of the nutritional value - high in fiber & protein, low carbs and low GI - excellent for me to manage my diabetes. This can also be found in Whole Foods in NYC. This will not doubt be the next quinoa.

This is a simple, delicious, easy, and nutritious recipe. I especially like the vinaigrette, and the freekeh, which is a new grain for me. I used dried yellow raisins instead of the Hunza raisins, and made fresh spinach and red chard instead of the kale. As others have noted, this recipe adapts well...perhaps string beans next time!

Very flavorful and satisfying! I'm not huge on chicken breast meals, but this one makes a chicken breast taste great. Didn't have freekeh, but substituted a mix of ancient grains with the lentils and it worked perfectly. The vinaigrette was very tasty!!! I also substituted beet greens for the kale because I had some fresh beets already on hand. YUM! YUM! YUM! Definitely would recommend this for a tasty, super healthful meal :)

I was not able to find the Freekeh but substituted Casbah Lentil Pilaf. Worked very well. As noted, the vinaigrette is twice what is needed. I used the extra on a beet root salad two days later and it was excellent. Very distinctive taste.

This was amazing! The vinaigrette was delicious! I accidentally forgot I was cooking lentils and overcooked them a bit, so I pureed them. I didn't get to toss them like a pilaf but it still tasted wonderful. I cannot wait to make this again (with the properly cooked lentils).
