This soup was delicious! It was a little watery for my taste so I might cut back on the amount of clam juice/broth I added. I left out the bacon and it still was delicious! Can't wait to make it again.

Excellent recipe. I used more bacon and about a tablespoon more of flour. Also I found for the consistency that we like I only needed 2 jars of clam juice. Very very good.

Have made this many times, but always substitute the clam juice for chicken stock as clam juice is very expensive where I live. The recipe is simple and always turns out great.

fabo. no need for the cream ...just blend a cup or two

I followed the advice to add more bacon, and the advice to use heavy cream instead of half-and-half, but I left the "hot sauce" out of the original recipe. I figured that adding extra bacon would up the salt content and additional salt from the "hot sauce" would render the result way too salty. It was very good, but next time I will alter things a bit. 10 minutes for the potatoes wasn't enough. Next time it will be 13 or 14 minutes in the boiling clam juice. The celery needed a bit more time than the onion in the saute. Next time the celery goes in first and a few minutes later the onion is added.

This clam chowder is soo good! I used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half and used 1/2 pound bacon. The butter isn't necessary. Strained off some of the bacon grease. Perfect recipe for a lazy Sunday afternoon of football!

I eagerly anticipate cold weather just so I can make this chowder. I follow other reviewers and use 7 cans of clams (but juice only from 6) and cook extra potatoes to puree and add back in order to thicken the chowder slightly. Also add a bit of good dry white wine after the flour has been incorporated into the veg.

Delicious and simple. Quick to prepare. Plenty clammy!

Ditto on adding more bacon. Also, make sure that you let your veggies truly soften before adding the clams and half and half. I strained the potatoes(make sure they are not TOO tender, plenty of liquids left. All in all, a keeper

I mostly followed the recipe, but did add a dash of Worchestershire, as reviewers suggested. It was great! Next time, I will try to thicken with just a touch more flour, but all in all, it was delicious.

This recipe is so good I've passed it on to my friends. I just made two changes: since clam juice is expensive, I just use one can and then use vegetable stock after that. Also, a sprinkle of worchestershire sauce is recommended.

Rating: 4
Excellent as a first course for Thanksgiving. I made these amendments: To make it whiter and creamier, substitute heavy cream for half-and-half -- highly recommended. Add 50% more bacon for flavor; turkey bacon works. If you have serious foodies as dinner guests, then serve this way: At the table, pour about 1 tablespoon sherry into center of each guest's bowl. Guests stir it in (as in high-end restaurants). Elevates it from "very good" to out of this world. PS -- for one batch, I tried substituting red potatoes. Stick with russets.

This was excellent. I added a couple of extra slices of bacon and some fresh thyme. I also pureed about half of the potato's with the clam juice to make it a little more 'soupy'. It makes a lot of chowder. I'd probably make a half recipe next time or possibly a third of a recipe for a quick meal for 2 people.

Wow! This is really restaurant style clam chowder! Followed the recipe but added another few potatoes and 4 cans whole cherrystone clams, chopped in the cuisinart and 1 pound bay shrimp. Served in small sourdough bowls. Deeelishus!! Can't wait to have tomorrow for leftovers!

This was really good. I forgot the bay leaf. It was tasty and full of veggies. I wanted it thicker so I used a bit more flower. The 1 tsp hot pepper sauce makes it pretty spicy so, if you don't like it spicy, use less. Oyster crackers and bread and a salad make it a nice full dinner.

I've used epi for years--usually great recipes...this is the best chowder we have ever had including restaurants! I never take the time to write a review but I wanted to add my 2 cents worth: I used 6 slices of bacon, twice as much potatoes (white and gold), and fat free half and half...the bottled clam juice while expensive was worth it...and I used both snows and geisha brands...my hubby said it was the best meal ever (second course) was pork chops and brown rice and we have been married for 27 years and that's a lot of home cooked meals...definitely do this recipe...you will be in heaven...my picky 21yd loved it too!!!!!!

I followed the directions pretty closely, but I only had a cup of half and half; I made up the rest in heavy whipping cream. I'm glad the recipe makes a large amount because everybody in my family had at least three bowls! It was a huge hit, and I'll definitely make it again.

I've now made this several times, and kept simple, it is the only recipe for clam chowder, so simple and so delicious! As for myself, I do not want to go into a restaurant and order the gravy, without the biscuits, that they call clam chowder, It feels like soup.... It tastes like soup... it gets me spoiled because I will never make the potage without the enjoyment of its simplicity.

My husband said this tasted just like our favorite clam chowder from Giovanni's, in Morro Bay, California. I followed the recipe except that I used four small cans of minced clams and one large can of whole baby clams. I rinsed them because I don't like that taste of canned juice, so I added some water to make up the difference. No salt needed!

I have made this chowder recipe since it came out in BA in 2000 every year for Christmas Eve supper. It is now a family tradition. Follow the recipe exactly...it will come out great. I've found that it is even better if made the day before! While living in Boston, I frequented Skipjack's and LOVED this chowder. Amazingly, mine tastes just the same!

Great! We like a lot of clams - Used the Costco size 51 oz clams - did the less onion and 1/3 cup flour and used about 2 c of the reserved clam juice. Didn't double anything....might use the extra clam reserve juice (still had 2c) in place of some of the clam broth for the potatoes next time. Perfect texture and taste on a winter day.

I had a few thing to use up so I did not follow this recipe exactly but i stuck pretty close to it and the chowder was great. I used a handful of pancetta instead of bacon and 1/4 cup heavy cream + 1 cup whole milk instead of half-and-half. The chowder thickened well, tasted rich and had a nice bit of heat from the tabasco. It won two thumbs up from a teenager who considers himself a chowder expert. I plan to use this recipe for years to come, it's a keeper.

I live on Cape Cod and have been making this chowder for several years. It is the best I've tried and those to whom I serve it love it without exception. I make just a few alterations: 1) I substitute salt pork for the bacon (more flavorful and more 'authentic' in my experience); 2) I use frozen chopped clams and 3) I cut down just a bit on the quantity of onions and celery. I love the consistency - so much better than the very thick concoction often served in restaurants.

I've made this recipe a number of times and it's fantastic, even with the substitutions I have to make to accommodate my dietary restrictions.Here are the changes I made in case others are interested in making it dairy or gluten free: I substituted margarine for the butter; 1/4 cup all purpose GF flour mix (I used a mix of 2 parts brown rice flour, 1 part potato starch, 1 part tapioca starch) for the all-purpose flour and 3/4 cup rice milk for the half & half. (If you want it to be a bit thicker or creamier, you could also try using hemp milk or stirring in some arrowroot to thicken up the broth.) Still, even w/ the changes I made, it tastes great and you can't tell it's wheat and dairy free! Enjoy!

Made this wonderful chowder for the 2nd time last night. The 1st time I made it I used 1/2 cup flour to thicken, but felt it was too pasty. This time I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. I like firmer potatoes, so next time I will cube some yellow boiling potatoes.

Made this for the first time today, and the flavor was excellent. I used thick sliced pepper bacon (which I had on hand). I used 3 cans of whole baby clams and 2 small cans of chopped clams. I only had 2 bottles of clam juice on hand. Next time I will go for the third bottle. I did increase the flour as did others to just under 1/2 cup. I thought this was just a bit thick because I probably did not have enough clam juice. So I thinned it a bit with lowfat milk; though I did use the half and half. I also added a few dashes of tabasco and about 1/2 thyme. Delicious and I would make it again.

I think this is the best clam chowder ever. I prefer the thinner broth so this works for me. I always double the recipe and use the giant size cans each of clams and clam juice. The giant size they have at Smart & Final. That brings the price down a bit but it is still on the pricey side. As mentioned, worth every penny when you can do it.

This was a really good recipe. Next time, I would use 1/2 a bay leaf. It was better the next day. I took the advice of the reviewers and used a heaping 1/3 cup of flour so it would be a little thicker. My only complaint is that it's pretty expensive, but for a special treat, it's worth it.

I always double this recipe -- it makes the best leftovers!! I like my chowder a little on the thicker side, so I usually add a little more flour (2 extra T. or so), and I skimp on the half & half.

Don't listen to the last reviewer! Clearly they did not make this dish. If they would have read more closely, this recipe DOES, in fact, include bacon. This is a great, basic chowder recipe and I have used it befoe as written. I also used this to make my own thing by subbing japanese sweet potato for the russets, turkey bacon for the bacon, goat milk and soymilk for the half and half, whole wheat flour for the flour, and non dairy "butter" for the butter. It turned out amazing! (I wasn't sure about the combination in the first place) Very thick and delicious with a dash of salt.

Delicious! After reading the comments about thickness, I used heavy cream instead of half and half. You don't want to use more flour, because if there is more flour than fat (from butter and bacon), it will be pasty. Served on a rainy night with bread and spinach salad.

As a Massachusetts native, I made this for the Patriots vs Giants Superbowl party. My team didn't win, unfortunately, but this chowder did! Everyone raved about it, and they appreciated that there was no heavy cream used, only 1/2 & 1/2. Only thing I did a little differently - I bought Gordons Cocktail Clams in the 15 oz can. I used 2 cans and chopped them myself. I don't like the clams to be too small, which is how they are already chopped, plus they were tender and less chewy than the other type. Plus the juice is much better. This is a keeper for sure!

I was born and raised in New England so I know what good chowder tastes like. This recipe makes an excellent chowder.

I made this with fresh chopped clams instead of canned, seafood stock instead of clam juice, and leeks and shallots instead of half the onions. It was very popular. It's a very good base recipe that you can improvise with. I agree with the other reviewers who added more flour; I used 1/2 cup.

I don't follow the measurements exactly, just use what looks right. For the clams/clam juice, I only use what is in the Costco size can (which probably decreases servings). I use unpeeled red potatoes. The longer they simmer, the thicker the chowder becomes, yet the skin helps keep it chunky. Also, for a little more heat, I use peppered bacon. I have made this twice now and have received rave reviews!

Having never been to Boston, I'd thought that I knew what Boston Clam Chowder was, regardless. NOT!

This is one of the best Clam Chowders I have ever had the pleasure of eating. Being a cold, snowy November day it just felt like Chowder time, so off I went to the store to get the ingredents. As soon as I arrived home the electricty went out. I wasn't about to be cheated out of my bowl of clam goodness so I cut up the veggies by candle light and then out to the garage I went with camp stove and lantern in tow. A romantic candle light dinner with my Lady Friend ensued. Then the power came back on. Oh well, good ambiance, good food and then lights to clean up by. Just one thought, I found the chowder a bit thin so added a roux of 1/2C half and half and two Tbsp corn starch. This thickened it up quite nicely. I will make this again!!!

Rating: 3
I thought this was a delicious and easy clam chowder. I followed the recipe exactly, except I followed other reviewers and added more flour. I think next time I will add even more than an extra 1/4 cup because it didn't come out very thick at all. I also added just a little more hot sauce. It's true, that really is a key ingredient!

This is an excellent chowder and so easy to make! To serve this chowder I bought some mini bread bowls from my local bakery. I hollowed them out, sprayed the inside with olive oil and rubbed with crushed garlic. I backed them for 10 minutes then filled with the chowder. I served with the baked top as well for a bread dipper. It was wonderful!! My husband had to refill his bowl because he did not get enough chowder the first time around. I had only one complaint from my 10 year old, he was too full to finish his bowl:)

There is nothing complicated about making this chowder, and the end result is delicious. I would recommend using a little more than 1/4 of a cup of flour (perhaps 3 tablespoons more) to thicken it up a bit. I'm not a fan of super thick chowders that could be spread with a spatula; I just found that this was too thin. Also, I didn't need to add any salt at the end - presumably the clam juice had salt in it? I would warn people to beware of salting the onions and celery etc. along the way. You might wind up with a really salty chowder. Overall, this one's a keeper.

Today we went to the Cheescake Factory for lunch, where I had their clam chowder. I thought it was wonderful, so I bought some to go, came home and proceeded to try to make it. Using this recipe as a base, I made the following changes: Chop all vegetables very fine. Eliminate the bacon. Use Red Potatos. Add 2 to 3 carrots, chopped fine and cook with the potatos. Add thyme, a stick of butter, and the equivalent of 1 to 2 bouillon cubes. Be sure to disolve the bouillon in a bit of hot water, and add the broth PRIOR to seasoning, or the soup may end up too salty. The last step really added a savory quality lacking in the original recipe.

Rating: 3
Easy one dish supper paired with a tossed salad and some hushpuppies. I should have let the celery and onions saute a bit longer, let them become soft, as opposed to softened... they did not become much softer in the remaining simmering time. As indicated by previous reviewers, the cream base on this chowder is thinner than most, but with the abundant amount of clams and vegetables, I preferred the thinner soup... thicker may have been a bit too rich. This recipe's a keeper.

This is a pretty good recipe, but really with clam chowder I just wing it. Being a cape codder, I just dig my own clams.p> I simply start with a big collander full of clams(hard shell!) and just steam them open (not cooked). shuck them into a food processor and chop them to you have a coarsely chopped, soupy mess. If you steam the clams until they're rubbery, they release all their water...so you should reserve your cooking water if they're dry. Peel and cube (1inch) four large potatoes, cook only until firm..8mins? Brown up half a pound of chopped bacon, scoop it out and toss in two large chopped onions, saute until soft, toss in some minced garlic, cook for one min then dump in clams and four cups milk. Add some parsely and maybe some chopped chives. Simmer for 15mins or so then add potatoes. Heat for 30 minutes or so and enjoy...even better if you let it rest overnight! If you have alot of clams simply make the base with clams, bacon and onion. freezes for a few months nicely. Chowder should be fairly thin, not thick like you get from a can! Even legal seafoods chowder is getting too thick! You shouldn't be adding flour, and I make my chowder with whole milk or 2% with the bacon adding alot of fat to make it creamy. If you follow oldtime chowder recipes, they're very thin.

Rating: 4
This clam chowder was excellent. I used fresh clams (2 lbs.) rather than canned and added about a tsp of thyme leaves and 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream. I would suggest leaving the potatoes a little more firm because they seemed to mash into the clam chowder a bit (I prefer more potato pieces). Although I doubled the bacon the next time I will add even more. I may also add some scallions and an extra bottle of clam juice. I did not find this soup to be too thin - maybe because I added the cream? I'll definately make this again.

I have a life-long love affair with NE clam chowder and this is definitely the best I have ever had. I used uncured applewood-smoked bacon, 50% more clams, and left out the potatoes completely (which in my opinion just detract from the clams). After reading the warnings about a thin chowder, I reserved my final addition of clam juice until the end of the process and added until the consistency was what I wanted. It was perfect. Incidentally, for more claminess, reduce the clam juice a bit prior to chowder prep.

Excellent recipe, and a good base for improvisation. I make this by request (insistence?) every year for when my husband has his friends out to our home on Martha's Vineyard for a fishing weekend. I like to add fresh thyme, a little chopped parsley and more bacon, reserving some crisp bits for garnish. I also tend to make this for a crowd, so I use a quart each of heavy cream, light cream and whole milk, adjusting the proportions of the rest of the ingredients to approximate the recipe. We love it!

Great recipe - do know an even better one, if I can get my friend to give it up! I used fresh clams and juice, 1/4 cup of flour plus 3 tablespoons and great consistancy - not too thin and not too thick.

This is the second time I have made this delicious chowder. It IS thinner than Legal's ( a standard around here), so if that is your preference, I would suggest using more flour and less reserved clam juice. I will try it that way next time to experiment. But, my husband, kids, and their friends,all native Bostonians, have laped up bowls all weekend (it doubled very easily), and this is my forever recipe.

This was my first attempt in making clam chowder, so I followed the recipe blindly and it was delicious! Definitely a keeper for those cold winter evenings.

Rating: 4
Okay, first off, I didn't use this recipe exactly. I used it more as a guideline because most chowders do not have enough veggies for me. I added more celery, and tossed in mushrooms and carrots, as well as adding in crab meat and shrimp for variety. And I didn't use a bay leaf or pepper sauce. I just used about a tablespoon of Mrs. Dash. Oh, and I added black pepper at the end. So, it is and is not like the recipe above, and I would make it again. I think bacon is the secret ingredient.

Made this once before, and making it again for superbowl. My friends just love it! As a native New Englander, I find myself loading it up with hot sauce.... now that we live in the South!! Who knew....

Rating: 0
I doubled the bacon, used some cream and fresh minced clams (1 1/2 pounds) as recommended by a previous reviewer. The soup was very good, however I didn't think it was thick enough - next time I would add extra potatoes and puree them to thicken. Then it might be 4 forks.

This was so creamy and delicious! Had leftover heavy cream from the holidays and used that and added a quite a bit of black pepper. Otherwise, stuck to recipe.

Very easy to make. We used on 2 bottles of clam juice with the potatoes and one 8 oz bottle of water and it still tasted wonderful. There is so much clam juice from the cans that it doesn't matter.

Surprised at the amount of flavor. Will make again.

Outstanding. I made this the night before and just warmed up to serve. My husband ate a second bowl and set aside another for lunch the next day. That's a rave review from him. More than enough for 4 main course servings. I thought that the hot pepper sauce was an odd ingredient, but it really added a nice zip to the flavor.

Rating: 3
A relatively simple clam chowder recipe that gave me very good results. I substituted whole baby clams for the chopped clams, and they made the soup even heartier. It's not as thick as you might expect a chowder to be, but if you like it thicker, you can use a bit more flour and use substitute in some heavy cream. Overall, a nice recipe that I'd use again.

Rating: 3
Very nice! Just the right thickness, not too soupy and not too thick. (I hate floury chowders--I live in Boston, a block from a Legal and several other supposedly great chowder places, and find most of them too goopy and pasty) Made this for lunch on a rainy fall day. I forgot the hot pepper sauce and garlic (and intentionally didn't use the bacon), but the taste was strong enough that I don't think it needed anything else. I made just a third of a batch (recipe scales down well: 1 bottle of clam juice, 2 cans of clams, 1 med onion, 1 stalk celery, etc.), to serve two for lunch. Easy and satisfying, I'll be making this one again.

Rating: 4
A lot of bang for the effort!! After reading other reviews I doubled the recipe and used chopped clams from the fish market. I also used 1 qt of half and half and added extra bacon. My son had three large servings and told me I was incredible. I know this will be a regular on the soup rotation this fall and winter.

This is absolutely a restaurant-quality recipe. Easy too! I've made many chowder recipes & this wins- no contest. I followed the suggestion of prior reviewers & used a entire pint of half & half. Doubled the bacon & garlic. Being a native Bostonian, I used fresh chopped clams from the fish counter at my local supermarket. Without the resevred juices from the canned clams, the consistency was just perfect- not too thick or thin. I am a huge chowder snob--will ususally only order it a Legal's, so I do not offer this praise lightly.

I made this for a work soup cookoff last winter. I quadrupled the recipe. I would have won first place except once people tasted it they came back for BOWL(s) some as many as three. So I was the first soup that was finished. I felt like winner even if there was not enough to go around. I pointed many people to this link so they could make it for their families. easy and yummy

Rating: 2
I agree with the reader from detroit who deemed this recipie "mediocre". I'm a clam chowder aficionado and any recipe which uses flour to make a roux to compensate for excessive juice is an example of two wrongs not making a right. The use of canned clams is also unacceptable. Don't mean to sound like a food snob, but the recipie's flavor and texture suffer from expedience; the preparation of clams using a broth which is then added to the soup to enrich it is an essential step.

Rating: 2
Overall . . . not impressed. I am a big fan of clam chowders and this really isn't all that great. I followed the build exactly as written and would rate it mediocre. I would use less clam juice to thicken it up a bit. I would also use fresh clams as the canned clams leave a metal flavor in my opinion.

Rating: 3
Very tasty! I used 1 and a half bottles (or so) instead of 3 to make it a thicker chowder. I also used 7 cans of clams and about 6 pieces of bacon so there would be pleanty of "good stuff" since it was my main dish.

Rating: 4
Great clam chowder! The broth here is much less creamy than other New England clam chowder I've had, which is obvious when you see all the clam juice included in the recipe and the relatively little amount of half and half. Still, it's very flavorful and also fairly easy to make.

Rating: 4
This was amazing. I was impressed. Delicious and very tasty. A+++++++ in my book. The best one I have tried. I did however add. 3 extra strips of bacon(cooked seperately) and then chopped in a food chopper to make bacon bits and added it into the cooking. Amazing.

My family goes clam digging once every summer and this is the chowder we eat in the picnic area near the beach. I make the chowder the night before and bbq the clams at the beach then chop and add to the chowder. I try to use bacon that is more flavorful and sliced thicker than the average. I also recommend upping the garlic. Also, make sure to use enough clams to give the soup a clammy-enough flavor. Delicious!

First attempt at Clam Chowder and my guests and I loved the results! It was such a hit that I was asked to share the recipe with them. It was easy to prepare and I did add a bit more cream and an extra slice or two of bacon. I will definitely be preparing this again!

Rating: 4
I can't understand the reviewer who said this was too runny and too fishy. I came from Boston, my family has been there since the Puritan days, and this chowder tastes like the stuff my Grammy makes. It is a BIT thin, but not terribly so. Next time I make it, I'll probably substitute a half cup more half and half for a half cup of the reserved clam juice, and it will be perfecto. VERY thick clam chowder is a San Francisco tradition, NOT a Boston one. And it is made with clams, of course it should taste "fishy".

Rating: 4
I'm from the west coast, but I love clam chowder and have tried many. This is by far the *best* I have ever made or tried. Great consistency, not too watery, not too thick. Simple ingredients, great results every time I make it. I use turkey bacon and only about 2 teaspoons of butter and I use only 2 bottles of clam juice and make up the rest with water. My husband has proclaimed himself a "chowder hound" and requests this favorite often.

I am from Boston originally and I can tell you that the BEST chowder is at the SAIL LOFT, near the North End. It has won reviews for its chowder since I was a kid. It's amazing chowder - Legal Seafoods is also quite good.

I LOVE making this recipe! I was never a big chowder fan, but I thried this recipe for my husband. It is excellent and VERY easy. The only modification that I've made is that sometimes the clam juice smell is a bit overwhelming when you first start cooking it. (Not to mention that it's a bit costly here in Missouri...) So Most of the time I just use one or two bottles of the clam juice and make up the rest of the liquid with chicken stock. ENJOY, this is really worth making!!!!

This recipe was terrible. The chowder was thin and fishy tasting, and I followed the directions to the letter. I would never make this again, being a Massachusetts native, you can buy much better chowder prepared at a fish market.

I thought this recipe was excellent. I have been searching for a simple and tasty clam chowder recipe, and this was right on!

I used too hot a sauce and it overwhelmed the flavors. Be careful. I also added a seafood mix that I can get at Safeway that has mussels, scallops, squid and crab which I poaached with the potatoes in the clam juice. This added a little more flavor and texture. Well received by all!!

I doubled the recipe and brought it to my parents house. We let it simmer while we cleaned up and winterized the pool area...So, we enjoyed it all day. They loved it. Used a touch of cayene instead of tabasco sauce to bring it up a notch. And, added a little parsley (which it didn't need). This chowder is simple to make and tastes excellent.

Fantastic recipe! I made some modifications which worked well: I used twice the amount of flour for a thicker soup. To reduce the fat, I used fat-free half-and-half, which worked out great - it didn't decrease the depth of flavor or harm the consistency. Since I don't eat bacon, I used Morninstar's vegetarian bacon instead, which also worked well - it even fooled my husband. Really wonderful and very hearty soup!

Excellent! My brother-in-law lives in Boston and when I visit our quest is to find the best chowder (and beer)and this tops them all. There are two kinds of chowder "Thick or Thin".

2/5/02I'll rate after dinner tonight, but just wanted to clarify for the cook from Toronto. Each of my 6 1/2 oz cans is marked 184g. OK, we had it for dinner last night. It's really pretty good, although I'll cut back the pepper sauce just a touch next time. My husband and son liked it, and I thought it was good, but I prefer a thicker,creamier base. I'll probably play with the cream and flour quantities next time. Very easy, however, and a nice warm dinner. (And I did use all 6 cans of clams....)

A very good, very easy, not-too-rich clam chowder. However, where I shop, there is no such thing as a 6 1/2 oz. tin of clams. Rather, we have 142 gram tins.

Born and raised in Boston and although this chowder may be great, it is not actually true New England clam chowder. A real clam chowder purist wouldn't dream of putting celery,garlic,bayleaf or heaven forbid, canned clams in the chowder pot! We use fresh steamed chopped quahogs more often then steamed clams because they are tougher and hold up. We pick them off the beach in the spring. Quahogs must be cleaned very well due to sand. We don't use bacon or flour either. We do occasionally use rinsed salt pork instead of bacon

Very good but a little too much hot sauce for our taste. We also thought it needed more potato. I did not use chopped clams, instead used canned "steamer clams" and cut them to the size we wanted.

This may be New England clam chowder, but leave Rhode Island out of it. R. I. chowder is made with quahogs, no flour, just chopped quahogs and juice, onion, potato, salt and pepper and some water. You can add a little milk, if you like.

Very good recipe. I used 1/3 cup of flour and 4 cans of clams which was perfect. Better next day. Be sure to chop veggies in small pieces and saute until soft, especially if you want to serve it right away, since the chowder doesn't really boil after that and the veggies may still be hard.

This is as good as chowder could be made with canned clams. Is it just me or did canned clams used to have more flavor? I made two/thirds of the recipe and had four bowls full. I added a little extra flour based on the comments and it was almost too thick for our taste.

Not bad. However, we seem to be obsessed with "thick". Looking at the classical chowder recipes,from before you were born, there is NO flour or an attempt to make a roue. The liquid is heavy cream exclusively and any clam liquor that may be available.. My best rememberences of chowder are having a Martini at the bar at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston and following up with their exceptional chowder and a fume blanc. Always get the window seat so you can watch the people walking past the Public Garden

I've made this recipe twice - it quickly became my husband's favorite. I found that I had to leave out the hot pepper sauce because it was just too much for my 4 year-old. You can easily have the person add it to their own bowl. This recipe is tasty but watery - I will follow the suggestions of others and do 3/4 c. of flour.

I love this recipe. It does takes some time to prepare it (chopping, etc.) but I like that part, otherwise I'd just be opening up some cans of soup! I've made the recipe a couple of times, the first just to try it out and the second to start making it "mine". It was a hit the first time I made it, but it was thinner than what I was hoping for, even after increasing the flour a bit as suggested by other reviewers. I was really happy with the outcome the second time: I increased the potatoes by half (and added some of the reserved clam juice from the cans to the boiling process)and added a heaping 3/4 cup flour (to thicken it up). I'm not a big fan of cornstarch because it can become too starchy unexpectedly - and although I was a bit anxious about the starchy effects of too much flour, it wasn't a problem. Finally, something I've noticed beyond what was mentioned in other reviews - the pepper sauce really doesn't show up right away - don't add more until the soup's been finished for an hour at least! (I freely admit to being a Midwest wimp, I just thought I'd point it out.)

This clam chowder recipe has great flavor, however, it did not have the texture that I was looking for. It came out too thin.
