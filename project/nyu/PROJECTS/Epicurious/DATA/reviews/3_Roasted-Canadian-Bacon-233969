Toronto is correct - to a point. Peameal bacon is not cooked. Back bacon, however, is the same cut but smoked and cooked. What we call Back Bacon is what this recipe is calling for. Twenty minutes might be enough to heat it through as that is all this product needs. Check with a thermometer as it will be ready when fully heated through.

"Canadian bacon" is sold here in Canada as either 'back' or 'peameal' bacon. It is basically just a pork loin that has been cured, and usually rolled in cornmeal. It is, as others have observed, not a pre-cooked product. We normally use it sliced, 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick, pan-fried or grilled. To cook it as a larger chunk, you can treat it almost as you would a small ham of the same weight (so yes, 20 minutes wouldn't even come close, 20-25 minutes per pound would be about right). I'm afraid that I've never had "canadian" bacon in the U.S., so can't give any tips on that. As for this recipe, I won't rate it until I've had a chance to try it, but it sounds tasty.

I LOVE Canadian bacon. Especially in sandwiches. Uncooked, of course. I asked a dear Canadian friend about the bacon being raw. She laughed & said of course not! The Canadian bacon we get here in the states is different from that which they can get in Canada. Read the label--if it says to cook before using, do it. I can tell you that heating up the slices for more than a minute dries it up to leather. The 20 minutes in this recipe will simply heat a 2# roast through.

Canadian Bacon in the United States IS FULLY COOKED! I've not tried the recipe yet, but just wanted to correct the previous information.

Canadian Bacon is a raw meat that needs to be cooked. Won't do that in 20 minutes. Yes it can be roasted but for much longer than that. signed A Canadian.
