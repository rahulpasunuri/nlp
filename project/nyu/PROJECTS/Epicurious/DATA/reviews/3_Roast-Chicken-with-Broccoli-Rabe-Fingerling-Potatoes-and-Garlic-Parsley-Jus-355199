Very easy and very delicious. I stuffed 6 cloves of garlic into the chicken and let another 6 cloves roast in the pan along with the chicken broth and juices. I mashed them with the back of a spoon and whisked them right into the pan jus. The roasted garlic is mellow, savory, and really makes this dish. The roasted broccoli rabe was amazing and definitely a nice change from the same ol' saute. Just be careful with the chicken, after 55 minutes in the oven (after the initial 25 minutes) it still wasn't cooked all the way through. I had to rip the legs off and cook them for another 10-15 minutes.

This was a really good weeknight meal. When I make it again, I'll be sure to add less salt (when I salted the bird, the excess salt in the bottom of the pan made the jus too salty for my taste). But, the jus is delicious and I loved the greens with the potatoes. It was a hit with my husband too. To the reviewer who thought the veggies were soggy: on re-reading the recipe I noticed that the broth just goes in the pan with the chicken, and not in the pan with the veggies. So, maybe try again with that adjustment.

This is a terrific recipe for a fall or winter day. The chicken comes out crisp and moist; the broccoli rabe becomes deep and rich tasting; the sauce is great. No need to modify the recipe--

Sorry to say but this did nothing for any of the ingredients. The potatoes would have been better off roasting without any liquid added, and the broccoli rabe just ended up soggy. Cannot recommend this recipe.

Didn't think the chicken was that flavorful, and doesn't compare to My Favorite Simple Roast Chicken on this site. As for the vegetables, they were average.

Would double or triple the sauce, increased the garlic to 8 sm - med cloves, parsley to 1/2 cup flat leaf puree'd Chicken perfect, skin crisp Used reg broccoli sprinkled with herbs roasting time very short before tenting grated with parmesan Served in a bowl - vegtables chicken topped with sauce and used dark nutty bread to soak up the goodies!
