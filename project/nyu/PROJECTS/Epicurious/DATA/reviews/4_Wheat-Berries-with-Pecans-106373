Oops--forgot to mention what made it extra-special: served it with butternut squash, kale, and a sprinkling of parmesean cheese. So tasty!

I loved this recipe, and craved the dish after it was gone. So excited that our CSA gave out more wheat berries recently!

I was expecting more. I thought the dish lacked a punch of flavor. Maybe with some added herbs it could be better.

This is so simple and yet delicious. A great complement to a very seasoned main dish. The pecans definitely make the dish.

So good and so easy! I couldn't stay out of it! It was great hot and great at room temperature.

This is a simple yet winning combination- the wheat berries, onions, and pecans. Just as good leftover, as well.

Loved this recipe. Added dried cranberries after cooking and crumbled some feta cheese when serving. Really delicious! Toasted pecans add a very nice nutty flavor.

This recipe is soooo good! A great side dish to impress guests. I did throw in dried cranberries in the end as a few of you folks have suggested. Gave it just the right amount of sweetness. I can't stop eating it (chewing now as I type)! I was disappointed when I noticed the directions on the bag of wheat berries suggested cooking them from 2 - 5 hours (I didn't have that kind of time today & had my heart set on trying this recipe!). A little over an hour was perfect....so ignore what the package says if it differs! Now I will be trying to come up with the perfect vegetarian dinner to accompany this delicious side dish. Enjoy!!! =)

I had some leftover (cooked) hard wheat berries in my freezer, and this was a tasty use for them. (I cooked my wheat berries in a rice cooker--they came out perfect--and then had them in the freezer for about a month.) The pecans and onions complement the wheat berries really well.

Really enjoyed this dish and have made it numerous times for company and get raves.
