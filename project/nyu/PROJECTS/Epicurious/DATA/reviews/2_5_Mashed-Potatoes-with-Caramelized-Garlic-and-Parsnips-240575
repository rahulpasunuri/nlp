This is a great recipe, but do not prick the potatoes after you put foil on them. You might tear some foil, and end up with little bits of aluminum in your potatoes. As happened with me. The recipe itself is great - I used four big Yukon Gold potatoes, two big parsnips, one head of garlic, one cup of milk, and just a little butter. Came out fine, even without a ricer - I just peeled and mashed the potatoes. But I had a few pieces of foil from piercing after wrapping. So I suggest piercing the potatoes first, then just cut a few slits into the foil. Overall, this had a good roasted flavor, and was more interesting than many boiled and mashed potatoes I have served.

Meh. It was tasty, and wouldn't displease anyone at the table, but didn't "pop" as I imagined it would

This one is a keeper. Made this for Thanksgiving everyone loved it & there were no leftovers. My regular guests are insisting I make it for Christmas as well. They are full of lovely roasted garlic flavor with a hint of the slightly mineral sweetness of parsnip, easy preparation complex flavor. What more can you ask for!

This turned out very well for me. I used less potato than the recipe called for and one large parsnip and a turnip. Since I didn't have a ricer, I put everything into a food processor. I also used black pepper and threw in a little cinnamon at the end. Delightful.

I decided to try this recipe as part of my first self-made Thanksgiving meal.The roasted potatoes were very convenient, but the garlic emitted the strongest odor as they caramelized and the smell burned my nose with every breath. The parsnips were very unusual and the end result was a little soupy.
