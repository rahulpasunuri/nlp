Looking for a chuck roast stove top recipe as oven is out & found this wonder. Out of turmeric & used water instead of beef broth, otherwise by the book. Absolutely delicious!!! Pan roasted some carrots, onions & served with couscous. This will be made again.

The only problem with this recipe is that it requires the meat to be boiled, not braised. If you are using a non- tender cut of beef you will have to braise it by covering it. I placed the stew in a Dutch oven and placed it in a stove oven for an hour. Then took it out and completed cooking on the stove top until the sauce thickened. Done this way it is absolutely delicious! I wouldn't change a thing regarding the ingredients. Besides this stew not being braised as per the recipe, it is also not Morrocan. Muslims would never use alcohol to cook with.

This is the first time I've ever felt compelled to write a review. AMAZING!!! I did add a little more sherry, wine and beef broth, because I wanted extra liquid for the cous cous. Just unbelievable...can't say enough...except that next time I will double the recipe so we have leftovers. Oh, I did brown the meat very well...and I baked it at 350 degrees for about 2-1/2 hours to guarantee perfectly tender meat.

Followed recipe exactly. Turned out fantastic! Served with Israeli couscous and some roasted squash.

I followed the recipe (except used 2 lbs of organic chuck and reduced the raisins to 1.25 cups). After simmering uncovered for 75mins, I had to simmer it covered for another 30mins to tenderize the meat. Maybe it was a tough cut of beef. I served it with roasted beets and carrots with cumin vinaigrette, baby leaf lettuce, hummus, feta, and olive fougasse bread.

WOW!!! This is delicious! OK, don't yell at me :) I did make one little change... Instead of wine I used almost 2 cups of POM pure pomegranate juice ( I was just really in the mood for pomegranate). And the end result was phenomenal! I had to stop myself from eating it. I'm sure the wine version is tasty too- but the flavor with the pom juice was exceptional.

Yum, yum and yum. Left it in the crock pot all day while at work. The house smelled amazing when I got home and the taste did not disappoint. Leftovers froze beautifully - I thawed, chopped fine (raisins and all!) and used for samosa filling. Absolutely wonderful.

We LOVED this. I searched for a boneless chuck roast and this is the recipe I chose. The golden raisins looked and tasted like white beans. So interesting and delicious. I, too, cooked this covered the entire cook time. My husband and son are definitely foodies and they couldn't get enough! I found the garam masala at World Market. Truly, I can't wait to make this again!

I love this recipe, but I have a few additions to it. First, try adding peas toward the end of the cooking time. Even better, I like to add slivered almonds (NOT sliced almonds, which are too thin). The two ingredients add color and a nice crunch to the dish. Enjoy! Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Moroccan-Braised-Beef-230639#ixzz0xISIcSDg

this is so delicious. just came across the recipe again after making it a few years ago. this time i used half the amount of beef and after the meat had braised for 30 min, i added about 1 cup or so of cooked chickpeas. incredible!

I accidentaly bought a boneless chuck roast (thought it was sirloin) and searched for a recipe...came across this and said yum..we love strong flavors. This was very very good. The ONLY change I made was I used xtra sherry because I didn't have any red wine. It smelled delicious. I actually braised the beef and sauteed the onions and garlic then put everything else in the crock pot for a few hours. Delicious. Next time I'd add more cayenne, I love spicy. And yes, the raisins are a must! What a suprise that was!

This is a terrific recipe, I made it for a crowd and it was a hit! I also covered the first 45 min, but don't really know if it made a difference. I realized while making it that I was out of cayenne and used chipotle pepper instead, it was still great.

Fantastic recipe, yet followed someone elses advice and cooked covered for the first 45 minutes, which made the beef more tender. The raisins soak up flavor so try not to omit them, and don't be afraid of the cayenne pepper. (I'd add more..)

I love Moroccan food, but I found this lacked the subtlety of what I've eaten at restaurants (perhaps what I've eaten isn't authentic, but I've enjoyed it). This was too spicy for me, almost bitter. Despite other reviews raves about the raisins, I didn't like them in the dish, and I usually quite like raisins in my food. It did get better after I reheated the next day, but I'll stick with my curries (by the way, garam masala is an Indian spice blend).

Rating: 4
This is a wonderfully flavored dish! We made several Moroccan dishes one night and this was the winner by far. The only change we made was to add extra golden raisins which soaked up the flavor beautifully.

Rating: 4
Terrific recipe. I made this for a 50th birthday party, serving 50+ guests. There was nothing left and many requests for the recipe. Made it as written, but used Thompson, rather than Golden raisins and it made no difference. Cut back on the cayenne, to cater to a crowd of varied tastes, ages, etc, and it made no difference. This is a keeper.

However, I think it is pretty important to note that this is not a "moroccan" recipe -- there would not be wine or sherry in a recipe from North Africa, an islamic region.

I agree with others here - even though I'm not a big fan of raisins, they are essential for this recipe and become utterly amazing! This is by far among my currect top 5 favorite recipes. I've passed it on to friends and family liberally and receive rave reviews from them as well. I accidentally forgot to add the cayenne when I made it and I can't say I felt anything was missing. Will try it with cayenne next time but if you're not a fan, you can omit it and still have an amazing dish. This is perfect for guests - leaves an impresssion and is quite easy to put together.

I highly recommend this dish. This is probably my most favorite dish ever. A lot of people omitt the golden raisins but I believe this is a horrible mistake. The raisins fill up with the juices of all the ingrediants and just explode flavor.I am not a fan of raw raisins but in this dish they are essential! Also, instead of using chuck roast I use chuck steak. Since it cooks so long it becomes very tender and I just like the flavor that the chuck steak adds.

wonderful! my husband and I both like our food very spicy so I usually increase the spices whenever I try a recipe like this. I made it exactly as written the first time, however, and probably would again - the balance of sweet and hot is just perfect. had to cover and cook it for about half an hour longer to get the beef tender but that may have been my fault for not browning it properly I guess. can't wait to make it again!

This was very tasty - easy to make, great flavors, wonderful served over couscous. I would allow extra cooking time to really get the meat nice and tender.

Count me among the fans of this recipe. I substituted 5 lbs of cut up pork shoulder, increased the onions and raisins by about 50%, and left the rest of the ingredients as is. I browned the onions with care -- caramelized onions and raisins balance the heat nicely. I didn't bother to brown the pork. I also cooked it at a very low temperature for more like 3 hours with the lid just ajar. If I do say so myself, it was terrific. If I were doing it all over again, I'd probably cut back the cayenne a bit and serve it over polenta or cous cous. But seriously, this is easy and delicious. It would make great party food, because it's not just good, the total labor required for the last few hours is stirring every half hour or so. Plenty of time to do other party prep and get beautiful.

Well, don't make it if you don't like meat or don't have the ingredients (I just don't get some people!). Otherwise, it is a great recipe. Very pleasant, rich, and easy to make. I even like the raisins, which are not my favorite addition to savory dishes.

I used 1lb of braising beef and it's enough not sure why the recipe asks for so much more. I don't eat a lot of meat so I guess you could put whatever but I'd think that you'd need a pretty big pot to cook all that. Anyway, I followed the recipe apart from the canned tomatoes. I had some left-over tomato (celery & carrot) pasta sauce from last nite so I put that in. I usually like raisins but I think there might be too many for my liking. I'm impressed at how "quick" this was for a school day dinner but I had to use up the beef... I'll see how it'll serve up tomorrow but it's OK. I might make it again although I'd like to try other recipes. I'm not big on meat...

Rating: 4
Excellent flavors and quite easy to make. I'm a personal chef and would serve this to clients without reservation. I strongly recommend cooking the dish covered for the first 30 to 45 minutes though. Then cook uncovered to finish and thicken the sauce. If cooked uncovered the whole time, too much sauce evaporates before the meat becomes tender. Also, cooking uncovered increased my cooking time by 30 minutes over what the recipe indicates to get that tenderness that braising is all about. Highly recommended dish!

This was fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly (except I used lower sodium beef broth) and served it over couscous. I'm not a raisin fan at all, but they absolutely made this dish. I may try adding slivered almonds towards the end of cooking, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing!

Read all the reviews, took the following suggestions. Made this two days ahead. Cooked it for two hours covering the pan part-way through the time. Subbed a mixture of 1/3 golden raisins, 1/3 chopped dried apricots and 1/3 slivered almonds for the listed raisins. We enjoyed it with couscous and a veggie.

Rating: 3
This was absolutely delicious. The combination of the spices along with the sweet from the raisins was mouth watering. Even a raisin hater enjoyed the dish! Used a bottom round roast that was in the freezer, but I did have to cook it close to 2 hours. Next time I would use a chuck as the bottom round was too lean. Didn't realize that we were out of sherry so I subbed red wine. Like most braised meats this was even better the next morning. In the future I'll make this the day before I want to serve it. Served it with the quinoa from QUINOA WITH MOROCCAN WINTER SQUASH AND CARROT STEW.

This has become one of my boyfriend's favorites, and it reminds us of great dinners at one of our favorite SLC restaurants. Give yourself a little extra time to make the beef perfectly tender. I usually serve with plain couscous and a good Zin.

I thought this was a great dish packed with flavor. I added two carrots for additional veggies, omitted the sherry and increased the red wine to 1 1/2 cups total. Instead of 1 1/2 cups of raisins, I did 1/3 cup raisins and 1/3 cup of diced dried apricots. It was perfect!

I've made this recipe several times now, multiple times for potlucks, and it always turns out well and gets a great response. My one adjustment is that I leave out the raisins. A local restaurant serves a version WITH the raisins that I've tried, and enjoy, but I do like it better without.

the cook from richmond, VA asked for a garam masala receipe. i have one but never tried it, hope it works for you. 1 tbsp cumin seeds, 1 tbsp coriander seeds, 2 tsp black peppercorns, 12 cardamom pods, 8 whole cloves, 1 (2 inch) cinnamon stick broken into pieces, 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg Place the first 6 ingredients in a large skillet over med-high; cook until spices smoke, becoming fragrant and turning dark, shaking pan constantly (about 5 min). Stir in nutmeg. Remove from heat; cool completely. Place spice mixture in a spice or coffee grinder; process until finely ground. Store in airtight container. Yield 1/4 cup.

I wanted to try this recipe before I decided what to take to a cover dish this weekend. I only made half the recipe and it is without a doubt a keeper for us. I used my pressure cooker and cooked it 1/2 hour. It was perfect. The meat was tender and I will try other meats. I am certain it will be just as good.

The flavors in this dish are delicious, but next time I'll use lamb instead of beef: its texture when braised as well as its flavor will go better with this, I think. A note on wine pairing with this dish: although it isn't spicy to the point of being hot, pair this with whatever wine you usually pair with hearty and spicy dishes. A Zinfandel might go well, but I think a Cote-Rotie would be great: it can stand up to spicy food, and it has the structure and earthiness to go with this dish that Zin just doesn't have. If Cote-Rotie is too expensive, pick another Syrah-based wine, but make sure its of the earthy variety, not the ueber-jammy Australian style.

This dish was amazing. I cut back a tiny bit on the cayenne...because of the wife..but the dish was explosive with flavor. Definitely will make this one again. I used basmati rice, mixed in some juice from 1/2 an orange instead of the couscous, and the aroma was spectacular. I paired a nice rose champagne instead of a red wine to balance the spice from the dish.

My husband hasn't stopped talking about this. I made it a couple of nights ago to rave reviews. I used Penzey's spices, which seems to make everything taste nice. My only suggestion is to use a different type of meat- while it came out very tender, the meat had quite a bit of gristle in it that was hard to remove before cooking. Next time, I'll probably use a different cut of stew beef.

This is the first time my family has enjoyed any stew-like concotion. All three children asked me to make this again, which I will definitely do. And my husband even asked for seconds (and thirds). I did make a few changes...used half beef chuck and half lamb stew. Used dry white (because it was open in the frig) instead of dry red wine. Used vegie broth instead of beef stock, and dried cherries and cranberries instead of raisins, and did not find it too sweet. Served it on top of couscous, which was a very nice combination.

Served on a huge platter over a bed of almond couscous and with a side of Moroccan carrots and pitchers of homemade sangria made for an amazing informal dinner among friends.

Tried this tonight to use up a chuck roast I had in the freezer. Very satisfying, with just enough spice to be different. I had to tweak it just a bit to accomodate my pantry (dried cherries instead of raisins and dry vermouth instead of sherry), but we enjoyed it anyway. I'll make it again with these mods, or as the recipe is written, depending on what I have on hand. Served with whole wheat couscous and honey-ginger carrots.

This was fabulous, made just as written. Amazingly, the fact that it may not be 100% authentically Moroccan didn't lessen our enjoyment at all! The one comment I would make is that I found it took significantly longer than 1 hr. 15 mins. for the meat to be tender. I ended up partially covering it and I think that helped; I may do that for the whole cooking time next time. P.s. does anyone know why this doesn't pop up when you search under the title?

This dish sounds delicious. However, calling this recipe "Moroccan" is misleading, no? Red wine, sherry and garam masala are not Moroccan flavors. Just because you throw in some spices, raisins and then dump the beef over some couscous, it doesn't make it Moroccan.

This was very close to a 4-forker. I've made this dish twice, and my spice concerned husband loved it, as did the entire family. Used nearly twice as much beef, and did serve it with a fresh herbed couscous the first time, and buttered, herbed, egg noodles the second. The second time I also added cubes of butternut squash. Everyone agreed it was delicious, and from such a multi-palated crowd, I was pleased indeed. As with most stews, it was even more delicious the second day.

I was expecting something different from this recipe. I followed the recipe with the exception of using Ras el Hanout [Moroccan couscous spice] in place of the garam masala (could have sworn I had some on hand!). I also added drained canned chickpeas toward the end. My complaints: I've never been wild about chuck roast, but thought this treatment might yield better results; and I would decrease the amount of raisins and add them closer to serving, since I felt that it made the whole sauce too sweet. Some slivered almonds might be a nice touch.

I made this recipe for friends on Friday, and we consumed nearly 5 pounds of beef between three of us. It was divine.

The flavors are interesting and the cayenne gives it a pretty good kick. I don't like raisens so I left them out. First, if you cook the meat uncovered long enough to make the meat tender, all of the "gravy" will evaporate. I put a cover on it after about 45 mins and maybe will do that sooner next time. I cooked it at least 2 hours and it was better the second day. I would recommend using a really good cut of meat and not just stew meat.
