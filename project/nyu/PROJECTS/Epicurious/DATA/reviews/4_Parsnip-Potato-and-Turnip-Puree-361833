Cooked this with a roast duck since I was not planning to make a gravy - everyone really enjoyed it as a change from standard mash. Appreciated the "make-ahead-ability" of the dish too so I wasn't juggling oven space with the main dish!

Great way to use up a cupboard full of root veggies! After tasting the puree (before topping and baking) I felt it needed a bit more creaminess so I added ~ 1/3 cup of sour cream and thought it was much better.
