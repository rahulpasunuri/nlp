"Dough will be stiff...will be hard to slice and may crumble." Way to sell your recipe! I won't be making these!

I could have killed my whole family with this log it was so heavy and hard. After refrigerating for 4 hours I tried to slice it and it totally crumbled. I tried making balls a couple days later and it was no easier. My husband ate the cookies which must have weighed 1/4lb each. Would not make these again.

BEWARE. The dough splintered when sliced and the cookies were not particularly tasty. WIth so much chocolate, there was a very narrow window between underdone and scorched. I'm an experienced baker, I used high-quality ingredients, and I followed the recipe to the letter.

I would definitely make these again. I was looking for a recipe to approximate a high-end gourmet chocolate shortbread/sugar cookie I've purchased in the supermarket. After reading the other reviews about the difficulty in mixing and forming this dough I tried a different method. You should ignore the instruction to "mixing in cocoa, baking soda, and melted chocolate AFTER adding flour (dough will be stiff)." Instead, try mixing the cocoa in with the dry ingredients of the butter cookie recipe, and mix the melted chocolate in with the wet ingredients, before adding the dry ingredients. This worked quite well for me. I agree w/other reviewers who said forming the cookies into balls with room temp. dough was easier, however, I was able to do the chill and slice method. It's a little tricky but the results were a thinner, more tender/delicate cookie. I rolled the balls in sugar and flattened them with the bottom of a glass; I sprinkled the sliced/chilled cookies with sugar before baking. Recipe works quite well with "white" whole wheat flour. I also baked these for a little less time, though that could be my oven. The results were delicious; even my husband who doesn't generally like sweets loved these.

This recipe is a huge pain in the neck. I'm glad the instructions described the difficulty with it--the dough is super hard and crumbles very easily. I had to re-form half the cookies before baking--luckily they came together, but each of the ones that had broken showed fault lines in the final product. I actually thought this whole article in Gourmet was a bust--conceptually interesting but executionally poorly done.

Outstanding Cookies. Divine taste, and texture. You may roll them in any kind of nut, sugar or candy. I made them two years ago, and my Family now askes for them every year!

These are extremely time-consuming, require expensive ingredients, and do not taste very good. I also do not suggest the slicing method, as the dough will become extremely hard and almost impossible to slice (rather like cutting chocolate blocks - kept flaking into pieces). Will never make these again.

I got rave reviews when I took these to my work. They are a great chocolate cookie

Received a gift of the basic butter cookies and these DIVINE super-chocolately cookies and asked for the recipe immediately. I made the chocolate cookies and rolled them in toasted walnuts, crushed candy cane and even made a light sugar glaze to dress a few up. If you like intense chocolate cookies, this is the recipe for you. Delicious!

I made this along with several other variations of the basic butter cookie recipe, and I have to say it was the worst. It had an ok flavor, but was very lackluster and unholidayish. Also, when rolled into a log and cut, the cookie are just flat and ugly. If you must make this cookies, I recommend the ball method, they look much more palatable that way. This cookies are not worth wasting quality ingredients on.

These cookies are wonderful with just a few minor amendments... I used Rapunzel organic cocoa powder and Scharffen Berger 62% cacao semisweet baking chocolate. Rather than refigerate the dough and slice cookies, I instead portioned the dough out in heaping teaspoonfuls and rolled each one into a ball. I coated each ball in chopped almonds, placed them on cookie sheets and then flattened each into a 2" disk with the flat bottom of a drinking glass. They look great, no dough was lost to crumbling, and most importantly, they taste terrific! Try the different method and you will change your opinion about these cookies.

After making the butter recipe which was some what easy, I added the chocolate ingrediants which made this dough impossible to work with. The cookies came out tasting burnt even though they weren't and the dough just crumbled and was completely unmanageable.

The cookie is ok, but a PAIN to make. Much easier recipes out there, like Black Gold, a very yummy cookie.

Complete waste of time. The dough crumbles and the cookies do not taste good. Yuck.

I served these at a holiday party and they were the crowd favorite. I used Valrhona cocoa powder (not Dutch process), and, reading some of the other reviews, I think that may have made a big difference. I am making them again for the family now.

I would have liked to give these a four, but just can't. From a flavour perspective, they're excellent; a rich, bittersweet chocolate set off by the salt from the pistachios. From a yield perspective, though, this recipe is not successful as I lost a great deal of dough to crumbling. I found thicker slices worked better, and so only produced 30 (whole) cookies.

These were the worst cookies I ever made until I added another 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/2 stick butter and another egg. Then they were very good. Are you sure someone tested those cookies? They were bitter bitter bitter.

Delicious! Will definitely make again. The key to this recipe is to let the dough warm slightly prior to cutting it (tp orevent crumbling) and to allow the cookies to cool for 5 minutes on the sheet before transferring to the rack (to prevent breaking). They harden up quite nicely after that. I did not use the nuts, and sprinkled a bit of glitter on the top for Christmas flair. Yum!

Ick! What a mess. These completely fell apart. What a waste. Do yourself a favor and find a better recipe. This is NOT a keeper.

Roll the edges of the unbaked cookies first in egg white so that the pistachios stick better. Slightly underbake the cookies then let them sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes before cooling on a wire rack.
