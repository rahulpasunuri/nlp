A great recipe for chutney - very easy to prepare and a wonderful balance of sweet, spicy and tangy ingredients. I substituted wasabi powder for the mustard and Japanese 7 spice for the red pepper flakes. You can use it anywhere - with olive oil as a salad dressing, as a dip for a cheese platter, instead of tabasco, with meat (of course)... Did I mention how easy it was to make?

I followed the instructions exactly, except that I used fresh ginger in a tube (from the produce section) instead of peeling and mincing it myself. It was terrific! I was skeptical as to whether my Thanksgiving guests would want to try it, since there was cranberry sauce on the table; but everyone raved. I made it three days ahead, which allowed the flavors to blend and mellow.

Have made this recipe several times and it always turns out great. Goes well with roast pork and roast turkey at Thanksgiving. Most recently made for our daughters wedding as an hors d'oeuvre with brie cheese. Was a hit, and I have received many requests for the recipe.

Used a combination of apples and pears, and added the mustard seed as another reviewer suggested. Served it with grilled pork tenderloin. It was good, but not great. Nothing wrong with the recipe, just didn't do it for my tastebuds - sweet/sharp taste was a bit overwhelming.

I made this chutney to go with slow- cooked pork shoulder. Everyone loved it. Only changes I made was that I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, and used red onion.

Fabulous chutney! I reduced the vinegar to 3/4 cup and added a tablespoon of toasted mustard seeds. Yummy.

Just what I like a chutney to be, zingy, fruity and delicious. I used my immersion hand blender just at the end of the cooking time to make the mixture less chunky, as Granny Smiths tend to keep their shape forever. Wonderful!

An excellent chutney I have made it with half apple/half pear combination which was even better

I made this several times - always to rave reviews, but lost the recipe in a move. Glad to get it back - a big hit with people who like complex tastes (i.e. a little sweet and sour action enhanched by the red pepper).

This is delicious. I used crystallized ginger instead. So good. I canned about 20 jars of this.

Excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent. Particularly great with meats or cheese [yummmmm] -- or for that matter, right out of the jar!!!
