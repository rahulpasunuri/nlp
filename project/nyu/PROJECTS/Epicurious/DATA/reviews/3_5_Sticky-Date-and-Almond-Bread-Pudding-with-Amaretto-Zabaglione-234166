This recipe obviouslt has some errors according to the reviews, specifically the amoubt of custard called for. I will either increase my ingredients for tyhe custard or cut back on the bread but I think it is an excellent base recipe that I can't wait to try. If ytur zabaglione is coming out lumpy, it is probably becuase you are overcooking the egg. It needs to be cooked gently, till just done, and whisked constantly to prevents any lumps from forming.

Very good and easy to make. It was not as gooey as I thought it should be, but it was not dry. I think there was too much bread for the amount of custard because when you're supposed to push down the bread and spoon the custard over it 25 minutes into baking there was hardly any liquid there. The sauce was very good but too thick to drizzle it was more like a soft pudding. I used the thermometer as instructed but don't know if I over cooked it or what. To adjust the consistency I thinned it down with more heavy cream and amaretto and it was fine. I would definitely male this again.

I love to try new recipes on my friends. My husband was not trilled with the idea of dates. Mixed the ingrediates ahead of time and baked right before dinner. Everyone raved on how good it was. Some even said my best ever.

I have made a zillion bread puddings and was looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it just didn't work out as I had hoped. I did not want to fiddle with the bread pudding in the oven, so I refrigerated it overnight. Because the custard is so fluffy, I didn't realize that there was an insufficient amount for the amount of bread called for in the recipe. Consequently, the pudding was drier than I like--the dates were dry and crunchy too--all in all, just a recipe that does not work IMO. (For the poster below, strain your sauce next time to get rid of the lumps.)

This recipe had a strong flavor, which is a nice change from dull bread puddings. However, I have to say that since the flavor was so intense, it did not fit our idea of a comfort dessert. I also had trouble with the amaretto zabaglione. The mixture isn't supposed to be lumpy, is it? Maybe I had the heat up too high, but it was not a smooth sauce for me.

My husband loved this recipe. Bread pudding is his absolute favorite dessert. I did not have dates on hand, but I had dried figs and it was a good substitute. It was also pretty easy to make.

The almonds are a wonderful addition to this bread pudding recipe. Next time I'll use fewer dates, but overall this was a big hit, especially with the amaretto zabaglione drizzled over the top.
