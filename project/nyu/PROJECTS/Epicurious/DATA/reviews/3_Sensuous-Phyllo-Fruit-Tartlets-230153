Easy and Tasty are perfect words to describe this recipe. I also used plain greek yogurt and sweetened with honey. I couldn't find my muffin tin so I just cut the stacked phyllo into squares and baked them then put the yogurt mixture and fruit on top then drizzled with more honey.

Excellent and so easy. One piece of advice - fill cups and serve; don't let this dessert sit or you lose the crispiness of the crust.

Quick and easy - if you are used to phyllo and have it on hand. These tarts look pretty and the combination of textures is great. I used Greek yoghurt and sweetened it with honey.
