This recipe was quick and tasty. I followed the recipe except I used only half of the bacon and removed it after it was browned, then returned it back into the soup when it was finished. Very Nice!

This is a great clam chowder - very easy, light, and perfect for either lunch or dinner. I left out the half and half (for lower fat) and it was still terrific.

This was OK. Not the best chowder I've had. It was too runny and I should've removed the bacon after it cooked down (since bacon's not usually left in clam chowder). The flavor was really good though. With a little tweaking, this could be a fantastic chowder.

I love recipes like this one that you can cobble up from pantry ingredients. This one makes an exceptionally good chowder. My addition was about a tablespoon of Crystal Hot Sauce added near the end of cooking, but before adding the cream. I also thickened with 3T cornstarch like other reviewers suggested and was happy with the texture.

This was very good. I used several cloves of fresh garlic sauted with the onions. We had some minced fresh (frozen) clams my hubby had dug up, but it wasn't enough so I added one can of clams with juice. The canned clams were tough so I won't use them again. I also used half cup heavy cream and half c. half n half adding a little more toward the end. Only problem - too salty (I added no salt). Next time I'll try a different brand of clam juice and/or low salt bacon. Another tip, I cooked the bacon on LOW heat, stirring occasionally while chopping other veggies. This was incredibly easy and I recommend it.

This was easy and tasty. I spent a bit of time at the cutting board, but at least the recipe was not difficult. You would never guess how easy it is by tasting it. It tastes so fresh and homemade, I will never go back to canned soup. I would suggest adding one more bottle of clam juice, some more garlic powder, and LOTS of freshly cracked pepper. I used heavy cream instead of half and half and I added 3T of corn starch. It was perfect, but I had to add more water before putting in the freezer due to all the potatoes.

Yummy! Great recipe! This is my new clam chowder recipe from now on. I didn't have bacon so I just sauted the vegetables in a little butter. And because my boyfriend is so used to yucky canned chowders I used cornstarch to thicken the soup a little but personally I like it without the thickening agent. Oh by the way .. he didn't know it was homemade!

I made this for my boyfriend last night and he loved it. His Dad drowned his superbowl sorrows with 2 bowls of it. I used my mini-prep to chop the veggies really fine & served it with french bread toasted with butter and melted cheese, and a salad. WIll definately make it again.

3 T. of corn starch is a must. I thought it was a bit bland, so I added Tabasco and lots of cracked pepper.

An easy and quite tasty recipe. I made this for a soup dinner at my church & it was a huge success. I like my soup a little thicker so I added 3 tbs of corn starch at the end. I also added 1/2 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning for an extra kick but it tasted delicious without it.

I am a firefighter in Washington D.C. and made this for lunch at my firehouse. There is a phrase used in the staion "you laid out short" which means you didn't make enough. My Lieutenant said that phrase and I said how I 2X the recipe, he said he couldn't have his fourth bowl. PS there were NO leftovers.

This clam chowder was really good because it was full of flavor but not too heavy. The soup was not as creamy as a store bought variety is but I thought that was what made it good. If you add more seasoning then it asks for it will add a lot more flavor.
