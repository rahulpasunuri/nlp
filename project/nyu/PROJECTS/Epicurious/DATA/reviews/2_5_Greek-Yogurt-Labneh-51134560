The marinade will congeal in a 38 degree refrigerator.

All of the ingredients were at hand, the recipe was easy to assemble, and instructions were followed precisely including the 8 oz jar.. What a surprise to see after eight hours in a 38 degree refrigerator that the marinade had congealed. Also, for future reference, the 2 cups 2% Fage Greek yogurt could easily fill a 12 oz container.

I know this is against the rules, but what could be bad about this. I will be preparing this (have all the ingredients) so that it will be ready for my leftover lunch and and "morning after" breakfast. Don't kill me, but anyone who has been cooking for years knows that this is a great recipe! Yes, I will make this often.
