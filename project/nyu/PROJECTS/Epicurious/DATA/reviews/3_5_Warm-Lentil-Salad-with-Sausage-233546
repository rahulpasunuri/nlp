This looked so good in the picture but when I actually tasted it...wowee! I made as directed. Froze leftovers and they are still delish.

This is fine...nothing to write home about. I won't need to make this again.

I ordered some expensive lentils grown in Le Puy,France. This is the recipe I choose to make with them, boy was I disappointed! This dish had very little flavor to me unless the bite you were taking had a piece of sausage in it.

Made this with chorizo - excellent quick dinner for a week night. Great flavors

I cleaned the fridge out with this recipe and it came out GREAT! I used turkey sausage (not low fat) and added some swiss chard. I'm making it again today.

This was a fantastic and easy recipe, it's great alone or add a salad for a more complete meal. The lentils and dressing alone are very tasty (the dressing does a lot of this dish) but with the kielbasa, hands down my favorite sausage, this becomes even more flavorful and enjoyable. The recipe makes quite a large portion so I had this for many meals and it was just as good every time, the flavors only get better over a few days and the dish is great warmed back up or cold!

Excellent! I only had jalapeno cheddar venison sausage, so I added green peppers, diced jalapenos, cilantro instead of parsley. I also only had white wine vinegar. It is hard to mess this recipe up and you can clean the fridge out.

I am truly impressed w/ this super simple and satisfying dish. It definitely hit to spot for my finicky pregnant taste buds. I think it will definitely become one of my regulars. The only changes I made were using whole grain mustard in the dressing and increasing the vegetables (including adding diced red peppers), to make it heartier.

I make several variations of this regularly, always with rave reviews. I leave the mustard out entirely and usually use a blend of sherry, red wine and balsamic vinegars for kick. I also substitute fennel for celery and use pardina lentils instead of French lentils - they just seem to cook up better. This is a great recipe upon which to base variations!

Wonderful recipe! The vinaigrette truly makes the dish. I had just 1.5C of lentils and that was plenty. This will quickly become a favorite.

The lentil ratio was way too high. If I made it again, I'd halve the lentils.

This was an inexpensive, quick, and delicious weeknight dinner. I used the ribs of Swiss chard instead of celery and tossed in the chopped Swiss Chard leaves towards the end. Fantastic!

Excellent, easy recipe. I actually used the prepared lentils at Trader Joe's and they were very easy. Doubled the carrots. My wife thought the vinaigrette made the dish; I felt it was a great balance of flavors and a nice, hearty meal. Will definitely make again.

I have made this recipe countless times and we love it. I substitute some smoked tofu for the kielbasa and it is fabulous and lower in fat fa

Solid meal. Next time I would up the veggie ratio. Lazyman's version: put veggies in food processor, brown the sausages whole and serve next to lentils, and put vinegarette on the side with a spoon. I liked slicing the sausage on my plate and spooning the sauce onto the sausage anyway.

Delicious and easy. The mustard vinaigrette adds so much to this dish. Green lentils were unavailable; regular lentils worked fine for us. It is important not to overcook them. Especially good with cheddar toasts (recipe on this site).

Loved this ! I could close my eyes & imagine being in a Paris bistro. OK - I opened my eyes & served this to a crew for Super Bowl sunday & they loved it. The du Puy lentils are key to the recipe - they were superb in this dish.

I've prepared this recipe for many years, and it is always successful - even my husband who detests legumes really likes the lentilles de Puy. It is easy, very flavourful, and feels wonderfully authentically French on a cold winter evening with baguette and green salad, followed by tarte aux pommes.

We loved this dish! It was so easy to prepare and such a healthy complete dinner without sacrificing taste (we loved the crunch of the parsley and the subtle vinaigrette). It is definitely important to use good lentils (I used a special Italian variety that weren't at all mushy, otherwise I would have used de Puy) and good sausage as well. I didn't use kielbasa, just a country sausage from my butcher, and it was a very mild flavor (although they couldn't be cut in pretty slices like in the magazine photo, more like chunks! I'll have to figure out a prettier sausage to use for company). The best thing about this delicious dish? On the table in under an hour and a half!

I could close my eyes and think I was in a Parisian bistro! Lentil salads are something I always order there. And this is a good one! As another reviewer said, do use lentils du Puy any other kind will be mushy. I used a bit of the vinagrette to dress the salad greens.

Perhaps my tastebuds are easily satisfied by humble foods for I found this down-to-earth dish to be wholesome and quite tasty. I didn't use packaged smoked kielbasa, opting for a fresh hot Italian sausage from Whole Foods meat department, which was good, though my boyfriend felt this choice was too spicy/overwhelming and said he'd have preferred the kielbasa. As for the lentils being mushy (to the cook from Santa Barbara): do make certain you use Du Puy lentils (French green). These are always my choice for lentil dishes mainly because they don't get mushy. Comparing this version to the original recipe published in 1991, the addition of Dijon mustard is a wise one - gives it a nice kick. Also suggest additional garlic. Very quick and easy. I also suggest trying this type of lentil cooked with onion, celery, carrot, garlic, then add a little chopped canned tomato with juice and parsley. I steam fresh chopped arugula on top and use it as a topping for polenta. Delicious!

My lentils came out mushy- Over-cooked? The sausage was tasty. Not enough flavor in the lentil mixture. This cannot possibly rate as the best recipe of 1991.

This is a very tasty dish, especially good for a winter meal. Next time I might cut back the lentils to 1 1/2 cups, so that the ratio of vegetables to lentils is a little more balanced. The vinaigrette is a good complement to the lentils and kielbasa (I did use low fat!) We will make this again.
