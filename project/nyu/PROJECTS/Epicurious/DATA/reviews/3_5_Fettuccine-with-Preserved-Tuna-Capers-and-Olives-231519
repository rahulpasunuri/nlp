This is a great recipie. I used one small minced garlic per person, added a good pinch of crumbled dried rosemary and used 3 fresh tomatoes to make the sauce, along with the other ingredients. Once it was off the stove I added 2 Tb of dried oregano, which was very welcomed. I'll try it without the tuna as I too suspect it's overshadowed by the anchovies and is not really needed. A keeper!

This was delicious and easy. Next time, though, I might leave out the tuna. I thought that the parts with just the anchovies and olives were delicious. If I have fresh rosemary lying around the next time I make this, I'll certainly add it because I think that it would work very well.

I was kind of worried with the bold flavored ingredients (all in the pantry), but I actually spoke out loud (by myself) when I tasted it: "WOW" . Flavors are very well balanced. Forgot to save the pasta water, but the wine I served (Rose of Sangiovesse) worked just as well.

This is one of those great recipes that is quick and all the ingredients can be on hand. It's not over-the-top outrageous, just a very solid and tasty recipe. I used an expensive, jarred, imported tuna and I think the cost was worth it. This will become a staple, last-minute recipe.

Delicious sauce! My husband deemed it 'restaurant quality.' I added about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper for a little kick and used clams instead of tuna. Served with fettucine rigate for a wonderful Lenten Friday meal. Will definitely make this again and again.

Very nice bold flavors. I used about half the Tuna the recipe called for and added some crushed red pepper flakes for a little zip.
