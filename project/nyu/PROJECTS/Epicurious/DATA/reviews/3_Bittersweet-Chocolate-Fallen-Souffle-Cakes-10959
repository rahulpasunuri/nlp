The alcohol was a bit overpowering and ours didn't fall, oops. We used a 62% cacao content chocolate, so there was a lot of chocolate deliciousness. I couldn't finish mine and found that I liked it better cold the next day.

I thought this was delicious- but I agree with adding more chocolate. I doubled the recipe and made it for my three friends, and they all wanted the recipe.

Yes, they were easy but I didn't think there was enough chocolate taste.Maybe the espresso should be left out. Also,17 minutes it too long. They rose, but were too done inside, and stuck to the dishes. Shouldn't they have fallen because they were underdone? Maybe I'll try again, and cook less.

This was very light - perfect after a big meal. It was also easy and quick, and the presentation was nice too. I garnished with some Raspberries and a mint leaf in addition to the whipped cream and chocolate. When I make it again I will add more chocolate to both the Souffle and the sauce.
