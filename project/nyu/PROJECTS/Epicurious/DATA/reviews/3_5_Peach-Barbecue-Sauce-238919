I love this BBQ sauce! Based on another peach bbq sauce recipe from this site I puree the sauce with 2 strips of thick cut bacon and saute the onions in the drippings instead of canola oil. I think it adds a really nice smoky flavor that goes well with the peach and bourbon. I also use more jalepeno and add a bit of fresh sage at the end.

Also, we used more jalapeno than the recipe called for per other reviews.

I hate to be the person who rates this recipe even though I changed the main ingredients but the amazing thing about this recipe is it works with any fruit! We used some blackberries we picked from our garden and threw in a mango and a little OJ to cut the tartness. It was incredible on grilled pork and had a wonderful purple color that made me want to put it on everything. I'm sure the peach is just as good, but i encourage everyone to just try whatever fruit is in season, it'll probably be delicious! Will definitely make this again. It was the perfect amount of sweet and spicy.

Used whole jalapeno without seeds but this sauce will be frozen for fall and winter bbq's

I added a lot of chopped hot peppers to this and doubled the vinegar. As it was, I felt like it was too sweet. Still, its flavor went much better with pork ribs than on its own. I was pleasantly surprised at how much it improved once it was actually on the ribs.

Made this for pork ribs...different but good. I imagine on a pork tenderloin it would be amazing and I would probably be rating it with 4 forks instead. If you find the sauce two sweet try adding a bit of ketchup to balance it out. Also, the amount of jalapeno called for is not enough and next time I will double it. Any trace amount of heat you pick up in the sauce totally gets lost once you put it on the meat.

Yum!! This was fabulous. The only changes I made were to use whiskey instead of bourbon, and rapadura (dark brown sugar) instead of light brown. This was excellent. Kind of like a peachy honey-mustard sauce. We ate it on pork ribs, which we thought were amazing. Then I thinned some of it out with oil and used it as a salad dressing, topped with crumbled blue cheese... I actually got my husband to willingly eat salad! I will say to be careful to use the correct amount of peaches. One pound is not a lot... about 3 good sized fruit. I weighed mine after I peeled and pitted them to be sure I had the right amount. Definitely use good quality stone fruit though, as the entire dish is resting on the flavor of the fruit. We will definitely be adding this to the summer repertoire.

I had the left over peaches and used this over roasted chicken. Made a very plesant change from the usual red sauce.

better to just buy a good bbq sauce and simmer it with pureed or diced ripe peaches. That is the recipe I found in a southern cookbook that goes very well with BBQ'd pork tenderloin
