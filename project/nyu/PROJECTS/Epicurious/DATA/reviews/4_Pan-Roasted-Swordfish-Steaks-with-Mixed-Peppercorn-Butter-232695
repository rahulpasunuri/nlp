Huge props to the piece of fish, but this recipe was a huge hit with just a bit of adjustment. More of everything in the sauce to less fish ratio and only black peppercorns in place of the melange. Make the sauce on the side so you can spoon a bit over it and cover thinly while in the oven. Remove from oven and bury in the warm sauce so it just firms nicely. I would also reduce the cook time from 10 to 8 minutes in the oven. Turned out unbelievable.

Easy, but it needed some pizzazz. I doubled the pepper, and added a few capers. I used the white wine to deglaze, but also added some soy sauce to the rice medley I used as a side. Still found it delicious, but not great Directions were easy to follow and very helpful.

I was searching for a yummy looking swordfish recipe that was cooked on the stove top or oven. Most seem to be for the bbq grill.This recipe uses both stove top and oven. It was easy and very delicious. Whole family loved it!I made a couple of minor changes. First, instead of sprinkling the fish with salt and pepper, I squeezed some lemon juice over it. Then I gently pressed the fish onto a plate of McCormick Crusting Blends,(Garlic, Lemon & Rosemary flavor).It also has some Panko in it. This gave it a tasty crust when cooking in the skillet.For the seasoned butter,I had no parsley so used 1 teaspoon of dried basil instead, and two large cloves of garlic. I used regular fresh ground pepper and more than 1/2 tsp. lemon peel because I didn't measure. Just grated it in, as I really like the flavor.Before adding the seasoned butter, I deglazed pan with a little white wine and chicken broth, as advised by other reviewers. All I can say is it came out marvelous!

I like this recipe and like others made changes. Used basil instead of parsley and sub olive oil for butter, deglazed pan with some white wine as well as chick stock. I was tossing with pasta. Threw in some steamed broc too. Delicious, will have again. I did not salt the fish just peppered it in the cast iron.

Even more than the sauce I love this for cooking the swordfish to perfection. I usually dry it out but this was easy and foolproof, really. I usually follow a recipe to a "T" before altering, and next time I will follow the advice of so many others and deglaze with some white wine. And I might substitute some of the butter with olive oil as it has quite a lot of butter which I tend to avoid these days. Oh, and go easy on the salt rub in the beginning. It needs far less than a piece of red meat.

Loved this recipe! Will become a staple in our household. Swordfish came out extremely moist and perfectly cooked after 10 minutes in the oven. Sauce was delicious! I deglazed the pan with white wine (important), used 3 garlic cloves and dried parsley. Served it with angel hair pasta with simple olive oil and garlic. My husband loved it!

Great recipe even though I did not have on hand parsley, lemon or mixed (just regular) peppercorn! But I followed the technique and it was spot on. The swordfish was delicious and moist, even though mine was really thick so it needed a few more minutes of roasting. Pouring the butter over top set this off perfectly!

My husband would never ever choose fish for dinner - home or restaurant - said this was amazing! The 3 minute skillet and then 10 minute bake - well, I did 8 minutes - was perfect in a cast iron skillet. Served with mashed potatoes and fresh zucchini- a winner!

Great recipe. Perfect use of fresh swordfish and ingredients I always have on hand. As in other reviews, I added a splash of white wine (champagne actually since that's what we had open) to the butter to deglaze the pan. I served with mushroom ravioli, steamed broccoli and baguette. Delicious, fast, nutritious!

This is a very simple recipe. The ingredients are not overpowering to the fresh taste of the fish. I also added 2 TBS white wine to the butter and deglazed the pan. One fact remains: there is no substitute for fresh fish.

I have made this soooo many times and it's always GREAT! We recently dined at a local fine resturant, my husband ordered the swordfish and was, as we say, underwhelmed. My pan roasted swordfish was way better.

This recipe was great! My household is averse to the use of butter so I used a bit of olive oil instead and it worked great. I made this with a side of linguine and sauteed the pasta in the garlic and oil instead of drizzling it on the fish. I'll have to be careful with the salt content (I over-seasoned a little) but I'll definitely make this again! yay!

OMG, soooo good and easy. Bought a huge steak at an Ensenada fish market (we live in Mexico), barely fit in my big pan. Will make this again.

Excellent recipe which turned the swordfish (always seems to overcook in other recipes) into a delicious moist meal. We used another clove of garlic and the sauce was fantastic. Served with boiled potatoes which worked perfectly with extra sauce. Easy to prepare but you wouldn't know it... therefore, great for dinner parties!

I've never had swordfish this good before. It was moist, perfectly cooked, and delicious. I didn't have a fancy peppercorn medley so I just used the normal pepper in my pepper grinder. I won't hesitate to buy fresh swordfish again in the future thanks to this recipe.

I rarely give out 4 stars and based on the simplicity of this recipe did not expect to be dishing out 4 for this one, however, it deserves the praise most reviewers have heaped on it. I made a couple small changes to forestall a trip to the grocery which were substituting lime juice for lemon and using frozen meyer lemon zest for the peel in this recipe. I also used dried parsley. The result was really fantastic and I could imagine the next time serving the butter in a small demitasse cup. My wife loved the fact that the fish was so warm from cooking in the 400 degree oven for 10 minutes. This is just another example of the simplest recipes being the best when you use good ingredients.

I have used this recipe now four times and each time my husband raves about it. I follow the recipe exactly and the swordfish is moist and delicious. It has become our favorite way to prepare swordfish by far. You won't go wrong trying this out if you don't overcook the fish.

My boyfriend's exact words, "This may be the best meal i have ever eaten in my life." I think this can be true for anyone who makes this dish, if you ALWAYS USE FRESH FISH. Always. I eyeballed the butter seasonings and added some fresh chopped chives. Also, when it says cook until browned, you really just want to watch the fish (dont move it around) and flip when it's opaque about halfway up the steak. It will be browned automatically by then, if your stove's the right temp.

Butter sauce rocks. I was afraid to overcook the sword, I did two minutes on each side -- Very hot pan and it was spectacular. I made my dish with haricots verts and roasted butternut squash.

If I had not read the reviews, this meal would not have been good. I added the zest of a whole lemon and juice from half a lemon. I should have listened to the person who recommended to cut back on the butter (it was SO greasy). I also used the recommendation to deglaze the pan with a splash of white wine - genious! I added shallots and a bit more garlic but we like garlic. Also I used the recommendation to cook your vegetables in the butter sauce - very smart move. So, the recipe is good except for excess butter, the rest of what was recommended made this dish excellent.

Was okay, but needed something more as the flavor was a bit bland and had a bit too much butter for my taste. I'm not sure what I'm missing that others seem to like, but I'd prefer swordfish with something else like a mango salsa or chimichurri sauce.

Rating: 3
Very quick, tasty and moist. I didn't have mixed peppercorns, but used coarse-ground black and some lemon-pepper along with the rind and maybe a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice. Per other reviewers, I used about 7 Tbs. butter and 2 cloves garlic. I nuked some peas with the remnants of the sauce in the mixing bowl and served with some warm multigrain artisan bread for dipping in the extra sauce. Everyone loved it.

I just loved this. I made one simply for myself and cut it back appropriately. The only thing I did different was add some veggies - onion, potatoes, green beens - right in the pan with the swordfish from the outset. I left them in the pan when I put the seasoned butter in and it all tasted superb!

Made this last night for Sunday family dinner and everyone loved it. I used white wine to deglaze the pan and then added twice the garlic and a bit of lemon juice as suggested by others. I served with roasted potatoes and greenbeans. It was a perfect summertime meal. Will definitely make again!

YUM!! - I deglazed the skillet with white wine and cooked it down, after I remove the fish - before you add the butter mixture to the skillet. You can use a bit of wine (1/4 cup, maybe more) so as to dilute the butter sauce, as it is rich. But not too much as you don't want the sauce to be too runny. I used 2 cloves of garlic, minced, and let the butter mixture cook a few minutes to be sure that the garlic cooked a little. I also added juice from 1/2 of a lemon to the butter. Next time, I will use more lemon juice.

Rating: 4
Wow! Super star recipe. I was looking for something more complex but the ratings induced me to try this and I am glad I did. I will use this method and seasoned butter sauce over and over. Trout, tuna, and any whitefish should all be good prepared this way. Try it you will like it!

Rating: 4
Delicious! I added lemon juice (almost 1/2 lemon for two 7 oz steaks), went light on the garlic (my hubby prefers a light touch with this vegetable), and deglazed the pan with a splash of white wine. Reduced the juices, mounted with the butter mixture--voila! Thought making a butter spread was a bit fussy at first, but it made sauce creation so quick and no-brainer, I may use it more in future.

This was fabulous and easy to reheat later. I used tuna instead of swordfish, but all in all very successful, easy to prepare, and healthy.

Great recipe for swordfish steaks. Came out nice as is, but my second time I just used the juice and zest of one lemon and upped the garlic to 4 cloves smashed and minced and it was even better for my taste.

Once I started this recipe I realized that this is how I cook swordfish all the time anyway. I also add some shallots with the garlic or some finely dice red peppers or some scallions depending on what I have laying around. I'll also deglaze the pan with some white wine before making the sauce.

Based on comments by other reviewers, I added a quick squeeze of lemon juice to the butter. Perfect! I only made one large sword steak. If I had made all four steaks, I would have wanted to double the butter. Easy & quick weeknight dinner.

I also doubled the garlic, tripled the lemon zest and added 1/2 t. lemon juice. Next time I will sprinkle fresh parsley on the plated Swordfish or I may use fresh dill in the butter. I watched it like a hawk and it was perfectly cooked and yummy!

Thanks to the other reviewers I upped the lemon zest. I also doubled the garlic (cuz we love that flavor). It turned out terrific! Turned our Monday night supper into something special. Used thawed swordfish steaks from Trader Joe's and whipped up some mushroom risotto to compliment. Dee-lish!

Awesome sauce! Loved the parsley butter over the steak. Might have to make it with mashed potatoes next time to let the butter seep down through the mash.

I will make this again with adjustments. I think the problem was there was quite a bit of liquid in the pan at the end, and I didn't drain it before putting the butter sauce in. Therefore, it made for a very watered-down version of the sauce. And/or I would make double the sauce, because there is not a lot of sauce to begin with. I think given that it would be very good.

4 forks... Reserved for only the best. This recipe is so simple, yet incredible. It is just as any fish recipe should be. It helped that I found an exemplary piece of fish... 10 minutes in the oven is just right.. came out slight pink and finished cooking while I cooked the butter is just right. I served with roasted aspargus (10 minutes in the same oven) and roasted polenta (had some chilled polenta from the prior week in the fridge, cut in cubes, threw in pan with some olive oil, salt and pepper, a couple of teaspoons cheese, baked for 30 minutes until slightly brown) The only thing to make it better? I am jealous of the review with the marlin. I can't get marlin in Connecitut (oh, I am sure I could for a price, this recipe might be worth trying it).

I have made this recipe as written and sometimes adding a little more garlic, according to company's taste. It is great for weekday entertaining as the mixture of peppercorns makes an impression. I have served it with rice pilaf,cous cous, and roasted potatoes and get complements each time.

Delicious and very easy. This is a perfect recipe for a quick week-night dinner. I used more garlic than the recipe called for (2 cloves instead of 1) and I used marlin steaks instead of swordfish. Both my husband and I loved it!
