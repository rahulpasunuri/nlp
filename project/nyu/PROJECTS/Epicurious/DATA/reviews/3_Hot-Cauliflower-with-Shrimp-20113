Bland, bland bland. Now I love both shrimp and cauliflower but this recipe does justice to neither.... even with additional dill, pepper and onion.

Well,......not the tastiest recipe I've tried, however..... I added some gruyere cheese at the end and lots of chopped mushrooms. I'll try it again with a few adjustments.

Sauce was pretty tasteless - the nutmeg suggestion was taken - thank goodness! Heavy - definitely a 60s kind of recipe!

This is my second time on this one. This time I cooked fresh shrimp in the strained milk. Thinned down the sauce a little, added the cooked cauliflower and turned it in to a chowder. A couple of grates of nutmeg to finish - fabulous.

When I made this recipe I didn't add the whipped heavy cream at the end and got a thinner sauce that was less fattening and use the extra sauce for potato sauce,

I thought this would be excellent but the frozen precooked shrimp I bought had the exact same texture as the cauliflower - which for us fussy types is a cooking no-no - the sauce was very thick so I added some lemon juice at the end - the sauce is lovely but unfortunately the combo was a little too odd under the tooth for me

This recipe was fabulous and very easy and quick to prepare. All of my sons turned their noses up at it, looks kind-a icky, but they asked for seconds. I have used cauliflower, but have also used broccoli when cauliflower wasn't in the house. Very good either way.

This turned out to absolutely delicious. However, I subsituted the onion for garlic. Mine seemed a little more like a cauliflower/shrimp chowder and I used a spoon to get every bit! It is really a unique dish and a new light way to use shrimp! Enjoy!

I made the recipe as given with 1 small exception - I used double cream and didn't whip it. Even my husband's non-adventurous English brother and family loved it, including their non-cauliflower eating son. They even took the recipe home with them - definitely a keeper!

This is so very good as is...I like to add a dash of nutmeg & a sprinkle of chopped chives as a garnish. Another variation is to add some grated swiss cheese to the sauce.
