used rose wine and it was wonderfully light and VERY tastey. ice cream maker didn't do a thing. needed about 24 hours in the freezer to firm up and get 'slurpy-fied'. everyone loved it. quick and really, really easy.

I served this during a 4th of July cookout. I absolutely loved it! I thought that the raspberry flavor was superb and enhanced by the wine. I wouldn't have known there was wine had I not made it. All of the women felt this way about it. However, all of the men could only taste the wine and said they couldn't taste the raspberries. I found it interesting that it split down gender lines. I and the other ladies rate it at four forks but the men rate it an okay two - so I will split the difference in my rating.

As written, it tasted too much like Manischewitz concord grape, and I used a decent wine for it - in the end, it turned out tasting good because I added a fair amount of framboise, amaretto, grand marnier, and toasted almond slices, so it tasted more like a frozen sangria.

David Lebovitz says this is his all time favorite sorbet -- well, now it's mine, too! I've never before made a sorbet with such a terrific consistency, with the end product looking just like the photo. The taste was lovely -- the red wine and raspberry tastes mingled perfectly. I write a blog about recipes I've tried that worked, called Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins, and this is one of the recipes featured on it.

This was a great way to use some very good wine that had sat just a bit too long. You don't need an ice cream maker: Pour cooled mixture into a glass backing dish (big enough so it's not super deep). Every 60 minutes or so for a couple of hours, stir it around with a fork. As it thickens, use the fork to "shave" the ice (over night, go 4-5 hours). By the next day, you have a great texture and if you want, then "compact" it down into the dish. And danwdogg below is right about the sugar!

I thought this was exceptional. Just like the author says, the two flavors combine into something much better than just raspberries or just red wine. The only caution I would give is to taste your berries first and let that determine how much sugar you use. I bought raspberries this weekend (memorial day) and they were REALLY SWEET by themselves. Adding an entire cup of sugar to in-season berries made them almost too sweet, so you might consider backing the sugar to maybe 3/4 or even 1/2 cup if your berries are REALLY good already. Highly recommend!
