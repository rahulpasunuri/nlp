Delicious! Much more time consuming than something I would tag "quick and easy", but well worth it.

How do you classify a recipe, that requires 8 hour to marinate, as "Quick and Easy"? Easy yes, quick hardly. I'll review it later, now I have to figure out what appetizer I'll serve tonight.

This appetizer has gotten really rave reviews every time I have made it. Friends who don't even like eggplant LOVE these. I would say the only negative is that having to make the eggplant the night before requires extra planning and time. I also have trouble frying the eggplant uniformly and find that I need to constantly add more olive oil to the pan in order not to burn them. But despite this, it still turns out fantastically and all are eaten every time.

I found this recipe a little bland and disappointing.

This took a while to make, but it tasted great in the end. I had it on whole wheat pita with some goat cheese as the recipe recommended.

My contribution to a family dinner. Most were all "ew, eggplant" or "ew, goat cheese" but not a slice left after all the chirping was done. Fried it the first time, and baked it a second time. Baking was FAR easier, and only slightly less tasty than the holy high maintenance frying version.

Fantastic! I took the advice of other reviewers and baked the eggplant with just a few sprays of olive oil. The marinade created a complex flavor that my guests raved about. This will be my "go to" dinner party salad this summer!

This is becoming a summer staple but I rather than fry the eggplant, I brush it w. olive oil, both sides, and bake it in the oven at 300-350 F. Everybody who has tried it loves it.

Very good. I only had one large eggplant but also a beautiful head of fennel which I also sauted and added to the marinade. Delisch!

Delicious. Just happened to have picked up wonderful goat cheese, fresh bread and eggplants at the farmers market this morning. It was meant to be! It only marinated for 7 hours -- I couldn't wait until tomorrow to taste it. Everyone loved it!

I love this recipe and look forward to making it every summer. You can tweak the recipe to suit your taste but definitely try it with the goat cheese (or feta) and good bread. Sublime.

Really, really nice. Even my husband, who hates eggplant like nothing else, tasted it and said "huh, not so bad!" I look forward to finishing the rest all by myself.

Yummy! This dish got great reviews from my family. Baking the eggplant is definitely easier than sauteing, but I think sauteing has a superior result. Goat cheese and bread are the perfect compliment.

Wow-made mostly accdng to recipe but cut down on the mint-too cloying! Layered the eggplant(after a day of marinating) on a platter with very thin slices of mozzarella and served as a 1st course salad. This is a summertime keeper!

Agreed with all reviewers..great 'appy' or side. Have made this dish several times now and haved added more garlic and mint for added flavor..agree that toasting eggplant in the oven is much more effective than recipe calls. Stuffed eggplant in halved, small sized toasted pitas which gives variation and easier to hold.

I sliced the eggplant thinly, brushed with oil and baked in the oven until tender. Much easier then frying. This recipe was a big hit. The good goat cheese was key.

I would not have tried this recipe without the great reviews. Just not a combo I'd have imagined. Like others, I used just enough oil to pan saute the slices. I spread Laughing Cow Lite wedges for the cheese, and it was delish! My husband, who thinks he doesn't like eggplant, ate 4 huge bread slices with the cheese and eggplant. This made a wonderful international and vegetarian meal with one of the fast gazpacho recipes also on this site.

Excellent! Just a personal note: you may want to use 3T red-wine vinegar mixed with 2T red wine instead of 5T vinegar for a milder taste.

Instead of the 2/3 c of olive oil to fry the eggplant, I only used enough to pan fry the slices, probably 6 T total as I sauteed in 3 batches. I made it last night and took it to an afternoon lunch the today and it was devoured by everyone. The eggplant was great on its on, sublime with the goat cheese.

This is delicious! I arranged the lengthwise-cut eggplant slices in a circle on a plate like a flower and it was an attractive dish with some mint leaves scattered on top. There were no leftovers and everyone wanted to know recipe. I referred them to Epicurious, of course.

I made this recipe for my moms B-day and she said " were did you learn to cook like that?"
