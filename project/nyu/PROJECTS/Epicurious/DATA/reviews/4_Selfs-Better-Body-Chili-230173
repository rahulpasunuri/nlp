This is my go to recipe for Chili. It could not be easier. The addition of the cocoa powder gives it a really rich flavor. I follow the recipe exactly and have never been disappointed.

Based on the positive reviews, I thought this would be a good vegetarian dish to add to my repertoire. It was not. Bland, unattractive, and a waste of ingredients is what I would call it. My husband and I NEVER throw out food and we couldn't eat more than one spoonful each. If I could have given this 0 forks, I would have.

Good. Used with more chili, half a habanero, more oregano, black beans. Didn't like the egg on top. Cilantro a great garnish.

It's a standby. Makes us feel great, tastes good (esp with a little dab of herbs/onion/garlic on top) and isn't high calorie. The perfect meal.

Made this last night for "Soup Nite". I usually make (3) different soups and have friends & family stop by after work to eat soup! So much fun. Some folks bring something to share, some don't. Either way is just fine! Anyway, tomorrow's Soup Nite is going to be a Chili Cook- Off. Everyone is bringing a pot of their very best homemade chili. We'll all taste them and use my homemade scorecards to come up with the winning chili. This one will be my contribution. I added some browned ground turkey to mine (since I had some leftover from last night's dinner) as well as two cans of black beans. (I doubled the recipe!) I didn't taste it but hubby did and he said it was awesome. We'll have to see what the "judges" think tomorrow evening!!

Very easy recipe. I doubled the chili powder and cumin and added two cans of black beans. This definitely serves more than 4.

We also add a lot of kidney beans. The health benefits Self mag claims are pretty funny, but this is undeniably a good-for-you, filling soup that crowds a lot of veggies and vitamins into one bowl. We love it.

Delicious! I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned (about 4 cups chopped) and bell peppers from my garden. I added one chopped habanero pepper, which added just the right amount of heat. I also added 1 cup of frozen corn (originally from my garden) and a can of black beans. I omitted the cumin because my daughter doesn't like it. I about doubled the sweet potato because I had a large one and wanted to use it all up. And I used chicken broth instad of water. The combination of the sweet potatoes, cranberries, cocoa, and in my case, the corn gave this chili a complex sweetness that is divine.

Excellent! I added a can of drained red kidney beans near the end of simmering.

I used curry powder instead of oregano, and skipped the boiled eggs. I also substituted regular potatoes for half of the carrots because I'm not a big carrot fan. The combination of the cumin, cinnamon, chili powder, in addition to the onions and garlic was delicious. This recipe says it serves 4, but it makes a LOT. I would say it easily serves 6-10, but I've frozen the leftovers for another rainy day.
