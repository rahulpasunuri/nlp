Solid breakfast or brunch dish, and quite delicious. To make serving easier, I chopped the bread slices into large chunks after brushing them with the garlic butter. I also add some sauteed onion, which added great flavor. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was a very popular dish with my family on Christmas morning.

exceptional. Made this for 50 people, and everyone had seconds. Added oregano, thyme, and espillet pepper. A new classic for our household.

Great basic recipe to tweak to what you have laying around. Used cheddar jalapeno bread, and added green chiles, jalapenos, and black olives. Sauteed a regular onion with the sausage instead of using the green onions. Omitted the salt, doesn't really need it with the amount of salt you get from the sausage. Cooked it uncovered because I like a more crunchy top. Cooked ten minutes faster.

Can't wait for Christmas already! This breakfast is my favorite part. Next year I'm going to try this meal again using spicy chorizo and some ripe, nutty, avocados sliced on top. Mexican avocados are in season in the winter too - perfect!

This is a great recipe! I make it with the thick frozen garlic bread (think Pepperidge Farms...) and it is a killer. We make it once a year at a big gathering of friends from school, and it goes over well.

Oh, and my family likes it best with the sage breakfast sausage.

How funny to find a breakfast casserole recipe on here. Been making this for years. I usually use stale bread (which I save, cubed, in the freezer for stuffing or whatever), pour the butter over the cubes instead of spreading it, and I usually add chopped onion and green pepper, which I saute with garlic. I was kind of shocked at the number of eggs. I only use 8 eggs, mixed with 1 3/4 cups of milk and I usually put about a tablespoon of mustard and one or two teaspoons of worcestershire sauce into the egg mixture. I put it together the night before and the morning of, just pop it into the oven. Too funny.

I found this to be rather bland and given the fact that there are 24 eggs in the recipe, the bread tends to take over and it doesn't taste very creamy - as you would expect from the egg and milk combination in the ingredients. If I make it again, I will use less bread, more garlic, more cheese, more spices to give it more of a kick.

Loved it...so easy to whip up......however,, was a bit dry looking when i pulled it out of fridge from overnight storage.i drizzeled cream ontop to re-wet it..... then added more cheese last 5 min of baking....... big hit on christmas day!!

We cowboyed up this Christmas a.m. and really enjoyed this dish. We used 3 cloves of garlic (rather than the one it calls for), a bit more cheese and a bit more butter. We also put a slight amount of parmesan (shaved with a citrus rasp) on top. The casserole puffed up nicely. Really good and soooo filling.

this was good but i also added cooked maple bacon to the sausage. this totally changed the entire taste but it was scarfed down by my entire family before i even got to have a bite!

I used the frozen texas toast to save time, but forgot to cut down on the salt. It was still good, but too salty.

A few basic modifications make this recipe a no-brain winner. To begin with, cube the bread prior to layering it and this will enhance absorption of the egg mixture. Instead of food processing the garlic and butter, I melted a stick of butter on low heat and then minced 5 to 6 cloves of garlic and added a little kosher salt. I threw in 1/4 cup diced white onions and minced another garlic clove to sautee with the sausage. On top of the sausage layer add some sauteed baby port mushrooms. Additionally I added about 3/4 red bell pepper, diced and sauteed, on top of the mushrooms. In lieu of the shallots I added aobut 1/4 cup finely minced white onion to the egg mixture. Finally I substituted gruyere chees for the sharp chedder. I happened to have some gruyere that needed to be used. I served this with a spinach and gargonzola salad topped with walnut pieces, dried cranberries and apple slivers served with a light raspberry dressing. The meal was delicious and enjoyed by all.

I've made this twice now and it's always a hit, both with family and friends. I don't change much about the recipe except I use frozen garlic texas toast (why make your own when the supermarket can make it for you??) and I substitute turkey breakfast sausage for pork...just makes the final product a little less greasy with no change to the flavor. Such a great make-ahead dish for brunches.

I made this Christmas morning and was less than thrilled. I did use garlic toast - but the whole dish was very bland.

I made this recipe with egg substitute and soyrizo (chorizo made out of soy). It was wonderful even with the substitutions.

Good as written, but nothing special. I made the following changes and my family agreed they liked it much better. Instead of the breakfast sausage and scallions, I used crumbled and browned chorizo, sauteed red and green peppers and onion. I also used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1 and sliced the bread a little thinner.

Rating: 2
This recipe was ok- I give it 2.5 out of 4 forks because I made some pretty big modifications that I would consider necessary. As written, the recipe would have been quite bland so I increased the garlic from 1 clove to 4 cloves and added sautéed green peppers and onion to the recipe, but additional vegetable could have been added too. I also doubled the amount of cheese. I also think that the bread was a little too thick and overwhelmed the egg layer. Next time I would cut the bread to about ¾ inch. Overall, the recipe was good, but not great. That being said, the entree was easy to sever and everyone seemed to enjoy it.

I find sausage can be a little greasy so I used crispy bacon and ham. I also added a little diced green pepper.

I made this last christmas brunch for our extended family. Everyone raced to get the last bite. The only thing I changed was that instead of making my own garlic bread I just used the texas toast from the freezer. It was a huge hit and will now be one of my staple casseroles for Christmas brunch.

The caveat about having the butter side down when placing the foil over the dish for baking was very wise.

After all the rave reviews, I thought this would be something really special. I would compare it to a breakfast casserole-- good, but not great, and much more of a "comfort food" than anything for a special occasion. It was good, but I'm not sure that I would ever make it again

This recipe was a great find when I found it in the Dec 2004 mag - I have made it almost every Christmas since - so easy to make everything is done nite before & pop it in the oven while opening presents - no hassel & great taste!

Unfortunately, this is the first recipe I've found on Epicurious.com that I was really disappointed with. I'm not a food snot, but have come to expect excellent, gourmet recipes from this site. This is a basic strata recipe, but it calls for 24 EGGS! The taste wasn't worth it...

I knew this would be good, but I was stunned by the rave reviews from the pickiest kid eater to each adult! I made this Christmas morning and several times since. Definitely go with the Texas toast and adding a bit of red pepper definitely adds color and some extra pizzaz. Easy to make and you will want to ... again ... and again!

This was my 2nd time making this recipe. We rename it the Leprechaun breakfast as we serve it at our St. Patrick's Day brunch. I realize it's a little early but in Old Town Alexandria, the St. Patrick's Day parade is always the first weekend of March. The only changes that I make to the recipe are: 16 eggs instead of 24 (still used the same amount of milk) and turkey breakfast sausage instead of pork sausage (I have several friends who don't eat pork plus the turkey sausage is better for us).

Meant to add that eventhough I halved the recipe, I still used a full cup of milk. It kept it nice and moist!

This was delish. And definitely used the Pepp. Farm Texas toast...once it's baked in the dish, you wouldn't even know the difference and neither will your guests! I halved the recipe so what I did that follows wouldn't apply to the full measurements of the ingredients. I cooked my sausage (hot italian out of the casing) in my 12 in. saute pan (oven-safe), took out the sausage kept grease in the pan (put some aside for the foil). put the toast right in the pan, crust facing to the outside of pan (so you have a nice little edge when you cut it). Sausage back in and followed the directions and just popped it in the oven. Perfect and just cut it like a pie.

Although this is a great make ahead dish, I was a bit disappointed with this recipe. It lacked flavor and I think the cooking temperature is too high, making the egg mixture tough. I tried it twice. Once following the exact recipe and once adding a few extras (more garlic, Habanero cheese, green chilies, diced cooked onion and a bit of southwestern seasoning.) The flavor was better, but the custard was still tough. If I do this again, I will try cooking it in a water bath at a lower temperature to make a more tender custard texture.

add some green chili's to spice it up. i don't bother with the texas toast but add plain diced white bread instead and defiantely let this soak overnight. spinach is a good addition too. great easy breakfast for a crowd!

I just made this to test before Christmas. My three year old won't eat eggs. He had two helpings!!!!! I didn't have whole milk on hand so I used evaporated milk. It was DELICIOUS!!! Definately will make for Christmas morning!!!! Not too difficult either, all ingredients I had on hand.

5/6 guests loved this dish. The other one needed more 'meat'. Followed other reviewer's good idea to use the frozen Texas toast. I added a can of mild green chiles - good but needs more 'kick'. Next time, I will slice the bread and layer like lagsagne (the way it is written all of the 'good stuff' rises to the top), double the sausage, add jalepeno and red peppers for color. May also try using spicy sausage or venison sausage.

I made this Christmas morning and people still haven't stopped raving about it. Only thing- Don't bother making your own texas toast. You can buy it in the frozen bread section and it already has the garlic butter all over it. Don't make the recipe harder than it is. I just popped the whole box out of the freezer and into my baking dish. There is no way anyone would think it isn't gourmet.
