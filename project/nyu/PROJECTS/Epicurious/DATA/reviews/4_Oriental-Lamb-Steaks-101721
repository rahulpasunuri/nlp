I love a recipe so simple that its author doesn't even bother to put in measurements. I added some sesame oil to the marinade and only did about 90 minutes. It was simply wonderful. I'd give it 3 1/2 forks.

Sometimes simplicity wins - what a lovely way to remember James Beard. A beautiful recipe (despite the 1950's politically incorrect name) with some slight alterations. I added chopped green onions. We all loved this dish served with rice and wok'd snow peas.

This dish is wonderfully delicious even though the ingredients and the preparation are extremely simple. I did update the recipe slightly. To make enough marinade for (2) one pound lamb steaks which will serve 3 to 4, combine ¼ cup of soy sauce, 1 ½ teaspoons minced garlic, 1 tablespoon of fresh grated ginger. I also included 1 tablespoon of water and 1 tablespoon of canola oil. After whisking these ingredients in a small bowl to combine thoroughly, place the marinade with the lamb steaks in a 1 gallon plastic zipper bag making sure to remove as much air from the bag and seal tightly. Allow the steaks to marinate in the refrigerator (turning occasionally) for about 2 ½ hours. I think marinating too long disrupts the integrity of the meat. Using a gas grill, I grilled the steaks on moderately high heat to a medium rare doneness. Along with the lamb I served a side of sautéed spinach and accompanied with Rice Timbales with Black and White Sesame Seeds, one of my favorites on this website. Supper was fantastic and a huge success. Give it a try!
