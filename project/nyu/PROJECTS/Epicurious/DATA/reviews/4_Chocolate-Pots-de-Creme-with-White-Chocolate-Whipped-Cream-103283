Delicious, but I must have done something wrong because they were soupy, did not set at all. I don't think the 25 minutes is long enough. The last recipe I used was 55 minutes and was perfect, the consistency of a truffle.. I tried this one because it had a higher rating.

I've made this twice now and it came out perfect both times...and it is so easy. My dinner party guests couldn't stop raving at how delicious it tasted. Instead of using instant espresso I used VIA Italian Roast instant coffee. Yummmmmy! As the toping I used regular whipped cream made from scratch without the white chocolate and topped it with dark chocolate shavings. The presentation was lovely.

Easy, easy, easy. Delicious, delicious, delicious. Skipped the chocolate whipped cream for plain whipped cream -- just perfect. Great at any time of the year.

It's all true! Super easy & delicious. I threw some raspberries on top and added a blob of regular whipped cream (per the advice of the other reviewers I did NOT attempt the white chocolate version). Garnished the whole thing with a couple of coffee beans & a mint leaf, and my guests were astounded!

This is a simple and easy dessert to make that will get wonderful "Wow!"s out of your guests. We were blown away ourselves at how great it was. I agree with a lot of the comments to skip the white chocolate aspect of the whipped cream. DO NOT, however skip the whipped cream! We added some Frangelico to it and it was fantastic!

I made these in mini ramekins for a potluck and they won 1st prize! I'm not a baker by any means, but the presentation is so gourmet and the taste so decadent & creamy, EVERYONE thought I had spent hours in the kitchen cooking. Shockingly easy! The key is the chocolate. Use HIGH QUALITY bittersweet quality for the best results.

This was fabulous. I skipped the white chocolate whipped cream and just used plain heavy cream beaten with a little sugar. It definitely didn't need anything very sweet. The custard had a lovely creamy texture. I'll be making it for Christmas dinner!

Extraordinarily easy and delicious. Got rave reviews from a notoriously picky crowd. As others have said, skip the white chocolate whipped cream; heavy cream beaten with sugar and vanilla is perfect with this. Made it the day before a dinner party and they were just perfect.

Insanely easy and equally insanely delicious! My husband thought these were 'not sweet enough' for him - which is strange because i'm the one with the sweet tooth. I LOVED them

I only made the custard, not the whipped cream recipe shown here. The custard was so easy to make and was a big hit with everyone. Very creamy and not overly sweet. Just whipped a little heavy cream and threw in a bit of liquer. Yummy.

Sinful and worth every guilty bite! A tiny piece of Heaven in every lick of the spoon.

Wow - really great. I loved that it could be made in advance which is a timesaver for a dinner party. I did not use the White Chocolate Whipped Cream but made my own Kaluha Whipped Cream which was wonderful.

Creamy and delicious. I didn't use coffee/espresso powder substituted with drip coffee and it came out wonderful. It was simple to make and great to do in advance for a dinner party.

i made this for valentine's day and it was a huge success. it was so rich and creamy, i couldn't believe how easy it was. i made regular sweetened whipped cream instead of the white chocolate b/c i already had too many things going on in the kitchen. i may try it next time.

Made exactly as written with the exception of the white chocolate whipped cream. Used store bought whipped cream (not cool whip,) chocolate shavings, a raspberry and mint leaves. Tested it this week to take to Christmas dinner. Husband approved!

Absolutely delicious! I made this exactly as described in the recipe, but left out the white chocolate cream based on what I had read from previous reviewers. I wonder if it is ok to make the individual pots in smaller ramkins? Will definitely make again and again.

We used plain, sweetened whipped cream so prep was fast and easy. The pots de creme are very rich, making it a perfect dessert to share.

Doubled the recipe and made it for a large dinner party. Great make ahead dish with plenty of dazzle factor for dessert.

I used Callebaut bittersweet chocolate and baked it for an extra 10 minutes. Also, I strained the liquid before pouring into the ramakins to get rid of any tiny lumps that remained. I also used slightly sweetened real whipped cream. I have made it substituting instant coffee with good results, however it is outstanding just as written. VERY rich!!

Super simple, but your guests think you spent hours slaving over a hot stove. I've had many requests for the recipe. After reading other reviews I decided to make my own whipping cream, just add your favorite liquor for a bit of a twist

We serve this at our restaurant and it has becomet he talk of the town. Don't put too much espresso in it or it will overpower the dish.

Fabulous recipe!!! Easy to make and a raving hit with my dinner club. I did not make the white chocolate whipped cream due to the negative reviews. However, I served it with homemade whipped cream topped with chocolate shavings and espresso powder. Excellent!!!

Terrific! Fantastic! Perfect! I did make a few small changes. I used a shot of double rich espresso instead of the powder. I used 5 instead of 4 ounces of chocolate. I used lightly sweetened whipped cream, no need for anything else. I actually overcooked it not trusting that it would set. I prefer very firm rather than pudding like. It is extremely rich. I used 3oz express cups which is large enough for this rich desert.

All the positive reviews of this recipe convinced me to try it, and I was not disappointed! I used a combo of Valrona and Sharffen Berger chocolates, and for the espresso I used fresh ground espresso beans which I then placed in a plastic bag and hammered even finer with a rolling pin. I omitted the whipped cream topping; I didn't want to overwhelm the dish with more chocolate and richness. Finally, I served the dessert with demi-tasses of espresso. Definitely an overwhelming hit that made me look like a very good cook!

Yummy! This was the second pots de creme recipe I tried and it came out GREAT! It's rich, satisfying, chocolately and easy. I didn't bother with the white chocolate whipped cream, but may the next time I make this. Even so, this was delicious.

Nice, rich, creamy dessert. I omitted the Espresso powder, but added some Grand Marnier to the White Chocolate whipped cream, which complimented the dessert very nicely. I might add more White Chocolate next time, as well as some Kahlua to the Pots. Overall a hit with my wife.

This is an amazing dessert. I substituted 1 tsp. of Amaretto because I did not have any espresso powder. I used just regular Cool Whip in place of the white chocolate cream and it was just fine.

I halved the recipe and made three of these for a romantic Valentines day dinner. Since, I had to work that day and had class, these were perfect since I could make them the day before. Silky smooth and sinfully delcious and a snap to make.

Decadently wonderful! This dessert may stop conversation as your guests contemplate the rich deep chocolate flavors they are experiencing. The Pots de Creme is the chocolate cousin of Creme Bruelee. I alterted the recipe slightly as I did not have any expresso powder. Instead of expresso powder I added a about 1/4tsp vanilla and 1tsp of chambord (raspberry liqueur). I was trying to add a little complexity to the chocolate. Easy recipe and could be made a day ahead.
