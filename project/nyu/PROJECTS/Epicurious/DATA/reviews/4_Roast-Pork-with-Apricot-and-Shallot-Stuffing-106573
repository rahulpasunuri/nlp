Disappointingly bland. I added some garlic cloves and a little sage to the stuffing after reading the reviews, but the flavor of this dish was just not that interesting.

I made this stuffing for pork chops instead of a roast. Everyone loved it!

Simply an awesome recipe. The only difference instead of roasting in the oven I smoked it with apple and a little hickory. This is a MUST try, and crowd pleaser.

Truly an awesome recipe. Made it according to the recipe, with one exception... tossed it on the smoker and smoked it with apple wood.

My husband's response to this dish: "Wow. That was a big plate of awesome!". I had leftover stuffing from Thanksgiving that I used instead of making my own, and it worked just fine. My roast was a little bigger than the recipe called for, so my stuffing to pork ratio was a little off. Still, it was delicious!

This recipe was great! I had a 1 lb pork loin roast so I scaled it down. I substituted cornbread for the white bread and added minced fresh rosemary before toasting. I deglazed the pan with a bit of fume blanc and water and wow! I can't wait to make this again!!!

I don't know how to rate this yet and I think it's my fault. The apricots I used aren't as sweet as they should be, now my stuffing has a very sour taste. All the flavors aside from the apricots are delicious (the bread, parsley, shallots). How can I save this? Will the natural sugars come out as it bakes inside the pork? Please HELP!

Excellent taste and beautiful presentation. I used canned apricots instead of fresh as it's all I could find. Needed to cook for longer than recipe said. It took about an hour and 15 minutes. Will definitely make this again!

Made this last night and received the first ever "10" from my husband! Followed the recipe almost exactly... Used canned apricots and used 2 tenderloins, butterflied, stuffed, then tied together with butcher's twine. I had extra stuffing, so I surrounded the pork roast with it, also added butternut squash tossed in olive oil and seasoned with salt and pepper around the stuffing. Served with Horseradish Mashed Potatoes (Gourmet's version on this website) and peas. A perfect Sunday dinner! I think I'll offer to make this for Easter.

I can understand what all the other reviewers were raving about. The meal was awesome. It was definitely worth all the work for Sunday dinner. My advice is to make this one as it really is something your family will love.

Wow! I wanted to do something different for Christmas dinner, with my in-laws coming out. Now, I live in a small town in Podunk, Nebraska, so I have very little access to quality ingredients. I had to substitute canned apricots. However, that worked to my advantage. Rather than the silly water deglaze, I used 1/2 c of Gewursttraminer and then added a full cup of the apricot nectar and reduce it with butter to a marvelous glaze which just shone beautifully. This is likely going to become Christmas tradition. The only other change I made was throwing about 15 fresh sage leaves in the stuffing. Worked out great.

Easy and impressive. Used peaches from my tree and made up my own sauce. Following some of the other reviews, I used the entire amount of stuffing for a 2 lb roast. Threw some slices of delicata squash (like a butternut or acorn squash) around the roast while it was cooking. They got nice and soft with a caramelized bottom. My husband said it was perfect!

I merged this with the Mortadella Stuffed Pork Roast on this site; had the butcher butterfly a center- cut pork loin roast. Spread half with paste of butter, crushed garlic, s & p. Then layered with 4 slices proscuitto, fresh spinach leaves, sauteed shallots, chopped dried apricots, parsley, and 3 thin slices of baguette bread. Rolled, tied and topped with 2 slices bacon. Deglazed with red wine but I think a port or madeira would be better. It was very impressive visually, and the guests raved about it. A definite keeper!

I've made this a few times, always to raves. The only change I made was to use dried apricots which I simmered in water to plump up. I've deglazed the pan as directed and found it a bit lacking, so the next time tried using the apricot simmering liquid which was a huge improvement. All in all a great recipe.

I made this, with a few changes, for a dinner party and got rave reviews. I butterflied the roast and stuffed, rolled and tied it. Also had to use dried apricots, but I plumped them with some white wine, and had to add a bit of chicken stock to the stuffing. On a whim, I used the Blood Orange Roast Pork Loin recipe on this website to cook and sauce the roast, and it was fabulous! Serve it with Peas with Roast Onion and Mint, Pear Salad with Feta, Hazelnuts, etc., both also from this website, and roasted fingerling potatoes. Truly a wonderful meal.

Rating: 4
OUTSTANDING!!! Only variations I had to make were to use dried apricots as fresh were not in season and I toasted the bread cubes until VERY crusty then balanced them with a bit of chicken stock to maintain moisture. Only pork roast I had was butterflied so I spread the 'stuffing' evenly over it before rolling up and tying into a roll, but this worked well! This will be one of my 'meant to impress' recipes - tastes complicated but is relatively easy to prepare.

It's funny, because I was reading over the reviews and found myself surprised by how many people made modifications in this dish, and then I found myself doing the same thing. I brined the pork and then butterflied it so that I could get more stuffing in there. Also, apricots are out of season right now, so I used dried ones and soaked the in brandy first. Then I used someone else's suggestion and used 2 pieces of bacon on the ends to give the roast a nice flavor. I also delglazed the pan with whitewine because it just didn't make sense to use water. Overall, it was a vry good dish. My boyfriend liked it a lot.

This is awesome. I have also used apples instead of the apricots to rave reviews. I also roast some if the baby crab apples along side and it makes for nice presentation. For the sauce, I also add a small amount of dijon mustard, white wine and finish with a touch of cream to really make it sing. It is simple, easy and impressive!!

Outstanding recipe, I made it for Mother's Day and got excellent reviews. Couldn't find nice sweet apricots, so I added 8oz of apricot preserves and it came out delicious. Very easy to make, definately cook to 150 F. It was DELICIOUS. Everyone thought I was a Great Chef!

Really good. Really pretty. We added dried cranberries and that was yummy. I was excited to try this recipe and I think I was slightly let down... Too generic. Too vanilla. Suits the everyman taste for a pork roast. I guess we just like more of a wow factor. I think I would make again as pork chops with the stuffing as a separate dish. That would be a little less labor intensive and so it would probably be more enjoyable.

Excellent recipe. I made it this summer with fresh apricots from our apricot tree. It was delicious and quite easy to make.

I made this roast for Boxing Day for 25 guests. Everyone - and I include the teenagers - loved it. I served it with a potato gratin and brocolli/spinach puree. I have since made it again for a different group of people, once again to raves.

Enjoyed this entree for Christmas dinner. In preparation, after reading all of the reviews, I brined a boneless loin roast (using Chef Judy Rogers' formula) for 24 hours to ensure moist meat. Used dried apricots and bing cherries reconstituted for stuffing and added chick. broth for moisture. Tied roast for better shape, coated with olive oil; left off salt and pepper because of brining. Browned in iron skillet then placed in roasting pan on bed of garlic cloves chopped onion and carrots. Roasted to 155-160 degrees, 40 mins.; perfectly moist, slightly pinky, slices looked beautiful. No drippings to speak of so poured chick. broth and wine into pan, reduced, then strained off veggies. Added butter, flour and Dijon and Whole Grain Dijon mustards for a sauce to serve on the side. Negative: mediterranian dried apricots not flavorful enough; will use California fresh or dry next time. Verdict: All hands called enthusiastically for seconds. Served with a California coastal pinot noir - perfect.

I've made this dish for several dinner parties and it always gets raves. It looks stunning and tastes delicious.

I followed recipe exactly without substitutions. Stuffing roast was difficult, messy, time consuming. Not worth the effort. (What drippings? There was nothing to deglaze!) I would try this stuffing in thick pork chops (for ease in stuffing) instead of a roast, adding sage and saute the bread in butter to toast it instead of baking the bread.

This recipe is great. My husband is not a fan of pork roast, but really loved this. It turned out moist and very flavorful. Will make again & again. Very easy to prepare.

Very easy to prepare. My supermarket didn't have fresh apricots (this was in October), so I purchased dried apricots & reconstitued them. I moistened the dressing with chicken broth prior to stuffing the roast. Like another reader, I used Golden Delicious apples instead of shallots. Probably should have sauteed them first -- but the roast came out succulent & with a good flavor. Love the apricot/apple flavoring along with the pork!

I would make this again with the condition that it gets pulled from the oven when it's at 150 F internally and that a separate sauce be made beyond the scant quantity of pan drippings. Not bad, but far too easy to overcook with the instructions as listed.

I would like to give this three and one half forks. I was making it for two, so I used a 2lb roast. Based on previous reviews I made the full amount of stuffing. I butterflied the roast to hold the additional stuffing. I tied it well and had no problems. I used dried apricots which I had soaked for a while. I also added a little chicken broth to the stuffing mixture as we like a moist stuffing. I deglazed the pan with white wine. Served it with roasted root vegetables. Easy and delicious.

Very easy to prepare, however, the shallots gave out a very strong odor and I had to keep this in a cooler on my deck because it permeated the house. I was worried it would over power the roast but instead it was delicious and was the best roast stuffing we have ever had. I doubled the receipe and I also used an all natural apricot preserve. I changed nothing else and it was great.

The pork was very juicy and tender. I was unable to find a large enough tenderloin so I used a rib roast and it came out beautifully. The stuffing was REALLY delicious and everyone who tried it was asking for this recipe.

I had problems finding fresh apricots, so used an all-natural, no sugar added preserve. It did the trick perfectly. The preserve gave the stuffing and meat a nice moisture. Great for dinner parties, since you can prepare, throw in the oven and chat with guests.

more butter and bread for the stuffing. overall, yum yum!

I made this after a friend gave me the recipe. Delicious. I belong to a an organic food co-op and this week they gave me apricots. I found a good use for them. Side Note: Lehigh Valley Chef; Stick to reviewing recipes, not reviews. I don't care what you think unless it relates to the recipes on the site.

My mother doesn't eat beef, and rarely eats pork, but after she tasted the stuffing she couldn't resist and ate it with a slice of the pork. We were all surprised! Count on it taking more than 50 mins to cook.

Really good. I didn't have any apricots, either fresh or dried, but I did happen to have some sour cherries in the freezer, so used them, instead. The sour cherries added a very nice tart/sweet flavour. Also, I deglazed with white wine. Served it with roasted carrots & yams, and horseradish mashed potatoes. WIll make this again.

FABULOUS! I've made it twice to rave reviews. STUFFING: I sub granny smith apples for apricots, add about 1/4 teaspoon sage as suggested below; also noticed stuffing is bit dry - I add a bit of more butter and some chicken broth. DON'T overcook the pork (I remove at 150F and tent with foil. This is now my standard dinner party roast - its awesome. Have served with overroasted carrots (and parsnips) and either the potato gratin suggest below or mashed potatoes: both great!

I love when folks like the person from Palm Desert write a review...of a recipe they didn't prepare! I mangle Epicurious recipes all the time, especially when I don't have all of the ingredients. However you can't really write in and then review something that you've completely altered.

Next time I would definitely use dried apricots. But to the cook who said that apricots were bland -- are you using the Turkish kind or the California kind? That is a big difference. Dried California apricots are extremely sharp in flavor. That's what I would use here. I also threw in some dried cherries. My only complaint with the stuffing was it was too bready. I'd shift the balance to the fruit next time.

After reading all the reviews, I made the following changes: Used boneless pork loin chops(that's what I had on hand), used dried apricots,used purchased cheese and garlic croutons, added more butter to crouton mixture and some fresh chopped sage. Stuffed the chops and melted apricot preserves with white wine and basted chops on the grill. They were still BLAND!! I think it's the apricot that's the culprit...just too flavorless. Very disappointing.

I've made this three times and it was great each time. THe tangy flavor of the apricots balances well with the pork. Very easy and very tasty.

I too used tenderloins of pork instead of a roast. This method can be accomplished by butterflying two tenderloins of equal size, stuffing cut, and then quick tying the tenderloins together. Be sure to get tie it tight enough to keep the filling in, but not too tight as to squeeze everything out. I added cherries to the stuffing...adding nice colour and flavour. I would have liked for the apricot flavour to come out more...perhaps add jam next time.

Great recipe. I made a small mistake before preparing the recipe I assumed I had a pork roast in the fridge. I found out while starting to prepare the meat, that I had pork tenderloin. I butterflied each tenderloin layed the stuffing down the middle and tied them with string to hold together through the cooking. This was so good and cooked very quickly.

I really like stuffing so I widened the recommended slit area and, believe it or not, doubled the stuffing recipe. I used metal spoons to help me pack the stuffing in the loin. Working the stuffing area open with my hands helped a lot. The recipe did not take me long, presented beuatifully, and my husband gave me rave taste reviews :)

Rating: 3
The stuffing was great, but not before I added more butter (about 4T extra), a little water, and some dried sage. There was no need to brown the pork in a pan first. I just put it in a hot oven for ten minutes, then turned the heat down a bit. The deglazed pan juices are okay, but nothing to croon about. It's important not to overcook the pork, which gets leaner and more easily dried out every day! I took it out at 155, which was perfect.

We had a large group for dinner so I used a 6 pound loin. It was very well received. There really wasn't much sauce in the end but the pork was juicy and flavorful. I would have liked a bit more flavor in the stuffing which I felt was a little bland.

I was not thrilled with this. It got a rating of "it was different" from my family. The stuffing came out soggy. I used wine instead of water, but I still wasn't thrilled with the sauce that resulted. It was the first time I tried a stuffed pork and the results just were not worth the effort.

Absolutly delicious! As another person noted about the step of deglazing-instead of only using water,I used half water and half sherry. It made a very rich tasting broth to serve over the pork roast.

This is a truly delicious dish especially for those of us who love "agri-doux". I would suggest deglazing the roasting pan with a dry white wine rather than water.
