this is a perfect Bechamel sauce recipe. the proportions are perfect. if you are adding Gruyere cheese and white wine, then you are not looking for a Bechamel sauce! don't change the structure of a classic!!!

This is a good basic recipe, but two small tweaks make it superb. First, use shallots rather than onions in the same or a touch more measurement, and second, add a small amount - perhaps less than 1 cup - of grated Gruyere cheese to actually make it taste like something, unless what you're pairing it with already has a strong flavor. The earlier tip about adding white wine is also a must. If you add the gruyere, perhaps add a bit more milk or wine to keep the consistancy smooth.

This was a good, basic bechamel sauce recipe- I used it in a fish pie and it came out great. The only modifications I made were to reduce the amount of flour and to add a good splash of white wine. This REALLY makes a difference in the flavor.

I actually made a combination of this bechamel and the Fanny Farmer recipe. I put minced onion, peppercorns, and herbs into the milk, and warmed the milk before adding it to the roux (I strained the herbs etc. out of the milk first). It took way less than 45 mins--I'd say around 15. And it was fantastic!! Good to have a recipe for such a staple. I poured it over layers of sliced chicken breast and broccoli, both cooked. Put parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs on top, and baked at 350 for fifty minutes or so. My boyfriend and his step-father both had seconds, and I was getting compliments for hours! Ate the rest for lunch today with a carrot salad. . .delish.
