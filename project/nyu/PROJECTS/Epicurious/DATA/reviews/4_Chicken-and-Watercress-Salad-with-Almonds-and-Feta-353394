Amazing and easy. Great salad for company. Very filling.

The combination of quick and simple preparation and good flavor made this worthy of 4 forks. I brought to a pot-luck dinner party, keeping the dressing and chicken separate until placed out for consumption. Toasted the almonds (a MUST) while I chopped shallots and mixed dressing and sliced apricots. The whole assembly must have taken all of 15 minutes. I used baby arugula as I prefer that, and the breast meat from a store-bought rotisserie chicken. I used a grapeseed and almond oil combo, and golden balsamic. I did actually use a splash or two extra of the balsamic because I tasted the dressing and just adjusted to my taste.

Fantastic!

This was delicious! I bought some ingredients at Whole Food's (rotisserie chicken, peaches) and the others at Trader Joe's (grapeseed oil, white balsamic vinegar, light feta, arugula.) I had to substitute arugula for the watercress and the peaches for the apricots due to lack of availability in the Nashville area. I also left out the Shallots out of a mixture of laziness and the dread of post-shallot dressing breath. I have never had a grapeseed oil and white balsamic dressing and it was DELICIOUS. So easy and so amazing! Really, really good recipe. Good for a quick lunch during the work break or dinner for company.

Made this last night using mixed greens and rotisserie chicken. It is a wonderful Summer salad and my family enjoyed it tremendously! Served with crusty whole grain rolls, it was restaurant worthy.

This was a big hit. The grapeseed oil and white balsamic are a great combination. I substituted dried apricots - can't wait to try it with fresh!

I substituted goat cheese for feta, walnut oil for grapeseed oil and peaches for apricots. It was absolutely delicious. I'll try the original recipe next week.

I have left-oven roasted chicken and thought this salad would be great until I looked at the fat content. I'm supposed to aim for 30 gr a day and this recipe would use up my entire allowance.

Ho-hum. Nothing special

I made this for a work pot luck, and it was a hit! The watercress is a little hard to eat - I served it with mixed greens. It would be worth getting the white balsamic vinegar for aesthetics. Goat cheese would be good in place feta.

The shallot-and-oil dressing really makes this salad. It's delicious and so simple to prepare. I used baby greens that I had on hand in place of the watercress, and the dish was still tasty. Great summer meal!

Kind of perfect. Yum.

Easy and yummy. Only needed 2 large bunches. I halved the apricots, then sliced them so that they weren't such big bites.

This was a wonderful salad. I found the salad dressing (using only grapeseed oil) to be a little to mild in flavor so I added a bit of mustard to add some flavor and emulsify the oil and vinegar. Overall it's a great summer salad.

I had never had white balsamic vinegar or grapeseed oil, and the two flavors together are divine - a very delicate flavor! And then combined with the apricots, feta, and almonds - my husband and I both loved it! The recipe as written was a little too high-fat for us, however, so I did make a couple of adjustments - I used 4T oil (instead of the 6 total here), and consequently reduced vinegar to only 1/8c. It wasn't really quite enough dressing that way, however, at least for the amount of greens I used - a bit less greens and I think it would have been fine. I also reduced the feta to 1/2c. Even with those adjustments it was a little high-fat, but do-able (~30g fat per serving, nearly 1/2 daily RDA). I did not have time to toast the almonds, but it still tasted great. The store had no watercress so I used arugula - I really look forward to trying it with watercress - I imagine the flavors really come together that way!

Satisfying and a nice presentation. I will make this the next time I need to take a salad to a gathering. Used one bunch of watercress and 2/3rds bag of mixed salad greens. I think all watercress would have been too spicy for my audience. I used an entire store bought baked chicken rather than just the breasts. Pleased with the outcome.

Delicious chicken salad. Made it with walnut oil,used 2 peaches (peeled) and 2 apricots and some leftover grilled chicken. Very tasty.

Fantastic, easy weekday recipe or luncheon recipe. I bought pre- grilled boneless chicken breasts, although you could grill up some with a touch of olive oil, lemon, and salt & pepper. The combo of the apricots and the feta was great in tandem with the tangy watercress. Regarding the shallots, I used one about the size of a walnut, but it depends on how oniony you want it. (I have to go easy on the onion since my husband doesn't like strong onion flavor or texture.) Forgot to put the almonds on and it was still good, although I won't forget next time. I was a bit unsure how much watercress 3 large bunches is. I used one bag--the bag in which the watercress is still attached to its roots--and I probably could have used another bag-ful.

How many or much shallot(s) are used?
