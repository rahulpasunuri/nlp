I added onions and the comment at dinner from one of the boys was "mad good" :) It's a keeper!

I made this tonight with roasted garlic (about 7 cloves) with 3lbs of white potatoes, cut in wedges. I tossed in (along with original ingredients) some white wine vinager (1tsp), 1/2 a chopped onion, 4 pats of butter on top, (fat is flovor!) some (sprinkle) montreal steak seasoning, a bit of sugar (why not?!), some kosher salt, fresh pepper, and chopped parsley. I cooked it about 10-15 minutes longer then stated, because I like mine nice and crisp, (all at 500 degrees) turning the potatoes every 10 minutes or so. It was amazing!!!! crunchy, carmelized onions on the outside, soft "mashed potatoes" on the inside, I made enough for some leftovers, but I have picked and picked and this wont make it past breakfast tomorrow morning! Would make a GREAT breakfast potatoe!

The perfect recipe for classic roasted potatoes. They came out crispy on the outside, soft and mealy on the inside. I wouldn't change a thing.

Well tonight I decided to make chicken cacciatore and I needed something to accompany it and I wanted it easy. This dish is the epitome of easy and delicous. Definately going in the recipe box. Wonderful.

A nice roasted potatoe, but nothing spectacular. Good flavor from the garlic.

As much as we do love garlic, my family prefers this without garlic.

Easy and delicious. Make sure you serve potatoes immediately after cooking as I like them a little crunchy and the more they sit and cool the more softer they get.

It doesn't get any easier than this! I used potatoes, onion, garlic and peppers out of my garden, also store bought baby carrots. Threw everything in a large ziplock bag to make sure everything was evenly coated. There were no leftovers.Great with glazed grilled salmon.

This recipe was very easy and great. I made it for a dinner party and was able to put them in the oven and forgot about it till they were done. Will definitly make again!

I added a little more oil than the recipe called for and I'm glad I did. It would have been a sticky mess otherwise. I also topped it with rosemary and it was wonderful. Will definitely make this again.

I made this recipe to serve as a side dish to a prime rib roast. I minced the garlic instead of slicing it and added salt and pepper. I added some peeled boiler onions about 1/2 way through the cooking time. I cooked it at 500 until I added the onions. It was getting pretty smoky in my oven, so I turned it down to 450. Very tasty and easy.

I whipped up a version of this recipe for a medieval times project for my English class. My buddy and I added a lot more garlic, used butter instead of olive oil and sprinkled a little parsley on the top. It was incredibly delicious!

These were simple to make and would compliment any dish with which you would have potato. I served them with "Garlic Orange Pork Chops". As suggested by others, you can pretty well throw in any other vegetable you like with the potatoes. As a friend of mine likes to say, "It ain't rocket science."

I would also add onions to the recipe. It would add flavor and would be rather delicious. I make potatoes, onions with olive oil often so I know adding onions to this recipe would be the thing to do.

Sprinkle fresh rosemary on top for an even better version of these potatoes.

I added baby carrots and onions and the results were great. The only problem was I didn't double the recipe.

It is always good to review a delicious basic dish. Dependable also describes it! Could cut-up onions and carrots also be added and cooked at the same time? Thank you for including so many simple, yet very good recipes!!
