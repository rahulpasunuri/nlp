The salad is nothing special, however the roasted tomatoes are FANTASTIC (especially when you use a good salt -- I used a blend of smoked & spicy salt).

Very simple and a perfect side dish with anything from steak to fish.

This was good but not overly exciting. The dressing is odd as the ratio of oil to juice makes it very acidic. The normal ratio is 4 parts oil to 1 part lemon juice/vinegar, but this one seems to be the reverse. I like the orange flavours, but I did change the dressing by adding more oil as it was too liquid and acidic.

YUM. Now that I have that out of the way.... I didn't let my tomatoes cool completely before serving. It made for an exceptionally tasty, unique salad. I liked it a lot. I must say I would probably serve this in a separate dish because the dressing is runny (I might also divide it up and toss the salad greens in it first). Loved the tomato-green bean-citrus contrasts!

When the tomatoes came out of the oven... I began to doubt how good this would taste. However, I think it was the roasted tomatoes that I ended up liking the best. Very enjoyable! I made the dressing just as instructed but like other reviewers I added some balsamic vinegar to see if that was good... it was and I will make this salad again.

Due to complaints of too much orange, I left out the orange zest. The results were good, although the orange was still very obvious. All in all, I thought it was a good recipe without the orange zest.

This was really lovely. The orange in the dressing was sublime with the roasted tomatoes. The presentation was really pretty. This would be a nice starter for almost any meal.

Granted I am nto a huge tomato fan, so that biases my opinion, but neither me nor my boyfriend liked this salad. Not only was it not that quick, but the flavors did not meld together well and I found the mixture of textures to be off-putting.

I used the dressing suggested by a prior review: 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar - very good but I also added lemon juice and dijon to the finished dressing - outstanding! I finished the tomatoes under the broiler sprinkled with the dressing - wow! I had a very happy wife on my hands...

This had a lovely presentation as well as being very yummy. I made the recipe as is and it turned out wonderful. This is a great salad in summer paired with BBQ chicken or BBQ meat. Easy and tasty what else could you ask for!

This salad was a big hit, and it was 10 times more delicious the next day - much more flavorful. I bought the oven roasted tomatoes at Whole Foods (which was a great time saver!) and stuck pretty much to the dressing recipe, except that I added a lot of balsamic vinegar.

Easy to prepare, pretty presentation and yummy. What more could you ask for? I confess I did use the dressing recipe everyone was raving about with the brown sugar and it was excellent. I also wanted to make it more of a meal so I added zucchini, candied pecans and surrounded the salad with a hard boiled egg. Perfect for a summer meal! VERY easy and versatile salad.

DELICIOUS!! I used the dressing suggestion made by the man from Ca.with balsamic, olive oil, brn sugar and dried basil. I also added 1/2tsp lemon zest and dijon mustard following his prep. instructions. It was absolutely 4 star restaurant quality. I also used more lettuce than called for because the dressing is so good you will want something to mop it up with. The roasted tomatoes and green beans not only made for a lovely presentation but created a sophisticated but not fussy flavor combo.

Made it with just-picked tomatoes and beans, and used the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar alternate dressing but added some fresh basil too. Arranged for a picnic with the greens on the bottom, tomatoes and beans over those, and decorated with a few basil leaves before sloshing the dressing over all. A hit!

I thought the dressing overwhelmed the flavors of the beans and roasted tomatoes. Prefer good quality olive oil, squeeze of lemon and salt/pepper.

I followed the advice of others and cut down on the OJ, added balsamic vinagrette, and was generous with the dijon mustard. I've never roasted tomatoes for a salad before, but this was a HUGE hit with us - really great for bringing out the taste. I definitely recommend this one.

Made this last Aug. and it was excellent! Roasting the tomatoes is a great new twist for a salad. Made this dinner at a friend's who was just moving into her new place along with Orange-Dijon Pork Loin, Rosemary Lemon Orzo Pilaf and an Herb & Onion Focaccia...... All worked well together and well received! KIMBER

A nice summer recipe! I quadrupled it (thanks, MD, for the idea) and arranged the beans and tomatoes over the greens in a shallow pan for easy self-serving at a picnic -- it got rave reviews. Although the dressing was nice and light, it did lack a bit of oomph so I added more mustard and lemon, salt and pepper... next time I'll try the balsamic vinaigrette suggested by the LA, CA cook below (thanks for sharing!).

Pairing roasted tomatoes and green beans is a great idea! The whole recipe (with the exception of the dressing)was quick and easy. I wasn't too thrilled with all the orange juice and orange zest so I used my own dressing of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, brown sugar dried sweet basil. I put it in a small sauce pan in equal parts, bring to a boil, add the brown sugar and boil for 40-50 seconds. You can serve the dressing warm or cold.

delish, always add salt to tomatoes. It brings out the essence of the fruit out so nicely. I just love a roasted tomatoe, any day!

Interesting combo, and fairly good fresh, but the dressing doesn't have much kick. Don't bother saving any leftovers - the beans can't hold up until he next day.

I quadrupled this recipe and served it on a large platter for a cookout. It was huge and there was nothing left! I took another cooks advice and avoided too much orange flavor by eliminating the orange zest. The tomatoes and green beans must be cooled before assembling the salad or it will be completely wilted before it gets to the table.

Wonderful salad! I loved the dressing: so light, yet flavorful. Couldn't ask for a better salad recipe: easy, delicious, and beautiful.

This dish was easy and looked great on the table. I will make it again, but will maybe add some salt or vinegar to the dressing-it wasn't exactly too sweet, maybe just too orangey.

I liked the ingredients, and the salad was pretty, but I did not think the dressing did it's job in pulling the ingredients together. SO liked the bright flavors, though, and it was lofat. I would salt the tomatoes.

This was a simple and delicious recipe. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and slightly reduced the amount of orange juice. It presents beautifully and would make a lovely salad for Christmas dinner.

I liked this recipe because not only did it make a nice tasting salad, it was simple and quick to make (the time it takes for the tomatoes to roast allows for time to work on other things). Next time I make it I would use less orange juice. I thought it was a bit too sweet.
