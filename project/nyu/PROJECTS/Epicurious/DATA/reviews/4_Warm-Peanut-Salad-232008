I second the non-peeling remark. I've made this a few times, and I don't think leaving the peels on affects the flavor or texture, so maybe it's just the way Padma Lakshmi remembers the dish being served. Just shell them and relax. We served them on bright, fresh banana leaves, and it was a hit.

I've had peanut salad a few times in South Asia and most times the peanuts were unskinned, and after what seemed like hours of and hours of peeling, I understood why. I'd definitely reccommend this, but unless you're unemployed, extremely bored and not planning on getting hungry until next week I suggest you stick with shelled and skinned nuts. Oh, and in my opinion it tastes better after a day in the fridge.
