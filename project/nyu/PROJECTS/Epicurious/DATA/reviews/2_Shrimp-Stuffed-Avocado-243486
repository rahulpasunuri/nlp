Mediocre recipe. I was expecting a bit more from it. It was nice in the sense that it is basically a shrimp and melon salad. I thinly sliced the avocado and put the "stuffing" overtop that. It probably could do with half the mayo and half the sour cream. I served this with the recommended Cotes de Provence - Rose and it was brutally terrible. If you want to match a wine with it, try a Kabinett Riesling. It works very well.

I can't say what the recipe was like, because there is no information of the ingredients, just a one-liner saying "the lime juice keeps the avacado from discolouring" ... that's it.
