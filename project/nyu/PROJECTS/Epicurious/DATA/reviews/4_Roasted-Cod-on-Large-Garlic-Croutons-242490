I used more of the vegetables, as one review suggested, used yellow onions instead of red, olives instead of anchovies. Cooked it on top of the stove. Added spinach near the end as another review suggested. The spinach turned it from very good to DELICIOUS. Cod itself is boooooring - this recipe is ALL about the sauce, and the sauce is a winner!

Wow! this will be a go-to. For a Gluten Free guest served it on mashed potatoes instead of the crouton.

Absolutely delicious! Tweak a little every time I make it... Kalamata olives instead of anchovies, sun-dried tomatoes in addition to fresh, Rosemary Sourdough... always tasty!

Good fish bruschetta. I would think that the quality of the bread is key. I added sun dried tomatoes - very nice. Will make again.

Very easy and delicious. The filets baked in the exact time prescribed. I subbed capers for anchovies and I roasted the brushetta topping in the oven as advised by prior reviewers. I am low carb so I put the filets on a bed of dressed wild arugula. Very easy and very elegant.

Love this recipe and it works well as a base recipe. I have made it exactly as is and was so impressed. This time I didn't have enough tomato but I had 4oz. of assorted gourmet mushrooms so, I sauteed them together with the tomatoes. I also didn't have anchovies so, I used some capers and, I added some additional fresh herbs (savory and lemon thyme) along with basil. It was fantastic

I am on Weight Watchers so I lightened this up a little: used spray instead of olive oil for the tomato saute and did not put on toast. Also it is winter and I did not have fresh basil or great tomatoes...used dried oregano and canned good quality plum tomatoes - stil tasted great!

Excellent for week nights. Served it with more veggies. The garlic is the secret in this recipe, taste awesome.

Loved this-didn't have basil, so substituted arugula tossed with olive oil, lemon and parmesean. served extra on the side. Husband said serve it to guests!

This was really lovely, though unfortunately I didn't have very good bread, and it didn't hold up to the weight of the fish! Make sure you use a really hearty, thick-sliced bread, or it'll get soggy and flat like mine did. Otherwise, delicious.

Great dish, very easy to make. Assembly takes a little time and care, , but worth it! Great WOW factor from your guests. I had our fishmonger cut the halibut in advance for me, this helped when it came to serving. I think that 8oz is a bit too much fish, I would definitely serve more towards the 6-7oz size next time. As suggested by previous reviewers, I roasted the tomato mixture for 1 hour at 350. I did exclude the anchovys and added capers and olives after the roasting. I used onion ciabatta bread and it was delicious...I toasted it in the toaster, as both my ovens were in use, actually turned out better than had I done it in the oven. I served it with roasted cauliflower which I found on epicurious (another huge hit with my guests) and a mixed green salad with a light vinegrette dressing. YUMMY!!!

A quick note -- I imagine roasting the tomatoes makes a drier "sauce" than stovetop. Found that my toasts held up a little too well to the sauce to yield to a fork and knife, so I just picked them up. Still delicious!

This got the "restaurant worthy" approval from my husband, so it's definitely a keeper. Had the time so followed the slow-roast advice for the tomato/onion/garlic mix, but did them at 300 for 1 hr to speed things up. "Toasted" the slices of bread in the oven for about 20 mins while the tomatoes cooked. No cod in the market so I used haddock and it was very good. 8+ mins @ 475 was perfect. Finished with a squeeze of lemon and served with sauteed broccoli rabe. Looking forward to leftovers!

Just finished this. Sauteed tilapia on one side, then after I flipped the filets I poured on the tomato mixture and simmered for a few minutes. Broiled the rosemary boule bread and poured mixture on top. Didn't have basil, but dotted the top with pesto. Sweetheart loved it, so did I.

Addendum: If you use anchovies, there is definitely no need for capers or olives. There is a ton of flavor already! And there is definitely no need to roast the tomato/garlic/onion mixture. Why waste the energy? Top of the stove is perfect, for about 5 minutes for the sauce.

This is delicious! I used yellow onion instead of red, because that's what I had. This is quick and easy. I used my homemade French Bread, which I halved and quartered for the two of us. Only caution: layer the bread, sauce and fish just prior to serving, or the bread will get soggy. This recipe is dfinitely a keeper! Loved it!

I loved this. Simple, flavorful and healthy. Like other reviewers, I roasted the tomatoes, onions and garlic in the oven for about 1.5 hrs at 250F. Next day I heated up the tomato mixture with some chopped Kalamata olives (in lieu of anchovies). Absolutely delicious! I also doubled the tomato mixture which ended up being perfect for us. Next time, I will probably use a thicker slice of bread and drizzle a bit of olive oil on the crouton as well.

This was Great!!! As suggested by others, I slow roasted the tomatoes and garlic - added capers in the last 1/2 hr(I did this last night). When it was time to serve, I reheated in a saute pan and added some rinsed baby spinach to the mix and tossed until wilted. Served on top of roasted scrod. No toast or basil. Easy weeknight meal. Will be adding to our regular rotation.

excellent! given how simple the ingredients were i wasn't convinced it would be so delicious. it was a huge hit--and the presentation was lovely. since i didn't have time to follow the other reviewer's suggestion and cook the tomatoes garlic & onion for two hours beforehand, i just placed them in the pan and let them cook as the oven preheated. this worked perfectly. deelish!

This was a wonderful new way to serve white fish. The flavors in the tomato mixture were fantastic with the garlic toast... I am assuming a four fork if you used fresh ingredients because I actually used a can of diced tomatoes and simmered like the other reviewers suggested, adding mushrooms and spinach. Plus it was so easy! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

Like a number of the other reviewers I chose to slow roast the tomato mixture and then add chopped olives and capers. I used Nicoise olives. It added excellent flavor. For the bread I used slices of olive bread I'd baked several days earlier with a fig and olive tapenade spread lightly over the bread. For bedding I used spinach, didn't have any fresh basil. It was superb. My wife raved over it. we will definitely make this again.

Took the advice in previous reviews and slow-roasted the tomato, onion, garlic mixture with olive oil for 2 hours, then added sliced olives, capers and anchovies for the last half-hour. Came out wonderfully! I could eat just that on toast and be happy. It was a perfect accompaniment to the cod. Made this for Christmas Eve and it disappeared. Even the kids liked it.

Fabulous! Used the suggestion of slow roasting the tomatoes, onion, and garlic and the taste was sublime. My family said it tasted like something in a restaurant ... which was so funny given that has been stated in many of the reviews. Hint on the anchovy: anchovy paste is less expensive and 1/2 tsp = 2 fillets. Did add 2 tsp of capers to the tomato-onion-garlic (last 1/2 hr of slow roast). Served with lemony mushroom risotto (from this site) and simple steamed asparagus.

I made this, but I don't like really "fishy" fish, so I used orange roughy instead. I didn't know if that might make it bland, but it turned out great! The other ingredients had enough flavor to accent the mild fish.

Super quick & easy recipe. We didn't have anchovy or capers or olives and the sauce still turned out quite pleasant. Can't wait to try it with. also subbed baby spinache for the basil leaves. I could see how you could spin this quite a few different ways with different greens etc - great all around recipe for your little black book!

This dish was great! I prepared this for dinner on Christmas eve, and it tasted like something out of a high end restaurant. I couldn't find fresh anchovies at my grocer, so I used canned anchovies (will try with fresh anchovies next time) and substituted Halibut instead of cod. Will definitely try again :)

Rating: 4
I used tilapia because there was no cod at my grocery store and prepared this recipe exactly as directed and it was DELICIOUS. Seriously tastes like something out of a restaurant. I will make again and again. P.S. I made sure to season the sauce and fish with salt and pepper to taste, which I usually forget to do. I think that did the trick!

This is a great recipe, as good as anything that you get in a high quality restaurant. I make it just as described, except I use store bought croutons. You won't be sorry with this one.

Great recipe. Did not cook the sauce (salsa) but let macerate at room temp for a while. Used only half as much garlic as raw garlic can be too strong. Same reason only used three anchovies. Left tomatoes in coarse chop. Toasted thickly sliced ciabatti bread on grill. Easy but delicious. Good dinner party recipe as only last minute prep is roasting fish

Very tasty, especially for the relative ease of preparation.

The only thing I did different was to change the method of cooking the tomato sauce. From experience, I knew that slow roasting the tomatoes would bring out the maxium flavor, so I roasted the tomatoes, onion and garlic in some of the olive oil at 250 degrees for 2 hours. I then added the anchovies, some sliced black olives, capers and white wine, and baked for 30 minutes more. The flavors were AMAZING. If I'm ever short on time, I'll use the quick saute method, but the slow roasting brings out the sweetness and the intensity of the tomatoes so much, that I'll probably continue to do it that way.

This recipe is simple and very delicious. I used capers instead of anchovy fillets and that worked well. I was lucky to find some very tasty fresh Alaskan halibut. It's the perfect recipe for this time of year when fresh ingredients are readily available from local growers.

THis is good, but not great. Very light and easy, but a little bland we thought.

This is easy to make and quite tastey. I used 1 can tomatoes instead of fresh so, needed to simmer it a it longer but, it was fine. I also used all the sauce for two six oz servings of fish.
