These cookies are absolutely divine. I sliced 1/8" (or thinner -- really as thin as humanly possible; the thicker ones are just not as good (though they are still tasty)) thin slices off the chilled log, as stated in the recipe, and that worked beautifully.

These were delicious. I rolled them out to about 1/8" thickness, cut shapes, and baked on parchment paper. They were easy to roll as long as the dough doesn't get too warm. They were buttery and crisp. The recipe says to cut up to 3/4" thick, which I think must be a misprint since the description says "thin and crisp."
