I make this dish often. It is quick, easy, and just delicious. I usually use whole wheat pasta. I add white wine after the onions/garlic and reduce a bit, and sometimes throw in a dash of crushed red pepper. The raisins make the dish (regular raisins work fine too if you don't have golden raisins handy) as do good quality tuna, flavorful extra virgin olive oil, and fresh parsley.

This was a real winner in our house, even with the 2 and 4 year olds! I highly recommend adding black olives to the mix, and also used white wine instead of pasta water.

As for my family, this is not repeatable. We love fish but, this is just to bland. I tried some of the suggested add-ins, but it still is just OK.

Really good but I made some changes: I added sun dried tomatoes and a little basil pesto. very fresh and delicious.

Very good. But I used less oil and also did add a splash of lemon juice and some lemon zest. Enjoyed by all.

I was a bit hesitant to make this because of the raisins...but they were actually a great addition. Added a bit of white wine and sundried tomatoes as other reviewers suggested. Also added fresh chopped basil as I only had a little bit of parsley.And used less oil than called for. It was SO easy to make.Especially for that reason, i would make again.

Quite tasty, and very easy to make. I made this on the fly so I substituted broiled bluefish I had made over the weekend using another delicious epi recipe : http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Broiled-Bluefish-Fillets-with-Fennel-Mayonnaise-14237 I also added some sun-dried tomatoes, and like a previous reviewer subbed in 1/2 a cup of white wine for some of the pasta water. While most of the changes I made were due to availability of ingredients and/or personal taste, I do recommend one change to the recipe. I suggest you do not add the parsley until the end, when you mix the pasta and the sauce together -- off heat.

BA 7.94 had a recipe for ZIti with tuna, capers and raisins~ it had several more ingredients than this one and was truly a tasty Tuscan treat.

This recipe is great! Easy, healthy, and quick, we loved it. I added more capers than called for and would suggest about 1/2 cup capers.

This has become a mainstay for me - I make it at least once a week. Simple and delicious. The taste to ease ratio is very high.

Fairly bland. Ok for a quick, cheap dinner but nothing special.

Unusual, easy to make but excellent. I loved the tuna/sweet/briney/herb flavors together. Will definitely make again

I saw this recipe on Alexis Stewarts blog and thought it would be a great, quick dinner. It is!!! The changes I made....fresh onions, not frozen,dark raisins -I was out of golden, I splashed in some white wine in place of the pasta water. The second time I made it, I used leftover grilled tuna steak that I flaked apart....I love this recipe.

What a surprise! I was desperate to make something for dinner/lunches, I had minimal food in the house and wasn't feeling very motivated to go out to the store or spend money. So I was browsing the recipes section for something with canned tuna and was actually suprised I found any recipes at all. I took a look at this recipe and I happened to have all the ingredients on hand so I thought I would give it a try. Despite being a little concerned about the combination of flavours, I was impressed with the end result. I used organic whole wheat rotini instead of linguini as that was what I had on hand, but I think that only added more depth to the flavour. And I used a fresh onion (not sure what the deal was with the frozen onions...aside from convenience, but seriously how long does it take to chop an onion?). I couldn't believe how well these flavours blended. I loved the bursts of sweet raisins in one bite and salty capers in the next, all in a "creamy" tuna "sauce". I probably won't make this one on a regular basis, but I'll definitely keep this in my collection for something different once in a while.

I made this because, however dubious I was about the flavor combination, I was desperate and this recipe matched what I had in the pantry. My husband and I were quite surprised at how good it was. Good for a quick, thrown-together weeknight meal.

This is definitely good, interesting, different and easy. More like 2.5 forks. But there are so many other great pasta recipes out there, both tried and untried, that I doubt I'll make this again.

Fabulous - and so quick! The only thing that was missing from the recipe was parsley (which I didn't have on hand) but I surely did not miss it.

Just wonderful. Didn't change a thing.

I loved this. It came out deliciously creamy--a big surprise since there isn't any cheese or cream in it. And the flavors of the tuna, capers and raisins balanced each other perfectly. A great replacement for our usual weeknight linguine with canned clam sauce.

Great flavor for a simple, fast combination of mostly pantry ingredients. Adding this one to my "quick, what's for dinner" recipe list.

Very good and easy! Make sure not to use chunk tuna as it makes the recipe pasty. I used 1/2 lb whole wheat pasta, doubled the parsely, and water packed tuna. It was delicious, especially served over mixed salad greens. Black raisins add a more colorful presentation. Also, 2 medium fresh onions work very well in place of frozen.

It was a wonderful recipe that did not take very long to put together. It was a favorite with my husband. We used wheat noodles and the taste was wonderful.

Good for Grandkids and that's it.

have a problem with this thing called "frozen chopped onions"... I thought we were doing pretty much "fresh" cooking...why all of a sudden are we using frozen onions?

An easy, delicious, unusual and resilient recipe: I reached for raisins and by mistake added currants instead; it came out just fine nevertheless. A tablespoon of lemon juice at the end, as suggested by an earlier reviewer, adds a nice little zap.

This unlikely combination was delicious and simple, and I had all the ingredients on hand. The sweet-savory contrast is typical of many Sicilian dishes.

Delicious, and so very quick and easy. I added a TBS of lemon juice and zest of 1/2 lemon at the end to zip it up a bit, but it would be fine as printed.

Delicious combination of ingredients! I'd add more capers next time.
