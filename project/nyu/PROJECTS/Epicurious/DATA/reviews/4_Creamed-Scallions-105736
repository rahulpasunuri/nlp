I have never met an Edna Lewis recipe that I did not like... simple, elegant and authentic. Well worth the time and effort. We shall miss her.

Surprisingly delicious and easy. Only difficulty was in determining when the cream was reduced enough; mine was a little runny on the plate. Might be a "4 forker" if I can get the perfect creamy consistency. Will try again and plan to have as a side dish for Thanksgiving dinner.
