Mmmm, this turkey is REALLY REALLY good. It is so tender in the inside, and the gravy is heaven. I can't tell you how much I love this turkey and I will use it again this Sat. :P

This recipe is a standard way to make a turkey, although i have never kneaded flour and butter together to make a rub. The idea of basting a bird with anything with water in it isnt a very good idea. use a pastry brush to baste the bird and use clarified butter or an oil that can withold the temps. for the experienced, try deboning the the turkeys legs and then truss them. notice that the legs are always the longest part of the bird to cook, so by deboning the legs you cut down on cooking time.therefore you have juicy breast.

Not too fond of Fried Turkey for Thanksgiving. I stole the giblet cream gravy idea and used that instead with a molasses brined turkey- much better and more "southern" for my tastes...

The turkey was moist and tasty, but didn't stand out. the gravy, though, was a huge hit.

Too lemony! And that's after I only used about 3/4 of a lemon. I didn't follow the recipe's cooking instructions or the gravy... too weird with the egg. The stuffing was too dry and very time consuming to make. Not worth it and there are many superior turkey recipes to be found.

Excellent recipe: the meat came out tender and moist and the stuffing added terrific flavor. I was worried about the skin as it looked a bit too golden right from the beginning. This being my first turkey, I was very nervous yet received raving reviews.

I was really disappointed with the skin of the turkey. It came out of the oven with a golden-burnt crust of flour and butter, I thought this might add to the flavour, but it tasted really floury, most of my guests picked it off the skin. The dressing was fantastic, although the chunks of bread were a little large.

My family used this recipie at Thanksgiving this year. We decided that we'd make it again next year. I did want to point out that, if you use this recipie, the turkey will come out of the oven looking a little bit like fried chicken (due to the butter and flour paste you rub onto the turkey before roasting it). I was a bit surprised when I saw it, but I wouldn't have been if I had looked at the picture on-line first. I looked at the picture afterward and it was a nice affirmation that I hadn't done something wrong. Enjoy. PS: We made an Onion Tart (using an Epicurious recipie) to accompany the turkey. It was very, very good. I recommend you find the recipie and give it a try.

I partly followed this recipe and I also used some of my own tried and true ideas, and the result was the best turkey I ever made! First, I used a regular frozen turkey that I had defrosted. Then, I used the kosher salt and pepper as directed. I used an 11.5 lb. turkey. I stuffed it with my own stuffing recipe. I then rubbed the butter and flower paste all over the outside. It turns out I had alot of extra butter, so I melted that and continued to baste the turkey with it until I ran out of it. Then I used the pan drippings to baste. Also, I added two large onions quartered to the roasting pan. (This will make the gravy nice and brown, I also basted them with butter). Started in the oven for 30 mins. at 450, then turned down to 325 for the remaining time, which wound up being about 5 hours! All I can say is it turned out wonderfully with a rich dark brown skin. I kept basting every 30 mins. Really beautiful! Then I made the gravy using the blackened onions. I skimmed off fat in roasting pan, then added more flower, made a roux, cooked that for a minute or two with onions still in pan, and then added turkey broth gradually and kept whisking until smooth and strained in sieve over med. flame. Salt and pepper, delish! I'm not called the gravy queen in my family for nothing!

Would this recipe work with cornbread?

I agree with the above comment about the turkey and I also don't understand why you would not want to stuff the turkey with the dressing. Isn't that the whole idea.

Either I can't read very well, but couldn't find any reference to country sausage in the dressing. As I was looking for a sausage dressing I checked out this recipe. Something is wrong with this picture. Whoops, guess if I had clicked on the Country Sausage recipe, I would have found it! Looks good but don't understand why it wouldn'tbe good inside the bird.
