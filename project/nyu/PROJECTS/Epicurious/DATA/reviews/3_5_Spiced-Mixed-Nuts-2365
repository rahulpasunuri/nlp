This was OK. Definitely needed the ginger. I followed the instructions and in the end, added a little more sugar. Not sure what is missing, but the tastes seemed to flatten, not flatter each other.

I make these all the time for holiday presents for co-workers. I make them with recipe as shown but use only pecans, as they stand up best. I have people ask me for the recipe all the time. They have always been a hit. Adjust the cayenne for heat tolerance. They will last quite a while in airtight containers. Heat them a bit in the microwave before serving!

This recipe is always a hit. People like to munch on them out of the bowl for appetizers and I also like to serve them in salads. I make it with pecans and butter instead of vegetable oil. I was worried about the butter burning in the oven but it roasts the nuts nicely and adds a good flavor.

A staple for parties and holiday time - the sweet and salty makes these so addictive. Definitely takes longer in my oven; 25 minutes at least.

Made for holiday gift giving. Used almonds and cashews and peanuts. US-style chili powder doesn't exist in Kenya yet, so skipped that and increased the cayenne pepper moderately. Tasted good, but looked sort of nuclear with all that red from the pepper.

I made two batches. The cooking time depends on the type of nuts. The first time I needed to cook the nuts close to 30 minutes, the second time they were burning at 20 minutes. Results were okay but I've had better.

These are so addictive - get devoured every time we make them! They take a lot longer to crisp up in the oven, though, I think - at least 25-30 minutes.

Simple recipe with good results. Unlike other recipes, they didn't turn out too oily. I also added garlic and onion powders as well as a little cumin. The end result was added to a modified Chex mix with small bacon pieces, Cheese Nips and Pinahs rye chips.

I made these with the recommended amount of oil and they came out tasty but quite oily! Next time I will try it with the water instead.

Quick, easy, and yummy! I doubled the recipe, varied the spices a bit (added clove, cumin, and five spice powder), and added a touch more sugar.

Keeps beautifully in the freezer (to have on hand for salads). I do with just pecans for this purpose.

I just made 6 batches of these to give for Christmas. I used the oil method, added garlic powder and a little curry powder. The house smells great, and I plan to make more in the next few days to package up and give.

I made it with water in stead of oil. I liked the crunchy coating they came out with. I used 1/2 tsp cayenne, and would have liked a little more heat. other than that, I thought they were very good. I liked the idea of using onion or garlic salt in place of regular salt. will try that next time. "sugared spiced nuts" on this website is excellent also.

Very quick, very easy...just be careful you turn the nuts regularly while they're in the oven and only bake for the recommended time. These burn in a heartbeat! (with the water substituted for the oil)

The nuts were very good. I made them on a Saturday to be eaten on Thursday and they tasted as good or better after sitting for a while. I used peanuts, pecans and walnuts. The peanuts were good mixed with the other nuts but I wouldn't use them alone. They didn't soak up the oil and spices like the other nuts did. Maybe because I used dry roasted unsalted peanuts rather than ones right out the shell. Very good!

I make these all the time to have out in a dish and every time they come out a little different. I've tried other's suggestions of replacing water for the oil, and it also makes a great result, although I was a little worried when doing it, as it seemed the nuts would turn soggy. But they didn't. The difference was that it turned out more like a glaze, whereas the oil makes for more of a coating. I think they're equally good, depending on what you are expecting. Playing with the proportions of spices is definitely fun, and most likely will always be successful.

This recipe is a must! However, I agree with NYC about NOT using the oil & substituting it with the 1 to 1 water/sugar mixture. I used cayenne since I didn't have any chipotle & used garlic salt instead of regular salt. Also added 2 Tbsp. worchestire sauce & 1/4 tsp. cumin. Got raves from everyone & they all begged for the recipe! Will definitely make again!

Yum Yum!!! Love these nuts. They are addictive! I didn't heat the oil and added an extra tablespoon of sugar. (I used brown sugar. I also just used pecans.) Go make these!

This recipe is a good base, but I made some additions to zing it up. DO NOT use ANY oil- nuts have enough of their own oils. Instead, use a 1 to 1 water/sugar syrup (about 1/4 cup of each is plenty). This will give the nuts a crispy crunch when they're dried to room temperature!!! I agree w/ previous cook's comment...substitute cayenne with chipolte. It's hard to find but well worth it! I encourage you to add 1.5 teaspoons of 5-spice...it balances the peppery spice and leaves a nice finish. Bake at 350 for 15 minutes turning 1-2 times.

I usually make these with peanuts, almonds and cashews. I increase the sugar a little bit for more of a contrast in flavors. The heat can be easily adjusted depending on the crowd and they always turn out great!

This is an awesome recipe. I use only pecans. I chop them up and put them in a salad with pears, blue cheese with a light dressing. They have just the right amount of hotness to spice any salad nicely.

Fantastic! Always a hit when entertaining. I usually make a double batch because we seem to eat them all before I can serve them. Have made a few revisions: delete chili powder, add 2 tbsp worcestershire sauce, fresh snipped rosemary, fresh snipped thyme, fresh ground pepper. Mix all ingredients in a bowl, then add nuts and gently mix - I don't bother to heat the oil first. I prefer to use a mixture of pecans, walnuts, whole unblanched almonds and for a deluxe mix I add macadamia nuts. Everyone raves about these nuts and I often give them as Christmas gifts. The previous reviewer was correct - they are highly addictive and almost impossible to stop at just a few. Mmmmm, think I will whip up a batch right now! Enjoy!

These are very easy, and my guests were fighting over the bowl. The nuts aren't sweet, despite the sugar. I used almonds, pecans and walnuts. Be warned, these are highly addictive.
