I love hake and I used this recipe for inspiration. Here's my preparation: For stock: Combine 1 1/2 cups vegetable stock with onion, garlic and parsley and simmer uncovered until reduced by about 1/3. Strain, discarding vegetables and reserving stock. For Hake: Heat a large skillet to medium high. Add 2 TBSP butter and 1 TSP extra virgin olive oil. Saute hake on non-skin side until browned (about 5 minutes). Turn over and saute on skin side for another 5 minutes. Transfer to warm serving dish and cover. To pan add 2 chopped shallots and saute for 2 minutes. Add 2 TBSP of chopped fresh parsley, 1 TBSP chopped fresh rosemary, 1/2 TBSP chopped fresh tarragon and reserved stock. Saute briefly to deglaze pan and further reduce sauce. Pour over fish fillets and sprinkle with additional 1 TBSP parsley. This was very tasty.
