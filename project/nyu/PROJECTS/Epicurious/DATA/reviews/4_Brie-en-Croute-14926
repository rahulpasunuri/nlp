This was quite easy to prepare, having that last chill time makes it perfect for a first course, pop it in the oven as cocktails draw to a close! I didn't make the dressing, I used a good quality raspberry walnut vinaigrette, I found the sweetness better complimented the brie. I also used a premixed spring greens and fresh herb blend. Looked fancy, but not a great deal of effort for the reward! If you don't want to use a muffin tin, this also works with a larger circle (6 inch) of puff paste, folded over the brie turnover style

This makes for a tasty dish that presents well. Difficult to go wrong.

This was very easy to make but nonetheless impressed my guests. The only problem that I had - some of the cheese bubbled out of the pastry and burned in the oven.

I substituted some toasted, buttered pecans for the chutney, and used a purchased honey / pear vinaigrette with the mesclun salad with sliced pears. The brie en croute was delicious with the salad.

This is an awesome salad/appetizer and much easier to prepare than I had expected. I prepared and filled the puff pastry cups early in the day and refrigerated until that evening. They held up very well. To save time, I used a prepared specialty salad dressing which was a bit sweeter than the recipe provided. It worked well with the brie. My guests were impressed.

Very impressive looking and not difficult to do. I only had phylo dough, so I brushed each layer very lightly with butter and proceeded with the recipe and it turned out fine. I wasn't so crazy about the dressing. I may experiment with other flavors, perhaps something sweeter to go with the brie. I might try a honey dijon dressing or a raspberry vinaigrette.

How can you go wrong. However! USE HONEY BUTTER as a base and serve with Champange. You will become a semi celebrity. Serve an arugula salad on the side if desired. Y U M.

Simple and elegant. Perfect as an appetizer or salad course, or as a light summer dinner. The vinegrette is great!

It really was delicious and elegant without being too fussy. Make sure the lid is sealed well - I had to sop up the spilled brie.

Wow. This was incredible. Not as much work as I thought it would be, either. The people I served it to were reverently silent! It was great preceeding pork tenderloin.
