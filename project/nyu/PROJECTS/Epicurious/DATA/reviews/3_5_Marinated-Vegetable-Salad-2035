Made a huge amount of this for a cookout and was left with a huge amount. Just two substitutions: used blanched green beans and cauliflower instead of broccoli since we had another broccoli salad, and homemade dressing instead of store-bought. It was just bland, even with extra parmesan and plenty of time to marinate. Might try again with balsamic, as other reviewers suggested, but was basically a disappointment.

We blanced a number of veggies quickly in boiling water, including broccoli, carrots and snap peas. Added sweet onions as recommended and used 1 cup extra virgin olive oil, half cup white balsamic vinegar plus a few tablespoons of French mustard from the jar. Was amazing!!

I'm a slow food fan, so I substituted triple quantities of fresh herbs for the dried, and homemade Italian dressing, and found this salad almost too mild; the taste and crunch of the fresh veggies (I substituted cauliflower and green beans for the broccoli) carried the dish and it's going into our rotation. I'm still looking for just the right dressing...

I made this for the third time tonight, and again it was excellent, even though I only had time to refrigerate it for about 2 hours. As usual I used defrosted G/G broccoli cuts instead of fresh, and 1/2 Paul Newman Light Balsamic Vinaigrette and 1/2 red wine vinaigrette for the dressing. But this time I added enough cooked small shell pasta (3-1/2 oz. dry weight per 2 servings) that it qualified as a starch/veggie side dish that could go it alone with BBQ'd chicken thighs ("Grilled Chicken Thighs Tandoori" from "allrecipes.com"). Delicious meal, and an especially tasty side dish.

Beautiful, flavorful salad. This recipe makes A LOT of salad, so be sure that you have a large bowl to mix it in. I used Asiago cheese and substituted sweet onion for a milder onion flavor. I also used quite a bit more parsley than called for. I added garbanzo beans, which went really well with the flavors of the salad, to make this a vegetarian main dish.

I divided all the ingredients in this recipe by 4 to make 2 servings. It was delicious, but my smaller version made more like 4 servings. Next time I would make it like I did the first time, but add pasta and shrimp (as reviewers have suggested), and serve it as a main course. Otherwise, for a side dish, I would divide my 1/4 recipe in 1/2 (meaning divide the original recipe by 8 to make 2 servings). DELICIOUS, though.

This was very good and refreshing! Although, I have to admit that i changed it quite a bit. I used only the vegetables and herbs that I had in my garden...cucumbers, green peppers, tomatoes, basil and oregano. I also took the advice of others and used the balsamic dressing. Very Nice!

Found this dish a bit boring. A lot of work for very little flavor.

I have made this a couple of times most recently for a party of 10 women! They loved it and raved about it. I added 8 oz. of bowtie pasta and used bottled balsamic vinaigrette w/herbs, etc. It really was good. The balsamic flavor made it special. I used the 'zesty' when I've done the Italian dressing also great.

For something so simple, this recipe is great! It is perfect for feeding the crowd. If you want something a little different, fancy it up by adding medium shrimp.
