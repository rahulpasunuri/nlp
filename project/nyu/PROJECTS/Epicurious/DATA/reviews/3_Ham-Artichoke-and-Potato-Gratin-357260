Great recipe for leftover ham. I made some changes based on other reviews. Used red potatoes instead of russets. Sliced potatoes thinly with mandolin and parboiled. Chopped ham into bite size chunks. Mixed fresh thyme into finished leeks. Used canned artichokes and Jarlsberg cheese because that's what I had on hand. Baked covered for 45 min then uncovered for only 20-30 minutes until top was browned. Yumm!

i made this gratin and it's true: it looks awful--an unappetizing grey. it also never congealed so it came out soupy. it was a total dud. it was so bad that the dog wouldn't even lick the plate. . .

This was very disappointing - especially since it contained all my favorite ingredients. It was really unappealling visually and was not outstanding taste wise. I almost never say this about an Epicurious recipe, but I won't make this again.

really good! don't skip the wine-it really makes the dish. i'm hoping to run across some comte cheese so i can try this recipe as written. i used a four-cheese blend from a bag (gasp!) and it was still really good. i cut the potatoes with a mandoline slicer to 1/8" and then roughly chopped them to speed up the cooking process. i also sauteed the potatoes for a few minutes before assembling the gratin. i think i ended up cooking for 45 minutes with the foil on, and then another 15 uncovered. perfect. will definitely make again.

This is a great casserole our whole family loved it. I did use canned artichokes instead of frozen.

I and my guests absolutely loved this casserole. It was rich and creamy and savory, everything one expects in a casserole. With the exception of the artichokes, I made this entire dish with essentially leftovers. I was fortunate enough to have my own stock and a glorious ham that I had baked for a weekend brunch party. I used a waxy potato since that was what I had on hand. Given the cost of an excellent comte, and its relatively small flavor contribution, I substituted a pre-shredded swiss cheese, and didn't find anything lacking with the dish.

This was one of the worst recipes I've made from epicurious. I followed the recipe exactly, and found the result unattractive, sloppy to serve, and terribly salty. We always eat leftovers but we did not eat this.

Very tasty dish for a winter night. I roughly halved the amounts, using about 8 oz ham and 1 can (13.5 oz) artichoke hearts, drained (like everyone else, I couldn't find frozen). I also used Yukon Gold potatoes instead of russets. The casserole didn't look very appealing when I took the tin foil off halfway through the cooking, but no matter - it ended up browning nicely. Next time, I will reduce the salt a little bit and add more pepper, or even a dahs of cayenne.

This dish makes a lot and is good for feeding a crowd - I had four teenage boys staying for the weekend and this was a big hit. Next time I would reduce the amount of potatoes as it took much longer to cook than expected. I used canned artichokes because I could not find frozen - next time I will try with marinated artichokes for more flavor. I also used black forest ham as that was what I had on hand - gave it nice smoky flavor but made the dish very salty. Will try again with regular ham and reduced salt chicken stock. Nice alternative to a strata or pasta casserole for a crowd.

The only change I made to this recipe was to use canned artichokes instead of frozen. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as it's written and it turned out beautifully. It was absolutely delicious! My entire family loved it and they all look forward to having it again. The only changes I would make would be to halve the potato slices and cut up the ham slices into bitesized pieces to make serving and eating it easier.

I wouldn't make this again. By the time the potatoes were tender, the dish was overdone. The color of the dish was unattractive.

I halved this recipe for 4 people, (except for the sauce and cheese)and it was very good, albeit with the following changes: I used 12 oz of artichoke hearts, but would use more next time. I used a ham slice, which I diced into 1/4" cubes. I used a combination of Gruyere and Jarlsberg, since I had no Comte. I will next time cube or shred the potatoes, and mix everything together, rather than layering. I added a grating of fresh nutmeg to the sauce. Very nice meal!
