I am going to try this with a cornmeal crust. Goes with Santa Fe.

Made this for lunch for friends. I used homemade dough with cumin seeds and, as suggested by another reviewer, spread guacamole on the dough before putting on the salsa. Delicious! We'll definitely do it again,

A tasty way to use leftover chicken. If you have the time, make your own dough

As good as everyone says! And a quick weeknight dish.

Great pizza! I made 2 alterations. I used refrigerated pizza dough instead of Boboli, which, I think even the thin crust is too thick. I spread 2/3 cup of salsa over the pizza crust and after all the topping sprinkled another 2/3 cup of salsa over the top. All in all a hardy pizza.

I enjoyed this pizza! I used frozen bread dough for the pizza crust (much tastier than Boboli) and made fresh salsa (I used three roma tomatoes, two serrano chilis, a thick slice of yellow onion and a small clove of garlic. Put all ingredients in a small skillet over high heat and blacken the skins, turning occasionally. Takes about 5 minutes. Then put everything in a blender with a couple tablespoons of water, 1/4 tsp of salt and 1/8 tsp chicken boullion. Blend well and voila--you have a delicious fresh authentic salsa.) That makes a spicy salsa, so I didn't put any sliced jalepeno on top. I also used a little nonfat plain yogurt at the table and it tasted wonderful! Next time I'll use 3 or 4 tablespoons of black beans too.

I have made this a few times and love it. It is so easy and a nice switch from regular pizza.

This recipe is really a jumping off point - you can add other veggies and vary the cheese. I grilled my chicken with a cumin/chipotle rub, added onion, green peppers, garlic, black olives and subbed pepper jack cheese. Mostly because those were things I had on hand. I used the Pillsbury pizza dough. The salsa-as-sauce was great. Good reviews from my husband, too!

I've been making this pizza often the past 4 years since first reading it in Bon Appetit in 2001. I usually use homemade dough instead of the Boboli. It's a fantastic combination of flavors and a nice spin on the usual pizza.

This is a great recipe to start with if you love to ad lib in the kitchen. I put On The Border salsa down first, then arranged slices of grilled chicken in concentric circles and grated extra sharp cheddar with a flat hand grater right over the pizza - less dishes to wash. Had canned corn onhand, not frozen. Turned out great. For the future, I'll know that salsa makes a great pizza sauce, and you can add just about any southwest ingredients you like - avocado comes to mind...mmmmm!

I used taco sauce as a base for this pizza. I also put out small bowls of sour cream, guacamole and salsa to top each piece. Other than that I didn't change anything and my husband and I really liked the result. It was a nice change from the standard meat/tomato sauce/cheese pizza.

Tasty! Someone suggested avocado, andI couldn't find any ripe ones, so I spread some guacamole as a "sauce" before adding the other ingredients. Would definitely make it again.

Very tasty, will add to my pizza recipe collection. It was a good use for leftover chicken that we had smoked using our new smoker. Used fresh (store bought)dough. Also used leftover corn cut from the cob. Creative use for leftovers!

Excellent! I made this for Saturday lunch for company and they raved. It was tough to gate the cheddar cheese, so I'm trying shredded cheddar/Jack mixture next time - I also used a Boboli crust. Really easy, fun and flavorful!

Fairly easy, and pretty good. We reduced the amount of cilantro to 2 T. Boboli crust is a good substitute for pizza crust.

Tasty treat. Add artichoke hearts and cook the chicken with mesquite seasoning, or smoke it with mesquite chips. Avocado & olives also a must.

This was a wonderful pizza! I used a homemade crust (half wholewheat flour -- great!), grilled chicken breast, and lot of cheese. The salsa is important to the pizza as it has no sauce--it needs it in order not to be dry. A unique take on pizza...and so tasty... :)

From a gourmand in Vancouver, Canada Excellent recipe; but there is room for improvement. Marinate chicken breast in lime juice, garlic and Tequila for 2 hours first, then grill. Homemade salsa and sour cream a must, too.

Made this recipe (sans chicken) for a dinner party. It turned out wonderfully -- no leftovers!

I, unfortunatly, was not as impressed with this pizza as everyone else. I just put the salsa on the table for people to add on top of their piece rather than spreading it all over the pizza. Maybe that was the downfall. The pizza seemed kinda dry. The sour cream saved it by adding a bit of moisture.

Fabuloso!! We made a home made crust and home made salsa, looked in the fridge, and voila!! Shrimp!! So we took the frame work, and holy shellfish Batman! This was grrrreat!! Sour cream, avacado, and lotsa jalepenos! Even the corn wasn't wierd!

I served this for the first time at a recipe exchange party I was hosting. This recipe was the most requested one due to the delicious and savory flavor and it was fairly simple to make.

This was great! I also made fresh dough and put a thin layer of drained salsa over the dough (like you would pizza sauce) and then the toppings. Yum!! Excellent w/a little sour cream on top.

My husband loved this pizza. It's a good twist from the norm. We went with prepared-roasted chicken and it was very simple to put together. Can't go wrong with this one.

I have made this several times - the flavors are great! We use sour cream and jalepeno hot sauce for condiments.

Loved this! We made our own crust, rather thin and reminded my guests of great CPK. Even though I followed the recipe almost exactly, I am sure that it would be great with substitutions. I used a think and chunky store-bought salsa, didn't drain it, and didn't find it too wet.

I really liked this recipe and I agree with the cook from Arlington - there are endless variations that could be tried. I used a Boboli-brand thin pizza crust. And I heated the salsa so it wouldn't cool the pizza. It's a keeper.

Can anyone recommend a good store-bought brand of pizza dough?

I can't wait to make this again and again. Each time a little differently because there are endless posibilities. (Add black beans, olives, peppers, tomatoes, substitute shrimp, etc.) I even want to host a build your own pizza party based on this pizza!

Yuck! No way Jose', for me anyway. Storebought crust was awful. Toppings didn't come together. Chicken became bland and rubbery. The corn was mushy. The cheese did't melt well. I tried adding salsa and avocado afterwards, but they cooled down the pizza so fast, they made it even worse. Sorry amigos.

This received major kudos at a party, with none leftover. Delicious. I think it's important to use fresh salsa (available in my store in the refrigerated section) and then put it in a colander to drain, so that it doesn't make the pizza soggy.
