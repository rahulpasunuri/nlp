I have been making these cookies for years. I do as follows, I added a little less flour than called for. Used Grade A maple syrup with a splash of maple extract. I roll out the dough after chilling overnight and use a large maple leaf shape. This makes about 25 cookies with a few smaller shapes left over. I use the back of my knife for a vein design and brush the top with egg white and sprinkle with maple sugar before baking. They come out a little chewy this way, which I like.

Fantastic cookies - I added half a teaspoon of freshly ground cardamom seeds to the flour. The dough is very easy to work with, but can be soft and sticky it not properly chilled - make sure to chill thoroughly (I'd go more than the 2 hours specified - more like 3-4). I rolled mine out on a silicone mat, and while it is nonstick, they did stick slightly. Make sure to flour the surface and rolling pin well and flip the dough once or twice as you roll it to make sure it is not stuck to avoid the cookies sticking and getting misshapen. Plus, I'd roll the dough in quarters not halves of the entire amount, and refrigerate the cookies on the sheets for a few minutes before baking - this ensures they keep their shape much better. Lovely subtle flavor of maple syrup (used Grade B imported from the US). I still have half the dough wrapped up in the fridge, and considering making a maple syrup glaze for it as a few reviewers mentioned. Definitely recommended.

I really hate to be a downer, but I do not like these at all. I could hardly taste any flavour other than flour; it was not nearly as buttery or mapley as I hoped it would be. Changing the recipe is a disaster as well, as it's always either too dry or too moist and it never tastes any better. Trouble is, my boyfriend loved them somehow, so he keeps asking me to make them even though I can't stand them. Blah.

Exceptional cookies. I added about 2 tbsp maple syrup flakes just because I had them. Very delicious. Will definitely be making these again.

We made these with young children as a quick drop cookie. No chilling, no rolling, no cutting. Adding butterscotch chips gave it a little extra something for those with a big sweet-tooth! Yum-Yum!

Good cookies. mine turned out crispie though not chewy. I had some maple butter in the fridge so I soften it in the microwave, spread them on the cookie and stuck another cookie on top to make a sandwich cookie.

GREAT cookie recipe. This was a huge hit Thanksgiving weekend, and I've already had requests for Christmas. Made the recipe exactly as indicated. I refrigerated the dough for several days, let it come to nearly room temperature and it rolled out beautifully for cut- out cookies. I made them on the thick side and took them out of the oven while still a little soft. They held the cut out shape very well (turkeys!) and even the detailing I put on them by drawing with a toothpick before baking. They stayed moist and chewy for days. And they smell heavenly! I'm making them again for Christmas (Xmas trees) and will make one change - I'll add a bit more maple syrup and a dash more maple extract for a more intense maple flavor. No icing is needed!

Great recipe and loved by all who've tasted them so far. I will make these often. I glazed the last batch with a thin mix of maple syrup and confectionary sugar. Yum.

These are great! We brought home maple syrup from a recent trip to Wisconsin and was looking for a great recipe to share with neighbors. I did as others noted, chilled dough in a log and sliced to bake. I also substituted 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white and used kosher salt 1 1/2 tsp. Big hit I will have to make them often.

This was pretty nice but not as maple-y as I'd hoped. Like other reviewers, I initially cooked them as the recipe stated, and they came out rock hard and not at all good. I reduced the temperature slightly and the cooking time to 10 minutes and they were much better! I think they'd really benefit from a nice maple pouring glaze!

Just made these for 2010 Olympic party in Vancouver. They are fabulous, and I baked on parchment paper,no problem. The secret is always beat sugar and butter,till really creamy and then add other ingredients. They kept there shape and taste amazing!

I can't stop making these subtle, buttery, mapley cookies--the cold dough alone is enough to send me. I've made these about six times now and have adapted slightly to this perfect (in my book) result: " As others have noted, it's much easier to roll the chilled dough into a log and slice. When I rolled the cookies, they turned out denser and too hard. The sliced ones stay lighter. " I bake at 350 for only about 8 minutes--they do caramelize quickly, and the slightly quicker and cooler bake leaves the edges crisp and the center just slightly tender. " I subsitute half the white flour with whole-wheat pastry flour. Imparts a nice subtle nuttiness but stays light. " Here are my favorite discoveries: for the sugar, I use half brown sugar and half unrefined sugar (such as Sugar in the Raw)--the brown sugar makes it caramelly, and the raw sugar crystals remain intact, sweet little crunches. " Best of all: I use coarse sea salt instead of standard table salt, and I use about half a teaspoon extra. The effect is divinelittle subtle crunches of saltiness that dissolve on the tongue and perfectly complement the caramel flavors in the cookie. My favorites cookies to make now, and a huge hit with everyone who tries them.

I made these cookies for a county fair and won a blue ribbon for them. I was wary of using maple extract, but added 3 drops. To my surprise, it didn't taste artificial or phony. Ultimately, I upped the quantity of maple extract to a scant 1/4 teaspoon because I was looking for a robust maple flavor, and I was VERY pleased with the taste results. Even though the judges loved the testure of these cookies, I thought they were a bit odd. They weren't really crisp like a ginger snap, yet they weren't cakey like a shortbread. They were right in the middle, which made for a somewhat odd texture in my opinion.

Awesome cookies! The dough is a dream to roll and cut out, and they bake up to the perfect texture. I made a glaze of maple syrup and powdered sugar, which was perfect. Took them to a work cookie social, and they were everyone's favorite!

My family comes from a long line of maple-syrup purveyors from Vermont, so I found this recipe to be exceptional using the standard maple syrup that I get from home. Consider adding some pecan meal in place of about 1/3 of the flour, and I used a glaze made of maple syrup, a touch of vanilla, and powdered sugar. Excellent!

I'm French Canadian, so anything maple is a passion. These are incredible and will make your kitchen smell like heaven. I used parchment paper with no problems. The cookies were tasty and beautiful.

Best cut-outs I've ever made. I frosted the first batch, not the 2nd batch and preferred them w/ no frosting - too good on their own. They brown VERY easily, which is also what gives them a very caramel, not maple, taste after baking. I may follow what another cook said and try them w/ sugar-free syrup. I used a maple leaf cut out and just took an extra minute and "drew" a stem pattern on the cookies before baking. Made them look more special w/ no frosting. Addictive....

I used a sugarfree maple syrup by Maple Grove Farms (great flavor and consistency) and the cookies did not brown too rapidly, tasted great. I also made an icing with the one suggested for the pecan maple cookies at this site: 1 c powdered sugar, 1/4 butter, 2tbls milk, and 1 tsp extract. I toasted walnuts, finely chopped, and then sprinkled them on after icing the cookie. It will almost be like a clear glaze. These had rave reviews when all was said and done. They were so pretty too.

My husband pronounced these the best sugar cookies ever. They were super easy too. I made this as writen, with Grade B and no extract. But I did follow advice and roll them in a log for easy slicing, line the cookie sheet with foil, and plant a pecan on top of half the batch. ALL the cookies were awesome. Tasty dunked in coffee or by themselves.

I just made a double batch of these for a ladies' club meeting. I used a maple leaf cutter and painted the cookies with dappled autumn colors. The ladies raved about them! Not just that they were delicious, but so beautiful as well. Using the leaf-shaped cutter on rolled dough took WAY longer than I wanted to spend. Next time I make these, I'll roll the dough into a log and cut slices to bake. Also, I had to roll the dough thinner than 1/8 inch for good results. 1/8" came out of the oven as oddly shaped blobs. But I will definitely add these to my repertoire.

I've made this recipe many times now, and I can never get it to come out quite the same way. I prefer to catch them just a little under cooked so that they're nice and chewy. A nice touch is to place a shelled walnut on each cookie before baking. And a note: don't use parchment paper, it makes them turn out really strange.

Ah, wonderful cookies with a spectacular crispness. I didn't have maple sugar, so I used 2/3 C regular sugar and 1/3 C brown sugar and it worked perfectly. Also, I lined a baking sheet with tinfoil instead of buttering it and the cookies slid right off.

If you like thin, crispy, crunchy cookies, suitable for dunking, these are for you. I did not use the maple flavoring, but in addition to the maple syrup, I substituted 1/4 cup of the sugar called for with maple sugar. Like a previous reviewer, I formed the dough into logs, then sliced and baked. I also thinly coated the tops of half the batch with maple sugar, and left the rest plain. I got about 85 cookies out of the recipe, and they disappeared in two days when I brought them into the office. For the reviewer who found them salty, I wonder if you used salted butter by mistake?

These are great! I made half the batch a wee bit underbaked, and sprinkled with golden sugar. They were like soft, wonderful, maple-tinged sugar cookies, fabulous with tea. The other half was baked a little more firm, then coated in a maple glaze. Tooth-achingly good. I brought some into work a couple of hours ago, and now have an empty tin sitting in front of me. As I've just passed out 5 copies of this recipes, I expect to see some more glowing good reviews up here soon.

These are scrumptious! Wonderful flavor, and very easy to make. I used Grade B syrup and a few drops of maple flavoring. Delicious plain, and with a light icing of powdered sugar and maple syrup. The maple is such a nice change of pace from the usual cookie flavors.

I frequently try several new cookie recipes and mail cookie care packages to friends around the country. Some of my friends have tried almost a dozen kinds now and this is by far their favorite - they ask for me to make and send more! If you have natural maple flavoring (*not* artifical junk), and add a few drops it doesn't matter what kind of grade maple syrup you choose. Definitely brush them over with a coat or two of very thin maple frosting -- powdered sugar, maple syrup, maple extract, and a touch of water. They're *amazing.*

These came out beautiful and delicious. Need to roll them really thin for best results. Great served with a homemade butter pecan ice cream..

These are my all-time favorite cookie. My preference, for convenience, is to roll the dough into a log, wrap it in saran, and keep it in the frig till ready to use. Then just slice and bake. I put half a pecan on top of each cookie round - the pecan and maple flavors together are perfect! And although Trader Joe's carries a good flavorful B Grade maple syrup, I always add two to three drops (no more!) of maple flavor to the dough. Love these cookies!

I'm sorry to disagree with everybody. I followed the recipe step by step and these cookies tasted salty. No way I'll make them again.

In my first attempt I carved the leaf veins with a knift and sprinkled large sugar crystals on the leaves. I also divided the dough into three parts, coloring each section with either crimson red, buttercup yellow, or true orange. I blended colors, and kept others pure. In the end, the leaves looked elegant and festive. The second time around, I piped the veins on the cookies with a tan icing. Festive and fun. (My 2-year-old helped!) The turning-leaf colors really make a wonderful presentation. As for the taste, to me they taste like butter cookies. The maple syrup is hardly noticable. Next time, I am going to add maple extract to see what that does.

Absolutely fabulous cookies. I used grade A maple syrup and did not need to add the maple extract. I can't stop getting calls for the recipe. It's a winner!!!

Got lots of wonderful compliments on these cookies. Loved the maple aroma when baking these. Will be making these again.

Found the sweetness was just right, as with other raters, they are definitely addictive. I rolled the dough out thinner and enjoyed the cookies crispier (trust me-only about 25 cookies were left in 2days out of a total of 70 cookies) I also agree to make plenty if one plans to share. Next time, I will add more maple extract for flavouring. Considering I have almost no cookies left, will be making again soon!

I used a bit less flour than the recipe called for, and made sure to chill the cut out cookies on the cookie sheets before baking. They came out perfect. True, the maple flavor is subtle, but I don't like using artificial flavoring, so I made a glaze of 10x sugar and maple syrup, which was great. Caution: these cookies are addictive. If you are making them for other people, don't even try one, you'll eat more of them than you'll have left to give away. Yum Yum Yum.

At first I thought they were going to turn out terrible. I had a tough time with the dough, it was crumbly. I tried the best I could to make a cookie out of that dough. I am glad I did, after the cookies sat for a day, they were delicious! Next time, maybe I will use a little less flour.

I was a little disappointed with these cookies at first because they were like sugar cookies without the sugar, but then I frosted them with a mixture of confectioner's sugar, water, and maple extract, and they became fabulous cookies! Everyone commented on how delicious they were. Try them!
