I am also Persian and I agree with some other commenters. This is not real aash-e reshte. I had not made aash-e reshte myself previously but had eaten lots of it, and this was a disappointment. First of all we don't use fava beans. Secondly the "greens" are not right at all... I believe I used kale as I had a lot of it to use up from a veggie basket, but as we do not traditionally use kale it was very strange. Although I have used yogourt in soup, I think a lot of Iranians would agree that kashk is incomparably better. My understanding from another recipe I have seen is that the "greens" are just cilantro and parsley. There is a recipe for "Aash-e shole ghalamkar" on this site (I think it's called Persian herbs and pulses or something like that) which is actually really good.

I wasn't a huge fan of the soup. The flavors didn't meld, and it felt like a mixing of a bunch of different things in the pantry.

just thought i would post as a reply to momthebom. i am also persian and i am also from tehran. i agree that i've never heard of this as a traditional new year dish, if anything it's a traditional "chicken soup" for when you're sick or when it's chilly out. the fava bean comment is correct, and there are other quibbles we could make too, like how it calls for yogurt instead of "kashk" (iranian yogurt whey). on the other hand i don't think this is a bad recipe and i'm not sure why it gets one star. it looks pretty accurate to me, as much as something like "chicken soup" can have an accurate recipe. one of my grandmothers makes this with pomegranate juice, another one makes it with preserved lemon, my mother makes it another way and my friends and their families have their own variations. this is a fine recipe. besides, it's pretty hard to find fava beans.

Had this at a party recently and it was fantastic. Everyone loved it and many commented that it would satisfy non-vegetarians as well. I'm making it again tonight!

I made this soup and really enjoyed it, as did my Persian husband. (My mother in law also mentioned that she makes this ash with pintos instead of favas.) I used saffron in place of turmeric, as I didn't have turmeric on hand, but only used half as much as it is such a rich flavor. I used dried fava beans this time, but will try it with fresh favas when I make it next. May try it with pintos sometime too.

I am Persian and from Tehran. As far as I remember, we dont make this dish especially for New Year. This is our traditional winter Ash (soup) not only for New Year dish. Also recipe is not calling for Fava beans instead it has pinto beans. The noddle you can get from any Persian store, its especially for Ash I dont know where Mrs. Shafia gets her recipes.

this was great! exotic flavors,easy to make, and very satisfying. The only change was to add some walnut pieces to the onion topping, and using red onions for that.I forgot to add the lima bean. I will make this again for sure.

This is a brilliant recipe. Made it with half chicken broth, half veggie broth, and swiss chard for the greens. The beans add a lovely body and thickness to the soup, and the fresh herbs and greens at the end make it lively and bright. The savory onions with mint at the end...oh la la. We in the "western" world clearly have no clue what soup can be. I am freezing the soup part, and look forward to pulling it out of the freezer and throwing in the herbs and onions. This eats like a meal, and would be fantastic as a vegetarian stand-alone meal with crusty bread...no tofu, grilled veggies or portabello required (how refreshing).

I made this soup because I had left over yogurt and mizuna to use up and it was INCROYABLE!!! So good in fact everyone at my dinner party requested a copy. Then I bought the book and everything I have made from it was equally good. I can't make all the recipes- residing in West Africa- but what I can make comes out with great results. Make this!
