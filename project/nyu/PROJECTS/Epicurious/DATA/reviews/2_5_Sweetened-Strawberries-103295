If u think this is funny, go read 'salted water for boiling'... As far as this recipe, yes i would think that they would be sweetened with all that sugar. add rum and put in the blender with ice i say!

LOVED this recipe. Made a few changes. I replaced the straberries with four trout fillets and used 1/4 tsp. salt, divided, instead of sugar.Then dredged fillets in egg and bread crumbs, pan fried fillets in butter. Removed fillets and melted 1 tbs butter and added 2tbs. capers - swirled and heated then drizzled over fillets and added a squeeze of lemon. DELICIOUS

For a real showstopper of a dessert, layer these with Sara Lee pound cake and Cool Whip. Your guests will think you slaved all day. Yeeesh.

Too much sugar! For an easy yet interesting twist on these strawberries, try cutting the sugar down and add some Grand Marnier. Allow to marinade a little longer than two hours. Makes and excellent dessert topping.

SUGAR???? ...... now I know why my Strawberries have been awful. I've been using SALT all my life...sheessh, I feel like an idiot. Thanks Epicurious!! Oh, here's another great recipe.....take two pieces of bread. Spread one slice with 3 tablespoons of peanut butter. Spread the other slice with 1 tablespoon of jelly. Put the two together (be sure to have the dry side facing out) and viola, you'll have a dish your guests will be raving about....enjoy!!!

This is one of those complicated recipes that I always seem to mess up. First, I washed the strawberries.(I got 2 baskets, does that mean 2 cups?)Then, I forgot the part about slicing them and adding sugar. I did decide to leave them there for 2 hours for the flavors to meld. Well! I can back at EXACTLY 2 hours later. My strawberries must have dissolved in all that water and yet it somehow got all over my kids' shirts!! Next time, I am going to skip the part where you wait for 2 hours!

4 forks for all of the comments. Too too funny!

With all that sugar, we will all need wide screen TVs to fit in the "average" american. More reason to cringe is that there are better/smarter ways for simple sweetened strawberries - mix 1 or 2 tablespoons of sugar into orange juice - give it a quick turn in the microwave to make sure the sugar is dissolved - pour over the sliced strawberries.

This is way too much sugar. Half the amount called for would be plenty. For a tasty change, I do mine with brown sugar.

Gee whiz! I've been eating strawberries this way since I was three years old! I'm now eighty one. What else is new?

This is a nice simple desert as it makes a syrup to spoon over pound cake etc., however I prefer the taste of strawberries without so much sugar. I use honey and balsamic vinigar. I find the flavors very agreeable when simply enjoying the strawberries alone or with sliced orange rounds.

If the readers would really like to boost the taste of strawberries then add 1 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar. No, I am not nuts, try it. Really gives it a zip and the strawberry taste is enhanced. If the amounts are larger then add another teaspoon.

Hey out there....I'm sure the reason this is under "The Most Talked About" is because of folks like you and now me, writing about it even to complain!! I like this easy-never-have-to-think-how-to-do type of recipe....keep 'em coming! Strawberries are in abundance, throughout NH, and are tasting "mighty good" especially prepared simple like this!

Does anyone else find it tragic yet hilarious that this recipe has become the most talked about recipe on Epicurious? How did this happen? What a world!

Rating: 0
ok, the first 5-6 comments about how this recipe was not very complex were kind of funny but really come on now, don't you know that jokes can become tired after awhile? It would be nice if this thing would be finally laid to rest so that a good recipe could take its place in the 'most talked about' section.

This is amazing, did you have hidden cameras in my Mama's kitchen all these years? Very original!

O.K., Let me get this straight, mix the berries with the sugar or the sugar with the berries??? hope I don't screw it up...

Hey, you guys. Get OVER yourselves !!! This 'recipe' is just one component of another recipe comprising several parts - as a previous reviewer already pointed out. Duh !!!

Everyone is kidding, right?! I hope they have a recipe on their website for boiled milk, too.

Have to agree, not much of a "recipe" -- but useful nevertheless. Try adding a tablespoon or two of Grand Marnier and serving over vanilla ice cream. Yummy!

I'VE BEEN MAKING THIS RECIPE FOR YEARS. YOU MUST TRY IT WITH WHIPPED CREAM OR ICE CREAM ON TOP. ENJOY!

At last!!! The perfect answer to the question all cooks have..How do I sweeten strawberries? This recipe was clear and easy to follow, I will make it again and again and astound my dinner guests.

Rating: 1
I guess that I was astounded that this would be considered a "recipe"--isn't it a bit obvious that adding sugar to strawberries would make them sweetened?

Rating: 1
this is hardly a recipe!

Boy, rocket scientists need not even attempt this one. What a waste of time, as I thought Epicurious had posted a "new" tip on sweetening strawberries. "For even hotter coals, pour a little lighter fluid over them before igniting". :) Come on Epicurious -- pump us up!

The reason this recipe is posted is because it's part of the recipe for CHOCOLATE POUND CAKE WITH STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM AND BITTERSWEET CHOCOLATE SAUCE --maybe next time you won't be so quick to dish

I am surprised that a little more creativeness isn't applied here. . .it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this one out!

Is this a joke? Why would anyone seriously need a recipe for this? Here's a recipe ... take a bowl of cereal .... and the trick is ... you pour milk over it. The flavor combination is unreal ... try it for yourself!

It is wildly wierd that someone would post a recipe that calls for strawberries and sugar. How obvious? Let's try...putting vanilla in vanilla ice cream.

I went one step further....I grated the strawberries(big pieces) and added them to heavy whipping cream then added the sugar. It makes a great summer treat!

Not being one to leave well enough alone, I tried adding honey instead of sugar, and little vanilla extract. Much more interesting!

Sorry, but I live in Louisiana and if you've ever had (Springfield) Louisiana strawberries you'd know, they may sometimes be small, but they are the sweetest strawberries in the world!! So very sweet that I couldn't even imagine adding sugar to them! This recipe may be great for any other strawberries, but since I've been spoiled by our local variety, I may never know!!

Add about 2 or 4 tbl of very old, very rich balsamic vinegar and it's a hell of a lot better.

Rating: 4
Debated rating 3 or 4: 3 because it's so obvious, and 4 because it's hard to beat! However, Caroline taught me long ago to add FRESH LEMON JUICE to "sparkle" or "brighten" the flavor of any sugar-sweetened fruit. While her advice was especially true for frozen daiquiris, it applies to pies, etc. as well. Here, I recommend ~1/2 lemon.
