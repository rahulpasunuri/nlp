So perfect! The dough is not too sweet and the topping was amazing. Everyone loved these and asked for more. Simple and easy to make.

i had to let this rise for an extra twenty minutes before rolling out. the recipie was still delicious, but i substituted granulated sugar instead of brown sugar on the inside of the rolls, that cut back on the intensity of the sweetness

I have made this recipe many times and my family and friends rave about them. Instead of walnuts I use macademia nuts and skip the raisins. There the best buns on Maui!

Love this! We have made it over and over and it's great every time!

These were tasty, but WAY too sweet. Most everyone ate half and then put them aside. Perhaps cut the amount of brown sugar on the top down to just a sprinkling?

I was looking for a good cinnamon roll that will travel well, and is fairly easy to make. These more than meet those requirements. The dough is easy to make, the liquids are confined in the pan UNDER the dough, so they travel well. DEFINITELY to be made again!

Loved the whole wheat in this recipe. I used my bread machine for the dough mixing and raising - I got a dough that was very airy and too light. Wound up with fallen rolls - and had to trim the 45 min cook time down to abou 30 min - and still wound up with slightly overdone rolls. The carmel for this recipe, however, is wonderful! Eaten warm they are about the best whole wheat cinnamon rolls I've had in awhile.

Worth the effort, very flavorful and not overly sweet.

The nut/caramel topping is delicious, but the actual roll is dry and crisp on the bottom, not at all like any cinnamon roll I have ever had before. Maybe the temperature was off; I'd love to make this again, as the flavor is wonderful, but it would need modifications to get the texture right.

this was pretty good but i found the caramel caramalized too quickly, almost burning. i cooked it 10 minutes less that recipe stated and still had burnt or almost burnt parts

Make sure you use a baking dish with high sides for this one. It makes a big sticky mess in your oven. Otherwise, a wonderful recipe!

I have been searching for a good cinnamon roll recipe. This is great, I love the addition of WW flour. I did not add the nuts, and did not stress about the caramel, just melted 1 cube of butter in microwave with sugar. (only used 1 cube butter)

Dry and rather tasteless. I've had much better homemade rolls

I was trying to find a recipe for the initiation of my new mixer. This was perfect. The recipe is really easy and tastes great. My only error was that I didn't boil the caramel for the bottom long enough and it came out a little crystally. The texture is not the best, but the flavor is excellent!

These rolls are delicious! The dough was a little sticky, but it was also unbearably humid, so that might explain that! Like other reviewers, I lined my pan with parchment, omitted raisins, made extra caramel and cut the dough into 10 rounds instead of 15...quick tip, wrapping the roll with dental floss and pulling it tight is an easy way to cut the rolls without smashing them. I'll definitely make them again...my other half happily devoured half the pan!

My 12year old son helped me make these and they turned out fabulous! He is so proud of himself. They were very easy. I used 1/2 amt. of butter for filling.

My kids and I enjoyed these rolls, but found that the recipe called for much too much butter. We used less than half on the rolls and they turned out fine. Omitted raisins and nuts for kids' preferences. I might try it with only white flour next time for a fluffier roll.

Made this for my dh the other morning, they were fantastic. I, too, used only all purpose flour, omitted the raisins and used pecans. Fantastic! It did take a while to make though so next time I will make the night before so they are ready to pop in the oven in the morning.

The first time I made it I was at my friends house!! It was so good I had to go home and make them for my kids. Everyone loved them and now it's a " Sunday morning" thing.

A very nice dough to handle, but needs some revision on the topping. I ended up with a thick, grainy topping which I scraped off the rolls and back into a pan with a little water and 1/2 & 1/2 and then drizzled on top. It's not a bad recipe, but with so many others out there, will probably try a different one next time.

Tried the recipe as is, the first time; and since then, with these modifications (thanks to all the reviewers)and personal preference: used all purpose flour only (though the whole wheat is good too) which, when I doubled the recipe, used up to about 5 1/2 to 6 cups. Omitted the raisins. I made 1/4 extra caramelised mixture, which I spread a bit on the pan (lined with parchment paper) and on the dough liberally (keeping in mind of the border), dotted cut chilled butter everywhere, and sprinkled all the pecans (which I do omit at times for the children) evenly, with the cinnamon abundantly; that way I don't lose any nuts to the pan (sometimes), but all in, lol. When baked and popped them out the pans, I drizzled a bit more caramel mixture on the buns ... sticky or what??? Totally delish big sticky rolls. Thanks, Charleen from Fremont (recipe 'owner').

These are very, very tasty. My family really enjoyed them. Not unbearably sweet, just right. Great hot with a scoop of vanilla icecream on the side, or cup of coffee.

Yummy. The second time I made these, I cut down the brown sugar by nearly half and used some white sugar and extra butter. (They were too sweet for me using the full amount of brown sugar.) Also I like a really big fat cinnamon roll so I cut the dough into 9 rolls instead of 15. Result: big soft doughy sticky rolls! Yum!

OK, I can't bake very well, and these turned out GREAT. I did use about 1/4 more of the brown sugar/butter mix because I like mine very sticky. I also melted the 1/2 C butter and brushed 1/2 on the dough, then did the brown sugar/cinnamon, then poured the rest over. Also used just regular white flour. I had to use extra flour mixing it too, but that was probably just my inexperience. YUM, I'm off to give some to neighbors so I don't eat them all myself.

Great rolls - Allow Butter and sugar to carmelize before pouring into pan. Also, creaming butter and sugar for filling makes for a less-grainy texture. Omitted raisins.

Very forgiving recipe. I made this late at night using all white flour and some Bisquick, raw sugar crystals instead of brown sugar, and butter/olive oil rather than just butter. Let it rise overnite and it was ready for the oven first thing in the morning. Very impressive for guests; But make sure you take everything out of the pan the first time; the caramel hardens and makes it impossible after it cools.

Hats off to the author of this gem...and to those who goof and keep trying. My first batch was flat and I belatedly discovered the yeast had expired, bought some fresh, and BAM! Perfection even at 6500 feet! P.S. Made the 2nd batch at night, got tired and put the fully assembled pan in the fridge, then put them right into preheated oven next morning. Melt in your mouth! Two sticky thumbs up.

not a great recipe, overall. Just okay. Mine turned out chewy and not as moist as I like.

I accidentally cooked these at 450 degrees instead of 350 -- and if you're looking to save some time, try it: 15 minutes and presto!

I took mine out after 35 minutes and they were perfect. I only used 1/4 cup of butter for the filling (the whole stick looked like too much fat on the dough) and everything was still tasty. Definitely a keeper.

I live in Cairo, Egypt so some of the ingredients are either not available or somewhat different. It took me several tries to get it right but it is fantastic and the Egyptians LOVED it. I could not find wheat flour so I used all purpose instead, brown sugar is very expensive here if you can find it so I used half brown sugar and half molasses and I baked them for only 30 min. They were wonderful.

Mine came out a little overbaked too, I think the baking time is a little long. But they still disappeared from the table, despite being overbaked.

I was really disappointed! Nothing really worked, although I followed the recipe very carefully, and my 'sticky' rolls turned out burned and really bad...I think I'd better try another recipe for cinnamon rolls!

These cinnamon rolls were very good and easy to make. I skipped the whole wheat flour and used all purpose flour instead. Didn't have rapid rise yeast so substituted 1 T. of instant, along with 1 t. of sugar, dissolved in 1/4 c. of very warm water. Therefore I only added 1/2 c. of water when mixing the dry ingredients. Don't care for walnuts so used pecans. My oven is convection so I reduced the temperature by 25 degrees and baking time was 35 mins. Sticky sauce was so good that I didn't make the cream cheese glaze afterall!

This recipe is great for a husband who is still a little child as far as treats go. We were honestly impressed by the good taste of the cinnamon rolls. The stickiness made it even more fun to eat them ...

They were SO GOOD, i loved them, but they were a bit burned. I think less than 45 minutes in the oven is much better and more sugar and cinnamon if ur not going to do the sticky sauce.

Yummy City !! well worth the calories !! I followed what the Conneticut Cook did and let mine rise overnight in the fridge..it didn't look like it had risen but once in the oven it definately rose. I substituted pecans for walnuts, next time it will be macadamia nuts. I had trouble rollling mine up because the sugar mixture kept falling out ..So when I finished cutting the rolls I took the ends and kneeded in the left over mixture and rolled that up by itself and it was EXCELLENT !!

This recipe produced excellent, sticky, cinnamon rolls. I used a bread machine to make the dough, formed them, lined the baking pan with parchment, and set it in the cooler overnight to slow proof. Waking up in the morning found them perfectly risen. Once the oven was up to temp, the rolls were ready to be baked. Perhaps my oven ran hot, but I found them ready well before 40 minutes. Leftover rolls were individually frozen and thaw in the microwave within seconds.
