This is delicious! I also make it without the pita for those carb conscious people...kinda like a Caprese salad.

I'd recommend marinating and/or grilling the tomatoes as well.

Fantastic! I made this on my George Foreman grill. Funny that the "cheese fat" was caught in the tray. I thought that the marinade was a little bland, but the Halloumi made up for it! What a great dish!

Fantastic - what a perfect taste of summer. I'd never had Halloumi before, but have now shared this treat with many friends.

If the taste of cumin is too strong for your pallate, this recipe will be just fine without it as well. The saltiness of halloumi is nicely balanced by the tomato. Halloumi is a trademarked cheese from the Island of Cyprus although and it might be easier to find if you ask for Cyprus Halloumi. Stop&Shop carries it in certain stores in New England if you do not live close by to NYC and all the Greek grocery stores.

I had a little trouble tracking down mini pitas - was actually just going to skip that ingredient. But they made the dish into a perfect finger food appetizer. When garnishing use good olive oil. Can't wait to make this again when tomatoes are fully in season!
