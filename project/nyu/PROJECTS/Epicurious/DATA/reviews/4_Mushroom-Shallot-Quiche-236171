The filling was wonderful, the crust left something to be desired, although it may have suffered more because of my execution, rather than the recipe itself.

Very tasty and made for a great hearty first course. But I wouldn't call this a quiche, way to dense. It's more like a tart. A quiche is a custard. Also found it amusing that people will gave the recipe 4 Forks then went on to make so many changes as to make the original recipe unrecognizable.

Very easy to make and sooooo delicious! I added chopped onions with the shallots while cooking and it came out great.

Made this recipe for book group and they ate it all before moving on to the ham and cheese quiche. Next time I'll only use four teaspoons of the thyme. It was a little strong for me.

Love Quiche!! This recipe is fabulous, very simple yet tasty. I added a few cloves of garlic (I have to have garlic in everything!) and replaced the heavy cream with milk to cut out the high fat content. Delicious!

I thought this was yucky, and so did the whole family. It's oversalted and over stuffed with ingredients. Life is too short to try this again. ~M

This turned out delicious! I made this with a gluten free (homemade) crust and instead of gruyere I used a goat cheese gouda and buttermilk instead of cream. I agree with other reviewers that this needs more eggs, cream, & cheese though.

This recipe is always a hit! I usually substitute half and half for the cream (although cream is better), 1 teaspoon of dried thyme leaves for the fresh, and fresh chives for the green onions.

It comes out much thinner than I had expected but has a wonderful flavor!

Excellent recipe. Made it dairy-free by substituting rice milk for half-and-half. I was skeptical, but the quiche was lovely. Took longer in the oven (35-40 minutes) to set. Added a splash of sherry to the mushroom mixture; used oyster mushrooms.

Fantastic. I made some changes so that I could use up a few things in the fridge. Following Rainy_Day's lead, I splashed 3-4 capfuls of sherry in with the mushrooms. At about the 6-minute mark I tossed in some diced pancetta and prosciutto, approximately one small sIice of each. I sprinkled shredded Swiss over the mushroom layer when constructing the quiche. More Swiss and a dusting of high-end Parmesan went on top along with the scallions. I also used more shallots (about 4) and a frozen pie crust (thawed for 20 mins, brushed w/ butter, baked for 10 mins, brushed w/ egg whites). My only other deviation consisted of fat free half-and- half instead of whipping cream (this allowed me to justify the extra cheese - yes, call me Wallace). Cooking time increased by about 7 minutes.

Perfection. I made this as written with the exception of adding a couple capfuls of sherry to the mushroom mixture as it cooked. The seasoning was perfect, the crust was perfect, loved it. The gruyere is excellent. I highly recommend this.

After reading the reviews I adjusted quantities to increase the size to an 11" tart pan. More shallots and mushrooms, 7 eggs, 1 1/4 c whipping cream and more green onions and cheese. Made enough for the tart and four ramekins without crust. I buttered the ramekins and sprinkled panko on the bottom then added the mushrooms, egg sauce, cheese and onions. All were delicious.

this is tasty, but i agree that more eggs, more cheese, etc would improve it a great deal. i typically use a store-bought crust for quiche, however i did make this one.....me like:)

I used 4 large eggs instead of two and added an additional 1/4 cup milk I also added about a 1/2 cup of Smoked Goudda Cheese which is awesome with the mushrooms! Add spinach and or bacon to this recipe for a really great dish!

I reviewed this last February when I made mini- quiches for my friend's baby shower. Made regular quiches (doubled the recipe) for my sister's baby shower brunch this weekend and it was fabulous. Followed the recipe to a T..but (sorry, embarrassed to say) I used store bought pie crust for ease, but it was still wonderful. Decadent! Highly recommended!

I cheated and used ready crust. Baked the crust for 15 mins before putting the filling in, so that it turned out very crispy and delicious. The filling is perfect. I used 3 eggs, fat-free half and half instead of whipping cream, and a bit more cheese. Result: heavenly.

The quiche was good...although it was missing...a certain 'je ne sais quoi'. Maybe a mix of another veggie...not sure...but it was good. I would make it again, but I might add more variety.

Oh, also, I used parmesian instead of the other cheese, much cheaper but tastes great nontheless.

I've made this a few times now, and realized that to compensate for the lack of salt, use dill instead of thyme. The dill made it perfect. I also doubled the mushroom and shallot amount, which made it great.

This was very good; although it was alot of work. I made the pie crust form scratch and it was really delicious although it did not look as pretty as I might have hoped. But, that was not their fault I've only made about 5 pie crusts from scratch.

Very good for the minimal effort required. For frugality, you might consider using swiss cheese as opposed to guyere. It will turn out fine.

Fantastic filling. I didn't have time to make dough so bought the pillsbury rollout crescent dough, cooked it for 10 minutes, let cool, then filled.

Rating: 2
It is a good basic quiche. Main advantage: easy to make. But there are much tastier quiches out there. The crust is too thick for my taste. And the filling is just ok. Next time I'll make a thinner crust and will double the mushrooms/shallots. I find it tastes better the next day.

Rating: 4
I used this recipe for mini-quiches for a party. I used Pillsbury pie crust (which I highly recommend). I used a muffin pan - it made exactly 12 mini-quiches. The only thing I didn't do was put pie weights or beans in the crust when I was pre-baking it. So naturally the crusts weren't as perfectly formed as one would have liked. Nonetheless, these were excellent & a big hit at the party.

Pretty good, but needs salt. I ended up having to make more of the custard to fill my deep-dish pie shell (used store-bought). Overall, pretty good, but next time I'll try to improve on the seasonings.

Rating: 3
This was good - I used frozen pie crust to save on time (okay, I admit it - I'm scared of making pastry), and substituted Parmesan for the Gruyère. The shallots, to me, are the high point of this quiche. I have made variations with adding a little spinach, and substituting dried tarragon for the thyme. If you prefer a fluffier quiche, try adding a third egg, as this one is on the dense side.

Rating: 4
Like other reviewers, I cheated and used a pre-made pie crust, which made this quiche even easier. It was delicious nonetheless. Perfect for a light dinner with a salad or a brunch. I made two and froze one, which kept well for a few weeks until we defrosted and heated it up.

this was DIVINE. So easy and completely delicious. I did cheat and use a pie crust from Trader Joe's (they are so good - no one ever knows the difference). Really, you won't be sorry. A huge hit at our party.

This recipe is definitely worth making. The crust was deliciously different (not like a regular pie crust) and I felt it was exceptional. The filling was a great compliment with it's creaminess and burst of thyme. I shared the quiche with friends and family and they enjoyed it as much as I did. It's a keeper!

Filling was great, crust was horrid. The dough was unworkably dry. I have made a million crusts, and followed the recipe explicitly-maybe I needed a larger egg or something. when I compensated with adding more ice-cold water, the resultant crust was extremely tough. Add some sherry to the mushrooms as you saute for a richer flavor - yum. To the cook from Zurich - Generally a stick of butter = .5 cups = .25 pounds = 113 grams = 4 oz. Hope this helps!

It would be helpful to express the ingredients in measures that non-Americans can appreciate. I don't even mean grams or milliliters. Why can't you give the amounts at least in ounces? How much is "half a stick" or "half a cup" of butter? It's a solid you're talking about, so some reference to weight would be helpful...

So good and I even used the roll out crust. I think I added an egg and used jarlsberg cheese. If I had actually followed the recipe I can only imagine how wonderful...

Made this last night for dinner - with a few changes. For ease/speed I used an already made pie crust which I rolled out and into a pie pan. I blind baked it per directions. I added sauted spinach which I drained as well as two extra egg whites. I also subed fat free half and half for the whipping cream as recommended by another cook. I served it with a mixed green salad and a glass of wine! All in all it was delicious.

I have a standby quiche recipe that is to "die for" both literally and figuratively because of all the cheese and eggs. I find this version as satisfying without the added calories, cholesterol and leftovers. The thyme is essential.

I made this as a crustless quiche, spraying the pan with PAM and sprinkling a teaspoon of panko on the bottom to prevent sticking. Added an additional egg, used fat free half and half and added sauteed & well drained spinach. All in all this was yummy. Next time might add one or two frothy egg whites to the custard.

I served this for a Sunday brunch and everyone loved it. I used a store bought pie crust. Also I used an extra egg, and it took a bit longer to cook than what the recipe said. Using fresh thyme makes all the difference.

I cheated and didn't make my own crust due to time constraints, but the filling was delicious and I will definitely be making this one again.

The prep work is a little much but you don't need the two hours just to chill the dough. In fact, the full recommended hour chill time makes the dough unworkable initially. Fifteen to twenty minutes is fine for both the initial chill and then again, after you have it in the tart pan. Very good and worth the effort! The butter crust really makes the difference.

Rating: 2
The prep work on this recipe is easy but it is very time-consuming with the required dough chilling (twice) and the cooling of the pie crust and mushrooms. I decided not to chill the dough after placing in the pan and I don't think my pie crust suffered. While the flavors are great, my biggest criticism is that I wanted more "egginess". Next time I will try a prepared pie crust and add another egg.

Rating: 3
I used fat-free half and half instead of cream, chives in place of green onions, and upped the amount of gruyere cheese to about 1/4 cup. I also used a store bought crust, because I didn't have time to make my own, but next time I will try the crust in the recipe. Delicious and pretty light for a quiche.

This is for "danakor" in Sydney. A hard,dry crust is from handling it too much. I make lousy crust...so, buy the box, add ice water, and tastes pretty good...and, hey..I'm a good cook and baker. Just can't make a homemade crust. And, no one can tell the difference. The filling sounds YUMMY.

This was excellent. The thyme really paired well with the mushrooms and shallots. My guests loved it.

Great recipe. The crust was delicious, but alittle greasy. I added the cheese after the quiche came out of the oven and kept it covered until serving. The cheese melted beautifully.

Rating: 4
I used completely different veggie fillings, but wanted to review the basics of the recipe which are fantastic. The pie crust is perfect. Easy to make and very easy to work with (I even used the paddle attachment in my standing mixer). The custard mixture was also fantastic. I'll hang onto both of those as staples and a great way to get rid of leftovers!

Rating: 4
This was quite savory. I added spinach to the recipe and used feta cheese on top and replaced scallions with chives. I also used Half & Half instead of the whipping cream. I didn't have time chill and bake the crust according to the directions, so that may have caused some problems because the crust had shrunk away from the pan causing the filling to leak out and under. But nonetheless it was quite good and will no doubt make it again.

I made a few revisions: 1. I used a spelt flour crust, available at Whole Foods. 2. I substituted 2 T chopped fennel fronds for the fresh thyme. 3. I used half and half instead of whipping cream. 4. I used 3 large eggs instead of two. 5. I increased the grated Gruyere cheese to 1/3 cup. Delicious!

The quiche filling is delicious, but the crust is not to my liking. It is very dry and too hard. Also while making the crust it was crumbling too much and i couldnt make a proper dough, i think it needs more water or another egg. But i will give it another try as i love the filling!
