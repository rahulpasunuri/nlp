I made these cookies and used mincemeat filling as well....better than the apricot which was delicious...new family favorite!

Scrumptious, but this dough is very hard to work with. I kept putting it in and out of the freezer, but if left too long the dough would get too hard and break when I tried to roll the cookie. The egg wash on the corners made it nearly impossible to pick up, so instead I assembled the cookies and then brushed them with the egg after. When they came out of the oven I dusted with powdered sugar.

I have been hunting this receipe for awhile..my grandmother use to make it ..but then I had no appreciation for it! This was a wonderful receipe..It works with the kids because of the filling...I filled it with strawberry jelly for them but It has such a pastry texture that it really doesn't have a sweeet to the bone flavor..This is balanced by a sprinkle of conf sugar at the end...

My family recipe (Ukrainian) calls for rolling the dough out on powdered sugar. I cut them into 1 1/2 to 2 inch squares, omit the egg wash, drop a 1/2 t. Solo Apricot or Almond filling in the center, and fold opposite corners over and press down a little. Then roll them in powdered sugar and place onthe cookie sheet. Outstanding results!

These are similar to kalachys that I made with my grandmother as a child, and that I continue to make today. when rolling out the dough use powdered sugar in place of the flour, you will notice a wonderful tasting difference. No need to grease the cookie sheet when baking either

The pastry is indeed delicate, but it's also tasteless. I ran one test batch and am glad I did. I think I'll try giving the cookies an egg wash once filled and sprinkle with crystal sugar. The filling is excellent.

These cookies are awesome! I made them for Christmas and continue to get requests for them throughout the year. Time consuming, I suggest making the dough and filling a day before you bake the cookies.

These are among the best cookies I've ever made. I followed the recipe, except that I used some sugar instead of part of the honey because I thought the honey flavor was becoming too pronounced. The dough was flaky and delicious--better even than my favorite rugelach recipe. If you double the recipe, as I did, you don't have to double the filling, unless you want a lot left over.

This is a lovely cookie. My results improved when I refrigerated the dough overnight. Also, I preferred them in a smaller size - 1 1/2" sq. The tender pastry would work well with other fillings. I may try a mix of nuts, raisins and cinnamon.

Very good cookie. I didn't have marmalade so I used apricot preserves and they were delicious. Also, dressed them up a bit with a drizzle of white or dark chocolate.

This is a beautifully balanced recipe. The pastry is perfect, very tender and not too sweet. I can think of a thousand uses for it. The filling is delectable. I made it exactly as per the recipe and would not change a thing. A keeper.

The only thing I would change about this recipe is the raisins. I used apricot preserves. Mine came out looking thicker in the dough than the photograph. These were very well-received at a Christmas party I brought them to.

I will definitely make these again because everyone loved them. They were munchable, which is something I look for in cookies because you can eat several of them without feeling guilty or heavy. I tried to put the filling in the blender and it didn't really work so a food processor is a definite must for this. Even so, the chunky filling didn't really detract. And I modified the recipe based on what some people said about the honey overpowering the apricot but my boyfriend and I thought a little more honey wouldn't have been a bad thing so when I make them again I will use the original amount of honey. The dough would be good with other fillings too. Like blackberries.

Amazing! These were a huge hit for New Year's. Be sure to boil the filling until most of the liquid evaporates, otherwise the cookies will be a little runny. Make the full recipe, because they will disappear quickly!

This recipe is excellent. I found that adding 3/4 cup of sugar to the dough mixture improved the flavor significantly. In addition to using the apricot filling, I also used a 1:1 mixture of boysenberry jam and strawberry jam as an alternative filling and it came out wonderfully.

Love these cookies - make them every year for my Polish in-laws. Have any of you had trouble getting these cookies to stay together? No matter how hard I "pinch" those two corners together, inevitably, some of them unfurl, and look weird. I have made these as thumbprint cookies as well. Round cookie cutter, press a well with thumb, fill. Made this way, though, they are harder to transport..

Thank you...I've been looking for this recipe everywhere. I remember making them with my mother who is Polish American. I can't wait to make them for my family, they are delicious!

Take the time to make the apricot filling - It really makes the difference. This pastry dough is perfect too. Next time I may consider adding almond extract to the dough, and use a sweet cheese filling.

Love these!! My polsish grandmother would make every Christmas. She would add a little icing (conft. sugar and water-not thick icing) and a sprinkle them with coconut. YUM ! We love them so much . We all had our favorite..cherry..date..mine was apricot.

These are wonderful little cookies for the winter, albeit a bit time consuming. The dough is very tender, so I put each sheet in the freezer for a minute or two before working with it. All in all, wonderful, and I will be making these again.

I made these for last Christmas and it was a rave among my guests :) I definitely made those again throughout the years whenever I needed an exceptional dessert to give "umph" at the end of the dinner. Definitely recommend this :)

Yup, these are the best; i use to make them with my mom. If you use the solo poppy filling, I use 2 egg whites, beath til frothy then add the solo filling, makes it oh-so-much-batter!

These are wonderful! Every time I make these, they disappear fast. On the filling, I use less honey (about 1/3 to 1/2 cup) because the honey seemed, to me, to dominate the filling flavor too much.

Additional fillings are prune filling and a walnut (similar to a nut roll filling)

I grew up eating my grandmother's "kolachi" cookies, the recipe is almost identical to these apricot filled cookies. The only difference is when she rolls out the dough she replaces flour with 10X sugar. It imparts a slight sweetness to the delicate pastry-like cookie.

This is a terrific recipe. It's essentially the recipe I use for making rugelach -- the dough is slightly different (mine requires confectioner's sugar), but the rest is pretty much the same. It produces a sumptuous cookie.

I made a half recipe of these tasty cookies with fresh apricots instead of dried. I used about 5 apricots (~1 cup), plus one fancy pear, and omitted the raisins. I cut the water down to 1/4 cup since the apricots were fresh, and simmered the mixture for 20 minutes or so until it thickened up. The fresh apricots made the filling slightly tart and I thought they were delicious!

My Aunt Lola,who is now 93 and still cooking, taught me to make these wonderful cookies....gone the same day they are baked......so good

The cookies brought back memories for sure. This is a new filling for me and I loved it, I love apricots. for A Cook from Long valley NJ on 12/19/05 - I indeed have a couple recipes for different fillings that my bushia made....one with a date filling, and one with a nut filling.

This is a cookie I remember growing up with. Does anyone have any other filling recipes besides the apricot one given?

Rating: 3
Very good but beware.... a LOT of work. This is very close to another recipe I have made which uses cottage cheese rather than cream cheese...also a LOT of work. The cottage cheese version may be just a notch more flavorful due to very tender pastry. I was hoping this was somehow quicker, but it wasn't.

I was delighted to find this recipe, as I lost the version I had years ago. The filling for these is even better than my old recipe, really fruity and less sugary. Delicious, and highly complimented by all who ate them--I made them for a holiday cookie exchange. The only thing I found is that instead of "some" I ended up with so much leftover filling that I'll probably make another batch of pastry this weekend and make more cookies (not a bad thing at all!).

These were bad. The filling looked like minced meat! The dough was flavorless and the filling was gummy. I will not make again.

These cookies are delicious.. I prepared the filling a day in advance (which helped a lot since they were for X-mas). I followed the dough recipe exactly and it worked well. For the filling, I added fewer raisins than called for but coarsely chopped about a dozen dried figs and added them instead. I also didn't spare the filling when putting them together so they ended up overflowing with naturally sweet goodness! I received many compliments on them and will definitely use this recipe again!

This is a cookie that I remember my mom making. This recipe is easier than hers, and it is my absolute favorite. YUM YUM!!

My mother's side of the family is Polish. It's not Christmas at our house until we make these cookies - which, by the way, are called Kolatchkys (please forgive my spelling). In a pinch, you can substitute any fruit filling in place of the apricots. Even the canned stuff works fine. Don't forget the powered sugar on top.

I did not try this version of the recipe, but my family has been making this for four generations! We roll ours out in sugar, and we cheat with Solo brand filling also. Tricky, but worth the effort.

These are so delicious and melt in your mouth! My bf's gma is Polish and she makes them for Christmas. I was never able to look up the recipe since I didn't "know" the Polish name for them. They taste heavenly and I recommend them for any occasion!

My mom has been making these forever. They are great. We buy Solo brand fillings if you don't want to make your own - they come in a variety of flavors!
