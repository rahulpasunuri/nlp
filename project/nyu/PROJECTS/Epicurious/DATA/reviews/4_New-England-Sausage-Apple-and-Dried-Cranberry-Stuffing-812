I have made this recipe for years since it was first published in the early 90's. I don't measure ingredients exactly any longer.........do most by memory. It's a lovely, lovely stuffing and gets rave reviews when ever i'ts my turn to do Thanksgiving dinner. I usually add pecans and when I have extra time I toast them before tossing them in the mix at the very end. I have packaged bread cubes/crumbs for the white bread and have not noticed a big difference. What makes this recipe is the leeks, apples, celery, rosemary, sausage,and cranberries. If this is traditional New England............yum!!!!

I made this last year and everyone requested it again this year - my only real modification was to use rosemary bread and turkey sausage since I had a guest who didn't eat pork. It was fantastic and I really enjoyed it.

This traditional NE stuffing absolutely lives up to all the hype! Mine wasn't too sweet, as some people said, but I was fortunate enough to find UNSWEETENED dried cranberries, which is no easy feat. Almost all dried cranberries I see have sugar added (like "craisins"). I also cut down on the apple a little bit and add fresh sage in with the other herbs. I cooked mine outside of the bird and so I added in some extra broth. Came out moist, flavorful and no one could get enough!

This was the first stuffing recipe I ever tried. I wanted to have something different this year and break from my mom's traditional low-key savory stuffing with celery, onions, poultry seasoning and Peppridge Farms bread. I quickly learned that I like my stuffing traditional and less sweet! Don't get me wrong, this was really good and my husband loved it, but too sweet for my taste with the cranberries and apples. I think I may also have oversalted a tad. Just my personal preference for more savory, less sweet but it was fun to try! Prep time took forever too!

I did a whole 1.5lb loaf and I used the sage broth that went with the turkey I made so that it tasted more like I cooked it in the bird (did it in a casserole dish so it would cook more evenly)and it came out swimmingly!

I make this every year. Although I use 8 cups stuffing premade and cubes, such as Pepperidge Farm and no eggs (makes it like bread pudding...). I also add more butter...a lot more. Two sticks to be exact and 1/4 cup olive oil. I know, I know but it is once a year and everyone raves!

Sometimes I only loosely follow this recipe and it always turns out great. I use breakfast sausage, such as Jimmy Dean's, dried plain stuffing cubes, Mrs. Cubbison's cornbread stuffing sans the seasoning packets and I've never use the eggs.

I have been making this since 1999, and it is still welcome on my Thanksgiving table. Only changes I make is sub spicy sausage for the sweet and replace the rosemary with sage for a more Thanksgiving-y flavor

Man oh man is this ever good! Even though the recipe says it's supposed to serve 14, I made the entire amount for just 4 people so everyone could have leftovers. Everything was gone in 2 days! I used sourdough bread for my first attempt at this. As others suggested, I also added chopped pecans, cut the poultry seasoning down to 2 tsp and added a lot of fresh sage instead. The only thing I will change next time is to add a bit more leeks and cranberries and not to chop the apples as fine. Now I can finally stop looking for the perfect stuffing recipe.

I served this with the Roast Turkey with Maple Herb butter from this site and it complimented perfectly! I upped the bread to 20 oz to use up an entire loaf and upped everything else a bit too. It makes a ton! Luckily, since everyone had seconds and thirds. I used significantly more than 1 1/3c broth. I will make this recipe again and again, expermenting with different sausages and I think pecans would be a wonderful addition.

*** Crucial Modification *** You will have to (at the least) TRIPLE the amount of broth in this recipe, unless you like your stuffing extra, extra, extra dry.

Excellent! I have been trying to find the perfect dressing/stuffing recipe and absolutely love this one. I cut it by 1/3 because we only had 8 people and the vast majority are not stuffing fans. Next year I'll make the full recipe - didn't have nearly enough leftovers :)

This was excellent! I followed the recipe fairly closely and baked separate from the turkey. It was perfectly moist with a nice crunchy crust. The mix of flavors blended really well. It was a big hit for Thanksgiving.

Great stuffing recipe! My only problem with the recipe is that they have their sizing off when it comes to pans and bowl. When you put all the ingredients together, there is no fry pan that is big enough to hold it let alone a bowl afterward to add the stuffing and the eggs to it. The backing dish I ended up using had to be way bigger too. Be fore warned.

I have made this recipe for too many years to remember how many. However, I use cornbread instead of white bread (whispering: actually Pepperage Farms Cornbread Stuffing, it's easier than making the cornbread ;-)). I love the combination of the cornbread with these ingredients.

It was great to read the reviews of others who love this recipe. I have been making it since (I believe) 1997 and it has become a tradition.

This is a really great stuffing recipe - I followed the recipe fairly closely. I do not usually like fruit in savoury dishes but the apples and cranberries work very well in this. I made this stuffing outside the turkey and needed some extra broth at the end.

We, too, have been using this as our only stuffing recipe since 1994, when the Thanksgiving issue came out. My husband won't have it any other way. I still have the magazine as our Thanksgiving bible, no issue since has been as good LOL. No substitutions, and we do moisten it a little more with chicken broth, since our family likes it moist rather than crunchy.

I agree ... Have been making this for year's and it is alway exceptinal. I typically subsitute dried cherries for the cranberries, and prefer the richer flavor. This Thanksgiving I couldn't find dried cherries, and substituted Craisins ... a little too sweet. Also, leeks are essential to this recipe.

I have been making this recipe since the early 1990's. Everyone has always loved it and I won't try anything else anymore. If you are short on time, a hint from a woman in Rhode Island shared with me... Pepperidge Farm's Stuffing Mix (only out during the Holidays) is a great substitute.

Wow people. Wow. This was a great stuffing recipe and I see no need to try another ever again. It was the unanimous favorite at Thanksgiving this year. I definitely tried to get good quality ingredients, especially the sausage and the bread, and I think that made a different. Despite all the prep work, this is totally worth it.

This Thanksgiving was the first time I baked stuffing separately from the turkey. I thought this was a wonderful recipe. I tweaked it just a bit by using sourdough bread cubes, and Italian chicken sausage. I also added fresh rosemary and chopped water chestnuts, mushrooms, and I used just one egg. The result was moist and so delicious.

Rating: 4
Fantastic!!!! I like trying different recipes every year, but I'll be coming back to this one. Everyone loved it and wanted some to take home. Fortunately, I made the full recipe for only 4 people, so everyone got their wish. I added some extra fresh sage--about 3 TB.-- and an extra TB. of fresh rosemary, and, for me, the seasoning was perfect. I like a wet stuffing, so I used more chicken broth to moisten it.

Rating: 3
Follow all advice here to omit the poultry seasoning. If I make this again, I will use a bit of fresh chopped sage and thyme instead. I'd also increase the amount of cranberries and apples. Regular white bread toasted in the oven tastes fine. If you make turkey broth, use it instead of canned chicken broth. Enjoy!

I am going to make this recipe for sure this year ! I have a serious question: I am having 12 people for dinner and it says it makes 14 servings: Should I make double it? I thought if I make two batches, I would make one with challah and one with cornbread? So: is a single recipe enough with a little leftover?

I've been making this recipe since I first found it in BA in 1994. It ALWAYS gets raves! It is similar to the recipe published in 2000 and I've kind of morphed the 2. Changes are hot country sausage, toasted french bread, and I also add pecans. It's just wonderful and everyone really does love it. Thank you Bon Appetit for providing a family favorite every year!

My mom and I were looking to start a new tradition other than stove-top that we would have at other family member's houses. This recipe was it...WOW was it so good we made extra so we could freeze and have later. For the second batch we made some improvements: We used about 4 tablespoons (instead of teaspoons)of poultry seasoning, used full 6 oz bag of cranberries, added more apples, and used 4 eggs, then for a little crunch we added about a cup of sliced almonds.

I'm eating the leftovers as I write this! I've been making this stuffing for the past ten years or so because my whole family loves it so much. This Christmas, I made it with my first goose and it was great as usual. The combination of flavors is great in this stuffing. I haven't tried making any alterations to recipe yet because it's so good as-is. This year I did make it a day ahead and added the egg and cooked it the following day. I think that helped to meld the flavors a bit more. This Christmas, I also made an interesting oyster stuffing from F&W that was good, but couldn't hold a candle to this one. This will forever be a holiday dinner table staple for my family.

I have made this for the family dinner for the last 2 years and it get rave reviews. I have followed the instructions exactly as written, and its been great. However after reading the other reviewers, I am tempted to try the fresh sage instead of the poultry seasoning, and up the cranberries. I bet cornbread or a mix would be very tasty, but the white bread worked great for us. For sure make this a day ahead to really blend the flavors. I used Irish Breakfast sausages/bangers - very tasty!

I have been making this recipe since it came out at ThanksG time in 1994! We owned a restaurant restaurant at the time 7 years in Louisiana.Even though i was making this for my own family, I used to share the stuffing with customers. Let me tell you, I was bugged to DEATH until i gave them the recipe! Cut back on the poultry seas. Add finely chopped sage instead. Def. add the chopped pecans and put in 1 1/2 cups of cranberries. I also don't use white bread. Try this with your homemade cornbread cut into cubes. Its to die for! Have used this recipe as a base about a hundred times and I change breads (try ciabatta or even pumpernickel. Try other things like wild rice, cranberries and chopped dried apricots and chestnuts as well. Experiment! Your tummy will thank you! ;)

I've been making this recipe every Thanksgiving since 1994 when it was published in Southern Living's Thanksgiving Special Issue. The only thing I do different - I DOUBLE the recipe! My family can't get enough of this stuffing! A stockpot or lobster pot works great for the stove prep and a large commercial aluminum pan for baking. And for anyone who commented that this recipe has any resemblance to Pepperidge Farms stuffing - you couldn't have been following the instructions to THIS recipe -you must have be talking about a different one. :) Sharon, thanks for that wonderful issue. I will treasure it always.

I felt that the poultry seasoning was definitely overwhelming for the wonderful ingredients in this dish. Glad I tested it first and will make that adjustment come Thursday.

Rating: 2
What I think it was.... After thinking about this recipe, which I reviewed last Thanksgiving, I have concluded that it was the poultry seasoning that made this stuffing taste like Pepperidge Farm. I never knew what poultry seasoning was, but as soon as it entered the mixture, it both immediately evoked the familiar Pepperidge Farm scent and overpowered the delicate ingredients. I wonder if anyone else can comment on the similarity of seasonings - or solve it.

I have been making this for the last two years for both Xmas and Thanksgiving. Once I used turkey sausage and it just did not have the same full flavor as the pork - don't skimp! My father requests this every year so it will not be replaced with any other stuffing for a long long time to come! It's great!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year which was hosted by my in-laws with lots of my husband's family there. Needless to say the pressure was on and I had one dish to measure up with. I followed the recipe as written and it was the hit of the meal! It doesn't taste anything like Pepperidge Farms stuffing as mentioned by a prior reviewer (perhaps that review forgot to add the leeks and cranberries??) The combination of the sweet Italian sausage, the subtle flavor of the leeks, the tart apples and the sweet/sour cranberries works perfectly together. If you have any leftovers (unlikely!) you'll find it only gets better the next day. I've been asked to make this again so it's on the menu for Christmas and this time I'll make enough to ensure we have leftovers.

Rating: 2
After working like a dog to make this recipe, I was taken aback when I ate it -- AND IT TASTED EXACTLY LIKE PEPPERIDGE FARM STUFFING! It was fine, mind you, but it was frightening how much it tasted just like the stuffing-in-a-bag, especially after all that work and all of those rather exotic ingredients. The family concluded that if you threw some sausage, apples, and cranberries into Pepperidge Farm stuffing, it would be more or less identical to this recipe at a fraction of the effort. I was looking for a stuffing with a distinctive and somewhat unusual flavor. Guess I'll keep searching.

Rating: 4
It's not Turkey Day without this. Use extra sausage and add some fennel seed that is crushed with mortar and pestle. Don't pre-cook the apples or celery -- they'll cook in the oven or in the bird. Works just great with packaged stuffing mix - use half cubed and half crumbs. Yum!

This is a really wonderful recipe. I had some trepidation using egg (my former long standing recipe didn't call for them) so I had some hesitations. But I forced myself to make this to the letter and was not disappointed in the least! It was very moist and flavorful. It's even better the next day when all the flavors have a chance to sit together. It's destined to become our new Thanksgiving standard... truly a classic. Being celiac (I cannot eat the protein, gluten, found in wheat, barley, rye or oats) I made a gluten free version using kinnikinnick's Italian White Tapioca Rice Bread. It came out far better than I expected, the texture was perfect. I baked the stuffing in a pan and didn't use quite as much broth as the recipe called for to keep the GF bread from getting too soggy. I'm so pleased!

I can't get enough of this stuffing. It's good enough to make on non-special occasions. I don't always have all of the ingredients, so I often wing it. Challah bread is wonderful, but more often I use potato bread. Raisins and dried apricots are a good substitute for dried cranberries. I've also mixed hot and sweet sausage together with great success. I often make it w/o the fresh parsley, which doesn't really make much difference. I could eat this stuff everyday...for breakfast, lunch and dinner. YUM!

Fantastic recipe -- it makes a TON! Used 1/2 spicy sausage and half sweet bulk sausage, which added a nice flavor boost. Everyone loved it. I agree that it's important to add the broth just a little at a time -- and not to use all of it -- so the bread doesn't get mushy.

This will be a Tgiving staple in our household for years to come. Made it with challah/brioche bread as one other person recommended. I was a little concerned about this dish before cooking. It was a bit dry and didn't have a lot of flavor. I added some chicken broth before stuffing the turkey. This stuffing made a 180 degree turn while cooking. Everyone at the table raved about it. All the sweet and spicy flavors blend nicely...a very sophisticated taste and appearance. Don't hesitate to try this recipe!

Love this stuffing! I used challah/egg bread to make it a bit richer and fresh cranberries (had them left over from a tart). As I used a fresh loaf of bread, I didn't need quite as much broth since the bread is pretty dense and moist on its own. Definitely worth the effort!

This has been the ONLY stuffing recipe I have used for both Thanksgiving and Christmas since I discovered it more than six years ago. All of our friends and family agree that it is without doubt, the best ever! I grew up with a sausage stuffing and have always considered sausageless stuffings bland and unappealing. I always use sausage, but prefer bulk breakfast sausage to Italian sausage...I find it to be much more tender than the Italian sausage available locally. I also add freshly chopped sage and lots of freshly ground black pepper. A footnote: I have shared treasured recipes with friends who have produced strange results and have wondered how it is possible to take the same ingredients in the same proportions and produce something totally different. I have to scratch my head sometimes! Don't let the negative reviews turn you off!!

Great stuffing recipe. Here are some tips to make this ahead. I sauteed and mixed all the vegetables (minus the seasonings)and placed in a zip lock bag and froze for two weeks. Three days before Thanksgiving, I made a loaf of white bread in my bread machine and added the seasonings then. I did not toast the bread. I diced it up and left it in a zip lock bag until the night before serving. By then it was firm and a little stale. The day before serving, thaw the veggies and mix with your bread and place in dish. Before placing in oven, I added an entire can of chicken broth and a little more during cooking. Super easy, but looks and tastes like it was a lot of work. Nice combination of flavorings and less salt than prepared stuffing mixes. Move over Stove Top.

This will be my new stuffing staple for Roast Turkey - the combination of sausage and dried cranberries is great!

Rating: 4
This was by far the best stuffing.I used oat nut bread instead of white bread and fresh sage instead of rosemary (we don't like it). I didn't have dried cranberries so I used about 5 tlb of canned whole cranberries and stuffed a chicken with it.My family can't wait for me to stuff our turkey this Holiday with it.It truely was great.

This has been my favorite stuffing recipe since it came out years ago in the magazine. I have to make it every year for my family or else there will be heck to pay.

This is really good -- I served it with the Cider-Basted Turkey & apple gravy elsewhere on this site, and they complement each other beautifully. I think though, that the recipe serves more people than it says it does -- I halved the recipe, served 4 hungry Christmas dinner guests, gorged on leftovers for a week, and still had to discard the last of it as it got too old to be safe to eat.

Excellent- Made for the first time this fall and it was so good we added it to the menu over the holidays. I used sour dough bread the first time and missed it when we didn't use it the second time. But we used fresh herbs (sage, rosemary, etc.) instead of the dried poultry seasoning and it was heavenly.

Best stuffing I've ever eaten. Christmas Eve crowd loved it. I omitted the celery (ugh), assembled the day before and mixed in the eggs and broth right before popping in the oven. I used two 9x13 baking dishes rather than one huge casserole. Next time around I may experiment with corn bread instead of white.

The reviews are right. This is the best stuffing for not a lot of work or complexity of ingredients. I made it the day before Thanksgiving and baked it outside the bird the next day. Simple and still excellent>

I thought this was really tasty - the only thing I would do differently next time is chop the bread in much smaller pieces and butter it prior to toasting. I did add extra cranberries and use a mixture of fresh and dried. Nummynummynummy!

An excellent stuffing - I served it with the Apricot-Glazed Turkey and it went well. I added one and one half chopped toasted pecans for some crunch. Also, Cook's Illustrated had a suggested for the stuffing inside the bird that worked great. You heat the prepared stuffing on high in the microwave for 6-8 minutes just before stuffing to give it a head start on heating up. You then make a bag out of cheesecloth with a couple of well placed knots - place the stuffing inside the bag and the bag inside the turkey. When the turkey is done, simply remove the bag, open and place into a serving dish.

Absolutely delicious! Goes very well with the roasted turkey with maple herb butter. I added some toasted chopped pecans. Will be making this again, definitely!

Was my family ever glad I chose this stuffing this year. A new family favorite - even the kids ate it (once they picked out the "icky" cranberries). Everything goes together so well in this recipe. Will definitely be making this again next year.

I have this recipe several times and really love the results. All the flavors go so well together and the dried cranberries are such a nice touch. This year, I had a hard time finding sweet Italian sausage, so I ended up with a slightly spicy Calbrese sausage. It was still good and I bet you could even use a more sagey breakfast sausage with success. I paired it witht he Apricot Glazed Roast Turkey with Carmelized Oniona and Shallot gravy. Really nice together.

I made this and our traditional oyster stuffing for Thanksgiving. The kids really liked this one, and so did I. It will be a new tradition for us now (hubby still prefers oyster).

Rating: 4
I made this dish for the first time last year. I had doubled the recipe to have extra for the next day, and there was only ONE cup left for only a 15 lb. bird! Everyone went crazy, even the ones that don't usually eat stuffing! I added two extra apples and an extra cup of dried craisins. I also used eggbeaters, turkey italian sausage, and added some cornbread stuffing to the recipe as well. NO one believed me when I told them it was low fat.If you bake it all in a casserole dish you might need to add a little more chicken broth to keep it moist.I am not even allowed to look for another recipe now. This is it! It is absolutely the best- and I have made a LOT of stuffing recipes over the yrs.! Try it! You won't be sorry!

I have made this delicious stuffing recipe many, many times. It has now become a Thanksgiving tradition in our family. Everyone loves it. I have also substituted fresh cranberries for dried which adds an interesting and tart twist.

To the Cook asking where to find the poultry seasonings: I too, was blinded in the spice aisle until some kind stranger helped me. I live in NJ and I'm not sure where you're from but we have something called "Bells Seasoning" which is in a small yellow box with a colorful turkey on the front. It's in the spice aisle usually with the Emeril and other speciality seasonings. Hope this helps. Definately make this stuffing, it's the best! Happy Thanksgiving!!

I've been making this recipe for several years and I couldn't imagine Thanksgiving without it. I use sweet italian turkey sausage which works great and is not as heavy as the pork sausage. We barbacue our turkey outside so I bake the stuffing in the oven and it is great - everyone loves it.

Rating: 4
This was one of the best recipes I have ever found for Thanksgiving stuffing, and would make it again any time of year. The tastes all blend together well and the presentation is great b/c it is so colorful! I altered the recipe slightly and used 1/2 sweet italian chicken sausage and 1/2 regular sweet italian sausage and it provided for a reduced fat version with all the taste!

This dish sounds great - I want to try it this Thanksgiving. One question - where might I find the poultry seasoning listed in the recipe?

I'll never look for another stuffing recipe again! This one is wonderful and even my picky in-laws liked it. As stated by another reviewer, I eliminated the eggs and increased the amount of broth.

I like to experiment on friends and family with new recipes. This was the one I tried on Thanksgiving this year. Everyone loved it...even Jeff, who thinks he is all that when it comes to cooking. We constantly try to out do one another. Even he admitted this was the best he had tasted.

Rating: 4
Wonderful. I also made this ahead and froze it. The first time I have cooked dressing in a casserole with such success, and I forgot to add the egg and broth. I kept some out when I made it and placed under two chicken breasts and baked. Also wonderful. This is the only one I will be making in the future.

I loved this. I made it with fresh herbs instead of all poultry seasoning. I also added fresh cranberries, I love the tartness of a fresh cranberry. I also used cornbread, it added more sweet to balance out the tart.

Fabulous stuffing recipe. Have made MANY stuffing recipes through the years and this was the best. Just as good on those turkey sandwiches and reheated the next day - if you have any left!! A definite repeat.

Rating: 4
This recipe is wonderful, and I will definitely make it again. I don't stuff the bird, but baked all the stuffing in a glass dish (and omitted the eggs). I checked on the stuffing from time to time while it was baking & occasionally added a little more chicken stock to keep it moist. It turned out perfectly - I won't wait until next Thanksgiving to make it again!

This is the consummate stuffing recipe! The ingredients are wonderful, and it has a little of everything in it. It's now permanently on file in my recipe box, and will be the one I make from now on. It got raves from the entire family at our Thanksgiving celebration this year, and I'm quite sure it will be requested from now on.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe. The flavors mix perfectly. My only problem is that it didn't "stick together". I may not have used enough bread but when spooned onto a plate, each item separated completely (sausage, cranberries, bread) which made it somewhat difficult to eat. Anybody else have this problem or a suggestion on how to fix it as I'm making this again for Xmas.

This stuffing got rave reviews by my family this Thanksgiving. My Uncle, who doesn't normally like stuffing, said he loved it. I made it a bit healthier by using sweet turkey sausage, an egg substitue, lower fat butter and about a third whole wheat bread. I used a whole can of the lower-salt chicken broth (about 2 cups) and by accident used 1/2 cup of rosemary. It was delicious!

Rating: 3
An excellent stuffing recipe. I used the recipe as a guide but adjusted the ingredients to my taste using less sausage and cranberries. I was preparing a 15# turkey and there was enough to stuff the bird plus a small casserole full. I didn't enjoy the stuffing that was cooked on it's own nearly as much as that that was cooked in the bird. Will certainly prepare again though!

This stuffing was delicious. I usually don't like italian sausage, but I really liked this recipe. It wasn't difficult to make and everyone seemed to really enjoy it. We'll probably make it again for next year's Thanksgiving feast!

This is still my favorite. I try to make different things every year but I keep coming back to this. Even when I vary the Turkey and gravy, hthis recipe always works well. I take some of the leeks etc aside and mix it with some of the bread and vegetable broth for my vegetarian guest and he loves it.

WONDERFUL! This is my new stuffing recipe. I made it a week ahead and froze it. I defrosted it the day before and stuffed the bird with it. Hint: if you are feeding any vegetarians - hold back a little without the sausage - it still tastes great!

This receipe is wonderful! I make it every year now and my guests always want the receipe!

This stuffing receipe is the best I have ever tasted. I grew up in a family of New England women who loved to cook and a grandmother whoes receipe for stuffing was sacrid. However, the year I made this stuffing for my family it became the stuffing everyone wanted (and not just for Thanksgiving)! Currently my husband is in the Military and I host Thanksgiving for families from around the country and every year I'm bombarded with requests for this receipe. Thank you for providing an easy resource for good food!

For a really decadent T'giving dinner that will please EVERYONE, use this recipe to stuff one end of the bird, and the "Herbed Oyster Stuffing" ("Gourmet" Nov 92) to stuff the other end. These two excellent but very different recipes complement each other as well as they go with turkey.

I tried this for the first time several years ago while on Weight Watchers and I lightened it up bby using Lite Bread, Lite Sausage, Lite Butter, and Egg Substitute. I make it every year the same way and nobody would ever guess that it is a "lite" stuffing!(for you WW'ers - prepared this way it is 2 points for a 1 cup serving!) I highly recommend this recipe to everyone. My children even love it!

This recipe, wih the Roast Turkey w/ Maple-Herb Butter, has been our traditional Thanksgiving dinner since 1994! My family wouldn't survive Thanksgiving without it.

I discovered this recipe back in 1994 and my family went crazy for it. I tried a different stuffing one year and everyone was disappointed. Now whenever I suggest trying something else, I get a resounding "NO". It would seem I am stuck making this deliscious stuffing for years to come. You will love the way the tart apples play on the spicy taste of the sausage. The leeks give it a bold, vegatable flavor that accents a smoked turkey rather well. I suggest it for your Thanksgiving table.

Just waiting for the opportune time to make this again. Would cut my bread slightly smaller next time and perhaps add a little more broth, but all in all it was a hit with everybody. A great change from the usual stuffing.

I couldn't buy leeks locally, and didn't want to make the 30 mile drive to the "real market", so I used some diced onion instead, and I was still very impressed. This is my new stuffing recipe!

We were delighted with how these ingredients complimented one another. The dried cranberries were especially nice adding a nice color, texture and flavor. I used a variety of bread that had been collected over time (the ends of baguettes, challah, whole wheat, cornbread, etc.)

A very nice, sophisticated stuffing. Used dried, tart cherries instead of cranberries. Worked nicely. The next time we do this we'll probably use a bit less bread.

Well, this is the 5th year in a row that I've HAD to make this stuffing. It has become such a tradition with my family that,if I even talk about making another kind, everyone gets a little sad. This is truly one of the best stuffings. It goes with everything. It is quite impressive! One thing I do is make sure you "break down" the bread with the broth. You don't want it mushy but you don't want it looking like it came out of a box either. and don't be afraid to add a little more broth to keep it moist!

I might try this again as I love all the ingredients, but I was a bit disappointed not flavorful enough -- I may have just used too much bread (I admit I didn't measure precisely!)

We've made this stuffing three years in a row now. We absolutely love it! It has now become part of our family Thanksgiving tradition. I usually make it the day before, adding the eggs and the broth the next day. It's a very simple recipe. My only suggestion is to use the best sweet Italian sausage you can find. We used a lesser quality sausage this year and noticed the difference. (But it still came out delicious!)

Very flavorful. Made this to go with the turkey suggest in the magazine (Roast Turkey with Maple Herb butter) and it was the perfect accompaniment for that dish. I stuffed some in the turkey and baked some seperately - my family prefered the batch that was in side the bird. Enjoy!

This dish was easy to make and I liked the flavor. My family, however, did not like it. The leek flavor was too strong. If I make it again, I will decrease the amount of leeks and add more of the fruit.

This is my favorite stuffing recipe - The bite of the sausage mixes so well with the tart of the apples and cranberries - much better than the bland bread stuffings my husband and his family like - he says he likes his stuffing the consistency of "mush". I find that to be rather repulsive.

I can't rave enough about this stuffing. As soon as September comes, my husband and I start to crave this wonderful combination of sausage, cranberries, and apples. This is our favorite!!!

Everyone I've ever made this recipe for loves it. I first found it in Bon Appetit in 1994 and even picky eaters in my family love it. I've played with the ingredient amounts over the years, varying the amount of cranberries, leeks, apples and sausage and it always turns out delicious. It makes a great fall side dish even if you're not serving turkey.

I combined this dish with the roast turkey w/herbed butter dish and it was superb. I had many compliments on both dishes. My friend and I have made this a few times now and it is fastly becoming a favorite for large dinner parties. The leeks give a wonderful taste and although a bit skeptical at first the final results are marvelous. I would encourage anyone to try this wonderful dish
