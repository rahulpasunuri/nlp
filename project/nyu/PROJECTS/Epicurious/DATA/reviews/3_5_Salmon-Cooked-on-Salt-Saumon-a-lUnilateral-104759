Easily one of my favorite salmon dishes. So simple, but so incredibly delicious. I serve this with brown jasmine rice and a salad with a good balsamic vinegar-based dressing, and it makes a beautiful dinner either for guests or a quickie supper for family when you're running low on time. Highly recommend!

This dish is really exceptional especially considering the simplicity of the ingredients. Though there is a good amount of smoke, it is more than worth it for flaky, moist, and flavorful salmon. Just make sure to clean the bottom of the salmon of all excess salt as just a couple grains can really overpower the fish. Also, check the fish after about 8 minutes because I did mine for 10 and thought it could have been a bit more moist.

This was one of the moistest salmon dishes I've ever had. There is a little smoke, but it isn't too bad. Super easy too.

Quick and easy- I really liked the smoky smell of the fish, but i prefer a little more flavor, so I suggest sprinkling some lemon juice onto the salmon and seasoning with salt and pepper before cooking.

Wow!This had to be the abosolute best salmon I ever had the pleasure to ingest. It was so tender and juicy so wonderfully simple and flavorful. Even my extremely picky little boys loved it, and my husband ate a large piece and started sniffing around for seconds, something that almost never happens! Lucky for me I didn't have any trouble with smoky salt, nothing but perfection from this recipe all the way around!!

My new favourite way to cook salmon. easy, quick, delicious, and uses up the copious amounts of rock salt left over from a failed Christmas present making foray into bath salts...

I think I'll try baking it in a bed of salt instead. The stove top method really was smoky. But the taste is awesome!

I just don't get it. With all the billowing smoke,I thought I'd be more impressed! Love salmon and love alot of recipes on this site. T his was just ok. It was moist but with grilling one can get the same results and a little extra texture on the outside and it looks nicer.Or you can always poach it and avoid the smoking.

This was only my second salmon dish ever and it's about the easiest recipe I can think of. The salt did get pretty smokey so I cooked with the windows open. The flavor was wonderful and very simple.

despite the smokey kitchen, the fish turned out moist and almost creamy in texture. the skin seperated from the fish easily and despite misgivings the fish was not extravagantly salty unless you eat the skin by mistake. i would definately make this dish again.

made this twice. first time it turned out great, very moist. second time the skin was already off the salmon so I used the bread idea from another review. it worked pretty well, although the top was far less moist than the bottom. still, for people with enough salt to spare, it is delightfully simple, both in preparation and flavor.

The salmon filet purchased did not have the skin on. We rolled thin 2 pieces of bread as a barrier between the filet and salt; it worked perfectly. Same wonderfully moist salmon.

I've made this several times-- it's so easy and always turns out well. My fiance prefers fish well done and with this method, it seems to stay really nice and moist.

The object is NOT to cook it thoroughly. Cook for only about 6 minutes, until the bottom is quite cooked, but the top is only heated through and fondant.

I thought this dish was phenomenal! So easy and quick. I was surprised that just salt could add so much flavor.

I thought this looked interesting, but found the result nothing special. The fish turned out a bit drier than it does using other cooking methods. Not worth using up all that salt!
