You know what? It's basic, it's easy and it's satisfying. With the sardines, I added a bit of fresh, squeezed lemon juice and it really freshened it up a bit. (You won't think the following items sounds good, but it was a nice touch) I had some fresh mint that I chiffonaded and tossed in while keeping the dish warm, then added a bit of garnish. It offset the onions in a nice way and then I even tossed in some peas I had to keep up the green color. As I type now, I hear my husband's fork scraping the plate to get it all up.

My somewhat fussy 11 yr old helped me make this and she loved it! I added a little cider vinegraitte to give it a bit of tang, only about 3 Tbsp. The longer it sits, the better it tastes.
