Made as written, except I subbed shrimp and "soyrizo" for the sausage. Found the recipe spicing perfect, but that's so subjective. Added juice from one lime at end. Quick and delicious!

Adding chorizo is a nice change from traditional fried rice recipes. Add some egg by scrambling two eggs in a bowl and moving the rice aside. Mix the egg to the rice. Chorizo is a traditional meat additive to egg recipes. Spicy and different. I will make it again using different ingrediants for variety.

A very quick and easy dish to prepare. Only one of my three boys didn't care for the paella, but I would still make this again!

This is a good base recipe that you can do a lot with. Based on the other reviews I too used ground cumin, added 2 large cloves of garlic. I had a huge red pepper and decided to roast and peel it, just love thosed roasted red peppers, added some chopped green pepper as well as chopped sun dried tomatoes, shrimp and a bit of dry white wine with a pinch of saffron dissolved in it....all in all quite tasty.

This was delicious - I can't wait to make it myself.

This is a very authentic-tasting recipe, and easy too; you can make the rice in the morning, put it in the fridge, and it'll come together in less than an hour. We love it; can't wait to try with fresh peas this spring; you might also use corn later in the year, esp. if following another reviewer's suggestion of adding shrimp. But definitely use Spanish-style, not Mexican, chorizo; the former is a drier sausage, and really makes the dish. (See La Tienda.com; get the mild rather than the spicy.) Oh, yes, the garlic, too!

great use of leftover chinese white rice. used linguica also (less fatty) and stir fried 1lb shrimp. fast delicious dinner- tastes even better next day.

I saw Sara Moulton cooked this dish on her show called, "Sara Secrets" on the Food Network. Excellent quick dish recipe. I used Linguisa sausage instead of Chorizo (our supermarket did not carry Chorizo sausages). I also substituted 1-1/2 teaspoons ground cumin for the 1 tablespoon cumin seeds (didn't have cumin seeds on hand)and added the ground cumin after browning the onions and red peppers. I also added 2 cloves minced garlic. Omitted the pumpkin seeds, but thinking about subsituting the pumpkin seeds for toasted pine nuts in the future and adding some prawns to the dish as well. Great recipe!

Very good as a side dish or stuffed in a burrito. I cooked the rice in a cumin seasoned chicken broth, to up the flavor. Also, used soyrizo, it has all the flavor, less the fat.

I'm glad I read the reviews before making this! I left out the red pepper flakes and it still was spicy. I like spice and found it to be perfect. My husband thought it was incredibly spicy but he's from the midwest.

I really liked this recipe, although my husband found it too spicy. I added 4 cloves of garlic and skipped the pumpkin seeds. I would make it again.

Mine was spin-you-around spicy--so much so that my guests only picked at it. I suppose that should earn it a demerit, but it presents so well, and I got to chow all the leftovers myself. I, for one, found it delicious!

This dish is a solid start for many things. As a stand alone product I thought it was a little bland. Use your imagination (shrimp, chicken gizzards) and some common sense (tomato sauce, chicken stock) and you can do great things with this basen recipe. Whatever you do, you have to use the old rice.

1. Great advice given about using older rice! Not too many people share that little secret and new cooks should thank you. 2. What, no seafood in this? Add a few bits of shrimp or grouper,etc. cut to bite-size and sauteed after the sausage. 3. Skip the pumpkin seeds and add 1/3 C. pinenuts toasted with the cumin. 4. Char and peel the red pepper and add near the end. 5. Minced Garlic anyone?
