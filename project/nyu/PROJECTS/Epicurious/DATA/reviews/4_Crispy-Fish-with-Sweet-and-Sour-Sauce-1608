Made it last night with haddock. Crisped up beautifully and was very tasty, especially paired with spicy mala string beans to balance the sweetness.

I've been making this with rockfish I've caught in the ocean and Chesapeake since I bought this magazine in 1991. Its awesome - fries up good - fish stays firm - sauce is great. Can't ask for too much more.

Not terrible, but... they're just fish sticks in sticky sweet sauce (not that they ever promised to be anything different). I tried some as the recipe directed and some browned and then baked. Both fine but nothing special.

A perfect marriage of sauce and crispiness. Someone else said it here, "restaurant quality". I haven't made anything fried in over 3 years because of cholesterol concerns, but I'll definitely add this to my repertoire. Ok, where does one get pineapple juice aside from buying it along with chunks or crushed pineapple? I took the advice of someone else here and used the crushed pineapple along with 1 cup called for. It added a nice texture. I'd repeat that again.

This was the best sweet and sour anything I've ever had. The sauce was not too thick or too sweet, it was just perfect. the batter on the fish was so beautiful and perfectly crispy the thought of making it soggy with a sauce broke my heart so I tossed carrots and haricot verts in with the sauce and peppers put that on the plate and topped with the crispy fish. Fabulous!

This was awesome - even my picky 11 yr old son ate 4 pieces! I actually used frozen Orange Roughy fillets I had from Trader Joes and the texture/taste was great. I had a can of crushed pineapple and used that instead of just plain juice and the the result was a wonderful sweet and sour salsa. I'd definitely use the crushed pineapple again.

I haven't written a recipe review in a long time even tho I'm a die-hard Epicurious.com fan. I'm a HUGE FAN of this recipe - loved the way the fish turned out crispy. The only change I would make next time is adding some sliced scallions (green part) for color. Other than that - totally awesome!!

Love the sauce, and use it on a lot of other seafood and meats. The fish came out olier than we prefer, so I won't fry it next time, just oven bake it.

I have never commented on any recipe that I've tried with Epicurious, but this one made me stop and holla! This dish was DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe to the letter and made no adjustments other than using fresh cod as that was what I happened to have on hand. I was so proud of myself as it appeared and tasted like restaurant quality. The breading was light, golden and crispy. This will become my standard Sweet and Sour recipe from now on. I can't wait to try it with chicken! A definite keeper for my arsenal of recipes!

I didn't care for the batter for this fish at all...I thought the breading was too think in the end and masked the true flavor of the fish. However the sauce is great...had to tweak a little (I think I added a little more vinegar, and used lime juice instead of the lemon zest), but everyone agreed it has great flavor!

This is a great recipe. The batter is light and very easy to make. I used halibut and for the sauce I skipped the tablespoon of oil and mixed all the ingredient together including the ginger and red pepper and cooked until the sauce thickened. I also added one garlic clove, a little soya sauce and ketchup. This recipe is a keeper!

The recipe for the batter is perfect. I used snapper instead of sea bass. The dish was still scrumptious.

This is by far the best batter I have tried for deep fried fish.

This recipe is delicious. The sweet and sour sauce needed to be tweaked a bit for my taste. I added more salt, some fresh lemon juice and sweetened it with brown sugar. Having leftover sauce I actually think it tasted better the next day, so making it a day ahead would be a time saver. The texture and crispness of the fish was great, although I found it didn't brown up very well. By the time you put the sauce on it doesn't matter anyway. Just a great recipe and my husband loved it. This is a nice recipe for Jasmine Rice.

Fabulous, I didn't have lemon grass, so I omitted it. I did add 1 clove galic minced to the ginger.

EXCELLENT! This dish, was simple to make (though it took a longer than I anticpated)and absolutely delicious. The fish was not to bready (the cornstarch mixture made it very light) and the sauce was perfect. I highly recommend serving with rice, the sauce goes great with it.

The batter for the fish is great. The whole family loved it which is unusual! It is quite quick to make. I served it with Jasmine Rice which complemented it well.

This was just what I expected. It was yummy and simple to make. I used 4 big fillets of sole. I didnt have ginger but The sauce was still great. I want to use the sauce with chicken or shrimp next time. This was nothing fancy, but it's sweet and sour, just like it's suppose to be.

Yum! I have been looking for a good sweet and sour sauce recipe for a long time, and this one finally made the cut for me. I did make some substitutions. Instead of pineapple juice, I used mango juice. This was inspired by a dish I had recently while on Kauai, called "mango fish". I was trying to duplicate the sauce, and this actually surpassed it. I used the Coyote Cafe's chipotle chile hot sauce as well. The batter in this recipe is perfect. I cut way down on the oil as well. Rather than deep fry, I just sauteed. At the risk of repeating myself...YUM!

The batter was pretty much perfect, as everybody else indicated: Slightly puffy, crispy, and delicious. The sauce wasn't quite what I wanted (i.e. what Mom makes) so I made the following modifications: Doubled the vinegar and the sugar Added 3 tablespoons of tomato puree Substituted hot pepper sauce with 2 tablespoons of sweet chili sauce (Maggi works really well) Used canned pineapple chunks and syrup instead of straight pineapple juice Added 1 teaspoon garlic After the sauce had reduced--perfect! Quite possibly the best Chinese food I've ever made, and it definitely rivalled my Mom's sweet and sour. This time I used halibut, but next time I'll try red snapper, cod or sea bass.

This was very good and relatively easy to prepare. I used red, yellow and green peppers and also add some of the black chinese mushrooms thinly sliced. Yum, Yum, Yum!

Yum, yum, yum. This is great. The batter is terrific. I'd like this with shrimp, pork or chicken. I used cod this time, and it was really good.

I made this recipe when an out of town friend who loves seafood came over to my house for dinner. I really do not enjoy seafood but I thought this was good. I would make it again if my guests would enjoy it. I had to use cod fillets instead of sea bass and time didn't warrant me making the sauce myself.

I love this recipe. The fish is very crispy and combine with the sauce, it's delicious!!!! It's just like in the restaurant. I'VE been looking for this kind of recipe for long time.

I have made this recipe many times and it has never failed. The batter is light and crispy and the sauce is delicious. Great with mashed potatoes to soak up the sauce.

First of all, I didn't make the sauce, so my review isn't truly complete, but I plan on trying it. The fish, (which I made with cod), was outstanding! I fryed it in my wok, and then kept each batch warm in the oven on paper towels. The batter is wonderfully light and crispy and the fish was done to perfection. Even my "I don't like fish" seven and nine year olds ate lots! This has just become my standard when I want to do a fish fry. (That's a Friday requirement, when you live in Wisconsin!)
