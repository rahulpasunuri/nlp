I loved the recipe and will make it again. Here's what I changed: Brown rice instead of white More beans I cooked the bell pepper in the rice to soften it up.

Easy enough to make, but the salad had a strange taste. I think it was overwhelmed by all the thyme. I used my usual Italian dressing (Newman's, which is wonderful) so I imagine that wasn't the problem. Was looking for a good room-temperature rice and bean salad, but I can't say this is it.

I served this with Lebanese Chicken and it was a great combination. I made it using jasmine rice and served it warm. There seemed to be something missing though, something to give that extra kick, so next time I'll add some spices and maybe thinly sliced red onions.

A very good and easy summer dish. I decreased the amount of thyme and cayenne and it was still quite good. I served it with grilled summer squash and zucchini as well as corn on the cob.

This recipe is great served cold or warm. The spiciness is just right. My teenaged son loved it and wants me to prepare it again. Cornbread on the side makes it a great little meal.

This recipe was very easy and very tasty. I used Good Seasons fat-free Italian dressing and I used alot of the cayenne pepper-because I like my food spicy. My family liked this so much that they requested that I make it for our next family picnic.

I liked this a lot, and even my husband, THE meateater, said he wouldn't mind having this 3 - 4 times a year (high praise, indeed). I served this with crisp corn-on-the-cob and cornbread stix for a satisfying meatless meal.

This reciepe is also a great vegitarian dish. I cut the cyanne pepper way down to suit my family's tounge. But it is a great, easy dish if you want something cool for summer. I highly recomend it.

This dish is great as a main course or a side dish. Go easy or heavy on the cayenne pepper, depending upon your heat tolerance. I used Paul Newman's lite Italian dressing which added a great flavor. This is a tasty, quick recipe for lazy summer evenings!
