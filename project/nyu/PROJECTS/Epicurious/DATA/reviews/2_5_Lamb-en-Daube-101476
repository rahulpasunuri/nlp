I liked it but wanted slightly different seasonings. I think next time I'd use more garlic and use rosemary instead of basil. Larding pork is pork fat, use either salt pork or bacon again. I used salt pork instead of bacon because I didn't want a smokey flavor.

Actually I think that larding just means to get a cut of the meat that has plenty of fat on the butt. Not sure though. Didn't make this recipe but thought I'd make a comment for the previous commenter.

This dish takes a long time to cook but otherwise is extremely easy to make. I didn't know what "larding pork" was, nor did my butcher, so I omitted that and it turned out fine. I would add another carrot next time but otherwise it was very good.
