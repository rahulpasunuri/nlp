Too bland! I had to perform an emergency seasoning infusion after the duck was cooked. Next time I'd add onions, a bit more wine and a little broth (chicken or vegetable) to braise the duck in. I ran the meat through the coarse die of my meat grinder (instead of hand-shredding), added some of the reserved liquid to make it moister, seasoned with allspice and fine herbs to taste. I'd leave out the fatback altogether, pork ruins the health benefits of duck fat and is unnecessary.

I'm assuming my big mistake was thinking that duck was so fatty that I didn't need the fatback. I cooked the duck without it, and found the preliminary tasting so bland that I panicked. The fatback must add the flavor. Managed to save the dish by making a reduction of the liquid/fat with additional garlic, adding cognac, and seasoning the duck very well with additional s&p. Point is: don't skip the fatback and expect something tasty!

Time consuming but not difficult. The taste is well worth the effort. A great dish for an informal wine party.

I made this with a pair of wild frozen ducks that had been stored for a year and mistakenly used salt pork instead of fresh fatback. I also used a pressurer cooker instead of the oven. The birds shredded beautifully and the flavor is intense, sophisticated and yet rustically appealing. Since there are 4 more of last year's ducks still in the freezer, I'll make this again.
