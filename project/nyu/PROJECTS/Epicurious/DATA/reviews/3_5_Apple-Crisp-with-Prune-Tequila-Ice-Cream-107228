Next time I will use granny smiths-like the tartness of that apple better than than the fuji. But no complaints from the crowd that polished it off.

This is our new household standard with a few adaptations: I substitute half the flour with oatmeal, use a little less butter and don't toast the pecans beforehand, as they toast plenty while baking. To the filling, I add a dash of nutmeg,vanilla and a splash of orange liquer (Grand Marnier, Cointreau, Triple Sec) to enhance the zest. This also works beautifully with a half apple/half pear fruit mixture. The ice cream is a wonderful accompaniment, but a little whipped cream is really all that's needed. It's also good with plain yogurt on the leftovers for breakfast.

Not my favorite crisp recipe, ice cream was amazing though

I had never made a crisp before, left out the pecans and orange zest and it was "dynamite" to quote one of my dinner guests. Not to mention, very easy to prepare and hands-off during dinner.

Greatest crisp my family and I have ever had!

I too made only the crisp - it's very good! I found the chopped pecans in particular add a much better flavor and texture than oatmeal. This is now my standard recipe for apple crisp.

i didn't make the ice cream, but the crisp was wonderful. i substituted chopped crystalized ginger for the pecans, and oats for 1 1/3 cups of the flour. served it at a potluck, and heard many "who made the apple crisp?!"

I was disappointed. I didn't have pecans so replaced with oatmeal which should have been fine but this crisp was so dry and crumbly it felt like each bite was just a mouthful of crumbs and I could barely taste the fruit. I definitely won't make this again.

All right, I'm only rating the filling, which is absolutely fabulous. I've made this a few times -to *rave* reviews - using Galas, Fujis, and always Deborah Madison's superb crisp topping from her book Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone (Broadway, 1997). The orange zest lends the filling surprising depth, making this dish elegant and perfect for autumn.

This was delicious! I left out the orange zest because it didn't want a really complex flavored crisp, and it was perfect. Didn't make the prune ice cream either, but I did serve the crisp hot out of the oven with good vanilla ice cream and plenty of whipped cream. Yummy!

It was wonderful.....i altered it alittle by these changes: 1 Tbsp orange marmelade instead of the orange zest only 1 cup of pecans, plus 1 cup of uncooked oatmeal added to flour mixture lots more cinnamon...at least a Tbsp. all together....everyone loved it alot:)

At a dinner party for 12 I had raving compliments on this dessert. I added 5-6 plums(unpeeled),cut into 1/2" wedges, which gave the apples a lovely red hue and added great flavor to the Gala apples I used. I also sprinkled some sliced almonds on top! Have been asked to DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN SOON! Thank you epicurious.
