Sorry, but these are nothing special. I wanted something "different" this year for gifts to the neighbors and co- workers. I did not include these cookies on the cookie trays. The cookies were extremely difficult to slice 1/4 inch thick. I probably should have chopped the pistachios before mixing them into the dough. Husband said he would only eat these if there weren't any other cookies in the house.

I have made these cookies for the last 4 years to rave reviews. The contrast between the sweet cranberries to the salted pistachios and buttery shortbread is wonderful.

This recipe is a winner! I made it exactly according to the directions and had great results. I used sugar "in the raw" for the decorative suger. To me, this is a cookie for an adult palate; it is not overly sweet, nor overly buttery. Think of it as a modified shortbread. I have gotten several requests for the recipe, so I know others like it too.

After a couple of batches, I don't bother to do the egg wash/sugar on edges. Good recipe as is, but also made some with chopped dried apricots and chopped dried cranberries, using kitchen shears - good reviews! I agree these are good keeper cookies, and easy-peasy.

I think these are beautiful and taste just great. I got many compliments this year on these. And they are easy. I rolled them in turbinado sugar for a rustic decorative look. And used raw pistachios. Someone told me that the raw ones would keep their green color better than using roasted ones. And I did have nice greenish pistachios in the cookies that look really festive with the cranberries.

I thought these were dreadful. I followed the recipe exactly and even double checked to see if I left something out. The cranberries turned to shoe leather baking and the cookie was tasteless. A waste of good pistachios.

I've been making these cookies for the past three years at Christmas, and everyone, without fail, raves about them. Not only are they delicious they are beautiful and festive. My only twist on this recipe is to use orange-flavored dried cranberries from Trader Joe's. They add enough of the elusive orange flavor that is so hard to get from zest alone. When I use the TJ cranberries I just dispense with the zest altogether. The dough seems to be a good base cookie... I may try making these with ginger instead of cinnamon and candied ginger bits and pecans instead of the cranberries and pistachios.

Rating: 2
The dough was easy to make and after I refrigerated them for 24 hours they sliced easily. I baked them on parchment paper at 350 and the bottoms came out a bit dark. The taste is okay, nothing special. Not sure I will use these in my cookie swap.

You should make these cookies!!! I wanted to simplify my Christmas this year and wanted some key items that would be easy to make ahead and still be delicious. This is absolutely the yummiest cookie I've made this year. I did add at least double the orange zest, and it was perfect. For those of you also wanting to simplify, I also made the following equally yummy cookie recipes from this site, shaped into logs and frozen: Rosemary Shortbread (yummmm!!), Chocolate Hazelnut, and Lemony Slice-and-Bakes. I will bring them out and bake the day before my company comes.

These cookies tasted pretty good. I left out the egg wash and decorating sugar partly because I couldn't find the special sugar and secondly because many of the reviewers said it was sweet enough as it is. However I didn't find them to be sweet enough, not sure if this is because I used salted pistachios. Also, I didn't taste the orange zest, I would use more next time.

This was the cookie I couldn't stop eating! Out of lots of cookies I make every year, this is my favorite. I make it with dried cherries, due to family member who cannot eat crangberries. I recommend chopping the cherries and pistachios before adding, because they don't slice well with the dough, if added whole.

When I first made them I thought they were ok. But their flavor develops over time--and now, two weeks after making them I think they are delicious. They keep super well, and get better and better. If you are baking ahead, make these first.

I was disappointed, though I baked these using a silpat for the first time, and this may be the problem. They turned out hard. Very pretty however, used a mixture of red and green sugar crystals. They looked like gems.

My favourite Christmas cookie- I accidently made the same cookie from a different recipe and was sooo disappointed- very happy to find this original one again! Chop your pistachios roughly- it will make slicing the dough bar easier. Get a heavy knife out and push straight down hard- don't saw or go too slow- you need to cut through those nuts and berries without crumbling your dough. These are pretty, tasty, and quite simple.

Rating: 4
I have made this every year since the recipe came out and everyone loves these; excellent flavor and texture, a festive and delicate cookie. Cigi from Chicago, I hope you see this because I'm looking for the biscotti recipe that you mentioned with the same ingredients; is it anywhere on this website? I've seen several, but not with the exact ingredients; I would love to try this version of biscotti OR alternately translate this recipe to biscotti from someone that knows how? I've never made it before.

Wonderful, buttery, crisp, and melt in your mouth (except for the nuts & cranberries) cookies. The texture is like a shortbread, but lighter and better. I made them as is -- except (there's always an except) for adding more orange zest. I also chopped the nuts & cranberries, per others suggestions. Probably would have been fine not doing that as well. I had no problems with crumbly-ness, or shaping it into a square log, or even slicing. Just refrigerate overnight and use the sharpest knife you have. If it's very sharp, you don't even need to rotate the log (I didn't). They come out just as pictured!

I love these cookies. So easy to put together and the flavour is fantastic. I chilled the logs for just under two hours and they were super easy to cut - no cracks or breakage. I definitely think they taste and look better without the decorative sugar.

The flavor is delicious but they are extremely difficult to handle as they crumble too easily. They won't be in the boxes I have to ship cross country. One bite and they fall all over the place. MY second pan the sugar melted into the egg wash and looked really weird. I'm just glad they taste good.

Use 1 1/4 sticks butter, 3/4 cup minus 2 tablespoons. Add 1 egg yolk and it will provide a more stable dough that will slice beautifully. They were too delicate without it. Fifteen minutes is usually enough cooking time. Delicious and pretty.

Chocolate report: I doubled the recipe and added a 4oz 80% dark chocolate bar (chopped fine, sifted in a sieve to remove dust). The chocolate was very good, but it's too many flavors. I recommend choosing two out of the three (pistachios, cranberries, chocolate). I agree the cinnamon could be dropped in favor of more zest. +++ I chopped the nuts, which helped in slicing. I did plump the cranberries (in wine and cranberry juice, as we had no Grand Marnier), then drained and chopped. +++ The dough is very moist. To make square logs: put half the dough in a rough log in waxed paper, then roll tight and smooth two opposite sides with your hand, roll a quarter turn and repeat until you have a square, then unroll from paper to get wrinkles out of the dough, roll back up and square off again, freeze). +++ I froze overnight, then set out to thaw about 20 minutes; that was a good cutting consistency (use a large, heavy sharp knife). +++ The decorating sugar (/Sugar in the Raw) was really needed; I baked half with and half without. It caramelizes a bit on the outside. To sugar the cookies: slice the nearly-frozen cookies, then dip each edge in sugar. This was quick, even, and much less messy than sugaring the whole roll. A good job for a little helper as well. +++ Do not overcook; remove when the centers are still pale. The darker cookies were not worth eating, even for Mr. Overdone (my husband). These were easy and tasty, a sophisticated take on chocolate chip cookies.

These are shortbread cookies with additions. Very pretty and festive. Taste is ... well, shortbread-y. My pistachios weren't salted; had they been I may have given this recipe 4 forks. As they were, I found them very "solid" tasting. I found cutting them thicker made for less crumbling as well as for preserving their square shape in baking.

I just made these again, and they are so good and easy! They are a huge hit with the family, and they look so festive too. This time I added some crystallized ginger; good but not necessary. The recipe is great just as it is. The dough keeps well in the freezer too. This recipe is a keeper.

I've officially traded in the biscotti recipe with the same ingredients for this one!! So much tastier and delicate. I rolled 2 sides in red sugar and the other two in green. Really festive. Didn't have the trouble others had...in the frig for 3 hours,sharp knife, rotated. Love it!

These cookies were an instant hit! I omitted the cinnamon and put in double the zest. Perfect Christmas cookies.

Made a trial run of this recipe tonight - considering it for a cookie exchange party. It is a winner! They are delicious, very much like a shortbread. Based on other reviewers input, I did not add cinnamon, but added same amount of vanilla. Next time I will soak cranberries in a bit of orange liquer to enhance the orange flavor (it was very sublte). Loved them, company loved them, they are pretty to boot!

I really loved these cookies. I made them a day before I baked them. I only had a few that crumbled when cutting. Cutting them a little thicker is better than thinner. The cookies that crumbled were the ones that were less than 1/4". I doubled the recipe as one batch doesn't yield enough. I added 2 tbsp of Grand Marnier to the dried cranberries to boost the orange flavor. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. One batch I dipped in green sprinkles and the other batch in red sprinkles. It made a nice presentation. They were very tasty and festive looking. Everyone loved the contrast between the salty and sweet. I would definitely make them again.

I loved these cookies. I thought that they were tasty, sophisticated, and pretty. They also have nice, festive colors for Christmas. I liked the cinamon flavor, but if I was to make these in warm weather I might leave it out. I made my dough the night before and then had no trouble at all when I went to slice it the next day. I also omitted the sugar step, and I thought that they were fine without it. In fact, one of my friends said that they were glad that I skipped it becuase the cookies didn't need it. The recipe doesn't make a whole lot of cookies, so I might double it next time. These will probably become a Christmas staple.

Rating: 4
These are delicious! Good buttery taste and blend of flavors. Modifications: I added some chopped crystalized ginger to it which was tasty. Since other reviewers mentioned that they fall apart, I chopped the nuts and fruit before adding to the dough. I also refrigerated mine overnight and then sliced with a very sharp Chef's knife. That helped, but I had a few fall apart. They don't spread and stick back together too well when you bake them, so those were the "duds" I sampled afterwards. The crystalized ginger I added may have also been too much to keep the dough sticking together, so maybe next time I will keep the ginger but reduce the nuts and cranberries so there is more dough to keep it all together. I will make these again!

A friend made these cookies, and they were heavenly, so I thought I'd give it a try. I had no problem cutting the logs, but when I baked them, they just *melted* :-( When I used the spatula to lift them off the cookie sheet, they crumbled to dust. I've never been a cookie failure; what am I doing wrong?

These are really delicious and the dough is so very easy to make. I have a batch in the oven right now. My cookies did not stay square even though I thoroughly chilled the dough (overnight) and the heavy-duty cookie sheets before slicing. I am going to make another batch (to make up for all the samples I have been tasting - lol). I will increase the orange zest and make the next batch a round log instead of square. I don't think these need the extra sugar, but it looks pretty.

Rating: 4
As suggested, I chopped the nuts and plumped the cranberries. I had no trouble shaping the roll, but waited until the next day to slice and bake. We loved them. I made them again, but doubled the recipe and used white whole wheat flour. I also tried chopped crystallized ginger as mentioned, in one of the rolls which everyone enjoyed as well. Again, I waited until the next day to bake and had no problem slicing them. The looked really festive with green or red sugar on the edges. These are a hit!

Rating: 3
The problem with most cookies is they are too sweet and have a prominent butter flavor. These are excellent because they taste sweet and buttery but neither overpower the cookie. The cookie crumbled when I sliced it but I had no problem pushing the little pieces back together; also, I made two logs and didn't put egg wash and sugar on the second log and it tasted delicious without it (in fact it didn't taste much different, so that step can be omitted). Pistachios and cranberries are to the cookie world what peanut butter and jelly are to the sandwich world.

Rating: 4
Like many of the other reviewers, I had problems with the cookies crumbling apart as I was slicing them because the nuts were difficult to slice cleanly. I also made my cookies too small (my log was about 1.5" instead of 2"), which made the problem worse. Next time I'll be sure to make my cookie log big enough so that there is enough dough to reshape the cookie after crumbly slicing! Despite the slicing problems, this recipe was a big hit (definitely worth it if you like shortbread-type cookies) and I will be making it again this week.

Rating: 4
these are delicious and so pretty, and perfect with coffee in the morning :) i added a bit more orange zest and just a pinch more sugar, and the pistachios i used were already salted--the tangyness of the cranberries, the salty pistachios, and buttery, sugary cookie are ADDICTIVE! chilled the dough for a day; no problems slicing them or having the cookies fall apart.

These are really tasty and easy to make. Made them for a cookie exchange where I had to make 9 dozen cookies! I cooked them at a lower temperature, and for a shorter time because my first batch burned. I also cut the cookies, brushed the top with egg, and put sugar on top. When I rolled the dough log it sugar, the sugar burned. I also "plumped" the cranberries (with triple sec) like other reviewers, and liked the results. I'll try with cherries next time.

Rating: 4
Delish and not too sweet. I used 1/2 cinnamon like some suggested. Used leftover whole cranberries that I had frozen after Thanksgiving. Worked fine. No prob cutting to 1/4 inch but I had slightly chopped cranberries and pistachios a little before mixing them into dough. Make sure that you pack the dough well when rolling it into bar so that it is compact enough to stay together when cutting and after baking. Make sure the cookies are golden brown on edges before removing.

Epicurious should have a function where users upload their own pictures - then we would know what a recipe looks like when normal people make it... these were not square, and it's impossible to cut the cookies with all those chunks in them. Last but not least, they taste just bleh.

Fantastic! I served these cookies at a party with 3 other types of cookies and these were the first ones gone. They even beat out the chocolate chip cookies. To half of the batch I added some chopped crystallized ginger. It was good both ways. Definitely adding this to the holiday cookie repertoire.

This recipe is sooo easy and delicious! I made the following modifications: added a tiny bit more sugar (maybe upped it to about 1/3 C), added more cinnamon, and added chopped crystallized ginger to the mix. SOOOO good. Everyone loves these cookies!

Excellent recipe! Numerous batches for family (a holiday expectation now) and for parties of 60+. Doubling the zest is worthwhile. Note about the butter. Tried using a european style butter (higher fat, lower moisture) but found that had less benefit than simply controlling temperature (extra 5-10 minutes in refrig as needed, worth the patience), and whipping the butter/sugar mixture until truly pale and strand-like texture. That (and chopping the cranberries and pistachios as suggested) seems to solve the "crumbly" problem. For my next batch, I'll be adding a hint of fresh rosemary (finely minced) for a new surprising finish to a meal (and will serve with a citrus sorbet).

go light on the cinnamon, add 1/3 cup chopped crystallized ginger (chips for baking), and then substitute lemon zest for the orange. I accidentally added the egg to the dough, with 1/2 t. of baking powder and it still produced a light cookie. if you let the logs of dough sit out for a few minutes you can press in the sugar without brushing them with egg. for the decorative sugar, I used raw turbinado. these really changed my opinion on what cookies can be.

These cookies were a huge hit. They were beautiful and delicious and easy to make. I doubled the orange zest as others suggested and resisted the urge to add more cinnamon so they wouldn't be too dark. I also chopped the pistachios and cranberries and used turbinado sugar for the coating. Thanks to other reviewers for those suggestions. I would not skip the decorative sugar since it's so easy to do and adds such a pretty look. They were a little difficult to slice because they would fall apart, but they pinched back together very easily. Next time I won't bother making them square since they didn't look very square once I sliced and baked. Baked for 14 minutes.

I love these cookies. I rec'd them last year at a cookie exchange and made a few batches last year and this year. I thought they were very easy to make, no problems at all. I will say, though, the thinner I sliced them the more careful I had to be. I also did not bother forming them in to a square. And, I substituted chopped dried cherries for the cranberries (personal preference). They are beautiful and tasty.

These are excellent!! I followed the recipe exactly (except I used the entire zest of one orange) and they came out perfect! I refrigerated the dough for @3-4 hours--it sliced very easily with no problem whatsoever (I used a sharp Henckles slicing knife). I also found it easier(and it looked better)to just sprinkle on the sugar--I used a combo of red and green regular deco sugar since I didn't have coarse sugar. I used raw pistachios (from Trader Joe's) which come in a bag and most are already halved--perhaps this is why I didn't have any problem as others had). Also, I used insulated cookie sheets and cookies came out perfect! The pistachio cranberry combination is very pretty visually and taste-wise also, and my husband and I both loved the texture of the cookie! Although the cranberries are a bit chewy (next time I'll try the grand marnier soaking suggestion!), it's still enjoyable that way, and because this cookie is not so sweet, it is a welcome change! I'd definitely make these again and I'm adding this to my annual Christmas cookie inventory!

I wrapped these in parchment paper, then plastic wrap followed by tin foil before freezing them (just over 3 weeks). When I was ready to take them off, I just removed the tin foil and plastic wrap.

I really liked the flavour of these cookies, however, there was enough about them that was annoying that I wouldn't bother repeating this recipe. Like some of the other reviewers, I found the dough very crumbly and therefore difficult to shape and slice easily (the pistachios did exacerbate this problem). I found I had to "reshape" each slice after slicing. Also, the raw sugar didn't adhere properly and ended up getting pressed randomly into the slices as I worked on them (frankly, I think the cookies are sweet enough as is, so I personally wouldn't bother with the extra sugar for prettiness). FYI, I did freeze the dough for about a week before defrosting and baking.

Rating: 3
I didn't have any problems with my dough like others, and I followed the recipe almost exactly; the only exceptions that I didn't measure out the cranberries and pistachios with measuring cups but scales, and used 2 1/2 ounces of pistachios as well as not cutting it into a square log but shaping it into one. The cooking time seemed a bit too long so they were too browned and tasted a bit burnt, but with less time they were fine. I had difficulty slicing the cookies because the knife sometimes wouldn't smoothly cut throught a pistachio and break it out of the dough, but a sharper knife could solve that problem.

I used red and green decorative sugar on the outside and the red especially was quite pretty.

This recipe was GREAT. We've made lots of shortbread-style cookies like this in the past, and I think it's just what people are used to. We followed the recipe to the "T" but didn't bother with the sugar on the edges, and they still tasted great. Nice colour, flavour and texture.

These were very easy to make. I did not find cranberries and used dried cherries, which are delicious, but not as tart as the cranberries. They were also not as red, but the cookies were light and buttery and not too sweet. I am going to dip them halfway in chocolate to up the sugar a little.

I quadrupled this receipe. I needed lots for a cookie exchange and gifts for friends and neighbors. I thought these were quick and easy. I added too much salt and cinnamon to the 1st doubled receipe -- and to both batches I more than doubled the orange zest and added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla (otherwise followed it as written). They (both batches)came out fabulous! Just the right size for eating and gifting. Pretty and festive. Will make these my new Christmas cookie (used to make pistachio biscotti and it was way too much work). Try them!

I made these cookies following the recipe and was delighted with how they tasted and looked. Excellent flavor and crumb- similar to a shortbread cookie. You can't beat the simplicity of a slice and bake cookie, and I thought that the festive cranberry and pistachio colors, the sugary edge and rectangular shape gave these a an extra special twist. This recipe has been added to my file.

I read the other reviews. I reviewed the ingredients again. The ratio of fat to sugar and fat to flour seemed within range and liked most of the other ingredients so I tried it. I didn't use any cinnamon but added a teaspoon or so of vanilla extract and used lime zest instead of orange zest. The cookies turned out wonderfully. The cranberries and pistachios are a very nice combination both in appearance and in taste. 100% will make them again. Great recipe!! Thanks.

I was a little hesitant to make this cookie after reading one of the reviews, but luckily, the cookies turned out great and everybody loved them. There was no problem with the dough -- other than I added too much cinnamon which turned it a bit brown, but it didn't affect the cooking or taste. The only problem I had was the crumbly dough when I cut the pieces, but if you put them together on the cookie sheet, it will just meld together anyway, so it didn't matter. And I used Sugar In the Raw instead of decorative sugar (and didn't need the egg to keep the sugar on -- just be careful not to press too hard or the log will break!). I am making more and freezing the dough!!

Keeping in mind and respecting that everyone has different tastes ... here is my experience with these beautiful "looking" but (in my humble opinion) not so tasty cookies: I am also an experienced cook and rarely find a recipe from Gourmet that I don't care for. However, this is one of them. I followed the recipe exactly. I did not have any of the "crumbly" problems as mentioned by another reviewer but I do agree that the ratio of flour was a bit much; it gave the cookies a raw flour taste and, therefore, quite disappointing. The wonderful ingredients could not even overcome the dough problem. When removed from Silpat immediately after baking and cooled on wire racks, they set up just fine for me. As mentioned in another review, they do bake golden on the bottom and are pale on the top when baked at 18 minutes but this was not a problem. Since these cookies are quite delicate, I would not recommend them for shipping. In addition, I found that the sugar crystals gave them a gritty and unpleasant texture (yes, I did use professional decorating sugar crystals as suggested). Unfortunately, after only one taste ... my family of food lovers would not touch them again. They all gave a thumbs down on this one. May I suggest one of the other cookies instead. Sorry Gourmet!

I followed the recipe almost exactly and found them delicious! I had no flour problems. Since I didn't have any oranges I used lemon zest and I added 1/4 tsp or so of cardamom powder. I was only planning to use half the dough and freeze the rest, but my husband ate so many I had to bake them all to have enough for my party!

I made these cookies and I thought they were great. I have to disagree with the other review - I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't have any problems. Some of mine did get a little dark on the bottom, but since it was only the ones on the one shelf, I have to blame my cheap cookie sheets and oven, not the recipe. I'm actually not big on pistachios or cranberries, but I wanted a quick dessert for a dinner party and these didn't take anytime at all (and there were only a few left afterwards). I'd definitely make them again. The green of the pistachios and the ruby-red of the cranberries made them really festive.

These were a disaster. I am an experienced and advanced baker so it's not that I didn't know what I was doing. Problem #1: There was WAY too much flour called for in this recipe. The dough, because it does not use eggs, does not have much moisture so the amount of flour called for cannot be added. I foolishly added all of it and had a crumbly mess on my hands. I added 1/4 cup of water and still did not have a decent dough. With the help of some plastic wrap, I pressed it into a log as best I as could and chilled it overnight. I was in fact able to slice the cookies for baking. But then I ran into ... Problem #2: the bottoms were brown and the tops were pale white. That being said, the cookies DO have a nice flavor. The pistachios and dried cranberries go together very well, both visually and flavor-wise, and the orange zest and cinnamon add a hint of holiday spice. My suggestsions for improvement: 1) do not add 1 1/2 cups of flour - I suggest 1 cup to start with and then add a few teaspoons at a time until the dough is firm; 2) flip the cookies halfway through baking for an even color.
