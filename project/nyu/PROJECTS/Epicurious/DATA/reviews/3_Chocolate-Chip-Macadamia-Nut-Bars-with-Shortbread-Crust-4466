I have made this recipe several times now. It is so easy. 50 minutes is definitely too long. Try 40 minutes. Otherwise the bars are hard and just not as decadent seeming. I also use pecans. This is a great base for all sorts of experimentation. Definitely a very rich bar.

A little too rich and dense for us, I agree that the chocolate was overpowering. I also think 50 minutes is a little too long in the oven - I would recommend checking them sooner.

I liked the concept of this bar, but didn't like the outcome as much as I would have hoped. I did double the amount with the hopes of cooking it in a 9x13 instead of an 8x8, but wasn't thrilled with the results. If I make them again, I will stick with the recipe and not do anything different.

This recipe seems to closely match a decadent toffee bar sometimes found out at Starbuck's. I'd recommend using a premium chocolate of choice ("eyeball" it some, so's not to add too much...same with the nuts as well). Try adding the toffee chips. A bit of coconut too might score as a variation. Yummm!

Unlike almost all other reviewers I didn't think the chocolate was overwhelming in the least. Of course, I guess I could be considered a choc-a-holic (or close). On the other hand, I used a 6.5 oz jar of macadamia nuts (.5 oz less that what recipe called for) and I would consider the nut ratio border line on being to much. The bars were good, not great. I think I overbaked them a little so they probably didn't come out exactly like they should've - guess that makes my review a bit less reputable.

True this recipe was easy to make and good, but I think I was expecting a little more than just good. Aren't macadamia nuts and chocolate suppose to be one of the most heavenly tasting things on earth? I agree with all of the other comments, the amount of chocolate used is way too much. I used twice the amount of macadamia's as suggested and still the nuts had to compete with the chocolate. I'll try this again...

The bars are easy to make. My husband raved. I think I would use dark chocolate chips next time, and maybe less than called for, as I thought the chocolate seemed to over power the macadamia nuts.

I tried this recipe for a family gathering. Received rave reviews from all. I used Callebault milk chocolate cut into pieces instead of the chocolate chips since my family loves milk chocolate. I also topped this with a mixture of semi-sweet chocolate chips, finely ground macadamias (whatever I had left over), and melted butter just at the end of baking. I put it under the broiler to brown. It made a pretty topping.
