I only gave this two forks as is because it needed some help. To the yogurt I added red onion and capers and this was a big hit a my last cocktail party. Especially with friends that are on low carb diets.

Try the pepperocinis with smoked salmon - MUCH better than this. For those that don't like the heat of the peppers, substitute the filling of that recipe for the filling in this one.

When I made this I used 1/2 yogurt and half sour cream. Added some Mc Cormic's salad seasoning and also added some chopped capers,It was a smash hit

This dish was inedible! Nobody in our crowd (eight of us) would eat it. If you're thinking of making this look for another recipe or at the very least use sour cream or cream cheese instead of the yogurt and cut way back on the dill.
