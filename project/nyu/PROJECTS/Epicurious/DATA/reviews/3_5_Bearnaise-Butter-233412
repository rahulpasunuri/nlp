Yum! Can hardly wait to put into the fingerling potatoes tomorrow and on the Tyler Florence pork chops. I didn't have wine vinegar but had wine and rice vinegar. I did a split of the two and after mixing just had to taste! MMMMMM. I think I'm a new lover of Tarragon! Oh by-the-way, I used the food processor to blend; worked fine.

The butter is a wonderful addition to potatoes, and vegetables. I did need to whip with an electric beater to combine the butter and vinegar. Afterward, I froze to use in other dishes and sauces.

The flavor of this compound butter is just superb. I took to-heart another reviewer's comment about whipping the butter to incorporate the vinegar reduction. The result? A whipped butter. (Duh!) The texture is brittle, difficult to work with. Instead of slicing into perfect coins, even when using a knife dipped in hot water, each slice seemed to crumble, as it was cut. Next batch, I will experiment with ways to rectify the crumble problem - perhaps barely whip it, or, let it sit out at room temperature +-15-to-20 minutes before slicing it.

Would defintely freeze the leftovers. Delicious with steamed asparagus!

I could not get the vinegar to incorporate into the butter until I used my high speed electric mixer with the whisk attachment. The result was a fabulous whipped butter. The recipe says "mix." I tried that for 3 hours without success.

Great stuff. I've been making this for years and almost always have some on hand in the fridge. It freezes well, too. Just roll it up in plastic wrap like a log and cut off serving size discs as needed. It's great on just about anything: steaks, baked & pan fried fish (especially salmon), sauteed chicken breast, veggies, etc. It's also indispensible as a final enrichment swirled into reductions & pan sauces and gravies.
