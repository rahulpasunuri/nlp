light, not a heavy sauce, but a bit bland. Needs more flavor/spices

Rating: 3
I have made this dish a number of times with a few modifications. I usually use penne pasta. I dredge the chicken in some flour mixed with salt and pepper before sauteing it. This helps in a number of ways, the sauce sticks to the chicken better, the flour also helps the thicken the sauce, not to mention the benefits of a little seasoning. I don't add the garlic until the chicken is almost done and make sure to keep the pan in motion after I add the garlic. Remove the chicken. I add the wine, let it reduce a bit before adding the other liquids, sometimes I add some lemon or meyer lemon juice.

THANK YOU for this recipe! I've been looking for a recipe to resemble a fusilli dish we used to get at our favorite Italian restaurant. I modified this recipe so instead of chicken and broccoli, I used steak, cherry tomatoes, and rosemary. My husband was skeptical but we both loved it. It's a nice THIN but creamy and flavorful sauce. I think a picture and description of this recipe would be helpful as I saw a lot of comments complaining about it not getting thick. It's not supposed to be. Then by adding cornstarch or flour to it, I can only imagine it would dilute it and taste terrible. So, if you are looking for a thick and creamy cheesy pasta sauce, look elsewhere. You probably won't like this.

I liked the general concept of this meal but I didn't exactly follow the directions, as per the previous reviews. I marinated my chicken in olive oil, chopped garlic, salt/pepper and a splash of white wine overnight. For the sauce, I used equal parts of white wine, chicken broth and whole milk (no whipping cream on hand) then added in a couple tablespoons of Smart Balance butter and a teaspoon of flour. My sauce thickened up after about 10 minutes and was delicious over the broccoli chicken and pasta. I'm surprised the recipe doesn't call for any black pepper but maybe it's common sense? I added several cranks of the pepper mill to finish this off. Again, a great recipe concept and I was really pleased with my take on it. Delicious!

i did not actually make this recipe, but took the sauce recipe. it was slightly thin, but in hindsight, using less broth (you could use a more concentrated one if you made the broth), more cheese and simmering longer. I simmered longer than it called for, but still had to add some cornstarch

Rating: 3
In spite of the thinness of the sauce, this was delicious. The flavor was bright and healthy, and the recipe was simple to execute with ingredients on hand. I might try to add 2-3 tablespoons of flour with the oil and garlic (after the chicken is cooked), and cook for 2 minutes before whisking in the liquid ingredients next time, to thicken the sauce.

This was way too runny and not really creamy at all. I would deglaze with 1/4 cup wine, and add a cup more cream. The chicken broth was just too much liquid. You could almost skip it and thin the sauce with pasta water.

As written, this is a very strange recipe. It's like the chef came up with an idea but never tested and perfected it. I made it because I had some chicken and broccoli to use up, and I love garlic; I read the reviews and thought I'd see what I could do with it. First of all, where is the seasoning? It needs salt, pepper, maybe 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper, definitely a bit of nutmeg to finish. Second, salt and pepper your chicken while it's still raw, or it will be super-bland. Third, cutting the chicken into 1-inch chunks makes way more sense; you'll brown (and get garlicky) more surfaces if the chunks are smaller. Last, all the timings seem incorrect. It takes more than 3 minutes to cook this chicken through (not much, but definitely more), and it takes WAY longer than 8 minutes to thicken this sauce. As a learning experience, it was useful; doctored up this way and covered with copious parm-regg, it was pretty good. But I wouldn't make it again.

I substituted sour cream for the whipping cream, and added a full 1/2 cup of hand-grated parmesan. It was soupy but very flavorful! My 3.5 year old pronounced it "very good"

Rating: 2
After reading several reviews, I opted to add the wine and chicken broth to the pan first and boil it down a bit before adding the cream. Even with this, and boiling the liquid for a long time (15 minutes), it was still quite thin. I really didn't want to add more starch to a pasta dish to thicken it so we ate it as is. It was quite garlicky; good but not fantastic. I might try it again, but will work on the sauce - I will reduce the liquid more before adding cream; probably would add some seasoning other than garlic to spice it up a bit.

This recipe turned out just as expected, and it was delicious. I read the previous reviews and many mentioned that the sauce was runny, from restaurant experience I know that Garlic cream sauce should be a little runny. I used linguine instead of the suggested noodle, and added pinenuts. My Husband and I both thought it was delicious!

After reading the first few reviews, I decided not to make this recipe but to doctor another found on this site; try the orecchiette pasta w/ peas, ham, & cream and sub chicken for the ham and broccoli for the peas. (Cook broccoli for 5 minutes in the water with the pasta, then add to sauce w/ pasta.) This worked well for us.

Sauce was horrible - threw it away before mixing. Salvaged the chicken & garlic and made my OWN sauce. Do not recommend.

Taking cue from others, I made some changes and ultimately was quite pleased. Added some butter w/ the cream; and salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg at the end. Also, found it thin so added cornstarch, which helped. Remember: if you're relying on parm chz in container (like Kraft) it's bound to be bland. Use good parm, grate it yourself, and it will make a big difference.

Well, yeah, it was a little thin, but it was also delicious. Patience makes the cream sauce-- if it isn't thick enough after 8 minutes, wait some more, it'll get thicker.

This was a pasta SOUP with broccoli and chicken..what a waste of time and expensive ingredients....if you have a discriminating palate and are use to having nice thick cheese sauces, then make a simple alfredo sauce with butter, cream and cheese and then add your fav ingredients or you will be truley disappointed

Great dish, with a few tweaks! For the sauce I used 8 oz. cream cheese, 1/2 cup of butter (melted together) then added 1/2 cup of parm cheese and 2 cups of milk. Let it simmer on the stove until thickened. I also added shallots when I sauteed the chicken. Great with whole grain pasta, covers the taste nicely. And definitely add more garlic!!

MY SAUCE DIDN'T THICKEN EITHER!!! Even after taking the word of past reviewers & adding cornstarch, as well as at least 15 minutes heating trying to reduce. :-( The other changes I made were to increase whipping cream, broth, and wine (used dry vermouth) by 1/3 each since others said they needed more sauce - I added extra garlic when sautéing the chicken - and some cayenne and salt & pepper to the sauce as it was TRYING to thicken (and still it turned out bland). When all ingredients were mixed together, my freshly grated parmesan (from Trader Joe's) got GOBBERY and didn't mix well into the sauce at all (probably a good part of the thickening problem!) and a lot stayed like a rubbery layer on the bottom of the pan (used a Le Creuset enamel base pan) even though I stirred it constantly. When we first went to serve this, the sauce was thin enough to keep dripping off the serving spoon, but when my honey went for seconds however (surprised he did even) we found the pasta had absorbed all of the extra liquid and the pasta and broccoli was no longer al dente. The honey said if he were to make it, he'd tripple the garlic and add more salt and pepper. I thought it also could've used more broccoli (used a whole crown), and maybe even more chicken, but he said he just would've cut the chuncks smaller. I won't make this again. Too bland, too weird of a sauce issue everyone's having. No doubt - as others have said - there are much better recipes out there for this type of dish.

I made this dish for my hubby on Valentines Day, and he absolutely loved it, as did I. He loved it even more when I gave him some of the leftovers in his lunch the next day. I must say, I'm quite often surprised at what people consider "bland". We thought this was quite flavourful and rich...maybe we just have extra-sensitive tastebuds :).

Yes...we would definitely make this dish again for our children! They loved it! We changed the pasta to make it more appealing to them (we used farfalle or bowtie pasta) and added slightly more seasoning. We wouldn't recommend this for dinner parties or get togethers, but definitely for a casual family dinner that the kids will think is cool!

I would make this again, but one cook told me to boil the broth and the wine together until they are thickened slightly (how thick can they really get?), and THEN add the cream. (You don't want to boil the cream for too long). Then add the cheese. I also served it as a broccoli/chicken/cream sauce on top of penne. It was a colorful delicious dinner served with a salad.

I just made this dish last night and it was very good although I did make a few changes and will improve on it even more the next time I make it. I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and little cornstarch in the sauce. Next time I will either double the sauce or one and a half it. I will also only add the chicken and broccoli to the sauce and not the pasta--just serve over the pasta.

After reading reviews I was very interested in finding out for myself, but although the ingredients sound very promising, I have to side with the cooks who say this is a so-so recipe. Very bland-I added lots of pepper and salt and even cayenne, which made it better but I have to say (as one of the other cooks has said already)I think there are far better recipes out there that can be made with pasta, chix and broccoli.

Good comfort food. I used dark meat which meant cooking in the sauce longer than white - and the suace cooked down and thickened beautifully. I also added some hot pepper flakes which also good well with these flavors. I thought there'd be leftover but a guys scraped the pot clean.

My husband loved this dish. I liked it as well, but my husband added an enormous amount of parmesan to entire dish while I was turned around, and it was just too much for my taste. I think otherwise, I would have loved it as well. I didn't have any trouble thickening the sauce- just used high heat and stirred for about ten minutes. This is not a thick alfredo-like sauce that will adhere and stick like glue to the pasta, so be sure and use a short pasta that can capture and hold some of the sauce. I used penne.

Rating: 1
I have made this recipe several times over the years, but I just made it again and it was nothing special. It is too much work, the sauce turned green from the broccoli, we threw most of it out. I am sure there are much better recipes out there that use broccoli, garlic, cream, wine, pasta, and chicken.

I have made this recipe so many times for my husband and kids. They love it. I am dissappointed at some of the reviews. It is a delicious recipe and makes great leftovers for lunch.

Read the reviews on the sauce being runny. Added Chicken broth, cream and wine one at a time allowing them to reduce. Actually, I had to add a little more cream at the end to be able to coat the pasta and broccoli. It was fine. I, too, added some black pepper, but the kids - our biggest critics - actually said it was good (which almost rates 4 forks). The sauce needs to reduce over high heat and it will be fine. Patience I think.

Having read so many varied comments about the sauce, I skipped that part and decided to waste my fat grams on as much parmesan as I could stomach. I also spiced up the chicken a bit before cooking it. Without having to worry about the sauce and adding extra parmesan, this recipe is very easy and enjoyable. It works well leftover, too.

Wish I would have read the reviews before I tried this dish! I was so looking forward to trying it, but was greatly disappointed. Not only was it bland, (I should have known, when there wasn't even salt and pepper listed as an ingredient. I added it anyway.)Not sure what went wrong, but the wine separated the cream. My kids didnt like the strong wine taste, anyway...althought I wont make this recipe again, it has given me some ideas for a quick mid week meal.

I make this often as a middle of the week dinner, often to use up leftover roast chicken. I have never had a problem with the sauce - perhaps others did not reduce it enough. I usually double the parmesean, and add a pinch of red pepper flakes. Always a hit in my house.

My husband is a non-white sauce kind of guy. In order to thicken it up and make it not so saucey I used the packet type of chicken broth with only half the water and 1/2 cup of cream. It was just the right consistency for him, although to reheat it came out of the tupperware like a brick!

This recipe surprised me by being 3 times yummier than I anticipated. I use half and half which is plenty rich enough to me--sauce comes out thin but I don't have a problem with that, if I did I'd just pull the cornstarch trick. Leftovers are great, and I don't even like leftovers. Be sure to add salt and pepper to the sauce before stirring it in with the chicken, broccoli, and pasta.

Houseguests had purchased a huge bag of flash frozen chicken breasts and a bag of flash frozen broccoli; of course leaving plenty of leftovers. What is a girl to do? Search the epicure site for recipes containing chincken and broccoli! This recipe works well using frozen ingredients. I also used half-and-half, not the cream recommended and some of the pasta water instead of chicken broth. I did "crank-up" the garlic up a bit and added some fresh ground pepper. This was a really good weekday recipe.Try it, you will like it.Seems like it is a good recipe to add other "stuff" as available.

I liked this, though it wasn't worth shouting about. I think it could have used more garlic, and the sun dried tomato idea was good, I thought. It had a really nice flavor on its own, though. I used evaporated skim milk in place of the cream, and the sauce turned out fine.

Dish was quite OK but nothing extraordinary! I have a feeling that somethging went wrong, may-be I fried garlic too much. As sauce felt too heavy, I added one more cup of broth. To make it more interesting I added also sun-dried tomatoes, also a bit of souce thickener.

Garlic was too strong and bitter. I had a goat cheese spread that I added to cut the garlic and some toasted pine nuts and sun dried tomatoes. Then it was pretty good but very rich.

Next attempt will be cutting garlic to 2-3 cloves, adding shallots, eliminating cream and increasing white wine.

You can never have too many tasty but easy pasta recipes. This one is a keeper. Sundried tomatoes with their oil is a must. It gives the dish an extra kick.

I have been making this recipe on a regular basis in our household for about 4 years now and everyone always loves it - a favorite. I have made some minor changes over time though - I use bow tie pasta, I don't use the parmesan cheese, the broccoli is steamed and added with the chicken to the sauce just before pouring it over the pasta, and I usually add a little corn starch before mixing it all together to thicken the sauce. If I am going for low-fat I switch the cream to skim milk and use a lot of corn starch to thicken it. The wine is always a fruity German kabinett. DELICIOUS every time!
