Just made these for the first time today and all I can say is Yum! They were spicy and slightly sweet. However, I used kosher salt and not much of it stuck on, so mine were not that salty at all. Next time I might use sea salt so more will stick. But mine were definitely not too salty. I will make these again!

I made these tasty treats after falling in love with them when my sister in law made them. They seem to get better each time I try them and they have been a hit at various parties. I cut back slightly on curry - wonderful!

These are different: spicy, slightly sweet and savory.I had to make a few ingredient changes and know what I'll do differently next time. I didn't have paprika so I just used cayenne, salt (1 tsp) and some brown sugar for the sprinkle and the amount was perfect. I subbed brown sugar for regular in the shortbread, and I found it easier to press them into bars instead of rolling them into logs (using plastic wrap was helpful). I also baked them on parchment paper, yield only 40 crackers. Next time I'll roll the dough out thinly and cut them out with cracker cutters. They are awesome served with a dab of Major Grey's Chutney...I'll serve them with a shmear of cream cheese and chutney next time.

Well, although they made nowhere near the amount promised and were difficult to roll into logs (I admit I failed and ended up pressing them into a pan), they were delicious. I thought they were, anyway. At the party (and located in a high-traffic zone), they were hardly touched. I'm not sure why that was the case (maybe they were just too ugly by the time I got done with them), but I probably won't make them again.

Delicious - I made them for New Years Eve and they were the hit of the evening. Followed the advice of the suggestions below and cut back on the salt.

These are delicious! Very different, without being odd. HOWEVER, they do look strange, kind of like roasted potatoes. I might try the traditional shortbread process next time (press into a pan and slice after baking) with the spice mixture sprinkled on top.

Made these last night. Think I may have cooked them a little too long----and sure didn't get the amount said in the recipe. More like a few dozen. I will try them again as I love anything shortbread.

I love these. Fortunately my good friend does too! so she usually makes them for gatherings and I get to enjoy them. Definitely increase the cayenne for a spicy kick of a cookie. I think they are addictive. Try it!

These were really terrific! Some who don't like curry might not like them, though. I agree with previous reviewers that reducing the salt would be wise. And I found I had lots of the spice mixture left after rolling the dough in it, so next time I would make a smaller amount of spice mix or double the dough. Also, my yield was no where near 140 pieces...more like 3 to 4 dozen, but I did slice them about 1/2 inch thick. I would definitely make this again.

This is a GREAT recipe .......I agree about the salt, about 1 1/2 tsp. will do. I also tried it a second time using Ancho Chili Powder instead of cayenne. Worked beautifully !!!! These little nuggets are addictive ;)

I believe I would have to call these "salty-beyond-belief spicey nuggets. If you feel compelled to try these, I would suggest cutting the salt at least in half. I've always had great results with your recipes - this is the one exception.
