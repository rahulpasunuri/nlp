I made it with Italian sausage. It turned out quite tasty.

Made almost as directed, substituted 1 tsp dried thyme for fresh, soaked and cooked dried navy beans for canned canellinis, and had no smoked paprika. Fast, easy, delicious one pot meal. Rich and rounded taste, I will be making this whenever I have chorizo.

really wanted to like this stew, esp after reading the reviews, but both of us decided it was pretty bland! I cooked some white beans that I had previously soaked then froze, added bulk chorizo and the veggies and home made chicken broth, and then started amping up the flavor profile, but found it was just missing some kind of depth; not sure what will help it! We really like all the ingredients, so I was very surprised that it did not come together for our tastes! Oh well, lots of other good recipes out there for beans and sausage!

I made this for a weeknight dinner and we loved it! Super fast and easy. I took the sausage out of the casing to give the dish a little more kick from the chorizo and used broccoli rabe in place of the spinach. It was amazing!

This was tasty, simple and fast. I used baby kale instead of spinach and beef broth rather than chicken broth. I don't think you need to add any additional salt at all because the beans, sausage and broth are salty enough.

Always on the look-out for healthy, cheap, cook-ahead recipes. This one excels and is also absolutely delicious. Chorizo is not cheap; but found smoked pork neck bones (for $2.50/lb.) at my supermarket. I simmered the pork neck for about 3 hours, then removed the meat from the bones and chopped (watch out for teeny bones). Used the pork cooking liquid instead of chicken stock. Because the pork was smoked, didn't need to add any salt.

After putting in the beans, I doubled the amount of broth and added one half cup of brown rice. I then covered and baked it in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes. Then added the spinach and paprika. Great whole meal.

For those of you who want something lower in fat, sub in turkey or chicken sausage. Same great taste, less fat! Open Nature Italian chicken sausage is a family favorite of ours.

I used sweet Italian sausage and skipped the paprika and thyme, but included red pepper flakes. I thought it was very delicious (mine needed more spice, but using a spicier sausage would probably help that). This was incredibly easy to make and only uses one pot! Will definitely make again.

The beans were so bland. I just didn't like it.

Wonderful meal for a cold winter night. Next time will use 3 cans of beans to stretch it - alot of sausage in this one.

This is great! I usually do andouille sausage and kidney beans . . . more of a red beans and rice. Anything you do will be fine.

Quick, easy and really good! Used cooked packaged chorizo, no fresh was available - worked fine. Wish it was a little better for you...sausage is great, but so high in fat.

This was really good, hearty and simple. I don't like wilted spinach so a topped it with a pile of arugula tossed in lemon and olive oil. The lemon adds a nice brightness, and I think I would add some more fresh herbs or drizzle of herbed olive for something else.

I used Aidell's chicken Italian sausage and sliced it first to save time. Everything else I followed, but topped it with parmesan instead of paprika. My whole family liked it - to make sure no one picked out the spinach, I chopped it first!

Great weeknight dinner. Needs a squeeze of lemon/lime at the end to finish (for me it was lemon because I used an italian sausage in the dish).

Very basic, very good! I had chicken chorizo and butter beans but it was still delicious. I added extra smoked paprika to make up for the chicken sausage.

This is a fantastic weeknight recipe! You can use whatever you have on-hand. I used spicy Italian sausage, and some regular old sweet sausage. The rest of the recipe, I followed exactly as written-- however, I am sure this is one of those that you could totally improvise on, too! I will be making this again! Perfect for a Pittsburgh winter.

This was so easy and delish! I have little ones so I couldn't get bold with spice. I subbed Chorizo with a Garlic Pork Sausage. To add a bit of pizazz, I drizzled a bit of Truffle Oil to the adult bowls. Keeper.

This was delicous. I made it with a mixture of hot and sweet sausage and it was a hit for a weekday dinner. I will make it again and use it with chorizo.

Instead of sausage, I used what I had on hand which was cubed skinless chicken breast and pancetta. I stuck to the rest of the ingredients as listed except that I forgot to add in the paprika at the end. Quite quite yummy! Even my toddler ate it with exclamations of "yummy".

Easy and absolutely delicious. This is the first thing I've made that my family ate down to the bottom of the pot before I could get to seconds! You can add pinches of chili powder, cayenne and even curry to add to the flavor, but it doesn't need them. Actually, you can probably do lots of stuff with this basic recipe - or make it and enjoy it just as is.

This recipe was phenomenal. It was so easy and quick and absolutely delicious. The only thing I changed was that I used spicy italian turkey sausage instead of chorizo. Would definitely make again.

Great flavor for such a quick recipe. I used regular chicken broth and the amount of salt was perfect. I used chorizo but I can't wait to try it with Italian sausage.

I've been looking for a tasty white bean stew recipe for ages and this one is fabulous! I used 3 hot Italian sausages instead of chorizo and simmered on the stove for 2 hours. Result was outstanding - very, very flavorful!

This stew is quick, convenient and delicious. I made only two changes: I used hot Italian sausage instead of chorizo, and I added chopped celery along with the onions and caramelized them for 25 mins before adding the other ingredients. I would definitely make this again.

Easy, tasty, healthy. It's not going to knock your socks off, but it's a great simple weekday dinner. I substituted oregano since we hadn't thyme and spiced it up with Penzey's Arizona Dreaming rather than smoked paprika, and it does wonders for it!

Does not require as much salt as called for (to taste of course). Excellent. With pre-cooked Chorizo, drop 20min from prep time and add to stew with the beans. Adding this to my weekday arsenal.

This was good not great. I doubled the recipe, added kosher salt and a half a cup of white wine. I also pureed half of it before adding the sausage at the end. Oh - I didn't not use 2 pounds of sausage for the doubled recipe to make it a little bit healthier. I used about 1 1/4 pounds.

I used a mix of dried chorizo and another fresh sausage.Perhaps fresh chorizo would have made the soup more flavorful as I thought this soup was okay but quick and easy. I have a similar recipe that uses potatoes rather than beans and kale rather than spinach and I find it more flavorful. My only real quibble was with the servings. We used chili bowls and could barely fill three bowls. I would suggest doubling the ingredients if you want more than three bowls, seconds or leftovers.
