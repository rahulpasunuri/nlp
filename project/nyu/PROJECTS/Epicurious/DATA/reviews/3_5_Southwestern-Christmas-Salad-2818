This is a beautiful presentation for a group dinner - enjoyed by everyone. I have served it at home as well as taken out to other homes. Easy to make ahead and worth the effort - in fact it's on the menu for tonight!

This was excellent! I left out the jalapeno so the kids would eat it and reduced the oil, but otherwise made it as described. It made an excellent accompaniment to the black bean soup and cornmeal muffins -- I will definitely make this again.

An excellent-tasting salad; I would try something other than the Boston lettuce next time, as it went soft way too soon for my taste.

I made this for our family's Christmas potluck and thought it made for a beautiful presentation with the pomegranate seeds, citrus pieces and greens. I'm not too crazy about the dressing however. I would have preferred something that complemented the ingredients a little better, the jalapeno dressing just doesn't seem to go with this salad.

A unique combination of ingredients! I also cut the fresh fruit into pieces for easier eating. I changed the presentation to 'rows' of toppings - like a cobb. I would suggest a bit more dressing and less onion. Very easy to cut/chop the day before and put into baggies, quick assembly to serve. Rave reviews on the colors and presentation at the Christmas table!

For those who find the pomegranates hard to deal with: Score the skin of the fruit into eighths, and put the whole thing into a bowl of water. This swells the membranes, and after about 10-15 minutes, you can easily break the sections apart. (If they are tenacious, cut with a sharp knife along the score lines.) Break them apart and gently rub the seeds out of the pith. For clingy pith, just drop the seeds back into the bowl of water and the pith will float to the top. Learned this from an Iranian friend.

This was dynamite. Actually, most of these ingredients are available year-round, so you don't need to wait for Christmas to make it. The only thing I couldn't find was pomegranates, so I used the petals of edible flowers instead--very nice. I also segmented the citrus so we didn't need knives to cut up the orange/grapefruit rounds. This is a good dish for company because you can prep all parts ahead, then throw them together at the last moment.

I made this twice over the holidays- using more greens and adding white wine vinegar and less oil as others had suggested. This salad has lots of colour and flavour. I will be making this again.

Excellent salad. Will definitely make it again. But I made half the sald for the two of us and used all the dressing. Cut back to 1/2 on the pepper, but would add more next time.

This was really delicious! Strange combinaton of ingredients, but that lead to a very interesting flavor. I served it at a dinner party and there wasn't a single scrap left. I used some canned grapefruit and just cut into bite sized pieces - really good and much easier than peeling/skinning the fruit.

Excellent, pretty easy, and don't forget the pomegranate seeds. They really finish off the salad.

Wonderful salad! I did add vinegar to the dressing and some of the juice from the oranges and grapefruit, and left out the rosemary and jalapeno (so the kids would eat it). I made it two days in a row for different parties and both times the bowl was licked clean! Definitely better with fresh fruit.

I turned this salad into a work of art on Christmas. The ingredients made for a beautiful display, but the dressing definately needed vinegar and less oil. Otherwise, mmmmm. (And all this coming from a true salad connoisseur)

This is a wonderful! I made it as a tossed salad and used canned mandarin oranges. The pomagranite seeds are great , don't leave them out. The dressing is delicious!( I did add a little more rosemary .)

Wonderful! Very refreshing. I used cayenne in stead of jalapeno, and it was still wonderful! I have served it several times and have had recipe requests each and every time.

Very colorful and festive, but the dressing was too bland for us. Next time I might add a bit of vinegar. Definitely should add the pomegranate and pine nuts for texture. Canned mandarin oranges and jarred grapfruit slices would work fine and save a lot of time.

This salad vanished quickly at a Christmas potluck, and many asked for the recipe. I will be making it for Christmas Eve with a traditional Tourtiere, a French-Canadian classic. I didn't find the chopping too cumbersome, it was worth it!

This is a very substantial salad, and the color is wonderful. A great way to dress up a simple meal.

We brought this salad to a dinner party and it went well with the pork roast they had made. This salad looks dramatic. You'd think it would be a highly citrus, but I found the avocado balanced the acids nicely. The dressing is great. The only down side: chop, cut, chop, slice, chop, cut, etc...

This was pretty good. It was cool with a spicy meal. The pomegranates were messy, and it was a lot of steps though. It's pretty different from the usual salad, which is nice.
