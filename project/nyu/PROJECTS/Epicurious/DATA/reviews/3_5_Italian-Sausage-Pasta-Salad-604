Been making this since it came out '95. I love it for an easy take-to-work lunch. I don't bother peeling the sausage, just bake it off and slice into half moons. I can no longer get a parmesan peppercorn dressing that I like, but have had good luck with trader joe's feta dressing. Also the amount of dressing called for isn't nearly enough for me - I probably use 3 or 4 times as much! Great recipe, easy to reduce or enlarge for potlucks - people always love it

This is not a salad recipe, but a pasta dish. I omitted the bottled parm cheese dressing and simply grated hard cheese over the final product, consuming it warm. Lots of variations here, too. The recipe is nothing to write home about. Solid fare; easy weeknight cooking.

My family LOVES this! They will eat it warm, they will eat it the next day cold - they just love it. I like to use the hot Italian sausage and a Peppercorn Parmesan dressing for a little more kick.

I liked this recipe but it could have used a little more spice... This is my favorite: http://joelsfoodblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/whole-roasted-tomato-and-sausage.html

I made this as a meal for my 16-month old since I'm trying ot find recipes with vegetables. I purposely overcooked the veggies so they'd be soft for him, and the final product was still delicious. I also substituted whole wheat pasta. All in all, it was a hit - he loved it and we enjoyed it also.

I thought this was pretty decent and didn't take too long. I used turkey/chicken sausages in the casing and cut them into small slices. I also added mushrooms, canned diced tomatoes, and extra garlic as suggested. I made a white wine vinaigrette and added some grated parmesan to it and that was adequate as a dressing.

Was pretty good. I agree with the member who suggested more garlic, going by teh recipe it came out a little bland. But for the most part it was pretty good and easy to make

Haven't made it so can't rate it but have to say to Shannen from Washington that salads are often served warm - German potato salad, Caesar salad with grilled chicken, even -gasp!- a warm pasta salad. And also, I have made cold salads that used sausage as a main ingredient and have had no problem with "grease coating your mouth." In fact, it is often the first thing to go on a buffet table.

A quick and tasteful recipe. Add a little extra garlic, sausage and dressing for a little extra punch! I was careful to not over cook the vegetables, they were still nice and crunchy even after reheating the next day.

it was very bland- maybe a different type of salad dressing would've helped- or eating it warm.

This is a wonderful salad. I use pepperoni instead of sausage to eliminate extra trouble, time, and greasy residue. Also I add other things, such as roasted red peppers, walnut peices, raisins, marinated mushrooms, cheese cubes, artichokes,green beans,and any other vegetable which you have.

This is not a pasta salad. It's fine for what it is, but it's not a salad, and I wouldn't want to take it to a BBQ or picnic. We ate it as a one-dish dinner on a very hot summer night, and it was filling and good but nothing to write home about.

Not having all the ingredients we made the following additions and deletions: left out the zuchinni, added roasted red pepper and marinated artichokes, used hot cappicola ham and cabrese sausage instead of cooked Italian sausage, used garlic-stuffed green olives instead of black, and made a dressing of red-wine vinegar, olive oil, parmesan and fresh basil (like a pesto sauce). Ended up with a delicious alternative - even better the next day!

I used hot Italian sausage, cooked it whole and sliced it into 1/4" rounds. Followed other instructions. Delicious!

This would be an excellent salad to take to a pot luck or picnic. It makes a huge amount. There is quite a bit of prep work involved so be sure to recruit some kitchen help.

This has become one of my "standards" when I'm having people over for lunch or need to bring something to a party. I've been asked for the recipe at least a dozen times. As did another reviewer, I've taken to adding red peppers to the recipe and have also found that many people love this as a "day-old" salad.

After using this 1st day off to do some unplanned heavy duty house cleaning, I came in here to try and figure out what to make for dinner. It just so happened that I had everything here to make this salad (?) which meant no trip to the grocery store. We had this for dinner. Since the computer was still on this page, I thought I'd comment. It took more preparation time than I would have liked (but was tired) and though it was edible, I would not make it again. No matter how well you drain sausage, you cannot remove all the grease. I can't imagine eating this cold, and unless my family wants more (which I highly doubt), the leftovers will more than likely be trashed...and I even downscaled the recipe to begin with...AND I didn't change a thing like I usually do... But we all have different palates and more loved this than not, so might as well give it a try if it sounds good to you.

This dish hosts a unique blend of flavors. Sweet, spicy sausage blends finely with the parmesan dressing to make a rich, flavorful dish. Definitely a keeper!

THIS IS A GREAT SALAD. I USED PEPPERONI INSTEAD OF THE SAUSAGE. IT WAS GREAT HOT AND COLD.

This pasta salad is full of flavor and even tastes good without the dressing as an entree. Has gone over well with many guests. Personally, I think the tomatoes (added later) really contribute to the flavor and makes for a colorful presentation.

We made a double batch on a hot summer day for 9 guests and I've sent out 4 copies of the recipe so far. It was great.

Everyone in the family liked this one. They asked that I use olive halves instead of chopped olives next time and leave out the zucchini. Nice one to take to parties!

This recipe is ho hum.....not very inovative or exciting....It was a good light summer meal, but left us feeling like we wanted something else. We substituted turkey sausage for the Italian sausage to make it a bit more healthy. Also, I didn't saute the tomatoes so that they were a bit more fresh....try it if it sounds good to you...otherwise skip it.

This salad was fabulous. The only thing I changed was that I served it hot instead without the dressing. I used a can of ready to use pasta tomatoes one time, and then I made a low fat alfredo sauce the second time. I have also made it as a salad.

Excellent and very easy to prepare. Also pretty to look at with a variety of colors.....I'd make it again.

This is a great summer meal. I have served it many times, and everyone always wants the recipe! Unless you grow your own, use halved cherry tomatoes for best flavor.

I omitted the tomatoes since my "significant other" prefers not to eat them. I added button mushrooms in its place and sauteed them with the broccoli, zucchini and wine. The dish was superb and I was asked to make it again!
