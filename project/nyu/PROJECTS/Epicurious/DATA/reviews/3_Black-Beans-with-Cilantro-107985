We will definitely be making these again. We added green bell peppers, garlic, and ground coriander. Instead of using table salt, we used Hiwa Kai Hawaiian Black Sea Salt.

I used canned beans and was surprised by how tasty this turned out. Added a bit of extra zing as the reviews requested, and it was just lovely.

Needed some tweaking, but we loved this, and I will be making it again and again. I used a 15 oz can of beans because it's what I had on hand and a few extra sprigs of cilantro. Subbed chicken broth for the water and added some cumin, garlic and adobe seasoning along with a dash of cayenne. Delicious!

Really easy and delicious with canned beans..healthy too. Could easily adjust with more cilantro and diced chili.

I think the author forgot to include an overnight soak for the beans in this recipe. I've been cooking my beans for over 5 hours and they're still not done.

I've never tried this as published as I suspect I'd think they are too bland. I saute onion and pepper in olive oil and then stir in 1/2 a diced tomato, the cilantro and the beans. After adding the water, I put in cumin, oregano, garlic powder and 1 bay leaf. I don't like the beans too watery so I also cook this longer than the recipe suggests.

I spiced this recipe up a bit, added some cayenne, dried oregano, and cumin. I actually used this as a dip and it was very good! Very easy and quick to make.

This is a recipe I had at a Ecuadorian restaurant where I used to work. It was the first time ever had cilantro and it was the first time I had black beans and sauce. It was delicious. I'm so glad that epcurious provided this recipe. If you have this with some nicely seasoned white rice. I'm Haitian so we add salt and oil (sometimes Habanero peppers--It's a staple in Haitian cooking) to our rice and cook it stove top with some nice fried sweet plantain you have the best dish ever. I loved this recipe.

I thought these were much better than other reviewers. It is definitely a side dish--I made to go with spiced pork tenderloin and enclosed it all in a tortilla (with the pickled onions). I also used canned beans per the note.

This was an okay side dish.

An OK side dish, but I'd spice it up a bit. Add more cilantro than the recipe calls for, and maybe a bit of cumin and/or fresh lime juice (if available) to give it some kick. I used red onion, which looked nice in the dish. This is a good side dish for times when you don't have much to work with as far as ingredients.
