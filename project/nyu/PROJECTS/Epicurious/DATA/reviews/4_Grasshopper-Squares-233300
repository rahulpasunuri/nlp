Made this for a cookie party - they were a huge hit. Didn't change the recipe except as other reviews suggest - spread the green layer while warm, chill it REALLY well, then add the final ganache, again, quite warm, chill really well, and slice with a sharp, clean knife. The cutting was the most tedious, but my squares came out exactly like the picture. It makes a LOT - I'd recommend cutting the recipe in half and using an 8x8 pan. I used Ghiradelli white chips (all I could find) - I melted the chocolates and cream for the two layers in the microwave and they came out perfectly.

These were phenomenal! I didn't have any creme de menthe, so I made my own with 2 T. of vodka, 1/8 t. of mint extract, and a couple drops of green food coloring - worked great!

I used 12 oz. of Ghiradelli white chocolate chips and it set up very nicely.

I reviewed this recipe in November of 2008 and I just have to add that Christmas isn't Christmas without this recipe. It is worth every minute you spend making it and it makes a really nice gift as well. Happy Holidays.

I have made this several times, and it's always a favorite at cookie exchanges or for school treats. The brownie layer by itself is delicious. It freezes well, so you can make it ahead of time. I always have a hard time getting the white chocolate to set, though.

Don't be fooled by all the reviews that say this recipe isn't "that hard" - it took a good deal of patience and hard work to execute. That being said, the end result is pretty amazing. I made the following adjustments: Cut the heavy cream by half in both ganaches as per other reviewers' comments and had no problems with the layers setting up. Used clear creme de menthe with a drop or two of green liquid food coloring. Upped the amount of liqueur per other reviews that it wasn't minty enough. Next time I'd hold the extra, but it was still good. I used Green & Black's white chocolate, and it was a little tricky to melt. I wound up adding 3 tbsp corn syrup to get it smooth enough to use. I recommend you let each layer chill, then add each new layer warm, as they're easier to spread that way. Cutting these, as previously noted, takes meticulous care - use as a big and sharp a knife as possible, and between strokes, run it under hot water and dry it. Tedious? You bet. But again - incredible end result. Also be aware that it takes a little elbow grease to cut through the hard brownie layer. Nonetheless, these came out beautiful and even my non-mint-loving boyfriend proclaimed them fantastic. Can't not give it 4 forks!

These turned out to be super tasty and nice looking squares! I cut the squares pretty tiny because they are super rich. They kept frozen very well also. A solid recipe!!

Rating: 3
I wish I had read the reviews more carefully - Ghirardelli was the only white chocolate I could find, and I had the same problem others apparently did - that ganache layer did not set. But you know what? It was still amazingly delicious even if it didn't look like the picture.

Rating: 4
Sinful! These are really, really rich and very tasty. It's definitely easier to spread the ganache when it's warm -- put the batch in the refrigerator between steps to solidify the previous layer. A heavy chef's knife run under warm water (and then dried) makes cutting easy. I cannot wait to serve these on my Christmas cookie platter!

First of all, we highly recommend listening to holiday music while preparing the recipe - the receipe takes a bit of time (waiting for layers to set), and the music will help ; ) We agreed with other reviewers regarding cutting down on the cream to about 1/4 C. (plus a splash more) in the mint ganache. It created a good consistency and held up. As mentioned by other reviewers, apply the layers warm (but placed on cooled layers). When cutting the squares, we recommend the 1 inch size as it made an elegant presentation. DEFINITELY HEAT THE KNIFE AND CLEAN THE BLADE AFTER EACH CUT. A delectable dessert that should wow our friends and nieghbors! THANKS TO THE OTHER REVIEWERS AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!! Johanne

I made these last year for the holidays and everyone loved them! They are easy to make and taste wonderful -- just the right amount of chocolate and mint. They take a little time to make but are really worth it!

These are a very classy looking (and amazingly delicious) little square. They are very striking on a platter and make an impression.

Rating: 4
These were delicious. They took a while to make, but it was worth it. There is a high ratio of mint and chocolate ganache to brownie, so if you are not so keen on that you may want to make a little less ganache. Also, I didn't have creme de menthe but simply added extra peppermint until it tasted as minty as I liked. They also cut nicely and so they look very presentable. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
Richly decadant, these need to be cut into small (1"x1") squares, so one batch goes a long way! I subbed peppermint schnapps and topped the chocolate ganache layer with 2 crushed candy canes. These were a big hit every where I took them this holiday season. Next time I make them I will double the mint ganache layer and halve the chocolate ganache layer as I found the chocolate over-powered the mint, just a tad and made these *almost* too rich to eat! These are going on my list of must-bakes for every Christmas from now on.

A M A Z I N G !!!! SO FABULOUS!!!!! I made these for the holiday gifts we gave to my family. They were a hit!!! I made the brownie base early and froze it. When I defrosted it to make the rest I followed both suggestions and the recipe. In Los Angeles here, I think you can refrigerate the ganaaches. I cooled on in the fridge and one I poured (the mint one). Both layers came out perfect. I walked around the house having people look at the picture and the bar screaming "they look like the picture!!!" FABULOUS!!!

Very rich and the first cookie to disappear from the platter. For a firmer square that will work in cookie tins and gift boxes, I use half the cream recommended for the mint and chocolate ganache (also reduces the smeary mess during cutting). As a variation on the theme, I make chocolate-orange squares by eliminating the mint flavorings and adding 3 Tablespoons Gran Marnier, 3/4 teaspoon orange extract and 1 teaspoon orange zest to the white chocolate ganache. A small bite is all you need of these fudge-like treats, so I cut them into 96 squares. Considering that I get 8 dozen squares from the finished product, the work of layering and cutting is trivial compared to a traditional cookie recipe.

Rating: 4
It didn't take me 5 hours to finish this, just about three and a half. They were delish! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out beautifully. They tasted like heaven. Chocoholics will be in heaven, but those without the genetic make-up to handle sugar will find it a bit rich. Definitely will make again. The only pain was cutting it up, use a long knife and be ready to clean it and wipe it many times to get a good clean cut.

Rating: 4
Made these yesterday - wonderful flavor and texture. My family can't get enough of them! I didn't have Creme de Menthe, so I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added 4 tsp pure peppermint extract and green food coloring. Worked like a charm. I also poured the second layer while warm, let it cool, and then poured the third layer while warm. Very easy. For the white ganache layer I cut the cream down to 1/4 cup based on another review and it set up nicely. A bit cumbersome, but worth the effort.

Rating: 4
We love these - but. But I used half and half to try to cut back on the calories; I don't recommend it. Also, I used nestle white chocolate chip; I don't recommend that either. Between two, the mint layer never set up. I hope this helps someone else from guessing wrong. They are still delicious!

Rating: 4
These are were much easier, and much more rich, than I expected. It made a lot of little squares and so far everyone who has had one say they're perfect and awesome! In my opinion, the brownie portion was the best. I used Ghiradelli so it was pretty inexpensive. Using a hot clean knife made the cutting much easier and kept the layers looking clean. I placed four little squares in wax paper and tied with Christmas ribbon and gave them for gifts-turned out cute!

Rating: 4
Oh my gosh! These were everything the previous reviewers described. The bittersweet chocolate was perfectly balanced with the mint and the brownie base, which had a slight crunch to it. I followed the recipe exactly, used Ghiradelli both white and bittersweet chocolate and had no problem at all. Very straight forward and not difficult. When cutting into squares, be sure to wash the knife in hot water, then dry between each cut. Takes time but your patience will pay off.

Rating: 4
These were a huge hit. I did not read the reviews, though, and ran into what is evidently a common problem - I used Ghirardelli white chocolate and it took FOREVER to set up. Luckily, it did eventually - overnight. I was pretty nervous that it wouldn't though. At any rate... Brought them to a party, and they were universally loved. My new "go to" mint brownie recipe, as I'd been searching for one for ages.

I've made this recipe for several years now, and everyone loves it. I make it gluten-free for my husband, who has celiac disease, and no one can tell. I just substitute a gluten-free flour blend for the regular flour and add 1/2 tsp. xanthan gum-- perfect!

I have made these every year since they appeared. I am no longer able to get through the holiday season without making them. I love all the variations, but I don't understand the people having problems with the recipe. If you use the ingredients called for it is a marvelous treat. I particularly liked the comment from twocreativenerds: "I am doomed to making these forever."

Made these per the recipe to rave reviews, they disappeared when i brought them to work and my boyfriend said it was the best thing I had ever made. I tried them again with some variation: I used a boxed brownie to save some time and I switched out the mint for Grand Marnier, also the first time I used Green&Blacks high quality white chocolate but the second time i could only get Ghirardelli. The flavor was great but the texture was a mess, it was very soft and wet, the ganache didn't set well. I'm not sure if it was the change in liquor, brownie, or chocolate brand.

Rating: 4
I made these for the first time based on fork rating and reviews. Be very careful - the first step, brownies, is very thin, and mine overbaked with less time than these directions. The mint ganache was not nearly minty enough. I used McCormick Mint Extract, which is all my husband could find on the errand I gave him on his way home. I do not recommend it. Look for pure peppermint extract like the old days. I DO agree with the reviewer who suggested just add the 2nd layer without cooling, then cool and add the 3rd layer without cooling. That worked like a charm. I did freeze it as one reviewer did, but then it was way too hard to slice - used a knife dipped in hot water, but was very difficult to slice, even though the knife was high ( the higher the better) and sharp. As far as keeping the layers from smearing, that's a snap. After you make one long slice, wipe away the chocolate from the green layer with your clean (and chocolatey!) fingers, or the back of your knife, then make your cross-cuts, cleaning the pieces again if necessary for layered appearance. I made the brownie layer one day and the next 2 the next day and sliced them on the 3rd. My only disappointment was that they were not minty enough! I should note that I did not have Creme de Menthe - used Peppermint Schnapps and a dollop of green food coloring. The color was divine. They are yummy, but a lot of expense. Andes are cheap. Be sure to keep them in your fridge, as they do contain cream... "Pride cometh before destruction, and haughtiness before a fall."

I was so excited to make these! The brownie layer came out great but the mint layer was to runny. I read so many reviews and followed them to a tee. I even put the chocolate gananche layer on top against my better judgement but when I went to cut the green minty layer oozed out. Not good at all. I used the chocolate that was recommended but still turned out bad.

I used a nanaimo bar filling instead of the mint ganache when I made this, and I'll never make traditional nanaimo bars again. The bottom layer was so rich and wonderful, and the end result satisfied all the chocolate lovers in my family.

I used Baker's for the bottom and top layer and Nestle for the mint layer. All layers hardened perfectly. I gave some away for Christmas and have received requests for the recipe. We ate every last piece. Well worth it!

This was unbelievable! I used ghirardelli chocolates for everything and it worked out just great. Everyone loved it! Follow the instructions to the T or it will not go right. Especially when cutting the squares at the end-make sure your knife is super hot and went so that the top layer does not crack (it looks better that way.) This recipe was delicious.

I won't make these again. The mint layer didn't have anought mint flavor for us - the dark chocolate brownie and ganache drowned it out. They were also very difficult to remove from the pan and cut, though I following the directions.

These were decadent. Very delicious, and everyone loved them, but they were a pain to cut. They will cut clean and perfect by following the directions and using a warm knife, but it's too fussy for me. If you're patient, and find it therapeutic to methodically cut these squares, then this recipe is for you!

Wow, these are so amazingly rich and good, if you like peppermint and chocolate. I made them exactly according to the recipe, and they came out perfectly. I used Green and Black's organic white chocolate bars and Nestle Tollhouse morsels. The brownie layer was absolutely perfect, mine wasn't dry at all like some other reviewers mentioned. Mine were a little messy to cut, not nearly as pretty as the picture, and I don't know how they'd do in goody bags, better for a plate, but I'll definitely make them again. Only next time, I'll heed the advice of other reviewers and save time by pouring the warm chocolate layers instead of cooling and spreading them.

Of course, I couldn't get mine to look as lovely as the photo, but they were absolutely delicious! The combination of the fudgy, dark chocolate brownie and the silky layers of ganache was to die for. These squares were a perfect addition to my annual cookie gifts!

Absolutely delicious!!! Had a little trouble spreading the chocolate ganache layer so I heated it up with a little more cream and it spread easier. I used clear creme de menthe and added finely crushed candy canes on top to add a little festive touch. Would definitely make again!!

I just finished cutting these this morning. They came out perfectly. I'm making them for a cookie exchange today and will most definitely do them again next year. No more multiple batches of cookies in the oven. Just one! I did as the others recommended and poured the layers into the pan instead of spreading. Worked like a charm and saved a ton of time. I used Lindt chocolate in the recipe. I baked the brownie portion of the recipe in a 350 degree oven on the convection setting. The heating of the cream and then pouring it over the chocolate didn't seem to work so well for me. So, I ended up making the ganache layers over a make shift double boiler (glass bowl over 3 quart sauce pot). I do recommend you chilling the white chocolate layer a bit longer than what is recommended. Perhaps, 2 to 3 hours. I chilled mine for 1.5 hours and it still was a little gooey. A 12-in chef's knife made cutting them a breeze. They are ridiculously rich, so don't cut them any bigger than they need to be.

I also had a problem with the white chocolate not setting up. Too much cream in that layer, as far as I can tell.

Rating: 4
These were a big hit at the office - they went very quickly. Several people described them as tasting like Andes mints. They also came out looking nearly as pretty as the picture, always a rare occurrence with me. I took the advice of previous reviewers with good results. I used baker's chocolate for the mint layer, skipped the creme de menthe and used a total of 4 tsp peppermint extract with a little green food coloring. It did not set up quite as firm as the dark chocolate layer - but was solid enough. Also pouring the still warm ganache was very easy and I had no problems with it. A bit time consuming, but I will definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
Flavor is great, but I rate this only a 3-fork, because the recipe for the white chocolate ganache is flawed. After it cooled, the white ganache was still a thick oozing syrup. It did not set-up. I reheated the white gananche and added another 10-ounces of white chocolate, another tsp of mint extract and 1 more Tbsp of Creme De Menthe. Then it set firm, as it should, (in my opinion). So, if you make this, either use 1/4 cup cream in the white chocolate ganache, or, add 20-ounces of white chocolate.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe partly because I love mint and chocolate and partly because you can make it ahead of time and store it. I also used ghiradelli chocolate (bittersweet and white) and did not have so many issues with the cutting, I only let my white chocolate/mint layer set for 25 min, and it was not bad at all. Very pretty, and so delicious the next day... Mmmm... well worth the steps : )

Rating: 3
These are wonderfully rich and such a nice addition to a box of cookies and candies. I would categorize them more as a candy - and they should be cut small to provide the perfect serving/one bite size. That said, I have to scream a little bit about how difficult they were to cut neatly. Even though I put the pan in the freezer overnight, my mint layer never really set hard, so the ganache slid around as I tried to cut the squares. As a previous reviewer said, warming and cleaning the knife between each cut makes for tidier squares. Somewhat of a pain.... not sure I'll do it again.

Rating: 4
I made this for our Christmas party yesterday, and my white chocolate layer didn't set. Still, they were delicious, disappeared readily from the buffet table, and tasted really good, so I will make them again. I see other people had the same problem, and my heart just sank when i started cutting into them, only to find the mint ganache oozing out from all sides! I used Bakers white chocolate, the only kind for sale at my grocery store...next time I'll go to a gourmet store to get the white chocolate....

This recipe is a bit high maintenance, but well worth the effort for an occasion! They are super impressive looking (exactly like the picture), and taste really good (very rich). I used giradelli for the bittersweet and the white chocolate and had no problems. I also took people's advice to warm and clean the knife as I was cutting them into squares.

I Know I just wrote a review but I was reading the other reviews and saw that one of the reviews said they didn't sift the dry ingredients!( I must have not have seen that the recipe didn't say to sift the flour.) To the next people who make this, Sift the flour no matter what the recipe says.

I've been making this recipe for the last two years. The flavor combination is fantastic, as everyone else has agreed. The problem is with the basic recipe itself. I use Mark Bittman's brownie recipe for the bottom (from How to Cook Everything) because I find this brownie recipe to gummy. For the topping layers I heat the white chocolate and cream together in the microwave, and do the same for the dark chocolate layer. I bet the mint and chocolate layers would be really tasty on a 9x13 chocolate sheet cake too.

These might be expensive but they really make a huge amount of squares. This will take you through the holiday season on your cookie plate, as they keep extremely well in the refrigerator, and they are so rich that they should be cut very small (3/4 inch square, in my opinion.) I baked the brownie layer for 20 minutes as written, and when I pulled them out of the oven they were still liquidy and bubbly-looking. I thought they were underdone but they were just right. I used Valrhona white and bittersweet chocolate for this, and it worked like a dream. I only had clear creme de menthe so I added a drop or two of green food coloring, but that's entirely optional. I believe they'd be just fine without it. I was hesitant to add the peppermint extract in addition to the creme de menthe for fear it would be too sharp and minty, but these proportions are just right. I'd urge others to use the creme de menthe, not just extract, as it gives a much deeper, more dimensional mint flavor without sharpness. I didn't cool the white chocolate ganache. I poured it warm over the cool brownie layer, and let it set up in the refrigerator. When it was firm I poured the bittersweet ganache, still warm. This method worked perfectly and saved a step. These are excellent and I will probably make them every Christmas. They can be made ahead of time, keep perfectly, and look great on the cookie plate. In short, they are a perfect Christmas cookie.

These were a huge hit. And thanks to all the other reviewers who warned against Ghirardelli white chocolate. I used Perugina white chocolate and it set up nicely. I didn't have creme de menthe so I added peppermint extract to taste with a few drops of green food coloring and it was totally fine. Use a clean, heated knife to cut them up and they'll look just as pretty as in the pictures!

I'm a picky brownie eater and only a marginal fan of mint, but these hit the spot for a cool & festively-colored Christmas treat. The brownies had a lovely fudgy texture, though I admit that after reading all the "overbaked" notes, I set the oven to 350 rather than 375. Also, my mint layer turned out Junior Mint-runny just as many others have reported. I would recommend melting the white chocolate, adding the extract & liqueur, and only then then deciding whether the cream is necessary to thin things out. Caution, though: I'm not sure whether this might cause the white chocolate to seize. The way it behaves is so un-chocolatey anyway, though, that I wouldn't hesitate to try this myself next time. Meanwhile, these are yummy, if rather messy!

I've made these about a half dozen times now and they are always a hit. I've found Nestles white chocolate works best in the mint ganache.

I made this recipe exactly as written and had no problems with the peppermint ganache setting, and I used ghiardelli. The brownie layer was really, really moist and extremely fudgy, AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. Cold they are like rocks. I included these in my Xmas cookie assortment, and by the time they got to the recipients, they were perfect consistency. I chilled these overnight in the pan before cutting and got perfect, pretty little squares. I will definitely make these again.

Rating: 3
These are really good and the technique - ganache on top of a bar layer - could easily be played with. The only unfortunate part about this recipe is the brownie layer. It could be so much better. For one, the dry ingredients should be sifted together to prevent lumps and to make the "whisking" easier. They may be rich enough but something abot the technique makes a dry, not particularly moist brownie. This is something I would strive to perfect with these, like using a recipe for nearly flourless chocolate brownies.

I also had trouble with this recipe because I used Ghiradelli white chocolate, and it didn't set properly. Even when frozen, the creme de menthe layer does not set if you use Ghiradelli!! However, it was still delicious and worth making.

Rating: 4
really great... As others have suggested, don't follow the instructions to layer the ganaches, but pour them on one at a time when they're still warm, letting each layer cool thoroughly. This will make them smooth and even and the chocolate ganache will even be a bit shiny. Then freeze the whole thing after removing from the pan and before cutting into squares to make sure the layers don't smear together. This step ensures good color distinction. If you don't happen to have crème de menthe on hand, that's alright. A little extra mint extract will do. A simpler flavor, but still rich.

Rating: 4
These are hands-down a favorite in my household and among friends. I would recommend using commercial quality foil to line the pan, as regular foil often tears in the process of lifting the very dense brownies out of the pan. And I would STRONGLY recommend against using Ghirardelli White chocolate to make the mint ganache. As another reviewer wrote, it does NOT set adequately, causing the chocolate ganache top to slide around. I have used Perugina and Hershey's white chocolate chips, which worked fine, but the batch using Ghirardelli was messy.

I really wanted to like this recipe. I gave it out in my annual Christmas cookie package last year that went to ~ 12 families. I got one request to make this specific cookie again. Now, I will admit that my recipients may not have the most developed palate but regardless that is not a resounding approval rating. From my perspective, it is a very expensive recipe and also it is difficult to cut into squares and keep the layers clean. Even though it looks killer and tastes good (not great), I can't justify making it again.

I made these last season, curious to see if they were better than my time-tested version, modified from my uncle's recipe. Apologies for chnaging/substituting (I hate that!--usually....), but for those who want to make something equally delicious and save a little $$...I make Katherine Hepburn's brownies in a 8x8 pan. Make the mint layer with powdered sugar, butter, cream and oil of peppermint to taste (VERY easy on this, it is strong, but the best mint flavor). Chill, then melt Ghiraldelli bittersweet chips with a little salted butter to keep slightly pliable. You won't be disappointed and you'll have money left over to make more holiday goodies for all your loved ones. Enjoy.

Shocked to see mixed reviews. I thought this was exquisite and everyone who sampled them agreed. (it was a bit too rich for some older relatives). I had no trouble and I even fudged a few ingredients to make up for shortages. To cut the cost, use Hershey/Nestle white chocolate chips. I challenge you to tell the difference. The yellowy color is easily fixed with a touch of green food coloring or some fresh grated mint. You can also substitute semi-sweet chocolate chips and some extra cocoa powder or unsweetened chocolate (to balance sweetness with bittersweet). If you want to give them out or something, this cheapens the recipe considerably and you really don't lose anything.

This recipe is really good however I think I screwed it up a bit (which is why I only gave it 3 forks; perhaps I will give it 4 forks when I do it correctly). I used Ghirardeli chocolate (that's what I had on hand) and followed others' recommendation to layer the ganaches when they were not yet set. I noticed that with the mint ganache, the fat separated from the mint ganache layer which I had to sop it up with a paper towel before I let it set. Also, the mint ganache never really set. Otherwise, this recipe is REALLY good! I look forward to making this again!

People thought these were to die form the best brownies ever. It made a LOT of brownies, cut very small. They're much better chilled, and I think that next time I would use regular creme de menthe, and skip the food coloring.

I made this on christmas eve and it was a hit (and there was a lot of competition). However, Make sure you don't allow the ganache to set too much before you layer it, it will make life much harder. Also, allow ample time for cooling etc. My family is already thinking of new modifications to this recipe, I think there is a grasshopper brownie torte now...

I made this for a Christmas party, and it was the most popular item (even among the likes of seven-layer cookies, lime snowballs, etc!). I didn't have creme de menthe, so I subbed peppermint extract and it was fine. Also, be sure to watch the brownies, as they cook much faster than the recipe says. As a result, mine were a little dry. Nevertheless, yum! I cut them into 3/4" squares, and that was just the right size. A bit of a pain to cut nicely, though (make sure you use a heated knife).

Rating: 3
Delicious, but be warned: these cookies are very rich! I suppose that's appropriate considering how much I spent on the chocolate. I realised I didn't have quite enough Valrhona white chocolate, so threw in a couple squares of Baker's white chocolate, cringing at the remarkably yellow color compared to the Valrhona. Still, once the creme de menthe was added, that was no longer a problem. (Maybe that was my fault, anyway--not sure how long the Baker's chocolate had been in the pantry.)

Have made this twice. Turned out great both times. Be sure to chop the choc. for the ganache really well. Had to pop my white choc. in the microwave for a bit to finish melting it. Also check the brownies early as mine baked in less time than the recipe stated. I cut mine in small portions due to it's richness.

When I first made these and tasted them I didn't think that they were great - especially given the cost of the ingredients.

These are super creamy and were VERY popular with almost everyone. I did have trouble with the top layer of chocolate: when I covered the warm bowl with cling film and put it in the refrigerator, water condensed and dripped onto the chocolate, which broke when I tried to work it cold. Had to try a second time ($$$!) but it was worth it.

I agree with the previous cook regarding the softness of the mint ganache. Still, the taste was lovely and the family loved them for the holiday. I was told that the Creme De Menthe was a bit strong, but that's ok by me :-).

Do not make the mistake I made -- I used oil of peppermint instead of peppermint extract. Four times as strong!

These were good, but not beyond compare. I think I cooked the brownie layer too long as it was very hard to cut and the mint layer never did firm up. It did firm up some what over night. I added more peppermint extract as the mint layer didn't taste minty enough. Maybe that's why the mint layer didn't firm up well. I bought the only brand creme de menthe in the store so maybe that's why they didn't taste that minty without the extra extract. They were a nice green color though. I'll try these again and try to cook the brownie layer less.

Wonderful! I made these squares for work and family. Many of them used the word "evil" to describe these silky smooth treats. I did cheat a bit by using my favorite brownie mix but they still turned out fabulous. This recipe has quickly become a new holiday treat tradition in my family.

I did not like this, probably because I do not like Nanaimo squares/bars and this is quite similar. Different flavours, definitely, but the basic layering/texture is similar. These are very rich and silky but the chocolate and sweet was too overpowering for me. Maybe toss in some nuts for texture? Anyhow, I would not make again...they were not a terribly big hit...but if you like nanaimo bars and mint, you will probably like these. The recipe worked just fine, everything set and cooked as directed. Oh, if you make this in a 9x13 pan, the brownie layer will NOT be as thick as shown in photo.

I made these for my Christmas cookie gift boxes and they were a huge hit. The only difference was I didn't realize I was out of peppermint extract until too late, so I just added in more Creme de Menthe. Turned out just fine. Rich, creamy, very yummy. Got major raves and requests for more. Will definitely make these again!

In a word....SENSATIONAL!!!!! This will surely go on my holiday baking list every year. It pays to use good chocolate. With a yield of about 5 dozen, it's hardly expensive in the end.

To die for - I'll be making these every year. My husband is not a big mint fan so I skipped the peppermint extract and used a bit more creme de menthe (YES, they still make it). These were even better after a couple days in the fridge, and got a ton of "wows." Thanks for the tips on not cooling (just pouring) the ganache, I'll definitely do that next time. Also used Hershey cocoa powder and it was fine.

The cookies are good, not to die for...

That can't be true...they have to still make Creme de Menthe. Ask another liquor store.

Help please! This recipe looks fantastic. I've bought about 30 dollars of chocolate to make it but I can't find creme de menthe anywhere. I was told at a liquor store that it is no longer made. Where is everyone finding it? Thanks !!!!

I usually make truffles for the holidays so this was a natural new switch. The production on this recipe is quite easy - the surface of ganache hardens fast in the fridge and the lines look nice and clean. Cutting them is kind of a challenge with heating and re-heating the knife, but they do come out looking exactly like they do in the magazine.

LOVE this cookie, although it isn't a cookie, more like a chocolate lover's dream. Stick with ghiradelli chocolate and Hershey's cocoa and you'll be fine. I've been snacking on the cut-off ends all day. For parts 2 &3, I ended up pouring the chocolate into the pan b/c the cream wasn't hot enough to melt the chocolate. Having said that, wouldn't change a thing.

My husband thought that these rated 4 out of five, because I didn't use Lindt or Droste chocolate. However, when he had a craving for chocolate 2 days later, they rated 5 out of five! I forgot to let the hot cream stand for a minute to melt the chocolate, but fixed that by microwaving it a minute at a time.

I made these as the gifts that I gave out to my co-workers. They were a huge hit! I didn't cool the top two layers before pouring them which made it much easier to pour and spread. Keeping the knife clean during cutting is vital, or it can get messy! These are wonderfully delicious!

Amazingly rich, impressive presentation. As others have mentioned, there is no need to do the cooling/spreading described in the recipe -- I just completely cooled the brownie, then made the white chocolate layer and poured that on top. Allow that to COMPLETELY cool, then make the dark chocolate top layer and pour on top. Wipe the knife clean between cuts, and re-cool if it starts getting messy. Really, quite an easy recipe for such an impressive looking/tasting dessert, the hardest part was the cutting! I also used pepermint schnapps, as I couldn't find creme de menthe, and although the middle layer is white instead of green, it tastes divine.

a note on cutting them,put them in the freezer just long enough to harden the ganache before cutting. Helps in getting a clean square.

oh I can't wait to make these... They are my grandmother's grasshopper cookies! she made them for me everytime I visited NC, now if only I could fry chicken I'd have it all.

Absolutely Fabulous! I've recieved rave reviews on these. Great for Christmas cookies due to the green middle layer. They take awhile to make, but you can do other things in between waiting and they are well worth it!

I used regular Hershey's cocoa instead of dutch process (couldn't find it) and it turned out fine. It got rave reviews at dinner last night. The mint is just the right amount. Delicious, intense, not too difficult to make...a keeper!

The brownie component was basically still boiling liquid and not brownie-ish at all when it came out of the oven, but I just kept on following the directions. My white choc & ganache layers got too cold, so I just threw them in the microwave for a minute and poured each over the previous layer after chilling. Can't imagine why they're supposed to be chilled and spread anyway. Any ideas on that? HARD to cut, but beautiful and totally worth it.

I thought this recipe was great, but it was too great...it was just too much. I think a simpler, less rich version would be more to my liking.

Made this for my annual cholesterol fest/holiday open house. They were very pretty, tasty, a nice little chocolate hit. I didn't "spread" the peppermint filling or ganache. I simply poured them while they were still somewhat liquid over the chilled layer below, then chilled it until it hardened. Very easy that way, and each layer was flat (except the brownie layer, which of course was a little wavy, but still pretty). I used peppermint schnapps instead of creme de menthe, because it's what I had. The flavor was very good, but I'd forgo the green food coloring I added when I make it next time -- white would have been fine. The peppermint layer was softer than the others, and I might try adding more white chocolate to it next time, and see if I like it better a bit firmer. As for cutting it into little squares, I would say that it's worth it to measure carefully, and definitely clean your knife thoroughly between cuts. This results in the cleanest, prettiest squares, and is worth the trouble.

My daughter made this for my cookie exchange. (ok, I did most of the work) They were the favorite cookie of the party. After reading the directions first, I decided we would cut a few corners. (it was 2 am the night before the party) So I didn't let the ganache thicken before putting over the brownies. I put the brownie in the fridge to set up quickly, then put the mint ganache on top. I returned it to the fridge and then 1/2 hour later did the same with the chocolate ganache. They were a little messy at first, but ended up being wonderful!! When I make these again, I will do it the same way.

I brought these into work, and they are amazing. Very rich and getting all kinds of compliments. That said, these were the most expensive treats I've ever made...don't even get me started on how much the chocolate cost.

Rating: 3
These are luxurious. Couldn't afford the fancy chocolate, used ghiradelli and is delicious! Perfect amount of mint flavor, very rich (don't even think of cutting larger than 1" squares). They are quite beautiful and surely would make a lovely Holiday gift. Be sure that the squares are nice and cool while cutting them or it turns into a quick mess ( re-chill or work quickly). Very festive.

My brain was NOT working when I made these. Twice I melted the chocolate and butter without the brown sugar, and once the mixture was so hot that when I added the eggs it actually cooked the egg while I was stirring it. I'm not usually this stupid, I swear. Once I got past my mental stumbling blocks everything turned out great! I used the chocolate recommended and it is delicious. Just don't do what I did and make "chocolate egg surprise."

Absolutely for the mint chocolate lover. I used Ghiradelli chocolate and they turned out great. They are a bit of work, but totally worth the effort. I set some out on the appetizer table during a cookie party. I didn't realize how popular they were amongst the guests until I announced that I had prepared gift bags of the Grashopper Squares as take home gifts. Everyone was thrilled and wanted the recipe. Definitely a keeper!

These cookies were awesome. Definitely for chocoholics! The bottom layer is a fudgy brownie and the top two layers just melt in your mouth. The mint flavor is not overwhelming. I used Lindt chocolate as recomended and they turned out perfect.

My store didn't have grasshoppers so I substituted an equal amount of locusts, and it was still delicious!

As a woman who prefers unadulterated chocolate, I thought that these were superb. I too used exceptional ingredients and, therefore, these were costly to make.

I made these the day after my magazine arrived. They're wonderful and very simple to make. That being said, I used exceptional chocolate, which meant that these were very expensive little morsels. [Insert "cost a mint" joke here.] I'll try them again with supermarket chocolate soon to see how the recipe holds up.
