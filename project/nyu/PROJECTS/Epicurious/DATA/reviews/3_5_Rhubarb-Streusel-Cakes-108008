Not sure why anyone had trouble with this recipe. These were delicate, subtle and delicious. The only change I made was that I used vanilla powder rather than liquid. I tend to like the tartness of rhubarb so in the future I'd not toss it with the confectioners sugar and leave it plain. While it wasn't overly sweet, it wasn't tart either which is my preference. Will be making these again today for a luncheon. Oh, and no issue with the amount of topping either.

The cake portion is very dull - would recommend adding rhubarb to actual muffin portion. Added almonds and oatmeal to streusel and ended up with beautiful topping. Watch out... they ooze over.

I also followed teacherhansen's advice for the changes and made it in a 9x13 pan because I didn't have muffin tins but I did had fresh rhubarb. It came out moist and very good. My only suggestion would be for others wanting to make this in a 9x13 pan to double the amount of the batter (remember to follow teacherhansen's review further down the page). The other amounts work fine.

I made these muffins, and...I can only assume that the author screwed up the proportions. I had the right amount of batter to halfway fill my 1/2-cup muffin tins. I added the rhubarb--so far, so good. Then I turned to the streusel topping. I had so much toppping that it filled my muffin tins to the very brim AND I STILL HAD HALF LEFT OVER. I double-checked my measurements, and I am certain that they were correct. VERY DISAPPOINTING.

I used the modifications from teacherhansen as well... my results were OK. They taste great, but overflowed out of the muffin cups and made a real mess. The streusel did sink a bit too... I think next time I make them I will use bigger muffin cups and let bake for a bit before I put the streusel on.

This rates 3 forks ONLY if you make it with teacherhansen's changes - very nice streusel. I think the increased amount of rhubarb, brown sugar, and spices make the cake. Cooked for 55 minutes in an 8-in. square pan.

I just finished making this recipe with almost all of teacherhansen's modifications. I didn't put walnuts or cloves in, and I kept the white sugar as is. I think the oatmeal is crucial. I think 3 c. rhubarb is the minimum. Mine didn't sink in at all, and it left the top looking lovely. I did bake it as muffins, not as cake. After leaving them to cool for 60 min. they popped right out of the non-stick tins. I turned around and started a second batch as soon as I tried the first batch, and I'm using just a little more powdered sugar this time. Thanks for the tips, teacherhansen! I love the mods! I'm not a huge muffin fan, but these are so lovely and so tasty, they would be wonderful and impressive to serve as brunch or even dessert for guests. Maybe with a dollop of fresh whipped cream?

I modified the recipe to include more rhubarb for a moist, delicious cake. fold into cake batter: 3+ cups chopped rhubarb 3/4 c walnuts ~ 3/4 tsp cinnamon pinch or two cloves/allspice (opt) instead of 3/4 c white sugar, i used half cup brown sugar and 1/4c white. the brown gives a better carmely flavor and crunchier crust. streusel: 1/3 brown sugar 3/4 c oatmeal 1/3 c flour cinnamon to taste little salt couple tablespoons butter I prefer the flavor and texture of the recipe with my modifications. Plus, it uses more rhubarb which seems to be so pleantiful in gardens this time of year. Enjoy! Hope you like the changes as much as I did!

I made this with frozen rhubarb, and it didn't sink into the cake batter at all because of that. So next time, with frozen I will just push it in a bit. I like using the powdered sugar to surround the tart pieces with a bit of extra sweetness -- great idea. I will also bury a little streusel in the batter because I can't get enough! NOTE: Rhubarb, just like baking with fresh apple, needs a day of storage in which to equalize the moisture between the fruit and bread component. I can't wait for morning!

I made this in a 9 inch round pan and baked for about 40-45 minutes. This was about 2/3 streusal to 1/3 cake, and although I agree that the streusal amount should be cut in half, I didn't think that the amount of cake was enough in the first place. Also, be sure not to let the rhubarb sit with the powdered sugar---it made my rhubarb juicy, resulting in a soppy center to the cooked cake that I just couldn't get to finishing cooking without possibly burning the rest of the cake.

Great results for modest efforts! I agree that there's too much streusel topping - but the recipe's good enough that you'll want to make another batch to use it up with. I had to use a mix of whipping gream and 2% milk (no whole milk on hand), but no problems. For the cook with the crumbling cakes, did you use a nonstick muffin tin? That's what I used (greased with butter) and there were no problems. Good luck next time!

These were absolutely delicious but I had a major problem of removing the muffins from the muffin pan without making them fall apart, although I'd buttered the pan very well. Had to eat it as crumbles. Any suggestions?

These were good, but will need some changes for next time... more rhubarb, perhaps mixed with the batter, and not so much topping- it was very crumbly; tasty though. Like the idea of making it in a pan.

Tried this in a 9-inch springform pan instead of the muffin tins. Baked it for about 50 minutes. Happy with the results, the flavour and presentation are excellent.

UN-BE-LIEVABLE!!! I am no baker, but this was by far the best and easiest baking recipe I've ever tried. Has anyone tried it in a bundt pan? I'd like to try it as a coffee cake instead of individual cupcakes.

Pretty delicious. I made mine with rhubarb and strawberries. I had salted butter and adjusted the streusal by not including salt - but forgot to adjust the cake batter, and the end result was a tad salty (and I like salt). Others with salted butter will want to adjust. The cake was very light and good. I'm not that successful with cake OR muffin batters so I was pleased. There seemed to be too much streusal batter and I only used half. Next time I will use only 1/2 c flour for the streusal. Pecans might be nice too.

Couldn't find any rhubarb, so I used blackberries & raspberries. Turned out just fine. Have made this 2x & everyone loved it! The cake is very tender, light & moist. Great recipe.

Beautiful!

These are wonderful. These are very light and not as heavy as a typical muffin they can also be used as a desert. I followed the recipe as written they were perfect. I did take the suggestion of one reviewer who recommended waiting 10 minutes before removing from the muffin tins to ensure they did not fall apart. These are a keeper.

Really scrumptious cake! I had trouble removing these from the muffin pans so I tried doubling this and baking in a 9x13" pan (Baked at 350 for 1 hour 20 minutes). The streusel and rhubarb sank to the bottom and it turned out more like a cobbler. It was still delicious though. Does anyone have a tip for keeping the topping on the top? It would look prettier that way.

This is one of the best muffin bases I have made. It turns out light and fluffy with a terrific combination of sweet and sour. Quite easy to prepare and highly recommended!

This is a wonderful recipe for rhubarb! The cake is moist and the rhubard adds just the right amount of tartness.

When these babies come out of the oven, I dare you to eat just one. Rhubarb is nowhere near the top of my list of edible foods, but for baking it imparts a nice tart flavor and moisture to this dessert. The streusel on top sweetens the muffin perfectly, and the cake is quite light. I added the rhubarb directly to the batter and omitted the icing sugar from the streusal. Less fiddling I figured. Otherwise, the recipe itself is simple and fast.

These muffins are excellent. However, the three minutes to cool in the pan is a little off. After 3 minutes they fall apart. It's better to wait more like 10 minutes.

These muffins are excellent! The rhubarb gives them a yummy taste of spring. My only complaint is that the recipe calls for 1/2 # of rhubarb and I had quite a bit left over. I'd suggest using half that amount.
