I wouldn't be as tough on this as some but then I cheated. I would never attempt a roll sponge after my first three disasters( hard,thin cardboard for my efforts)so I used the cake from the Layered Lemon Cake with Lemon Curd. The buttermilk filling worked very well in four layers here, and a few days later is still very tasty.

I wouldn't be as tough on this recipe as some, but then I cheated. I'd never take on a sponge roll - too difficult for an amateur - so I substituted the cake from the Layered Lemon Cake with Lemon Curd. The buttermilk filling worked well here as it filled the four layers. Used some whipped cream and sugared the top and three days later it's still very tasty.

I was also very disappointed with this recipe. The cake stuck to the waxed paper and was very difficult to roll afterwards. The filling was just so-so. Bon Appetit recipes are usually so wonderful, but this one (for me) was just...well..a lemon.

I was very disapointed with this cake. The cake part was way too thin and it just did not look nice. I will not make this again.

The filling was rubbery - reminded me of boxed lemon pie filling. Also, although I'm a huge cheesecake fan, I didn't think the buttermilk flavour worked. I served this with fresh strawberries for book club - what a disappointment. I'm tossing the recipe.

This is a great Easter or bridal shower cake. It is nice and light and you can make smaller piece for people, which is perfect for a group of ladies. I went all out on decorating, I covered it with whip cream, then I made butter cream flower stems and leaves. For flowers I got a batch of small pansy flowers and brushed the flowers with egg whites and sprinkled sugar over them. The flowers on the top of the cake gave it a nice three-dimensional look and I got rave reviews. Be careful when cooking the cake, it might not look done because it has a very spongy texture, if you over cook it, it will crack when you roll it.

Most impressive desert I have made, with these additions; iced with 7-minute icing piped though pastry bag (recipe in most basic cookbooks like Better Homes & Gardens), and topped with candied lemon peel (recipe on Epicurious). I have never served something that looked like it came out of a magazine, but this did. Made day ahead -- allows to set.

I thought this recipe was fair. I had to make the cake portion twice because the first time, I couldn't unstick the cake from the wax paper. I thought the filling was very good, but the cake was a little chewy and dense in texture.

I frosted the cake with fresh whipping cream and garnished with fresh flowers. Beautiful and delicious.
