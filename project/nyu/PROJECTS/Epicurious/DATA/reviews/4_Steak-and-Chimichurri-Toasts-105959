I first printed this recipe in 2002 and have been using this marinade since then. It's a little time-consuming, so I usually make several batches at once and freeze them. It freezes well. I use the recipe as directed, except that I do increase the crushed red pepper to one teaspoon. Since we don't eat red meat, I use it for chicken and vegetables (potatoes, eggplant, carrots, etc.) and it's truly fantastic.

This is amazing! It's my new "go to" appetizer for entertaining and everyone LOVES it. I made some tweaks, mostly because I wanted to be able to prepare double batches in advance of large gatherings. Instead of baking the baguette slices, I brown them in a skillet after brushing with some melted butter and olive oil, then store them in a plastic bag overnight. The texture is softer, almost like a crispy brioche. I also marinate the steak beforehand in a vinagrette rather than the chimichurri. I broil the steak in advance and slice it. Just before guests arrive, I assemble these, using the chimichurri to brush the bread and top of the steak slices before popping into the oven on a foil-lined cookie sheet to warm. These are just fantastic.

I loved the sauce like others did and would make that again. It as a tasty paste and would go well with a lot. It did taste good with the meat. But I was not that impressed putting this together as an appetizer. It seemed like a lot of labor and hard to keep at a good temperature to keep it appealing. I'd make it again to serve the meat as a meal.

very nice. i did it as part of a large catering at a hospital. very big hit along with the stuffed mushrooms from this site. too many pictures of open wounds for me though.

Sauce was very tasty. I made extra and used it the next day. For me the Magic Bullet device was perfect for getting a sauce consistency. I also used better meat than flank. Great taste. I had trouble getting it out of the house to take to a party as family wanted to eat it.

I really don't know how to express how good this is. I have made it for friends at least a dozen times and people beg me to make it again and again. The sauce (isn't really a sauce as much as a paste) is wonderfully flavorful. And what it does to flank steak is fabulous. This is definitely a keeper.

This is wonderful! Full of flavor, easy to prepare, easy to serve, leaves you plenty of time to be with your guests while you wow them with your culinary skills. I made this 2 days ahead, foze the meat in the marinade and let it thaw in the fridge from the evening before my shindig. The meat was tender, the marinade was flavorful, the presentation was elegant.

Delicious! I prepared the recipe as directed, but instead of refrigerating for an hour, I froze it for several days. The flank steak marinated for a day while it defrosted. The meat was very tender and flavorful. I had to cook the meat for MUCH longer than directed, though - at least 15 minutes total, and it was still very red. The sauce is amazing - I made a double recipe. It will go on anything (including the aforementioned road kill!). Next time, I think I'll serve it as a main course, without the toasts.

Fabulous! I made these for a holiday cocktail party and not only were they very festive but everyone raved about yummy they were! They're also great because you can get everything together ahead of time and assemble just before the guests arrive.

The sauce is great. Yummy dish. Made exactly as written. Took suggestion from another reviewer to use fork. Marinated for 2 hrs and the meat was tender and delicious. Served with roasted potatoes, snap peas, and salad.

I took a chance and made this for a "white bread, meat and potatoes, bottle of beer" kind of crowd. My husband and I loved it but each of my guests dutifully tried one piece and didn't return to the platter after that. I still think I'd make it again (it is very easy), but I think it has to be for the martinis and wine crowd next time. We grilled the flank steak - yum.

This was good, but not something I'm going to rave on and on about. I used sirloin instead of flank steak, and I cooked it in a cast iron skillet. The sauce was especially good on the mashed red potatoes I served alongside.

Made with chicken and it was excellent -- a keeper. With the leftover marinade, I made rice and added about 1 T of the sauce and it gave it a nice flavor.

the previous reviewer is right...you could put chimichurri on roadkill and i'd probably eat it. this was my first time making chimichurri and i could not believe how good it was. i actually made a flank steak sandwich instead of the toasts and it was excellent. i broiled the steak for about 2 min per side for rare and it was perfect, thin slices for the sandwich. you must try this, especially if you like garlic as much as i do.

This is a definite repeat. I was very surprised to discover how flavorful this simple sauce/marinade was. I am trying another recipe on this site tonight that has cilantro to compare the results. Fantastico.

We were staying with friends for a ski weekend and my assignment was to bring appetizers. Instead of serving this over bread, I pretty much followed the prep directions but instead made these into quesadillas (and added a bit of grated cheese. ) They were a big hit and I'll definitely make them again.

Made this yestaday for the a small crowd of 18....Everyone loved the steak as well as the sauce...I doubled the receipe, after reading all the reviews. I marinated the meat in 1/2 the sauce and saved the other half so that the veggies in the group could enjoy it with bread alone.....and the meat lovers could more on top of their steaks...The sauce was the hit of the dinner. Also, I did not use flank as I agree with other reviewers and there are better cuts of meat( I chose a special split fillet. These sauce is over the top....Its a keeper. Deecooks

Just had this dish this past weekend at an ethnic Argentinian restaurant in NYC and could not wait to get back home and try it. This dish was almost as good as the mouthwatering one I had. I prepared this dish as an entree instead of appetizer and served it with Parsley Potatoes. I would highly recommend marinating the flank steak for a long period of time (ie, overnight at least) to soften the meat or using a more tender cut of meat. I marinated the meat with all of the chimichurri sauce for about 5 hours and would prefer the meat to be more tender. However, the flavor was quite delicious, and I will definitely be making this again. (incidentally, I used 1 TBL of ground oregano instad of 2 TBL dried and the flavor was quite nice; I also used a scant tsp of salt instead of the whole tsp). The chimichurri sauce is also an excellent dipping sauce for bread as an appetizer.

Very good and very easy. I liked the flank steak - you must cut it fairly thin across the grain.

I will definately make this sauce again. It was delicious, however we found the flank steak too chewy. Would be fab using fillet or rib eye.

This sauce is fantastic! I made the recipe as stated, using flank steak, and it was very good (sauce made the dish). However, if I were making this for guests and wanted an impressive dish, I would suggest using beef tenderloin. Flank steak is just an OK cut of meat. Will definately make this again!

This was awesome! Unfortunately, I had to make some adjustments. I used the amount of cumin and salt the recipe called for, but it was terribly overbearing and too salty. I eventually added about 3/4 more parsley and another 1/3 cup or so more olive oil to get it to balance out. So I caution all users to use spices sparingly at first, and to adjust later once everything is blended. I made this as a main course, and it was fabulous. The sauce was great on roasted potatoes. Will definitely be making it again.

Terrific, easy recipe. I pricked the flank steak on both sides with a fork before marinating and followed the cooking directions exactly and the meat was "like budda". Be sure to salt to taste as I found the 1 tsp. to be not quite enough. Delicious, though and very impressive looking on the platter!

To the cook from California-01/04 You are kidding right? You can't do that kind of substitutions and expect anything but a mess!

to the california cook in january: you substituted cheddar cheese for flank steak, and wonder bread for a good loaf... and you would like suggestions on what you might have done wrong? i am not sure why these substitutions might have made sense at the time, but next time try preparing ingredients in advance...

So this didn't work out too well...My butcher was closed so I couldn't buy the flank steak so I used Cheddar cheese instead. Also I couldn't find a good baquette so i used wonder bread. The sauce was really good though, but overall the people at my dinner party were fairly disappointed, I don't know what I did wrong. Any suggestions for what I could do next time to make it better would be greatly appreciated, seeing as how I am a novice cook.

I made this for a Christmas open house party and everyone loved it. So very tasty. My suggestion however, is to cut the toasts and steak into smaller pieces (half is fine); much easier to handle and eat. Also, I made the mistake of buying a 2 lb flank steak (rather than 2 1 lb steaks) and it was much too thick.

Great recipe-even my kids love it! They ask for the steak with green sauce. I often just use the sauce with the steak for dinner rather than as an appetizer on french bread.

After reading other reviews, I made a few adjustments to this dish--doubling the amount of garlic and red pepper. Everyone who tried it at our party loved it. I cooked the steak in a grill pan, about 5 minutes per side. It turned out nicely medium rare.

Just made this for a Superbowl party, and everyone loved it. I would add more garlic and a tiny bit more red pepper - I was a little nervous about how hot/spicy it would be, but it was very mild. Rare is perfect for this dish. Can't wait to try it on the grill! A very easy dish if you don't have loads of time and need to make something ahead.

This was a great dish to serve at our New Year's Eve party. The only change that I would make is to marinate the steak overnight using all of the sauce because the sauce has a very strong flavor and it may be too strong for some guests when dabbled onto the steak toasts directly.

Rating: 4
I didn't follow the instructions to the letter. At the time I was preparing the marinade, I was so tired and inadvertently threw the steaks into ALL of the sauce. Although I know it's not recommended to "re-use" the marinade, we did without any ill effects. Besides the shrimp crostini, it was the only other dish to be completely comsumed!

Made this for a catered party, what a great recipe. Easy, delicious and a great presentation with chopped cilantro over the top! Definately marinate overnite to achieve maximum infusion. Add more red pepper for a spicer sauce, as this isn't that spicy.

This is D-Lish!! A great way to use parsley from the garden. I was dipping slices of gruyere cheese in the sauce while we were waiting for the meat to cook. Really great!

I really like this recipe. I made it as printed for a friend's New Year's Eve party, and it disappeared. I made it last night for dinner and my boyfriend was in heaven. This time I prepared it as more of an open-faced sandwich and served it with sauteed mushrooms as an accompaniment. In my opinion, the rarer the meat the better. Also, you don't have to make this purely as an appetizer, as you've probably already figured out. You can marinate the steaks and broil or grill them, then serve them unsliced. You can make fantastic sandwiches with this recipe, too.

This is an excellent chimichurri recipe. I would reccomend that you also try choripan with this sauce - but good quality spicy beef sausage links - "chorizos" and slice them almost in half lengthwise, open them butterfly style, grill them on the parrilla, and make sandwiches with grilled french bread and chimichurri. This is a favorite at Argentina parillas, and an excellent appetizer while you wait for the meats to grill up.

The chimichurri sauce is wonderful. Try it with fresh home-baked bread as a dipping sauce. Excellent.

We used this marinade on regular steaks under the broiler and it was lovely. We had plenty of sauce leftover since there are just two of us, and it also made a great topping for shrimp tacos. I'm wondering what I CAN'T do with this sauce!

I'm not sure I would use flank steak again as I thought it was somewhat tough. The sauce was excellent, and the leftovers were even better the next day (minus the bread). 2 pounds of meat made much more than I'd anticipated. I used two 24-inch baguettes.

Very Good! Served it as an appetizer to our guests, and they had to stop eating before they were too full to eat anything else. The meat was very tender and I think the marinating & quick broiling had a lot to do with it. Note that we had it in for 10 min. per side, and it was still a little rare in the middle. 4 Minutes as stated in the recipe is not quite enough cooking time. Will definitely make it again!
