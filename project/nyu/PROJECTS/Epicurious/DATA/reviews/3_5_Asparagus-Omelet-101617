I would advise to omit the salt from the egg mixture. The combo of the bacon and cheese added more than enough salt for me. This is a good way to use up left over asparagus. I also used shallot instead of green onion. Would probably make again but without the added salt.

Wonderful!! I really enjoyed having this for breakfast

We made this for dinner last night and tackled prior cooks' complaints of mediocrity by doing the following: didn't have bacon, but did have 3 small shiitake mushrooms that would have been tossed otherwise. Chopped these into tiny pieces and sauteed w/green onions. Also used really good pecorino instead of parmesan. Finally, the secret ingredient - herbs! (Which strangely the recipe as is doesn't call for any of...). I added about a teaspoon of a mix called "moondust" that I made from the Flying Biscuit cookbook (available via FlyingBiscuit.com). Strong flavor of thyme in this mix, so you could probably just use a little of that, even, to add some flavor. Oh, and we sauteed in butter, which always boosts the flavor. It was incredible! Can't wait to make it again.

A bit mediocre...but then again, it IS just an omelet.

This is a a great omelette to make when you're looking for something a little different, but not too tough to make.

Just in case you are wondering, the original recipe calls for asparagus cook in 1/2 inch pieces.

This dish was just OK, to me it was just an unexciting omlette. Nothing wrong with it, just average.

I substituted prociutto instead of bacon, it was fabulous and now it's become my favorite dish for entertaining at brunch. b

Very tasty. I treated it more like a frittata though--set the top under the broiler, and didn't fold in half. Also, I substituted shredded aged swiss for the parmesan, and was quite pleased with the result.

I'll make this often. Even without the bacon it makes a nice summer dinner

I finished this like a fritatta - placing the skillet under the broiler at the end - and it worked great. It reheats well in the microwave too.

Delicious omelet. Have made it several times and will make it again while asparagus is available. I usually drain the bacon on paper to make it a little less fattening.

This was delicious even without bacon. It's fast and easy and I plan on making it frequently during 'asparagus' season!
