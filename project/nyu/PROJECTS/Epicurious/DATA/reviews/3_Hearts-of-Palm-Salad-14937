I didn't use mayonnaise ...I used olive oil instead. Always fresh cracked pepper and sea salt to taste. i thought it tasted much better this way.

Simple and tasty. I used mandarin oranges in lieu of tangerine. Makes for a quick salad. Not overly elegant.

LIke the previous reviewer said, this is too much dressing for this salad. It is also too hevay for the arugula -- it makes the leaves clump up. I guess it tasted OK -- it wasn't repulsive, although my dining companion really didn't like it -- but it isn't anything I would make again.

Not bad but not great either. If I ever made this again, which I probably won't because it's just ok, I would defintely replace the arugula with asparagus. Way too bitter for the rest of the salad ingredients. I used canned mandarin oranges since I couldn't find a tangerine. It's easy and quick to prepare which is a plus.

We loved this salad! Instead of the avocado, we substituted some crumbled Maytag blue cheese and we used canned mandarin oranges instead of the tangerine. There is a restaurant nearby in Santa Monica that makes a similar salad and instead of arugula they use asparagus, they also use the Maytag blue cheese, that is where I got the idea. Will definately do again!

This was a good every day salad. I also used a can of mandarin oranges as suggested by a previous review as I didn't have a fresh nectarine on hand. The dressing was a bit too much for the amount of greens listed (to our tastes) so I just added more arugula and it was great!

This is a wonderful salad for a dinner party. I prepare everything in advance and put in seperate baggies. Then when it time to serve, I simply toss everything in a bowl, plate and serve. When I cut up the avacado I do them in bite size pieces and pour fresh lemon juice on them to keep from discoloring. Also, rather than go to all the work of peeling the tangerines - I use a small can of mandarine orange sections and don't add any of the juice. I was out of mayonaise this time and did not want to go to the store on Easter Eve - so I substituted Miracle Whip. This is a good salad anytime but especially nice for valentine's day with a heart theme.
