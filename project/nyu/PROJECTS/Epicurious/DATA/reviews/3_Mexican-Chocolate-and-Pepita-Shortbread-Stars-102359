These are absolutely wonderful. I added a bit extra flour for easier rolling. We got great reviews on these cookies and I personally could not keep my hands off of them!

Not good at all.

I made these and agree that the dough was fairly dry for a rolled/cut cookie. I had trouble transferring them to the cookie sheets and they tended to fall apart when I brushed them with the beaten egg. I think the next time I make these, I will avoid rolling altogether, press the dough into a brownie pan, and cut them into bars like normal shortbread. As they were, I made mini circular cookies and served them as a garnish on chocolate sorbet/vanillla ice cream. They are definitely quite tasty, but working with the dough was an issue for me.

These cookies were incredidibly good! The dough was not dry and the cookies were just like a shortbread should be. I had a hard time not eating them all myself. I ground the pepitas and then measured which resulted in some leftover pepitas so that may have been part of the dry problem for others. I also used some of the ground pepitas mixed with the sugar to sprinkle on the cookies before baking. I cannot recommend these highly enough. They are probably the best cookies I have ever tasted. BTW, I did use 60% cocoa chocolate.

The dough is very dry - I added a couple extra tablespoons of water. The cookies are delicious!

Good but not great cookies. I found them a little dry. If I were to make them again, I would make the cookies with about half the pepitas and then roll the cookies into the rest of the pepitas before cooking. I think the separation of flavors would be an improvement.

Great tasting recipe, easy to make (for shortbread/cut out cookies anyway). The thickness for rolling out isn't clear, so I guesstimated at 1/4 in...is that about right?

I made this for a Christmas party along with a host of other Christmas cookies and everyone was begging me for the recipe. It has a certain special slighty spicy quality that's really unique. The key is to use 4 ounces of really high quality chocolate - 55% pure at least. It goes nicely with the Mexican Wedding Cakes as well. Enjoy!

I didn't make this recipe, but I saw it in the magazine and the missing measure for cinnamon is 3/4 teaspoon.

There is a symbol where a number should be before the teaspoon of ground cinnamon in the ingredient list. Help!!

I made this several batches of this recipe for my husband and to give to a friend. They all said they loved it. The texture is more a pastry than a cookie. The last respondant should try it again!

Something is wrong with this recipe! The dough, made following the above directions, is too dry and will not roll into a ball or flatten into a disk. This recipe needs to be reevaluted. I had to throw out my dough because it would never make edible cookies.
