I'm not sure where LDQ619 went wrong, because this was an absolute winner last night here. The flavors were spot on. The curry balanced the sweetness of the apple cider, and the onions and celery were great compliments. We had some curry leaves on hand so added them along with the bay leaves and curry powder. We served it with gluten free corn pasta from Trader Joes. The kids loved the fact that I playfully read the post to say "finish with vanilla ice cream and butterscotch sauce" to mean put it on top of the pork chop. I put a dollop of ice cream on it, and it actually made a perfect accompaniment to this already delicious dish.

OMG I am so upset.... I ruined 4 beautiful pork chops. Reading this recipe,it sound so delicious. This dish was bloody horrible It was a TANGY mess of soupy onions & celery with sunken pork chops drenched in the horrible sauce. all I could taste was tang and gurr (and gurr is not even a flavor) I am sorry for hurting anyones feelings but this was the one dish I would never try or make again. I dont care if Emeril invinted the dish himself, it could be Paula's prize possesion.. it should be illegal thats what it should be. In all honesty it needs to be removed before someone else ruins their pork chops as I did. Think about the children that will go hungry when mom ruins dinner listening to you.....

This was just okay. I made it exactly as described. I liked the flavor of the sauce but it just didn't seem to go well with the pork chops. I used boneless chops. Others suggested that bone-in chops are better and that the meat is more tender if you cover and cook longer over lower heat. Maybe this would help the flavors meld better. I have several pork chop recipes that I really like so I don't think I'll make this again.

This was amazing! I tripled the recipe and used 6 bone in chops. Everything as is, except I simmered about 25 minutes covered and they came out perfect.

Easy for after work and a something different for pork chops! Substituted apple juice (1 cup) and 1/2 cup of chicken broth since I didn't have cider. Used no salt and made with olive oil instead of butter. The kids liked it and the pork chops (boneless) were moist and tender.

Made this recipe again tonight but did not have the apple cider on hand so I used Coca Cola instead. It worked very well and was delicous. The pork was very tender & juicy and the onions/celery quite tasty. Thumbs up on the Coca Cola.

This recipe has wonderful flavor. The first time I made it, I didn't have celery, so I added a bit of peeled, chopped apple. And I served it with spaetzle. Terrific!

This was excellent! I ended up having to add a little more cider, but it was perfect otherwise!

This was very tasty! I used Balti seasoning from Penzeys and it added a nice spice and heat. I braised the chops for 20 minutes, as another reviewer suggested, and they were kind of tough. Other than that, I loved this dish and will try it again. Served with oven roasted potato wedges and red cabbage braised with apples and cider from this site.

I used 2 types of curry powder (Chinese & Indian) also added 2 tsp of grated ginger and 1\2 tsp of powdered ginger, I garnished w/ ceyenne pepper (we like it a little hotter than most folks)

It was easy to make and tasted okay. My sauce also turned out watery... I did use apple juice instead of apple cider, maybe that was it? Not a bad recipe, don't think I'll make it again since I have a killer recipe for butter chicken which has the curry flavor.

Rating: 4
Very good, quick and easy. Husband loved it! The chicken broth suggested below is definitely a good idea. I didn't figure out it needed it till the end, so my sauce came out a little watery. Next time, I'll just substitute half the cider for chicken broth at the get-go.

Easy and good - great seasonal dish for fall. Nicer with bone- in pork chops.

Rating: 4
Surprisingly interesting flavor considering how few ingredients there are. I also subsituted chicken broth for 1/2 of the cider. For more tender chops, simmer the chops (covering the pan) about 20 minutes.

Rating: 3
To help prevent dryness, brining the pork beforehand really helped. The tip about cutting the sweetness with chicken stock is also a good idea.

Rating: 3
My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. One suggestion that I have is, to cut the sweetness is to add 1 Cup of the cider and 1/2 cup of Chicken Stock. We also made it with about 3/4 of an apple. Served it with jasmine brown rice and green beans. We will make this one again!

Wow! Made this last week, and my boyfriend and I both loved it! Nicely hot, but never overwhelming - a long, slow burn. I synthesized several reviewer suggestions + my own twists: browned chops (boneless) 2 mins. instead of 3. After they came out, I added some corn oil, 1 lg. white onion & 1 med. red onion (sliced) plus 2 cubed skin-on Gala apples (sweet-tart & fleshy) and some bottled roasted minced garlic, black pepper, and the bay leaf. Omitted celery. Let it all cook down and caramelize for a while, probably 15-20 mins on med-low, stirring occasionally. Added pinches of cayenne, garam masala, & ancho powder with the curry and thickened sauce with a little flour/water slurry. Chops came out super tender and flavorful. Served with saffron rice. Yum! Leftovers were even better!

Rating: 3
Try this for a GREAT dinner. Follow directions but use a pork loin or tenderloin (I usually skip browning this). Add a bag of sauerkraut to pan before cider (I also use a bit more cider). Transfer everything to a oven safe dish, lay pork on top & cook until pork is done. This is great w/ mashed potatoes. I've past this recipe on to many people & everyone loves it!

I needed a delicious dinner in less than an hour - this fit the bill! I had 10 boneless pork chops so I doubled the sauce. Made some changes: I only had apple juice - it worked out fine. I added one chopped apple, some garlic, S&P, a little cumin, cayenne and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to the sauce. Also thickened up a bit with a cornstarch slurry. It seemed a little odd with the pork, and mine did come out a little "tough" - maybe I overcooked them? I think it would be great with Chicken...I will be making this again!

These pork chops were delicious!! I doubled the number of prok chops but found I didn't need to double the amount of sauce. The taste was tangy and sweet--outstanding!! A great fall dish.

Based on the other review we kicked it up a notch and added more Curry and a little Cayenne Pepper. My husband really liked it (but this is a man who only likes veggies when they have been boiled beyond the point of recognition!) The 14 year old and I thought it was just ok. But it was quick and easy, and you always need a couple of those in your recipe box!

This turned out wonderfully. I added sliced Granny Smith apples to the onion/celery mixture. I also was generous with the curry, and yes, it needs salt & pepper. Try with rice and pour the sauce over it!

Even though the recipe was curried, it lacked flavor! It was plain and boring. I also added apples and thickened with cornstarch. Then I added some salt(!)The apples helped, but still, little flavor. My husband didn't care for it either, but politely finished it. I will not make again.

I made this tasty dish on Valentine's day for my new husband. Instead of a table spoon of curry I only put a tea spoon...and wow! The mix of the bay leaves and the curry was a treat for the taste buds. I will indeed make this again!

I found the curry to be over-powering, and didn't see the need for two cups of chopped onions. Most of the onion remained in the skillet. It was okay, but I wouldn't be in a rush to make it any time soon. I think you could get by with one cup of chopped onion, and cut back on the curry.

I too left out the celery and added a chopped apple. It was very good and I'd make it again.

I really liked this, even though I was the only one. I added a few tablespoonfuls of brandy, and pureed the celery and onions since young kids were eating it. It made for a thicker sauce. I also had trouble getting the chops done. I had to cook them more than twice as long as stated.

This was a great recipe and easy to make. I left out the celery and added 1 chopped apple and it turned out very well. I'd make it again in a second.

I really liked this recipe and made it with just a few variations. I left out the celery, and used one cup of red onions and one half cup yellow onions since the recipe didn't specify. I also added just a small amount of minced garlic with the onion. I thought the red onion cooked in the cider, curry sauce had a wonderful flavor. Also, I used hard cider rather than regular cider and added about two tablespoons heavy cream to the sauce just before removing it from the heat to give it a little thinkness. I really loved this recipe and will probably make it often. It had just the right amount of curry to give an excellent flavor.I used 3/4 inch thick, boneless pork chops, which called for a longer cooking time than specified in the recipe, but with the sauce they were hardly dry and tasted great. I can't wait to make this recipe for my parents.

This was pretty good, but not excellent. I added chopped apples with the cider, which was nice. Glad I made it, but probably won't make it again.

I made this for an "audience" of three. We all loved this recipe. I used twice as much onion as called for, just because it seemed like it would be nice to have them in the sauce. That was the only adjustment to the recipe, though I found it needed to cook a bit longer than specified. We used Odwalla apple cider and it added a fantastic flavor. We think potatoes and carrots might be added to this next time. And, oh, I served acorn squash on the side. A great complement.

I have been making this dish in Australia for years but with a twist! Add an equal amount of diced apple, skin on,(to compliment the cider) to the onion and saute both till golden brown, remove from pan, cook pork chops, throw onion/apple back into the pan all around and over the chops, add REAL FERMENTED 5% ALCOHOLIC cider, I use Mercury Genuine Draught Cider from Tasmania, but any "scrumpy" style with 'body' is good, and simmer part covered to reduce the liquid by half as the chops infuse the flavours, when finished stir in thickened cream and fresh ground coarse black pepper into the sauce around the chops serve and enjoy with a glass of the cider used! A bit of garlic fits in well when cooking off the onions&apple. Curry powder is optional on personal preference, I leave it out to concentrate on the apple/apple cider flavour mix. Of course the cook is continually checking the quality of the cider during this process! Which is why I enjoy cooking with wine! Hope this may interest some folks out there. Regards From David a Boarding School cook! I hope nobody gets confused and uses apple cider vinegar!! Dont drink it while cooking........

This was surprisingly quick and easy. Finally, a recipe with ingredients I actually have in my home! I cut the amount of curry down a little bit and only put in half the onions. It looked nothing like the picture but tasted good enough that it didn't matter.

Too many onions! And I am an onion lover! The recipe has possibilities to be great with some modifications. Cut onions to one cup, add curry powder to onions when sweating, and add more of it. Apple juice works as well as cider and usually on hand. Add some Apple brandy or regular brandy to the sauce at the end. Cook the pork less at the beginning or less at the end to prevent it drying out. Really a fast recipe!

Wow!! Delicious and easy...great for a beginner cook too.

A very quick and easy "pressed for time, but we want a good meal" workday dinner. The brining makes the difference (although I only used about 1/4 cup of light brown sugar). However, I found that sprinkling with extra salt made it a bit saltier than we liked. Would omit this step next time, and in future will try pairing it with sauteed brussels sprouts leaves with thyme, butter and toasted pistachios for a great autumn meal.

As a retired Chef I must say this recipe has all the earmarks for a great simple dish. A few adjustments. 1. Use only thick center cut pork chops. 2. Use Kosher Salt 3. Use a good curry powder and add a GENEROUS amount when you sweat the onions and celery. 4. Add in a good teaspoon of hot sauce. 5. Apple Juice works well, add apple jack when the chops are in the butter for xtra taste. 6. Reduce the sauce by at least half! The wife loves this!

A lot of great and good reviews. What the heck did I do wrong? Bland and not overly attractive. As a 48 yr old single male trying to cook to impress, this is not a meal I'd cook for a date. Then again, I like pan fried chops with ketchup.

We seasoned the pork with freshly ground coarsely pepper and because we did not have cider, we used Spiced Apple wine from Chaddsford winery in Pennsylvania. Green beans almondine and carrots made a good side dish and a Pinot Noir from the same winery topped this very tasty meal. You can access Chaddsford at: www.chaddsford.com

Great served with mashed potatoes. Add more celery and some carrots (all diced for a nice presentation) and you have veggies in the same dish. Marinate the pork as long as possible with the cider, bay leaf, curry powder (doubled), and black pepper for more flavor. Made it several times. My husband, who hates middle-American fare, eats this and loves it; it's more exciting than it looks. Make sure to brown the chops well or else they'll look pasty.

This was delicious. I initially made the mistake of reading the ingredient of apple cider as apple cider vinegar! Luckily I realized my mistake before adding the chops back to the pan so I threw it out and started over. I would recommend slicing the onions instead of chopping, makes for a more attractive dish, I think.
