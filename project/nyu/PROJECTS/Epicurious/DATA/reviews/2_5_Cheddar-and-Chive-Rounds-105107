I made for a wedding shower and everyone loved them. I got a lot of recipe requests. You do not need to butter the sandwiches to get the chives to adhere--they'll stick to the filling. These are beautiful and festive.

Served these as an appetizer, and 5 out of 6 people enjoyed them very much. Next time I will use a sweeter onion, chopped finer than I did this time. My guests said that they thought of "Wimpy Burgers" from Popeye when they first saw them. Will make this again!

This recipe was terrible. They looked pretty and were easy to make, but tasted terrible. Guests of all ages and food interests agreed it was bad. They politely tried one and left me with plenty at the end of the party. I salvaged my left overs by toasting the sandwiches the next day.
