I read all of the reviews before beginning this recipe. I sauteed onion and a homegrown Pasilla pepper in the bacon fat. Then I deglazed the pan with a shot of good whiskey. From there I followed the recipe except for the chipotle peppers, because our family doesn't like heat. I added smoked paprika and a slightly spicy ketchup we have with the barbecue sauce, and tasted carefully before baking. This was ridiculously good..oh, and I only had pinto beans and used 5 cans. This is a fun recipe to change up according to your tastes! But those that didn't care for it, I hope you tasted before baking..key to turning out a good dish..

I sweated the onions in the bacon fat before I added them to the pot. I used St Pauli Girl extra dark and Stubbs original BBQ sauce. I also used equal parts Great Northerns, pintos, and light red kidney beans because I like the look/texture/flavor of the variety. This is some good stuff. Can't imagine using any other baked bean recipe!

Awesome beans. I've been making these since the recipe first appeared in Bon Appetit. We especially love the leftovers for beans on toast in the morning. I've never changed anything in the recipe but I'm making them without the bacon today due to a request from a family member. Hope it doesn't kill the buzz.

I have made this dish twice, both times for a fairly small group. There was a lot of clamoring for the left overs. I followed the recipe exactly. One of the reasons why I rated this recipe exceptional is because it really is easy. The next time I make it (superbowl party) I am going to use dried beans instead of canned.

Made this for dinner last night and it was delicious. It was my first time to make baked beans and this is going to be my go to recipe. Left out the beer, added a little extra bbq sauce. We like spicy dishes so I used a little more chipotle. My husband, who usually adds catsup to all baked beans, even liked them just as they were. A definite keeper.

I'm not normally a big fan of beans in general, and I actually made this for my husband and father-in- law who were doing some work around the house, but I think I ended up liking it the most. Very nice flavour (I forgot to add the chipotles and didn't find it overly sweet as some reviewers did). Will make this again, esp. as a side party dish.

I've made this recipe exactly as it is written, but now I do a slight adaptation which mostly involves swapping the beer out for Woodford Reserve whiskey - 3/4 cup. I also swap out the molasses for pure maple syrup because I prefer the flavor of the maple. This is a wonderful recipe and allowing the beans to bake in the oven really does make them easy to do ahead of time and keep warm until you serve them.

I've made this recipe three of four times and it's now our standard baked beans dish for all cookouts. The only change I've made is to add a bit more bacon as a topping. And it's OK to crank up a bit more chipotle.

Rating: 4
Much better than standard baked beans. I only had bacon bits (the real ones) in the freezer, so used the equivalent for the 6 slices and added just a little canola oil and sauteéd the onion in them before combining with all of the other ingredients. I used about half of the chipotle as I was taking to a potluck a it had a nice flavor without bein overpowering. A great side to either pulled pork or BBQ'd brisket.

Rating: 2
Not that great. Way too spicy for the kids - and I used less chipotle than called for. Could also taste the beer - not what I was in the mood for - gave it a funky taste. Will keep looking for a good recipe. Sauce was also watery and not thick enough, when I cooked longer - beans were dry. I am from the south and enjoy all diff kinds of baked beans - but these - not so much.

Great. Enjoyed by all. Only change is that I did 1/25 the chilis since serving to kids. Also, cooked for closer to 1.5hrs to get beans a bit more tender.

Yep, this is a great one. I made this for a family gathering and it was enjoyed by all. The ONLY change I made was to omit the peppers. Beans and peppers don't agree with me and we also had some younger ones eating with us. I will use this often justdixie

These beans are just OK. You really have to want the taste of chipotle in your beans. I received greater raves about doctored canned beans. Perhaps it's our Northeastern taste buds and this recipe is better appreciated by our Texas friends!

I made this for a 4th of July pool party event. I added an extra can of beans and cut the chipotle back by at least half, since we were serving children as well as adults. I cooked them longer than the recipe called for and they thickened up nicely as they cooled a bit. They were a big hit!

I made this for a Father's Day dinner with a trio of ribs, coleslaw, and Brother Curry's Irish Soda Bread with raisins and caraway. My only changes were to eliminate the bacon as I had a guest who does not eat pork and to reduce the amount of beans to 4 19 ounce cans. This made the perfect amount of sauce to bean ratio. I used about two canned chipotle peppers, carefully seeded. I do recommend tasting regulalrly as one adds the peppers. The heat can come on very quickly. The soda bread and beans combination was fantastic. Canned beans pale in comparison.

I left out the chipotles because my husband can't eat spicy foods. Perhaps that is why the dish seemed too sweet. Other than the sweetness, it was a very good dish, even without the chilies.

HUGE hit with friends from Texas as a side dish with smoked BBQ brisket. These were the best beans I have ever had, but be warned; the amount of canned chipotle can yield VERY spicy beans (this may depend upon the brand of canned peppers). I added the peppers very gradually and stopped when I felt the heat was right. I ended up adding less than half the peppers called for in the recipe and guests commented that the beans were pretty spicy.Witht hat caution, make these. They are definitely something different from teh typical Boston-style baked beans.

This was really good but don't make the mistake that I made...I used extra spicy purchased barbecue sauce and it about ruined the dish with too much heat!!!

The reviewers all raved about these beans, so I tried them. I followed the recipe to the letter with high hopes that these would become a "go to" recipe for crowds or cookouts. I'm glad I tested them first before a debut. All they are is a pot of beans and barbecue sauce. The chipotles do add a bit of a kick. Not worth the effort. Buy a can of beans and add a squirt of BBQ sauce and you'd have the same thing. They did LOOK good and they are certainly edible.

I really liked these baked beans. I made exactly as written, except I only used 4 cans of beans as reviewers mentioned this recipe was too dry (plus, I wasn't having 8 people for dinner). I used 4 chipotles in adobo, don't know how many tsp that is. I like things spicy, and it really was! I will def make again, but next time will use navy beans. Like some others, I didn't like the Great Northerns in this. I also might reduce the sugar. It was a tiny bit too sweet for my taste. Otherwise, this is a winner!

I'm not a fan of traditional baked beans, but I loved these! The only changes I made was to use homemade BBQ sauce (had some extra) and skipped adding the bacon pieces (but still used the bacon fat). I didn't bother with the parsley either. It was delicious! I wish I'd discovered it earlier in the summer so I could have made it more often!

These baked beans have a wonderful complexity of flavors. I loved the addition of chipotle ( I used the canned in adobo sauce). I did leave out the brown sugar, thinking that the molasses would be enough sweetness, and it was. I also used a combination of great northern, black and small red kidney beans and it does make for a prettier presentation and more interesting texture. I halved the recipe and it was just the right amount for the 8 of us as a side dish with pork barbecue and slaw.

Rating: 4
This was wonderful. I generally dislike baked beans (esp. canned) because I find them to be overly sweet and lacking depth. This recipe is everything baked beans should be, and was a major hit at a recent BBQ. For slightly firmer texture, I used dried beans, soaked overnight and then boiled for an hour or so. Also, the quantities noted here are crazy -- I halved this recipe and it was just the right amount for a BBQ of 14 or so (as a side), filling a good-sized round pyrex. For the beer, I used the wonderful Otter Creek Octoberfest, and "Bone Suckin Sauce" for the BBQ.

Rating: 4
Smokin'!!! Based on previous reviewers used 5 cans beans and found the sauce amount to be perfect.. Only had dark molasses so cut down to 2 tbl. Used 2 tbl (i.e., 6 teaspoons) chopped chipotle in adobo and found it nicely spicy and not at all offensive - no one complained and everyone loved it! Fed 7 with surprisingly, but sadly, no leftovers.

Big hit at our cook- out. Followed the recipe exactly but did not think it was too hot using all 6 tsp. of the chipotle chilies. Just a really nice kick! It did not say to rinse the beans but I did. Did anybody do it without rinsing the beans and if so, how did it effect the taste? Also, used chipotle chilies in adobe sauce which is the only canned chipotle chilies I could find.

These are the only baked beans I'll make from now on. They have the down-home flavor that reminds you of your mom's southern baked beans, but add a lot with the chipotle kick. So easy to make, and they were received very well at the latest BBQ, with 2 recipe requests.

A perfect combination of spicy and sweet for people who complain beans are too much of either. I wouldn't change a thing because the ingredient measurements created a perfect balance that was subtle but the smoky chipotle chilies really packed in some heat and flavor. This makes a LOT.

I made the recipe with about 2 T. of Chipotles but otherwise followed the recipe. When i took it out of the oven, the beans seemed dry, so I mixed in about another 3/4 cup of bbq sauce. I let it sit overnight, reheated it, and served it with Xmas dinner. It was the favorite dish of the night!

Okay...I do not have a lot of casserole dish recipes to pull from, so when I was asked to bring a food dish to our company potluck, I turned to Epicurious.com for a recipe that was easy to make, transport, reheat, and serve. This is the recipe I decided on. It didn't let me down. I was shocked at how well received the bean dish was. My co-workers went out of their way to tell me how much they liked it, characterizing the dish as "baked beans for adults." With the notable exception of forgetting to add the cooked bacon to the dish, I followed the recipe faithfully. The dish turned out so well without the bacon, I now leave it out intentionally.

Rating: 4
Delicious! A good recipe to bring for potlucks and barbecues. Made it just as per the recipe and they came out wonderfully, not too spicy, but with a little bite (Victoria1, it's supposed to be 4-6 *teaspoons* worth of chipotles, not 4 whole peppers!) That being said, adding the chipotles and some of their adobo sauce is integral--that's how you get the wonderful smoky flavor!

I love spicy food, but the four chipotle peppers made it a little too hot for me and my guests. Next time I will limit the peppers to two. Otherwise really good beans.

This is without a doubt the best baked bean dish ever! I have been making baked beans for years and I use most of the ingredients listed in this recipe in my own baked bean recipe. What made all the difference was the dark beer, soy sauce and chipotle chilies. I only used 4 teaspoons of the chilies.I added chopped green and red bell pepper (about 1 cup)sauted with the onion in the bacon grease. Everyone at the barbeque raved about this dish! It has been added to the "Family Favorites" section.

This was deluxe!!! It was the first thing to go at my 4th of July party. I doubled the recipe, and didn't add the bacon and dripping until the end into one half. So I had vegetarian beans as well as the delicious bacon beans. I will be making these again soon - and they are a must have for an BBQ.

These were great beans. Loved the sauce!! I made them from 2 bags from small white beans (Goya), soaked the beans overnight and then cooked for 90 minutes with garlic, onion and thyme. They smelled really good already. This makes a ton of beans so I doubled the liquids and the bacon. I used Guiness Beer and Cattlemens BBQ sauce. I only put 1 chile tsp chile because of the other reviews but I could have used 2 or 3 tsp and still been OK for the kids. I baked them covered for about 90 minutes and reheated in the crock pot the next day. Warning.. if you use a crock pot, reheat on warm or low or the sugar can make the edges burn. These BBQ Beans are worth the effort. Friends that say they dont even like baked beans like these.

Rating: 4
I can't believe that some people gave this one star! I don't even like baked beans that much, and these were incredible. A perfect balance of smokey/sweet/hot. The key must be to use really good ingredients, though--we used organic smoked bacon, and sauce form a local butcher that is pretty amazing all on its own. I used 3 chiptoles and a spoonful of the adobe sauce they come in, and it was nicely spicy if you like hot food. If that's not your thing, I'd stick with one or two chilies. I'm going to make it again tonight and try cooking it in the slow-cooker tomorrow.

I first made this recipe for a Fourth of July barbecue. It was a big hit. Reading through the comments, I've made the following tweaks: I use Guinness for the dark beer and I saute the onion in the bacon drippings. I've since made it four or five times, and the last time my husband came back from the grocery with *dried* great northern beans instead of canned. No problem! I soaked them overnight, and then cooked them for about 90 minutes with garlic, onion, and thyme, before continuing with the recipe. ( Two pounds of dried beans, after they've been soaked, yield slightly more beans than the six cans called for, so I had to adjust all the liquids up slightly.) My husband says these were the best, and I have to agree!

A note to the person who wants to crock pot it. I made this in advance for a party and what I did was cook according to the directions a day in advance, fully refrigerate, and then just warm in the crockpot. it may take awhile to rewarm the whole amount, so you may want to microwave it in the crock first to help it along. Anyway, it came out great this way.

I made this dish as written (almost) for a company party and it blew out of the dish, nothing left. The only minor changes were only 1 tbs of the chipotle (I thought recommended was a little on the fiery side) and Fosters which isn't really a dark beer. It was just right on the heat and people did mention that they could taste the beer like some other reviewers commented, but not in a bad way. Remarkable since the bean dish usually gets ignored by most people. Personally I loved it myself.

Outstanding and delicious. I cooked the crumbled bacon and onions together. I also used dark molasses instead of brown sugar and light molasses, thanks to the cook from Ithaca. I used four cans of beans, but should of used 6 cans because we didn't have enough for a second meal. I will continue to make these because the taste is out of this world.

Generally followed the recipe though I too cooked the onions down a bit in the bacon grease and omitted the chipotles. I also cooked for a couple of hours at 250 just so they'd be out of the way and would free up my oven before my guests arrived - worked quite well. Think the only change I'd make next time is in my choice of barbecue sauce: I used El Paso Chili Company BBQ sauce, which was good, but after discovering the absolutely incredible Molasses and Beer Barbecue Sauce from this site, I intend to use it for everything in the future!

We left out the chipotles because of the crowd we were serving these to, and the recipe stands fine on its own with no heat. The changes I made to the recipe: I cooked the onion a little in the bacon drippings to soften them up; I covered the beans with foil while in the over to prevent them from drying out; and I used regular molasses, as that was all I had on hand. There was no hint of a beer taste/smell after an hour in the oven (I used Bass Ale). The beans aren't sickiningly sweet like many canned beans. I would definitely make these again!

Tasty and substantial enough for a meal (starving student). After going through the reviews, I made the following adjustments: 5 cans beans instead of 6; used dark molasses in lieu of brown sugar and light molasses; sauteed the onions with the bacon; added 1 can diced tomatoes (drained); also heated all sauce ingredients together before mixing with beans and added 1 can tomato paste (to thicken the sauce a bit). Made a ton & reheats like a dream.

I loved this recipe because it's very simple. The only thing I changed was adding more chipotles, we love spicy food. I am Mexican and I love hot foods.

Are Great Northern Beans the same as Navy Beans? Couldn't find any Great Northern's in the store so I used Goya Cannelini's (white kidneys) and they didn't cook very well for the 1 hour time the recipe called for. Many of the beans were still too hard and dry. Would par boil some Navy Beans that had been soaked overnight. The flavor was EXCELLENT however. Used some Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and amber beer. Only used 1/2 the chipotles and still had plenty of kick. Will definitely make these again but with beans that cook well within the 1 hour time frame. Any suggestions on how to get the beans perfectly are welcomed.

A delicious, easy and unique baked bean recipe!

Not crazy about these, but would give it another try with a few variations (only because it's pretty simple and quick recipe) 1) I would cover them in the oven (the top beans were crispy!), 2) I might sub apple juice for beer - not a beer fan and the taste really came thru, and 3) would take other reviewer's recommendation and sub a couple cans of pork & beans because the sauce was too runny - might give it some creamyiness. We'll see!

These were delicious though I did have to cut the chipotles down to only 2 teaspoons. I also used regular beer rather than dark.

These baked beans were delicious! I made them exactly as Dane suggested, except I didn't add the green pepper. I took them to the summer picknic for our local school children participating in the fine arts camp. I would ONLY suggest that you not bring them to such a function where you are stuck in a school van for a four hour drive afterward. We had to stop several times for the privy, and to air out the van. It was miserable for the girls at first, but then it just became a joke as to who could "out stinky" each other! The girls, and the drvier were...."blowing kisses" all the way home. Next time.....Beano!

I thought this recipe was great, but I did make a few changes that, in my opinion, made it even better. I increaded the bacon to 8 slices, and instead of using 1 1/2 cups of chopped onion, I used 3/4 cups of onions and 3/4 cup of chopped scallions. I also added 1/2 cup chopped bell pepper and 2 cloves of minced garlic. Also, instead of using 6 cans of Great Northern beans, I used 2 cans Great Northern, 2 cans Black Beans, and 2 cans of Pork & Beans. This along with topping the dish with more bacon, and using chopped cilantro instead of chopped parsley as a garnish gives the beans a more southwest flavor and look. LOVE IT!!!!

Rating: 3
This is a real good basic recipe for baked beans that can be jazzed up or down a whole bunch of ways-- I highly suggest playing with it! I also agree that the quality of the bbq sauce makes the dish, so make sure and use your favorite. I like Dinosaur Wango Tango or Robb's Hot bbq (a local here in ABQ). Something good and warm! I serve these with the bbq brisket recipe on this site, and corn on the cob. Talk about a wonderfully filling meal!

Rating: 4
I've made these beans twice now with fabulous results the first time and almost inedibly hot the second. I swear I added the same amount of chipotles each time so I can only guess that there is a huge difference from can to can. I've noticed the same thing when I make chile (got ot have chipotles in the chile!). So go slow and taste as you go. Also the BBQ sauce you use will make a big difference. I use a Kansas City style sauce with lots of molasses and smokiness.

The best baked bean recipe. I've tried many recipes and this one is tops. One recommendation - those who do not like very spicy just leave out the chipotle peppers they are not necessary.

Rating: 4
This is one of those recipes that becomes tradition very quickly. My family specifically requests these (and ONLY these) beans on virtually every occasion, including Thanksgiving. I just had to make them again for our Easter dinner. I saute the onion before adding to the mix and use turkey bacon. I don't add any chipotles, probably because the first time I made it I didn't have any and everyone loved that version. Perfect picnic food, too. Enjoy!

I fixed these beans for my husband's birthday cookout. What a hit! Even my kids who don't like beans liked these. They are even better the second day.

I consider myself to be a good cook, willing to try all sorts of foods and ingredients, so I am a little confused at the number of "4-fork" reviews. I like chipotle peppers as much as the next person, but this is way too hot. Also, even if you toned down the heat the flavors are nothing out of the ordinary. I've eaten better baked beans out of a can.

Rating: 3
I made this recipe for a New Year's Day Party in which everyone was assigned to bring a dish. The beans were great and well received--"brilliant," in the words of one guest. One guest complained that they were a little too hot, but another said the amount of peppers I used (four teaspoons) was "perfect." One little variation of my own: I added some sour mash bourbon to the mix to wash out the measuring cup after it had barbacue sauce and molasses in it. Next time I make this, I will padd more sour mash.

These beans rock!! I've never made beans before and was asked to bring some to a party. Incredibly easy and delicous-I doubled the recipe and there was none left! I used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and used Jack Hard Cola instead of beer(also added a little more Jack as it was a drinking crowd) and they were delicious! Was told they were the best beans many ever had! Can't wait to make them again!

As baked beans go, these are hands down the most interesting I've ever had. As with the others, browning the onions seemed like an obvious choice. I used Masterpiece KC barbeque sauce and New Castle Brown Ale, which both worked out nicely. I baked them the day before, covered, to keep them from drying out, then baked them again before serving. Even scraping out the seeds and measuring the chipotles carefully at 5 tsps, these beans were not for the faint of heart. I served them at a picnic to a rather traditional group, and overheard several comments about the heat. Even so, every drop was eaten which means people were back for seconds. I look forward to making them for a more adventurious crowd!

Excellent recipe! I made these beans for a family B-B-Q and the were the hit of the party, much to my father's dissappointment (it was his birthday). It has been demanded by my family that I bring them again for Thanksgiving.

Saw this recipe and had to try it with my barbequed ribs. Everyone at the party demanded the recipe for these beans. I find them to be just hot enough, but some may find them a little too hot... consider making two batches, one hot, one not. Make 'em in the morning in a crock pot and let them simmer all day long... delicious!

Very good beans. If you are serving to people (like me) who have a low tolerance for spicy/heat I would leave the chipotles out or cut the amount in 1/2. I also sauteed the onions and it added a wonderful sweetness to it.

I made this recipe real fast, just a few hours before I had to bring the dish to a dinner. I really liked the way it turned out. I used all of the ingredients as listed except for the beer. I didn't have dark beer so I used Genny Cream Ale. Also, I used Kraft original recipe barbeque sauce. I'm going to make them again.

Rating: 4
These are FABULOUS! Don't know what the problem is for the naysayers. Saute the onion, YES. Use Dark Beer, prepare the day before and re-heat if you can. But they are great even if you don't do these things. I prepare this every year for a potluck that several professional cooks and gourmets attend. THEY ALL WANT THE RECIPE! Never any leftovers.

Everyone loved these. I used half pinto and half great northern beans, Jack Daniels No 7 grilling sauce, and Michelob black and tan. I didn't use all of the chilies...only about 3/4 of the stated amount. Fantastic!!

It beats the traditional baked beans recipes that I've tried--I sauteed the onion with a chopped green pepper in the bacon grease before mixing it all together and it worked out well. Those who don't like spice will want to go easy on the chipotles.

This dish was O.K. but that was about it! I can beleive people raving so much about it, I like my beans a little thicker and a little more punch.

Made this for an office barbeque/potluck. They were very well received. Unique flavor from the dark beer and chipotles... not your common bean recipe. This unique flavor could elicit a strong reaction... I could see people either liking this recipe or hating it. Tried some the evening I made them and then re-warmed them in the oven the next day for our office lunch. Definitely better on Day Two after the flavors "got to know one another." Per other reviewer's suggestions, sauteed the onions in bacon fat prior to baking. Quick, easy, and very good... far better than canned beans with minimal effort.

I followed the recipe exactly as printed and made these for a pigroast of 50ppl. I'm not a huge baked beans fan but I was hoping to get some positive comments from those who are (after reading these GREAT reviews). No one said a word and they hardly got touched. I threw away LOTS of beans!! Maybe it just wasn't a bean crowd?

I loved this recipe! Probably the best baked beans I've ever had -- although I will not be using quite as many chipotles next time. Even though I am a spice fanatic this recipe had a tiny bit too much heat!

Can't believe there could be any negative reviews on this dish! I've made it dozens of times and, without exception, it was devoured. I vary the amount of chipotles according to whom I'm serving (that spicey/smokey flavor is a new experience to some) and occasionally substitute freshly chopped cilantro instead of parsley for the garnish - again not a good idea for your less adventurous guests!

Ironically, I found this recipe elsewhere. It's an exact copy of the one I have from Tracy Anderson of S. Anderson Vineyards - maybe she authored this one too? Anyway, I LOVE these baked beans! Have been searching for years for a perfect recipe and this is it. Couldn't find the canned chipotle chiles so I bought powdered instead. Used less of course but added enough for a good "bite". I serve this with Tracy's BBQ Dry Rub recipe (which I use on tri-tip) plus corn on-the-cob and other summer fixins. Can not tell you how many guests I have impressed with this meal. Simply perfect! p.s. Here is the dry rub recipe: Barbecue Dry Rub 4 Tbsp paprika 1 Tbsp chili powder 1 Tbsp garlic powder 1 Tbsp onion powder 1 Tbsp dried Oregano 2 Tbsp salt (Kosher salt preferred) 1 Tbsp ground black pepper 3/4 cayenne pepper 1 Tbsp sugar 2 or 3 pork ribs

Not really worth the effort, and FYI--it makes a LOT of beans. I'd make it again if I had everything on hand, but tossing a couple of chipotles in adobo into a pot of Bush's Bold and Spicy Beans sounds a lot easier. (And is tastier).

MMMMM-MMM! So good! I've been wating for an occasion to make this recipe for ages, and finally had my chance for a Fourth party. We were not disappointed--they're sooo deliciously sweet/hot! I halved the recipe, used red, black and white beans, and sauteed the onions in the bacon drippings--everything else, I stuck to the recipe with fabulous results! I used about 2 1/2 teaspoons chipotles (removed the seeds from about half of them) and they had a great kick. Don't wait! Make these!

Rating: 3
Definitely "a keeper." Served for a Fourth of July barbecue with smoked ribs and chicken. The flavors used in the beans were wonderful together. The beer gives the dish just a hint of something different without being odd. I only used 4 teaspoons of the chipotles and that was plenty for our tastes...just a little kick. One thing I would do differently would be to saute the onions first in the pan drippings. They didn't cook down and were a little crunchy after baking the beans for an hour.

For fourth of July I made this recipe in my crockpot. I had it on low for about 8 hours, and it turned out wonderful, and definitely spicy. I used six chipotle chilies, and it was hot. Everyone loved it. My brother described it very well as 'nuclear'.

Made these for a BBQ (no changes from the recipe except as noted below) and they were very good and liked by all. one thing to note -- the ingredients should include salt. the beans i purchased were not salted and i am glad i took a taste before i put them in the oven. overall, a success and i will keep the recipe -- everyone is always "surprised" that anyone would go to the trouble to "make" BBeans.

I made this for my husbands birthday party. It was a hit. Different than the usual baked beans. I'd go easy on the chipotle, 6 tsp. is aggressive. I made it the night before, and I'd suggest doing that to get the flavors to meld together better

Fabulous. Timing for a weekday dinner didn't allow me to bake them, so I threw everything into a crock pot (gasps from the purists!) and let them simmer all day. I did this the day before the party (as folks said they were even better the second day) and then just reheated them on the stove top for the party. My guests scrapped up every bit of beans (no leftovers). They loved them. I also used a variety of beans. Will probably increase the chipotle peppers next time from 4 as the taste was wonderful. Didn't have dark beer or light molasses so I substituted red beer and dark molasses.

Everyone thought this was terrific and I play to a tough crowd, an Italian mother-in-law that can cook the pants off of anyone . She even took some home for later. Now that is something !!I substuted light brown sugar for the dark just because that is what I had and we couldn't find a light molasses so we used medium. It turned out so terrific that I'm making it again this weekend for a potluck . I used 4 tsp of the chili and that seemed right . MaybeI'll put in 5 the next time around .

These baked beans were a hit at my family potluck dinner. I left out the peppers and substituted cola for the beer. I made them in a dutch oven, not a 13x9, so I baked them an additional 40 minutes at 250 to thicken them up. I think the beans would have been great with the peppers and plan to put them in the next time I make this dish. Yum!

I can't believe anyone would use a store-bought BBQ sauce for this recipe! For heaven's sake, make your own BBQ sauce that will match well with the other ingredients.

I served these beans at a casual dinner party. Everyone who went back for seconds did so for these beans. I did not add the soy sauce, as it was the only ingredient I was afraid was "just too much". Contrary to another review, the chipotles made the dish. Rather than use just Great Northerns, I used four different kinds of beans. Made for a great presentation.

BEAN HEAVEN! These were sooo good. I too sauteed the onion in the drippings to soften. I used a mixture of beans including light and dark red kidney, black, and northern beans for a calico effect. I splurged and bought Weber Grill's original bbq sauce. It's the sauce they use in their restaurant. A less-tomatoey, darker sauce that tastes between a steak sauce and a bbq sauce. YUMMMMMMMMMMY

Yum! Made this as a side dish with a brunch (Brit influence to have beans with eggs). Didn't have the chiles so substituted Thai chili sauce and few shots of Tobasco. This was so easy and fast--I'll never bother with the overnight soaking of beans and baking next day for hours. Partner not as crazy about this as I was but then again he's not British. I will definitely make this again and again when BBQ season rolls around. Thanks!

I made this tonight as part of an "Indian Summer" dinner and everyone loved it. My changes were: used turkey bacon instead of pork, sauteed the onion for a few minutes to soften before adding it to the mix, baked for 1.5 hours at 350 then let it set for about 20 minutes. Skipped the chiles. Delicious!

Truly great tasting baked beans, and I am not a baked bean fan. The only changes I made were to brown the onions in the bacon grease and add some garlic. Also, used pepper bacon, so added a bit of liquid smoke for a smokier flavor. This is a good, zesty, simple side dish. Will definitely make again.

YUMMY IN THE TUMMY! This is a fabulous recipe. It will be difficult to get away with opening a can of baked beans again after serving these. I sauteed the onion in a small amount of oil and omitted the bacon as my children are vegetarians. Instead I added a few drops of liquid smoke to the mixture. Reheating makes them even better and the smell in the house as they cook is wonderful. A real winner!

Excellent recipe! It took more time than my simple, thrown-together baked beans recipe, but the crowd loved it! In fact, among my group of friends, these have become known as the "Magic Beans" (due to the beer), and they are requested often. Great flavor, good spices. I also reduce the number of peppers involved -- my crowd just can't handle that type of heat. Besides that, it's great as is!

These are 100% different from my Baked Beans..which are more of a holiday or special occasion type of dish.

I made this for a work pot-luck yesterday. I did cook the onion in the bacon grease, and the only other change was to use regular molasses and light brown sugar (what I had in the house). Otherwise made exactly as written. I didn't think they were nearly sweet enough (I'll try once more with the correct molasses and dark brown sugar, but I can't believe it'd make much difference!). My husband liked them, however, and three people at work did, as well. Most others thought they were too spicy (I used about 5 teaspoons of the chipotles), but I really liked the level of spice. I also thought the beer was too prominent (the entire batch smelled like beer, even after cooking). Maybe I need a different beer--any suggestions??? I'll try these once more to see if I can sweeten them up.

"Who made the beans? I want to go home with them." This was the first comment overheard about this dish at a potluck picnic. Taking the lead from other reviewers, I sauteed the onions in bacon drippings, used 6 cans beans, add a bit more beer and 5 teaspoons chipotles. YUM.

Easiest and best b-b-q bean recipe I've ever made. Followed the recipe pretty closely, but I added one can less beans, and didn't drain them too well, as I like my beans a little soupy. I was worried that the canned beans would break up and turn to mush, but I cooked them in the oven 45 minutes, refrigerated overnight, and rewarmed the next day, covered, for 30 minutes with no harm done. In fact, probably better. I did saute the onion in the bacon fat for a while, which I would recommend. Also, the finished product still tastes a lot like whatever b-b-q sauce you use, so make sure it's one you like. And finally, I like to serve mine with a little chopped, pickled jalapeno for extra oomph. No more soaking old beans overnight for me.

I made these for a cookout and was terrified they wouldn't turn out right (especially when I badly miscalculated the difference between dried beans and canned beans), but they were a big hit.

I made this for the second time last night. As with the first time, I was repeatedly asked for the recipe and was told that "there beans are terrific!" I increased both the onion and bacon, browned the onion in the bacon fat, added a little garlic, and used a smoky BBQ sauce. I also used a variety of beans. The aroma was wonderful as was the taste. I used only 4 teaspoons of chipolte because of those who came for dinner. For myself, I add more!

No one commented on the beans, but there wasn't much left. I held back on the chipolte only because our group is not used to allot of heat. I added garlic, cilantro & fried the onions in the bacon fat. There was still something missing for my taste buds. Perhaps it was the bottled bbq sauce I used. Will follow the suggestion by previous cook next time. This is really an easy recipe. I did all but add the beer & froze.

I just made this again this weekend and realized as I tasted it that I have always found the amount of Dijon mustard called for to be overpowering. Both times I have ended up adding more ketchup and brown sugar etc etc to try to compensate. Next time I would start with only 1 T of Dijon. I used the Simple Sweet and Tangy BBQ Sauce from the July/Aug 2000 Cook's magazine (terrific recipe and much cheaper than using a bottle of commercial sauce). It got more rave reviews. This is definitely still a keeper. Don't skimp on the chipotles.

Rating: 3
These were great, a nice change from really tomato-y or too sweet versions I've made in the past. The chipolte chilies add a nice (and noticable) bite--even with only 5 teaspoons added. Depending on the crowd, you may want to adjust the heat. I also sauted the onion in the bacon drippings before adding as I like the mellow flavor of cooked onions.

Rating: 3
I made these beans for a medium-sized get together. The dish is very tasty but not a showstopper. If you want a showstopper, you'll have to get creative and add that secret ingredient, maybe finely chopped garlic or chopped cilantro?? I lightly rinsed the canned beans since they were kind of gummy, and added less peppers than called for. I also used regular molasses, which was fine. Definitely had a little bite and a nice deep taste, just didn't stand out greatly amongst all the other offerings.

I used homemade barbecue sauce, and instead of bacon, used real bacon bits. Also made the beans from scratch using canelli beans. I skipped the beer because I didn't have any, but will use it the next time. Absolutely wonderful. The barbecue sauce is the key, perhaps a little liquid smoke would be good too.

This is a fast, delicious dish! Perfect side dish for a BBQ. I cut the chippolte sauce in half because I was serving children...they loved it!! I also used dark molasses and it turned out fine! (makes alot too!)

Good & spicy. They're my husband's favorite baked beans...ever! Everyone who has had them has loved them, too. If you're not used to spicy foods, start out with only 2-3 tsp. of the chipotle peppers. I used top-quality thick sliced bacon & a gourmet BBQ sauce. The sauce definetly effects the flavor, so choose one you like.

Great! I'm not a big baked beans fan, but these won me over. They were easy to make and everyone loved them. They were also great reheated the next day and the smoky flavor seemed to increase a bit in reheating. I took the advice of the prior reviewers and added a slurry of cornstarch/water once they came out of the oven since they seemed a little soupy, and they were just fine after that. A keeper!

A fresh idea on an old, usually boring, standby. The chipotles and bacon give the dish a great smoky flavor. A great sidedish for a summer cookout.

Wow, what a great bean recipe. Served them with Bourbon BBQ Ribs and everyone kept saying the ribs were great but the beans....This is so quick and easy I will never spend 8 hours baking beans again.

I grew up hating baked beans...until I made this recipe out of curiosity. Delicious! Not too sweet and just spicy enough. This is a huge recipe. I made it for a BBQ for ten...good thing I didn't mind eating beans every day for the next four days.

Served this dish recently at a BBQ and everyone raved about it. So unbelievably tasty. We have prepared it three times since then and have "kicked it up a notch" with more chilies. An absolute winner!

I made this recipe for the first time last week for a cookout for 70+ people. Many said they were the best baked beans they had ever eaten! And I agree!

These beans were great. The best I've ever had. I made them yesterday. My picky fiance even liked them!! They had a wonderful smokey flavor and weren't sticky sweet. I cut the recipe in half and baked them in an 8x8 pan. I still cooked them for an hour though. They turned out great. I took the suggestions of previous cooks and added cornstarch. I'll definitely make these again.

Wow! I loved these beans! So many baked beans reciped seem to be "bean candy," but in this dish the sweetness is very well balanced with the other complex flavors. FYI, I made it without the bacon and had no regrets. A real crowd pleaser.

Got rave reviews when I took this to a barbecue. Couldn't believe they could be so great using canned beans. Definitely a keeper.

Baked bean lovers have to try these beans at least once! Saute the onions in the bacon grease, use a variety of beans (red, black & pinto)for extra color, and enjoy! You'll never want to make them any other way! Use the chipotle sparingly...if you use too much, you'll ruin these wonderful beans. If there seems to be too much liquid...just bake a little longer and skip the parsley.

I made these beans to go with a pulled pork recipe from this issue. Both were fabulous. I halved the recipe and changed the beans to pintos and small whites, and my boyfriend (an avowed baked bean connoisseur) pronounced them his favorite of all time! We plan on making them again for a Mother's Day get together we're having. Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.

The only thing I changed was to cut the recipe in half. How could there be so much wonderful stuff in such a BORING dish?

These Beans Are Awesome! I've made this recipe three times already, with rave reviews each time. I first debuted this at my company picnic and they were gone before any of the three other recipes.

These are great beans. We had them with BBQ'D ribs, a real crowd pleaser. Would have liked the sauce to thicken a bit more though. Will try the cornstarch idea next time.

Great combination of sweetness and heat. I, too, may have overdone it with the chipotles - the heat seemed to have intensified during the cooking process - I've loved it, my husband thought it a bit hot! It's a great way to use my leftover stock of Y2K beans.

I made this dish for Christmas eve dinner to go along with a baked ham and it is wonderful.

Excellent! I sauteed the onions in the bacon fat and I skipped the parsley (Parsley on baked beans?). I used one bag each of great northern, red kidney and pink (rosada) beans, which I had presoaked and cooked. Tripling the rest of the ingredients provided the right amount of sauce for that amount of beans. I used two bottles of Negro Modelo beer.

They beans were great! I, too, was not bale to locate molasses, so I omitted. Instead of six slices of bacon, I used about half a jar of Hormel's real bacon bits. Good idea to saute the onions, though. I tried using the crockpot for this recipe, and I found about 2 1/2 hours on the high setting cooked everything through. At the end of the recipe, I added 1 tbsp. of corn starch mixed with a little water to thicken the sauce. Took these to a party and everyone loved them.

Wow! But I'd cut back on the BBQ sauce, and let the peppers speak for themselves. It was an interesting supper - everyone liked it, but the afterburn sorta slowed them down! Suggest anyone making it halve the recipe, and start with a min quantity of peppers if they don't know what chipotle's are like.

My husband, who MUST follow recipes to the word, made this and it was wonderful. I'm sure varying the beans would make it more colorful, but the flavors could hardly be improved.

This was a great change from ordinary baked beans! They were even better the next day. The flavors had more time to blend and the dish was more spicy. I served tham at a party and everyone loved them.

WOW!! This receipe is fast, easy and the taste is out of this world and on its way to my personal receipe box!! A great meal anytime!!! I omitted the chili's & I still thought the beans had a great "kick" to them. Not being a fan of super spicy food, I can just imagine if I had added them. Also I left out the molasses too as I didn't have access to any.

Easy recipe that I prepared 1 day ahead, added the beer just before baking, and baked it as noted just before serving. My guests loved it. I was surpirsed at how much 'heat' the chipotle chilies added. 4 teaspoons is plenty, I used 6! I halved the recipe for 4 people.

Great recipe. Even my 14 year old daughter liked it and she is the very pickiest!

This dish was my contribution to a bbq dinner party. They were excellent. I added a little more bbq sauce once the beans were done to make them look moister, but it's not necessary. I will make these again very soon!!

Delicious!! Six people ate almost the entire dish. I did saute the onion in the bacon grease before baking. Baked about l hour and then reheated for another hour. I added about 2 l/2 cups onions (because I had already chopped them).

This was fantastic. An added plus was the use of canned beans. This made life much easier and I didn't have to plan too far ahead.

I've already made this at least four times. I tend to use a lot of chipolte so its pretty spicy. Recipe can also be halved and works just as well.

I thought these beans were great! The only thing I would change is to saute the onions in the bacon drippings first. I baked the beans for 1 1/2 hours and the onions were still a little crunchy.

Absolutely delicious. A friend who said she had never eaten baked beans in her entire life because she "just knew she wouldn't like them", had 3 helpings!! I used the 4 teaspoons of chipotle chiles, and this was plenty. Wonderfully spicy, sweet, and smoky. Good hot, lukewarm, even cold.
