This was good, but I should have brined my eggplant first (it was really bitter and I ended up having to cheat and add some butter). I used a fraction of the cheese b/c of other reviews and it was nice and creamy, but not overwhelming. I think I might make this in the winter -- it's too heavy for summer.

I made this for a dinner party of 10 people. Everyone loved it. It is easy to prepare. I used feta instead of gorgonzola since I already had it, worked well.

Rating: 4
I used half the amount of Gorgonzola to cut down richness. Dicing eggplant instead of finely chopping works fine and using globe eggplants when Japanese are hard to find is also just fine. Delicious! A wonderful vegetarian meal with salad.

I accidently used Bleu Cheese instead of gorgonzola and it was extremely rich. Still good though!

Yum. I used creamy dolce Gorgonzola instead of Gorgonzola crumbles and it added a wonderfully creamy texture.

Rating: 3
This was good, but I think it was a little on the rich side. The strong flavors of gorgonzola and sundried tomatoes were somehwhat overpowering. Next time I will use less tomatoes and gorgonzola and more eggplant. To prevent the mushrooms from getting too soggy I first put them in the oven (rounded side up) for 10 minutes and drained out the excess liquid, then I added the stuffing and cooked it for 15 minutes. It worked out well.

i love this recipe. i have used regular mushroom and made for dinner party. I have had to give this out to other people great when trying to keep expenses down. four forks.......

My mushrooms deflated in the oven! Any suggestions on how to prevent this in the future?

This was simple to make. It was substantial as an entree (with other sides), despite being meatless. I will definitely make it again.

Wow, what a great recipe!! I wasn't sure what Japanese eggplants looked like (in terms of size), so I just bought a decent-sized "regular" eggplant instead. Wow, this was fantastic!! I paired this up with the Six Hour Pork Roast and the flavors were fantastic!

I won back my girlfriend with this recipe. I made a few substitutions, using a mixture of mascarpone and gorogonzola cheeses instead of the suggested straight gorgonzola, and I also stuffed half of the portobellos with an impromptu mixture made from caramelized red onions, fresh thyme, roasted red bell peppers and soft, unripened goat's cheese with crushed peppercorns. I topped all of the baked mushrooms with a rosemary aioli and served with a Cabernet Sauvignon. We're still together, but I may need to be making this on a weekly basis.

Made this with large white button mushrooms and it was still extremely tasty. Substituted stilton for the gorgonzola--which was good but unexpectedly mild. For best results, it needs the strong flavor of gorgonzola.

I used a regular eggplant instead of japanese, I doubled the garlic, and I used 8oz gorgonzola instead of 6...very yummy. next time, i might add onions. very easy recipe, I will definitely make it again.

This is an outstanding recipe! I followed the instructions as directed, and everything came out perfect. As far as the sogginess issue that some reviewers complain about, I think if you make sure that the liquids in the sauteed stuffing have evaporated, and the stuffing is just moist, it should not come out soggy. I am losing weight on a low carbohydrate diet, and this dish makes a really excellent entree. I would make this even if I wasn't dieting. I strongly recommend this recipe!

absolutely delicious! this has received rave reviews from everyone I have served it to. Great as an entree or appetizer. Even enjoyed by those not liking gorgonzolla. Really good!

OK, fellow Weight Watchers, there are some good ideas in here for you, too. You can get these down to one point apiece if you make the following changes: Instead of olive oil, sautee the stuffing in Olive Oil Pam. (And add the wine a little at a time while doing so, to help it along.) Instead of Gorgonzola, I used 4 oz of 2% cottage cheese. Go ahead and use the Parmesan, but only one oz which is 1/8 cup. It'll still taste great! Use reconstituted dried sun dried tomatoes instead of oil packed. Next time I'll add a couple (like, five) of chopped olives in here. Dee-lish!

Maybe I am too picky (I am a caterer) but I thought this was good but I would not make it again. A little too bland for my taste. I thiink if I made it again I would add chorizo or something to spice it up a bit. All my girlfriends liked it. It was just not "Oh my god, this is so good"

Rating: 4
Delicious! My favorite stuffed mushroom recipe so far! I amazingly forgot the red wine and it still turned out wonderfully! I also made fresh croutons and threw them on a side salad to accompany the portobello. WOW!! I'm a big fan of gorgonzola and garlic, so I added a little extra of each. :)

WOW! Everyone loved this appetizer at our New Year's Eve party. It is such a refreshing change from your typical stuffed mushroom. I used just regular stuffing mushrooms instead of portabellos and the taste was just great. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
Everyone at our dinner party this evening loved the recipe. Even one person who doesn't care for mushrooms liked it. I used one regular eggplant since Japanese eggplant was not available, and I used Romano cheese instead of parmesan. I served two main dishes: salmon and the mushrooms. One guest commented that he thought the mushrooms were so delicious that he would have been just as happy if I had only served the mushrooms!

This is the most requested recipe that I've made from Epicurious. Bon Appetit!

Oh My God this was fantastic!! And Easy! I accidentally doubled the filling and I think that is a must because they were perfect! Dinner conversation ceased and everyone simply made yummy noises while they ate. It may sound strange but it was also great with the mushrooms chopped and added to the saute then served as a sandwich.

This was a great and easy recipe, although I did make some alterations. Instead of Gorgonzola I used Feta and since portobello mushrooms and Japanese eggplant weren't available we simply used regular mushrooms and regular eggplabt and it was a hit. Everyone loved them, even kids who usually only eat junk food loved them, and I'm not exaggerating. I'll definetively do this again!

While these were enjoyable, I didn't feel that they were worth the time and effort. The gorgonzola was a bit too overpowering in the dish (and I adore blue cheeses) and the garlic didn't come through enough - maybe add shallot next time? To avoid the sogginess issue I removed the gills on the mushrooms and baked them on racks on the baking sheet - it may have helped somewhat but they still were moister than I would have liked. Because they were intended for a large party we had, I cut each mushroom into quarters which wasn't the best idea, they simply are too limp. It would have been better to use crimini mushrooms in that case.

I made this as one of my dishes for company, there were vegetarians in the group,and it was fabulous. I have since made again and definitely recommend this recipe.

It looked interesting, and even though I'm not a bit eggplant fan, I gave it a try. Although I was disappointed in how it looked when it came out of the oven, I have to tell you that ALL of my guests and I thought it was wonderful! I will definately make this again and again.

I brought this to a wine tasting party, where the hostess is vegetarian. It was a hit with both vegetarians and carnivores! In fact, one of my friends (who takes great pride in his cooking) grabbed me and growled, "Drat! YOU got to grab all the glory!" Next time I will add onions, as well.

Rating: 3
Very nice, and very rich. Everybody loved them, even my non-vegetarian roommate. Follow all directions below, because they do get a little soggy and the extra onion and/or garlic was a nice addition. Don't go too overboard on extra cheese, though, because they are pretty rich.

Used fresh tomatoes, japanese eggplant, and basil from my garden, handful of red onion, feta, and a few sun-dried tomatoes. Stuffed the mushrooms as described, sprinkled with asiago cheese, cooked in dish, covered with aluminum foil. Tasted like heaven !!!

This was an unexpected hit at our house. My husband has professed many times how he hates eggplant. Well, I made this as an appetizer one evening and refused to tell him what was in it until he tried it. Well, he LOVED it even after I told him about the eggplant. We serve this as a side dish when we are making filet mignon. It is a perfect and elegant compliment to the strong tast of the steak.

I think the ingredient mix in this recipe is fantastic. However, I don't agree with the cooking instructions. Mine came out totally soggy and unappetizing. Next time, I will start by oiling and then grilling or broiling the mushroom tops, briefly. Then I will make the filling, being sure that it is as dry as is reasonably possible before adding the cheese. After filling, I'd sprinkle a little parmesean cheese on top so that there is something there to really brown. At that point, since everything is already "cooked," I'd pop them under a hot broiler for a few minutes to melt and brown everthing. But 25 minutes in the oven? No way.

Good but I don't think I used enough gorgonzola. I will make it again but make sure I have more cheese on hand and increase the amount of pepper I used. As for feta, I can't imagine making this with it.

This recipe rocks, a fine, rich vegetarian entree to be served with pasta or oven-roasted red potatoes. I used a peeled medium-sized eggplant, 8 oz of Gorgonzola, 3 cloves of garlic, and a handful of extra fresh basil, and it was superb. My girlfriend gave me extra kisses for this one.

This is a fabulous recipe that will impress those who enjoy rich food and a must try at your next gourmet group. I used baby portobellos so they don't look so massive and prepared them that morning which gave more time for the flavors to blend. A real keeper!

Sorry guys, this just didn't work. HOWEVER, I didn't have gorgonzola so I substituted with basil sun-dried tomato feta cheese. I thought that would work nicely since both basil and sun-dried tomatoes were in the recipe. Oh, it was "okay", but I won't make again, even WITH the gorgonzola. My boyfriend claims he doesn't like eggplant, so this was an experiement to see if I could get him to like it. It failed!

This is the most unbelievable tasting dish. My fiance raved for days about it. Not only that, but it was so very easy to make. I threw in 4oz of cheese instead of three and I used a regular medium sized egglant.

I served this dish for the first time to my parents and roommate in the backyard on a hot summer night. None of them have stopped talking about it since (6 months ago!!). With all the primitive sounding mmmms and oohhs I can't imagine what the neighbours must have thought was going on in the backyard. Absolutely Phenomenal.

A big hit at our house. Yes, they are incredibly rich but they make a magnificent meal paired with a simple green salad and a good slice of bread. Because if the richness, one mushroom is definitely enough, but I've made them three times this month! Delicious!

The taste was too strong for my taste.I liked the idea of stuffing the mushrooms with eggplant but didn't like the combo of sundried tomatoes with that strong cheese.

Slight variations: Added 2 tablespoons of minced onion to the filling and after removing the alumimum foil, we placed a thin slice of low fat mozzarella cheese on top of each. Placed back under broiler until cheese browned. Everyone loved this including several people who dislike eggplant. They couldn't believe how good it was! Easy to make and a guaranteed hit at your next party.

I made this with baby portabellos. Smelled wonderful while cooking. Was VERY RICH. I would use a different cheese for a THanksgiving dish. Perhaps that would cut down on the richness. Mine seemed to have too much oil. I followed the recipe. I like the concept and would rework the recipe to my taste. I will not make this recipe as writeen again.

Sorry folks, I made this as written, and I was sure I was going to love it as I like every thing in it, but my mushrooms caps seemed soggy despite longer baking time. I thought the filling was excellent though, and I might try it again but first sauteing the mushroom caps to get rid of the excess moisture. I should add that I used really large portobello caps, perhaps smaller ones would have worked better...
