I halved the recipe and didn't use enough butter in the topping. With that mistake fully disclosed, I didn't think much of this at all. Edible, but in no way special. Won't make again.

I like this crisp, the topping is yummy. I usually make more as I like lots of topping.

I thought this was very good. I Substituted with splenda brown sugar and couldn't notice a difference, if you are concerned about calories!

This recipe is just... eh. For the time commitment there are many others that produce much better results.

Before making this wonderful apple crisp, make sure to have icecream in your freezer! Nice lemon touch of apple filling. I added some chopped walnuts to the topping. First I had a dobt in using an egg yolk for the topping, but that turned out to be very good. Thanks for the recipe!

I am a student in High School but loves to try baking new things. I made this and it turned out delicious! It is one of the most fabulous recipes I have. If you have a family that likes Apples or things crunchy or even just a new taste experiment, use this recipe! I will never take it out of my recipe book.

The lemon was an interesting touch. There are so many better dessert recipes that I wouln't make this again. Too much work and not worth the calories.
