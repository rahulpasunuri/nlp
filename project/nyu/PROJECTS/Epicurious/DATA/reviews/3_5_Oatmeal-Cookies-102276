After seeing so many fine reviews on this recipe I decided to try it. The cookies were absolutely fantastic. I did tweak it a little but nothing major. I also added dried cranberries and orange zest.

This is just the recipe I was looking for: simple, easy, and amenable to many additions. Because of allergies, I used maple sugar and kamut and amaranth flours. I added walnuts and raisins, and baked them 12 minutes. The result was a tender cookie with a delicate, crunchy shell and outstanding flavor. So pleased!

Rating: 3
I made this recipe exactly as written, and it turned out 25 delicious cookies. Baking for 12 minutes produces a dark golden crunchy cookie, so I baked for 10 minutes for soft bite instead. It's a simple recipe that will lend itself to many substitutions and additions. Next time I will use less salt and add nuts per my family's tastes. This is a keeper!

These were great, I replaced part of the flour with whole wheat flour, next time I'll try using only wheat flour, they were great. I added chocolate chips - tasty! My healthy husband loved them.

Oh Man, I added some dark chocolate chips to these, they hand the perfect mix of crunch around the outside edge and chewiness in the middle. They perfectly satisfied my chocolate craving!

I can't say enough about this recipe. Chewy, soft and flavorful these cookies are excellent! Maybe one of the best recipes for oatmeal cookies out there. I used 1/2 cup light brown sugar and substituted oat flour for the all purpose. I imagine they would be fabulous with nuts and raisins or chocolate chips or both!

These are very light. I baked them for the full 12 min. which gave them a nice caramelized flavor and they were still soft. I used Florida Crystals natural sugar instead of white sugar and organic brown sugar (Trader Joe's) and added choc. chips, dried cranberries and dried cherries. Yum!

Quick, easy, tasty. I greased my cookie sheets w/ unsalted butter and sprinkled with flour. The cookies didn't spread out too thin in the oven and they came right off the pan once cooled. Cooking time was 8 minutes for the dark cookie sheet, about 10 minutes for a lighter cookie sheet. Great consistency. Mine didn't turn out crispy, like other reviewers mentioned.

Yummy cookies! Super easy to make. Definitely, do not cook longer than 8 minutes, unless you like them crunchy. Looking forward to making them with dried cherries...and chocolate chips, maybe.

These cookies were great! And so easy. I made several variation - with raisins, with chocolate chips, with flaked coconut and dates and chopped walnuts - any combination of these works! And if you want soft, chewy cookies, under-cook them - bake for 8 mins or so instead of 12 mins. Enjoy!

Rating: 3
this is a good basic recipe - the perfect combination of crispy and chewy. I did update it with a few handfuls of chopped walnuts and dark chocolate chips stirred in just before baking.I also doubled the cinnamon just for the heck of it. Wow and wow. I'm embarrassed to say that I ate almost an entire dozen of them by myself.

The cookies were good...but I probably won't use this recipe again. I prefer a thicker, chewier oatmeal cookie...these were tasty, but rather thin and crisp.

Rating: 3
These made for a pleasant oatmeal cookie. I followed the recipe as is, folding in about 1/2 cup chocolate chips at the very end. While they were delicious, there was nothing extraordinary about them, nothing too memorable. I baked them a little less than called for, to ensure the insides were chewy and the outsides on the crisper side. I'm looking forward to trying the "seven spice" oatmeal cookies on epicurious next.

This is a perfectly crisp traditional oatmeal cookie. Be sure to flatten cookie dough before putting into the oven. I added 3/4 C raisins and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg because I like the flavor of these ingredients. I also baked using convection heat and repeatedly my results have been crispy without being dry, and slightly chewy in the middle. Once I used more brown sugar and less white and the results were too sweet. Following the recipe I get great results.

Yum! I added some nutmeg and allspice as well as some dates, and used whole wheat flour. I think it would be a little boring without those or at least some nuts or chocolate chips...

These cookies are delicious with a few changes. I use dark brown sugar instead of light, it gives the cookie a richer flavor. Also I use a heaped teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 tsp of vanilla. I add semi-sweet chocolate chips as well, but they are great on their own as well. I only bake my cookies for about 7 minutes, that way they are nice and soft and chewy when they cool.

I loved these oatmeal cookies probably because I love crispy styled cookies. I've done this recipe a couple of different ways. I'm not a walnut fan so I've often tossed in pecans or chopped macadamia nuts. As well I've used dried cherries instead of raisins or cranberries and they are exquisite. I've lightened up the cinnamon slightly and added lots of nutmeg. You can really glam these cookies up with chunks of white chocolate as well. I often give them as gifts and people love them. I'm going to use this recipe to make those giant valentine heart cookies, it is so easy to handle.

My 3.5-year-old, explaining why he was grabbing for more than the three cookies I let him have: "But they were so very delicious, I couldn't stop eating them." Based on other reviews, I increased the vanilla to 1 tsp, added 1/4 tsp allspice, added 3/4 cup of Craisins and baked them on 350 for 10 minutes. I did move the cookie sheets as specified in the recipe. They went fast and were so easy -- I'll definitely make them again.

A great recipe. I followed some review suggestions and added 1/2 t. of black pepper, 1/4 t. nutmeg and then a little bit of ground cloves to give it some extra spice. Also, I cut the butter down to 3/4 stick and used 1/2 stick of margarine to make them softer as my wife is not a big fan of crispy cookies. In the future, I will do what I normally do with spices - add them to the egg, sugar, butter mixture. I think they distribute much better that way and make for a better balanced cookie. Oh, also added 1/2 c. raisins and 1/2 c. craisins. Very good, my new favorite oatmeal cookie recipe.

I returned to this recipe after a few years, the results were fantastic. I doubled the recipe, and used spelt and what flours instead of white. I took suggestions and added allspice, nutmeg and ground ginger, which made the cookies wonderfully fragrant. I split my batch and added raisins and walnuts to one and lots of chocolate chips to the other - the oatmeal chocolate chip, with all of the spices, were my favorite. great recipe!

Rating: 4
Very delicious. I made a few modifications to make them healthier: I used whole grain flour, used only half of the rolled oats and the rest was a seven-grain cereal, only used half the butter and sub'ed veg. oil for the rest. The texture came out great; chewy but with a crunchy outside. Also, don't skimp on the sugar, I had to put a little cinnamon sugar on the top to up the sweetness. Everyone loved them, and definitely plan to make them again.

I have been searching for a long time for a good oatmeal cookie recipe. Most I've tried are either too runny, or too bland. This one was fantastic.

A good, well rounded, oatmeal cookie. Nothing really jumps out at you, but these are still keepers. I went and sprinkled them with a bit of turbinado sugar before I put them in the oven, just to give them that little something.

Rating: 4
I made the following modifications to make the cookie a bit healthier: Substituted about 2/3 of the butter with apple sauce and decreased the sugars to 1/4 cup each. I also added about half an ounce of chopped candied ginger to give it an extra dimension. Because of the butter/apple sauce substitution, the cookies rose a bit higher than expected and were a bit cakey. However, on the next day they were delightfully crunchy and you could not even tell that they were good for you. Next time, though, i'll flatten them even more, to get some of that crunch immediately.

A good, solid oatmeal cookie recipe. I used the recipe 'as is' in terms of core ingredients, and liked the texture (substantial, moist, not too greasy). I added chocolate chips and raisins to part of the batch, and although sweet, wasn't TOO sweet. Next time I add sweet extras like chips or fruit, I will go light - the core recipe has plenty of sweetness.

I tried the ginger and nutmeg version as suggested by one reviewer and they were delicious! I took half of the batch and half dipped them in dark chocolate. Definitely a cookie I will make again. However they were also a little too "grow-up" tasting as stated by my daughter. So, for my second batch I only used brown sugar but cut the measurment down to 1/2 cup and added 1 medium apple (1/2 chopped & 1/2 grated and squeezed dry). I also upped the cinnamon to a full teaspoon. My kids loved them and my house smelled amazing while they were baking! If you have a gas oven (as I do) I suggest baking them at 350 for 11 minutes, that kept mine nice and chewy. Anything longer and mine would have been too crisp. I'm not sure about quantity as some reviewers have stated this recipe did not make 2 dozen. I was able to make 22 cookies each batch and probably could have made 24 but I opted for a few larger.

This is a great base oatmeal cookie that will now replace the Quaker Oat's Vanishing Oatmeal Cookie. Using only 1 stick of butter (and quick-cooking oats instead of old-fashioned), the cookies are less greasy, softer, and hold together better than Quaker's cookies. It's definitely a 4-fork recipe because I'm still on my hunt for the perfectly chewy oatmeal cookie that is infused with spices and screams "Deli-Style!" However, these are great heartily thick (I thought they'd spread, so I didn't push the dough down enough) cookies - like portable oatmeal!

A standard oatmeal raisin cookie base that will now replace my Quaker Oats Vanishing Oatmeal Cookie recipe. Using only one bar of butter and quick-cooking oats instead of old-fashioned (I ran out!), this recipe is a lot less greasy, soft and slightly chewy, and holds together. It's not my ideal chewy oatmeal cookie, but it is a heartily thick one (I didn't press them down much because I thought they would spread - which they didn't). It's great - like instant portable oatmeal.

These are simple, yet wonderful. My husband doesn't normally like oatmeal cookies, but describes these as orgasmic! I substitute white whole wheat flour (King Arthur brand) for 1/2 a cup of the all purpose flour, and you'd never, ever guess it. If my kids have to eat cookies, I'm glad they like these!! So far I have not been tempted to add choc chips, raisins, nuts etc. because these cookies just don't need anything! Makes a small batch, though. Do flatten the cookies a bit before baking for best taste and texture.

Very tasty, delicious and easy to make. I took the advice of another cook and added black pepper. Wonderful addition. My son loved them.

Rating: 4
As another reviewer suggested, I only used a stick and added a heaping tablespoon of apple butter. In addition, I added allspice, and a teaspoon of ground black pepper (I am serious). The black pepper made the cookies more interesting. One thing that might accompany them very well is aztec chili vanilla ice cream. Another variation would be to use a little chili powder (1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon). Also, the cup of yellow raisins made the cookie. By itself the recipe is good, with the additions it makes the cookie wonderful. Another thought that would be absolutely wonderful is the cookie with vanilla ice cream or gelato and a shot of hot espresso poured over it. YUM!

These are wonderful oatmeal cookies -- simple and light. The taste of the butter, vanilla and cinnamon shine through, and there are enough oats, but not so many that the cookie isheavy. Perfect for when you want something simple. I can't imagine any plain oatmeal cookie being a dish beyond compare, but these are just right -- satisfying, comforting, and not over the top.

I've made these cookies twice, and I don't bother with the mixer - I cream the butter and sugar with a wire whisk, and this works just fine. I add raisins and increase the white and brown sugar to nearly 1/2 cup each based on comments of earlier reviewers. I found that they worked better at 350 for about 9 minutes (I make them on the smallish size). They're much better the next day, and keep really well for about a week in an airtight container. Great basic oatmeal cookie - I also like that the recipe makes a manageable quantity for a small household. Try them! They are quick, easy, reasonably healthy, and GOOD.

These cookies were fabulous. They are a really great basic oatmeal cookie, if you want to embelish them ( I think dried cherries and coconut would be really good or dried cranberries) they are a perfect base but are really good plain. I made these for friends and they were gone instantly. I followed the exact measurements but you should definitely make a double batch, a single batch made about 22 cookies. I found that I didn't need to cook them for all 12 minutes, they only needed about 10 and my oven tends to run a little slow so keep that in mind.

A good base. I made this when I lost my old favorite (from Sunset) and was searching for a new soft oatmeal cookie recipe. I followed the advice of others and refirgerated the batter for a few hours before baking. But because the batter seemed quite moist and buttery, I then added about another 3/4 cup of oats (and some dried cranberries and tart cherries). They turned out well - very hearty thanks to the extra oats!

The recipe was easy, and these were just as I expected them to be. Mine were overdone at 12 minutes--10 & 1/2 seemed just right.

This is the absolute best oatmeal cookie that I have ever tasted. I was never a big fan of oatmeal cookies, but this one is incredibly chewy and has kept me coming back for more every time. I've made this recipe many times, and even when I tripled the recipe they came out perfect. My only advice is to make more then one batch; each recipe makes only about 18-20 normal sized cookies. Also, I added about 3/4 cup of raisins per recipe, which make the cookie even better. I would definitely recommend making these cookies, they're the best!

I made these cookies, and they were excellent! My whole family enjoyed them. I doubled the recipe (because my dad doesn't like raisins) and made one without raisins and added raisins to the left over batter. These cookies were so yummy, I'm bound to make them again!

I have made this recipe many times and everyone loves the cookies. You must however like crispy delicate cookies. I have made several adjustments to improve the taste/texture. Also, be sure to press the cookies down prior to baking. Flour 1/2 cup Oats 2 cups Butter 1 1/3 sticks

I don't know if I didn't measure carefully enough, or if I should have stirred in the oats instead of beating them in, but these cookies came out very dry in the middle. They were soft, but not sufficiently chewy, and the flavor was nothing special. I would not make this recipe again--the crunchy oat cookies from epicurious.com are much better.

These were really, really good. I will absolutely make them again.

My family and I liked the taste, but not the consistency. I added currants which were quite good. I liked the ease of the recipe. I may try again to see if the cookies will hold together better.

I was hoping for a moist cookie, soft, slightly chewing. It just wasn't what I had hoped for. The problem might be with the sugar content. I think there's slightly to much, and if you're not careful, they'll caramalize around the edges. The temperature is definately too high. I had mine at just under 350 and they turned out a lot better. I put them in the center rack for half of the time and transferred them to the next highest rack for the remaining time, took them out about a minute sooner, and they were edible. I just think this is way to much trouble to go through for a cookie that I was just mildly pleased about at the end.

I found these cookies too dry and tasteless.

Excellent-tasting oatmeal cookie: not too crisp yet not too soft. I added 1/2 cup raisins to mine. Very easy to make too. The only thing I didn't like was that they went too fast and they don't make that many cookies per batch.

This recipie was the right proportions I needed since I don't want a big batch, the temperature 375 degrees is NOT too high for cookies depending on where you live, i.e. it worked well for me since I live 7000 feet above sea level therefore cookies must cook quick. A tip that helps me a lot when I am cooking at lower altitudes is: undercook the cookie, it is still hot so there will be a certain amount of cooking when it comes out, and the temperature itself will set it (works for me)...and don't forget to experiment all oven have different settings, I recommend baking 2 cookies at the time until you find what works best for you. Good luck!

Yummy! I agree with the reviewer from Canada that 375 is too high. I baked them at 350, switching the baking sheet around as directed. I made two batches, one with raisins, one without. Personally, I preferred the addition of raisins, but my raisin-hating friends thought the "plain" ones were yummy too. As to sticks of butter -- 1 1/4 sticks = 5 ounces = 10 Tablespoons = 5/8 cup. Hope that helps. (In other words, 1 stick of butter = 4 ounces = 1/2 cup)

This was an okay recipe. I had hoped for chewy cookies, and was disappointed by the dry-cookie end result. I cut the granulated sugar dosage in half, which worked well, making the cookies not so sweet. I think the oven temperature required is too high, as some of my cookies bottoms' burned. I find 375 degrees is too high for cookies. Also, being a Canadian, I had trouble with the measurement of "sticks" for butter. Put measurements in cups or milliliters, please. Viewer responses welcome.

Great cookies! I add pecan pieces and cinnamon coated raisins or craisins(dried cranberrys)..Both are a big hit!

Great cookies. I added about 4 oz of dark chocolate chips and used Scotch porridge oats instead of rolled oats.

I inadverdently left out the egg when I made this recipe; later, when I made them again, I followed the recipe more closely. I liked the egg-less cookies much better! They had a shortbread like consistency that was great. Dried cranberries were also a nice addition

didn't get 24 cookies, might try making them into a ball and flattening them next time.

Good recipe. I added 1 cup apple sauce. Then increased the flour by 1/4 cup and oatmeal by 1/4 cup. Used baking powder instead of baking soda. Tastes almost like apple crumb cake. Delicious.

I added baking raisins. The cookies were great.
