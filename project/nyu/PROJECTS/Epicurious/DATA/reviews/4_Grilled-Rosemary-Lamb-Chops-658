Scaled the recipe down to serve one, and found some amazing nearly 2- inch thick loin chops to work with for the recipe. Hadnt grilled lamb in a while, so followed the recipe, EXCEPT I grilled on a gas grill, and no wood chips (didnt miss a thing!) Chops spent 4 minutes covered on one side, then flip and cover and cook for additional 5 minutes. No poking, prodding, or other monkeying around with the meat allowed! After the 5 minute mark, gas was turned off and chops allowed to sit- covered, and rest ont he grill while I collected the sides for dinner. Highly recommend making the chops for summer (or winter entertaining or a special splurge dinner). Be sure to serve something with the meat that will absorb the outrageously delish jus - like a orzo salad with feta and veggies, or even some french bread. Great way to break into serving lamb for those who are unsure. It's a home run recipe!

This recipe is a hit! Packed with flavor, yet so simple. I scaled the recipe down to serve one, and did not use wood chips. Instead I used regular grill technique- 4 minutes one side, then flip and 5 minutes on the other.Do not poke or press, LEAVE THEM ALONE! Turned off the gas and let them sit covered on the grill for about 3-5 minutes while I collected the sides for my dinner ( i used loin chops that were over an inch thick). The chops were cooked perfectly, and the juices were so good, that I sopped them up with a piece of French bread. Perfect meal for summer (or winter) entertaining or special dinner splurge. This is a must-do if you like lamb, or are wanting to try making it!

This is a interesting variation on the usual grilled lamb chops. I found the marinade to be quite good and would suggest that it is the quality of the balsamic vinegar used makes the difference between great flavor and being drowned in balsamic flavor. It will not set the world on fire but is a quick tasty main course.

Just one word: yummy!

I realize the recipe calls for marinating only 4 hours, but because of a last minute issue with our grill, I had to marinate overnight. Based upon the other reviewers, I assumed it wouldn't be a problem. Well it was. The marinade completely overwhelmed the meat- I used a high quality balsamic and fresh rosemary and ended up throwing everything away. Do not overmarinate. I love balsamic vinegar, but 4-6 hours is plenty of time to marinate.

Rating: 4
Outstanding. I actually had a last minute change of plans and the lamb had to stay in the marinade overnight...I didn't use the wood chips, and I grilled the lamb chops all attached (8 ribs, about 1.5 lbs, served 2 people generously) and sliced after for presentation. I think it lets them get a better crust and stay med-rare in the middle better this way. They grilled 8-10 min per side (to 130') over VERY HIGH heat. I made a simple glaze of Trader Joes Pomegranite Syrup with enough sage honey stirred in to take away the tartness. I drizzled the plate with it before placing the chops on top (I sliced them into 2-bone sections, so I could stand them up, bones up, like a "tent" on the plate - very pretty). Served with rosemary and feta roasted red potatos and broccolini with a nice Syrah. Definitely worthy of company.

I've done chops this way twice, and they got oohs and aahs from all(including me!) I reduced the vineger to 1/2 cup,but only used 8 chops. I used a mortar and pestle to crush the rosmary and marinated for 6 hours. the were FANTASTIC! But I do love my own cooking.

Read no further! I've experimented with this recipe for years. Use less balsamic and add crushed garlic. All great lamb recipes call for garlic! Marinate for a few hours or up to two days. Use a real grill if possible, 3-4 min. per side. Allow to rest for 5 min, covered with foil. Serve with garlic mashed potatoes. Awesome!

A few changes... First, omit the balsamic vinegar. Second, use fresh rosemary. Put the next five ingredients plus 1 tsp salt (more depending on taste) in a grinder/mini processor/mortal&pestle and work until you have a paste. Rub the paste on to the chops. The chops will come out tasty whether or not you let it marinate so you can make this a last minute thing. It's a favorite in my house, very easy to throw together and guests always rave about it.

I like the taste of lamb and also enjoy balsamic vinegar, but they mated rather badly in this recipe, in my opinion. Essentially, the lamb lost its distinctive flavor, becoming something altogether too tame and mild. It's probably a good way to disguise the taste of lamb for those who don't particularly enjoy it, but considering the price of loin lamb chops, why bother?

I have prepared 3 times and enjoyed each time. My daughter does not like vinegar and claimed to be able to taste it. I used with lamb tenderloin once (rack of lamb chops) and marinate was a bit too strong. Advice, great but do not over marinate. Served with rosemary mashed potatoes and asparagus and it was delightful.

We loved this recipe and are making it again this week. When I made it I used bottled lemon juice (too lazy to squeeze fresh!) and only marinated 2 hours. It was still great! Definitely, though, watch the grill for flare-ups. 4 minutes/side was perfect.

We decided to try this recipe at the last minute. We'd been unsuccessful in finding an enticing recipe for lamb shops for our Easter dinner. This recipe appeared to be the best of the lot. We did have reservations about the balsamic vinegar being a dominating factor. Perish the thought. It was exquisite. Rather than overpowering the lamb, the vinegar actually complemented the unique flavor of the lamb. We grilled the lamb over medium-to-high heat for precisely 7 minutes per side. We kept the grill covered and basted the lamb with the marinade three times per side. We served the chops with a homemade twice-baked potato, steamed asparagus, and lightly-toasted garlic-parmesan italian bread. We served this with a medium-bodied (slightly on the dry side) merlot. Can't wait to do this again...

Wonderful recipe. Made this in the oven and it was still excellent. The tartness of the balsamic vinegar really cuts through the richness of the lamb. All the seasoning complemented each other and did not overwhelme the lamb. Will definitely make it again.

My husband and I felt these were the BEST lamb chops we've grilled!!! I took them out 1 hr. before grilling so not too chilled. I marinated the chops for 4 hrs. only. The flavor was just right. We grilled them for 5 mins. a side as we don't like our lamb too rare. They were so tender and full of flavor. We highly recommend this recipe and will do it for company soon!!! A winner!!

I used fresh Australian baby "lolly-pop" chops in this recipe and served it twice...once for over 50 people at our company Christmas party...they still talk about it.

Wow.....This was unbelievable. My wife and I are normally eat light and try to keep our portions under control. We ate two pounds of these lamb chops because they were just fantastic. The critical part from our perspective is to marinate them long enough (we did ours for 6 hours) and only cook them for about 8 minutes. This is one of our new favorites. This is easy and delicious/.
