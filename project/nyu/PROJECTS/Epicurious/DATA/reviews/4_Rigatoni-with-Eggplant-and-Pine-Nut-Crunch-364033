I loved this. I am alone and made it for myself for leftovers. I added some ground venison. I never thought to make pesto as a "crunch" but will from now on!

Totaly loved this recipe. Im going to make it for my Brother-in-law and his family tomorrow. Just to prove that vegataran can be tasty & satisfying. Along with a side of Chicken meatballs in marinara. This recipe is a real keeper. Glad I was able to find it again on Epicurious.

Wonderful, rich, and hearty vegetarian entree. This has become one of my go-to pasta dishes. Often get lazy/cheap and substitute store-bought pesto for the fresh basil leaves. Still turns out great. Will make this dish again and again and again...

Loved it. i used all the mozzarella and did not think it was too much. i used canned crushed tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes ( didnt have to use the food processor). Other than that.. i thought the veggies kind of disappeared. You could taste the eggplant but the yellow peppers and grape tomatoes kind of "melted" i would cut the yellow pepper larger next time. the eggplant held its own. I used pine nuts and walnuts in the pesto..extra crunch..

I just want to add a couple of things - I personally love all of the fresh mozzarella! I would leave it just as is. The top was the best part!

I really liked this recipe. I followed it completely except for using orange peppers instead of yellow which wouldn't make a difference. I thought like other reviewers mentioned, it could use more vegetables if desired but not necessary. I thought it was great. Super easy and great for entertaining. (The top is definitely the yummiest part!

This dish was fine, but with all of the work/time and the fat calories, it did not really seem worth it. Instead, both the grilled eggplant parmigiana or the eggplant caprese on this site are easier to make and lower fat using similar ingredients.

finally got around to trying this and I can't say it was worth all the different steps. It was good but took a while. If I was to make it again I would roast the veggies and do the topping way ahead of time. I think you could cut the heavy cream in half too.

I would suggest, as other users have, using less mozzarella. Also, more pine nuts. Next time I make it, I'll skip making the sauce and just use prepared sauce. All things considered it's a great dish.

Made this for a dinner party and it was excellent. I also made it all ahead of time and let it sit until I was ready to put it in the oven so it was a lovely dish for a large party. Like other reviewers, I chopped the veggies a little larger, used less oil and added some chili pepper flakes for a little kick. Yummy!

I loved the flavors and textures in this recipe but I agree with some other reviewers that a whole pound of mozzarella was a bit much. Also the little bits of eggplant sort of got lost amidst all the pasta and cheese. If I make it again I will probably double the total amount of veggies as well as cut them into slightly larger chunks. A great way to get people who won't ordinarily eat eggplant to eat eggplant!

This recipe is great as is... please don't use the substitutions if you can help it because the crunch from the pine nut topping is lovely. I found there was plenty of sauce and as long as you're tossing the vegetables as they roast, you won't overcook them. I used a little more garlic on the roasted veggies and found that a whole lb. of mozzarella was a little much, but other than that, it was perfection! :)

I hate to be the one who reports that this recipe was not that great. I made it as it was written, and found that the vegetables cut in 1/2 inch squares were too small to withstand the roasting--they were overcooked. The final product did not have enough sauce. Heated up leftovers were served with additional spaghetti sauce which was an improvement.

Truly an excellent recipe. Will be making it again for sure!

So good!!! My weeknight shortcuts: I used store-bought pesto (no crunch this way, but same flavor) and store- bought pasta sauce (I used a spicy tomato and basil), added garlic powder and the recommended cream to the sauce, which I heated on the stovetop to blend the flavors prior to adding to the cooked pasta. Oh, and I used an Italian blend shredded cheese instead of cubed mozzarella (certain this cut down on the bake time and resolved the stringy mess issue other reviewers mentioned). I roasted my veggies for 30 min. and baked the final product for 20 min&..and it was good to go!! Husband loved it and he's a "where's the meat?" kinda guy. With these shortcuts its totally doable on a weeknight!!

I loved this vegetarian dish and I'm not a vegetarian. I have to admit, I took a shortcut with the pine nut crunch, I used my fresh frozen pesto from last summer in the sauce and on top, so it probably would have had more "crunch" to the top, but it did save a prep step. The sauce tasted sort of like a vodka sauce and was what made this dish along with the roasted vegetables. Just the right amount of every ingredient. This dish reheated well and actually made better leftovers after several days! Great!

So good. My man and I loved all the vegetables in this dish. And there was enough cheese and cream and tomato sauce to give it a warm comfort food flavor. I appreciated that all the ingredients are things I can find at my local grocers and farmers' market.

Made this for company last night with substitutions: for roasted veggies, I used zucchini, red bell peppers, an onion, and several garlic cloves, and only enough oil to keep them from sticking (probably 2-3T). (Eggplant was not available but would have been good, as would mushrooms and various other veggies; it's the roasting that really adds a lot of flavor.) Used half-and-half instead of cream, and part skim mozzarella (about half-pound). Added quite a bit more garlic to the tomato cream sauce and topping, and more salt and pepper at various steps, per reviewer suggestions. It was really delicious and still plenty rich, definitely special enough to serve to guests. The mozzarella made it pretty gooey and stringy, which wasn't the most elegant look; next time I might try adding a bit of feta and using even less mozzarella. Too much work for an everyday meal, but worth the effort.

Big hit for both myself (a vegetarian) and my carnivorous husband. He said he didn't miss his meat! I made this just as the recipe indicated - with a few exceptions: more garlic. The vegetables probably would have been roasted better (they were a little mushy) if there wasn't as much oil. Perhaps 3 T instead of 1/3 cup. Great meal!

This was sinfully delicious! I was worried that the cream would dilute the flavor of the sauce too much, but it didn't. It might be too dry with less, so I'll try half and half. I did add extra garlic - almost always do - and used red peppers, what I had. Will make this for company, or a potluck, with full amount of mozzarella, but for us I will try it with half the amount. But sooo yummy! The pine not crunch made it!

So I forced myself out of my baked pasta comfort zone and made this to rave reviews. If you like pesto than you'll like this. Forgot about the tomatoes but they weren't missed. Did not skimp on the mozzarella and it was ooey-gooey good! I'd make this as a dish for company.

Made this as written with one exception... there is no eggplant to be found at the market at the moment! So I substituted butternut squash, and it was delicious. (Agree that any other combo of veggies would also be good!) Might try tweaking it as other reviewers suggested to lighten it a bit, but as I loved how rich & indulgent it was, I don't think I'll pull back too much.

First I have to admit that I made a few health conscious substitutions, which may have contributed to my *almost* perfect review (fat free half and half for the heavy cream, reduced olive oil to quarter cup, and part skim mozzarella, halved amount). However, I have to say while I really enjoyed this recipe, I felt it was a little lacking in the flavor department. I will definitely make again as I think it's hearty, delicious and well worth the effort, but I will be careful to add even more garlic, which I already upped this round, and will be very generous with my salt and pepper in each portion of the recipe. Similar to other reviewers I think I will also try adding onion to enhance the flavor profile. All and all, a definite keeper and sure to be a crowd pleaser.

Fantastic! I made this recipe 2x over 4 days. The first time I made it according to the recipe (with additional garlic), but it needed more salt. The second time I added more salt in the sauce and on the vegetables. I reduced the amount of oil to roast the vegetable (3 tablespoons instead of 1/3 cup), tripled the garlic and added some red pepper flakes ....It was amazing. All my guests were raving and asking for the recipe. This will be something we make again and again. It is so easy too!

Will definitely make this again! This is easy to prepare if you have a food processor/blender and the results are very tasty. I agree with reviewer who felt that 1lb mozzarella seemed a lot and I also only used 1/2 lb.

A great dish and a nice change from lasagna. Agree with others that 1. you can use less cream and 2. more garlic. I also thought a entire pound of whole-milk mozzarella on top was way too much. 1/2 pould would be sufficient. Could also substitute many other types of veggies (zucchini, butternut squash, asparagus) and whole wheat pasta. Looking forward to playing with this one. Full review on my site katecooksthebooks.com.

Made this last night and it was excellent. I used only 3/4 of the cream and would even consider using less. Like other reviewers, I also used more garlic but otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I wondered if the finished dish would have too strong a pesto taste, but it was perfect. Yum!

A pleasant vegetarian dish. I loved the roasted vegetables. I also added red pepper flakes ( I like my pasta with a little kick). I cooked,chopped, & squeezed out the liquid on some baby spinach & added that as well.

WOW. Made it on weekend. Did increase garlic, use a mix of red, green, and yellow peppers (that is what I had), and added some onions to the roasted vegetables.Was a bit of work (took longer than 2 hrs from start to finish), but well worth it. Hearty, Tasty, with a great mix of flavors and textures. Will definitely make again

Just made this dish tonight. It was relatively easy to put together, and was delicious. I used less heavy cream than called for and I didn't miss it. I also used a whole 12oz carton of grape tomatoes (this added some liquid). We will definitely make this again soon-- my husband went back for 3rds.

This was a terrific comforting dish. Could definitely use more garlic in the sauce. Would also add some onions to the roasted veggies. Maybe some red pepper flakes as well. The basil topping was excellent. Will make again - son asked for some crumbled sausage to be added. Would be a great addition for a non-veggie option.
