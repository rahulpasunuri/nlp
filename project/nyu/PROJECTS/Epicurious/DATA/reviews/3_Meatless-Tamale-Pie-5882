Not very exciting. More like Polenta with veggies rather than the classic Tamale Pie made with Masa. Probably wont make it again.

I would have to say that for this recipe, the whole does not equal the sum of its parts. It seemed it would all come together delicioiously, but whereas it looked great, it was almost torture to finish eating the whole dish. It was a lot of work for not much payback. Can you guess? I would not make this again

I now know what it is like to peel a tree. If I am ever crazy enough to make this, I will do two things differently: 1) Bake squash, cut in half face down in 1/4 inch of water and scoop out of shell. 2) Remove seeds of poblanos before roasting. I started at 3:00 pm and it was out of the oven at exactly 7:03 pm. Four hours of my life that I want back. Everybody loved it. But, the time involved....Well, you know. I agree with the reviewer who said to roast the squash. I did this instead of boiling it. I only roasted it for about an hour. They were not super soft. But, they do finish cooking in the finished mix.

I made this for Christmas since we weren't going to have traditional tamales. Plus, this dish gave me (the sole vegetarian) something substantial to eat. It was a great success overall, although I have to agree with others that it was quite a bit of work. Next time, I might cut down on some of the ingredients. I made a few changes: - Used a mix of frozen edamame and corn instead of just corn because I saw a bag of it at Trader Joe's. - Added a can of black beans to the pepper mixture. - Used canned tomatoes in adobo sauce. - Used chipoltes in adobo instead of jalapenos. With this, the pepper mixtures came out spicy--but with the rest of the ingredients is mellowed out that spice.

This dish is absolutely wonderful! Very hardy and tasty. I didn't use the butternut squash; instead, I added one can of black beans (make sure to drain thoroughly), slightly mashed to the layers. Served over a bed of wilted spinach.

Suggestion vs. review: consult other tamale pie recipes such as one in James Beard's American Cookery. Then improvise to keep dish vegetarian. For example, I was struck by photograph of pinto-sweet potato tamales on Seattle Bon Vivant, a food blog (7/2005). To simplify undertaking, made a pie instead, filling layers with home-cooked pinto beans, roasted sweet potatoes mashed over beans with onions sauteed with a few spices and Ancho chili puree. Add corn to upper crust. Cheese inside and on top. Basically a cousin of Italian stuffed polenta.

To the cook who asked for an easy way to peel squash: Many of the newer vegetable peelers do a good job peeling winter squash. Try an Oxo, or one of the better harp-style peelers. You can also use a thin blade - boning or filleting knife. First cut the ends of the squash with a chefs knife or cleaver, stand on end, then use the thin blade knife to peel strips o skin off vertically down to the workboard. Third trick: cook the squash at least half-way, then scoop the flesh out rather than peel. For this recipe you may want to try peeling the squash, cutting it in half lengthwise, slicing crosswise, and panfrying the slices until golden. This will reduce the water and firm up the squash, as well as add a roasty flavor!

This recipe was first given to me by a friend of the family's, who after I told her how much I loved the dinner she cooked, handed me the torn out recipe, and said, "Good! I'll never go through the trouble again, but I'm glad you liked it!" It does take a long time, but it does feed around 12 people (or good for left-overs). I STRONGLY suggest replacing yogurt with sour cream and replacing squash with thick slices of half-boiled potatoes. The poblano chiles really make it just spicy enough, so try to find them instead of substituting them with something else. Rave reviews from friends, even from meat-lovers. Also great as a "casserole" type dish to give to new parents, etc.

yucky. If you're a veggie, Anna Thomas has a great recipe for Tamale Pie in her New Vegatarian Epicure....made with masa harina it is a much better bet.

I tried this recipe in part because the reviews seemed to swing violently in one direction or another. My verdict? Absolutely average. The sweetness of the squash was interesting, but there was no mouth feel (or, more accurately, what mouth feel there was was decidedly mushy). The Mexican Pizza recipe on Epicurious has the same flavors and is a much better dish.

This is was fabulous. The prep was kind of tedious (anyone have a tip on how to peel the squash easily?) but the taste and smell of it was wonderful. The dish also came out of the oven looking like a dream. I had no problems with the layering required for the dish. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious vegetarian dish.

A great vegetarian dish. Hearty, wonderful flavors. Really serves 12 people. To cut prep time, use Ortega whole green chilies. I added some black olives.

I added sauteed ground turkey flavored with beef bouillon to the recipe and the results were very good. I served it at a party and everyone liked it a lot. The surprise element for many was the butternut squash. The recipe is a wonderful combination of interesting and taste-provoking flavors. I am going to make it again, and soon.

Very good, although the careful layering didn't seem to be reflected in the final product - a delicious pile of mush! I didn't have access to fresh poblano chiles, so used 4 or 5 dried that I soaked in hot water for 30 minutes. I used pumpkin instead of squash, and did not precook. All in all, a moderate amount of work, but worth it.

I love this recipe and I have made it numerous times. I have found that depending on the weather, the cornmeal comes out different every time. I took the suggestion about adding the squash without blanching and this worked perfectly! It is tedious and time consuming, but definetly worth the effort. I have never had so many compliments and requests for the recipe.

My family loved this, even my 4-year old. I enjoyed the taste, especially adding the yogurt to the "polenta". The presentation--if you concern yourself with that kind of thing--was sort of lacking. I found it just about impossible to spread the cornmeal evenly on top of the filling. But again, it tasted great, and that's the important thing. I really don't understand all the complaints about the time it takes. It's definitely not something you want to do for a quick after-work bite to eat, but I don't think I spent quite an hour on the prep work (not counting baking time). As another reviewer said, you need to overlap steps as much as you can: if you have a good nonstick pot for the cornmeal, you don't really need to devote 100% of your attention to it. Broil your chiles while frying your corn mixture. That sort of thing. Also, as someone pointed out, pre-cooking the squash wasn't necessary either. Just slice it and add it, it will cook in the oven. All in all, I liked the dish, but it's definitely one to do because you're in the mood to cook, not just because you're hungry. PS- The black bean soup accompaniment is also a great idea, and can be done while the pie is baking.

I am a professional caterer/personal chef in Boston, and I thought, gee, this might be a good thing to make instead of a lasagna for one of my jobs. I get a certain amount of Bar/Bat Mitzvah work, and it seemed that this recipe could be kid-friendly, and make huge amounts. Well, it turned out to be as labor intensive as a fine French dinner (I am really fast, and I spent 2-3 hours making this), with results that were more than disappointing. The squash with the corn meal/polenta layer worked as a major bad combination of mouth feel. My family loved the spicy corn/herb layer taste, but the overall reaction was "yuck". The corn meal layer was like oatmeal. We experiment constantly in my kitchen; neighborhood kids eat at my table every night. This was a definite loser. I would never make it again. Bon Appetit in the 2000 special hard-cover edition had a totally simple tortilla layered Mexican dish that was way better. Trust me on this one. It simply is not worth the effort.

This was an excellant vegetarian dish. Served it for out of town guests and went over very well. The combination of flavors was just delicious. Allow plenty of time to prepare, we ate later than expected due to the amount of work inolved. Well worth it and makes ALOT!

This recipe is great. It takes some time and effort (nothing compared to making REAL tamales), but it is all worth it. I have served this numerous times at my house and it makes a great potluck dish.

I love this recipe! All the flavors come together so nicely, and the overall presentation. It is definitely a bit of work, but the leftovers the next day make my my co-workers so envious, that alone is worth it!

This was okay. I also liked all the ingredients (and I love tamales) but somehow it didn't come together for me. Considering how much work it was, I probably won't make it again. It did freeze well, though.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe. The taste was not worth all of the effort involved in making it. I usually like everything, but I found this recipe just somehow lacked something. It just wasn't quite what I had expected.

This recipe is no small undertaking but it is my absolute favorite! The polenta "crust" wrapped around so many flavors makes it a real treat. Plenty for everyone!!!

I substituted the polbano Chilies for Roasted Red Peppers and it was really good, although still very time consuming. I found it is best made a day or two before and reheated which makes it easy for a picnic or pot-luck.

Making this dish nearly wore me out. Maybe that says more about my stamina than anything though. I did discover however that it's not necessary to cook squash. Just put raw squash in and it cooks when rest of casserole is baking. Is the cornmeal part *supposed* to be polenta-like?

Excellent! A good vegetarian dish - from a vegetarian reviewer. Overlap some steps so it's not so labor intensive. I used poblano and fresh roasted green chili's for extra "heat". Also, make sure the cornmeal is cooked until extremely thick - otherwise it will be mushy. This reheats well, and makes a lot.

It is an excellent dish, especially for someone to make for a large family on a limited budget. Would like to see more meatless and/or special receipes for diabetics.

This dish was a big success with my housemates who have requested it as their special birthday dish. Since it is so labor intensive, the second time around I doubled the recipe and froze one of the dishes. It froze very well.

This was a very good dish, however, very labor intensive. My guests liked it a lot and it came out just like the picture in the Bon Apetit Magazine. I don't think I would regularly make it and I certainly would not do it the day my guests were coming - way too much work.

This was very good and even better reheated the next day. Lots of steps though. I was almost too tired to enjoy it. Guests enjoyed it.
