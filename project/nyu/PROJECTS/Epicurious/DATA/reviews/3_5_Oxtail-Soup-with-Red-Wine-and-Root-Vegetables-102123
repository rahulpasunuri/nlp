Thankfully I heeded the advice to reduce the amount of water. I used 7 cups and even that was probably a bit too much--if I make this again I will halve it (5 cups). I also heeded the advice that the original recipe was too oniony. I only used the leeks and garlic, no onion, and I didn't miss the onion. This stew would be a solid 3 on the taste scale if the water were reduced. And the parsnips are an excellent touch. But still, there's something lacking here. I'll keep searching for my ideal oxtail stew recipe. P.S. If you follow the directions, this is NOT a fatty stew at ALL. I would suggest to those who thought it was: either you're not skimming all the fat off of the broth, or you're including the fat when you take the meat off of the bone. If you have trouble skimming the fat from the broth, try refrigerating overnight. It will form a hard shell that is easy to take off. The 45 minutes in the freezer didn't do that when I tried it.

In defense of oxtail soup, maybe the reviewers with bad results used poor wine. I've found that mediocre wine RUINS the dish...don't use cheap wine. PS, oxtail is good for you because you're boiling the marrow out of it.

A lot of work but a tasty result PROVIDED you take the time to remove the fat.

Yuchy! Made for someone special who said it was good. It's the 1st thing I ever made that I did not even want to taste. Smelled yuchy. Neighbors dog loved it mixed in with his dry food. Why would anyone choose oxtail over chicken or any other meat. Greasy, gelatinous and gross.

I loved this version. It's a light and almost delicate soup, considering how fatty oxtail is. You can taste all the veggies and the oxtail shines. Used less liquid than called for but that's the only change. Skim, skim, skim that fat. I also got the oxtail from a butcher, not the grocery store.

I was recently served oxtail soup for the first time ever, and it was so delicious, I was prompted to make my own upon seeing oxtails in the supermarket. So, never having made this soup before, I followed the recipe nearly verbatim. I had just shy of 3 lbs of oxtail, and cut back on some of the water. I used Yukon instead of Russets. I added about 1/2cup of leftover tomato puree too. I will say the soup is good, but not like the soup I was served by a friend. His was really silky, and beefy. My husband noted this soup seemed rather onion-y. I'm not sure what I may have done wrong..I did do the beef stock a day ahead to skim the fat off. All meat and cartilage was falling off the bones at the end of step 1. I have asked for my friend's recipe, but if I don't get it, I will still use this recipe again and try some tweaking...

I've been making oxtail soup for 24 years and I love this recipe! The addition of the red wine adds an elegant twist. The key to oxtail soup is in removing the fat. I always make it 2 days before serving so I can skim off as much fat as possible. Don't be afraid of oxtails - they are delicious!

I don't bother removing the meat from the bone and I add cheap stew beef, it falls apart and makes it heartier and still has the amazing ox tail flavor.

I enjoy the gelatinous texture and rich taste of oxtail. I speed up the cooking by browning the oxtail and then cooking it in a pressure cooker along with four sprigs of thyme for 40 minutes under 10 pounds of pressure.

Made this dish verbatim to the recipe and we were very disappointed. While it appeared fine, it had an off taste that seemed to overpower all else and left it inedible. If I were ever to make this again, I would probably cut the wine and parsnip content in half.

Followed the instructions closely except that I added an extra 3/4 cup of wine to the cooking liquid while the meet simmered--a happy accident. In no way did I find the amount of wine excessive. In fact, after all of the vegetables and meat melded together, the end result was a broth of elegant flavors. I added crimini mushrooms to the vegetables, which was a welcome flavor and texture. I could definitely taste the leeks and parsnips and would not make this without them as I believe they specifically made this soup taste so elegant. One piece of advice: skim, skim, skim the fat!! I strained, skimmed, and strained some more. I also used a gravy separator twice! The night I made it everything seemed great and the seemingly small amount of oil that remained was not a problem. The next day I took the leftovers out of the fridge for lunch and found a new and substantial fat layer had formed! In an ideal situation, I would make it the day before I planned to eat it so that I could literally peel the fat layer off and be totally done with it! The fat separating was more work than anticipated, but SO worth the effort!!!

I made this for a dinner party and it turned out really well. I had to make it without the parsley and leeks because I tried to get them at the last minute and got told at the store that you have to special order them. I live in a one horse town. Anyway, if you can't get some of the ingredients, make it anyway. Leek is similar to onion and parsnips have a lot in common with carrots, so I added more carrots and onions than the recipe called for and the soup was pretty good.

Rich and delicious.

What a great winter soup. I used a medium priced Cabernet, and 2 -1/2 oz pkgs. of dried Porcini mushrooms soaked in 1.5 cups of warm water. I added the mushrooms in with the vegetables and also strained the mushroom liquid into the mix. I used pearl barley instead of potato because I like the texture and smoothness it imparts into the stock. Overall an excellent recipe and the whole family loved it.

Excellent soup. I cooked it on Saturday & then skimmed and reduced on Sunday. I added red cabbage with the vegetables & red peppers-- this was a great addition. The soup is rich, hearty & a meal with crusty bread. A keeper.

Yes,PLEASE roast the oxtails in the oven with a bit of olive oil. I did it at 450 degrees, about 10 min each side. Then I put the heavy pan I roasted them in on the stove and deglazed with red wine. Then I cooked the meat with more wine and water and beef broth for about 3 hours, removed the meat and chilled overnight, completing the soup the next day. I added mushrooms. Dark and hearty, to say the least! Please try the parsnips or use purple top turnip. Tasted good with a darkish beer and bread. The next day we served seasoned and garlicky leftover mashed potatoes in the bottom of the soup bowl with this oxtail soup. A side of dark cooked greens was just right.

I made this with some leftover bones from a prime rib roast instead of oxtails. I reduced the liquid, but otherwise made the recipe pretty much the way it was written. The result was flavorful and rich, very satisfying.

Very nice, and very easy. Don't omit the parsnips; they retain their distinctive flavor (unlike the potatoes) and mesh well with the carrots. And do add more garlic. I used a medium priced shiraz, which worked great. A keeper.

I would make this recipe again because the family liked it. Except I would not use the parsnips, I would use more potato instead. I only used 2 cups of red wine because adding another seemed very strong. And lastly I would cut up the oxtail meat after removing it from the bones so there is more meat to go around. :)

I don't know why people don't put the parsnips in. I've only just discovered this vegetable, and if there is a nicer one that you can put in a soup, I don't know what it is. The only really involved part of the recipe is boning the oxtails. To the leftovers, I added cooked barley, and I will do so again in future. I suspect mushrooms (maybe reconstituted porcini and their strained soaking liquid together) would put it over the top. As is, a very nice lunch on a cold day.

Just made this for the first time for a party and received many complements. I made a few variations from the recipe: added: celery, daikon raddish, can of stewed tomato; deleted parsnips. I ended up with quite a large pot of soup. Maybe a half portion is better for 6 servings or less.

This is a delicious recipe. I made it exactly as written with two exceptions: I only made half and I used a beautiful leftover beef rib roast. It was delicious. My whole kitchen is perfumed with it's aroma. I plan to make this again with the oxtails I have in my freezer.

Talk about comfort food! This is it! I forgot to buy the canned soup, so I used 2 1/2 pkgs. of Liptons Beefy Onion mix. Defatted and used red potatoes and celery as some of the others suggested - instead of parsnips and leeks.

This was really good, it has given my family one more way to prepare oxtail. Usually our oxtail recipe calls for peanut butter and some children are allergic to peanut butter. So this recipe stretches a family's meal and gives all (from grandpa to little tot) a meal to look forward to even to the next day's leftovers. Thanks.

This recipe is very similar to our family's recipe from Chicago. We variate the recipe with two cups ruby port, instead of a lighter red wine while cooking the broth. I also removed the parsnips & added julienne celery to the saute vegetables. At the end we add a large tomato, diced and drained, and simmer fifteen minutes.

The scent of this soup made us think we were in Paris, hot French bread, and wine. Warmed the heart and soul.

It was good, but next time will leave out the parsnip and leeks. After making the broth, try to get all the fat out because it is very greasy if you don't. Next time I will use red or yukon potatoes because they hold up better in the soup and use burgundy wine instead of the merlot I used the first time.

I love oxtails. This is a recipe that can be adjusted with any vegies one likes. Just be patient with the cooking time because all good things take time, and add 1/2 tsp of thyme to each 3 lbs of oxtails you cook. A salad, custy bread, and red wine. Buen provecho, and "Ita dakimas!"

This stuff is very good. One word of advice though...definitely ROAST THE OXTAILS FIRST, or brown on each side in a pan. I've also tried adding a little roux at the end to thicken; but it's great with or without it. Warm french bread a must.
