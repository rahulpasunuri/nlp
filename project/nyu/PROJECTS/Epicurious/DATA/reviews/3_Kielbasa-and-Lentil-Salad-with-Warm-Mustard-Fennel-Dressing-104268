There is a simpler way to make this. Precook your lentils in the microwave. Saute the sliced kielbasa, remove and wipe out skillet. Add a little olive oil, add sliced garlic and saute til golden and don't remove the garlic. Add the onions, carrots, and celery and saute for a minute, add the lentils, 4-5 tablespoons mustard, a little liquid-if there wasn't any in the lentils. Check seasonings and cook till heated through. I poured this over a bed of argula and added the sausages. Very flavorfull

I loved this and so did my guests. Read the reviews in advance and therefore doubled mustard and vinegar mixture and it was super moist and flavorful. Also, didn't have fennel but will be trying it next time. Would also like to try a poached egg on top, like a french frisee salad.

Some interesting ingredients go into this dish, but the final product leaves something to be desired. What though? Perhaps doubling the mustard and vinegar mixture might give the other ingredients the fanfare they deserve.

This was just ok, surprising to me because the finished result was not up to the sum of its parts. It was bland overall, and does not make my recipe-cut of "Will anyone ask to have this again?" Not in our house, so out it goes!

I really liked the mustard sauce, but thought the lentil base was fairly dry. I made the recipe again and omitted the lentils and vegetables altogether, doubled the sauce (but used only about 1/2 cup vinegar), cooked the fennel along with red pepper and mushrooms, and served it all over mashed potatoes. After all those changes, it was a huge hit. Will certainly make it again that way- might serve it over potatoes anna next time.

This was a little too dry for our taste. Also thought the mustard dressing disguised the flavor of the fennel, so why bother with the expensive vegetable?

Great recipe! Nice mix of flavors, easy to make, and keeps well (I'm eating it cold for lunch right now, a week later).

Very tasty recipe. Even for vegetarians. Just omit the kielbasa. Have made it several times.

Great recipe! I am a novice and this was very easy to make. I used turkey kielbasa and browned sausage with H2O instead of oil. Add yellow bell pepper(raw) and you have a beautiful salad that is hearty enough for lunch or light dinner. Also good without fennel and definately a keeper.

nice taste, very filling ... would serve at least 6 meal portion... There is only 2 of us and we could eat probably 3 more days on what is left!

I made this dish because my mother makes a lentil and kielbasa dish that is pretty tasteless and this one looked interesting. Well, she loved it, and she doesn't really like anything. She even had it for dinner the next two nights! I especially like the zip that the mustard and vinegar give the dish. I'm sure that whenever my mother reaches for the lentils and kielbasa, she'll be substituting this recipe for her old one. She's going to kill me if she ever reads this!!
