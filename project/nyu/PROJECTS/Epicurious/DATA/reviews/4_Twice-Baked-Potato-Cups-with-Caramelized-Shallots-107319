This is our fifth (!) Christmas making these and they still rock. Over the years we have made substitutions... we cut the havarti in half and add in some cheddar. Also add some melted butter into the filling as well as salt, pepper, and some paprika instead of the cayenne. Delicious!

This recipe is one I have made over and over. I prefer a sharper cheese, so the only change I made was using Gruyere instead of Havarti.

Rating: 3
I thought these were good. I used the Havarti and thought it was a good balance, however seeing all the comments on others using cheddar instead has got me considering other cheeses. I think a nice smoked gouda could be amazing, but cheddar in my mind, isn't the best match with shallot.

Made this for Christmas dinner along side my rib roast. Instead of adding the cayenne pepper, I added a couple of heads of roasted garlic. It really enhanced the final potato flavor. Agreed about the shallots. the crispy bits really make the recipe, but don't over cook them when caramelizing as they continue to cook in the oven when baking the second time! I also used the left over potato for hash browns the next morning and they were awesome!

I have prepared this recipe at least ten times, and it has always been a success. It is so easy to make in advance, leaving you more time with your guests.

Yum. Next time will try with cheddar and maybe bacon, but the shallots were fantastic.

I always make a recipe as stated and then make changes if necessary. I loved these, and I do understand what other reviewers said about making it with a sharper cheese. I think it depends on what else in on the menu. For the steamed lobsters, I could have used a little more oopmf. If I were making a roast with a flavorful rub and a sauce, I'd leave it alone. I agree with another reviewer - can't have enough of the shallots. Make more.

superb. Per other suggestions, used sharp white cheddar in place of the havarti. Also mixed in some finely chopped bacon.

Made these last year for Christmas and they were way too spicy with the Cayenne pepper. This year, I am making them again, but I omitted the Cayenne. I also added a 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese; the Havarti is good but kind of bland. I also melted some butter directly in with the whipped potatoS... it's perfect now!

Why would any one put cheddar cheese is this recipe and ruin it. It is a gourmet recipe and the havarti and shallots make it unique and special. Such a refreshing change from the boring twice baked potatoes with cheddar.

Rating: 3
i am surprised that no recent reviewers have suggested cutting back on the cayenne. I have made it twice as written (though substituting cheddar for havarti), and both sets of guests thought there was simply too much cayenne. As did my husband and I! Next time I will cut it back to 1/8 tsp (50% reduction). Very nice presentation!

Really great. Freeze really well, before second bake. About 40min at 350 from frozen, yum.

These are great but I added some grated parmesan too. They were even great the next day, which we found out by accident, I always cook more than I need. Yum!

I made these for a dinner party and my guests loved them. Prepared these the night before and simply heated before eating. Used sharp cheddar as others suggested. I put each potato cup in a regualar muffing tin to reheat, which helped keep them from falling over as I moved them to and from the oven. Can't wait to make again!

Oh what a hit!! I made this for our Christmas party and got Oooos and Aaaas. Then I made it again for Christmas dinner. Excellent. Will make many more times! I used the sharp cheddar but everything else was the same. Simple, easy, tasty and perfect!

I have made this recipe for the past three years for Christmas dinner and it is unbelievably good. My guests rave over it and you can make it a day ahead. I usually serve it with tenderloin and a broccoli side dish. The Havarit cheese is perfect. I usually will tweek a recipe but this one I always follow to a T. I am going to make it again this year.

I made several of the twice-baked potato recipes from this site as my contribution to a potluck, and this was by far the best, without much fuss. The shallots make the recipe. I'm going to make them for Thanksgiving this year.

This is great. I've made several times - the only thing I would suggest is using sharp white cheddar instead of the havarti for better flavor. I've tried both ways and it really is better with the cheddar.

After reading other reviews I used a sharp cheddar instead of havarti and it was very good. I used 1%milk instead of whole only because it was all I had but even with these changes they were very creamy.

I made this recipe as my contribution to a New Year's Eve dinner party. They were easy to prepare as I made them in the morning and reheated at the hostess' house. I did not have Havarti cheese but used a sharp Cheddar as suggested by one reviewer. I could not taste the cheese and will most likely leave it out next time;therefore less fat--I also used light sour cream and 1% milk. The carmelized shallots made this dish along with the fact that the potatoes are cut crosswise. Great presentation! The potatoes were served with Herb- and-Garlic Crusted Beef Tenderloin (Dec 99) and a salad. A wonderful celebration dinner!

Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!! I will definately make this again

I agree with some of the other people that the havarti cheese doesn't give the potato much flavor. Seemed like just a plain twice baked to me. I would suggest a different kind of cheese. Cute presentation.

Rating: 4
Fabulous and the presentation is so elegant. Shallots will brown further in baking, so don't let them get too brown in the saute step.

Rating: 3
Just the right amount of cayenne. I forgot to add the Havarti and it was still very good. The smaller serving is also much nicer than a whole potato on your plate.

Rating: 4
BIG HIT!! Particularly like the technique of cutting the potatoes in the opposite way from the usual---takes up less room on the plate and feels less daunting to take a "whole" potatoe. Everyone asked for the receipt. Do freeze the cheeze before shredding in the food processor--big help.

Rating: 3
I found the Havarti to be an ideal cheese for this -- not overly assertive. The cayenne is essential for a little kick, so don't leave it out. I made this the night before and reheated as recommended.

Rating: 3
The carmelized shallots were to die for, and the presentation of these potato cups is just exquisite. I made the recipe as dictated except I added a little parmesan cheese to the mixture. Even so, I found that the flavor wasn't quite strong enough. Next time I'll probably leave out the Havarti altogether and substitute a stronger cheese like cheddar or monterey jack, as some of the other cooks suggested. Still, these were delicious. Highly recommended.

Rating: 3
These were wonderful and so beautiful! I made them exactly according to the recipe. The caramelized shallots were PERFECT. But next time I might try a stronger cheese, like the cheddar people recommended. I felt that it could've done with a bit more flavor.

This is a wonderful change to the standard twice baked potato. Delicious. Followed the recipe exactly, no substitutions.

What a time saver! My 13 year old grandaughter insisted on bacon, so I sauted the shallots in bacon grease and crumbled the bacon with the cooked shallots. Really delicious.

Double bakes are simply a classic which I just love to make and this new twist on it is just wonderful. The havarti is so daring and sweetness of the caramelized shallots is amazing.

I made the recipe and froze the potato cups filled and the shallots separately. Thawed at room temperature before warming in the oven.I did sprinkle more cheese on top under the shallots. They were perfect. Great for a last minute meal or prepared ahead of time for a feast.

This is a great recipe! I made this for a dinner party last night and it was a total hit! I had to use what was available at home, so in went the parmasean cheese, chives, and sauted onions (which was so amazingly good)! These potoatoes looked like it was done by a top notch chef in a high end resturant! I will definitley make this recipe again!

Made this as written and was a bit disappointed...thought they were on the blah side. Next time, I'll try cheddar as others have done.

I baked potatoes day ahead. Used white cheddar instead of Havarti and put potato mixture in ramekins rather then potato cups. I dolloped with 1 tsp. unsalted butter and baked at 350` for about 20 minutes until golden. Wonderful and doing a day ahead was helpful.

People were skeptical about not having traditional mashed potatoes but this dish won them over. Even the timid enjoyed the spice of the cayenne (which I doubled).

Rating: 4
Although I'm sure the previous reviewers are right that this tastes great using the ingredients as written, I found this to be an extremely versatile recipe. I had to use what we had onhand - gouda cheese, 2% milk, and hot sauce instead of Harvarti, whole mile & cayenne. Plus, I carmelized onions in place of shallots. In the future, I would try it again for an hors d'oeuvre tray using bite sized red potatoes and decorated with the carmelized shallots and maybe a few slices of chives. All kinds of things could be added to the stuffing mixture - your imagination is the limit!

Rating: 4
I didn't realize that I only had small red potatoes until I looked in the pantry, so I boiled them and mashed with the other ingredients, and warmed it in a casserole dish with the shallots on top. Worked out perfectly, although not as pretty as the potato cups. Love the cayenne and the shallots.

This is a keeper, I sliced the potato lenghtwise as opposed to what is shown in the photo. Added some cooked crumbled bacon to the recipe, otherwise pretty well stuck to the recipe. Everyone raved on and on!

What is better than a dinner party side dish that can be made in advance, looks impressive and tastes fantastic? Made these for New Year's Eve...they were great - made them exactly to the recipe and only suggestion I would have is to double the caramelized shallots. We couldn't get enough of them!

Made it exactly to recipe specifications. Don't really have anything to add that hasn't been said in other reviews, but certainly wanted to add another vote for extreme satisfaction with this recipe. I did particularly enjoy the carmelized onions, and felt they were worth the effort.

Best twice baked potatoes I've ever made or eaten (and I've tried many recipes since my husband's family loves these type potatoes)...my guest's raved about this recipe. I used Havarti cheese; don't skimp on the carmelized shallots...they are incredible! Even my "non-onion" eating guests couldn't get enough of them...they kept eyeballing everyone else's plate to try to pirate shallot crumbs. This will be our twice-baked potato recipe from now on.

this was FANTASTIC!!! :) i added a little brown sugar to the shallots for a sweeter taste

This was so good! It was even good reheated the next day. I made it exactly as written and it came out great. I piped it in with a pastry bag and it looked so pretty. Next time maybe add some chopped chives to the top for a splash of color. I had a bag of russets, and they averaged about 7 oz. each(much less than the 12 oz. asked for) but this made smaller cups, which were just so cute. Would be great for a party.

Made this for a party a few months ago and everyone is still raving. I used a combination of Havarti and Pepper Jack cheese (omitted the cayenne) and whipped the filling so it was smooth enough to be piped into the cups. Arranged on a platter of curly parsley for a buffet presentation. Delicious and looks fabulously tempting. Not a single one was left.

Excellent presentation & taste! The only thing I changed was I carmelized the shallots. I just added some rice wine vinegar & brown sugar - yum! Will definitely make again!

Very good and fun presentation. I don't like Swiss cheese so I used a mixture of Monterey Jack and Spicy Jack cheese. I also added roasted garlic to the potatoes-YUM!! Loved the shallots on top and I would definitely make these again. Easy to personalize to your own liking-ease up on the cayenne if you don't like it spicy (which I love!!).

We served these potatoes with marinated lamb chops and green beans, and they were a hit. The recipe was simple enough that my husband made them! Next time I think we'd use a mixer to whip the potatoes, as the masher left large chunks which we didn't prefer. The shallots make the dish fabulous, and we also left some cheese for the top (under the shallots) which was yummy as well. People were asking for the recipe...always a good sign!

I agree with the previous reviewer about going lighter on the cayenne. Though I like spicy food, this had just a little too much of a kick to it. However, it makes for a beautiful presentation and provides really nice flavor and textures.

Made these for my wife's early morning walking group Christmas dinner party last evening; everyone (14) loved them and we will definitely make again. Next time I may go light on the cayenne; also, there was alot of potato leftover after filling the skins; time consuming preparation, but worth it and no last minute work when you make a day ahead!

This was so yummy. The shallots are awesome, so crispy and flavorful. My family thought it was bacon at first. I did substitute parmasean cheese instead of havarti. I will be making these soon, the presentation is great. Choose a small thin potato.

This was very good, but baking the potatoes right on the rack in the oven makes a total mess. I'd place them on foil the next time. The cayenne was strong - way too strong for the kids. The recipe benefits from a bit of a kick - so I'd just reduce the cayenne the next time. The presentation is beautiful.

Rating: 3
Very good. I would have liked the shallots more deep fried/frizzled to put on top instead of soft and carmelized.

YUM! These are the BEST twice-baked potatoes I've ever made or tasted. The guests at my dinner party all agreed that these are delicious. The cayenne gives them a little kick and the carmelized shallots are a real treat. I wouldn't change a thing.
