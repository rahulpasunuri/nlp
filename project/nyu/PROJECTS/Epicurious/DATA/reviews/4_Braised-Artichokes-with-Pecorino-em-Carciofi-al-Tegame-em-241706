I have always been intimidated by the artichoke cleaning process, and have largely avoided it until now. But, after watching a demo on you tube, I decided that this would be my next attempt. This recipe was beautiful, simple and absolutely delicious. I used 4 large organic artichokes, and subbed leeks for onions, which I would highly recommend! This recipe is definitely going into the rotation.

This was delicious. We used it as a crostini topping but I could have eaten the whole thing right out of the pan.

This is a delicious way to cook artichokes, and very straightforward. I enjoyed it very much as written, but also find that it holds up to adaptation well. My favorite variation is to use leeks instead of onions, skip the garlic & peperoncino,and use a butter/olive oil blend. Very rich and savory.

Kept to the directions on this recipe but found I had to cook the artichokes longer than suggested. Used baby artichokes and I sliced them to 1/2 inch but they still took a long time. Flavor was a bit bland even with the cheese. It was just OK for us.

This is obviously a very delicious recipe, because I messed it up royallly, and it was still delicious. I cooked it exactly as it is written, with the addition of a bit of extra salt. I wish in there were directions provided on how to prepare the artichokes, however. I'm used to making stuffed artichokes, where most of the vegetable including the leaves are used -- so I didn't take all the outer leaves off when I cleaned them. I realized my mistake at the first bite, and although I don't mind working for my food (as I said, I'm used to eating stuffed), I'll definitely remember to prepare them correctly the next time I make this.
