We liked it. I think the directions for the nori mean for you to cut the original nori sheet from short side to short side, leaving a long, narrow rectangle to work from. That creates a short sushi roll for the 3 slices, 2 of which will be decorative with the leaves sticking out. My first roll was mushy and hard to cut,but I wrung out the crab mixture and it worked better!

Hmm, I didn't think this was all that difficult or expensive at all. I did substitute "krab" for the crabmeat - (give me a break you food elitists, I'm in college!) - and added avocado slices to the rolls. Served with pickled ginger slices and soy sauce as well as a sauce that is a close relative to a spring roll dipping sauce. Presentation not much of an issue - the rolls cut fine, and extra mint sprigs hid any mistakes. :)

This was delicious. Rolling sushi for the first time is tricky, but practice makes it easier. Any knife will do, as long as it's thin and sharp -- just let the knife work and don't apply a lot of pressure. I liked this combination, especially with the nori.

Out of the hundreds of recipes I've sucessfuly followed from epicurious this was definatly the worst. It was messy, difficult, and expensive. Expect to purchase a sushi knife if you don't already have one, otherwise you may as well just pound the roll with a mallet because that's pretty much what a chef's knife will do. Good luck!

What a mess! But the filling was good. My first attempt and tasting of nori. I didn't understand the directions for size and rolling of nori. My husband said there was too much nori in the roll. How can you cut the roll into three sections and have all three look like the picture? I took the nori off and used rice paper. The combination of crab, mango, and mint is great. I'll make this again after I've watched some sushi chefs roll in my local supermarket.
