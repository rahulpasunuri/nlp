I'm with chocoloco, buy the sweet potatoes fresh and bake them. They might not need any added sugar at all.

I used my own recipe for 10 inch pie crust but used the filling pretty much as written except that I used a bag of the frozen sweet potatoes that get microwaved in the bag and then mashed. It turned out to be at least 2 cups (perhaps a little more than 2 cups)and I used all with very good results. I used my handheld Braun blender and the texture was silky smooth. It was just the right amount for a 10 inch pie.I baked it for closer to an hour and made sure the center (not just the edges) was puffed up before I took it out of the oven and it was done perfect. I served it with whipped cream that had just a dash of orange extract besides the usual vanilla and confectioners sugar. Everyone loved it!

I have used this recipe many times (but with a store-bought crust and a couple of times without the mace as I didn't have any on hand and it turned out fine... I may have used a little ginger and/or nutmeg instead or not) and it is every bit as good as I remember my east Texan grandmother's sweet potato pies. I love that it uses the microwave to prepare the potatoes for mashing. With the pre-made crust and the microwave, I find this great recipe a snap to make.

I can't figure out how to update my earlier review, so I'll add more here. I used only 3/4 cup dark brown sugar, a tbsp bourbon in addition to the other spices, nonfat evaporated milk instead of cream - blended everything in our Blendtec for silky smooth pie. I also used Trader Joe's frozen pie crust (much easier than making my own!) Cooked on rack in bottom 1/4 of oven at 400 for 45 min. No trouble with burning - the pie came out light, not too sweet, almost like a souffle. Pie plus some Haagan Das Vanilla ice cream and YUM!

Definitely bake the sweet potato/yams! They become carmelized and MUCH sweeter and smoother than microwaved yams (which I found get stringy). I substituted evaporated milk for the cream (nonfat!) and added an extra tbsp MakersMark bourbon to give the pie an adult Southern flourish.

This was very tasty! Just made this tonight and what a success! It was my first attempt at S.P Pie and I think I like it over pumpkin pie too. The crust was perfect. My changes: I added some flax seed meal crushed and some chopped almonds to the mix to add some texture and I ended up adding in the yolk from the egg-wash. I didn't have mace spice on hand so I too used allspice. Very good!

I love this recipe. It's so easy, and it always comes out smooth and silky and perfect. Much preferred over pumpkin pie. I make it into a torte using a 10-inch springform pan. I make the crust as the recipe says, press it into the bottom of the pan and about halfway up the sides (don't bother with the chilling and rolling, saves all kids of time). Then I DOUBLE the filling and bake it for between 55-60 minutes. This way you get twice as much of the best part of the pie (the filling!) with no additional work. Yum! I also added some allspice and ginger to the mix for extra zing.

wonderful. flaky crust, nicely seasoned filling. not as good as my grandmothers- but i've tried 5 or 6 other versions and this one is as amazing.thank you epicurious.

i made this for my family and everyone absolutely loved it. Even my dad, who isn't the biggest fan of pumpkin pie, loved it. The only problem is that I'm trying to figure out how to not burn the crust. I do put the egg whites on it but that still doesn't work for my oven. If this wasn't a problem, this pie would be prefect.

Hard to tell the difference between this pie and pumpkin pie--it is not as sweet but just as delicious. Make this recipe for people who love pumpkin pie but don't like it so sweet. Consider keeping the ingredients your secret. I served it at Thanksgiving but my hard-headed guests wouldn't touch it because it wasn't pumpkin. Be careful you don't buy too many sweet potatoes and end up with too much batter. Two large sweet potatoes left me with almost enough filling to make a second pie. Next time I make this I will use canned potatoes.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving. Some of the people had never had sweet potato pie, and they all thought it was better than pumpkin pie. I made the recipe as stated except substituted nutmeg for mace. Next time I will bake it at 375 since my crust browned early and had to cover the edges with foil.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. The pie had a mild flavor with a smooth and creamy texture. Not sweet like pumpkin pie. I'll definitely make this again.

I made this recipe pretty much as instructed and it was excellent. I had 3 potatoes and managed to fit all the filling I made into the crust (I upped the cooking time to 1 hour to accommodate the extra thickness). I also substituted 1/2 tsp. nutmeg for mace. I think I would add even more spices next time - especially since I dont mind it being a lot like pumpkin pie. I do recommend this recipe and will probably use the crust for other things as well. It was both flaky and easy - the two most essential qualities of a pastry crust as far as Im concerned. 4 forks from me!

I made it vegetarian, substituting one silken tofu for the eggs and cream, put everything in the processor until creamy. it came out like a sweet potato soufle' yummy!

I combined my cooked sweet potatoes, cream, and sugar in a blender until I had a very smooth consistency. I then added the eggs and spices to the potato blend with a whisk in a mixing bowl. The pie turned out smooth and creamy - like a fine sweet potato custard. Delicious! I know I'll be making this one often.

Let me just say, i was VERY dissapointed with this pie. Usually, i follow my family's sweet potato pie recipe, but this time, i thought i'd prepare one for a friend of mine differntly by following this recipe because of the high ratings. Normally, when we make SPP, we use gram cracker crust. This dough crust just didn't seem to go with the filling at all. the filling itself didn't really have a Sweet Potato taste either. I have never made a sweet potato pie that tasted like pumpkin pie (bland pumpkin pie that is )until last night, and that in itself was a dissapointment. If i wanted pumpkin, i would have made pumpkin. There was hardly any Sweet potato flavoring at all, and i followed this recipe to a "T". I think i'll just stick to my passed down family recipe, because if it aint broke, dont fix it. I may even post it on the site.

I entered this sweet potatoe pie in my church bake-off and I won 2nd place. First time in trying it. Read the reviews and felt courageous. I served sweetened whip cream with grated orange zest alongside. Regarding the crust. I added a couple of TBS. of heavy cream for part of the ice water amount called for. I blindbaked the crust a little while as i was afraid of a soggy crust on the bottom. Quite flaky and delicious. Needless to say I was quite thrilled when my name was called!

Oops... the pie crust recipe I left below is incomplete, as I left out the SALT!!!! It should read: 1 cup flour, 1 tsp salt, 1/3 cup lard, 1/3 cup shortening, 1/2 cup cold water = 2 pie crusts.

Rating: 4
This is a very sweet pie. I plan to do less packing of the brown sugar next time. I make my crust differently from the recipe above: 1 cup flour, cut in a third of a cup shortening and a third of a cup lard (grandma used bacon grease back in the day), and add a half cup cold water. This recipe makes 2 crusts... but actually, I prefer to roll the crust out thinner than some might prefer... so I have enough for 2 9-inch pies and one mini pie. This is not for the cholesterol conscious, but a great treat for the holidays

I come from a long line of esteemed sweet potato pie "experts," so I was a little anxious to actually try my hand at one. Luckily, like the reviewer whose comments gave me the nerve to go for it, I, too, thought this was the best I had ever tasted. Actually, so did everyone else. Do not use another crust recipe, do not substitute evaporated milk for the cream, and--whatever you do-- do not use a frozen pie crust. This recipe is really outstanding as is. The filling is a delightful dense custard and the crust is tender, flaky, and very flavorful. Also, easy to manipulate with a rolling pin. A HUGE success!

I'd never made sweet potato pie before, but my brother loves it, so I thought I'd give it a shot for Thanksgiving, and this was wonderful! It's quite light - almost like a custard pie. To me, the crust is definitely as important as the filling, so I always make it from scratch, and this crust recipe wasn't bad. Unfortunately, the crust burned on one side (maybe because of the egg white?), but other than that, the pie was fabulous.

First sweet potato pie I have ever made, best sweet potato pie I have ever had. I am generally more of a chef and not much of baker, but this was easy and fantastic! I cheated and bought deep dish pie crusts. (I doubled the recipe and this filled 2 deep dish 9" crusts and one regular 9") & I skipped the egg white brushing. I plan to take this to thanksgving. Highly recommended

There is a piece missing from the recipe - what about adding and mixing the spices, eggs cream etc. to the cooked potatoes? Epicurious is great for neophites like me, but we need ALL the instructions!! I haven't eaten it yet, so I can't grade the results.

Great recipe! The only change I made was using evaporated whole milk instead of cream, and the taste was great. My husband's favorite dessert in the world is sweet potato pie and he loved it; the only thing keeping this from a 4-fork rating is that while the texture was classic for sweet potato pie and the taste was great, it resembled pumpkin pie to both of us... the sweet potato pies we've had before taste considerably different from pumpkin. I'll definitely make this again, but experiment a little with the spices!

This was my first attempt at making a sweet potato pie -- the flavor is outstanding, but I did a few things that made the texture a bit off. Live and learn (and share with others so that they might avoid my mistakes!) I used about 2 cups of riced sweet potato puree instead of 1 1/2 c, and instead of heavy cream, 1 cup of evaporated milk, since that's what I prefer in similar pies. The balance was off, and the pie was not as creamy as I would have liked. I think the evaporated milk would have worked fine if not for the extra sweet potato -- although next time I'd probably use the 1 cup of evaporated milk and add about 1/2 cup of heavy cream to richen it up a bit. But I suspect more evaporated milk would get me there as well. The other thing I did was to make the filling ahead of time, and refrigerated it for a few hours before filling and baking the pie. It seemed thicker on standing than when I originally mixed it up. Bottom line -- it didn't look "right" when I filled the pie shell... next time I'll trust my instincts and add more liquid. I'm not a big baker so I'm usually hesitant to improvise with pies and such. If you like sweet potato pie, do try this recipe as written (or sub the evap milk). I'm sure if you follow the instructions it's fabulous.. and it wasn't far off even with my mishaps.

This was my first sweet potato pie ever and it exceeded all expectations. It tastes like the best pumpkin pie you ever had. If you have Nutmeg in your spice cabinet, there is no reason to go out and buy Mace. (Which I couldn't find). Two days later, the leftovers were still good.

Absolutely delicious. This is what sweet potato pie should taste like. I used the white sweet potatoes so that the texture would be more like potato - not pumpkin or yam, which I do not care for. I also eliminated the mace as I do not like that spice. The pie did crack, but beautiful whipped cream piping made this pie a star.

I made this instead of the traditional pumpkin pie for thansgiving. One of our guests brought pumpkin pie and my husband did a blind taste test with both since he absolutely loves pumpkin pie. He couldn't tell the difference, and neither could our guests! The recipe as written made too much for one deep dish pie shell, so I baked the remainder in a separate ramekin. It was wonderful when warm. I will definitely be making this again!
