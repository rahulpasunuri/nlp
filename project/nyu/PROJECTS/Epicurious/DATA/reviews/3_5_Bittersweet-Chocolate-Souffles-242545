Easy and delicious. My guests were impressed and since I could make this the day before, I was able to hang out with the guests instead of slaving away in the kitchen while they were waiting. I used this recipe for 6 souffles to make bigger ones and added vanilla bean ice cream, raspberries and mint sprigs.

Delicious. Topped with some Chantilly cream and served it with a raspberry dessert wine, and all my guests raved.

Made these as part of a plated wine dinner, and was very disappointed at how dry and heavy they were. They were not nearly as light and puffy as I had expected. Followed instructions to the letter and do not usually have any problems with souffles. Only thing I can think of is that I saved them refrigerated for several hours before baking.

I actually messed up this recipe. It rose and I thought it was done, but after I stuck my spoon in, the inside needed more time. After freaking out, I shoved them back in the oven, the one I stabbed puffed up AGAIN, and they came out perfect and sooooo delicious. I'll always use this recipe.

Under my supervision, three teenagers made these souffles as part of a Mothers' Day dinner for their families. We prepared the souffle batter in the morning. Then they made ice cream, and the rest of the dinner. The souffles were absolutely the hit of the dinner. Outstanding - and so easy! The girls' previous attempts at chocolate souffles had failed - I suspect they got yolk into the egg whites - so this was a special accomplishment for them, greatly enhanced by how good the dessert turned out to look and taste. Delicious.

We made these souffles the day before and cooked them just before serving. Didn't change a thing and they were absolutely scrumptious. My husband served them with fresh blackberries and a sprinkling of powdered sugar. They looked as wonderful as they tasted. Highly recommend this recipe for a show stopping dessert that is super easy.
