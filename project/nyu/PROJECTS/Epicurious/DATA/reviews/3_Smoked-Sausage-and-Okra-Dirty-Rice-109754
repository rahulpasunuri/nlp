I agree with the other comments this was an unnecessarily "busy" recipe. The seasoning was bland with just salt and pepper. I would have preferred something a bit more spicy. Will make again with modifications.

I also omitted the okra (can't stand the stuff) and spiced it up with 1/2 tsp each of basil and oregano, 1/4 tsp each of thyme and cayenne pepper, and 1 tsp paprika, which kept it from being "bland" (a complaint of one reviewer) and was true to its Cajun origins. I also used the andouille sausage, which is just spicy enough. My family loved it!

I made this recipe to serve at a Mardi Gras dinner party. I thought the recipe was a bit more "busy" than it needed to be for a rice recipe so I changed it a bit. I sauteed the sausage, drained off the fat, and then sauteed the onions peppers and garlic in the same pot (I omitted the okra). I added beef stock and brought it to a boil and then added the remaining ingedients (including the cooked sausage and veggies) covered, reduced to low and simmered for 20 minutes until the rice was done. I sprinkled with snipped chives as I had those on hand rather than the scllions. Also, the recipe calims it serves 8. Those must be entree portions. I cut the recipe in half and it made eight side servings.

It just tasted like green pepper to me, very boring and not worth all the work.

Our choices are limited with my wife being gluten intolerant, dairy intolerant, and other specific allergic reactions(msg, etc.). This dish was fabulous. Use organic brown rice in a rice cooker for 2/3ds timing and finished in the pan with the main ingredients.

A really tasty, easy to make dish. The recipe calls for pork sausauge, but I used chicken andouille, and it worked out really well, quite tasty, and a bit healthier. the only thing i'd do differently, i think, next time, is rather than go with small cubes of sausage, bigger pieces, maybe slices would be better. we also added some sliced mushrooms, a pleasant accident, which worked out well.

Very good side with the Grilled Shrimp from the same issue. Will definitely make again.

I used kielbasa and timidly used half the okra. My Husband couldn't stop raving about it. He even loved it as leftovers.
