I actually made this with eggplant instead of potatoes, just because we've eaten so many potatoes lately. I roasted the fresh okra and eggplant (unpeeled, diced into large chunks) at 425 with only 2 T of oil. I made the salad with the edamame and a friend's home-canned sweet corn. Otherwise I started with all the recommended seasonings, reduced the olive oil in the dressing, but found it needed more kick, as others suggested. So I added extra lemon juice and minced shallot, and threw in some roasted grape tomatoes. Very satisfying salad, and a great base for experimentation.

Simple, easy summer salad. Something new to do with okra is always welcome. Here's my take: http://sweetspatulas.com/2012/07/22/roasted-potato-and-okra-salad/

Made almost exactly as the recipe was written up to the dressing, which was too bland and not sufficient quantity. Next time, I'll use 3 pounds of potatoes and 1.5 pounds of favas, or none because they are such tediously fiddly things to prep. The potatoes roasted in 20 minutes, and the okra only took 6, so watch them. I think that halved grape tomatoes would be a good add, and I put in a whole bunch of minced scallions and some cider vinegar to up the dressing flavor. Otherwise, I really like this recipe as it is a tasty new way to use okra, and the okra/potato/corn/tomato combo is a locavore home run for late Spring in south FL.

This is such an interesting and delicious salad - it's perfect for vegetarians. I had a nightmare with the fava beans though. I couldn't get fresh or packaged and had to settle for dried. This was a big mistake and very time consuming. I have no idea what people were thinking by drying fava beans; it is impossible to get them in any semblance of a reconstituted bean. I will have to make a hummus out of the disastrous results. Anyway, in the end I used cannellini beans and they worked fine in the salad. I think there is a world of difference in using fresh corn and okra.

I should confess upfront that I only used this recipe as a very loose base for what I actually made. I used small red and purple potatoes, roasted them with the okra as described (except I used frozen cut okra and also added artichoke hearts to the mix). For the salad mix-in I used edamame and corn. I kept the dressing as described. The I way I made it was delicious. I would imagine the real recipe was too, I just didn't have all of the ingredients on hand. Everyone in my family raved about it. I'll definitely be making it again.

I omitted the oil in the dressing and added dijon; also had some dijonnaise on the side for the potatoes. It's very good but not the most amazing showcase for okra, and is less appealing as leftovers.

Delicious! This will be a recipe I make again and again. I used frozen edamame (shelled), mini fresh okra and frozen white shoe peg corn.

This recipe was very easy to make and tastes quite delicious!! I used canned corn, fresh shelled edamame from Trader Joe's and Russet potatoes and fresh okra.

I've made this every summer to rave reviews. Since fresh favas are usually over by okra season, I use lima beans.

I really wasn't impressed with this dish. It was ok, but I really didn't like the texture of all of these particular ingredients thrown together.

to answer a previous question...fresh fava beans are available between may and september. but, their high season is in july. you probably won't have any luck finding them this time of year. it's sad, i know.

this looks like a great recipe and I'd love to make it. Does anyone know where in Columbus, OH you can buy fresh fava beans. I've heard they exist yet I've search high and low with no luck. I'm beginging to think they are mythilogical.

I'd like to make this . . . how much okra?

Very good. Terrific taste. Must use very small okra, though, as the larger ones tend to be tough and don't cook evenly with the potatoes. I also think this salad tastes better warm (not hot) than cold or at room temperature.

Absolutely delicious. This recipe was a huge hit at a beach party recently. I used the frozen Edemame and it adds wonderful texture. No worries about keeping it cold and it is Vegen friendly. Served many more than 6 as a side dish. Will definately make this again.

This was simply fantastic. I used regular potatoes and cut them into pieces, and used edamame from the frozen section. We brought this to an outdoor theater performance, and everyone enjoyed it. It was easy to make, though the potatoes took a while. I will make this one again soon.
