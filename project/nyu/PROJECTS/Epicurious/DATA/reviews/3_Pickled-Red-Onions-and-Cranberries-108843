Went wonderfully with a smoked turkey. And made me look forward to eating leftovers!

I made this with four onions as that was all I had on hand. I used regular red wine vinegar mixed half/half with some sherry vinegar that had been steeped with red chilis. I thought it was good but too spicy hot so I added more cranberries. Next time I will use all red wine vinegar to keep it from being too spicy. It is a wonderful flavor sensation - first you taste pickled/sweet then the hot hits and grows.
