This was a spectacular main course for my Passover seder. A much enjoyed change for my family and guests...all with sophisticated palates. But, it's a fair amount of work. To make life easier on the night of the seder, I made the dish the night before. Following the advice of a previous reviewer, I cut the pockets in the chicken breasts and then seared the chicken breasts in a saute pan before I stuffed them. After they were stuffed, I put them in the roasting pan. I cooked both the stuffing and the chicken the night before, just under the full required time. I refrigerated them overnight and brought them to room temperature before the seder. While we were eating the first courses of the dinner, I cooked the chicken and stuffing again for about 10-15 minutes. The only thing left to do at the last minute was the sauce, which was pretty easy. It was delicious, and my guests raved about it. A few things I learned: the stuffing will need additional chicken broth, so make sure to have extra on hand; the spices called for in the recipe are not quite enough to cover the chicken, so make extra; and the extra day helps bring out the flavors better. For my main course, I served only the chicken, the stuffing, and some roasted asparagus. No need for any other carbs, and the asparagus works well with this recipe.

Made this tonight and incorporated a few modifications. Instead of Matzho, I used the "ak-mak" whole wheat sesame crackers. After all of the effort in stuffing the breasts, it's a little redundant to stuff the breasts with stuffing you are already serving the chicken with so I will definitely skip next time. My advice is the cook the stuffing 1/2 way through and then nestle the browned chicken breasts in the stuffing for the last 15 minutes. I used boneless/skinless breasts with the spices - much less fat. Goes well with asparagus. Kids liked a lot, told them it was an "indian style dish" and they thought that idea was cool - anything to add adventure. Since they love pistachios, I told them there were crackers, raisins and nuts inside so they pretty much accepted it all. You could probably get away with using only 1 egg - stuffing a bit eggy. Might try adding mushroom next time too...

THis turned out dry and bland, like eating cardboard. I gave it two stars only because I think I might have added a little too much matzo. But i don't really see how this could be good. It just had no flavor

I was surprised by how well the spices on the outside of the chicken breast paired with the matzo and red peppers - really nice combination. I definitely will be repeating that spice rub in the future...it was fantastic.

This is an very good alternative to brisket for a Passover seder. I sauteed the chicken breasts without the stuffing in them as suggested in other reviews. Then I stuffed them, refrigerated overnight and baked shortly before our meal. The separate baking dish of stuffing needed a lot of extra broth poured over it to keep it moist during baking. I added baby bella mushrooms and substituted vegetable broth to keep the dish vegetarian. Very good!

I forgot to mention that I served this with grilled asparagus and Veggies with Israeli Couscous. A good Pinot Grigio topped it off. The taste combo was perfect. Also served Turkish coffee pudding for dessert. All of these recipes are on epicurious.

I served this for weekend guests. Every man woman and child loved it! It will be in my recipe repetoire from now on. For a dinner party you could prepare this right up to the point that you sear it on the roasting pan. Truly excellent! And my Jewish houseguests can't wait to make it for Passover Seder.

Oh my awesomeness! This was a totally amazing dish and will be definitely going into the regular dinner rotation. I couldn't find the matzo that the recipe called for so I ended up breaking up regular Matzo crackers. I find they give the dish a really nice texture. I also found that it's easier to cut open the chicken breasts and toss them in the spice mixture before filling them with stuffing. It's a little less messy that way.

When I first made this recipe, I had to substitute Matzo meal, but it still came out wonderful. Now I just break up regular Matzo crackers for a more "rustic" stuffing. This recipe is absolutely wonderful and a huge hit at family meal on Sundays at my house.
