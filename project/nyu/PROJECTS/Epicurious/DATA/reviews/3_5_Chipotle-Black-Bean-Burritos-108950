I make this recipe all the time for Meatless Mondays. I usually add cooked rice and cream cheese, as per another black bean burrito recipe I found. I reduce the chili powder to about 1/2 a teaspoon, and I add cumin and a bit of lime juice. Like others, I never add feta. With these modifications, it's 4 forks. :)

i love this recipe! so quick and easy but delish. i think frozen corn is the most like fresh corn and i use fresh raw corn put in at the very end when available. I've tried a couple variations too -- williams sonoma sells potlatch seasoning that has chili power and other spices in it, it's so good in this dish, i use 2 tablespoons of it in place of the 1 tablespoon chili power. i also add a squeeze of fresh lime juice to the avocado salsa and a little bit of the green part of green onions sliced thin. fresh goat cheese also works well in place of feta. but the recipe is also great just as written, and again, so very easy and fast. i enjoy the leftovers without the tortilla and a fried egg on top. best vegetarian taco/burrito recipe i have going.

Prepared this for lunch today. It was a big hit. I used a whole can of corn instead of frozen corn, 1/2 tsp chilli powder and I added lettuce to the mix. The whole thing was used for 6 12-inch tortillas, no spills no fuss. Did not add feta cheese, used queso instead.

I make this all the time but have yet to use feta. It doesn't sound good to me - and I'm a Greek! I usually just use some sort of shredded cheese because my supermarket is lame and doesn't have queso blanco or whatever it's called.

Excellent! Tasty & easy to make!

This is good, but a previous reviewer is right: the beans fall out of the tortilla, and it is a big mess. I think I would use a smaller tortilla next time, both to try to solve the mess problem and because the filling fills two 10" tortillas very nicely with not much left over to fill the other two.

The tastes are good all together although I had to add salt and pepper. the beans fall easily out of the burrito. Next time I will add vegetarian refried beens to the black beans to see if they will stay together in the mix. I used shredded cheddar instead of feta cheese.

This is such a quick, easy, delicious, healthy meal. We love the contrasting flavors... smooth avocado, salty queso fresco, spicy salsa. I usually add a red bell pepper to stretch it out a bit more. And to make it even easier, I don't mix the topping, I just let everyone add what they like. This recipe has definitely entered our regular rotation, and we make it at least once every two weeks. Fantastic!

This is a great simple recipe featuring (mostly) readily available ingredients. I didn't have chipotle salsa on hand so added some chipotle tabasco to mild salsa. I made these as quesadillas (sandwiched filling between tortillas and grilled) - very good (cut into wedges which were easy to eat). Added a bit of grated cheddar just to be sure they stayed together (thought feta alone might not do the trick). Liked the guacamole. Served with an orange coleslaw also from this site. An excellent weeknight meal, but also good enough to serve to guests.

This is a great, quick, veggie weeknight meal. I often make a double batch. It's on a usual rotation at my house.

The avocado/cilantro mixture was very good, but the filling is just okay. This recipe is very easy to make and quick for a weeknight meal.

My 6 year old son calls this one of his favorite dinners. It's really good and you don't miss the meat. I make my own chili powder from ancho and chipotle powder, cumin and mexican oregano, and add the juice of half a lime. Definitely warm up tortillas on top of a burner. Yum!

My wife ate it straight up, but I had it with soy Monterey Jack. Srumptious!!

I added chopped chipotle and crushed red pepper to the cooked mixture because I really wanted a kick. My boyfriend liked it so much he ate 3 of the 4 servings. I recommend you try it!

This made for a quick, easy, deliciously healthy meal. The chipotle flavor wasn't quite smokey enough, so I will try a different salsa next time.

Great and easy. You don't notice that it is veggie. I'm almost sure to have the fixings on hand for surprise company.

A great change of pace for black beans! I couldn't find chipotle salsa in the store, so I bought bottled chipotle hot sauce and it came out great. The avacados are a MUST in this recipe.

Since first trying this recipe, I've been making it for a week night meal at least once a month. It's easy, healthy, and very good. Like most recipes, the quality of the ingredients makes a huge difference. I get fantastic results with Muir Glen Chipotle Salsa and Westbrae Black Beans. I also use Queso Fresco instead of feta.

I too added fresh lime juice to the black bean mixture and placed a dollop of sour cream inside the burritos. Heating the tortillas on the burner was a great idea. Next time I will add some chipotle pepper and adobo sauce to the bean mix as my salsa wasn't smokey enough. Two avocados are necessary. Yum and a perfect weeknight meal.

Wow - what a nice surprise. We're trying to eat healthier and tried this based on its reviews. It's tasty, filling, easy to make -- and good for you. I added some mexican oregano, garlic and a dash of chipotle powder, as well as some lime juice to the beans. The first time I made this I added shredded chicken, but it isn't needed at all, even for meat lovers. Yum! Quick and easy too -- good for after work. I don't know that it would serve 4 people though unless you made smallish burritos.

Holy Guacamole was this good. I like the simple suggestion of warming the tortillas on the burner. I waited until just smoking and it added a nice smokiness as well as attractive marks! An all-around winner served with rice and beans.

Awesome. This is a keeper. EASY and fantastic flavor. My daughter added chicken and loved it. Next time I'll use 2 avacados - one small one was not enough.

This was really a fast and tasty meal with lots of flavor. Our family loved it and I was able to work with my 3-year-old daughter to put together the whole thing with her. After eating it, she exclaimed, "I love 'abacados'!"
