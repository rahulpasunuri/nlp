As basically the last few reviewers have said: great way to use collard greens. I agree. Do it. Tasty, different flavor than traditional pesto. I would say add more garlic and cayenne.

Delicious and hearty. Nothing more was needed for the meal. I made it with fresh collards from my veg patch. I also added left over capers, about a tablespoon, which added a nice dimension. I will definitely make this again.

I've been waiting to make this for ages! Tonight I didn't have enough collards for the 1.5#'s, but I had some fresh arugula, so I added that -- two good hand-fulls -- when I blended everything, along with a good-hand full of walnuts, double the olives, and 1/4 of a preserved lemon. My husband doesn't like Balsamic, so I only put in about 1/2 what the recipe called for. I didn't add the water. I used quinoa pasta. There was about a cup left over, so I've covered it with olive oil and I hope it lasts for a bit. This was yummy and wonderful! I'm going to send the recipe to our local CSA -- without the suggestion for the preserved lemon, because that's really not a standard panty item -- because I know there are people who are flummoxed by collards.

Whoa -- this stuff is good! I will now look forward to the collard greens in my CSA box. Hats off to Danny Toma -- pure genius, sir!

Wow. What a great thing to make with Collard Greens! We also received some in our organic produce co-op, and I didn't know what to do with them. Found this, and it was a big hit with the family! Will make this again.

WOW. I have to admit I was skeptical at first but now I understand why this recipe gets such good reviews. This pesto is great - it has a delicate, smooth flavor to it. It's a bit creamy so I would probably not use it for a pasta, but it makes a wonderful and classy spread. Delicious!

What a creative recipe, offering another opportunity for me to surprise my Northwestern friends with the southern foods I grew up on and that they think they don't like. I have made this twice, once for a potluck Thanksgiving dinner on a skiing trip. I grew up on collards and love them, but know that some think they taste too strong so I was apprehensive about what my friends would think. They loved it! I serve it on toasted baguette slices. Like others, I did not add water and it turns out just fine. I also increased the amount of garlic and olives. Warning: it makes a large amount but keeps well in the refrigerator.

You really need to like collards to like this or any recipe with collards. I have now decided I hate collards. I was trying one last time to find a way to use these greens that I get in my produce pod. Yuck, terrible taste, any other greens would have been great in this recipe, not Collards!!

Doesn't taste like collard greens at all! It is a beautiful, thick green spread with an olivey-garlickly kick! I didn't fully drain the greens and didn't need any extra water. I also added walnuts based on a previous reviewer's recommendation and the texture was perfect. I served it with pasta, but I imagine it would be tasty on fish or chicken. Yum!

I believe this is the most tolerable way to eat collard greens--you almost can't taste the bitterness, and in fact the bitterness is a delicious complement to pasta. The olive-collard blend is delicious but I would not say that this recipe is fantastic or particularly memorable. My 14 year-old sister (who pretty much refuses to eat anything green) was told it was regular pesto. After a single remark ("This doesn't taste like regular pesto.") she continued to eat 2 servings. Served with lots of grated cheese and some red pepper, it's -pretty- good, but not great. Recommended if you're somewhat afraid of collard greens!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I exchanged the normal brine cured olives for ones stuffed with jalopenos to give it an extra kick. Also, I boiled garlic and olive oil with the collards- and they were even delicious by themselves.

Unusual balance of flavors, which I really liked. I'm guessing I had a pound of organic collards (a bunch) and I used 13 large Spanish olives, 3 small kalamatas, a clove of garlic and a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar. I cooked the collards 5 minutes. Following others suggestions I drained but did not press the greens and did not add water or oil. I used some feta and spread the pesto on a split baguette topped with a few strips of roasted red pepper. A tasty, unique and attractive sandwich.

It is minus zero (i.e. freezing) in Toronto, Canada. The kale and collards are doing great. Harvested the collards and made this recipe. I added a few walnuts and a lot of extra (organic hot spicy) garlic which I love. While listening to John Raulston Saul on the CBC radio on topic of ABORIGINALS AND NEW CANADIANS: THE MISSING CONVERSATION. I added some walnuts as suggested by one of the reviewers. I love pesto with fussili and accompanied with a wonderful Spanish pinot noir left over form Thanksgiving dinner. Perfection. A perfect vegetarian Canadian moment and a profoundly humane recipe. Thank you. Life is profound at moments like this. "We all eat from the great bowl".

This was a surprise and delicious. Another recipe for my CSA greens. Definite keeper.

Excellent! I used a mix of greens, mustard, turnip and collard, and wine instead of water.

Love the idea of adding olives - this sounds great! I've been taking advantage of our spring nettles, making pesto with lightly cooked nettles - yum!! Will add olives to the next batch.

Wow - this was delicious, and so easy! I'm a garlic lover, so I'm always throwing in more than the recipe calls for. This was a bit of a mistake here, as it never gets cooked and mellowed. Still tasted fine, but I was careful not to breathe on strangers for a while afterwards!

I made this for Thanksgiving as a dip, and used the leftovers on pasta, and it was a hit both times! I used almond stuffed olives, since that's what I had available, and it was fine. As others have said, a great use of collard greens left in the bottom of the CSA box.

excellent. i used olives filled with garlic and it was delicious!

I loved loved loved this!!!! so good. Try to find olives that are not too salty. Note of advice though: if you are boiling pasta DON'T use the salted water, it becomes too too salty and does not taste good. Enjoy!

I left out the water and just didn't drain the collards as well, and used twice as much garlic and added walnuts - delicious! This is now my favorite thing to use collards for.

I also had quite a few collards from my csa and was not overly excited until I found this recipe. It turned out great! I substituted asiago for parm and used green olives covered in olive oil and garlic from the olive bar at the grocer- yumm. I will def be making this again!

I replaced the olives with capers. But otherwise kept it the same. It was good. Not great, but pretty good. I had to do something with all the collards from my CSA share.

Great and very easy. I added an extra clove of garlic, which I will NOT do again. Btwn the cayenne and raw garlic, this recipe has plenty of kick without adding extra garlic.

As the ultimate time-crunched cook, I used olives pre-stuffed with garlic (we had an enormous Costco-sized jar in the fridge that I wanted to use up). Worked great. Also, I cut down the oil and still tasted fine.

I LOVE collard greens and was looking for a new way to make them. This was amazing! I have to admit there is not alot of collard green taste but them as a base for the green olives and garlic is perfect.

There is pesto. And then there is collard-olive pesto. Spicy, different. Cheaper, just as tasty...it just makes sense. This will definitely grace my pasta/bread/insert another food item sometime soon.

This combination wins! I used whole wheat pasta & feta, at the advice of the reviewer from Eugene. The whole wheat grounds the stong flavors & the feta freshens it up. A full scale of flavor! I couldn't imagine using parmesan for this. I thought I'd experiment & throw in some pancetta, though I can verify that it wasn't needed. Unbelievable impact for something so simple.

This is a great way to use collard greens if you have a lot in your garden. Tastes very healthy. I added more olives and a bit more balsamic vinegar for more flavor. It pairs well with whole wheat pasta and feta cheese.

Fabulous recipe, great way to use collards (cheaper to make than basil pesto). I layered this pesto with a blend of yogurt and cream cheese and served it with toasted baguette slices - people were skeptical when I told them what was in it, but once they tasted it, they loved it.

Excellent! We also joined a CSA and weren't sure what to do with collard greens. The olives and spices dominate the flavor of this delicous pesto substitute. We'll make it again.

I had the same collard dilemna: how to use what I got in my organic delivery box. I had to add extra vinegar, but once I did I LOVED this pesto. The texture was lovely and thick, and I added a big dollop of it to pasta, soup, etc. Always tasty!

A tasty alternative to greens flavored with pig meat. I also joined a CSA and have found myself inundated with greens of all kinds, and the family was getting tired of them just steamed and simply dressed. Added extra olives (actually olive tapenade from Trader Joe's) for a little extra zip.

I recently joined a CSA (Community Supported Agriculture), and I receive a box of organic produce once a week. I have now grown to love collard greens, and this recipe is terrific! I made two batches and the first was a little watery so I added bread crumbs. I left out the water and decreased the olive oil and the second batch was perfect.

The southern transplant Ladies of the Magnolia tested this recipe at our semi-annual gettogether in Seattle. The vote: with new recipes like this, the South Shall Rise Again! We doctored it up abit - added more garlic and spices than originally called for. Very good on fusilli pasta, would be awfully nice on a good piece of catfish or other white fish like halibut! Ya'll don't get frightened by the idea, it's really more like a good olivada than anything else.
