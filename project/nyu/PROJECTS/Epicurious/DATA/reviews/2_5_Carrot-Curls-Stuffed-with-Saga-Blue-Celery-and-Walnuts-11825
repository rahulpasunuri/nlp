My experience with this recipe is a variation I found elsewhere. Instead of carrot curls it called for cherry tomatoes, I opted to use giant globe grapes...WOW! What a combination. Savory, pungent bleu cheese paired with sweet, juicy grapes. The walnuts and celery add texture and balance. Prep is a bit tedious but I recommend a small serated tomato corer to scoop out the grape seeds. I have prepared this for parties I've catered as well as for friends and there are never any left. An explosion of flavor in a bite-size snack.

Nice idea, these flavors go great together and it's something to make in advance, but they just didn't go over at the last party...more effort than its worth to fill the curls...it could be modified so that the cheese is in a bowl to spread on diagonal carrot slices, or on crackers.
