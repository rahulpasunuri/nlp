This was the most unbelievably good thing I have eaten in a long time. I don't even know what else to say about it. I made it exactly like the recipe said, except I was a bit short on coconut milk and chicken broth, so made up the difference using vegetable broth. Yum!

Very good. I didn't add sweet potato, and used shrimp instead of chicken. I just sautéed the shrimp separately and added at the end. No need to Blanche the snow peas, either. Well received.

Rating: 3
Just made this, great comfort food! A couple tricks to make it faster- I cooked the sweet potato and chicken in the broth. Not sure why the recipe has the sp being cooked separately. Also, since snow peas were very expensive, I substituted baby spinach- no need for cooking, just put in the bottom of the bowl and pour hot broth over. I wasn't sure if yellow curry was the same as green curry- couldn't find yellow, but green seemed to work just fine! Also, I am a spice wimp, and this was spicy, even without the extra peppers. I'll tone it down next time.

I followed this with the only change being I used 2 cans of low fat coconut milk. And I must say that it really was not worth all the work. It was good but nothing else. It left me wanting more dumpling appetizers and less main course.

I made this curry tonight, subbing the sweet potato for an actual pumpking that I baked the curry inside of. The end results were amazing, scraping bits of pumpkin flesh with each bite of curry.

Well done! Nice flavors, definitely not bland; though I might turn down the spice by 1 Thai chile. Used lite coconut milk and Japanese sweet potatoes. Delicious!

A fantastic soup with a few tweaks needed. Couldn't find lemongrass but hardly missed it. I used an extra tablespoon of curry paste to kick up the curry flavor - definitely made a difference. And I substituted a cup and a half of stock for the second can of coconut milk to cut down on calories. It made the soup more brothy and brought out the curry flavor too. Finally, I substituted zucchini for sweet potato to cut down on the carbs (but still used noodles; maybe half of what was recommended). The chicken cooked in the broth is genius! I made this for my husband as he had a cold and he almost finished the whole pot. Not terribly time consuming, just need to work efficiently. Will definitely add to the repertoire.

Rating: 4
I love this soup! I made it pretty much to the recipe but only used half the noodles, also had to improvise a bit with the curry pastes/sauces I had around. Doing the chopping prep and making the broth one day, then finishing it up the next does help break up the work - but either way is worth it, plus it's a very pretty dish to serve.

Rating: 2
Expensive to purchase all of the ingredients and a huge time sink to chop/prep. I used red skin potatoes (not sweet potatoes) since I don't care for sweet potatoes. Next time, I might leave out the potatoes. I added a few sliced shiitakes and swapped snow peas for edamame. The broth smells so fragrant but was quite bland. I used 1 qt/4 c. chicken stock, but next time I'd use less.

Rating: 4
Broth is the best part - yum. I knew I was going to love it as soon as I got a whiff of the shallots, garlic, ginger, and lemongrass sauteeing away. Like many of the other reviewers, I used red curry paste because I didn't have yellow and it tasted great to me. Because I don't really like the taste of boiled chicken, I shredded a rotisserie chicken, which sped up the prep and cooking time. Next time I think I might try it with green beans or mushrooms. The sweet potatoes were a pleasant twist. The prep time isn't so monstrous if you divide it into two days: made the broth one night, threw everything together in 30 minutes the next night.

I liked this, but the flavor was not kicking as I thought it would. Next time I would not use as much coconut milk and up the chili paste, curry powder and ginger, and definitely add more salt!

I've had a hard time finding a thai coconut soup recipe that has the same punch you get from a restaurant....this one does it. I was a little more generous with the chile paste, but that's just how I like it. I also used red curry paste since I didn't have yellow. I don't agree with other reviewers who suggest cutting the chicken stock in half. You might cut it down by 1/2 to 2/3 cup, but it's a soup and so it needs to have a soup consistency so that it can work with the noodles. I'll definitely be making this again and playing around with difference veggies and proteins.

A bit of work, but the best homemade curry recipe I've been able to find.

Modified this to suit what I had on hand (ie - omit lemongrass, ginger, thai bird chiles - I noticed there was ginger and lemongrass in my Thai curry paste anyway.) and did it with udon noodles, tofu, sliced mushrooms and snow peas. Used half the chic broth per other's comments, garnished only with cilantro and this was FANTABULOUS!! I will make this again in many incarnations...!!

Rating: 4
Soooo good! Had to make a few adjustments for personal taste and what I had on hand. Don't care too much for snow peas, but I did have a bag of frozen veggies (baby corn, carrots, broccoli, and peas) that I threw in and LOVED. I wasn't paying enough attention and added 2 or 3 more times chili sauce than I should have... whoops. To combat all of that spice (I am a wuss...) I ended up stirring in about a 1/4 cup of peanut butter. AWESOME. With crumbled peanuts as garnish, I was able to convince my boyfriend I could make curry as good as he always gets when we go out.

Rating: 4
Wow. This soup was amazing! My family felt like they were in our favorite Thai restaurant. I did however make some changes. I cut the fish sauce in half and added equal parts Sriracha and roasted thai pepper paste....then I added more Sriracha at the end for a little more flavor. Also I used red curry paste and about 3/4 the curry powder. I sauteed the chicken first in some olive oil then added it to the soup. The lime is crucial here so each person used almost 3/4 a lime to a bowl. Yum!

Rating: 4
This is great. Worked the first time i made it! Only suggestions i would make is to either leave the lemon grass whole and pick it out later or run the broth through a food mill. The minced lemon grass never really gets soft. Maybe food process it? otherwise the flavors of this curry were amazing. So complex and just the right amount of heat.

Rating: 3
too much work for the results. i agree with the person who suggested less chicken stock. i'll cut it in half next time. also, the ginger and lemongrass were overpowered by the curry in my batch. i'll aim for a thicker and creamer broth in the future.

Excellent soup! A lot of prep but well worth it. To heat the noodles, I simply ran very hot water over them prior to putting them in the bowls. The soup is very hot, so next time I probably wouldn't even heat them before adding the liquid to the bowl. So delicious.

Rating: 4
Surprisingly simple, once you get the hang of the timing -- definitely a keeper. I doubled the meat and all veg (incl. shallots etc), added a cup of baby spinach and skipped the noodles. I agree with the previous reviewer that one should use the fish sauce sparingly - will probably skip it next time. Tip: use a micrograter instead of chopping the shallots/garlic/lemongrass/ginger -- it releases more flavor and cuts prep time in half.

2 hours of chopping and prep and this recipe is not a keeper. Spent a fortune on ingredients at the Asian market...soup was blaah in flavor.

Awesome! Definitely a keeper recipe. Fresh lemongrass, ginger, cilantro are essential to flavor deliciousness so don't skimp if you don't have to. I would recommend trying the base recipe once to figure our your preferred proportions of meat/tofu to veggies to noodles. Personal preferences: less noodles, more veggies, same meat. Mushrooms would be a great addition!

Was as wonderful as others said it would be. Made enough for my daughter, son and me for dinner and plenty to bring to the office the next day for lunch so be careful if you make the whole recipe. My daughter, who ordinarily does not care for curry, loved this soup and brought it for her school lunch today as well as having it last night. I left out the lemongrass (thought I had some at home but didn't) and some of the condiments but it was delicious anyway. I would add more chicken - I added 3 boneless thighs and it could have had more. The sweet potatoes were nice but not essential. Will make it again many times, I'm sure.

Rating: 4
So. Freaking. Good. Whole Foods and Freddy's were BOTH out of snow peas so I picked up some leetle haricot verts instead of said peas, blanching them for about 2 mins and adding to the noodle pile that I spooned the curried soupy goodness upon at the end. Like a few others, I also could not dig up yellow curry paste [all the neighborhood Asian markets were closed by the time I got around to shopping for this recipe]. The green stuff in the little glass jar from WF worked juuuuust fine. I also chucked in a cup or two of quartered cremini mushrooms about 5 minutes before adding the chicken. Skipped the red onions (HATE 'em raw) and did a little basil chiffonade over the cilantro/green onion/jalapeno/lime wedge scatter. Yum. While I believe most epicurious.com recipes to be an exercise in chopping and dicing tedium (this is no exception), for the first time in ages, this one was more than worth it. It was, in the words of an SNL skit that still makes me giggle: crazy-delicious. I bet it would be rad with shrimp too. Mmmm...so good!

Very good! The flavors are enhanced on the second day. We found the red onion to be too much and left them out on the second day. We did use green curry paste instead of yellow because that is what was available.

Rating: 3
this is a very good base recipe that can be altered in many ways. for example, i use 1 14 oz. can of coconut milk to 4 cups of broth. and the recipe calls for waaaay too much curry powder and too much fish sauce (it is potent stuff, i use 1 tablespoon). i just throw in any vegetables that i have in appropriate cooking-time intervals, and it turns out great every time! ALSO, this is very good with SOBA buckwheat noodles, which are a healthy and tasty alternative to the rice noodles.

Rating: 3
I liked this but thought that with all the ingredients in there it would have had more flavor. I used new potatoes instead of sweet, Mae Ploy yellow curry paste, substituted 1 coconut milk can for light and used a mix of sugar snap peas, edemame, and snow peas. I "blanched" the veggies and potatoes in the microwave and just put the 6 min cooked noodles and veggies in the serving bowl and ladled soup on top.

Absolutely incredible!!!! We hold a dinner "club" once a month and each month have a theme. This month's was world heat and I was in the mood for Thai food and came across this recipe. I've spent today emailing the recipe to all of the others who attended because it is sooooo good! The only thing I did differently was to use frozen, whole chicken breast which I added to the broth mixture and simmered for a few hours and then shredded. I prepared the whole thing the day before, and then tossed into a crockpot and reheated the night of the dinner. (I also waited to add the lemongrass until I put it in the crockpot so the taste was fresher.) This is a definite keeper and one I will make again and again!

Rating: 3
I thought this was good, but very similar to other curry soups and dishes I've made. Used the standard green grocery store curry I had in the fridge so maybe buying better, more authentic quality would help. There are other recipes that are less time consuming that taste similar. I also felt the red jalapeno as a topping was WAY too spicy. I tried to pick them out with my fingers, then made the mistake of rubbing my nose and watering eyes, and then my whole face was on fire! Not a good 1st impression, although leftovers w/out the jalapeno have been nice. Good with brown rice too.

Has anyone tried making this all in one pot? By that I mean--instead of doing a separate pot of "boiling salted water" and the whole ice-bath step, would it work to simply add these things at the end, in the order of cooking-time length? Seems like a time-consuming extra step if you don't care about making parts of this ahead of time. Also, shrimp instead of chicken would cook faster also... Thoughts?

I used only one can of coconut milk, and this was still far too rich for me. It was more like a curry than a soup. Next time I will try light coconut milk. I didnt have low sodium chicken broth, so I used the regular kind. This was a big mistake; it was too salty. I added extra veggies at the very end and served it with crunchy bean sprouts. The flavors were really wonderful. Highly recommended!

I love this recipe and I swear that it's why I haven't gotten a cold all winter! I've made it several times with different variations. I've tried it with chicken breast and light coconut broth and it wasn't quite as good as the original but definitely healthier. I've also begun substituting green beans instead of snow peas because I just like them better. Either way the flavors in this dish are phenomenal.

This recipie was a HUGE hit in my house, and I made it two times already not counting leftovers (it makes a lot). I substituted green curry paste for the yellow, used chicken breast instead of thighs, used buckwheat noodles and left out the sweet potato (increased the chicken and noodles instead). I kept the leftover broth separate without the other ingredients and it was perfect for another meal by adding the noodles, snow peas and garnishes made fresh. This is a keeper for sure and I will be making it again, and again, and again....

This soup has become a staple once a week meal because it satisfies all my taste buds in a bowl. I am wheat and dairy intolerant, so this is a perfect creamy, spicy, crunchy, satisfying soup and I don't even bother adding the raw garnishes at the end because it is just so good on its own. Even though the Thai basil sounds like it would be perfect as a garnish, so that will be next week. Try this soup if you like really spicy or just cut the spice amounts to less than half.

Rating: 0
Only subs I made were adding some kaffir lime leaves I happened to have and palm sugar for the regular sugar, otherwise made it exactly. Absolutely wonderful. The spice was perfect. The type of yellow curry paste and powder you use makes a huge differance in how spicy. I used Mae Ploy curry paste and Penzeys sweet curry powder. It really helps develop the flavors if you cook the spices in the coconut cream until it starts to seperate. This is now a staple in our home! DELISH!

This soup is incredible and I think there's lots of room for improvisation. I tripled the amount of chicken, shallots and garlic; subbed red curry paste for the yellow and used only 1/2 the curry powder. I also used one can of regular and one can of lite coconut milk and added sliced mushrooms and thinly sliced red peppers. It was the perfect flavor and amount of heat. I had it with a friend for lunch and served it again for dinner. It has so many different flavors and is so vibrant, pretty and appetizing to look at. I greatly preferred this soup without the noodles and lots of chicken and vegetables. Even though I cut the noodles into small lengths, they are hard to eat, as they are so slippery. This is definitely a new staple and isn't so spicy as to offend people with the substitutions that I made of 1/2 the curry and red curry paste.

Don't be put off by the number of ingredients; this recipe is quick to make. I made it without the sweet potato and yellow curry paste (I was confused by this because Thai curry pastes are usually green or red). Anyway, it didn't matter - the soup was delicious - definitely a keeper!

first of all, this makes WAY more than 6 servings and i'm not talking teeny servings either. not that i'm complaining, because this soup is yummy! i followed the recipe but accidentally put in 2 tablespoons of the hot chili paste (instead of 1 tsp. oops!). i was worried that i had just ruined the soup so i added an extra cup of chicken broth and left out the thai chiles, but it was totally fine. in fact i actually added more chili paste to my bowl! i like spicy food, but this wasn't overwhelming spicy so don't be afraid to add a little extra chili paste. if you like soupier soup i would decrease the amount of noodles because it really thickened up in the fridge (and that was with an extra cup of broth too). overall a great recipe and i will definitely make it again!

This tasted great, but required a lot of prep work! I used green curry paste - it was quite hot - just like I like it! I also reduced the fat by using 1 can of coconut milk and one can of evaporated milk. It does make heaps - we're having leftovers tonight over brown rice - yum! Garnish is very pretty. the curried chicken coconut noodle soup on this site is also delicious, but easier to make.

I took it easy on the spicy stuff, based on the advice of other reviewers. I think I got the right balance. Besides, you can add the raw chilis to your own bowl to ramp up the heat if you want.

We really loved this soup! I made only a few changes: used red curry paste instead of yellow, added bamboo shoots to soup at the end. One thing I will do next time (and there will definitely be a "next time"!) is to cook the sweet potatoes a little less. Once added to the hot soup, they became a little mushy by the time the soup went into the bowls. Overall a really fantastic recipe!

I also used Green Curry paste and lemon grass from a tube. A tip on Lemon Grass however: I grind the stalks up finely into a powder in the food processor, pop it in a ziploc bag and toss it in the freezer. Keeps forever and you just take what you need. I also found that par boiling the snow peas is redundant. Toss raw pea pods in the bottom of the bowl and pour the boiling soup over them. By the time the soup is cool enough to eat, the pea pods are perfectly green and still crisp. Made this for a casual weeknight supper and my neighbor raved about it. We sniffled happily through all the spices!

To the cook from Toronto looking to soften lemongrass: I have had the same problem and disagree with the other reviewer who said it softens in cooking. I always bruised it with the back of a knife, then cut it into approx. 4-inch pieces, and tied it in cheesecloth. Doing it this way, you need twice as much as the recipe calls for since you discard it before serving. However, I recently found out from an Asian chef that using frozen lemongrass is the way to go. It comes already chopped so it is less stringy and supposedly just as flavorful. Hope this helps.

the most authentic tasting Thai chicken coconut soup recipe I've found...which is good news because I crave this stuff often. I used lemon zest in place of the lemongrass and subbed jasmine rice for the noodles. Also sliced a semi- frozen chicken breast really thin in place of the thighs--with good results. I cut the recipe roughly in half--enough to feed four with plenty of leftovers.

We loved this dish! I used red curry because I couldn't find yellow, but then added a bunch more curry powder.I also used jarred lemongrass, which works perfectly. The sweet potatoes are fantastic! I cut up the noodles once cooked, which worked like a charm. We will certainly eat this again and again!

We loved this dish. I used 'Nam Jai Brand' yellow curry which is quite mild but gives a beautiful colour. To make easier to eat, just cut noodles before placing into bowls - so they fit on large soup spoon. Lemon grass will soften so don't worry about the initial stringy tough texture when throwing into the pot as will soften. The yam and cilantro make this dish.

IF you like yellow curry I think you will be satisfied with this recipe. I upped the amount of yellow curry and sugar a bit, substituted basil for cilantro, otherwise kept the same. My family loves curries and loitered in the kitchen smelling the wonderful aroma, they couldn't wait for it to be done. Within a few minutes of sitting down, the mood grew quiet as everyone dealt with trying to eat this dish! I agree with other reviewers who said this was hard to eat. Everyone stopped eating and said they wished they just had this over rice. So I made a quick pot of jasmine rice and everyone was back to enjoying their meal. The sweet potatao and snow peas and red peppers and the vibrant colors made this dish a visual pleasure too. My family even said they would eat this dish without the chicken, the veg's were so good.

The soup was good although my family thought the lemon grass and ginger was overpowering. I did use the yellow curry paste as the red and green would have had more fire power.

This didn't quite do it for us. As others have indicated, there are way too many noodles involved. I used Thai Kitchen yellow curry paste, which may have contributed to the final product being WAY too hot (overpowered the wonderful other flavours). Same thing happened to me with their brand of red curry paste in the past. I have had much better luck with thai curry pastes that come in a plastic sachet (freezer) but didn't take the time to track that down this time. Might work better with the thai basil and other modifications suggested by reviewers, but I'm not sure that I will try it again. We live in an Asian food city and we have many more delicious options. I'll keep looking for just the right thai noodle soup recipe.

I've tried many soups that call for fresh lemongrass and know of no reliable way to soften it enough so that it is enjoyable to eat, even when removing the tough outer layer. The food processor leaves it stringy, and it's difficult if not impossible to bruise sufficiently with a chef's knife. Help!! Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

We loved this recipe. We added mushrooms and yellow peppers as suggested by other reviewers. We found lemongrass in jars in the oriental food section of our grocery store. We cut the fish sauce in half, due to personal preference. Since other reviewers said ther recipe made a lot, we only cooked the noodles we needed and added the soup to the noodles in individual bowels, so there were no soggy noodles with leftovers. Also, we were able to control the heat, since the chillis are added to each individual's bowel. This is a great recipe!

The flavor was excellent! I doubled the chicken, added 4 sliced mushrooms and 1/4 red bell pepper. I also used lite coconut milk and fresh basil instead of cilantro. Yellow curry paste is worth the trouble of finding it. I agree with the previous reviewer. It easily could serve 8. I wish I had seen her review before I made it. Next time I will make half the recipe. My husband and I will be eating it for several days.

This was delicious! I used green curry instead of yellow. I think the key is to use fresh lemongrass, not from a tube. Will try with shrimp, tofu or salmon next time.

I make Thai dishes a lot and this soup has become one of my favorites. Based on personal preference, I made just one substitutional: Thai basil instead of cilantro. The flavors are fantastic! I served it at a dinner party and guests literally slurped up every last drop of the broth. YUM!

I also used green curry as I could not find yellow curry. I did use fresh lemongrass which I found in the packaged herb section of the store. I found it a bit hard to eat, and would certainly cut the noodles before boiling them. And, I would add more vegetables. It was very spicy, which I love. Would love to learn how to make the broth a bit thicker for an alternative to a soup.

I was not as impressed with this as previous reviewers. I did make some substitutions, but since they were similar to the substitutions made by previous reviewers, I thought my feedback would still be useful to some. I used red curry instead of yellow, lite coconut milk, and lemongrass in a tube instead of fresh. The flavor was okay, but not fantastic.

This was excellent! Quite spicy but not too much for my partner or myself. Substituted lemongrass in a squeeze tube because I didn't have fresh, Thai green curry paste because I didn't have yellow,and for the coconut milk I substituted one of the cans with lite. Doubled the amount of chicken called for, and added some fresh chopped basil to the other fresh ingredients at the end. Just as good the second day. This is a keeper if you love spicy asian dishes!!! Thanks Bon Appetit for this "dish of the year"!

Made this for my family last night...absolutely delicious. I would not recommend this for small children unless they like it SPICY.

At the outset, I must confess that I altered it a bit: the husband abhors ginger, so I used just under 1 T to cut that flavor. Also, to add veggies and because I love them in anything curry, I sauteed slices of red pepper with the other aromatics and left them in the soup. Last, for health reasons, I used lite coconut milk. That being said, this was outstanding. All of the flavors of my favorite Thai green curry were there. I imagine that with full coconut milk, it would be even more luxorious. I heartily recommend this. I also plan to make it again without using the separate pot of water for cooking. I'd love to cut the kitchen element down, because this would be great for a weeknight dinner.
