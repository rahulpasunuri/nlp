Made it once. Too sweet for my taste. Amazing potential though, so giving it 4 forks. Will definitely make again, just a bit less sugar for the syrup.

I had some green grapes that were going soft so I only made that part of the recipe and since I didn't have any lemon juice on hand, I really need to go shopping, I took a creative risk and threw a little dried basil in the mix. It came out beautifully! I will add the lemon juice the next time I make it just to see what I get but this thing can stand on its own two feet.

FABULOUS! A definite crowd pleaser that is easy to make (and you can substitute Sprite, 7-Up or Ginger ale for the muscat when serving this cool dessert to youngsters).
