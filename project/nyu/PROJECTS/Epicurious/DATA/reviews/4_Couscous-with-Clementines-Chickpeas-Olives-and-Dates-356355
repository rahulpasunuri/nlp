Had some issues with this one. First the vegetable peeler didn't work on the thin skin of my clementines so I used a microplane but I'm not sure there was enough flavor doing it this way. Next the chopped dates clumped when they hit the heat, so I'd recommend really sprinkling them while mixing. Didn't appreciate the olives, just another soft-textured addition that didn't complement the rest. Maybe toasted pine nuts instead of the olives and chickpeas would give a better effect?

oh and just to add- I followed the below users' advice and just grated the oranges and used the zest instead of chopping up the peel. ALSO used BLOOD ORANGES instead.

Absolutely phenomenal. Served as a side at a bbq. Vegan, vegetarian, and still delicious even for carnivores. Sweet, salty, great crunchy texture- but then the cooked chickpeas at a great creaminess. SUPER EASY TO THROW TOGETHER and DELISH!!!!! could not recommend more. Leftovers great for an easy lunch/dinner served over steamed greens. yum.

this dish is delicious. only change i made was to grate the clementine peel rather than cut it up into little pieces. and i couldnt find plain couscous in my grocery store, so i used seasoned-though i added seasoning pack at the end after first tasting. it is now mid-afternoon, and im going to have a very difficult time waiting until dinner time to eat this all up. i want it NOW. i also gave a taste to my husband to test for the right amount of salt and pepper. he also thought it was extremely good.

I liked this recipe but I have some changes that I would make to this recipe- the clementines didn't work for me- next time I'll drain a can of mandarin oranges and add a little lemon zest. I loved the dates but I think a few more would make it even better or I would add the same amount of dates and add raisins or currants. I liked the olives but next time I would also add some black olives for a little more color.

This is both easy and yummy. Just a really lovely side dish for many different dishes and I will absolutely make it again.

Really delicious combination of flavors. My kids don't like couscous and they inhaled this. I think it would be a great summer dish, too.

I doubled the clementines, and was happy how this turned out. The leftovers made a great lunch the next day, to which I added a can of tuna, steamed spinach and some grape tomatoes to make it a little more substantial.

I made this last night and it was a hit! No one in my family is a fan of couscous, but we all loved this dish and can't wait to make it again. I'm not a fan of olives, so I left them out. I saved some time by not removing all the pith from the clementines, and that didn't seem to be a problem. Next time I will save some work by just zesting the clemintines instead of peeling them and chopping the peel.

Tried this last night - peeling the clementines is tedious - I wound up using 1 instead of three peels and it was delicious. Make sure you cut the peel fairly small. I also used prunes instead of dates. I would make is again but might use pitted olives and grate the peel to save time.

This easy to make dish is awesome. Great flavor combination of sweet and salty. Didn't clean all the pith off the small clementine sections but no one seemed to care.
