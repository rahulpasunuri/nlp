These are very tasty and moist muffins. I added 1T wheat bran and 1T wheat germ so I increased the applesauce by 2T. I made these in the large muffin pan and it made 8. Bake at 375 degrees as others suggest. Use a combination of walnuts and pecans for a nice variety if you like both nuts. Enjoy!

I made this recipe twice. I used half the amount of sugar the first time based on what I read in the reviews. The muffins tasted fine, but they weren't sweet and there was little taste of apple. It was just a basic, bland, nut muffin. The second time, I used the correct amount of sugar and they are no better than the time before. Still bland, still no apple flavor (even though I used extra applesauce!).

Delicious and moist! This is a great base recipe for applesauce muffins. I modified it a bit: 1. I definitely recommend halving the sugar as many other reviewers do 2. I reduced butter to one stick 3. Increased baking powder to 2 teaspoons to get good rise 4. Added a handful of dried currants. I'm looking forward to playing with this recipe. It's a perfect base to throw in anything you'd like or have on hand.

I teach a weekly cooking class in my son's K/1 class, and the current academic unit is community. The class went to an apple farm a couple of weeks ago, and we turned the apples into applesauce. I was looking for something to do with the leftover applesauce, so we made these muffins for the local fire station (the community aspect). They turned out moist and delicious, although a little too sweet. We didn't have any problems with rising, but I do agree the cooking time is a little too long. We were using the school oven, so it probably runs a bit hot. Regardless, they were done at 17-18 minutes. Definitely a keeper! The only change I made is to add pumpkin pie spice to replace the cloves, etc because that's what I had on-hand. I thought the apple flavor came through very well, but our applesauce was very chunky. I will cut the sugar in half next time.

I made this exactly per the recipe, and the muffins got a little too brown/slightly burned. Also, they do not rise much, so be sure to fill the cups up all the way. I did add a little bit more cinnamon because they are not quite spiced enough for me.

These muffins were great! My three year-old daughter and I made them together, super easy and came out really tasty. I followed the recipe exactly, except used cinnamon applesauce (no added sugar) and raw sugar for the topping, which added a little more crunch. They were moist and had no problems with any burning on the bottoms. We brought them over to the grandparents for a treat and they were a huge hit!

Rating: 2
I made a batch of these yesterday and I was disappointed. Did anyone else have a problem with these ending up scorched black on their bottoms? I have to admit though that they tasted lovely once you tore the burnt bottoms off....I am going to try it again but at 375 degreees.

I made a healthier version of this recipe using: * 2 egg whites for each required egg * Ideal sugar substitute (used about 1/4c less than what it called for) * Fat free sour cream (or fat free yogurt--in either case a little less than what it calls for)in place of the butter * Increased the cinnamon and all spice slightly * Added one and a half scoops of designer whey protein I also used foil cupcake liners and sprayed a touch of non-stick spray in each one because the lack of fat makes them stick to the liners. The muffins still turned out moist and fluffy and were quite tasty.It is important to note that the sweetener used does not leave the same aftertaste as other sugar free sweeteners but this particular brand is the only one I will use.

Very good, moist muffins. Taste more spicy to me than applesauce taste, but still really liked them. The only note I have is it made too much batter for my 12 muffin cups. Had about 1/2 cup left of batter I didn't use.

I'm always searching for good muffin recipes and I was very impressed with this one. I also reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 c; I used 3/4 c whole wheat soft flour instead of all white flour. I also added some grated apply because I was slighly short of apple sauce. The muffins were delicious and they had a very light texture. They also froze very well.

Rating: 4
Confession: Got distracted and forgot the melted butter, and these still turned out very well, very moist, and froze fine. They also rose well, but I think I understand the problem: they need to go into the muffin tins immediately after stirring the wets and dries together since the applesauce and soda start reacting right away (my batter started growing on the spot). If you let the mixture sit for anytime at all it will go flat.

Rating: 2
Tasty to be sure. I tried the version updated by another user reducing butter to 6T and adding 1/3 cup more apple sauce. Cutting the brown sugar in half was spot on or they'd be too sweet for sure. Cooking of them was troublesome. I have new powder & soda and they didn't rise much leaving a dense muffin that didn't cook into anything "puffed" and after adding an additional 15 minutes (35 total) they became semi golden.

We had 5 huge jugs of applesauce to be used up, so we made a bunch of these muffins. I reduced the butter to just one stick, and reduced the oven temp to 375. They came out much better, but they were frustrating because there seemed to be no consistency with how the muffins came out of the oven. Some were dark and flat on top, others rose fine but were dark. Then some turnd out lighter and rose beautifully. I was using some dark nonstick pans, and a lighter metal regular pan. All the same batter, different results, and no consistency from two batches and one pan. Rather interesting! Regardless, they are delicious and worth every bite! Now, to find a way to reduce the fat with all that butter!

Wow - what happened? I made these muffins exactly as the recipe but did half and half with whole wheat flour. I did add some chopped apple. They did not rise! I know I live in Colorado but these were flat as pancakes? Any further suggestions. I did have to eat two to double check thetaste and loved them but no based on their looks! Pat in Denver

This is a brilliant recipe. I changed a few things though: - generous on the chopped walnuts, maybe over a cup - in place of tons of butter, I used 1/2 cup lowfat plain yogurt and 4 tb yogurt-based spread (Brumel & Brown) - added 1/2 c craisins - didn't have any nutmeg - used cinnamon applesauce because that's all I had, plus all the existing cinnamon - makes up for the nutmeg! Moist and delicious - I love these muffins! They are fresh out of the oven right now, and I'm about to have "just one more".

I have a gluten intolerance, so I substitute the flour for a gluten-free flour mix (from a mix of 1 cu. brown rice, 1 cu. white rice, 2/3 c. potato starch, 1/3 c. tapioca flour, 1 tsp xanthanum gum). I also added some gluten-free oatmeal for extra texture. I cut the butter down to just 1/2 cup and increased the applesauce by about 1/3 c. came out amazing!

Rating: 4
These are so tasty! I split the recipe and used 1/2c. whole wheat flour and 1/3c. oat bran, and they came out great! I also used a little less brown sugar since my apple sauce was very sweet. I also used Trader Joe's Spiced Chunky Apple Sauce which was delicious in there. I am a big cinnamon fan so these make a perfect light breakfast.

Delicious recipe. I made the following changes to the recipe and the results were great: 1c all purpose flour, 1/2c whole wheat flour, 6tbs butter, 2/3c sugar made from evaporate cane juice, 3/4c pecans, added 1 grated pink lady apple. Rather than bake in muffin tins I baked in a loaf pan for 45 minutes at 350 degrees. Yummy breakfast bread, just the right amount of sweetness.

Great muffins! Quick and easy and very moist. I was out of eggs so I substituted 1 banana, mashed, with a 1/2 tsp of baking powder and used 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice in place of the combination listed. Because of the banana, I didn't add the topping (too sweet) and added a few minutes to the cooking time. Fabulous and kid friendly!

Rating: 3
These were tasty. I also used grated fresh apple. Next time I will use half fresh apple and half applesauce. In lieu of the topping, I sprinkled low fat granola over the top before baking. Don't use the kind with raisins or they will burn. They were delicious with a suprising little crunch due to the granola!

Awesome recipe. I made it for playgroup today and really hit it out of the park for the kids. 2 big changes though: I omitted the nuts (some kids in the group have nut allergies.) I also made mini muffins so I reduced the heat to 375 and the cooking time to 14 minutes. Snackable and yummy!

These muffins weren't bad at all. I followed the advice of a few others and used only 5 Tbsp butter, between half and 2/3 c. brown sugar and I used half white flour and half whole wheat. I added flax seed for the health benefit. I also chopped up a granny smith apple and threw it into the batter right before pouring into the muffin cups. To the topping I added a little oatmeal for added texture and crunch. Deliciously moist and quite healthy....I would definitely make these again.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but the end result wasn't what I was hoping for. I made the changes listed by San Mateo (except for the flour and flax seed, which I didn't have), but there just wasn't anything remarkable about these muffins. I was expecting them to be more apple-y or cinnamon-y, but they were just kind of dull. I hope they work out better for future bakers!

Rating: 4
Follow the notes from the cook from San Mateo to the letter. I did everything she said (used half white and half whole wheat flour rather than a blend). The muffins were delicious, moist, and healthy. I figure this cook cut 100 unnecessary calories PER muffin. I am going to recommend these to my children's elementary school as a substitute for cakes at birthdays. San Mateo, how do I get your other recipes?

Yet another review for these muffins. The finely chopped apple is a must. I was careful to get unsweetened applesauce and used only half the topping and the muffins were not too sweet at all. I could probably have put more topping on. The nutmeg in the topping adds a nice note. I doubled the cinnamon and I used a bar of butter and 3 T extra applesauce and they were very moist. Cooked perfectly in 20 minutes. Didn't rise very much as noted elsewhere. Didn't add nuts because of allergies; fine without. I thought these were perfectly good muffins, they are in my recipe box and I'll be making them again.

I've made this recipe countless times and it's wonderful the way it is-adding a diced apple, that is. THe last time I did it, i used blueberries which was another good combination. a winner of a recipe!!

I made most of the changes that San Mateo cook made: 1/2 whole wheat flour, 1 tsp cinnamon, 3T flaxseed meal, 5T butter, 1/2 C sweet potato puree, 1/2 C brown sugar. I do think it could have used closer to the original 1C sugar - it resembled more of a bread than a muffin. Since I omitted the nuts, it was kinda plain which was good for the picky kid and fine for the other kid. Good basic recipe to build from.

I made these muffins without the nuts and they were delicious! I added Quaker oats to part of the batter and that made them even better! In the topping I also added oats and melted butter to make it more of a streusel and it added a nice crunch. I would also mix together some melted butter, oats, and a little sugar and pour into the muffin cups before pouring in the batter so that they have a little bit more of a crunch. Instead of nuts I would add finely chopped apples to the batter. These got rave reviews from their tasters! Overall, very yummy recipe!!!!

I made these using the changes suggested by the cook from San Mateo. They were pretty good, maybe a little too moist, not exceedingly sweet (which is good). Maybe some wheat germ or carrot added to the mix would give it more flavor. Once you take out so much sugar and butter ya gotta do something!

Outrageously good -- of course, I did make a few changes to make it more healthy. Substitute half the white flour with whole wheat flour, or use a whole wheat blend for all of the flour. Cut sugar down to 1/2 cup which is more than enough, add a grated apple (big holes on box grater - my four year old loves to do this part), cut butter down to 5 TBLSP. - you don't even miss it and you cannot even tell. Finally, add 2-3 heaping TBLSP. of ground flaxseed. I do keep the topping on to add a little crunch, but I do not use a lot of it - maybe 1/4 tsp. per muffin. You cannot bake for any longer than 20 min. Use your toothpick to check. These are absolutely delicious and moist and pretty damn healthy if you ask me. My four year old's pre-school teacher asked for the recipe when we brought them in for a treat for snack and told me that EVERY CHILD ate the muffins except for the one child who is allergic to wheat. They all loved them. I'm thinking instead of a grated apple, you could also use a grated zucchini. Anyhow, honestly this is a regular muffin in our house esp. in the fall and winter. Great for a sick friend who needs something warm and comforting and delicious;-)

I love this recipe. I've made it several times.........with my own tweaking. It's a delicious muffin that is not super sweet. I one time left off the topping. It needs a little of the topping if you want any sweetness. Also this last time I added orange zest (fresh). Don't do it. It is bitter. I also only use 1/3 cup of chopped raw pecans. Don't overpulse if using a mini processor. It will turn to powder. I always use the paper muffin holders inside each muffin pan. All in all the recipe is pretty fool proof. Don't overcook.

Excellent, moist muffins. Substituted 1/2 cup of flour with the same amount of whole wheat flour, added just 1/2 cup of butter and 3 tablespoons of sour cream.

The batter was sweet enough without more sugar on top.

I thought these were tasty and healthy, perhaps due to some changes: left out half of the sugar, replaced butter with applesauce, added chopped apple (essential for freshness!), doubled the spices and left off the topping, used whole wheat flour.

My kids love this recipe. It is incredibly moist and flavourful. I did make a few healthier substitutions however which don't seem to compromise the taste in any way - I used whole wheat flour, I added 1/4 bran and about the same amount of wheat germ,I cut down the butter/oil and added a bit more apple sauce, and I forwent the topping. I find the muffins are sweet enough, the topping is a little overkill in my opinion. We have made these muffins serveral times (mini muffins most often and they bake in about half the time) and are great for afterschool snacks and lunches. Highly recommend!

These were good. Very moist and the crunchy topping was yummy. My four year old daughter loved them. I agree with previous poster that these are great for kids.

I made them as indicated -- with all that BUTTER!!! -- but added one small shredded apple. Left out nuts because I didn't have them on hand. NEXT TIME, will add raisins to give them some texture. I'd like to find a way to make them a little less fat. These will do for my toddler son's lunch box.

These were great! I substituted whole wheat flour for half the all-purpose flour, and per other reviewers' suggestions, cut the butter to 5 Tbsp and the brown sugar to 1/2 cup (especially since I was using homemade applesauce, which was already sweetened). Also added 1/2 cup of golden raisins. I normally skip toppings, but this one was very good - especially since I'd cut the sugar in the muffins. Cooked perfectly in 17 minutes. I think the idea of using chunky applesauce or tossing in a chopped apple is great - will try that next time!

This was an excellent recipe. So easy and very tasty. I substituted a little less than 1/2 c. of Splenda for 1/2 of the brown sugar.

Everything was great with these substitutions, but I found about 17 minutes to be the perfect baking time.

I tried these muffins with pear-sauce and blackberries as another reviewer suggested. They were soft and fluffy and so delicious, I could hardly believe my taste-buds! Easily the most delicious muffins I've ever had. I used a little less butter and sugar and left out the topping. Next time, I think I'll reduce the spices somewhat, as they seem to mask the subtle flavour of the pear. And maybe I'll use ginger instead of cinnamon. Or I might just try these with applesauce and blackberry next - that sounds like a good combination too!

I replaced 1/4 cup of the butter with applesauce (changing the quantities to 1 1/4 c. applesauce, 7 Tbs. butter), replaced 1/2 c. of the flour with whole wheat flour, and used egg replacer instead of the eggs. The muffins turned out moist and enjoyable. I will increase the baking time a bit next time--21 minutes was not quite enough. One thing I really liked about this recipe was that the muffins puffed up nicely even though I used egg replacer (which usually makes muffins/cakes not rise as much as they would with real eggs).
