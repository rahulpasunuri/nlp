I'm not certain what I did wrong, but it came out rather bitter and seemed curdled rather than set up. I used frozen pineapple from TJ's, which I drained, since that's what I had on hand, and didn't think that it would make that much of a difference. The dairy was bought the same day so I don't think it was any of them. I'll try it again maybe in the next few months, but for now I can't rate it until I'm certain it wasn't an ingredient gone bad.

A staple in our house for the Jewish holidays, and I just made it for my son's grade-school ancestor luncheon (so it only goes back a few years). To cut fat, I use fat-free sour cream, 1/2 lb of 2% cottage cheese and 1 package of farmers cheese. I also use skim milk and a little bit less than a stick of butter. I made the full-fat version and this one side-by-side and no one could tell the difference. Oh, and definitely raisins instead of pineapple.

I know a good kugel when I taste it and this is it! However, we go with raisins, not pineapple. Don't be alarmed it looks like soup before you put it in the oven. Do be sure that you bake it long enough that it becomes golden around the edges and make sure it's set. Can be made one day ahead and reheated covered with foil in oven (not microwave).

The only change I made was to use pressed cottage cheese instead of small curd. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. Just like bubie made!!

I used non fat sour cream, low fat cottage cheese with pineapple mixed in, and a little less butter. Tasted great. Add raisins instead of the pineapple.

Just like my mom use to make! The biggest change I made was to omit the topping completely-no need for it. I added the cinnamon to the mix, however. I halved the butter and used all low fat dairy products. It is still rich and decadent.

I liked it, however, if you are going to use the right fruit, it tastes ALOT better with raisins. It is also alot more fun for the kids to eat!

This is the best of the Kugel recipes, I made all of them inclduing the ones where you don't have to pre-cook the noodles. You DO have to pre-cook them it tastes better that way

Used lowfat cottage cheese and sour cream for this recipe, and it came out perfectly. This was a great Rosh Hashana kugel that my family will be having every year!

Excellent. Our fussy grandchildren all love it. Can be served hot, lukewarm or cold. Fast and easy to make.

Delicious ... but I reduced the butter to only 4 tablespoons the 2nd time I made the Kugel.... the first time I prepared the recipe it was a little too greasy for me.

This is just... disgusting. A regrettable culinary choice at best.

WOW! I love easy, good and impressive all wrapped up in one. We just had this for breakfast with some maple turkey sausage and fresh fruit ...not "kosher" but really delicious together. I followed the recipe almost exactly ...substituted half and half for the milk and used canned, chunked apricots because I didn't have any pineapple. It was excellent and simple. I will surely save this to my "favorites" file.
