Very simple, and attractive on the plate. Be sure to thoroughly rinse and drain the capers before adding, so as not to overwhelm the subtle flavors. A clove of minced garlic might also be a good addition.

I thought the capers overwhelmed the other flavors in this dish. I think I'll roast my squash next time.
