This is my go-to pie dough recipe. It makes great flakey pie crust with buttery flavor. I don't like to mess with shortening, so this one works for me. For pies I add a TB of sugar, rather than a teaspoon. For quiches, I leave it out entirely. I also agree that this is not enough dough for a double pie crust. If I make a lattice crust, I make a 1/3 more dough. If I make a full double crust, I often double the recipe and use any leftovers for little extra baked treats.

I goose this recipe with 1/4 tsp cinnamon and the zest of an entire lemon. Pretty zingy!

This has become my standard pie crust, and consistently turns out well with an economy of ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly the first time and found the crust a bit too salty for my taste, so I now use only 1/2 tsp salt and a heaping tsp of sugar. Also, I wish this yielded a little bit more dough; when I roll out each disk until it is large enough for my 8-inch tin, it's quite thin. Still very delicious and easy, though!

This is a very easy crust. I'd actually give it 21/2 forks because it is really good but "delicious" is for better judges of pie crusts than me. I will make it again, ingredients are usually on hand. The dough was pretty salty to taste but fine after baking and for the blackberry pie i used it for.
