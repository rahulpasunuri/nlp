Dense, creamy, rich and wonderful. The crust is the yummiest I've had on a cheesecake for a long time. Couple of subs; didn't have cherry jam so I used raspberry,omitted the sliced almonds and used craisins in place of the dried cherries. Still turned out wonderfully cherry-flavoured. Would recommend this recipe to anyone - even if you don't like cheesecake or cherries - this is a winner.

I thought this was a very good cheesecake, although be forewarned that it is of the heavier, thicker variety. I made it with a gingersnap crust and the flavor went very well with the cherries. This was my first cheesecake and everyone liked it, but I did have a problem with the presentation - when I tried to cut it it all fell apart into a big mushy mess. What did I do wrong? Did I need to bake it longer, or whip the cheese mixture more or something? It was in the fridge for about 24 hours, which should have been plenty of time for it to set. The bit that is leftover is continuing to collapse and spread onto the pan. Any suggestions would be appreciated!

Taste-wise, I'll say 3 forks. Taking into account how little work this is to make raises the rating to 4 forks. I couldn't find frozen cherries for love or money (frozen berries of all kinds, frozen mango, frozen pineapple, frozen lychee, yes, but no frozen cherries), so I made a compote with fresh cherries, water, sugar, and kirsch, then added the rest of the topping ingredients as per the recipe. My first cooked cheesecake, and it was a winner. I used a 10" springform and cooked about 5- 10 minutes less.

Excellent cheesecake. This dessert has been a repeated request. It is easy to make. Prepare it the day before you need it.

The sauce and crust combo was outstanding. I hate overly sweet cherry "sauce" aka pie filling. This sauce is excellent and nothing like the pie filling that is sometimes passed off as an attempt at cherry sauce.

It was good, not great. Not creamy enough for me. I followed the directions exactly. I'm still on a search for the perfect creamy/heavy cheesecake. The cherry topping was good.

I'm not a fan of cheesecake at all, but continue to search for new recipes to appease those friends who love it. I've made this recipe several times now and it's been an incredible hit. I even love it! The presentation is beautiful and the flavors are beautifully layered. Wouldn't change a thing!

This cheesecake looks as good as it tastes--absolutely yummy! This was one of three desserts I made for a party and it got the most raves. Even those few who don't particularly like cheesecake admitted it might convert them.

I added 2/3 cup of sour cream to the filling, simply because I had it in the refrigerator and wanted to use it up. I also used a jar of sour cherries instead of frozen Bing cherries. I tried baking it the 10 extra minutes and it developed the crack in the middle. My oven must run unusually hot. But why do people make a to-do about the crack, especially if the cheesecake has topping? The finished cheesecake looked wonderful and tasted great--creamy but not mushy. One woman said it was well worth breaking her Adkins Diet for.

My fav cheesecake recipe on this site. I substituted Amaretto in the cherry topping and increased the almond flour in crust. Also reduced the amount of sugar in the cake. Had a hard time finding frozen cherries but it's worth the search. Recommend this recipe to anyone who's not into sweet but losts of punch.

A delicious, easy cheesecake, I used low fat cream cheese, it worked fine. I add a little ameretto, and whenI'm in a hurry, I used canned cherry pie filling for the topping, and add some ameretto to that

All our guests raved about this dish. I used a bit of amaretto instead of the almond extract. Only thing hard about this recipe: finding dried cherries & pitted bing cherries in fall (even in one of the agricultural centers of the US).

I made this for guests and they loved it -- all had seconds and one asked to take an extra piece home! The cheesecake was very creamy and not too heavy or dense, though its consistency might have been that way partly because I only had made it the same day as the party, and it hadn't chilled for more than 3-4 hours. Also, I had substitued vanilla for the almond extract, as I didn't have any on hand. It was delicious. For the topping, I could not find dried or frozen cherries. I used canned cherries and dried cranberries, and that worked very well.

a very easy cheesecake recipe. and the cherries were delicious. i skipped the dried cherries, and used a can of tart red cherries with juice instead. it worked perfectly. i would recommend adding more brandy to the cherries. also, the cheesecake needed 15 minutes less baking then the recipe instructed.

I have made this cheesecake many times...each with excellent results. I use Cherry Marnier...really makes it nice! ALWAYS rave reviews from guests. Definitely try this one if there are non-chocolate cheesecake lovers coming to your table.

EXCELLENT!!!! I did make one change: rather than plain brandy, I used cherry brandy. My husband, who is a cherry aficionado, has requested that I use this recipe every year on his birthday. Highest praise!

This made a better presentation that any other cheesecake I've made, it's really beautiful with all the glazed cherries on top. I thought the cake itself was just alright. Be careful not to over cook or it will be really dry.

This is a big hit at our house. Overall easy to prepare (if you can just find those dried cherries at your supermarket)

I made this recipe to take to a New Years party, and it was a huge hit. The cherry topping is absolutely incredible, and since I had some extra, I warmed it up the next morning and served it as a compote over pancakes. (YUM!!) The cheesecake itself was good - but not extraordinary. Next time, I would cut the lemon juice in half, as the flavor was just a little too dominant. Overall, a great recipe - and quite easy to prepare.

I made this cheesecake as one of my Thanksgiving desserts. It is very good and easy to prepare. I had to use canned cherry topping which I added brandy to since I could not find dried tart cherries or frozen Bing cherries anywhere. Exceptional taste and everyone loved it.
