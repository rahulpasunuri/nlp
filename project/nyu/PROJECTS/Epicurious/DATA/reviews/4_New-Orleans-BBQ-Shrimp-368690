Delicious flavor! Relatively easy to make, too (I am not an advanced cook). Made as directed, except cut the garlic and clam sauce by 2/3rds, and served over couscous as a main dish. With that, still had serious garlic/fish breath the next morning. Also the peppercorns were a bit too much of a mouthful when bitten into in the final dish. But that aside, an excellent shrimp dish I will make again!

I combined this recipe with the Spicy BBQ Shrimp recipe (basically added those ingredients from that recipe that weren't in this one) and paired it with cheddar cheese grits or cheddar cheese polenta, it was amazing. I double the recipe and feed about 15 people. They said it was the best shrimp and grits/polenta they had ever had.

I didn't have the clam juice but my family is picky about a fishy taste so left it out. Was fantastic and will definitely make it again. Thanks Neelys!

Everything about this recipe is flavorful, simple, and I appreciate the one-pot concept. However, pouring it into shallow dishes and dipping french bread was nice but it seemed like too much liquid. Perhaps next time I'll pour over dirty rice or grilled veggies.

This was our New Year's Day dinner. I left out the Tabasco sauce and peppercorns to suit my boyfriend but still found it to be very flavorful. I served it over coucous which soaked up the wonderful sauce. Best of all - I didn't overcook the shrimp!

Made exactly as written for New Year's Eve dinner with green chili and cheddar corn bread. Delicious! We thought the heat level was perfect. Served with a Viognier which complemented the dish perfectly. Will definately go into the rotation.

This is a great, easy recipe. I made my own cajun seasoning and backed off on the tabasco and it still had lots of flavor.
