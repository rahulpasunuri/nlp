Added cinnamon, nutmeg, a little ground cloves, and diced candied ginger. (Had to sub honey for maple syrup.) The ginger adds fantastic flavor, and the spices gave it a bit of a holiday feel. I think the orange juice caramel is what really made it though. Delicious!

The flavor of this was great, but mine didn't really set well so it never got hard. It stayed pretty gooey, but I just shoved it into the bottom of yogurt parfaits anyway. Several guests asked for the recipe, so it was a pretty big hit. I think the fresh OJ makes it taste great.

This is so good I can't stop eating it! I didn't have a silpat mat so I used two sheets of parchment and it worked just fine. I might experiment with other spices too.
