This was delicious, and the presentation was very attractive. I used a bag of frozen artichoke hearts and simmered them in the broth for just a few minutes, which was easier and cheaper but tasted great. Also, reduced butter to 1 Tbs. and added a bit of truffle oil to potatoes, which flavored them very nicely. Used a golden balsalmic because I thought the color and flavor would be better. Fantastic recipe for a special dinner!

I have made this 3 times and it is excellent. Life is short - use prepared artichoke hearts.

Thought this recipe was great, howver, I changed it somewhat-had it with salmon-which I recommend-used canned artichoke hearts-saved a lot of time and work-and had to add milk to the potatoes to make them creamy. Will definitely make again.

Easy and delicious. Can be presented beautifully on the plate as well. Needs a hearty bread to sop up some of the sauce and a veggie with some color to liven up the plate. No need to change the recipe, but almost any white fish with thick flake will be great with it.

This was excellent and very easy to make, particularly since I used canned artichoke hearts instead of fresh. I imagine the fresh artichokes cooked in broth would be superior, but I didn't have any available, so canned it was, and the dish was still delicious.

Spectacular taste and presentation. Used chilean bass. This is a definite keeper!

Wow, fantastic meal. Used fresh Halibut but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Wouldn't change a thing.

I agree with everyone--this is an amazing dish! We use fillets of freshly caught rock fish--Wow! and I found violetta (purple) artichokes today at the farmer's market. They were wonderful. I think the great artichoke broth would be killer with mussels---going to try that tomorrow!

prepared exactly as written and it turned out wonderfully. Everyone liked the fact that it had well balanced tastes and was a "complete meal" on its own. I still added crusty bread and a salad though. :)

Wow! My husband is still talking about how good this was. Easy to make, made the artichokes and potatoes earlier in the day - a keeper!

I've made this dish a couple of times now, and it is my favorite way to prepare any mild fish (couldn't find sea bream, but have used both halibut and sea bass). The artichokes and dressing really compliment the texture/flavor of the fish. Also, I tried this with frozen hearts, and it works fine, but the presentation isn't as nice. A fab dish for anyone who likes fish.

This was an outstanding dish. I made it with whitefish. The only problem I had was that the artichokes tended to fall apart when I was slicing them. Next time I won't cook them quite as tender and let them finish cooking in the pan.

Wow this is such a good recipe. The vinaigrete would be great on any fish. Start the artichoke broth mixture and then heat while prepping the artichokes. I left the stem on to have a better "handle" for ripping off all of the leaves and trimming the green parts off the heart then I trimmed the stem to about 1 inch because it was fresh not woody. I rarely use butter but I think it really makes the sauteed artichokes incredible. I cooked them 5 minutes and they were such a beautiful brown color and sooooo yummy. Much nicer than the picture. After making this once and being unsure it took longer now that I figured it out it's fairly simple and very gourmet. Now I want to see what everyone does with the aromatic artichoke broth that doesn't end up being used in the recipe. Mmmmm. This is a keeper.
