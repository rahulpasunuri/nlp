Easy and incredibly tasty dinner featuring fresh cherries and beautifully crisp chicken thighs. The recipe for the chicken, Perfect Pan Roasted Chicken Thighs is 100% correct...the directions produced crispy and juicy chicken thighs that were wonderful in the salad.

I didn't mention specifically, but the fatty chicken thighs were he revolting part of the recipe. :( sorry, sounded good, but not.

Really, this salad sounded great. It was disgusting on every front. Don't waste your time trashing your kitchen. Bad!

This salad was absolutely sensational! My husband said it was hands-down the best salad he had ever had, and we like our fancy, creative salads. Loved the chicken and would make that just by itself too. I modified the ingredient list slightly to use what I had in the house; I omitted the dill and radishes and chives, and used dries cranberries instead of cherries. I also added fresh peach, which complimented everything very well. For the croutons I used some leftover foccacia bread, and only fried it in a bit of reserved oil from the chicken so that they weren't overly fatty and greasy like other reviewers had complained about. Turned out delicious. Also, used seed style mustard instead of dijon, and only about 2 teaspoons of it. the dressing seemed perfect to us. Will for sure be making again, soon!

This is a great recipe when cherries are in season. However, if I make it next year, I'll use boneless chicken breasts, roasted and shredded in place of the fatty thighs. For sure I'll skip the chicken fat fried bread. This could be such a healthy recipe with a few changes. Maybe add toasted almonds in place of the crumbled chicken skin. Really, who eats fried chicken fat and skin?

I wasn't sure the cherries would be good in the salad and I'm so glad I didn't trust my instincts on this one. Yum! The only thing I'd change is the croutons..I drained on 4 layers of paper towels (2 on top 2 on bottom) and it STILL wasn't enough to cut the grease/fat (and I'm a fan of fat). Each bite of the croutons was like a disgusting squirt of grease and for me it kind of overshadowed allof the other deliciousness of the salad. I willmake this againfor sure but sans the grease nuggets.

Made this sans croutons and was still very good. The combination of dill and cherries was fresh and surprising. Perfect for a summer evening. I'd definitely make this again.

This was great and I will make it again. I did feel that 3 TB of Dijon was twice as much as what was needed. But this was very, very good.

What a wonderful salad! Cherries are really plentiful at the stores now so ever since my first time making it, this has been a weekly dinner salad. I just used regular croutons or homemade toasted bread and either chicken breast or one of those pre-cooked rotisserie chickens.

Yum! This was so good I made it twice in the same week! I feel I could review the salad and the chicken separately - while they go well together each can stand on their own. The salad was a delicious blend - I thought the dressing tasted so so on its own but on the salad, it was heaven. I wouldn't dream of doing it without the cherries though - they make it imho. I did however skip the radishes and chives but bet they would be a great addition. Followed the dressing recipe to the letter. Also, because we love goat cheese, I made the warm goat cheese with almonds (somewhere on this site for another salad) and it went well with it. The chicken - the best! I followed the directions exactly and was sure it would burn them or overcook them, but they were PERFECT. Can't believe it took me this long in life to find out how to cook perfect chicken thighs. And dh didn't want to do the croutons because it was just so unhealthy sounding, but he gobbled them up. They're fab, but not absolutely necessary imho. Also, I'm not speedy in the kitchen but it didn't take me forever to make this - I used bagged butter lettuce so that helped. A keeper and on my weekly menu with cherries in now!

Amazing!! This does take quite a bit of work/prep work. Mid cooking I said to my husband, "this salad better be worth it", and it was. Hands down one of the best salads I've ever had. Also, I used boneless skinless thighs sauteed in butter, Tony Cacheri's, garlic, and pepper; it turned out wonderful.

And I had the same experience as A Cook From SLC, UT -- I took almost 90 minutes to cook the chicken, render the fat, make the croutons, wash the greens, emulsify the dressing....it's all easy, but it's not quick! But really worth it, as it turns out. Delicious recipe that I am adding to my summer menu rotation.

Really good one-dish meal, and flexible ingredient-wise. Our local market had no cherries so I substituted organic strawberries. Peaches would be good, too. It's the chicken and the -mmmmm- the croutons that make it really yummy.

Absolutely scrumptious! While simple and inexpensive enough for a weeknight dinner, the combined flavors (savory, tart, sweet) lend to a complex yet, well balanced meal appropriate for entertaining. Loved the rustic cooking method of the chicken, rendered until all fat released and skin crisp then working by hand to remove bone releasing aromas and juice, giving a true appreciation for this underrated part of the chicken  white meat now pales in comparison. While the croutons are a decadent indulgence  pan fried until bread absorbs fat and brown bits  the slightly crushed cherries are perfect partners in this meal, alongside the refreshing, full bodied salad dressing. This is sure to become a favorite in your household!!

A lovely salad, fantastic dressing, and great way to cook chicken. I added greens from our garden: spinach, sorrel, and tsatsoi. I recommend halving the cherries so they distribute better in the salad. I also added roasted and salted pepitas. If you like cheese in your salad I bet you can add cubes of a mild white, like havarti. Problem: when I threw the pile of croutons into the pan with the fat, the ones on the bottom soaked the fat while the ones on top didn't get much. Perhaps the solution is to drizzle the croutons evenly with the fat first. Also, maybe I'm slow but it probably took me 2 hours to do all the washing, chopping, and cooking.

One of the most sinful salads I've ever had, and just delicious. The technique for cooking the chicken is definitely a keeper.

My compliments to the author of this recipe. This was a fantastic salad that I will definitely make again. I was forced to use dried cherries and that added a different tang I'm sure. Nevertheless, it was wonderful.

I have used epicurious for years w/o reviewing more than a handful of recipes. We made this tonight, and it is probably the best salad I have ever had. Unbelievable!

Wonderful! I used arugula instead of Butter lettuce, and genesis bread instead of rustic. It was so filling and rich.
