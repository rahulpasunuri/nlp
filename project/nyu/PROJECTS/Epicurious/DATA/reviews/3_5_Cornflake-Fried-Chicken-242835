I loved this. I am not big on "fried" foods and I have never made fried chicken before this. I used a cast iron skillet and special k (all I had as I didn't plan this dinner). I used Mrs. Dash original and salt and pepper on the crushed cereal. The first 2 pieces burned and were very salty. I reduced the oil temp to 325 and added 2 pieces at once to further reduce the temp. The next 2 took 15 minutes or so to cook but they were a perfect golden brown.Cool them on a wire rack (I used an old cake pan as a catch plate). The paper towel will cause them to be soggy. I also changed my oil after the first 4 pieces.

A surprisingly tasty fried chicken. I added chili powder seasoning to the cornflakes, and double-dipped and dredged for extra coating. I let the coated chicken sit for 10min to dry before frying to ensure the cornflakes stayed on. The breading was very crisp and light, although the dish could use more flavor. Will add more spices to the cornflakes next time.

great recipe when you're short on time and ingredients. i added a pinch of cayenne, paprika, as well as fresh thyme to spice up the flavor. i would recommend reducing the salt and seasoning if required after.

I thought the sweetness of the cornflakes was a delicious change. This was also super quick and easy to make. It will definitely be a standby recipe for times when I'm tired or short on time. I used grapeseed oil instead of veggie oil.

I added paprika and cayenne pepper to the egg mixture. I didn't have milk so I used a TB of mayo. Rather than fry the chicken I baked in in the oven on a wire rack over a jelly roll pan. I made a honey mustard sauce and it was a hit. A 'do over' as my family would say.

try double dipping for really crunchy coating.. dip in egg then flakes .. then egg again and flakes again.. then fry or bake.. i mix some finely chopped chillies in with the egg wash

Very versatile. Can add or remove seasonings to taste. For a fun kid's meal, use crushed Captain Crunch (original flavor), mac n cheese and broccoli spears (they have to have the little trees to go with it!)

For how simple and quick this is and because you get a simply lovely flavor from just the salt pepper and of course the cornflakes - it's an absolute winner. Served with mashed potatoes and steamed brocoli. If you use ziplock plastic bags for the pounding and then another for crushing the cornflakes, there's very little clean up. Delish!

For 1000+ calories you might as well go to kfc, and save yourself from the mess.

This is the meal my children requested each year before heading out to Trick or Treat. One year I didn't have corn flakes on hand so I subbed rice crispies instead..also a hit. But I did add Franks Hot Sauce to the wet ingredients for some added kick.

"fromscratch" said it exactly how I would have put it...good, but a little plain tasting. I actually did add some cayenne for a little kick. Next time I think I'll add in even more spices and bake it instead.

I like this recepi. The first time I served with sweet peas and mashed mandioquinha (similar of a potato but tastes different, much stronger). The second time I served with corn cream and rice (the way we do here), as a special dish for lunch time at the restaurant. Delicious.

Tasty, a little plain for my taste. I dipped my chicken in BBQ sauce & that was good. I'll make it again though I think, I'll try baking it & add some cayenne pepper, or just more S & P.

I totally agree msbuffalo. I've been making "fried" chicken this way for years. It's delish.

Cornflake chicken is a family favorite, but forget the 1/3 cup oil and bake the chicken breasts for healthy, tasty eating.
