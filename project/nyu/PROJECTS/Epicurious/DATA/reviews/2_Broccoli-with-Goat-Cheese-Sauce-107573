Ate it tonight and threw the rest out. Love goat cheese and love broccoli, but this sauce was a loser.

I made it for Easter. I had doubled the receipe but not the caynenne. 12 people for dinner and 12 people wanted the receipe. It also was good on the mashed potatoes and over the meat. Kinda like a spicy hollaindase sauce. I served the sauce warm and it also sat for an hour and 1/2 before we served it. It hink it helped blend the ingredients.

I love broccoli and I love goat cheese but not together. This was awful. Stick to cheddar.

What a waste of goat cheese! It was just sort of strange.

A great sauce for veggies...quick and easy...and just enough zing...used half the quantity of goat cheese and was still great...definitely a keeper!

It was a nice dipping sauce and worked well with broccoli. I used green pepper and celery sticks for the leftover sauce. But there was something a little too strong about it for it to become a favorite.

This is a delicious vegetarian alternative. It was enjoyed by the whole family.
