I agree as well that this recipe is bland and needs some tweaking. Also used fresh herbs (doubled the servings)and some mozzarella, which worked well. I may try again, using 1/2 the pasta and double the veggies.

I agree it is a tad bit bland, but once you add some more ingredients it is a keeper. I added sundried tomatoes, more fresh herbs, gruyere cheese - any type of meat would also be great.

This is the second time I have made this dish and it won't be the last. Everyone is so satisfied after eating it with a green salad. This time I didn't change a thing in the recipe. Last time I used broccoli instead of zucchini. Spinach may be the one I try next. Fabulous!!!!

I just made this for dinner and my family loved it! I didn't have everything on hand, so here's what I used instead: 2 packages of cooked Ramen noodles for the Angel Hair (kids loved that!), a can of drained tomatoes since I didn't have a fresh one handy, I used one large zucchini instead of two small ones and three large mushrooms instead of two. I just added the cooked pasta to the veggies right in the iron skillet after they were done cooking. I then poured the egg mixture on top and so used only 2 TBS of oil instead of 4 (by the way, I used 5 eggs instead of four, and a blend of parmesan and mozzarella cheese instead of all romano). I also used garlic-infused olive oil so I left out the garlic cloves. It turned out beautifully -- firm but still very moist. This one's a keeper!

One of my all time favorite recipes. The flavors of this dish are fantastic. Its easy to make and has a lovely presentation. Perfect for brunch.

This was good, but not great. I used garlic and, as a party appetizer, it was a bit much for some of the guests. Not the prettiest of presentations, but it does taste good. I'd probably look for better appetizer recipes in the future...

I must have done something wrong. This was on the dry side. More veggies and less pasta would have improved it.

This made a wonderful brunch dish. I doubled the recipe to serve 8. I used a large cast iron skillet to make it easy to go from burner to broiler.

I have now made this twice and am planning to serve it for an upcoming birthday party brunch. It was a hit with everyone, including the small children. The second time, I tossed in a few ounces of goat cheese with the hot pasta and it made the final result creamier and even more flavorful. I added parsley and the remaining chopped olive to the topping. This dish is a new favorite. It is also good reheated, or served cold. What could be easier?

I made this for a holiday brunch and even though i left it in the broiler too long, everyone loved it! Definitely a huge hit!

Good hot or cold. The original recipe is alittle bland so the second time I jazzed it up a bit with crumbled hot Italian sausage, and added pesto to the cooked spagetti before the egg/cheese mixture.

This was a great quick dish for a brunch gathering! I left out the onions and used kalamata olives instead of black olives- this gave the dish a great mediterranean flavor! I would highly recommend this dish. Everyone loved it.
