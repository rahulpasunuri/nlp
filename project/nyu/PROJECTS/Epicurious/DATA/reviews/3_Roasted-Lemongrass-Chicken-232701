This was fantastic! I had to cut the marinating time down, but the chicken still had really good flavor. Next time, I'd probably just marinate it overnight. I did think the recipe has too much fish sauce in it, and the remaining marinade was too fishy/salty for us to use as a sauce, so it was tossed. Overall, the chicken was moist & flavorful, and the rice went well with it. It's a repeat.

I took the advise of previous cooks and cut the oil in the marinade by half. Then I skimmed the finished sauce by spooning off the excess. I removed a 1/2 cup of fat. To finish the sauce I added only the water and lime juice, but I doubled the lime juice for some counter to the richness.

Interesting and tasty. Had to roast for about 45 minutes as the time listed on the recipe was no where near sufficient to reach appropriate safe temps for poultry

I forgot to mention in my previous review that I agree the oil is too much. I would use only about 2 TBS next time. I defatted the sauce and poured it over the finished dish which I served on the rice. I think this is a dish which deserves trying a second time with a few modifications.

I did like this recipe but it needed a tiny bit more kick. Next time I'll add more chili-garlic sauce - maybe 1/2 teaspoon and I'll pound the lemon grass before I chop it. I used a 375 temp. oven which I found too low. I'll do it in a 400 degree oven. The rice was very nice but I thought needed a tiny bit of salt and some fresh pepper. This is a lovely dish that just needs a bit more oomph.

This was very good dish. I would use about 1/2 as much oil in marinade the next time I make this...it was just a bit too oily. I didn't have any oyster sauce so I added just a bit of soy sauce. I did not find it too salty. Also, made with the suggested rice side dish, which was nice. However, next time I'll probably just do basmati or jasmine, and let the rice soak up flavor of nice sauce.

I agree this was way too salty. Has anyone ever really read the label on oyster sauce? 1 TBS alone has at least 600mg sodium in it -- and that's the low sodium version! Combine that with the other sauces and this is salt overkill. Overly saltly and greasy - I will never make again. There are better ways to use a whole chicken.

My kids LOVED this chicken, including my 4 year old who liked pretty much nothing unless it's mac and cheese. It's a great family dinner meal when made w/ the rice and a salad.

I do usually love these flavors but this wasn't exciting enough to say I'd do it again. Worth doing once though. Made with the yellow rice & this was a nice complement. Cooked at 375F and timing perfect.

Pretty good! I roasted at 375 & the timing came out just about right. Prepared with items on hand, so lemongrass became lemon zest, and it still turned out well. Did not find it too salty at all from the fish sauce, but I will cut down on the oil in the marinade next time.

My 4 children plus 1 friend LOVED this recipe!!!

I thought this was awful. WAY too salty.

This was pretty good, something different to do with chicken and to use up lemongrass (don't plant it if you don't like it a lot), but I didn't care for the dark undertone to the sauce flavor, I think from the oyster sauce. Next time I'll leave that out, maybe sub some seasoned rice vinegar or something to brighten up the flavor.

highly highly recommended. fast and easy. i only had about 10 minutes to marinade the chix and it still turned out great. awesome sauce. however, the recipe neglects to give specific oven temperature, and since one usually roasts at higher temperature, I cooked the dish in the 400-450 range. Now, granted my oven dial is old and tricky, and though I have a thermometer in there, I had trouble adjusting to the right temp while cooking. Owing to the confusion, the saucy goodness in the bottom of the pan suffered and got a little on the burned side. The sauce still came out ok and the chix was browned to yummy perfection, but I would like to know what temp to use.

We really enjoyed this recipe. An Asian twist on pan roasted chicken. The sauce can use some adjustment for personal tastes and is necessary over the rice for full flavor.

As a fan of Vietnamese cuisine, I found this easy with authentic flavor.Used boneless thighs,increased garlic and shallot. Easy way to prepare lemongrass is to slice thinly and mince in mini-chopper. I marinated thighs 3-4 hrs in fridge, browned and baked at 350 for about 30 min. Served with Yellow Rice--first lightly browned shallot and diced onion and garlic in a little oil, added Jasmine rice and sautéed as for pilaf. Steamed with 4 peeled and smashed chunks fresh turmeric, added chopped cilantro before serving. Very savory!

I LOVED this roasted chicken! The flavors were wonderful. I served it with the rice (delicious) and caramelized endive. My guests loved it!

I made this as a main course for a Thai dinner party last week along with the Jasmine Turmeric Rice and it was delicious. Used free-range boneless chicken breasts (with skin). Didn't realize there wasn't an oven temp indicator, but probably cooked it at 375 F. For a first course, I made the shrimp balls with chilli lime sauce, which I served with a bit of rocket salad and for dessert, the roasted plums with mango sorbet. One of my guests had never tasted Thai food and thought it was wonderful, but when I said she should try a Thai restaurant,she very kindly said it wouldn't be as beautifully cooked as mine!

This dish was very yummy! I really enjoyed the lemongrass flavor of it. It tasted great! I made this for my parents anniversary, who are from asia and they really liked the flavors. I did think it was weird that they didn't put the temp, I cooked mine at 375. Also, instead of having the extra sauce on the side, I just dumped it over the chicken at the end. Yummy!

A good recipe, but I tend to like my lemongrass pounded out in a morter and pestle along with the shallots, garlic, sugar and pepper. Really releases those flavors. I then added the oil and fish sauce and mixed. I baked at 350 degrees F for 20 minutes per pound and it came out perfect. As far as using left over lemongrass, it makes a wonderful hot tea when some is mixed with ginger. The left over chili-garlic sauce....this should be the hot kind that is ground chilis and not the syrupy kind. It is spicey and concentrated but makes a perfect addition to any stirfry just to add a little spice. Don't worry if you add too much. If something is too hot in asian cooking...just add sugar. The hot mellows out and the other flavors of the chilis come out beautifully.

This was a very good recipe - I think I cooked it at 400 (I didn't realize the temp wasn't in there until I started cooking - oops). It had a great blend of flavors - problem was that the ingredients aren't very common so I had no idea what to do with the leftover lemongrass or chili-garlic sauce. TIP - you absolutely must make the rice dish that accompanies this - it is so good with the sauce from the chicken. I could have feasted on the sauce and rice alone!

Haven't made it as yet but sounds GREAT! What temp. should it be cooked at? Please let me know so I can try it right away.

There is no mention of oven temperature in the recipe on-line or in the magazine. I'm marinating the chicken now and just noticed the omission - I'm hoping that 350F works!

This was good and my family liked it. I would make it again but it didn't have enough zing to make it a truly standout recipe.
