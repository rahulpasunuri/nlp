This was just okay. I don't think it was worth the effort of slicing the mushrooms. It was good but not better than adding a roasted head of garlic made the day before. Won't be making it again.

Delicious as written, but can easily be adapted. I used about half the butter called for and a little more milk, and added about a tablespoon of truffle oil. The truffle oil really puts it over the top.

Yummy! I made it with some dried mushrooms I was looking to try out. Even with that faux pas, it was still delish. I recommend this recipe highly.

Good, not spectacular. To give it some oomph, added some dried tarragon.

Easy to make and very tasty! Picky eaters enjoyed them.

Wow -- what a wonderful "twist" on an old standby. Simply delicious! Good enough to serve with a "fancy" dinner!

These were truly the most delicious potatoes I've ever eaten. Potato heaven! With an undercooked standing rib roast and a great bottle of wine, it was heaven on earth.

Tasted good, but I didn't think adding the mushrooms improved much on good old plain mashed potatoes.

These potatoes were delicious, however what kind of huge portions are served when 5 lbs. of potatoes are divided among 8 people?!

This was a yummy side and a nice change to gravy on top. They were perfect with a dash of salt and pepper.

Made this exactly as given. Absolutely perfect, quick & easy. Served with pancetta pork roast. Perfect combo. Heated up the leftovers the next day (in the microwave) and they were even more delicious. Guests loved this!

These mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious. I served as part of my Thanksgiving meal and they were appreciated by all. I boil the potatoes and sauteed the mushrooms the day before, then before serving heated the milk/butter and mashed the potatoes. At the last minute, I added the mushrooms (warmed up slightly in the microwave). I used 1/2 cup of fresh, sliced green onion. Fantastic!

beyond compare wonderful! i served this with prine rib with red wine sauce, and i dont know which was better---the potatoes or the expensive meat! i only added salt and pepper and a little garlic, oh, and a tiny bit of sour cream. i ALWAYS warm my milk before mashing---so creamy!

Perfect! Very easy too. Do not change a thing. I served with the Braised Short Rib w/ a Red Wine Gravy. My guests raved!

Didn't have crimini mushrooms on hand, so just used regular old mushrooms. It still turned out fine. Made a LOT, but didn't like the leftovers as much as the first go around.

This mashed potato recipe is a definite keeper. It makes a hit for both potato and non-potato lovers.

I would say this receipe would easily serve twice as many people if it is served as part of a roast dinner with veg. As an earlier review said, what's not to love about potatoes, mushrooms and butter? I used half and half (rather than milk). I also made both the potatoes and mushrooms in the morning. I chilled the mushrooms and gently reheated them before mixing them with the potatoes. I put the potates throgh a ricer once they had been cooked and then covered them and left them at room temperature until I was ready to serve. I reheated the potatoes, added the mushrooms and voila!

We are a family of great cooks! Our Christmas is a group effort. Everyone is assigned a dish to bring. This year we had prime rib and I needed to bring a potato dish. My mother had seen this recipe on your web-site and suggested it. It was amazing. I had to triple the batch to feed everyone and there weren't any left overs. The potatos were a big hit and everyone wanted the recipe!!!

Potatoes...good. Butter...good. Mushrooms...good. What's not to like about this? And to top it off, it's incredibly easy to make. Served with the roast pork loin w/ pancetta and fig jam for New Year's Eve dinner. Would definitely make again and will try with roasted garlic as suggested by previous reviewer.

Superb! The best mashed potatoes I've ever made. You really must top them with the standing rib roast zinfandel sauce. The only thing I added was a dash of cream of tartar. It really adds to greatness.

Served with herb crusted rack of lamb. Nice twist to mashed potatoes. Also mixed in some roasted garlic.

Great twist on and old dish, especially for mushroom lovers. I mashed some roasted garlic into the potatoes and it really worked well...most things do with more garlic!
