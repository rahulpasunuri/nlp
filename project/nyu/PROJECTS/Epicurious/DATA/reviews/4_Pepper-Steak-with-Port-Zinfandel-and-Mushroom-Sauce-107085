This was great! I used beef tenderloin and did not pound it for fear of angering the beef gods...but I sliced it thin enough so that the cooking time worked for medium rare. Also I threw some thyme into the mushrooms as they were sauteeing (about 1 T). Because I was making helf the recipe, I found that the wine/port/broth reduced really fast and I ended up adding heavy cream at the end... it was fantastic!

Wow! Quick, delicious and a crowd pleaser for all ages. Would also be great with crepes, burgers. I didn't cover so the mushrooms browned more.

Fabulous, especially with baby bellas. Agree with reviewer who said this goes well with the green citrus salad (with fennel and oranges).

Sauce was really tasty. Could only find baby bellas fresh but added some reconstituted porcini to add that meaty flavor. The steak still ended up pretty thick and took considerably more than 2 minutes per side. Preferred medium which would have taken longer than 10 per side. Steak was cold. Sad to have to "nuke" the stead as it was too bloody for everyone. Since I always like to read reviews for advice on sides, try the citrus green salad and roasted potatos with thyme.

The sauce is excellent!

Made this sauce with thicker beef tenderloin steaks that I seared on the stove and then finished in the oven while the sauce reduced, served them whole with the sauce over. It was very tasty indeed!

Absolutely tasty! I used about 2 additional tablespoons of butter for cooking the mushrooms, didn't hurt the taste at all.

This was delicious...I made this dish for the "meet the in-laws" dinner, and they were very impressed! I had Cabernet on hand, not Zinfandel, so I added a little extra pepper to compensate--it was wonderful, to say the least!

I made this sauce to go with steaks from Trader Joe's that are rolled up with spinach and cheese...very good.

Used small strip steaks and left them whole to serve. VERY intense flavors, so pair with light sides. We had salad with citrus vinaigrette, yukon gold potato blinis. Excellent!

This was a big hit with my husband. Used portobellos, and tawny port. Served with Smashed Yukon Gold potatoes from this site, and used the sauce on both, with luscious results.

This recipe was great. I used shittake and portobello mushrooms. I baked cut up potatoes with olive and rosemary as a side. My finacee loved it. Leftovers make wonderful sandwiches!

Excellent and easy to make. I used Tawny Port because that's what I had on hand.

My husband is allergic to dairy products so butter was out. I made it early so it could thicken (suggestion from another cook) but it was thick enough with the suggested time. The flavor "wasn't there" for me so I added salt & pepper and a 4" sprig of fresh Rosemary. I just let the Rosemary lay in the sauce until we were ready to eat. It really made a difference! We had it over filets and it was mighty tasty! Made my husband's birthday dinner special. Can't wait to try it again.

Flavorful and easy! Next time I'm going to make this with pork tenderloin - sliced into 1" medallions.

Made this recently with good results. I used 2 inch thick rib-eye instead of sirloin. This recipe makes a LOT of sauce for the amount of meat. I only made a half-batch of the sauce and there was still some left. Make sure and use some interesting mushrooms like shiitake and chanterelle.
