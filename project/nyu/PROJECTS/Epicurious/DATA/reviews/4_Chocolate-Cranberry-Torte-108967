This is an amazing chocolate torte! It is so chocolately, fudgey that it seems like it is flourless. I made this for Thanksgiving this year and everyone LOVED it! This will become one of my staples for an easy 'WOW' dessert.

Very rich and very pretty. time consuming but worth it if you are a chocolate lover. The "make ahead" steps definitely save time.

This is a decadent, uber-rich chocolate torte. However I would not make it again because an average party of 12 guests might only consume 1/2 of it. Imagine a chocolate truffle baked cake size - that's what this is. The texture and density is more like candy than cake. For a chocoholic it's great but not everybody loves chocolate that much and most were too full after Christmas dinner for something this dense even though everyone loved it. The sauce is the best part and really helps to temper the extreme richness of the chocolate. I did not double the sauce - guests were taking small slices & it was plenty. The Chambord is a delicious keynote in both the ganache and sauce. I baked mine in an 8" springform for 55 minutes and it was perfectly done.

Made this for Christmas dessert this & last year, and it was a hit both times. This year I had to use whole wheat flour (King Arthur Premium 100% Whole Wheat), and it came out fine. Takes a while due to the "resting" periods, but it's very easy to make. Rich, chocolaty and delicious - it's great for holidays or special occasions. (btw, the fresh cranberries are used in the sauce, as indicated at the beginning of the recipe ;))

I haven't finished making this yet, but I wanted to alert others to a potential "gotcha" in the recipe. Yes, I know, I know... READ the whole recipe, plan ahead, blah blah blah.. I usually do. BUT.. I got stung by the directions in the tort section where it says to simmer 3/4 cup of "cranberries" in Chambord; it didn't mention the word "dried" even though it does up in the ingredients section. Oh well... too late now; already added the whole fresh simmered cranberries to the tort batter and it's baking now. Wish me luck... sigh...

This is not difficult to make, and was a smash hit with everyone. I'm surprised that reviewers complained about the chocolate flavor - that is precisely what a chocolate torte is: an extremely dense, heavy, intense chocolate dessert. This recipe adds cranberry flavor via the sauce and bursts of cranberry flavor in the torte itself when you bite into one of the wine soaked dried cranberries added to the batter. However, cut small pieces, most people won't want to eat large portions of this because it is so rich. Definitely a must if you know any chocolate lovers!

Rating: 4
Wonderful, tastes like a flourless chocolate cake you would get in a restaurant. A little time consuming, and very, very rich, but if you love chocolate and want an impressive dessert for a party, this is it. Tastes wonderful with a rich red wine. A quick tip in the cold months-instead of rearranging my freezer, I put this out on the porch to harden the glaze.

this dessert is both beautiful and delicious. Its sure to impress. And its not that hard. I made it for my gourmet clubs Christmas dinner last year, and I was pretty proud of it. It brought so many oo-oos and ahs, and once cut, there were groans of pleasure

An incredibly rich and decadent torte. Serves far more than the recommended 8-10, small delicate slices are best. I've even used the recipe to make a non-dairy version as well as a Kosher for Passover Parve version not taking away from the taste or texture one bit. Chocolate glaze could easily be halved and still ice entire torte. Worth the time to make this impressive torte.

Ok, I tried it. It was just blah... almost like chocolate fudge, not really a cake. With so much chocolate, eggs, and butter and so little flour, it was just too dense. The flavor was lacking a little too - mostly just chocolate all around with no zing.

Can't wait to try it! It sounds (and looks) absolutely scrumptious. I'll bet substituting Chambord with a nice rich cranberry liquor (like Boggs) would produce an even more intense flavor for an ultimate cranberry experience!

I loved this recipe and not just the cranberry sauce, but the raspberry- ish ganache as well. Most people took too big of a piece though. Next time I will pre-cut smaller pieces for them.

I disagree with the last 3 reviews - I served it after an eclectic Christmas dinner, and it was loved by all. I made sure to cut very thin slices of the torte, and I only dribbled the sauce decoratively around the plate. Yes it was rich, and none of us had second helpings that night, but it was enjoyed for days afterwards by many. A very rich, complex, delicious dessert. I would definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
I fully agree with a Cook from New York: too dense and heavy to eat after a multi-course New Year's dinner. Tough delicious and very impressive looking, my guests couldn't even finish their thin slice... I also agree that the sauce makes the show. This is the only thing from this recipe that I will do again.

Rating: 2
This dessert was too rich and heavy to eat after consuming a rich, multi-course christmas dinner. I also think two layers of ganache is unnecessary and there is no need to freeze between applications unless the kitchen is hot. The real winner here is the cranberry sauce...truly delicious and would be great on ice cream or a lemon cake.

Honestly? Kind of a waste of 22 ounces of yummy chocolate. Sad to say...I found in dense (not a bad thing) and sort of tasteless...HOW that could have happened is beyond me...I followed the recipe to the letter. Oh, well, chalk one up to experience ... and to not taking a new recipe to a dinner party...fortunately we were all stuffed from the previous courses and didn't really miss the dessert. Oh, well. A rare occurance on this website for me.

WOW!! This is an incredibly rich dessert that is worthy of special occasions. Not difficult at all, but a little time consuming. Well worth the effort though. I agree with others, I would double the sauce, as small slices of this are enough.

I was a tiny bit disappointed w/this recipe in that my guests hardly touched it - more an indication that they were stuffed from a large Christmas Eve dinner than the worthiness of the cake. It is an incredibly rich, dense cake and probably isn't the best dessert after 7 courses. I would probably double the cranberry sauce since it wasn't enough to accompany the cake (and it does "make" the cake IMO).

Definitely worth the time! Although the recipe is a little time consuming, it is very easy and delicious. Like everyone else has said, It is very rich and serves more than 10 easily. I made this for a shower to rave reviews. Variations - left out the sauce and used fresh raspberries for decoration instead of dried cranberries and mit.

This came out absolutely beautifully, and the taste was amazing, but I won't make it again -- it was too rich for me and my Christmas dinner guests. Definitely serve with the sauce -- it's delish, and you need it to cut what I thought was the overwhelming chocolatey richness (oxymoron to some, I suppose). The frosting is out of this world -- I'd be anxious to put it on something where it could star. One note -- although others thought the glaze set too quickly, I waited hours and finally had to refrigerate it -- probably a Florida thing. . .

I RARELY give four forks, so this was amazing. Fairly easy to make and so rich and delicious (serve in slivers). Don't skip on the sauce though--it crowns the torte. Also, make a day in advance as the flavors really begin to meld after 24 hours.

This is absolutely delicious - like a giant truffle - and super easy to make. I cut about 1/4 cup sugar out of the cake itself as I don't like my desserts too sweet, and it was great. I've made a version of this using dried cherries instead of cranberries which is also very nice.

I have made this twice now. WARNING.... YOU MUST TRULY LOVE CHOCOLATE TO TRULY ENJOY THIS. IF YOU DONT LOVE THE FLAVOR OF DARK CHOCOLATE, DO NOT MAKE THIS.

SO DECADENT! I am a wannabe baker, and I took this recipe to my parents' house for a Wednesday-before-Thanksgiving experiment. It was our first adventure in melting chocolate. My mom and I followed the directions very carefully (I had studied them for days), and it turned out just gorgeous. We could hardly wait a day to try it. After a big meal, the 6 of us barely ate 1/4, but that was great because then we got to eat it for days! It was flat out amazing. And I can't believe we made it! It was restaurant quality. We'll definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
What a delicious dessert! I made it pretty much exactly as the recipe called for and it turned out perfectly. The frosting is one of the best i have ever tasted, I will definitely make that again to use on cupcakes. This torte was a little bit time consuming, but not very complicated to make. Next time I make it I will omit the dried cranberries and skip the sauce all together. The framboise in the frosting gives it a nice fruity touch that is plenty. It is very rich though and can definitely serve a crowd.

Has anyone made this torte using adjustments for high altitude? I live at 5,500 ft. and the first time I tried the recipe it fell. Mind you, it still tasted fabulous but it was pretty gooey in the middle and I'd like to get it right! Would rather not waste a lot of good chocolate in experimenting so if anyone has suggestions on where to adjust - please help! Seems like some of the normal altitude adjustments would not apply because it's not really a typical cake batter recipe. I'd like to make this in 2 weeks for an event where it really needs to LOOK good as well as taste incredible (which it certainly does). Thanks in advance!

I substituted Grand Marnier for the raspberry liquer and used orange flavored cranberries, as well. The rich orange chocolate taste was heavenly - rec'd rave reviews from all my guests. One note, however, it says the cake feeds 8-10 ppl, but after a large meal during the holidays, 10 of us ate only half (with a glass of port, as suggested), and finished the rest a few nights later. It's SO rich - all you need is a wee slice.

I'm eating a leftover piece from New Year's dinner, and it is scrumptious still. To the cook from New York, I used half bittersweet/half semisweet chocolate in the glaze, and it was plenty sweet enough.

I made the recipe as written and thought it was easy and delicious. I made and strained the sauce, but left it home! The cake was great without it, and I delivered the sauce to my hostess who kept the leftovers. All in all, a great dessert to make in advance, espeically if you love chocolate.

With about a pound and a half of chocolate, this recipe is a chocoholic's dream. Contrary to some other reviewers, I liked the cranberry sauce, but didn't bother to strain the seeds as recommended. I served the cake on top of the sauce and a mint leaf for presentation, very pretty!

Rating: 4
Divine! Illustrious! Gorgeous, simple, delicious. The sauce is for the most part unnecessary. It's tasty, and beautiful, but doesn't need to be made fresh. So little is used, and for just a splash of color, purchased product here could definitely be used, or maybe just heated cranberry jelly? In any case, it was the most time-consuming, messiest, and least appreciated element of this dessert. I too didn't remember to even use it until after everyone had been served. Also, when I took this out of the oven, and then transferred to serving plate, and then iced, then sliced, I was certain it would be a brick! Only when I tasted did I realize I needn't fear. It serves in perfect wedges, and is just an incredible dessert. Very rich, indeed, but you don't need much. I'd say it could serve 18. It was delicious for 3 whole days.

Very pretty torte. I liked this one a lot, but not nearly as much as everyone in my family did. DON'T OVERBAKE THIS! Mine took longer than an hour, but I baked it until moist crumbs were clinging to the toothpick -- and I should have removed it from the oven when, as recipe directs, moist BATTER (not crumbs) was clinging to the tester. It should probably have baked about an hour and 15 minutes, but I baked it about an hour and 20 to 25 minutes -- just slightly too long. Very good, though, and very pretty. I served my sauce under the torte -- sauce on serving plate, then a slice of torte. Worked well.

Great recipe- easy to make and high on the wow factor for my guests. Almost forgot the sauce, so we drizzled it on top, but I think it would have worked well on the plate first with the slice of cake on top. Very pretty and festive too.

I halved the recipe to serve to 4 adults and have half the torte and no sauce left. Everyone thought it was delicious -- but something so rich goes a long way. I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter and thought the torte and sauce were easy to make and great (agree that sauce should be doubled). I had trouble with the glaze. It was thick -- never "pourable" (maybe cream got too hot?). I used bittersweet chocolate for everything and the bitter glaze (no sugar called for) really detracted from the torte. I don't like very sweet desserts, but this really could have used sugar in the glaze -- perhaps this explains the sauce disappearing. Also served it with blood orange sorbet which worked really well to balance the rich chocolate.

I made this a few years ago when it first came out and think of it every year. It's an elegant and unusual torte. I splurged and bought the chambord - it made the dessert extra special. It took awhile but came out perfect without too much effort. If you don't like chocolate, forget it, but if you do - this one's for you!

Very good. Very rich! Can serve more people because it's like eating a big piece of chocolate! the Chambord is lovely. I accidentally bought orange flavoured cranberry's which people noticed and actually liked. so if you made it with triple sec instead of chambord (like somebody else did) get the orange flavoured cranberries too. good stuff.

Simply divine! I chopped the dried cranberries that go in the cake, and that worked really well. A good store-bought berry sauce would work in place of making the sauce from scratch.

Could this be more perfect for your best friend's birthday party? Couldn't get Chambord and fresh mint leaves so I made it with Triple Sec and garnished with some curls of orange zest. Very pretty, very rich. Double the sauce. Nothing tricky about the preparation except maybe the glazing. (Glaze sets up much quicker than 2 hours.) I can't believe anyone would throw away leftovers! (Must be my German upbringing) Even if you find it to be too much after a big meal, keep it! It's one heck of a midnight snack!

I received an ovation when I brought this out for a Christmas dinner as part of the Chrismas menue on this site. It is very rich and dense. If you really, really like chocolate, you will like this. We had eight for dinner and there was lots left over because a sliver is enough to satisfy. I'd double the sauce next time as folks pured it on. My hat is off the professional chefs who prepare gourmet food every day. I worked three days on the meal. While every thing was delicious and not too difficult by themselves, I was exhousted after the dinner. I find running a marathon easier and it only takes four hours.

After reading RAVE reviews on this, I thought I was really going to wow my Christmas dinner guests. It was just too rich and heavy for after a big meal. It tasted great and the sauce is delicious - but way too heavy to eat after turkey dinner!

I just tried this for the 2nd time, but with several modifications to cut down on the richness and quantity. As the base cake recipe, I used the Chocolate Fallen Souffle Cake (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/109130) but reduced quantities: 7 oz bittersweet chocolate, 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup sugar, 3 separated eggs, 2 1/2 Tbsp flour. Then I stirred in 3 Tbsp Chambord and 1/2 cup dried (soaked) cranberries. I baked it in a 7" springform pan for 40 minutes. I did not use the chocolate glaze, but served it with whipped cream and the cranberry sauce. 6 people devoured the whole thing! I would make it the same way next time, although maybe I wouldn't bother separating the eggs (the cranberries keep it from puffing up so much anyway). I recommend this variation to those who thought the original recipe was too rich.

Rating: 2
It's been such a long time ago that I made this and there have been so many other recipes since this that I've made that this one just doesn't stand out in my memory. I recall it being very dense and rich. I would have liked the cranberries to have been in smaller pieces. Perhaps give them a whirl in the food processor. I didn't make the sauce to go with it.

Rating: 3
This was delicious but really rich. When served with the sauce and some whipped cream (which I recommend to balance the intense chocolate), it easily serves 14 people. Next time I might skip the glaze - I only used 2/3 of it anyway. I found it very easy to make, and even though I thought I had overbaked it, it was quite moist.

Rating: 4
This is definately A LOT of work, but worth it. Instead of the dried cranberries on the inside, I used frozen ones instead. It cut down the sweetness of the chocolate so it wouldn't be so overbearing. This is a very rich dessert...a sliver goes a long way.

This was a great dessert which provided a nice end to a Christmas Eve meal. I served it with a Banyuls (red dessert wine) which went very well with the rich chocolate of the torte.

Outstanding! This was extremely rich and the cranberry sauce offset it just right. I would double the sauce thought, we ran out about two thirds of the way through. I used Chambord, which made it very expensive... next time I'll try something cheaper and see if it makes a difference.

This is WONDERFUL! the combination of the chocolate and the tartness of the cranberry with the richness of the Chambord...Wonderful just the way it's stated.

As was stated after someone ate this" I think this is the best dessert I've ever had"! It is absolutely delicious and beautiful to look at, with the dried cranberries around the edge and mint leaves. A perfect special occasion dessert. I could have used a little more sauce, so I might double it next time. Also, I don't have a springform pan, so I lined a cake pan with foil and it worked perfectly well. I had to throw away some of the glaze because there was so much, even after I did a few layers. Try it - you will not be disappointed!!!

This torte was beyond compare! On more than one occasion I've been dissapointed by the end result of a recipe that received four stars but I'd give this 10 stars if I could! I found the recipe fairly easy to follow and made no adjustments with the exception of subbing raspberries for the sauce. I used E. Guittard chocolate (61% cacao) and the taste and texture of the torte were out of this world! Do use a palette spatula for the ganache which makes the glazing process much easier. I guarantee if you share this with friends or family they'll think you're a pro (or at least should be)! For me, this was the best Bon Appetit recipe I've ever made and I'm a 7 year subscriber.

UNREAL!!!! A (dense) slice of heaven. This is the best "decadent chocolate" recipe I have ever discovered. I have shared slices of this fantastic dessert with about a half dozen people, only one of whom thought it was "too rich/too chocolatey" (no such thing in our home!). The other five folks were blown away by this rich, flavorful dessert. I used full strength Scharfenberger bittersweet chocolate from Wm Sonoma and would not skimp on the Chambord, either. Well worth the cost and the hour plus it took to make it. ENJOY!

Usually I am a pie/tart person but thought to try this from how nice the picture was. It was amazing! People told me that I should sell it! I did not have Chambord so used Kirsch and a bit less than called for. I did not bother to strain the cranberry coulis but it was gorgeous spread out on the plate with the cake and whipped cream on top. Great stuff.

Rating: 3
I probably left the torte in the oven a bit too long; nonetheless, it was still moist enough and my guests seemed to enjoy it. I prepared the torte the day before and drizzled it with some chambord after it had cooled. The glaze took much less than 2 hours to cool, so keep an eye on it (obviously this depends on the temp in your kitchen). I found it helpful to put the glaze back on the burner for about 5 seconds if I found the glaze was getting too thick.

Ditto everyone else's comments about how jaw-droppingly delicious this is and about doubling the sauce.

I'm too cheap to buy Chambord, so I bought a different black raspberry liquer and it worked out fine.

I originally made this for a friends b-day this past March everyone loved it. My husband was jealous that I had never made anything so wonderful for his birthday. The only difference is I would have doubled the sauce because you really can serve more than 8-10 and you need the tartness of the sauce to cut the richness of the chocolate. This is the dessert to make if your looking for something special

I'm preparing to make this dessert again this year for my Christmas dinner. I made it last year and it was the most sophisticated dessert I've ever served. Very Rich and a little goes a long way, but what an ending to a holiday meal! Like others, I too will double the sauce. It's such a beautiful, clear red color and the fruity, tart flavor is an excellent contrast to the dense, dark chocolate. It's now a permanent part of my "special occasion" desserts.

This was the best cake I've ever made!!! I made it for my boyfriend on Valentine's Day but instead of the traditional circle shape, I chose a heart shaped pan and added fresh raspberries around the border for decoration. It looked beautiful and tasted amazing! I took some home to my family the next day and they agreed that it was rich and delicious.

I found this to be an expensive recipe to make. If I made it again I would probably make a basic brownie recipe with the dried cranberries added, and then use this glaze (which was worth using good bittersweet chocolate for). It looks lovely on a plate, but really needs a knife dipped in hot water to cut nice looking slices. VERY rich.

Amazing! This cake was rich, dense, and chocolately. I liked the addition of the macerated cranberries, and while I liked the recipe as is, I can see easy substitutions for fruit & alcohol in future attempts. Also, I didn't find it so labour intensive. A friend from Austria commented that this cake was "Viennese coffee-house worth". High praise indeed! I would certainly make this cake again.

I made this for Valentine's Day dinner, and my husband asked me to make it again the next weekend. It's so decadent in the richness of its ingredients that it will have to be a special occasion cake.

This is a wonderfully rich and decadent dessert! I made it for a friend's housewarming party and everyone, chocolate lover or not, raved about it. My only recommendation would be to double the amount of sauce you make. I found that there was not nearly enough to go around.

This really has more of a brownie texture to me than cake, but is delicious nonetheless. I'm not sure if I'll make it again only because of the amount of work involved and I wasn't 100% out-of-this-world-in-love with it.

I have made this torte twice. The first time was for New Year's Eve, and I made it following the recipe. The only change I made was after I accidently let the ganache set up and it was not pourable anymore. No problem... I just whipped it a little and spread it on the torte. This was so much less messy than pouring that I kept that technique for the second time I made this cake. This time I used dried tart cherries which I chopped and soaked in Kirch liquor (cherry brandy). I also used the Kirch in the ganache. This made for an excellent dessert for a Valentine's luncheon and got rave reviews! I actually prefer the cherries to the cranberries, but both ways are delicious! I had enough ganache leftover after spreading it on the torte to pipe a border around the top and bottom edges, and even some left for truffles! Yum! This was well worth the effort and I highly recommend it to any chocolate lover!

This has got to be one of the most wonderful things I have ever had the pleasure of eating. Wonderful texture in the cake...and all that chocolate balanced beautifully by the tartness of the sauce. Oh yes, and I used Kirsch, cherry flavored liquor, instead of the Chambord. I think any berry liquor would be worth trying.

The recipe recommends this for 8-10, but I'd say that it easily serves twelve, with portions generous enough to make them all happy. You can split the tort down the middle and fill with some of the cranberry sauce before icing for a more uniform distribution of cranberry flavor and a moister, more opulent cake. Another variation I've tried is halving the recipe (but still making slightly more than half a recipe of the glaze and sauce) and using a muffin tin to make six individual-size torts, which always makes people giggle like little girls before they are struck dumb by overwhelming chocolatiness. Baking is quicker this way, so you should monitor frequently for done-ness. This recipe is spectacular, follow the quantities and procedures closely. It's WAY easier the second time.

I made this dessert for this past Christmas dinner, along with a cheesecake. The cheesecake stayed uneaten; everyone chose the torte. Was it ever delicious! This has got to be the best chocolate dessert I've ever made by far, and I've made quite a few! I froze the little bit that was left, and it was still good as a leftover. Quite a bit of work (which I did the day before), but very much worth the effort!

The sauce was fabulous, as was the ganache. The cake however was too dry for my taste (despite being taken out when the tester was VERY moist). I suggest having some whipping cream on hand to serve with it. Also, If the cake puffs a little in the middle, trim it down, or the cake won't sit flush on the plate.

Heavenly. My icing didn't look *quite* like the one in the picture; it was a little uneven and it wasn't as shiny. I think I need a better spatula. One thing the recipe doesn't really tell you, and I didn't know b/c I'm a pretty novice baker, is how long you need to let the cake cool. That might help with the icing--I put it on while the cake was still a little warm. Now I know for next time. And there WILL be a next time. I can't wait to make it again!!

This torte is beyond compare. I have made it for a special occasion and for a personal chef gig for a client, to rave reviews. I have added it to my recipe box as I know I will be using it frequently. ( I even bought extra cranberries to freeze for the sauce!)

Made this cake and the egg nog trifle for New Years Eve Party. Every one went for the cake. Very chocolatey and very dense rich cake the chambord makes the cake and sauce.YUMMY!

A very intense torte for chocolate lovers. I might omit the cranberries from the cake itself and just use them on top and in the puree as I think I would like the texture better. LOVED IT!

I made this dessert for Christmas Day, garnished with cranberries and mint leaves to make little "holly berries" around the perimeter. Everyone loved it. The sauce is fantastic. I highly recommend this recipe. It makes a very impressive looking dessert and tastes incredible.

Wonderful dessert. Rich and sweet, perfectly balanced with the tartness of sauce. I also used black raspberry liquor and I chopped up the dried cranberries in the food processor b/c I don't like big chunks. Will make again!

I too was very proud of how this cake came out. I made it for my partner's birthday and he literally drooled over the cake each time I offered him a piece. The richness was appropriate for the season! I did use a black raspberry liqueur other than Chambord with excellent results. I would say that this cake could be sold at a bakery for real money!

I made this for a christmas dessert along with a Key Lime pie and the whole pie was left but almost all of the torte was gone. It was excellent!! The sauce was terrible though, i threw it out. Instead i made a pretty design on the plate with hersheys syrup and some people wanted ice cream. But it was excellent!

What a wonderful ending to a perfect Christmas Eve Dinner. Rick Rodgers hit it out of the park again with A Glitterering Christmas Dinner Bon Appetit 2003 December. We prepared the entire dinner menu beginning with the Pancetta, Leek, and Goat Cheese Tartlets and ending with this excellent dessert to finish this out of the world dinner. 20 guests I love his complete menus. Always rave reviews!!!

An EXCELLENT recipe. It was a perfect dessert. Although it did take a bit of time the first go around, I think it will be much faster the 2nd time around with familiarity. Next time we will probably make the sauce and torte the day before. It tasted absolutely delicious and is a very impressive dessert. We were expecting it to be very rich, but it was just right. Great recipe!

This was absolutely incredible! I was so proud and it was just beautiful! It was easy as well. I'll definitely make this again.

This was by far the best chocolate dessert I have ever made or tasted - and even better when I remembered the sauce! It was the midnight dessert at my New Year's Eve party, and after a couple of glasses of Champagne I completely forgot to serve the sauce with the cake. I ate the last remaining sliver a child had decided he didn't want (!) with the sauce the next morning - a breakfast I can highly recommend - with the sauce, and let me tell you, you CAN gild a lily! It was also relatively easy to prepare, and thanks to Trader Joe's pound-plus bittersweet chocolate bars (under $4.00!!!)not that expensive, either. I can't imagine how it could have tasted any better, even if I had gone for far more expensive chocolate like Valhrona, which is what I ordinarily would select for a high-end dessert. I alternated gold dragees with the cranberries around the edge for a simple yet very elegant presentation. 4-plus forks!!

What a decadent and captivating dessert! It was well worth the time involved. I followed the recipe exactly, and presented it with a similar finish, and had my Christmas guests salivating for hours! And the finish!!! But beware - only make this if you want your friends and family to insist on becoming the party pastry chef!

This was a fabulous dessert. I wouldn't change a thing. I made it for Christmas and the whole family adored it -- absolute decadence.

Time consuming but worth the effort! Substituted raspberry syrup for Chambord and tasted amazing; almost like chocolate covered cherries. . . yum!

We had some leftover cranberries...and WOW, what a treat. The torte is very rich in chocolate flavor. Kinda reminds me of those chocolate covered cherry candies.

Outstanding! Just the elegant presentation alone made my guests eagerly anticipate the dessert portion of our dinner, but tasting was truly believing! Followed the recipe exactly, using bittersweet chocolate and the Chambourd brand of the liqueur, and it was relatively easy, including the spreading of the glaze. This is a cake that can be made all year round for special occasions, so enjoy!

Wow - this was delicious and beautiful. We followed the recipe exactly, though the Chambord sauce was so good that guests asked for more and I wish we had doubled the amount.

Outstanding! Worth even calorie. Don't forget the sauce, as this makes it truly exceptional.

Excellent taste, but my first time making Ganache Glaze. I waited too long to put the glaze on. It was a little too thick and didn't come out smooth and working with it caused the glaze to become less shiny. I put the glazed torte back into the oven and watched it for several minutes till it regained its shine, but not melting too much. I can't wait to try it again. I might use dried cherries for Valentine's Day.

Very Good!! Torte seemed a little crusty around edges. The crust does soften after it chills. I wonder if reducing oven temp. to 325 and cooking longer would help? Also would a less costly raspberry liquor work as well in place of the Chambord.

Does anyone know if you could make this with raspberries instead of cranberries? I don't really like cranberries! Thank you for any help!

Good and not too tough. To the cook from New York - read the last line: Arrange fresh mint leaves between cranberries at top edge of torte. Cut into wedges and SERVE WITH SAUCE.

What am I missing here---how/where do you use the sauce?

Fantastic as everyone else says! One thought to the cook in Virginia. I don't know how your glaze came out, but normally with this type of glaze the more you work it the less shiny and smooth it becomes. My experience is put it on, smooth it ever-so-slightly with an offset pastry spatula and leave it alone. Just a suggestion for next time.

THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME MAKING A TORTE. IT WAS A VERY EASY RECIPE TO FOLLOW. IT TURNED OUT BEAUTIFUL! EVERYONE AT WORK LOVED IT! IT WAS RICH AND FLAVORFUL. I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN!

I made this for Thanksgiving and also loved it! I let the glaze stand overnight in the refrigerator to conserve time and then defrosted it briefly in the microwave to make it easily spreadable. The torte came out flawlessly and got rave reviews! I am planning to make it again for Christmas.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner. Was a huge hit with chocolate lovers all around. This was reminiscent of the flourless chocolate tortes I grew up eating in NY. Very rich, and the cranberry/Chambourd reduction tied it together. This was also easier than I thought. I shared leftovers with others, and they all raved-Definitely a keeper!!!!

My teenage daughter made this for Thanksgiving, and it was much more popular than the pies. It is very rich, and much of the flavor depends on the quality of the chocolate that is used. The dried cranberries gave the cake an interesting, slightly chewy texture that I found delightful but may not please people looking for a more traditional cake-like dessert. My daughter had a bit of trouble making the icing appear to be a flawless glaze, but it was attractive enough nonetheless.
