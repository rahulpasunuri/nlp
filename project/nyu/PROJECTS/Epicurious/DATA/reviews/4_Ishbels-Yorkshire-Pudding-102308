I followed the reviews and used 3 eggs and chilled it in the fridge first. I made them in a standard muffin pan and the recipe made just over 12. They were very tasty and moist, but not as flaky as my mom makes. More dense than I had expected, but I will still make it again.

Should've read the reviews in advance and made some modifications. As is, the recipe makes a yorkshire pudding that is just average. Used a muffin tin and made 6 mini puddings and puddings came out dense (after puffing up in the oven).

Very easy and delicious! Used 3 eggs and Crisco for fat. I was in a rush so the batter just sat for about 10 mins. while the fat was getting hot in the muffin pan and doesn't seem like the end result was affected. Can't wait to do it again!

It's a good recipe but needs salt and if you use butter... use a lot.

So simple, yet delicious. I made this with Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. My mother-in-law was very impressed with the results as it was my first attempt. I used a pie tin since that was all I had at the time of comparable size and it worked just fine.

This was my first time making Yorkshire Puddings and they came out beautifully! I too used 3 eggs and refrigerated for 1 hr prior. I made them in a muffin pan and they rose and kept most of their shape even when turned out. I probably used a bit too much butter in each muffin case but other than that would make no changes. Thank you Ishbel!

This was my first time making Yorkshire pudding, and it was perfect! After reading the reviews, here are the modifications I used: three eggs, chilled the batter for 30 minutes, used a combination of beef drippings and butter and baked them at 425 on the convection bake setting. Because I was using butter, I only pre-heated my 9x13 pan for 8 minutes. The batter puffed sky-high and my kids gobbled it up. I can't wait to make this again!

It was my husbands birthday and he wanted roast beef and yorkshire pudding.Well, I made boat anchors not light fluffy yorkshire pudding. Not sure where I went wrong. I took the advice from several reviews and added an extra egg as well as putting it in the refridgerator. Possibly the combo of both was a bad ide? It was easy and tasty. So I will try again.

This was the first time I ever attempted Yorkshire Pudding and it was wonderful. I used a combination of drippings from a standing rib roast and butter as the fat. My family loved it.

I made this to accompany a roast of beef for some British friends on Jan 9, 2009. Based on the other reviews, I used Crisco and 3 eggs, also refrigerating the batter for several hours before cooking. I was nervous that the cold batter combined with the hot Crisco in the baking dish would break the glass baking dish that I was using--it didn't!! Everyone commented that it tasted delicious and was authentic!! Thank you, Ishbel!! Peg

Excellent recipe. The only change I made was to chill the batter for 1 hr before cooking. The hot oil and the cold batter made the pudding taste just like my mom's. (Even she liked it)

This is an old family favorite, we always use 3 eggs, refrigerate and bake in a cast iron frying pan - perfect results every time - heat the pan to smoking before adding batter for perfect rise.

As suggested by the cook from the Isle of Wight, I also added an extra egg, and chilled the batter at least a half hour. This was the best Yorkie ever!

An instant family favorite. Serve with Prime Rib Roast with Red Wine Sauce. I double recipe, fill pop over pans 3/4 full and bake on 350 degrees in a convection oven for 20 minutes. You must refrigerate the batter at least an hour before makeing. DO NOT let stand to room temperature as recipe says. The hot fat is key for flavor. Oil will smoke. Add chives to batter for extra flavor. Serve hot from the oven. Doubled recipe yields 15 puddings.

I have been making Yorkshire puddings for my whole life and the best tip that I ever got was to use this recipe but add an extra egg. They will always rise impressively! They are crispy on the outside and custardy on the inside. This tip came from my Polish Aunt Jean to whom I thank.

Delectable. I used duck fat, and only about 2/3 cup of flour. Also chilled beforehand. Yorkshire pudding is glorified popovers, and chilled batter is a basic given. Don't know why the recipe calls for room temp. (I mean, Yorkshore isn't THAT far north, yuk yuk.) Hope my SO gets home soon, otherwise I fear I'll make myself ill eating all the pudding. Ahh....

I have fixed Yorkshire Pudding from a different recipe in the past and had good results. I did this recipe for guests on Christmas Day and it was a FLOP. When I checked this recipe against 2 others that I have used, I believe the main problem is the pan size 13x9. It was too big and the pudding didn't rise except right at the edges. Should have probably been the 11x7 size, which one of the older recipes called for. Yes, I served it anyway. Good friends, good fun

I've only had Yorkshire Pudding one other time when I was a kid, and for some reason, it was a lot tastier in my memory. Perhaps I did something wrong. I may try this recipe again, but I thought it was very heavy and didn't bake all the way. Not my favorite.

I've been making yorkshire pud for years using an old craig claiborne recipe and this one is even better. I chilled the batter as someone suggested and when I poured it into the pan with the fat (duck fat) it stopped about 2/3 of the way along the pan. I was worried that this would be a problem but it turned out fine!

Great recipe. Made them in muffin tins with drippings from the prime rib. I popped them in the oven just as I was serving the soup. They were ready just when we started the main course. Perfect timing. They must be right out of the oven.

Rating: 3
very good, and recipe is identical to one provided to me by a British cook. Veg. oil, though healthier, won't give any flavor, so a little pepper or some seasoning may help if you don't use meat fat. Regarding previous comments: I have read in several sources that it is best to refrigerate the batter until it is very cold--several hours. It is then placed into the hot pans with the hot fat--it should sizzle. If you want to test the fat being hot enough, try putting one DROP of water into it, but be careful, if it's hot enough, it will spit. I have also read that the oven should not be opened at all until near the very end--a sudden, even slight drop in temperature can stop the rising. Also, the 5 ounces of flour referred to is ounces by weight, not volume. A cup is volume, the alternative is measuring by weight. Many cooks prefer to weigh ingredients as it can be more accurate.

This recipe is so easy and wonderful. My husband is English and says this Yorkshire pudding is just as good as home.

Rating: 2
it was o.k, I like the toad in the hole suggestion - my husband would love that! To the cook who made 'yorkshire muffins' it may be the amount of flour used. If you used a "heaping cup" then the recipe is to blame for steering you wrong. 5 oz is a heaping 1/2 cup according to my calculations. (1/2 cup = 4oz)

Could someone tell me what I am doing wrong. Everytime I make yorkshire pudding they never rise. They taste all right but they are like little hockey pucks. I have tried leaving the batter at room temperature for two hours, mixing in a glass bowl, mixing in a plastic bowl, heating the oil at 500 degrees. Nothing ever works. Any suggestions!

Rating: 2
Before attempting this recipe, I read every single review. I followed the recipe to the letter and I used muffin tins rather than a baking dish. They came out with a muffin-like quality rather than the soft and puffy consistency I was expecting. Any thoughts on what may have happened?? They were delicious anyway and my British friend declared them to be "delicious Yorkshire muffins" so we had a happy ending!

Loved it,except I put the mixture in the fridge for half an hour instead.Try adding some browned sausages to the mixture before cooking- becomes "Toad-in-the-Hole", and serve it with lashings of Thick Gravy,Brussell Sprouts and Carrots. An old British favourite.

Very good and very easy recipe! It was just a bit bland, next time I might add some fresh herbs or spices to the batter to jazz it up a bit.

This was the first time I made a Yorkshire Pudding that turned out well. I also tried Delia Smith's recipe but that one turned out soggy and tasted like wet newspaper. This was in fact crispy, probably also due to the fact that I had followed the advice from the cook from Aurora who advised to put it in the fridge first for an hour. I served it with a beef steak with horseradish sauce and peas. Very good!

Rating: 4
Someone else mentioned this but it bears repeating in bold type. DON'T USE BUTTER TO BAKE THIS IN! Most cooks will recognize this error and not do it, but a novice might not yet know that butter will blacken and smoke very quickly at this extremely high temp. The recipe really should be edited. Also if you want to try a "veggie" version, I have made this successfully using Macadamia Nut oil, it can take the heat and has lovely flavor...also, add some chives.

Rating: 4
This worked brilliantly. For two of us, I halved the quantity and added 6 chipolota sausages (which I browned first) to make 'toad in the hole' and it was fantastic. I have always had trouble with Yorkshire pudding so I will be hanging on to this recipe for sure.

This is the best Yorkshire Pudding I have made. The only change is I cover the batter and put it in the fridge for the hour. The cold batter in the hot oil give the puddings a little extra crisp when they come out.

I have grown up with Yorkshire pudding and love it to bits!! It's nice to see that American's love it as well! Yorkshire pudding is great if you make it dinner plate sized and then load your "dinner" into it and pour in the gravy. We Brits love onion gravy (big chunks of onion work best). Now some history... Back in the old days Yorkshire pud was eaten with gravy before your dinner (when meat and money were in short supply).If you don't succeed first time with this recipe please keep trying... it's worth it!! Happy New Year!

I grew up on this stuff, my Mom made it every time we had leftover roast. This recipe most closely resembles James Beard?s. My copy has gotten frayed, so I came to Epicurious. The recipe requires a good amount of beef fat, and not all roasts have it. I had a good roast, with enough fat to make a good gravy and some fat leftover, so I tried this recipe, results were superb! Only mistake I made was to mix in some butter with the beef fat, it blackened in the oven, so that needs to be taken into consideration. It was still good, but next time I will use another type of ?fat?. Now I think I?ll go to a diet.com site.

I made these last night for the first time with a roast beef recipe also from epicurious, I was a little dissapointed as the puddings were bland. I also think I used too much fat. Next time I will try the herbed pudding recipe. I also think butter would be tastier.

Can't improve on this simple recipe for yorkshire puds, I never make a roast without them. One tip though - to prevent puddings collapsing as soon as they come out of the oven, try to avoid opening the oven door while they cook.

This receipe is virtually identical to the one my grandmother taught me many years ago. Only difference is she used 3 eggs. She also cooked it in a 9-10 inch cast iron pan. When the pudding was complete it was nice and fluffy, but collapsed shortly after taking out of the oven. When she taught me the receipe, and this happened I told her that it flopped, she told me to pay attention, she wanted it to flop. She then placed the beef gravy that we were having as well in the collapsed shell. Well we all ate and then got to have the pudding towards the end of dinner. To this day, I will not make a roast beef without my Grandmothers Yorkshire Pudding and this receipe rates just as high. If you have not tried this but are going to, you are in for a real treat. As a side note, if you cook this with butter instead of fat and serve with powdered sugar and lemon juice, you are in for a treat as well!!!!

Wow! Just great and sooooooo easy. I went the muffin tin route and they were so beautiful. I'll never make a roast without these again!! My prime rib didn't render enough fat in the roasting pan (because I cooked it at such a low temperature)so I cut a hunk of the fat from the roast and rendered it separately in a sauce pan. Next time I'll get a roast trimmed less severely.

This dish was FABULOUS. My family liked it so much that it was ALMOST GONE (4 tiny pcs. left) before I even got it to the table. I used butter, for the fat, and advise you to watch it carefully when you heat it in the dish. It says 10 to 15 minutes to heat it up but the first time I burned it, after 10, so I only did it for 8 minutes. I'll always make this with rib roast. What a find!!

I used butter, but the puddings turned out quite nicely. I should have run to the table though, because they fell pretty quickly. I used regular muffin tins and this recipe made 9 nice sized portions. I would definitely try this one again.

This was the first time I made Yorkshire Pudding and it was excellent! I followed the directions for large muffin tins and used butter.

I've made Yorkshire pudding many times, but never had it turned out so well as when I employed Ishbel's tips for preparing the batter. I was surprised to not see them included in the actual recipe as they are what has transformed my other recipes for it into gourmet treats. Ishbel had said on the TV show to stir the batter in one direction only, so as not to activate the gluten in the flour, and then to let the batter rest half an hour before baking. These tips are very important for best results. Sometimes when I braise pork shoulder butt in pineapple-orange juice with cinnamon and prunes, I will refrigerate the liquid till the fat solidifies on the top, and use it to prepare a "Porkshire Pudding", adding a 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 Tbs. each onion and garlic powder to the flour, continuing as directed. Individual ones are great with the pork and mashed turnip/potato or rutabaga/potato,and sauce placed inside!

Roast the beef on a raised rack and use the drippings for the melted fat in this recipe. It is especially delicious if you place the Yorkshire Pudding batter in a glass baking pan and bake it underneath the roast; or halfway through baking drizzle more meat drippings on the top.

The texture and taste of this pudding was great. I felt a 9x13 pan was too large, It didn't come out quite as thick as I like it. I make this often as a amin course with a good slightly thickened au jus, green salad and a glass of delicious red wine!

To 'A Cook from Hooterville" - possibly you are using oil and not animal fat. Oil doesn't work well as it doesn't get as hot as fat. Make sure you are using dripping (or some other animal fat) and heat it up until IT SMOKES before adding the batter. Good luck!

A keeper! Every year I make Yorkshire Pudding on Christmas Eve to go with the standing rib roast. I have always made the joy of cooking recipe, which takes all day, bringing the ingredients to room temperature, mixing, refrigerating, bringing back to room temp, etc. I decided to gamble on this recipe - I did not try it out before hand - and it was perfect. I had left over scrapings from a roast chicken which I used in the bottom of the pan. Next year, we will take the roast out and put it on a platter, pour off the grease and let the pudding cook in the roasting pan. It takes us 20 minutes to get the roast carved and plates served, and this way the pudding will be right out of the oven.

Ishbel! Where did I go wrong??? My puddings had right at the mass of a black hole! Heavy, leaden and, to be honest, they were almost too scary to place on the table. I did follow your directions explicitly ... seriously, I did! What is the secret? Or is this veddy British dish beyond a Yank's first attempt? Sigh. I'll keep trying.
