Brining definitely improved the chicken. I marinated as suggested by the cook from El Dorado Hills and brushed the remaining marinade on the chicken while cooking. I also used 3x the amount of fresh rosemary, more garlic, liquid smoke, 2 tsp. olive oil, and 2 Tbsp of Teriyaki Sauce I had on hand. I also used the honey jalapeno mustard made by The Scottsdale Mustard Company for 1/2 the mustard and honey. I checked the chicken w/ my meat thermometer and removed it from the grill at 170-180 degrees. It was excellent!!!! Served w/ Lemon Risotto and Avocado Mango Salad w/ Passion Fruit Vinaigrette (from this site).

I could tell that this recipe needed some adjustment after reading the reviews. Try this: (1) brine the chicken breasts for a few hours (2) remove from brine and rinse thoroughly, then marinate the chicken in half the marinade (with some wine and OJ added to it) for 4 hours (3) grill and brush the other half of the uncontaminated marinade on. The chicken turned out perfectly moist with full flavor.

Flavorful yet simple to prepare. Upped the amount of fresh rosemary to make flavor more pronounce. Used a "thick" soy sauce paste (available in asian market), and lots more garlic. Added a few drops of Liquid Smoke instead of using smoke chips and 2 teaspoons of olive oil to add moisture to the breast. I first marinated the chicken breast in the sauce then dipped them to coat each time I turned them on the grill. Would probably be good for pork tenderloin also. Served with steamed brocco-flower tossed with olive oil, sea salt, and fresh ground pepper.

I agree with the posted comments from the reader from Calgary below. Not remarkable, flavors didn't blend well. We tried it with company for the first time since we never miss with recipes from Bon Appetit, but we did this time!

This is one of our favorite grilled chicken recipes. The last time we made it, it was a little overcooked, but from experience we know when this is cooked properly, it is delicious.

This is our typical Tuesday night fare. Easy, delicious. It is better to marinate the chicken for a good bit of time. Highly recommended!

My husband thought the chicken 'wasn't bad' (which translates: 'not great'), and I could could see no merits to the meal whatsoever!! I should have gone with my gut reaction when reading over the ingredients, but all the reviews were so positive that I doubted myself! Plus my husband enjoys dishes on the sweeter side, so I had hoped that he would enjoy it even I didn't get too thrilled about it. We both thought the orange flavour was too overpowering, the soy sauce(even though I added more than it asked for) was barely noticeable, and all in all the flavours just didn't meld very well together.

Simple ingredients to use...though I didn't have honey dijon, I had each honey and dijon, so filled the 1/3 cup mostly with dijon and the rest with honey! Used pork chops, and put half of glaze in the freezer as another reviewer suggested. I used 3/4 of the second half as a marinade on 6 pork chops, and brushed on the other 1/4 while bbq-ing.....about 3-4 minutes per side, was delicious! My 5 year old son gobbled it up as well, and if the hubby doesn't get home, he might not have any food to eat when he gets here! LOL Thank you and God Bless

I've made this recipe several times it's especially nice for company.

I also marinated the chicken in the sauce for a few hours like other cooks did. I used 7 boneless breasts as well. My guests raved about the taste. My only issue was the orange flavor somehow tasted "fake" to me, but that could have been the brand of OJ I used.

Rather than just a grilling sauce, I use this as a marinade for boneless breasts. Guests love it.

This was so easy to prepare! Great to not have to use the stove or oven on hot summer days. I took the other reviewers advice and upped the hot sauce (just a little) and used some hot honey mustard as well as the dijon. I also used some of the glaze as a marinade (the recipe makes way too much glaze). Can't wait to try it on pork or ham!

This is a very simple dish to make -- took me less than 20 minutes to prepare everything. I used OJ instead of frozen concentrate and added additional hot sauce & hot mustard as others suggested. I used 1/2 the glaze as a marinade. I marinated the chicken while I prepared the rest of the dinner & then sauteed on the stove, basting with the remaining glaze. We loved it! Salmon would do nicely, too!

I used half as a marinade, and half as a baste. Instead of wine I used dry sherry, and instead of hot sauce, I used a teaspoon of ground chipotle chile (here in New Mexico we have a more intense definition of what "spicy" should be.) The results were great! My partner has insisted I make it again for a company dinner we'll be hosting next month!

I thought the sauce was too mild. Maybe hot honey mustard would work better. Or the additional of chopped jalapeno.

The chicken was absolutely delicious!. I marinated the chicken pieces in the orange sauce for about 1hr. I think this intensified the flavors. I served it with curry coucous and asparagas. I plan to use it next time with boneless pork chops.

This dish was easy to prepare and turned out juicy, tangy and delicious. We used some of the glaze as a marinade and still have enough left over to use next time.

We love this! I use it on skinless, boneless chicken breasts, and also pork tenderloin - excellent on both. It makes enough for 2 grillings, so try it with both! I also mix the glaze with some OJ and white wine for a marinade prior to grilling the meat. It is so easy to make and very, very good!

We baked our chicken in the oven instead of on the BBQ, at 350 degrees for just over an hour. I will add a bit more hot sauce next time as I like a bit more kick, but overall the flavor was pleasant, if mild. Also, the recipe makes enough to baste a thousand pieces of chicken, so next time I'll use some of the sauce as a marinade.

This dish was excellent. I was sceptical about how these ingredients would taste together, but it was great! Gives a very exotic flavour. I will definately pass this one along to everyone I know.

Delicious. I never need all that this glaze makes so I freeze it in lots for future use.
