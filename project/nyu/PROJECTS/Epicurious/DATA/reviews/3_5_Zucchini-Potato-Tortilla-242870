This was wonderful! I thought the method of preparation intensified the flavor of the few simple ingredients. It was a big hit. Our leftovers made a nice breakfast the next day. I changed/reduced a few things: 1 1/2# each of potatoes and zucchini, 1/4c oil total, and 6 eggs. I also finished in the oven as others recommended. There were still 12 side, or 6 generous main servings.

I was so excited to make this tortilla after enjoying similar in Spain. Normally I'm a pretty adept cook but this did not go well for me AT ALL. The flipping was disastrous in part because, at the suggested temperature, the tortilla wasn't cooked through in the middle and crumbled as I slid it onto the plate. It tasted OK-ish but it was not a pretty sight--would not try it again for guests.

It needs some more flavor. I added garlic and basil but it could have used some cubanelle or green chile or italian frying pepper or other pepper.

The recipe tastes authentic. It really reminds me of my favorite breakfast in Spain, potato tortilla between two slices of crusty bread. So good! I'd tries this before, but this is the closest I've gotten to the real taste. I add a bit of dried fennel during the frying of the potatoes.

This recipe was great, I served at a dinner party with a mexican theme. Everyone loved it and was asking to take some home with them. It fed 9 people easily and I enjoyed some for lunch the next day after sharing the leftovers with guests. I ended up cooking it in the oven for 15 minutes instead of flipping it. I was afraid it would be difficult to get out of the pan to flip it over, but I used a non-stick skillet and it came out beautifully when it was serving time. It was a little runny in the center so I will probably add a couple minutes to the cooking time next time I make it.

Although this is delicious, it is absolutely NOT Mexican cuisine and should be re-classified. It is a Spanish dish.

Very easy to make, I found tipping pan upside down easiest way to remove, then slipping back in to cook other side. Also easy to warm up in oven or in Microwave. Very firm, very tasty. I cooked without the Courgette. I think it would also keep a couple of days (this recipe is one huge Tortilla!)

This recipe is really good, but I was able to cut 15 minutes off the cooking time by eliminating the resting stage (the 15 minutes in between the time to cook each side). It was still delicious.

It's true that this is time-consuming, but you can do it in stages through the day. It was very good cold the next day.

I often make tortilla espanola so I was excited to see this variation with zucchini in it. It came out great! One change I would make is instead of flipping the tortilla, put the skillet in the oven at 400 degrees for 15 minutes after the first 15 minutes on the stove top. It saves time and the risk of losing the tortilla to the floor (which I have done before).

I cut the recipe in half, as I was serving a smaller group. I was very happy with the flavor and presentation of the dish, but be warned that this recipe is very time-consuming!
