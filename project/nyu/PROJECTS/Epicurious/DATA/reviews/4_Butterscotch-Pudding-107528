I just finished this recipe and the pudding is in the fridge chilling. I am pleased with the flavor of this recipe and the texture. I hope that it will thicken up nicely after 6 hours in the fridge. The only part of the recipe I struggled with was the caramel sauce. It hardened which made it difficult to get out of the pot. However, once I added it to the milk sauce and put it on a low simmer it melted into the sauce. I used a high end scotch and I think it added a lovely flavor to this pudding. I will make this again and the only change I will make is to keep the caramel sauce liquid.

This is EXCEPTIONAL. The flavor is fantastic. I doubled the recipe. I think that the banana slices were unnecessary. All else is perfect.

Fantastic! I followed it exactly, doubling the recipe, and it came out perfect. The best advice one reviewer gave is to read this recipe through a few times, and to then pre-measure everything. Once the sugar is cooked, everything goes fairly quickly and it's helpful to have everything ready to go if you're doing it yourself. I'm serving these for desert at a dinner party tonight and will top with a little bit of lightly sweetened whipped cream, maybe add a dash of scotch to the cream. I made them in custard cups and I think the presentation will be a big hit.

A very user friendly recipe. I made this for the first time and quadrupled the recipe for a friend's wedding. I had never made pudding before and it turned out well (took a long time tho'. Recently, tried again, just a single batch. Definitely some finessing required at the final simmer. Too little = looser consistency, too much = overly firm. I'll keep trying. Oh, I stuck the portions in the freezer for ~2 hours to chill b/c I didn't have 6 hours before serving. Worked well. Skipped the fruit & toffee. Got lots of compliments both times.

I just finished making this recipe for a friend who LOVES butterscotch pudding as a birthday present. It's not even finished cooling down, and it is MAGNIFICENT! I can't wait to taste it after the flavors develop more through the cooling process. I am a person that follows a recipe to the letter the first time I make anything. This time, I had to "fudge" a little because I had all the ingredients on hand EXCEPT for unsalted butter. I do taste a bit of saltiness in it because of that, however, it's not overwhelming. I can't wait to see my friend's face when he gets his present!

Excellent recipe. The trick is to premeasure all the ingredients ahead of time and read the instructions twice. After the caramel was made, I put the pot on the warming section of my stove on high and it kept it at the perfect temp while the milk was cooking (does require periodic stirring). Keep in mind, I've never made a pudding from scratch before and I wanted this to impress my father-in-law. Not only did it work PERFECTLY but my father-in-law thinks I am a culinary genius now! On last thing, be sure to use EXCELLENT quality scotch. Without it, it just isn't true butterscotch!

This recipe results in a delicious butterscotch pudding with true butterscotch flavor. It's a little labor intensive but well worth it. I didn't even need the garnishes but I'm sure those would be good, too.

somewhere along the way I did something wrong because my pudding never made it past the liquid butterscotch soup phase. not sure what the problem was, as i followed the recipe to the letter. i ended up throwing it in the ice cream maker and that worked like a charm. the ice cream was rich and delicious - definitely a good option for those of us who have problems getting it to thicken!

Delicious with perfect directions. I nailed it the first attempt. I DID make my carmel sauce in a non-stick pan and used rum rather than scotch because it was what I had on-hand. (Didn't think Crown Royal would work too well!) I didn't bother with the bananas or other garnishes - and we ate half of the recipe before it had cooled completely. It was absolutely fabulous and I'm looking forward to making again and again and again!

very good. a little on the sweet side. I omitted the scotch since I was serving it to kids---they loved it. It was a hit! Leave out the bananas---the blandness was too large of a contrast.

I ended up with a runny pudding, but realized the next day that it was because I quickly (not gradually, as directed...oops) added the butter, scotch, and vanilla, and then pulled it off the heat as soon as they melted. Let it simmer a bit after those additions to cook off some of the alcohol, and it won't be runny, the scotch won't be too strong, and you'll have a really good butterscotch pudding.

I had no trouble making this (caramel turned out real well, and that does not always happen), but I thought it tasted a bit " raw or starchy", as though it needed to cook a bit longer. I followed directions exactly, and I see that no one else mentions this so maybe it's just me.

thanks for all the advice! particularly on keeping the caramel liquid, and preparing the cornstarch mixture ahead of time. i am waiting for it to cool, but from what i can tell, it's going to be amazing!

It has also taken me a couple of times to perfect the technique for this recipe--but I have tried a lot of butterscotch puddings and this one is the best! One bit of advice since I actually pulled this rookie maneuver at one point--do NOT use a nonstick pan to make the caramel sauce...duh. And for goodness sake, use the recommended amount of GOOD scotch and it will not be too strong!

I have tried unsuccessfully a number of times to make butterscotch pudding, so I was skeptical. This pudding is excellent! Finally. The texture is perfect and not grainy like the other ones I have tried. I may cut the scotch in half next time because the alcohol was a little more overpowering than my kids would like. I will be serving it in little cups I made out of bittersweet chocolate with a dollop of whipped cream. Hurray!

This recipe was great! It only took one trial to get it right. You need to concentrate to get this one to get it done correctly! On the first try I cooked the sugar a bit too long (burnt it) and the amber smelled like smores. I also cooked the milks too long in the second saucepan and they didn't set correctly. They were still a bit runny by the next day. On top of that, I took the pan off of the heat before the strong alcohol flavor was tamed after adding the scotch. To make things easier, I found that if I measured the ingredients in the second saucepan with the cornstarch mixture and had the measured milk set aside before I made the carmel mixture, it was easier to stir in the carmel later. It cools quickly and by the time I got the second pan ready the carmel had hardened and I had to heat it again so I could get clumps of it out of the pan; all the while the milk mixture was getting overcooked. The carmel eventually softened but it added work to the recipe and my arm was tired from whisking waiting for it to soften. On the second try I kept the carmel over low heat and this helped but it still was on the way to getting hard quickly and I was afraid I would burn it. The second batch I made was Perfect. I added just a touch of bananas on the top. I figure why ruin such a great pudding with too many boring bananas. They are such an easy flavor to come by. I also made some home made whipping cream with just a little sugar and put a dollop on the top and on top of that put just a few sprinkles of toffee bits. Honestly, I could have done without the toffee too. It looks pretty but the pudding just doesn't need it. I served it in 8oz martini glasses to give it a fancy look; for one recipe this was perfect size for 8 servings. It's a technical recipe but really a cool dessert to serve on a holiday. People just don't make butterscotch anymore.

Excellent recipe, I will be making this often. Perhaps for a banana cream pie...

Butterscotch is one of my absolute favorite flavors, so I was really psyched to try this recipe. I had no problems with consistency (I added a tad more corn starch than called for) and it tasted delicious. The only problem was that the texture was a bit grainy. Perhaps I went too far with caramelizing the sugar???

I just finished making this for the second time. It was delectable before, and I think this time it will be even better, only because I was able to get the caramel sauce a bit darker amber this time, which makes a richer flavor. Be careful not to get it past the point of no return, but don't be afraid of a dark amber. Wildwood's Cory Schreiber is truly a master chef, and the pudding is not runny salty or alcoholic, and if this isn't your cup of pudding, go for something more pedestrian rather than screwing around with a perfect recipe. It is slightly salty, which I love--I have seen more caramel-salt combinations lately. I only used the whipped cream, out of my fabulous nitrous-powered cream whipper, which makes a cool presentation on top. Yummmy

People from all aspects of my life have loved this recipe (relatives, coworkers, and other epicureans). It doesn't need the whipped cream, bananas, or toffee bits - but they don't detract from the original creation in any way.

I thought this recipe came out perfectly. Not runny, not salty, and the scotch did not impart a "high octane" flavor at all. If anything, it was a tiny bit too sweet, but maybe I packed the brown sugar a little too tightly. You know what bugs me, though? People who change just about everything in a recipe before trying it the way it's written, and then complain and give it a low rating. PLEASE! Don't put your two cents in if you made butterscotch pudding without the scotch and then turned it into a chocolate pudding. HELLO! There's a reason it's called butterSCOTCH. If you don't like scotch, try a recipe that doesn't have scotch in the title for Pete's sake.

This is a rich, elegant butterscotch pudding recipe. The texture is fantastic. It wasn't the least bit runny or salty when I followed the recipe exactly as written. I am not sure why the previous comment said it was. It also did not have a strong alcohol taste. The scotch in the recipe added a more sophisticated layer to the flavor.

After reading one subscribers comments that the pudding was runny and seeing that the recipe called for 1/3 cup cornstarch and 5 yolks to only 3 cups milk, I suspected the scotch was the culprit (liquor). I substituted Irish Cream liquor and used 2 whole eggs. The consistency was perfect. I made my own pecan praline recipe for the toffee bits . I layered the pudding, praline bits, and bananas repeating the sequence twice. I topped it with additional praline bits. Excellent. Not too sweet---just right and a great buttercotch flavor.

This is easily our favorite butterscotch pudding recipe. The texture is smooth and silky, the flavor heavenly. We never will eat box butterscotch again! Just pay careful attention to the recipe to avoid a runny pudding.

I found the recipie to be not as great as I exspected. It looked really bad and didn't thicken but tasted okay.

This is a lovely little pudding, with a smooth, silky texture, a soft caramel color, a subtle but sophisticated flavor and a faint buttery taste. I found it rather runny, though, not that it really mattered but it's by no means a custard. Worth trying - and I served it in old fashioned champagne glasses, which was a pretty touch.
