I made the recipe substituting sriracha sauce for the Harissa and it was delicious. Sweet and spicy and juicy steak. Served it over a salad with mescluns, bocconcini, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers and a simple vinaigrette. Yum.

I take full blame for not enjoying this meal, if i had read the description for the harissa sauce before starting i would have known i would not like the flavor. Harissa sauce is definitely not for everyone.

Wonderful recipe. I eliminated the soy sauce because we're on a limited salt diet. But the dish was still very tasty.

I am a very lazy cook, always looking for shortcuts, and this is our favorite beef tips recipe. I bought the Harissa at Whole Foods, but when it came time to cook I couldn't find the instructions so after 30 minutes I put the marinade and the beef in the pan, and cooked it all Delicious. We actually crave this dish. My husband, who really does not like beef, absolutely loves it. Cooking everything together gives it a different flavor but still wonderful.

Made it with bison sirloin and added a pinch of cumin. Absolutely delicious - perfect blend of spicy and tangy. Will make again and again.

I continue to make this again and again. It's delicious and complex-tasting without being time consuming or difficult. I often add a little ground coriander and cumin. The quality of the harissa is key. I buy a french brand (La Cabanon) which is inexpensive and good quality.

I used the Black olives and Harissa recipe here for the harissa, not the olives just the harissa. (I used chipotles and a shake of crushed red pepper.) Flavor is wonderful, I marinated the meat for 6 hours and think I would let it marinate longer.I did use angus sirloin tips and they were very tough cooked as directed here. I think cooking them in liquid, like a stew, will help. A keeper and probably great on pork or chicken.

I used Clifford A. Wright's recipe for making my own Harissa. It's from his cookbook 'Some Like it Hot.' This was so spicy and decadent. I love Moroccan food and make this all the time now. It even works with chicken. Do take the time to use fresh thyme. It adds a whole other dimension to the marinade.

This is my go-to beef marinade. Flavorful and spicy. Plus, 30 minutes is enough time for the flavor to infuse with the beef (when it is cut into chunks).

I almost never give 4 forks, but this marinade deserves it. I made the harissa as suggested by others and mine didn't come out that spicy, so I added some Sriracha chili sauce, but other than that, no adjustments. Grilled these for a party and they went so fast I had to make another batch 2 days later to satisfy the craving. Yum, yum, yum.

This recipe is delicious and easy. I added a little ground coriander and fennel, which added a little more earthiness. I'll most definitely be making this again.

I made this for dinner last night... WOW! Was it good! I actually used a piece of Flank Cut Steak and we were able to cut through it like butter. I bought the Harissa Sauce from the store and I actually put at 3 parts of the Harissa Sauce in all at once and only used 2 tbsp of olive oil. For the side dish I cooked up a bag of Green Giant Roasted Potatoes with Garlic and Herb Sauce. My wife and I really enjoyed this dish and we will more than likely be making it again. WAS VERY GOOD

Excellent. Thanks to the reviewers for suggesting that i make the harissa. very easy and typically have most ingredients on my shelf. I agree that the steak tips are a little tough. By knowing this in advance, I made sure to cook them to medium rare. the sauce is excellent!!

Excellent steak recipe. Especially for the sauce. I make a batch or Harissa, and ended up using much more in the sauce, and still have left over for other uses - and there are plenty of uses! My family were wondering - where is "that sauce"?

Love the flavor of the marinade. As other reviewers suggested, I made my own harissa sauce using another Epicurious recipe (the one for Harissa and Black Olives). The directions for cooking the steak medium-rare worked well, although the meat was a little tough. I know top sirloin isn't considered a very tender cut, so next time I might try a different type of steak.

This dish was excellent, especially for those looking for something a little more exciting. There isn't a market around that sells harissa in a jar, so I had to make it using a recipe from this site. The marinade is delicious and not too overpowering. I used the extra harissa I made as a dipping sauce and it complimented the beef very well.

This is a new top notch recipe. I made it on chicken and tofu for a BBQ. Everyone licked their fingers and asked for more, including kids! I had one person tell me that this was the best BBQ chicken that they have ever had and it is so easy. All I have to say is just do it. I did make one change and had butter for the fat instead of oil. I think it makes a difference for the chicken. But both ways should be good!

Excellent recipe -- the marinated really enhanced the steak, didnt overwhelm it. Made this recipe with israeli cous cous and tomato and cucumber salad. Hit with the whole family.

Excellent. Grilled the tips instead of frying. Definitely make the side sauce. Great with rice pilaf and the Tomato and Cucumber Salad from this site as side dishes. Will most definitely be making this again (even the leftovers were fantastic).

Wonderful flavorful entree! Harissa tastes hot when you take it out of the jar but in the sauce it mellows. Its deliciously spicy!

These were wonderful. I used store bought harissa ... next time I'll make my one (epocurious has a good recipe)

Delicious steak! Savory, meaty, with a hint of heat. I only marinated for an hour, and the meat still had lots of flavor. We will be doing this for Father's Day with New York Strips; cannot wait to make/eat this again.

This is amazing! I used harissa made from the recipe for 'harissa and black olives', (also on this site), It is excellent. (I used two small fresh red chiles (birds eye?) instead of dried in the harissa recipe), and grilled the steak instead of frying it.Perfect. My family raved about this.

I made the marinade as written and used it for venison kebabs. The flavors were great. I served with preserved lemon, rice pilaf and a Mediterranean type of tomato salad.

Followed the recipe except I used ancho peppers & guajillo peppers. Marinated for 24 hours or a little longer. The recipe said to cut into tips, I cut into bigger portions. Easier to grill. Have a lot of harissa left over but I forgot to serve it after it was grilled. Great flavor

Fantastic! Big bold flavor even after marinating for only 1/2 hour. I added a tsp of crushed coriander seed and a dash of hoppy beer to the marinade. Might use a touch less sugar next time. Also, unless you or your guests are big fans of harissa - or you have a particularly mild batch - it's probably not necessary to make the side sauce.

I used petite sirloin steaks, substituted cayenne pepper for harissa and grilled them on the BBQ - phenomenal flavor.
