Good base recipe. I added shallot and more garlic at the beginning. Used 2lbs canned, and 1lb fresh tomatoes. I added some fresh rosemary, oregano, a bay leaf, and some red pepper flakes. I simmered 2 hours, and roasted the eggplant 40mins in a 1 inch dice. I added 2 Tbl tomato paste before serving with fresh basil and asiago. Dont forget salt and pepepr to taste. It was super delicious.

I chopped oregano, dill & basil and sliced crimini mushrooms with the onion and garlic for more flavor turned out good. I also used fresh tomatoes and boiled them with knorr suiza. Will do again.

I used this as a base. It gave me courage to do what I had planned. I used zucchini and eggplant. I sauteed it in olive oil and added it to the tomato mixture. I added freshly chopped oregano, basil and parsley to the onion mixture before I added the tomato. I served it with grated parmesan cheese. It was fresh and very tasty.

Made this dish twice, I must admit, it does need a little bit of 'oomph.' I find the eggplant thickens the sauce naturally. Be sure to sprinkle with lotsa parmesan cheese before serving.

I love eggplant because the texture is somewhat "meaty". This recipe is A LOT better if you grill summer squash and zucchini (in a garlic-olive oil marinade) and add it to the sauce. I use tomato paste in the sauce as well. I always add cbout a cup of Cabernet Savignon to the sauce to oomph the depth. It doesn't hurt to add another clove of garlic either...Everyone seems to love it. You can serve it over brown rice penne topped with fresh parmesan and fresh basil for garnish.

I found that if I added some more chopped garlic to the eggplant and baked with the garlic it added flavor. Also, I think it needs a can of tomato paste....which may not be authentic but makes it taste better.....
