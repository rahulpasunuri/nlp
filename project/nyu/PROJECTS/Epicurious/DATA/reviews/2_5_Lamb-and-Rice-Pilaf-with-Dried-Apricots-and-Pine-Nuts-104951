To those who thought it was just you--this was definitely bland! My boyfriend said, "It smells good, it looks good, but it's bland. It's like something sucked all the flavor out of it." I used the suggestions from A Cook from D.C., (both the ground lamb, because I don't like dealing with bones, and also the addition of cumin, saffron, turmeric and extra garlic) and it was still bland. I also had difficulty getting the rice to cook... which I think was me (we just moved and I couldn't find the lids). If anyone makes this in the future, may I suggest: 1. using broth instead of water (I would suggest this whether using boned or ground lamb); 2. adding the apricots, garlic, and tomatoes after the rice has been cooking for a few minutes, then adding the lamb; 3. doubling the spices suggested by Washington, D.C.

This is another (maybe this time I'll learn!) recipe that calls for cooking the lamb long enough to dry it out, the broth reduction doesn't happen quickly enough, and the reserved liquid is really too much for the amount of rice. Edible, but not choice.

I made this recipe, using the suggestions provided by a cook from Washington, DC. It was quite tasty. I made a bed of rice on a platter and topped it with the ground lamb mixture and toasted pine nuts. Next time I'll also top it with crumbled feta. Add a salad and a glass of red wine!

I admit, I went free form with this recipe... but with the changes I made, it was oh-so-good! First, to simplify things, I bought ground lamb, and browned it with the onions. I seasoned this mixture with turmeric (1/2tsp), cumin (1/2 tsp), cinnamon (1 tsp), and garlic (1 clove). Meanwhile, I cooked the rice, adding just a couple of threads of saffron. Added chopped dried apricots while rice was sitting. Threw rice into skillet with lamb mixture to brown it slightly, adding salt & pepper to taste. Then I let the whole thing cool, and added toasted almonds (though I imagine the pine nuts would also be tasty). Yum, yum, yum! This recipe might be somewhat bland as written, but it can be used as a good base if you experiment a little.

My experience is like Mr. Bowens' Bland!

This recipe brings new meaning to the word "bland"! It's a mystery. It reads well. It smells great while cooking. It was the single biggest disappointment of my cooking career. Maybe it was me?
