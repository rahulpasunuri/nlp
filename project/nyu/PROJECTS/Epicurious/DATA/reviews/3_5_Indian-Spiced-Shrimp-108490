I am new to Indian food and this was my first time cooking something like this. It was SUPER easy to make and really really good. Next time I will make rice to go with it. I did use canned diced tomatoes because I didn't have fresh. You should absolutely make it.

This recipe was quick and easy. I did not have any problems with dryness as other reviewers mentioned, but I used just two tomatoes and substituted the third with half of a red bell pepper. I also left out the coriander and jalapeño (hard- to-find ingredients here in Chile), doubled the turmeric and added half a teaspoon of curry powder. Delicious!

I was dissapointed. The tomatoes totally covered up the spices. If I try this again I will drastically reduce or leave out the tomatoes.

This was a good recipe - would not give it 4 forks as it's not 'exceptional' - just pretty good for a quick, easy weeknight dinner. I used canned tomatoes as suggested by previous reviewers, and will use canned again as it gives a sauce with more liquid. You could easily add vegetables this such as green peas, zuccinni, spinach etc. You could also easily substitute other seafood such as scallops or chunks of fish. Will make again.

this is really really good. i use a combo of fresh and canned tomatoes to add some liquid...have also added some stock and let the shrimp simmer in the oven....yum. i make frequently.

Really fast & easy. Excellent.

It was very good but the sauce had a pasty texture and at times, the pan was so dry I was afraid it would scorch (it didn't, though). I will try canned tomatoes next time, both to make this quicker and to add just a bit of liquid. Still, extremely tasty and I will make again.

This was both easy and delicious. Aside from using two cloves garlic and just slightly more than a tablespoon of minced jalopeno pepper I followed the recipe exactly. It was slightly hot and perfectly spiced for our taste. My husband declared this good enough to serve as a company dish. If you slice the onion, mince the pepper, grate the ginger, cut up the tomato, and peel and devein the shrimp ahead of time, the orep (actual cooking) time is very short and you can enjoy your guests. If you like Indian food, this is a great make at home dish. We had it with frozen Nan (Indian bread) from Trader Joe's - perfect.

We made this last night and didn't change a thing--it was so simple and easy to prepare, and just delicious. I am sure this will become a refular in our dinner rotation!

This dish was so easy to prepare and the flavor was great. Served it with cumin and ginger scented orzo. Followed recipe exactly except had to sub long green hot pepper for jalapeno.

I made this for a dinner with friends, and it was a HUGE hit! The spice was just right (I used a fairly large jalapeno), and the flavor combo was delicious.

This was delicious. i used a chipotle pepper instead and it turned out incredibly spicy, we were all sniffling through the meal, but we still loved it. next time i will use 1/3 a chipotle.

the flavors were great together, but i thought it lacked a little heat--i added some curry and would have added another jalapeno if i had one to make it a little zippier!

Very easy and tasty. I'd add more heat (jalapenos) next time - if you like things on the spicy side, I'd advise the same. This will go into regular rotation. And I think if there aren't great ripe tomatoes available, you'd do just as well using a can - save yourself the chopping.

Spectacular flavors! Very easy and wonderful dish.

This dish is so easy to prepare and so flavorful. I had the shrimp on hand so I came to Epicurious.com to find a recipe that is different and this is what I decided upon. (Mostly because I had many of the ingredients!) I will definitely make it again. The only things I did differently were that I didnt have fresh ginger, so I used bottled (Yikes!), and I was out of coriander so I did not add that. It was still quite lovely.

This was great!! I followed the recipe as is and served it with rice. Next time, I'd add more jalepenos, because the spice was just hinted at. I'll probably make this again next week.

Agree with previous reviewer: every time I make it according to the recipe unaltered it is fantastic. Everyone loves it. While it may not be authentic, it's delicious and easy.

Wow, every time! I made this several times without any changes and it was well loved by my husband and kids, delicious. Too bad people try to change ingredients and procedures all the time, they don't realize that this changes the entire experience!!!Try it for yourself...without changes.

I'm not sure where Washington, PA is coming from. I'm an Indian food lover, but this was the first dish I've ever made. It was delicious. The only change ove the original recipe would be to peel the skins from the tomatoes.

I made this recipe with a combination of shrimp and scallops and it turned out great. To make a great vegetarian option, I've also substituted eggplant cubes for the shrimp.

I agree with Alaska,this time of year I would make the recipe exactly as written. In the middle of winter with limp peppers and inedible or pricey tomotoes I would opt to be able to make the recipe with canned (I can usually get the ginger).

Rating: 3
Just a follow-up, I feel the need to defend my substitutions (ground ginger and a can of tomatoes w/ jalapenos), after reading a comment made previous to this - I live in rural Alaska, and fresh produce is often unavailable to me, which was the case here - so cut a little slack ;)- thank you. Again, great meal!

Great recipe! We followed it exactly and served it with rice timbales, green beans, salad, and syrah.

this was great! we did change a couple of things, we cooked the shrimp in oil and garlic first, before we started the sauce. we also used more tomatoes( and we peeled them first). it was so easy and quick.we served it on whole wheat fettucine. yummy!! we will definitely make it again!

Very good how ever next time I would add a little more of the spicies to "kick it up a notch" ate it with rice, Indian flat bread and mango chutney

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. The spices blended really well together and the jalepeno gave it a little punch (but not too spicy). I highly recommend this recipe, it is very simple and easy to prepare. I was a little skeptical about the "sauce" forming, but as the tomatoes cooked down a perfect amount of sauce formed. Give it a try!!

This was the best curried shrimp recipe that I've ever found. Because we like sauce, I prepared 3/4 pound of shrimp (for 2) but did not reduce the other ingredients. Served with fresh mango and simple steamed rice, this dish is a winner.

Great weeknight meal -(I served it with some saffron rice and garlic green beans). This dish has great flavor (even better as a leftover) but the spice isnt overkill. I will DEFINITELY make this again. A keeper!!

Wow! I thought this was great. A very easy, weeknight meal. The shrimp turned out delicious, not at all overcooked and the flavor was perfect. This will become a staple.

A big disappointment. Not worthy of Gourmet.The shrimp should be cooked before adding the tomatoes, removed and returned after "sauce" is made. The tomatoes definitely need to have the skins removed, or use canned. Flavors were nice, but mild. I wouldn't make this again.
