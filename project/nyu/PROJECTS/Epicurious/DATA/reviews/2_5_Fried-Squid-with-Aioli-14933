Good recipe, and the aioli is a nice alternative to tartar sauce or horseradish.

Puttin on the ritz is an idea,but pulsing some panko to a fine grade should crisp it up more,other than that good squid.

At the risk of wrath of readers who get upset at such things - I looked at this but didn't make it for the reasons listed by other reviewers. Instead, what worked well was to slice and rinse the squid to calamari size, then soak in milk or buttermilk. After a while, I drained them and tossed them with a fry mix (seasoned flour, a touch of cornmeal), let them rest, then fried in a small pan in melted Crisco. Drain on a little rack over paper towel (cookie rack) and while still hot, season with good salt and fresh lemon juice. Easy, and tasty to die for.

I followed the recipe exactly, and the coating did not stay on very well. Also, I just don't think you can get the oil hot enough on your stove to have restaurant style results. This dish stunk up my house for 3-days, and the aioli tasted like a mildly flavored mayonaise. There has to be a better recipe out there for that. My suggestion is to skip the ritz crackers, use flour and cook it in a deep fat fryer (preferably outside). Or, don't even bother and order it next time you go out to eat.

I haven't tried this recipe in it's entirely. I've made the aoli (or a reasoble facsimile, with good results. I'm curious however about the squid. The Saltine crackers would sure simply things, but it seems to me that if the purpose of using them is for crispiness, then Japanese Panko crumbs my be a better choice. I'd love to hear from others about this.
