I didn't think this was too bad. It's unfortunate that people rate this and haven't even tried it. The object is to make it vegan! I'm sure there are some vegans in the south. BBT spent a year eating raw and vegan and thus, I think this is plausible. This is a recipe site to post reviews - not what you think should be done to a recipe you haven't even tried yet.

I am happy to try a vegan version of pimemto cheese, Georgia luckily doesn't speak for the entire south. HA! Go "green" by going Vegan in 2009 or at least one day a week!!

I doubt that BBT likes the so-called healthy version much. I've been making these since I learned to cook and really, the simpler, the better. Use mayo, grated cheese, red peppers or pimentos, black or green olives, salt and pepper and hot red chili powder-all to taste. Chop it and mix it up, spread on good bread and grill both sides using butter or broil open-face.

I grew up on pimento cheese, and I'm always looking for some twist on it to try. I've never tried olives or scallions in it before - sounds good. As for the tomato dip take away the soy products and replace with milk and sounds like something I'd make at home and my kids would love, especially with fancy grilled pimento cheese sandwiches to dip into it. I'll let you know how it goes.

Sorry Akasha, in the true South we don't use soy or vegan any thing. Sounds awful and would not even try it. Pimento cheese sandwiches are very special to us, so don't ruin it.
