I did cheet and use a frozen deep dish pie crust - I don't do crust. But, I otherwise followed this exactly as printed w/the tiny exception that technically I didn't have an entire cup of Gruyere, so I added a tiny bit of Jarlsberg. It was good, though it seemed very liquid-like to me... I even baked an extra 5 min b/c I was worried it wasn't really done. It did firmup a bit when cooling, but I still wonder if it could afford a little less liquid to start. Nice overall, and I was happy I could spread this out to prepare over the course of the evening whilst chasing/entertaining a baby!

I would give the recipe as written 3 forks, but with minor modifications it was a 4. I made pastry with my favourite yet simple recipe. 1.5 cups flour, 7 Tbsp cold butter, and 5-6 T ice water. As recommended by others I did not prebake the shell but did start the quiche off in a 425 oven and then turned down to 375 after 10 minutes. I had a few bits and pieces that needed to be used up in the fridge, so added 1/4 bulb fennel and a shallot, both finely sliced, to the zucchini. My husband and I both loved this - so much so that it would never have served 6-8.

If you are using a store bought pie crust, you need to cut the liquid in half. It will never fit a regular pie crust. I didn't try a deep dish one, maybe that would work...

Easy and excellent! Made as a summer evening dinner with garden zucchini! Huge hit!

This recipe was fantastic! I ended up using a frozen pie dough shell I had leftover, although normally I would make one from scratch. I substituted asparagus for the zucchini since my fiance doesn't really like zucchini/squash in general. The quiche turned out perfectly. The custard was quite thick but completely delicious and the Gruyere was the perfect cheese for the recipe.

Quite tasty. Set up nicely too. I didn't have gruyere on hand, so I used shredded mozzarella instead. Definitely making again.

My family loves this recipe so I made some last year for Christmas presents for friends. I bought red, green, or yellow ceramic quiche pans (whatever I could find)at discount stores and made the quiche using sliced red bell pepper for half the zucchini. Like several other reveiwers I only used a tablespoon or two of the bacon fat to saute the vegetables. I used white pepper instead of black as I like it with egg dishes. The result was festive looking and delicious quiches for Christmas morning. One thing I noticed the first time I made this - I weighed out 2 oz. of cheese and it is not nearly enough to make a cup! Otherwise the recipe worked perfectly.

This was a delicious way to start my Valentines day. I used a frozen deep dish pie crust, and because of that, I used 4 eggs instead of 3. Blind baking the crust made for a nice flaky pastry and the filling was fluffy and silky. Definately worth the effort. I plan on making this again over the weekend. The leftovers make for a wonderful lunch with a side of dressed greens.

This is a staple in my house. We have it in the winter time with tomato soup, and in the summer time with a salad. I usually pre-bake the crust and it comes out a little on the well-done side, so next time I'll try it without pre-baking as others have recommended.

I followed the instructions exactly, and I loved the result! Very tasty, fresh tasting and easy enough to make. The crust was a little soggy on the bottom, so I'll try it again without pre-baking.

The recipe yielded an easy-to-prepare and straight forward quiche. I wouldn't say the recipe was exceptional, although it was definitely very good. Though I did not change anything the recipe called for, I did make a few additions: I sauteed about 1/4 cup shallots with the zucchini, stirred in about 2 tbs. green onion into the milk / egg mixture, and added more cracked pepper than the recipe suggested. The end result was great - this is a go-to for future, easy week-night meals.

Delicious and easy. Added 1 poblano pepper and a couple chopped mushrooms to the zucchini, and used Emmentaler instead of Gruyere because it's what I had around. Didn't precook the crust and it came out perfectly. Definitely adding to my list of things to make regularly.

I based this recipe off of what I had in my refrigerator! I added one diced white onion, one diced plum tomato, and four handfulls of spinach to the zucchini/bacon and subbed parm reggiano for the gruyere. It came out delicious, although I probably should have cooked it closer to, 30-35 minutes, and let it sit longer, 20-25 minutes, to prevent it from getting watery after being sliced.

I LOVED this quiche! I had been looking for a quiche recipe that would replace my mom's recipe (which I simply could not master!). I used half zuchinni and half yellow squash, and added some parmesan and swiss cheese. Easy, flavorful, and wonderful.

I didn't have bacon or gruyere at home so I used low fat cheddar and browned some chorizo and it added a nice spice to the quiche. Serve for breakfast and had a it again for supper.

i used asparagus instead of zucchini and used 1 cup whipping cream, 1/2 cup whole milk instead of 3/4 of each and it was delicious! the fluffiest quiche ever. i dissagree with reviewers who said not to prebake the crust -- i prebaked 10 minutes and should have done longer... it was a little soggy.

Like the other reviewers, I found this to be an absolutely fabulous golden brown with beautiful green zucchini cuts on the top. I followed the directions of the reviewer who (1) did not bake the crust first (2) only beat the eggs and cream together for 2 minutes before pouring them over the other ingredients (3) layering the ingredients in two rounds -- gruyere, then bacon, then zucchini, repeat once more. Great presentation, delicious fluffy flavor, despite the bacon not fatty. I used just one cup of heavy whipping cream but will use 1/2 cup of creme fraiche next time (if I have it on hand). Also added shallots and garlic to the zucchini while frying it. Combed out the seeds of the zucchini to keep liquid levels low and dumped out bacon oil until barely a tablespoon remained. Worked just fine!

I followed the recipe ALMOST exactly . . . . I only had jack cheese instead of gruyere. By far, it is the best quiche I have made for my family. Everyone, including my picky 12 year old, raved about it.

Just made this today for a dinner party. It is delish, but am contributing due to the small changes I made. I cook my bacon first in strips and then break it up later. I sauteed the zucchini with a small onion and one cube of garlic from Trader Joe's frozen garlic (great product). I also did not heat the liquid mixture. I made it earlier and then reheated in the evening and there is only one sliver left. I highly recommend this quiche or the ham/leek quiche also on this website. Very tasty!!

This was an excellent quiche with a combination of modifications suggested in several previous reviews. I used puffed pastry as the crust because I did not have pie crust, nor was I in the mood to make a crust. I cut the liquid portion to 1/2 cup half & half and 1/2 cup 1% milk. Shallots were a must and I added about a 1/4 cup finely chopped. I utilized small, thin zucchini and sliced them extremely thinly without halving them first. I found that it browned up very nicely without producing a lot of liquid. I did not need to drain it in any way and found with the reduction in volume of liquid, the finished product set up very nicely. I also poured out most of the bacon grease, leaving about a teaspon or two in the pan. It has an addictive little flavor and I will definitely make again. Next time, I'm going to play around with reducing the amount of bacon and cheese and perhaps utilizing a combination of eggs and egg whites to try to lighten it up. I also considered making it crustless. I'll post again when I try these changes.

I adapted this recipe using the butternut squash and brie we had, instead of the zucchini and gruyere shown. I knew I'd stumbled on the right recipe via Google when the instructions said to cook the squash in the bacon grease! This came out absolutely perfect, and was a big hit.

Very good techninique, usually I just mix all ingredients together and put in oven cold, but warming up the cream mixture first I think resulted in a lighter custard- like texture.

This recipe is a winner which I have made again and again. I usually double the batter and purchase two frozen pie shells. I'll make one as directed and in the second one use a combination of other vegetables, with or without bacon. Red peppers, spinach and mushrooms work well as additions to this recipe. I initially served one vegetarian and one with bacon, but the bacon really makes this gem taste better, so now both quiches are served with bacon.

I served this recently at a brunch with a few modifications and it was a hit. First I used a store bought frozen crust which I baked for about 5 minutes before filling. I eliminated the bacon since I had vegetarian guests and didn't miss the flavor. But, next time I will try it. Also, I used egg substitute (egg beaters) to save on fat and cholesterol and replaced the cream w/ half and half. You only need to add 1 cup total milk/cream to the eggs and be sure to completely drain the oil/grease from the zucchini. Finally sprinkly some fresh thyme over the top before you bake. Mine puffed up beautifully and was moist and light and perfect served at room temp.

I used a deep dish pan and so i used 1 cup skim and 1 cup cream and 4 eggs total. i also cooked the zucchini with a bti of garlic and onions and only about a tablespoon of the bacon fat and used olive oil for the rest. I cooked the zucchini for about 20 minutes, until fully cooked and kept it on medium high heat to get all of the liquid out after reading the other reviews. i did NOT pre-bake the crust or the milk mixture. i layered gruyere and romano cheese on the bottom, sprinkled some bacon, then zuchini, then chesse, then bacon, then poured the egg/milk/cream that i had whisked for about 2 mins over the top. i baked it at 375 for about 45 mins, cooled to room temp and warmed up the following day at 325 for 30 mins. it was a HUGE hit at my xmas brunch. the egg part came out so creamy and light i couldn't believe it. i will definitely make again.

This has a tender, flavorful custard and great balance of flavors. Brought it to a pot luck and it was the first thing gone in about 10 minutes. My zucchini- disdaining husband couldn't get enough of it and has already asked me to make it again.

This has got to be one of the best quiche's I've ever tasted. I made it with more zucchini, bacon, and cheese and it was basically to the brim with the ingredients but it made for a more filling and appetizing dinner. I would def. make this again in a heart beat.

Loved it! I followed others reviews to drain the zucchini carefully and use less bacon grease. I also added minced onion. I used puffed pastry dough because I was being lazy. Make 2!! The one I made was devoured in seconds. I barely had a sliver!

this dish was amazing. i made it with extra bacon and zucchini and when i filled the crust it was basically to the top. i added the remaining gruyere to the top afer baking and put it in the oven for another 5-7 min to melt it. that definitely is the way to make it. very substantial and filling. just great all around.

Agreed the recipe calls for too much liquid. I used 1/2 c half-and-half and 1/2 cup creme fraiche (skipping the heating step as suggested by another), reduced Gruyere to 1 1/2 cups and still rich and decadent. The cheese really shines, while zucchini adds the substance. Sided with arugula tossed with oil and balsamic.

I followed the suggestions and used a reduced amount of cream/milk, added shallot and red pepper that I had on hand, as well as using the two baby portabello mushrooms I had in the fridge. It is delicious this way. Next time, I will try it with just the zucchini and shallots. Simpler may be even better, but the modifications were darned good!

Absolutely fantastic..I took the recommendation of reducing liquids to 1/2 each. Probably will experiment using half&half and lower milk fat to reduce calories. I added a shallot and zuccini to very minimal bacon grease to saute and drained both on paper towels to minimize any extra liquid. I believe my total cooking time was about 40 minutes. Long enough to produce a nice golden top...Perfect !!

This was absolutely amazing! Hubby loved it, and the leftovers are calling my name! I needed to do something with my monster zucchini, and this made two deep dish pies. I followed previous advice to reduce the liquid (I used 1/2 + 1/2) and bacon grease, which worked perfectly, then added red onion, salt and pepper while cooking. I added roasted red pepper, fresh parsley and chives to the finished filling, and put it directly into the shells. I topped the pies with cheese (Swiss, in my case), combined the cold milk and eggs (no heating), and poured that mix over the filling in the pies. My hint: if the zucchini are big enough to have seeds, scoop or cut out the seedy section before slicing to reduce liquid when cooking. Delicious!!

The combination of bacon and zucchini make a tasty quiche and I would make it again but I think this recipe does have a few problems. Many reviewers accepted blame for a runny quiche when this recipe calls for much more liquid than is typical. That will cause a runny quiche. Also what is with the extra step (and extra pan) heating the cream and tempering the eggs? Completely unnecessary. Also, it is much easier to get even distribution of the solid ingredients if they are combined and spread in the crust and the beaten cream and egg mixture is poured over them. So try the quiche but use 1 cup of liquid whether it be a combination of heavy cream and milk or all half and half as I did. Skip the heating of the cream and just beat it with the eggs. Pour off all but two tablespoons of the bacon fat to sauté the zucchini. Adding some finely diced sautéed onion is a nice addition as well as some herbs. I used fresh parsley and rosemary but some fresh basil would also be great. I also added some sautéed red bell pepper and used provolone because that is what I had on hand. I used a cream cheese pie crust recipe from this site that I added chives to in place of the store bought crust.

Like others, I didn't quite get the zucchini drained well enough, which in turn didn't allow the dish to set quite right, but despite that, it completely disappearred! A great brunch item and even works well cold.

I thought this quiche was very good. Onions/shallots make a good addition, as someone suggested in an earlier comment. I baked it at 375 for about 40 minutes, but I made the mistake of not draining the zucchini enough so there was some excess liquid. I used a sheet of puff pastry for the crust. I will definitely make again!

Oh my, this is very, very good. I did add some minced onion along with the zucchini to the bacon fat. I happened to have had some leftover and wanted to use it up, it was a nice addition.

I changed almost everything in this recipe and it was still good. I made a home-made crust with whole wheat flour and not much butter; I used turnip greens instead of zucchini; I used low fat milk, and a different cheese; and no bacon. It must be really good if you do it right!

Can't do refrigerated crusts...had to make my own. I also slimmed it down a bit...sauteed the zucchini in a bit of EVOO instead of the bacon grease, reduced the cheese by about 1/3...TASTY!

Though this recipe is very similar to others I've used I followed the recipe as written..until I got to the part that said to use all the bacon grease to fry the zucchini..no way! I used about 2 Tbs of the rendered fat and also drained the zucchini when I was finished. I remember Julia Child saying that it doesn't matter what kind of milk you use, though cream provides a richer flavor..all kinds will work.I used fat free half and half. A nice addition for a bit of holiday color would be some thin slices of tomato placed on top before putting in the oven!

This quiche had excellent flavor, so I know I will make it again. However, I ended up using the whole wheat pie shells from Whole Foods, which I guess are smaller than normal because I had enough filling for two shells. I also needed to bake it longer than called for in the recipe.

I don't even like quiche and I LOVED this simple and delicious dinner! I did add 1/2 a small white onion (sauteed with the zucchuni) because I love bacon and onion together. I highly recommend you give it a try!

This quiche is wonderful and also very easy to make (which I now appreciate since I have a 3-month old baby). It's quite fattening, as you would expect from the list of ingredients, but totally worth it. If you wanted something a little lower in calories, I'm pretty confident that using half & half, and 2% milk would work as well. Also, as stated by the others, be sure to drain the zucchini because there's a lot of unnecessary bacon grease left over in the pan... Enjoy! (Oh, and my husband loved it too).

Really great quiche! Per others' reviews, I drained the zuchini which worked out very well. However, I did change the recipe a little. Instead of sauteing the zuchini in bacon fat, I used chile oil which gave it a little zip. Also added about an 1/8 of a teaspoon of garlic powder, 3 dashes of paprika, and freshly ground pepper to the zuchini while cooking. I used 1.5 cups of gruyere cheese as well. Turned out absolutely great...my husband, who is not a big quiche fan, pronounced it "really good!" and stated he would definitely like to have it again.

I haven't tried this (yet), but suspect that it would help to drain the sauteed zucchini on paper towels or a clean dishtowel, before throwing in the quiche with the other ingredients. Zucchini can throw off a lot of water while cooking, which could add to the wetness of the quiche.

The flavor in this quiche is excellent, but I needed to bake it longer so it wasn't so soft.
