My husband and I really enjoyed this...I served with the "sauteed green beans with coconut" on this site and black "forbidden" rice. I added some red peppers to the green beans and it was really beautiful on the plate. The cool chutney complemented the spicy shrimp nicely. I probably would not bother with butterflying the shrimp next time since they just curled up into weird shapes anyway. I don't see how anyone could have had a problem with the spices sticking to the shrimp since they are naturally wet once the shells are removed....just be sure to use a good turmeric and paprika because they are what adds the "spice" to this dish.

Absolutely wonderful flavor. Kept nibbling on the leftovers all night until there weren't any leftover. I added a little extra red pepper flakes since I like my stuff spicy. I didn't have the problem that another reviewer had with the spices not sticking to the shrimp because it is a dry mix. I just sprinkled it on and tossed the shrimp around with tongs and they coated nicely.

This has a nice taste, but it has no wet ingredients to make the spices stick to the shrimp. If I made it again, I would brush a little olive oil on it.
