Insufficient flavor and simply not as special as it seemed from the description. I had to bake the hens much longer to avoid blood around the bones. I would have preferred to either panfry them entirely or bake them from the beginning - the browning in the skillet was pointless.

This was a lot of work for little pay off. The rice/stuffing was good but needed some additions. I put in dried cranberries as well as some toasted pinenuts - that added that right sweetness and texture balance. The port sauce failed misserably. I sensed as I was deglazing the pan there was too much burned drippings and that is what the sauce tasted like and I didn't bother serving it. I think there probably needs to be more fat and liquid for the roasting. I may make the rice again but not the chicken.

I really liked this recipe. I doctored up the stuffing with about double the sausage and tomatoes and added raisins. Very tasty. The challenge was the cooking process. I had to turn the birds 3/4 through to get the bottoms brown and crispy. Maybe I didn't pan brown them enough but I really wanted it crispy. Then had to add considerable cooking time to get the stuffing up to temperature. Overall this was a high maintenance dish but the end result was healthy, tasty and fun since everyone had their own bird.

This must really need the stuffing to give any flavor. I didn't stuff the birds, just basted with the sauce - the result was ok, but certainly not flavorful. Also, cooking took much longer - even with birds cut in half, and putting them at the top 1/3 of oven made the skin too dark before the inner thigh meat was done.

Great Recipe - After I made the stuffing, something was lacking. I added 1/2 tsp fresh chopped rosemary and 1/3 c dried currants - WOW. Definitely will use this stuffing recipe again. Used a rice medley (brown, red, wild) and sweet italian turkey sausage.

we doubled this and made it for a New Year's Eve dinner. Raves all around.

This was an excellent dish. For serving, we did not cut the birds in half and I believe that was a mistake. The result was very tasty, but it was also a bit messy. Initially, I did not brown the birds in a skillet, but bushed them with butter and put them right on the rack in the roasting pan. During the roasting process, I had to increase the amount of liquid (port: 2 cups and chicken broth: 3 cups). This (I believe) was a result of my roasting pan. In fact, every time I use this particular pan (hey it's my only pan the rack fits in) all the juices burn off into thin air. I had to lengthen the cooking time by almost 30 minutes, as my hens were larger and had come from the refrigerator. The shining star of this recipe was the sauce, it was simply delicious. We only had ruby port, so it was used as a substitute for the tawny port. No arrowroot either, so I used flour. The stuffing was also tasty, and I was skeptical at using wild rice and so much onion and parsley. I will certainly make it again and I am looking forward to trying the sauce with chicken.

This was easy and very good.I subbed Garlic & Herb FarEast rice mix, added sundried tomatoes and crumbled italian sausage with the other ingrediants. Fantastic! I think next time I would add some fruit like raisins or chopped apple to complement the port sauce. Yummmm!

In our house, Sunday dinner is an event. This was a hit. I also substituted Andouille sausage, but for those who don't like the extra punch, stick to the original. I was short on time as well, so I used Near East Wild Rice (cooks in 15 min) and added all the fixins to it for a great stuffing. A hit I would like to serve to friends!!!

We used the stuffing in chicken breasts, I seared them and then baked them for 20 min. I really enjoyed the sauce from the pan - I don't think the extra gravy is worth the trouble

This was my first time preparing Cornish hens and, as much as I delight in trying out new recipes, this might have been an overly ambitious undertaking for me. I made it for Thanksgiving dinner at the behest of my b/f who loves Cornish hens. I followed the instructions to the letter, but it was undercooked [why bake it in the upper third of the over??} and we had to nuke his a minute or two to finish it off. The stuffing was delicious, but the sauce flopped. I dunno. I'm no novice to Gourmet magazine but, unfortunately, the meal was a bit of a disaster. I was very thankful that I had prepared salmon for myself! But, yes -- I'll try it again.

This recipe was delicious. I suggest using extra dried tomatoes and substitute white onions for a sweeter flavor.

This is a great dish for a special evening. I have made it for Christmas Eve dinner two years in a row. The leftover dressing is great the next day too.

The port sauce and the stuffing were a delight as well and we can see either one of them going well with a number of different meats and poultry. Would suggest giving it a little extra cooking time if using the cornish hens. Will definately make it again.
