I thought this was an easy dish, made it with a hint of soy instead of salt, upped the bacon to a 1/4 pound in it and another 1/4 on it and mixed black and red beans. My family wouldn't let the fridge close before stealing more leftovers.

What sort of beans did ya'll use, because I made this and the sauce taste amazing but... the beans are still hard as ROCKS. I used navey beans and soaked them over night.

I made this recipe because I was out of molasses, which my normal Boston Baked Beans recipe calls for. My recipe does not include tomatoes. I prefer my usual recipe, which has a much more carmelized flavor. When making this recipe, after tasting it, I found it tasted rather ketchupy, so I upped the mustard to 3 T, added a little balsamic vinegar, and jumped the dark brown sugar to 1/2 C. It still tasted too much like tomatoes, but nothing I could do about that -- I just really prefer my baked beans sans tomatoes.

Great recipe and very easy! I didn't have Dijon so used just regular yellow mustard. Will definitely make again.

I thought the sauce needed a little more oomph, so I added more dijon and lots of freshly ground black pepper. Next time, I may also saute the onion first and stir it into the beans. Overall -- very tasty!

Flavorful, different, excellent. The dish was made for a party and it was licked clean! Fun alternative to plain old baked beans.

Didn't actually try the recipe... I was scrolling thru the MEATLESS recipes and came across the Baked Beans with BACON and Brown Sugar... I think this is in the wrong category!!
