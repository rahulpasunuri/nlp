Good, but needs a little something more. I served it with spicy tomato sauce for dipping, but next time I'll double the salami and maybe add some red pepper flakes too.

Very good. I added a couple types of salami as well as some of the other reviewers. I also topped it with spagetti sauce and mozzy after it came out of the oven. This was good the first night. Excellent for lunch the next day and beyond belief the next night.

If the people eating are not disinclined, a quick saute involving a mixture of fresh or canned mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers would be the most delightful addition. xD

Thought the stromboli was great. Of course I made a few changes, but nothing that really alters the recipe. I finely diced a red pepper as I didn't feel like roasting it. I piled on salami, ham, pepperoni, provolone, and mozzarella cheese. Next time I would leave out the salami and use capicola as it will be less greasy. Rolled it up, brushed on olive oil. Baked for 30 minutes and it came out perfectly. The marinara sauce is really key. Gave it four forks only because it's a great snack hot or at room temp.

So much fun to do! Making the stromboli was a group activity for my family. We made a few kinds, but I found the classic to be the most yummy. Definitely make or buy a marinara sauce for dipping.

Yum! Added turkey pepperoni and made a vodka sauce to dip. So good. Baked in about 25 mins. Be cautious, it does get greasy when its baking, so make sure you cook it on a sheet with a rim so you dont get a smokey oven (like i did!) I also layed the stomboli on paper towels for a few min to soak up some of the grease...Loved this recipe!

My family loved it. I omitted the peppers and just used parmesan, pepper, pepperoni, and provolone and it came out delish! Warmed some pasta/marinara sauce to go with it and dip it and it was a hit!

I liked this, but I think I need a dipping sauce.

This is great! We make dough in the bread machine and sometimes add fresh mozzarella. We've made it both with and without the red peppers--adults and kids prefer it with. Sauce on the side isn't necessary when made with red peppers. We overstuffed it once, and it was very greasy--still good but felt much guiltier eating it! We usually double or triple the recipe to serve as a snack for our teen's parties (which they gobble up) and also to give to grateful friends and neighbors.

This was tasty, though very greasy. It wasn't hard to make, but the active time of 15 mins is a bit misleading. It's unlikely that I will make this again.

This was delicious. Bought the dough from Trader Joe's. Used pepperoni, cappicola, hard salami, provolone, Parmigiano-Reggiano. Yummy. Almost as good as those made at the Italian grocery stores in my husband's home town. Served them an organic marinara sauce from T.J.'s.

Yum. good and very easy. i used fresh mozz but otherwise changed nothing.

I've made this several times. I always use Pillsbury pizza dough, just because it's so easy. I also add thinly sliced Cappicolla (sp?), thinly sliced basil, and serve it with a side of Newman's marinara. My kids call it Italian Grilled Cheese, and there's never any left!

I made this as an appetizer for a graduation party, passed along to me by my pal Jenni, who had this in her recipe box. Used pizza dough made in my bread machine, added more red pepper than called for as well as more parm, but otherwise followed recipe. Chilled it and then sliced it into finger sandwiches to serve. It got rave reviews. Thanks Jenni!

I love this recipe. I've been making a variation of this for years and it's always a favorite and is requested for every party. I've been making it with peppered ham, pepperoni and mozzarella. I think the roasted peppers will be a great addition.

I also use the Wolfgang Puck recipe for pizza dough! I experiment with different cheese/meat/vegetable combinations and all are delicious. Make extra, freeze, defrost and reheat in microwave or oven - still delicious!

Yummy! Brought me back to the days of living in Pennsylvania and we would buy these at the local pizza shop! I made a few changes . . . I made fresh pizza dough (Wolfgang Puck's recipe--it's on the food network's website), I roasted my own peppers (green and red), I baked on a pre-heated pizza stone, and I served them with a side of pizza sauce to dip in (just used bottled ragu pizza sauce). My husband and kids LOVED this! They know that I almost never make a recipe twice because I love to cook and try different things all the time, but they all said, "will you please make this again, SOON!" Hmmmm, maybe . . .

Quite good. I wasn't sure if you really rolled it up, but it seemed to work fine that way. I chopped the salami fine, as well as the peppers. I also finished it on a pizza stone. -David

I was just at a restaurant in Minneapolis this week that served Stromboli with chicken, bleu cheese, toasted walnuts and roasted pears. It was very good. I am going to try and copy it sometime soon. This recipe was good but liked the one at Palomino Restaurant much better.

Fantastic and a great place to start for variations. Used a loaf of frozen bread dough, but will try with some from my bread machine next for a faster solution. I only had enough provolone and salami for one and added some mozzerella. The other three I made with a mixture of ricotta, spinach, some garlic powder, parmigiano,shredded mozzerella and slices of prosciutto - but the possibilities are endless. They do need a dipping sauce and the simple pizza sauce on this site is perfect (the very simple one with only reduced crushed tomatoes in puree and olive oil- I did add some garlic cloves, basil and red pepper flakes but not sure they are necessary with all of the flavors in the stromboli). A definite keeper-enjoyed by teenagers especially and a nice break from delivery pizza!

The husband of someone I taught with made this with some sort of marinated chicken, as well as other things. When cut into, a cheesy cream sauce oozed out. It was delicious, and I'd prefer to do that rather than the salami-version. Does anyone have a recipe?

Rating: 4
I've made this a few times now. Definitely serve with a warm marinara for dunking or pouring over. I've found that fancy cheese doesn't really make a difference so don't waste the money. I experimented with a few versions and I also saw little difference between using expensive prosciutto and shaved ham. Pinch the ends well or cheese leeks everywhere. The store-made dough will typically come out thicker than than the pillsbury, though both are fine. A nice touch is to throw a fair amount of cheese on top of the dough before baking.

This recipe is simple and delicious. I used fresh dough purchased at a local pizza restaurant, and served with marinara sauce on the side. It was a hit!

I made this recipe for my son's b-day party (40 people). I made mostly salami/provolone stromboli and made about 4 chicken and 4 ham. The chicken (precooked and seasoned strips) came out fine but the ham (chopped lunchmeat ham slices)stromboli created too much liquid and ruined the dough. The dough I used was from my local Italian grocer and came out great! I should've bought my salami there too because the grocery salami was too greasy and bland. Next time I will try other dry meats such as proscuitto and pepperoni. The stromboli MUST be served with a tomato sauce.

This is a great weeknight recipe. I served it with pizza sauce and a garden salad. I couln't find frozen pizza dough, so I used the canned variety. It was too glutinous and difficult to roll- and was done after 15 minutes. Next time, I'll go to a speciality store for the real thing and will add thinly sliced onions. Great recipe!

Yum! Great to improvise. I made a double recipe and they were such a hit with my family. I made some with mozzarella and ham, some I skipped the roasted peppers with and they were great. Another time I made them and froze the leftovers. They were fine too!

Really Good! I made some as written, and some with pepperoni, and some capicollo, All were good, served with warm marinara sauce for dipping.

It was good but needed a kick. . .perhaps a spicy, whole-grain mustard spread on the dough? Don't know but I'll tinker with it 'til it's to our liking.

Who would have thought? A great Friday-night meal. These were delicious. I served them with a cheddar soup recipe from Cook's Magazine and decided not to care how fattening the whole thing was. My boyfriend loved them, and later my friends came over and ate the leftovers straight out of the fridge. I think they would even be good without the red peppers, and next time I'll buy the best salami I can find.

Believe it or not, this is almost identical to a "Mr. Food" recipe that I have been using for years! Only real difference is that he used a Pillsbury French Bread (you know, the one in the tube can) and unrolled it, and used mozzarella instead of provolone. Either way, it's good eats.

I had so much fun with this recipe! I made my own dough, too. I added some Italian spices I had and salt. It was easy and inexpensive to run by the store on the way home from work and buy the sliced salami and provolone. My husband loved it, too. It tasted great the next day for lunch. We will definitely make this again!

GREAT!! We loved this, especially our kids. I followed the recipe for the adults, but made a kid friendly version too, with ham, mozzarella, and some pizza sauce. It only needed to cook for 10 min. Refrigerator pizza dough isn't available here, so we made our dough. Outstanding!!!

echoing what the first reviewer from CT said about making this for super bowl parties, in my family we have been making this for stanley cup finals since i was a wee thing. we always called them pepperoni rolls and made them with mozzarella and oregano. either way you make them, they are outrageously good.

This is simple, simple, simple. Great for a weeknight dinner - and there are so many possible variations on fillings. I did not find frozen pizza dough. I substituted frozen bread dough, and I only baked these for 25 minutes.

A great recipe to experiment with...adding mushrooms, spinach, canadian bacon. I went the homemade pizza dough route. This didn't make it a quick meal but a tasty one. My only problem was that the provolone made a "run for it" during the baking process. And yes, reduce the baking time. Good stuff!

I DECIDED TO TRY THIS RECIPE BECAUSE I HAD SOME LEFT-OVER SALAMI AND CHEESE. MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH LOVED IT!!! I THINK THE ROASTED BELL PEPPERS ADD A REALLY GOOD FLAVOR TO THE STROMBOLI. THIS RECIPE IS GREAT FOR PICNICS, PARTIES AND IS GOOD HOT OR AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. DEFINATELY A KEEPER!!

I couldn't find frozen pizza dough, but I found a packaged mix that worked just fine. We thought these were awesome family fun food. Better than ordering pizza. Way better. I agree with the other message about watching the time. Mine were ready sooner, too.

Quick-to-make with the use of purchased pizza dough. Very flavorful and easy. I never made stromboli before. I served it with a tomato tortellini and spinach soup for a warming winter meal. They would be great for a Super Bowl party.
