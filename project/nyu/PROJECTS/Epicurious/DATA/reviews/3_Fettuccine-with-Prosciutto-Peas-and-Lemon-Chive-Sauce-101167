I made it vegetarian by using soy bacon (Morningstar Farms brand) instead of the prosciutto. I also used fusilli pasta instead of fettuccine. Delicious and easy!

The lemon was not overpowering, it was delicious

delicious and easy, I am generally not a huge fan of lemon but this is subtle and wonderful!

I thought this dish turned out well - I made some alterations but nothing major....I reserved some extra pasta water and in a separate pan, seared boneless chicken breasts with a portion of the reserved water. Once the chicken was a light pink in the center, I followed the rest of the recipe's instructions for making the cream sauce. The lemon wasn't overpowering in the least, but I personally love food with a little zest. I used light cream to try to make the dish a bit healthier - it still turned out great, even for leftovers a few days later. It's a definite keeper!

I liked this dish very much. I didn't find that the lemon was overpowering as some others had mentioned. It was a quick, inexpensive gourmet meal. However, without salt it can be quite bland.

I used the sauce over ricotta raviolis made with soy won ton wrappers. While this may be a bit heavy on the fat side - it's a nice treat on within the low carb diet!

Per previous suggestions, I used slightly less lemon juice (maybe 2 t.) + added about 2 T. of a wasabi mustard laced mayonnaise. Excellant! Very delicate flavor. Will definately do again.

Despite the above rave reviews, I made this recipe and thought it was awful. I found the acidity of the lemon paired with creamy sauce jarring. Try at your own risk.

this was fast and easy. very good but a little more lemony then I expected. I used linguini because I like thinner pasta.

This is a easy and fast recipe. However, when doubling it, use less lemon as it over powers the other flavors. White pepper would be better than black too. This is a children friendly dish!
