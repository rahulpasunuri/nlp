I love this recipe, such a wonderful way to make acorn squash. I didn't have any currants so I used golden raisins and apple cider instead of apple juice. Simple and so tasty.

Yummy, a beautiful presentation, and not that hard to make! I used a combination of pears and apples for the filling. The filling was the star of the dish. I'll definitely pull out this recipe the next time I have guests that need to be impressed.

Yuh-hum! I received two acorn squash from my organic co-op and had no idea what to do with them. I accidentally cut them in wedges instead of circles so they were a little thicker. I just put them in the oven for 20 minutes without the stuffing so they could soften up a bit, then stuffed them and baked for the 40 minutes. Had to sub dates for the currants and Gala apples but it was still fantastic. Served with spiced lentils & jasmine rice. We also sprinkled it with Sriracha for a spicy-sweet dish. Would definitely make again.

My whole family loved this. I did use cranberries instead of currants and roasted the squash while everything else was cooking. It was delicious.

Really enjoyed this hearty side dish with proscuitto wrapped chicken breasts and salad. Went light on the curry to appeal to kids and added diced fennel. Also decided to cut prep time by baking the squash rings unfilled while the other ingredients sautéed. Just used olive oil vs curry butter on the squash, cooked for about 20 minutes while remaining ingredients sautéed, then filled rings and cooked for about 20 minutes more. Texture and final look was great. Will make again soon.

Presentation = 4 forks, but the flavor just didn't do it for us. I'm not a curry fan, but this was intriguing enough to try. Beautiful, but disappointing.

My friend made this last night and it was a huge hit. I will definitely be making this very soon!

Awesome idea to get the family to eat squash, which they usually flee from whenever they hear the word. I've made this a few times and have substituted dried cranberries for the currants and used garam masala instead of curry powder. All variations are excellent, although they took about an hour to bake.

The curry makes this dish! Usually I just baste with butter, brown sugar and amaretto, and was looking for something different. This was easy and delicious; my wife and I give 4 thumbs up!

Excellent way to get the family to eat squash! Plus, it is easy to amend with different spices or ingredients. Our favorite version uses Chinese Five Spice powder instead of Curry powder, dried cranberries instead of dried currants, and finally apple cider instead of apple juice. My single complaint is that the squash took about an hour to cook, instead of the 40 minutes listed in the recipe.

Wow! Delicious! We both loved this recipe! I used half apples, half pears for the fruit filling which was really yummy (that's what I had on hand) and used mango/peach/Orange Juice bc I didn't have any apple juice. It turned out wonderful as it must be wi the original ingredients. I served it w some red lentils and a salad. Great dinner and like many said beautiful presentation. Will experiment next time w other fruit that may curry well as other reviewers suggested. A definite do it again!

Great recipe! I think next time I make it I would add mangos to the mix and possibly some nutmeg. Otherwise really good.

Like other reviewers have noted, stunning presentation. I've made it several times, but almost never make it with squash (I know, blasphemy!). Instead, I double the amount of filling and serve it over flavored brown rice as a "fruit curry." I set up a toppings bar with green onions, coconut, and toasted nuts, and my husband and I dig in. It makes for a great weeknight dinner, and the leftovers travel well to work the next day.

This is just a favorite for being extremely tasty as well as beautiful on the plate. Have served it even as a rather nontraditional side dish for Thanksgiving. There is a lot of butter in the recipe and I usually don't put that much in it. The Granny Smith apples give it a little tang, but they mellow when cooking. I've used this recipe as a jumping off place for other squash improvisations.

oh man, this was tasty, and super easy to make! i made several mods that worked out surprisingly well: added mushrooms, used orange juice and soy instead of apple juice (didn't have any), and added some chili powder. mmm mmm good!

I have to give this recipe a perfect score for presentation - it's absolutely gorgeous! It was also surprisingly easy to prepare and reheated quite well. Although curry isn't a flavor I'm a fan of and I could see myself trying this recipe out with some cinnamon and nutmeg in the future, I am giving it four forks because my boyfriend placed this recipe in his top ten favorites that I've made for him (which is a really big deal!). I will definitely be making this again... next time I'll make sure I'm having over company I really want to impress!

I'm a big fan of acorn squash as part of a Thanksgiving spread. This dish, with curry spice and currants, lends an exotic edge to the meal, though will go nicely with other traditional dishes. Would be excellent if served with a lamb entree during fall and winter months (see Tamarind-Honey Lamb Kebabs on Epicurious). My only suggestion is to cut down on the amount of currants - their flavor is necessary to the recipe but you can achieve it with 2/3 the amount, maybe even 1/2.

I realized that our typically bland Thanksgiving fare would bore our guests from India, so I added this to the menu. It was delicious; everyone loved it. Easy to make; I prepared it just as the recipe dictates, but made sure to use good quality curry powder.

I was asked to make this recipe again this year; big hit. My question is: can I make them the day before and reheat them? Someone said the next day they had more flavor. I know some people think they're bland & I want to avoid that.

350 was too high the top of the stuffing was slightly burned and the acorn squash was very firm (uncooked).

I didn't care for this at all, and my husband thought it was so-so. Too sweet for my taste. That said, we couldn't find currants at Trader Joe's so we just used a mix of dried cherries, blueberries and strawberries. Maybe that's why I felt it was too sweet. Also, the texture came out a little too soft and mushy for me. Not enough savory flavor for me.

Not exciting and bland.

This was extremely good and I was sorry I didn't have a fat crispy pork chop to go with it. I was cooking for one, so I used one acorn and filled the halves with one large apple and half an onion mixture. Also, I only had raisins on hand, so in they went. No currants. I did sprinkle some brown sugar in the bottoms along with the curry butter before filling because I knew I'd end up eating most of the filling first, leaving a bland acorn squash behind. I'm going to work on tweaking the recipe so I can use less butter, and I'm looking forward to trying it with craisins next time!

I absolutely loved this! And so did the whole family, even a skeptical Dad. I used cherry juice. My only suggestion would be to double the filling and sprinkle a little sugar on the squash before cooking. I will definately be making this again soon. The best acorn squash recipe I've tried so far.

Great dish! I used dried cherries instead of currants. Everyone thought it was cranberries. Added a little brown sugar to the filling to sweeten it up a bit. As someone else did, I would stuff halves next time as stuffing tends to come out of the rings.

This is an "exceptional" dish that graced my Thanksgiving table. My mother was very impressed with it and called it "company- worthy". It's presentation is gorgeous and it was easier to make than I originally thought. Definitely something to try on the holidays.

Wonderful! Made this as part of Thanksgiving dinner and as previous reviews suggested, used half olive oil and half butter. It was a huge hit, especially since my guests were either from the UK or had lived there and were curry fans. I'll make this again!

Made this last night, subbed raisins for the currants. A very tasty dish and it looks great on a the plate (there were a couple of oohs and aahs). I suggest using an extra apple so the filling can be a rounded mound. Great with poultry or pork.

excellent and very well received by dinner guests, even one who doesn't like squash. our one year old and theirs liked it, too. i sauteed the onions in a Tbsp of olive oil instead of butter; used orange-peach-mango juice instead of apple juice; used chopped dried cherries instead of currants; and reduced the curry butter to just 3 Tbsp and brushed it on all surfaces of the squash, none on the stuffing. will make it again soon!

I had to substitute cranberries for currants, but it still came out delicious. Next time I will probably use either less butter, or replace the butter with olive oil or ghee.

A great Fall treat. From now on I'll plan on more stuffing than the recipe calls for-- Today when I made this, I had just one squash but it wasn't very fleshy, so a full batch of the stuffing filled the rings perfectly. I use olive oil, not butter (and reduce the quantity). Okay to use raisins, but stick to the granny smiths for their tartness.

A tradition for our family. These are not only delicious, but beautiful on the table. I will cut back on the butter a bit, but it is perfect otherwise.

I'd never cooked an acorn squash before. This dish came out great and was easy to prepare. Made it as written except used a combo of raisins/dried cranberries instead of currants, since that is what I had on hand.

Rating: 4
Wonderfully aromatic! For those of use who are calorie conscious: the filling can be sauteed in just 1 tsp butter without sticking. It's also easy to negate the need for so much butter to keep the squash moist in the oven by instead microwaving it for 6 minutes, then putting in the oven for ten minutes more with just a little bit of heavily-curried butter. This shall become a regular and is a great launching pad for fun variations. Cranberries instead of currants next?

I've made this dish numerous times and my guests always love it! I add quite a bit of cinnamon to the curry and it always makes for some delicious flavors. The squash is a little hard to cut, but it's still great.

I tried this based on other reviewers' comments and it didn't knock my socks off. I used the hotter curry powder, but still was luke warm about the dish compared to all the other things I prepare. I'm pureeing the left overs today for a soup and adding chicken broth and a little fresh thyme.

Heeding the warnings of other reviewers stating this dish smelled good but tasted bland, I used Mauritian curry. It was fabulous! Anything but bland. I think the key to this dish is to use a hot curry.

The presentation of this dish is quite pretty. I actually didn't think it had as much flavor as I was expecting. I used Turkish curry powder so maybe I needed to use a bit more. On the whole, a very nice dish, I just needed to adjust the seasoning.

This is now a fall favorite. My husband and I both love the combination of curry, raisins, squash and butter. Watch the baking time closely, sometimes 40 minutes is too much. Nice when accompanied with wild or brown rice.

This dish was wonderful. I made it for a potluck dinner party so instead of doing the rings, I cut up the squash into cubes and put the sauce over it to bake in large baking dish. It was very easy this way and I'm sure it tasted just as good! I also used butternut squash instead of acorn. Someone who doesn't like vegetables had seconds of this!

Very beautiful, but a lot of work for not much taste. I prepared them and took them to a dinner party to cook there. The oven was finicky and the squash never cooked quite right. The filling and curry butter are nice though. I will use them in another recipe.

This was almost too lovely to eat! I had a large party, and served this as the side dish, you would think it was the main dish!! Everyone raved, I loved the Green skin of the squash and the Gold of the curry, very pretty. The apples and onions and curry are a great combination, making this a very versatile dish, I used it next to a Pork dish, and think it would go well with a roasted Chicken, Beef ETC.
