This is really flavorful-- the lemon taste just pops. However, four minutes is way too long to cook the asparagus...I would say 2 minutes. Other than that, it's great.

Very good! But yes, be careful not to overcook the asparagus.

I'm not generally a big fan of certain vegetables, and this recipe made the asparagus absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe as is and I can't wait to make it again!

Nice twist to typical asparagus. 4 minutes for crisp- tender is too long. It's nice that it can be made ahead because the last step is a snap.

Excellent, easy, and quite pretty.

A great, simple dish. In our variation, we wrapped 4 stalks with a 2" wide slice of Proscuitto, tied them together with lemon peel and topped with freshly grated Romano. We served it with a mixed grill of Tuna steak, Salmon steak and a Blackened Shrimp Skewer with French Market Rice and it was scrumptous. Everyone makes a good recommendation to taste the lemon level as you go.

Tasty. I reduced the butter to 1 Tbs., and served it with shavings of fresh Parmesan--definitely adds another dimension of richness and flavor. Enjoyed by all & done all within 15 min.

I made this for a special dinner (though I cut the recipe in half). I really enjoyed this recipe - and I don't like asparagus. It was a big hit.

One word. Yuck. The lemon completely overpowered the flavor of the asparagus.

Simple accompaniment for asparagus. Watch to ensure you don't burn the lemon peel/garlic. Light and easy!

This was the best asparagus I have ever eaten. The only thing I did differently was not add the lemon juice (frankly because I forgot to!) and found that it was plenty lemon-y without it. The lemon peel provided enough flavor on its own. A perfect compliment to meatloaf and mashed potatoes!

Just so-so.

I am a 11-year old, and this dish was pretty easy. The lemon peel was kind of crispy, which made it good! My brother liked it, and the lemon juice tastes so good, so it makes the dish tastier if you add more!

I have made this twice and it is wonderful. Made it last night for a Christmas party for 20 that I catered & everyone loved it. The only thing I do differently is I don't parboil the asparagus, I steam it instead for about 3 minutes.

I cooked this for a dinner party and boiled the asparagus the day ahead, as the recipe suggested. It came out great and I'll definitely make this again. I served this with Chicken Crepes.

I am very careful about the rating of the recepies on this site as I reley on all of those that try them to rate them accordingly. That said, I made this for a small dinner party and it was perfect. I do agree that the 4 minutes in parboil stage is too long and I would leave in 2-3 at the most.

Lovely, simple topping for asparagus. We were making the shrimp & spinach risotto that went with it in the magazine (also very good), had some asparagus on hand, and happened to notice this. Very nice.

I cooked this as an accompaniment to the lamb souvlaki sandwiches in Gourmet's April issue and it was a big hit. I cooked it again to accompany salmon and used olive oil instead of butter, and liked it even better, a smoother, healthier, yummier flavor.

I found this recipe in Bon Appetit to give to my boyfriend to make for a potluck, since he was assigned a vegetable side dish. It was very good -butter, fresh parsley and lemon all make the dish taste very fresh, even if the asparagus was a little overcooked (so I agree with the previous review that the cooking time was too long). Everyone at Easter dinner liked it.

I liked this recipe but my husband was indifferent. Said the garlic overpowered that great asparagus flavour. Also, to me, 4 mins is way too long to blanch asparagus; I only cooked for 2 mins and it was perfect. Will definitely make again. Nice side dish to a variety of entrees.

I'm not a chef like the rest of you, and I was able to successfully create this dish. It was yummy, but I would use a little less lemon next time. -Sara, the "uncook"

EXCELLENT! I did add a bit more lemon juice than suggested, but that is to my taste. This is the perfect addition to compliment the peppered lamb with pine nut sauce from Bon Appetit November 1997! We will have this time and time again, tonight included.

This is a great way to prepare asparagus. I Loved the freshness of the gremolata with it. It compliments the asparagus without overwhelming it. I will definatly make this again.

This is easy and a nice change from the usual asparagus recipes. I used less than one pound of asparagus, but nearly all the amounts called for in the ingredients, except a little less less lemon zest and juice.

Yum! Asparagus in my opinion doesn't need much added flavor because it has so much of its own, so this was a simple and delicious way to serve it. Thought that it was good even without the parsley

This was really great. My wife and guests loved it. I will make it again for sure.

Normally I just use butter and lemon on my aspagigus, but now I am not allowed to do it any other way. This is easy and great. Try it but we warned.
