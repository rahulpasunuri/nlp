I omitted the egg white, added 1/3 C. parmigiana, garlic, parsley, peas, and carrots. I used non fat Greek style yogurt. YUM! Still much healthier then the original.

Grainy and dry. I would not make this again.

I did change this quite a bit: used whole milk yogurt, no ricotta, and a little bit of leftover cream cheese, plus I added some light cream, garlic powder and basil. Simmered it all together and it came out great! Easy to adapt to what you have on hand, which is what I always do anyhow!

To avoid the graininess in texture you could use Quark (a European/Middle Eastern yogurt cheese) instead of ricotta. However, quark will have more fat than the no and low-fat ricottas.

Because this dish is low-fat, I didn't expect it to be rich and creamy but I did expect flavor. It would be greatly improved by garlic and more seasonings as another reviewer wrote but the texture will always be disappointing. I will not make this again.

The only changes I made were all part-skim ricotta and those faux powdered egg whites (w/water); otherwise, I made the recipe as is -- delicious!

I actually haven't tried this recipe, but in response to Houston cook, you can puree the ricotta until smooth to eliminate the chunks! I hope it works well for you.....................

I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with a bowl of pretty tasteless sauce. So I threw in a load of minced garlic (not sure how much, just kept adding until it smelled good), about one-quarter to one-third cup more Parmesan, and more salt and pepper to taste. It was still kind of bland over pasta, but I served it over roasted spaghetti squash with a touch of butter, and the nuttiness of the squash and the butter really pulled it all together. I'll keep playing with the recipe because it's so easy, but I have one plea for advice: the ricotta makes the sauce so grainy! How can I minimize or eliminate the graininess?

Yum! I loved it. I did add a (very large) clove of garlic. What's Alfredo without garlic? Ricotta is the way to go. I can't imagine that cream cheese and sour cream could be substituted. I am italian-american, after all.

Awesome concept to make alfredo without the fat. I have made this recipe several times. I used it as a baseline and added organic milk in addition to the yogurt and used sheep romano instead of the parmesan for a smoother taste. Also lots of garlic! Reheats beautifully and great poured over steamed veggies and pasta. Be sure to stir and watch the sauce as it can be ruined if it starts to get too hot (as the recipe indicates). My kids love this one.

How can Cream Cheese be better then riccota?? Riccota is perferct.

I would substitute cream cheese for the riccota and use sour cream to enhance the flavor. Finishing touches to dish , sprinkle with parsley.
