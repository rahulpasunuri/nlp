I did not like this recipe at all. The flavor was bland and boring and very unsatisfying. I used red kidney beans instead of potatoes, seemed more in tune with the Mexican theme, and I served rice with it. But the real problem is the chilis--the New Mexico Chilis have no kick, you don't even know chilis are in it; I've made stew w/more taste than this. Perhaps if it used guajillo, ancho, or chipotle chilis, it might have had some zip. I tried doctoring this up at the end using Mexican Maggi sauce, then a splash of cider vinegar, all to no good end. Same boring, blah taste. Even fresh cilantro didn't help. Its rare that I am as disappointed in a dish as I was with this one.

Wonderful seasoning in this recipe. It did not yeild as much sauce as I would liked - would add more liquid next time - and might include some red wine, as I think it would be a nice compliment. I also found it confusing about putting everything on baking sheets - as if you're serving right away - you really wouldn't need to heat everything up again - just needs to be kept warm till you cook up the sauce.

The results are delicious but skimming the fat away from the sauce was a tricky and arduous task. The potato to carrot ratio was off. Too many potatoes, not enough carrots. I ordered 5 lbs. of cross cut ribs from the butcher and came home with 11 (not 8) one-inch thick ribs.

This marinade is delicious, savory and not as citrus-forward as I was expecting it to be. I will definitely make this marinade again for a beef roast. Be aware that it is a long process (and a lot of pans) to achieve the optimal result. I do believe that one can marinate the meat overnight and then do all of the cooking in a crockpot. In fact, that is what I will do next time.

I had trouble finding the dried New Mexico chiles so the first time I made this I used Anaheim chiles plus a dried Ancho chile that I rehydrated and seeded. The flavor was very nice but a little too subtle. Then I located a source for the New Mexico chiles -- as well as ground New Mexico chiles -- at Kalustyans here in NYC. I made the dish a second time using the dried chiles, the ground chiles and a few green Anaheims for good measure. The flavor was deep but not overwhelming. Everyone at the seder table wanted seconds! I'll definitely make this again.

Made this for dinner party and it was a real hit. Very easy for doing ahead - only had to plate later after guests arrived. Don't be afraid of the heat of the chilis - I actually added a bit of cayenne at the end to spice it up, but otherwise followed the recipie. If I were to do it again, I think that I would brown the meat first before adding to the broth as the texture came out rather mushy throughout.

This turned out very delicious. I did substitute beef stock for the chicken stock called for in the recipe. I did not strain the sauce, but thickened it with a roux, and served it over soft polenta. Will definitely make again
