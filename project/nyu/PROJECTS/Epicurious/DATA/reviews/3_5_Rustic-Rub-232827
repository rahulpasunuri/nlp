I put a little olive oil on some Delmonico steaks, rubbed a lot of this rub on, squirted a little worcestershire sauce and grilled. Amazing.

Is this the BAM spice that Emeril uses on EVERYTHING? Please let me know what the ingredients are for that spice as well. Thank you

Is this the special spice that Emeril always adds to EVERYTHING with his BAM? Just curious as to the ingredients for his special spice! Thanks to whoever can respond to this.

I've used this rub on slow-roasted checken for years. It's very versatile.

Used this on pork chops. They were great. I left out the garlic powder b/c I don't like it. Am going to try this on chicken next.

This sounds great but it sounds/reads like a variation of Emeril's 'Essence' spice rub
