I confess not to have made the white fish stock due to the time and unavailability of the fish bones/heads, etc. I bought a 4 cup box of Kitchen Basics fish stock and doctored up with some parsely and vermouth. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was a huge hit!

I've made this every Christmas season since 2005. I always use a colored bell pepper instead of green, never use rice (needless carbs in this case), and always add additional seafood, which I throw in for the last couple of minutes before serving. Other seafood options I've used: 1) always a firmer white fish (tilapia); and 2) scallops; clams; and/or crab legs. It all works. One year I set aside some after the roux and used Veg stock for a pure vegetarian, set aside some right before adding seafood (for my wife who eats stock but doesn't like actual meat), and served all three versions, which were all hits!

Served this as a starter for Christmas dinner and it was awesome. Rave reviews across the board.

Wow, this recipe is great! I was looking for something to do with the fish stock in my freezer before moving (a great exercise in finding recipes I wouldn't normally seek out!) and this was perfect! I pretty much followed the recipe to the letter, and I'll do the same next time.

Outstanding! We have made this several times now, often doubling or tripling in quantity. Each time is was a hit and leftovers, if any, are wonderful. Need to try it.

Excellent dish and easy to prepare, A KEEPER. When I try new recipes, I do not substitute ingredients so I can give a true review. I will definitively make it again AS IS.

This was an easy soup and really hit the spot during our current wet January. It was easier using canned diced tomatoes and fish stock made from Knorr fish boullion cubes. If a creamier consistency is desired, you could puree the soup prior to adding the shrimp. An easy mid-week meal.

Delicious - I made the fish stock but I did not cut the shrimp in half as it seemed like an unnecessary step. Rave reviews from all the guests. Made the night before, then reheated and added shrimp prior to serving.

I made this as a first course for Christmas 2004 dinner. I used a little more shrimp than the recipe called for, and I used Penzey's Seafood Soup Base (www.penzeys.com) for my stock. Made the soup and rice ahead as suggested in the recipe, then assembled at the last minute. Excellent soup - got rave reviews and looked beautiful on the holiday table, very festive colors. Will definitely make again.

This was an absolutely wonderful dish. I really enjoyed the cosistancy and texture served over the rice. One addition that I added was Mussels. I added about a dozen just prior to adding the Shrimp so the shrimp wouldn't over cook and the Mussels opened. GREAT hit over Christmas! Everybody loved it!

This is worth the effort. I did make some changes, not that the recipe really needs them, but see what you think: To save time, I substituted two parts clam juice to 1 part fish bouillon (melted in hot water of course), instead of the white fish stock. I doubled the cayenne and garlic, for a little more kick. It's a good idea to warm up some French bread and have some unsalted, room temp butter for dipping, because you'll want to sop up every drop!

Excellent dish! Oh, it was so delicious I am going to cook it for our anniversary. Although, it didn't look the same as the picture. It takes time and efford but it is well worth it.
