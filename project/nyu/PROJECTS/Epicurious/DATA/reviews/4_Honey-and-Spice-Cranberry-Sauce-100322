Absolutely the best cranberry sauce. I use a "spiced cider" - which adds a nice flavor. I also use less liquid 1 1/4 cup and tie the cloves & cinnamon sticks into cheesecloth. This is a favorite and I have shared the recipe with family and friends.

I've made this sauce for the past four Thanksgiving. This year I used 2 cups brown sugar instead of honey just for a little change, and it still tastes fantastic. I use a little less cider than called for, though, otherwise it has to cook for much longer than 15 minutes to thicken to the right consistency. Also I recommend putting the cloves in cheesecloth (or even a coffee filter, tied at the top), as the can be quite difficult to fish out and not pleasant to bite into if you miss one!

A holiday tradition, this cranberry sauce. Although it does take longer than 15 minutes to reduce the apple cider--more like 25. Always good!

This recipe really fits the bill for my perfect cranberry sauce. I've tried all sorts of different recipes over the years and this is the first one that appeals to both cranberry sauce lovers and those who usually pass it up. I added a pinch of fresh ground nutmeg and an extra cinnamon stick and cooked it a little longer than called for so that it wouldn't be runny. For me this recipe really allows cranberry sauce to shine and to fill its role as something you take a tiny bite of in between bites of all the other Thanksgiving fare.

I have used this recipe for a few years now and everyone loves it!! I use the leftover to put over a pork roast and it comes out amazing!!

My first batch went so quickly, I made some more. The first time I used beautiful, fresh cranberries from an organic farm. They were firm and ripe. This time I only had Oceanspray cranberries in the bag. My recipe came out thinner, as other reviewers have mentioned. I think that the softer, old cranberries make for thinner sauce. I'm going to put it back on the stove to boil off some more of the liquid.

This is by far the best cranberry sauce I have ever tasted. Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner was impressed. I made the following changes to the recipe. I omitted the bay leaf. I used 5 cinnamon sticks. I added 1 Tbl of candied ginger, chopped. I made this the night before serving. The flavors melded nicely and it was far better the next day, though good out of the pot. I saw no need to add any thickening agent as other reviewers have said. Upon cooling, it was a perfect consistency.

I've made this 2 Thanksgivings in a row and I've become hooked on the flavor -it's not as sweet as the canned or sugared variety, and I mean this in a good way. My friends and family like it too.

It's because of this recipe that I must now bring cranberry sauce to our families Thanksgiving and Christmas gatherings. I found that using apple juice makes the sauce too sweet, so I only use cider. Also, I make it a day or so in advance so it has more time to thicken. YUMMMMMMM!

Our family loves this! I add 3-4 pieces of chopped crystallized ginger. Yum. I've canned it and given it as a gift!

This is an excellent option for people who don't eat sugar or prefer not to. You don't sacrifice taste either. It's sweet, yet tart. I did not use the bay leaf. I did add corn starch to thicken it, as several other reviewers suggested.

Delicious!!! A great variation is to use orange juice instead of the apple cider. Either way, it's great (and easy).

This sauce was wonderful. I included flour to thicken it. It was so simple I felt guilty serving it to friends. The recipe makes a large quanity of sauce so we froze some to defrost on a night when we needed something quickly ... highly recommend. Loved the sweet and tart taste.

This sauce is amazing! I've tried other more fancy sauces, but I always come back to this one -- for four years now! It's very simple to make and the spices give it a nice holiday taste. And your kitchen will smell great as well!

This sauce was fabulous. I added some flour to thicken it up. It made so much I froze several smaller portions. Each time I've defrosted some, I've gotten rave reviews! A must for those in search of simple ways to spice things up!

A great adaptation of a traditional favourite. This recipe really inspired me to find new ways to use up leftovers! My family really enjoyed it & I will definitely use it for all future turkey fests. I would also recommend for pork!

I've made this sauce for thanksgiving 3 years running with rave reviews each time. I can eat this sauce straight from the pan and even the alleged cranberry haters in my family like this recipe. I also use this as topping for pumpkin bread. So yummy for breakfast!

My whole family loved this sauce. I didn't have apple juice so I used orange juice and left out the orange peel. It was fabulous.

I certainly recommend this, it is very easy to make and improves in texture and taste when you prepare it some days in advance! Really very good!

Everyone loved this one. I made a whole-berry version and also a version where I stuck the cranberries in the food processor before cooking. Both were loved by all.

I can't rate it because I combined this recipe with the Piquant Cranberry Sauce( Bon App- 11/98). Here's what I did (I know, this is a new recipe...). From this recipe I used: the cranberries, apple cider, cinnamon sticks, cloves and bay leaf (refer to amounts above), then I added 1 cup brown sugar and 2 teaspoons dijon mustard. At the end, I added about 1 tablespoon of honey. It was done in about 20 minutes and the consistency was perfect and the flavor was very good, I couldn't stop eating it!

I can't rate it because as it was, it was way too tart. But I did fix it up and then it was great. I added 1 c brown sugar, 1/2 c dry white wine, and about 2 tsp corn starch mixed with a couple of Tbsp of water and then boiled several minutes until thickened. It was a BIG hit.

I doubled this recipe. The cinnamon flavor was a little strong for me. The sauce was not as thick as I like. Perhaps by doubling the recipe the cinnamon became more enhanced, as I allowed additional cooking time.

We made this recipe our family's traditional cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving.

I never liked cranberry sauce until I made this recipe. It is a big hit in all my extended family and I have been making it for several years.

This is simply fabulous! I was never a huge fan of cranberries, but this won me over. A huge hit on Thanksgiving. I was asked to make it again at Christmas. The mix of sweet and spice is perfect!

This is a great replacement to plain cranberry sauce. Place the spices in cheesecloth to save some time fishing them out. You might want to increase the cinnamon for extraordinary flavor.
