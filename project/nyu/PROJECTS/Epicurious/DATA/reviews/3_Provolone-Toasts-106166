This were really top drawer, I must say. Unlike those appalling things Mrs. Burnside served to me, Mums and Dadums last week. Very simple - I would poke some of that Italian ham - I think it's called prosciutto on top of the cheese. Well, actually I wouldn't do it. We hire people for that. Gloria Upson

Muffy and I were at the club this weekend, telling everyone that this is really good. I particularly do really like the thin apple slice idea, and find it even better with a slice of fresh pear. But, á chacun son goût. Cheers, Dinky.

Although this is just a recipe for "cheese toast" (as stated below), I think that this is a good jump-off for adding favorites. I added a thin slice of apple on top of the toast underneath of the provolone. It was a delicious morning treat!

Dear previous reviewer, Thank you so much for that refreshing breath of air. You're right...many people do need to learn the basics of cooking and I think it's great that Epicurious offers recipes that run the gamut of difficulty and complexity. I was beginning to despair that culinary elitists were the only ones who frequent this site. Oh well, at least now they'll have something to tell Muffy and Dinky at the country club and enjoy a laugh at the expense of "the little people".

You may scoff, but for beginning cooks, or those just not familiar, these short but simple instructions provide guidance on something they would be embarrassed to ask a friend. For instance, I would not necessarily have thought to toast the bread first. And some may not consider provolone. Please be more understanding of other people's lack of experience.

Hmmmm, a recipe for cheese toast. I can't wait to read the reviews this will spark.
