I wanted to like this. Love all of the ingredients, but I ended up throwing a big bowl of it away after my party where almost no one ate it. What a waste of good ingredients. Followed the recipe to a T and the dressing turned watery on the salad and had no taste. The whole thing was a watery, bland mess.

I only made the dressing as many other reviewers said it was good. The dressing is delicious, but the mayo flavor is the strongest so I added some lemon juice to balance the flavors. Next time I might add an extra bulb of garlic.

When I first saw this recipe I thought mmm, it sounds delicious with all the different flavours that could mingle together. I have to admit, I was rather disappointed with the end results. The dressing was delicious, but I feel like the layered salad needs some revisions. To me the beans seemed out of place with the rest of the flavours, it also made the salad a lot heavier too. I don't know what to suggest that for me, would make it better, but I doubt I will be making it again.

The dressing was fantastic. I also loved the salad, even though I would leave out the fennel in the future, maybe swap it out for some endive. the dressing was really the star of the show-- can't wait to use it on other summer salads.

I have made this salad as is, but I make the dressing for other salads and it is truly exceptional. Great flavor if you want a creamy dressing and can stand the fat and calories associated!

Didn't love this salad. The dressing is pretty good, but overall our dinner party was underwhelmed.

Great salad for entertaining. I used sliced radishes instead of fennel which gave a nice added bite. I had no basil on hand so I used fresh thyme. LOVED that dressing and would definitely make it again.

This is a great salad for summer! Super easy and so fresh tasting. I made it exactly according to the recipe. I had a lot left over and it was even better the next day. Since the dressing sits on the top, the veggies underneath say nice and fresh. The only thing I would change is to use cannellini beans instead of garbanzo. This one's a keeper!
