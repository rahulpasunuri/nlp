It was ok. I used thyme and rosemary. I think the shallot part is what I didn't like.

I made this with fresh rosemary and it was delicious. Everyone kept going back for more and it was gone quickly. Yum!

Loved this. My fiancee kept going back for more, so this is a definate winner. Serve it with a beet salad to really impress. Add a tiny bit of fresh garlic to add a kick.

What a wonderful recipe! Don't worry about which herbs.... but definitely try to have as many as possible because the goat cheese can stand up to them, and the variety gives complexity. I found that I wanted more of the whipped cream for a very velvety spreading cheese, but that's just a personal preference.

This was easy--used basil and chives from the garden. Found that it is better if made ahead so that the flavors from herbs have time to develop.

Made with tarragon, basil and chives for a summer pool party. Lot's of compliments. Easy and delicious!

This was so easy and so delicious. I make with any herb I have on hand. The whipped cream makes it so light. A dollop of this on fresh watermelon salad is excellent too. No leftovers, ever.

Delicious! I used dill, parsley and chives and everyone loved it. There's no end to the variety of flavours with different herbs and the whipped cream makes it have a light texture. A definite keeper!

This is a great recipe, goat cheese is great on it's own but the addition of the whipping cream makes it creamier and very spreadable.

Try topping the cheese with some chopped roasted red and yellow peppers.

Delicious. Lots of praise from guests. I substituted green onions. I'll bet it would have been even better with shallots.

I used lots of dill, parsley, basil, chives and it was amazing. Luckily I had a just the right amount of whipped cream on hand and I will say that the addition led to a light, creamy texture. Family couldn't get enough.

I enjoyed this recipe and it was really tasty, however I would recommend using more dynamic herbs than I tried. I used basil and tarragon, as that was what I had on hand, but the flavor seemed to get lost somewhere along the line. Next time I will use stronger herbs!

YUM, I used medium aged goat cheese, but is was still awesome, Perfect starter with drinks, and it held up well on the deck on a warm summer evening.

Try this with Feta cheese - also works very well. Add some olive oil and black pepper. Mmm.
