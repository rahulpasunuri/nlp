I have made this numerous times and it is always good. Please notice this is only one dish in a Beat the Heat summer menu, the other dishes of tomates, green beans etc. are what I think makes the whole meal memorable. Each dish complements each other dish and makes everything better.

Ah yes, Chicken Tonnato: A very good substitiute for the veal in this classic-type recipe. Do try it.

Perfect for summer!

As is, this dish was a disappointment. The best way I found to serve it was to cut the chicken into bite-size chunks and serve it over fresh spring greens. I think it could also benefit from additional basil. And don't forget those olives -- they added a lot.

Served this last night. We loved it. As someone suggested,this would make a great dish to serve to friends on a buffet. Despite having to prepare it ahead it is quite an easy recipe. and it is true about it being difficult to mess up as I too used boneless breasts - it still turned out quite yummy.

This is a terrific way to prepare chicken breast. The method of poaching it on the bone and letting it cool in the cooking liquid ensures the chicken is oh-so-tender and moist. Everyone was impressed, and the sauce was nice, too.

This was outstanding, very similar to vitello tonnato, only cheaper and easier. I used boneless breasts because that's all I had, and left out the anchovies (none on hand) and it was still delicious, which leads me to conclude that this is one recipe you can't mess up!

Good recipe. Great for a Buffet. I will make it again.
