I love this recipe, but found out the first time that it is very salty. I've solved this by soaking the olives overnight in freshwater to leach some of the salt out of them (reserve the brine). I drain them well and prepare as directed. As a last step, I blend some of the brine back in to taste.

I agree with Arlington; this tapenade was too acid. The lemon juice could probably be subbed for with just some lemon zest, though I've just added the honey as recommended by Manhattan Beach and it improved quite a bit. I'd also increase the amount of toasted almonds a bit in the future.

It drives me nuts when people give a negative review but have modified the recipe beyond recognition. That said, I'm giving this recipe an extremely positive review...w/ some modifications. I love tapenade and checked out lots from this website and made what are, to my taste, some good additions: 1 lg. garlic clove, 1 scant Tbs. drained capers, fresh thyme from several sprigs (maybe 2 tsp total), 1 1/2 tsp honey and a liberal dose of white pepper. I honestly don't remember if I added a squeeze of anchovy or not... Berate me if you must, but my guests and I thought it was terrific!

This was very easy to make and scrumptious. The leftovers kept in the refrigerator for a long time.

This was a little too briny for me. I made it for a party, and everyone seemed to like it. I think I was expecting a milder flavor, particularly with all the almonds in there.

Great! Made with green olives stuffed with pimento and dropped olive oil to 1/4. Also left chopped rather than making a paste. Served on asiago bread topped with tapenade and a bit of parmesan and warmed in oven, bruschetta-like.

This was a great tapenade; a little milder than a traditional black olive one. I made it for a party and it was a hit, plus it was very easy to make.

I made this for a cocktail party and it turned out very good. It keeps well in the refrigerator.
