Really delicious, really easy. Great way to use leftover roast beef. I liked the different layers of chili flavors - chili powder, red pepper flakes, chipotle, black pepper. I will make this again and again!

OK, but maybe a little too tomatoe paste-y with all that paste and crushed tomatoes. I have also never seen a chili recipe with only 2 teaspoons (really? 2 tsp?) of chili powder. I used some Ancho chili powder as well, plus threw in a dried guajillo for emphasis. Still found things a little thick so added some red wine as well. Then as things were simmering, I thought: how can there be no kidney beans (or other beans) and so added some. Ended up with a slightly different receipe, I guess, but I would have found this to be just a meet stew without the adds.

Chili is indeed Mexican, but I don't think any Mexican would recognize this as chili. Does sound good, though, and easy.

Sounds great but I am not sure why it is under Mexican food. Chili's not Mexican.

This is based on The Silver Palate's recipe called Chili for a Crowd and it is fabulous! Everyone loves it. You can use regular hamburger instead of leftover roast beef. Add a little lemon juice and fennel seeds for a punch!
