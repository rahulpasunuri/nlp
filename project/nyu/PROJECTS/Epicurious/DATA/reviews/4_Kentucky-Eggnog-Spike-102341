This is a wonderful addition to eggnog and is great by itself too! I made two batches and served one last year at a Christmas party. The second was amazing after aging for one year. We finished it with friends and relatives before the holiday even arrived! Eggnog will never again be served without this spike on offer too in my house!

I replaced one shot of bourbon with rum, I was a bit concerned because it seemed like a lot of alcohol but it is amazingly subtle. Well worth doing - and I agree with another poster, make double and keep what is left over, I am sure it will be great for other cooking and the occasional late night 'liqueur'.

I use 1 cup Canadian Whiskey (Crown) and 1 cup bourbon (Jack or Makers) instead of 2 cups bourbon. I also add a little more vanilla than the standard. It's a HUGE hit with everyone who drinks it. I like 1 shot of this spike, 1 shot of ginger ale and 1.5 shots of eggnog. If this doesn't make your holiday party, I don't know what will

Just whipped up seven bottles, smells awesome, I'll let you know if I hear anything back from the recipients. It would be helpful to have the pour measured in "parts" as opposed to cups.

Made this for Christmas gifts last year and it was a big hit. Everybody wanted the recipe! I saved one bottle to see if it will get better with age. We'll find out at Christmas!

Made a quick variant of this for our holiday open house (I only found the recipe the day of the party, so didn't have time let it rest), but I still couldn't keep the eggnog in stock. I will definitely make this further in advance next year, and I'll be making extra for Xmas gifts.

Delicious! I made a very large batch and we finished it all!

I made this recipe 2 years ago for my family in Sydney Australia. We had some terrible fires that year so we had to postpone Christmas. I still have the spike in my living room and the aroma is delightfull. I suggest making 2 servings and keep the other for a longer time. It's wonderful

This wonderful holiday recipe has become a favorite of my family and friends. It is amazing how little the amount you need to make the eggnog delicious! FYI - Always make this receipe a few months before the holidays and it will be perfect for consumption!

Um - for the cook from Pennsylvania 12/01 - I'm having trouble picturing why s/he would have bothered with an alcohol-based recipe when his/her preference is for NON-alcoholic? Sounds like a delicious spike recipe to me and my husband - have to try it.

I mixed up three batches of this last night and it smells so wonderful that I am confident in giving it a high rating. I WILL save some for myself.

I 'm very excited to try it. I can tell by the recipe that somebody's secret recipe isn't a secret anymore. ;-)Sounds scrumptious! This year Christmas will be a very Merry one as eggnog is a favorite of friends and family alike. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I made this over the summer and have given it to several friends as an early holiday gift. The alcohol continues to absorb the spices, even after several months. This is not a subtle liquor and, although some friends enjoy sipping it, it is most heavenly in eggnog, added to whipped cream and baked goods, and my favorite, added to coffee. I am already receiving requests for more next year.

Prefer non-alcoholic

I made (4) of these as gifts and the recepients were very excited about a 'homemade' gift. The suggestion of fresh nutmeg and grater was a lovely touch and made it very festive. I had an eggnog with the spike with one of my recipients and it was excellent! I intend to make it again next year, my only regret I didn't save one for myself.

I can't wait to try this. I found it when I was looking for eggnog cookies. I'm from Kentucky and am going "home" for Christmas and will have to try this out then.

One of my friends loves this so much he drinks it as a shot. It makes an excellent Christmas gift.

This is an excellent spike for those who like a warm spicy addition to their holiday nog. The spiciness increases with time- my sister said her best batch yet was a bottle she'd had standing for a year. I found this recipe 3 years ago and have made it every holiday season since for family and friends. It never fails to please in a big way.
