Great recipe but Definately fold Ice Cream in after whipping cream. I served it with a little Cinnamon sprinkled on it. I also added Fresh blueberries. Yum!

The ingredients are correct, but the method of preparation is not. Mix the berries with sugar and Grand Marnier or Cointreau, then let sit to macerate. Whip the cream and fold in the softened ice cream. Serve the creams over the macerated berries.

I loved this dessert and so did all of my guests. It is light, refreshing and perfect for a summer dessert. Goes well with almost any meal. For extra strawberry flavor, I use straberry ice cream. It also makes a beautiful presentation when served in clear glass bowls.

Yuck. Whatever happened to old-fashioned romanoff? This was more like a milkshake.

whipped cream didn't whip once I added the strawberries/cointreau. Tasted good but was more like a romanoff soup...I would make this again but would whip the cream separately then add strawberries

This is one of my favorite "to impress" desserts. I have made it several times and developed and even SHORTER short cut. While the berries are macerating, I use cool whip and softened ice cream. Same texture, just a bit easier. I've also used orange juice instead of the liquors when I'm serving to children. Works well as a low-carb dessert too - use sugar free ice cream.

Easy and delicious. To Greensboro, NC: I don't know what your definition of "experienced cook" is, but I had no trouble with this and I am one of those "can't boil water" people. If you let the berries macerate for an hour, they will absorb most of the liquid. It is to be served at once.

Delicious and easy. It also makes a nice presentation. It would be good with angelfood cake too.

I had no problem with this recipe except that the 12 minutes given for beating the strawberries and cream is way off. I think it was meant to be 1-2 minutes. Beat until you get the results you're looking for (thickening and soft peaks). If you go the 12 minutes, you'll have a liquidy mess. Also, make sure the ice cream is definitely softened enough to be fold in. You'll need to put it in the refrigerator earlier than the recipe indicates. My husband loves this and it's very easy to make.

I was looking forward to serving this classic using our fresh, local strawberries. It was a total disaster. I feel the directions are inadequate and I am a very experienced cook. Do you drain the strawberries before beating with the whipping cream? Can it be made ahead? Freeze? Refrigerate? It is a good thing I have a sense of humor and that my guests know this is not my usual fare.
