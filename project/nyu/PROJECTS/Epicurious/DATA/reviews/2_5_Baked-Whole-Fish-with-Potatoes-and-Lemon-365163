I used branzino, substituted fresh rosemary and chopped garlic for the parsley and only used 2 lemons. It was extremely easy and makes a nice presentation. This got a "thumbs up" from my family.

We really enjoyed this. I used red potatoes that had a nutty flavor to them, and parcooked them for longer than suggested, about 25 minutes at 350. I used a large cod filet (was feeding 4) and placed that on top of the potatoes for another 25, and turned up oven to 400 at that point. The lemons were a great touch to the potatoes. Used chives instead of bay leaves. There were no leftovers. Served it with an arugula salad with parmesan, and sauteed mushrooms.

Was pretty disappointed with this recipe. My husband, who eats all kinds of different fish thought it was a bomb. I cooked my fish for 35 minutes on top of the potatoes as specified and it was over done. Maybe others will have better go of it than I.
