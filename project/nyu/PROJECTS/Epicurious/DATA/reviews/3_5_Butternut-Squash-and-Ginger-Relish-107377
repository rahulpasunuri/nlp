This recipe was a crowd pleaser. The first time I made it I almost followed the recipe step by step with the exception of the ginger. I used 1 tablespoonful of fresh grated ginger. In the future, to make this even better I would make a few alterations. First, I would use more fresh ginger by increasing the amount called for to 2 tablespoonsful. Also when stirring the vinegar and sweetner together I added the fresh grated ginger to improve incorporation of the ginger flavor into the relish. Next, I would reduce the sugar called for by one-half or substitute honey using 1/8th cup honey vs. 1/4th cup of sugar. Lastly, I made the relish the day before to allow all of the juices (vinegar and sweetner) to be adsorbed and picked up into the butternut squash. Finally make sure you turn the relish a few times while it is chilling to enhance the distribution of the flavors.

I expected much more from this recipe - it has ingredients that I love. The texture of the squash was distracting to the flavors.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! It added a unique but extremely complementary flavor to our traditional meal. I plan to make it again this year.
