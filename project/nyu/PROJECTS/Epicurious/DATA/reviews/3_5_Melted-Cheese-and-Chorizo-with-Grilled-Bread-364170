Though the recipe title is uninspired, this app is anything but. The flavors are terrific and it's super easy to put together in advance & bake later. I baked this in a (single) 7x11" dish and served it w/ crostini rubbed with garlic. I was afraid the cheese & chorizo would stick together & I'd be left with an un-eaten dish of onions & leeks so I stirred the chorizo into the onion/leek mixture, which worked well. This is fabulous!

I would make it again, but would omit the onions/leeks. Even with the milder chorizo - the onions were undistinguishable.
