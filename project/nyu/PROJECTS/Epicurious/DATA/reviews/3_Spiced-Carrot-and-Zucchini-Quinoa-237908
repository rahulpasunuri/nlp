I started making this with the orange date pot roast from the same section of the April 2007 Bon Appetit but it's so good I often make it on its own. I do leave off the cilantro.

I ignored reviews from other users about how bland this dish is and were they ever proven right! I did not have pecans on hand as had been recommended by others, I just stuck to the recipe as written, and it was incredibly dull. Not bad, just dull.

This is good food. Not a dish that wowed me especially though. It's more of a basic, solid addition to the range of quinoa dishes you might come back to.

I made the recipe as written for a family gathering of 10 and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. The small dice of carrots and zucchini, sauted until just cooked were not lost in the dish and had great flavor from the sweet Hungarian paprika, cinnamon and currents. I did make it in advance and then chill it, baked with foil cover and then re-fluffed it. That may have blended the flavors better. I served it with skin-on boneless chicken breasts marinated with the "Only marinade you will ever need" Epicurious recipe and fresh bread. We'll make this again for sure.

quinoa is a staple in Ecuador, my family's origin, hence to those who say it's bitter, you must not only rinse quinoa well, but scrub it in your hands while rinsing. If its bitter, it was not washed well enough.

ok, after reading other reviews and NEVER liking quinoa, I did the following and it was fantastic: cut the quinoa to 1 cup and used 2 1/2 cups water. Sauteed the carrots and zucchini, which were small diced, until golden. Used SMOKED paprika, not sweet, and SAIGON cinnamon. Finished with the toasted pecans that were then chopped (great suggestion from a previous reviewer) and used Italian flat leaf parsley, not cilantro. You must, without question, rinse the quinoa well prior to use, no exceptions. This is excellent cold as well as a light lunch.

took this to first night sedar and everyone loved it. It is not spicy as much as very flavorful and kept in the oven during the first part of the dinner well. I believe this would be fabulous with other combinations of vegetables or more vegetables but is wonderful the way it is.

Did not like this dish. The vegetables got lost next to the quinoa. We also say quinoa is too bitter for our tastes. Will not make it again.

I was disappointed at first until i used one of the previous reviewer's suggestions to add pecans (which i toasted first). They make a *huge* difference - with them in it, the dish was a very big hit among a very diverse crowd at my table. Definitely go for the toasted pecans.

Yes! Double the vegetables and increase the currants. Next time, we would have kept the veggie pieces bigger. It was delicious, but paled next to the chicken tagine and was too much the same color so next time we would have to play with that...but really tasty and substantive without having to eat kugel or farfel stuffing

Quinoa should always be rinsed well before cooking to take away the bitterness. I will try this with caramelizing carrots first.

This reminds me of a great african couscous dish I used to love. I liked it, but I would add garbanzos, some red onion, and potentially some red peppers and perhaps pecans. (I like texture.)

This was a terrific, easy, simple quinoa dish. The Hungarian paprika and cinnamon were definitely key to its unique flavor.

a great change from all the potatoes usually served at Passover, and all my guests loved it. Only suggestion might be more spice - was a little bland.

I made a slight change and everyone loved it, I carmelized the carrots before adding the zucchini.It was a huge success

Very delicious and interesting. For my tastes, I wish we had doubled the vegetables, or cut the quinoa by half.

This was easy to prepare in advance and travelled well to our family Seder. Everyone loved it! I would serve this year round, it didn't taste "Passover" at all. I agree with a previous reviewer who suggested increasing the currents.

My seder guests kind of pushed this around their plates. One family member thought it was a little dry. It's a little bitter as is. Perhaps some additional seasoning would help.

This was brougth to a seder where I was a guest. I thought it was delicious. My only suggestion would be to add more currants.

Delicious! Don't skip the cilantro, it makes all the difference. This goes so well with the Passover Pot Roast with Orange and Dates. Impressive meal!!!

I have checked to confirm that quinoa is not one of the banned grains and is, indeed, kosher for passover. This recipe was lovely and aromatic. We would make it all year long.
