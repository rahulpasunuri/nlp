Very tasty. I roasted the fennel like another reviewer recommended and enjoyed the salad very much! Beautiful!

This is a very interesting and tasty salad. I really love beets and could eat them roasted on their own ad nauseum. I think you have to really love beets to like this salad. But all the ingredients in this really compliment each other very well. I've made this salad more times than I can remember and it's always great. I always get rave reviews about it. I just toss everything together.

1 star meaning okay, which is as positively as I'd describe this. My husband couldnt eat it. I followed the recipe, no substitutions, and simply scaled it down. I knew it was going badly when I mixed the dressing with the fennel: it was a very unappetizing brown. Eventually the beets bled all their color into the rest of the ingredients and it was really a mess from the beginning (albeit a changing mess). The flavors didnt come together as well as I expected, and I wont make it this way again. I think maybe the fennel and the beets are where it didnt work for us: we like al these ingredients and have enjoyed them in other combinations, but not with both fennel and beet.

Excellent! A great change from the "run-of-the-mill" salads. It's a wonderful blend of flavors and so very refreshing too! Everyone loved it!

Fennel, beet and orange ............now thats a combination. I roasted the fennel along with the beets. In my opinion neither the dresssing nor olives are necessary.

We like this dish with the fennel sliced as thin as humanly possible. We've been enjoying this recipe since it was published in 1999, and just today at the end of 2005 learned that fennel is gendered. The fat-at-the-bottom bulbs are the female of the plant, and best and juciest with this or any salad use of fennel.

The presentation is beautiful. I felt the taste did not live up to the presentation, although it was more flavorful the next day.

What a refresing change of pace for a salad. I absolutely recommend this salad. I made it again only two weeks after I made it the first time. My son, who's eleven, liked it also. I didn't have kalamata olives so used pincholine(sp?) olives. Delicious!!!!!!!! I boiled the beets this time but recommend roasting them. Will definetely add this to my salad repertorie.

I'm sorry I didn't write in sooner to rate this recipe. I prepared the entire menu published in December 1999 issue that included this recipe for a Holiday open house. Even people that turned their noses up at beets LOVED this salad!, I doubled the recipe for a large crowd and EVERYONE tried some and absolutely raved about it. I've been asked to a function after Thanksgiving and the host asked me to bring that "delicious beet salad" from two years ago! It's a keeper, easy to prepare and quite elegant.

Simply an incredible salad and very easy to prepare. I made the salad for six people and they all raved over the presentation and the unique taste. This dressing is to die for. I prepared all of the ingredients in the morning and merely assembled them just before we ate. This is the first time I have ever used the fronds on the fennel, but it will not be the last. I found it hard to believe that no one has rated this recipe since it was published in December of 1999. Treat your guest and yourself to a wonder salad that could easily serve as a complete lunch with some hard crust rolls or bread.
