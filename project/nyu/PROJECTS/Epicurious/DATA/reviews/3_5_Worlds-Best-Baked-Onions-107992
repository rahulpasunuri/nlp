This is a fussy version of a much simpler recipe I found on Mr. Food. Just add some pancetta if you wish, but perfect without it. http://www.mrfood.com/Vegetables/Creamy-Baked-Onions/ct/1

A lot of work, but basically worth it. I added extra cheese over top at the end. Won't make these often, because they take a while (the cooling, the chopping, etc.), but they ARE tasty.

I used Vidalia onions and the pancetta...(if I were to use bacon I think I'd cook it first and add to the chopped onion in cream.) I also cooked an extra onion to chop, added a bit more garlic, cheese and cream so there was more of the creamy mixture. Do boil the onions a day ahead to save some time. This was lovely, flavorful and would work well with a number of entrees.

TRULY GORGEOUS!!!! Did use Vidalia onions and a bit more rosemary. Baked for the full time, then turned oven down to 250 while we were having a glass of wine and talking....would do again and again!! Served with grilled pounded chicken breast on a bed of arugula with Porcini/morel risotto; easy and fabulous dinner! Started with salad of buffalo mozzarella, tomato, white peach, basil and olive oil with malden sea salt and cracked pepper. Served a Cambria Pinot Noir and Flourless chocolate cake with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream for dessert (Chocolate Scream Cake from Los Olivos Cafe). PERFECT SUMMER DINNER!!!

This was very easy to make, presentation was nice and it was good - but not great. I would make it again only with Vidalia onions. I think a sweeter onion than I used would be better.

Too bad there isn't a picture. These are soooo good. Start the day before. I used a melon baller to take out the center. My husband doesn't even like whole cooked onions and he couldn't stop moaning. Would be good as part of a brunch or dinner buffet with roasted rosemary potatoes, grilled polenta and tomatoes roasted/broiled with garlic and olive oil. Mmmmm.

As an onion lover, I feel biased. I thought these were great, yet a lot of trouble (BUT CAN BE MADE WELL AHEAD), but my husband and guests (suspected non-lovers of onions) didn't seem to care for it much. Would eat them again, but only by myself

Absolutely amazing!!! Who would have thought the humble onion could be so elegant?! Lovely presentation, juicy, tender, gorgeous colour and oh, so very delicious. Love that rosemary! If you are looking for a tasty side dish that rises above the ordinary, this is it! Destined to become a repeated favourite at my house for years to come!

This is fantastic. My family was licking the dish, literally, and we are are old enough to know better! (I actually made this from Oliver's book, but I am very happy to see this here, if only to have the joy of recognizing a dish I've planted my culinary flag in, so to speak.) This ia now required by my family when they visit.
