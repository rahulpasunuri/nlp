Excellent Christmas Eve dinner for Italian seafood lovers. Presents beautifully on large white platter. Use the chilled seafood salad from this website for a first course and you have a very elegant meal.

This is fabulous: easy, elegant and scrumptious. Served it for Christmas Eve, and it was a great hit.

Made this with clams instead of mussels and didnt use chopped onions in the sauce - it was quite good and I'd definitely make it again.

A very good meal. Try substituting shrimp for the lobster. Also, choose a pasta that will hold the sauce and add some really good cheese at service.

This is a delicious dish for a special occasion. I rated it a 4 --- not because it is the most sublime thing I've ever had, but because it offers a combination of ease of preparation, very well balanced flavors and high visual appeal (especially when served on a large white platter with the lobster and mussels artfully arranged). Most of the work can be done ahead. A winner!

Delicious. Made 1/2 recipe, but I used canned tomatoes and made my sauce in the same pot.
