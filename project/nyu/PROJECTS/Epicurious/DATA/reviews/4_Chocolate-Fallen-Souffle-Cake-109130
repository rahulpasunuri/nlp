Delicious! Definitely a rich, fudgy cake. I had a hard time inverting the cake and putting it on the cake plate as directed in the recipe--it cracked a bit. Next time I'll just leave it on the springform pan base. It was fairly simple to make, just make sure to follow the directions about the temperature of the ingredients. I dusted it with powdered sugar and served with some lightly sweetened whipped cream and everyone loved it.

I brought this to a Christmas party with slightly sweetened whipping cream. Fabulous hit! Was requested to bring it every year.

I've made this several times as written, and it is very, very rich and tasty. The "fallen" aspect made the presentation a little lacking, so I whipped up some chocolate ganache and filled the "fallen" bowl with a layer of ganache... FABULOUS! It's decadent and beautiful. And you can use any flavor ganache to add more complexity.

My sons and I baked this cake at our cottage on the Big Rideau last weekend and it was a smash hit with the whole family. Very chocolaty and moist. The vanilla ice cream was a wonderful complement. I froze the left overs  did not last long in the freezer as it was calling my name. I will certainly make this again

This was delicious. Mine never "fell," so it looked really different from the picture (just a regular chocolate torte). I only cooked it 27 minutes and while it wasn't dry, it seemed pretty solid throughout. I would cook 22 minutes the next time.

Just made this for Thanksgiving and I must say I was a little disappointed. It tasted like an expensive brownie, and while it was easy to make, the finished product took away from the overall aesthetic of my table. Tasted fine served with ice cream or whipped cream, but I won't make this again. It doesn't hold a candle to a Molten Chocolate Souffle Cake.

Really rich, but really good and super easy. I love that it was so quick! Served it for company that was in a time crunch so we ate it warm and it was delish... I almost liked it better warm than cooled!

I have been making this cake for friends & family since it first appeared in Gourmet in '04. The photo took my breath away. You could see exactly how it would be when finished . . . soft but dense on the inside with this amazing crunchy top crust and a very intense chocolate flavor. Powdered sugar or cocoa & fresh whipped cream are a must. If you follow the recipe, it turns out perfect & beautiful everytime.

I thought that I already reviewed this recipe, but the review has disappeared. So-I want to start by saying that mine looked nothing like the picture. It never does, though. I don't know why I continue to be disappointed every time I make something. I agree with other people that this is an ugly dessert, but I agree that it could be fixed with some powdered sugar and fruit. I wish I had thought of that. This dessert was really interesting because it was light but dense at the same time, and it was very chocolaty without being too rich. My mother-in-law thought that it was dry, but everyone else disagreed. Isn't that kind of cliche? I think that she may have been thrown off by the texture. Overall, I think that this recipe is impressive and sophisticated. I think it's especially good for the late winter/early sprintime, when summer fruits aren't in season and you're tired of winter fruits. It's also really easy. The only challenging thing is folding in the egg whites without deflating them too much, and that's just a matter of practice. P.S. If I had wanted a flourless chocolate cake, I would have made a flourless chocolate cake. That is not the intention of this recipe.

I did everything wrong. Took every shortcut mentioned by every other reviewer, and the thing didn't rise at all. I thought it was going to be an embarrassment. Far from it--this cake was absolutely divine. More like fudge than anything. Outrageously delicious, and so simple.

Very good. It definitely needs fresh whipped cream b/c it's so chocolatey. I didn't read the other reviews about cooking it 27 minutes. I cooked mine 35 and that was too much.

Wow! It's grand! Made this for a wine tasting and again for a holiday. Everyone loved it! Definate keeper.

very good. I omit the flour and make it a flourless chocolate cake. The last time I made it (a birthday request) I found out that the bittersweet chocolate I thought I had had somehow disappeared (hhhm) ...so I used good semisweet chocolate chips and added no sugar to the chocolate mixture. It turned out great...even better than earlier versions with fancier chocolate !

Rating: 4
For chocolate lovers only! Mine fell apart when I tried to turn it over onto a plate. Had baked it for 38 mins. No problem we enjoyed it anyway. Used Scharffenberger 70% bittersweet chocolate. Very good! Want to play around with chocolates. I enjoy Callebaut as well. Can't wait for an excuse to make it again.

Rating: 1
Looking at the other low reviews, I also thought this cake tasted like a brownie. Maybe there was some issue in my preparation as it was not very light. Maybe I will try again, but I was not very pleased with the way this came out.

Rating: 3
Delicious. I forgot to add the flour too but it came out fine. 30 minutes of baking produced a moist, easy-to-slice cake. I don't think it matters if you use expensive or cheaper chocolate. What matters is if you like how the chocolate tastes, because in this dessert the chocolate is all you taste.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I also skipped the flour (by accident) and used dark chocolate bars instead. If you minimize mixing, you get a nice swirled pattern. I will definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
This was sinfully delicious. I reduced the flour to one tablespoon and ended up baking the cake for about 40 minutes. Despite the rich, chocolately taste, the texture of the inside was actually pretty light and fluffy...and perfectly moist. It wasn't too filling (dangerous!).The outside of the cake turned out somewhat meringue-like. I would definitely make this again.

Rating: 3
This is not a pretty dish, mind you, however the taste, consistency, and richness are absolutely superb. I too left out the flour, however I did cook it for around 38 minutes; because any sooner would have led to a pudding like mess (of which was not my goal). Nonetheless, it's rich and velvety and pairs nicely with fresh whipped cream. Bon Appetit!!

Rating: 4
Fabulous, a big hit with my eight guests, who gobbled it all up. I used Callebaut bittersweet chocolate and left out the flour as suggested, but baked it as directed in the recipe -- who needs another molten chocolate cake? The outside is slightly crusty, inside slightly fudgey. Not too sweet, and not too heavy. Just right!

Rating: 4
Wow! I didn't use the flour, as suggested. I only had brown sugar on hand. This cake is AMAZING. I can't stop eating it. So rich with perfect texture. I am looking for any excuse to make this cake again!

Yikes! I've got people coming over for dinner in an hour and I just went to turn the cake out onto a plate. It completely came apart on me. I was able to salvage about 1/2 of it. 27 minutes is not long enough (at least it wasn't in my oven). I tasted the chunks that fell all over the place and it does taste great, but it is not done enough. Oh well - hope the wine kicks in before dessert!

Rating: 4
You must use the proper size springform! The 8" worked, but it's obvious that the 9" would have made a big difference. Although it is supposed to look deconstructed, the 8" really falls in on itself too much. Other than that, this is a divine recipe that we will make many times in the future.

Rating: 3
Mine had a crust similar to the ones described by other bakers. I skipped out on the flour and since I couldn't find bittersweet chocolate, I used 8 oz semi-sweet and 4 oz unsweetened. A gamble, yes, but it turned out great. Also, I cooked mine for about 35 min. as it hadn't solidified at all at 27.

Rating: 4
This cake is just fabulous! After reading all the other cooks' comments, I too left out the flour and baked for 27 minutes. The cake turned out mousse-like in the middle, with a rich chocolate flavor. It is simply divine. I had guests for dinner two nights in a row and all loved the cake, except for my brother who likes his desserts a bit sweeter. I used Unique Origin Ocumare chocolate from Venezuela, a high quality 71% chocolate bar that I got at Trader Joe's. Easy to make and so impressive!

Rating: 3
Okay so I was too lazy to drive to the supermarket and went to the local dairy mart instead and bought dark chocolate candy bars. It was delicious! No need to spead big bucks on good chocolate. I left out the flour as well. Easy and great for that chocolate fix!

Rating: 4
This is a big hit! I agree with others that the cooking time should be shortened to 27 min. and flour left out. Then you get a more dense cake and gooey center. Everyone loves it. I also don't use the finest of chocolates and it is still delicious, but more cost effective. It's a breeze to make, as well.

Rating: 4
Another favorite! I'm working with a much smaller oven than most, but I have also found that it only needs 25-30 minutes to cook. The top will burn if it stays in any longer. I also forego the wax paper. Don't really see the need!

OK, I've made this cake 3 times (in 2 different ovens) and I'm convinced the cooking time is incorrect in the recipe. The more I cut down on the cooking time the moister and better the cake is. I'm down to about 27 minutes and I think it can be even less. The less I cook it the more moist it is and it looks more like the photo with the gooey chocolate center. Full cooking time results in dry brownie like consistency. Anyone else experience this?

Rating: 3
I have made this a few times, the first time it didn't actually work for me. I wasn't entirely sure what happened, repeated it and same results. I then researched a couple other fallen souffle recipes and one of them put in a 1/2 cup boiling water with the melted chocolate. This did the trick and I have tried it again without doing it and had the same problem. With this in place it truly is a great simple dessert. Even my husband makes it! Sometimes I add a few drops of cardammon oil which gives it a wonderful exotic aroma and a perfect match with exceptional dark chocolate. My recommendation is to ensure that you use the finest couverture chocolate you can find, Organic Green & Blacks would just get you by--at least 70% cocoa content and its divine.

I'm pretty stingy with my four fork ratings, but I must disagree with the previous few reviewers and give this the highest rating possible. The cake is VERY easy to make, very rich (a little slice will do you), very chocolatey, and very very good.

Good, but as far as chocolate deserts go, not nearly as exceptional as made out to be by other reviewers. Good for a chocolate fix, but texture could be better, I agree that it tastes basically like a brownie. Not very pretty to look at.

After reading the reviews this recipe received, I was expecting an amazing dessert. It was not. It was good, easy to make, and tasty, but not spectatcular. I'd call it a fancy brownie. There are many other desserts out there to "wow" you, this is not one of them.

I'm usually very stingy with my four fork rating, but this one really hits the mark. I made the souffle as a Christmas dessert and served it with lightly sweetened whipped cream....heaven. As a previous reader, I did not turn the cake over in order to take off the parchment. I don't see how this can be done without ruining the beautiful sides. If the parchment is buttered as directed, it's very easy to gently pull off. Use good chocolate!

I have made this several times and always get great reviews. Maybe it is the altitude here, but when my cake falls it leaves a beautiful 1 to 1 1/2 inch crust around the entire edge. It would be ruined if I turned it over to remove the parchment. So I just delicately remove it from the pan and peal away the parchment. Mine actually is much prettier than the picture.

My cake didn't quite look like the picture (no glossy top) - any advice? Nevertheless it was highly praised by my dinner guests. I used Baker's brand chocolate and it tasted great. No need to shell out the big bucks.

I would give this recipe ten forks if you had such a rating. It is definite proof that the level of difficulty of making a cake is not proportional to the quality of its taste. It is both the best and one of the easiest cakes I've ever made. When I took my first forkful of it I decided I would never make another cake. This one was created for a heavenly dessert table, so why try to find one better For people who don't like chocolate, well let them eat bread!

I have a question about this recipe. I made it yesterday and it was very tasty, but in the oven, it didn't rise high like a souffle (at least like the souffles I've made before). I followed the recipe closely and used very high quality chocolate, but I wonder if I didn't mix the egg whites into the chocolate batter vigorously enough or if I whipped them too much or not enough (they had glossy peaks that held their shape). I was afraid the whites would lose air and the cake wouldn't rise, but then it didn't rise very high anyway. The top came out a bit swirly looking, and didn't have the nice, glossy crust of the picture. Any suggestions? Thanks.

I made a virtually identical recipe last night from The Best Recipe cookbook, only the method was even easier. Instead of separating the eggs, beat the whole eggs, sugar, and vanilla at high speed (with a whisk attachment if you have it) until tripled in volume. Scrape it into the chocolate/butter mixture, sprinkle the flour over and fold it gently until mixed. Put it in the pan and bake. Delicious!

Excellent cake! I made this on a whim--had 6 oz. each of bittersweet and semisweet chocolate--tasted fabulous...and took so little time to prepare! The cake tasted way better than the cake portion of the Chocolate-Cranberry Torte (this is much moister). Next time I will serve this cake with the yummy cranberry-chambord sauce that accompanied the torte. This is a keeper!

Make this for a co-worker who wanted something chocolate - like decadent for Valentine's Day. She, and everyone else who had some, loved it. It is very intensely chocolate. I would have preferred some whipped cream, maybe garnished with fresh raspberries, to cut the chocolate a bit but I couldn't do that since I was serving it (leaving it on the table for self-service) at work. The recipe was simple and went together easily. No problems and I sure impressed my boss!

This is a great, easy recipe. Made it twice last week, once for my family as a "test" and made it the next day for a dinner party. This is more like a brownie. Not too sweet, but delicious, especially with a little powdered sugar dusted on top and fresh whipped heavy cream! Everyone loved it.

Liked the airy texture and strong chocolate smooth taste. Fun to have crunchy edges and creamy delicate middle. Use one egg extra due to a 10" pan, but other than that followed all directions to a 't'. Delightful with the whipped cream. It was for a 19 year old's birthday and she loved the cake. We used a heart cut out and powdered sugar to decorate it. Yummy.

I think people who have interest in this cake should see BITTERSWEET: RECIPES AND TALES FROM A LIFE IN CHOCOLATE by Alice Medrich. This sort of cake is supposed to be ugly--it's a fallen souffle. But Medrich points out that this is a cake with 1001 possible incarnations. I've made it with and without flour, with fewer eggs, with and without nuts, with various alcoholic liquids for flavor; and I've served it with whipped cream, ice cream, fruit compotes. Medrich gives various methods of preparation and I've used several--and even when I made mistakes the cake was delicious.

My Mom & I prepared this for her birthday dessert. Yummy, but yes, it's kinda ugly. Cake seemed a little soft in the middle which may mean we didn't cook it long enough; made a delicious, gooey mess with the vanilla ice cream. VERY rich...portions need to be smaller than you'd think!
