Whoa - tripled this recipe and the walnuts were way too vinegar-y. Am looking for a new way to candy them.

Excellent! Nice & light. I especially liked the walnuts. Nice summer side dish for a BBQ.

I liked this salad a lot, and it's certainly easy to make. My only complaint is about the candied walnuts-- I'm not sure that they add anything other than labor. The dressing is great (love the walnut oil), and I like how quickly this salad comes together. It's beautiful, too.

so good. i may have used red cabbage rather than radicchio by accident, but it was still really good. i steamed fresh green beans just briefly and also grilled the radicchio/cabbage since i was already grilling the pork tenderloin churrasco from this site (also great!). will def make again.

This salad has great flavors and textures. I made it exactly as the recipes states, except I used Ready Pac's "Lafayette" salad which is a mix of butter lettuce and radicchio. Next time I will add crumbled blue cheese.

Excellent! I would not use the walnut oil while carmalizing the nuts. Use fresh beans for this salad. Frozen don't do the salad justice. Interesting flavors and textures. I used just regular rice vineagar, not seasoned. YUMMY!
