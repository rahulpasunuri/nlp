Just made this ice cream last night and tasted it this morning. It's AMAZING! Was really worried when I tasted the custard tht it was far too sweet, so if I was to make it again I'd probably use two thirds of sugar instead. Also didn't have a thermometer so just made a thick custard and was fine. Removed all herbs and lemon peel before adding honey.

i needed to curb my out of control thyme plant so i was thrilled to find this recipe. i cut down a smidge on both honey and sugar based on the previous reviews and absolutely LOVED LOVED LOVED this recipe. i didn't bother with the candied thyme garnish. it came out thick, subtle and sophisticated. :D

I don't like things that are too sweet, and I did not, unlike some of the other commentators, find this to be the case with this recipe. I think some people just aren't used to the taste of honey, which always has an intense flavor, but one I crave as much or more than chocolate. That being said, I paired this with a ginger shortbread recipe I found at King Arthur Flour's website called Solstice Shortbread. The marriage of flavors between the lemon and thyme and the ginger could not have been better. It was the perfect end to our dinner of lobster and shrimp cioppino, which I found on here and also reviewed. Do try this recipe

I agree that this was quite sweet. I also found the flavour of lemon to be overwhelming; I would've preferred simply having the thyme against the honey.

Though the herb flavour was great, this recipe was way too sweet. I would cut down on either the sugar or the honey when you make it. It can also be made with any other herb. I've made it with rosemary.

Made the recipe exactly as written. It is a lovely and different ice cream. The garnish is nice as well. My only suggestion is when making the garnish, use only single twigs of thyme. Thyme twigs that have branches tend to clump and get too much egg white/sugar on them.
