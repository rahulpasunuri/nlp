First, rather than smashing the garlic with a fork, let the sauce cool and put it in a food processor or blender. If I could give a half fork review I would ... this is just bland and not at all outstanding. I don't know how the other reviewers could enjoy this. This is no longer in my recipe collection.

I made this for a romantic NYE dinner this year. I had a little trouble with the glaze; mine got a bit too dark. I was also broke, so I skipped the thyme since it was the only ingredient I didn't already have. I feel like the absence of the aromatic was noticeable, as the meat itself seemed a little bland. But the presentation really wowed my boyfriend, and I look forward to trying more glazes in the future.

I made this recipe a couple of years ago for a dinner party of eight people and it was phenomenal. Then I lost the recipe, so I'm thrilled to find it again - thanks Epicurious! I will be making this again! I serve it over wild rice with golden raisins and toasted almonds.

Followed the recipe exactly. It was excellent! I found it a bit too sweeet for my liking, but would definitely make it again. Maybe with white vermouth?? It was very moist and it was very easy to make. Fool proof!

I made this dish last weekend for guests and they loved it. The appearance is absolutely beautiful and the chicken stayed very moist. It was also very easy to make -- a plus for me. I made the glaze the day before to save myself a little time, and served it with the roasted yukon gold and shallots recipe that is on this site and green beans. I do wish that the glaze had a little more zing taste- wise, but overall, I would make this dish again.

I prepared this recipe exactly as given, but halved it. The hen was juicy and the glaze and sauce were very good. Simple, quick recipe for company or not.

We figured you could substitute just about anything short of broken glass in this recipe and it would be ok, so we tried it out. Tripled the recipe, only to find that we only had 1/2 c dry red vermouth. Decided to go with cherry wine, along with the vermouth we had. Added a tbs of butter in the deglazing process - everything came out great. Beautiful color, lovely taste. We cooked the glaze a bit hotter than called for. The key is just to keep cooking it until it reduces. Don't focus on the time.

If I could give 1/2 fork I would. I stumbled across the recipe while looking up another hen recipe. I was excited to use up that sweet vermouth that's been in the cabinet for so long; alas, when we moved from IL it seems it didn't make the trip to AZ. So, I used Maderia instead with. It reduced so fast I added some Vin Santo. Well, I never ended up with a "glaze" just reduced wine and garlic (not all all what I expected.) This is no better than the standard hens I've been making with Vin Santo. I don't know what all the 4 forks are for. This recipe is being "round filed".

I made this dish the other night and it was very good; I plan to make it again soon for a larger group. I can see how some people have found it uninteresting but you can be creative in the kitchen. I had asparagus and carrots on hand which I added to the pan and roasted with the hens and later served with white rice. It came out great. I didn't have fresh or dried Thyme sprigs so I used dried thyme leaves in a tea infuser so I could discard later and that worked fine.

I've made a lot of Cornish Hens in my day, and this was the best recipe I've ever made. The only changes I made were using dried rosemary instead of the thyme sprigs, and adding about a half teaspoon of corn starch to thicken the sauce a little. Otherwise I followed it exactly. The hens looked beautiful, were done perfectly, and tasted delicious (especially with the sauce). I served them with brown/wild rice pilaf and Brussels sprouts. Perfect.

After searching for the "perfect" recipe for cornish hens, I had to try this one b/c of the reviews it recieved. I followed the instructions to the "t" and the flavors was absolutely amazing!! B/c cornish hens are small, I will try this recipe with just chicken breasts (bone-in). Definitely a keeper!! Also very, very easy!!!!

This was very good, but it looked spectacular -- like something from a fine restaurant. Also, it's super fast and easy.

My whole family absolutely loved this recipe. The flavor was very delicious and the meat was perfectly moist. My husband (for some reason) doesn't like Cornish Hens but he LOVED these and made sure I knew he wanted me to make them again ... soon.

Interestingly, I had a similar experience to the cook in Ottowa. The chicken was very, very tender-nearly fell off of the bone, but I didn't love the flavor. I found it somewhat bland. But my boyfriend loved it and still raves about it to everyone. An easy recipe that presents well.

Easy, but not very interesting. While I did make some changes, they were nowhere near as interesting as those others have made (I used skinless/boneless thighs instead of the hens - alas, no koolaid in the house), I still thought it was worth telling those thinking about trying this. If you can't find a use for that old sweet vermouth, I suggest a couple of Manhattans - get rid of the vermouth and those maraschino cherries and have yourself a nice evening in the process! woohoo.

Beautiful presentation, delicious and easy. Also gets rid of that sweet vermouth lurking in the back of the bar for at least a generation. Who could ask for anything more? A definite repeat performance piece.

This was tasty, but I didn't love it. The only reason why I would make it again is because my husband loved it... said it was very juicy. Didn't substitute anything, but I did omit the thyme. I must admit though, it makes for a very lovely presentation.

I had to make this dish to see if it was as good as its reviews. I thought the reviews would turn out to be more entertaining, but I was wrong. This dish is wonderful! However, I preferred the grape Kool-Aid.

I'm surprised only 78% would make the recipe again -- it should 100%, given you made it properly the first time. ;-) The recipe rocks -- instead of using water, I used apple juice and an extra 1/2 cup of beef broth. Totally yummy. Put in extra vermouth at the home stretch. One word to describe this dish as said by my fiance: succulent. I served it with rice (with some of this glaze on it), carrots simmered in ginger ale, and regular plain mushrooms simmered in beef broth. Totally yummy.

Considering the interesting substitutions, mine is quite boring. I use apple juice instead of vermouth and it still turns out great! Very juicy and tender. I've made this recipe a few times and it's a hit each and every time!! I serve with roasted veggies. Yummy!

Alright, after reading all the hilariously silly reviews I just had to REALLY make this. So, I really did, and it was very, very good. Sweet but slightly tangy, it had the SO and I hunched over our plates picking every morsel off the bone. Be aware that the sauce can take longer to reduce ... Other than that it was really a piece of cake to do and would be impressive for a dinner party. The bird ends up that great red color just like the photo so I made coriander rice (also here online) and sauteed green chard with garlic and red pepper to go with... it worked really well. Very colorful and delicious. I would definitely make it again.

Used marsala wine instead of vermouth. Husband loved it but he said chocolate sprinkles would have finished the dish.

Okay, I bookmarked this to try because of the reviews also...Tomorrow I am preparing a meal for special guests and wanted to make cornish hens. Unfortunately, I only have hot dogs and sake...but from the sounds of it, I should be okay!

From people who don't like to make the same reciepe twice, we would make this again because it's so easy. plus the reviews are funny. and in the spirit of interesting substitutions, mac and cheese was a great side dish!

I'm going to make this tonight -- only because the reviews were great. I'll let you know how it turns out without any substitutions. Hope I'm not disappointed :)

judging from the reviews, the original recipe must have started with "first drink a bottle of vermouth and chase with a 6 pack". can't wait to try that version

An easy recipe with wonderful results. Will make it again and try it with chicken instead of cornish hens.

Instead of the vermouth, try breadcrumbs. Much crunchier. Also, try marinating the breadcrumbs in peach chutney (I added some dill). Then, use the frozen hens to pound the breadcrumbs into a fine pulp. Make into patties and put onto bamboo skewers. Grill, basting frequently. Remove from grill, insert popsicle sticks, and freeze. Enjoy as a summertime treat.

Great, EASY recipe. Planning to serve this for a large group of friends. I KNOW they'll all love it and will think I slaved away in the kitchen for hours! Yummy

I substituted rosemary for thyme, and used grenadine and dry vermouth. The sauce needs a bit more volume, so I would add a pat of butter right after reduction.

i went ahead & rated this recipe, although i have not tried it, yet, because it sounds so good & the reviews have interesting, to say the least. this is the 1st time, i've added my 2 cents, by the way. going along w/the other substitutions, i wonder if you could sub 3/4 c reg. vermouth & 1/4 c grenadine for the sweet vermouth. don't have any of that, but i acquired a bottle of reg. vermouth and pomegranite juice, so....

Cornish hens are neither cornish nor game, they were Mr. Tyson's (Tyson Chicken) attempt to get upper middle class types to eat more chicken. They are hybrid birdies. Tasty and fleshy. This is an excellent glaze, I have used something similar for years. I don't care very much for thyme and would substitute rosemary, here.

Rating: 4
You could also make this with skinless/boneless chicken breasts (only don't cook them as long)before you pour the glaze over them. Pork loin would also be nice with this type of glaze. I also added extra garlic, but I really like garlic. And, if you're going to use beer, use a porter or stout for the sweetness.

What a fabulous and flavorful dish! My friends were very impressed when I presented it to them. So very savory!

If you find yourself lacking sweet vermouth, leave the sugar out of a pack of grape Kool-Aid, add 1/4 cp maraschino cherry juice and the zest of 1/2 lemon. Quite reasonable if you are already subbing frozen hamburg anyway. IMHO

Actually, I have yet to make this dish. I give "four forks" because these are some of the best reviews I've read in a while. I too am adept at creative substitutions.

This was yummy! I used the wee chickens (coincidentally, they had led me to this recipe); also I wimped out on the beer suggestion and just went with sweet vermouth. My boyfriend suggested frozen hot dogs and muscatel, but I know he's just trying to get rid of that stuff.

After reading the first review (make sure you do!), I knew I had to make this recipe. While the substitutions made by the previous reviewer were quite creative, to say the least, I didn't have frozen hamburger patties so I substituted Cornish hens (those darling wee chickens)and I didn't have beer so I substituted sweet vermouth! (Sorry, I couldn't resist.) A perfectly tasty and easy dish to make, and now I have a use for the sweet Vermouth that I had on hand but had never used until now.

Delicious! I didn't have cornish game hens (what are these???) so I used frozen hamburger patties. Also, instead of vermouth I subbed in beer. Taste was great and my buddies loved it! A definate repeat.
