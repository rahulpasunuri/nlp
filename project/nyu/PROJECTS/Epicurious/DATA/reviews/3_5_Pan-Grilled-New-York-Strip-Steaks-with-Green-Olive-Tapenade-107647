Very happy! The rosemary press on the steak was a revelation, imparting a deep, smokey flavor. I used fresh rosemary that had almost dried out - about 3 tablespoons and did not chop. I cooked it, as instructed, on a dry hot cast iron pan. It looked beautiful. Since I don't have a grill, the stovetop cooking method was a welcome and more easily controlled alternative to broiling - the steak was absolutely perfectly done, and I'll use it again. I wish I'd read the tip about avoiding cartilage before buying the steak - good advice.

My "beef" with this recipe has to do with the cooking method: when I seared the steaks as directed the exterior of the meat burned, and the burned flavor stayed with the meat. FYI, I used a large, heavy, aluminum-core All-Clad pan.

This turned out great, although I used far less rosemary (about 1 tsp) and about 1/4 of the amount of tapenade would work just fine. The tapenade is great with other dishes as well as on a baguette, though, so no harm in making too much! :)

Try BBQ with this dish. GREAT!
