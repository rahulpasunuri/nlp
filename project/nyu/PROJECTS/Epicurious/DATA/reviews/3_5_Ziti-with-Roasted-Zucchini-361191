This was easy to make and tasted pretty good, just not great. I followed the recipe as written.

I have made a version of this for a while now and I don't believe that this recipe provides the best instructions. The key to roasting veggies well (IMHO) is an anodized aluminum roasting pan and addition of salt 1/2 way through the cooking time. Roast zucchini tossed with olive oil at 400 degrees turning occasionally until it is starting to brown. Sprinkle with kosher salt, add coarsely chopped chopped garlic and sliced shallots. Cook for another 5-10 minutes watching closely. (This takes way less than 30-35 minutes at 400 degrees) Remove pan from oven, thrown in cooked pasta, basil, crushed red pepper and cheese. (If you want try throwing in a 10 oz bag of spinach, too, and stir until wilted.) Stir it all up and your done!

First, I have to disclose I improvised using what I had on hand. That being said, I actually won't try it as written. First, I only had 1 large shallot and half a red onion which I used vs 8 shallots (8?!) - plenty! I felt it was a tad too spicy for me, but I'm pregnant, so deferred to my husband's opinion... He agreed; I'll use slightly less red pepper next time. Overall good, but I won't use it as written.

Very good and simple, took less than 2 hours for sure. I have to try it with black or kalamata olives next time and maybe cheesier cheese added like mozza. I cut down on oil and zucchini cook time they are great a bit firm. Good reviews all around. Used rigatoni in absence of ziti, penne would be fine.

Tasty. I didn't measure much - just used what was on-hand and it came together great. The shallots got burnt so I will give the zuc's a 10 min head start next time. I used about 1 cup cheese & 3/4 lb cavatappi pasta. Added extra black pepper at the end for taste. Even my non-zucchini-loving husband liked it.

This is a good basic recipe. As a suggestion to those who found the zucchini too mushy, slice them in half, lengthwise and scrape out the fluffy seeds with a small spoon. Then cut the zucchini into half moons. The fluff adds extra water which tends to steam the flesh. Also, I like the look and mouth feel of the half moons.

I made this dish the other day for my parents. They are big meat eaters, so when they realized there wasn't any meat, they were a little skeptical. But they loved it! It's a pretty hearty dish - the roasted vegetables are so yummy. (I added more shallots and garlic than called for ;)) I also used penne pasta instead of ziti. This recipe calls for 2 boxes but you only need one. (The other box is for some mysterious recipe) I also used less oil than called for and it was still pretty oily.

This recipe was fabulous. It only needs 1 lb of pasta though, and I will only cook the veggies for 10 minutes at a higher temp next time. I also think it was a bit too oily. However, the flavor was fantastic. I will definitely be making this again.

This was good but the veggies cooked down to pretty much nothing. I love the taste of zucchini so I wouldn't cook it so long next time. Still, very tasty.

I thought this was a great tasting pasta, even had to bring some in for my co-workers after they commented how good it smelled. I added some rotiserie chicken breast and roasted some sun-dried tomatoes with the other veggies. Making it for a get together tomorrow.

This is a tasty, easy dish. I made it for a weeknight meal--roasted the veggies until they were soft (not the full time suggested). Also, after I drained the pasta, I added a bag of baby spinach to the pot and cooked it down to include more vegetables in the dish. Yum!

Great dish! Only thing I didn't like was that the zuchini turned out very mushy--I hate overcooking vegetables, so I would roast them again for only half the time. I would use coconut oil, too, as olive oil becomes rancid after cooking for that long in that heat. Oh and you only have to cook one box of noodles. Over all this took me an hour to make, unlike the two hours the recipe says (totally okay with that!). Everything else about the dish was wonderful!

Delicious, easy-to-make recipe. We also added sun-dried tomatoes (thanks for the great tip!)and they were a good complement to the zucchini. Not sure what the Mac n' Cheese refers to, but we only made 1 lbs. of pasta and it was perfect. Added a delicious side salad with pomegranate vinaigrette and it made for a wonderful midweek meal.

Pretty Good. Added about twice as much cheese for more flavor. Substituted whole wheat penne pasta for the Ziti. Husband like it... Definitely would have liked another pound of Zucchini in it. However, I'm not sure I would consider this "healthy" with all the olive oil and pasta.... At least not low calorie.

Excellent recipe, even my Italian husband praised it.(and he's very picky about what he eats) The sundried tomatoes added sweetness to the dish.

This is a terrific, simple recipe. I had 3lbs of zucchini so I added extra garlic and red pepper flakes (trying to get to 1.5x recipe). Of course didn't have enough shallots and only used 1 lb of pasta (forgot to add the second box). Was able to make this in between trick or treaters. Definitely a comfort food dish with spice and flavor. I like the idea of adding sundried tomatoes, would add some acid and depth against the garlic and zucchini.

Simple yet flavorful! I used two onions b/c I had no shallots - worked fine. I also sliced a variety of tomatoes and roasted them on another tray - delicious! A splash of balsamic would also be great. If it tastes bland, perhaps it was under-salted? I used sea salt on all the veggies and more than a cup of cheese, but the final dish definitely needed more salt to bring out the full flavor. Finally, I agree the dish can use a lot more zucchini.

Very good. I did have to make a few modifications - used whole wheat spaghetti instead of ziti since that was in the cupboard. Also added sun dried tomatoes which were in oil, so cut back on the olive oil. Will add calamata olives next time. Will also add other veggies, maybe an orange pepper.

I tweaked this a bit and it was delicious. I used fresh tagliatelle pasta that had a hint of red pepper flakes. I used half a small jar of seasoned feta in oil from the Farmer's Market. I used about half the feta oil and half regular olive oil to roast the zucchini - and yes, it needs more than the recipe states. Don't leave out the shallots, they add great flavor. Then I tossed the feta with the roasted zucchini. Fantastico! I made enough for 2 meals and it was better the second day and did not really need the parmesan.

Easy to make and very good! I used the last zucchini from the garden--it was about 3 pounds and I agree that the recipe can stand more zucchini than called for.

This was so much better than I expected. Pretty simple, and very delicious. I don't know why the cook from KY says it was bland.

A great way to use all that zucchini from the garden. I used alot more zucchini than called for as well as some extra cheese. It was a great side dish.

Very tasty and easy to make. I only used one pound of pasta though...I am not sure why the recipe said to set aside one for mac and cheese...

Very very bland. We ended up putting on a jar of spaghetti sauce when extra cheese, basil, and pepper flakes didn't help the flavor. I've had much better ziti with roasted vegetable recipes on epicurious. Keep looking.

I thought this recipe was delicious,and so simple! I would add more zucchini though only because you can't ever have too much!
