This recipe is an exact duplicate from one in SUNDAY SUPPERS AT LUCQUES, by Suzanne Goin. My favorite cookbook ever. She serves it with potato bacon gratin. It is the perfect choice. Cook the duck on grill, skin side down for at least 20 min, moving often to keep from burning, then flip for a min or two.

The roasted grapes really added to this dish - I roasted them (without olive oil or salt and pepper) on a baking sheet covered in aluminum foil, and couldn't bear to throw away the grape juice, so I added it to the creme fraiche and it made for a great sauce, and served the extra at the table so everyone could dress the arugula greens.

I overcooked the duck and it was still great!

While I thought the grapes were an excellent addition to the duck, the effort it took to find dried juniper berries was a waste, considering they added little to no flavor to the dish. Overall, too much time spent on an average tasting meal.

More of a lunch than dinner dish. Seems to be missing something in terms of the arugula being undressed as it is--dressing might make it too oily given the duck fat (though this technique got rid of most of it). Also, the grape stems get in the way. The duck itself was very good but watch the heat and cooking time if you really want it medium rare. I found med-low a better setting for the initial 7 min of fat rendering and also drained fat as I went.

My darling husband chose this Candlelight Dinner menu for this two of us for Valentines Day. We cooked it together and the entire menu was absolutely divine! Even the roasted grapes. We are both duck hunters but used domestic duck. Next time we plan to use our wild game!

wow! absolutely loved this simple dish. fruit is a natural condiment for duck, cutting some of the "gaminess" and overall richness. the creme fraiche adds some of that richness back, but in a lighter way, if you can imagine that. can't wait to serve it to guests.

Very easy to make and it yet is very elegant. Doesn't need any tweeking although I added shoestring potatoes

Made this for a special dinner and it was excellent! We didn't like the idea of cold creme fraiche on top, so instead simmered it with the pan drippings to make a warm sauce to drizzle over the duck.
