This recipe is not very good. Look at all the good reviews, none of them made it as printed. Do not make this recipe as it is, it is totally flavorless. Chicken and salsa would have been better. Move along and look for a better tortilla soup recipe elsewhere (this is in no way shape or form tortilla soup as you would expect to get it in a restaurant). I just wasted an hour and a half of my life, and a whole bunch of food/money. Don't do the same.

I also made this soup as written and my family and I love it. Having it tonight on a very snowy evening.

Very good flavor and texture. I made it just as written.

I have made this soup a couple of times now and each time we thoroughly enjoy it. I make the stock in the crock pot over night, which gives it a very rich, deep flavor. Also, add fresh ciliantro (to taste) when I pureed the veggies. Served with a swirl of marscapone and more cilantro and chili- cheese corn bread. A yummy light dinner.

If you do not fry the corn tortillas, they will disentegrate in the soup and thicken the soup. Other than that and adding chili powder & cumin, this is a great base for tortilla soup.

This soup was runny and insubstantial. It tasted like watered-down salsa. It needed twice as many ingredients, although I'm at a loss to tell anyone how to fix it. I doubled the recipe, used much extra garlic and cut the water in half, and still it lacked something. Maybe some beans would have helped, but I didn't have any. Or lots of extra chicken, perhaps, and some additional exotic chiles. I made lots of extra tortilla strips and put these on the table so people could crunch them up over their soup. To be fair, it was a fairly light soup and would be good for someone on a diet if you go easy on the tortilla strips. As a main dish, it was lacking.

We loved this soup. I used this recipe as a springboard -- making several changes to create a chucky soup. I did not puree the vegies since I wanted a 'clear chucky version'of the soup that I had tried in a resturant. I used canned diced tomatoes with jalapenos, and added more garlic and onions (as other reviewers noted) along with 1/3+ cup chopped celery and carrots and a pinch of cumin, oregano and a bay leaf to round the flavors. When I added the lime juice, I also added 1/4 head of thinly sliced iceberg lettuce (a low carb/cal alternative to the torillas -- yum). As garnish I served diced green onions and avocado. Next time I will add a small zuke.

We loved this soup! We substituted tomato bullion for chicken, used boneless skinless chicken, and added a generous amount of chili powder. We found that we could use a small can of diced green chilis instead of jalapanos, if we do not have any in the house. We doubled the tortilla amount and instead of boiling it in with the soup, we put the fried tortilla stips on the bottom of our bowls and filled with soup. It is imperative that this is served with cheddar cheese, sour cream, and avacado. It is also helpful to double the recipe, but only adding two additional cups of water. This is now a standard!

Will definately make again. I upped the lime juice and added avocados and sour cream in when serving.

This recipe was pretty good. Some people say they didn't like it, but you really have to know how to alter a recipe to make it taste good. I added 2 extra cloves of garlic to this, 1 less cup of water, extra onion, extra jalapeno's and cheddar cheese. It was not bland at all. I did follow the advice of another reviewer and baked the tortillas instead of frying. Next time, I'll fry them and just add a couple of teaspoons of chili powder to the recipe. The baking didn't give them enough of a fried taste, so it took away from the soup, I think. And a little avacado and ginger would be really good with this too.

I thought this dish was to tomatoey, it seemed to be lacking something.

Really good, though I made a few changes. Used home made turkey broth instead of chicken, added less water, skipped the onions, added cumin and Rotel Tomatoes instead of the regular. It made it more spicy. Also added one carrot chopped. The lime juice and cilantro are a must. I did the tortillas according to another Tortilla Soup recipe from Epicurous....slice thin, coat with vegetable spray, sprinkle with chili powder and bake. Top the soup with avacado slices & shredded cheese. Great for a cold icy day.

Cooking the chicken in the broth added depth. I added frozen corn and lima beans. I plan to make extra tortilla strips next time. Whenever I tell my friends about the soup, my hubby chimes in that it was really good (and when will I make it again?).

I thought this was quick & easy for a busy work night. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, more garlic, and since I had an ancho chili in the fridge I used that. I didn't drain the juice from the canned tomatoes & I used the Mexican spiced variety. Then I discovered the kids had eaten the corn tortillas as an afterschool snack so I crumbled up white corn tortilla shells and served with shredded jack & cilantro. It was good!

I was very disappointed in this tortilla soup. It had very little flavor and just tasted like chicken broth mixed with tomato puree. Would I make it again? I threw the recipe in the trash.

This soup needs extra garlic and cumin. I also add zucchini, and fresh corn on the cob cut in 1/4ths. You can also spice it up by adding some jalepeno pepper sauce. Put tortilla strips, avocado slices, and cubes of jack cheese in the bowl. Pour hot soup over. Serve with lime wedges and fresh coriander. have plenty of hot tortillas, both wheat and corn.

Somewhat bland and definately not worth the effort. Pay attention to the glove tip when handling the peppers, especially if you wear contacts and need to remove them later. The jalapeno's leave an oil on your fingertips that doesn't come off easily and will rub off on your contact. OUCH! (This is experience talking...)
