This is an excellent stuffing. I used it for a pork crown roast. I stuffed the roast cavity and cooked the balance in a covered casserole dish for the last hour along side the roast. I was a bit worried that the tart cherries would dominate the stuffing but it wasn't an issue. I made it in advance the night before as per the instructions and the only changes I made was substituting white wine for the sherry and I bought dried shredded bread instead of a fresh loaf of bread. The stuffing was full of flavour and texture. The best part was the crunchy fig seeds. I think this would go very well with turkey as well.

This recipe has excellent flavout and the make ahead aspect keeps it simple. I made two changes out of necessity. 1) I replaced the sherry with turkey stock - worked well. 2) I had no mpre room in the oven so I wrapped it in buttered tinfoil and heated it on the BBQ for one hour over indierect heat. the stuffing was moist and full of flavour!

I served this with a "rack of pork" I bought at Costco. One of the best dinners I've served to guests. I didn't have dried figs and dried cherries, so I substituted dried prunes and dried cranberries. Also, right before I put it in the oven to bake I added 3/4 cup toasted pine nuts -- really kicked it up a notch or two. My friends asked me for the recipe and said they would use it with their Thanksgiving turkey. It was fabulous with the pork as well. I'd definitely use this recipe again. Will try it with figs and cherries next time, but was delicious with what I had. Maggie in San Diego

Finally! Every year I make stuffing with dried fruits (usually prunes)or vegetables (sun-dried tomatoes), and a fortified wine (or apple cider) plus some stock, but since I only make it once a year, I forget what proportions of bread to fruit/vegetable to liquid to use. This recipe had the perfect proportions. This year I used prunes, apricots and figs with Sherry and stock. Delicious!

This is an annual fave at our house. I was wondering if anyone has used this recipe to stuff a pork roast?

This recipe is an excellent and refreshing alternative for anyone who needs a slight departure from run-of-the-mill stuffing. The fruit brings out a surprisingly wonderful taste and complements turkey very, very well. If you're on the fence, I would highly recommend it.

Very tasty stuffing. My family has always insisted on having our apple/currant family stuffing recipe, but this year that changed. Even my father asked me to make it again for Christmas. The Dried Fruit Stuffing goes well with the Apricot Glazed Turkey with Roasted Onion Shallot Gravy from this site. Try adding some roasted almonds to this stuffing.

This was a lovely dish -- very flavorful and a nice change for my family after years of savoury stuffings. And 95% of it can be done the day before, easing up the workload on the holiday itself. Pretty to look at and makes the kitchen smell fabulous as well.

I'm not sure what was so different about my stuffing as compared to every other reviewer here, but it just didn't go over well. I thought that the sherry was over powering. And the mixture of flavors were not very pleasing. I prefer savory dishes and this may be my personal taste however... Of the 40 guests I had over for thanksgiving not one went back for seconds of this dish.

My family really liked this recipe. The stuffing was really colorful and pretty. I added dried cranberries to the recipe. It was a little sweet for me because I prefer savory stuffing, however, it paired well with the rest of the Thanksgiviing meal.

This is the best stuffing I've ever tasted! It was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving. It was moist, flavorful and the taste and texture of the figs was excellent. A couple comments: I got a bag of mixed dried bread from a local bakery (yum!), I cut the amount of sherry in half and used a little less onion. Can't wait to make it again!

This is a terrific stuffing that is perfect for holiday dinners with a mix of carnivores and vegitarians. The sweetness of the fruit utterly compliments the turkey - in the way that cranberry sauce does - and everyone... I mean EVERYONE... compliments how good it tastes. I am making it fr the 3rd time this Christmas.

I loved this recipe. The dried fruit combination is superb. To cut the overall fat, I used only half the recommended butter and added 1/2 pound of low-fat chicken apple sausage, browned. The sausage addition added a nice texture and taste to the recipe.

This stuffing was so wonderful. Very flavorful. If you look in the dictionary under the word MOIST, you will see a picture of this stuffing. This is a keeper, we will make this every thanksgiving.

I've made this twice before at Thanksgiving and plan to make it again this year. I'm very fond of the recipe but always struggle with what type of bread to use. When I think of French bread I am familiar with a bread that is mostly crust and that doesn't seem to make sense here. What breads have others used? I just usually use some combination of white and potato bread but I was wondering if there is a better choice, or perhaps I could be directed to a type of French bread that would work well here.

We tried this this Thanksgiving day and everybody liked it. This is enough for about 12 people. My husband is saying it was little bit too sweet. Is there anyway I can change recipe then?

I had Vegan guests at Thanksgiving dinner, so I adapted this recipe to serve them. It ended up being a great hit with the Vegans, Vegetarians, and Carnivores alike! I used olive oil instead of butter and also left out the eggs. The stuffing did not bind together as much as it would have with the eggs, but the texture was still very nice and the flavor was just incredible.

Easy to make, a pleasant surprise beyond any traditional stuffing I've had. A big hit at our Thanksgiving.

I've made this stuffing twice and loved it. I only regret that I don't have occasion to make it more often!
