Excellent flavors. Added some sauteed andouille sausage for a main dinner entree.

I have tried this several times, and here are the changes I have made to make this a real kid friendly salad. I don't use the avocado or the tomatoes. Also, I cut the Vinegar to only 2 Tbsp (rather than six). I double the amount of black beans (2 cans) and I add one whole red pepper sliced in strips. Also, I add one cup of sliced black olives. Excellent!

Without measuring anything, I tossed together leftovers from my fridge: linguine, black beans, kidney beans, corn, cherry tomatos, shredded carrots, cucumber, cilantro, with the vinegar, garlic powder, oil, S&P and onion salt...it needed more, so I put in two cloves of minced garlic -- it was garlicky, but great! My father, who won't eat veggies LOVED it...he doesn't say anything about food unless it's great! My husband, who won't eat beans or cold pasta liked it too...he mixed it up in his green salad, I think it had too much vinegar or garlic for my 3 1/2 year old vegetarian daughter. Maybe I'll add olives next time...

I love this dish. I make it all the time. It is inexpensive, quick, and easy to make. I always omit the chives because I just don't think they matter too much. Also, I use much more garlic and vinegar. I agree with the previous reviewer, the salad does absorb dressing, so make extra. And I don't even bother measuring the veggies, just throw in as much as I want. More of a method than a recipe.

Very pleasant. It may be wise to mix a little extra dressing to put on the salad just before serving - I found that the pasta had soaked up the dressing and the result was a touch dry.

I love this pasta salad. I added spinach leaves and doubled the garlic. Also, it's even better the next day.

I took this to a vegetarian cook out and it was pretty good. I forgot the avocado, and completely ignored the chives. It was a little bland at first, so I added some goya adobo seasoning, cumin, tumeric and a good dose of cayenne. It was definitely better the second day, but very good to begin with. Also - there's no way the proportions of pasta to other items are right - so I used the entire container of grape tomatoes and added an orange bell pepper

I used tri-color wheat rotini to add color and a bit of fiber to the dish. I also added several vegtables that I had on hand such as red onion, peas, bell peppers and snap peas. The fresh spices made the dish perfect for the spring. It was also a perfect side to bring along to a BBQ.

colorful but lacked flavor and heft. Eating this is like eating an undressed salad of iceberg lettuce and carrots. Healthy and tastes too much like it. I added some roasted chicken which made it easier to swallow. Will be struggling to finish leftovers. There a lots great hearty vegetarian dishes but this is a far cry.
