I made only the couscous to go with the Chicken Tagine recipe from this website....the couscous was great! Such amazing flavor, the curry and the cinnamon complement each other fantastically!

Lamb shoulder blade chop was flavorful but to tough for me. I'd try a lamb steak cut from the leg next time. I'd also probably marinade it in a lemon, wine, soy and garlic combo for 3-4 hours before cooking. Rest of recipe was great. Couscous was best I've had to date. Zucchini Raita was a excellent complement to lamb.
