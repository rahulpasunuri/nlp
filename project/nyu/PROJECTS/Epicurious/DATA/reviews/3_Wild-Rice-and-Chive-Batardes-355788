If I could have used no forks that would have been honest. Dough was dry and unworkable. I had to throw it away and make biscuits to take to the function we were attending.

Made this over the summer on the Maine coast to go with lobster bisque. Simply amazing. I recommend using a powerful food processor, as that will most effectively break up the rice.

This turned out hard, dense, and unedible. I'm not a newbie bread maker and followed the directions exactly. Since the recipe looks so good and there is always a chance I made a mistake, I will give it another try and adjust my rating accordingly.

The wild rice intrigued me and made me try this recipe. Easy but takes 24 hour planning. My husband said that it is the best bread that he has ever eaten. Already starting a second batch.
