My husband doesn't like radishes but he loved this...I used lemon thyme, thyme, mint, basil, and cilantro for my herbs as that was what I had on hand. We ate the entire salad! I chopped the radishes in my little food processor and it was so light and tasty.

This was yummy. I had time to let the vinaigrette sit for a bit and it really let the flavors develop; the emulsion was nice and thick, almost like a runny mayonaise, garlicky and lemony... delish!
