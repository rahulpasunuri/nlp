This cake is a delight. Made it with a Napa Moscato -- couldn't find Beaumes-de- Venise, but a California muscat has to be a good substitute. The cake is moist, light, creamy with fruity buttermilk notes, and the berries are a bright fresh counterpoint. It was a hit at the party -- very attractive and easy to make.

Lovely result, needs to be served slightly warm especially if served next day!

Fantastic, however I did change it a bit. The cake is fine - what cake wouldn't be soaked in booze syrup.I substituted Chambord for the wine, eliminated the orange, used red raspberry preserves and mixed red raspberries with black raspberries for the fruit topping. It is a beautiful presentation and tastes just as elegant.

Cake was decent, but not great. Used a muscat from CA, Beaumes de Venise probably would have been better. However, what a waste of beautiful blackberries. Just plain berries and whipped cream would have made it a nice desert. Try the Beaumes de Venise cake with grapes on this site. Outstanding!

Excellent, fast/easy cake to make. I was looking for a simple cake to make in order to use up my buttermilk and came across this recipe I had saved. For the topping, I topped with carmelized bananas instead of the blackberries (which I will use when they are in season). I plan on making the cake again tonight (luckily I still have enough buttermilk to use up) and will use fresh strawberries (plan on scooping out part of the cake top in order to fill with honey Greek yogurt and glazed freshed strawberries). The sky is the limit now.

I really loved this cake. It had all the elements of a summer dessert that I love--fruit with a simple pastry. I had gorgeous blackberries for it. And the cake was outstanding--dense, moist and tender. The cake was soaked on the top from the wine and the jam--scrumptious. Three of us devoured more than half of it in one sitting.

Muscat de Beaumes de Venise is a rare find, especially for year 2001. There is the one from year 2003 that tastes just as good. I tried this with Sauternes and fresh apricots slices. That's also wonderful.

I have not made the cake yet. If Beaumes-de-Venise is expensive, you might want to try using California Muscat dessert wine instead, since Beaumes-de-Venise is basically muscat wine from France. CA Muscat wine usually sells for ten to twelve dollars a bottle. I am looking forward to trying this recipe when the berries are in the season again.

After reading the other reviews I was excited to make this cake. In reality, I found it to be very pedestrian. Frankly, I think it would do better as a shortcake with strawberries and whipped cream. It was the blandest cakes I made for my party.

This was quick and easy and everyone had came back for more. Am tempted to try with other berries. Didnt have any buttermilk so added some sour cream to milk and worked just as well.

Expensive...but fantastic. Don't scrimp on wine or on fruit--it would ruin the recipe. Great for dinner parties. I served with the same dessert wine. Magnifique!

I served this cake to guests several times last year when blackberries were in season, and I am looking forward to making it again. Using the Beaumes de Venise, which is rather expensive but has a very complex flavor, will make all the difference between heavenly and "just so-so" flavor. I would not bother to make the cake with grape juice.

To the cook from New York - if you prefer non-alcoholic, what about white grape juice? Since the suggested wine is a fruity dessert wine I think that's what you'd get with white grape juice, just without the alcohol. Good luck.

This is a question, not a review: Is there anything you could replace the Beaumes-de-Venise with, such as apple juice or another non-alcoholic liquid? Has anyone tried this? Thanks for the feedback.

I made this for my French class (we have refreshments at each class) and everyone loved it and all asked for the recipe. Beaumes de Venise wine is a favorite with this group. they also loved the Beaumes de Venise cake with grapes.

An easy, straightforward cake that presents well. However, it was rather ho-hum in flavor. I won't bother to make it again.
