I made the recipe as printed. I would add more white wine the next time for more sauce and I would chop the olives up for a better presentation.

This recipe was good but that says more about the fish we had than the recipe itself. As written, we could have used a little more sauce - we barely tasted it. Also, although we were trying to avoid frying, with the amount of oil in the pan and the mess inside the oven from splattering (unavoidable even if patting the fillets dry), we might as well have fried them. As Vancouver noted, pitted olives would have been nice. I also think the olives would have benefited from the sauce more had they been pitted. All in all, a decent dish but if I were to make this again, I would make a few changes and there are so many other snapper recipes to try (probably with more impressive results).

Truly outstanding. I made this for Christmas dinner because I needed something light. I used good quality olive oil and olives. Everyone loved this and insisted that I make it a standing Christmas dish. A true Italian dish in that the ingredients make the recipe.

Scale the snapper with a fish skaler, and slash the skin 3-4 times diagonally so the fish doesn't curl up when it meets the hot pan. Assorted olive sizes (and colours) add to the drama, but pitless would be more elegant for diners. About 7 olives per plate is optimal. You don't need this much oil in the sauce - use a generous cup of white wine instead, reduce to about 2/5 cup to give you the sauce volume, then add just a tablespoon or two of olive oil. When serving, if your sauce has evaporated a bit more than you'd like, just add a few teaspoons of hot water and you're back in business. This recipe serves 6 as a main course.

This recipe was modified by pan-frying flour coated snapper in an olive oil and butter mixture. After the fish was cooked and removed from the pan, a sauce was made from white wine, Italian parsley, sun dried tomatoes, capers, lemon juice, garlic, slivered Kalamata olives and a small knob of butter. Yum!
