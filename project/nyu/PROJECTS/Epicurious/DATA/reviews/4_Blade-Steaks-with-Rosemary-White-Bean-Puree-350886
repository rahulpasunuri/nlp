Such a good combination. The white bean puree added so much flavor. I used steak seasoning and jacquarded the steak prior to cooking. This resulted in a more tender steak. We really enjoyed the meal.

Yum yum- I had to make substitutions, bet it's better as written.

I was so pleased with this recipe - and very glad that I cooked it outdoors (because it is very smoky). I did not bother to purée the beans and the dish was visually very attractive (and a bit quicker, easier and with less clean-up).

The steak itself is nothing to rave about, but the rosemary white bean puree is phenominal! My wife does not care for cannellini beans, but always goes back for seconds. I've cooked just the puree as a side on it's own with other steak recipes always to rave reviews.

We really enjoyed the puree -- it's a slightly kicked-up alternative to your typical potato puree. My partner likened it to "extra-fancy refried beans", a surprisingly apt comparison, but we thought it went really nicely with steaks.

This is really very good -- and very fast. The garlic and rosemary and olives add so much to the beans, and they are delicious with the steak. I did not have a problem with the color of the beans -- they were a nice rich brown.

This was quick to make and absolutely delicious! The puree was wonderful--the olives added a really nice flavor. The only thing I wasn't fond of was the color of the puree, due to the tomato sauce. Next time, I would serve the sauce on the side, preserving the pretty creamy whiteness of the beans.

I made just the puree to accompany another dish, veal chops. This is a great side dish and a wonderfully flavorful alternative the usual potato starch sides. The fresh rosemary is a must.

super easy and very delicious. My food processor is packed away since we're living elsewhere temporarily, so I didn't blend the beans and other ingredients. It came out great anyway.

Great recipe- it was quick and easy! My meat-and-potatoes husband LOVED the White-Bean Puree. Definitely putting this in my recipe box.

Tastes good. Easy to make, what more could you ask for. I put in extra garlic, next time I will roast it first.
