This has become a favorite potluck recipe. Every ingredient is familiar but they're put together in a new way - it's a wonderful combination.

This is a nice recipe for a lunch. Be careful about adding too much garlic!

I really, really liked this recipe. I love bulgur wheat and like trying different ways to fix it. This was very refreshing with the grapes. The ginger and cilantro added just the perfect balance. For those of you who say you don't like cilantro, don't give up on it quite yet! I remember years ago buying it and thinking it was 'rotten parsley'. But once I realized the mistake I made, I kept experimenting. Sooo, give it a chance, because once you eat it a few times you fall in love and can't get enough!! It is absolutely perfect in this recipe!

Parsley is a good substitute for cilantro. My husband does not like it either. He thinks it has a soapy taste.

Is there something I can substitute for the cilantro? My father hates cilantro!
