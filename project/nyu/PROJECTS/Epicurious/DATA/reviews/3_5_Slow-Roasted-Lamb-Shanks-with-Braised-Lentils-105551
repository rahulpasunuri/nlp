Excellent Recipe Massimo! I had to substitute Kålrøt (Cabbage Root / Yellow Swede) for celery and Rosemary for Thyme which gave an even more intense gravy sauce but the basting and cooking on top of the veggies worked a treat in a low speed fan forced oven. Excellent Påske (Easter) dinner.

I did as another reviewer recommended, and cooked this in a dutch oven. I never covered it, but the smaller surface area & greater depth helped - the vegetables never got dry and I didn't use as much stock as called for. Thought it was a terrific dish. I turned the lamb (maybe too often?) so lost the thyme & mint flavor. I'll make this one again.

The first time I had this dish was at Locanda Veneta, when Massimo was still there. It reminded me of my mom's lamb shanks. I have since made this dish many times. Open roasting is excellent, adding wonderful flavor. I use a Dutch oven, however, so that I have a tightly fitting lid to stop the roasting and retain the moisture in the mirepoix when the dish is finished before you're ready for the main course. Impressive, comforting and easy for entertaining! Dora - a little late, but yes, Massimo is in Beverly Hills - http://www.massimobh.com/. We still enjoy Locanda Veneta, AND Massimo. Both are excellent and authentic Tuscan restaurants.

Absolutely perfect. I was worried about the temperature based on previous reviews but it worked great for me. I had the butcher crack the bone and the sauce turned out wonderfully rich. The lentils were a wonderful pairing to balance out the rich lamb.

The recipe turned out great, however, I do agree with other reviewers that the temperature was a little too high. I followed the recipe to the 'T' but found that the vegetables were nearly crisped. I think a 300-375F would have been a better temp. Nevertheless, it was wonderful and I used small French Puy lentils with this and they were wonderful. I also added slightly more red wine to the final sauce. Delicious.

I've made this four times and each time it comes out better and better! The secret on the roasting at that temperature (500) is having a heavy pan like LeCruset and/or making sure the pan is just the right size. With too much cooking surface, they dry out. I find that an 8 qt roasting pan that's about 5" on the sides is just perfect for four to six shanks! I've also made it over Risotto Milanese and it's excellent!

Yes definatelly the slow roast on lamb it is a great touch, but if I have to make this recipies I will not use the chicken stock,chicken flavor is different than lamb and also it will lose the taste of the lamb juices coming out of the bones from the shanks,also flour is wrong to add in the sauce especially with butter it will make the sauce too starchy and cut the flavor of the beatiful raoasted vegetables and herbs;it's a great recipies but the chicken stock and the flour are two ingridients that I will not use for this particoular method to cook lamb shank.And the 425 temperature is wrong for slow roasted lamb.

Great change for typical lamb shanks... I just took the shanks out after 3 1/2 hrs. and put the pan juices and vegetables in the blender, then boiled with wine and flour... easy... keep the oven at 350!

I made this last fall when it came out in Bon Appetit and feared I'd lost the magazine; I'm glad I found it again here because it was simply one of the best I've made; the braising liquid creates a truly great sauce and I didn't have problems the temperature which I followed per the recipe although technically I suppose you would call it truly roasting. I think turning the temp down to 300 for the last 60-90 min would ensure that the meat on the bones are not overcooked but still falling-off-the-bone tender. Serving this over the lentils was perfect. A GREAT recipe.

I have to agree on the roasting temperature. I've made countless great recipes from this site and I've never had trouble like i had with this one. Even with frequent basting I had to turn the heat down to 300. I don't know how it's possible to cook it at the recommended temp.

I agree with Bill and prior reviewer. I've tried this twice now and still haven't turned heat down far enough. I love lamb shanks and think this recipe will be great once I figure out the right temp for my oven.

Overall, a delicious combination, with a great depth of flavour. Prepare to spend an afternoon in the kitchen, working on some other things while the lamb roasts. I had no trouble with the suggested temperature at all, perhaps because I basted frequently. The only thing that I would do differently next time is use low-sodium broth. I watered mine down a bit, but would have preferred a little less salt. True comfort food.

I can't believe that anyone thinks 425 is slow roasting. After an hour I looked at burned vegetables and very dark meat and finished the cooking at 300. Everyone agreed that a new recipe was in order.

"This food is rocking my world" a friend told me. The only change I made was to turn the heat down to 375 after the first 1 1/2 hours because the veggies were beginning to burn. Yum.

Very nice, suprisingly sophisticated. I had my doubts about the 425 degree roasting tempurature and because I was using a 1 lb shank I reduced tempurature (I was cooking for one) to 325 for the last hour. Was very happy with the result. Definitely a keeper!

This dish sounded odd at the start, but the result was spectacular. The lamb turned out butter-tender and moist, and the lentils were not mushy. Much to our surprise, they had a nice texture and the two flavors were great together. I was in Los Angeles this week on a business trip and heard Chef Ormani is opening his own restaurant in Beverly Hills. Does anyone know where?
