made changes but used basic idea....haricots verts,sliced white shrooms from trader joes,parsley instead of thyme. sliced raw red onion rinsed under water, halved grape tomatoes, small sliced cukes, spinach.i sauteed the mushrooms in olive oil into which i added minced garlic towards the end of cooking.i served the green beans on a bed of spinach then garnished with the salad ingredients and the delicious mushrooms. dressed with oil, lemon and honey salt and pepper and freh chopped parsley. decided to forgo the cheese and used roasted pinenuts to garnish. i know the cheese would be delicious too but wanted a vegetarian dish. this was a perfect salad taste-wise, looked inviting and also i was able to use all ingredients i had in my fridge which needed to be eaten without a special trip to buy which has made this cook very happy.

Delicious! Going to be a regular feature in the monthly rotation. I made it the first time as a way of using up what was getting old in the fridge -- green beans, mushrooms and salad greens. Took the advice of other reviewers and emulsified the dressing with dijon. Basically made the whole business in the microwave in stages: Onions, then mushrooms then green beans. 5 min each and then add the next. Then poured in the dressing and threw in the cheese, which melted in quite nicely. Subbed taragon for thyme. Oh, and don;t add all of this mix to the greens if you think you'll have any leftowvers -- the salad greens will get soggy. Refrigerate it and reheat the following day. It's just as good!

Excellent. Made for New Years Eve. For an elegant presentation used upland watercress and horizontally sliced endive. To lighten did not use cheese but scattered a few lightly browned small pancetta cubes on each salad.

This is delicious and easy! The flavors are so bright and fresh. My guests raved about it. My toddler even ate it! Next time I think I'll add toasted pinolis or toasted walnuts for some extra texture.

This was a hit for Easter dinner as the first course. Everyone loved the warm wild mushrooms . Will make again. Does not need the green beans.

fairly easy to make, tasty, healthy and filling! We liked the textures and flavors combination definitively a do it again. I had regular white cap mushrooms to use and it turned out great. I follow a reviewer's suggestion to add the goat cheese to the mushroom mixture and melt it before serving. I added a additional crumbled cheese to top the salad, just for presentation's sake. Substituting onion or green onions if you don't have shallots works too. Make sure you spoon enough dressing into the mushroom to give them enough flavor.

Made this salad with the suggestions someone made about adding all the dressing to the hot mushroom mix, then poured over mixed greens w/spinach, mixed in the cheese and green beans till cheese melted and it was wonderful. I served it to a group of gourmet ladies and they licked the bowl!

I thought this recipe was easy and came out really tasty. I even used plain mushrooms (white and a few portobello) since that is what I had. The flavors blended nicely and the green beans were a nice addition to the salad.

I made this salad for a party, and people raved over it! (Moreso than the other food I had been cooking all day!) It took no time at all to prepare, and the flavors were amazing. People are still asking me for the recipe. I used mixed greens, fresh French green beans, and soft goat cheese which kind of melted when tossed with the freshly sauteed wild mushrooms...

This was a very well written recipe. The flavors of the mushrooms, goat cheese, and green beans all combined very well and the greens gave it some body.

A nice addition to our main meal. The mushrooms were delicious and unlike other posts, I found the dressing intensely flavorful, not needing all of it on the beans & greens. Perhaps one's balsamic vinegar makes the difference. I would recommend this recipe.

I thought this recipe was just fine. I made as written and doubled it for a crowd. Good mixture of flavors.

I also substituted baby spinach, although I do think that mixed greens would work well too. I do agree with a previous reviewer that the dressing was the "weak point" in the recipie; I added a touch of dijon mustard to give it a little more kick. Still, a great recipie.

My husband and I weren't as impressed as the last reviewer. The recipe had potential but the greens seemed bitter and the dressing was weak/bland. IF I were to make it again I may take the suggestion of spinach. Definitely needs more flavor perhaps more goat cheese would help.

Delicious! I changed the order somewhat, added the dressing to the hot mushroom mixture (in my case porcinis) and poured it over baby spinach. Then added the goat cheese and gren beans and tossed. The salad turned out creamy, and the spinach slightly wilted. Served it for Christmas dinner with Game Hens with Garlic and Rosemary, Garlic and Rosemary mashed potatoes, a plain Italian bread, and traditional vanilla cream puffs with raspberry sauce for desert. Poured a Clos du Bois chardonnay. Rave reviews!
