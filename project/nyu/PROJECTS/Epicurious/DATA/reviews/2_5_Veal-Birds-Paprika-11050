I make this using onions (sweet) or shallots, red bell pepper, seasoned bread crumbs, fresh thyme and shrimp chopped up. And I end up with a "bird" that's about two inches long (somewhat like a boneless quail). And make a pan reduction with chicken or beef stock with a bit of marsala or port. This would solve one of the reviewer's concern about taste!

I agree with the cook from NY. The recipe took about 30-45 minutes to prepare, not including cooking time. Very little flavor. There are so many better ways to use veal....

Too much work for not a lot of flavour.

This recipe was extremely easy to prepare and very elegant when served with individual scalloped potatoes (made in a muffin tin) and seasoned green beans. I used 1/4 cup Port Wine in addition to the chicken stock and it made a wonderful rich gravy. I will use this recipe again and again. Louise McIntosh, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada
