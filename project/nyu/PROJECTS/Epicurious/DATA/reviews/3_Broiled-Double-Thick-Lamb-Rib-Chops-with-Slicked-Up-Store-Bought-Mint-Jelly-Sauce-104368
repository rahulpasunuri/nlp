I have made this recipe a number of times with gourmet mint jelly (less sugary) and it has come out very well. My guest have always enjoyed it. I like it because it's fast and easy.

This recipe was easy, and the grilled lamb was wonderful. I thought the sauce, however, was too sweet, but I guess that is how it is supposed to be. The strong sweet spearmint flavor was disconcerting--almost like eating toothpaste on lamb. I used a bright green generic storebought mint jelly, so the color was also disconcerting. Maybe a gourmet or homemade mint jelly would yield better results. I would recommend cutting the proportion of jelly in an effort to reduce the sweetness and overpowering mint flavor.
