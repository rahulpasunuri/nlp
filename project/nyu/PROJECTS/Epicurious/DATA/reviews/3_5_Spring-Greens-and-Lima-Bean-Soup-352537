I made this soup yesterday. I could not find dried lima beans at the Dominicks so I used a large bag of frozen. I used the two bunches of mustard greens as the receipe calls for. Way too much greens. One bunch would have sufficed. There is just not any flavor in this soup and if you look at the receipe you see why. No spices, not even salt and pepper. I can not figure out the other rave reviews. I am going to try it tonight and see if it has improved the second day.

I made this soup over the weekend and it was very good. I agree with the prior reviewers that dividing into two separate steps isn't necessary. I sauteed the onion, celery and carrots and added the pre-soaked lima beans and 8 c. homemade chicken broth. Simmered for about an hour and then added chopped drained tomatoes; added the chard about 10 minutes later. I included two bunches and thought it would be too much at first, but it is perfect. Better today than yesterday and that was better than the day before. I froze the remainder.

This was a satisfying and colorful soup. Not wanting to sacrifice the minerals from the greens leached into the cooking water, instead of draining it off, I just added chicken broth concentrate and light miso. My greens were mustard, wild dandelion, and a little spinach. I tried the finished soup with the Parmesan cheese, and decided I liked it better with some Mrs. Dash seasoning and a little celtic sea salt. Yummy! Couldn't get enough!

thought it was healthy and semi-hearty. used pinto beans for lima beans, and fennel for celery. i salted the onions/carrot/celery while sauteeing in oil bc recipe never calls for any salt.

I made this the other day trying to get more veggies into my husband (loves soup, not so much greenery). I used one bunch red chard but followed the amounts listed on the rest of the recipe. Also chopped the stems and added them a couple minutes before the leaves. I can't imagine how thick that soup would have been with 2 bunches, one was plenty. I thought hubby would hem and haw but he actually liked it!

I've made this twice and found that I like it best with far more greens (I use any kind of interesting green) and lima beans. It's heartier that way. Add andouille sausage or something less fattening (cook first in thin slices). Love this and am making it again tomorrow.

recipe seems a bit more busy than needs to be. i'd saute the onion,celery,carrots first, then add the tomato, broth and beans, let cook, till beans done then add greens and simmer a bit more
