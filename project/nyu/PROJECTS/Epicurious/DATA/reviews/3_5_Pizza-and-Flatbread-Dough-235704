This recipe was easy to follow and great tasting. I used bread flour and pre-baked the dough for seven minutes then added my toppings and cheese. It was phenomenal. The best thing about this dough is that you don't feel so full like you do after eating regular pizza.

This is a good pizza dough. Following others advice, I used bread flour - 2 Cups - and also chose to blend in 1 cup of whole wheat. I baked my pizza for 12 minutes at 425.

Very easy and good taste. Used plastic blade in food processor with good results. Also used 2.5 cups bread flour and .5 cups whole wheat flour. Will increase proportion of whole wheat flour next time.
