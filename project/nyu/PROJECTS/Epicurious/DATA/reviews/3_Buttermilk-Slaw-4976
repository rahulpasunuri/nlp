This is now my signature slaw recipe--I follow the recipe almost exactly but add apple cider vinegar to taste, usually about a tablespoon. Very popular with my slaw-picky family.

I am still new to slaw, but I was not impressed with this recipe. I bought farm-fresh red and green cabbage, carrots, and parsley and it still was bland.

This recipe was flat until I added 2 t. of red viniger and a little more sugar. I didn't chop my slaw I bought it bagged. Very easy and will definately make again. I served it with spicy wings and baked apples.

An excellent recipe, even for those who are not fond of slaw or cabbage. It has been a hit every time.

The buttermilk added a nice flavor to the dish - I made this for a Labor Day cookout, and they guests ate most of it and carried off what they didn't finish.
