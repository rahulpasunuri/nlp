Every time I try a recipe with orange juice it's a flop. This was no exception. It made beautiful, fresh from the garden bok choy slimy and bitter. I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

This turned out absolutely better than i thought. This was the first time I had Bok Choy and i thought it was going to be a bitter taste due to it being a foreign delicacy.But i was sooo wrong, this was awesome , I drenched my salmon in lemon juice and seasoned with salt and lemon pepper before placing in the oven and the outcome was thee best piece of salmon with bok choy I have ever had.

We believe this to be the best recipe for salmon. The flavors and textures blended together beautifully; slight crunch to the base of the greens and velvety smooth salmon. Two recommendations; 1) remove the skin from the salmon before cooking and 2) toaste the corriander seeds before cracking. WONDERFUL!

I followed the recipe closely and the salmon (1/2" thick) was done perfectly. Loved the flavor, however, was not fond of the limp bok choy greens. Think next time I'll cut off the greens, cook the rest in a shallow Corningware casserole, and just throw the greens in for the last couple of minutes so it will retain some shape and color.

Have made this recipe again and again. We love it! Can't wait to serve it to family this holiday season.

This is a wonderful simple and healthy dinner. I followed recommendations from other reviewers and used parchment paper instead of foil. Also, I 1T of Orange Juice concentrate instead of OJ to reduce the amount of liquid. I served it over a bed of quinoa which soaked up any extra juice. Will definitely make this many times again!

Yum - made this for an early Valentine's Day dinner and the whole family enjoyed it (my fussy preschooler gobbled it up!). I probably doubled the "sauce" since it seemed pretty scarce and I'd read reviews about it not having as much flavour as it should. I subbed parchment paper for foil. Lovely and light - will def return to this one again.

This is a tasty, healthy recipe that requires a lot more time to cook. I used thick salmon fillets and needed 30 minutes. I made this once before with talapia (baked for 18 min.) and think it was better.

This was really good! I lightly salted the salmon before I added the sauce, and then everything again afterwards. I also put a bit of extra orange zest. It came out perfectly and was delicious over brown rice. Highly recommended.

Loved it. Recipe should state that skin should be removed from the salmon. We could not enjoy the bok choy because it was against the skin. Loved the flavor combination.

I was shocked at how good this recipe was! The flavor was amazing, as if I ordered it at an upscale restaurant. I didn't have minced ginger so I just put about a half teaspoon of ginger root powder in the sauce, which was great. On the side I made orange infused cous cous (just added OJ and orange zest to plain cous cous) and everyone at my dinner party finished their plates. The cilantro made it great and really fresh tasting! I have bookmarked this recipe and will definitely make it again soon.

Really great and super healthy. I followed it exactly. I saw one reader mentioned it was bland (??) Don't miss the step to lightly salt the salmon. The coriander seeds also add a really nice touch, and I would say use wild fresh salmon, NOT farmed Atlantic salmon which is fatty and has a bland taste. I may remove the skin next time before cooking, that way you can eat everything in the package (I pulled the meat off the skin while eating)

I did this recipe a bit different and it was really good! I put salt and pepper on the salmon fillets and cooked them in a non stick skillet. I cooked them for about 10 minutes and then added the mixture to the pan to cook. I omitted the bok choy altogether b/c my husband doesn't care for it. Served it with a side of veggies and basmati rice. Yum!

Do not waste your time on this dish. I couldn't imagine that a recipe with all these tasty ingredients could be so bland, but it is. A real disappointment!

The fist WAS done perfectly and it WAS delicious. We substituted halibut for the salmon and I would recommend the switch. It is a really good way to prepare fish which has been frozen. I do think the parchment would be a little better.

The salmon definitely took longer to cook and we found that what flavor was there went into the bok choy. The salmon got soft and we just prefer it a little firmer. Not worth making again.

This is a great "foundation" recipe. We got a "young adult" (not baby) Bok Choy and lemongrass in our CSA box this week, and I had 1/2 of a red onion to use up. So sauteed 1/2 c. minced red onion, 2 minced lemongrass stems, 2 cloves minced garlic, and a generous Tablespoon of minced ginger in a splash of Sesame Oil. Added about 1/3 cup pink grapefruit juice (it's what was on hand). Also had to use 2 T Oyster Sauce because Hoisin was gone. Mixed in Coriander Powder. Cut Bok Choy leaves lengthwise in 1/2" wide strips, placed in bottom of 8" square baking pan, laid single 15 ounce piece of skinless salmon on that, and poured sauce over. Baked 375 degrees for 15 minutes. Then sprinkled chopped fresh cilantro leaves on. Came out wonderful, didn't miss the foil packet hassle at all.

Fair at best. Bok Choy was mushy. Sauce was a bit sweet. I might adapt this and grill the salmon and bok choy then brush on the sauce.

First, I am not a big cilantro fan so I probably shouldn't have tried this recipe to begin with. But like others have said, it takes much longer than 15 minutes to cook and the bok choy came out slimy. Although this other recipe is much more involved, I think it is a much better use of salmon. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Wild-Salmon-with-Pearl-Couscous-Slow-Roasted-Tomatoes-and-Lemon-Oregano-Oil-231800

Made this with a 3lb salmon filet, baked at 400 degrees for 12 min. with the sauce brushed on top. Loved the flavor, do not over cook. Can't wait to make it with the bok choy.

I was unable to find coriander seeds at Whole Foods but overall this came out quite well. Agree with one of the other reviewers- it took way longer than 14 minutes to cook!

Made this dish following the recipe strictly and LOVED it! The salmon was nice and moist, the sauce was good, and it was cooked properly. Be sure to use *baby* bok choy so that it cooks thru. Next time, I will use parchment paper for a nicer presentation.

My wife made this for me tonight, and I thought it was delicious. The citrus added a nice touch, complementing the bok choy and salmon very well. She didn't like it much, but I think it was because she has a cold.

I thought this recipe was horrible and will never make it again. I followed it exactly, too. To me it tasted very bland and the bok choy came out quite mushy. However, my husband liked it and said he would eat it again. What a disappointing recipe because it looked so good from the picture and ingredients.

oh shoot, forgot to mention, my fish was NOT done in 12-14 min...more like 18.

The one ingredient I left out was cilantro, mostly because I forgot it at the store. I also added a few pinches of red pepper flakes to the bok choy before topping it with the fish. The salmon was great, though next time I will add more coriander seeds (I toasted them before crushing yum, looove coriander), and maybe a bit more orange zest. Of course don't forget to skin the salmon beforehand, nobody wants scale-y bok choy. I served this over quinoa.

I prepared this last night, and got rave reviews from my husband; only change I made was to skip the coriander as well as substitute Napa cabbage for the baby bok choy. I am on a strict, low-fat diet, so this dish was a wonderful change from just grilled meats. It is healthy, and VERY flavorful. We will definitely have it again soon.

Very, very good, even without the coriander and using frozen cilantro instead of fresh. Even my five- and two-year olds loved it, much to my astonishment. I don't know if I'd make it again for sure - I'd have to be in the mood of spending some time on this, coinciding with happening to have all the ingredients at hand - but I'd love to taste it some time again.

A Waste of Good Fish! If I'd wanted to eat the bok choy raw, I would not have put it in the oven. Flavor's just sort of ok, needs to be amped up. Will not repeat. And yes, my oven temp is accurate.

When an 11 year old takes a bite and remarks "fantastic", Bon Appetit has done it again. A dish doesn't get easier or faster. I increased orange peel, but completely forgot the cilantro. It didn't matter. Next time I'll increase bok choy, since it cooks down and peel the skin from the fish before cooking. The recipe is easy to double for more stomachs.

I forgot to mention in my last entry that I used no salt, added 1TBS soy sauce and cut down on the coriander seeds which we like but not love.

On a lark I tried this recipe. Oh my, did my husband love it! I served it over rice with the same sauce and it WILL be on our short list...YUMMMMMM!
