I used chopped dill fronds instead of seed and let it sit all afternoon. It was wonderful.

Perfect! I am Austrian and this is just like we serve it in Salzburg. Sometimes we add a little tomato. Light and refreshing.

Just like Mama's. I cannot even consider another cuke recipe! Of course, the fresher the cukes, the better the salad (this is the time of year...) I had no dill, so I used some Charnuska seeds; very flavorful, but very different than the dill flavor that is traditional. It is OK to skip the garlic on this one

My first time making a cucumber salad. Was a good compliment to the kielbasa and pierogi's I served it with. My boyfriend said it was very similar to his grandmother's that she used to make. Next time I will salt the cucumbers for a full hour, I was pressed for time so only let them sit about 20 minutes. I also used dried chopped dill because I couldn't find dill seed at the store.

For years I have tried to duplicate the wonderful cucumber salads I would get with my schnitzel or sauerbraten when I was stationed in Germany in the early 70s. This recipe is right on the mark, perhaps even better than I remember. I use it often and have made slight embellishments - i.e. a dash of cayenne or a few well diced roast red peppers etc. But really there is no need to do anything to this recipe. It is already excellent. Gut essen!

Nice but a little too sweet. I would reduce the sugar as the previous reviewer said. I also didn't have dill seed so I put in 1 tsp chopped dill.

I have family in Germay and I have been there often. This is just the way they make their cucumber salad (yes with garlic) and I have always loved it! I make it myself now almost weekly. The only difference I make to my recipe is not so much sugar. Only 1 tsp at the most. So refreshing, great to lighten a hearty meal.

Enjoyed this salad very much. Accompanies a heavy meal very nicely because it is so light and has no oil. Couldn't find dill seed so used dried and fresh dill instead. I cannot vouch for its authenticity, but it was delicious.

Made soup, this salad, a green salad, potato salad and for an Austrian buffet. Very good. Using English cucumbers is essential.

This has become a family favorite after I first made it at Thanksgiving a couple of years ago. A great alternative salad, light & crisp.

I made this to accompany a very fancy quiche, but the cucumbers became the hit of the meal. Simple--it won't convert cucumber-haters--but still fresh-tasting and excellent.

My mother was from Germany and she made this so I can attest to its authenticity (yes I know a few Austrians would object to being called a German; but let's face it - they are). Anyway, she also made a cucumber salad with sour cream and dill which also is very German. You'll find pretty good versions of it on this website. I much prefer that to this recipe.

As the son of a Viennese mother, I can state that this recipe follows exactly as she makes. Yes, the garlic is essential - germanic cuisine tends to be a little less exciting than Austro-Hungarian!

Ja, Sehr gut, aber kein Knoblauh (sp?) This is a Germanic staple! BUT I never heard of adding garlic. Garlic defeats the "point" of this recipe, which is to be a "mild" side who's purpose is to cleanse the palate between sides.

Nagjon jo, und sehr gut. Spicy, acidic, exactly what a cuke salad should be. Try it on your friends.
