I reviewed this in '06. It is still a favorite! I made no changes. I used a nice chuck roast that I cubed. I served it over mashed potatoes. YUM! I saw where some floured the beef. I don't. I have floured before and didn't like the results. I browned the meat in two batches. Don't crowd the beef or it ends up steaming and you end up with grey meat. I make mine in a large Creuset pot - great for this king of dish.

This recipe is remarkably similar to Cooks Illustrated's recipe of the same name from 1996. I smell copyright violationas well as an amazing aroma coming from the kitchen. The garden was overflowing with fresh thyme, so I used 5 sprigs, all removed before serving.

I really believe you should use beef stock in this recipe. Chicken stock just gives a wrong flavour and partly ruines the dish. Apart from that okay.

Rating: 3
Fantastic flavor! We threw in a potato and some mushrooms, too. Great recipe.

Rating: 4
Really simple, basic, and excellent. I used boneless beef ribs, cubed, so cooking time was less but still did it very slow for a couple hours. Also added sautéed muchrooms with the precooked carrots and peas...so much better than letting these veggies guys cook themselves to death in the stew. Thickend with a little flour/butter roux and the end. Lots of parsley over the top, mashed potatoes on the side and it was a wonderful meal

Great recipe! Tweaked it a bit in that I added the potatoes (Yukon golds) and carrots for the last hour of cooking and increased oven temp to 300, based on the reviews here. Noticed several people floured the meet before browning. Don't! The flour browns; not the meat, and you lose a lot of flavour. Learned this from America's Test Kitchen.

I've been making this stew for several years and have made some modifications along the way. I don't add flour but I do thicken the stew with 1/4 cup of water mixed with 3 tablespoons of cornstarch. I roast carrots with some olive oil, salt and pepper in a 400 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes. I add those to the cooked stew. I also make mashed potatoes and serve the stew over the potatoes. Very impressive.

I just made this recipe for the second time and it was delicious both times. The first time I had the oven at 300 and the second time at 200. Both times for about 2.5h. I think the beef came out more tender the second time. I added mushrooms and carrots at the end of the cooking time and served it over mashed potatoes. Can't wait to make this again!

I made this for dinner last evenng and it was outstanding. I did add the potatoes the last hour and did steam the carrots so they wouldn't get mushy. I followed the directions exactly, but set my oven to 300 degrees. An oven at 200 would take forever to complete.

Which came first, the Cooks Illustrated Recipe or this one from Epicurious. This recipe was in Epicurious quite a while ago. Either way, it sounds delicious and I can't wait to try. I like the fact that it uses chicken stock instead of beef stock, as I have a ton of my homade stock in the freezer. I must admit that I want to add some sort of mushroom as well as some potatoes though.

I just made this for dinner tonight and it was delish! I have to say I don't have a soup kettle so I just used my large pot. I did as the directions say for the first part and cooked the stew in the oven for 2 hours. I then put it on my stove threw the uncooked carrots in and cook for 20 minutes or until the carrots with soft but not mushy. I then add two large potatoes and cook for another 15 minutes. Add the end I added my frozen peas straight to the pot and just stirred. All the vegetables were cooked to perfection and I didn't have to dirty any other pots. This stew was fantastic and I will be making it again. By the way I feel like the flat leafed parsley at the end gives it such a wonderful freshness- do not omit.

Delicious recipe...I can never help myself so I added a few things. First of all I marinated the beef for a day in ziplock bag with chopped onion, garlic, thyme, rosemary, salt and olive oil. It tenderizes the meat, as well as making it very flavourful. Then I cooked everything on the stove, instead of the oven. Added an extra cup of broth and an extra 1/2 cup of red wine. Added some red pepper flakes for a little spice, and some tomatoe confit I had made earlier in the week. Cooked the meat for 1 hour at a medium simmer, then added raw chopped carrots and potatoes for another 25 minutes. Peas at the end. It really makes a difference to the flavour by cooking the veg with the stew. Delicious - and great as left-overs!!!

This was an exceptional recipe with one small change - I added the vegetables prior to putting the dish in the oven and the stew came out heartier and richer than imagined.

I'm new to stews. I had hoped my meat would become fork tender in the stew, but it remained somewhat tough. I bought the chuck from Whole Foods and cooked the stew for 2.5 hours. Should I have used a meat tenderizing hammer? Next day I put the leftovers in the oven for another 2 hours and it is about the same? Also, I don't have a soup kettle, so I used a 6 quart pan with lid. Any suggestions for next time?

I am new at making stews, but I cooked it for 4 hours at 200 degrees and it still wasn't cook. I had to finish it on the stove top for another 2 hours on med (on a good simmer). I used 3 1/2 lbs of beef, so I did increase the liquids by a cup or so. Overall the flavor was good, but nothing spectacular.

I made the stew with just a little chopped fresh rosemary instead of thyme and bay leaves, and I added raw carrots and potatoes to the pot for the the last hour (instead of cooking them seperately) and it turned out great.

I doubled the recipe for a church bonfire get together. I cut chuck roast into 3/4" pieces (two packages of chuck each 2.75 lbs. or so) and used two pans to brown the meat very well in batches without flouring, btw. Don't use high heat or it will burn. I used 1 bottle of Barefoot cabernet sauv. and 5 cans of Campbells Beef Broth with no added water. I also used 1/2 cup flour for the doubled recipe. I used the corect amount of doubled thyme. My oven temperature was 250 for about 5 hours or so. I did not add vegetables until the next day, when I then added al dente potatoes and carrots to the cold soup and reheated the whole pot right before serving. I did not use parsley because I didn't want to spend any more money on the stew. It was DELICIOUS!!

This is a great recipe. I used garlic salt in addition to regular salt to season the meat at the beginning, and rosemary instead of thyme. With about half an hour left to cook, I added halved cremini mushrooms, which added some texture to the stew. Adding a splash of Worcestershire sauce and 1/2 cup of dry sherry at the end gave it a really nice, rich flavor. I like my stew thick, so I upped the flour by 1 1/2 tablespoons.

Wow!! The family loved this recipe. I tried the 300 deg. 2.5 hour time and worked really well. The meat was very tender. To add to the flavor I add Chipotle Tobasco Hot Sauce 1 hour prior to the end of cooking and it really gave the dish some pep. Would easily try this again.

To the cook from NY, you may have used stew meat cut from the round or hindquarter. Don't as it is too lean and will become dry and tough. Use meat from the forequarter i.e. chuck or blade. As the recipe mentions, the shin bone is very good (I have one on the stove now), but if you do, make sure you use the bones as the marrow adds depth and richness to the stew.

Rating: 3
I also added mushrooms at the end. I put the carrots and potatoes in 1 hour before the end of cooking. But it really seemed like it needed 5 hours to get my meat stew tender, so I put it all back in the oven and they cooked a bit too long. But tasty even before it got completely cooked and tender.

Rating: 3
This was so GOOD. I made quite a bit of modifications, but I would just say - go with your gut. I dredged the meat in flour, added more wine and broth for a bit soupier stew, added potatoes, celery and corn, and I think it turned out fabulous.

I actually used game meat to make this. I made a few changes. I used fresh herbs(thyme, bay leaves) and added potatoes. I further added about 4 large caramelized shallots toward the end of the process. This gave the stew an incredible richness and extra kick well worth the time. Excellent stew.

I did not have trouble with the meat getting too dry.I used stew beef and browned it, not cooking the whole way through. After following all of the simmering instructions I threw everything in the slow cooker for a few hours. The meat was still very tender. I also added some cornstarch to make it thicker and a few dashes of worcestershire sauce to give it a little zip. Delicious and perfect for a chilly dreary northeast day.

Tried this today and it is simply delicious - just what you think of when you think "beef stew." I just made a couple of small changes - dredged beef in flour first, then browned; added 2/3 can (10 oz)of beef gravy instead of chicken broth and diluted with 1 can of water. Also added 1 cup of tomato sauce, frozen pearl onions and frozen corn last. This is a winner!

First time making beef stew, and it turned out great! Used 2 lbs of beef and added 1/4 cup of tomato paste. Cooked on low heat over stove top for 2 hours, added carrots and potatoes and cooked an additional 1.5 hours. The color was purple in the beginning which scared me, but when it was done cooking, the stew was the familiar shade of stew brown.

Ihave made this several times and I it just keeps getting better each time. I get quality stew meat which is the key. I also S&P the meat and then coat with flour and brown it with the coated flour. The pan gets really crusty but that makes for great stew. I also cook for 4 hrs. @ 200 and add a little more peas and carrots than recipe calls for. You can use pre-cut carrots and frozen pearl onions for simplicity-so good. Perfect over red-skinned mashed potatoes with popovers on a cold Sunday afternoon!

Rating: 3
Made last night with the following improvisions: used only 2 lbs of meat (we like lots of gravy to soak up with crusty bread), sliced rather than diced onions, used frozen sliced carrots and added about 1 lb of red pototoes cut into 2 inch chunks. Cooked for about 3 hours on the stove at low heat and added the carrots and potatoes about 1 hour before the end. Turned out rich and thick -- perfect for the frigid night. There was something missing from the flavors, but I'm not sure what it was (i'll check out some other beef stew recipies to see what other spices they use). Hubby agreed this came out really well for a first attempt at beef stew. Could be four forks with some tweaking!

I've made this a handful of times now and it's always delicious. The only change I make is adding a couple of spoonfuls of homemade tomato sauce right before adding the meat. It makes a richer, thicker sauce.

I cooked the carrots and potatoes separately and then added into stew for a few minutes at end to re-heat. This kept them from becoming too mushy. Also added one pound of thickly sliced mushrooms, sauted in about 3 tablespoons of butter and 2 tsps. of thyme and added at the end. I also increased the garlic and thyme used in the recipe. The whole house smelled great for several hours while we enjoyed the remainder of the Zinfandel we used and the stew was absolutely delicious on a rainy Sunday night!!

A great recipe - the classic beef stew that I've been looking for & super easy! I made it in a slow cooker. It took 9 hours. I used a cast iron skillet through deglazing with wine, then placed that in a 6 qt slow cooker. I then added the stock & herbs. After 5 hours I added the carrots & 3 potatoes, cubed. One hour before serving I adjusted for S & P, then added dry parsley & 2 cups of frozen peas. My teenage daughter who says she doesn't like meat devoured it & picked at the leftovers! She also bothered to tell me how much she loved it! A super easy & pleasing recipe.

I loved this stew. I had never made beef stew because it seemed like such a mystery to me. I have made this dish at least 4 times in the last 6 weeks and I have served it to company twice. They loved it and my husband is crazy about it. I really think the addition of a small can of tomato paste and the brown sugar make a difference. I also added mushrooms and the potatoes. Perfect for those chilly Minnesota autumn nights.

Have tried many beef stew recipes and my family loves this one best. I stick to basic recipe but vary amounts of ingredients according to how much I want to make. Used 7 lbs. of stew meat tonight to feed crowd this weekend! Perfect with mashed potatoes as suggested.

I loved this recipe which really surprises me because I thought I didn't like beef stew. I served it to my husband and friends and everyone cleared their plates. I steamed the potatoes before adding them I just wish I had done the same with the carrots. I used a Shiraz wine and it was perfect. I am making it again this weekend.

haha, reviewing this recipe a couple days later, I realize I forgot the peas! Oh well, it was still delicious. The only thing I did different was used boiler onions sliced in half because I wanted more onion and I like the look. Not that there is never a call for opening a bottle of wine but I found that Sutter Home makes these mini bottles in a 4 pack. Which was great when you don't want to open a whole bottle for a sauce. One was just under a cup so I just tossed in two. This was so yummy, and not sure why some reviewers gave it a poor rating but they must not have had good meat.

Yum, yum, yum. At 275 in my oven it simmered; I just kept turning up the heat from 200. The only problem I had was adding the carrots and potatoes about an hour before it was done -- they weren't cooked enough for me, probably because the simmer was so slow. Next time I'll just add them in with everything else at the beginning. A great stew.

Simple and tasty. Did not cook in the oven...on the stove-top for about 3 hours on low. Added the potatoes in just long enough to cook them. Beware of the color of this stew, however. Yikes! It looks like black-bean soup...which is fine if it IS black bean soup; thus, added the only thing I could find in the cupboard: a can of tomato soup. Helped a lot! Everyone really liked this stew.

Simpy the best! Made it for a hungry husband and son on a frigid January day. They raved! I did, however, follow the advice of other reviewers and cooked it on top of the stove. I substituted beef broth for the chicken, and had to use Marsala for the red wine (alas, the cupboard was bare!). I also added white button mushrooms and a tablespoon or so of tomato paste. I added the carrots about an hour before it was done, throwing in the frozen peas at the last minute. I served it over mashed potatoes. The best stew ever. I'll be making this one for a long time to come.

Very tasty! I used Shiraz and added potatoes with the peas & carrots. I ended up cooking it on the stove (on low for approx. 3 hours) because my oven doesn't heat properly below 300.

I agree with many reviewers before me. I added the carrots and potatoes before putting the pot into the oven. I added tomato paste to add depth. I also needed to increase the oven temp. to soften the veggies and potatoe. I think this is a really good BASIS but it could use all the amendments people recommended.

This is a great base recipe for first time stew-ers. However, it can be a bit bland. Definitely add potatoes and carrots- no need to use another pan, just put them in about an hour before. Also, next time I will use pearl onions as the chopped onions will disappear. To add flavor and color, I added some tomato paste and gravy master and it really lent depth, flavor and color to the stew. Overall, a really great meal for Sunday to Tuesday on a fall night!

Following suggestions from several earlier reviewers, I made these changes from the basic recipe. First I slow-cooked the beef in large chunks in the crockpot for 12 hours on low, adding the wine (Shiraz), chicken broth, garlic, bay leaves and thyme. I then removed the beef, separated it from the fat and cut it into smaller pieces. I then strained the liquid, put it back in the crockpot, added small cooker onions and the carrots, a diced red pepper, 3 tablespoons of soy sauce, 2 teaspoons of ground ginger, and 2 strips of orange peel, then cooked for 4 hours on high. I then added back the beef and let the whole thing cool overnight in the refrigerator. An hour or so before serving the next day, I slow-heated the stew, added some sauteed mushrooms and green peas. Just before serving, I added cornstarch mixed in water to thicken. This was a wonderful stew, with very tender meat and a delicious broth.

I was impressed with the texture and richness of the broth, despite relatively few ingredients. I used pearl onions, beef broth, and didn't have red wine so used about 2/3 white and 1/3 sherry: my guess is none altered significantly. I also don't have an oven-proof soup pot, so I slow-cooked it on the stovetop, about an hour, added raw carrots and parboiled baby yukon potatoes, and slow cooked it another hour. I like the flavor the slow-cooked carrots add to the broth so I recommend adding them raw, earlier. Served over egg noodles - yum.

A classic and easy beef stew. Try adding a tablespoon of ground ginger to the flour,and several strips of orange peel, three tablespoons of oyster sauce and two of soy sauce into the final mix.

Since there's only two of us, I halved the receipe, made the beef part and slightly cooked the carrots (added potatoes too)at the same time. Brought the beef and veggies up to temp. on top of the stove then put all in the oven @350 for about one hour, added frozen peas and mushrooms at the last. This was great, loved the oven method.

This was a good, hearty beef stew for a cold winter's day. Pretty good balance of flavors and textures, though next time I will drain off more of the fat after browning the meat. I also thought it was a little too thick; I would probably reduce the amount of flour next time. I had a problem with the oven cooking method : after 3 hours the beef was still very tough and chewy (and I used a oven thermometer so I know it was at the correct temperature). I finally just took it out and simmered it on the stove until the meat was tender. Overall, we liked it enough on a snowy day, but needs some tweaking.

Rating: 3
This is a good and easy recipe though if you're kids don't like fat on the beef make sure to trim it all before hand. After the beef was browned I should have added more oil as the onions ate up any liquid and adding the flour just has it burning at the bottom of the pot. I used the oven method and added the carrots 90 min before the end but they were still too crunchy so wouldn't advise that. Otherwise it's a tasty stew.

Wow! This stew is great. My husband even liked it and he doesn't like wine in food. really tasty. i made it as described and had no problems. i did increase the over temp to 215 because my oven has problems heating at 200. i will make this again!

I thought this was a good recipe for stew with alot of flavor. I added my vegetables (including potatoes and excluding peas) and found after 1 1/2 hours in the oven at 200 degrees that it was not simmering. So I transfered the stew to the stove top for an hour and it turned out wonderful. I a did add a half can of tomato paste and I used beef stock instead of chicken broth. I also thickenend it a little with cornstarch and water. It is a keeper. The whole family, including in-laws, loved it.

This was the best stew I've ever made. I'm not a big stew eater but the flavor was incredible. Slow is definate the key - these flavors need time come together and slow heat also breaks down the fiber of the meat making it extremely tender. If you have stew eaters this is your recipe;)

Rating: 4
This is a GREAT basic recipe! The KEY is low and slow. Also, sometimes Stew Meat is a wee bit more spendy so use Chuck, Blade or Simmering Steak and cut it up yourself. I like to add some green chile with the garlic, a can of tomatoes and either chicken or beef stock. Throw in some sauteed mushrooms near the end adds another texture. ALWAYS better the next day.

This was an awesome dish. I made a few changes. Added mushrooms, whole can of tomato paste, beef broth instead of chicken, double red wine, and had ribeyes that I used for beef(sad I know, but it was snowing and we didn't want to grill). Added raw vegies straight to pot. No need to steam separately. It only had to cook for 11/2 hours and the best ever!

Rating: 3
I accidentally added an entire bottle of wine...just compensated by adding extra broth and it was delicious. Because I'd added all of this liquid, I needed to reduce the sauce a bit (I removed the meat before reducing) and I thickened it with a beurre manie. I'm not sure it needed it - was probably rich enough without it. This is worth making in advance - it's much better the second or third day.

This is an excellent stew! I made it twice alread, the first time I followed the instructions exactly. Second time I saute bacon separately, sauted the onions in the bacon drippings. I also added chopped mushrooms and corn. I would make this over and over again, sooooo good.

This was an excellent tasting stew. Everyone raved about it! I made mine on top of the stove in a cast iron stew pot, rather than in the oven. Cook time was about the same.

Ver-r-r-r-y Good! One of the most satisfying stews I have had. We served it with creamy mashed potatoes (Over them really). Just the way Sunday Dinners were meant to be.

Wonderful! I browned the whole beef shanks. Put whole in slow cooker. Followed the rest of the recipe up to the peas. I chunked baby carrots, added several squirts of tomato paste concentrate & fresh thyme. Let it go all day--8-9 hours on low. I removed the shanks to a plate & broke into bite size pieces. I turned the temp up to high, made a burre manie (equal parts room temp butter & flour mixed together)& added it to thicken the gravy. I then added the peas & some quartered fresh mushrooms. Added the meat & served it over dill smashed potatoes. It was wonderful the 1st night. But hubby said even better the next. Advised me to cook it ahead for that reason. Great dish for company! I suggest rotating the shanks so that they cook evenly.

I made this dish for my husband, who gave it rave reviews (I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't actually eat it!). I followed the recipe exactly, simmering for close to 3 hours, and served it over mashed potatoes. He said the meat was very tender and the flavor great.

This was delicious! I substituted green olives for the peas, and threw some bacon in at the end. The sauce is wonderful and goes well with lumpy mashed potatoes. I've also tried just leaving it on the stove instead of sticking it in the oven and found that it works out just as well. Tastes better on day two, if it lasts that long.

Truly a great stew recipe, and a good springboard for variations (within reason -- this IS Cook's Illustrated, after all!). It's worthwhile to use good wine, although long cooking is a big help to the deficiencies of a student's budget! I do usually need to reduce a bit on the stovetop at the end of cooking time, although others might like the thin gravy. Good over mashed potatoes, but rich -- a green salad's a must.

Recipe was great with a few changes.I added crushed bay leaves, celery, and potatoes. Though I am sure the recipe would have been delicious with I needed to use them before they went bad. The stew is great comfort on a cold day, I too cooked it in the crock pot all work day and only added the veggies the last hour.

To Susana from Luxembourg who asks "why chicken stock"? Another great cookbook from Cook's Illustrated called, "The Best Recipe", gives this explanation: "We tested 11 commercial beef broths ...they simply did not deliver full-bodied, beefy flavor. By contrast, canned chicken broths are far superior." They recommend Campbell's or Swanson low sodium. (both are owned by the same company.)I tried both, beef and chicken, and chicken WAS better. I think the red wine is really the trick. : )

This was my first time trying to use the crockpot and it was fantastic. I followed the recipe through adding the wine to the pan, and then transfered it all to the crockpot with carrots and baby red potatoes. I cooked it on low all day--I work a long day--and when I came home, I added the peas and some seasonings. I'm getting ready to eat the leftovers for lunch. YUMMY.

Excellent stew recipe. Served it over mashed potatoes for a perfect cold weather dinner. I skimmed the stew of the fat after removing from the oven and I thickened the stew slightly with a cornstarch slurry. Can't wait to try the leftovers that I put in the freezer during the next snowstorm.

I liked this stew a lot, and I liked the idea that I didn't have to dredge the meat in flour first, although next time, I think I'll cut back on the pepper, since it left a fiery taste in my mouth, and my 7 yr. old son didn't like that aspect of it. I used a Cabernet Sauvignon. I had my oven at 250 degrees and after 3 hours I took it out. I added the carrots in the last hour and just let them simmer in the stew, as well as some parboiled potato chunks. Then during the last 10 minutes I added the peas. It still did not look thick enough, so I added 2 tbsns. of tomato paste and some salt, and it came out great! My husband liked this better than my usual beef stew, so this will be my recipe from now on. I also took the advice of a previous reviewer and left the pieces of meat large, and then cut them after the stew was done, they were yummy and tender.

my family and I really enjoyed this so much i will make it again. I did change it a little, i put all the ingrediets into the crock pot after i browned the meat off and onion etc. I left it in the crock pot also with fresh carrots for about 5 hours, melt in your mouth. I used lambrusco as the wine, delish!!!!!

Enjoyed this. Great Basic Beef Stew, was a fisherman from Out O' Gloucester the cook made beef stew. Great stuff when the weather got rough. This, crusty bread and a good Canadian Beer.

Excellent. But why chicken stock? I used beef, being unable to think of why I'd use chicken in a beef stew. Also, used fresh thyme and bay leaves. Even better the next day, although with everyone having big second helpings, there was not much left. Also, fresh thyme and bay

This is about the best beef stew I ever had. I can't believe how easy it is. It is enough to feed quite a crew...the rest will go into the freezer. PS. I added chunks of red potatoes aong with the carrots and peas!!! GREAT!!!

My entire family (including small children) loved this stew. I served it over noodles. We've tried many, many recipes and this is by far our favorite. We liked it so much, we bought the book!

This turned out very well. I added an extra bouillon cube, and a little bit of worcestershire and soy sauce (about 1 or 2 tsp. each). The flavor was very rich and full, and the red wine was a great addition. My husband absolutely loved it, and said I'd outdone myself this time. I'm sure this would be just as good with different veggies as well. This one's a keeper!

I have tried various beef stew recipes over the 31 years I've been married and this is by far the best one I've made. I added 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and used canned beef broth. I cooked it at 225 degrees for 2 1/2 hours. My husband is raving about this dish! I'll definitely make it again.

Having read all of the rave reviews, I was a little bit disappointed with this one. It's a nice stew recipe, but nothing to write home about.

This was absolutely delicious! I served creamy mashed potatoes with this and a green salad and we couldn't get over what a great cold weather dish it is! Adding carrots at the end was a great idea. A+ meal!

Great stew! I made the following changes: cooked the stew meat at 225 degrees for 2 1/2 hours and at the end added two tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken the broth. I served it over mashed potatoes the first night and had it over rice the second - I recommend both. Very, very tasty; adding the carrots and peas last makes for very interesting texture and strong color.

I am a novice cook and found this recipe easy to make and delicious. I reduced the red wine on the stove first and ended up using a 375ml bottle. I was a bit concerned about this as I am not a wine drinker. However it turned out great. I did not find it had a strong wine flavor.

Great stew recipe. I used higher temp - 250 for 2 1/2 hours. Meat was very tender. Added can of diced tomatoes, and put boiled potatoes and turnips in and heated for about 10 minutes in stew at end in addition to peas and carrots. Excellent left overs - a definite keeper.

This stew was very flavorful, I used red cooking wine and it worked fine. There is no wine taste (one critic mentioned the wine as a reason for not liking the stew) but I am sure it adds to the flavor so don't leave it out. I thought the stew would be too thick, but it was perfect. The idea of serving the stew over mashed potatoes was a great one!

If I could rate this recipe with a 0 I would have. Maybe it is becuse I dont like red wine. But this recipe was terrible. My husband thought so too. As well as my mother and my mother in law.

This is in Feb1996 cook's illustrated. It states that a temp over 200F will boil your meat, risking a drier, tougher meat. It also has you pull the meat from the oven after 1hr and add your potatoes and carrots, then cook about 1 1/2-2 hrs until meat is tender. But on a later footnote, it tells you can do as this recipe above tells you since the h2o from the veges can make it watery [but I like my potatoes and carrots to cook w/ it in order to soak in some of the beefy flavors.] I substitute grape juice concentrate for wine usually.At the end, I add dumplings. Delicious! It definately tastes better w/ crushed or whole tomatoes added - at least that's what I grew up with and still like it (hubby & 3 kids approve, too!) I cook this on the stove sometimes too if the oven is busy baking dessert/something else. Just don't let it cook past a simmer. freezes well in single servings/larger, just a bit more watery when thawed

For the cooking time and temp, bring to simmer atop the stove, put in 240 oven for about 2 1/2 hours, checking at 2 hours. Thicken with beurre manie if necessary. Also, works well with four pounds meat rather than three.

My wife made this one and she feels it would be a great dish to make a day or two ahead of time. Certainly an appropriate hearty cold evening meal. She would even recommend it as a small dinner party dish over mashed potatoes or rice. I stress "small" party. I think the dish only serves 4 not 6-8. My wife and I ate it 2 days in a row, once over mashed potaotes and once over rice. There wasn't even a bite left for the dog. It's better the second day. 300 degrees is more accurate not 200. Pepper may be a little heavy for some as stated. Sneak up on it to taste... I think it's quite a bit of work for stew. Less meat and more vegetables may suit some. All in all, it appears to be the best stew recipe avaliable in Epicurious so far. I think we'll try the Irish Stew next...No one has tried or rated it yet.

When making stew recipes, try this suggestion. Cut the meat into three or four-inch pieces. Brown these pieces according to recipe, and complete the recipe. Just before serving, cut the beef chunks into bite-size pieces. You'll love the really tender results.

It was simple, easy and delicious. I placed it in a 300 degrees oven for two and a half hours. The beef was super tender and flavorful. Ask your local butcher to prep three pounds of flat iron roast for beef stew.

A wonderful winter meal! I cooked it @250 for about 3 1/2 hours and the meat was tender and tasty. Next time I will make a triple batch and freeze it. I served it over a baked potato. My husband said the left overs were even better.

Is the oven temperature that is listed for this recipe correct?? I made this yesterday and after three hours of cooking, the beef should have been very tender. However, the inside of the beef chunks were still pink and they were a little chewy so I know that they didn't cook the whole time... Should it be 300 degrees instead? (200 degrees isn't even boiling temp...)

This recipe has such a rich flavor and was the perfect entree for a cool New England fall dinner. Of course, I added extra garlic to the recipe. I also did add steamed baby potatoes to the stew and thickened the juices with a mixture of broth and cornstarch. Delicious!

Absolutely rich and delicious, I never made stew before and I scored with this one. The only problem was that the gravy isn't thick enough. I added cornstarch after heated up for the second time.

Great stew recipe ! I made it Friday and we had leftovers just yesterday (Sunday) ! I added a tad bit of worcheschire and did the potatos instead of peas... when I re-heated, added some fresh tomatos from the garden - made it very good ! Next time, I'll use little pearl onions, instead of regular onions. This is definitely a keeper recipe !

A good standard stew. I found it a little too labor intensive for the result. I used corn instead of peas-- yummy.

I make a triple batch of this recipe, omitting the peas, then freeze in serving-sized containers. On the days I want to serve, I defrost as many servings as I need, heat to almost boiling, then toss in some frozen french-cut green beans & cook for another minute. With some fresh rolls, this is an easy way to have a delicious weeknight dinner. -- Busy New Mom With No Time to Cook
