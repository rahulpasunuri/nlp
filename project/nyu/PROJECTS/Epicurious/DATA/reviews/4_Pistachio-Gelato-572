I initially thought about straining the nuts out, but I couldn't get myself to just throw them out, so I left them in. I'm so glad I did! I loved the added texture. I thought this gelato was very rich. And way too sweet. I would even try cutting the sugar in half and maybe use one less egg yolk. I didn't add any almond extract or food coloring. I have an ice cream maker, but decided to make popsicles instead. After chilling the custard for 3-4 hours, I poured it into six 3-oz molds (perfect amount!) and froze overnight. Texture was 100% there, and so was flavor! But definitely reducing the sugar next time.

This was exceptional! I agree that the almond extract is a bit potent. I liked it better with 1/2 - 3/4 of a tsp.

This came out pretty good but didnt taste like true pistachio gelato to me. More than one person asked if it had amaretto in it. I also didnt use the food coloring. If I were to make again I would probably cut back the extract to about 3/4t and reduce the sugar just a bit.

Delicious! I did not use the food coloring and it was plenty green. I did strain the custard before cooling because otherwise it was too grainy. I think SALTED chopped pistachios on top would be awesome.

I ended up using Stonyfield Organic 2% fat milk for this, and only adding 3/4 tsp. almond extract, and the flavor/texture was amazing. I didn't add the food coloring, since I don't think that's necessary. The color had a faint green color from the ground pistachios already. Excellent and would make again.

great gelato- a tad bit too sweet for my tasting, will decrease the amount of sugar the next time. also opted to add a lil more pistachios and not to add the food coloring- turned out to be the right shade of green for me.

My family loves this gelato. Tastes like true gelato. Make this every summer.

I made this for my family and it got rave reviews - and that's saying a lot cause we're first generation Italians - I agree with the folks that said it's just like the gelato you get in Italy.

Very good recipe, nice texture and flavor. We did strain it and there is still a bit of texture that remains.

I agree with the reviewer who suggested straining the nuts out - the texture was a bit too grainy to be true gelato. Looked and tasted fantastic though - just like the gelato from our favorite gelateria. I left out the food coloring. I'd also like to share a tip to avoid scrambling the yolks - add a ladleful of the hot milk mixture to the egg yolks and mix well, to temper them, before combining the two mixtures completely and returning it to the heat.

Dang. Third time is a charm! The first time I tried this, my heat was too high and I got pistachio scrambled eggs. The second time, my ice cream maker wasn't cold enough so it never set. But this time, I got it! Fantastic, will make over and over again. I personally like the pistachio chunks, but strained would also be good.

Phenomenal -as good as Venice and our favorite gelateria in Portland! I'd strain the pistachio chunks next time. Used the whisk versus beaters to reduce air bubbles and make it smoother.

For the person who used lemon extract and rated this blah shouldn't be giving reviews. I made the recipe without any modifications and it was excellent. It tasted just like the gelato we had in Italy.

This recipe is fantastic! Takes just like the gelato I had in Florence. The recipe is foolproof. I accidentally processed all the sugar with the pistachios and it still came out delicious. Didn't use the food coloring so that the finished product would look more authentic. I would recommend straining the custard base before putting it in your ice cream machine. Makes the gelato more smooth.

We made this just days after our return from Italy, and were so impressed with the result; it tasted just like a gelato I'd sampled there. This is a great recipe. I think the almond extract is essential - it really rounds out the pistachio flavor.

This gelato is wonderful, on its own, or with cookies, espresso, etc...I you don't care for the extra green color, leave it out. Also, I love it with the addition of 1/2 cup toasted, chopped pistachios, added after the gelato has thickened. A note to the complaint about texture - many gelato recipes do require eggs or yolks. The classic gelato texture tends to result from a slower freezing method, that allows less air to be "beaten" into the mix. A simple hand-crank machine can accomplish this goal.

Really great, very nutty. Next time I will omit 1 egg yolk and maybe add some ground almonds. Didn't have the food coloring so mine looks like guacamole. Next time will use some.

I agree that anyone who alters a recipe, then complains about the result, is unfairly wasting the time of people who honestly want to help others enjoy good recipes & good cooking. Go away, would ya?

This is a fantastic recipe for a true pistachio lover! Intense flavor and creamy texture without being as high fat as the ice cream recipes. The person who used lemon in place of almond and then gave it a low rating is ridiculous... you make a poor substitution and then complain? As is, this recipe is excellent.

Fussy for so-so end product. Used lemon extract rather than almond since serving with lemon cookies to finish off an Italian dinner party. Just blah.

Good Ice Cream. Not Gelato. Very rich! Everyone loved it, just beware that the egg yolks make it very rich and "ice-creamy".

Everyone loved this dessert. Served it with the cornmeal diamonds as recomended. Easy because I could make it ahead of time. Will make over and over again.

Toscanini's, a great great ice cream shop in Cambridge, MA, makes some fabulous pistachio ice cream that they've dubbed "Not Dyed-Green Pistachio Ice Cream." Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it? Who needs the food coloring? It's very pretty without it.

This was wonderful! Full of flavor and easy to make. I know a lot of people who will enjoy this this summer with light cookies.
