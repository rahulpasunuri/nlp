I reduced the amount of lemon. Thought it might be too lemony and I liked it as I did it. Lemon is strong and tends to overpower a mild flavor like pork tenderloin. I added some artichoke quarters and made more sauce than would result from the recipe as stated, thickening it with corn starch in sherry. Wonderful recipe. The capers were great. I think I will try it again and see if green peppercorns are a nice variation.

I'm not to into lemon with pork either. I'm going with white wine and less chick stock. Sauce is great with chicken and use Meyer lemons!

Pretty decent for a simple, easy recipe. Definitely reduce the lemon and thicken. Of course, it is hard not to like something that is SO loaded with butter--butter is very forgiving!

WAY too sour...

Very Tasty. I backed off the lemon just a bit and it was perfect. The capers gave it a small crunchy texture.

As good as this recipe is, there is a similar one on this site that, in my opinion, is better. (See: Crisp Pork Medallions with Creamy Caper Sauce.) My only problem with this recipe is the lemon with the pork. However, the sauce here rates four forks when served over sautéed chicken breasts, and for that use, I will make it again.

My family and I really enjoyed this - and it's SO fast and easy. I used a small spoonful of cornstarch (mixed with water) to thicken sauce. I loved the tang. My 1 year old couldn't get enough of it! I arranged the meat & sauce over a mound of rotini pasta since I didn't have time to make rice. It was really a great meal.

My guests loved this pork! I did make more of the sauce and added more capers. Will make again.

This was delicious, however as others have said the sauce was a touch too tart. I will reduce the lemon a bit and also add a bit of flour to the sauce as others recommended for next time.

Way too tart with the given proportion of lemon to broth. Had to add twice as much broth to reduce the pucker. Given that there is probably some variability in tartness of lemons, I will next time reduce the broth, then add the lemon a spoonful at a time. I also used a little flour to thicken the sauce. Overall a nice, simple recipe that could be used with a variety of meats and cuts.

Quick, easy, and yummy. I added a little flour to thicken the sauce.

I think this kind of sauce is nicer on pounded, floured chicken breasts. I did double the sauce, as others recommend. I also substituted a little white wine for some of the broth, added finely grated lemon zest, and served with lots of italian parsley. I found it a bit tart and forgot that usually I add a little bit of sugar to this kind of sauce. My whole family ate it up, but I think I'd go back to chicken next time -- somehow pork has much better companions than capers.

This was absolutely delicious! So simple and yet so tasty. Be ready for a strong, lemony sauce. 7min of reduction may be too much. I ended up adding a little extra broth in the end. This so good, and the pork ends up really tender. Quick, too!

Nice balance of flavors...not too lemony for my husband. My "non-pork eating" daughter makes this with boneless,skinless chicken breasts and it is equally as good as with pork.

Yummy! Will make again and again!

Quick, easy, not fabulous, but definitely something to use I need something fast that uses ingredients (other than the tenderloin) that I'm likely to have on hand.

Easy and delicious. The sauce definitely makes this recipe 4 forks. This will become one of those quick weeknight meals for us.

When I serve this for a dinner party for 8, I saute 4 whole tenderloins in 2 tablespoons oil and 3 tablespoons butter until brown on all sides,transfer to shallow baking dish and bake for 20-30 minutes until thermometer registers 155. While pork is roasting, I make the sauce and then add the pork juices after slicing. I agree with other reviews that "the more sauce the better."

I was almost afraid to use the amount of pepper stated after reading the reviews. But we did not find it too peppery. Good simple dinner, try it.

Good, but not awesome. The sauce was good, and as prior reviewers have suggested, I doubled the recipe for that. Not the best pork recipe in this database.

This is a company-quality dish that is so easy to make, but tastes like you put a lot of prep into it. I agree with the previous rater who said to double the sauce. It's delicious.

Amazingly simple and quick, and won rave reviews from all around the table. A keeper, and one so easily committed to memory.

Easy and fast. We wanted more sauce because it was so tasty. I had to use two saute pans to get it made quickly.

This recipe was fabulous! Quick and easy too! I chose not to add the optional lemon segments and doubled the sauce recipe, the fresh chopped chives are a must. I served this winner with rice and balsamic roasted baby carrots, my boyfriend went back for more!

This recipe was very good and I will make it again with one change. I love pepper and buy mine from a spice mail order company. For that reason, it may be more potent than what one normally finds in the stores. I found that the 1 T. was far too overwhelming...even as a pepper lover. Next time, I'll use much less. The lemon sauce was great and I'll probably double those amounts next time.

Liked it but would not use as much pepper when I make it again. Otherwise great!

Very good and very easy. My husband just loved it. If it seems a little too lemony, sprinkle the medallions with a little salt. Soooo good.

This was great, and I threw it together in just about 35 minutes with some steamed green beans and a box of prepared Pasta with Tomato Parmesan! Obviously, with a little more time and care, this could be the best part of a meal for guests and/or holidays.

I am married and a mother of two toddler boys: I have been making this recipe now for a few years and it has become a favorite of ours. I sometimes substitute chicken breasts for the pork and I always add a little wine to the stock. Yum Yum.

This is a great recipe. We make a lot of pork tenderloin dishes because of the low fat and calorie content. We grill, saute, roast, etc. This was sooo easy and delicious. The meat came out perfectly, nicely pink and the lemon and caper sauce was delightful! Would definitely try this again!

This was a great dish the whole family loved it(including the kids). Would make a great meal for company. This will become one of our familys special occasion meals.

This is my favorite tenderloin recipe.... I cut back on the capers a little and added a little more lemon juice... It was wonderful!!

This was so easy and delectable. I served the pork med-rare w/ the lemon and wild rice w/ sauteed cherry tomatoes, yum!!

Fast and easy but lemon overpowered the pork. Less lemon juice and if chopped up lemon slices are used - perhaps just a small amount. This is potentially a four fork dish if the port is just a wee bit undercooked. Only an opinion.

This recipe can be made and served in less than 45 minutes, perfect for a casual supper or a dressed up dinner. Adding the optional diced lemon made the sauce more appealing.
