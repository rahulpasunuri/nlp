Simple, elegant, and delicious. The trick to ending up with succulent roasted grapes and shallots is to tuck small clusters around the base of the chicken. Otherwise, they will end up burnt, as I learned once the hard way.

I have made this so many times I have lost count - my guests can't believe how delicious it is and how easy. Just a note: I have always found it odd when someone gives a recipe 2 forks, criticizes the result and doesn't follow the instructions or ingredients. Just really odd.

I used boneless chicken thighs. Skipped the shallots which I didn't have and added a clove of garlic instead. I liked the grapes but the chicken is pretty tasteless. I recycled it the next night on a frying pan (without the grapes) until the juices have evaporated into a glaze and the chicken is brown. I then added a tbsp of barbecue sauce. Then it was much better.

i had very low expectations for this dish; it looked like roast chicken with some burnt grapes. boy was I wrong. This is ABSOLUTELY one of the best recipes here. The grapes carmelized the shallots beautifully, and it all came together ... sumptuous is the only word to describe it, and that falls short. it's wonderfully simple to make, delightfully complex in flavor ... six forks!

The chicken came out okay but the grapes and shallots turned into black lumps of charcoal after an hour in the oven.

I used bone-in chicken breasts instead of cooking the entire chicken. this is FABULOUS. Make it and enjoy!

Easy to make, even after a long day at work. Enjoy a glass of wine and the evening news whilst it roasts. The supermarket was out of shallots, so I used sweet onions and garlic. It was divine!

So easy and so good. It's one you'll eat again and again....

This is such a wonderful, simple but impressive recipe. The only change I made was to separate all the grapes. The chicken came out moist and the grapes are yummy. I have made it twice for dinner parties and it's been a hit.

You will need two hours for this recipe, considering the chopping you need to do, as well as the resting time for the chicken. I disagree with the suggestion to place the grapes in at different times. The grapes that are not fully roasted taste too much like, well, grapes, and are not as tasty as the grapes that cooked with the chicken for the full hour and fifteen minutes.

Excellent. I split two cornish hens and butterflied them and boned as much as I could. This meal is really good and easy to prepare. The grapes are fabulous and the shallots round off the whole dish. I can see using this combo with pork and fish. Yummy.

I used chicken parts and baked for one hour/ten minutes. My husband and I thought this was delicious! My finicky kids (4 of them) liked it but didn't love it. I thought they would like the idea of grapes but no one liked that part. Served with roasted potatoes and asparagus. I would make it again!

Fantastic recipe. My modifications: Used 6 boneless, skinless breasts (tenderloins removed) instead of a whole chicken. I removed the grapes from their stems and sliced them all in half and added 3 cloves of garlic to the grape/shallot mixture. While doing the grape/shallot prep, I let the chicken marinate (in the pan) in Lawry's Seasoned Salt, Black Pepper, Thyme sprigs, and Olive Oil. Served with fresh green beans, sauteed with butter, salt, pepper, and a dash of garlic powder. Turned out beautifully, and reheated very well as leftovers.

I used bone-in, skin-on breasts and omitted the shallots. Put everything on a sheet pan, and roasted for about 40 minutes. Served with roasted garlic potato and cauliflower puree. Be sure to make plenty of grapes...Delicious and healthy!

I wasn't sure how cooked grapes would be. But everyone in my family (kids 4, 8 & 12) loved it. It is very simple to prepare yet very elegant. Could easily be served for company. Delicious!

This turned out absolutely amazing! I had never roasted a chicken before and the only thing I changed was add a 2 cloves of garlic to the grape/ shallot mix. Will definitely make again!

Best roast chicken yet - crispy skin (probably used more oil and more salt than recipe calls for). I didnt end up with much in the way of "cooking juices" though - any suggestions? Next time, I'll put in the grapes gradually as suggested in another review (and w no stems).

Delicious and simple, with an elegant presentation. I have made it four times now, sometimes using onions,sometimes shallots, and usually adding extra thyme. A splash of white wine is a nice addition.

I agree that this is delicious and easy. While we were eating, my genius husband suggested that we use the leftovers for chicken salad sandwiches with the grapes and all. As it turns out, it was breakthrough idea that I recommend. He ran a few of the shallots in the food processor, then mixed with the leftover meat and grapes. Amazing!

I wanted to amend my earlier review. Although it took much longer to make than I had originally planned, I must say it was very good! I'd make it again, just with the added knowledge that cooking time is more like 2-2.5 hours instead of 1 hour 10 minutes.

I haven't even had a chance to try this yet, but I just wanted to say that's it's a bit false to file this under the "Quick & Easy" category! It says to roast for 1 hour 10 minutes at 400 degrees, but my chicken has been in the oven for 2.5 hours and it's still not done! Granted it's a bit larger (5 pounds instead of 4), and this my first time cooking a whole chicken, but I had no idea that it would be such a time suck! My family expected dinner on the table more than an hour ago, so here's to hoping it tastes good cause otherwise this kind of ruined the evening.

This is one of the easiest and best recipes I have ever made - and I love to cook and the more complicated the better, but there are nights - last minute guests - when a simple but exquisite dish is just what the cook ordered. I echo the sentiment from the cook in Cleveland. The grapes were wonderful and the chicken was moist and very tasty. I took the grapes off the vine this time - I didn't like the branches in the dish. I used Bulgar cooked in vegetable broth as a side (with sliced almonds and cranberries) and the juices from the chicken together with the bulgar blended into a very delicious meal. Thanks to Epicurious for this recipe

just so so, not much flavor, the grapes and shallots added little

Totally simple and really delicious. The roasted grapes give it that extra punch. We served it with smashed butternut squash and a simple arugula salad. Would totally make again.

I've made this twice and it is really delicious. I actually have grapes sitting in the fridge waiting for me to cook this again. I do removed the grapes from the stalks instead of adding them in clusters. Other than that I think this is simple, delicious and lovely.

This recipe is excellent as written. The grapes release juices that naturally concentrate into the simplest - yet elegant - sauce. My wife thought that I had reduced balsamic vinegar for the yummy sauce - in fact I simply served the pan juices as described! The only change I made (to address earlier comments) was to add the grapes in thirds during the cooking time (with 45, 30, and 15 minutes left of cooking the chicken). This resulted in a mix of plump, cooked, and caramelized grapes that were served around the plated chicken. Rounded out the meal with roasted new potatoes. This small chicken would not be enough in my view to serve four adults, but was perfect for two adults and two small children with small appetites (by the way, the kids did like this meal).

Just good, not great. The shallots were the best part of the dish. Grapes become so dry and shriveled up there is hardly any juice or flavor left from them which was disapointing. Might try this again but roast grapes for less amount of time and perhaps mash them into the sauce.

Simple, delicious, and elegant. The family loved it and I will make it again.

Outstanding recipe! I've made this twice - first with whole chicken as recommended, then with thigh/leg pieces. Each time the dish got amazing reviews. And, this would be perfect for easy entertaining! Maximum flavor and presentation for minimal effort. Even my 2-1/2 yr old LOVED it, and she will very rarely touch meat of any kind. I will make this again and again and again! It's now one of our all-time favorites.

Whole family loved it last night and asked, "When can we have this again?" I did change a couple of things...I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken, and I have halved the amount of shallots, and added a pinch of an Italian Seasoning blend. I admit I was concerned about trying to feed a teenager and a husband who can be kind of finicky, but they loved it, and I was thrilled. The grapes just add an incredible burst of flavor that really makes this dish. If my picky group loved, I'd recommend this for just about anyone looking to make something different that your family will actually eat.

This is such a delicious and yet so simple recipe. It tastes amazing.

I made this with bone-in skin on chicken breasts because that's what they had on sale and white onions quartered because I couldn't find shallots. I put thyme sprigs under the skin as well as salt/pepper. The chicken was ok but the grapes/onion mixture was to die for. I really liked this and plan on cooking it many more times. Next time I'll add some red pepper flakes because it was missing some spice.

Stellar recipe--simple and deliciously moist! I've never written a review on epicurious but I had to after making this for the 2nd time.

The only changes I made were splitting the chicken along the backbone and flattening it out to cook (over the thyme sprigs) and removing all the stems from the grapes. This was stellar - definitely good for company, but easy enough for dinner on a Monday.

Best roast chicken recipe! I used a toaster oven. Stuffed the cavity with some of the grapes and shallots. The flavors were perfect. Next I may experiment using a small turkey in the big oven, adding the outside grapes only for the second half of cooking time. Excellent recipe!

I used thigh/leg portions...it was great and easy. Found it using my IPhone app for Epicurious while at the grocery store. Next time I'll try with breasts. I would serve this for a dinner party...would make a nice presentation on a platter...the grapes were just perfect.

We loved this dish; although I altered it slightly. Forgot to purchase the fresh thyme so stuffed the cavity with celery tops & stalks & fresh garlic. Also, added some additional red onion to the grapes & shallots. Next time I will try it with the thyme. Amazed how easy yet flavorful it was.

This recipe is so easy to make that I don't even feel like I can take credit for how well it turned out! The caramelized sugar from the grapes paired with the thyme, and shallots made for a great dinner. A really wonderful Fall recipe

Wow! This is the type of recipe that goes down into your repertoire -- I know I'm keeping it in mine! It's VERY easy and simple to prepare, with the most important aspect (besides quality ingredients) being proper cook time. A recommendation: Stuff the cavity with shallots/grapes/thyme. If you are using small to medium grapes, separate from shallots arranged around chicken and put them in for the last 45 mins. (For "globe" sized grapes, you should be able to roast with chicken for nearly the full amount of time). Be sure to serve alongside pan juices, as this makes an already succulent chicken heavenly!!

I've been raving about the roasted grapes since I made this a few days ago. The smallest chicken I found was about 4.5lbs., so it took a bit longer, but the grapes ended up perfectly caramelized, and still juicy. I definitely would use them in place of prunes which I've used many times in conjunction with roasted vegetables and bird.

Rating: 4
It's delicious. But I bought a 6.5 lb. chicken and it took 2.5 hours to cook. The grapes turned into jelly -- it was still good, but didn't look right. This time I'm letting it cook for 1.5 hours until I put the grapes in.

Fear not the grape! Grape is to chicken as cranberry to turkey, apples to pork. This was the moistest chicken I've ever roasted. Beautiful, simple blend of flavors. Devoured!

I was curious about cooking with grapes. I learned that I do not like it. The flavor was great. I also used chicken leg/thigh quarters. I dislike cooked "raw" tomatoes. The texture is very off-putting and the grapes ended up the same. I might try grape juice with the shallots. We liked that combination very much.

I was curious enough and tried this recipe using whole legs w/attached thighs. Also made with pork chops. It was so easy to prepare and delicious. I added a splash of white wine as I always do when braising or roasting poultry, turkey or pork. Alas, I could not interest my friends to try this unique dish. They couldn't get past cooking with grapes. Their loss for sure!

Very good, really interesting flavors and easy to prepare. I stuffed the cavity with the grapes, thyme and shallots and didn't use 6 large shallots, I used 4 instead and probably used about 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Will 100% make again.
