Didn't make the jam, but the burger part was amazing. We ate it with avocado, mustard, onion, and mayo. The burger part was really easy and very flavorful and tasty. Picky hubby said it was great.

No grill so I did this all on the range. Used the immersion blender briefly to render the "jam". Basically the "hot tomato" jam is a twist on homemade ketchup. Burgers are VERY peppery. I thought this was good but not exceptional. With all the great lamb burger recipes out there, I probably will not go out of my way to make this again.

Very good recipe. I just added the ginger, rice vinegar and pepper sauce to homemade tomato jam. Everything worked well to create an easy, week day meal.

This is truly an amazing way to eat ground lamb. Brings out the flavor of the lamb without masking it. I added a tablespoon of shallots to the lamb mixture and doubled the garlic. Instead of the tomato jam, we used pepper jam that we had on hand plus topped the burger with goat cheese. Delicious!

The Hot Tomato Jam is the star of this recipe. It takes at least an hour to reduce, not the 40 minutes in the recipe, but it is worth the effort. The lamb burgers are juicy but if you add too much merlot or sesame oil they lose their shape. I get rave reviews whenever I make this recipe, even from those who are scared of lamb.
