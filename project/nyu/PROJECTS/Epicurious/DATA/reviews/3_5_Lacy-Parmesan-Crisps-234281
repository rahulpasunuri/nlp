Happy hour anyone? These are great if you have people coming over for some Belgium beers. I would suggest adding some Herbs de Provence for a nice added flavor.

I cooked these for a bit longer than recommended. They were greasy at first but after they cooled I put them on some paper towels. They didn't seem too greasy to me. My guests gobbled them up!

Prepared as written, this recipe turned out way too greasy & too salty. I'll try the version that includes flour next time.

I made these at Easter time to serve with a simple asparagus vinagrette with chopped hard-cooked egg! How easy and how WONDERFUL - a perfect complement!

I find the Fricos recipe (p. 29 Gourmet Cookbook: Stir together 3 oz grated parm, 1T all-purpose flour, 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper and bake 10 minuts at 375) to be superior. Delicate, but not as greasy.

I would definitely make this recipe again to serve with a green salad, etc. Delicious and very easy and quick to make.
