2 tablespoons is way too much and ruined the crab cakes for me. Next time I will add 1 to 2 teaspoons...

They're good but everyone tells me when I make this recipie, mine are better so here goes. Jumbo Lump Crab Meat Hellman's Mayo and Nance's Sharp and Creamy Mustad, Progesso Italian Flavored Bread Cums, Cayenne Pepper Chopped Parsley,one egg, 1 Vaidalia Onion,1 Red Pepper. Saute in Olive Oil quickly, then put all crab cakes on a broil foil and broil for about 2 minutes.

These are the best crab cakes, and I agree that messing with basics like adding eggs or using store bought bread crumbs changes the crab cake. They are very hard to keep together, but chilling them helps. I can see using the home made bread crumbs (and you really do have to use a dense white bread like Arnold's sandwich bread) for the filling and then rolling them in Panko. I've made them a number of times, and the only thing I change is the fresh herbs. Instead of cilantro I like to use fresh dill and chives. My only real complaint with the recips is that at the end it says to serve with mayonnaise. NO WAY!! You've got to use a good quality (preferably homemade) sauce. One of the sauces I've made is a simple tartar sauce with lots of capers and fresh squeezed key lime. (Okay, just to brag, I picked it off my own tree.) Oh, and you also have to use the best jumbo lump crab, making sure to leave lots of good lumps and not squish it up too much.

I followed the recipe exactly, turned out wonderful for the people who like crab; was too "crabby" for those who don't eat a lot of seafood.

I made these a few times for small parties and they were fabulous. I plan to make them soon for a dinner club and am wondering: Has anyone made them start to finish before and then reheated? I'd like less chaos in the kitchen but don't want the taste to suffer. Thanks.

I've made this recipe countless times since it appeared in 1995. I follow it to a "T". I do not add any eggs. I think what sets these apart from typical crab cakes is how delicate they are BECAUSE they don't have any egg in them, and because of the fresh bread crumbs. Try them at least one time as written and you'll notice a big difference from other crab cakes you've eaten. I must like Old Bay becuase I use 2T every time and never thought it to be too much. Anyone I've served these to always says they are the best crabcakes they've ever eaten. Try making them smaller and refrigerating them for a while before cooking. Helps to hold them together.

For other cooking n00bs like me, who don't enjoy going to 4 different stores looking like an idiot in each, "fresh coriander leaves" is sold as "cilantro" in the US. Several other reviewers mentioned cilantro in their reviews, and normally I read a fair bit of the reviews before heading off shopping, so I should have put 2 and 2 together, but if I save 1 person the embarrassment and hassle I went through, it is well worth the post. :D

Delicious! Definately half the Old Bay Seasoning. I put the peppers, jalepeno & garlic in a food processor before sauteeing, skipped the cilantro and used Panko crumbs for dredging (used fresh crumbs in the crab mixture) instead of fresh.

Best crab cakes ever! Made 2 changes, cut the Old Bay as suggested and added one egg. They stayed together great with the egg addition. I browned them ahead of time and baked them just before serving. Perfect!

This was a delicious recipe. The only difficulty is that the "batter" ends up being very moist and doesn't hold together easily.

These had an absolutely phenomenal flavor. I thought they rivaled crab cakes I've had in Maryland. I did have problems keeping the cakes together--they fell apart very easily. However, they tasted so good, I couldn't complain! I followed other reviewers' advice and added the egg and reduced the Old Bay. I substituted regular store-bought bread crumbs for homemade to save some time.

Rating: 4
First off, the Old Bay is suppose to be 2 Teaspoons, not 2 Tablespoons. 2 Tablespoons ruined it the first time. I'm looking forward to making it again with much less Old Bay. Definitely add 1 egg. Also, use a small food processor to chop peppers and jalapeno together. Otherwise, they are amazing.

In response to the other reviews, I took some advice. I cooked the garlic for 20 seconds when the pappers were done. I also only used 2 tsp of old bay. They were awesome. I made 10 cakes instead of 8 and not one of them fell apart like others had said they would. The key is using well chilled items. I paired the crab cakes with the mango salsa and served with some coconut ginger rice. One of the better recipes I have used off this site.

I made these for a New Years Eve party at my house. They were the first to go. Not very traditional but delicious. I served them with chipotle mayonnaise. (I just processed chipotle chiles in adobo with mayo.) I am making them again for another party this weekend.

These crab cakes are absolutely delicious - zippy and flavorful. Definitely cut the Old Bay, and definitely add the egg. I served them with Chipotle mayonnaise (also on this site) and my mother-in-law is STILL talking about them.

I agree with the other reviewers -- you should reduce the Old Bay Seasoning. I cut it down to about 1 1/2 tb. but it was still too much salt. Otherwise, the crabcakes were good. I added one egg and added lemon juice. Pretty easy recipe to follow with good results.

I've made this recipe several times - following the suggestions on reducig the amount of Old Bay, and I agree that they are the best crabcakes I've ever had. Every time I've served them everyone present has asked for the recipe - I also serve them over mixed field greens with a roasted red pepper mayo- beautifu! Great with Veuve Cliquot or Sauvignon Blanc!

Fantastic. I combined some ingredients from 2 other crab cake recipes and my friends raved. Only used 1 red bell pepper - pulsed in the food processor, added one egg, only used 1/3 cup mayonnaise, added 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice, used panko instead of regular breadcrumbs, no jalepeno but red pepper flakes. Served with a mustard mayonnaise flavored with paprika and lemon juice.

Truly a great crab cake recipe. It is a bit time consuming, but well worth the results.

Excellent! 2 Tbs ea. coriander (cilantro)& parsley. Only 2 tsp. Old Bay. Added crushed garlic to peppers while they cooled down. No jalapeno. No additional salt. +1 egg a must. This may have been the key: I simply put 1C freshly made sourdough crumbs (done in blender) into mixture (ends up like panko). 1/3C patties, chilled for 1 hr. (a must). They now DO NOT NEED to be dipped into breadcrumbs. --Prefer a slightly lower pan temperature. They hold together well, easy to handle. What reviews!

After having made these several times, I decided to write a review after reading what the others had to say. These crab cakes are truly THE BEST I and others have ever had. However, with that said, some notes have to be made. The Old Bay amount is too high and should be added to taste, rather than all at once. (Start with 2 tsp. and then add more if you feel it needs it.) Handle these cakes with care. If you're in a rush, they will fall apart. But if you follow the instructions to the letter, you will have beautiful, tender, delicate and amazing crab cakes. Panko bread crumbs also work nice in this recipe if you want to try those as an alternative. If you're new in the kitchen or have never made crab cakes, just take your time and use a light touch. These are worth the effort. So very delicious. Really. I serve them with a roasted red pepper mayo made with chili powder and garlic. Do not listen to the negative reviews...just be patient. These crab cakes are truly AMAZING!!

I made these as appetizers for dinner for 14. The guest unanimously decided that, although a bit spicy, these were the BEST crab cakes they had EVER eaten. Next time I will cut the Old Bay by 1/2. Can't wait to make and eat these jems again!

After reading the great reviews I made this with the modification of cutting the Old Bay to 1 Tbl. It was still so salty we could hardly eat it. What a disappointment! I used fresh, sweet dungeness crab and it was ruined. What are you people thinking.

Wonderful recipe, I've made it several times and it's always a hit. To keep them from falling apart, add one beaten egg to the mixture and don't make them larger than the 1/4 cup size. I also use 1 and 1/2 of the bell peppers, and 3/4th of the jalapeno. I love garlic, but I think it works best here if you add it to the peppers the last few minutes they are cooking instead of using raw garlic in the mix. Serve with lemon and tarragon tartar sauce, also on Epicurious.

I'm always looking for a good recipe for crab cakes, and this one was delicious--especially loved the red bell pepper, but left out the jalapeno. Note: the amount of Old Bay (which is a seasoned salt) should be 2 teaspoons, not 2 tablespoons.

My guests LOVED the crab cakes. They were so-so to me. I wouldn't make it again just because I would like to try others. But I agree with previous posts - definitely make smaller cakes and refrigerate. I refrigerated mine overnight and I still had to work carefully but at least they didn't fall apart.

I really liked the recipe although I made a few substitutions (added hungarian hot pepper, ital. red pepper, yellow pepper, shallots, green onion as my veg.) and extra cayenne as spice along with the recipes spices. The crab cakes did fall apart on me. Of the 7 patties I made, only 2 came out inspite of much gentle handling. I think the key is to really flatten the patties. Make them not only 3/4 inch thick but flat on both top and bottom. My slightly rounded tops would cause the edges to collapse when I flipped the patty over. Also, tried serving with a something more complex than just mayo, even if it is as simple as 1/4 cup mayo + 1/2 tb paprika + 1 tsp ketchup. For some reason, a developed sauce always looks more appetizing than a quarter cup mayo.

I used one jalapeno like the recipe suggests. I made the full recipe for dinner for 4. The crab cakes were delicious EXCEPT for the EXTREME heat! We all like spicy food but this way ridiculous! Everone was emptying their water glasses faster than I could fill them! TOO HOT!!! Otherwise, delicious. Next time I will half the jalapeno!

Phenomenal! by far, the best crab cakes I have ever eaten, let alone prepared. Served as a first course on Arugula drizzled with lemon and lime infused oil and the Chili Mayo. Even one of my guests who "does not like" and "would never eat" crabmeat nearly inhaled one (I did prepare him a different first course). All the other 'crab savvy' guests couldn't stop talking about them (they usually talk about each other). I don't think I'll ever prepare crab cakes any other way again. Thanks to Esther and Jerry for the Old Bay and Cilantro tips!

These were really delicious, however, way too much Old Bay Seasoning is called for, I'd cut it at least in half (1 T.) or a third, as it is otherwise far too salty which is a waste of good crab meat. :) Happy Holidays!

Absolutely fantastic. Served on a bed of mixed baby greens with a chipolte mayonnaise. Not difficult to make at all, although I am very certain the dish was helped by the wonderful fresh Maine crab meat I purchased that day from a local store that flies in fish daily!

I have made this recipe several times and everyone loves them. I can't make enough of them. I add a little more cilantro because I love it and everyone raves over this dish. I am bringing them to an open air opera concert (La Traviata) for our guests to enjoy along with a nice Burgundy and or Pinot Noir. I usually serve with a horseradish sauce (mild) so it does not interfere with the wonderful flavors in the crab cake itself! Enjoy!

Delicious! Worth the cost of fresh lump crab meat. Just be careful not to over mix the crab or else you'll lose those nice big chunks of leg meat, although it won't affect the flavour. It makes an impressive first course for a dinner party. I added a few squirts of lemon juice and then served it with a bit of wasabi flavoured mayonnaise and a lemon wedge. Yum.

Fantastic - everyone loved these. I followed the recipe exactly & it worked very well. Its true that you must treat these somewhat gently as there's not much holding them together, but it really isn't difficult. The recipe says that it servers 4 as a main, but 3 of us polished these off and we could have had at least 1 more. I served this with a black bean/corn salad and sauteed swiss chard.

I was tempted to reduce the Old Bay because of a previous review, and because I'm not a big fan of Old Bay. But tasting the mixture convinced me to use the full amount. I also thought the jalapeno {preferably fresh} was essential, much better than the Tabasco that is specified in most recipes. I did substitute green pepper for yellow. I served this with a saffron/dijon vinaigrette instead of mayo, which proved to be a great choice.

My family really liked this recipe. I've never made crab cakes at home. I used frozen lump crab and served w/ Chipotle Mayo off this site. The sauce was a huge hit. I soaked the dried Chipotles 30 min in boiling water like it says. Put in food processor and had a hard time with the sieve getting the thick paste to come through and leave the seeds behind. In the future I'll soak then cut Chipotles open (using gloves) and remove stem and seeds before processing - then skip the sieve. I also used 1 cup of mayo instead of 1/2 and it was still plenty spicy. For the crabcakes I'll use half the red and yellow peppers. It seemed like too much. I'll also omit the jalapeno. The sauce had enough kick (and I like spicy foods). My nose ran with all that heat. I subbed Panko breadcrumbs instead of bread and liked the crunch. Definately let them set in fridge for a while before cooking. I'll make again with changes.

time consuming but worth it. I used more crab than the recipe called for. I also needed more mayo to keep the cakes together. I chilled them overnight. They are very delicate. I'll make this again next crab season.

This was the best crab cake recipe I have made. I used 2.5 pounds of fresh crab leg meat and used very little bread crumbs - not the bread as specified in the recipe. I put in a tablespoon of lemon juice and dredged the cakes in corn meal. The corn meal gives a crunchy exterior. My husband said it was the best meal I had ever made. Wow!!! Served it with mayo-chipotle sauce that I found on this web site. Great recipe!

I made this as an appetizer for Christmas Eve dinner. My guests loved them. I presented 1 cake on a plate decorated with a horseradish lime sauce and a chipotle sauce. Extremely delicate so be sure not to skip the chilling process. I would recommend to make the day before then fry and bake.
