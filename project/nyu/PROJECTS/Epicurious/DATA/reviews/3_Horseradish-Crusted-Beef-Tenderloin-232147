Followed recipe as written, but used prepared horseradish, however the flavor remained only on the crust and did not give the roast any flavor. Seemed like a lot of effort, could have just made a sauce for dipping instead.

It was great to have a recipe make use of so much of the horseradish grown in our garden and be delicious. However, I do not think we will make again. The horseradish crust did not impart much of the horseradish flavor or aroma into the meat. We will stick with a great horseradish sauce on the side of a great cut of beef.

Delicious and easy! Raves from my husband and guests. Have made a few times and has made it into my recipe box. Highly recommend (and I have only used prepared horseradish--never the fresh it calls for).

This was a very easy main dish to prepare. It wasn't a show stopper, but was a decent beef recipe.

Made this for Christmas dinner this year. Received fabulous reviews for very little work. The flavor was AMAZING!

Loved it, but newbie question: roast came strung in a kitchen-string net with 1cm squares. Taking the string off after cooking stripped off all the crust! But take it off before, and I'm sure, roast would fall apart during cooking. Solution? Remove netting before and re-tie with only a few pieces of kitchen string?

Excellent recipe. Can not wait to make again. FYI: 1 pound of horseradish grated was a lot more than 1 cup. Threw away a lot of extra horseradish.

Made the whole menu and would definitely make the tenderloin again. 25 minutes for 3 lbs. made a perfect medium rare, pink throughout. Horseradish crust, along with the beef browns, made a delicious flavour. Perfect served at room temperature and delicious next day cold if you are lucky enough to have leftovers.
