The dish looked way better than it tasted. Extremely bland, not much flavor to it. The concept is a good one, but there are some ingredients missing. I would modify this significantly before attempting again. Add sautéed onions and garlic and others have suggested. Season the salmon with a balsamic vinaigrette perhaps before baking. Could probably skip the tedious steps of creating sauce from scratch and just use Alfredo sauce instead, will likely have more flavor.

Bland! I hoped this would be simple in a.comfort food way but instead it had no depth of flavor and I had to heavily salt it to be bearable. I won't make it again.

Very yummy and easy to make.

It was OK. I only used 1 T flour and used 1 1/4 cups milk. Nothing spectacular.

I followed the last reviewers advice and deglazed an onion and garlic mixture with wine. Had Gavi on hand, but would probably use Chardonnay next time. In any case, it was still delicious! I also used goat cheese instead of the recommended cheese. It was even better cold for lunch the next day. This would make a nice picnic salad.

I heeded the advice of other reviewers and modified the recipe a bit: for the sauce, started by sauteing a small chopped onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic; added 3/4 cup white wine and deglazed for a couple minutes; added the flour and it thickened immediately; then added 3/4 c milk and thickened further. My grocery didn't have Neufchatel so I used Philly cooking creme, which seems like basically the same thing (I know, heresy, but still). Used plenty of salt and pepper. It was delicious. Lemon, dill and salmon flavors all came through against the background of oniony creaminess.

I used chicken instead of salmon, seasoning it with lemon, olive oil, fresh parsley, and S&P. I also added some dry white wine, which made it less bland and more complex. I will be making this again!

Hubby loved this, I thought it was meh. Under-seasoned or something, can't quite put my finger on it. Won't be making again.

Great base recipe you will need to add your flavor to it to really own the dish. I added lots of roasted garlic and more S&P.. It was a very quick and easy recipe to make. Next time im thinking of adding some extra cheese and veggies to the mix

BORING with little depth of flavor. Had to add mustard, horseradish and hot sauce to make it edible.

I usually make a recipe as written the first time before making changes. I just wasn't into the dill tonight and after reading some of the other reviews about the sauce being bland I was skeptical about the whole thing. So I gave it three stars because I did make changes. The sauce was bland (partially because of no dill, but it was pretty tasteless anyway)...I added about 3 oz of goat cheese and then added red pepper flakes and some mediterranean spices. Followed everything else as written, oh except multi grain pasta. We decided it was really really good with the changes and felt fairly healthy even with the addition of the goat cheese. YUM! Super fast and easy too. Great weeknight meal and really "fancy" enough to serve company as well.

I heeded the warnings and stayed away from the white sauce, choosing eggs as per a cabonara instead. I also added sauteed red onion, garlic, preserved lemon and a dash of wine. Everyone enjoyed it very much.

This was good. Just good, nothing special. My husband loved it.

This was quite good and easy, even though we completely spaced the lemon! We served it with quinoa instead of pasta and I think I will continue to do that. Except next time I'll put the peas in the sauce, leave the salmon whole and serve the peas over the salmon next to the quinoa - seems a little more fun and fancy!

Despite the addition of some white wine and extra lemon to the sauce, I thought it was very bland and kind of gluey, and that was the main flavor of the dish for me. I just tasted the leftovers thinking that I might revive them for lunch today, but instead, they're going in the trash. I don't think this recipe is worth another try.

Going strictly by the recipe would be pretty bland. We added sauteed asparagus and red onion and a bunch of garlic salt and red pepper to get more flavor. If/when we cook this again, we'll keep the sauce and salmon separate from the pasta and veggies and serve them in separate dishes. Also, trading some of the milk for some white wine couldn't hurt either.

A great recipe, indeed! I'm looking forward to cooking this one again soon! I added some balsamic vinegar after I cooked this meal, and some organic tomato sauce as well.

I thought this was just good, not great. Expected more based on other reviews and what lovely ingredients are in this dish, but found the flavors to be lacking. I will however try it again, next time though I'll add some hot sauce or dijon to the sauce before mixing with the salmon, pasta & peas...hopefully that will help bring out the flavors more.

Delicious - and super impressive for not taking a long time to prep... I added in asparagus cut into one inch sections (about a cup) and also fresh snap peas. I would hands down make this again and it is a great meal to make at the beginning of the week for leftovers!

Excellent dish! Light, delicious and versatile. We tried it with a few additions: sauteed red onion and mushroom, steamed snow peas, and roasted red pepper strips, and some cayenne. Perfect way to enjoy our local meat CSA's sustainable Alaskan salmon!

Easy to make but I agree that the sauce is a little bland. I would recommend making less sauce and adding extra dill and lemon zest. Frozen shrimp works as a cheap and yummy alternative to fresh salmon.

It was fancy tuna noodle casserole. Way too bland and too much bechamel. Next time I'll make way less sauce.

Yummy. This turned out much better than I thought it would. I think next time I will try it with fresh English pees.

Wow! I made this last night and am looking forward to making it again soon! A very easy dish to prepare and impressive tasting and looking. Perfect for company. I will add more dill next time as we could barely taste it but the creamy smooth texture, light lemon taste, fresh salmon and the perfectly cooked pasta are a fantastic combination. So indulgant you would never know it was not sinfully high in calories and fat. A VERY pleasant surprise.

This dish was great, and like they said, very easy. I substituted asparagus for the peas and added sauteed onion. Everyone loved it!
