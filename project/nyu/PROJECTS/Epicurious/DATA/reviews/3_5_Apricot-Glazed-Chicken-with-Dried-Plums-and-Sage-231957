I love this. Simple, clean, nice mix of savory and sweet. You have to love the flavor of chicken if you use breasts because there is no marinade. This is childhood comfort food to me and I can't get enough!

I came back to this recipe to send to my daughter and was quite surprised to see the last bad review. To each their own I guess. I've prepared this several times and have received rave reviews. I quarter the prunes, thinly slice the garlic, cut up the sage leaves a bit and add a little more cider vinegar. I like the idea one reviewer had of adding red pepper flakes. I'm going to try that next time using boneless skinless thighs. I serve it with Lundberg's wild/brown rice pilaf.

A very dull dish, the chicken had almost no flavor.

Delicious and couldn't be easier!

Perfect, easy, delicious meal for Rosh Hashannah. Doubled the recipe and had rave reviews. A definite keeper.

I was less than impressed by this one. The dried plums (aka prunes) completely overpowered the delicate flavor of the apricot. And 400 degrees seemed awfully high. IF I ever make this again, I will lower the heat and brush with the apricot glaze in the latter part of cooking. Heaven only knows what happened to the sage--the flavor was non existent.

ridiculously easy and tasty... i left it in longer than 40 minutes to get the color i wanted probably because i was preparing quite a bit of it (24 chicken thighs). i threw in a bit more prunes and garlic than called for.

Great recipe! It was a crowd pleaser and there's no doubt I will cook this dish again. I could not find fresh sage, so I omitted the sage, but otherwise followed the recipe. The browned chicken and honey-colored sauce makes for great presentation!

35 minutes is a short time for the garlic to really roast and be soft/edible - has anybody pre- roasted the garlic a little bit just to soften it? And does it need more preserves than called for in order to stay saucy when cooking? Good flavor, just wondering about these two things (I am testing on myself for use for a crowd)

I just put this dish in the oven again tonight. This is a great recipe that has gotten raves from my kids, the in-laws, the potluck, and the neighbor who just broke an arm. Simple, but interesting -- and fast.

To the cook for New York City, Yes you can eat the sage leaves. In Italy they fry them up till they're crisp and eat them just like that. They're very tasty.

Wonderfully easy and delicious recipe that got "three thumbs up" from my son. I followed the recipe exactly. Served on a bed of basmati rice and accompanied by baked acorn squash filled with apple, butter and brown sugar, and a bottle of crisp Ohio Gewurtztraminer, this was a marriage made in heaven for a cold fall evening.

This dish consistently received outstanding praise from our Passover guests. I added dried apricots and just used boneless breasts with the skin on. Great recipe.

Can I ask a naive cook's question? When you cook with fresh sage leaves, do you eat the leaves or pick them out once it's done??

Delicious and easy weeknight dinner. Be sure to use plenty of salt to bring out all the chicken flavors. If you don't have fresh sage you can subsitute with dried no problem.

Crazy easy and delicious. Excellent way to use abundance of sage from garden. Served with Wild Rice Stuffing with Pearl Onions and Apricots from this site. One modification was made: used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and thights cut up to nice size chunks. Other than that, no change required. Really easy and yummy. Will be come staple in my rotation.

I added stone ground mustard and it was wonderful.

Was so excited about this recipe and it really seemed bland. I used the fresh sage, the prunes, the garlic, the vinager and the pepper flakes, but the chicken seemed too sweet. Next time I'd crank up the seasonings.

My whole family loved this dish. It's very simple and there is lots of sauce. Tried it once with boneless/skinless breasts and it's much better with skin on pieces. The easy of making with the great taste makes it a 4 fork.

This is a great recipe. I like to add red pepper flakes, dried apricots, extra garlic and extra dried plums (prunes). I have made this recipe several times and have gotten tons of compliments each time.

My family loved this recipe. Even though it's not really a dish I'd make for company, its simplicity, ease, and very short prep time earns it 4 stars in my book. (The fresh sage is a must; you can easily up the vinegar a bit, and decrease the apricot preserves a bit, and have a wonderful result.)

A great week night recipe. Great flavor and beautiful presentation. Easy, easy.

Made this just like the recipe and it was extremely tasty. The sauce created during baking is yummy served on a side dish of mashed sweet potatoes. Hard to stop eating it!

Super easy, pretty quick cook-time and amazing results. Made it for my weekly, girls only dinner party last night and everyone raved about it! I added a drizzle of olive oil before cooking to add a little flavor --what's dinner without olive oil? (You can tell I'm Italian!) I also used sea salt instead of regular to add some more depth to the dish. Definitely a go-to recipe!

This came out wonderfully glazed and very juicy. I didn't have any prunes but it worked out just fine without them. A neighbor came to my door and commented on the lovely aroma wafting out my window. I will definitely make this again.

Super, sage (use fresh leaves) really makes the dish. Re "dried plums" aka prunes...I also have renamed dishes with prunes as having dried plums as the mere mention of prunes in a dish (and they add great flavor and depth) makes guests frown/wrinkle noses etc etc. Amazing how semantics can make or break a dish!

Ok, aren't dried plums supposed to be called prunes??? Is he just trying to be 'hip' for the younguns?!? Haven't tried the recipe but will...
