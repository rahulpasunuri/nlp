A question not a review: does anyone know the best substitute in the US for Maris Piper potatoes?

This is my way of cooking these boys, only I like matchstick frites which I fry in my own rendered pork fat from local, free-range Berkshire hogs. Pork fat rules, so if you want tasty, forget the oil and go for the gusto!

Being lazy doesn't make it a bad recipe. And cooking them thrice doesn't increase the calorie count. These fries came out crisp and not greasy on the outside and creamy and soft inside. Perfect.

Why are you people giving this recipe one fork when you have never even attempted to cook it or taste it? Just ridiculous. Cook it, eat it, and then review it. Its only fair to the author.

Sorry, but way too much work to make these fries. I usually cut and soak mine in cold water for 30 minutes, drain, fry them quickly for 2 minutes to blanche them. When needed they can then be deep fried for 2-4 minutes.
