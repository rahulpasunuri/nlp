Top 5 favorite cookie! I make the recipe with two changes: instead of hearts, I make bars; instead of confectioner's sugar after cooling, demarara sugar sprinkled on top before baking. The bars dissolve in your mouth with a spicy, sweet, and buttery richness.

Fabulous! I've been making these for years to rave reviews. They're perfect as is!

The best ever cookies! If you love butter and ginger!!!

Exceptional flavour. Did recipe exactly as described except that I rolled out dough and did the cookie cutting first, then refrigerated on cookie sheets for one hour before baking. I used very small cookie cutters so that I would have lots of small cookes rather than large ones. They turned out great and did not expand at all while cooking. Doubled the recipe and they kept very nicely for two weeks in the fridge.

Buttery goodness! I have been dreaming of these cookies since my roomie made them two years ago. So simple and so good.

Irresistible cookies. I put half again as much ginger and hand stirred it into the dough I had blended in the food processor. Left out the salt, there's plenty in the butter.

This is my favorite cookie that I have been making for about 6 years now for Christmas. I do stars typically instead of hearts. In response to the comment about the food processor. It is really no surprise that it ended up like it did. Candied ginger is sticky and sugary and should be chopped by hand.... however if you do want to pulse it in the f.p. add extra granulated sugar. This will coat the sticky sides of the ginger as you are chopping it. It helps. I have done it that way before. but really... why dirty up the f.p. when it takes minutes to cut it by hand? These are killer cookies with the absolute perfect texture.

Mmm. Candied ginger. Made these for Christmas as an option to all the peppermint and chocolate that usually shows up on Christmas plates. Took the advice of previous reviewers & made sure to use a sharp chef's knife for the candied ginger. Everything else came together so quickly and easily, the little bit of effort with the ginger was worth it. I rolled and sliced with great results. I'm sure there will be an encore next year.

I've never written a review here before but I had to come to the defense of these cookies. I don't think it's fair to criticize the recipe for your own interpretation of it. The recipe calls for chopped candied ginger. It does NOT instruct you to put the ginger in a food processor. A chef's knife does the job just fine and the chunks are sweet and chewy and very yummy in the finished cookie. I added some chocolate ganache drizzled over the tops instead of conf. sugar. That was very good too.

Fabulous!! I am big fan of ginger - so this recipe was just right!! Bought crystallized ginger at Trader Joes and had no problem chopping into small pieces w/ sharp chef's knife. Just had to wash knife a couple times to keep it from getting too sticky. Made these for a fall bake sale, so I used a maple leaf shaped cutter - so cute! Rolling of dough was very easy - even though I had never done it before. Will make again for sure!!

These were a stand-out favorite among co-workers. The candied ginger is essential and I can't imagine making that from scratch - buy it from the store either packaged or from the bulk bins. I didn't have any problems rolling it out and they looked adorable in the cookie cutter shapes, especially with the dusting of confectioner's sugar!

The finely chopped crystallized ginger was a disaster. I tried my food processor and ended up with a nasty glob, froze it and tried to grate it, which didn't work either, went out shopping for pre-grated ginger (btn $8-10 for how much I needed) and finally ended up candying it myself. Sooo much time, money, and effort for an ok cookie.

I LOVE ginger but I found these disappointing. The taste? Not so interesting. They were oily rather than buttery and not much different from rolling out leftover pie dough and sprinkling it with cinnamon and sugar. They took less time than the recipe indicated so the first cookie sheet was over-baked. On a more positive note, the technique of rolling the dough out between wax paper was easy with very little clean up. I cut out the hearts free hand with a sharp knife and the cookies were visually very cute and unique.

very good, these cookies are great the next day because the candied ginger becomes crunchy and adds a nice surprise to every bite. I will definitely make these again

Yummy, loved the candied ginger. These were very good cookies, definitely a keeper. I was in a hurry so I baked them in a pan instead of using cookie cutters. Used scissors to cut the ginger and it worked well.

Since I was in a hurry, I rolled the dough into a cylinder, wrapped it in waxed paper, and chilled it. The dough sliced perfectly into 1/4" rounds and baked to perfection in 25 minutes. Rich, spicy, adult, and very very good.

B+ for taste, D for ease of recipe! These are very tender and yummy - but if I were to make them again I would roll and slice them. Unless you have a food processor to get the candied ginger VERY fine, I would not recommend this recipe for cut-out cookies. I had to roll and re-roll over and over since my shapes kept getting destroyed by the chunks of rogue ginger. The dough was very pliable and easy to work with, it was just the ginger causing issue and I was using brand new metal cookies cutters. Although the cookies are very yummy, it just was not worth the effort!

I made these for a friend's 58th birthday party and used a 5 and 8 cookie cutter. Isn't that creative? I then sprinkled each with chocolate flakes and placed a "58" atop individual chocolate souffles served in 1 cup ramekins. Delicious....

Oh my God! These cookies are the bombay door! The combination of brown sugar and crystallized ginger (from Whole Foods Market) is to die for. This is definitely a keeper.

I made these cookies with modifications for Valentine's Day. I eliminated the ginger completely and substituted cinnamin for the powdered ginger and semi-sweet chocolate chips for the candied ginger. They held their heart shape beautifully and were quite delicious, though next time I might bake them for a minute or two less.

Last Valentine's Day I made these for someone I was secretly admiring. I packaged them in a special box and left them in his mailbox. Valentines Day is right around the corner now, and we are still together! These cookies won his heart, and I know they will win your's too! I had no trouble making them, and they taste delicious! They look pretty and dainty, and the ginger has just the right subtleness.

These are delicious and easy, even for a relatively inexperienced baker like me. I had large chunks of candied ginger from Trader Joe's, which I attempted to chop finer in the food processor. It quickly turned into a ball of ginger goo, which I had to separate with my fingers. Note to self: Buy the finely chopped stuff next time. Other than that, they turned out great. I didn't have brown sugar, so I used white, and I also tripled the amount of ground ginger. I think I must not have rolled the dough as thin as recommended, because I used a fairly small cutter and got fewer than 40 cookies. That said, they were absolutely buttery and spicy and delicious. I will definitely make them again. I like that you don't have to chill the dough very long, so you can go from start to finish pretty quickly.

I love this recipe. Whenever I make it i always get requests for the recipe. A tip for chopping ginger: give your chef's knife a slight blast of oil spray before you begin.

I really liked this recipe. I used baker's cut crystallized ginger by The Ginger People (you can get it at Williams-Sonoma for $5.00), and I didn't feel the need to chop it any finer. They turned out perfect. If you feel like you need to chop it very fine, why not use a food processor? After the first batch, I changed the temperature to 275 and baked them for 25 minutes, and they were perfect.

Wonderful. If you refrigerate the candied ginger, it makes it easier to chop. I bought Trader Joe's Crystallized Ginger Baker's Cut and just chopped it a little more.

MUCH more stable during baking than other shortbread recipies-didn't run like mad. Used this for our Burns night and also used this base (without ginger) and added finely minced fresh rosemary. The rosemary shortbread on file at this site didn't hold its shape for me but this one is way more foolproof. Will make again.

The finished cookies are delicious!! The crumbly shortbread is a nice contrast to the very chewy ginger. Finely chopping ginger, however, is a nightmare. I did it in stages (slices, then jullienne, then small pieces) and rolled the ginger in granulated sugar between each step. It worked out really well, but it takes a while.

Spectacular cookies. Charming for Valentine's Day, with the perfect blend of spice and sweetness. A favorite which I will add to my repertoire!

I thought this was pretty tasty. I didn't bother sprinkling it with the powdered sugar. And I have to say, it's difficult to get the candied ginger chopped finely enough.
