Excellent - very simple to make and tasty all on their own. I haven't even tried pairing them with other foods yet!

I make these all the time. They go well with everything. If you like pickles, they're even great all by themselves!! Wouldn't change a thing in the recipe.

I made this to go with marinated, grilled snapper. It worked very nicely with avocado, lime, sour cream, & diced tomatoes in corn tortillas. I added some minced cilantro and a couple of dried arbol chiles to the pickling liquid and it came out great. The onions add a flavor not typically found in Tex-Mex or New Mexico-style Latin food.
