This is quick and very, very tasty! It's true that the leftovers are even better.

I would definitely make this again, but next time I would use less oil and make sure to drain the antipasto better, because the end result - while tasty - was way too oily.

This was the first dish that I made completely from scratch. It still brings back memories for my husband and I because it really sparked my love for cooking. The only change I make is elimiating the jarred antipasto and use a half cup of sliced red peppers and a half cup of halved Kalamata olives. Other than that, it's perfect and even better the next day.

Fantastic recipe. Used spicy salami which gave some great heat to the dish. An easy dish and huge crowd mid-week dinner pleaser. Next time, would toss in some green olives for a bit of saltiness.

Found it too sour and runny. Wouldn't bother making again. The only good thing was that the leftovers were better than the first night I made it.

Thanks to the cook from Annapolis, MD, for gill removal advice... I just made this again but used baby bellas because the market was out of big ones. No gills in the babies, but I will use those suggestions in the future. My own tip: Use the whole pound of pasta you bought, the whole jar of veggies, the half pound of salami, whatever amount of mushrooms was in the package, etc. You know? So many recipes result in a little of this and a little of that left over. I'm from the "use it all" school of cooking, and it generally works out pretty well. Baking is another story...

This dish was wonderful. Fleas6 from Ct...the easiest way to remove the gills is to scrape them away with a small spoon (a grapefruit spoon is great for this). This is an optional step, but the mushrooms look more apealing if the gills are removed. If I am stuffing them I do not remove the gills, but if I am slicing for a salad/sandwich/etc, I remove the gills. I hope this helps and you will try the recipe again!

This was very good, but I'm confused. The recipe says to trim the dark gills from the mushrooms. But they're all dark, right? Are some darker than others? How does one accomplish this trimming? I sort of muddled through that part, cutting and scraping and making a mess. Next time I'll leave the gills, unless someone can explain how and why I should bother with them.

Great, quick recipe. I served this for my Italian -in-laws - who like good food - but shy away from mor adventurous gourmet food. This was a great side dish to marinated, grilled pork chops - it was a bit different than the usual pasta salads, etc

Very good. I served it one night at a dinner party and even though I had made a huge batch, there were no leftovers!
