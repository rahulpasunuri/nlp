Good, but a bit runny. Mildly spicy, at best - so kids liked it. I guess I could be naughty next time and use coconut cream to thicken it a bit, but likely will feel too guilty to do that.

A good recipe if you have people in the house who don't like it too spicy. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and added some fresh ginger and curry paste, and also a chopped onion with the garlic. Used green beans instead of okra. Nice over rice.

I used left over chicken and it was great. Had everything else on hand.

Let me start off by saying that this is a wonderful recipe. Well worth trying. However. For fans of a robust, spicy chicken curry, please exit stage right. This is a mild, creamy chicken curry that has the added sweetness and flavor of tomatoes. Like many others I will admit that I did not follow it to the letter, as I did not have cashews or okra. I added potato cubes, doubled the cayenne and used about a tablespoon of primo curry powder. The result was creamy and light. Wonderful in its own right.

I love curry and I love coconut milk, but this recipe makes a bland curry or, optimistically, a mild curry even after I about doubled the curry called for. It is quick and easy but there are better recipes out there, in my opinion. This one is missing something or somethings.

I made a few adjustments and this turned out to be our absolute favorite dish! We've since served it to several guests, all of which have had seconds or thirds! SUBSTITUTE: Rotel for stewed tomatoes / Coconut creme for coconut milk / Omit the currants / Chopped okra for whole. The result is a dish as sweet as it is spicy and is oh-so-amazing!

this recipe only gets 4 forks once you've doctored it. I followed to directions the first time I made it - as I've got somebody in my house who doesn't like things too spicy. It was so bland even she didn't like it - so I added an onion, a tablespoon of minced fresh ginger, and 2 heaping tablespoons of madras curry paste - I also substituted chopped apricots for the currants- was perfect!

really quick, easy and simple. couldn't have asked for anything better. I will double the curry powder next time and you really don't notice the currants or cashews, so i'm gonna leave them out and go for less fat and calories. i also used green beans instead of the okra. Can't wait to make it again.

I made this last night and it is super delicious. I did follow the suggestion to double the curry and added a little ginger, extra salt and sugar. I didn't have okra or cashews. I used frozen green beans and sprinkled slivered almonds on top. I had 2 thighs and a breast so I also chopped up my chicken to make it easier for the kids. The 1/4 tsp of cayanne made it too hot for the kids but hubby & I LOVED it and will make this again. You could leave out the currents they were not detectable at all.

This is delicious and exciting! I doubled the recipe so that the 4 of us could have leftovers. My grocery did not have skinless, boneless thighs, so deboning was time-consuming and messy, but well worth it. I agree with the reviewers who kicked it up a notch...after tasting the final sauce, I added more curry and more cayenne. Could not find Okra, so I used peas, but the sauce was a bit thin. I added a leftover bag of frozen pearl onions, which were really nice. I will search for Okra and definitely make this again!

Just made this yesterday. It was delicious but I have to admit, I added an onion! How could an indian curry not have onion!? Maybe a typo? Before I cooked the garlic with spices I added a whole onion until softened. I also recommend upping the cayenne, it is a touch mild. My East Indian husband loved it. served with naan (of course) :)

Rating: 4
YUMMY and easy! pretty happy with it, but I will double the spices next time based on everyone's suggestions. Sounds like a good idea. I might double the tomatoes and okra too. I'm not a fan of coconut milk so I kept it out and it was very good. The okra and tomatoes were like a bindi dish that I love that's served at a local restaurant.

I was surprised at how tasty this recipe was. I made a couple of additions, though, to enhance the flavor: grated ginger, 1-2 Tbsp sugar, and about 1 Tbsp more salt than called for, in addition to doubling the curry powder and cayenne. I also substituted spinach for okra, but that was just a personal preference. All in all, a delicious and SIMPLE recipe I'll definitely make again.

My boyfriend who is a meat and potatoes guy LOOOOVED this dish. Super simple, pretty inexpensive to make. I did double the curry and cayenne pepper. I used light coconut milk, and didn't need the currents or okra. I added chopped red pepper instead. I also added a couple tsp of crushed red pepper flakes the second time for some extra heat and served it over jasmine rice. Delish! Oh, and as a side, I was trying to find a good easy recipe for naan. Instead I cheated and used pita bread and pan "fried" them in a skillet with a tiny bit of olive oil. We mopped up the extra sauce with the bread.

I had never made chicken curry before, or anything Indian, but this was amazing and very simple. Coworkers were going to steal it because it smelled so good! Double the curry. I would say the cayenne is up to you-- I doubled it and liked it, but it came out extremely spicy. I may try the original amount next time to compare. Didn't use okra or currents and didn't need them. I may double the tomatoes next time. You MUST cook the chicken for a total of 30-40 minutes! 25 on medium, another 15 on low. Don't forget to flip the chicken at least once, and spoon the sauce over top.

I was in the mood for chicken, curry and basmati rice. I typed those in and this was one of the first recipes I found. I thought it was amazing. I did some modifications that are listed as followed. 1. Sub Olive Oil for Vegetable Oil. 2. as many others have recommended, double the curry. 3. double the cayenne 4. eliminate the currants. 5. cut the baby okra into thirds before adding to the mix. The slime of the okra handily acts as a thickening agent to give the sauce a very nice texture. I would certainly suggest this meal to anyone looking for something quick and easy to have for dinner.

Very easy and very tasty. Replaced okra with fresh green beans. Added more curry and cayanne. Second time I added red bell peppers and 1/3 cup sweetened coconut. This curry is one of our favorites.

This chicken curry was delicious. It was my first time making Indian food and the recipe was easy, tasty and relatively quick. This will certainly become a regular dish on my menu!

Made this a few times. Needs some tlc but the end result is delicious. Almost double the curry, cayenne, add 1 small can of tomato paste and a drop of lime juice. I also use fire roasted tomatoes instead of stewed. My family loves it.

I did like the flavour, but I wasn't "wowed" by this dish and neither was my family. However, it did have a nice taste and it was very easy to make. I would probably make this again but with chicken breasts.

Would make it again, but only because it's so easy. Tasty for how quick it was to put together, but while the sauce was yummy, the chicken itself remained bland and not infused with any of the flavor. Took suggestion of increasing amount of curry powder.

i doubled the recipe and followed to the letter except for cook time. this dish initially yelds so much liquid and is set for simmering to the perfect reduced consistancy. I simmered uncovered for 35 to 40 minutes then added okra and simmered loosely covered for another 10 to 15 min. minutes. the chicken melted in your mouth. great dish!!

Very easy to make espeacily considering this is my first ever curry dish. My husband loved, loved, loved it. Plus it is basicly a complete meal with rice as it has veggies and meat.

This is a quick and tasty weeknight meal and as such deserves four forks! Followed the recipe exactly (only 1/8 tsp of cayenne because of the kids) and obtained a flavorful dish that did not require tons of ingredients and long cooking time. The currants are a must. Will make this a regular.

Delicious! Followed the others' suggestions of using more cayenne (a little more than double) and seasoned tomatoes, and found it just perfect. Okra's unique texture really soaks up the flavor. Did not have currants or cashews, will add next time. Roommates cleaned their plates.

This was delicious and easy. The currents added a nice contrast to the spice. I substituted green beans for okra (not a big okra fan). As for the curry, a good curry powder is critical. This made great leftovers as well.

The recipe as it is was a little boring to me. I added some fresh ginger, 2 tsp fish sauce, 3 small white potatoes, baby carrots, dried red pepper, 1 tbls minced shallots, and I used fire roasted tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes. Adding a little more curry also helped. Jasmine rice and the okra enhances this dish - dont make it without it.

I had no okra on hand so I substituted a 20-oz bag of frozen cubed butternut squash. As I also was using a whole cut-up chicken, I doubled the tomatoes (I used fire-roasted) and garlic (but didn't double the coconut milk). The cashews I happened to have in the house were Trader Joe's Thai chili-lime, and they worked beautifully. The result was so fragrant it lured my 16-year-old out of his room to try it, and my husband who claims to hate curry readily admits it was incredibly delicious. It made such abundant gravy that there will be plenty left to flavor other stuff after the chicken is gone. A keeper!

Very tasty. I used 3 tsp curry powder and added lime juice. The okra was really good and tender.

Really yummy quick curry. I agree with other cooks that upping the curry powder would be nice - we didn't find it spicy. My two year old ate it without a problem. I also substituted the okra for other veggies - peas and broccoli.

This was really tasty. A great "pantry" recipe. I usually have most of these ingredients on hand. Omited the dried currants. It would be easy to double the recipe by just increasing the chicken, tomatoes & okra. The OKRA was excellent in this dish, I would not skip it, it takes on a unique flavor that I think makes this dish pop! I used the green curry paste, increased to 3 tsp. It did not make the dish green!

OMG=quick and delicious. took suggestions of uppsing the curry to 2 heaping tsp, added fresh chopped ginger turkish bay leaf. Added lime juice. Used lite coco milk -- delish-swapped okra for green beans and peas. Served over jasmine rice.

Sounds like a great recipe! As for the question about curries. Red curry paste is made from hot red dry chilis, like arbol and serranos, ground with spices and shrimp paste. It is very hot!! Check out the recipe by typing in red curry paste. Yellow curry is made from much milder seasonings, like turmeric, cumin, ginger, a little heat from red or green chilis, and can be made dry, like a seasoning mix, or fresh, much better!! If all you have in your kitchen is a mix, spice it up by chopping up a fresh chili, adding a shallot, and remember the salt!! Salt carries the flavor profile of your food onto your tongue. With a lot of curries, the best thing is to add a little salt or lime/lemon juice to bring out the flavor!!

We enjoyed this recipe. I made a few changes: cut up the thighs and mixed them with the spices and garlic, let sit for awhile, then browned the pieces. Couldn't find baby okra, used regular okra whole. Next time will use cut okra to complement the cut up thighs. Will add more spices next time since we like it spicy. Easy dish, flavorful.

I made a substitution that may have ruined this dish. All I had on hand was an old, cheap container of Tone's Curry Powder so I subbed an equivalent amount of red curry paste. The dish turned out very spicy and I couldn't really taste anything else in the dish. Does anyone know what kind of conversion you could make when subbing curry paste for powder and red v. yellow?
