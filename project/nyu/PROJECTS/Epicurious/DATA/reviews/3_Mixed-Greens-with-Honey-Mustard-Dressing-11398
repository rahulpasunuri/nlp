A great lite dressing recipe. I used nf greek yogurt and a tiny bit more honey and dijon. We topped our grilled chicken sandwiches on whole wheat with it and it was delicious! Thanks!

This is very good! Don't know what the other reviewers are looking for. I did add one more teaspoon of mustard as others suggested (1 tsp whole grain, 2 tsp dijon), and then added one more teaspoon of honey as the lemon juice was a little overpowering. Thought it was great with only minor tweaking to my personal taste: will make often!

I added another teaspoon of mustard, but it was so yummy that I was afraid to tweek on it further.

I Substituted sour cream for yogurt, doubled the mustard and added a crushed clove of garlic... Then it was creamy and delicious!

This recipe required too much tweeking (sp?) to rate the actual measurements as any good. I had to add tons more mustard and then it tasted about as good as Kraft Honey Dijon dressing.

This dressing was great! Creamy but not too rich with great flavor. Don't know what the other reviewers were talking about, I only added a bit more mustard that called for and found it perfect. Use mustard with whole mustard seeds.

I took out the yogurt and just used mayo. I like mine a little more spicy so add more Dijon Mustard.

After reading the other two comments I adjusted the recipe and added 2 large cloves of garlic(crushed) and 1/2 tablespoon of mayonnaise. The result was wonderful. I would use this dressing again.

It tasted a little too flat and bland. Also, too much yogurt. Wouldn't recommend.
