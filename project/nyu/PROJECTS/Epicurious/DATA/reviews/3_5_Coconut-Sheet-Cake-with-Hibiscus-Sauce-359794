This cake was really good. However I used organic coconut extract and the flavor didn't come through at all. So my cake ended up being a bit bland. But with the whipped cream topping and hibiscus sauce it didn't even matter. I'm so glad I made the sauce! It was delicious. Next time I make this I would either just use vanilla extract or imitation coconut since the extract I had didn't work out.

I'm a traditionalist with coconut cake. Every Christmas I make the old school southern favorite with a seven minute icing. Its delicious and it takes for ever to put it together. So I was intrigued by the receipt's buttermilk and soda, which makes for a lighter cake, and egg whites only, again a lighter cake. Its a rare joy at this point in my life to get to cook something that seems really interesting and tasty only to cook it and find that the flavor and texture was something even more interesting than I had imagined and tasted absolutely delicious. I went out on a limb and baked this for a very large birthday party i was catering. It was the phenomenal success of the evening. I've never had so many women and men ask for a receipt in my whole cooking career. This is definitely a keeper. Like others I added vanilla extract to the cake, and omitted the hibiscus sauce. I'm sure it is delicious, but I just really didn't have the wherewithal to drive 30 minutes to the farmer's market just for the flowers. Something tells me that with a little work Grenadine could be a base for a substitute.

Great snack cake. Loved the change of flavour to coconut from other flavour bases. I didn't make the hibiscus sauce - ingredients not readily available and I was making it as a last minute craving!

The cake was so good, and the tartness of the hibiscus sauce was a nice addition (not to mention the brilliant red color). The only downside was that after having fully assembled the cake at home, we had to transport it in the car on a super-hot July day, and within 10 minutes, the whipped cream topping deflated. Not sure if this was because of the heat, or if it's just better to wait until the last minute to put the topping on the cake. It still tasted delicious, and I'm looking forward to trying it again.... this time excluding a hot car ride!

This cake was easy and totally delicious. I added one tsp. vanilla to the batter, but otherwise followed the recipe. I was going to skip the sauce, but I'm glad I didn't. It took the cake to another level.

This was very good - but, I couldn't find hibiscus anywhere, so we didn't have the sauce. I think that would have made this cake great.

I'll start by admitting that I didn't want to search all over town for hibiscus flowers so I opted out of the hibiscus sauce entirely. The rest of the recipe however, was fantastic. The cake was fluffy and light, and the simple whipped cream topping made it the PERFECT summer dessert. Perfect ending for a casual summer meal.

This cake was huge hit at a recent luau- themed party. People commented on the moist cake and came back to spoon more sauce on their plates.
