This recipe reminds me of similar dishes in the northeastern European region. It makes for delicious comfort food and brings out all the memorable flavor notes on the palate and in our consciousness. Those fatty flavors from the butter and bacon mix well with the sweet but savory tastes of the caramelized onion, cabbage, garlic and herbs. It seems very simple, but its quite sophisticated and pleasing. I used my instincts from other similar dishes and it seemed to come together brilliantly. Even with my frozen, store bought pierogi, it was successful. Indeed, I even substituted cabbage with a hearty lettuce (like iceberg or romaine). Certainly, the dish would have been more excellent if I had the best ingredients, but I was by no means disappointed using what I had on hand. Of course, many Americans know that a good, homemade pierogi is a real delight; yet, pre-made, frozen foods can help make this a great, quick family meal too. This was in fact a very rich meal. I improvised, using my professional skills and adapted it to dinner for two at home. But, it could do very well in a restaurant as a first course. Instead of 14 pieces of small pierogi, I would have served maybe 5 to 7 pieces as a small starter. It would have sufficed and also set the stage for a second course, such as kielbasa (sausage), a breaded pork chop, roasted duck with apples or something of that sort. All the same, I enjoyed the big plate of pierogi with a good beer, finishing them all with nothing left on the plate.

This is what I found to use up a big cabbage but was sick of all my usual types of food. Yes, it's not for the purist, but was a great quick dinner, and kudos to the reviewer who suggested covering the pan during the first half of saute - great tip! Gotta add the caraway, and paprika and carrots were nice touches too. I served with sour cream, and was bummed to forget apple sauce.

A peasant dish it is. Not to everone's liking. But anyone brought up on this will agree--that in today's busy schedule--this is a winner. Not many of us have the time to do it from scratch. As much as we'd like to. I challenge all of you that have the time to do this from scratch--tell me your's is really all that much better!

Nothing terribly complicated, actually a bit of a peasant dish, even with the balsamic vinegar. Not too heavy, filling, and with a bit of a tang. Makes me glad I bought those bulk bags of pierogies from Gordon Food services.

We really liked this. The only thing I did different was to add a chopped hot pepper, seeds and all, when I added the onion. That gave it the jolt I thought it might be lacking. And I omitted the parsley. I don't think it has any flavor, so I either omit it or replace it with chives or cilantro, depending on the recipe. I would make this again for sure.

In reading previous reviews I kicked this up a notch. I made home made perogies from Martha Stewart which were wonderful. After cooking the bacon I removed it and browned fresh kiebalso in the bacon fat and removed that. I didn't want to waste the brown bits on the bottom of the pan so I deglazed it w/ balsamic vinegar and then added the onion and followed the recipe from this point on. When I added the cabbage I also put the kiebalsa back in. It was so yummy!!!!!!I will definetly make this again.

This dish was wonderful! It exceeded my expectations, and I will make it again. It is easy and quick. I did add caraway seeds, carrots, paprika, and garlic based on the other comments.

I am European and make this dish quite often. I found the cabbage very bland and so I added my usual paprika, garlic, more onion and some ground kolbasa. This is quite delicious. Also some seasoning such as salt and pepper is needed. I also like my pierogi crispy so I did not bother with the water, however, this is a matter of taste and I quite agree that the recipe method saves time. I hope you use my suggestions, they make the cabbage richer and delicous!

I am of Polish American descent & I was THRILLED to find this recipe! All of the taste of Grandma's cooking & none of the work or time! Maybe someday when it's raining & I have nothing but time on my hands, I'll go for the "from scratch" recipe. Ya! Right! The carrot & caraway seed are great additions. Smelled just like Grandma's kitchen. If Grandma had a choice, she'd choose this recipe!

This was fast, simple and yummy. Half a head of cabbage was a bit excessive - maybe my cabbage was too large!? The balsamic vinegar added a nice touch. By the way, I'm kind of appalled at the earlier reviewers who missed the point of this recipe and gave it a one-fork rating without having tried it.

May I say that I am quite embarassed for my fellow Poles who cannot see the point of this recipe... it's quick, easy, and quite tasty. Save the "from scratch" recipe for a rainy day!

What's all these snide remarks about not having instructions on making the pierogies. That's the whole point people. It's quick and easy - and quite delicious I may say. Read the other parts of Gourmet if you have all the time in the world to fuss over a meal. This section is for people who like to eat great food, but also like to get out of the kitchen!!

Enough of the snide remarks, folks. This recipe originally appeared in the January 2000 issue of Gourmet under the "Gourmet Every Day" section - i.e., fast and easy recipes. Any idiot can see that these are not meant to be homemade pierogi; this recipe doesn't pretend to be authentic in the style of your Polish grandmother or whatever. It does, however, make a quick, tasty and filling meal. I omitted the bacon and added julienned carrots, sliced mushrooms and a sprinkle of caraway seeds. It turned out well.

I am Polish-American and I was looking for a recipe of smaller proportions from my own (which begins with: use a 5 lb bag of flour....) This recipe was virtually useless. How about finding a real Pierogi recipe? Anyone can go out and buy a box of Mrs. T's.

I thought a recipe was supposed to be a method of making a food--Not buying it. I am of Polish descent, and can make Pierogi--Just wanted to see if you could--I see you can't. Do you want my recipe, or the name of my supermarket?

I too was hoping for a new recipe to make cabbage filled pierogi. The side stuff was delicious anyway. When pan frying pierogi, I get the best results when I cook the first side in butter or vegetable oil over medium-low to medium heat for about five minutes COVERED, finishing the second side uncovered. They puff up tall while covered, and seem to turn out less chewy than cooking them entirely uncovered.

I thought that a recipe for pirogi would include instructions for how to make...pirogi.
