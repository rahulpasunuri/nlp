I made this dish last nite. Well, a variation of it. I used a whole chicken cut up into individual pieces. I marinated per the recipe, adding a bit of smoked paprika to the mix. I then roasted at 400F until done, about 30 minutes. Major Yum! That Watercress mayo is TDF.

A delicious spingtime dish. The lemon/oil marinade makes the chicken breast melt in your mouth and the accompanying sauce creates a sophisticated main dish that was perfect for an outdoor evening concert in central park. I served it with chilled dressed asparagus and a couscous salad. Perfection.

Good quick dinner, the real star is the mayo which really is good on sandwiches or to dip shrimp in. I also substituted cilantro and lime in the mayo and it was great.
