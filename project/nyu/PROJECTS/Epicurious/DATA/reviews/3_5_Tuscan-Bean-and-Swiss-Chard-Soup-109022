A bit bland as is so I added lacinato Kale instead of chard and slightly spicy Italian chicken sausage and some red pepper flakes. I pureed some of soup before adding the sausage and Kale.

This was requested by my Italian friend for New Year's Day. I am really impressed by all the flavor coming out of a pale batch of soup. Even though I liked it just as written, I decided near the end to add half a bottle of Madeira, some fresh sage leaves, before tossing in the chard. I plan to process some of it in the blender and add back to make it really rich and creamy.

I made a few modifications due to personal preference and ingredients on hand (4 slices of bacon instead of pancetta, leek instead of fennel, chopped the chard stems and sauteed with onions and leek in a little of the bacon grease instead of olive oil, added extra garlic, used canned beans instead of dry and omitted water) and I added the bacon back in when I put in the chard leaves. Served it with a whole wheat baguette and received much approval. Eating leftovers for lunch now with a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for some kick : )

I agree with those who found this a bit too flat, as written; I added some good smoked sausage and used heartier greens (a turnip/mustard/collard mix), and served it with a generous grating of Parm-Reg...

I thought this recipe was great. I made it per the directions, except at the end I decided to add a half-box of ditalini. I also thought, as rich as it was, a cup of a dry white wine would have been a good addition, so I'm gonna try that when I make it again this week.

I used kale instead of chard and because kale doesn't cook down like chard or spinach, the soup is leafier and beefier than expected. Kind of like kale stew.....Turned out to be great. The anchovies add a wonderful, subtle flavor. Also, for a little more nutritional value over pasta, I instead added 1/4 c. of barley. I usually don't like chardonnay wine with food, but my first taste said "chardonnay". Will try it together tonight as our Phoenix temps plummet to below 60!!

I can understand why the ratings for this soup are all over the place. I thought it lacked flavor. The pancetta flavor really gets lost; and, by the way, what are you supposed to do with the pancetta? Use it as a topping? I'm not a great fan of bean soup, and this recipe didn't change my mind.

Fantastic! We really loved this dish. The only substitution we used was sausage for the pancetta, and it was lovely. We took earlier recommendations and used all the stems and would certainly recommend future cooks to do the same. The parmesan rind was my favorite part, but everything was wonderful - it was earthy and silky and perfectly filling.

It turned out great- a nice and hearty winter soup. I would suggest a crusty bread to accompany it.

We made a few changes to this recipe based on what was in our kitchen but it turned out to be a really great and healthy soup! We left out the pancetta and used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. We also and added a porcini bouillon cube. These differences probably changed the flavor of the soup but it was a fine change as far as we could tell. We also added celery at the onion stage. We had never used parmesan rind in soup before and will definitely use it again. All of the flavors blended well including the garlic! I used 7 small cloves and it was definitely not overwhelming.

Fantastic! I've made many versions of Tuscan Bean Soup and this rates. Perhaps the unhappy reviewers made too many substitutions?

I wonder if some readers have misunderstood the term garlic clove here as a whole clove (head) rather than an individual clove. I didn't think 4 cloves were too many. Actually, I thought the resulting soup didn't have enough flavor. The dish I made with the leftover swiss chard stems (sauteed with balsamic vinegar, golden raisins and pine nuts), however, was really tasty.

Rating: 2
I thought the soup was decent. I opted to put the roots of the swiss chard in, and next time I would leave it out.

Nutritional information? Are you crazy? They don't even proofread the recipes! In any case, this is more of a garlic soup and the flavours of the beans and chard completely erased. Simply awful.

Absolutely delicious!

This recipe had a ridiculous amount of garlic in it. I added it, against my better judgment, and can't imagine serving it -- unless I call it "garlic soup"

Alexandra, put it in the recipe builder on WW's site to get the points or add all the points up yourself... it's what I do.

Great recipe, very easy, and unlike my normal tendancy, I actually didn't change a thing. Topped it off with the pancetta and some grated parmesan cheese, salad, bread & a nice red wine & it made a great apres-ski dinner. Even our friends' ten year old son liked it.

Simple, elegant, and tasty. Great as a first course or as a meal.

It would be helpful if you added the nutritional analysis for this recipe. Those of us on Weight Watchers would appreciate knowing how many points this would use. I have made this several times and love it. Very comfort foodish.

We loved this soup! I used leftover ham in place of the pancetta and served with crusty bread for a cold winter's day. Perfect!

Rating: 3
very good soup the second day I pureed 1/2 the soup to give it a bit thicker consistency. Also added a few cut up leftover boiled potatoes.

As we are now enjoying really cold weather, this hearty thick soup really does the trick, the only thing I think I would leave out is the swiss chard, as it doesn't seem to add anything to the soup, I added th pancetta after the soup was finished.

Pretty good, not great. Lots of better recipes out there. To Jim: Add the pancetta at the end after ladling into bowls. Just crumble it on top. Adds texture, color, and flavor.

Rating: 0
To JIM My guess is, as with many other soups, you do NOT add the meat. it is just the oil as a flavouring. :)

After you drain the pancetta on paper towels, when do you add the pancetta to the soup? At the end when you season soup with salt and pepper? Recipe is not clear!

I rated this in my mind as okay, but i would use a lean smoked ham as the flavoring meat. I like a bean soup, and would enjoy this one too. make it a (3), okay?

Rating: 0
The recipe is OK I guess, as long as you would leave out the adjective Tuscan. Call it just bean soup

This soup is fantastic. Don't know if I got the proportions right since I used 2 jars of ready-to-eat white beans but the resulting potage is rich -from the cheese rind?- and good comfort food.
