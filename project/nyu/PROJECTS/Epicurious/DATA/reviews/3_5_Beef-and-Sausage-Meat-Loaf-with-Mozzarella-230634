Fabulous! Have never added the sundried tomatoes (due to kids, not me!) but I also love to make this recipe into meatballs. Parchment paper helps control the moisture from the mozzarella. Making bit-sized for Superbowl with red sauce for dipping. Yum!

Really good recipe & easy to make....might want to cut the sundried tomato quantity in half. It added a sweet note my hubby wasn't crazy about.

Have made this meatloaf so many times I have lost count. As others have said there are many changes you can make and it will still be wonderful (I don't think it is possible for it to be dry if you do it right!). Have found the mozzarella is a lot for the recipe and I try to drain the sun dried tomatoes as much as possible. Apparently, my friend has made similar for Hamburgers and they are unbelievable on the grill!!

I grew up absolutely HATING meat loaf, but when I saw this recipe, I had to try it. So glad I did! I omit the sun dried tomatoes and instead added fresh mushrooms. The whole kitchen smelled delicious while it was cooking - and the sandwiches the next day rocked!

Wonderful! Had to make a couple of substitutions - roasted red pepper instead of Sun-dried tomatoes and 1C fresh basil-it was all I had, so added 1tsp. dried basil as well. Came out very moist and held together well - my husband loved it!

For all the work, it was the worst meatloaf i have ever made, dry to many ingredients and tasteless, threw the whole thing in the garbage.

I used this recipe to make and pre-freeze meals for a baby shower (gift). The husband has a gluten allergy, so I left out the breadcrumbs. I was worried it would be too wet without the bread crumbs, so I also left out the wine. It turned out very, very good! But more so on the second & third day leftovers! I can see how this would make a great leftover sandwich. I used the suggestion of one pound beef, one pound pork as well. Yummy - and I would use this recipe again.

I made this exactly as written and it was amazing. With some of the leftovers, I made a huge hot sandwich with marinara sauce and parmesan cheese on top. My husband shared it with people at work and it got rave reviews from everyone there too.

Absolutely Favorful! I omitted the salt....no need to add the salt. The only thing I would change next time is to use HOT sausage instead of sweet and will not add the sun-dried tomatoes. Because I like a meatloaf in brown gravy, gravy gave it a nice contrasting favor.

This rocks. Have made it several times over past few years, each time playing with it a little bit to deliver a different twist. Can do with 2 eggs instead of 3, use panko if homemade crumbs are not feasible. I like to add a half cup or so of chopped calamata olives, decreasing sun-dried tomatoes by same amount. I add a half cup or so of grated parmesan on occasion as well. Agree with a couple of other comments about reducing basil. 1 cup is plenty, really, maybe 1.5 cups max. Sometimes I do spice sausage as well. Just a few tweaks to consider.

I had to join this site just to review this recipe. I was cooking for my boyfriends family and incredibly nervous about it. I followed recipe almost exactly (cut out a little bit of basil as it looked plentiful). It was AMAZING. Dont listen to any of the reviews rating it as average and bland.. it is anything but.. moist and flavorful and perfectly impressive. HIGHLY recommeded.. will make again!

I tried a variation of this recipe. I left out the onions and sun dried tomatoes, used store bought italian breadcrumbs, spicy turkey italian sausage and garlic powder instead of fresh garlic (fresh garlic upsets my stomach)left out the salt and added a 1/2 cup of finely diced mushroom. It was AWESOME! Very flavorful, texture was good, cooked perfectly. I was told "It's the best meatloaf I ever had". The recipe really doesnt need any salt. Delicious.

YUM! The best meatloaf I've ever tasted! I'm a charcoal Weber guy and I did this (as usual) on the grill. It cooked indirect for about an hour and 15 minutes, until thermometer read 160 degrees. I also did a small dice on the cheese and added a bit more bread crumbs. (I thought it was overall a bit wet after the wine) Cooked in a 6"x 9"x 4" pan, and it filled it! Definitely a large meatloaf. Great for leftovers. I also placed 4 strips of bacon on top to cook as well. I will definitely make this again.

I agree with the majority here. This is the best meatloaf I have ever had. Ever. Hubby liked it so much that he actually told people at work about it after the first time I made it. Now that's incredible! The first time I made it I halved the recipe for the two of us and, of course, we had leftovers (this meatloaf makes GREAT sandwiches, btw). I made it again just last week and made the full recipe and put half in the freezer after it cooled. These are leftovers we're really looking forward to! The cheese and the sundried tomato makes this a richly flavored meatloaf. I like to serve it with smashed potatoes (smashed with just olive oil, roasted garlic and herbs) and a simple green vegetable like broccoli or snap peas. This is definitely a keeper recipe!

Best food I ever ate, maybe not. Best meatloaf, definitely. My husband repeated numerous times the night of and the next day that this was the best meatloaf he ever had. It's rich, so be prepared for that, but very, very flavorful. The fresh basil is key - don't skip it.

I made this tonight - very tasty! Made a few adjustments to the recipe: I couldn't get good fresh basil, so I subsituted about 2 teaspoons of dried, and ran some fresh spinach,and roasted red peppers through the food processor to mix in. I also used dried breadcrumbs. Especially with the extra veggies, it was a HUGE amount, so I split it into 3 loaves and froze 2 for later. Next time, I would only split in 2 because I think the leftovers will go quickly.

This recipe converted my twentysomething son to meatloaf and is great for a crowd. It is also very flexible and forgiving. Tonight for instance I added some toasted pinenuts that needed finishing. If you don't have a crowd you need to plan to have it for a while. it makes ALOT. I also found the cheee tends to melt and disappear so I put in a layer of large chunks in the middle of the meatloaf and then covered them with the rest of the mix.

Rating: 4
Oh, and I agree that the onions and garlic should be sauteed prior to mixing in. Makes a difference.

Absolutely delicious! Just finished eating dinner and had to comment on it. My husband and I both picked at the pan after leftovers were put away, it was so good. He said, "I want thirds, but I'm so full!" Made 1/3 the recipe for 2 people, with still half the loaf left over. Fresh basil a MUST. Also, I highly recommend using chicken sausage. Got mine at Trader Joe's (California). It was the vino e fromaggio stuff. Excellent. I can't rave enough about this recipe. Try it!

Omit the sun dried tomatoes and you have the very recipe my Italian boyfriend from high school's mom taught me to make 30+ years ago. I have been making it ever since, using basil and/or parsley depending on which I had on hand. It's a winner and has always been a big favorite of my family. The sun dried tomatoes took it one notch up the fork scale. There are so many things that can be done to meatloaf to make it wonderful. I never understood why so many people hate meatloaf. It's an original comfort food for goodness sake!

Rating: 4
I've made this several times and everyone always eats at least two servings. It can be halved easily and it freezes well. My husband thinks it's the best meatloaf he has eaten. I'm not a meatloaf fan, but this one is terrific. The fresh basil adds so much - can't imagine it with dried.

Rating: 4
Even this shows up under searches for "quick", do not be fooled! If you have the time though (not a lot - it's mostly cooking time), it is definitely a great recipe. In fact, I want to send it to my mom and dad. It smelled fantastic as it was cooking. My boyfriend kept moaning about how delicious it was as he was eating it. Will definitly make again - probably when we have guests since you can socialize during the cooking and because they aren't kidding about the 8 servings. For just the two of us, we have SO MUCH LEFTOVER!! You could easily halve the recipe too.

I'm a vegetarian and have to substitute the new 'I cant believe it's not meat' stuff in most of what I make...or go totally green. So, when I told my wife (not a vegetarian) we were having meatloaf...she's was skeptical and worried about getting a tofu surprise. She got a surprise. She, my 19 month old, and I LOVED it. Nice work and thanks.

I'm not a meat loaf fan but I've made this several times and think it's wonderful. My husband thinks it's the best meat loaf he's ever eaten. Like many others, I use less salt and substitue some "hot" Italian sausage for the mild. I've halved the recipe and also made the entire amount - both turn out great. Our kitchen is currently being remodeled and this is one of the dishes I made in advance to freeze and eat during our three months without adequate cooking facilites. The best possible meat loaf sandwiches.

I'm a lifelong meatloaf hater, but this dish made a convert out of me. It has a wonderful flavor. It makes a ton, so we just divided it into three loaf pans and froze two for later. We left out the salt and it was still plenty salty. It can get a bit greasy, so I suggest rinsing the oil off the tomatoes to help a bit.

Rating: 3
This was a fantastic meat loaf. VERY different from what I'm normally used to in a meat loaf. I pretty much followed everything to the tee, however I did use spicy sausage rather than sweet sausage. We like spice in my house. A few notes from this chef: Get the extra wide aluminum foil so this concoction never touches your baking pan. It really trashed a good piece of Pyrex and took way too long to clean. Also, it takes a very long time to prepare, I would say you need at least 45 minutes to prepare this. I would definitely make this again, the leftovers alone are awesome!

Rating: 3
I should have read the comments before making this this. Everyone is correct about it being huge - it definitely will serve more than 8 - like 12. Also it's way too salty. The flavors really blend nicely. I also used part skim mozz. cheese - it was oozing out of the meatloaf - might be better to put in a loaf pan instead.

Welcome to the grilling season! Made up the meatloaf mixture, but made large square "patties" and grilled them. Served each pattie open-face style on a square of foccacia, topped with a slice of fresh mozzarella, a drizzle of marinara, fresh tomato slices and a sprig of fresh basil - beautiful and delicious.

Nice, mainly 'cause moist (thank the mozz). I especially liked the basil, which imparts a beautiful herb-alicious flavor. Other ingredients (e.g., the sun-drieds) were less prominent. Experiment!

I had everything on hand for this, but I halved the original recipe and left out the sundried tomatoes because my husband doesn't care for them. I used part skim mozzarella. This is a robust flavored meatloaf with good texture. Just enough of all the ingredients, without any one thing overpowering. Very important to have coarse breadcrumbs for this, as opposed to store bought finely ground meal. I cooked it in a 9 x 5 loaf pan. Made garlic mashed potatoes as a side and salad and will definitely make again.

I found this okay -- a highly seasoned meatloaf, if that's what you like -- but despite being only lukewarm, I will make it again, because my family LOVED it. My husband, who eats meatloaf grudgingly, said it was the best he'd ever had; my teenage son wolfed it down even more enthusiastically than everything else he wolfs down. I made the whole recipe, but divided it into two loaves and froze the other. Among the three of us, one entire loaf disappeared at dinner. I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes, and the loaf was plenty flavorful without this ingredient. I used part-skim mozzarella and lean ground beef; even so, I don't want to think about the fat content. Next time I think I would substitute just egg whites for one or more of the whole eggs, trying to bring the fat/cholesterol down.

I thought this was great. I think regular meatloaf is far to bland and I loved how this was full of flavor. It may be a bit more greasy, but use part-skim mozzarella and lean beef to cut down on the fat. I only made half a batch and there was still leftovers. Here are the modifications I made: used part-skim mozzarella, measured the basil BEFORE chopping it (otherwise it would've been way to much), didn't have tomato sauce so used tomato paste mixed with some water, and omitted the red wine. Also divided into 2 loaf pans (each was about 2 inches deep) and cooked for approx 50 minutes.

My husband claims to absolutely hate meat loaf and has historically refused to eat it. Naturally I took this dislike of meat loaf as a challenge to find one he would like and I am pleased to report he not only ate every bit of it on his plate, but reported that this one was delicious. This is not your traditional blah meat loaf so to any sceptics out there, this truly is a wonderful recipe and is well worth trying. The Italian flavors make this seem more like a meat ball than a meat loaf, and according to my husband, that distinction makes all the difference! Note that a full recipe would feed an army of people - even halved I think it would feed 8 people.

After reading the reviews that this meatloaf improved with age, I mixed the meatloaf up a day ahead of time and let rest in the fridge before baking. Try mixing in half sweet Italian and half hot Italian sausage for an extra bit of kick.

Was very disappointed in this recipe. Was very hopeful the different ingredients would make this special -- in the end it was just meatloaf with mozzarella cheese and sundried tomatoes. A bit on the salty side and it makes a very large amount. However, it did make great meatloaft sandwiches for the next few days.

I made this with ground turkey and turkey Italian sausauge. I cut the recipe in half. I have to say I wasn't impressed with it, serving it right after baking. It seemed a little bland.

freakin unbelievable, so dang good. and i'm not a huge meatloaf fan. turned out super juicy (would definitely recommend making the meat loaf in bread pans or something), with the flavors blending excellently. got the ingredients from whole foods, so top quality organic beef and other fresh produce were used, don't know if that made a difference. used turkey/chicken/artichoke sausages from cost co (those fantastic adelle ones) because i couldn't find sweet sausages. i was already looking forward to the left overs for the next night while eating this for dinner, so i can't wait to go home tonight and finish off the rest of this fabulous recipe.

I agree with the cook from Sutton. While "good," this wasn't "great." But then again, it's meatloaf. How great can it really be?

I had high hopes for something different here, but was disappointed. Ultimately, it tastes like a giant meatball and is too cheesey. I also think the proportions give too many strong flavors together, particularly the sausage and basil (which I would tone down). Not inedible, but I'll stick with Mom's Meatloaf with a brown gravy and potatoes next time. FYI: This makes a HUGE meatloaf. Plan accordingly.

Cook in Grand Rapids: Time should not vary much even if you cut it in half; the key is to get it to about 165-170 degrees in the center.

I don't usually comment if I haven't tried the recipe. But one thing that I have discovered is that when I make meatloaf for 6-8 (or more) I make several smaller meatloaves that will serve 2. I bake them all, freeze what we don't eat the first night, and defrost one and microwave when we need a quick dinner. I will try the recipe. Loved the idea of the shepherds pie.

To cut down on the carbs I made this exactly as written, except I substituted parmesan cheese for some of the breadcrumbs. Although some of the mozarella leaked out (to be expected without the breadcrumbs to bind it all together) it still turned out great. Really nice flavor - different than a traditional meatloaf, but still really good. I halved the recipe and still have enough to generously feed 6. I froze the leftovers so am looking forward to pulling them from the freezer...

Cut the recipe in half - glad I did! It was still huge. Other than that followed exactly. While I thought this very intresting and tasty, the addition of the sausage made it seem like one huge meatball (not a bad thing), but I prefer a more traditional meatloaf.

I followed the recipe Friday night and the family very much enjoyed it with mashed potatoes. This was the first meatloaf I have made with cheese, sun-dried tomatoes and basil which is why I rated it "A dish beyond compare." There were a lot of leftovers since I made it just for my wife and two small children. It was even better on Saturday for cold meatloaf sandwiches to go with college football. This evening we broke up what was left in a large frying pan, added a 14 oz can of beef broth plus an 8 oz can of peas and carrots. Simmered for about 45 minutes adding 2T of all purpose flour to thicken. It made an awesome base for a shepherd's pie! Mashed potatoes on top in a casserole dish topped with more of the same cheese. 25 minutes in a 375 degree oven and we had a perfect Sunday night fall dinner. Don't be afraid of the size of this meatloaf (we dubbed it the "Titanic"). It feed our family of four all weekend!

Very tasty - good thing, because it's huge! Used a grocery store "bunch" of basil and the flavor came through fine. I'd probably use half the salt next time, but I think that's more to do with taste and the saltiness of the tomato sauce. Looking forward to the sandwiches!

Great meatloaf - very moist and flavorful. The basil gives it a great Italian flavor, wouldn't change a thing and will make again. Leftovers are great in sandwiches as well as broken into pieces and served as meatballs with spaghetti and red sauce.

I tried this recipe with a few changes, but would definitely try this again with all the original ingredients. I did not have the sun-dried tomatoes and substituted them with chopped, peeled and seeded plum tomatoes. I used regular breadcrumbs instead of the fresh and I believe the fresh would have been much better. This meat loaf is great with the mozzarella and the basil. Baking the meatloaf for and hour and fifteen minutes at 375 did not work for me, I turned the oven down to 325 after about 15 minutes.
