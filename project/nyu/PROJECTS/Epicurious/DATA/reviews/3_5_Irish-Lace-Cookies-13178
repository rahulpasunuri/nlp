Really disappointing. They look pretty flat, but the flavor was not good. There was no way to roll them without their crumbling into bits.

I tried this recipe and wanted rolled cookies. The rolling was impossible and the cookies did not spread out and become lacy, except at the edges. I did them exactly like the recipe and have been baking for over 50 years. What happened?? I have no idea but will try another recipe next time.

These were such a hit! Gave the recipe to most of the party!! I lined my baking sheet with non-stick foil and had no problem lifting the cookies off. I scaled down to 9 cookies per batch so they had room to spread. I was also able to make them roll over a foil wrapped wooden spoon just to see if I could and it was fine.

This is a great, easy recipe that anyone will love!

Very quick and easy to make. Did not roll because I didn't like the look of it personally. These would be great with a whiskey whipped cream or ice cream.

Very simple to make,but it needs a little bit of salt for added flavor. Using parchment paper for any kind of baking is the only way to go.

These were super easy and went over very well. Make sure to not make the cookies too big and definitely follow the directions to space them out-as they spread quickly.

These cookies were so yummy that my husband and I polished them off in no time at all. I baked them at 350 for 10 minutes (12 cookies per sheet, generously spaced) and didn't even bother trying to roll them. I put them on parchment paper while baking, and I had no trouble getting them off- i simply scooted the parchment onto the cooling rack and picked them up when the next batch was ready to come out of the oven. I will be making this one again and again!

Great recipe! Make sure to pay attention and take them out when the are bubbling all over and the edges are golden brown. I had to adjust my oven temperature and the size of the cookie to ensure I was getting right. I used a rubber spatula to remove them from the cookie sheet and the came off nicely. Be gentle and raise an edge just enough to get your spatula under and lift them gently. They taste great and could be a GREAT garnish to homemade ice cream or Crème brûlée. It is a very sweet cookie alone.

Wax paper did not work for me. I found foil sprayed with cooking spray and sprinkled with flour to do the trick. Tasty cookies once you figure out how to get them off the cookie sheet!

Wow! These are terrific. Had trouble rolling, but who cares. They are like a cross between oatmeal cookies and caramel candy. Parchment paper makes them easy to remove from pans. Great ending to a St. Patty's Day feast.

I'm not much of a baker and I don't even have much of a sweet tooth, but these are awesome! I made a batch of dough and have been making them a few at a time all week. BUT! I cannot roll them, and I can barley get them off the sheet, (even with tin foil). I am certainly going to keep trying, though. They are my favorite! 4 forks, for sure!

ok they taste fabulous! i got 12 oput of this recipe. not 40! I used a small cookie scoop (no, I don't know what number it ws) and got 12, which would have been fine but they crumbled before I could get them onto the cooling racks. I waited a minute on the cookie sheet & the first one started to crumble, so I waited another minute. I had more crumbs on the counter than cookie on the rack! I'm not sure where I went wrong, but they tasted fabulous!

Delicate and delicious. A bit fragile when removing from the baking sheet but, oh, so worth it!

OH MY GOODNESS!- emphasis on goodness. For every cookie I rolled, I ate one. These were fantastic, but probably a 1000 calories a piece. Now I have to get on the treadmill for 3 hours to counterbalance the many cookies I ate.

These are great cookies. They are delicate and sweet. I love how crisp they are and the oats give a little chewy bits. Definatly want to use a foil or something on the cookie sheet though, makes it super easy to remove them and let them cool without risking breaking the cookies while they set.

Sorry, these were a big disappointment. They were so fragile that several broke just being moved from the rack to a plate. I could forgive the fragility if the taste was there...it was not. I found these incredibly boring. I'll keep looking.

These are the best cookies on planet Earth. Save yourself some time- bake them on parchment sheets placed on cookie sheets. That way, you can put them on several sheets, bake them, take them out, and slide the whole parchment sheet off the cookie sheet onto a cooling rack, assembly line style.

I never figured out how to roll these cookies up- they kept breaking. But they looked great flat and were yummy. And the left over crumbs were amazing on my oatmeal this morning! Great with ice cream too!

Wonderful cookie! I rolled and than after cooled dipped the one end in dark chocoalte. Very elegant looking and also tasty. Simple to make. baked exactly like recipe said and came out great.

I really like these cookies but they took a little while to get the hang of them. I found making them smaller than recomended, baking them at about 325 and checking them after 4 or 5 minutes. They would burn after 10 minutes at 350.

These cookies are excellent ! I discovered it was best to bake them 3 at a time so I could roll them easily, but they are so delicious I don't mind taking the extra time. Delicious and very easy to make.

These were the easiest cookies I ever made! What made them even more convenient was the fact that I already had all the ingredients and it took no time at all to whip them up. I did not roll them, because I was having a hard time with how fragile they were. but everyone loved them just the same. delishious!

The first time I tried this recipe was St. Patricks Day 2002. All relatives LOVED It. I have made it for showers and get togethers and everyone raves. I made it again this past St. Patricks Day and some family members were distraught they didnt get to have any this year. It is a total winner. I have found what makes it better is after they are rolled into cylinders. is to drizzle or dip the ends into melted milk chocolate.MMMM yummy!

Baked these for 2 groups and everyone raved. I made them too big at first. Once I made them smaller, they were perfect. I only cooked them 8 minutes. I had no problem with them sticking or falling apart. They are beautiful and delicious cookies!

I had to throw the first batch away as I made them way too big and they didn't set up. However, tasting the batter made me realize the potential, so I tried again. I followed the advise of other reviewers and used a small melon baller which was just the right size and parchment paper for ease of removal.

Rating: 4
Wow! These were great! Delicate, delicious, just what I was looking for. I didn't roll them, they look beautiful flat, and no trouble getting them off the sheet, just let them cool like the directions say. They really spread out while cooking so keep the dropped batter on the small side. Just love them!

This recipe is so simple yet it makes sophisticated looking cookies. I made some and brought them into work and they were raved about. Definitely use parchment paper and don't bother rolling them. These crisp little delights are a winner!

Delicious, and now that I've figured out the trick to keeping them in one piece, I'll make them again and again. They stuck to my shiny cookie sheet, they stuck to the aluminum foil that was suggested. I was afraid I'd have a pile of crumbs (delicious crumbs, but crumbs all the same) until I decided to try PARCHMENT PAPER on the last batch. They came off the paper perfectly after letting them cool for 2-3 minutes. Try these with parchment paper lining your baking sheets and you'll be pleased with the results. I didn't even try rolling them but they look more like the name ("lace") flat anyway. They are sweet but light, and would be a nice cookie with coffee or tea (that's the Irish way aferall!).

loved them - god bless the irish!

i really liked these. not too sweet, nice and light. i just used a nonstick baking sheet and had no trouble at all getting them off, although i didn't bother rolling them. drizzling chocolate over them is a good idea, i'll try that next time. ps. green beer = blasphemy.

Rating: 3
Loved it! As others did, I had trouble with the rolling, but I left them flat and they were just as good. Didn't dip in chocolate, as it wasn't needed - a nice light cookie that I added to my holiday collection - they got rave reviews even though they weren't prefectly round or conical!

This was a hit at the St. Pat's dinner we attended but maybe thats cause lots of green beer was consumed. I strongly suggest baking these on a sheet of parchement paper then, after removing the tray from the oven, slide the paper onto the counter for the cookies to cool. Peel the paper away and you've got a perfect cookie. I did drizzel melted sweetened baker's chocolate over each cookie which made everyone very happy. The general opinion was that the cookie tastes like a Heath bar.

Delicious! I've been making a finnish oatmeal cookie for years similiar to this - but this one is much better! I baked each batch for 11 minutes, used a non-stick cookie sheet & didn't have any problems at all getting them out of the pan - came our just perfect! They do store well for a couple days in airtight container. Will make these again & again ! Great with your morning coffee & really, not too sweet!

Rating: 3
Yummy! It's important to wait 1-2 minutes after they come out of the oven before rolling. I found it easiest to tri-fold them by flipping one side, and then the other, in towards the center with the metal spatula while they were still on the baking sheet. I used a shiny cookie sheet, and mine didn't stick at all. But even if rolling doesn't work out for you, make these anyway. They are really good!

Nice taste but way too delicate! Look at 'em wrong and they fall apart. The tip further down about using aluminum foil is the best one of all - these things won't come off a regular baking sheet.

This is one of the easiest recipies I've ever tried.I didn't even attempt to roll them. The name says it all,"lace cookies"After a heavy meal these cookies are perfect.Tip...Keep an eye on them while cooking 'cause they cook quickly.

I liked the batter better than the cookies and I was scared that i had runied the cookies because they looked like lace you should write that in the recipie.

Don't be tempted to add spices, I was glad I didn't. The best thing about this recipe is the simplicity -- the vanilla and the oat taste really come through. My husband and father-in-law loved these. Also, don't roll them. It just didn't work, so they're not a gorgeous cookie.

These cookies were good with little effort to make. I did cook them a little longer than said because they came out too soft. They are a very light cookie and not very filling for my children but perfect for myself and my friends.

I had no trouble whatsoever making or rolling these melt-in-your-mouth delights. They were a nice afternoon adventure in something new to do with a cookie. I love the fact that there are so few and such simple ingredients. I'm always on the lookout for something to make with what's on hand at the time.

This is a nice version of another recipe that I have made before and love. Baking them on foil sheets helps quite a bit, because you can simply peel the cookies off of the foil when they have cooled. A nice addition to the recipe is to melt some semi-sweet morsels and spread them onto the flat side of the cookie, then place another cookie on that to make a sandwich cookie. Its great!

My daughter needed an 'Irish' treat to take to school. I followed the recipe to the letter but my cookies turned out rather crumbly. I didn't attempt to roll them because they seemed too fragile. Nonetheless, she and her classmates found them quite yummy.

Yummy- but I tried making them twice and both times they were flat and gooey. A delicious concoction, but I wish I knew why they aren't cooperating. It seems that there is not nearly enough flour for the amount of butter and sugar.

This recipe is a definite keeper. Just made it for the first time Dec.99 and everyone loved it. Would recommend doubling the recipe and leaving them flat (not rolling them around a handle).

My kids love them flat - so rolling is not an issue. Reduce from rounded teaspoon to slightly smaller portion (I use the small size of a melon baller)
