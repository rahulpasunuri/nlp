it was just okay. not great, I might make it again and modify it a bit to see if I can get it more to my tastes, but there are so many other recipes to try. it did have a nice bite to it, but that just might have been the quality of my hot sauce.

This recipe was just what I wanted, tasty, not heavy and different from my norm. I made minor modifications due to some guests not liking olives. My guests loved it. I will definately do this again.

This was fantastic! I doubled the amount of garlic (we are a garlic loving family!), but that's the only change I made. After refrigerating the leftovers, discovered it is just as yummy as a cold salad, or can be served refrigerated as an appetizer with some crackers.

An excellent recipe. Serving it in well-scrubbed crab shells makes an impressive presentation. I placed the shells on a bed of fresh cilantro to keep the shells from sliding around on the platter. One recipe was enough for 6 shells. After adding the tomato sauce and wine, I had to boil it quite a bit longer than one minute before it was "almost evaporated."
