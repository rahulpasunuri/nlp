well, it sounded so delicious I just had to try it. I made some real changes to it and I must share. i left the ganache as it was and filled the raspberries with a thick reduction of the sweetest sweet shiraz ive ever had, name: JamJar. After i filled the berries about 3/4 of the way wiht the wine syrup i added a little ganache to the top to seal it and put it in the fridge. Once the chocolate was set i rolled the whole wine filled, ganache capped berry in the ganache placed it on wax paper and waited for them to firm up.... OMG!! They are so amazing.. I love the sweet wine-darkchocolate connection with a backend of tart berry..

I made these for Christmas but modified them of course. I filled the raspberries with Chambord before dipping them into the ganache. I did a white chocolate ganache and finished them with a semi-sweet chocolate hard shell. They were fantastic! I highly recommend them :)

I made these last year to bring to a Christmas party and everyone raved. I got asked for the recipe a week later (they were that memorable!) I agree that high quality chocolate makes the difference. I also used less cocoa then was called for. I'll definitely be making them again, whenever I can find good fresh raspberries!

I made these around Christmas time and they were wonderful! BUT, I found that after freezing for shape, they reeeeeeally needed to be dipped in chocolate, put back in the freezer for a few minutes, THEN coated in cocoa. Much, much better.

I made these for a Christmas party. Used Scharffen Berger bittersweet 70% chocolate which was very good. I wished I had decreased the amount of cocoa powder as others suggested. Overall a very simple, impressive recipe.

I made these for a Christmas party and they were a hit! For the most part, I followed the recipe, but used less cocoa. I used a salad spinner to dry the berries thoroughly and used excellent 70% chocolate. I think lesser chocolate would be the cause of some reviewers' complaints - softening at room temperature, bland taste, thin ganache, etc. This is a recipe to splurge on!

I just made these as a surprise for Mr. Fox since tomorrow is a special day and they are heavenly. Fortunately I tucked them away in the fridge we have in the barn. Otherwise, they might not last until tomorrow. The recipe is very easy and very fun. Great for a first-time truffle maker like me. I splurged on a bottle of French framboise liquer and am glad I did. I'll make these again... they'd make a lovely gift.

This is one of the simplest, most exceptional fresh fruit recipes I have tried. Truly impressive presentation, just a few minutes of work and the taste is sensational. I have made these twice and everyone has been beyond impressed.

This was a great recipe overall. Great flavor and relativly easy to make. We paired it with the extra whipped cream which added a nice touch. The only thing would be is there any way to thicken the ganache? It was a bit runny so we had to chill it for a bit longer but that's okay. I would definatly make this again.

This recipe is fantastic - excellent for parties and easy to bring along. I also used less cocoa powder. Everyone who tried them wanted more.

Dellicious and very chocolatey. Refrigerate if you do not eat them all; they get gooey at room temperature.

My daughter made these last night and I actually swooned when I tried one. She used excellent chocolate--valhrona and took the advice of others to use less cocoa.

Made these as recipe suggested only reduced the cocoa powder as other reviewers have done. Absolutely special! Presented these to family and friends at a birthday party. They disappeared amazingly fast, The only complaint from everyone was that I hadn't made more, a lot more. These can be made and presented as a very special, personal, romanitc gift on Valentines day!

This treat was a great success at a New Year's Eve dessert party. After reading the other comments, I used only 1 Tablespoon of cocoa power in the sealed plastic bag. This was plenty. I also made a variety of the ganache for a companion dish of chocolate-covered stawberries: 1/4 c. heavy cream and 7 oz. MILK chocolate bits. Brought the cream to a simmer (per the truffles recipe), removed from heat, stirred in chocolate bits and dipped strawberries. Let them cool on wax paper-covered tray. These were a huge success with the kids and adults at the party.

These are awesome! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except for the suggestion to use less unsweetened chocolate for dusting. There was also a pretty good amount of melted chocolate left over after covering the berries, so you might be able to cut back on that amount as well and save some chocolate, since this is only worth making if you use the really good stuff!

So easy to make and delicious! Only dust with cocoa powder otherwise it is too much. Firm, fresh raspberries work best as they hold up better.

Made as is, however substituted the liqueur for marsala (was in pantry) and added a pinch of icing sugar in cocoa for dusting. Was delightful, made a selection of truffles for an aniversary and these were by far my favourites. The fresh taste of the raspberries contrasting against the rich chocolate was lovely.

These are amazing. Very simple and elegant. First batch I put into cocoa powder as the recipe calls for, but that is too much. Next 2 batches I simply dusted with the cocoa. Much better and more attractive. Love this!

The first few raspberries turned out fine, but after that they started to break apart. I finally gave up and dumped them all in, let the ganache set up a little and then scooped out little balls with a spoon. They looked lumpy and kinda nasty, but they tasted wonderful! Red Headed Chef is correct, the type of chocolate you use will make a big difference. For these, I used 55% Cacoa Noel. I'll try it again, but not until raspberries are in season.

These truffles (and yes, I consider them truffles - let's not argue semantics) were wonderful with a rich chocolate taste and the surprise of a raspberry inside. They were quick and easy to prepare for a party; even someone who didn't know how to cook could make these easily and impress their friends. If the flavor was lacking you probably used lower quality chocolate - I had a hard time find chocolate that was below 70% cocoa and ended up using Ghirardelli - it worked well.

I dont' think this qualified as a real truffle! Here's my recipe that I've made many times to everyone's delight at parties and as gifts. Heat 1 cup heavy cream and 10 ounces bittersweet chocolate (chopped) in saucepan over low heat until chocolate is melted. Remove from heat and stir in 1/4 cup raspberry liqueur/framboise (or any other flavor you'd prefer, like amaretto, grand marnier, kahlua, etc.) Pour into a bowl and let sit at room temp. about 1 hour, then cover and refrigerate several hours or overnight, until very firm. Scoop into balls and place on baking sheet lined with waxed paper. Freeze for several hours. Melt about 8 ounces bittersweet chocolate over a double boiler or in microwave 30 seconds at a time. (I like to use a 1-cup Pyrex measuring cup, as the handle allows me to tip the cup when dipping.) Dip frozen centers in melted chocolate and place on baking sheet lined with waxed paper. Store in refrigerator (to prevent bloom due to untempered chocolate); remove from refrigerator about 10-15 minutes before serving.

I like truffles because of their rich sweet taste. These were neither.

Amazing and easy. A wonderful addition to a Christmas party dessert buffet that received rave reviews. Everyone loved the whole raspberries. Will certainly make this again. Incidentally, I also made the coconut marshmallows on this site -- another keeper recipe.

Unattractive, bitter, and underwhelming. Don't bother.
