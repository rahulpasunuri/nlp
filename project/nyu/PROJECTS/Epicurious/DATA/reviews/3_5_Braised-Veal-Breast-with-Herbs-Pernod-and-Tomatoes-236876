The flavors are fabulous however I am not going to make it again because the meat is so difficult to prepare - the cut of veal is extremely fatty throughout and I could not cut even "chops" between the breast bones.

The recipe was outstanding. For everyone's information, veal breast and veal brisket is the same thing. The only change I made was to sprinkle the finished dish with gremelata of fresh tarragon, lemon peel, & garlic. I also made this with veal shanks--yumm.

As I could not get Veal Breast, I cooked this with Veal Brisket, and therefore increased the cooking time to a good 3.5 hours, covered in a low oven. The end result was absolutely delicious, accompanied with parsleyed noodles and sauteed courgettes with tarragon. I heartily recommend.

I have decided not to rate this recipe because the veal breast yielded a very fatty piece of meat. Since the flavors were so fabulous, I asked a chef friend if had any suggestions. He recommedned using an organic piece of veal. It sounds very expensive, but I just might try it.
