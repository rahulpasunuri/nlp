I was no impressed at all. The texture was off.

It seemed like a lot of lentils so I used one cup and 12 ounces of sausage. I am glad I did. It was a lot of lentils. Definitely needs lots of salt and pepper!

I love this recipe - it has become a staple in my repertoire. I use a little less fennel seed than called for because the sausage I use has strong fennel flavor already. I usually serve it over whole wheat cous cous. I love it!

This is yummy and fast to make. I made a vegetarian version, sauteeing the veggies in olive oil and it worked really well. I didn't have an onion so I used a leek. I also tossed in a chopped fennel bulb. I used a cup of vegetable broth and a 1.5 cups of water. Otherwise, followed the recipe as written, and it worked great.

I've been making this for almost 2 years now and it's one of my husband's favorite meals (mine too)! I use French lentils, Applegate Farms organic smoked pork kielbasa for the sausage, and thyme instead of rosemary. We usually double the recipe for plenty of leftovers and eat it with hot, buttered sourdough toast for dinner. Fantastic!

This isn't super fancy at all but a great, basic recipe for an easy to make, week night dinner. Really fragrant and a delicious way to get some healthy lentils and greens in you!

it is very delicious. My husband has a first look and does not feel like to eat for dinner. After he has a first bit, he just says wow! I like. He asks me to do it again.

I thought this was a super yummy recipe. I had used mild italian pork sausage, fresh fennel (sauteed with the onions & carrots) and also chopped up the steams and added with the sauteed veggies (I'm not sure they say throw these out). I also added 1/2 of the liquid of veggie stock and 1/2 water. I agree the sausage did give the dish a lot of flavor. It's going into my repeat recipe book as it was a hit with my husband.

I made this with red lentils, homemade italian pork sausage, arugula, and tomato instead of carrot. You have to love lentils and sausage, but if so this dish is great. Simple, classic, hearty. A great winter dish.

Nutricious and delicious! This is become my way of making lentils for the family. Even my 20month old eats it.

This is a winner with a few notes. I agree that using a spicy, flavorful sausage is important. Also, I substituted quartered fresh brussels sprouts for half of the swiss chard. They complemented the other flavors really well.

I thought this was excellent. I used spicy italian pork sausage, thyme instead of fennel (I didn't have the fennel and I LOVE thyme -- it went quite well), and a little bit of chicken better-than-bullion. I also used french lentils, which held their shape better than regular lentils and were very pretty -- something I can't usually say about lentils! To the lentil newbie -- red lentils are supposed to dissolve down to a mush! They are used for Indian dhals and other such dishes.

Indeed, a very tasty meal. With that said, I did make quite a few adjustments, as others have mentioned. I tripled the amount of garlic (I like garlic, but this did not make it too garlicky), I added a tsp. of herbs de provence, I added celery, I doubled the amount of carrot, and I used chicken broth. The only advice that I did not take which I regret was to be careful about the sausage that I used. This time I used a mild chicken sausage which was not flavorful enough. Next time I will use a spicy italian pork sausage. Thanks to all for the suggestions! They helped.

This was good, but I agree it is a little bland. I think just using more garlic would be enough to perk it up. Also, I'll probably use broth instead of water next time. My other issue is that I'm kind of a lentil newbie. I used red lentils and they were on the mushy side. My family still enjoyed it very much. Also, I didn't understand the instructions about putting the chard on top and letting it steam. It didn't cook, meanwhile the lentils were wasting away. I just stirred it all in and it was fine.

I added celery and vegetable broth also, and a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes. We paired it with a tomato salad and loved it.

I unintentionally omitted the chard, because the specimens at my grocery store were anemic. I was going to substitute spinach but didn't get back to the store later in the week. But this was still a great lentil supper, served with salad and focaccia. Will definitely make again! A few other modifications: made it with 1.25 lb of turkey sausage to a 1 lb. bag of lentils (about 2 cups): perhaps a bit meatier than the recipe calls for, but it wasn't too much for me, and it was not bland at all. I also added a cube of vegetarian vegetable bouillon (to 5 cups of water), since previous reviewers recommended using broth. And I added a couple stalks of celery. I agree that it takes longer to cook than the listed time. I'm not too keen on crunchy lentils. But I would still call this a quick and easy dinner to make: it's very "unfussy."

I made this recipe with regular lentils, and it took me much longer than the 20 minutes in the recipe. It is, however, a great lentil dish (I will try it with French lentils next time). The recipe is heavily dependent on the quality of the sausage. If the sausages you are using are not very flavorful, the dish will come out on the bland side. Fortunately, I know a meat shop in the area, and my dish was a winner. Will definitely make it again.

I had never tried chard before & thought this would be a good way to try some given to me by a local organic farmer. Unfortunately even with some of the adjustments, I found this dish to be rather bland. However, I loved the chard, I'll just have to find another accompaniment.

This is a great base recipe. You can adjust the ingredient easily. All kinds of herbs and different kinds of greens. Comfort food loaded with goodness.

I agree this is a good base recipe but can use some added personal touches... I'm a vegetarian, so I used "gimmee lean" instead of sausage (the dish just as flavorful with less fat and more protein). I also used veggie stock in place of water and put the chopped stems in with the onion and carrot (the stems are my favorite part of chard!). I made a yogurt sauce to top it off. My dinner guests loved it.

After reading the other reviews, I made several changes and found this recipe to be delightful. I used a little more sausage (three links), added celery and dried herbs as suggested below by Stacia. I used chicken stock instead of water, and extra chard -- and I chopped and added the stems along with the carrots. They're good for you, don't just discard them! The resulting dish was very flavorful and healthy. Definitely more of a stew, though.

As other reviewers have commented, this recipe is a good start, but to really make it work I started with sausage with sage (found at my local Whole Foods) and added dried basil, thyme, tarragon and a couple of splashes of balsamic vinegar. Celery is a fine addition as well. Next time I will probably double the greens.

It's a great idea, but not specific enough. The cooking time of different sorts of lentils varies wildly. Red lentils cook quickly. Tiny French grey green lentils (lentils de Puy) do too. Average green lentils, if not soaked more than 4 hours, take a darn long time to cook. As in the better part of an hour. And they're bitter when still firm. I upped the onion & garlic, and added a little diced celery, as well as some herbes de Provence. Also a dab of butter to meld flavors. Oh, and I wanted more greenery, so I added about a 1/4-1/3 of a pound of spinach.

I used bacon instead of sausage and threw on some goat cheese. It was great, but a bit dry. I might add more liquid next time to make it more like a stew.

This dish seems like it should be a soup or a stew instead of what it is. Or maybe a warm salad with vinaigrette. We thought it was okay, but only just.

This dish had a pleasantly sweet and earthy flavor--very satisfying. My husband wants me to make lentils every night!

The recipe as written was a little on the bland side. To perk up my leftovers, I browned more turkey sausage links (left them in their casings), cut them into bite-sized pieces, simmered the sausage together with the lentils for a little bit to make sure the sausage was cooked thru & impart a little more flavor to the lentils, and served it that way. It became a zesty, hardy, stew-like meal.
