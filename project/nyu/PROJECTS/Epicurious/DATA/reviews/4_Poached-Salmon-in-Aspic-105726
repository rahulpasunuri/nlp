Combined these flavors with the ratios and cooking techniques from the simple salmon crock pot recipe on this site. Served it with the green mayo. Everyone loved it.

Have made this twice and we enjoyed it immensely. Wonderful brunch party addition. I also served it hot without the aspic with a dill-sour cream sauce and it was a hit.

Yikes! Got whole (well, almost whole, head was missing)salmon from Costco. It fit in poacher (had to bend the tail a little)but didn't have full inch from top of fish to top of poacher. Consequently had to add a little more boiling water from time to time. Not sure if backbone was removed, but defnitely ended up removing large bone at top of fish after it was poached. Happened to have old Gourmet issue, but "Kitchen Notebook" section was useless (no pics). Came to a boil much faster than recipe indicated, so had to simmer with lid on for about 15 minutes before temp registered. Total cooking time probably similar to Canadian method. Edges were a little mushy (overdone?) but center was great. Didn't do aspic, instead covered with cucumber and lemon slices and served cold with green mayo.
