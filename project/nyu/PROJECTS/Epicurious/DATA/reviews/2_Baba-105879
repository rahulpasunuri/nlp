Try this recipe instead: BABAS AU CALVADO WITH GLAZED APPLE RINGS

Alain Ducasse is a famous french chef, and I think there was an error in the translation of this recipe. The words levure and levure chimique are respectively yeast and baking powder, so I think that if one were to add a pinch of yeast instead of baking powder, the recipe would probably work as it should.

How does this cake rise before you put it in the oven, since there is no yeast in the recipe?

This recipe is flawed. Babas usually contain yeast to make them rise. This recipe calls for baking powder, but then it says to let the dough rise until it has doubled. Baking powder won't cause anything to rise until it's baked at a higher temperature (unlike yeast, which can rise at room temperature), so it looks like this recipe meant to call for yeast, which would double in bulk while resting. Search for another baba recipe.

This recipe does not have enough leavening. The traditional babas are made with yeast, flour, sugar, butter and eggs - basically they are a rich brioche cakes. They rise a lot.

I think I followed all the instructions...but it did not work. The dough never raised! I was very dissapointed....:(((

I have to agree with the Russian reviewer about this recipe - except for the question of moulds. "Baba" means "old woman". Here in Poland the cake is baked a mould that an American would call a Bundt cake mould (maybe also tube cake?), and is fluted or ridged. The cake should look like an old woman's skirt. Old (19th& 18th century) cookbooks I've seen have illustrations of such forms. Maybe the muffin shape mentioned is a new Russian invention???

Didn't try this one yet, but looks exactly like the traditional Russian rum baba made in every pastry shop accross the country. To answer the question about moulds - original baba looks like a fairly big muffin, so, I guess, muffin forms will do.

The recipe mentions moulds. Is there some special rhum baba mould or can I use something else?
