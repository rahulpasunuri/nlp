Took me a couple of tries to get this right, but when I did, turned out to be an exceptional cake with a real kick. After the 20 minute baking point, don't dot the cake with butter...the pieces just sink. Rather melt the butter and stream it all over the cake, then top with sugar. Makes a world of difference to the appearance of the cake and distributes the butter evenly over the top. Also use sweet Marsala, not dry. Tried this with blueberries too and it was excellent.

Excellent! Made to the directions with fresh raspberries which sunk too. Cake bakes low...and so not a spectacular presentation as a layer cake but taste makes up for it. Used parchment on the bottom to help with easy release. Will try with Grand Marnier next time.

This cake disproves the saying, "Nothing tastes as good as being skinny feels." In terms of ingredients, it's almost a standard pound cake, so it's surprising how much difference a little Marsala makes. It's heavenly. The first time I made it, I substituted Chambord for Marsala. (I hadn't realized we'd run out of the latter.) The alcohol content is similar, but the higher sugar content of the Chambord caused the bottom and sides of the cake to burn. It's a testament to how good the cake is that I knew I had to make it again with Marsala. I changed one other thing when I remade it, because I think it could have a tendency to get too dark around the edges even when made with the correct ingredients. I replaced the dark, nonstick springform pan with a shiny tinplate one. Black pans cook faster, and I don't want the outside of the cake cooking faster than the center. I used sour cream to make the topping, and it was a huge hit.

I've made this twice in last couple of weeks; first time with raspberries and the second time with blackberries. Great both times; a keeper recipe. I did use less Marsala and more orange juice; next time I will try it as printed.

I used triple sec and cinnamon instead of marsala and nutmeg. I also divided it into two loaf pans, which wasn't so successful. I couldn't get them out without leaving the bottom in the pan! Very good flavor, though.

I've made this twice, once just for fun and once for my grandmother's birthday. Both times it was a huge success, very moist and flavorful! Actually, the second time I made it I didn't have raspberries so I used blackberries and I liked it even better!

I did not like the combination of marsala and raspberries. My husband and I each ate a piece and declared it "disappointing."

Simply divine. Found this after making Chicken Marsala and not knowing what to do with the rest of the marsala. This cake was not only easy to make, but the flavors balanced perfectly so light and airy. My mouth salivated just reading the recipe. I halved it and made it in two small pans and it still worked. Couldn't find creme fraiche so added a scoop of freshly whipped cream (with a pinch of sugar). Next time I'll try making my own creme Fraiche.

I've been making this cake since the recipe first appeared in the magazine. Always with great reviews. It is just amazing especially with fresh berries. I haven't have any problems with sinking fruit or overbrowning. I do use a 9in springform pan but don't change a thing. It's a summer favorite at our house.

I made this Grand Marnier instead of marsala and WOW! what a decadent dessert. Raspberries were not placed into the cake but on the side with fresh whipping cream. I made 2 cakes and they were a great hit with everyone.

I would definitely make this again. So easy! I used frozen raspberries in the cake (and fresh for garnish). I decreased the OJ to 2 tbs to make up for the extra liquid, and baked for a few minutes longer. Turned out fine, nice and moist. Couldn't find creme fraiche, but light sour cream was good in its place.

Surprised to see only 3.5 because this is definitely a 4+ recipe. Its quick to make and oh so tasty. I've made it with both all purpose flour and cake flour. I think it is a little nicer with the cake flour. I also put more raspberries on top of the cake and then use many more on the side. Also, forget the sour cream. The creme fraiche is the only way to go!

the teaspoon of salt is way too much - just add a pinch if any at all. otherwise, the cake was quite nice.

This was a fun cake to try~ I added the berrys mid way through and they didn't sink. The cake was good, but I thought the recipe called for way too much creme on top. I think half the amt. called for would have been fine.

I made this cake yesterday with a few changes. I used 12 Tbsp butter and reduced the sugar. I did not have any sinking problems, infact all the fruit stayed on the top. It is a good cake, moist and tender. Next time I will try to reduce the butter even more.

Rating: 3
Not a raspberry fan so I used cherries instead - about 2 cups, cut into halves. Also used all orange juice and less sugar but the cake was very good - moist and flavourful like everyone else said! Maybe it was fact that I used less sugar, but the batter was quite thick so I didn't have any problems with the cherries sinking like other people said... One of my guests said it looked professional; very pretty cake!

This cake is the best. Everyone I serve it to loves it. Raspberries can be expensive, sometimes I just use two baskets (6 oz. each) to put on top of the cake. The creme friache is great but the cake is still amazing without it. Some Marsalas make a better cake than others.

This is the best cake I've ever made, plus I mistakenly used an aperitif made of marsala rather than marsala, which possibly only made it that much better.

Whether you use fresh or frozen raspberries, this cake turns out buttery and moist. The combination of marsala, a slight lemon flavor, and the raspberries is absolutely incredible. Great even without anything on the side!

I've made this cake three times now, twice with raspberries (once fresh, once forzen) and once with blueberries. I have been asked for the recipe every time I make it! I serve it with Liberty Coconut Yogurt and it is a fabulous accompaniement.

Excellent & Easy! I made it w/blueberries and raspberries for the Fourth of July (raspberries are outrageously expensive here in South FL). I didn't have a sinking berry problem, but Alton Brown (of Food Network's "Good Eats")offered a solution for this type of problem -- dust the berries in the dry ingredients first -- it's supposed to suspend them. Now, if I could have just gotten the creme fraiche to thicken . . . I ended up using sour cream, and the taste was the same.

Thought the recipe was great although mine didn't come out as beautiful as the picture. The raspberries definitely sank and the top and sides and bottom got far too brown. I served it with vanilla ice cream and it was a huge hit with all the foodies at my dinner club!

Very good. Saw raspberries at the farmer's market yesterday and thought of this recipe. Rushed home to try and it was super easy. Forgot to buy a lemon so left out the grated rind, but I think it would be a nice touch. Some of my raspberries sank, others stayed to the top (particularly around the edge). It looked beautiful and tasted great. Very moist. You can really taste the marsala -- I certainly wouldn't add any more and in fact might cut it back a pinch next time. We tried the melted butter idea and then sprinkled sugar and it came out beautifully. All in all, a very good, easy to make cake and a great use for raspberries.

Rating: 3
Excellent and very easy. I used fresh raspberries and they did sink a bit. Delicious though. Good idea about the melted butter on top instead of "dotting" it on. Will do that next time I make it. I imagine this would also work great with blueberries.

Rating: 4
I decided to try a cheaper alternative and use frozen raspberries for the cake, with fresh raspberries on the side. Baking took an extra 15 minutes because I didn't drain all the juice out of the frozen raspberries, and they did sink in a bit -- but I actually thought that was an improvement (the cake looked a lot fancier as a result, not at all like an oversized pancake!). This one's delicious. I'll definitely make it again.

I made this cake for a summer BBQ and everyone raved about it. The cake is moist and bursts with flavor. The butter/sugar topping adds a nice demension to the dessert. I think this would also make a good coffee cake for breakfast.

This is a wonderful cake recipe. Fresh, in-season raspberries are imperative.

Having bought a Costco sized amount of raspberries, this was the perfect recipe to try. My family preferred whipped cream instead of the creme fraiche as a topping. This cake could be served as a breakfast coffee cake as well as for dessert. It was delicious and best the day it was baked.

I agree that you have to watch this very carefully, and probably take this out earlier than recommended. I took mine out early and it was already very brown (although the cake in the picture is too, so maybe that's the way it is supposed to be. I also had the berry sinkage problem. Doesn't affect the taste though, only the appearance.

Rating: 3
Very good indeed. Made this cake for a beach party/picnic and most people went back for seconds or thirds. Serve the creme fraiche generously, as the berries are quite tart. Be sure not to over-cook; I took mine out 3 minutes early, and was glad I did later when I saw that the sides and bottom were very dark brown.

This cake was fabulous! I made it for a dinner party. My berries did sink a little bit but I don't think thats a bad thing and the cake tasted great. I also followed the advice of melting the butter and brushing it on top. Made the cake brown more evenly and wasn't at all greasy like everyone else was saying! Perfect, fool-proof dessert for those a little intimidated by baking! Wish we hadn't eaten it all cause I'd like it for dessert tonight!

Awesome cake! Very moist and not too sweet. Perfect for summer raspberries!

It's amazing but true. I had this cake done from start to finish (including baking) in one hour. That fact alone almost urges me to give it four forks. The only reason I don't is that the cake isn't sublime, it's just very very very very good. And very very very easy. I like to reserve four forks for show-stoppers, but with fresh raspberries, it's pretty close.

Rating: 3
My husband said this was excellent and I also thought it tasted very good. I only gave it a 3 fork because of the dark colour (caused by the Marsala) which I thought didn't make it look so attractive. Used frozen raspberries and cut down the sugar from 1 cup to 3/4 cup.

An easy yet elegant dessert, sure to wow all your guests.

Well, I didn't give this cake 4 forks because the presentation was not pretty enough to be used for a birthday cake (which is what I was looking for). I used drained, frozen raspberries to put on the batter, and fresh raspberries to serve with cream on the cake. I used sherry instead of marsala. The cake WAS delicious, and my guests couldn't believe that there were no nuts in the recipe (I think the nutty taste came from the nutmeg, a really surprising addition). A success!

I have made this cake several times to rave reviews; only once did the raspberries sink! The taste was just as good--it just ended up like an upside down upside down raspberry cake :)

I have not made this recipe, but I have made the Beaumes-de-Venise Cake w/ Grapes on this site, and notice that the recipe is very similar. However, that cake only calls for 8T total of butter. This might work for those interested in cutting back the butter in the raspberry cake.

I've made this recipe often, with great success and many compliments each time. I have used jarred, drained Morello cheeries from Trader Joe's in place of the raspberries, and it is delicious!! Instead of dotting the top of the cake with butter, I melt the butter first and then brush it on the top before sprinkling with sugar. This gave a much more even coloring to the top of the cake. Definitely a recipe to pass down to children and grand-children!!

This cake has been a wonderful experience. I have tried several variaitions, using a berry puree in place of the creme fraiche, and a white chocolate glaze, and they are all wonderful. An easy cake and rave reviews from all that endulge.

What a wonderfully easy and impressive cake! I've made this twice with rave reviews and no difficulty with sinking raspberries. I acidentally used two whole sticks of butter in the batter the second time and I think it turned out better than the first. (However, I did omit the extra butter dotting when I sprinkled on the sugar.) This is a perfect foolproof dessert. Keeps well overnight if there are any leftovers!

AMAZING!!! I have made this several times and all to excellent reviews. I have even under cooked it and over cooked it (I have a dodgy oven) and still it tastes divine.

Delicious -- very buttery and melted in your mouth. I just made the cake -- did not feel it needed the creme fraiche (i.e., the calories). Would definitely make again.

Excellent. Used blueberries--raspberries would have been better but were way too costly. Also used orange juice in place of Marsala or other liquor--3/4 c. orange juice total. Could not find creme fraiche, so subbed sour cream. Creme fraiche would have of course been better. The cake was great, rich and moist. Maybe a little TOO rich--next time I will not use that much butter over the top. The only problem I had with the cake was that it looked like a giant blueberry pancake when it was finished baking. But I guess who really cares what it looks like? It tasted wonderful.

This cake is fabulous! I've made it three times in the last three weeks -- all to rave reviews! Love the berries on the bottom -- one guest said it was like finding a treasure since it looked like a plain cake before cutting. I have also made it with blueberries -- they do not sink to the bottom but remain scattered throughout the cake...also very delicious (for those who don't like "seeds"!!!) Another plus is that this cake keeps moist for days (if your guest don't demolish it in one sitting) This is a definite keeper!

Oh, this was wonderful!! You can smell the marsala when it comes out of the oven, but not much when you taste it. This was a big hit with my friends and very easy to make. It even tastes great the second day!! I used a 9" springform pan instead of the 10" and it came out just fine. I also used fresh BC raspberries .... they are definitely the best around.

I don't get the big deal about sinking berries. Some stay close to the top, some dive to the bottom, and others are strewn through the middle. It enhances the flavor of the batter, and individual slices are pretty. An earlier review said "greasy." This cake is not "greasy" but "buttery" and delicious. Might try it with Grand Marnier as the flavor of Marsala didn't come through. So quick and simple to make!

I just made the cake this afternoon, and it was delicious! I cut down the amount of butter to 10 tbls. (didn't put any on top while baking either)and it came out just fine. However, mine did take about ten minutes longer to bake. The marsala makes this cake wonderful and unique. It will definitely go into my permanent file!

To avoid the sunken berries I placed half of them on top of the cake after 10 minutes in the oven. At the twenty minute mark I sprinkled on the remaining berries and then the sugar. I was going to skip the extra 2T butter on top, but the cake already looked pretty brown so I added the butter anyway to keep it from geting too dark on top. I covered it lightly with buttered foil for the last five minutes to protect it from getting too brown. The first layer of berries did sink in but were just visible. The last ones stayed almost too much on top for my liking. Had I known they would have been that exposed I would have been more particular about putting them on "cup side" down. I also would have used more than half of them at the first sprinkling. It looks great regardless.

This was one of the most delicious cakes I have ever eaten! (I even hid the leftovers from my family.) Strictly speaking I deviated and not having marsala I used a combination of 1/4 c. more orange juice and 1/4 c. cointreau, but the results were still so fabulous I think people shouldn't be afraid to vary the liqueur (or maybe even omit it all in favor of orange juice). Next time will be marsala, though. And yes, I also had berry-sinking problems, which led to me sprinkling almost all of my reserve berries over the cake during baking as one batch after another drowned in the batter, with the result that finally some stuck around on top and the filling was deliciously chock-full. A fabulous ending to a mid-summer meal.

Rating: 4
The cake was easy to make and absolutely delicious! I served it for my "gourmet group" - 6 couples who meet every couple of months for a cooperative gourmet dinner. We used whipped cream rather than sour cream, made a raspberry-orange puree to puddle on the plate, and skipped the "dotted" butter as suggested by an earlier reviewer.

I now have this cake in the oven for the second time -- I did not need four cups of raspberries the first round, so I am using them up since the first cake was so delicious! As with other cooks reviewing this tasty, distinctly Marsala-flavored buttery cake, my berries, which I had ever-so slightly pushed into the cake, also sank to its center. This time I made sure I sprinkled them. I, too, will not dot the cake with the 2 additional tablespoons of butter after 20 minutes; it made the cake too buttery (still great, but superfluous). I forgot to beat in the second egg, but I am sure the cake will be fine... Creme fraiche is excellent on the side. This is very easy to make! I used an 11-inch springform and reduced the baking time slightly... As for last paragraph on brie, does anyone out there know how we can contact the Web site to notify them of boo boos?

i made this cake and the whole famer's market menu...it was all great! my only disappointment was that the berries all sunk to to bottom of the cake...next time i will drop them on 1/2 way through baking, and i would also omit dropping the butter on at the end, it's not really necessary and it make the top of the cake too buttery...but it was still delicious!

I would do this cake again but I would use 10 tbsp of butter. The flavour is very good but it is too greasy. The sour cream is really not necessary. For the fruits not to bury just sprinkle them, dont push them into the batter.

I brought this cake to a brunch and it was a big hit! I did not have Marsala, so I used Port. Regarding the other reviewer, I did use all the butter, however the sour cream is served on the side. Most guest only used a small amout or omitted it all together. The cake is moist enough that it does not need it. My cake did not exactely look like the photo - my berries were burried - any suggestions?

Looks like the "kitchen tips" section of the website got added to the end of this recipe. I found the recipe by clicking on the "farmer's market buffet" link that was listed the week of 6/17. I guess we can say this web site is for foodies, not techies, so if there are some linkage problems that just happens once in a while. Foodie question: Do you think all that butter is really necessary? I'm sure it's easy to take out the last two tablespoons (or certainly drastically reduce that amount), since those two tablespoons are just getting dotted on top of the cake, but what about the other 12 tablespoons? Do you think it could be reduced? Or maybe some substitutions like nonfat sour cream or yogurt? If it's really supposed to be a buttery cake I wouldn't want it to lose its integrity, but...

I'm just reading this recipe and wonder if there is a misprint here by having this last paragraph. I don't see brie listed as any ingredients for a raspberry cake dessert so why are we discussing preparation of brie?
