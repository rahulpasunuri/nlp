I used cornmeal, per reviewers' recs, and vermouth, and was pleased with the result. This was easy to cook. I served it with fried potatoes and onions, and the freshest spring baby carrots and green peas in a little butter.

My husband made this tonight with whole trout fillets. He just used regular flour and a little bit of white wine vinegar because we were out of white wine. Turned out spectacular. Highly recommended.

Wonderful 'as is'. It is simple and easy, making it great for the fresh-caught trout that my husband brings home after a day of fishing.

Excellent recipe. The simplicity of the seasoning does not overpower the great taste of the trout.

added green onions all at once right before the sauce was finished, but otherwise followed the recipe - great dish

Wow, the green onion sauce on this dish is a revelation! I used some leftover dry champagne for the wine and used a whole bunch of green onions instead of just three. This is going to be a regular dish at my house. So yummy!

This was great! Next time I'm trying the cornmeal idea. I DID leave some green onion for the garnish, and I am sorry I did--the ones cooked in the butter and white wine were so delicious. I served this with this site's recipe for bulgar with tomato, onion, and feta--a great combo!

Very tasty. Doubling the green onions and adding some capers to the sauce really make it special.

Great, simple dish. Followed the recipe as written, but next time will double sauce and use cornmeal, as suggested by others.

I used all cornmeal. I thought it was very tasty, and easy to make. I served mustard greens pasta (recipe on this site) alongside.

This is indeed a fast delicious meal, fit for company. I made it several times with salmon fillet instead of trout, and served with a rice dish and salad. One of my favourites.

I also used a mixture of corn meal and flour, which gave a nice crunchy taste. I used more than 1/2 tablespoon of oil to fry the fish, because it started to get dry. Overall, I thought it was a tasty and simple way to prepare trout.

this dish was divine. as other reviewers have stated, so simple, yet as good as anything i've ordered in a restaurant, anywhere. i used 1/2 cornmeal, but next time i will try all cornmeal. definetely double the sauce. i did, and wished for more. my husband, who usually hates anything that resembles the creature when it was alive, was in love with this dish. i served it with the broiled sugar snap peas from this site (fabulous, also), and a beautiful arugala & romaine salad with a simple homemade dressing of olive oil, lemon juice, some rondele cheese, and salt & pepper. we felt healthy, sated, and sublime afterwards.

Very easy and delicious recipe. I mixed cornmeal and a bit of flour for a crunchier outside and served with cous cous. In the past I have also used cooking sherry instead of white wine which was also very good. You can't go wrong with trout!

This was so easy and yummy, the sauce was nicely tangy and the fish delish. I also used half cornmeal, loved the results. My boyfriend said it was the best fish he'd ever had, and he's a big fish-eater.

Oh my! What a great recipe! I added all the green onions and it came out great! Very few ingredients, but the taste is unbelievable.

The sauce is delicious. I took the advice and doubled the sauce - a good move. This is a very quick and easy dinner that would work well for entertaining. It presents well.

Followed advice in other reviews and doubled the sause...smart move!! So easy to make, but has a wonderful flavor! Will be doing this again.

I made this recipe at least 4 times. I think that Sauvignon Blanc wine is the best wine to make this dish with and drinks well with it too.

I used about double the green onions and didn't reserve any for garnish. We thought it was GREAT! Quicky and easy and impressive and yummy.

Excellent dish, I fooled friends into thinking I was actually a good cook!!! I had to double the sauce and added all the onions. Yum Yum

i doubled the sauce {not the butter} and made it in advance. i used a combination,flour and cornmeal. this does'nt sound like much but this dish prepared is excellent. i skipped the raw onion and added to sauce also. taste like a chef stopped by. TRY THIS

totally awesome, very easy, and quick to cook

This is a great recipe for trout! I doubled the sauce and sauteed all the green onions, rather than saving some raw ones to sprinkle on top. I thought the uncooked green onions would be too strong for the fish, plus the cooked ones have such an incredible taste. The whole result was delicious and I will definitely be making this again!

It was quick and easy. But I had to double, no, triple the green onion sauce.

Upon my husband's return from a successful fishing trip, I was anxious to try this recipe due to the reviews listed. I was extremely disappointed. The trout itself was "ok" but the sauce just didn't hit the mark. Very disappointing.

A very simple and quick dish. I added green garlic from the farmer's market which was a nice touch.

Our neighbors caught fresh rainbow trout this afternoon and gave us two for our dinner tonite. I came to Epicurious to find a simple recipe and tried this one. This recipe is FANTASTIC for simplicity, quality flavor, and presentation. We had this with tomatoes drizzled in Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar with some fresh out of our garden Basil (chiffonade), fresh corn on the cob and a fruit cup of fresh giant California strawberries. It was a meal fit for a special occasion and was a 15 minutes meal! GREAT! Thanks to Epicurious!! (Sunday, May 6, 2001). Definitely, a keeper!

Really tasty, really easy dish. I used red meat trout instead of regular and it tasted great. Definitely a winner!

Really yummy and easy. The hardest part is removing any small bones from the trout but I used needlenosed pliers. The reduced pinot grigio was pretty acidic...almost lemon tasting. Try it and enjoy!

This is a fantastic dish. I added salt and pepper to give the fish more flavor. Also, to top off, toast slivered almonds and sprinkle on top to serve. A wedge of fresh lemon should be provided to each guest. Yummmmmmm!!!! This becomes a beautiful trout almondine with these additions, which is restaurant worthy.

I loved this dish. Simple, quick, and inexpensive. I added a little Mrs. Dash for seasoning. I will definitely cook this again.

This is a great recipe. I would add garlic powder, onion salt, and paprika (your basic seasoning salt) to the fish with the flour.

It was excellent. I wouldn't change a thing. It was easy and with my busy schedule it was perfect. Fed the family within 30 min.. Had some fish left over, so for breakfast I had a Fish McMuffin -- Excellent.(without eggs.) The flavor was great and I a wonderful day.

This was easy and tasty. I used bone in trout. The fish just flaked off the bone. The batter worked well. Seemed like it needed another herb or two however.

Simple and delicious. Doesn't hide the flavor of the fish. My husband rarely eats fish and he loved it. I will definitley make this again.

From the North Fork of the Middle Fork of the Willamette to the table, easy, quick, tasty and yes, I would do it for the third time etc.

Fabulous. Try mixing cornmeal with the flour for dipping. You can't find faster recipes that are this good... especially for fish!

Since trout is so plentiful where I live, I like having such easy recipes. This was very quick, not too many ingredients and tasted good. That's the main thing - good tasting and easy to prepare!!
