I suppose this review is a bit late in coming (I made this recipe in 2002 for a graduation party...or was it 2001?). Everyone really seemed to enjoy it (me included) and I don't know why I forgot to rate it, but here I am, rating it! Hehe. I came back to it to make it again for a Halloween Baby Shower that a friend is throwing me, as part of a Mexican spread. This recipe is versatile. You can use any type of salsa or cheese, and even add other ingredients to enhance it, if you like. I saw someone's review (1 fork) of finding the pairing of salsa and potatoes to be odd, but I assure you that it is not something I would categorize as unusual or 'an acquired taste'. It seemed perfectly harmonious to me. The cilantro adds freshness (and for those of us who love cilantro, would could resist?) SOoo, I will post the response it receives after its debut at the shower. Happy cooking...

Very good and easy way to make potatoes. I love potatoes of all types but this recipe is particularly good.

Yuck. My husband will eat salsa with anything and he thought it was OK, but if you wouldn't choose salsa with your potatoes just skip it.

I made my own HOT salsa for this dish and it turned out very well. My husband, who "hates" scalloped potatoes, was amazed.

WOW!!! Delicious!! I made this earlier in the day...then popped it in the oven @ dinnertime....what could be easier?? Since I knew the kiddies wouldn't be eating this, I added scallions to the chicken broth while the potato's simmered and covered the top w/ jalapeno's. Very spicy and went great with the fish I was serving. My husband and I actually thought the potatos could be a meal on it's own. Give this dish a try!

I really liked this recipie-easy and has a really good taste. What I did differently was that instead of cooking it in the oven for almost an hour at 350, I cooked it in the microwave for 15 minutes. I then placed it in the oven for a low broil for the melting of the cheese. I would definately make this again, especially on those "too busy or not-in-the-mood to cook days".

Excellent and innovative for those boring old spuds! Next time, I will use red new potatoes for a different spin. I would give it four forks, but, because pre-made salsa was used, it's a three. I will also make a fresh tomato salsa (there are a few easy ones on file with good reviews) rather than purchased.

This is an absolutely fabulous recipe. It is so easy and I had the leftovers for breakfast.
