This pudding was very good. I made it with gluten free breadcrumbs and omitted the cherries, using figs and dates. I made it about two months before Christmas, wrapped it well and kept in the freezer. Thawed then rewarmed in the oven as we ate our Christmas dinner.

Started with the basic recipe, but substituted raisins for the currants, dried cherries for the candied cherries, candied citron for part of the candied orange peel, and chopped pecans for the chopped almonds. I didn't care for the brandy butter created by the recipe--my own hard sauce would have been better. This was the dessert to Christmas dinner this year and was deemed a success by all.

This truly lives up to the 4 forks rating. Easy to make and delicious. I only wish someone could come up with the answer of how long it would keep. San Diego

On a lark, a made this as our dinner group's Holiday party dessert. There was no need for the back-up plate of cookies and candies that I also made. As I was in the kitchen putting the holly around the pudding, the guests were seated in the Victorian dining room singing "bring us some figgy pudding". The lovely blue flames from the brandy made a wonderful presentation. In addition to the currents, I used equal amounts of dried cherries, figs and prunes; zest of a large orange instead of candied orange and apple brandy instead of rum. Where we expected a typical fruitcake we were pleasantly surprised as it was quite tasty even bringing on requests for seconds. This was worth the cost of the pudding pan. It made a spectacular presentation, a visual delight and tasty too. Try it.

The flavour was sublime, the receipe easy, and just as good as any other Christmas pudding I have ever tasted! I made exactly as described - except I made a small mistake with the breadcrumbs - I made them by hand and they were a little to big, next time I will do this in the food processor. I also cooked it a few days in advance and poured some rum over the pudding in those days while it was in the fridge. Next year I will soak the fruit in the rum for longer - a few days maybe. It was the highlight of Christmas!!

Wow, after hearing all the reviews I thought I'd love this recipe, but I found it pallid and bland compared to other christmas pudding recipes I've tried. I'm a plum pudding nut and like to try different ones for fun. This recipe came out both much lighter than the nice dark puddings I prefer, plus the rum taste was almost unnoticable. I think it needs to be "fed" a tablespoon of rum every few days while it ages. I wish this site had a recipe for the legendary Jamaican black Christmas cake. Anyway, I can't recommend this cake at all, but this recipe might suit those who prefer a more bland cake.

My first time for making a Christmas Pudding. Soooo wonderfully rich with the Brandy Butter.

In years past, I have served prepared Christmas puddings, figuring I was no match for Mrs. Cratchit. This year I used this recipe and voila! it was fun and easy...and no suet. Several family said it was the best pudding I had ever served! The only changes I made were to use applejack instead of rum in the recipe, and less brandy in the hard suace.

I loved this dish. This was my first time making a steamed pudding so I used my bundt pan and covered tightly with foil rather than buying a pudding mold. It just barely fit into my largest pot so I tied strings around it so I could lift out of the hot water easily. Worked perfectly. Since the pudding was more spread out in the bundt pan, I only steamed for about 90 minutes and it seemed plenty done to me. I didn't change the recipe a bit -- used a mixture of dried (not candied) cherries and figs for the dried fruit. Also -- make sure you follow the instructions for the brandy butter to whip the butter and sugar first and then add the brandy slowly -- I wasn't thinking and dumped them all in without turning my mixer on and it curdled. It came partly together after I whipped it a while and still tasted fine, but not as pretty. I am going to buy a mold so I can make this dish an annual tradition!!!

I invested in a proper pudding mold a few years ago when The Washington Post published several "modern" steamed pudding recipes, none of which require suet. Since then, I have made several different kinds for the holidays and this year I made this one. I did not use candied cherries because I don't like them. I used sweetened dried cherries instead and added some chopped figs, along with the rest of the fruit. I used candied ginger instead of orange peel. I flamed it with brandy and turned off the lights, which started everybody singing Christmas carols; of course, by then, everyone had partaken of the Baltimore Eggnog (also found on this sight). Very festive and easy to make.

DELICIOUS.

I have a question: This recipe looks wonderful, and it says that it can be made up to one week ahead. I'd like to make it today (11/11), however, and serve it for Christmas. Has anyone made this recipe several months in advance? Thanks!_

I am stunnned! This is my mother's recipe from Ireland. As young kids we became so used to THIS Christmas pudding ,we would 'gag' at the suet ones of our neighbours. Having grown up in Ireland and now that I live in the US, my own Irish-born kids request this every year. Imagine my shock to see it on Epicurious!But it's good that it's shared around.. MK

This is wonderful. My husband hates fruitcake (passionately) yet he ate it all and gave it 4 forks - the only 4 forks rating that he has EVER given for a dessert. This is a fruitcake for people who don't like fruitcake. Hint: I found it easiest to steam the pudding in a lobster pot. It worked really well and was the right size.

Thrown into hosting a Christmas Eve dinner at the last minute there was no chance to make a traditional Christmas pudding. This was a great alternative, easy to make, and had all the flavours one expects of a Christmas pudding. It is lighter too, which is great for us living in the tropics.

A fabulous recipe which I made for a Christmas-in- July dinner party. It is lighter and more cake-like than the traditional suet-shortened boiled plum pudding which most Australian cooks make for Christmas. It keeps very well and the flavours mellow over time. Why we have a hot Christmas roast turkey and plum pudding in the heat of summer is beyond me, but tradition is tradition!

This is the perfect alternative to fruitcake as a spectacular finish to Christmas dinner. My only variation is that I mix up the fruit and spices with the rum the night before and let them macerate overnight. Yum!

This is the best steamed pudding that I have made. It has become a requirement at Christmas and it has traveled many miles over the years to be served at family gatherings. Make sure you leave several days for the flavors to enhance. It's worth the advance planning and works well in a busy schedule.
