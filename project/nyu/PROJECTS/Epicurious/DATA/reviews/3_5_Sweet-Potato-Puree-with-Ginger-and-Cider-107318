I have made this every year for Thanksgiving since it came out--exactly as written, using regular sweet potatoes (not yams). It's the highlight of the holiday! People remember it from last year and ask me to bring it again. My husband lives for it. It really stands out, for the fresh ginger taste, and for not being too sticky sweet and over-buttery.

i have used this with some adjustments for several years with great reviews. first i steam the vegetable until soft but not mashable. Then i put everything, but less cider and more butter in a pot and boil it down until ready to puree.

Nice flavor, easy to make, but it was a little soupy, so I recommend reducing the amt of cider.

A fresh take on sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving-- not as sweet or butter-loaded as our usual. I used powdered ginger in the puree, with chopped crystallized ginger as a garnish.

Doubled the recipe including doubling the amount of ginger. Big mistake!! So sour that it wound up in the garbage the day before Thanksgiving. If you do double the potatoes, I suggest maybe 1/8 cup of ginger. Then add to taste.

I love this recipe and use it every Thanksgiving. Instead of boiling the sweet potatoes, I roast them until very soft and caramelized. Then I scoop out the flesh and add to the food processor. I think this gives them added sweetness and dimension. I make them one day ahead, refrigerate, and reheat in a double boiler. I also add some freshly grated nutmeg before serving.

Add a touch of nutmeg for the perfect flavor!

I loved these sweet potatoes. I did them ahead of time and added the topping from the Sweet Potatoes with Hungarian Paprika. I will certainly do them again and will substitute candied ginger in the topping for the paprika. My family loved the potatoes and more were eaten than ever before on Thanksgiving. [t

This was OK, but too much ginger (and I like ginger). The texture was nice though. My guests and I agreed that we wouldn't make it again. We served it with the pork tenderloin with apple cider recipe from this site, and a roasted beet salad with gorgonzola-walnut dressing.

I made this recipe for our Easter dinner and it will become a staple. It was very tasty, with an edge of spice and easy to make. The puree removes all of the stringy bits so common to the sweet potato dishes (as well as low in fat). It also worked well making a few hours ahead.
