This salad is outstanding. I would adjust the vinegar up a bit, depending on your taste. I also feel like it's just too green. I haven't tried chopped tomatoes, but those would go well with the mint, and I like adding in some red onion or shallots. For those who find the escarole too bitter, it is one of the least bitter of the "bitter greens" so that is surprising to me. If you have access to super-fresh escarole from a farmer's market, I would try it again!

We too liked it with more vinegar. We substituted basil for mint since my son dislikes mint in salad. Very filling.

We love this salad. I too add a bit more vinegar. I subsitute the escarole for red leaf so it isn't as bitter.

I made this for a holiday dinner and it was a huge hit. The only problem was that I didn't make enough. Everyone who was fast enough had seconds. We like our dressing a little more tangy than the recipe so I used 2X the vinegar. Try adding a little wasabi or substitue 1/2 of the olive oil with wasabi oil to give it some zing.

The bitterness of the escarole was overpowering and unpleasant. Not a keeper.

Excellent, and didn't change a thing. Use a good quality parmesan like Reggiano; it makes the dish!

We are vegetarians, and we make this salad at least every 2 weeks. We love it! I cut the salt in the dressing down to 1/2 tsp.

This salad is perfectly balanced, delicious, refreshing--can't say enough good things about it. It's become a regular feature at our house.

I made this for a group of 5 and everyone loved it! The dressing was very simple and may depend on the quality of vinegar used, but we all enjoyed the edamame/escarole/parmesan combination. excellent!

Not much flavor from the dressing. We did not care for the bitterness in the escarole. The edamame was nice, will probably add it to other salads.
