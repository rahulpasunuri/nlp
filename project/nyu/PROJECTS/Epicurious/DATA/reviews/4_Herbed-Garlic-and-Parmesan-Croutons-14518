How have I gone through life without making my own croutons? These were great!

Absolutely the best I've ever had. Could NOT stop eating them. Used in a cream of tomato soup. Thanks for the freezing tip from a reviewer below.

These are so good & so easy. No more thrown away Artisian bread or breaking a tooth on store bought croutons. I use many different kinds of bread. Freeze beautifully!

These croutons were delicious! I used Italian Seasoning instead of the individual spices and this worked just fine. Will definitely add this to my recipe box for future use.

Why would want to buy store bought when homemade is so easy & so much better!?! I agree with someone who said store bought can break a tooth. In restaurants I request no croutons. For the reason that my back teeth are in jeopardy. I've had a few restaurant salads where the croutons are crunchable. `These are so easy. So good. And crunchable. Takes minutes. The herbs add so much, that the dressing can be pretty bland. I used the grated parm cheese. From the real stuff. Not the can. So good!

Very easy, delicious way to use leftover bread. Since we don't finish a loaf before it would go stale - I usually end up putting about 1/3 in the freezer for my crouton 'stash'.

After only getting these in the oven, they will now be considered a staple in this house, nor will I ever buy croutons again. I used half a loaf of baguette, and one ciabatta roll halved, Greek oregano, and didn't use parmesan because my Caesar will be loaded with enough cheese. Honestly, if you haven't made these yet, you are really missing out!

This recipe is perfect in every respect. Made exactly as recommended. Kudos!

Holy crap are these good! They are way faster than 45 minutes too. I'm going to try experimenting with some different breads, but I just used old crusty Dutch white bread and it was great. The bread wasn't crusty as in gross, just crusty as in crusty. Anyway, my salad was jealous.

Soooooo goood!!! I just made these for the first time and they made it into my favorites. I used Penzey's Italian Herb Mix and added a little fresh marjoram because I had it left over. Also added an extra clove of garlic and used a little less oil than called for because I didn't use a whole loaf of bread. Super delish.

This is a great recipe. It's not as good as the homemade croutons I've found at our local gourmet store or at some restaurants so I did not give it a 4. However, they are far superior to croutons found at the grocery store and they don't have partially hydrogenated oil or preservatives. I will definately make these over and over again. I might try variations such as sprinkling with sugar instead of salt when pulled out of the oven or adding a couple of drops of tobasco to the oil mixture.

Excellent. I also freezed these. So much better than store bought. You could lose a tooth on some brands. These are perfect!

This is the best crouton recipe I have tried so far, great flavor! They are great with or without the parmesan. I make a big batch and put them in the freezer - keep really well.

Really good croutons! They tasted wonderfully and added that great just-made flavor to the italian salad that I used them for. My family even ate them by themselves before I could get them on the salad.

These were great! Very Italian in flavor. The herb combination was excellant. I used them in the Texas Caesar Salad recipe. Stored the extra for snacking. Definitely will make again.
