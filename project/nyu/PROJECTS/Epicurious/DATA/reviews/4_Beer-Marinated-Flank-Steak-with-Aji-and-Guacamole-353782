The meat was delicious. I was congratulating myself on preparing the sauces ahead of time when I realized I had used parsley instead of cilantro. I added cilantro to both sauces. The aji sauce was delicious. We didn't like the guacamole but it may have been the parsley. i will make this again.

Delicious steak recipe following recipe exactly, using Newcastle brown beer, marinating for at least 3 hours. I made cumin roasted fingerling potatoes (see Epicurious recipe for smoked salmon appetizer) and sauteed zucchini with fresh oregano as sides. The aji sauce is nice (I used 3 jalapenos) but the guacamole sauce is a must. The ingredients are similar; make the aji in the food processor first, scrape, then make the guacamole.

Yum! Just made this tonight for some friends and it was devoured! The aji sauce was delicious and the marinade was excellent. This will go into our permanent summer dinner rotation...so good!!

Fabulous recipe!!! Flank steak is one of my favorite meats to grill and we are always looking for a new way to prepare it. Made it exactly as written and would not change a thing. I was looking forward to leftovers - but there weren't any! Both the accompanying sauces are fabulous! Definite keeper!

I made this exactly as written with the guacamole and aji. The steak was excellent and I will make this again and again. The sauces made an excellent marinade even better.

Made this for my boyfriend's birthday, and it was a success! He and my whole family were moaning and groaning over it the whole dinner. I marinated it overnight, using a very dark beer. I also made the guacamole and aji, both were delicious.

This is definitely a keeper. I halved the marinade and used 1+ lb flank steak. I used Guinness beer and marinated overnight. Wonderful flavor. I loved the bright fresh taste of the Aji Sauce -- I used mixture of both the red wine vinegar and lime juice. This would be so good with many other meats and seafood - or as a dip.

Delicious! I found this recipe in early '11 and have made it numerous times. Whenever we have company I make it and everyone asks for the recipe. It's my favorite marinated flank steak recipe now. Awesome flavors!

This is just wonderful marinade. I didn't even do the aji sauce and the guacamole. We used a bottle of boss beer. Just delicious! I will do it again and again.

Wow! Wow! Wow! I actually scored the flank 1/4 - 1/2 inch and it soaked up the marinade perfectly and I also was able to cook it on very hot grill quickly and perfectly med/rare. Used Bass beer and a little less Worst. The Aji and Guac were perfect accompaniments and I served with grilled onions and fresh red & yellow bell and anaheim peppers I grilled, seeded/skinned right before cooking the steak. Amazing, the family raved! Flavors were fresh and bold is right!

Excellent! Made with chicken instead of beef, and didn't marinate much time. It was delicious!

Great hit for a dinner party. I marinated the steak for 24 hours. The sides make it feel fancy, but are really easy if you have a food processor. I served it with the serrano ham and poblano corn pudding (always a hit) and a green salad with jicama and lime dressing. I prepped most everything the night before and it only took 1 hour to pull together the night of the dinner.

Pretty solid on its own, but the aji & guac make it phenomenal. Don't sub green onions for the Maui or Vidalia in the guac - the sweet onion totally makes this. I loved both sauces, but Mr H liked the aji much more than the guac - he sez the aji puts this combo on par with Nopalito. Aw yeah!

Delicious! We used an IPA for the beer and made a 1/2 recipe for 2 people. Flank steak isn't the most tender but its very flavorful and these flavors combined beautifully. The cumin was different but awesome. We didn't make the aji sauce but did make the guac. it was great with it. The steak alone was also perfect. Instead of green onions we used diced vidalia.

Used flap/skirt meat, trimming silver skin, scoring at thickest-very tasty. I used Newcastle Brown ale and 'Thick' style Worchestershire. Got nice charred edges, perhaps because of sugars in ale. Sides were also a hit. Served Zinfandels and Malbecs.

We made thie for Father's day and everyone absolutely LOVED it! I marinated the steak over night and prepared the aji sauce the day before so it was really quick from the grill to the table the next day.I prepared it exactly per the recipe - I always like to follow recipes to a tee the first time to give them a chance, then make changes if needed. I will make it again and again.

This is one the best bef recipes I've ever made. I get great reviews everytime I make it. I usually serve it with Yuca frita (from South America) and mango mousse (from this website) as dessert.

The steak was great - especially with the accompanying Aji and guacamole recipes. Next time, I might use regular onions in the marinade, since the sliced green onions stuch and burned to the grill pan, and didn't seem to add flavour since they are so mild.

Ok but not great.

I made this without the green onions (since I didn't have any) and used an IPA for the beer. It came out great! My husband and I loved it! I served it with the guacamole (also great), Mexican salsa fresca, sauteed peppers and onions and corn tortillas. Excellent meal!

This recipe was amongst the best flank steaks I have had. The flavor of all of the marinade ingredients marry perfectly once the meat is grilled. The guacamole is cool and balances the spicy aji on the meat. Fantastic.

Great, delicious recipe! The combination of grilled meat and the two sauces is awesome. Very simple but extremely tasty. I marinated the meat for 4 hours and it came out perfect. The cumin, oregano, salt and pepper combination work perfectly together.

This is fabulous..the steak has such smoky flavor from the cumin(I used a little more than called for) and everything goes together perfectly..a total keeper. Oh and I also used a higher ALC% beer(McChouffe) and it wasn't dry it all! 4 minutes each side..perfect med rare.

The marinade is excellent. I let it sit for 36 hours. Basted the flank steak with the Aji sauce on the grill after getting some nice marks. Aji was execellent as well, even better than salsa verde dolloped on guacamole.

I will add that I used grass fed organic flank steak - that probably put the flavors over the top!

I made this recipe for a summer afternoon BBQ party. It was a flat out smash. This is one of the best recipes I have ever followed. I followed the recipe exactly and made the Aji Sauce and Colombian Guacamole. This recipe is definitely part of my regulars now! You will not be disappointed, I would give it five forks if I could, Bon Appetit!

One of the better steak recipes I've tried! Nothing bland about it. I did prepare only one 1.3 lb flank steak, instead of the two, which meant I had a lot of marinade, but the flavors were perfect. I used a tablespoon of salt and a generous teaspoon of black pepper---I wish they had said how much salt and pepper, as I might have overdone it a tiny bit---and otherwise followed the instructions about rubbing the seasoning in with olive oil then adding the liquids. I let it marinade a full 3 hours, and then let it sit for 20-30 minutes at room temperature. I loved the smokey flavor of the cumin and dark beer with the bitey oregano. I prepared the aji, but not the guacamole. The aji was delicious with the smokey steak. I added a tablespoon of olive oil (because I like olive oil, and) to get it to pass through the blades a little easier. You sort of have to like onions and vinegar to like the aji, but if you do, as my bf and I do, it packs a punch (for not a lot of work)! This recipe is going on my regular rotation.

Rating: 1
Like other reviewers have said, the meat was very bland. If I had to make this again I would try marinating the beef in the beer and worstershire first, then putting the seasonings on after right before i put it on the grill. I felt that the marinade washed off all the seasoning.

I used an Aecht Schlenkerla Urbock for the beer. This is the smokiest Rauchbier that I have ever tasted and it is perfect for this dish. I recommend using it in your marinade. If you can't find it in your area look for another Rauchbier or other smoke beer.

I agree with all the other reviewers. This recipe is awesome. Will use this as my standby with flank steak from now on! Highly recommended!

It's hard to find a 1 1/3 lb flank steak, but a 3 lb works just fine. This recipe is absolutely delicious. I've made it several times. The Aji and Guacamole are a little work - but a quality food processor goes a long way. I use a gas grill but I made it over at my brother-in-law's house and he used charcoal and oak and it enhanced the flavor tenfold! As for the beer, the best for this recipe are dark beers that have relatively low alcohol content. (Too much alcohol will make the meat dry out.) I use Kostriker Schwarzbier German Black Lager. It's a perfect match!

This recipe kicks MFA!!! I used Stovepipe porter for the beer. Make sure your meat is room temperature when marinating and before grilling. Also, be sure you are using 1-1/3 to 1-1/2 pound flank steaks. I followed the directions precisely on this for a party of 30. The guacamole and pepper sauce work well (see separate reviews). The pepper is not burn, but a nice acid. I served this atop a raft of roasted asparagus and used the Deviled roasted red recipe from her. It killed. I was shocked as I didn't test the recipe prior.

Rating: 4
I let the meat sit overnight in the marinade and grilled slow over mesquite coals for about 15 minutes total until medium rare. For beer I chose a Boreal Rousse which proved a great choice. The combination of flavours was amazing. I would say if you are going to cook in the oven then don't even bother. This recipe is meant for charcoal cooking, just like they do it in Colombia. Served with Asian coleslaw.

Rating: 3
Very good combination of flavors! We tried several different cuts of steak and the quality of the cut makes a big difference. Also we did the guacamole without adding the water and it makes a nice dipping texture.

We thought this was awesome. As with the other Columbian Dish I have made (Columbo Stew), you really need to put it all together. The steak by itself was ok, the guac just ok, the Aji (well that was good), but all together it was awesome. I did not use as much pepper as called for as my wife can't handle anything too spicy. Nonetheless, came out great. Served w/ black beans, tortillas, and grilled some eggplant.

this was very good and easy! I loved the colombian guac, and I thought the aji was ok. I broil the steak instead of grilling. Served with rice, and potato chorizo stuffed chilies.

The DH decided to eat meat again after almost a decade of vegetarianism, so I wanted to cook something special. Fair warning: I hadn't cooked steak in at least five years, and we both have palettes of steel from years of eating spicy food. But I found this to be highly labor intensive and just good, not great. The steak was rather bland (though admittedly I did cook it well done rather than medium-rare), but even the aji and the guac seemed a little lackluster even though I made them exactly as printed. Was a little disappointed, but I'd be willing to give this another go.

I was very pleased with this recipe...the peppers for my guacamole seemed to be hotter than my Aji, so it wasn't as "soothing" as I would have hoped it to be. The flavors are very complimentary and the time on the grill is quick. I recommend this dish to all - especially if you love cumin! (The subtle hint of it is such a pleasant surprise!)

Our family didn't care for this one. The aji was very good, the steak only so-so. Everyone agreed that we much prefer the Herb-Crusted Flank Steak from this website.

The flavors were fantastic. Even with the removal of the seeds the Aji was HOT. Used another guacamole recipe; the fact that this one called for water was a turn-off. Although marinated for 24 hrs the meat was tough- perhaps I'll try a different cut of meat the next time.

Rating: 4
This was utterly AMAZING! The steak was so tender, and the Aji sauce had enough heat (which I took others advice and added mayo--mmm mmm good), while the guac (made my own) cooled it down. Great combo. I also came up with a fabulous side dish: Rice with fresh cilantro and garlic, with a hint of cumin, salt and pepper. Instead of using water, I used beef stock and a bit of water; add salt, pepper and cumin to liquid. When rice is cooked, fluff with cilantro and garlic. The entire combination of flavors was OUTSTANDING! My husband and I agreed, this will most definitely be on our "favorites" list.

Great flavor, but I marinated the steak overnight. I was too lazy to make the guacamole and just used sliced avocado with the aji sauce. The creaminess of the avocado and the spiciness of the aji sauce was a great combination!

The guacamole was outstanding, and the aji was good, but my husband and I thought the steak was sort of "blah". We followed directions exactly, used Harp beer, and marinated 24 hours, but we just didn't find it very good. If you 're looking for great flavor, try the marinade used in the "Garlic Mustard Grilled Beef Skewers" on this site. (I will definitely make the guac again, however.)

Made this recipe twice, once using sirloin and once with skirt steak. It turned out well with the skirt steak and was great in fajitas. The spice rub flavor was a little strong though, probably due to the thin cut of the meat. I would use it again for fajitas but probably not for steak on its own.

Wonderful marinade. I used a stout beer and added a clove of garlic. I didn't have time to marinade overnight but had I it would've been even better. We also added a third aji dish (has diced tomatoes and not spicy) it's a traditional aji from Cali, Colombia and is typically eaten with empanadas. We also served this with coconut rice which went very well with both aji's and guacamole. We also did red beans and a mofongo which was also an excellent addition. It was a hit and we will do this again.

OMG! (in the words of younger folks). I made this for a wine tasting party. Followed the recipe exactly. Taste tested the beef when slicing then had to fight the urge to keep tasting. The Aji sauce was refreshing. I made this into little sandwiches for the party. I spread the aji sauce on a slice of french bread, placed a slice of beef, then a roma tomatoe slice then a dab of the guac then another slice of bread (1/4in thick) to hold it together. It got rave reviews at the party. I had made a second steak at the same time, sliced and froze for future meals. Also froze Aji sauce. Definitely making again.

As for the Aji sauce, we thought it was very good. We used what was left over the next day in an omelet with swiss cheese, mushrooms, scallions, and red peppers. Yummy! The guacamole was good as well, I did not add the water, as one reviewer wrote,"who puts water in guacamole".

This was okay, not a whole lot of flavor. I didn't put the salt in the marinade only because the worcestershire is already salty. We usually salt our meat after it has cooked. I would try it again and let it marinate longer.

Extraordinary dinner! The flavor of the steak on it's own was mouth watering but the addition of the Aji & Guacamole took it to Rock Star status.

This was fantastic. I served it at my birthday dinner and we all LOVED it. I purchased two flank steaks at Costco and made the recipe as written, except I neglected to seed the jalapenos and the result was a scorching hot Aji sauce. I also found that only a small amount of water was needed for the guacamole. This was very easy to make and only required about half an hour of prep work in the kitchen ahead of time. A definite keeper!

I don't usually write or rave, but this one is worth it. Made with one 2 lb flank steak and marinated overnight. Used both the Aji sauce and my own guac (made with 2 avocados, cilantro, one small tomato, and one serrano chile, plus lime juice). The balance of the Aji and guac with the flank was perfect. Served with creamed fresh corn and potatoes baked then finished on the grill. Wonderful. Will definitely repeat.

This is one of the most fantastic recipes for steak ever made! It was really easy, I eyeballed the measurements, and used tri-tips. My company and family raved. The Aji sauce is tops and this is the best guacamole I have ever had. We had it with chips the next day and are still talking about it. Make sure you don't over cook the meat and scoring it before putting the rub on it, is the key. The flavor of the meat is superb but the aji sauce sets it apart from any barbeque that I have ever had. Enjoy!
