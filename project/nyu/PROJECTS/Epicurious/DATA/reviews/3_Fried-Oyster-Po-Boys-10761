I'm about to make this recipe and couldn't help but chuckle at the reviewer who cautions us not to destroy the taste of the oysters with lettuce, tomato, and tartar sauce... I guess those hamburger pickles, lemon, and ketchup let the real oyster flavor through??

Awesome this was 3 1/2 in my book. I have had OYSTER PO' BOYS in New Orleans& Gretna LA.and this was a great 2nd. Warm bread does enhance the flavor. A definite repeat in my Kitchen

This recipe is OFF THE HOOK! I made it for a group of friends and those po' boys were gone so fast. Although, maybe they just like fried stuff. No matter, I am definitely making this again!!!! I totally recommend it.

I'm from New Orleans, this Sandwich was invented here. No matter how else I have eaten Fried Oyster Po-boys the best is: Warm the French Bread, Butter both sides, dip oysters in cornmeal,Fry oysters lightly, place on bread, add lemon juice and ketchup to oysters. Top with hamburger dill slices. Do not destroy the taste of the oysters with lettuce and tomato or tartar sauce. Bon Appetit!!!! Charlene

I would make this again with the exception that I would saute it rather than deep fry it.
