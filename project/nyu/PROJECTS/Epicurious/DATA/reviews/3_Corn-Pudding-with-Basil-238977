Terrific as-is and easily halved. Great way to use up leftover corn-on-the-cob. Very flavorful.

I thought this was a great base recipe. I added a little fresh mint, pepper and a little hot pepper, then grated some romano on top. Loved it!

I realy liked this recipe because you could taste all the flavors the way they should be, not smothered in someting else. Maybe if the corn wasn't freshh or the basil wassn't fresh it would taste bland, as another reviewer stated. All of my guest thought it was simply delicious!

My daughter-in-law suggested I sautee a leek and add it to the recipe. I also increased the salt to 1/2 tsp. and added 1/2 tsp. white pepper. We served it with spicey baked shrimp that many of our guests ladled right over the pudding. It got raves.

Well, I have loved corn pudding since I was a child. I was excited to try this as it sounded creamy and delicious. Not so in the finished product. I also, had organic corn, cream, milk and other quality ingredients. I found the corn kernels that weren't pureed to be toooo hard and crunchy. Not at all what I think of when I think of corn pudding. I tried half the recipe again but this time I put all the corn in the processor and spun it to a nice thick paste... then added the rest of the ingredients and a pinch more sugar and sald and pepper. I too, put a bit of grated cheddar on top 2nd go around. Seemed to be much better, but I wasn't seriously impressed. I have a notion to try again but add some nutmeg... sounds more interesting.... anyway, just was sort of eh. Not great.

I thought it was great, but I did add salt, cayenne and topped it with grated Cheddar. I'm sure it would not have been as good without these additions. The recipe also halves well.

I got rave reviews with this pudding. I did gussy it up as suggested by some of the other reviewers. I added a bit of paprika for spice and topped it with some shredded parmesean. For my own touch I added some freshly ground white pepper, which added a certain nuttiness. Definitely a repeatable.

Not what I expected. The dish looks beautiful - just like the photo, but it was very bland and I did not like the texture. Does have good corn flavour but not enough taste. Fresh basil is something I always love adding, but it was not a good addition here. Corn quiche is what this is. Would not make this dish again.

Made this tonight as corn at the farmers market is so inexpensive and so delicious. I thought this was a great way to use all the extra corn I had. I did add 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper to give it punch and a bit more salt. Will do this again.

We thought this recipe was quite good -- creamy and full of corn flavor. In my experience, fresh basil loses its flavor when cooked, so I used dry basil instead. I used leftover grilled corn. Parmesan or another cheese on top would be a nice addition but we liked it without. Definitely another addition to my recipe file.

This recipe is a very good way to use corn that has been lying around for a few days. I added a little hot smoked paprika, and it gave the dish that needed little bit of zip. It was very simple to make, and we enjoyed it very much. I wonder what would happen if one added a little grated Parmesan before baking the pudding?

Ughhhhhhhhh! Totally disappointing. I had fresh farmer's market corn, home grown basil, organic cream and it STILL came out blah. My husband described it as "flat." I thought it might have had too much basil, but not really. I honestly couldn't figure out why it wasn't "wow" with all those ingredients, it was just boring and disappointing, not creamy and velvety like I had envisioned. Bummer, all the other recipes I made from this issue have been to die for!
