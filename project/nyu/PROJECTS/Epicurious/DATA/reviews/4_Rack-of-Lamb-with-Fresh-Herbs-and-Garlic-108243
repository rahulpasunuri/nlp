Excellent recipe. I was afraid of the mint because my husband doesn't care for it but it was so nicley balanced with the other ingredients he didn't even know it was there and proceded to devour nearly an entire rack all to himself. I grilled it indirect medium for 10 minutes each side - cooked to perfection!

This was the best lamb recipe I have ever done, and I have cooked a good amount of lamb in my day. I did marinate the racks in the herb mixture overnight.

Fabulous recipe. Used some mint that is growing wild interspersed with some of my shrubs and rosemary growing in my herb garden. Was worried about the herbs staying on while browning but it turned out perfectly. Timing was right on as well. Meat was tender and perfectly medium all the way through. And so tasty!!!!!! Will certainly do again and again and again! Just wish those racks of lamb were not so darned expensive!!!!

Wonderful. Added 2 tbsp. fresh thyme, increased parsley to 1/2 c. Italian, 1 tsp. herb de Provence, added 1/4 cup dijon, 1 tbsp soya souce. Decreased the oil to 2 tbsp. Processed to pesto in the Magic Bullet. Fantastic in the Turbo Chef - 2 large racks 7 minutes - better than any restaurant.

Incredible recipe! I have made this 5 times and follow the recipe for ingredients, but grill it instead. Be sure to use tin foil to cover each bone to prevent burning. SO delicious! Hands down one of my favorite lamb dishes.

This recipe went over well at this years Easter dinner! Everyone loved it especially my niece and nephew who were not big on lamb until I made this recipe. They each had 2 maybe 3 servings! I did not make the recipe exactly as printed. My changes were, I omitted the mint leaves (because I did not have any) and the fennel seeds because I do not like them. For the herbs de Provence I used fresh thyme, fresh basil and fresh sage all ground in the food processor with the rest of the ingredients. I put the entire rub on the lamb (omitted the salt) and marinated it overnight in the refrigerator (12 hrs). The next day, I did not bring the lamb to room temperature nor did I pan sear it first. I took the lamb straight from the fridge and placed them on a cookie sheet and straight into a hot 450-degree oven. Because the lamb was cold, I baked it for 22 minutes without a thermometer. Then I took the lamb out of the oven, separated each chop and put it back in the oven for 6 more minutes because everyone wanted it well done. Lamb came out perfect, well-seasoned and tasted fantastic! I will defiantly be making this again! My sister in- law has asked for my version of the recipe!

Fabulous and very easy! I usually don't like too much mint but it didn't overpower the lamb at all. Also, I had a thicker rack and it took the full 20 mins to get to medium rare, so it seems like the best bet for cooking times is to just watch the meat thermometer slavishly until it's done.

Very simple, straightforward... and delicious! Since ovens (and racks of lamb) vary, using the time to gauge "doneness" is dangerous. We cooked ours to 130 degrees (not sure how long that was) and it was perfect - medium rare. However, the last rack of lamb we bought was smaller... so it would have taken less time. Instead of using the leftover paste for a "sauce," I used it on the roasted potatoes (which I had started earlier than the lamb, and finished when the lamb was in the oven) as well as some roasted carrots (which I finished off with a gremolata that had parsley, mint, garlic and lemon zest - no rosemary, since I don't like raw rosemary.) The meal was a big hit!

Atrayed from Europe into Middle East. Replaced rosemary (an herb to be both respected and feared) with thyme and infuse oil with dry fried and homeground saffron. Served with lemon wedges. Cooking time is definitely too much.

This was my first try at rack of lamb a while ago and now I make it all the time with various mixtures of herbs, always using this recipe as a guide. My husband is in heaven! Toyed with a roasted garlic and sundried tomato paste as well but still like the herb/garlic the best.

Extremely flavorful without overpowering the lamb. Am looking forward to making this again.

Sublime. Don't cook 20 minutes -- check after 5, 10, and 15, as the meat can cook very quickly. Mine usually take between 10 and 15 minutes. Also, the meat can rest between searing and baking, to help with timing for a dinner party.

Yummy, but I overcooked it! I used a dutch oven for the browning, then set the whole thing in the oven for 20 minutes, internal temperature got to 160!!. Next time I'll check it after 10 minutes

AMAZING. My first time cooking lamb; followed the recipe exactly except that I was a bit short on the mint. One guest who had a bad experience with lamb before was impressed.

I made dish recently for another couple. I followed advice of others - trimmed fat, browned racks, then added all the of the herb paste. I then cooked them using my convection oven and a probe set to 130 - every chop was perfect.

I made this dish last night for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. It was absolutely wonderful. It was my first time cooking lamb and this recipe was so simple. Followed the recipe for the most part but did what other reviewers suggested and put all the herb coating on the lamb. I can't say enough about it.

I am usually not too fond of cooking red meat dishes as I tend to overdo them but this recipe was SO easy to follow. It got lots of raves and I am definitely going to do it again...

Very good and easy. I halved the recipe and used boneless lamb loins, adjusting the cooking time accordingly. The rub doesn't need all the oil it calls for at all. I used about 1/4 of what it calls for. I loved it and will make it again soon.

Amazing with New Zealand rack of lamb. Tried it the first time with domestic lamb and it tasted like steak with some herbs. Be careful not to overcook the meat.

This lamb was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly (except that I cut it in half)and it worked out perfectly. When I first tasted the sauce at the end, I thought it was overwhelmingly garlic-y, but when it was actually on the lamb, it was wonderful! I highly suggest this recipe (especially to those who haven't cooked meat much previously)!

This took center stage for our Easter luncheon. Preparing the lamb a day ahead was the key. Wonderful flavor and a breeze to prepare for a special meal.

I have to agree with everyone. This was great and so easy. I seared it and cooked it in an oven proof pan, not bothering to transfer it to a baking sheet. I also seared it as instructed but then added the other half of the reserved paste to the top half before putting it in the oven, since it does burn a bit during searing. It cooked perfectly in 20 mins. This is the perfect meal that would wow the in-laws!

This was an excellent recipe! I however, prefer meat to be medium so 150 degrees F was perfect. Even my fussy niece enjoyed it, and that says a lot!

We had a total of 7 people for dinner. We purchased over 4lbs. of lamb. We added fresh thyme instead of herbes de Provence. We spread the lamb with all the paste and marinated for two hours at room temperature. We seared the lamb on the grill for 2 minutes on high temp and then reduced heat to medium until lamb was med-rare. It was fabulous and received great reviews. Upscale restaurant entree ... definelty a way to impress your guests. You may want to cover the bone tips when grilling to avoid burning.

AWESOME recipe! It was my maiden voyage into lambdom too, and it worked out wonderfully. I too seared the meat first and turned the cooking temperature down to 400. I marinated the meat in a ziplock bag, and I put the pan in which I had seared the meat directly into the oven (saved some washing up). I also chucked in some quatered potatoes tossed with olive oil, salt and rosemary, while the lamb cooked, and then turned the heat up to 450 while the meat was tented. I reserved half of the sauce for dipping, but I found the raw garlic too strong, I would have been better off to use it all on the meat. Also, 'Dancing Bull' Zinfandel (California) went wonderfully with this dish.

SO GOOD! Keep an eye on the internal temp of the lamb. I find the cooking time in the oven can generally be reduced. This recipe is always a hit, and I'm often asked to prepare it for all occasions.

This was my first time making rack of lamb (New Years Eve) and I was nervous. I took the advice of the "commenter" who recommended searing the lamb first. I used all of the "paste" after searing. The one thing I would add is: we pulled off a lot of the fat before searing and am glad we did. It turned out great! My sides: baked fennel, roasted brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes (and molten chocolate babycakes for dessert).

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was spectacular! Very tasty. I put all of the herb rub on the meat and did not have a sauce. I left out the fresh Rosemary and added some powdered (about 1 tsp) instead because I find fresh to be too overpowering. The rub looks very green and scary but cooks up great. Don't expect it to be "browned" when you sear it in the pan because of all the herbs you are not really browning the meat. This is why I am not sure whether searing adds that much but perhaps it helps to seal in the juices anyways. I made this along with another Epicurious recipe, the Potatoe au Gratin with Gruyere and Creme Fraiche and although good too the lamb was definitely the better of the two. The lamb is so good you almost don't want anything else that might detract from it! The only tricky thing is that after 20 minutes the outer chops were cooked to medium rare but the meat in the middle wasn't quite hot enough so I did have to cut up the chops and put the middle ones back in the oven just for a few more minutes. This is a bit of a hassle since I like it when everyone can eat their food hot and at the same time.

The herb paste was great, making this our best ever rack of lamb. However, one thing I would suggest would be to sear the meat before applying the paste - otherwise, the paste tends to burn, and the meat doesn't get a good sear. Also, I tried making a sauce with the pan drippings, but the result was not very good - the lamb was fine without sauce.

This was juicy juicy juicy. Soooo good. I didn't have parsley so I just used fresh mint & rosemary, along w/ the garlic. Perfectly medium rare, after letting rest from cooking to 130. Seared in an ovenproof pan and transferred pan to over. Husband loved it.

This was the first time I've ever had lamb, and it was delicious. The flavor of the rub is incredible. This is a great way to introduce someone to lamb because they'll love it. The recipe is easy to follow and cooking was a snap, too (I used the grill instead of oven roasting). An easy, elegant and tasty meal.

Used this recipe as a great base! I was unable to go to the store so I have to work with what I had on hand. Minced lots of garlic with a medley of dried herbs,olive oil and bread crumbs. Encrusted the lamb and roasted until perfect!

Wonderful flavor, especially if you're a garlic lover! Did not even need the extra sauce. Next time I'd just slather the whole mixture on the chops before cooking. Served this with a Rhone blend from the Languedoc region of France. Perfect.

I have made this recipe several times, but my husband grills the lamb rather than searing/roasting it. The flavor is delicious. Due to grilling, there is no sauce but it is not needed because the lamb is so juicy. This is a keeper in our house! PS--we grill outside year round!

My family loved this recipe! I made it for Easter dinner and will definitely make it again..and again...and again.

Very good. Even without searing the lamb, it still turned out juicy. I applied all the spice paste to the meat, rather than reserving half for the sauce. Also, I baked the lamb at 400 degrees, until the meat thermometer read 140 (for medium). Served with baked acorn squash and roasted potatoes and a Rioja wine, this was a delicious meal.

To my horror, my husband volunteered me to make a rack of lamb for our newly formed "gourmet club" because he liked it so well. I had never cooked, and had only tasted rack of lamb previously. I turned to Epicurious, and found several "4 fork" recipes, and decided on this one. I was confident until about 3 pm the afternoon of the party, and then started to wonder " what am I thinking trying a new recipe?" I followed the recipe exactly and must say the results were extaordinary!! The others all raved that it was the best lamb ever. I did not make the sauce, however, did have mint sauce, but the guests said the meat needed nothing extra. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe and this web site. Can't wait til my next turn to cook......meanwhile, I feel like a "Cooking Diva".

I have never made rack of lamb before and this recipe was simply outstanding. Not only did it taste fantastic, it was really simple and fast to prepare. In my opinion it was as good or even better than any rack of lamb I've had in a restaurant. I only did 1 rack for 2, so I used 1/3 of the ingredients for the marinade (didn't reserve any for herb sauce) and the flavour was to die for. Served it with herbed butter steamed potatoes, stir fried vegetables and a nice bottle of savignon cabernet. I will try this for my next dinner party!!

I'm not a big fan of lamb, but my husband requested for his birthday and this was a HUGE hit. It was moist, tender and delicious. So easy to do as well. Served along with a mixed green salad/creanberries/walnuts/white balsamic dressing and garlic mashed potatoes. Served with a bold red blend (zin/cab/mouvedre). Buon Gusto!!

This recipe is really fantastic! Made it last night with rave reviews! I added more garlic than the recipe called for which worked well, otherwise followed exactly as directed. Cooking time is around 18 minutes per rack of 9-10 chops. Fantastic recipe! Quick, easy and excellent!

I made this recipe for our neighborhood dinner club and it was fabulous. The herb mixture that coats the lamb racks is very flavorful and the herb sauce you end up with is bursting with flavor. The cooking time was tricky so be careful on this step. Everyone loved it including my family that I tested it on 2 nights before!

Made this for a special birthday dinner. Neither one of us indulges in lamb very frequently, and this was delicious. Cooked only 1 rack (for 2 svgs) for 20 minutes per recipe, and it came out medium to medium-well. It was still tasty though.

this was the most delicious lamb i've ever had. the texture was great - the right amount of salt. The herbs were delicious but not overpowering. My husband usually get annoyed w/ rosemary in food (though he likes the flavor) but he thought it was perfect. You just can't go wrong with this. I thought the garlic was great. It is such a beautiful dish too. We like it cooked really well done and almost crispy on the edges - so in the last five minutes, i sliced the lamb up (as if i was serving it) and put it back in the oven for 5 minutes. that was perfect for us.

My friend said that he usually orders rack of Lamb when he's out of town, but when he had this dish,,, it was the best rack of Lamb he's ever eaten... anywhere! I followed the recipe and the sauce was too thick, so I added olive oil to thin it down. This dish is very simple and the flavour is excellent! Enjoy.

I used a leave-in probe thermometer and removed the lamb at 130 for medium rare. After resting for 15 minutes under foil, the lamb was still very rare. Good dish, but had to put it back in -- made timing my dinner party a challenge.

A garlic lover's feast. Layers of flavor, yet simple, straighforward and succulent.

This recipe was amazing. I made the dish exactly as specified and received compliments from all of my guests. The only negative is the herb sauce, which you serve with the cooked lamb when it's done. Whereas the high amount of garlic in the paste mellows after cooking to just the right flavor, it's much too strong to be used as sauce. Otherwise, this dish is perfect!

This was absolutely delicious! I cooked the lamb 7 minutes on each side, let it sit for 10 minutes, and it was a perfect medium rare. I will definitely make this for my next dinner party.
