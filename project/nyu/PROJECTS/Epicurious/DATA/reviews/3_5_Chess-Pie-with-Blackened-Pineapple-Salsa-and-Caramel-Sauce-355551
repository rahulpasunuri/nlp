What's good in this recipe is the pineapple salsa and the caramel. The pie itself is not bad but I didn't find anything special. I will certainly do the caramel and salsa again but will serve it with something else, maybe a quatre-quart or something like that.

Another comment here - I have a recipe for Chess Pie from my great-grandmother which is more like a pecan pie. Pastry dough tartlets filled with golden raisins, egg, sugar and vanilla. Wondering if this is also "chess pie" or something else. She served it with hard sauce. I can't seem to find any similar recipes on the site.

No review - but according to one legend the name "Chess Pie" came from an old plantation cook who threw together the ingredients and baked a pie. When asked the name of the pie, she replied "jes (just) pie" and the name grew to Chess Pie. The name could also be a corruption of cheese but probably nothing to do with cheesecake

I had never made or tasted a chess pie before so wasn't sure what to expect. This was delicious and easy to make. I wasn't crazy about the pineapple salsa but the caramel was very good with the pie. Everyone was pleasantly surprised at how good this was and I will keep this recipe ready for future dinner parties.
