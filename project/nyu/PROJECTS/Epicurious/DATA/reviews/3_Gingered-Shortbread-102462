I agree with the other cook from Vancouver and felt these were wonderful. Of course, I love ginger and am probably biased. I used the best unsalted butter I could find. Used several different shaped cookie cutters and found they were ready in 18 min. Will definitely make again but will try adding cardamom next time.

The cookies were very crumbly and the crystalized ginger was much too strong. It may have been my fault though, because I tried to chop the ginger in the food processor and it over processed and stuck together. I then chopped it with a knife. The cookies had an OK taste, and the people at work ate most of them, but they didn't lick the platter clean.

Awesome shortbread! I put the dough in the fridge for an hour or so, then rolled it out (about 1/4" thick) and used my small star cookie cutter, baked about 20 minutes until edges just turned very light brown. Made 3 dozen. Yummy!

I don't know if I did something wrong, but the shortbread crumbled completely when I tried to remove it from the pan. Taste was pretty good, although too much butter in my opinion. This wasn't crisp at all, and there was no trace of the "perforations", because the shortbread bubbled up so much. A sad experiment that went into the garbage instead of the Christmas baskets.

Really a lovely shortbread recipe. Looks beautiful with slightly golden edges and bits of crystallized ginger throughout. Tastes elegant and interesting. I'm including these in my holiday packages.

These shortbread cookies are wonderful, buttery, with a hint of spice from the ground ginger and the pleasant warm sweetness of the crystalized ginger. I've made them several times for a group of friends and they are always devoured.
