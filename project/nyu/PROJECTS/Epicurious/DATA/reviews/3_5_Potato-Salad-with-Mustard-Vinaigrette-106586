As someone who does not like mayo, this a great way to still enjoy a potato salad! It works well with any potato and is always easy to make and a family favorite. I agree with other reviewers to at least double the dressing, but otherwise it is good to make!

This lets the taste of new potatoes shine through. It can also get a bump from seasonal herbs like a little dill, basil or parsley or a restrained amount of all three. Let it sit overnight, if possible to meld flavours.

I made this for a large pot-luck and it was a huge hit! I made more dressing though because it didn't seem like enough and added chopped chives for some color. Loved it!

Very good. I made this for a picnic on a hot, summer day! Very tasty and no left overs!

This potato salad is a great alternative to the regular mayo/egg based potato salads. Great for veggie only friends. I love standard issue potatoe salad but this gives you a an alternative which got rave reviews even from all my friends. Finely chopped red onion can be used in place of the shallot and adds some color.

I was looking for a way to show off my home grown potatoes that the family would love. I NEVER make potato salad, because I can't even begin to describe my disdain for mayo! But I love vinaigrettes! And my poor husband loves potato salad. So this is a great recipe for avoiding mayo, and it's a great base to add to. I tossed in some green beans. Had to substitute the white wine vinegar for regular white vinegar, and it was fine. I used purple fingerlings, because that's what I had grown, and the whole family was happy! Also, I know some people don't peel them, and I think that's a personal choice, I peeled. This will probably get made three or four times this summer alone. (I concur, double the dressing!)

I was looking for a non-mayo based potato salad and this is it. Even my in-laws (traditional Southerners), who looked skeptically at this, came back for seconds. I used about 3 lbs of red potatoes (skin on), cut into one-inch pieces. Like others, I roasted them at 425 (for approx. 20-30 minutes) and then following the dressing recipe exactly. Delicious and a wonderful alternative to the normal mayo-glop.

I expect this will be good. I will add bacon to it! Bacon makes everything better...

My search for a non-mayonnaise-based potato salad is over! No one in my family likes those creamy salads, and this is a great alternative. Very flavorful. I just used regular Dijon mustard; not sure what "coarse-grained" is.

LOVED this recipe! I didn't have everything called for and had to make some substitutions, and it's still the best potato salad I've ever had. I used 2 pounds of potatoes for the amount of dressing called for (could have used 3 probably, but definitely not 4). I roasted the potatoes, and used regular dijon in the dressing. Finally, I had no shallots but I did have fresh garlic scapes, which I used instead. It was so tasty I had a hard time putting down my fork long enough to serve some up for everyone else :)

We added fresh tarragon (about 1/4 cup in a double recipe) and it adds a nice flavor.

I roasted the potatoes, doubled the dressing and used coarse grain mustard and everyone was raving about it. I will definately make this again!

I thought this was quite tasty and easy. I added some chopped celery and green pepper to salad. Used some white onion instead of shallots in the dressing and then finished with some fresh parsley! Would definitely make again!

I didn't have any white-wine vinegar, so used apple cider vinegar instead, and I think it worked fine. I also left out the shallot, which I didn't have, and added some dried minced onion instead. I followed previous reviewers' advice and doubled the sauce, which was absolutely the way to go. This was really fast and is a nicely zippy side dish. I served it with a mild fish entree and the contrast was great. I served it at room temperature, but I think it would be great cold also.

Very good. I roasted the fingerlings instead of boiling, and added chives for a bit of colour.

Very delicious and healthy. I also added steamed asparagus for a little green and crunch.

I thought this was very good, very easy. Based on other reviews, I used 2 pounds of red poatatoes (quartered but not skinned) and used the full amount of vinaigrette. I think it was a little too saucy for my tastes (I think 3 pounds might be perfect) but was otherwise delicious. I might cut back, slightly, on the mustard next time to reduce some of the "tangy- ness".

Holy moly this is yummalicious. One would think shallots would be easy to find in coastal Massachusetts, but sadly I had to make do with chopping up garlic and onions together. The suggestion to use scallions is a good one, if only for some nice green color. Ditto making extra vinaigrette. Totally delish.

Made this for a family barbecue. It was fast, super easy, and very tasty. Made 1.5 times the dressing and it was just enough.

Very good and healthy. I used baby red potatoes, halved but not peeled before cooking, short cooking time to keep them firm. Be sure to toss with vinegar while they're still warm. I skipped the shallots but added sliced scallions for color and bite. Used probably half again more dressing than called for.

Really good! Be sure to double the dressing. The only changes I made were to add a few dollops of mayo and about 2/3c pickles (can't escape my traditionalist roots, I guess). I also had to use whole grain mustard because I didn't have the coarse ground kind and it still turned out great (can't imagine why they tell you not to use it).

This was a nice twist on ordinary potato side dish. I had to substitute chinese hot mustard and champagne mustard (1/2 and 1/2) for my lack of dijon. Simple and tasty next to polish sausage, baked fish, or whatever. Even my 1.5 yr old ate them.

Delicious. It doesn't look terribly impressive but it's very tasty. I loved it. I did double the dressing as other reviewers suggested, and that seemed just right.

I would give this three and a half stars if I could. I loved the fact that there is no mayo in this, it was very light. I used baby red potatoes and scallions in place of the shallots. Simple and light.

Very good--but you must double the vinaigrette! And I don't peel the potatoes.

This is a great recipe, but what I do differently? I chop the potatoes into cubes first, and then I roast them for about 40 minutes or so, rather than boiling them. It gives the potatoes a wonderful rich flavor, with a great crispy-on-the-outside, soft-on-the-inside texture. Plus, the browning adds some nice color.

This has become my standard potato salad recipe, and it always gets raves. I double the vinaigrette, but never peel the potatoes.

I didn't double the vinaigrette and suffered for it. Very bland. If I make it again I'll follow the advice and double the vinaigrette.

This will continue to be a great side dish for me from here on out. My only variations were to double the dressing using Tarragon Vinegar, and adding chopped parsley and finely chopped celery. We loved it!

Loved this dish! I was distracted and added all the ingredients to the potatoes at once and it STILL turned out great. I doubled the vinaigrette as suggested by others and added parsley for color.

We had left-over baked potatoes so I used them, skin and all. Added some chopped celery and toasted walnuts for colour and texture. Very, very tasty.

Delicious! I followed the advice of the others and doubled the vinaigrette. The salad was very creamy. I also made the salad using red potatoes and served the salad with the skins on. It was great! I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty. As others have said, I would increase the amount of vinaigrette used. I used a tarragon vinegar and added fresh chopped parsley as well.

Followed others' advice and doubled the vinaigrette - seemed to be the right amount of dressing for the potatoes. Guests liked the dish. It was fairly easy to make.

Lovely tasty salad, with the bonus of being low-fat. Suitable for family dinner, or entertaining. My small daughters enjoyed this also.

This is a great lowfat potato salad! Tart, sweet and tasty. I have made it several times and get raves and requests for the recipe every time. I use red new potatoes instead of the fingerling. The key appears to be making it at the last minute and serving while still warm or room temperature - don't chill it once the vinaigrette has been added.

Rating: 4
This is simply fabulous! The only change I'd make is to double the vinaigrette measurements, could even triple and hold some back to add just prior to serving. Great jumping off point too, could add any type of herb/seasoning that you may be in the mood for, super with some cilantro or cumin one day then go with tarragon or rosemary another. Love it!

The potato salad tasted pretty good when I first put it together, but seemed a little dry by the time I got around to serving it. The strong mustard/vinegar taste went well with ham. I love the idea of a low-fat potato salad, but this recipe may need a little tinkering.
