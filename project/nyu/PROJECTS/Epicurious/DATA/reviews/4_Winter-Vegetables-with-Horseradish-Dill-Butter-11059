I have been serving this since the recipe first appeared in 1991 with one or more of the vegetables listed, most often brussel sprouts. I cant begin to count the number of people who have been coverted to brussel sprouts lovers when served this way. My son in law even requested them for his wedding reception which probably is a first in the history of brussel sprouts! What a delcious, colorful and convenient way to serve vegetables to a crowd.

This has become my standard Thanksgiving veggie and it is a crowd pleaser! We love the flavors. I cut down on the potatoes.

Love these, but roast the vegetables to most of the way cooked the day before instead of steaming. Also use way less butter since the roasted vegetables are tossed in olive oil. Due to using only a couple tablespoons of butter, cut back on the vinegar as well so it doesn't overpower (but overall a much healthier version) Reheat the next day when the turkey comes out! and add the sauce at the end.

This was very pretty and tasted fine. It was just nothing to write home about. Did like the veggie combination, just needed more pazazz.

What caught my eye was the B. Sprouts which we dearly love to cook with and eat. I will try this dish on my husband's birthday with some friends to be my critic.

This is very good, easily halved and pretty on the plate. We served with oregano and garlic roast lamb and roquefort potato gratin. Be aware it is very time consuming. We prepared early in the afternoon, steamed vegetables just barely to the point of crisp tender and plunged immediately in an ice water bath. (Watch the turnip sticks or they'll oversteam quickly) Then added the sauce and refrigerated in a crockpot bowl. A couple of hours before serving, warm crockpot (if nothing is happening on low, turn to high). Stir occasionally. Sauce will separate but be okay in the end. The vegetables remained crisp and there was no competition for the oven. We put fresh dill in the sauce as required but added some fresh chopped dill on top for presentation.

Great crowd pleaser! Something for everyone! Coming from an Eastern European background this recipe was a gigantic hit on Thanksgiving with our family, others may not be so inclined. It was relatively easy, and lots of fun to prepare if you have a couple of friends helping you chop, add a bottle of wine to the table and it becomes a party just making the dish. We left out the potatoes because we always serve mashed potatoes on Thanksgiving...we just added more of the other veggies. Excellent the following day and makes a yummy addition to the day after turkey pot pie!

This is an excellent dish for a large group. It's fairly quick to prepare and always a crowd pleaser. It's also easy to double or triple for large parties.

We did not make the full quantity of of vegetables but we made the full amount of sauce. An unintended was to have the sauce in my 'fridge (keeps very well), which I have used for all kinds of veggies -- spectacular for steamed broccoli and dresses up frozen medlies. It has become one of my favorite recipes.

I omitted the potatoes (and cut the sauce in half)and it still made enough for 16 people! A perfect Thanksgiving vegetable, sort of like a warm potato salad even without the potatoes. I cooked the turnips, parsnips and carrots all together in the pressure cooker, and steamed the brussels sprouts separately. Everyone loved it.

I've made this quite a few times, and the butter, vinegar, dill, horseradish sauce is awesome. The only problem is that it makes A TON of veggies, and they take awhile to cook because you really do need to steam them separately in order for them to each cook the right amount. I keep it warm in a large dutch oven.

We loved this recipe. It was easy and very good. I cut back on the butter a bit. But really enjoyed it.

Our Thanksgiving guests loved it. This huge recipe makes quite an impact just by sheer size alone. It's also a colorful presentation & a great alternative. It took lots more time than we had planned - most took at least five minutes more steaming than indicated. There's also a logistical problem with keeping them warm as you work. The oven was filled with a large ham warming at 350 so we couldn't warm them that way. The recipe is so large it needs a huge bowl. Fortunately a friend loaned her largest pasta bowl & we kept them warm in the microwave. We'll probably drop the turnips - they don't contribute a lot of flavor & there's already enough white with the potatoes. It would also be prudent to steam the Brussels sprouts last so they keep as much of their brilliant green as possible. The dill & horseradish butter is wonderful.

A delicious and colorful side dish. I brought this to a Thanksgiving dinner and received rave reviews, even from those who claim to hate brussels sprouts (proving once again that anything's good if it's covered with enough butter!). I omitted the potatoes since there was already lots of starch on the menu, and substituted fresh lemon juice to taste for the vinegar. The dish can be made ahead of time by undercooking the veggies very slightly and reheating them, covered, in the oven before tossing them with the sauce.
