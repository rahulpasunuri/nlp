My husband has made this recipe countless times. It is the best I have ever eaten. It does need to be baked longer than the original recipe calls for. A definite four star recipe.

Haven't tried it yet, but looks great. I didn't have any whipping cream, so I used whole milk. I have the perfect jiggle I was looking for, and I cannot wait until they cool down completely so I can put on the sugar, and eat!!

I've made this at least 3 times, and will keep coming back to it. The Grand Marnier can be subbed for any liqueur you like. I've tried it with both Cointreau and Kahlua. I agree with some other cooks that the cooking time needs to be a little longer, but then oven temps differ. I cook mine for about 35-40 minutes. Lastly, for the brulee part, my boyfriend and I have experimented with brown sugar, white sugar, toasted brown sugar, and ultrafine baker's sugar. We use a torch and our experience has been that the ultrafine baker's sugar is the best by far.

Fabulous! We had a trio of flavored creme brulee desserts at a swanky restaurant and this is much better. It's easy and delicious.

Unbelievably easy and the creamiest Creme Brulee you will ever make. My recommendation along with almost everyone else is bake 45 minutes. 25 which is recommended is not enough time.

SOOO easy and well worth the calories! my husband loves Grand marnier, so this was a perfect, easy, fast, dessert to make for Christmas Day. I recommend putting the hot water in the pan BEFORE putting in the custard ramekins. Then just pour in the custard. Makes it far easier.

Fantastic recipe. I've used the base of this recipe many times already. I tried it with Grand Marnier, Brandy, and lavender infused cream. The Grand Marnier version is great with berries. Quick and easy to make yet very impressive for guests. I didn't think I liked créme brulee until I tried making it myself.

Great recipe though I didnt use Grand Marnier!

Substituted Chambord for Grand Marnier and it was excellent. Bake time seemed right to me. After chilling the custard was smooth and soft but not runny.

Loved it, and so did my guests! I also left it in the oven for 40 minutes, and was happy I did. I used B&B Liqueur instead of Grand Mariner -- very yummy. I suspect you could adjust this to suit your tastes by adding whatever liqueur you love. Re chilling times: we decided to make this at kinda the last minute, so after baking, we only chilled them for about 2 hours. They were still delicious! They were set well and had a lovely texture. We left a few in the fridge overnight to eat the next day, and those were firmer (as brulee is meant to be, I think). But don't despair if you can't chill them very long -- I started the custards when I started the rest of dinner, and it didn't make any substantial difference. (And obviously, you don't need to use the broiler if you've got a kitchen torch, which I prefer for this kind of delicate work.)

I'll probably keep trying different creme brulee recipes. This one was good but not amazing. My dishes only hold a little over 1/2 cup so this recipe made 7 and I baked them for about 30 minutes. Grand Marnier flavor was good. I used white sugar to caramelize on top with a torch right before serving, I think brown would have been way too sweet.

Excellent and can be made ahead

I cooked the brulee for 40 minutes and it was a perfect consistency when served. I checked it at 25, 30 & 35 minutes and it didn't seem quite right(although I've never made one before). Glad I left it the 40 minutes, it got rave reviews!

I have never made Creme Brulee before, but this turned out to be easy and delicious. I used raw sugar (Sugar in the Raw) for the topping and it turned out perfect. My husband raved that it was better than the one we tried at Wolfgang Puck's Restaurant at Disney!

Air dry your brown sugar for a day before use. Will produce a "crunchier" crust.

After reading it didn't set for someone, I was worried. But I figured the gentle set was what to look for and then it'd firm up in the fridge and it did, phew. I thought it was a decent creme brulee, but there are better.

This recipe is great and easy to make!

Creme brulee 'first-timer' and I was very pleased how it turned out. The texture was very smooth and creamy. The only problem I had was melting the brown sugar. I used a cooking torch and like one of the other reviews the brown sugar burned instead of melting. Next time I make this dish I am going to use white sugar instead.

Ok, I've been cooking for 20+ years and have made creme brulee before. But, tonight I made this recipe and it didn't set! after 35 minutes in the oven, I gave up. Maybe the overnight chilling will do the trick. Wish me luck! (In the future, I think I'll stick with my other c.b. recipes that firm up in the oven!)

Easy. Superb. This was my first time making Creme Brulee as well. I received several proposals for marriage during dessert. My stove is a gas stove and while browning brown sugar I wasn't watching closely enough and the brown sugar caught fire (just little flames). Running out of time before the final chilling, I wasn't throwing these things out. I scraped off burned brown sugar and the creme was unharmed so I simply re-sugared and browned again; and still had proposals for marriage!!

This was my first attempt at Creme Brulee. I found the recipe easy to follow. Several of my guests said it was as good as any they had ever had in a restaurant. The only thing I varied from the recipe was to use 1 cup heavy cream and the remainder was regular whipping cream.

Had a dish similar to this is a fine french restaurant this summer. I decided to substitute "orange blossom water" which I purchased from an import store in my neighborhood for the Grand Marnier. It had a most wonderful light orange taste. I also used turbinado sugar on the top. Very delicious! Would serve to company.

I thought this was great - incredibly rich and creamy with a hint of orange. Wouldn't change a thing. Creme brulee is simple, but you need to make sure your ingredients are very fresh, or else your finished product will taste like the inside of your refrigerator!

Simple, but nothing to write home about. I love Grand Mariner and Creme Brulee, but the combination wasn't what I'd hoped. The brown sugar was far too sweet, so perhaps granulated would be better, as suggested in other recipes. Still searching for the perfect Creme Brulee, like the one they serve at "Tony's of St. Louis" (5 Stars/Diamonds; and worth every one).
