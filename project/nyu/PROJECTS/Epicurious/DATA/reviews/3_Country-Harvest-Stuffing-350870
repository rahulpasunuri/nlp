This is close to the way I make dressing (stuffing) all the time. I substitute savory sage sausage for the Italian, omit the garlic and the prunes, and use a chopped Granny Smith apple. For tsahallo1...I also add at least a stick of melted butter, and it is never dry. But I would love to have your Grand Marnier and apricot recipe!

I really liked this recipe! I think it was one of my favorite dishes of the big meal! I ended up not having the time or space to bake it in the oven. So, after I baked the breads (I baked the cornbread the night before- the simple Marie Callendar "add water" kind), I put all the ingredients into a pot and slowly cooked the stuffing over the stove top. It was delicious.

This was DRY, DRY, DRY! I even added an extra cup and a half of broth to the recipe--still came out dry--big disappointment--the only dish that I made that did not get rave reviews! Back to my standby Gran Marnier and Apricot stuffing...
