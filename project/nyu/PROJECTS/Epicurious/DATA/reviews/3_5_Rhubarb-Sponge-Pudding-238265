I added a little vanilla and some apples (didn't have enough rhubarb) and it was fantastic. Easy recipe. Highly recommend.

I was disappointed with this recipe. I utilized the advice to mix the rhubarb with sugar prior to preparation. - The Rhubarb turned out fine. But the cake was very buttery and unexciting. Overall the recipe is too many dishes to clean, for a mediocre outcome. For using rhubarb, I plan to return to the standards of either an oats/granola based cobbler or a true shortcake, with the rhubarb compote composed in a sauce pan separately.

This is a very good, old-fashioned tasting dessert that's extremely flexible. I was short a cup of rhubarb so I made up the difference with an apple. Then I added too much sugar so I topped the rhubarb/apple mixture with a cup of frozen cranberries. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and half a teaspoon of salt to the cake batter and overall, it was delicious! I'm looking forward to trying it again just with rhubarb.

Delicious! Served this with vanilla ice cream, and we had the leftovers for breakfast.

This recipe is almost identical to one that's been handed down in my family for four generations. (We like less sugar in our rhubarb - but the "sponge" part is the same.) A tip - if you toss the rhubarb with the sugar and let it sit for a couple hours, it'll juice (just like strawberries). That way, you can dispense with the water and use far less brown sugar, producing a nicer consistency. Ice cream is a perfect complement!

This is quick, tasty and homey. The cake is very buttery, and it complements the sweet'n'tart fruit on the bottom very well. I added about a quart of sliced strawberries and made 150% of the cake recipe, which came out about right, I think. I also added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the fruit, and I sprinkled about two tablespoons of turbinado sugar on top of the cake for a pretty sparkly effect.

Yum! I added a vanilla bean to the rhubarb (because I think vanilla and rhubarb are a wonderful pair) but I imagine it would still be delicious without it. A tasty, homey recipe! Don't forget the whipped cream :).

This is great! However, my husband is not that fond of rhubarb and I put the juice of 2 oranges with the rhubarb instead of the water and I also put the zest of the 2 oranges with the sponge. This will certainly be a recipe I will make many times from now on. I want to try it with different fruit bases.

Good basic recipe--works well with all kinds of summer fruits like cane berries and stone fruit.

This is one of my new favorite rhubarb recipes. I accidently used 10 T. of milk last time, and it was an improvement. Made the cake more pudding-like.

This is an excellent recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out just right. We love eating it for breakfast. I was worried that it would be too much "pudding" like from its name, but although it is moist, it is more cake like, a little like a buckle cake. We liked it so much that I doubled the recipe the second time I made it. I will certainly make this again, as long as rhubarb and strawberries are in season.

A great-tasting recipe that's no problem to make. Good for spring, since it doesn't have the heaviness that some crisps or crumbles do. I opted for a wooden spoon instead of the electric mixer and I don't think there was any difference. This recipe also lends itself to adding extra layers of flavour: you can replace the water for the rhubarb with brandy, although you might want to add a splash more than 2 tbsp.; add a hint of ginger, in either ground form in the pudding or in stem form in with the rhubarb; and/or sprinkle the top with sugar to give it a bit more texture when it's done. This would also be killer served with strawberry ice cream.
