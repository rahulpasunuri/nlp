Liked this recipe a lot, but in an 8 inch cast iron pan there is no way I could have used 3 c broth. Even with 2 c broth, the pan overflowed onto the oven floor. It would have been too soupy with more broth.

Great recipe with a very different, interesting taste. Unless you have leftover chicken, just double the recipe and put it in a 12" skillet. Use about 1-1/2 times the flour and stock. I stretched one piece of pastry to cover the pan by rolling in between sheets of parchment.

This is an AWESOME recipe! Only a few changes - I doubled the recipe and baked it in two 8x8 inch square baking dishes, as I do not have a cast iron skillet. I used a large Texas 1015 onion, chopped. I thought the mixture was a bit bland, so I added 1 1/2 tsp Penzey's Hot Curry Powder to the mixture before baking. This made the whole dish incredible! Both my casseroles were totally consumed. Will definitely be making this again!

This won't replace my favorite chicken pot pie recipe, but it's a really fantastic, healthier alternative. I subbed thyme for sage, and used chicken thighs. Though I'd use thigh and breast meat next time. Keep an eye on your oven, in my case the crust (pepperidge farm) was deep golden after 10 min/425 + 10 min/375. One last thing: if you treat this as a one-pot dinner, I doubt it would serve 6 people. 3-4 is probably more realistic, because it is less rich than a classic chicken pot pie.

This is a GREAT recipe. I increased the portions by one half to fit a 10" skillet, and then used an entire chicken (to make it more filling for a dieting dad who'd eat too much pastry otherwise!). Normally, I wouldn't review a recipe I've made changes to, but in this case, I'm sure the taste was the same. Served this to my parents and some foodies and they loved it. Delicious and healthy (minus the pastry ; ))

LOVED this recipe ! I used a yellow onion instead of pearl onions. I should have doubled the recipe because my family complained there wasn't enough for a second helping. This will become my new standard for leftover chicken & turkey.

The puff pastry needs to thaw before using it... I don't know why it didn't dawn on me but leaving the filling in the cast iron covered on the stove until the puff pastry thawed did NOT hurt the recipe, it did hurt my kids going to bed time. This is a fantastic recipe. The flavors are so excellent. I don't even like kale but wanted to give it another go and was so pleasantly surprised. Delicious!

Great recipe. Used the meat from a whole rotisserie chicken instead of half.

I made the mistake of fixing this at the end of a busy day and all the prep work seemed a bit much. I also made the mistake of letting the pastry thaw and warm up too much before unfolding it. Rather, trying to unfold it. However I took a rolling pin and although I worked the heck out if and never did get it big enough to cover the pan, I laid the pastry on top and it got high and flaky. It was nevertheless delicious. Even my kale & squash-hating husband liked it.

The recipe is exceptional. I changed it a bit, by using duck confit instead of rotisserie chicken, and rosemary instead of sage. I also made mine in a 18" skillet, so just about doubled everything, and had to press 2 pieces of puff pastry together to cover the top. Finally, I didn't feel that the flour/stock created the creamy bechamel that I find a standard for pot pie, so I added a few tablespoons of condensed cream of chicken soup to the sauce just before putting it in the oven. A little labor intensive, but absolutely amazing results. Kid & budget friendly.

Delicious! I didn't have frozen pearl onions, so I just sauteed one sweet onion, and it turned out great.

Everyone loved this, and the leftovers went quickly. I used leftover smoked chicken, a small bit more of everything, and used a 12 inch pan, everything came out great.

To answer "A Cook", I found them at Whole Foods here in Willowbrook, IL.

Not a review. This is for "A Cook" You can find frozen pearl onions at Trader Joes.

I made this yesterday and it was awesome. I love the idea of making pot pie in the skillet, a great technique. I will use this idea again for other combinations. can't believe I have never thought of or heard of doing this. I used boneless chicken thighs, added to skillet before the kale step(I subbed Swiss chard). Also subbed a sweet potato for the squash and chopped yellow onion instead of the pearls. It was great, I think you could use many combinations of veggies or meats/proteins. Next time I'm going to try tofu. One word of caution, when I checked the crust after 15 minutes it was nearly burnt(Pepperidge Farms brand Puff Pastry Sheets). Maybe my oven runs hot. I covered with foil for the remaining time and it was saved. So, watch your crust!

Where do you find frozen pearl onions? Birdseye no longer sells them. Does the chef have a source and where its located? I've been looking for these myself as boiling and peeling pearl onions is very labor intensive.

I made a vegetarian version of this and it came out really yummy. I roasted butternut squash, parsnips, a head of garlic and a red onion with olive oil and S/P; I added veg. broth in the last 10 minutes. I parboiled brussel sprouts and then sauteed them with a pat of butter with the kale. And I added tofu (marinated for an hour in olive oil, flavorful hotsauce, rice vinegar, garlic and soy sauce, then threw the whole concoction in a pan and fried for a few minutes). I should have added some flour to make the broth thicken. Combined all in a pan and put the puff pastry on top and baked as directed. Not exactly as the recipe ordered, but it was a fabulous veggie feast!

This was easy to make, but it took about 2.5 hours -- not my definition of "quick". I doubled the recipe for my 12" cast iron skillet, except for using only 3.5 cups of stock and about 1/3 cup of flour, rather than doubling those. I also used a Pillsbury pie crust instead of puff pastry, and it fit perfectly in my skillet. Next time I will try adding a half-cup of white wine in place of some of the stock, and I will also add some fresh thyme just before baking.

Use less kale, more chicken, frozen corn and peas and this will be a killer recipe.

This was just excellent, and fairly quick and easy. Last fall I made the pot pie recipe from bon appetit (oct 2011) that was truly incredible, but took a full day of work. I loved this one because it was an easy evening meal. I used the homemade crust from the previous recipe just because it was so good. Other than that I followed the directions pretty closely. My only tip is to use a bigger skillet. I guess you could use an 8-in if it was really deep, but I ended up using a standard 10 1/2 inch cast iron and it worked perfectly. Try whatever will fit.
