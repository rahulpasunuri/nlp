Very good. Easy. w/o the eggs, the asparagus makes a nice side dish. It was a hit at a potluck.

I though this was good, but not delicious. Not terribly creative but easy enought that I would make again.

Really great New Year's day brunch with some bloody mary's. I increased the eggs to 2 per person. Perhaps could have used something a bit more substantial to fill up everyone but tasty nonetheless.

I made this recipe as a quick weeknight supper for 2 (I would increase the portions for more servings), along with baguette and some fresh melon for dessert. It was simple and tasty.

this recipe calls for more parmesan than you really need, you could reduce the amount and still get a great flavor. its not entirely clear why poached eggs are an ingredient in this dish because they dont really contribute to the overall taste. but its a good way to include some protein.

I just made this entree for my Easter Brunch. Wonderful! It took a bit of juggling because all the items tend to be finished at the same time, but I would definitely make it again. I also added a hollandaise sauce that topped it all off.

So for those nights when you want something tasty, but don't want something complicated, here's your recipe. Roasted asparagus is delicious. Parmesan is delicious. Prosciutto is more than delicious. Poached eggs are delicious. Put them all together and you've got a delicious and quick meal good enough for guests. So invite some over now...

I was planning leftovers when I sat down a few minutes before dinner, was leafing through the magazine and saw this recipe. All ingredients on hand, so....It was really delicious. Made it as written except lazy dh grated the parmesan instead of shaving. Just be careful salting the asparagus as the parm and prosciutto are already salty. Served with a salad and garlic bread it was a nice quick supper but would make a wonderful brunch dish.

Very easy to make. Uses good, simple ingredients. Typical of the Italian style of cuisine.
