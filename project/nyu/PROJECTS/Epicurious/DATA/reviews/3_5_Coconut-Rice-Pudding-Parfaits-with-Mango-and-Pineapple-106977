Very tasty! Recipe is flexible too. I used a whole can of coconut milk and left out the whipping cream, cut back the sugar, added a couple of tablespoons of minced crystalized ginger and vanilla pod innards. I have never been a fan of rice pudding but this recipe has changed my mind!

Joy, Joy ! The crumble is a must. I broke off pieces about the size of a quarter, placed them on the bottom and placed more on the top. Left over parfaits were as good several days later, with the crumble maintaining the crisp. This is a keeper. I served this at a womens conference recently. Medium grain rice worked perfectly. It wasn't too sweet. It was PERFECT. With peaches in season, I also added a slice of fresh peach on each parfait. I layered the fruit. The pudding sat on top, not moving which made a beautiful presentation. I brought 3 left over parfaits home, and my brother ate every one of them, saying " Man ! what did the ladies say? I bet they loved this" It was awesome. I followed a recipe exactly. I WILL be making this again.

This was definitely worth it. I really liked being able to do most of it the day ahead and just assemble it before serving. The rice pudding alone was excellent but in combination with the macaroon and fruit--A-mazing.

Absolutely delicious! My kitchen smells fabulous too. I cut the sugar by half, used Coco Loco, 3 farm fresh eggs and I skipped the cornstarch. I do think a rice cooker would be a little less stressful. Definitely use a large saucepan, not medium. This came out yellow in color because the eggs are so good. Ripe cold mango on the side really adds to this. I didn't even make the crumble. Maybe next time.

This was delicious and easy to make. I made some modifications based on what I had available. First, I used 2 cups coconut milk and no cream. Second, I halved the sugar--it was sweet enough with only about 3/4 cup sugar. Third, I had about 1.5 cups of pre-cooked brown long grain rice, which I added after mixing the egg and cream together so that it would heat up in the final boiling phase. Finally, I added about 1 heaping tablespoon of fresh sliced ginger with the milk and coconut cream in the first boil. This added a great flavor, though it was very subtle and could probably have used more ginger. The crumble topping is not necessary--sliced almonds with mango made a fantastic combination.

Delicious rice pudding. I used arborio rice instead of basmati and it was awesome. My husband is not a pineapple/mango fan so I topped the rice pudding with mixed berries & maple syrup (simmered then refrigerated) and he loved it!

Wonderful, I made it as a last minute brunch addition. I only made the pudding (no topping) using rice left over from dinner the night before. I used a whole can of coconut milk and made up the rest of the liquid with whipping cream and simply mixed in bananas, pear, mandarin oranges and the zest and juice of one lime as they were on hand. Everybody loved it and will definitely make again and am excited to try the topping.

I liked the flavor, but thought it was too much trouble. I would use short grain rice next time because the basmati was a little too mushy. We didn't like the crumbles...too sweet, but they were great sprinkled on our cerel, so not wasted. I used coco lopez instead of coconut milk, and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup total. Will make it again.

I had this recipe at a friend's house, I loved it!!, I will prepare it at home, I can't wait to make it. The portions do come more though, I would say, like for 8 to 10 people

Great dessert. I made this for a luncheon for 10 guests and everyone liked it. Next time I will not double the recipe - a single batch easily served 10. I did not find it any more time consuming than many desserts that I make. One thing that was a bit off - I doubled the topping and found it too salty - either I mismeasured or the recipe did not translate well in terms of doubling.

Give me cinnamon and raisins anytime. I'm all for trying new things but this is much too time-consuming for what it's good. A bit too gooey for my taste. All that cornstarch I suppose.

Delicious and easy to make, although it does take some time. Made this for a Thai dinner party last night. The great thing about it is that you can do everything in advance and just assemble the parfaits while guests are relaxing after dinner. I didn't have any shredded coconut (what's the difference between flaked and shredded?), so I used flaked and it was fine. Used nonfat milk--no problems there. My pudding was pretty solid so I did add the whipping cream and it made it a little creamier and looser--I wouldn't leave it out. The crumble was terrific--my husband made the main course last night and kept nibbling on the crumble! Will definitely make this again.

My guests were a little cautious of this dish at first glance (a rice pudding with fruit?--they'd never seen something like this!), but really loved it after they tried it! They had seconds and some had thirds, and many requested the recipe. I must say that this took a while to make, though.

I will start by saying that the finished product was very tasty and presented well. However, this was not easy and quick to make. I found it time consuming. There are many other dessert recipes I would rather make then to do this one again. While to be expected from a rice based dessert, I found this to be very heavy. Maybe nice served on its own, but not after a meal.

I just finished making the rice pudding part and boy is it tasty. This is a quick and easy recipe and big on taste. I would add less sugar next time, especially if the shredded coconut you use has sugar added. I did not add the additional whipping cream as I used fat free half and half instead of whole milk so the texture was already quite creamy. The basmati rice turned out perfectly light and fluffy when cooked in my rice cooker. This saves on time as you can prepare the rest of the ingredients while the rice is cooking without having to stir or watch the rice. Recipe says to use a medium saucepan - use a large saucepan or a pot - as medium saucepan is not big enough when you add the rice into the pudding ingredients. This makes much more than 6 servings - I'd say it made about 10.

fabulous! I'm a rice pudding lover, and also a cooking teacher. This is a great recipe, and the pudding turns out very creamy. The coconut crumble is outstanding! I used 3/4 butter and 1/4 oil, and it turned out so good I cut squares out of it, to use as thin shortbread cookies! The pudding is great cold, but I'm a big fan of warm rice pudding (especially if it's winter time!). Honestly, I can't think of any reason someone could come up with a 'disaster-recipe'. Maybe, just maybe, put a little more passion in the recipes you make, and also please keep an open mind as far as slightly 'unusual' flavors!

I don't know what those last few people did wrong, I thought this was delicious!! Not for those who don't love coconut! I just made the pudding part, not the topping. Very rich, but compared to a dessert like cheesecake or chocolate cake, it is pretty light. I didn't add the cream after it cooled (I couldn't resist a taste while it was still hot), it tasted great without more added fat. This is comparable to a very tasty coconut cream pie filling but with rice in it. Definitely a keeper!

This pudding is so amazing! I made this for my boyfriend and he later became my husband....I continue to make this for him and he falls in love with me all over again...I cannot say enough.

I agree with the reviewer from Hawaii that the pudding was too sweet and too heavy. My family are rice pudding and coconut lovers but this just didn't do a whole lot for any of them. The crumble that goes on top is really yummy though! I bet it would be good over some fresh fruit with a little cream.

Am I crazy or does this recipe call for whipping cream but never uses it?

This was definately good, but it was just too sweet and heavy for me. I made it for Christmas and since we are in Hawaii, everything had an island flavor to it so this fit the bill perfectly, but for general rice pudding purposes, I want something a little lighter. My guest all loved it, and I sent plenty home for all the toddlers.

I didn't actually make this recipe but I tasted it and it is delicious! I came here to get the recipe. There is something about the combination of the fruit with the rice pudding and the crumble on top that go together so nicely. We had a spicy Thai curry fish soup for dinner and this was a perfect ending.

Wonderful dessert! Compared to so many heavy desserts out there, this one is nice and light, but sacrificing none of the flavor. I made this for a dinner party because I knew that the app, sald, and dinner would be pretty filling - and it was. But, there was not one spoonful of this dessert left in a wineglass. Gorgeous presentation and flavor combination. Have some fun with the cookie part, and cut out long, thin triangles to stick in the very top layer of the parfait. What a presentation!!

I made this for a dinner party and it was a big hit. I caught my husband sneaking extras. This is outstanding! Makes a great presentation in large crystal water glasses.
