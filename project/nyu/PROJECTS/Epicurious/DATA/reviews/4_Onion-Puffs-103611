Made these along with Epicurious's parmesan-blue cheese toasts with green onions and roasted yellow pepper bruschetta for a party. These were by far the easiest and the BEST! Everyone ate them up and asked for more. These will be a staple of mine at parties forever!

I puréed a large Vidalia onion in the food processor, turned it down to low speed and added 2 tablespoons of hot English mustard, about a cup of mayo., a cup of shredded parmesan, 1/2 cup of shredded aged cheddar, a little salt and lots of freshly ground black pepper. Served it on rye rounds...YUM! I will make this again for sure.

You can't beat these for simplicity and flavour. I blitzed the onion, added the suggested parmesean, mayo and was good to go. Yummy!

Love this easy recipe. I mix the onion, mayo, parmesan (fresly grated) and parsley together, spread it on and broil. Never any left.

Excellent no-fuss hors d'oeuvre! I complied the "best of" previous reviewers comments and did the following: used cocktail-sized pumpernickel and sourdough breads, toasted them lightly, then combined chopped onion, mayo and parmesan and spread this on the little toasts, then broiled them. This saved several steps from the original recipe and provides a happy outcome! Very good recipe, will become a staple in my hors d'oeuvres repertoire.

This has been in my family for years--It is an excellent standby. Keep cocktail rye in freezer for spontaneous dinners!

I, too, have been making this forever. My mother calls it "Irish Pizza" and we had it at every party and holiday. I use cocktail pumpernickel and top with parmesan. I introduced my in-laws to it a few years ago and now they specifically request it when they visit. Delicious and destined to remain a family tradition.

I've been making this forever, but I use cocktail rye, chop the onions, and put a thin slice of havarti with caraway on top. Also good with fontina.

This is major return on investment. I chopped the onion (vidalia) quite fine and mixed it with the Hellman's mayo and fresh grated asiago instead of parmesan. I piled it on fresh baguette and broiled without toasting first. It was fantastic! Everybody raved. Sooooo easy.

I gave this four forks because it is incredibly good for the small amount of effort required. I also added parmesan and loved it. Next time I might mince the onion and add the cheese to the mayo to make it easier to spread.

I gave this recipe four forks because it's so fast, easy, inexpensive, elegant looking and utterly delicious -- my favorite kind of recipe! I made the puffs (using a Vidalia onion) three different ways: with plain mayo; with a little mustard mixed into the mayo; and, per the previous reviewer's suggestion, with parmesan mixed with the mayo. They were all scrumptious, but the parmesan version won hands down; one with mustard took second place. I made them on whole slices of bread for supper, to go alongside soup. Can't wait to make them in little circles as nibbles with drinks.

My mother has been using this recipe for years, but she has always mixed parmesan cheese in with the mayonnaise. It provides more flavor and color when broiled. Also works well with cocktail bread or Triscuits. Simple and easy, YUM.
