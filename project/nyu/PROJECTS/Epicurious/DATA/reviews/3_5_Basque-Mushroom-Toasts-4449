Fabulous, easy and 'applaud worthy,' from our guests! I reduce the broth (and use 50/50 beef/chicken), add a bit more Sherry (a good Spanish 'Fino') and red pepper flakes. Then, I spoon it onto fresh, crisp, oven baked, French bread rounds: Slice a French bread baguette into 1/4" slices; spray w/a good olive oil spritzer on BOTH sides and bake on a cookie sheet, in a pre-heated oven for 15-20 min or so, at about 375-400 F. Watch it carefully, so it browns and doesn't burn. Then, rub all surfaces w/a large, freshly cut garlic clove, cut side down... and voila. Delicious!!

I love these and make them often for quick appetizers. Depending on my audience, I either serve the mushrooms on large croutons on top of a green salad, or on small french baguette toast rounds as stand alone hors d'oeuvres. Either way they are usually a hit. The only modification i make is adding a bit less beef broth and a bit more sherry, and substituting crushed red pepper flakes for the fried chile.

Good not great ... I agree with the cook who said it seemed to be missing something. I will try this again without the flour, simply because I think it masks the flavor of the fresh mushrooms and parsley ... although I guess at that point it ceases to be the same recipe. A lot of the appeal is in the ease of ingredients and preparation, it looks like more work than it is and will likely impress your guests.

I really like this recipe for special occasions. I grate a little parmesan (or other sharp) cheese on top of the mixture once I have plated it. My only suggestion is that this must be served hot.

I also do this on sliced baguette rounds for parties. It's always a big hit. I get a lot of requests for it.

I thought this was ok, but it seemed to be missing something.

I made this dish for a dinner party and it was a hit. The only real change I made was that I used a French baguette and spooned about a tablespoon of the mushroom mixture on each one. It made about 15 toasts and worked well as an appetizer or tapas (it was a Spanish dinner). I will definitely make it again.

Sounds potentially wonderful, but there are no instructions on my screen
