Like other reviewers, I pureed the berries with the water. I also doubled the recipe since I had the berries. It makes a heck of a lot of caramel! I might make truffles and use the caramel as a filling because there is so much I need to be able to store it! Next time I make it I'll halve the recipe because even halved it would provide enough for a topping for a dinner party's worth of guests.

Made this last night in prep for dinner party this weekend. The flavor is good, but I think it might be too thin.Fresh cranberries didn't want to puree by themselves, so I added som orange juice and reduced the water. I am sure it will thicken with chilling, but I want to serve it warm over cranberry walnut bread pudding so hope it is not too thin with reheating.

I pureed the cramberries with the water then added them once the sugar was caramelized. All went well.
