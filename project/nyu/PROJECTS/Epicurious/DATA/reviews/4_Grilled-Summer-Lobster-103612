QUESTION PLEASE: what is the Salmon in the recipe for? Am I blind or what? I do not see where it is to be used...

Phenomenal recipe! I make this every year for my annual grilled lobster party and even people who aren't crazy about lobsters, love it! You should really kill them live if you can handle it. It tastes soooo much better than boiling them first. A great website to follow for the procedure is http://www.cooking-lobster.com/index.html

I made this with the lime sauce only. I added alot more limes then the recipe called for - until I could appreciate the taste. We served it at a dinner party - and it was a great hit!!!

I used the lime oil to baste the lobster on the grill, sea salt and pepper. I used the rest to dip as suggested. A wonderful change, bursting with flavour and nice heat.

This was very nice.

The Garlic-Lime-Cilantro dip is best. The Onion is too bland. I used the Garlic oil as a baste for the grilling.

I agree that chopping up live lobsters can be a real appetite killer. Not pre-boiling them, however, adds a wonderful fresh flavor. The solution: "pith" them (for those of you who don't remember live frog disection from high school). Take a large chef's knife, place it about a 1/2 inch behind the eyes and give a good wack with the palm of your hand. You're basically severing the spinal cord; the lobster stops squirming, can't feel anything, and you can chop it up without be creeped out.

Very beautiful presentation and FABULOUS flavor. This is my NEW favorite lobster recipe. Try it...you won't be disappointed. We served it at our backyard BBQ and swim party for 15 people. We split the lobster tails in half and served it along side the Coconut-Lime Shrimp with Peanut Sauce, also found here on Epicurious. It was a perfect combination.

Very easy and very good. I made four lobsters as we were two couples and the same amount for the sauces which proved to be enough. I broiled the lobster halves instead of grilling them (it was cold outside!). Everybody loved it.

The recipe is fantastic and the lobster tasted delicious. I will absolutely make it again! However, I purchased a female lobster and had to refer to another cookbook to know what color the roe should turn when it is fully cooked, as this was not mentioned in the recipe.
