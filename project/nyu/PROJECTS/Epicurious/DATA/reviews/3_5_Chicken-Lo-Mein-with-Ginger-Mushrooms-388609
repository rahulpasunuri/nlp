better than takeout.

I always make a new recipe exactly as is. I found the quantities alarming (3 cups sliced Napa cabbage?!) but it turned out delicious. Even the teenager who doesn't like anything cooked in a wok volunteered that it was tasty. I will increase the two peppers next time for even more zip. ChefB: 5 Yums!

I found it a bit disappointing. I followed the recipe exactly as written, other than the addition of a diced carrot. I felt that it was bland, and not enough sauce for the recipe. I will try again to see if I missed something, and will double the sauce.

This was a perfect throw-together recipe. I had to make a number of substitutions, but only to the larger things - regular noodles, different veges. But I followed the recipe exactly for the spices, sauce, and method. Very simple, quick and DELICIOUS. The comment was even made during dinner that we're done ordering out for lo mein... it's just as easy and much more flavorful to make this!!

A fantastic weeknight recipe with pantry items! I only had dried chow mein noodles, so I used those. Also I added one grated carrot and a little hoisin at the end. I know, not traditional, but very good.
