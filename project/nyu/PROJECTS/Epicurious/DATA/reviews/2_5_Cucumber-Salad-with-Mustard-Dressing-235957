This was okay, I added more mustard than was called for but after sitting overnight, there was little mustard flavor. The dressing was more watery than I had hoped for. Will try a different recipe next time.

This recipe is a good base to work from. I followed the recipe exactly (aside from using regular yogurt) however, it seems to be missing something. I will continue to experiement with this one.
