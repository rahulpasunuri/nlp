I make this or a variation every summer. I added about a tablespoon of lemon zest to the oil while cooking, then poured it over heirloom tomatoes we grew. It was simple and delicious.

Adding a little fresh basil or cilantro really improves this otherwise bland dish. I agree there really is a difference in the taste of heirloom, home grown tomatoes!
