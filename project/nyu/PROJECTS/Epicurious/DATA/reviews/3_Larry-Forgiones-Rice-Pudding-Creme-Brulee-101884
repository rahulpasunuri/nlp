I made the recipe that the cook from San Antonio del Mar posted. I give it four stars. It had a wonderfully creamy texture.

It does take a long time to cook. As far as the Brulee goes : I saw the secret on tv. Use brown sugar. Let it dry for several hours. (Spread it on a pan) Then put it through a sieve and sprinkle on top and broil. Watch it carefully and turn it as the broiler might not heat evenly

Well I didn't use the above recipe, I used the one the cook from San Antonio supplied and it was fabulous! So creamy and delicious. I made half of it as the brulee and just left the rest as it! It was gone with in a day!

Well, first of all, the recipe is WAY off. A rice pudding is correctly made like this: Cook 1 cup of rice, covered over medium heat, in 3 cups of water with a stick of cinnamon and some lemon zest until the water is almost evaporated. Add 4 cups of milk, into which one egg has been beaten and 3/4 cup (max!) of sugar, less if you don't like your rice pudding very sweet. Stir over medium low heat for about 45 minutes. When the custard has thickened to the consistency of a thick gravy, add 1 tsp of vanilla and if desired, 1/2 cup of raisins soaked in liquer (I use amaretto), then drained. Allow the rice to cool a bit before spooning into the ramekins. I let it actually chill if I'm going to make creme brulee from it. You'll need at least 3 TB of sugar on top of each ramekin & preferably a torch to carmelize the sugar. Regarding the review on 3/6, there's another one with the same type of foul language on another recipe, supposedly from Arkansas. Someone is playing a nasty trick on some unwitting victim.

Instead of using sugar on top, I put meringue on top and it was great......

This was not worth time it took to make. I agree with other cooks who recommend halving the sugar. Also, the cook time of 40-50 minutes was way off. I cooked it about 4 times that long. Nice texture and taste, but I was unable to achieve the brulee effect. Some guidance about how much sugar to put on top and how long to broil would have been helpful.

I cooked it slowly as recommended and though it took hours, way longer than the recipe said, eventually all the liquid was absorbed and the pudding was very creamy. I cut way back on the sugar and used only 1/4 cup and it was plenty sweet enough for everyone. It was quite good though not unusual.

VERY GOOD TASTING JUST NEXT TIME i MAKE IT i MAY CUT DOWN ON THE SUGAR

Too sweet! Next time I make it (if I make it again) I'll certainly use less sugar and no cinnamon. The cinnamon taste is too strong. This pudding is like cooked rice with sweetened condensed milk poured over it.

Yum! I followed the other suggestions here- decreased sugar quite a bit. Also, increased the amount of vanilla- that really makes this dish. I did cover and stir the rice while cooking. I was unable to truly brulee the dish due to my old-fashioned broiler, but it was amazing as just rice pudding. Do cook slowly as others recommend.

I want to make this dish and have a question: Do you cover and/or stir the rice? I've seen rice pudding you cover, and rice pudding you stir, but not any that just sit uncovered for about an hour.

Milwaukee's right: cook it slowly and the rice will absorb all the liquid. I used all the milk and two split vanilla beans; the end result was a luscious, intense texture and flavor. A little too sweet for me too, though.

Haven't made it yet, but certainly will: as rice pudding and creme brulee are both favorites. Just a note to all those with problems (or who changed the recipe). To make really good rice pudding, you don't follow the traditional 2:1 ratio for rice! Use the full amount of milk, and cook very slowly (for a long time) until the rice absorbs it all. Trust me, it will, I've always made my mom's rice pudding this way! To the cook who says it was too runny, you may not have let the rice absorb all the milk. (Try rum soaked-or just plain-raisins in the pudding...)

I used 2 3/4 cups milk like suggested and had to add more and more. I ran out of milk after a quart and added some heavy cream. The taste was very good. I had my husband take it to work and they all raved about it. So I will try it again. Also I think I started out cooking it on too high a heat.

I halved the recipe and used 4 cups milk to 1/2 plus 1/8 cup rice (5/8ths total) and it turned out just perfect. I think I would decrease the amount of sugar next time as well, but overall, I thought it was wonderful!

Make this dish with less liquid. Knowing that the ratio of liquid to rice is about double but wanting a creamy texture I used about 2 3/4 cups milk instead of 2 quarts. And I added a dash of cinnamon.

Yup, I agree--too runny. But good flavor. I would probably cut down on the sugar some; too sweet for my taste! Also, have to be careful not to heat the milk up too fast or it will scald to the bottom of the pan.

The flavor was good, but it was much too runny!!!
