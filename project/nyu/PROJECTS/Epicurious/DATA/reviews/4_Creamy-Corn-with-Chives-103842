Really delicious with fresh, summer corn. Used a bunt pan to cut the corn from the cob, which makes everything so easy. It's really important to scrape all that milky starch out too. Mine was thick at first, but it's easy to modulate with more/less water. I also did not strain the pureed corn. We served this under scallops.

This is an outstanding side dish-wonderful flavors, and always well received by guests. Love the deceptively creamy taste.

We loved this. This dish has excellent flavor and tastes like more than the sum of the parts. The recipe says it serves four, but we felt it only served two. Also, this wasn't as thick as I thought it would be so I served it in bowls rather than on the plate.

If you have fresh corn, cornstarch will not be needed. Just cut the kernels off as close as possible to the cob. It's thick enough on its own.

I wanted a little extra color in the dish so I sauteed chopped red pepper with the onions. Absolutely delicious!

This was so good! I used five ears of corn (on sale), no sugar, a half-teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of cornstarch and it came out perfectly. And I also didn't strain the corn, the crunchy bits and scrummy texture of the corn made the dish even better. And it's so easy to make! YUM! Into the recipe box it goes.

Make sure you get the freshest sweetest corn available. It makes a huge difference in the taste. I've made this dish several times for dinner & all my guests rave about it. NOTE: once I forgot to use unsalted butter and the dish turned out too salty. Make sure you use unsalted butter and just taste it before you add any more salt. Because the corn I purchase is naturally sweet, I've never had to add any sugar to this dish. I highly recommend this as a great side dish!

I thought this was delicious, but it was a little too salty for my taste. Will definitely make it again with less salt. I did not miss the cream at all which makes this recipe all the better.

This recipe was great. It was bursting with fresh corn flavor. I Puréed the corn as instructed, but didn't strain out the solids. The texture was perfect. I'll definitely make this again.

It took me longer than the 30 minutes, but it was very good. It was better when first made than refrigerated and used later. I'll continue to make it as long as I have freash corn.

If you cut half of the kernal off of the cob as opposed to the whole kernal and then scrape the cob, you can eliminate the pureeing and straining while getting essentially the same result. Overall this is a delicious recipe.
