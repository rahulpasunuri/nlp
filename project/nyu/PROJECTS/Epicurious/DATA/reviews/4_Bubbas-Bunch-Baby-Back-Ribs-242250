The rub was good and took other reviewers tip and did not use sauce. The ribs definitely needed the sauce also but that just a matter of preference. we sprayed the ribs every 20 minutes with apple juice (suggestion of a master rib griller in our neighborhood )

Tried this over Labor Day Weekend and it was the best ribs we had ever had! We love the rub and did not even need any barbecue sauce. They were so good that I think I will head to the store now to buy more ribs for tonight!
