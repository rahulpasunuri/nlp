I substituted more parsnips for the turnip (which I forgot to put on my grocery list) and yams for the carrots (I don't care for pureed carrots). It was wonderful and no one seemed to think there was too much butter.

I made this last year of Thanksgiving and my family LOVED it. I'm definitely making it again this year. It IS very rich, but it's a holiday, so everyone ate it. Even my picky sister and mother who never eats anything. We always have mashed carrots, turnips and potatoes, but this is a more elegant, complex way to make them. I loved the addition of parsnips.

This recipe has been a staple in my recipe box since it was first published. I love that it can be made ahead and even leftovers reheat well. I agree that the amount of butter can be reduced.

This is a colorful and delicious. I agree with those who would cut back on the butter. Also I think one could vary the proportions of the different kinds of vegetables without harming the recipe. I for one would use more turnip.

I have made this two years now for Thanksgiving dinner and we love it. I have been asked for the recipe a number of times. The only gripe I get is from my husband, who prefers to bite into something, and an uncle who says its a perfectly good way to ruin potatoes. But what do they know?

My husband -- a transplanted Yankee -- made this dish for Thanksgiving a few years ago. It was pretty labor-intensive, and his marble technique needed work, but the taste was outstanding (the taste probably deserves three forks). Family members still talk about this, and we'll probably make it again for this holiday.

Just like the prior reviewer - I have been making this recipe since it was published in Bon Appetit and love it! I have found that I can use canned pears for simplicity. And, I've reduced the amount of butter. I look forward to trying the suggestion of substituting evaporate skim milk for the cream.

Not only does this recipe have great flavor it has a unique presentation. I will make this again for guests. To lighten up the reicpe, I reduced the butter to about half and substituted evaporated skim milk for the cream.

This recipe takes the lowly root vegetables to a heavenly status. Velvety, and a beautiful color, it was perfect for Thanksgiving.
