After reading the reviews, I didn't bake these exactly according to the recipe. I increased the whole wheat flour to 1 cup, used a whole can of pumpkin rather than measuring out 1 1/4 cup, and substituted buttermilk for the milk, reducing it to 1/4 cup. I also used chocolate chips instead of nuts and seeds, since that's what I had. The muffins turned out very tender, but not at all custard-y or undercooked, and the flavor was very good, though I might add more ginger next time. This will be my go-to pumpkin muffin recipe.

I don't know what everyone is talking about! I always cook these muffins exactly according to the recipe, and they turn out perfect every time. The only time they came out flat and gooey was when I accidentally left out the baking powder. Whenever I bring these to a holiday party or serve them to guests I get rave reviews.

Also, don't bake the muffins in paper, as they stick, and you'll lose half the muffin, or end up eating paper. Use silicon liners or pans, or try greasing the pan before dividing up the dough.

After reading through the comments on a custardy, doughy muffin, and suggestions for a better ratio of wet to dry ingredients, I experimented with ingredient quantities to obtain a result that I think ressembles a more standard textured muffin: 2 1/2 c. all purpose flour 1/3 c. sugar 1/4 c. brown sugar 2 1/2 tsp. baking powder 1 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon 1/4 c. ground cloves 1/2 tsp. salt 1 c. pumpkin puree(I use homemade) 1/2 c. milk 2 eggs 1/4 c. vegetable oil 1/2 tsp. ground ginger I also added 1 c. chocolate chips, as I didn't have any nuts on hand to use in the recipe. These quantities result in a good thick batter, and tender muffins which are not too dense, nor too custardy.

I too found that this recipe came out a bit custardy as well. I don't think that it was an error in the cook time because they were nice and brown and ever so slightly crusty on the outside. I simply think that this is an issue of how much liquid goes into this recipe. 2 eggs at 96% water, 1 cup milk which is mostly water, pumpkin which is mostly water, and I didn't even use the oil. The gas gaps are there in there in the muffin when it bakes, but it flattens down like a pop over when its done cooling. (Popovers are mostly water too like this batter and are leavened by the production of steam alone there is no baking powder.)

I substituted 1/2 a cup of canola oil for the butter and used the whole can of pumpkin and my muffins were kind of custardy also.Thought it was due to my substitutions. However after reading other reviews, probably not. I was looking for a dense rich muffin and this was definitely not it. Although my son and husband werent complaining while they ate them. I did cook them for approx 10 minutes longer to firm them up. I might try it again with a bit more flour and sugar to compensate for the xtra pumpkin. I really dont like to waste and it did have a nice pumpkin flavor.

These muffins tasted good after I doubled the amount of spices. I also added PP spice for an extra kick. I didn't have enough fresh ginger so I supplemented with 1 tsp powdered...probably should have gone w/ 1/2 tsp instead. I used fresh sugar pumpkin that I'd pureed and actually ended up having to put half a cup extra in to get that pumpkin flavor. I had the same problem many of these cooks did--my muffins remained mushy on the inside and they seemed fallen on the top. I think I'd add even more flour--I used spelt in place of wheat, wonder if that made any difference--and definitely more baking powder. Tasted good but didn't look or feel so good. I want to make this recipe one more time to see if I can work out the kinks. Will re-post w/ results.

This recipe is wonderful -- but I'm glad that I read the reviews first. I added a quarter cup more whole wheat flour, used real ginger and a bit more powder ginger, added a sprinkle more cinnamon and clove -- and cooked it at 370 (I also have a HOT oven). Also, I used real pumpkin scraped from the inside of the pumpkins my boys carved. They were happy to be part of the process and they ate them up fast! They were soft in the middle, but not mushy and inedible. I made mini and regular sized muffins -- the minis were better with regard to consistency.

These were excellent. I cooked them for the requisite 20 minutes and they were a little custardy, but not mushy. I used foil cupcake liners for the large muffins and those worked great. The muffins fell right out. I had some extra batter. I also made some mini-muffins with paper muffin liners. The small ones stuck to the liners. So, foil works well but don't use paper. I did not use the pumpkin seeds in the muffins and I just sprinkled the nuts over the top, which worked great. When I make it again, I think I'd triple the fresh ginger. I'm going to use fresh, frozen ginger because it's much easier to grate. I may drop down the liquids just a little to make them a little less moist.

Hi, As others have noted, the outcome of this recipe was a tray of muffins that were gooey and undone in the middle and hard on the outside.

I've been making this in mini-muffin pans for all of the holiday pot-lucks and dinners for years. People LOVE them.

I made these exactly according to the recipe (even triple-checked the amount of pumpkin I used), but they didn't really rise and ended up very custard-like in the middle. The flavor was great, but the texture was very un-muffinlike. Don't know that I would make these again, so my search for great pumpkin muffins continues.

The muffins came out moist and evenly spiced. They were simple to make and were a crowd pleaser at my house. I did substitute powdered ginger for fresh and which worked out well.

i wonder if people have had trouble because they used a whole can of pumpkin which is 1/2 cup too much...easy mistake! i liked this recipe because it had whole wheat flour in it but of course as soon as i started making it i realized i was out of WW flour. so, with the help of my two year old we made it- modifications include both accidental (unspecified quantity of dumped cloves) and deliberate (dried ginger instead of fresh, salted butter and the addition of currents). these tested done at less than 20 minutes (clean toothpick) but having read the other reviews i left them in the full amount of time and at 25 minutes they had started to pull away from the edges of the muffin tins. they rose nicely, hard to tell when they are golden brown because of their pumpkin color. the added currents make little sweet bursts in my mouth (yum) but overall these muffins are nicely not too sweet. i think next time i would add a little more salt (i even used salted butter) which might bring out more of the flavors. a little hard to judge since this batch is over clovenated.

The flavor of these guys was very nice but I couldn't get them to rise very much or, to cook all the way through. I put them back in the oven for an extra 10 minutes but they were still just like pumpkin pie in the middle. It was very dissapointing for a recipe with so many lovely goodies inside. I didn't serve them to my guests for Thanksgiving but because they were still so tasty, I did snack on some myself. I won't do this recipe again. The batter needed perhaps less pumpkin and more of a flour base so that the muffins could become light and fluffy. (and cooked through)

Excellent recipe, just what I was looking for. Some of the negative reviews mentioned burnt outside/uncooked insides. They probably had too much heat. For example I know my oven runs very hot, so I adjusted it down 50 degrees. I made a couple other changes: I increased the spices, since I wanted a little more punch. I substituted condensed milk for the whole milk. I left out the seeds and nuts. I used powdered ginger since I don't have fresh. I just made one batch for a test run, and am about to start the second. Yum!

I made this with a bit less sugar, skim milk, and no seeds or nuts. It was delightful! Like eating a light, fluffy pumpkin pie muffin. I can see me making these often. I don't know why the other reviews are negative. Misplaced expectations I guess.

Completely forgot to add the butter, but everyone at our Thanksgiving gathering loved them nonetheless!

I had a very difficult time getting these to cook all the way through without burning on the outside. I made two separate attempts and still won't have any pumpkin muffins in the Thanksgiving bread basket. I see that others had similar troubles and I wish I had read these reviews first! The taste is nice, the pepitas a lovely touch, but pick another recipe and save yourself the aggravation.

Bland and tasteless. Couldn't taste the pumpkin or even detect the ginger. Disappointing recipe considering I've been to the bakery this recipe originated from.

Delicious, very moist and tasty!

Needed more sugar/sweetener. Couldn't taste as much pumpkin as I would like. I'd probably try a different recipe rather than trying to manipulate this one.

I baked it for the time mentioned in the recipe and it was still too moist and undercooked. Had to throw it back in the over for 10 minutes longer! OK taste, but I've had much better pumpkin muffins before. The pumkin seeds added an interesting touch to it. I would use a different pumpkin bread recipe and add the pumpkin seeds next time. This was also not worth the 6 tablespoons of butter. Will not make this again.

If I made this again I would leave out most or all of the ginger. It was strong. Also,not a lot of taste to these muffins. Needed a sugary topping or something to make it more interesting. I threw away the recipe. Shelled pumpkin seeds are available. Just have to know where to look at the grocery store.

Ha! I couldn't find shelled pumpkin seeds and made my poor husband shell the roasted ones I bought! I like to serve several types of breads for Thanksgiving and was a nice compliment to the meal. Very moist. Good, just nothing exciting.
