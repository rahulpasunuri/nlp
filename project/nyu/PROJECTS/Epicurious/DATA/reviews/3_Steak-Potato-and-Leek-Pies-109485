So I tried this as two large pies. Yum!

Great recipe for using up leftovers (that is, cooked potatoes and leftover steak). Addition of carrots or more leeks is fine. Used dijion mustard instead of dry mustard, added beef broth when mixing together filling ingredients. Lots of salt and pepper too. Bake only 15 minutes. And who doesn't love a pie crust? May try a slightly lower-fat alternative for the crust, but still a great fast family supper/lunch.

Very good, especially the crust. I made it with chicken and tasted quite good. Great for a weekday dinner, although may be a little heavy side.

I would only suggest making these pies if you have leftover steak you need to use up. Definitely add some broth to the potato/leek mixture for added moisture and flavor. Add lots of salt and pepper, too. Some people have liked this dish, but most have said pass!

Delicious, but a bit on the dry side.

this recipe is delicious with left over meat and gravy. i find that mixing a few tbls of gravy into each turnover does wonders. make sure also to cook the potatoes really well. extra pepper also adds a bit of a kick, and some cooked carrots are not a mistake.

After reading everyone's comments I made this dish. I added a gravy I made with roux and broth, more seasonings, pretty much anything I could think of to give it more flavor before I stuffed the pastry. I shouldn't have to go to that much effort to make something taste good!

I've made this recipe twice, the second time with heavy modifications. As printed, the filling is overly dry and the beautiful tenderloin was utterly ruined with over-cooking. The second time I made this, I made a slurry of beef broth & cornstarch that I added to the leeks and (pre-boiled) potatoes, eliminated the mustard powder in favor of a good stoneground wet dijon and tossed in a pinch or two of fresh tarragon & thyme. I tossed in the meat at the very end and simply tossed it in the gravy-leek mixture to coat, then filled the pies. I decreased the cooking time to 15-20 minutes after brushing the pie tops lightly with an egg wash. This is a good way to use up Christmas tenderloin & hasselback potato leftovers with minimal fuss, but I wouldn't serve these as a centerpiece of a guest meal.

I think the problem here is that the pies were to be cooked a total of 25 min. (per recipe)and also I would parboil the potatoes before adding to the recipe. Interesting I think i will give it a try. More later

I don't know why the person before me rated this four forks. It is horrible. Even with adding a few things, it was just too dry and tasteless. Don't bother.

I must have cut my potatoes too large, because they needed about fifteen minutes to cook, as opposed to eight. Unfortunately, I'd already put the tenderloin back into the pot, so the meat ended up being very rubbery. In addition, I found that the baking time needed to be extended by approximately five to seven minutes (the crusts were only just firmed at ten). The final pies were good, only I found the filling to be very dry, probably due to the meat being overcooked. Next time I make this, I will add a small amount of beef broth to the potato/leek mixture to give them a bit more flavor & salt while cooking. It's a good recipe, it just needs a bit of tweaking.
