I made this without the pancetta, being vegetarian, but it turned out quite yummy. Also used some crumbled feta mixed with the kale. Quick (if you can prep the veggies ahead of time) and yummy.

I was sadly disappointed how this turned out for me. I didn't exactly follow the instructions. The changes I made, I thought were slight. Not sure where everything went wrong, but it did. I made the following substitutions: acorn squash, shallots, and bacon. The pie turned out rather bland and flavorless. Not sure if I will attempt this recipie again.

I roasted the squash after sauteeing until it became quite soft, then mashed with the cheese and a Tbs of cream. I also made this in a quiche pan with a regular pastry crust--top and bottom--because I couldn't find phyllo dough. Otherwise I made this as directed, and I thought it was really tasty. I would make this again with more squash, since once mashed it is small in volume. It didn't really need a top crust--I ended up not eating it all--but with the phyllo I probably would have wanted the top.

I am a bad reviewer in that I adopted many of the changes previous reviewers recommended on the first time I made it. But, THANK YOU! So, after sauteeing the squash as told, I simply put it on a baking sheet in the oven during pre-heating to allow for greater tenderness. When ready to assemble I mashed the squash to a lumpy consistency, which spread nicely. I also substituted pine nute for the pancetta for our vegetarian guests oz for oz. Lastly, I only used 2 tbl. butter instead of 7 when cooking onions, kale, etc. and then spreayed the phyllo with a butter spray. It turned out feeling like a light but perfectly early autumn meal! We can't wait to make it again.

As written, this recipe yields a mediocre pie. The squash is definitely not cooked enough in the "as written" recipe. Next time, I may even mash the squash before assembling the pie. Better squash consistency would make the pie significantly tastier. Otherwise, it seems like a pretty good recipe. I might make it again, with the modification suggested. Also, chopped nuts would be tasty here too.

Roasted pine nuts are a great replacement for pancetta if you are vegetarian (or don't have Pancetta). A great dish to impress as it looks beautiful.

Made the pie pretty much according to recipe. It was very good, but not fantastic, as I had hoped. I would make this again, but I would change it up a bit. I would roast the squash in the oven for a much longer time. I added more garlic than called for...but it still needed something....a more flavorful cheese perhaps. My husband really liked it and it was beautiful to look at and serve.

I made this without the pancetta to bring as a veggie main course to two Thanksgiving meals. It was a hit even with non-veggie lovers.

This recipe is the bomb. I like a little bit more pancetta than called for and I also tried making it with chorizo, which changed the character a lot but was quite good as well. This recipe is a keeper.

I have made this several times and it is always good. However last night I substituted 4 oz. bacon for the pancetta and used puff pastry crust instead of the filo and it tasted great.

This one's filed under my OMG-good recipes! The only change I made (and only because I have to count calories) is that I put only a top crust of phyllo on, plus used just a light spray of olive oil instead of all the butter. Worked perfectly, and tastes magnificent!

This recipe is great, and produces a gorgeous product! I made it exactly as written, and the results were beautiful. It's very satisfying to eat, and feels very healthy.

This one was a hit. IT was a bit of work, but it can be the entire meal. And so healthful! Phyllo dough makes everything so simple.

You can buy washed coarsely chopped kale and peeled and cubed butternut squash in BJ's...so I did not spend the time prepping...actually start to finish was 20 minutes...I also used butter spray on the phyllo which I doubled....great meal...my husband (and best critic) loved it.

This was excellent. I served it with wild brown rice and Corn Bread with Fennel Seeds, Dried Cranberries,and Golden Raisins. Will definitely make it again.

As others have remarked, this recipe is a LOT of work but really delicious and a unusually colourful fall dish. I made it almost exactly to specifications (a bit more pancetta because the piece I bought was about 5 oz, and correspondingly less olive oil because there was plenty of fat coming off the pancetta) and it turned out beautifully, exactly like the picture. My husband and I ate half of it in one sitting and can hardly wait for the leftovers. It's definitely something different to do with kale.

Everyone loves this pie, even my kids. It also looks great. I am bringing it to a dinner party tomorrow night. I do use bacon instead of the pancetta but thats the only change.

I meant to include with my review that I may add toasted pine nuts next time for a little crunch.

I'm cooking for one, and usually dishes this size don't get finished, but I'm down to the last slice. It's surprising that I've eaten so much of it because my initial reaction was not a rave. However, it's been consistently good and hasn't bored me. The sweet squash and bite of the onion/pancetta is a very nice combination. The phyllo dough kept ripping, so practice first if you're planning to serve to guests.

This was great! Easier to make if you cut everything up ahead and store in fridge until ready to prepare. I went heavier on the pepper to spice up the squash. Definitely a keeper.

Incredible taste combo - I've made it with phyllo, with regular pie crust and, in the summer, as a saute (sprinkling the cheese over top). It is my signature dish these days - people who 'hate' kale or squash absolutely love it and request it at all potlucks.

This is THE perfect fall dish!! The only change I made was to substitute a whole wheat short crust for the philo dough, but honestly, the combination of flavors in the pie is wonderful! I loved it!

This was delicious! Very autumnal. I made it exactly as directed except used regular bacon. It was a little fiddly and involved to make; I found that putting the fillings together the day before helped. Anyway, we loved it at my house.

Wonderful! I used a few extra sheets of phyllo to make a thicker bottom and substituted bacon for the pancetta, and it was wonderful. My husband and I nearly ate the whole thing! I would add some extra parmesan as well.

This was very good and looked elegant on the table. I slipped the dish after removing the sides on to a silver serving platter just slightly larger that the bottom pan. But is was a lot of work - two of us did all of the cutting and still it was slow going. I would like to have it served to me but while it was very good, I judge it more effort than I would go to again.

Made recipe as directed and served it to guests who were delighted. It is visually stunning and unusual in its textures, tastes and ingredients. I will make it again- and have done a quicky casserole substituting tortillas and canned pumpkin and it got raves too.

I made this for a dinner party of four, and it was amazing. I'm a phyllo fan anyway, but the spinach and butternut squash compliment perfectly. The only problem I had was when I cut it and tried to put a slice onto a plate--it fell apart somewhat. The taste was PERFECT though. The guests loved it. I would definitely do it again. OH..this recipe says a pie feeds six. It fed four of us, but with not a square of squash remaining!

Wonderful and simple dish. I didn't have any pancetta, so I used hot italian sausage as a substitute. I took the meat out of the casing so it resembled a ground meat. The flavor was wonderful with the kale and squash.

I loved this! It's going to be a company treat. Once suggestion: Put a cookie sheet in the oven on the shelf below -- the butter from the phyllo dough leaked out the bottom of my spring form pan -- my oven's smoking! But, the dish is absolutely delicious.
