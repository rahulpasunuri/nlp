just to make everyone crazy, i used sea bass, most probably fished illegally and unseasonably off of the Canadian coast. (mmmm...canadian sea bass). Preheat oven to 400. For two people, 2/3 lb total fish weight. Place fish on nonstick spray over aluminum foil. Score the fish and top (spread all over the top) with a sauteed mixture of: 1 TBS olive oil, 1 TBS unsalted crab butter (or reg unsalted butter), 1/3 c. shopped spinach (half that if already cooked), 2 TBS salted pistachios (shelled, in case you were wondering), 2 TBS Worcestershire, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1 tsp of pepper, 1 TBS horseradish, and 1 TBS lemon juice. Baked at 400 until flaked from the middle (didn't use parchment, totally screwed with the best part of the recipe). Garnish with kudzu. Deeee-lish. (Author affiliated with "seabass=deliciousUSA.com) jk Seriously - Worcestershire and butter on seafood it almost always good - traditional base of a "neuberg sauce."

YUMMY! When it comes to pistachios i know it is a nut that is good for you, having fiber, potassium, and antioxidants, and so much more? You can't go wrong! check out www.orandiranch.com for great pistachios handcrafted with Himalayan Pinksalt!

Unbelievably delicious and makes for a restaurant presentation...it was worthy of a holiday dinner party! not at all difficult to make. My Whole Foods does not sell Sea Beans so I just left them out and it was fine. One thing to note: I would bring crab salad out of fridge to come up to temperature before plating...mine was really cold and cooled the broth way too quickly. the coconut sauce is a must...don't bother putting in blender...never really did froth, but didn't matter either. I'd make this dish a million more times.

This recipe really is very nice - but not quick and I had to buy a lot of "stuff". (sea beans $10 a pound .. pistachio oil $23.00 a can) ..but I will make this again. Why was the folding of the parchment so difficult to understand? I felt like a little kid trying to make a valentine. Still not sure I did it right. The flavors are divine - a crowd pleaser for sure. No directions on the coconut sauce either - I just added some cornstarch mixed with water, as the milk was heating - so the combo became thick. It was wonderful.

This was outstanding. It ranks as one of the best meals I've ever had. Everyone at the dinner party raved about it. The chicken from the coconut sauce was a fantastic lunch. If you live in San Diego, Specialty Produce has the sea beans and pistachio oil.

I have not made this but it is in my recipe box and I was perusing the comments. I live in Atlanta and can almost always purchase sea beans at Whole Foods. They are a delicious addition to fish dishes (slightly salty and crunchy). They are $10/pound, but you can get by with a handful when combined in a stir fry with nappa cabbage, bok choy, etc.

This dish was outstanding; I applaud Chef Gras. I looked for sea beans at two stores that carry specialty items and neither had heard of them, so I was sorry I couldn't experience them; I just put lettuce on the plate with the crab on top. Another issue was that my coconut sauce didn't froth; don't know what I did wrong there. I used the controversial Chilean Sea Bass and loved it. All the flavors in this dish were delicate and blended so well; it was truly exquisite. Will look harder for the sea beans next time I make it. It was a lot of fun to do and very much worth it!

I served this for a dinner party and used halibut. I also substituted the salicornia beans with french beans and it was delicious and got rave reviews from all my guests. I am making it again this weekend for a different group.

Thank you all for a great laugh on an early Sunday morning. I'll be making this recipe today... mainly to see if all of this bickering is worth it. I'll let you know how it turns out.

This was such a scrumptious dish! Absolutely beyond compare and one of the most special fish dishes I have ever made. Amazing/surprising blend of flavours that had my gourmet dinner club swooning in a state of near ecstasy! Followed the recipe to the letter and really enjoyed making this and learning new techniques - had never thought of pre-browning fish in a parchment jacket, but it was a superb way to maintain flavour/moisture, and I will definitely use that method with other fish. Loved the frothy coconut sauce - a perfect pairing with the other ingredients. Found sea beans at a large local public market and ordered the sea bass in advance. Re the initial post from a fellow Canadian: Other than striped bass (different species entirely), sea bass does not inhabit Canadian waters, ergo it cannot be illegal to fish for it here - how ridiculous! And, it certainly is not illegal to sell/buy it (unlike other fish such as sturgeon), but it is in very short supply, especially Chilean sea bass. If your environmental/conservation sensibilites will not allow you to use sea bass, suggest velvety monkfish would be an excellent alternative - sweet-tasting, low-fat and tender-firm, so not too unlike sea bass in taste/texture. Would make this again in a heart beat! Bon appetit and thanks, Epicurious, for another outstanding recipe!

I live in Canada, I buy my Sea Bass at a local fish market, I also buy it in China Town here quite often. If I can't find certain ingredients I always order them on line. There is no excuse for not being able to find an item a recipe calls for, and a recipe as great as this one, I'd reccomend doing what you can to aquire those ingredients! Or, use your imagination and be your own chef!

Well well well...I was reading the comments for this recipe and it was like reading a silly book....people people what is wrong with some of you? Especially the one from Vancouver (last one I think) !! A few weeks ago my husband took me to a Cordon Bleu Restaurant for my birthday and one thing we enjoyed during the course of the evening was Chilean Sea Bass so someone is selling this...that has not been outlawed in Canada. AND just because the recipe has an ingredient that some think is unacquireable - so what! use your imagination and get a life. Shaking My Head in Ottawa, Ontario, Yes Canada

I agree with everyone who has commented on the entertainment value of these reviews. I have not tried this recipe, may do so using other than the endangered species. However, for REAL entertainment, see the "Sunday Supper macaroni and cheese". One review includes a diatribe of reactions of the children of one reviewer (read the recipe; would anyone with kids feed them this?), their physical responses and so on ad nauseum. This is hilarious! Thank you all for making my day at the end of a long one. Tired. Needed a laugh.

Sometimes this site just cracks me up - who needs a therapist when you've got these hilarious reviewers?!! I used halibut (hope that doesn't offend anyone) It's a nice flavorful dish and I adore using parchment w/ fish. Really helps hold in the juices and adds so much to the flavor!!!

Very nice combination of flavors. My husband especially liked the coconut sauce that went with the dish. Was surprised to find seabeans here, apparently it's also used in spaghetti with seafood.

This was a great reipe , I've made similar using halibut or snapper. I am fortunate that salicornia grows rampant in my area of the PNW and I feel it adds a wonderful touch to the Dish

I loved this dish! I also left out the salicornia, though I could have found it I didn't have it on hand. Next time I make this I will make a effort to get it. p.s. The message from "Maryland on 10/7/03" was entirely unnecesary and mean spirited. This website is suppossed to encourage sharing and dialoque, not insults and hostility. Let's all try to act like respectful adults shall we!

Well, ya'll have quite a lot to say about a recipe that no one has made. I used sea bass (I didn't ask what variety) and could not find salicornia. I left it out (no big deal). The recipe was no more pretentious than the comments I've read here. It's a straight forward technique ( I love using parchment). The fish was tasty, and I shall prepare it again. The coconut sauce is lovely. That said, if a recipe calls for a critter that you don't want to eat, don't make it. If you can't find or don't have the ingredients, find out where to get them or make something else. If the technique involved is too much for you, either learn more about it or stick to the basics. I don't give a flip if you eat foie gras, kudzu, garbanzos or armadillo (check out the comments for Aji-Amarillo Pineapple Salsa on this website). This is all about food, not fools. There. I said it, and I'm glad.

I have yet to make this but I was so annoyed by cook from New Mexico's comment that I had to respond. I am sorry they don't have the ingredients where you live.. but why spoil it for the rest of us? I live in a suburb of Chicago and can get them (don't live in NYC, which you suggested is the only place you can..) but some of us serious cooks like a challenge like this. If you are seeking "more normal" ingredients, why are you looking at a gourmet recipe website??? Go to Allrecipes.com. I'm sure they're more your speed. It's rather presumptious of you to assume that Epicurious should stop publishing upscale recipes like this just because YOU can't make it. Get over yourself. Now I'm going to try it.. sounds good.

I applaud Epicurious for including this recipe in its files and on its email. Recipes are not always intended to be followed ingredient for ingredient or method for method. I applaud them for including this method of searing the nut-crusted fish through parchment paper -- a new idea to me. (By the way, the parchment wrap isn't difficult, it is just a wordy how-to explanation.) So substitute a non-endangered fish and forget the crab salad with an obscure ingredient.

dear friend, readers and epicurious: I was fortunate to work with Laurent Gras for a while when i was in New York. All of his recepies look difficult, over the top, and so on. But if you think of the philosophy of his food, it all gets together. I know, his recepies are difficult to make,if you are in the middle of nowhere, of in Rio de Janeiro, like me. It is easy to judge, to condemn. Why don't you come up with something better then, huh? Or maybe, start thinking; how can i substitute that one ingredient that i can't find in my store? It would be, however, better if epicurious shows more accecable recepies, i agree... Take care all of you, Rio de Janeiro

I thought SC's ideas for substitution were just grand, but I didn't have some of it; but I had been fishing on the Wateree and caught some nice, fresh crappie (that's a real fish, y'all). The Piggly Wiggly didn't have that seaweed stuff so I just went out in the front yard and trimmed the Kudzu--julienned it to look like the green stuff in the photo and man was it a hit.

The reviews of this recipe get more hilarious every minute, and tears came to my eyes from laughing so hard. I couldn't make this recipe if I wanted to. In this town our source of food is one food store plus a Wal-Mart. I doubt that I can find sea bass (endangered or not), and how about "sea bean (salicornia), tips"??? Epicurious, I wish you would print recipes with more normal ingredients. Not everyone lives in NYC. PS) Where is there a Circle K that sells 2 kinds of pistachios???

I will gladly give 4 forks, not to the recipe mentioned above, but to the one from South Carolina. I used all the ingredients you suggested but I made 1 substitution, I didn't have ham, so instead I used Hormel canned chile, and it tasted awesome. I topped it off with a sprinkling of kraft parmesan cheese. But I had a problem wrapping it up in the parchment paper,I don't know why that was, but other than that it was a big hit with my family and friends. I think that the cook from SC should be hired by epicurious, if you keep coming up with winners like that.

Reading these reviews is a laugh a minute!!! Hey South Carolina, do you always use phraes like, "...didn't have no fish"? Educated in Alabama by any chance? How about the person from New York City? Eating foie gras and wearing a fur coat? Try the South Beach Diet !!!!!!

Uh, Cook from Ontario - Cook from SC was joking! Ha ha ha? This is food people! Lighten up! Substitute ham, etc if you don't like fish. A serious question, though: What is a substitute for salicornia? I mean besides garbonzos?

This recipe takes the prize for the most comments without ever bring made.The cook from Carolina also takes a prize, the booby prize for even thinking that she made this recipe. She is missing a career as a stand up comi. My question is "How could epicurious even pick this recipe out to hilight, let alone ever publish it?"

I would love to try this recipe, but salicornia is a very delicious, distinctive ingredient, and I have never seen it fresh in the US. It grows (nad I have picked it!) in the tidal marshes of the Ile de Re and other north atlantic coastal regions of Europe. I think it would grow well here - does anyone know of a source? I would use grouper or striped bass, plentiful on the East coast (and better, in my opinion).

Too much going on here to not put in my $.02. I think that the impending "extinction" of Chilean Sea Bass is the case of some good intentions run amok. Sure, the CSB is overfished in certain areas, but the problem is being addressed internationally by regulatory measures. Also, the generic term "sea Bass" encompasses so many varieties that one should not get hung up on specifics. Pick a fish you like, and go with that. This recipe could just as easily been named "Pistachio Light-fleshed, Non-Oily, Ocean-Dwelling Fish with Crab Salad." Recipes are merely guidelines, not homework! BTW, I made this recipe, and I used snapper. I've always been a fan of the parchment paper method for fish. It's practically fool-proof.

Rating: 0
I think all the controversy over this recipe just points to a need for more precise instructions from those writing the recipes in the first place. I have often found it very frustrating that Epicurious send out recipes that say to use "sea bass", since I know from research that I have done on this issue that the term sea bass in the United States is used to describe 17 different species of fish, including the truly troubled toothfish! How about telling us which sea bass you intended and lets avoid all fuss! BTW.. The cook from Vancouver is correct, Chilean Sea Bass (Patagonian and Antarctic toothfish) is in trouble, mainly from illegal fishermen who fish beyond quotos and without permits. And the joint Commerce and State Deprtment fact sheet mentioned by another reviewer talks about the problem with illegal fishing and the fact that illegal fish gets into the United States despite all the efforts of enforcement officials. Just because it is for sale in the fish counter does NOT mean it is a good choice.

Funny thing - I read another recipie for sea bass on this site and found a similar diatribe about how the world was coming to an end! I think the last few reviewers were right - something's "fishy"! Perhaps PETA folks have infiltrated our site and are surfing under sea bass for lack of better things to do! If you are offended at the thought of eating a particular fish - ask your fish monger for a good substitute and let us know how it tasted, that would be so much more effective. Me, I love sea bass, so will eat it in moderation, like all else...

Gads the excess verbage. The recipe calls for Sea Bass, not "Chilean Sea Bass" which is, in reality, Patagonian Toothfish. It bears about as much similarity to Pacific Sea Bass, Striped Sea Bass, etc. as a Yak does to your pet Pomeranian. That being said, there is a lot of debate over the endangered status of Patagonian Toothfish. So, as long as it is in the fish case, I'll buy it. If you're concerned about environmental issues, buy any of the "regular" sea basses. Sheesh

Answer me this: Why would someone who is adamantly opposed to eating sea bass, be on this website looking at this recipe? Something's "fishy". This is just another case of someone forcefeeding their opinion onto other people. By the way, as I'm typing this, I'm wearing a fur coat and eating fois gras. Bon Appetit!

Regarding the Chilean Sea Bass: There is some debate on whether even Chilean Sea Bass is truly endangered. You may find it helpful to read a joint publication put out by the U.S Departments of Commerce and State at the following website: www.nmfs.noaa.gov/trade/chile.pdf I agree with the previous reviewer that there are many delicious variety of sea bass to select from.

As a rebuttal to the reviewer who urges people not to try this recipe because it boasts using an ingredient that is on the brink of extinction, you are underinformed. The kind of sea bass that is in danger is "Chilean Sea Bass." In the family of sea bass, there are many other fish that are not in danger and are perfectly good substitutes, as well as virtuous in their own right. Ask your fishmonger about Corvina, Mexican Sea Bass or any others that are similar in flavor and flesh. You will find that these fish are a bit less oily and firm, as well as a bit darker fleshed, but when cooked in parchment so that they retain all of their jus, are minimally different from their Chilean cousins. It would be a shame to pass over this recipe, which blends some very appealing flavors. I believe that Epicurious.com is run by people who want us all to try new foods, to ask about what we eat and to go into the kitchen informed and excited. The way to change people's buying haibts is to find new and exciting foods that make them feel as if they are not substituting or comprimising. There are so many things to eat out there.

sea bass is a fish on the brink of extinction. I don't know what the situation is any where else in the world, but in Canada it is illegal to fish or sell this fish. not a recipe to be boasting about. Certainly not a recipe to try.
