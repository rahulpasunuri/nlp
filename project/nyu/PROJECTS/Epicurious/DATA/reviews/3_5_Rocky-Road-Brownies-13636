Eating these warm from the oven... 5-y-o too happy for words, 8-y-o asked why don't I make them every day, 10-y-o connoisseur said "those brownies are good but next time don't add as many nuts" (but they didn't stop him from eating 2). Made them for the kids, so will keep this one in the files. BTW, regarding difficulty in cutting them: I put a sheet of parchment across the bottom of the pan, hanging over on 2 sides, then just pulled it out, let it cool for a bit on a rack, moved back to cutting board and cut with a long knife. Still a bit messy, but not too bad. (If we'd let it cool more, would've been easier, but the little ones couldn't wait!)

I made this recipe exactly as stated and was happy with the result. They were in place of a cake for my husband's birthday and he was more than thrilled. This is a keeper and will be made for many more birthdays to come!

These are the best brownies I have ever had and extremely easy to make. I get so disappointed when you go to a restaurant and you see these delicious looking brownies only to buy one and it's totally dry. These are chewy and moist. I'm the only one who ate them because other people didn't like the walnuts. I'll be making them again this week and making a batch without the walnuts.

I thought these were going to be too sweet for me, and I don't like marshmallows, but I was making them for my kids. Now I'm hoping my 3-year old and I don't finish them before the other 2 get home from school! They brownies are delicious, just the right amount of sweet with the combination of chocolates, and moist and just yummy. The topping is ooey and gooey and sweet and they look and taste delicious. Try it. (I skipped the nuts and spread the topping out a bit just after it came out of the oven so it was even across the top.)

My husband, after several years of eating low- glycemically, claims to be uninterested in sweets, but when I offered these at a dinner party, he admitted that he might have been wrong and that they were "insanely good." They would probably have been even better if the marshmallows hadn't been from a pack left over from when my last child left for college in 2002.

For some reasons, I didn't expect a lot from this recipe, but I took them to a picnic and they were gone in minutes. Icing & melted marshmellos make them gooey on the top, middle layer is the consistancy of a somewhat dry cheese cake and then dense cakey brownie on the bottom. Everyone raved, that's all I can say. Adults, teens and kiddies. Best when kept in the refrigerator and served cold. Good "make ahead" recipe. A royal pain to cut, though. There has to be a trick to it - maybe freeze them a bit before slicing. I put each brownie square in a cupcake paper and served on a large tray.

This is my best friend's favorite brownie, so I make it for her quite often. What I do is leave the mini marshmallows out, put small plops of marshmallow fluff evenly over the top of the brownie base, then put small plops of the brownie, walnut, chocolate chip mixture on top. You can swirl it if you like. For whatever odd reason, I like marshmallow fluff, but not marshmallows. In general, this recipe is a bit too sweet for me, but I certainly indulge in a piece whenever I make them.

A great, fudgy classic. Here's how I do it: 1) Toast the walnuts & fold into the batter. 2) Top almost-done brownies w/ marshmallows & chocolate chips (semi or milk) instead of batter-mallow-nut mix. Marble topping with a butter knife while still warm. I got rave reviews for these, even from a self-proclaimed nut hater. The brownie part is great on its own, too, but either way they are VERY rich.

I loved these, but I should confess that I have a strong sweet tooth, and I love marshmallows on just about anything. These are almost like candy (which I have admittedly chosen over food on occasion). These brownies are definitely not for everyone, but they are for perfect for me and other sugar-chocolate-candy junkies.

A dentist's dream come true. These brownies were even too sweet for a ten year old. After he winced at the sweetness; he suggested I not make these again. I suggest we take his advice.

This dessert sure doesn't look like much. In fact, it doesn't look appetizing at all, BUT looks are deceiving. It was rich with a very chocolatey taste. Couldn't really taste the marshmallows but that's okay with me. My husband also loved it. I would make it again.
