I improvised. No Swiss chard, so I used spinach. I had cooking sherry but no sherry vinegar, so I tossed in a bit of raspberry vinaigrette. This was my first time to eat chestnuts, and I like them. I was also only cooking for myself, so I had plenty of the vinaigrette left. I cooked a brick of ramen noodles without its seasoning packet and stirred it into the remaining vinaigrette and got two more meals out of it. This is what I think of as "weekend cooking", as it's more time- and labor-intensive than I normally enjoy, but the results were well worth it.

What's not to like about fried fish? Fried striped bass? My market was fresh out of pomegranite molasses :( so I improvised trying to get something sweet and sour at the same time. Also, swiss chard was in short supply, so I used Kale - not quite the same texture. Well, regardless, we were pretty happy with the results. A mound of perfect mash potatoes on the plate made it over the top. For the curious, we started with a yellow pepper soup. It all worked together so nicely.

I made this for the nonmeat eaters at Thanksgiving. It was very delicious and combined well with all the Thanksgiving side dishes. Everyone loved the fish, even the turkey eaters. Several guests agreed that it would make an excellent dinner party entree. I liked all the colors of it and the flavor blended well. I used a very fresh cod from our fish market.

This was just okay. The vinaigrette was too overpowering for the fish to my liking. I am sure there is a better way to cook that delicious fish, so I will keep looking for another recipe.
