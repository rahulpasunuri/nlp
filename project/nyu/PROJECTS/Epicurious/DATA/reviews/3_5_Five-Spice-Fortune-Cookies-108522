I couldn't find Five Spice, so I used a combination of cinnamon, nutmet and ground cloves, which worked great. I'd also recommend using a muffin tin to place fortune cookies in while they cool - I put 2 cookies together in each spot, and it helps them hold their shape while they cool. I took these to a party and they were a big hit. They're a lot easier than they look and you can have a lot of fun writing the fortunes.

I'm guessing all fortune cookies are a lot of work, so I won't point that out. If you want fortune cookies and you're willing to bake a recipe with a one-hour active time, this is a great one to choose. The five-spice powder adds a terrific flavor-- even my mistake-cookies got eaten. I tried once not cooling the baking sheet before spreading on the dough. The result was a disaster-- the cookies were impossible to get off the baking sheet (even scraping with a spatula) until I soaked the whole thing in water. After that I used my silicon baking pad and it worked brilliantly. I was afraid the cookies might not be as crisp as the ones baked directly on the sheet, but I could not tell a difference in the results. Another challenge was folding the cookies properly. I certainly can't say that my cookies looked much like proper fortune cookies, but toward the end they at least improved. Maybe next time I will try and find a "real" fortune cookie as a guide. You also may want to note that these cookies don't keep well. Mine got soggy after one day. A friend recommended keeping rice in the cookie jar with them, which I might try in the future, but generally I think it would be best to eat these the same day.
