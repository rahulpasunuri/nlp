This is a wonderful summer pasta salad. We love it just as it is.

Made with goat cheese substituted for feta and 1 pound of pasta instead of 1.5. Delicious! My friends and I especially loved the Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing. I will definitely be making this again.

This dish is simple and really tasty. Perfect for a hot summer night. I added shredded chicken and left out the salty capers. Would be great for a party.

This is our go-to dish for potlucks and hot summer nights. Make it a meal by adding shrimp. Always a crowd pleaser.

I didn't like this recipe, but I can see why other people did. I thought that the balsamic and aromatics were rather overwhelming. If you make this recipe, you have to use REALLY GOOD tomatoes.

So good. Maybe that 1 1/2 lbs is a typo -- it definitely should be no more than 1 lb of pasta. Next time, I'll use much more tomato and basil.

This was Yum-O - very similar to a Meditteranean Pasta Salad on Epi. Also used mild goat cheese and cut back the pasta a bit. It still made a lot.

Great recipe! I agree with other review, you should only use 1 lb. of pasta.

TO MARY FROM IL, YOU CAN USE WHITE BALSAMIC VINEGAR. IT WILL WORK GREAT. I HAVE HAD A RECIPE LIKE THIS ONE BEFORE AND IT IS VERY GOOD, LIGHT AND SATISFYING.

IMHO there is too much pasta for the amount of vegetables in this recipe. I ended up adding diced zucchini and summer squash and doubling the cheese, olives, red onion and fresh basil. I am not a fan of the balsamic dressing either. It turned the pasta an unappetizing shade of brown and seemed a bit heavy.

Nice flavors. Served with a simply sauteed flounder for a quick dinner.

Easy and delicious, and pretty! It's just a classic little Italian pasta dish. I served it cold as a side dish for a summer BBQ (grilled veggies and sausages). Used mild goat cheese instead of feta.

Very Very Very good. Awesome vinagrette, will make again and again. Looked beautiful too!

Light, tasty, and flavorful. Overall a great meal. I added about 1/2 pound of lightly sauteed shrimp, coarsely chopped, and I sauteed the red onions with the shrimp (I don't like onions raw). Also, I cut the pasta in half and it was still plenty for four people. I'm already looking forward to the leftovers for tomorrow.

This is a classic! Great with grilled fish and a light pesto.
