First time I used a combo of dates, apricots and cherry flavored cranberries and it was very, very good. Second time I used dates and cherries and added three quarter tsp cinnamon and one quarter tsp cloves and it was exquisite. Both times I peeled a large orange very thinly, chopped it & added all. Dusted with icing surgar and circled with good quality truffles it made an unusual and tasty birthday cake.

I typically make a special baked treat for my folks and my in-laws at Christmas--this was a big hit this year. It looked/felt dry coming out of the oven, but it was actually perfect: very dense and moist, not too sweet. I made it two or three more times after the holidays.

This would be very good just by itself, but with the brandied whipped cream it is wonderful. Instead of the 3 oz of dates (used the first 6 oz of dates), I used some dried peaches. Also, just grated the rind of a whole orange, using all of it instead of measuring. Otherwise, followed the recipe, and took it to some friends of friends whom I had never met. They kept saying we should have started dinner with it, rather than saving ir for the end. Highly recommended as an easy winter chocolate fruity treat.

I made this about 36 hrs ahead for Christmas Eve and was very happy with it. I followed the recipe except for having used Dutch-processed cocoa powder. Next time I might cut the dates into smaller pieces. I froze a piece and am eating it now -- I'd say it tastes even better! Definitely part of my make-ahead repertoire.

Delicious, rustic cake. Rather like a chocolate fruitcake, like a previous reviewer wrote. I read the reviews and made the following changes: substituted dried cranberries for dried cherries (impossible to get here in A'dam), added 1/4 cup chopped, unsweetened bottled cherries, decreased amount of hot water and brandy, added a little lemon juice and extra orange peel as well as a dash of cinnamon and ground ginger. Baked for 45-50 minutes, didn't fall or crack. Friends at dinner party loved it. Only 6 people, not a slice left!

Delicious cake, rather like a chocolate fruitcake as a previous reviewer wrote, but better than any ol' holiday fruitcake I've had. I made a few changes, based on previous reviews and ingredient availability here in A'dam: substituted dried cranberries for dried cherries (very difficult to get here), added 1/4 cup chopped, unsweetened bottled cherries, added little less hot water and brandy so cake wouldn't be too moist and fall, and melted about 1/3-1/2 of the 6 oz chocolate with the butter and added to the sugar. I found it increased the chocolatey flavor without increasing the sweetness. Baked for 45-50 minutes, and it was perfect inside. Everyone raved about the cake at the dinner party where I took it. Only 6 people, not a single piece left!

Very good, like a fruity, complex brownie but a little cakier and drier. I wonder if some lemon juice might amp up the flavors and balance the dates' sweetness. It isn't a really exciting taste but it is very satisfying--your palate pauses over it. I bet it does get better with age. My changes: only 1 stick of butter, whiskey for brandy, dried lemon peel for fresh orange zest, chopped dates from King Arthur Flour (no variety named). Fresh zest is better, I'm sure. Check the cake 5-10 minutes early to make sure it's not overdone.

What a perfect little mid-winter indulgence! Rich, chocolaty, slightly boozy - yum! Next time, I will remember to wrap my springform pan in foil (a few drips of batter snuck out of the bottom and burnt on the oven floor) and I will bake the full amount of time (very center of cake slightly "molten" after 50 minutes).

I make it the first time and came out so good and moist. My son absolutely loves it.I followed the direction and it works..

I made this cake for a holiday party- I was running late and didn't cool it for as long as I should have, and I didn't think it was the greatest cake ever. Then, I ate a slice of the leftover cake that had been in the fridge for a couple of days, and I was in LOVE. So, I recommend cooling this cake COMPLETELY, ideally at least overnight- it is much much better.

This is delicious. My husband calls it "chocolate fruitcake," but I worry that name will scare eaters away! This cake is moist and delicious. This recipe is from Local Flavors, one of cookbooks that I use every week.

I loved this Tort and so did everybody else. I made it for a friends Birthday and I received compliments all round. The only thing I did differently was that I used only one type of date that was from my supermarket, dry cherrys wasn't availabe to me, so I used glace cherrys and Quantro istead of brandy cause thats what I had at home. I have a fan forced oven that I can't adjust so I took off 10 min. and lowered the temp. just a fraction. I Can't wait to make it again.

This was the worst cake I've ever made. I'm a good baker, made my own wedding cake and do quite a bit of baking. Followed the recipe and it tasted dry as cardboard. Thank goodness I served with vanilla ice cream to "wet it down" a bit. Threw away 3/4s of the uneaten cake. Never again.

This torte has wonderful flavor. My prep time was longer than 30 minutes but was well worth it. Makes a wonder Christmas gift.

I would give this torte 5 forks if possible. It is fabulous. I follow the directions exactly as written - every time. I use all fresh Medjool dates - never could find the other variety. I also use about 1 1/4 cups of Ghiradelli Bittersweet Chocolate Chips without chopping them further. Only other minor change was in the suggested whipped cream recipe that follows - used only 1 tablespoon of powdered sugar instead of 2. Torte easily serves 12. It's great for the holiday season or a winter buffet dinner party. A 12th of this torte with a very large dollop of the brandied whipped cream is very filling but oh so divine. Everyone I've ever served it to eats and swoons simultaneously!

Made this twice over the Holidays, once as dessert for a friend's dinner party and then again for ourselves. First one was perfect cooked the full 55 minutes. The second cake came out after 55 min as well but was too moist and fell slightly. In hindsight the dried cherries and dates in the second one were much moister to begin with so that is something to be aware of when judging baking time or, perhaps, determining if liquids should be reduced a bit. Used cognac instead of brandy, Callebaut cocoa and bittersweet chocolate and everyone loved it. Will probably make this every year now.

Okay, I was disappointed. It's an easy recipe, I followed it exactly, I used good quality ingredients and I didn't overbake. Though it looked pretty and tasted moist the brandy flavor was overwhelming and I found I really didn't like it. My guests didn't much either.

WOW! My only suggestion is to bake for a little less time - at least in my oven, 45 minutes would be perfect.

I made this for Christmas and it tasted gorgeous... I substituted dried cranberries for the cherries and nuts for the pecans. I only had Dutch process cocoa, but it worked just fine. I used bergamot-scented dark chocolate. This recipe is a definite keeper.

Every time I serve this, the plate is scraped clean. It's just a little different, and delicious.

This cake stayed miraculously moist in our arrid climate and it was delicious (not too sweet). I served it in a warm puddle of bittersweet chocolate sauce with a dollop of homemade whipped cream on top. Just divine...I will absolutely make it again.

This torte is absolutely wicked!! I substituted the dates and cherries with prunes and dried cranberries, and used cherry brandy instead of brandy. To prevent the sides from getting too brown, I double lined my tins with parchment paper. Also, having a pan of water on the lower rack in the oven as the cake cooks helps prevent the top from burning and keeps it moist. Have repeated this recipe 3 times with great success.

This cake was a big hit at my annual New Year's brunch. I made it 2 days before and it was nice and moist when served. It probably would freeze well also. I was able to find the different varieties of dates at a farmers' market, but not at my local supermarket.

This is a gorgeous dessert. I made it on Christmas Day, then sat back and watched my guests swoon. I love that it has dried fruits and pecans like a good fruitcake should, but it's also moist and chocolatey and not at all like the much maligned fruitcakes of Christmases past.

This cake was a bit blah, no spices or anything. My cake began to burn about ten minutes before the baking time was up, took it out only five minutes early because I wasn't sure if the center was set enough and the sides were charred. I wonder if you added some spices if that would improve the recipe??

Am I the only one who thinks the photo link is an error? Looks more like a jello mold than a torte supposedly baked in a springform pan. And what's with the shine and the grapefruit segments? Bogus.

Not too hard and totally wonderful. Interesting and not overly sweet or heavy. It was a great addition to a holiday buffet.
