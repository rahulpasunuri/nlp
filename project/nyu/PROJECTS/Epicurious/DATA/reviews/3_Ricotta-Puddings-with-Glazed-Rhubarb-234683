Excellent simple dessert, so easy to prepare. I used plain yoghurt instead of sour cream, otherwise followed recipe exactly. Will do it again, would also be great with strawberry coulis.

It was so easy to make and I loved the lemon zest in the ricotta custard. I forgot to add the cream and used Quark instead of sour cream, so it's possible mine weren't quite as wet. I also didn't use the corn starch in the rhubard.

This recipe is amazing! Every time I've made it, I've had rave reviews. Possibly one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten.

I liked this recipe. If using fresh rhubarb, I would advise to leave in the oven half as long as the recipe says so. Otherwise, it turns to mush.

Definitely did not look pretty, but the flavors played nicely off one another. I was also disappointed that the custards did not hold their shape at all. I might play with temperature (higher) and cooking times next time I make it.

I thought maybe the other reviewers just didn't like ricotta cakes, and I do. These didn't seem like ricotta puddings to me, but very similar in texture to other ricotta cakes I've made, the graininess didn't bother me. But, they weren't as tasty as other ricotta cakes I've made, and they were slightly wetter - not moister, but wetter, if you know what I mean (as in, wet not in a good way). The rhubarb on top redeemed them, but otherwise they were just ordinary, and I wouldn't make them again. The idea of making little ricotta cakes and this topping is good though, so I might do it again using a different recipe that I have for ricotta cakes. Too bad.

The previous reviewer hit the nail on the head on this one. Ditto. Soggy, deflated, grainy. I didn't make the rhubarb sauce (I topped it with strawberry preserves to give it SOME kind of flavor), but can't imagine that it could salvage this BORING recipe. It reminded me of a really bad weight watchers recipe from 30 years ago.

These were a complete waste of time and ingredients. Although the puddings puffed nicely in the oven, they deflated immediately upon being removed. Had to scrape their flat selves out of the muffin tin. They're bland, drab and grainy textured. These ingredients can be put to far better use.

Haven't tried this yet but it sounds good, even tho (at least here)it's a bad rhubarb year.Can anybody tell me if 3 1/2 Tbs sugar is really enough for the amt. of rhubarb?
