I really like this recipe. I have only made grilled tempeh once before so I was curious to try it again. I followed the recipe except used fresh squeezed oj and omitted the basil (didn't have any in the fridge). Also, I changed up the greens a bit. I boiled dandelion greens for 10 minutes then sauteed them in the balsamic glaze after the tempeh was done. I'm sure I'll make this again. And, the lemon is PERFECT at the end!

This is my new favorite tempeh recipe. I cubed the tempeh and marinated it for 20 min changing the recipe by using regular OJ, with olive oil and double garlic and basil. Instead of steaming my kale, I oiled it and roasted it at 350 oven torn in pieces without stems, tossed in a tablespoon or so of olive oil until shriveled with crispy edges, not quite kale chips (left off the lemon juice). The tempeh I braised until most of the marinade was absorbed. The two textures and flavors were marvelous.

I enjoyed this. Instead of using tempeh, I made the glaze into a marinade and marinated tofu in it for about an hour then fried the tofu in peanut oil. It was delicious on the greens, the lemon was a key addition, and I served it all over quinoa.

I made this recipe with collard greens, not kale, and followed the recipe. This was my first time using tempeh, and I would make tempeh again. However, this got a low rating from me because of the sauce; it was way too orange-y. I would have liked this if i were more of a savory dish; maybe the tamari suggestion would be good.

My first intro to tempeh and I was impressed!

easy and oh-so-delicious! i cut the tempeh into smaller pieces and it absorbed all of the liquid, well flavored through each piece. i also seasoned the kale with a dash of tamari sauce, which went well with the slight sweetness.

This was a surprisingly tasty recipe. Someone else said they used cilantro instead of basil but I very much recommend sticking with the fresh basil. It goes well with the orange + balsamic. Deeeeelicious.

yeah, not very good. so, first thing: big slabs of tempeh don't pick up marinade very easily, so the flavor gets trapped in the outer layers. kale could use some independent seasoning, even if simply a dash of bragg's aminos (helped in my case). this dish just got me in trouble - had to whip up quesadillas as a last-second save for our family's dinner.

This was overall a very solid vegan dish... enjoyed by a non-vegetarian. I did, however, use 2/3 the Tempeh and well double the greens, and it was still very hearty. I also added some scallions just because I had them in the fridge. Yummy!

this was awesome!!! we make a lot of bbq tempeh and this was great way to change it up. we used cilantro instead of basil and fresh oj instead of concentrate. i will definitely be making this again!
