I love it when folks are brave and try something different. This was a different dish i tried it i liked it. I am also a Spamatic i was raised on it because we were poor and it made its way into many of my moms and grandmoms dishes. This was very innovative for a recipe and i proudly put it in my Recipe box. You dont have to be a snob to like a good dish. There are many more things out there worse for your health than Spam believe me. Good eats all round!!

People that would NEVER admit they ate spam loved this recipe. I always get compliments when I serve it.

Sometimes my life is a spam life. I LOVE SPAM! So this recipe was my life dream. Is there a rating higher than 4 forks? I wonder... How I love thee, let me count the ways,

Nothing ventured, nothing gained. I commend the San Francisco class for an inventive dish that made me think about Spam in a different way. Although I thought the dish was just okay, I can easily understand how others might enjoy it.

spam wusubi is my favorite college food and remains to this day, my favorite emergency comfort food! We certainly never made it as fancy as the recipe stated (no time to buy the sprouts in college) though. The KEY thing is to slice the spam very very thin and fry it on a stove top over medium heat until browned/crisp. Then you'd never know it's spam! The second key thing would be to roast the seaweed sheets over very low heat (hold it a few inches over the burner) until the seaweed crisp up a bit. Everything else is secondary.

Ok While I still think spam has it's best application in a Monty Python skit. I did try this sushi. I had a Hawaiian potluck. If you let the Spam marinate over night after cooking in the Shoyu then you would never know it was spam. It's not going to be my favorite, but it wasn't too bad.

My son loves spam and I made these for an after school snack. They were best when freshly assembled. After a day or two they weren't very appetizing. Next time I think I'll fry the spam and lose the sprouts. some pickled ginger would be good with this too.

I love this site because everyone can have their say. Spam musubi is truly comfort food, not gourmet stuff, and we know it. Kudos to those who tried it and didn't like it...at least you gave it a shot. My kids love it and so do I. Cheers!

I love SPAM and I love Sushi! This recipe is the logical conclusion of the convergence of the two! "Two great tastes that taste great together!" Incidently: Why would people who don't like and/or eat SPAM comment on a SPAM recipe? I suppose they had nothing better to do. FYI: There is Turkey SPAM and Lite SPAM if you want something lower in salt and fat. LOL!!

This is very much an Asian-style food. While not classy, it's certainly not unusual to see in Japanese or Hawaiian households.

Kids, as far as the sushi goes you're RIGHT ON TARGET. But the SPAM? How odd...

I didn't have any spam so I used ahi tuna instead. Really great:)

Those who are too scared to try new things, are the worse critics. Spam is not "trashing down" epicurious. I bet, those that knock SPAM have never tried it,and they consume plenty of hot dogs. What do you think hot dogs are made of? With this recipe, try using a sweet teriyaki sauce as a dipping sauce. It makes it more similar to Spam musubi. Kudos to epicurious for exploring!

This was very very good. BTW - Sushi is a term to describe the style (rice, nori, mirin...) that this is prepared in. Raw fish is not a pre-requisite for sushi. So there is no way to ruin sushi by using SPAM. Most asians will probably really really like this recipe. Some will find it almost poignant ;>

I made this as part of a Luau themed party, and had some people who lived in Hawaii attending. It was a big hit! Those who were hesitant of the SPAM just wrapped everything else. Radish sprouts are now a new favorite ingredient. All the SPAM strips were gone, I admit the Hawaii people were the most enthusiastic. I would definitly do this again, with a variety of ingredients

Spam and sushi are a superb combination! People from the East coast and Europe don't know a thing about food eaten in Asia and the Pacific. Spam musubi is enjoyed in Taiwan, Korea, Guam and even in California. It is particularly good with sliced carrots, cucumbers, egg (beaten & fried in a pan, then cut into strips) & daikon (pickled Japanese radish, which is yellow & can be bought at almost any Asian supermarket). Chow down sushi lovers!

You east coasters are such haters. This is classic Hawaiian soul food and it is good if it is made RIGHT! Maybe you should stay out of the kitchen...

What a way to ruin perfectly good sushi.

Although i love spam and sushi, i dont really think these two items go together very well. You definitley have to be adventourous to enjoy this combination.

i BEG my hawaiian friend to make spam musabi's! this recipe was very much like hers - careful, it may be an acquired taste- but then it is addictive!

Here in Hawaii. We call these handrolls Spam musbi and they're practically an institution. We eat them for a quick meal or snack. I found this receipe to be delicious.Maybe musubi is an acquired taste island style food. We make musubi with chicken, tuna, barbecued pork (char su) all sorts of delicious things. Maybe, for mainlanders, you might try making the musubi with plain rice not vinegared. Use medium grain rice a long grain like Uncle Ben's won't work. Aloha!

This is a treat for Hawaiians and Japanese-Americans! Made properly, it's tasty and filling. Made wrong, and the dish gets poor reviews. Even 7-Eleven in Hawaii can make excellent spam musubis (aka spamusubi). I agree, putting the dish down for children's level is not agreeable. That was just HIS dislike, not the entire adult population's.

I'm with Ray from Mass. I have one word for this: NASTY! I served it at a party and it was tasted then discarded. Never again.

We found this to be quite tasty and substantial. We also find this recipe is much better when "Armour Treat" is used in place of "Spam." It is a considerable improvement.

The correct name of the dish is spam musubi. It may not be a hit with ray's massachusetts friends, but plenty of japanese american children and adults, as well as many others, know spam musubi as delicious comfort food. you may not like it, but don't write it off as a kiddie novelty.

It may satisfy the tastes of five or six year olds but it does not work for adults. Served at a small party with several people present. Briefly nibbled on and then put down by guests. 90% of the batch I made left on serving platter at the end of evening.
