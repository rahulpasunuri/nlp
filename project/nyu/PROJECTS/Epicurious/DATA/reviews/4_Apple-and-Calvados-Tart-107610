Made it twice, and it came out beautiful both times. Next time I'm going to mix the apple sauce and most of the apples, but leave a few apples for the top. The crust is amazing and the apple jelly is a nice trick to show it off.

Absolutely delicious! I used Plugera butter for the the crust and it came out so light and flaky..worth the extra cost. Everyone loved it and it will definately be made again!

just perfect - I used Bourbon instead of Calvados since I did not have any and it was delicious. I baked the galette for 15 minutes longer than what the recipe called for.

Delicious and easy. The Calvados applesauce adds depth. I used Plugra in the butter crust, and it was worth the splurge.

Extraordinary dessert--my guests all took some home. I followed almost exactly, but I also used the pre-fab crust, which comes rolled out in such a nice, neat circle. It really made it easy. Then, instead of apple jelly, I drizzled some warm pacan caramel sauce over it--it looked nice too. Fantastic dessert for the fall-winter.

Excellent!!! I made 1 1/2 the applesauce, just right, also increase the cooking time to 60 minutes. Terrific!

Very good! Much of the prep can be done ahead of time. In the Calvados whipped cream I added almond extract and a bit more sugar...everyone loved it! My only issue was that I didn't roll the dough out thin enough so it was a bit thick.

This was very good, especially with the applesauce and the whipped cream. Had a little trouble with the dough; it started to open while baking and it was leaking out. I rolled up paper towels and put around while baking to avoid spilling. A friend has a similar recipe which calls for the dough to be put in a pie plate and then just folded over the top of the apples. I might try that next time.

Great recipe! If you don't have calvados use amaretto instead. I have made it with both and was still delicious. Such a beutiful rustic tart.

This is a lovely dessert to be served after a meal of beef stew or other such dishes. While the flavor is very sophisticated, the presentation is rustic and comforting.

I did not alter the recipe but will try the ginger preserves another time. This has been such a popular recipe with family and guests that I make it in batches. I make and freeze the pastry and applesauce in portion sized containers. I have made up to 4 tarts this way. If I know preparation time is going to be tight, I freeze the pastry already rolled out. You cant go wrong on the way it looks!

I cheated and used premade pie crust, and was still really good. The applesauce component caught my eye, and was a truly great addition to this apple tart. I didn't have Calvados, but the dish didn't seem to need it anyway. Without making the crust, it was easy to make at the last minute. Delicious!

This was delicious! The crust came out flaky and perfect. I loved the Calvados flavor, in fact I might add just a bit more next time. The rustic look of this tart made it very forgiving. I can't wait to make it again. I got rave reviews from my guests.

I've made this tart several times, always to great reviews. I had forgotten about this one, but it came up as I research dessert options for Thanksgiving. This will certianly be one of the desserts I serve this Thursday. For the kids sake, I do omit the calvados.

Sorry to be the dissenting voice here, but this tart was a big disappointment. Very low on flavor, none of the promised richness from the Calvados...nothing. The presentation was beautiful and the butter crust was good, but the dessert tasted entirely unremarkable.

This tart is fantastic. My guests raved about it. It was easy to make and tasted superb. You can really impress your guests if you arrange your apple slices in an interesting pattern!

Great recipe. Mine did not look as nice as the picture but it was great. I would make it again but would add fewer apples since I think it made the bottom a bit soggy.

Rating: 4
Definitely a holiday keeper! Crust was flakey, buttery and delicious; applesauce is actually a recipe to use alone---sooo tasty! When I assembled the tart, I thought to myself, "What a thing of beauty!" It was a delicious end to our Thanksgiving and I'm already planning when I'll make it next. Worth the effort, especially when the cook pours oneself a nice hot cider with Calvados!

Very good. The crust was good, not great, next time I may try it with the Flaky Pie Crust on this site. I made everything (applesauce, crust, filling) in one day, but the applesauce and crust can definitely be made in advance to save time on the day you serve it.

Perfect dessert. I have made this tart and the sauce 6 times and always a huge hit! I didn't try this pastry dough as I always use Julia Child's butter pastry dough recipe and it never fails me.

Rating: 4
Amazing. I followed to the letter except for subbing TJ's ginger preserves for the apple jelly glaze. The hint of ginger was very nice. The key, though, was to cook the applesauce until caramelized and amber in color. That really made the tart scrumptiously rich and complex.

I've made this twice and it's been a hit each time. A bit time consuming but not difficult. I'll definitely make it again.

Made this exactly according to the recipe for a French dinner party. The pastry was spectacular. Will definitely add to the recipe box.

So good! Have made it twice already. I didn't have calvados, but substituted with a fancy cognac instead - only in the applesauce. I didn't use the recipe for the pie crust though - I use the basic flaky pie dough recipe from this site instead. Amazing!

I used arkansas blacks and madiera for the applesauce and cut up pippins instead of galas. We made creme fraiche with just some vanilla and sugar. It was fabulous! The crust is wonderful, and the whole thing was easy to make.

Fabulous recipe! I have made this many times over the past 3 years and it turns out great each time. I cut back the Calvados in the whipped cream as it is a bit strong for my taste and make no other changes to the recipe. The presentation is very striking and makes you look like you've slaved all day. This is one of my favorite recipes.

Absolutely wonderful. I didn't have time to deal with the apple jelly at the last minute; otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter, even the butter. I would make the apple sauce by itself again...wonderful!

I loved this recipe... I made it quite a while ago... my quation is, can you use the dough recipe to make a fruit pie (such as blueberry) has anyone tried this?

Rating: 4
WOW!!! I *really* don't ever bake, and so it was with enormous pride that I received all the gushing praise on this one. It's not bland at all, but lovely and delicous. Confession: I was too much of a wimp to attempt homemade dough, so I used the Pillsbury pie crust (not the frozen one; the one in the red box that's folded in quarters) -- and everyone *raved* about the crust! I will never again have shame about my fear of mixing flour, butter and water. I used a nice cognac, having no Calvados on hand, and even forgot the whipped cream(!) and it STILL brought down the house. Hands-down the best dessert I've ever made.

I have made this tart twice, and both times I received some of the highest compliments I've EVER received (and I cook a lot for friends and family). Not only are the flavors pungent, but the presentation is absolutely beautiful; a prettier or more photogenic tart would be hard to find. It is well worth it to spend the extra $ on a botle of Clavados, b/c the depth of flavor this gives to the applesauce base is essential. The only addition: I sprinkled the outside crust with a large-grain sugar (like "Sugar in the Raw") to give a sweeter note and a more rustic textur and appearance. I thought it worked well and will do this again in the future. This is definitely going in the "Top Ten" file. Even my Aunt Rosemary, the undisputed Apple Pie master of the family, had to admit defeat to this beauty.

I cannot tell you how good this recipe is! It won rave reviews at Thanksgiving. The crust was the flakiest I've ever made! I had read all the good reviews, but was still amazed that I was able to achieve the same results. I used the plugra butter and really believe that it made a difference! So simple and so yummy!

While this tart is a thing of beauty, I found it bland. I might go with a more flavorful, tart apple, like granny smith.

The tart was delicious, was beautiful to look at and was a hit with everyone. I took it to a french-themed dinner party where I knew one of the attendees wasn't wild about the taste of almond extract, so I halved the almond extract amount and replaced it with vanilla. It still had an almond flavor, but was more subtle than I imagine the original would have tasted. As others have mentioned, the crust dough was very difficult to work with. I avoided the potential sticking problem during roll out by rolling it out on plastic wrap, flipping it over into the pan and then carefully removing the wrap. Any place the dough touched the lightly floured surface suggested in the recipe it stuck horribly, so this turned out to be a good solution.

Made this tart for dinner with Friends. Straight forward recipe. After reading reviews I used Land of Lakes extra creamy butter for the crust Very tasty & pretty. The amount of Calvados in the whipped cream was WAY TOO much!! I would cut the amount in half at the very least.

An exquisite and impressive-looking dessert--perfect for a dinner party. The spiked whipped cream complements the tart beautifully. I used regular brandy and was so thrilled with the results that I'm going to spring for the Calvados next time!

This is now a favorite apple recipe around here! If you are wondering whether or not it's worth it to use a few tablespoons of Calvados brandy -- well it IS! And Amaretto, or rum, or 'plain' brandy substitute well. The piecrust and the applesauce are easy to make ahead, keeping preparation simple. Enjoy!

This was amazing! Would make it again and again! Used Calvados as directed and loved it...also served with coffee with a dash of Calvados. Yumm! In fact, I made the entire French Connection Menu. It was the best menu I have made out of Gourmet yet.

I agree. This is the greatest apple dessert ever. I have made it numerous times with great success. I can't find gala apples here in Hungary, so I use granny smith apples and they work beautifully. I add 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamon to the sliced apples and sprinkle graham cracker crumbs on the bottom of the pastry dough before laying down the apple sauce. I prefer straight brandy to calvados for the whipped cream addition. Many thanks to the creator of this wonderful dessert.

Won raves at a gourmet club dinner. Could make it oblong-shaped if you don't have a wide baking sheet. Active prep time was more than 45 minutes, but it's an easy and forgiving recipe. I also couldn't find apple jelly, used crabapple and maybe liked better.

I have made this recipie several times. It is by far the best apple dessert I have even made or eaten. My guests continually love it. It is such a bonus that you can be make it ahead. I serve it with Calvados and it matches perfectly.

What an excellent dessert! Served for New Years Eve and the rave reviews were astounding. Added 1-1/2 t baking powder to pastry and it was a perfect flaky crust. It actually looked like the picture! Would cut the Calvados in 1/2 in the whipped cream though - a bit too strong for all our tastes. Definitely make applesauce in advance for easy prep when assembling. Used mandoline for apples which was a bit messy but the thickness was fine. Fabulous recipe!!

This is wonderful. Everyone loved it. The spiked whipped cream is a must. Since we aren't brandy drinkers, I couldn't justify the cost of Calvados for the 3 1/2 Tablespoons needed so I used regular brandy. It tasted great. Definitely worth the effort.

I usually don't attempt this type of recipe, but did so for some friends' joint birthdays. It was a hugh hit - everyone had seconds - and I found it easy to do. The All-Butter Pastry Dough is wonderful! Follow the instructions and use Plugra butter - you won't be sorry.

Scrap the pastry and the sliced apples. I could just eat the applesauce all day!!

This was a huge hit, particularly with the spiked whipped cream! I did not have Calvados, so I used Applejack, both in the applesauce and in the whipped cream, and it worked out beautifully. I also put the tart back in the oven for about 5 minutes after I coated it with the apple jelly. This recipe was not terribly difficult, but it definitely took me more than the 45 minutes described as "Active Time". Next time I will make the applesauce and the dough in advance.

DELICIOUS AND VERY EASY TO MAKE. I HAD TO SUBSTITUTE RED CURRANT JELLY FOR THE APPLE JELLY WHICH I COULD NOT FIND. I LIKE THE FACT THAT THE APPLE SAUCE AND PIE DOUGH CAN BE PREPARED DAYS AHEAD.
