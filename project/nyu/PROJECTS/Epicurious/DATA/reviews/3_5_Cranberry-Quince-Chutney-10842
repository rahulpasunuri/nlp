I stewed quince in my crock pot (no added sugar) and used in place of the preserves. Next time I'd use less salt and less vinegar. The flavors seemed a bit harsh at first but improved over time.

I adore this chutney and look forward all year to making again for Thanksgiving. I should keep it in mind to go with poultry, or cheese. It has a very nice alluring balance of sweet and tangy w/ complexity. I use quince preserves. I also make a more traditional cranberry relish, but this is a real treat for the more sophisticated palate.

I made this for Thanksgiving with high expectations that were not fulfilled. I missed my great-grandmother's wonderful jellied cranberry mold. Maybe I should have made them both. A little goes a long way. It is good with cheese for an appetizer.

Very easy, this chutney goes very well with mild cheeses....

I LOVE this cranberry dish -- many layers of flavor with more complexity than other cranberry relishes, and look forward happily to making again this thanksgiving. I served this along with the triple-cranberry sauce from this site (for the more timid/traditionalists), which is also complex though more traditional.

I've been making this since I saw the recipe in Gourmet in 1994. I've tried making other cranberry relishes and I've eaten other cranberry relishes, but I've decided that this is unequivocally the best. It has the sweetness you want for the sake of tradition, but the sugar is balanced by the vinegar and the complexity of the other ingredients keeps it interesting. My friends and family agree.

We have had this fabulous chutney long before Epicurious entered our kitchen's must-haves, and loved it every year at Thanksgiving and beyond. It's rich and delicious. One batch goes a long way

Quite nice but with the apple jelly a little artifical tasting for my liking. Family liked it though. Has a nice bit of spiciness.

Perfect Holiday side dish: Spicey/sweet, yet tart on the aftertaste with the definite aroma of citrus. Hints at extravagence to guests, yet very easy to make. Very compatible with smoked poultry or game meat. PS: Quince preserves are easier to get in markets now than when the recipe first appeared in Gourmet in the 1

This is a nice chutney. The only substitution I made was currants instead of raisins- which worked really well. When I make it again, I will reduce the mustard seed by half (it was very strong) and take another reviewers suggestion of substituting orange marmalade for the quince preserves.

I have also made this recipe every year since 1994; it is always a big hit. I use orange marmalade instead of quince and it is just wonderful. Give up that canned stuff and try this.

First made this in 1994 - it is so delicious that we make it for TG & Xmas almost every year. My handprinted copy (my mother-in-law had the original magazine) was disintegrating, so I was thrilled to find this online, along with the prune-apple-potato stuffing. Great on turkey sandwiches; lasts a long time tightly covered in refrigerator.
