Wonderful! Quick and easy! Use unsalted butter, may not need to add salt. I put a light squeeze of the fresh lemon into it. I have made this many times since I read it in Bon Appetit and received rave reviews guests and party goers. I serve it with french bread rounds. Have the baguette sliced at the bakery or store for even slices and easy work. Garnish with a sprig or two of rosemary.

Left out the green onion and didn't miss it... It was great over hot pasta.

I've been looking for something easy to whip together that I can take along to gatherings, and this is going to be great! I've already tried a fingerful or two, and I can't wait 'til this afternoon so I can dig in. I used a little more green onion, rosemary and lemon than called for, and I sprinkled generously with black pepper. Will definitely do this again.

For feta lovers, this is a tasty change from the ordinary. I have made it repeatedly. I serve it with toasted pita bread.

I didn't love this and I used all fresh ingredients. Just not worth the effort.

Learn from my mistake - DO NOT use regular butter in place of unsalted. It makes the dish VERY salty, especially when combined with feta cheese. We served it with pumpernickel bread, (something I would strongly recommend) because this is a powerful taste that works best with breads and shouldn't be combined with salty crackers.
