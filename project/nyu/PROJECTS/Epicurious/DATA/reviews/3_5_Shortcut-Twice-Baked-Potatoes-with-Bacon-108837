I sauté some chopped onion, green pepper & mushrooms to add with sour cream (I sub sour cream for the milk), butter, greek seasoning, salt & pepper. I also line the bottom of the scooped out potatoes with grated cheese before I put the filling back in. After baking at 400 deg. for 20 minutes or until the potatoes are a nice golden brown then I sprinkle grated cheese over the top of the potatoes and continue baking until the cheese is melted and starts to turn a light brown. You can also add chopped ham, bacon or even roast beef if you like but I just like the onions, green peppers & mushrooms. This is absolutely my favorite side dish for almost any grilled meat dish especially steaks & really thick cut pork chops. If I add the chopped meat I can make a meal out of just this twice baked potatoe dish with a nice salad.

the shortcut tips convinced me to try twice-baked potatoes for the first time. i used 1.5 tbsp butter, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 tbsp strong horseradish cream, chives & 2 tbsp bacon for 5 large russets and they turned out to be the perfect accompaniment for a steak dinner. guess it's kinda hard to go really wrong with butter, cream, bacon & potatoes ;)

So easy and you can do it for every day meals and fancy enough for a special dinner. I added some grated four cheese mix. I was roasting a prime rib at 325 degrees so I just put the stuffed potatoes in the oven with it for the last 30 minutes and then after I removed the roast I put the temp up to 400 while the roast rested for 10 minutes. They came out perfect! This recipe is a keeper.

Everyone loved loved love this dish. I did put a little bit more milk and some shredded cheese to it, and tt still came out perfect.

Yummy! Try adding some grated assagio cheese to the potatoes when you mash them, then add a bit to the top when you have about 6 minutes left to bake... will come out golden and crispy on top with a nice cheese element.

I cut down the milk and added ranch dressing, italian seasoning, garlic powder, and cheese. Much more flavor!

Excellent twice-baked recipe. Made this as a compliment to a pot roast recipe. I cut the butter amount to just 2 tablesoons and baked the potatoes for 50 minutes at 400, instead of microwaving.
