Good recipe. I agree with that review that suggest cutting the onions into smaller piece. Also, adjust the amount of milk and butter according to the consistency you want.

I've had parsnip mashed potatoes before & they were delish. I was hoping from the reviews that this might be it & made them for Christmas dinner. The caramelised onions overpowered the potatoes & it was lacking something. Everyone ate them, but no one went for 2nds or raved about them.

Excellent recipe! The sweetness of the onion and the parsnip made these mashed potatoes special. The texture of the potatoes was a little more liquidy than I am used to, and it made it seem like the potatoes were lighter (even though I know that is not true because of all the butter and cream!).

Great recipe! Like others have said, you would be wise to finely chop or mince the onions. Also, using half of the amount of milk and substituting with cream worked well. Finally, you will not go wrong by substituting the Russet potatoes with Buttercream or fingerling potatoes.

These were very good. We paired with a pork roast at Christmas. The roast had a wonderful cranberry sauce, but we needed a mashed potato dish that could stand on its own (not as just a place to put your gravy). The sweet hint of onions and the flavor of the parsnips was a perfect match with the sweet-tangy cranberry sauce. My nieces had never actually had parsnip, and were dubious at first, but wound up having seconds. I may never make mashed potatoes without parsnips again. I've added them to my winter garden so I'll have a good supply.

So easy and delicious! I added some carrots I had which added some brightness to the dish. I also mashed roughly to leave some texture. I too put the fresh rosemary in some cheesecloth and removed it after boiling. The rosemary is more an essence than an overpowering taste. Instead of milk I used heavy cream, but only 1/2 cup and it was rich but not too rich. (note: this is coming from someone who never cooks with cream!) I've tried eliminating milk/cream/butter from potato recipes before and they always end up mealy and dry. This recipe is a keeper!

I didn't know mashed potatoes could be this good! Used half and half instead of milk and also seasoned with pepper and a little Lawry's. This is by far the best potato recipe I've ever tasted! The parnips and rosemary give it such great flavor. Will make again and again.

I've made some incredible mashed potato recipes from Epicurious, but these take the cake -- they are unlike any mashed potatoes I've had. The onions give them this surprising hint of sweetness. I did however make some changes -- i added in about 1/2 cup of mascarpone cheese (heavenly in any mashed potato recipe) and used only about 1/2 the milk. And next time, I would give the onions a rough chop -- the long slices made for stringy potatoes!

This was an excellent side. Make extra -- it's even better left over, and especially yummy fried to golden brown for breakfast.

Delicious! I didn't have enough potatoes on hand (used yukons) so I added a sweet potato. I also forgot to add the Rosemary. Family didn't miss it. Will make it again. I don't think it needed all of that butter either.

I forgot the rosemary - would have been good. used half each parsnips and red potatoes, added carmelized onions and a roasted head of garlic. used a bit of heavy cream, less butter instead of the heated milk. excellent.

This dish was such a hit at a party last winter. Much better than plain old potatoes!

I didn't rate the recipe, as I made it without parsnips (didn't have any on hand). I added garlic to the onions when I put them in the pan, did half milk, half vegetable broth, and reduced the amount of butter. Came out delicious! Can't wait to make it again with parsnips and fresh rosemary.

Great taste, great hit, easy to make.

Fabulous! I made these on Thanksgiving-- everyone raved and couldn't get enough. I took the advice of another review & added two sprigs of rosemary in a cheesecloth bag to the boiling water. I also used half milk, half heavy cream when mashing. These were a delicious compliment to my menu and so easy to make. Definetly try them!

I'm not a big fan of potatoes but this was great. I used a little half and half instead of milk and then did not add any more butter to the potatoes - there was enough from carmelizing the onions. This is also very good the next morning crisped up in a fry pan. I added the rosemary during the boiling stage and wished I'd put the sprigs in a cheesecloth bag since the leaves fall off. I just found them a little unpleasing aesthetically - texture was fine.

Yummy and easy! A hint on how not to use too much rosemary -- just put a sprig into the water in which you are boiling the potatoes -- then remove it prior to draining and mashing!

Used this recipe to top a shepherds pie. Was truly delicious. Did not need to use as much butter as called for.

Delicious alternative to traditional mashed potatoes (although I happen to love traditional mashed potatoes, so I'm not often looking for alternatives). They were scarfed up at a recent family dinner.

I served these potatoes with the Pistachio Crusted Pork Tenderloin with Plum Sauce. I did improvise the recipe to give it more of an asian slant to match with the pork. I added a dash of sesame oil along with the butter, and used coconut milk in place of the regular milk. I do plan on making this again per the recipe. Another review to come.

Fantastic! Don't overdo it with the rosemary, especially if you use fresh. Add lots of salt. (Did I say that?) This stuff is divine.

these potatoes were a great success - easy to make and so tasty. We served them with lamb and they were really excellent - will definitely do them again.

These mashed potatoes were excellent! The parsnips add a fresh, tangy flavor while the caramelized onions and rosemary (I recommend fresh if possible) perfectly compliment each other and the potatoes. As easy to make as any mashed potatoes, but much better. I highly recommend them.
