This was quite good for dinner with a light salad. I made a few changes as follows: I didn't toast one side of the bread first. After baking a par-baked baguette and letting it mostly cool, I split it top and bottom (instead of slicing). I then used between 1.5-2 tsp. of the mustard on each slice. I felt that bit more was needed so the flavor wouldn't be obscured. The measurement is an estimate--I tried to have a nice layer on each segment--not too thick or too thin. I also broiled it a bit past the melting point, until it was nice and bubbly.

Simple, and a good opportunity to use Le Raclette without one of those expensive Raclette pans...

I was disappointed by this recipe. I've made something similar w/brie and dijon on a baguette that was much nicer. I thought the raclette's flavor was diminished by the other ingredients.

Was very easy and the results were fine. I suppose I would try this again with the leek soup. What is an American equivilent to raclette? E me, thanks.

Killer! Great with soups. I tried it with other cheeses (imported Gruyere, Asiago) and with and without mustard. Lovely!
