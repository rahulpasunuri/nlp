We've got a bunch of venison in our freezer from my brother-in-law. Now I usually love venison, but everytime I open a package, I FIND FUR ON IT! Ew. This recipe totally helped me get over the ick factor. It was wonderful, even the kids loved it. My husband, who grew up on game, said it may have been the best venison he's had. I didn't have the mushrooms, and used 1 tablespoon of soy sauce instead to get that umami flavor, worked just fine.
