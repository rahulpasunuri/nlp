Do NOT skip the pickled onions! Made this twice now and the bowl has been scraped clean both times (who needs a longer shelf life when it's gone within an hour of serving?)

Make with good mayonnaise, Dukes or Hellmans, regular or low calorie, and remove the onions. You will then have a four fork product with a much longer refrigerator life.

I think this was good but nothing special. Added a dash of worcestershire to it for more depth. My go-to blue cheese dip recipe is the Roquefort Dip in the Silver Palate cookbook..seriously good and clients always love.
