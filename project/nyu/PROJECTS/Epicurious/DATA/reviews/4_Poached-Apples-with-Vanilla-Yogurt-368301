I think this is a great-tasting recipe that requires relatively modest effort. My gf and I both loved it. I would agree with other reviewers in that you should cook the apples a bit less than the recipe calls for or they will fall apart, and I also agree that the sugar could be reduced a bit. Overall very tasty and beautiful presentation!

Hey Accola56...enlarge the picture by clicking on it in the recipe. The apple is DEFINITELY peeled. It's just completely taken on the color of the wine.

Loved. I didn't have enough red wine, so I mixed red, white, water, and balsamic vinegar together along with only a small amount of sugar, and juice from half an orange. I seasoned this with cinnamon and nutmeg as well as one star anise. The magic comes when everything has cooked down! Caramel wine over a baked apple! Yum. Will definitely make again.

The best poached fruit recipe ever! I had to substitute a bit due to the fact that I didn't have any orange juice or orange peel. I used all lemon peel instead, cranberry juice for the tartness of the orange and threw the deseeded vanilla pod into the syrup which upped the vanilla quotient beautifully. I used homemade non-greek yogurt but it was still excellent.

sorry, haven't made this, but have a question for those who have. the recipe calls for apples that have been peeled and cored, but the photo looks like neither have been done. did you peel apples or not?

I made this the other night for my girlfriend and I. We were both impressed, decadent and beautiful! You have to be careful with the apples, maybe cook them a few minutes less than what was called for, otherwise the fall apart and look bad. Handle them carefully during poaching as well. It took 2 or 3 times longer to reduce the sauce to a syrup than listed, so be sure to prop the apples up against each other so they do not break apart while waiting that long. Also, I would cut the sugar down, as this is a VERY sweet dessert. Overall a great dessert to serve to guests.

Loved this recipe. Very easy and great presentation. I walked away during poaching and came back to boiling liquid. The apples split open making unattractive presentation. Was this because of the boiling?

Well, well, well. What a little beauty! Not only is the dessert gorgeous to look at it is a pleasure to make. Too easy! I served it last night to girlfriends and they loved it. One said that she doesn't normally like fruit for dessert but she raved about it and wanted the recipe. The only thing I'll do differently next time is swap either allspice or clove for the star anise--I'm just not a fan. Can't wait to make this again!
