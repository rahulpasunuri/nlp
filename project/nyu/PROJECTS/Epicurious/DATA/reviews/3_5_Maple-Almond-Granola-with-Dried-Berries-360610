Fantastic recipe that has become my go-to for homemade granola, which is the ONLY way to go. I add molasses, a heavy splash, which gives it some dark smokiness that is tasty. If you're on a fitness regimen, sprinkle a little on some low/no-fat yogurt to satisfy your sweet tooth.

Excellent granola recipe that needs no modifications. I love the extracts and now all other granola seems bland to me. And this leaves the house smelling so good! This one is a keeper!

Love it! I halved the recipe since I didn't want to make such a large amount. I reduced the oil by half but kept everything else the same. This comes together quickly and I love the flavor the extracts give. I might up the syrup or try a mix of maple and honey to see if I can get more clumping for easier snacking. Great recipe that I will keep coming back to.

Made the recipe exactly as written, using a combination of dried blueberries and cranberries. The granola is tasty and not too sweet, (the sea salt was a particularly nice touch) though not as exciting as some; I appreciate a recipe that gives good results with minimal effort.
