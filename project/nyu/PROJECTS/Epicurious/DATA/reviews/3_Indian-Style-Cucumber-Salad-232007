Calling this a salad is a misnomer. It is a condiment called Raita. Admittedly, this is a pared down version...usually other typical Indian spices are also included in the mixture. It's supposed to be on the thin side in terms of creaminess. Use it on top of grilled meats as a condiment. It is excellent with lamb.

We made this recipie last night, I found it too cuminy. I guess on second look, the title say's it all - Indian-Style. We live in Delhi, and I wouldn't describe this as particularly indian - other than the fact that it is yogurt/curd based.

I loved the spicy, yogurty, cool cucumberness of this salad. I have adjusted the cumin seeds to 1/2 a teaspoon and use fat free plain yogurt. It is one of my families favorites as it balances a yummy spicy curry.

I use Fage greek yogurt and I do not use the seeds but rather the cumin powder and the is a year round staple for me.

My husband is Kenyan and cooks alot of indo-african foods. This recipe is exactly the one I was looking for. We have many friends from India and eat at their homes often - this is the salad they make-- and the way they make it. It is supposed to be "floating" in yogart- and should sit an hour or so. The only thing I did different was- instead of cubes I used very thin slices and went lite on the cilantro. It was perfect.

too much yogurt and cilantro. I agree with the other reviewers. Too many other good cucumber recipies.

I have made this salad and would suggest the following: Dry Roast equal quantities of cumin and coriander seeds and 1-2 dry cayenne pepper. Run the roasted spices through a spice mill and use this blend to season instead.

I felt that this called for too much yogurt and cilantro - my cucumber was just swimming. I also used ground cumin because that's what I had on hand. I wouldn't make this again for myself, but my boyfriend loved it, so I will probably make it again for him.

Too many other cucumber recipes out there which are better. Would not make again.

This was just "okay" as written. I think if I was motivated to make this again, I would use cumin powder for a more intense flavor. To the cook on 04/28/05, how can you give this recipe 3 forks based on how it looks? Shouldn't you try it BEFORE you rate it?

I have already made this twice and I know I will make it again. I completely agree about the Greek yogurt from Trader Joe's - delicious! When I attempted to make this for the second time, I realized that I was out of cilantro. This was after chopping the cuke and salting it. I put my cukes in a ziploc and made the salad the next day after I got more cilantro. It still was very good. BTW, I know many of us hate it when people make substitutions and talk about how great their own version was, but here goes - I couldn't find cumin seeds so I had to substitute cumin powder. I thought it was still very tasty.

Easy and tasty recipe. Good to balance spicy foods. I used nonfat plain yogurt and it was still good but possibly not the correct consistency.

Looks yummy; I haven't made it ... Just wanted to let folks know that you can get Greek yogert (I'm pretty sure the Greek Fage Total yogurt) at Trader Joe's stores.

I absolutely agree about using FAGE Total Greek Yogurt but I prefer the full fat - it is the very best plain yogurt to be found.

I agree with 'potluck'. I've been cooking Indian for 25 years and make up raitas all the time. When I saw this recipe I thought great- something new for my guests this Sat. night as I am planning an Indian dinner which we absolutely love. I was disappointed to see that Epicurious put in such a basic recipe alone as a feature. Perhaps had they put it with an interesting hot curry recipe -then it would be appropriate for those who are not as familiar with Indian cuisine.

I have not tried this but know all the ingredients would make it as it should be. However, if no one has tried the Greek Fage Total yogurt, you had best find it and you will be amazed. The 0% fat version is wonderfully thick and creamy and never seems to break down.

In Indian cuisine, this dish is called "raita" and is a staple of the curry table...hard to believe this rates an email from Epicurious.

Indian Cucumber Salad is good with whole milk yogurt. (Try not to use low-fat yogurt as it's too runny). I have first blanched the cucumbers for a couple of minutes before adding them to the yogurt which makes them a softer consistency, Also, I use black mustard seeds that are sauteed in walnut oil for about 2-5 minutes until they start to lighten in color. Immediately removing the mustard seeds and oil from the heat and mixing it together with the yogurt--Allow the mixture to blend for about an hour. The flavors will come alive yet they are mild... and a nice complement to a meal. Season with a little bit of Jerusalem Salt.
