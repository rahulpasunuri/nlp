I'd love to find out where one can buy passion fruit juice

Excellent and so easy. I mixed everything in a quart measuring cup and poured it into the ice cream maker. Almost as good as the passionfruit nieves in Oaxaca, Mexico!

I made this recipe the way it's supposed to be: with passion fruit nectar. It is easy and delicious. Loved by kids and adults. A great tropical treat!

Beautiful flavor! I made mango with a little orange and pineapple juice to give it some tang. Also used sugar disolved in a little hot water instead of corn syrup and added about a tsp. of cornstarch (as recommended in other recipes) VERY refreshing and better for you than ice cream. Also trying pina colada as well. EASY EASY EASY to make!

I tried this recipie with mango necter instead if passion-fruit. I chose a really delicous brand of juce and OULA! It tasted just as good. It was a really simple recipie and wonderful right out of the ice cream maker. My only complaits are that it took at little bit too long to freeze, and that it was extreamly hard strait from the freezer.
