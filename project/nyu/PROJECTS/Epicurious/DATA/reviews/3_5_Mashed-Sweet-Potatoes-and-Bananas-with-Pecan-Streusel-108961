Great recipe. It is very sweet and calls for a lot of butter. The recipe is great for special occasions like Thanksgiving, and is a large dish, with plenty to go around. In my everyday cooking I will use a modified version of this recipe, because the sweet potatoes and bananas are to die for, but I can't justify the butter all the time! The husband and guests love this one!

Yum yum yum the bananas add so much to the sweet potatos. I had a little bit of trouble with the topping.

This is a family favorite. We make it every year. Not overly sweet and the bananas add a nice dimension.

This is my new holiday side dish. I normally don't do sweet potatoes for my family because they insist they will only eat the ones from a can topped with marshmallows (sigh). But I saw this recipe and I thought it just might work. I too cut down on the sugar and it was still very sweet but that is a good thing with my family. The bananas gave it healthy sweetness. They had no idea they were eating something that might be gasp "good for them"!

I love this dish. I'm not usually one for sweets and prefer my sweet potatoes just baked. I made it for a brunch on New Year's Day and it was devoured. It was easy to make (though I was at first worried when I saw how slimy the bananas are after roasting). Definitely recommended!

Excellent side dish, although my family said it could have been dessert, because it's so sweet. Definitely a keeper to make for special occasions.

We made this for Christmas 2004 and it was delicious. My husband loved it and he is going to make it with Christmas dinner this year. We also had it with Easter dinner this past year. Absolutely terrific!

I made these for Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved them. They were fabulous! I wasn't sure about the bananas at first, but decided to try something different since sweet potatoes aren't usually my favorite. We will definately have these every year!

I almost didn't make sweet potatoes this Thanksgiving because no one ever eats them. But they did this year -- we had just enough left over for the two of us to enjoy the next day. These are amazing and delicious. A keeper for all future Thanksgiving. Today, I'm taking the concept and turning it into a sweet potato/banana pie.

I would bake the sweet potatoes until really soft to touch. Really a big hit with our Turkey Dinner this year.

I really just use the streusel part of the recipe, leave out the bananas, and cut way back on the honey and butter, but it beats the heck out of that goopy stuff with marshmellows!!!!!

Husband loved it, but to me it seemed like something you served to children trying to get them to eat their vegetables. Really sweet, even cutting down on sugars.

While I only rated this a two-fork recipe, I would like to try it again as I like the idea of adding banana to sweet potatoes. However I would reduce the amount of butter as it seemed too greasy for my taste.

I have made these several times. First time I followed recipe exactly and they were great, but like others said bananas were a little overwhelming. This last time I made for womens luncheon and everyone wanted recipe. I used some leftover baked sweet potatos and added some canned yams, no bananas, pureed in food processor. Consistency was smooth and creamy. I also put all streusel ingredients in zip lock bag to combine. You can tell when it is combined when it starts to pull away from the sides. Made it all day before.

This was a fantastic recipe. I made this for Thanksgiving and it was the first (and only) dish totally finished. Pretty easy to make and it was fun to tell people about the secret ingredient (bananas). I've sent this recipe out to lots of people and they are all dieing to make this.

I made this last weekend for a holiday party and it was a hit. Many people asked for the recipe. I thought it was a little stiff. Next time I make it I will try boiling the sweet potatoes rather than baking, because they seemed to dry out.

Rating: 3
The next time I make this I will use only 2 bananas instead of 4. Some at our Thanksgiving dinner liked this, especially those who said they normally don't care for sweet potatoes, but most said the banana flavor was too strong. Sweet enough for dessert.

Novel sweet potato dish for Thanksgiving! It's a keeper! Tha banana is a great addition. Great make-ahead

Nice alternative to the "usual" sweet pot dish. It was interesting. My guests loved it, but my kids did not. (I think the banana thing was too wierd for them!) I suggest making the mashed part the day before. Scooping out the pots is a little time consuming.

This was a neat taste. I enjoyed adding yet another variation to sweet potatoes. I will find a way to make it fluffier next time, this was a bit thick and heavy.

Weird. It is quite sweet, and the banana / sweet potato mix is a real novelty. But my guests didn't go back for seconds.

This was pretty good. I liked the combination of the bananas and sweet potatoes. I made this as a side dish for Christmas dinner and it was a hit. I would probably make it again, but only during the holidays.

I din't make this yet but, I've made something very similar where I boiled the sweet potatoes (peeled and cubed) and drained. Then added 1 banana, butter, a little sugar, milk, nutmeg, and sometimes a little toasted coconut. It is a sweet dish but it has a great taste (very Carribean). Looking forward to trying this version soon.

I did not think this was going to be good but boy was I wrong. The combination of the sweet potatoes, bananas, and streusel topping was delicious. A great addition to any Thanksgiving meal!
