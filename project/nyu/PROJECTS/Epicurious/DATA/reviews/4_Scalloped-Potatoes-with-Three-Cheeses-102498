This was the second time that I have made this dish, but this time I did use the blue cheese, and it was wonderful. Instead of whole milk, I substituted half 1% milk and half fat-free half and half. I also used more onion than called for. Other than that I pretty much followed the directions to the end when I added more cheese to the reserved cheese to put on top and then removed the uncovered dish from the oven after a 1/2 hour, not 45 minutes. This dish was a big hit with our Easter ham and the leftovers were just as good.

I don't doubt that I have tried dozens of Scalloped Potatoe recipes over the years, and have always found myself disappointed by the results. At long last the search is over. These were perfect. I made them pretty much as written, except since no one in my family is a big fan of Blue Cheese, I substituted Gruyere in it's place. I was a bit doubtful about just tossing the raw onions and flour over the first layer of potatoes, but it turned out remarkable. I did use the butter as the recipe called for, but I can imagine that it is not necessary and will probably do without it or use less next time. Do not wait to try these gems!

Great Easter side dish! I used fontina, asiago, and cheddar cheese. I also added fresh thyme and scallions. I did cook it the two hours prior and it reheated wonderfully!

Excellent recipe but would make a few changes. I would eliminate the butter - not needed and makes the dish a little oily. I would only use a pinch of salt because the cheeses are already salty. Otherwise, I LOVED it and so did my company. Makes a TON! Oh, I also used more blue cheese too.

DELICIOUS and EASY!!!! Thanks to the reviewers who suggested sauteeing the onions (and using more) and making a roux (and using less butter). Worked beautifully! Rather than chopping, I sliced the onions very thinly, and used a mandolin to slice the potatoes, so the total preparation time was very brief. The recipe is also very forgiving: like another reader, I used what I had in the fridge: instead of whole milk, I used 1/2 cup 35% cream, 1/2 cup 18% cream and 2 cups 2% milk. Also, to the reader who asked if anyone made in the morning and then re-heated: yes -- I did. Cooked for 45 minutes the day before, then brought to room temp, and cooked another 30 mins (covered), then briefly browned the top. Worked great. Would I make it again? Right this minute!

I first made this recipe a couple of years ago and practically had to break up fights for seconds! I have fiddled with the recipe -- usually trying different cheese combinations -- but the sharp cheddar + Danish blue + parmesano makes for a perfectly fabulous dish. It's rich, so it's not everyday fare, but if you are feeling the need for some extraordinary comfort food, you cannot do better than this.

This was absolutely delish! I only had fat free milk and heavy cream in the frig so I used 1 1/2 cups of each......came out excellent. Also, there are only two of us, so instead of a large pan I used 2 smaller oval baking dishes...baked them both, enjoyed one and froze the other for another dinner. I will definitely make this again. This was great with our baked ham!

i was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. i read a number of the reviews before i decided to make this. i took the advice of a reviewer and made a roux. i forgot to make adjustments to my cooking time and temp for my convection oven, so it was a bit well done! despite that, the flavor was wonderful. i got compliments from everyone -- even my blue cheese-hating teenager! i'll definitely make this again.

I have been making this dish for several years, both at Thanksgiving and Christmas. It is the one dish that my family and friends consistently ask for year after year. I am quite generous with the cheese and the chopped onion. I can say that making it ahead and rewarming several hours later does not alter the deliciousness of this dish.

Rating: 4
Fantastic and soooo easy! It was only for two, and I wanted leftovers. So I used 2 russet potatoes and about 2 tbsp finely minced onion. I also used about 2 tsp Penzey's bouquet garni. I also used fat free evaporated milk, and a 4 blend shredded cheese mix. I am usually not a time or ingredient shredder but I only had 1 hour. It was perfect. My boyfriend raved about it and went back for seconds. The thirds will be for his breakfast. Thanks for this recipe - it's a keeper!

Made this recipe for Easter dinner and everyone loved it. Per the suggestions of others, I left out the butter - completely unnecessary - and increased the cheese by 50%. Because I used my food processor to slice the potatoes, they were thinner than 1/4" and I had enough slices to make three layers, diving the onion, and flour between the first two and the cheese among all three. It was done to perfection in about 1 1/4 hours. While quite liquid upon first removing it from the oven, it firms up beautifully when it sits for 10-15 minutes before eating. I think the bit of curdling that occurs does not detract at all from the looks or taste of the dish. It is delicious!

Very very good. Would do it again. I eliminated the butter and used 1% milk, used a little more onion than called for. Because I had one oven needed to do things ahead of time. I cooked the potatoes for the first 45 minutes then took them out to cool and refridgerated them. The next day I let them sit for about 20 minutes to take the chill off and then cooked them for @ an hour. They were very good, not dry. Would do again.

I made this for Easter yesterday and it was exceptional with our glazed ham. To accomodate the children's tastes, I used cheddar, swiss and parmesan and it was very good--I also increased the cheese a good bit, probably almost double. The proportions of milk, potstos, flour, etc were right on. Next time, I will make it with the cheeses as written.

Rating: 4
I didn't trust this recipe, but I went for it and it worked! I didn't think that the potatoes would cook enough and be tender without par-boiling, but they were. I didn't think that that sprinkling the flour on separately would thicken the milk enough, but it did. I didn't think the onions would cook completely without browning them first, but they did, in fact, they practically melted into the dish! The flavors were great, the potatoes drew raves, and all I did was follow the recipe exactly. Imagine that!

After being handed the duty to bring a potato dish to my stepsons school function, I searched for something special and settled on this. I doubled the recipe and packed in 2 huge productions of it. I packed home almost 2 huge productions of it too. Almost no one ate much of this but to be fair, it was sitting amongst a lot of ...junky food. It was a mistake. It tasted ok, but nothing special.

Beautiful recipe. I decreased the salt slightly, doubled the onion using 1/2 yellow and 1/2 red combo since that is what I had on hand. Sauteed in a cast iron skillet with a little bacon grease (left over from the green bean casserole) along with 2/3 c. chopped ham (which made up for the decreased salt). Solved the curdled problem by making a roux. Used the same skillet (don't wipe it out!) and melted 2 Tbsp of the butter w/ 2 Tbsp flour and stirred with a whisk until med brown then added the milk (combo 1/2 cream and 1/2 skim milk since that's what I had on hand) and stirred w/ whisk just until simmered. Came out beautifully with no curdles whatsoever. Note: I did not add additional butter or flour to the recipe. I simply used the 2 Tbsp of butter that was to have been scattered over the middle layer and 2 of the 3 Tbsp of flour for the roux. I did not use the third Tbsp flour. Made the rest of the recipe as directed. Gorgeously browned. Did a fine dice of a little red pepper and sprinkled over the top close to the end for a little extra zip of color.

Rating: 4
Have made these a half dozen times over the last several years. Always fantastic! As earlier reviewers noted, the butter is not needed with all the cheese, I use a mandoline to slice the potatos 1/8" thick, and end up with 4 layers. Cheese mixture is only 'spotted' on each layer, not a full thickness. Flour is sifted lightly onto each layer. No need to pre-cook anyting - these turn out wonderfully the way the recipe calls for. NOTE - have served these to non-Bleu Cheese eaters and they love them - the Bleu is not nearly as pungent when cooked.

Rating: 4
Just delicious. I brought this dish to my first meeting of a culinary club (comfort food theme). It had a very positive reception. Following the suggestions of other reviewers, I increased the onion (3/4 C), decreased the butter (2 or 3 TBS) and increased the cheese for the topping.

Rating: 0
I wont rate this since I made some major changes, but here's what I did and everyone was begging for seconds: I subbed colby and gorgonzola (only because I was out of the others). Then instead of using milk I used chicken stock (about 2-3 cups) thickened with roux (4T butter and 1/4 c flour) and added 1/2 cup cream then the shredded cheeses once it was simmering. I alternated the sliced potatoes and the sauce and threw in some rosemary, thyme, salt and pepper. Oh and I caramelized the onions while I was making everything else and topped the dish with the caramelized onions-really what dish isn't better with caramelized onions? It was amazing!

I had high hopes for this recipe as I love cheese (including blue), and am tired of mashed potatoes as a standard side dish. Based on other reviews, I greatly decreased the butter, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was okay, but really nothing special. Mine turned out looking fine, and was cooked through, but the flavors just weren't great. I wouldn't make it again, but if I was forced to, I'd definitely add more onions and brown them first. I'd also decrease the blue cheese and add some nutmeg. I took this dish as my contribution to a pot-luck Thanksgiving dinner and nobody remarked on it at all, and nobody had seconds. I won't be making it again.

This is a wonderful and fairly easy to make potato dish. I enjoy the unique tangy taste the blue cheese adds to the dish.

Ok, I read all reviews and used helpful hints. And still, these were not that great. Now, in all fairness, I dont love using bleu cheese a lot since it is very overpowering. I used less than recipe called for and was still cloying. Even with less butter there were still globules of fat floating around and wasnt a pretty presentation. In all fairness, my guests loved it so it was just my taste but I wont make these again unless I use another cheese. I believe good bleu is for crumbling sparingly in things.

Made this for Easter dinner and everyone loved it. My mother in law even came over the next day and asked if there were any leftovers for her to eat. The only change I made was I added garlic with the onion. When it first comes out of the over, it looks a little too greasy. I might cut back on the butter next time.

I made this for Easter and it was a big hit with the family. I substituted bourson cheese for the blue cheese and added a 1/2 tsp of dry mustard to the flour. My machine sliced the potatoes thinner that the 1/4 inch the recipe calls for so the dish was done quicker than the receipe's time.

Delicious! Since there were only 4 of us I used 3 lbs. of potatoes instead of 4 but used the same amount of cheese. Used half and half instead of milk and cut the amount by a fourth to avoid runniness. Doubled the onions and still couldn't really taste them so I'd use more next time. Used only half the butter called for. I made 3 layers instead of 2, grated a little extra parmesan on top. As another reviewer had said I made these ahead of time and there were pools of grease when I took it out of the oven but after sitting at room tempereature for an hour the grease soaked into the potatoes I guess and after reheating the top was golden and crisp. They were a hit!

Rating: 3
Pretty good. Based on the rest of my meal plan (and only one oven) - I cooked them ahead of time (more than 2 hours), refrigerated them and then reheated them. I think that caused them to be a little drier. I would follow their advice the next time and not make them so far ahead of time. Very good flavor. Enjoyed the combination of cheeses.

These are fantastic. I make these as directed except that I sautee the onions in the butter, add the flour and cook it, then add the milk, S & P, and a little dry mustard and stir under med high heat until thickened. I stir in cheeses and then layer potatoes with the sauce. It just is precooking the sauce instead of in the pan, but I feel better about it-it is the old fashioned way- and is sure to be creamy and consistent throughout. Always with ham and green beans and rolls.

I don't eat bleu cheese, so left it out and made up the difference with extra cheddar and parmesan. It tasted great, but still looked curdled inside when it was finished baking. Any ideas what I did wrong? I'd like to make it for Easter, but it didn't look very appetizing once it was served.

A perfect accompaniment to any roast. It can be made a day in advance and reheated with no ill effects whatsoever, in fact it may be tastier.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner to go alongside a ham. I got rave reveiws from my guests about the flavor of the potatoes. My only concern was the presentation. The globs of cheese were not appealing to me at all. I mixed the potatoes up quite a bit after removing them from the oven and that seemed to help. Like I said, my guests raved about the flavor. I just wasn't too happy with the actual look of the dish so I don't think I'd make them again, unless I made a cheese sauce first. I did love the flavor that the blue cheese gave the dish. But then again, I am a blue cheese lover.

Made this yesterday for Christmas Day to go with a friend's feast. Rave reviews followed. The directions were a joy... no guesswork, no wondering.

Cheese flavor wasn't too overwhelming. Can't wait to make again at Easter!

I selected the recipe based on the positive reviews, it is definitely worth its 4-forks! At first I thought -boring-, way too mundane for the Annual Ladies Christmas Lunch, but 14 gourmet cooks can't be all wrong, they loved it. I did reduce the butter as some suggested. And I cooked it a few hours ahead, let it sit in a cool area, then reheated. The few bits that were left were immediately consumed by the designated drivers when they showed up. Even cold potatoes got raves. Make sure you put lots of cheese on top, that chewy browned layer is the best!

I wanted to like this given all the rave reviews, but I thought it was underwhelming. I followed the directions exactly and wound up with what I think of as typical scalloped potatoes: lots of unabsorbed liquid requiring a slotted spoon for serving, clotted cheese, not enough onion flavour, and greasy. I was hoping for 'unctuous'. If this is as good as it gets, perhaps it means that I am just not a scalloped potatoes kinda girl.

Made this dish exactly according to the recipe for New Year's dinner. Came out beautifully, looked stunning, smelled amazing. As a non blue-cheese lover, I found the flavour too strong.

So I'd reduce or leave out if you don't love blue, but even with it, it was a great dish.

Very good. Didn't have blue cheese, so used extra cheddar and mozarella. I was worried I wouldn't have enough flavor, I browned bacon and then removed and added some onion to fat for a few minutes. I sprinkled onion and bacon in middle layer. Used half and half and 1% milk (again, it's what was on hand) Would be great with ham or holiday meal. Halved for 4 people and only ate half, but leftovers great for breakfast.

This is my new favorite potato recipe. It really is as delicious as everyone says. I never change anything about the ingredients. One thing I love about it that I didn't see written is that you can make it and bake it beforehand. Then stick it in the frig. Then 45 minutes before serving it, put it in the oven uncovered.

Very good recipe.. I too made slight modifications - used gruyere instead of blue cheese, used half milk and half heavy cream and added more salt for flavor. I also sauteed leeks and added them. Everyone loved it.. I will definitely use the recipe again!

YUMMY YUMMY! I used cheddar, parmesan, and feta (not a blue cheese fan) and it was fantastic! Next time I will add some mozarella to add a bit a gooeiness. I also boiled my potatoes for 30 minutes first since I already had another dish in the oven, and that worked out well- making less oven time for the potatoes! Great variation on a classic.

Fantastic recipe. The blend of cheeses is great. I use sharp chedder instead of extra, personal taste.

I turn to this recipe every time I make scalloped potatoes now, partly because the instructions are particularly clear. Instructions like "the milk won't completely cover the potatoes" and "it might look a little curdled at this point" really helped me understand how the dish was constructed and what I should expect.

I have been looking for that extra special potato recipe for special occasions, this is it! Easy to make and keep warm until ready to serve. My grandkids asked for a second helping and everyone asked for the recipe. I did prepare it the previous night but as in a previous review some of the potatoes went black, I had to remove them,tried turning them over but they were too discoloured. Not a dish to make when on a diet.

Don't skip heating up the milk. If you have never made this before, it is best to follow the recipie.

Doubled the recipe and used a roasting pan as suggested by a few other reviewers for a crowd of 20. Everyone loved it and I had very little leftover! I was nervous about the blue cheese, but it wasn't overwhelming. I also omited the butter but it still seemed plenty rich and filling! I also forgot to heat the milk and just poured it on cold... I didn't notice a problem with the end product, so maybe this could save a step!

This recipe was wonderful and the way my family ate this up, it will be a staple at my Easter table along with a roasted leg of lamb!I was pressed for time so I prepared the dish and placed it in the microwave for 15 minutes at level 5 just to get a head start, it cut down the time by 40 minutes. My grandchildren do not like blue cheese (yet!) so I eliminated it and added 1/2 cup more of the cheddar and 1/4 cup more of the parmesan. Also, one of my family members has celiac so I substituted gluten free all- purpose flour and it was perfect. The only thing I will add the next time is a little fresh ground nutmeg on each layer. There wasn't a potato left in the dish!

This is soo good! I've followed the recipe exactly. The first time I made it, my friend asked, "What kind of cheese did you put in there?" When I told her she replied that they were her 3 LEAST favorite, but that didn't matter because this was the absolute best scalloped potatoes she ever had! The bleu cheese mellows its punch with the potatoes and other ingredients, so don't leave it out! Can't wait for Easter-it's the only time I'll splurge on this rich dish and the calories.

I can't imagine anyone not loving this recipe. It takes scalloped potatoes and turns up the volume. I am replacing my tried and true Julia Child recipe with this one.

I served these potatoes at a dinner party and got rave reviews. Everyone asked for the recipe. Tried to assemble early in the day and put in fridge until cooking time, but a few of the slices on the top layer turned black. No worries, I just flipped those slices over and no one knew once they had cooked.

These potatoes are fabulous! I used Fontina in place of the Danish Blue and followed the recipe to a T. Not only are they delicious, but the finished product with the cheese nicely browned is a scrumptious presentation. 5 forks in my book!

Ive been making this dish at least 3 times a year since I first saw it in Bon Appetit. My family and circle of friends LOVE big flavored cheeses so this is perfect for us. It is always the hit of the dinner, brunch, buffet  you get the picture  so this year before making it for Christmas, I decide to read some of the comments. Ive just had to laugh. Some people just love to make more work for themselves. To insure success, follow these simple suggestions: #1. If you dont like blue cheese, dont make a potato dish that uses blue cheese. There are so many other great recipes out there, why bother. #2. If you find blue cheese to be a strong flavored cheese, see #1. #3. Use a mandolin to get uniformed slices that cook through (every time). #4. Read the recipe and follow it exactly  it does say the milk will look curdled after 45 mins - why are so many people surprised by this? No need to make a roux. If you followed the recipe the potatoes will be perfect after the final baking. #5 After making it exactly as written  in 1999- I felt it was unnecessary to use butter since the cheeses have so much fat. Over the years, I reduced the butter until I no longer use any. Cant tell the difference. Bottom line - it's a very elegant dish that is simple to make.

I actually did this in 3 layers and used Guyere instead of Blue Cheese. Needed more cheese for sure and less milk & butter. I tripled the recipe but kept the milk and butter the same portions as the recipe called for and it turned out perfect...was the highlight of Christmas dinner

I've already reviewed this recipe but I wanted to add one suggestion to save time. Instead of heating the milk to a simmer on the stovetop, I put the milk in a large pyrex measuring cup and heat it in the microwave. Saves time and also saves cleaning another pan. These potatoes are just the best.

I made this for Thanksgiving requested again for Christmas. Both times huge success. Made a few subs that worked out just fine. (combo heavy cream & 1% milk instead of whl milk...no onions at Christmas) No matter what you do, it's always terrific.Don't bother if you're counting calories. You'll eat your weeks worth! My one "issue" would be this...very greasy. I may use less butter next time. I ended up sopping up the butter with paper towels b4 serving).

To Warzie from Minneapolis,MN You made more work for yourself than was necessary (roux??!) and ruined an excellent side dish (double cheese). Follow the receipe as written and you'll be very pleased. I've been making this dish since it posted and the only change I make is using less butter - with all the fat from the cheeses, you don't need much. Try it again and don't listen to folks that have you jumping through hoops to make a great side a gloppy mess.

Made a double batch for a holiday party and everyone LOVED them! Switching to the gruyere was a good call and the result was as good as what I'm used to at any high end steakhouse. I added extra butter and it is absolutely overkill. This will be a holiday staple!

Rating: 4
I have also made a batch were I used a combination of medium cheddar cheese and sharp cheddar, about 3/4 cup of each since I was still doubling the cheese. I still substituted Swiss for the blue cheese. I found that kids and seniors like the milder version. I have really liked every incarnation of this recipe that I have tried but the milder version is a good bet if your menu has more subtle flavors.

Rating: 4
I tried this recipe on just myself first and it is great just as written (though I did double the cheese) but when I made it for others I substituted Swiss cheese for the blue cheese. Blue cheese can be a very strong flavor for some people. I have also made it with and without onions, because of my guest dietary restrictions, and the flavor is fabulous either way. This was my contribution to Easter dinner, scalloped potatoes go great with ham, and everyone loved it. I highly recommend this recipe, especially to all the potato lovers out there.

I made these last night for the first time just for practice because I wanted to serve them at a dinner party this weekend. I took some suggestions from previous reviews. I made a roux with the butter and flour and thickened with 2% milk. I also doubled all the cheeses as suggested by multiple reviews. It was very easy to assemble and was in the oven in no time. However, when finished baking it did not look appetizing at all. It was very greasy and heavy. My family did eat them, but I'll look for something lighter next time. Perhaps I should have tried the recipe as written.

I have been making these potatoes every Thanksgiving since the recipe appeared in the magazine November 1999. I can't tell you how much people love them. I have a large family and we have had large gatherings and they are always a huge hit. I have always followed the recipe. I little time consuming but worth it. I have had to make them for other meals over the yeas because our guets requested it. I usually make up to a week before and freeze. Take out the night before and re- heat for 20 minutes. They come out great. Definitely worth the time and effort.

THIS WAS WONDERFUL! I will make this again! Because I vastly prefer Yukon Gold potatoes for baking, I used them instead and left the skin on, which is good time-saving idea.Although I am a cheese lover, I had never acquired a taste for blue cheese and was very hesitant about using it. I was truly torn about using the gruyere substitution, but there were so many positive comments about the blue cheese that I bought a good quality cheese. I think the quality is key because when I tried a bit of it, I was pleasantly surprised and decided that I wanted to try the recipe as written. I omitted the butter, as suggested and I didnt miss it. Because I LOVE caramelized onions, I used about 6 or 7 medium-sized sweet onions so that I would be able to completely cover the first layer of potatoes with them. To save time, I prepared the onions the night before. When it was time to add them, I just put them in the microwave for a minute and they spread very easily. I was disappointed that they didnt have a more pronounced flavor impact, but I enjoyed discovering them as I worked my way through each of the layers. Not sure if it was worth the trouble and may just use the onions as directed by the recipe the next time, especially if pressed for time. You might be able to get away with omitting them altogether. I did add some salt and pepper to the milk to help improve their distribution. I used the suggested size baking dish and didnt have any problems with overflow, but maybe that was because I carefully weighed the potatoes with a digital scale. This dish was just beautiful when it came out of the oven. I had some for breakfast this morning and have to say that it is even better the next day. JUST MAKE THIS, YOU WONT BE SORRY!!!

These were absolutely incredible! I doubled the recipe and made a huge batch in my stainless steel roaster. I took the suggestion and used gruyere instead of blue and also used a combination of Parmesan and pecorino romano (I accidently bought the latter). I doubled (and then some) all the cheeses as suggested and used 2% milk, but otherwise followed the recipe. I sifted the flour and didn't have a problem with a "curdled" look. I prepared a few hours before and reheated just before serving. Potatoes were served buffet style with marinated tri-tip, and Ceasar salad - rave reviews! I will definitely make this again!

I made this with no substitutions, and personally didnt like the tastethe blue cheese in particular. Some other reviewers have suggested substituting gruyere, which would probably make this at least a 3-fork dish.

I used gruyere in place of the blue cheese. I actually made 2 batches, one with blue cheese and one with gruyere. The one with blue cheese tasted mediocre, in my personal opinion. It had a strange aftertaste. The gruyere batch was absolutely awesome. I doubled all of the cheese, as recommended by reviewers. Great idea. To prevent curdling, I made a roux from the flour and butter. To do this, melt the butter over medium heat in a saucepan, and slowly whisk in the flour (I sifted the flour directly onto the butter) and stir until thickened. Meanwhile, scald the milk (do not boil) and whisk the roux slowly into the hot milk, stirring until the whole mixture is thickened. Season with salt and pepper. Layer your potatoes and cheeses as usual, and pour the roux over the whole mixture slowly, letting it settle in. I ended up making almost a double batch of roux milk mixture, because I wanted to have a lot of sauce in the potatoes. I also sliced up 1 fuji apple and placed the slices as a layer in between potato layers- It adds a little extra something. BEWARE! This dish can easily turn into a bubbling overflowing *monster* in your oven if you fill the casserole dish up to the top. I made this mistake, and my kitchen was filled with smoke because of sauce burning on the bottom of the oven. It was a mess. So be sure to 1) only fill up the dish 2/3 of the way, leaving plenty of room for rising/bubbling, and 2) put a foil covered cookie sheet beneath the casserole dish in the oven. Or just line the bottom of the oven in foil. Oh, I also used yukon gold potatoes instead of russet. The skin is so thin you don't have to peel them.

I used Gruyere instead of Blue Cheese and made this dish for Easter. These were absolutely the BEST scalloped potatoes that I've ever made.

We had boxed scalloped potatoes at my sister's for Easter. Next day I had a craving for more but wanted to make my own. I made this for dinner along with steak and salad. After every bite, my husband and 12-yr-old son made a comment such as, "This is the best thing I've tasted in my life!" "Oh, my God, these are sooooo good!" Lots of "Mmmmmmmm's." Really decadent, really good. I used pre-grated four cheese blend instead of sharp cheddar because that's what I had in the fridge and put in a little more cheese than called for. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Best scalloped potatoes ever. Do keep an eye on the second 45-min cook time. They got a little too brown on the bottom. Oh, and definitely use the blue cheese. When my son saw me putting it in, he was upset; so I made a second smaller dish without it. He ate only the blue cheese version and couldn't stop.

Big hit at Easter. Yummy!!! Used gruyere instead of blue cheese, as previous review suggested, and it was great.

This was a decadent side dish for our Easter dinner, and was probably the most popular dish on the table. Per the suggestion of some of the previous posters, I doubled the cheese, and I'm glad that I did. Do NOT leave out or substitute the blue cheese-- it really makes the dish. My husband thought so, too, and he normally doesn't like blue cheese.

Definitely a hit with the family this Easter. Doubled the cheddar and parmesan, increased the bleu cheese slightly. Made a roux with butter and flour (used Wondra), then added milk. Let thicken slightly, then added salt, pepper, and onion. Poured a third of this sauce over first layer of potatoes before sprinkling first half of cheese. Did cook ahead of time and reheated. Outstanding! Think this would work with other cheeses as well. Will give it a try next time.

Rating: 4
MMM! This is the perfect side for an Easter ham. Everyone loves it, and the blue cheese is not at all over-powering. I found it difficult to fit 4 lbs of potatoes in my casserole, but happily used all of the cheese. Will be sure to allow for extra cooking time next time. Great recipe!

I have made this several times as a large casserole. Has anyone made this as individual servings in smaller ramekins? What would be the different cooking instruction if any? I have never had a problem with curdling as I make a roux first. I also substitute gruyere for the blue cheese and get raves every time. I would like to serve this at a sit down dinner party and do the service in the kitchen---I need suggestions on how to do this in small dishes without drying it out!!

If there were five forks this would apply. I have never made scalloped potatoes and this recipe was a cinch to follow the best part is the blue cheese and Im no big fan but it adds that distinct flovor that really punctuates the dish I will use a longer baking dish next time so that there is more exposure to the top of the dish because the top part baked is sooooooo yum Thanks

I have made this amazing dish several times and agree that doubling the cheese is the way to go. I have recently started adding a thin layer of scalloped pie apples (fugi, pink lady or granny smith) under the second thin layer of potatoes and it is outstanding. Just peel and core the apples and then slice them exactly like the potatoes. This takes an incredibly good dish and makes it amazing. The apples are the perfect balance for the blue cheese.

Rating: 3
The first time I made this I reduced the amount of bleu cheese; thought it would be overpowering and I was right even with the reduced amount. Made it a second time and left it out altogether...much better. Easy to make if you have a large number of guests (use a mandoline for quick prep) and it holds well in a warming oven.

These potatoes are sooo good!! I follow the recipe exactly and every time I make them the dinner guests can't get over how good they are. The first time I made them I did not have a cuisinart and slicing all the potatoes by hand was time consuming and tedious. I use a cuisinart everytime now and it works very well. I often serve this dish with a big roast ham and green beans. the family always begs for it.

I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese so maybe this wasn't the recipe for me. Most reviews had said they didn't even notice the blue cheese, but I did and yuck! How could you not notice it? My husband on the other hand LOVED it. It was a lot of preparation for a not-so-good dish.

My family and I didn't like these. We were looking for the traditional scalloped potatoes and this wasn't it. It wasn't nice and cheezy, and I did double the cheeses as others suggested. Also, my family and I thought the blue cheese ruined the flavor. It was expensive and in my opinion not worth it.

I made this recipe because my husband requested scalloped potatoes - like the kind in the box. I didn't want to make the box kind because of the overprocessed chemically taste. So, after reading all of the rave reviews, I thought I'd give this receipe a try. I made the recipe according to the instructions with the exception of doubling the cheese amounts. While the "looks curdled" remarks of previous reviewers concerned me, I thought it would be ok. Well, the dish was not very appealing to the eye. In fact, my husband thought it had eggs in it. The cheese was gloppy and definitely curdled looking - not creamy as I had hoped. It did taste good, but I think a different technique is needed to achieve the creamy cheese texture that would be definitely more appealing.

I have never made scalloped potatoes before, and this recipe looked fairly easy. I made the recipe as written however, instead of slicing the potatoes, I cubed them into small cubes. Also, after removing the foil and adding the cheese to the top, I found that it finished cooking in half of the time as written in the recipe. Keep an eye on it as it seemed to brown quickly. It did look kind of curdled when I took it out, but it did get better looking. I cooked it 2 hours in advance, and it reheated quickly and looked much better. I used a 5lb bag of potatoes and it fed 12 people. I had a little left over and it was delicious the next day. Everyone loved them. Hubby told me about 20 times how much he loved them. Will be keeping this recipe and bringing out again soon!

BETTER THAN FABULOUS! This is not only a keeper but worth the splurge on fat and calories for special family occasions! Per other reviewers, I doubled all of the cheeses. I used a real Vermont white extra sharp cheddar and a really good Danish Blue and fresh parmesan. I used Yukon Gold potatoes so when my husband started to try to peel them, he found the skins were so thin that we opted for leaving skins on. He did use the Cuisinart to slice them. I did use the uncooked onion, sifted the flour over the layer, and omitted the butter as suggested by many reviewers. I did use whole milk. My glass baking dish was the right size and was full so I set it on a cookie sheet, but it did not spill over. Because I had to use my oven for the standing rib roast, I made this early in the morning and then reheated per the directions when the roast was resting. It was perfectly gorgeous and cooked evenly through. I served it with a standing rob roast and fresh spinach salad. My family absolutely chowed down on this. We polished off half of it (we are all over 50 and eat smaller portions than we used to) and the wonderful leftovers got eaten up within the next 24 hours!! I am baffled that some people had difficulty with this recipe and I would never omit the blue cheese as I agree with others that it is the "magic" ingredient!

I was trying to figure out what to serve with the meatloaf when I stummbled across this recipe. I had all the ingredient but I didn't have the 1 1/2 hours to bake this. It sounded so good that I couldn't resist. I made a roux, added salt, pepper onion and milk, blended well, added the cheeses and poured onto the potatoes. Then, put it into the microwave for 15 minutes until the potatoes were soft and then put it into the oven until the meatloaf was finished. The whole family loved this -including the picky 10 year old. I will make this according to the instructions when I have more time, but in the mean time, I will use my cheating method as a quick and easy side dish.

I made this for Easter dinner, everyone loved it. I used Gruyere instead of blue cheese and didn't put the butter in, I didn't think it needed any more fat with all that cheese. It came out sooooo good! I will definitely make this again but next time I'll probably try to make a healthier version.

I made this recipe for Easter dinner and everyone loved it! I used the exact ingredients and quantites in the recipe, but I took another reviewers advice and par-boiled the potatoes for about 3 minutes to avoid darkening during baking. I also used the butter, flour, milk, salt and pepper to make a cream sauce that I poured over the first layer of potatoes and cheese (I added the onion to the cheese mixture).I found that no curdling when preparing the sauce this way. After adding the final layer of cheese, I cut the cooking time and temperature down a bit. I did cook them a couple of hours ahead, and then reheated them before serving, again with the time & temp cut down a bit. Turned out great!

I made it with Prime Rib of Beef and it was superb. I too, like a few others doubled the cheeses. I did not have a pan for both layers so ended up making it in two smaller pans...worked just fine!

Fabulous dish! I make it often for holiday meals. Follow the recipe exactly for perfect results every time. I use a mandoline for slicing with excellent results, but DO take care to use the safety shield, or just buy a little over 4 lbs. of potatoes and quit slicing before you get too close to your fingers...the small amount of waste is negligible and certainly preferable to a serious injury.

I made this dish for Christmas Eve and received rave reviews. It made the 90 minute trip to my parents house just fine, and the 20-minute reheat had no adverse affect on the appearance or flavor. The top remained crusty and golden, and the flavor was DELICIOUS. This is a very rich dish, and accompanied the rib roast my dad prepared perfectly. I used Yukon Gold potatoes and all of the cheeses indicated in the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I did add about a tablespoon of flour to the cheese mixture and tossed it around a bit. After the first 45 minutes there were two or three very small areas that were curdled, but after adding the second half of the cheese and baking the remaining time, the end product was GORGEOUS. I see no need to carmelize the onion -- as long as you chop it finely, it provides a very gentle onion flavor and the teeniest bit of a texture difference from the tender potatoes. This is a great recipe for a holiday party, especially if you have a Cuisinart (and a husband who will peel the potatoes for you!)

Fabulous! I've been trying scalloped potato recipes for years and had about given up. Julia Child's and Craig Clayborn's were both too dry. This one's amazing - especially if you have a large food processor to do the potatoes, onions, and cheeses which makes it so easy and fast. I put a little more than the allotted blue cheese in which I won't do again. As the author says, don't be shy with the blue but don't over-do it either.

Made this with a smoked ham for Thanksgiving. Didn't add the butter according to so many suggestions but did add a little more of each cheese and my 9 by 13 pan didn't quite hold all the potatoes BUT this was delicious. Made it early in the day and reheated - perfect! Reheated the next day with leftovers - wonderful! Don't be afraid of the blue cheese - it really made this dish.

Something really wrong must have happened to the 10/03 Canadian attempt. This dish is awesome and I get requests to make it from family and friends all the time. It's rich, so that does not happen often. Whenever I do make this, it disappears quickly. Check your oven Canada, maybe it is off and you need to adjust for an inaccurate temperature reading.

Dont let this last person fool you. These potatoes are awesome. The only change I make is to through in a little extra cheese because who doesn't like a little extra cheese.

What a disaster! I used only top quality cheeses and fresh farmers market russet potatoes, and followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of reducing butter by half. I even weighed the cheeses and used the specified baking dish. The surface of potatoes was badly discolored (greyish black but disguised with the cheese topping); the milk was extremely curdled and separated into an unpleasant thin/watery liquid; the cheese layer in the centre was also curdled and almost slimy in texture. Used a mandolin to slice potatoes to specified thickness but had to bake an additional 15 minutes and potatoes were still slightly underdone. Although tasty with a great aroma, this dish was very unappealing in appearance and problematic in cooking method. To prevent curdling, I think it would be far better to make a classic cheese sauce from listed ingredients. The cheesy flavours would then infuse the potatoes rather than only being in 2 layers. Could still top with additional cheeses for extra flavour and to enhance the appearance. Would definitely not make this again as written. Very disappointing!!!

This is a great recipe, and have made it a dozen times by following it closely. Like others, I omit the butter and use a mandoline to thinly slice the potatoes. A few previous reviewers mention making a roux, a bechemel sauce, or putting in extra milk/sauce to cover the potatoes - I have to ask, why not just find a different recipe that is more comfortable for you? A helpful tip is one thing (sprinkling flour by tapping it through a strainer, for example). Substantially different ingredients or techniques are another.

Rating: 4
I, too, fiddled around with the types and amounts of cheese, but you can't improve on perfection! This dish is unbelievably good. A guest, after one bite, looked up and said, "Can we eat ALL of this??" I think the blue cheese is what boosts it over the top.

Rating: 4
Without question, these potatoes were absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! I served them with some leftover Ham the other night and there was not a morsel left! One of my sons is not big on blue cheese and he loved them too. The combination of cheeses is what I think really makes this dish. I also used a mandoline and it does make a nice difference. Can definitely make ahead and cook all they way or even just part of the way ahead of time. This is going in the PERMANENT recipe file!

Everyone loved this recipe! The cheeses compliment each other and the flavors are indescribable. Will make again.

I have made this dish numerous times for holiday meals. My family especially loves it with ham at Easter. I too have substituted lowfat milk, as well as different types of cheese, including an Irish cheese (tastes like a cheddar-Parmesan blend), a jack and even Fontina. I have also tried the tip to bake it ahead of time and then reheat before serving. That really helps when the oven is needed for other dishes at a different temperature. As for the curdling effect, it seems to occur only during the first 45 minutes of baking when the dish is covered. It becomes less noticeable after the final cheeses are added and the potatoes continue to bake uncovered.

This was not only a simple dish to prepare, but a big hit at the dinner table. I will definitely make this dish again.

I've made a rendition of this recipie several times and my family and guests always rave about it. I have made a few changes in the preparation of this dish that I think make it faster and better (in my opinion). I find that when potatoes are used raw in any scalloped potato recipe, I run the risk of ending up with some overcooked and some undercooked potatoes. Also, if some of the poatatoes are not covered by the milk they dry out, even oxodize and turn a very unappeitzing gray/black color. To overcome some of these problems and to make the cooking time faster, I par-boil the sliced potatoes in boiling water for less than 5 minutes. Take care not to over boil them, the potatoes get to soft very fast. I then make a basic bechamel sauce, add all of the cheeses, except the bleu cheese to the sauce. I place the par-boiled potatoes in a shallow baking dish and sprinkle the top of the potatoes with crumbled bleu cheese, then pour the bechamel/cheese sauce over the top, and sprinkle more grated cheese over the top of the sauce. I cook the potatoes as 350 degrees for about 20 minutes or until the mixture is bubbling and the cheese browns. I let the cooked potatoes rest for about 5 miuntues before serving. I've found this cooking method to be much faster and much more consistent in outcome than the traditional method listed here. Try it and see if you agree. Bon Appetit!

This was an absolutely wonderful addition to our Easter lunch! I, like others, added more cheese (just the extra sharp cheddar on the top layer). This is a keeper - the only scalloped potatoes I'll make from now on.

I made this dish today for Easter along with the filet mignon with merlot sauce. A good addition to this meal. The flavor is really good. I added more cheese than called for because I had shredded jack/mild cheddar blend on hand so it was more like 5 cheese. I'd definitely make this again.

Excellent! I made it for Easter this morning, brought it to my parents where it rested for 2 1/2 hrs and then was heated for 20 min. etc., per the instructions. I used a smaller oval casserole dish and did 4 potato layers, and it still came out like a dream... I'm actually back on the site because several people requested the recipe and I need to forward it! I would make again for a special occasion - this is the kind of yummy comfort food that makes people happy : )

I added bacon to this and it made it a little too rich! My mistake. I heated the milk and added 2 tablespoons of corn starch to it to avoid the curtled milk look and it worked great. A great recipie if you like lots of cheese!

I also used more cheese and 2% fat milk. It turned out really well. Served with old fashioned meat loaf, yum, yum. Next time I will try to cut the recipe in half, as really goes a long way. And it was great with scrambled eggs the next day. Use of the wide mouth cusinart is recommended.

This may be the best potato dish I've ever tasted. I doubled the cheeses (don't substitute for bleu cheese--it's what adds a little kick to this dish). I agree w/others: skip the butter. Mandoline to slice & dusting w/flour great tips! Looking forward to taking to the next pot luck!

Always on the lookout for a potato recipe that is a little different, I tried this dish and it was perfect! Great flavor!! I did however reduce the amount of blue cheese and increased the amounts of parmesan and cheddar. It looked great, tasted fabulous and was a big hit with my dinner guests! This will be one of those recipes that I will make time and time again!

Don't waste your time making a roux just follow the instructions. The only change I made this year was 2% milk vs. whole - can't tell the difference. Have made this about 100 times since I found the recipe and it's perfect as is.

I make this dish every chance I get and I can't believe it always comes out perfectly. Use a mandoline to get even slices, sift the flour onto the layers of potatoes, and don't use any butter. The blue cheese totally makes this dish. Once again it got rave reviews and several folks wanted the recipe.

Rating: 4
This is a fabulous recipe. I took the other reviewers advice and made a roux out of the flour, milk and butter, so there was no curdling. I also subbed Gruyere for the blue cheese. The one listake I made was taking the advice of a review and purchased and used a madolane---on the second recipe, I slipped and literally lost 1/4 of a finger, so that batch went in the garbage (for the obvious reasons) and I spent the rest of the day in the hospital getting the finger reattached. So, this is a great recipe if you don't use anything but a knife!!!! The dish that survived the massacre was eaten in it's entirety and I could have used the one that got tossed.....oh well. Happy slicing!

I made this for our Christmas dinner and not only did it look beautiful, but it smelled wonderful as it was baking in the oven. Followed the recipe to a T other than I heated the milk in the microwave. Great side dish with our honey baked ham.

Substituted gruyere for bleu, as that's what I had on hand, but other than that, made it as written. Great recipe-relatively simple and very flavorful. My sauce did curdle, though the dish looks beautiful still (all golden and crispy). Heated the milk in the microwave. Next time I'll break out the Cuisinart for the slicing and shredding-this dish would come together in a snap. I am an onion lover, but thought the onion would've been better if it had been caramelized first. A little garlic would be good, too :)

I made a light cream sauce with the flour, butter and milk (with slightly greater quantities than the recipe called for since I did want it to cover the potatoes). I also added some garlic in addition to onions. And I piled on the cheese - can't tell you how much I used but definitely more than called for. It was absolutely sinfully fabulous. I served at a small dinner party and it was a big hit. Using the really sharp cheddar and the blue cheese gave it character.

Delicious--got rave reviews. I was skeptical about the blue cheese, but found that that was the "secret" ingredient that made the dish so good. I increased the amount of cheddar and Parmesan cheeses--by about 50%. I don't think it would have been cheesy enough with much less. NOTE: I have made several at one time, cooked them almost through then cooled/froze them. They tasted as good after being frozen, which really surprised me!

This was nasty! It curdled up (the recipe said it would)and looked horrible!

This was easy to make and YUMMY. Everyone loved it. I did wonder if the cooking time was too long. I didn't have a 13X9X2 dish, so used two smaller glass dishes. For the second half of the cooking (when you add the cheese topping), I only baked it for about 30 minutes. Still came out great!

This is a great recipe for Easter. I added a pkg. of dry Good Seasons Italian (1/2 in middle, 1/2 on top) and also a lot more onion in center (3/4 to 1 cup). I also used more extra sharp cheese, probably 6 oz instead of 4 oz. Really made a wonderful side dish to my ham.

My dad's favorite! I halved the butter. Only mistake I made was to peel the potatoes in the morning and keep them in water until I was ready to make the potatoes. When potatoes were done, I had to pour out a lot of water from the dish. But, still, they were the hit of the party! My advise, peel the potatoes and make the dish right away. Then reheat as the recipe suggests. Hope this helps.

I've never liked scalloped potatoes because they are often kind of watery. I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. I was concerned about the blue cheese being too strong, but actually you could barely taste it. I think the 15 minute standing time is key.

Made this dish on Christmas Day and it was spectacular! The aroma during baking was incredible and the presentation was beautiful. I used 1% milk and followed the rest of the recipe.

I have made this several times and have 2 tips: 1) a thin-slicing mandoline works great - and you'll end up with 5 or 6 thin layers. Use a strainer to lightly dust the flour on all layers. 2) Omit the butter. First time, I halved the butter. After that, I omitted altogether. The cheese already has plenty of fat to assure browning.

This is the dish you've been waiting for! Incredible! I don't like blue cheese but used it anyhow because my husband does, may have used a touch more cheddar than called for, used 2% milk because I forgot to buy whole for the recipe and used Yukon Gold Potatoes. I used the Cuisinart to slice the potatoes. I sprinkled both layers with a little nutmeg. The dish was wonderful, EVERYONE loved it including the kids and there was hardly any left it was so popular!

Well, I'm in trouble now. I'd never made scalloped potatoes before this recipe, but my 2 big brothers were coming over to eat and they love potatoes, so what's better than scalloped AND au gratin in one dish?

Although I cook quite a bit, I had never made "scratch" scalloped potatoes before attempting this recipe. I made the recipe exactly except for using skim milk in place of whole milk. Having a husband to peel the potatoes and a Cuisinart to slice them perfectly in about a minute eased my burden considerably! Delicious recipe with a beautiful browned color. For those who are not blue cheese fans (I am), the blue cheese is not overpowering at all in this recipe. Try it! You won't be disappointed.

This is a remarkable recipe. I have made it before and commented accordingly. However with Easter ham it was nothing short of spectacular! It is a pain to make. Peeling and slicing the darn potatoes takes FOREVER. Ingredients are expensive: Danish Blue Cheese, a good cheddar (I went whole hog and got the best English), and PR, whoa. Well worth it, I had 5 people for an Easter Dinner, and it was almost gone (people went back for thirds). I cannot eat onions, but other than skipping the onions, and slicing the potatoes as thinly as possible, this time followed the directions to a fault (ok, I added 1/3 more cheese mixture). Take the time and expense on this one. Oh yeah, expect a mess. No dish can keep it, put a pan under it! Served it with a great fat free ham (good thing as my arteries are screaming) and horseradish. Also simple spring asparagus, my guests were in awe. Thanks Epicurious.

This dish presented beautifully, with a nicely browned top. I could not find Danish bleu cheese, so used another bleu.

Excellent. I actually used 4 cheese (the last one being a mystery), added 3 shallots, more onions and used 2 T butter. I can see where people might think this was greasy. With all the cheese called for, the butter is not necessary. I used the blue cheese and I did not find any colour change in the dish...only these nicely golden brown potatoes. The flavour blended in perfectly.

I made this for a formal New Years Eve dinner---beef tenderloin etc. I read the many reviews and took some of the suggestions seriously....I made a hot roux of the butter, milk and flour and then poured it over the layered potatos and cheese. I also used gruyere instead of the blue cheese, as too many reviews mentioned the off-color. There was no curdling, only the most delicious scalloped potatos I have ever eaten Yes, you need to cook the dish on a cookie sheet! These will be gracing our table for a long time!!

This was the first time I've ever made scalloped potatoes from scratch, and I'm happy to say that all the effort of slicing my own potatoes was worth it. I did use a mandoline, and I believe that helped to tremendously cut down on the time I would have spent slicing potatoes (I'm a fairly new cook). I've never heard of using blue cheese and was a little hesitant to do so, but found that it gave the scalloped potatoes a definite "kick" -- but not so much that it overwhelmed the flavors of the dish. I also used fat-free milk as I didn't have any whole milk on hand, and I don't think it detracted from the dish at all. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly as stated, except for the change in milk, and didn't have any problems with greasiness. The only thing I might do differently next time is add some more cheese. Move over Betty Crocker, I think I will start making scalloped potatoes from scratch from now on!

I was extremely disappointed with this dish--it was terribly greasy and unappealing visually. I made this for a family gathering and had to keep explaining that while it looked gross, it tasted good!

The only thing I might do differently next time is add some more cheddar - in my mind cheddar should be the dominant cheese in scalloped potatoes.

Wonderful, easy, comfort food - here's are a few suggestion to make it even easier: rather than sprinkle the flour, whisk it into the cold milk, and skip the simmer milk part (cuts down on pots to wash). Also, we like our onions sliced as thin rings instead(stays on the fork better and makes the dish look more symetrical). Lastly, add chopped chives for a beautiful garnish!

These potatoes were lovely. The flavor of the cheeses came together magnificently... they were oh so tangy and paired perfectly with a brown sugar-glazed ham loaf (comfort food at it's finest). The only improvement I made was I added extra cheese. I had no problems with greasiness, butter pooling, or the flour/butter/milk failing to come together, as others had mentioned.

I made this recipe for Easter and everyone loved it. I used an oval 2 1/2 qt dish and made three layers which worked out wonderfully. Also, I only have one (36" w) oven which had the ham in it so I added the covered potato dish to the 325 oven for 45 minutes (the potatoes were almost tender) and I was able to finish them uncovered in a 400 oven for a beautiful presentation. I did add a little more of each cheese but only because I had it and of course, I love cheese.

I OFTEN DO NOT TELL FINICKY EATERS THAT THERE IS BLEU CHEESE IN THE RECIPE UNTIL AFTER THEY HAVE TRIED IT AND SAID THEY LOVED IT. I WOULN'T CHANGE A THING.

These are absolutely the BEST scalloped potatoes ever!! I first made them a year ago for an Easter brunch at my in-laws home and since then, every time there is a family get together, they ask me to make them again. They are so easy to make and yummy to eat. An outstanding recipe!!

I was sadly disappointed with this recipe as I love the cheeses and had high expectations. Found the sauce runny and greasy. I will try again with a few adjustments others have suggested.

O.K. lets simplify this recipe. I put the salt and pepper in with milk while cooking. The butter is really not needed and what was the miniscule amout of flour for? I forgot to put it in and can't imagine what it is there for. Maybe I just don't like scalloped potatoes so I wasn't super impressed. Will try again with better quality cheeses. Thanks Epicurious, my favorite site on the web!

Made it twice in 1 weekend. After reading the reviews, I only changed it by increasing the amount of cheese and used 1/2% milk, because that is what I have. The first time I made it I used Gorgonzola instead of Blue. I also cut the recipe in half, because I was feeding a smaller crowd. It turned out great both nights, and all guests loved it, even the one that doesn't like blue cheese.

Very good and very easy! Used 2 T of butter and added more cheese. Microwaved the milk to save time. Be careful...I used 3 C of milk as the recipe stated and the milk overboiled in my oven.

I have to tell you that this is a great recipe to start with. I am no fan of the "smelly" cheeses but just about any flavorful cheese works. I used a garlic-jack with some Gruyere and it was amazingly good. The family scraped the plate clean!!The no butter idea is a good one, however.

WOW WAS THIS GOOD !!! My only problem was cutting it down to just enough for the two of us. TRY IT !!!

This is always a big hit at holiday gatherings and it gets lots of raves...but I agree with the other reviewer about the greasiness. Next time I will definately omit the butter. For a wine, try a zinfandel or spicy shiraz.

Rating: 3
I made some alterations and the dish came out exceedingly well: 1) Sliced potatoes very thin by using a mandolin 2) No butter at all - so many comments about greasiness. With so much cheese there was already plenty of fat. 3) Only made about 1-1/2" thick so it cooked in the time specified. Overall, a great recipe. As modified, I give it 4 instead of 3 forks.

YUMMY and EASY! I made this dish on Christmas Eve to go with the honeybaked ham that my husband,s relatives send us every year. This was a wonderful dish, and went well with the ham. I did follow the advice of some of the other reviews- I whisked 1/2 of the amount of the butter and the flour together with the milk- this seemed to work quite well. 5 people basically demolished the entire dish. This would be wonderful with roast or prime rib, as well. I'll definitely make it again. Any wine suggestions????

I halved the recipe. I made a 1/2 and 1/2 -- half skim milk and half whole milk. It was just the right amount of richness without being over the top. To add some additional kick, I added some hot pepper sauce and prepared horseradish to the milk mixture. The blue cheese, coupled with Tabasco and horseradish was a perfect pairing for roast beef.

This is a great tasting side dish! I made some changes that reduced the fat and calories and improved the consistency (some of the changes were my own and some at the advice of others in the reviews): First, my pan size was 8 x 11.5 x 2 so I reduced the recipe quantities to 3/4. Second, I cut the butter in half. Third, I used non fat milk (skim). Fourth, I whisked in butter and flour into the warm milk instead of separately into the dish layers as recommended(this eliminated the pooling of the butter dollops). In addition, I used imported Gorgonzola instead of Blue cheese. My results were a nice crusty top of cheese and consistently uniform creaminess throughout. This dish has plenty of flavor, no need for all that butter or fat from whole milk! Enjoy...

Rating: 2
I made this exactly per the recipe and while the combination of cheeses was excellent overall it was just so so. I agree with the recent review from Phil. PA that the sauce is very lacking. Also the butter on top made big oil slicks. If I tried it again I would either make a sauce or replace some milk with cream, and eliminate the butter.

The cheese combination was great, especially on the top layer. I used a smaller dish and made more layers, but I found the other layers a bit watery. Next time I'll do it in the right size pan,it is potentially a very good side dish.

I made this for mothers day for a little change-up to my normal scalloped potatoes. It was just OK. I liked the cheeses, but my old receipe calls for making a sauce with the butter, flour and milk and then pouring over the potatoes. This makes a much better consistency to the finished dish. I'll try that and then add the cheeses but the sauce is key.

To Cook from the Northeast: have you tried dropping the sliced potatoes immediately into a bowl of cold water till you are ready to use them? It usually works. Just before using, drain...and you may want to then dry them in paper towels, depending on the texture needed for whatever recipe you are using.

This recipe was ok...but I've found the recipe for "Scalloped Potatoes with Goat Cheese & Herbes de Provence" (also on this site) to be much better - provided you and your guests like goat cheese! The goat cheese makes for a nicer presentation (no risk of discoloration, as with the Danish blue). One question for everyone - with any scalloped potato recipe, I like to slice the potatoes ahead of time, but they discolor very quickly!! Any suggestions??

Rating: 2
I tried this at Easter, and I was fairly disappointed. The taste was good, though nothing spectacular, and the presentation is not that good (pale, lumpy, runny). Other Au Gratin recipes will stay at the top of my list, but the blue cheese does add an interesting bite that I will try to work in.

This is a great recipe. I loved the way that the 3 cheeses melded and complimented each other. I used a lot more cheese than the recipe called for and I would use even more next time.

I have made this twice now and everyone loved this recipe. I think I may try substituting Feta for the Blue cheese next time just out of curiousity. I think it is amusing when people change a recipe entirely and then claim that they love the recipe, such as the cook who said "I substituted red potatoes, added 2 tsp. of sage, added radishes, used a medium red onion, used only cheedar cheese (2 cups) and parmesan. I also created three layers to infuse the flavors more. I really love this recipe- it goes great with beef wellington and apple crips!

I love scalloped potatoes and have tried many recipes. This is the perfect one! It is fail safe. I've varied it in many ways, always keeping the proportions (liquid to potatoes) the same, and it always turns out great. I even used 1 cup whipping cream and 2 cups chicken broth the last time I made it because I didn't have milk and it was still wonderful. I've also added diced ham and peas -- delish. One change I've made is that I saute the onions, otherwise I find their flavor too strong.

I made this recipe tonight with the rack of lamb with caramelized shallot and thyme crust which is also on this site. These potatoes were really good!

I love any type of scalloped potatoes, and I think this one is a keeper. I find the dish really easy to make with a mandoline. I slice all the potatoes very thin(you can leave the skin on if you like), sliced a 1/2 an onion I had in the fridge, and then sliced all the cheese on the same gadget. Assembly and clean-up is a snap. And although a big fan of blue cheese, I found the taste a little distracting. May substitute with gruyere next time. Can also be baked 1/2 way the day before for simple do-ahead preparation.

Substituted additional sharp cheddar and parmesan cheese to replace the blue cheese and still had excellent flavor. Made this dish 2 hours before dinner guests arrived, and reheated before dinner as directions suggested. This allowed the dish to setup and was easy to cut into squares. to serve.

Delicious and different. I used the blue cheese, parmesan and cheddar cheeses as suggested. The blue cheese made the difference and all the guests enjoyed it. I used more butter though. The only problem was that when mixing the cheeses they clumped together as the blue cheese was wet. As a result I had to spread extra parmesan over the dish. I made this for a dinner party and served it with roasted rosemary chicken. Very creamy.

This was a very nice dish. It is rich, and I will use it as a special occasion/holiday side dish. In response to the cook who "couldn't taste any cheese" in the dish, my suggestion is to run down to the supermarket and pick up a box of Betty Crocker Au Gratin potatoes. That might suit your palate better. Further, potatoes baked in milk and cream is a classic (and delicious when prepared correctly) French dish called Potatoes Dauphinois.

This is a great dish! I am amazed at all we can do with the potato! I would like to offer some ideas for the benefit of presentation, if the cheddar has made it too greasy on top, this can be blotted off with paper towel; also, you may add some freshly snipped chives on the top for color.

Do not agree with reviewer who thought the blue cheese overshadowed - we felt it was just right and offered a unique cheese taste. I think you have to be a blue cheese lover. I only had 1% milk in the house and this did not work well. Next time will be sure to have whole milk. Also found I had to cook an extra 15 minutes but perhaps I did not slice the potatoes thin enough. Will definately make again.

I used Yukon Gold potatoes (my new favorite!). I agree that this isn't the prettiest dish I've ever made, but the taste more than makes up for it!!

I replaced the blue cheese with some pizza cheese I had on hand and these were still delicious. I cooked them about 2 or 3 hours ahead of time then reaheated in oven for 20 minutes when ready to serve. Next time I would use closer to 5lbs of potatoes as there was plenty of room. Yummy.

The first time I made this I added the second layer of cheese at the beginning (instead of for only the final 45 minutes uncovered). The extra cooking time of the cheese, combined with being covered, made for a greenish/blue tint to the whole dish (ala Bleu Cheese). Tasted wonderful....but look relatively gross. The second time, I minded the recipe as shown and it turned out much, much better appearance wise. This is probably because half of the Bleu Cheese did not emulsify too early in cooking process and thus was not absorbed as fully. Follow the recipe and this is a wonderful dish.
