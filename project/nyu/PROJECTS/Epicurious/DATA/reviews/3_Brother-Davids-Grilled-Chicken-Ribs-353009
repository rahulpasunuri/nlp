I only make the chicken and I love this recipe! Everyone for whom I've made it has always asked for the recipe. Skip the reviews from those who didn't know where to find the fabulous sauce rcipe and you'll see that this is a winner.

The sauce doesn't say bottled and is in bold letters, obviously a link to the recipe. Just made the ribs, not chicken. Absolutely delicious, more tangy than sweet. Will definitely make again.

Ditto on the lousy recipe. Nothing creative about it.

It is my humble opinion that these ribs will be underwhelming at best, chewy, stringy, without the necessary smoke and flavor penetration. Ribs need to be cooked long and low for that fall off the bone, tender, smokey flavor. And by flipping every 5 minutes, you're looking and not cooking. Ribs have sinew and fat that takes long cooking times (3 hours minimum - I prefer 4 to 4 1/2 hours at 300-325F) at a medium heat (300 - 350) to break down and melt, providing moisture and flavor to the remaining meat. When you cut the ribs you will notice a pink coloration in the first 1/3 of the meat...this is smoke and flavor actually entering the meat from the long slow cooking.

i would never use anything sweet on any meat. my choice. way too much salt in this recipe.try the chicken parts with lime or lemon juice, garlic paste and chopped cilantro. marinate in a large plastic bag.when ready to grill salt lightly with sea salt and fresh ground pepper.very good stuff!

To A Cook: "Sweet & Tangy BBQ Sauce" is a recipe, and a really great one at that. Click on it to go to the recipe. This is pretty common on the Epicurious site, so be sure to look for it in the future so that you can fully appreciate the recipes.

How can this be a recipe when the key ingredient is a bottle of sweet and tangy bbq sauce? Shouldn't you tell us how to make the sauce? This is more like the old 1950s recipes that begin: "Open a can of cream of mushroom soup....."

Season like the recipe and sear the chicken and ribs on both sides over a hot fire, like the recipe says, to sear and seal in the juices. THEN, move the meat aside, cover the grill with foil and poke a few holes in the foil, put the meat on the foil and close that grill off, reducing the heat to under 300. Low and slow almost an hour, then return meat to the direct grill, and the heat will come back up with the grill open. Brush with sauce and let it carmelize on the meat without burning, about 5 minutes each side. This makes tender juicy bird, Texas guarunteed!

Make it simpler. Use a whole chicken cut the sternum and flatten it. Make a thick paste of olive oil, kosher marine salt, pressed garlic and a small amount of powdered hot chilis. Rub chicken with generous amounts of this paste and let it wait a few hours before grilling. Start grilling with the chicken skin up and then turn it over. Its done when both sides start, just start to turn brownish. For the pork ribs try just to sprinkle them with marine kosher salt before grilling. Grill turning frequently and they are also done when both sides start, just start to turn brownish. Those who care for industrial sauces can add them in their plate.
