Surprising a friend with these bars for her birthday...hope she likes them. I used almonds in lieu of the hazelnuts - oooh, just thought, a little Disaronno added to the crust would have made a nice touch - will try that next time.

Too sweet, if you bake coconuts for a further 10 min., it will burn. You need to cook the filling longer.

This did not turn out well for me. I was skeptical about the bake time for the crust, so I only put it in for 20 minutes, but it still burnt. I also had about half of the filling end up underneath half of the crust, like another reviewer mentioned. The crust broke in half and half floated on the filling. Also, the hazelnut smelled great while baking, but I couldn't really taste the hazelnut flavor or coconut in the end - the whole thing just tasted like very overly sweet lime.

I laughed so hard when I read the review that mentioned cooling the crust completely...guess I read the recipe too fast! I mixed all the filling ingredients together, including the coconut, and dumped it on the hot crust. And it came out GREAT! Chilling them is a nice touch as well.

I have made these several times as they have become very popular. I do not like hazelnuts, I made them the first time with the hazelnuts, but have been using a macadamia crust since. I think a pecan crust could be very interesting, too. I also added a white chocolate drizzle to finish them...

Great recipe, the hazelnut curst really adds something special to the whole bar. The toasting method worked great, but it was hard to get the husks off of some of the nuts. I also would not suggest the triangle cuts for these bars, because it was hard to get them out of the pan like that. Overall, fantastic recipes with bold flavors that mix perfectly.

Very nice recipe, delicious and easy to put together. As prior reviewer noted, definitely sprinkle on the coconut at about 18- 20 minutes into baking time. My filling set up more quickly than the recipe stated, and as a result the coconut didn't brown up by the time the filling was fully set. Put it under the broiler for a minute and came out fine.

These were a huge crowd pleaser and turned out perfectly. They were delicious and beautiful.

Delicious...mine set up before the 25 min mark..would add coconut at 15 min. Other than that they were delicious. I did keep them chilled and they were better each day. Crust and filling were wonderful. Yumm!

Ok. I'm changing my review.... I would have given this recipe 3 stars, so I'm giving it 4 this time to balance out my previous 2 star. When I reviewed, I'd only taken out the first row or two of bars, but later I moved to the other side and they were perfect! I think I'm blaming my oven, and maybe it is lop-sided and somehow affected the cooking of the bars.....

The taste of these was really nice, as I absolutely love lime and coconut. The hazelnut crust didn't hurt. I think I must have screwed something up, such as not letting my crust cool COMPLETELY. When I cut them, the custard and crust had swapped, and the custard was on the bottom - it had seeped through somehow. So weird. And while the presentation wasn't anything to write home about, it still tasted good.

Great flavor and relatively simple to make. Crust doesnt seem to stand up to well nor have enough flavor so i might have to make some adjustments next time. I made these during a rather humid night so i decided to stick them in the fridge once they were completely cooled and actually liked them better a little chilled vs. room temp.
