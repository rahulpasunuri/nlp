Very tangy and flavorful; GREAT if you love capers, not good if you don"t!

we took the other advice about runniness, and backed off a little on the sour cream and mayo. the capers really really made this dish. guests raved over it!

Excellent! I was looking for a deviled egg recipe with some snap, and I found it. Mine was not runny at all as reviewed by another cook--the ingredient partions were perfect.

I love tarragon, lemon and capers, you'd think I'd love this recipe, but didn't.

Liked the flavor. The fresh tarragon added a nice touch. Found the filling to be a little runny. Next time I'll try less mayo & sour cream.

This was an easy recipe to make, and people at my party loved it! ok, I didn't have tarragon and substituted fresh rosemary instead, but it was a big hit. I'm making it again for my coworkers tomorrow.

This is a nice change from the original deviled eggs. I was a bit worried since I tried a deviled eggs recipe with sour cream before and it was horrid. I thought this was the perfect blend of mayo and s.c. Yummy if you want to add a little kick to deviled eggs.

Do not add sour cream - addition of capers good choice - fresh tarragon gets lost because of capers

These were good but I prefer the deviled eggs with curry from this site. They have more zip.

I love capers and I love deviled eggs, so this was a great combination. I was so used to my grandmother's plain deviled eggs that jazzing them up was wonderful. I proved to a few guests at Easter that deviled eggs can be a gourmet dish and taste incredible. Recipe was simple and will definately make again.

Everyone loves these eggs. If you're smart, you'll double the recipe. If you're lucky enough to have leftovers, they make a great egg salad sandwich.

Made this for a New Year's Day brunch. No one commented about the dish and had lots left over. Flavors intensified after a day of refrigerated storage.

This was very easy, but my husband and guests didn't like the tarragon. I rpobably would not make it again.

I haven't made these yet, but definately plan on it. I wanted to answer Renee in Texas about her trouble peeling eggs. Your eggs were probably very fresh. The fresher they are the harder to peel; next time you know you'll be hardboiling eggs make sure you buy your eggs a week ahead so you don't have that problem :)

Yummy, yummy, yummy. These were a nice break from my usual 'deviled' deviled eggs. Whoever said they have a bernaise type texture hit the nail on the head. My husband, who is not always a fan of spicey, definitely prefers these. Creamy and tangy, although my eggs looked like the cat tried to help me peel them. Any hints. They weren't overcooked, just difficult to peel. I wonder why?

I made this dish for a party and everyone loved it! The eggs were so tangy that even the guys who set up the furniture were raving about them.

This was nice, although I have another recipe for a spicier deviled egg that I prefer. But if you like bernaise sauce, you'll love these eggs and they're a bit different from the norm.

I took this to a concert at the park and everyone loved it. Emailed recipe to everyone there.

I made this for a girl's night out recently, and everyone was delighted to see deviled eggs as part of the party! It brought lots of conversation about our parent's cocktail parties. Everyone agreed, these were much better than those our parents made. Everyone asked for the recipe! I'm going to do them again for a family reunion over the fourth!
