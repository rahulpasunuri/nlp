I love the idea of potato salad with tofu mayo-- my boyfriend detests mayo and it's a bit more healthy than the average mayo-based potato salad. However, I agree with the chefs below, this tofu mayo recipe really lacked luster. In order to spice up the mayo I added some dill and garlic as well as a bit of apple cider vinegar. I also added some additions to the salad itself: egg and celery. I would make it again with similar additions.

This was yummy and easy. I hate onions, but I loved the taste they added to the potatoes. The only reason I wouldn't make it again is that I felt wasteful throwing away all the onion slices afterwards.

I added a can of tuna and green beans to make this a nicoise salad. The dressing is really good but needs more tarragon for flavor. Overall this was very yummy and I would make it again!! Try it, you'll like it!!

The dressing was really bland! I tried adding some cayenne and salt to spice it up a little but it did not help. It would have been good if there was something else in the dressing to give it some flavour, but the tarragon didn't help. Normally I am a big tofu fan, but this did not go over well.

The dressing is so good I may never again purchase mayonnaise from Kraft or others again.
