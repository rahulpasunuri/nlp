I also omitted the parsley and doubled the flour and broth. I think if you dot the chicken liberally with butter, the chicken won't dry out.

This is Sunday Oven Fried Chicken! My husband says this belongs in the pretty,f*$#ing GREAT catagory! Reminded him of why he loves Thanksgiving Turkey! Easy to do,I will make again.

Very tasty and quick to put together. I mixed some dried herbs I like (thyme, sage, margoram, savory) with lemon zest and some softened butter and smeared that under the skin of the breast. Then I brushed melted butter on the outside of the breasts and seasoned.....cooked as directed but at 425 degrees. Also, I threw in a half lemon, quartered, in the pan to roast with the chicken. To make the gravy, I used about double the flour and over a cup of stock with the juice from the roasted lemons and a handful of parsley. Gravy and chicken were delicious!

The chicken was well-cooked and everything tasted okay, but I thought this dish was just hopelessly bland. I would have preferred a different herb other than parsley... sage, perhaps? Either way, I'm not sure I'll be making this recipe again.

This was delicious, but messy in my brand new oven! Would definitely use a deeper dish to try to avoid excessive splatter. Like other reviewers, I did not like the parsley. A little might have been fine, but 1/4 cup gave it a funky texture.

This was so good. I am the worst with pan gravy but this was an easy and perfect dish. I did add a cup or so of chicken stock in the pan with baby new potatoes with fresh pearl onions with EVOO drizzle, and a bit more butter to the chicken and just kept adding stock till the gravy seemed a good consistency. Will do again definitely.

THIS IS DELICIOUS!!! MADE IT EXACTLY LIKE RECIPE BUT SWIRLED IN A PAT OF BUTTER INTO THE SAUCE AT THE END. NEVER HAVE COOKED CHICKEN AT THAT HIGH HEAT AND IT WAS PERFECT.

My family loved this weekday chicken recipe... added 1 cup of chicken broth, fingerlng potatoes and shallots at 475 for 30 minutes .. Also substituted herbs de provence instead of poultry seasoning....Perfect! It was so moist too!

I followed the previous reviewers advice and used herbes de provence instead of poultry seasoning with great results. Thanks!I didn't add the parsley either....husband and kids are not fans either.

Rating: 4
This was old fashioned comfort food like Mom used to make! I used 1/2 t. seasoning (herbes de provence was delicious) per breast and brushed them with butter before the salt and pepper. Roasted at 400 for 40 minutes for perfect moist meat. I used 1 c. broth to increase the amount of gravy (next time I'll try 2 c.) and used a cornstarch/water slurry to thicken it at the end. Pour everything into a saucepan if you don't want to put your baking dish over the burners. It was fine without the parsley (kids don't like it). My husband & kids loved this dish!

Also, use flat leaf parsley, not the curley stuff. Much better consistency.

This was great. I cooked the chicken with fingerling potatoes, baby carrots, some crushed garlic cloves and a big quartered shallot. I served it with steamed broccoli and made the gravy with the drippings from my pyrex (I don't have a metal pan). My husband didn't like the parsley, but I thought it was great. I had a couple spoonfuls over the stove on the sly. I definitely recommend for an easy dinner.

The ultimate comfort food! I usually add onions, a little garlic and some mushrooms to the gravy and serve this with mashed potatoes. So easy, and the leftovers are really good, too.

Rating: 2
This is just okay. Nothing at all exciting. I seared the chicken breasts then finished them off in the oven. The gravy needed some tweaking so I ended up adding some butter and lemon juice. Pretty average meal in my opinion. not sure it is worth the effort or that I would make it a second time.

Rating: 4
Excellent weeknight dish. Chicken is moist and tender - you really don't even need the gravy, but it's a yummy addition. I made roast acorn squash as a side - just halved the squash and roasted it in the oven at the same time as the chicken, then scooped out the flesh and mashed with a couple of pats of butter, salt, pepper, dash of nutmeg and a sprinkling of brown sugar - very easy and everyone loved it.

Rating: 4
We agree that this is very tasty and easy! We took chicken breasts without the skin and cooked them about 30 minutes at 400 degrees in a glass oven-ready dish covered with aluminum foil. The chicken came out very moist. We also used a full cup of chicken broth and almost a full cup of chopped parsley. We used up every drop of the sauce (there never would have been enough sauce for potatoes, as the recipe indicates). This would taste good with turkey as well.

20 minutes into baking at 475, smoke was pouring out of the oven. Disappointing. The gravy was bland. After 25 minutes + 10 min resting + 5 mins back in the oven to warm it still wasn't done.

Rating: 3
What a terrific, simple, satisfying dish. And so easy for the beginning cook! I made the dish just as the recipe said, except I didn't have poultry seasoning, so I used an herbes de provence mix that was in the cupboard. The dish turned out fabulous. It tastes just like Mom used to make. I don't think it matters much what herbs or spices you stuff under the chicken skin as long as you like them. This is a great staple dish for any cook's repertoire and I'll be making it often!

great easy supper dish--made as written and wouldn't change a thing

For what it is, it's awesome. I enjoy roasting whole chickens but, let's be honest, we all really enjoy the breast meat best. This takes a fraction of the time and is just as tasty. Took a little longer to cook - maybe 35 minutes - served with mashed potatoes and broccoli. An excellent low-fuss meal. Not an epicurian delight, but simple, delicious fare.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. Do not be fooled by its simplicity becuase the flavor is rich and wonderful. We will DEFINATELY make this again!

Ah. Can something so simple be any good? Oh my! Yes it is. You can add herbs, lemons/juice. All would be good. However--did it as it read. And I'm wondering what the heck we are doing to chicken adding all that other stuff, as I have in the past. This tastes like Mom's Sunday chicken. Had new potatoes with fresh chives. Great! Buttered corn. Yum! And a great salad. This has told me that if you want other items to be tasted, keep the main couse seasoned simply. And it will complitment the rest of the menu. As well as the menu will complicate the main dish. What I heard was: Great chicken. Loved the potatoes. Corn was so good---etc. If you've got a problem with the taste of chicken---add all you want. This was Mom's sunday dinner--and I haven't that in a looong time!

Rating: 4
Foolproof-easy, mega-delicious! And yes, poultry seasoning is indeed pretty basic stuff, found in any bulk foods spice section. I was also in the mood for as plain a gravy as possible, so I omitted the fresh parsley, even though I had it right there in the fridge...

This is a very popular dish in our house--it requested for birthday dinners by my children. Very easy to make on a week night and very good. There are never any leftovers!!

This dish is deeeelicious! So easy and so flavorful, especially the gravy. I noticed it said to rub half of the poultry seasoning under the skin but it didn't say what to do with the other half. I didn't premeasue, I just lifted the skin and dusted the seasoning until I thought it was enough. It turned out great and the chicken was very moist. The gravy didn't need any additional salt and pepper like some do.

Rating: 4
Great quick easy comfort food dish. As for the person before me, poultry seasoning is just that---like sage, thyme, beau monde, etc. and it comes in many brands. Try the "P" section of the spices at the grocery store. Gheez! Sounds like SOMEBODY needs a nap!

Rating: 0
Forgive me, but I have to voice my frustration here. I haven't tried the recipe because I was very put-off by the mention of "poultry seasoning" in the ingredients list. How can a magazine/website that purports to be gourmet- or culinarily-minded include something as undefined as "poultry seasoning" in its ingredients list? At the very least, a quick mini-recipe for homemade seasoning should be included. Because of the simplicity of this dish, the outcome of the recipe depends almost entirely upon said seasoning -- and, sadly, there wasn't even a brand suggestion made.

I didn't think this recipe was horrible so I gave it a single fork. Preparation was super super easy but maybe I don't like poultry seasoning in this quantity.

Unbelievably quick and delicious. My husband loved it. I made it as written, adding fresh herbs under the skin with the seasoning. Next time I will double the gravy.

I only did this because I had some leftover chestnut dressing in the freezer that I wanted to use up and I wanted something with a sauce or gravy. This was all I could find and I had some boneless chicken breasts. I did them at the 475 for 10 minutes and then reduced temp to 400 for another 10 minutes. I thought the gravy was too thick for our tastes so added additional chicken broth and boiled it to reduce and concentrate flavor. IT was DELICIOUS! Neither one of us thought it would be so good, I am delighted and will make this again many times!

What a wonderful and simple dish, I also doubled the gravy. I served it over a bed of rice with mixed veggies. Simple, week night dinner!!

I have made this dish quite often. It has become a comfort dish. However, I did alter it slightly. I added a sage leaf under the skin along with the poultry seasoning for additional flavor, and fresh mushrooms to the gravy. When ready to serve I bone the breast and slice it on the angle it makes a nicer presentation.

I loved it, and of course I altered the recipe, because I always alter the recipe. I didn't have potatoes, so I steamed up some broccoli and purple cabbage and made a simple salad with Red Romain Lettice and Fresh Tomatoes. The Chicken Breasts were large and took about 35 minutes to cook. I put the chicken breasts in a pan and covered them with oil and a little Toney's Seasoning. I placed about five cloves of fresh garlic along side the chicken and filled the bottom of the pan with some water so that the garlic would cook in the water and so that the chicken broth would mix with the water as the chicken cooked. This kept the chicken nice and moist. When the chicken was cooked, I put the chicken to the side and poured the chicken broth and the garlic cloves into a pot with some butter and extra oil with salt and a little half and half to make the sauce creamy. I added the flour until it was thick. It was great! My two-year-old loved it!

Rating: 3
Pretty good! The gravy definitely made the dish, though. I made it with boneless, skinless breasts, though, and cooked for 20 minutes at 475, but reduced the temp to 400 after 15 when I realized I had a smokehouse in my oven! The chicken was very tender, and I added mushrooms to the sauce...a perfect complement! Not a stellar dish, but quick, easy, and very good. I'll be making it again!

I didn't have "poultry seasonings" on hand and used bouquet garni instead. The chicken was fine, not outstanding, and needed to cook for a good 40 minutes - the breasts were large. The gravy was quite tasty - first time I was able to make a pan-roasted gravy that tasted good! This dish was very easy, and I would make it again for a mid-week meal!

The gravy was pretty good with this recipe. I, too, added some mushrooms and garlic as well. the chicken was alright. it wasn't fantastic or anything but just ok for a weeknight dinner if nothing fancy was required. i felt like it lacked something extra maybe rosemary or something. i served it with the creamy mashed potatoes from this site as well as some mixed green to put a bit of a southern flair.

First time I ever made a decent gravy! Did not split the breast in two, but followed the rest of the recipe as written and simply carved the breast when finished. Served with steamed brussel sprouts and broccoli and Wild Rice Stuffing with Hazelnuts and Dried Cranberries, (another Epicurious recipe). Beautiful, colourful presentation.

My husband thinks I'm a culinary genius! Which may or may not be good, because now I'm expected to cook more often. This dish was so simple and so delicious, I'd make it 3 times a week! The gravy was excellent and I doubled the recipe to make sure there was enough for my mashed potatoes. Because the chicken breasts were so large, I added about 25-30 minutes and I think next time, I'll add 30-40 if they're the as big.

Rating: 4
Very good! I used dried parsley instead of fresh & it was good. About the butter: I keep butter in the freezer. Then when a recipe says to "Dot with butter" I grate the frozen butter with a grater, (Fine grate). This gives a better distribution than dotting it. The breasts browned beautifully & were juicy. They were large, so I had to increase the time to 30 minutes...

This was great! I did use cornstarch rather than flour (hubby has a wheat allergy) and added mushrooms to the gravy which was a HUGE hit. I also doubled the recipe and it turned out just fine.

Amazingly easy and delicious! Perfect for weekday meals. The gravy is incredibly tasty and plentiful. I used boneless, skinless breasts. After 10 minutes in the oven, I covered the chicken with foil to prevent dryness. I've tried a lot of recipes on my husband. He has a rather snooty palate so I wasn't sure he would enjoy such a simple dish, but he made sure I'm keeping this one. Even though it is easy to make, it doesn't look that way once it's plated. I would even make this for company. Suggestion: Use Paul Prudhomme's Poultry Magic for the seasoning.

This recipe just didn't turn out well, I think my chicken breasts were too large, they weren't even close to done when cooked per the recipe. They also didn't brown well and the poultry seasoning made them a yucky color. One postive note was the gravy was good, won't make this again!

Delicious and easy! The chicken breasts were very moist and tasty. I doubled the recipe and added a dash of white wine to the chicken while it cooked, which made the gravy taste even better.

This recipe was delicious and the gravy was to die for! I made this for my brother and sister-in-law and they raved about it! My sister-in-law asked me for the recipe which is a real sign of how good it was. I did make some modifications to the recipe- I spread a little bit of low-fat boursin cheese under the skin in addition to the spices called for in the recipe. This made the chicken look really nice and added some extra flavour. I also had the butcher remove the bones (but leave the skins) on the chicken. Like other reviewers, I found that an extra 15 minutes in the oven was required.
