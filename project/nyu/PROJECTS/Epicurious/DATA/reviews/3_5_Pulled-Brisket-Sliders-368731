These were a huge hit at my Hanukkah open house. I added a little tomato paste and a teaspoon or so of apple cider vinegar to add a layer of flavor. I also served some with sweet pickle chip on top.

While the meat was tender, I found the overall flavor pretty flat, roasted veggies and all. Not worth the trouble, imo.

Made these for tailgating. Reheated the day of game on the BBQ, served with coleslaw and hawaiian rolls :) They were delicious and everyone loved the flavor. I personally would cut down on the clove next time but definitely will make again.

Made this a day ahead of time for a holiday party and warmed the pulled meat up in a crock-pot in time to serve. Really, really tasty and not very difficult. Thinking I'll do this again soon.

I liked this recipe very much, but next time, I would omit the cloves, I thought the taste detracted from the dish. I also skipped roasting the chiles and tomatoes, I just soaked the chiles for 30 minutes, and for the tomatoes, I used 2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes.

I made this for the first night of Hanukkah. I could not find the guajillo chiles, so I omitted them since I didn't know how much heat they would add, and we have some not so adventurous eaters and small children. Also, I substituted two 15 oz cans of Muir Glen Fire Roasted tomatoes instead of roasting my own. I followed the recipe otherwise and made the brisket the night before. On the night I was serving it, I just reheated it on top of the stove until the brisket pieces were warm enough to "pull". The flavor and texture of this was outstanding. I was really happy to hear my guests keep asking "pass the brisket, please."
