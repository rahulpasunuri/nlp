I made this cake for my future daughter in-law's bridal shower and it was a HUGE hit. Not only did everyone loved it but it's a very impressive looking cake. I must say I was a bit hesistant to make it because it starts with a boxed cake, but after reading all the great reviews, I had to try it. I'm definitely keeping this recipe and will make it again and again.

Made this for a small dinner party last night and it was a hit. I tossed the chocolate chips in about a teaspoon of cocoa, and they didn't sink. I think, however, that I would not use the chips next time. Although I usually like texture, I thought it was an odd texture with the cake.

Awesome! Very decadent-don't know if all the chocolate chips are necessary-one package would have been enough

This recipe is wonderful! I like to serve it in a trifle bowl - layer cake, frosting, then I add a layer of whipped cream. I usually have room for two layers. It's amazing!

This was great- the only changes I made- - I used mini morsels (needed a little more than 1 bag though) and also I only used 1/2 c. sour cream in the frosting. I too didn't use that much amaretto to moisten the cooled cake (just a touch was all it needed). I had no trouble with the frosting setting up. In fact, I let the frosting get too cold and had to briefly heat it up to make it spreadable again. I was worried I would ruin the frosting doing so, but it came out just wonderfully.

Give me a break!!! I spend all this time searching for 4 fork recipes and a cake mix recipe comes up? I am sure it is good but I thought this was a cooking site not a tips for instant box mixes site...

I agree with other reviewers. Marvelous cake -- runny icing. I love the flavor of the icing. I added another cup of confectioners sugar, but it was still runny. Any ideas?

YUMMY!!! This cake was an absolute keeper. Followed everything exact. Was a real show stopper. Not a bite left. Even my husband that does not like almonds loved the toasted almonds on the side. I also put chocolate shavings on the top.

I already made this recipe three times and every time it was wonderful. I used the cake layers and made it into a black forest torte. I frosted each cake layer with the chocolate frosting and then I put cherry pie filling and whipped cream between the bottom two layers. Then I covered the entire cake with whipped cream and chocolate shavings. I also used the mini chocolate chips, parchment paper, and 9 inch springform pans to bake the layers in. Everyone has been asking for the recipe!

Incredibly fast & easy to make and this cake is delicious. Every time I make it I get rave reviews. I make it in a Bundt pan rather than 3 small pans and it still turns out perfect.

Have made this cake twice. Everyone loved this very moist chocolatey cake. The addition of the Amaretto adds great flavor. Followed directions & ingredients exactly as stated. Easy to make, turned out perfect. Will definately make again.

I used two cake pans. The cake was entirely too moist to ice. It was still awesome. It makes a great birthday cake for any chocolate lover.

The perfect cake for chocoholics. Was very easy to make, but looked & tasted professional. I lined my pans with parchment paper as others suggested and had no problems. My family is not crazy about nuts, so I substituted mini choc. chips to decorate the sides. I might use a little less Amaretto next time. The icing was perfect (used light cream and light sour cream b/c I had them) & I will use it with other cakes.

I made this cake for Christmas dinner and it turned out delicious. I used mini-chocolate chips and it was fine. It did take a bit longer to bake in my oven. For the frosting, I followed the directions, but used less sour cream and more sugar. It turned out perfect!

Definitely use shortening instead of spray on. The cake is very good. The frosting--I left out the sour cream and increased the powdered sugar by 1/2 cup. That made a perfect glaze for the cake! Otherwise it just doesn't spread or taste right. I made it for a birthday party of women and several went back for seconds. It was a hit. I will make it again.

I just made the cake portion of this recipe for someone's birthday bash, but it was delicious -- moist, rich, dark and heavenly. I can't wait to try the frosting part of the recipe, too. Thanks, Epicurious (and Connie!)!

This is one of the best cakes I have ever made. If you are a chocolate addict like myself this will give you a great chocolate fix.

I baked the cake with lots of expectations. First, the batter(according to the recipe), is just enough for one layer, no more than that. Second, the icing never got thick enough to spread. I have to run to the store and buy me some already made frosting, I was alredy late waiting for the icing in the fridge. Next time I make the cake I would double the ingredients, and use my own buttercream icing recipe.

Wonderful! I got so many ooohhhs and aaahhhs from coworkers when I brought this for an office birthday celebration. I used all of the amaretto called for in the recipe and did not hear anyone say it tasted strong (and believe me, my coworkers would be honest). The flavor is great and so rich. I was asked by several for the recipe. A definite chocolate fix!! As I was making this for a crowd, I made two 9x13 layers with no adjustments to the cake ingredients. The cooking time was appx 20 minutes, I simply kept testing it every few minutes after 10 minutes in the oven. I used mini chocolate chips and dusted them with flour. I still had some stick to the bottom of the pan but it was no problem. I doubled the frosting ingredients and ended up not using some of it; however, based on the reaction from the crowd at work, I should have piled it on! Enjoy this recipe, it's a good one!

DELICIOUS.Very easy to make & made an elegant desert for a dinner party I had. I also dusted the chocolate chips with flour & had no problem with them sinking or sticking to the bottom. Did not add Amaretto on the cake after cooking.My kids also loved it saying it was the best chocolate cake.

This cake is classy and easy! I have made it several times, and a friend of mine also commented that she would expect something like this from a pricey restaurant. I will use small chocolate chips from now on - I used large ones before and had some trouble turning the cakes out of the pans. It was still a really great cake, though!

Delicious! Though I really wanted to make a "home-made" cake, after reading the reviews for this cake I was swayed. And I am so glad that I was! This cake is easy to prepare, scrumptious, and of bakery quality. Toss the chocolate chips with a bit of flour and make sure you grease the pans well, and you shouldn't have any problems turning the cakes out. I am making the frosting again today for a yellow cake b/c it was such a hit with this recipe last week. Enjoy!

I doubled this recipe and made it in an 18" x 12" pan for my husbands 50th birthday party. I split the layers using a thin plastic cutting board to separate them. Turned out great!!! I am going to use the same recipe for a Mexican themed teachers luncheon our PTA is sponsoring but substituting Kahlua for the Amaretto.

One bit of advice: shortening is required to keep cake from sticking. Skip the non stick spray & use shortening, dust the chocolate chips with flour and shake off excess so they don't sink to bottom. Sprinkling chips on the top of the pan was a good idea, too. I baked 2 layers, increased the baking time and needed less frosting but had to add half cup of powdered sugar for better consistency. Everyone love this very rich chocolatey cake. Cut small pieces!

Would like to try this recipe. However, I only have 2 9-inch cake pans. Has anyone tried it in 2 pans instead of 3? And how would one modify the oven temp and baking time? Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you.

I sprayed with non-stick spray and used parchment rounds and lightly sprayed again. Came out like a charm and parchment peeled right off.

The cake is simply delicious. I made it for a dinner party. But much like Stacey, the cake did crumble. The party was informal - and the guests loved the crumps but how can you prevent this is the future? And I did spray the bottom of the pan and put the chocolate morsels in the mix last?

Spectacular dessert. I didn't take the time to read the recipe closely and ended up adding all 12 tbls. of the amaretto to the cake batter. So I omitted the almond flavoring and baked it in one small (6")springform cheesecake pan and one 8" layer cake pan. The 6" layer because it was higher, baked a little longer - until a cake tester inserted came out clean. The 8" layer baked as directed. I made the icing and just had enough to frost the 6" layer which I split in half. I am going to make a cream cheese frosting for the single 8" layer. I used a very good quality bittersweet chunk of chocolate for the icing and it was wonderful. A real chocolate lovers delight. My husband said it was too rich but I see him going back again and again to cut a piece. He finally said it was addicting. I gave a piece to a neighbor and she just asked me for the recipe. If you had five forks, that's what I would give it. I used large chocolate chips in the cake batter but next time I will use the mini chips.

Made this for a supper club. Superb!! Not a crumb left! After reading other reviews I opted to reduce the amount of Amaretto used to brush layers to 2 tblsp. for all 3 layers, not each layer. Sprinkled choc chips on top of layers just before baking -preventing too much settling. Will make again and again.

I followed the recipe except for brushing the cake with Amaretto (forgot) and it was fantastic. A little tough to get out of the pan - the chocolate chips settle on the bottom - but other than that it was perfect. I highly recommended this easy and elegant cake.

This was one of the best chocolate cake recipes I've had. The amaretto flavor made it especially rich and different. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems.

I'm not a happy camper. I followed the directions exactly, but this thing is a disaster. I was supposed to be making it for a gift, but now I'm not so sure I'll give it. The cake layers broke into 4 pieces when I tried to transfer them to the cake plate to frost. I didn't have enough frosting for the whole cake-parts of cake keep poking through. I even double checked the recipe to see if I'd screwed up. I'm sure it will taste ok, but it looks like a 2 yr old made it, and I'm not a novice. Maybe I'm just grumpy today, but I'm pretty sure I'll never attempt this again unless I'm in a mood to throw a few hours away experimenting on a known failure.

Fabulous, rich chocolate cake--I've made it several times. I also skipped the brushing the amaretto on layers step and found the amount of almond flavor just right. The chocolate chips stick to the bottom of the cake pan--might try parchment on the bottom or something next time. I'm about to try a Kahlua/coffee version and will see if it translates. Great cake.

My husband says this is the best chocolate cake he's ever had! I didn't brush the amaretto on every layer though since I thought it sounded like it would be over-powering. I only used it in the cake mix and frosting.

I am an avid "from scratch" cake baker, however I was lazy and looking for a quick chocolate fix. This cake filled the bill! Because the layers cook very fast, the chocalate chips don't really melt making the texture very chunky. I would recommend breaking up the chips before adding them to the batter to better distribute the chips and even out the texture. I did have to add more powdered sugar to the frosting as it was a little bitter. Because I was feeling so lazy, I skipped the step of brushing the layers with amaretto plus my husband does not like strong liquor flavors on his desserts (party pooper!) In doing that the amaretto flavor was more subtle but still recognizable. The frosting is very good and super easy to make. I skipped the almonds on the side (so lazy) and made a simple circular knife pattern to pretty it up. Yummy!
