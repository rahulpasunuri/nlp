This is a wonderful salad. Not sure why it's had such bad reviews. The dressing is delicious and goes great with the healthy and beautiful sald. It really is worth a try.

I didn't feel like this salad was all that wonderful. The problem was the dressing which wasn't spicy enough. I may try it again and try and spice it up.
