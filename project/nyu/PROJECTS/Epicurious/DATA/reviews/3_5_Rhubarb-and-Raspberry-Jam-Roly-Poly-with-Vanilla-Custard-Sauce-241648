Completely agree with the other British cooks - this is nothing like the British pudding it purports to be. I should have known from the odd description (jelly-roll, scones!?), the fact that someone said they'd rather "just make scones", and the fact that people are trying to eat this for breakfast! A real roly poly pudding is, as already noted, made with suet or lard, and steamed - the result should be a sticky, sweet, hot dessert nobody could mistake for breakfast. Look elsewhere for a recipe if you want to try an actual roly poly pudding - even better, try doing one with Golden Syrup - you can find it in Loblaws if you live in Canada, like this ex-pat :)

I've never had this hold up; it always flattens AND oozes when I make it. But it's absolutely delicious and nobody cares a jot. I skip the custard and just pour a little half and half over the top. I always have a little too much jam + rhubarb, too, so I save it and add a bit on top with the cream. I've had nothing but rave reviews and have served it about half a dozen times now!

Jam is delicious but I found that too much jam oozed out. I didn't even put all of the filling in so at least I had extra to dollop once sliced. I think I would prefer to just make scones and and keep the jam on the side.

I don't know what a roly poly is supposed to taste like but I thought this was delicious and is great as dessert and breakfast.

This isn't a British roly-poly at all: it's supposed to be steamed, filled with jam and made with suet or lard. You can find authentic roly poly recipes on the internet.

In a traditional jam roly poly recipe, the fat is suet, which you can get in the UK in a vegetarian version. The frozen butter replaces the suet, which is solid at room temperature. I loved the filling, though found the crust a little chewy and had to drain the fat out of the pan half way through cooking. Will stick to my normal vegetarian suet roly poly recipe.

Absolutely love this recipe. Made the custard with whole milk, not half and half and it was still delicious. You need to seal this carefully to prevent ooze. Everyone loved it!!

Made this with poppy seed cake and pastry filling instead of the rhubarb and raspberry jam.My mom from Russia makes this poppy seed rolls with yeast dough. Me and my husband liked this recipe better. I did not make the custard. It was wonderful with powdered sugar on top. Very good for breakfast.

YUM! Made this for our Supper Club (Irish theme) and everyone loved it. I wasn't thrilled about the way the custard turned out, but I think that was my fault. I must have cooked it too long. Anyway, no one seemed to notice. Also had a little trouble rolling the pastry. Lost a lot of the filling at the end when it oozed out, but it still was moist and wonderful!
