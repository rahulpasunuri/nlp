After sprinkling w/ Parmesan, return to broiler to melt Parm so it won't fall off!

Straightforward and easy - I used 3/4 cup polenta, halved the Parmesan, and added some fresh parsley and black pepper. Great do-ahead recipe.

I used plain yellow polenta, fresh thyme, and less than half the cheese. For guests, I would use the recomended amount of cheese. Use the very best quality fresh Parmesan you can find and your fav. homemade red sauce. Yum!

Be sure to use stone ground corn meal. I substituted one can of vegetable stock. Add diced roasted red peppers at the end.
