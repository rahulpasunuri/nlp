This recipe produces a dense, rich, bread-like cake. It's essential to allow the honey syrup enough time to completely soak the cake - overnight worked for me. The cake is better the next day. I substituted cream of rice for the farina to accomodate a food allergy and it turned out great!

I just made this recipe and found it very heavy and paste like. I am actually wondering if there might have been a misprint concerning the recipe? In the past I have found the recipes in this magazine to be very reliable.
