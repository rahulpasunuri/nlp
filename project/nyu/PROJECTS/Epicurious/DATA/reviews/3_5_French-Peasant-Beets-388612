This was good - I've never had beets before but had some in my CSA. The flavors are great together and it's very filling. Would probably add just a little more salt throughout the cooking time, though. Not sure if I'd make it again but it was satisfying nonetheless. If you aren't sure that you like beets but want a try - this is a good recipe to start!

I was just looking for ANYTHING to do with all the chard and beets in my fridge, and I was concerned about putting them together until I found this. Do everything Amy N-B says: the boucheron is exactly the right cheese to compliment the sweetness of the beet, but don't underestimate the importance of pairing this with a sweet-but-dry wine. I couldn't find a muscadet, and the sauvignon blanc I substituted was a bit too tart (though fig notes helped!).
