This was probably the best burger we ever had. I made the demi glace with lamb instead of veal because it's what I had but it was still delicious. I agree with the reviewer that though a bun would ruin it. I just served it without the bun and added a side of steamed asparagus. I cut up a crusty loaf into bruschetta and served it on the side. I guess I would call it a deconstructed burger. We licked our plates!

This is the first time I have ever had dinner guests ask for ketchup! The demiglace cooked for four hours, exactly per instructions. I thought the problem was that it shouldn't be served as a hamburger, because the bun covered up the delicate taste of the meat and the sauce. However I note that those who enjoyed it did a lot of doctoring to the demiglace or the meat, or both. I'm tempted to try it again without the bun, but maybe I better add some more kick to the meat and sauce also.

Well, this was quite a tasty burger, although I added a bit to it. To make it a real Italian country bear jamboree, I added dried thyme, oregano, garlic powder, chopped onion, one egg, a little tomato paste and minced fennel to the burger meat. I let the sauce (made with some d'artagnan demi-glace) boil a while (I added some salt, that seems to really "turn on" the flavor in demi-glace), and it started to take on a really wonderful aroma that smelled like the lovechild of wine and butter. If you don't make the sauce, don't worry! So juicy! This is the only sort of burger I think I could stand to eat without ketchup!

The burgers were super tendar and quite nice but lacking in spices. The demi glace was a lot of work and provided little flavor. I would make this again but put more seasonings in the burger itself and maybe a different sauce on top.

this is great! forgot to buy demi-glace and didn't miss it. plenty complex as it is... the mushroom flavor was strong. i went lightly on the cheese, afraid it would mask all other flavors, but went back for more. the best recipes are ones that take tasty ingredients and combine them to compliment and balance each other, and this one does, much more than i had anticipated. i added a slice of yellow tomato and used very fresh, peppery arugula that was quite strong, and loved it.

This is a wonderful way to dress up a burger. I have had nothing but raves every time I serve it.

This was one of the worst burgers I have ever had. The only thing we liked was the arugula. It tasted like a crappy salisbury steak.

I made these burgers and simply ommited the demi-glace altogether. I thought that they sounded decadent enough without it and I didn't want to spend the time making it. I would try it with a store bought demiglace but I thought that they were fabulous without it. I grilled the burgers in a grill pan instead of broiling them, as my broiler is scary. I served them with sea salt and rosemary french fries and a baby arugula salad. YUM!

This is a great burger recipe. Why all this burger bashing? Burgers have become a frequent menu item at trendy restaurants. I made the demi-glace myself and was pleased with the results. However, I would not be adverse to buying a bottle at Williams Sonoma - I just never thought of it at the time.

To all who had trouble with the demi-glace, make it easy on yourself and do what I did: head over to Williams Sonoma and pick up a jar of their veal demi-glace...it's fabulous! In all honesty, I'll spend my time making a demi-glace from scratch when the nether world freezes over. :)

Ok so it's "just" a burger, but it's the best burger I've ever had! It's even better than some steaks & several other dishes I've had. Besides, in these diet crazed times - isn't the idea of a burger and nice Cote du Rhone sound not only decadent, but comforting on a cold Sun night? To make faster & almost as good - subsitute regular mushrooms: minces & sauteed, and store bought beef stock. I also tried with ground lamb - marvelous! Even my mushroom & blue cheese despising boyfriend LOVED this burger!

I rated this a 2 only because this dish would not be worth making a real demi-glace for (stock alone takes 8-10 hours!) However, if you have some leftover (as I did), then this is a pretty good dish. And, yes, a real demi-glace is bound with a little flour. As far as veal is concerned, leave poor Elizabeth alone . . . While I agree with Fresno's comment completely, there's nothing wrong with picking your battles. It's just a matter of where one draws the line. It's a personal decision, and one should not be mocked having convictions. So much better than people who make no attempt to right some of the "wrongs."

I would also like to make a comment to Elizabeth Abbott. As one other reviewer stated, not all veal are raised in confinement. However, please remember that it could be considered cruel to kill any animal for food. I might suggest that you visit a slaughterhouse and see if your sensibilites are offended. These are, after all, food animals. In some parts of the world, dogs and cats are consumed. Cruel? It depends upon your cultural frame of reference. There is also some scientific evidence that plants feel "pain" when they are cut or harvested. Do you plan on starving Elizabeth? I have not tried this recipe, but plan on doing so. Please do not rate a recipe simply because you have an issue with the ingredients.

This does not taste bad BUT it is definately not worth the time or expense for a glorified hamburger. This is a classic "let's dress up a simple recipe with fancy ingredients" recipe. Arugala? Use romaine. Porcinis? Save time and just top a burger with some sauteed baby bellas. Sourdough and gorgonzola are the real flavors here, and you can't go wrong. I genuinely think if I just reduced canned beef broth with a bit of ketchup in it, it would have turned out the same.

I am in the process of making this recipe. Maybe someone can help me with the demi-glaze. Yesterday I made the demi-glaze exactly like the recipe said, however it came out like water. It was reduced to one cup.What can I do to correct this? Any suggestions will be appreicated

Definetely not worth the amount of time it took to cook. Sauce was good, but at the end, a burger is a burger and not a Sunday dinner!!!

Loved this recipe. As for useing veal or not, substitute. I used beef joints to make my stock and the flavor was just fine for me. I also used shitaki mushrooms in mine, very nice flavor. Please excuse the dyslexic finger spelling, =P

To Elizabeth Abbott: I share many of your concerns regarding veal, however not all veal calves are raised that way. What I found most intriguing was that you rated this recipe with one fork. Rendering a rating usually indicates that you have actually made the recipe. So, did you make this dish and, if so, did you substitute some other meat bones for the veal??? Do tell Elizabeth! Really not fair to give a rating if you have not made the recipe and only wish to comment on the lack of political correctness regarding the ingredients.

I would never make anything that is made of veal - for a very simple reason. It is completely inexcusable how veal is "made". Confining a cow to a stall that they can't even turn around in for months on end is barbaric and cruel. And I want nothing to do with it. The thought of eating veal disgusts me, as it should any other compassionate human.

I'm sure this is a fine recipe... but paleese don't call it a demi-glace. It would qualify for a glace... but demi-glace is 1 part brown stock and 1 part brown sauce (espagnol), reduced by one-half.

Very nice. Used Shiitake mushrooms instead if Porcini, added some demi-glace to meat mixture and the flavor of the meat was wonderful. Cooked meat exactly as directed and came out medium rare. Unable to find slices of Gorgonzola so I used crumbled. Froze left over meat and can't wait to make it again.

Unfortunately, I only had regular lean hamburger and yet this was delicious. Next time I'll use sirloin; it would be so much better.
