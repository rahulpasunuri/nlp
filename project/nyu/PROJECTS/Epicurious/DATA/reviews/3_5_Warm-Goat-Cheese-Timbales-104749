5/22 This was served at a friend's dinner party and it was a hit. We all loved it. I have made it twice now. I am going to try adding a little stronger goat cheese and a hint of garlic next time - just for fun. That said, it is delicious just like it is.

Easy and turned out well - but bland. Goat cheese alone would be better than this recipe. I won't make again.

The timbales are great and left over timbales will be nice the next day. With this recipe, you have 4 unused egg yolks, so consider whipping up home made mayonnaise or aioli while you're at it.

Great recipe. Easy to make. Next time I might add a vinagrette as a salad dressing and top off with a few toasted pine nuts.

This was a real hit with all guests at a recent dinner party. It's easy, attractive and delicious. I will certainly make it again and again.

I just made this for a dinner party and everyone was raving about it. It is simple and makes a beautiful presentation. I doubled the recipe to make 12 and it worked out perfectly. My only suggestion--if you can present the timbales top up, not inverted, because they are much prettier. Inverted the they look a little plain but top up they are nice and slightly browned. I baked them a little longer than the recipe called for just until they rose up slightly puffed like a soufle. Wonderful.

Made this last month, and my friend and I just loved them!! They hold up beautifully and have a wonderful goat-cheese flavor without being overbearing. Simply marvelous, easy to prepare and can't wait to make again and again! KIMBER
