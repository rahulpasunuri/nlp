these are the easiest cookies i've ever made. would be great to whip up for a quick desert when friends are over. i added a bit of flour to hold it all together and made them about 2" balls. 2 batches made 35 cookies. added choc chips too. very good.

We LOVE these. They are also an acceptable choice for people with high blood sugar as long as you use less sugar or a sugar substitute. Easy to make and delicious. I followed the suggestion of some of the reviewers and added 1 TBS flour and a little vanilla & salt.

It's perplexing how four ingredients can pop out of my oven cookie-shaped and delicious. I've made them twice in a row in the unbearable heat, and I don't even like PB to start with. They're like a dream come true: one bowl, ridiculously quick/foolproof, and easily manipulable. I halved the sugar 'cause otherwise it'd be nauseatingly sweet, added a dash of vanilla + a dash of almond (it makes it 2x better), 2 T brown rice flour, and a bit of salt. If you're lazy like me, you can eyeball all the ingredients. With that said, too much PB makes it spread, but if you use an airbake sheet, too much PB will make it divinely crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside after 12 mins.

My husband asked me if I put crack in these, because after he ate a couple all he could think of was "COOKIE COOKIE COOKIE!!" I followed the recommendation to add one T of flour, one tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp salt.

have been making for years. This time did add the 2 tbsp flour, vanilla and salt. Used peanuts crushed at store so no oil, salt added. Added choc chips and they are yummy. So easy!! Just love this recipe (even we have changed it ;) But good as original too.

followed the suggestion of other reviewers to add vanilla, salt, and flour. Cookies were soft and delicious. Definitely did not yield 70 cookies. I got about 18 regular size cookies out of the batch. Would definitely make again.

This was ridiculously easy, and the cookies turned out delicious. I followed the recipe exactly with one exception: I placed a semi-sweet chocolate chip on each cookie after they came out of the oven. I used Kraft creamy peanut butter, and the cookies took 8 minutes in my oven. Letting the cookies sit for a minute or two on the pan is essential or they will fall apart the second you touch them. As well they are crumbly on the cooling racks, however, they are delicious and melt in your mouth. I think they would be wonderful with crunchy peanut butter too, or with a peanut half placed on each cookie. I measured out the cookies as I rolled them and got 49 cookies from the recipe.

Oh my, these are good. The recipe is ridiculously easy. I followed it exactly, except I had to use maple sugar because my husband can't eat too much cane sugar. For me the recipe yielded 60 cookies. They spread out quite a bit in the oven, and ended up about 2 inches in diameter. The texture is heavenly -- they're crispy to the tooth, but then they melt in your mouth. I think I will dream about them tonight. I took others' suggestion and used a garden-variety peanut butter: Skippy Creamy. Maybe it's the maple sugar, but the flavor is rich and complex. I wouldn't hesitate to serve these alongside the best homemade ice cream.

Yum! My husband was thrilled with these! As per several reviewers, I added 1 tsp vanilla (beaten into egg), 1/2 tsp of salt (mixed with baking soda), 1 T flour (mixed in at the end). I also topped with Turbinado sugar before putting in the oven. I dropped them with a 2 Tablespoon sized scooper- this actually only yielded 12-15 cookies, but then I never seem to get as many cookies as the recipes tell me I should! For those who said they weren't chewy- perhaps you over-baked? These are amazingly chewy and moist! I am adding this to my binder of recipes at this moment.

Not sure what I did wrong. I think maybe my peanut butter was a bad choice as it's all natural and contains no oil, salt, etc.? My cookies turned out crispy on the outside and mostly hollow on the inside..? I have never had this problem before but maybe I needed butter or flour or just somthing to give them more substance.

I have made these cookies twice now and they are great! How can you go wrong with only four ingredients? I did not grease the baking sheet and used either a silpat or parchment paper. I found that the parchment paper was too non-stick and the cookies would stick to the fork when I was flattening them out. The silpat worked better for flattening, but ultimately both parchment and silpat baked the cookies the same. I also found using a large fork, such as a serving fork, worked better then forks with small tines as the cookies stuck to the forks with small tines. Immediately after the cookies came out of the oven I placed a large Ghirardelli chocolate chip in the middle. EVERYONE loved them, especially my gluten intolerant coworker. I have tried other peanut cookie recipes that have been okay. What I like about this recipe really is that it gives you a really peanutty flavor!

Rating: 4
Yum! I followed the pther reviewer's suggestions to add vanilla (1 tsp), salt (1/2 tsp) and flour (2 tbsp). What I love about these cookies is how nutty they are. And how EASY they are to make! However, the yield of 70 cookies seems like a stretch. I got about 24 cookies. Of course, the type of peanut butter you use will really impact the outcome of the recipe. If you are using a peanut butter with a lot of added sugar, you might want to cut down on the sugar in the recipe. Also, don't try eating these cookies straight out of the oven, they will just crumble and collapse in your hand.

I admit I haven't read all the reviews so I don't know if someone else has suggested this, but here's my fix to this recipe: 3 c. creamy PB (don't use the fancy organic stuff), 3 c. sugar, 3. t. B.S., and 4 (FOUR!) eggs. Changes the cookie completely and makes it light and crispy. And flourless, for my celiac friends.

This is a good way to get rid of sub-par peanut butter that your roommate puts on your shelf after s/he eats your entire first jar. Good news is, now the roommates are eating the cookies like they're street drugs and I don't have any more bad peanut butter! I used crunchy and it was delicious. Added 1t vanilla, a little handful of flour. I beat the sugar and egg together, then added the peanut butter, then added the other stuff. I should have put the vanilla in with the sugar/egg mixture. Also, I would add the baking soda to this initial liquidy mass... I was worried it didn't get evenly distributed at the end. A good recipe for easy peanut butter cookies. They're really sweet.

To tell the truth, I had a part-jar of Costco Organic Peanut butter that kept separating -- no matter how hard I stirred -- that I wanted to use up. I read over 100 reviews of this recipe and decided to try it. It works -- long beating (5 minutes) makes a cookie dough that can be handled. However, adding chocolate chips breaks the dough, never to come together again! (until you squeeze it with your hands) The cookies are delicious! However, the next time, I pushed chocolate chips into them after forming. Having read most of the reviews, I used 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown and added vanilla. Following other reviewers advice, let the cookies cool on the baking sheet - a long time! Like another reviewer, I would have given this recipe 3 1/2 forks -- its good and fast. To sum up from my experience: 1. Trust the recipe -- it works! 2. Beat the egg-sugar mixture for a couple minutes then add peanut butter. 3. Beat again -- walk away! Let it beat. 4. Don't add chocolate chips to the "not dough" -- add on top if you want. 5. Make them big, make them small -- just adjust the baking time. 6. The peanut butter you use makes a difference! The fact that I wanted to get rid of a product I found unacceptable as a spread made my first batch oily before baking -- but quite good. Repeating the recipe with another brand of organic peanut butter made better cookies.

Like others, I added 1 tbsp flour, 1 tsp vanilla, and for the sugar I used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown. They were great! They are a bit crumbly when you just bake them so you HAVE to let them cool fully. After that they are fine! In case you are wondering I used Jif Extra Crunchy and added Reeses Peanut Butter morsels to them.

I followed others suggestions about the 1/8c flour and tsp vanilla, but instead of flattening them down, I rolled them into balls about 2/3 size of a munchkin and rolled it in granulated sugar and baked for 7 minutes or so and then took them out and immediatly pushed a Hershey kiss into the center of each. They almost looked a little raw in the middle but when they cooled, they were slightly chewey and the sugar coating gave them a crispiness too. YUM!

This was great. They were really easy to make and were simple. I found that they were very crumbly, which I don't always like but they were still delicious. I added a teaspoon of salt just because my peanut butter was unsalted and that made them very bland, so make sure you check the label.

Before I'm yelled at, I marked it "good" because it /is/ good. I made the recipe by the book - I didn't add brown sugar, didn't add flour, baked them 10 minutes. The cookies are /crumbly/. I don't like crumbly cookies unless they're shortbread. I like peanut butter cookies to be sweet, peanut buttery, and chewy. This recipe has all of that except the chewiness. This recipe isn't horrible. It's just not exceptional. There are better recipes out there.

Like others I thought something must be missing from this recipe. So I made a different one instead. The cookies turned out very dry. So I thought, what the heck, I try the one without the flour. Also like other reviewers, I split the sugar equally between brown and granula and added vanilla. I halfed the recipe, carefully leveled off each teaspoon and came up with 30 cookies - so not so far off the quoted amount. The cookied come out the size of an Oreo...and make a great sandwich cookie themselves with a dab of Nutella between. Great taste, nice and chewy.

The recipe was good in a pinch (I wanted to bake cookies and I didn't have any brown sugar), as you're pretty much guaranteed to have these ingredients on hand. Overall, though, I would not go out of my way to make these again; there are definitely better peanut butter cookies out there. I found them a bit too sugary and granular. Still, not bad for the simplicity of the recipe.

I couldn't believe this recipe was right with just four ingredients. I did what others recommended -- 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar and a splash of vanilla. (how can you have cookies without vanilla?!) I doubled the recipe and ended up with 36 cookies! -- far from the anticipated amount. I made the cookies 3" in diameter -- a real cookie size, in my opinion. These look great and taste great. Perfect for the Boy Scout camp out. Do keep them on the sheet to cool a bit before removing, though. Definitely do again. Four ingredients.....amazing!

Last Christmas I bought a jar of Almond Butter to use in a green bean recipe and since then I have been looking for a recipe to use the rest of it...when I saw this one I thought I would try it out...so here are my recomendations.....I did use two tablespoons of whole wheat flour (I can't seem to make a cookie without a bit of flour, I am not sure if it helped in the recipe but I felt better adding it)....and added a teaspoon of vanilla as some of the other reviews have suggested but my biggest change was the Almond Butter...I served these last night at a dinner I had with ice cream and they got rave reviews.....so if peanut butter is not your thing...try almond butter...it works just as well, or as my husband said, "even better". Next time I might try adding some chopped almonds to the batter.

I love these too. Just made for the first time. Quick and easy. I agree...the 70 cookies must be an error. I measured level teaspoons carefully (didn't eat any dough!) and got 43 cookies. I used half brown and half granulated sugar.Undermeasured to cut the sugar and they are still sweet, almost acramel-like chewness (baked for 7.5minutes.) Used Trader Joe's Organic natural peanut butter stirredwell before measuring. Next timeI will press mini chocolate morsels into the tops before baking.

I loved these cookies! They were so quick and easy, a big hit with my family and freinds too. When I was making them though i found that they were a little to sticky so i added some flour, but other then the they surrpassed my expectations in taste for so simple a recipe.

This was a really good, really quick recipe. I made it quickly for some people who were simply dying for pb cookies.

i thought this recipie was great. Alot of people were complaining about the dough being crumbly...but i basically followed this recipie exactlly and they turned out fine. The only thing i did change was doing half and half brown/white sugar, as well...i didnt have quite enough pb so i added a few tbsp's of nutella - worked out wonderfully! i think next time i would add even more - perhaps 2/3's to 1/3 pb to nutella. very delicious results. Otherwise though this recipie was great and nothing fell apart. The cookies are a bit more crumbly - but i find pb cookies generall are. Nice rich taste and stay together quite well :)

These cookies were so good. I was quite skeptical since there was no flour, so I too added about 1/2 tbsp flour (not sure if it really did anything). I also did 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar and added vanilla. Cooked them for about 8 minutes and they turned out perfectly soft and chewy. Best peanut butter cookies I've made.

Rating: 3
Technically this is a two-forker "like it, don't love it" but the dough tasted so good and I think a true PB cookie lover would have liked it more than I did, so three forks it is! I used organic PB from Costco, all white sugar and added some vanilla (I beat the egg and sugar first based on the reviews) and they came together perfectly, they didn't come out of the oven crumbly just a little dry. So I underbaked the next 2 batches, 6 minutes and then 4 minutes(best).... . I used a teaspoon and leveled it on the side of the bowl when rolling them out and there's no way this makes 70 cookies. 60 at best. At the end of the bowl I made a few bigger cookies (2 teaspoon balls) and when baked 4 minutes they were moist and chewey and more to my liking. The smaller, more crisp ones would be good to make a "sandwich" cookie... with some chocolate or frosting in the middle. I love how simple this recipe is, good project for kids. But I have to say, my toddler did NOT like them one bit.

Rating: 2
Ok - not great. They were very easy to make, but they came out dry. I think I might have made the cookies too small, so maybe that's why. Maybe I'll try again, but there are so many other recipes for peanut butter cookies out there that I don't know if it's worth it.

Rating: 2
Interesting cookie. Lacks the chewiness, texture and cohesiveness one with flour would have; not really what I consider a true cookie, but it is richly peanutty and sweet, crumbly, with the look of a cookie. I used 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar and even added two T flour and 3 t vanilla as previously recommended (only one of flour was recommended). Vanilla definitely helped, but flour was probably too little to be effective. The ommission of the butter was welcome from a calorie standpoint. However, I agree with a previous commenter that peanut butter cookies are really not something I want to see go low-fat. I would probably not make this again,as it is easy enough to add flour and more butter/sugar, for a true (sugar with peanut butter) cookie flavor and texture.

Rating: 3
these are really intensely peanut-buttery and delicious. if you really use level teaspoons, like it calls for, you really will get 70 cookies. and being tiny keeps them from crumbling. i also underbake these by a couple of minutes. you can press a hershey's kiss in the center of each right after you take them out of the oven and before transferring to racks for a special treat

I love these. I've made them several times and each time I get raves. I made them again last night and for the first time, the mix was very moist. I'm guessing that the brand of peanut butter makes a huge difference. I had used Kraft previously, and last night I used Jif. The cookies still taste great, but I like the texture of the Kraft peanut butter cookies better.

These are the best peanut butter cookies. The first time I made these as written and the batter crumbled up on me. I still used it but it wasn't easy to work with. The second time, I followed the advice to cream the sugar (I used half brown/white) and egg together and then added the rest of the ingredients (including a tsp of vanilla). Easy and delicious. For true peanut butter lovers. Would like to make them again and drizzle dark chocolate over. Either way, they would be -- and are -- terrific.

I love this recipe so much! I've never made peanut butter cookies the "old fashioned way" since finding these. Just a word of warning to the carb-conscious: I made these with splenda for a South Beach dieting friend and they were absolutely inedible. Something about the splenda with the peanut butter combined to make the worst tasting bitterness. I had to throw them out.

Quick, easy, and delicious! I too used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 Tablespoon flour. Each cookie was Tablespoon sized and baked for only 8 minutes. Because I used natural peanut butter they were rather crumbly, but after cooling a bit they worked out fine.

Sooo yummy! I've made these cookies four times in the past month! I used natural peanut butter and 1 tbsp butter in addition to the 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar, 1 tbsp flour and 1 tsp of vanilla recommended by other reviewers. Also added 1 cup of chocolate chips. Dee-licious! My husband says these taste like Reese's Peanut Butter cups, and I agree.

This recipe is fabulous! I don't know why anyone would have a problem. I used store brand crunchy peanut butter, 1 tsp vanilla and 3/4 cup all white sugar. I did mix all of the ingredients together first before I added the peanut butter and then added some cinnamon chips. They were easy to handle. I made about 1" diameter balls and cooked them about 8 minites. Made about 30. Turned out perfect.

I have a confession. I fully intended to make this recipe with the few minor modifications others had suggested (1T flour; mixture of white & brown sugar, and vanilla). However, I was a bit stressed (my attempt at a different PB cookie recipe failed) and kind of rushed the recipe. I LOVED the cookies however and was very relieved they tasted good. I used fresh, in-store ground organic peanut butter (which is all I have in the house). However, when I took another look at the recipe, I realized that I added a stick of butter to the recipe by mistake. Because I was curious, I made another batch without the butter. But, the batter never came together--it was like a bunch of brown pebbles. I forced it into balls, but they fell apart when I attempted to flatten with a fork. My guess is that the fresh peanut butter doesn't work with this recipe unless you add a stick of butter. They spread out quite a bit, so you can't really see the pattern, but the taste is delicious. I took the cookies to a party and everyone raved about them! Go figure!

I made two batches of these this weekend, both with great results. I followed the previous suggestion to beat the egg and sugar first then add the baking powder and peanut butter. I also added a bit of vanilla. The dough was easy to work with for the first trays into the oven, but it got a bit crumbly for the last few cookies. The heat of my hands was enough to make them stick again. I scooped them with a melon baller for nice small cookies and got 70, but these were tiny. This is my new favorite peanut butter cookie recipe.

I have been making this recipe for years, but off of the C&H sugar bag; instead of baking soda, it calls for 1 tsp vanilla. I get tons of requests for it, and I can't stop eating these cookies. They're so crispy, and not doughy and pasty like most peanut butter cookies.

very crumbly, especially before they've cooled, but a wonderful and wonderfully easy cookie. i add a tablespoon of flour as previously suggested, and use turbinado sugar, which, in my opinion, improves the cookie tremendously. the turbinado crystals lend a sweet crunch throughout the cookie that is quite delectable.

I have been using a chocolate chip peanut butter cookie recipe similar to this one for years. Try creaming the sugar and egg together with 1 tsp of vanilla until smooth.

This was my first time ever making a peanut butter cookie. These are a little on the sweet side and just a touch too crumbly. I would have liked the peanut butter flavor to be a bit stronger. But I do think I would try these again and perhaps do a bit of experimenting.. They are not far from the mark though.

These were gobbled up by all before they even cooled. Made about 2 dozen average size cookies (70 cookies??). Not sure why it happened, but as soon as I added the egg, the whole batter crumbled. That didn't stop me though; I simply squeezed the crumbles together, rolled it into a ball and pressed it slightly with the fork. Lovely.

I made these cookies for my 12 yr old's "comunity service cookie sale" at school. They turned great!! Everybody loved them, they were the first to sell. I loved them, my partner loved them, people at the office loved them. Everybody's constantly asking for me to make them again. I followed the advise by previous reviewers and did: 1/2 regular sugar 1/2 brown sugar, 1tsp vanilla, 1tsp flour, and chocolate chips. Mexican vanilla is one of the best in the world (sooo flavorfull); if you happen to come here, do not forget to get at least one bottle of it (soo cheap also). Take my word for it, I've lived all over the world bc of my job and the flavor and freshness difference is astounding.

So, I was so psyched to find this flourless peanut butter cookie recipe because I had lost the one I used years ago. I thought it was exactly the same, but these cookies turned out awful - had to throw 2/3 of the batter away. It might have been the peanut butter I used (Alberton's creamy brand - same exact ingredients as Skippy), but I don't know. I did add a tablespoon of flour, but the consistency was heavy, densy, greasy, and crumbly! The ones I have made in the past were amazing - and I always added a chocolate kiss after removing them from the oven, like a peanut blossom cookie. However, I usually don't press them down with a fork either. I was bummed that these didn't turn out like they did for all of the other reviewers...Don't think that living in Boulder (5,600 ft) should have anything to do with it - how could it, there is no flour! Will try again, just one mor time, with the highest quality of ingredients.

I was out of brown sugar and wanted to make some peanut butter cookies, and this recipe seemed perfect. The results were unspectacular, however -- plain, kind of dry cookies. Not overly crumbly, just dry and boring. Maybe if they were underbaked they'd be better, but I'm not likely to try again and tinker around with it.

I'd give this recipe 3 and a half stars if I could. A PB fanatic, I used crunchy and took previous reviewers' advice: used a little less sugar, added 1 t. vanilla, 1 T. flour, creamed PB & sugar for quite awhile (about 3 mins) and underbaked (about 6 - 7 mins, cookies will still be pale). 70 cookies if you follow the directions and really measure dough by level teaspoons. Tiny cookies compared to today's over-sized portions, but that's not a bad thing! Next time I'll follow the recipe to the letter but I always read (and usually follow) the tips in the reviews and haven't gone wrong yet.

I just love peanut butter cookies! This is so easy. I was looking for a recipe that didn't use brown sugar, since I was out. This is it. I halved the recipe & it only made 15 cookies. Can't see the complete recipe making 70! Read over the other reviews & had to add a little flour & some sugar on the top. Turned out fine.

I added a teaspoon of flour and a pinch of salt and cinnamon. I thought the batter was too oily, but the cookies came out great. Perfect combination of chewy and crunchy. My mom said they were the best she had ever had.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but just reading through it and some of the reviews sent me straight to the pantry to the box of Girl Scout DoSiDos! While I typically wouldn't think of a flourless cookie, this sounds great, and I can't wait to make it this weekend.

I followed the advice of those who have gone before by using half white and half brown sugar (for a total of one cup). Also added a pinch of salt, and couldn't resist putting in 1 tbs. of flour. I like these a lot. They're not fancy, just good comfort food.

these are quick and easy.I made them a little larger, about a 2 " cookie.I also added a 1/4 t of pumpkin pie spice, and 1/2 C of fairly fine chopped pecans.they were a little crumbly, I may try some sunflower qil next time, but just a small amount. very good!

Very peanut buttery, very chewy. I was supposedly making these as a part of the assorted cookie baskets we were giving as Christmas gifts. They disappeared so quickly before I could finish making the other cookies that my gift recipients got several of each other cookie and only one peanut butter cookie per basket.

You can't beat a peanut butter cookie that's almost purely peanut butter! If they happen to cook a little longer then you had hoped it's really good crumbled (which is really unavoidable) over vanilla ice cream.

I doubled the recipe, cut the sugar to 3/4 cup brown and 3/4 white vanilla sugar. I also used Adam's natural crunchy peanut butter - poured the oil off first. Baked for 10 minutes on a medium cookie scoop measure which is one tablespoon. It made 29 mediocore cookies which tasted a little better than the original recipe. This tastes very close to Fran McCullough's sugarless low carb cookie. I would say I would make this again for my grandson who cannot eat wheat flour. I probably would put some cinnamon in them to give them a kick.

Rating: 3
Easy, easy. I modified as follows: 1. Double the recipe and make generously sized cookies, not teeny ones 2. As others have stated, add 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar 3. Add roasted peanuts, chocolate chips, a dash cinnamon and a splash of vanilla 4. Bake on parchment paper and let cool 10 minutes. DELICIOUS!!!

Mmmm....myself, being a so-so peanut butter cookie lover thought these were pretty darned good. My husband, being a real peanut butter cookie lover, said "These are the best peanut butter cookies I've ever had."

I made these exactly as directed and I would definitely say these are mediocre.....period!! This is indeed an easy recipe but as far as I'm concerned, that's the only thing it has going for it. I didn't even like them enough to try to modify the recipe.

I just finished making these great PB cookies. What an easy recipe. I took the advise of some of the other reviewer's and use 1/2c brown sugar and 1/2c sugar, with 1 teasoon of vanilla. This recipe does not in any way make 70 cookies, I got 2 dozen and that was a stretch. I will make these again after my grandson Chad Michael approves.

I made these cookies twice. I think the brand of peanut butter makes a big difference: both times I used natural PB, but from different brands and they tasted different each time. They are very simple to make, and very good tasting. I also cut the sugar in half -- and it's just perfect. If your cookies are too dense, they are undercooked. If cooked properly, they have a crumbly cookie-like consistency.

I think I chose this recipe partially because it seems so improbable: a peanut butter cookie recipe without flour? I was amazed at how easily and quickly they came together, how beautifully they baked up ... and how quickly they disappeared! Mine were very light and crunchy, but after a day or two in a tin they softened a tad in the middle. Not the be all and end all of cookies, but so quick and easy I will make them again.

Rating: 3
The good thing about this recipe is that it does not contain the extra fat (butter) and carbo (flour)that other recipes call for. I also used less sugar to make the cookies. It was very simple to make, light, and tasty. However,if you want the rich and dense type of a cookie, this recipe is not for you.

Rating: 4
These are GREAT. I was craving sweets and they are so easy to make. I used natural peanut butter, which made them crumbly right out of the oven, but once they cooled they were fine (I just cooled them on paper towels, since the first one fell apart when I tried to put it on the rack). I took the advice of the reviewer below - half a cup of sugar is plenty.

If it looks too good to be true it is! I was browsing around, not for something easy, per se, but just for a different pb cookie recipe. I saw this one, thought for sure it would be panned by reviewers because of its simplicity, but was swayed by their overall comments. However, my experience was much different! These cookies just seemed lacking...lacking a well developed taste, texture, that oomph and delight you get when biting into a real good cookie. They're not unedible, but nothing to go crazy about.

My friend who works for Kraft uses a similar recipe in their test kitchen. It's 1 cup peanut butter, 1/2 cup of sugar, and one egg. That is it. We have toyed with many additions, including chocolate chips, raisins, etc, and we love the combo of white chocolate chips and dried cranberries, or chopped dried apricots and chocolate chips. It's such a great, easy recipe. I tried adding cinnamon chips last night, but it makes them a bit sweet.

I made these when the recipe first came out in Gourmet. Since then I've even seen it on the back of the sugar sack. These are the ultimate peanut butter cookies. There's no flour to dilute the flavor of the peanut butter. They are simple and awesome. One lady with whom I left some leftovers after a party said she ate these for breakfast the next day. What else can I say?! Throw out all of your other recipes and use only this one!

This was a great recipe, but a few changes made it even better. To cut down on sweetness, I used only 3/4 cup golden brown sugar, and added 1/4 cup flour. I also added 1 tsp. vanilla extract. Delicious!!

These cookies get an "A" for simplicity -- after making them once I have the recipe memorized, and there is little effort that goes into making these. I do not think, however, that these are the "end-all" in peanut butter cookies. They are too sweet, too oily (from 1 CUP of peanut butter!), and you can taste the baking soda. I'm likely to make them again because of they are so simple, but they don't belong in the file for showing off my baking skills.

These cookies are almost more like a peanut butter shortbread.......awesome for bake sales and cookie exchanges. Be *sure* to let them cool a bit before removing from sheets - they are very delicate when still warm. For me, using parchment paper has insured easy removal.

These cookies were as easy and delicious as everyone says. I used Simply Jif PB (reduced sugar) and dark brown sugar, used fork-squash method to crosshatch the cookies, baked on a Silpat, and let them cool 2 min. before lifting off sheet. I found no graininess and I didn't even use an electric mixer - I just beat the dough with a rather weak, bendable metal spoon! Make them small - they're rich!

Rating: 4
The cookies were easy to make and delicious to eat. I followed other review suggestions and added 1 tsp. vanilla, split the sugar (1/2 brown- 1/2 white) and beat the fire out of the peanut butter and sugars to get rid of graininess. Instead of patting down the balls, I placed them in a cupcake pan. Once cookies were done and removed from the oven, I placed and unwrapped mini-peanut butter cup in the center of each and then let the whole thing cool. Found that they indeed do need to cool for at least 2 min. or they fall apart. Doubled the recipe and got 48 nice sized cookies.

Rating: 4
A fabulous and easy cookie recipe! I gave it four forks, because it was so simple and produced such great results! I doubled the recipe and actually ran out of white sugar. I used some light brown sugar instead. I made these to take to co-workers while we worked on a project and they gobbled them all up in an hour. I'm making more tonight for my husband to take to work! I will agree with the other reviewers - I still didn't get 70 cookies with a double batch.

Rating: 4
Okay -- I've made this cookie recipe at least a dozen times. I use whatever peanut butter I have around -- usually Skippy or Jif creamy -- and regular sugar. I haven't experienced any of the "graininess" issues other reviewers have. I think one of the keys to success in this recipe is to really cream the peanut butter and sugar together in the mixer for a good long time -- I'm talking at least 1.5 minutes. If I'm not adding anything special (peanut butter chips, mini chocolate chips, etc.), I do the traditional "fork squash" methon to get the familiar peanut butter cookie grid. Oh -- I also love using a Silpat with this recipe. I let the cookies sit on the sheet for 2 minutes before removing them to a wire rack. Everyone I've ever shared these with have loved these cookies!

I used Laura Scudder's Natural Old Fashioned Peanut butter. I had purchased a large quanity of this peanut butter at Cosco, and no one in the family would consume it--the texture is too nutty and it's very salty. Thus, thought I'd use it in cookies to get rid of it! It works okay in this recipe, however, a regular creamy or crunchy (not Old Fashioned nor Natural Style) would be excellent and push it to four forks. The cookies are somewhat salty. Again, this is my peanut butter and the sugar in the cookies didn't completely melt, so it has a slightly granular feel. Great recipe--quick to make with little ones. I'll make it again with a common brand peanut butter.

Thought I'd weigh in on the great Mom-Mom Fritch Peanut Butter cookie debate. After coming up with a consensus culled from the other letters I made the recipe and not only was it one of the best pb cookies ever, the batter was one of the simplest to work with. Taking the advice of others, I used smooth peanut butter (Skippy) and a little less than a cup of baker's sugar. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. One reader's suggestion about using a melon baller to scoop out the batter was a great one--it made the dough really easy to handle. I also used an ungreased, dark, teflon-coated baking sheet and took the cookies out of the oven a minute earlier than the recipe called for. It yielded about 55 cookies. They disappeared in record time!!

The peanut butter flavor is good, but they're very dry and grainy. They have absolutely no moisture whatsoever. They're also very sweet. Do not eat these without liquid accompaniment (and a good toothbrushing later).

I used the new C&H Baker's sugar, to avoid the graininess some reviews complained. To actually get 70 cookies, simply follow the recipe; it calls for "level teaspoons" of dough. These are tasty cookies, easy to make.

While I am not a fan of peanut butter, these are really good! I took them to a church dinner, and not only did they dissapear, but I was asked by everyone for the recipe (with much disbelief when I told them how easy). To the person trying to make them low fat, the reason that they were oily is due to the "artificial" ingredients in your low fat peanut butter (read the label sometime!). Also, be aware that the fats in peanut butter are the healthy kind (in moderation), so there is no reason to mess with a good thing here. A great recipe for kids to "play" with.

We loved this recipe! For years I have tried recipes that contain flour only to find them somewhat bland tasting. After making these I finally had the taste of the cookies my grandmother made, yet no one had her recipe, so it went with her to the grave. We use chunky Jiff with this. Thanks to whoever sent in their "Mom Mom's" recipe. You have ended a 25 year quest for me!

I also used reduced fat Skippy peanut butter for this recipe, and contrary to what one would think, the dough was very oily. The resulting cookies were acceptable, but I have made much better peanut butter cookies, using flour. Perhaps, as other reviewers have said, the problem is the reduced fat peanut butter. Can someone tell me why a reduced fat peanut butter produces an oilier dough than normal peanut butter?

Like a previous reviewer, I made the error of using reduced-fat peanut butter; it was all I had in the house when a late-night cookie craving hit, but I'm sure experienced bakers won't be surprised to know that the cookies came out a little gummy and seemed too sticky-sugary without the real peanut butter to give them some substance. I also think 10 minutes in my oven was just a minute or so too long; they were nicely puffed but fell a bit just before I removed them. I would definitely like to try again with regular peanut butter; the recipe is extremely easy and the ingredients simple, so why not?

About 30 minutes have gone by since I found this recipe and ate one of the cookies! They're crisp melt-in-your-mouth, no mess cookies! A great high-altitude recipe. I wonder if the brand of peanut butter makes a difference for the people who had a bad experience -- I personally used Jif (creamy), which worked beautifully! Make them small -- they're rich!

If you are a peanut butter cookie (PBC) devotee then you have just found THE only best receipe in the history of mankind.You need never look farther for that elusive "perfect"PBC; you will be making it yourself. Two tips for those who may not have made PBC's before; dip your fork into flour before you make your traditional cris-crosses on the cookies.Second; make a double batch-no-one can resist these and they disappear like magic.

Rating: 2
I was slightly disappointed making these cookies after reading all the rave reviews. They weren't bad, but give me flour and butter any day. I had to rescue them from their own little puddle of grease after they'd been cooked. And better chew fast! They'll melt in your mouth faster than M&Ms and cotton candy combined. I would recommend letting them cool almost completely before removing them from the cookie sheet, else they will crumble badly. Also, I found using your hands instead of a spatula to remove them cut down on the crumbling also. These cookies would be a good cookie for someone who doesn't have a whole lot of time to bake or for a child to make on a rainy day.

Wonderful. I have made these several times to terrific reviews. My favorite aspect is that this is the perfect recipe for children to prepare. Simple, easy to follow, and so few ingredients. If you are introducing a child to the joy of the kitchen, you may want to start with this one. Yumm Yumm!

It's hard to imagine that such a simple recipe could yield such a delicious result! I had to take the cookies out early, as they tended to brown easily. Works for high altitude cooks. I didn't add chocolate chips; just a little cinnamon sugar on top. These are always a hit!

Just like everyone said, these were delicious. I doubled the recipe and added the vanilla and chocolate chips.

Is there ANYTHING more to say? 1.) TOO SWEET?: I've found that cheap store-brands of pb do fine, but that the sweetness varies widely by the amount of sugar in the pb, and the intensity/ domininance of the peanut flavor. 2.) ADD-INS TO TRY: I added freshly grated ginger to the dough a couple of times for a nice effect. Plan to try orange zest, &/or cinnamon. As far as "toppers", you can easily experiment with 2-3 cookies without committing the whole batch, using a "thumbprint" cavity!: I've added small cubes of sharp cheddar to some (good!), pecan halves (pretty good if your pecans are good to begin with), red cinn. hearts (okay), jam (okay). Press sprinkles of the decorating (?)pariels before baking (tiny, colored, candy balls) for added appeal to kids! 3.)A woman who makes this for our local farmers' market says the extra crunchy pb is too dry and crumbley, and the reduced fat pb's had not been satisfactory either.

File this one under strange but true. I suppose these might not satisfy the traditionalalist peanut-butter cookie fanatic, but I found them delicious and, as a bonus, quick and easy to make.

I love peanut butter cookies, but have always found something distasteful about them that I couldn't put my finger on. Well, now I know it was the flour! These cookies surprised me by being the peanut butter cookie I have always wanted. It just MELTS in your mouth (I love that!) and my husband and I really liked the sandy texture from the sugar. Most of all, there's no flour to mask the intense peanut butter flavor. I can't believe how easy they were to make. This is now my official peanut butter cookie recipe!

The flavor is delicious, but the texture is odd. It almost "melts" as soon as you get it in your mouth, which isn't exactly bad, but when I am in the mood for a cookie, I want to chew. Overall, it is a very simple, tasty treat that can be prepared with little effort (or ingredients!)

Wonderful, delicious, simple. I made these with creamy peanut butter, and got about 22 reasonably sized cookies. These are a bit fragile when they first come out of the oven, and they benefit from a few minutes rest to harden up before transferring to a rack to cool. I made these on a day when I had to bake something sweet to bring to someone's house, but was out of butter.

I'm not a big peanut butter cookie lover, so I made this recipie simply out of curiousity. I brought my first batch into work and it was gone in 5 minutes. Many people told me they were the best peanut butter cookies they'd ever had. I made them for my father in law, who loves peanut butter cookies, and he ate the entire batch in one day. Now, people at work ask me all the time, "When are you bringing in those great peanut butter cookies again." I make them about once a month and the entire batch is always eaten almost immediately. I do not modify the recipe at all, but may try some of the suggestions just for fun.

Wow. I didn't think I liked peanut butter cookies, but theses were great. Added the vanilla, of course, and used smooth peanut butter, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. It doubles well. An important note about cookie sheets: first of all, it's not necessary to grease them as these cookies, even when cooled 2 min. on the sheet, don't stick; second, be sure not to use insulated (Cushion Air, etc.) cookie sheets--regular sheets are better for cookie that will not fall apart. You can roll the balls in colored sugar before flattening, for the holidays.

When you want homemade peanut butter cookies fast, this is the recipe you would want to use. I would recommend only using smooth peanut butter because the dough is a bit on the dry side and the nuts tend to fall out. And no, unless you use a demitasse spoon to scoop out the dough, you will not get 70 cookies.

Remember they still cook while on the pan after you take them out. So if they look dark when you take them out of the oven get them off the pan!

I love this recipe because it's so easy! Following the advice of previous reviewers, I used less sugar and added a teaspoon of vanilla, creaming the sugar and egg first before adding the rest. One thing to be careful about is not to overbake. The ten minutes suggested in the recipe was too long for my oven, and the cookies in that batch were very crisp, black on the bottom. The next batch I put in for about 6 minutes and turned out MUCH better, nice and chewy, very rich tasting. I'm not a big fan of peanut butter cookies, but I thought it was great and my husband liked them, too.

Good... but not great. Melt-in-your mouth, soft and chewy is what I'm after in a "pb" cookie... I have a recipe from an '60s Betty Crocker cookbook that hasn't been surpassed as the best yet, even though I'm always looking. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white, which reduces the total sugar by 1/4 cup. Something seems to be missing - like vanilla. I also added chocolate chips on the top for another taste sensation.

excussseee me, cook from columbous,OH, this was the LEAST dissapointing of many, many recipies for me! The cookies were so easy to make, and my whole family loved them! We all agreed that these were the most outstanding peanut butter cookies ever! We took them to a block party and they were all gone in a matter of minutes!

I love this recipe! I make tiny cookies and freeze them to pull out later and serve with ice cream or sorbet. I first made them out of curiousity, but they are now one of my favorites. A great recipe to memorize and make on a rainy day at the beach.

Creaming the sugar and egg together first definitely helps combat the crumbliness. I added chocolate chips and the cookies turned out delicious!

If I can remember how to make this without the recipe then it must be easy. The cookies are excellent and by far the easiest I've ever made. (And I've made a lot.)

I have been a long time subscriber to gourmet, and have had success with all of their recipes over the years. This is probably the most disappointing recipe i have ever encountered. Exceedingly sweet. How could anyone ever get 70 cookies out of this recipe? I got 30 out of recipe.

What a great recipe--and so easy to make (and eat). I creamed the sugar and egg first as the previous cook suggested, and then let the finished cookies cool a couple of minutes on the baking sheet before transfering to the cooling rack. This seemed to take care of the crumbles. Happy eating!

These cookies were inhaled by everyone that I work with. If you find the dough crumbly, cream the egg and sugar first, then add the peanut butter and baking soda.

These are very tasty and have a great texture. Great with chocolate chips! The crumbliness is very annoying, however. I lost half of the cookies to crumbs. Any suggestions?

A very enjoyable and easy cookie recipe. These cookies went very fast at our 4th of July picnic and I recommend them to all peanut butter lovers!! The only thing people may dislike about them is that they are a crunchier cookie. And unlike the yield I only got 50 out of the recipe.

These cookies were great, half of them were gone before they had a chance to cool.

This recipe was surprisingly very good. I wasn't sure since the recipe doesn't call for flour or butter. I've already given the recipe out to my friends who have sampled the cookies! Also, they take very little time to throw together which I find to be a real plus.

Has got to be the simplest cookie recipe ever...but definitely does not make 70 cookies.

I made these cookies with 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of the white sugar and they turned out great. The cookies were richer and less sweet.

Do not use low fat peanut butter. It changes the texture.

These are perfect for last minute occasions. They are also a big hit at parties,recitals and bake sales. We LOVE them!!!!!!!!!

Very easy to make. I added chocolate chips which made them better. I didn't get as many cookies as the recipe called for.

I have made these cookies for years but I have never used baking soda! I use the same ingredients but the forth is one teaspoon of vanilla! I use a small cookie stamp and the impression stays!

I guess I just prefer a flour-based cookie. Found this one bland.

Amazingly quick and easy. I like how "light" and crunchy these cookies are. No one can believe there's no flour or butter. I will definitely make these again.

Yummy!!! A really easy but delightful cookie. But like other readers - I didn't get 70 cookies either...and I didn't eat any batter! I have already made this a few times.

I really prefer a chewy peanut butter cookie, but this is so easy to make (great for kids!) and has such great peanutty flavor, I will make it again. I didn't get 70 cookies either, more like 40-45 (including the cookie dough we had to sample!)

I thought these were wonderful - I brought them to work and they were gone in a flash! I did make them bigger than the recipe called for the second time I made them, and I thought they were even better. Everyone asks for the recipe and are atunned when they hear it's only 4 ingredients!

Easy and delicious. My 2 1/2 year old son and I had a great time making them.

The cookies are quick to make and it's a lovely recipe considering one always has these ingredients on hand.

I love this recipe. But it doesn't last long, even with the 60 cookies i got out of the one batch.

I didn't know that flourless cookies even existed! These are the best and easiest cookies I've ever made. What a great find!

I made this receipe after having read the reviews and then took them to a party. Everybody loved them and wanted the recipe. I, too, was skeptical at first but was made a believer. Never did get 70 cookies out of the recipe, though. Got 80 cookies from two batches.

I can't stop eating them! Excellent quick recipe.

Just for experimentation, after I had cross-hatched the cookies, I gently poked a few chocolate chips on top of each cookie....they were especially delicious...a flourless peanut butter AND chocolate cookie!

I am a peanut butter cookie connoisseur, always looking for the perfect cookie. This IS the best I had tried thus far and have made the recipe 5 times since appearing in your magazine! I found the cookies dense,moist,lacy and extremely full of flavor! Kudos to Mom Fritch!!

Wonderful cookies. Can't believe they don'e have any butter or flour. We share them equally! No one gets more than the other.

Quite good, and extremely simple and quick to make. I took them to the office and everyone liked them.

I made these on a day when I found that I was completely out of flour! Though I was skeptical at first, my husband and I thought the peanut flavor was excellent and liked the sandy texture. The ease of preparation and the small number of ingredients make these great last-minute cookies. I used half chunky peanut butter and half unsweetened pb (I ran out of chunky)...they came out fine this way.

When I took my first batch out of the oven, the sheet slipped from my hands and I dropped it on the oven door, knocking the cookies flat. Turned out to be the best CHEWY pb cookies I ever had!! I baked the rest normally and prefer the flat ones. This is a great recipe to do with kids!

I found these to be a very grainy cookie - like all of the sugar didn't disolve in baking. Very crumbly - not my personal favorite. My husband on the other hand really enjoyed them. Guess it is a preference thing - I like a moister p/b cookie.

The cookie you get right after you bake it, and the cookie you get the next day are two totally different cookies. People should know, if they can just wait over night, the cookie will not be this gentle thing, it will be an intense, rich, crisp, flavorful cookie. I would not make the "right after" cookie again. But I will make the "Wait overnight and they are amazing" cookie many more times.

Incredible! Everyone loved it. Noone could believe the ingredients.
