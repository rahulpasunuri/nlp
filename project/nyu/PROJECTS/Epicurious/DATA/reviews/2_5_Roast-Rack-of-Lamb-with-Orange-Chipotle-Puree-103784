I make this recipe exactly as written and it gets rave reviews. It is especially popular among the 20 or so people who get together for football tailgates -- I generally make 6 racks of lamb and there is never any left!

Made the sauce with apple-cider vinegar instead of rice. Then served with duck breasts marinated in apple-cider vinegar and about a teaspoon of chipotle. It was an interesting puree though no one is dying to have it again. The duck was excellent.

Interesting take on Rack of Lamb. The sauce was a wonderful compliment to the Lamb. Wonderful on a warm summer evening dinning on the deck with friends.

We are always looking for new recipes for rack of lamb and we would definitely make this again. We made it for an informal dinner party and everyone raved on it.

I was disappointed at the orange-chipotle puree because it was overpowered by the red peppers. Not a winner, unfortunately.
