I served this last night to a ladies group. Since I was serving 9 I doubled the recipe and made it in a larger pan. I also did all the prep and assembly the night before and then baked it after work before my guests arrived and it was perfect. I took the advice of other reviewers and used a mixture of half white mushrooms and half Shitakes. I also added 1 cup minced yellow onion to the mushrooms. In addition I steamed a bag of baby spinach for 3 minutes, then set it aside to cool and drain. When the mushroom mixture was done I also let it cool before mixing in the chicken (from a rotisserie bird at the grocery store) and the spinach that I had pressed the extra liquid from. I added 1/4 teas. nutmeg to the sauce per another reviewer and also let it cool a bit before mixing it with the mushroom chicken mix. Again on the advice of other reviewers I used regular lasagna noodles and boiled them per the package instructions and then rinsed them in cold water before using them. Assembly was easy and after I put the foil on it I put it in the refrigerator overnight. When the I removed the foil after the first 30 min of baking I realized that the top looked kind of plain so I rummaged around and found part of a package of sliced almonds in the cupboard and sprinkled about 3 tbls. on top and finished baking it another 25 min. I did turn the oven down to 400F for the last 10 minutes and took it out when it was the perfect golden brown on top. The almonds added ssome visual interest and great flavor to the finished dish. I'm sure it took longer to bake becaue I had doubled the recipe. But the best compliment I received was that three of the friends asked for copies of the recipe. I would definitely make this again for a dinner party.

Very good! For an enhanced depth of flavor...I added 2 t. of chicken bullion to the sauce. Also increased the Gruyere to 2 cups. I made it in 3 - 8x4" foil pans, baked one off and froze the other 2. Let thaw then baked as directed and it was just as good as the "fresh baked". Makes a great freezer meal for those days when you don't have the time to cook.

Four forks for versatility. Had leftover bbq'd spiced chicken breasts and thought I had lasagne noodles but didn't so used whole wheat rotini noodles. Didn't have mushrooms. Used extra garlic, leeks and spinach, chicken broth in place of wine, and skim milk. Easily increased to almost double to fill 9x13 pan. Mixed all together with cooked rotini and fresh thyme and oregano. Placed a layer of peeled and sliced sweet potatoes in between two layers of noodle mix. Skipped te gruyere. Cooked 45 mins covered then uncovered, sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top and cooked final 15 mins. Let sit 10 mins and it held up like lasagne. Delish!

Just tried this tonight. When I saw the recipe it is just my thing, cheese, creamy sauce, noodles... Boy it takes much more that 35 minutes to gather all this together and complete all the steps. Easy steps to follow but it dirties many pans. I was a bit disappointed. It needs much more salt. The creamy cheesiness just wasn't all that great. And unless you have big eaters this is more like 6-8 servings not 4. I might make this again but I would alter it a bit. The top layer of noodles got a bit hard even though covered with the sauce. It may be better the next day after sitting and melding together....we will see. Overall it is a good recipe, but the time it takes may not be worth its so-so result.

Very versatile recipe. Was looking for something to make with some almost-freezer-burned crab meat. Perfect. Substituted crab meat for chicken. Added sauteed shallots and some baby spinach. Used full quart of milk with more flour and butter. Didn't have any Gruyere, so used just parmigiana. Delicious. Great basic recipe for variations.

This recipe was disappointing. I agree with others to take the extra time to boil regular lasagna noodles. I found the no boil noodles gummy in this recipe. I added onion as others have suggested, but the recipe was very bland. Also, if you are using a pyrex dish, reduce the oven temperature - my noodles were burned on the bottom. This recipe is quite expensive and time consuming and IMO not worthy of either the expense or time.

Awesome and easy - impresses guests and family. Each time we add spinach and extra garlic to the mushroom mix. Have made with the sauce as written, with sauce using skim and using a jar of alfredo sauce for quicker weeknight version. Each variation is really good. With the spinach, the 8x8 pan is quite full. Increased quamtities by 1.5 and put together in a 9x13 with great result, too. Favorite for sure!

I make a number of different lasagne, and this one is delicious if you are looking for a fancier, and richer, take for company. As some have noted, I used more mushrooms (cremini in my case), cheese, and garlic, and have used a Costco rotisserie chicken for ease. I do like no-bake noodles, but to go all out for company I used DeCecco, which makes an extra step but gets a nice result. I am about to make this for the third time for vegetarian company and am using carmelized onions instead of chicken. I think the spinach idea would be great, too.

Absolutely delicious. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added an onion to the mix. I also pre-wet the no-boil lasagne noodles for better results. I'm normally not a big fan of mushrooms, but this bechamel based sauce does the trick. The hubby was impressed. This recipe is a new family favorite!

A total success!! It was absolutely delicious and my husband won't stop talking about it. Followed the recipe to the letter. The no-boil noodles worked like a charm with no need to presoak or boil (I'm glad I resisted the temptation to follow the suggestion of a previous reviewer in this respect because it would have meant an extra step). This being my very first attempt at making lasagna (although I am an avid and rather experienced cook I was never a fan of lasagna until now) I took care to prepare and measure out all the ingredients before starting to cook. My pile of utensils in the sink was considerable!! But I can say that it was definitely worth it. I plan to make this again often and learn to eyeball the amounts of sauce and cheeses to use for each layer when assembling the lasagna without fear of being caught short at the end and thus also saving on the cleanup:) Thank you for a great recipe!!

This is a family favorite. I have made it as directed, substituted baby bella mushrooms, and/or half and half for milk. The only thing I change on a regular basis is the amount of garlic - I like a stronger garlic flavor. A keeper!

I love this recipe, but have noticed that leftovers aren't as good as when it is first made. The lasagna noodles soak up moisture as it sits in the refrigerator and it becomes very dense and a bit dry. So eat it all when it comes out of the oven!

Absolutely Amazing Recipe!!! My whole family looks forward to nights when I make this. Even the leftovers (if there are any) from this dish are amazing. We try to find ways to include this at least bi-weekly into our menu, it's that good.

My family loved this recipe! I used ground chicken, as that was all I had on hand, and added spinach and onion to the mushrooms. I also used whole grain wheat noodles and boiled them while preparing the other ingredients. It didn't seem to add too much time or effort to the whole process, and the nutty flavor of the wheat noodles added tremendously to the flavor. It was a huge hit with my four boys. Very rich and satisfying. We will definitely add this to our list of favorites.

Tip: As seen on ATK, pre-soaking the no-boil noodles helps ensure that the noodles cook up well with a nice texture. Simply lay your noodles in the baking dish you will be using, pour hot tap water to cover, swish with your hand to make sure all the noodles are in contact with the water and not sticking together, and let stand for five minutes. Pick the noodles out of the water and lay on a clean dishtowel and pat dry. Use as many dishtowels as necessary to make single layers and finally cover the last layer with a damp dishtowel to hold until you are ready to assemble the lasagna. Discard the water in the baking dish, wipe with a paper towel, and proceed. No need to wash the baking dish. Hope this helps!

This is very rich and could easily feed 4-6 people. It was okay the first night I made it, but it didn't nuke very well the second night....noodles came out gummy. Just didn't have the wow factor.

My family loved this recipe. I have one child who does not like tomato sauce so it is fun to find a lasagna she will enjoy. I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 baking dish so we could have leftovers. I also used lowfat milk and it works just fine and saves at least some of the fat from this rich recipe.

I took this recipe to friends house for dinner and they loved it - first time making it - I loved it too - was fairly easy and I substituted Italian seasonings and cheese for the Thyme and Gruyere as I didn't have any and it was still a big hit - I will definetly make this again with the suggestions of adding onion and spinach and using Gruyere cheese - it can only get better.

I made this last night and was disappointed with the result. If i made it again I would leave the wine out or halve the quantity as it gave the dish a weird taste. I agree that it def needs the onion flavour and spinach is a good idea.

ok, but not worth the effort, especially since gruyere sells for $16 a pound. The quantity for thyme is for fresh, not dried!

Added onion and spinach as per others advice, which worked well. Also used fresh lasagne sheets and minced chicken. Quite rich - could cut down the fat and still have good flavour.

Tried this today. I read every review and upped some of the amounts of chicken and mushrooms. It came out pretty much as I had expected. Lasagne can be a bit of a mess, but taste conquers all in this dish and the combination of thyme, wine, and the cheeses was exquisite. I plan on trying it with homemade noodles next time as I wasn't thrilled with the texture of the no bake kind, although in other (much larger) lasagnas they have worked out just fine. I would give this recipe a rating of 'must try'.

Rating: 3
Very good lasagna and quite simple to put together. I bought a roast chicken and the no boil lasagne noodles (I have never found them to be a problem) and prep was a snap. The result looked just like the photo. I would probably use lower fat milk next time but wanted to follow the recipe on the first attempt. I served this with Romaine with Parmesan Vinaigrette - BA 5/2008.

I agree with the other reviewers about using no-boil noodles, it doesn't quite taste the same as the regular ones. I took others' advice about adding spinach and artichokes and it tasted really good. Next time I try this recipe I will just use farfalle bow tie pasta and make it into a pasta bake.

I loved this lasagne. I made it for company and everyone raved about it. I used 1% milk which worked fine. I'll definitely make it again.

Sorry to go off-topic a little, but I must vent about no-boil lasagna pasta. 1st: yes, there is a difference, no-boil is just not right in taste or texture. 2nd: if you are going to do the other steps required for lasagna, can't you simultaneously just pull out another pot and boil your pasta, too? 3rd: no-boil is not versatile in any way. In some lasagna variations, I like to have layers sometimes with nothing but maybe a little cheese, etc. No boil MUST be layered in contact with wet ingredients such as sauce. 4th: i like to make my lasagna free-form on baking sheets sometimes, or make single sheet lasagna "rolls." Again, impossible with the no-boil. Ideally I make fresh pasta and crank it out with my KitchenAid stand mixer-takes 15 minutes after the dough is ready. In a pinch, take the extra 11 minutes and boil the dried store-bought. Thanks, I feel better!

Very good, different twist on lasagne. I substituted 1% milk and Jarlsberg cheese, as that is what I had on hand. I never have problems with the no-boil noodles. Barilla brand seems to be the best, resulting in a homemade tasting noodle. I will definately make this again, and wouldn't hesitate to serve it to guests.

Delicious dish, enough said. I sometimes have a problem with no-boil noodles drying out so I didn't uncover it for the last 15 minutes and it was perfect. Very moist and not overpoweringly cheesy (not gooey at all). Since there are only two of us, we have leftovers, even better.

Rating: 3
I liked this lasagne but would definitely add onions to the mushroom mix next time. Also, I boiled the no-boil noodles for a minute or two-just to soften them a little, and they worked fine. I'd used them before without boiling and found that the texture was too dry & brittle. I like that they lay completely flat since they don't have ruffled edges like regular lasagna noodles.

Rating: 3
This was yummy. Will definitely make it again. I find it interesting that no one has commented on the no-boil noodles; I wasn't crazy about the texture, especially the next day. Next time I will boil regular noodles first. Other than that, wouldn't change a thing.

Loved the recipe. I substituted skim milk for the whole milk. It really didn't make any difference in the sauce, and really cut the fat. I also used plain old swiss and roasted my own chicken. It was fairly economical. I would make it again.

I need advice on this recipe as I would like to make it. I have some Gruyere cheese frozen (as it is a bit expensive). Can anyone tell me how 3 oz. (by weight) is EVER going to make 1-1/2 cups??? Also, any of you reviewers who substituted Provolone for the Gruyere--how much Provolone (by weight) did you use? Thank you.

This lasagna was great. It was much easier to make than a regular, red lasagna and everyone who tried it really loved it. I added some shitake mushrooms and used pan seared chicken instead of a roast chicken. Additionally, I used pretty cheap swiss cheese instead of spending more for the gruyere and I don't think it mattered with all the other flavors going on. Definitely try it!

This is a good recipe as is, but could stand some tune up a bit. Its one of those that with a little imagination you could take it in other directions taste wise. The Poker Guys ate it all up but they eat every thing. This really was good, just needed a little something.

A mixed variety of mushrooms works well here, though I would probably stay away from mushrooms that are too earthy, such as dried porcini. I also added a grating of fresh nutmeg as I cannot fathom a bechamel without it. Because I wanted to lighten the dish without sacrificing texture, I used fat- free evaporated milk. It thickens better than skim milk and still gives the richness you'd get from whole milk. Go a step further and use a whole-wheat white flour and whole wheat lasagna noodles for extra fiber. I like another reviewer's idea of using a pre-roasted store bought chicken to save time and with pre-sliced mushrooms it can even be a fuss-free week night dish. With or without chicken this would still be great. And because every health-nut has their favorite - I added some chopped walnuts to the cheese topping for a bit of crunch and yet another layer of flavor.

Rating: 3
This is a nice change of pace from the usual lasagna recipes. I, too, added nutmeg to the bechamel and leeks & baby spinach to the mushrooms. Loved the idea of artichoke hearts--will try that next time. Served with grape tomatoes sauteed with olive oil, garlic, parsley, thyme & basil....great side dish!

I thought this was just ho-hum... The idea of the recipe is great, it just needs some pizazz. The flavor of the gruyere is lost in the sauce.

Made this for a simple dinner with friends, everyone really liked it. I used 1% milk instead of whole, which I may not do again in the future as the sauce didn't have the true creaminess I think this dish deserves. Would like to work some more vegetables into this dish in the future. Went great with roasted broccoli and cauliflower with garlic and pine nuts.

The recipe name does not do this one justice. I was able to get a rotisserie chicken breast at the supermarket (that was huge) and only used a little more than half of it for about 2 1/2 cups of chicken. I also added a chopped leek into the mixture that I thought added a nice flavor. To cut a bit of fat I used skim milk and the sauce thickened beautifully. Next time I might try using herbes de provence instead of just thyme, I think this blend goes great with chicken and mushrooms. I did use less lasagna noodles than the recipe called for -- 2 for each layer worked perfectly -- cuts a few more calories. This could easily be a meal for company with a mesclun salad, some wine. Delicious!!!!

This was quite delicious and simple to make. I cheated as well and used a store bought rotisserie chicken.

*sigh* I really really wanted to like this. The photo was beautiful. I love gruyere - I would eat it every day if it wasn't so expensive (or if I lived in Switzerland, I suppose). I love lasagnas with bechamel. This just missed the mark for me somehow. My husband's assessment was that it was good and he liked it, but it had a "chicken and dumplings" feeling to it. For some reason while I was eating it I really wanted there to be spinach instead of chicken inside. It isn't a bad recipe. I just didn't love it. I make about 7 different kinds of lasanga, and I don't think this one is going to make it in to my lasagna rotation. I don't mean to discourage anyone from making this - I think maybe with some tinkering it could be good.

This recipe is very good and easy to make. I cheated by buying a rotisserie chicken from my supermarket. I would definitely recommend using a good quality swiss cheese/gruyere. This is a nice change from the usual tomato sauce lasagne.
