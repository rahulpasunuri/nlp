These were delicious and everyone at the dinner raved for the recipe! A perfect balance of flavors and crispiness from frying them up. I am thinking of making the next batch as squares to help with the browning as I doubled the batch and it was alot of work to brown them as the shape they were.

Absolutely delicious.

Very yummy; a logistics change suggestion, though would be to do your ragu meats in olive oil, top off the olive oil (about a cup) for the meatball portion of the ragu, then save the oil to do the polpette in about an hour before your sauce is going to come off the stove. When we did this, it was coated with all the browned bits from all the other meats which was a lovely prelude of the dinner to come. Delicioso!

Very yummy; I changed the order of the recipes with the ragu, and simply made up the polpette but didn't fry them up until AFTER all of the meats for the ragu were already in the pot and simmering. I topped off the olive oil with one cup more to do the meatballs, and then saved THAT oil to do these in. They got all encrusted with all the nice leavings of the other meats, which was a nice tantalizing invitation of what was to come! Also, that meant we could fry these up only a little while before the ragu, not 3 hours plus before! Delicioso!

This is my all time fave meatball recipe. Basic but so yummy. I've doubled, halved, fudged ingredients and it comes out great. Tasty for turkey meatballs as well!

I baked these instead of frying them, used turkey, ground beef and italian pork sausage - they were great. The kids loved them. I used a little marinara sauce that I made to pour over them. Tasty!

these were delicious. I made them bigger than it said, and we had them as part of a multi-dish buffet. Used ground turkey as I don't eat veal. Really good.

Perfect. They will take more than 2 minutes to be cooked through, though.

I'm not sure my review counts as I didn't have any ground veal :( I was impressed with the taste just the same though. I loosely followed the recipe with not measuring the ingredients. I also opted just to use buttermilk bread crumbs as I didn't have any sourdough bread around.

These were an institution when I was growing up. My mother, from Toscana, always added a little chopped mortadella!
