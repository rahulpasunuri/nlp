I added thinly sliced fresh mushrooms, had no chicken broth, nor fresh ginger...but the dish came out wonderful. Will prepare again!

I don't know if I did something wrong but I thought this was terrible. The eggplant was mushy and oily and there was no discernable flavor.

Based on previous complaints that it was too oily, I cooked the eggplant in chicken broth instead of oil. Rave reviews from everyone in the house.

We are finishing our last bite and thoroughly enjoyed it, complimented by grilled salmon (seasoned with garlic infused olive oil, coarse Hawaiian salt and coarsely ground black pepper) and simple brown rice. We love garlic, pepper, and cilantro, and found these to compliment the eggplant very nicely. Oh, and a special glass of homemade Cabernet Sauvignon from a dear friend made this a feast!

YUCK! I tried this recipe despite the other reviews and sadly have to concur... it's just oily and garlicky. Not worth it at all.

We loved this recipe. I added chicken since I had a hankering for chicken and eggplant, and loving cilantro and chili too, this was perfect. My Chinese husband also heartily approved.

I had to add more oil to saute the eggplant in and decided to use olive oil along with the peanut when I added more.

This dish looked terrible! Cooking the cilantro turned the beautiful green to a dirty brown. The eggplant was also dark brown. The entire dish was overwelmed by garlic and very oily. Yuck!

This dish an absolute must if you are a vegetarian and or just want a delicious, quick, and flavorful meal. I cut my eggplant in thinner slivers to cook faster and instead of 2 batches, I just made one batch. Careful about adding too much ginger. This would go great with some brown or basmati rice.

I liked this! I used some really great skinny pale purple eggplants from the farmer's market. They became tender very quickly and were naturally sweet. Yes, it's true that the dish is not visually appealing, but I anticipated that when I read the recipe. The eggplant is cooked, so it doesn't retain its color, and the cilantro is dark green against the dark eggplant. But since I find most eggplant dishes visually unappealing, that didn't bother me! It was a tasty dish with a very nice aroma! I'm making it again this week!

Ugh, this was a disappointment in so many ways. The flavor was nothing special - which can usually be remedied in some way. However, it was so visually unappealing that the longer I looked at it, the less I could imagine any of it on my plate. There must be better recipes out there for asian flavored eggplant.

This recipe is great. Make sure to have some bread handy as you'll want to sop up the every drop of sauce.

This is an excellent recipe. I often eat spicy eggplant at resturants and could never find a recipe that tasted as good but this one does. The second time I made this I added some chili garlic sauce and a tablespoon of brown sugar.

I made it with Japanese eggplant. I didn't have broth, so I made the sauce without it. It was still quite delicious. The guests loved it on baguette.

We loved this dish as part of a Southeast Asian meal but it would work with Indian food or grilled red meat just as well. You can adjust the 'heat' by changing the amount of fresh green chiles
