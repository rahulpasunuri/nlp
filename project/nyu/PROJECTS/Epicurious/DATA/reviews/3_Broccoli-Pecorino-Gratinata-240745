Delicious and easy, this dish didn't last long. Highly recommended.

I made this recipe with less butter because I was feeling fat, and I think that veggies can be overwhelmed by too much fat. I agree that this is a decent weeknight side. I would suggest more than 20 minutes cooking time, though.

I made it with the entire menu for a book group ("Eat, Pray, Love" by Elizabeth Gilbert) and found it to be lovely. I put in in a shallow dish, drizzled olive oil over, as well as the butter, was generous with the cheese and pepper flakes and cooked it longer so it was just a touch crisp at the edges. I did blanch the florets, but only for a short time to bring out the color, so I had no issue with mushiness. It was the first dish to disappear, and my book group is not known to be vegetarians in the least!

Easy to prepare, very tasty and a good way to get kids to eat broccoli. Probably not a dish to serve to company.

Easy to prepare, attractive, and delicious. I used coarsely grated cheese and lots of it!

I have not made this recipe, but I have made many different kinds of roasted broccoli. I usually just toss the broccoli in olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper and roast for 20-25 minutes at high heat. I don't think that the broccoli needs to be blanched first; that is probaly why yours came out mushy.

I was looking for a vegie recipe for company but this is definitely not it. I'm glad I tried it for my husband & I first. I found the broccoli was way too overcooked (mushy). Yes, I could have cooked it less next time but, overall, it's just not very impressive. Good family weekday side but that's it.
