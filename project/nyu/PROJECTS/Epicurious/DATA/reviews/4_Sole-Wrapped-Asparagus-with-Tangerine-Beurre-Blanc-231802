It looked beautiful on the plate, no adjustments, but so blah bland. It took more than 20 minutes to cook through as well. Would not make it again, especially with the sauce.

This looks amazing. I am totally into flavored beurre blancs these days, especially orange or other citrus. The latest attempt will be this recipe i just found on Neurotic Kitchen dotcom for an orange ginger beurre blanc over scallops!

Great recipe. I also needed to substitute fresh orange peel and juice because tangerines were not available. Next time less butter, more herbs. A nice change of pace.

This is a great recipe. Good flavors and the presentation is stunning! It is such an easy recipe that goes together quickly. I followed the recipe with the exception of replacing some of the water with 1/4 C white wine. also I brushed the roasting pan and fish with Pasolivo tangerine olive oil instead of melted butter. Used Baja Pacific Halibut which is a mild, sweet white fish. The aspargus were med-size, didn't peel the stalks and they were a perfect crisp-tenderness. This is definitely a great, easy meal for family and for company. It's a keeper.

Loved this dish: delicious, elegant and easy! Who knew those three could coexist in one recipe ;) Like other reviewers I cut the butter in half and it wasn't noticeable at all. I also added half white wine and half water which made the fish that much more tasty. I served it with some wild rice, which made for a light and elegant dinner. Next time I think I'll try some herbs in the sauce. Overall, highly recommended.

Correction: make that "water" not "eater". :)

Truly exceptional! I used clementines because that's what I had on hand. For the two of us, 3/4 lb. sole fillets worked beautifully with 1 bunch of asparagus. Like some others, I substituted dry white wine (Pinot Grigio) for half the eater, which was a very good call. I also sprinkled a little Herbs de Provence over the fish before baking. Only needed about half the amount of butter for the sauce, and lime in place of lemon in the sauce was also just fine. Did not blanch the asparagus, but peeling was good since these were not super thin. Served it with tri-color couscous with currants. Absolutely delicious!

I really liked this - threw in my drinking white for 1/2 the water, loved the extra winey tang and only had half a stick of butter in the fridge which was just fine for the entire recipe. It needed something - an herb? tarragon? - to be complete for me, altho just saw the caviar garnish idea and that felt right too. Served this with lemon risotto cakes, which was very good. Keeper, especially in asparagus season!

I LOVED this meal!! Since I didn't have a tangerine around the house, I used a navel orange for the juice and zest instead. I also added some fresh rosemary to the melted butter used to set the roasting pan and fish prior to cooking as I love the flavor and aroma rosemary adds. I also added some fresh sage to the Beurre Blanc sauce and served the whole delicious bundle over some italian orzo and it was a big hit! This one is definitely going into the arsenal for a relatively easy dish that tastes SO yummy and looks really sophisticated and elegant. My dinner guests are still raving about it; yours will too!!!

YUM! The finished dish is so amazing -- looking and tasting-- that it's scandalous how easy it is.

Rating: 4
Wow! This could be the best fish dish I've ever made. I substituted an orange and went with another reviewer's suggestion to use only 2 Tbs butter which was plenty for my arteries. Also parboiled the asparagus that happened to be rather fat stalks instead of skinny ones. It was not difficult at all to make and sure to impress dinner guests.

Rating: 4
Delicious (although anything with beurre blanc is delicious in my book.) I subbed halibut for the sole and minneolas for the tangerines. I think the sauce would have been too sweet with tangerines, so I was glad I made the change. I also blanched the asparagus beforehand for a minute, assembled ahead, and baked the whole thing out of the fridge which worked beautifully. I'm always on the lookout for elegant dishes to serve dinner guests, and this would be a good one.

Rating: 4
Delicious and worth the extra calories. I did not peel the asparagus (healthier, more fiber). I blanch asparagus in boiling water for 2 minutes (medium to large spears), transfered to ice water, and let dry on towel. This cooked the asparagus about 90%. Wrapped fish around the asparagus. Did not tightly foil and bake the fish - just cooked it uncovered and took out immediately when the fish turned opaque and began to flake. Also, substitute water for chicken stock and did not add any salt to the recipe.

Rating: 4
this was delish, a little indulgent with the butter but worth it. I topped each bundle with about a 1/4 t. black cavier for some added "elegance" just before serving, which was a nice contrast to the white fish and orange sauce.

Rating: 4
this was unexpectedly fantastic! - Also made some adjustments - used Basa, like someone else did, omitted the lemon (as the orange from my tree was exeptionally sour) and added a splash of heavy cream - remember to whisk when adding this.

Rating: 4
Exceptional! I had to make a few adjustments based on what was available. Used dover sole - fillets are small, so next time would wrap with 2 fillets. The grocery store was out of tangerines so followed the advice of another reviewer and used a combination orange, lemon, lime and grapefruit. Also, peeled and blanched the asparagus for 30 seconds.

Rating: 4
This is fast, gorgeous, and delicious. I used fresh squeezed orange juice, chicken stock for water, and only 3 tablespoons of butter in the sauce, and the results were incredible. I'll try just 2 tablespoons butter in the sauce next time. The recipe should read "Salt, to taste" for the sauce, as the amount of salt picked up from the pan juices will vary.

Rating: 3
Prepared according to recipe, except used salted butter (all I had on hand), definitely needs the unsalted-end result was a bit salty...I think I would use a mix of citrus next time too, I used honey tangerines and the sauce was good, but bordered on tasting orange-juicy. But, overall, delicious and would make it again for sure!

Excellent recipe! I went to purchase sole, but only Basa, a fish I had never tried, was available. It is thicker than sole, but similar in taste. My daughter hates all vegetables, and stated she wouldn't eat the fish if Asparagus was even in the same pan...so I cooked the asparagus seperately. The sauce was what made the dish. I didn't use an entire cube of butter, and it was still wonderful.

Rating: 4
Used the ingredients exactly as written. Per suggestion, I blanched the peeled asparagus for a minute; I would try 30 seconds next time then into an ice water bath. I prepared everything in advance then just before baking added water to the fish and water to the oven saffron rice and prepared the sauce while the other two were baking (also had prepared the sauce in advance up to the point of adding butter). Also, put sole fillets in a milk bath for an hour to reduce fishiness and rinsed before putting together. The presentation is wonderful and the sauce is sublime! Saffron rice complemented it nicely. Next time I'd add a couple of tablespoons of softened sauteed shallots to the rice and throw some edible flowers on the plate to mitigate all the orange. Two larger tangerines were enough for this recipe and I would definitely recommend tangerines over oranges - they really make the sauce. My new favorite beurre blanc. A keeper!

This is a wonderful presentation. Nice rendition of a classic beurre blanc (which is a BUTTER sauce, people, try to make it low fat and it is no longer that!) Blance the asparagus if they are not pencil thin

To the cook from Tempe: The old trick for cutting fat from pastry cream (creme anglaise) is to use milk and corn starch instead of cream. Maybe corn starch would work here too?

I made this dish for Easter lunch. It was delicious, everyone loved it! I did make the mistake of using salted butter instead of unsalted. When I tasted the sauce it was salty and buttery and didn't have a citrus taste so I added orange juice until it tasted better and continued cooking it until it was back to the thicker sauce consistency. The fish and asparagus were cooked perfectly and the sauce complimented the dish perfectly once I had fixed it. Does anyone know how to make the sauce with less butter? I know that is a main ingredient but it would be nice to cut down on some of the fat in the sauce.

Wow! I took my first bite of this and thought "Is it possible that I actually made this?" It was incredible--firm but yielding fish, tender asparagus, and a soft, tangy sauce. It melted in the mouth. The fish counter was out of sole, so I used basa (a wonderful white fish I'd never had before). I served it with a side of sweet potato and spinach puree with sage. I will make this as often as possible.

Fab!

I made this recipe last year for Passover and it was a huge hit. I served it as an appetizer. The sauce is absolutely delicious. Don't skip adding the pan juices, because that is what makes the flavor really come together. The bright orange sauce makes for great presentation.

Easy, elegant any-night entree. I had the grey sole, but not the tangerines and the asparagus- so subbed with oranges & haricot vertes. Served with pureed sweet potatoes & a green salad. I have spent hours on meals that never got the raves that this dish did. A keeper.

I'm afraid I kind of screwed this up...didn't feel like running out so I used orange zest and juice and some lemon zest too. When I put the fish in the baking dish I put in some Imagine organic vegetable broth instead of water. Water sounded kind of boring. Then I discovered I was out of cayenne and threw some crushed red pepper flakes into the sauce. I don't know why the recipe suggests you should 'peel' the asparagus spears; I know you have to do that with white asparagus. Anyway I didn't bother. When I discovered I had to reduce the pan juices and add it to the beurre blanc I was a little worried about the vegetable broth thing, but it turned out absolutely de-lish! Family was SO impressed! You can get away with some improvisations with this dish. Despite my bumbling-chef version of it, I can tell the recipe would be marvellous as it is written!

I have made this dish with talapia and sole. It is delcious! I find the sauce needs a little more butter and a bit if cornstarch to thicken nicely. Fast, easy, fancy presentation and a family meal pleaser.

What a great dish! I used orange instead of tangerine. From my tree. More Shallots than the recipe called for. I over cooked the fish a bit, so it split. I served it on individual plates (rather than a serving platter), so I just turned the pieces over when I put them on the plate, and they looked great. Even cooked, it was delicious. I'll fix this one many times in the future.

I made this pretty much as is except for the sauce, and used sole, but still came out pretty good. For sauce I used fresh OJ, no shallots, 1/2 the butter, and didn't add reduced pan juices. This is a good dish that I would make again and serve for company as the presentation is nice. I had extra asparagus so I baked them with oil and salt in the oven while fish was cooking. Served bulgur on the side as well.

This sauce uses a variation on Sunstet's venerable Citrus Beurre Blanc, and proves that new is not always improved. All tangerine juice lacks the zip of the lemon-lime-orange-grapefruit combo of the original. It would get an extra fork at least if it was made with the Sunset one, maybe with tangerine juice replacing the orange.
