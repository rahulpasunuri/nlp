Sounded interesting, but ended up just kinda tasting sour. It's not terrible, but there's a reason we use butter in mashed potatoes.

When I decided to make this last night, I did not realize I was low on yogurt. So I had to sub about half two percent milk for half of the low-fat yogurt. Used the larger amount of curry powder, and scrubbed, not peeled, the potatoes (for added vitamins). They were delicious, and I can only imagine how tangy they would be if I had used ALL the required yogurt!!! What I really like about this recipe is that using the microwave is a cooler way to make mashed potatoes in the upcoming hot summertime...will definitely make these again. Thank you.

I added a bit of garlic, horseradish, a touch of mustard and cayenne pepper too - to give it an extra kick. Yummy!

A touch of garlic would add an interesting twist
