Just made these and wish I would have read the reviews before I had done so. Too much butter. I ended up with flat and crisp oatmeal slabs. For the last two pans I added the last of my oats and walnuts to try to thicken the batter up and it was slightly better but still disappointing. I also would omit the nutmeg next time.

I made these for a summer picnic. I used 1.5 sticks of butter and 2 eggs, and found it needed about 2.5+ cups of oatmeal. I also did not add the nutmeg, and used about 0.5 t cinn and 1 t dried ground ginger. I would have used fresh grated ginger if I had it in the house. They are perfect for a versatile oatmeal cookie, but try to reduce the butter.

absolutely the best oatmeal cookie I have ever tasted. this cookie begs for a gallon of cold milk.

No coconut on hand, we used a bag of butterscotch chips instead. YUM. I'm surprised at all the reviews saying this recipe made crisp thin cookies, maybe it's the butterscotch chip addition but my cookies are moist and chewy. I made them as the recipe called for, save for the whole chip vs. coconut thing, and baked for 10 minutes. Everyone loves them!

oh my goodness! these are so yummy! i made these on friday and they are already almost gone! i do agree that they could be made smaller. after the first batch i didn't flatten them and just did a small rounded spoonful. i also think they could bake more like 9-10 minutes, but i like my cookies chewy. and i would also try with a little less butter next time. but.... so good!!! definitely a staple!

I liked these, but IMO they are too buttery and sweet. I added chocolate chips to part of the dough and raisins/walnuts to another part for a bit of variety, as the recipe makes far more than 45 cookies. Perhaps I'll try using unsweetened coconut (or less sugar), and less butter next time.

Ok. Just to add a note, my daughter ate the entire container. She grabbed some on the way out to school every day this week. I had added some wheat germ, so all in all it wasn't terrible for a nonbreakfast eating kids breakfast. Making another batch right now.

These are a keeper! Crispy and light. I don't know if my husband and kids will like them as much as I do because they prefer chewy cookies. For those of us who love crispy and light, these are great! I followed the recipe exactly except for chilling the cookies for a while before baking and using only 2 sticks of butter. They held their shape perfectly. Only problem I had was that they browned a little quicker on the bottoms than on top. But they taste fantastic anyway.

These are great. I substituted SPELT flour and Splenda, cut the butter by half, added an egg and some protein powder. Made with Bittersweet chocolate chips and walnuts - YUM...a super healthy version of these great cookies.

Yum ... YUM! This was easy, and I took the advice of other reviewers and only used 2 sticks of butter. After hearing about the 'pancake' effect I added more oatmeal and didn't pat the dough down on the cookie sheet before baking. Turned out great. Nutmeg makes for a nice holiday scent, but these are great anytime--and the ingredients are everyday.

I just made these exactly as is and they were perfect.. exactly the type of cookie I wanted.

This is a good base recipe - the crispy, chewy texture is great - but I simply added chocolate chips, and found them boring. Also, the nutmeg was very overpowering. I would reduce the nutmeg, and make sure add ins provide some flavor contrast - either dark chocolate, or dried fruits. Fruit I think would be ideal.

A PS to my review -- I kept the dough in the fridge until ready to bake and I made smaller cookies, more like 1/2 Tbles, as it is Christmas time and most people like to enjoy a few cookies of different varieties. They came out about 1 1/2 inches, thinnish but not brittle.

These cookies are fantastic. I cut the butter down to 2 sticks, as recommended by many. I lowered the temp to 350 and baked them for about 10 minutes.It does seem like these could support a variety of additions. I may try chopped dates. . .

I am 12 years old and I love to bake! These cookies were absoulutely scrumpsush ... no doubt about it. I have made these at least 5 times and have received numerous compliments from my family, neighbors, and friends ... even my mom who, believe me, does not have a sweet tooth cannot eat just one. My dad loves these cookies when they are fresh out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe! But I do tweak it a little... I decrease the oatmeal and the coconut a bit and replace them with nuts and dried cranberries or cherries! The dried friut just adds to the chewy-ness of these cookies and the nuts add to the flavor. I have used walnuts, pecans and macadamia nuts. Everybody I give these away too loves them as well. I send them to my son at college and know he's at least getting something good in his diet! :-)

We loved the light and round cookies I made with the help of this recipe. All the ingredients remained the same except: 2 sticks of butter, a little less than 1 cup brown sugar, 2 large eggs, 2 1/4 cups Quaker Oats, 1 cup raisins and 1 cup unsweetened coconut. They were delicious! I may add additional cinnamon or nutmeg next time.

these are a HUGE hit with my family who are all chocolate chip cookie lovers. I DID add raisins and left out the coconut. these are requested all the time now. Not only would I make this recipe again. I've already made it 5 times.

I made these cutting the butter down to two sticks and they turned out great, there was still plenty of butter flavor. They will still spread however if you don't chill the dough between batches (but really, having to eat a really good thin cookie instead of a really good thick cookie is not exactly a hardship).

Excellent recipe. Incredibly delicious, crisp cookies.

These cookies have great flavor. I used one less tablespoon of butter since other reviewers recommended decreasing it. They were perfectly buttery and next time I'll probably reduce it by one more. I followed all other measurements exactly. But, one thing I did wrong which I think really makes a difference here is that I made them too big. I interpreted "rounded" tablespoon to mean "heaping" tablespoon and that was too much. They were about 6 bites each - because they spread so much. I made them for a work meeting and they're just too big of a "commitment" with the other cookies and snacks we're having. Also, while my cookies were thin and wide, they were like big chewy pancake-cookies, not crispy, and I prefer crispy. My advice is to use more of a level tablespoon measure. They also left kind of a greasy sheen on my fingers. The size may have contributed to the chewy/greasy effect. Also, the ones with more brown around the edges and on the bottom tasted a bit better than the ones with less brown. I will definitely make these again - much smaller and a little more brown. But for this pancake-like batch, I will turn them into big ice cream sandwiches by filling them with vanilla frozen yogurt and freezing them for a later date! (When life gives you bad cookies, make ice cream sandwiches!)

OK, this is a truly adaptable recipe. I made it as written the first time. Second time I added 1/2 very ripe banana, white choc. chips and chopped pecans. I also reduced the butter to 2 sticks. They were awesome and no problem with them spreading. The banana added a nice flavor with the coconut.

I took the advice of some other reviewers and I used 2 sticks of butter and eliminated the coconut and nutmeg (not a fan of either) but used chocolate chips, chopped apricots and craisins instead. I also put the batter in the fridge in between batches which was helpful and baked them for 12 minutes. The final result turned out terrific and I would make them again any time!

I don't understand why everyone left out the coconut?? There are tons of recipes for oatmeal raisin cookies. This recipe is fabulous as written. I made no substitutions and my cookies were perfect. crispy and brown with amazing flavor. I gave some to my friends and they LOVED these cookies. I've had 2 requests for the recipe. As far as I'm concerned this is going to fit into my small box of cookie staples.

I made these for my grandmother and they were great! I too left out the sweetened flaked coconut then I added cinnamon chips but kept the amount of butter in the recipe the same. The cookies were perfectly thin and crisp!

Hard to review with so many modifications... I took the other reviewers' advice and cut the amount of butter (tried 2 sticks plus 1 TBSP.)I also did 3/4 tsp salt. Used raisins instead of coconut. Same complaint as others- they were too flat, so maybe even less butter is needed. I even refrigerated the dough inbetween batches. Overall flavor is pretty good, though.

Rating: 3
I've always been looking for a less dense, crisp oatmeal cookie and these were it! They came out very light and crisp! Many oatmeal cookies usually become soft the next day, but these stayed crisp. I omitted the coconut, and folded in raisins at the end, then refrigerated them for about an hour and placed them on the cookie sheets and flattened them. They looked perfect. I would however, cut the salt in half next time and lower the temp to 350 at 8-9 minutes. I have a gas oven and the cookies burned at the 8 minute mark at 375.

If you love thin and crispy oatmeal cookies, these are perfect! These are not 'classic' chewy, soft oatmeal cookies. I personally don't like my cookies chewy, so these were wonderful. I used all the butter the recipe called for, and they spread to large golden brown cookies, almost like lace cookies. SO GOOD! I did not add the coconut. These cookies would be amazing crumbled over vanilla ice cream or yogurt as well! Will bake again and again!

I also used only 2 sticks of butter (thanks to the other reviews) and I put the dough in the fridge in between batches so it wouldn't get too warm. The cookies turned out great and are a new favorite of mine.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, and I think they are the best of my Christmas cookies this year. I did make them smaller, though, and since my dough was chilled, I didn't have the spread problem other reviewers had. They are thin and melt-in-your-mouth crispy--absolutely delicious! They'll be on my cookie list every year from now on!

Another vote YES for this recipe! They are very similar to Anzac biscuits. I was just looking to use up the rest of my coconut, but I would buy it for these cookies. Thanks for the tip, I just used 2 sticks butter and they were plenty. Got 34 2.5-inch cookies, wouldn't want them any thinner.

Rating: 3
This is actually my second time to reveiw the recipe. Ordinarily I wouldn't, but having made the cookies again, this time trying some of the suggested changes, I thought I'd weigh in. I too tried reducing the butter to 2 sticks and this solved the spreading problem completley. If you're trying this recipe for hte first time reduce the butter unless you just really like thin, lacy cookies. While the flavor is marvelous, I like a chewier cookie, so next time I might see if perfection lies somewhere between the recommended 2-2/12 sticks of butter. Also, to the reviewer in NYC who halfed the recipe and yielded 30 cookies, I don't know how this was possible. A full recipe turned out 33, 2 1/2" cookies.

I followed other cooks' suggestions to reduce butter to 2 sticks and to make smaller cookies (about 1.5"). Also substituted currents for the coconut and flattened with the back of a hot wet fork for a crisper cookie and didn't flatten for a slightly thicker, chewier cookie. Cookies came out moist, crunchy and chewy - a good combination!

I reluctanly made these cookies since some reviews were not so great. I made them anyway because I happened to have the ingredients in the cupboard. Yes, they do spread quite a bit. It's a challenge to get them from the sheet to the cooling rack, however once you do...they are delicious! I followed the recipe but added golden raisins. I found that spreading is reduced if you refrigerate dough before baking. Also, I made sure they were not at all flattened or squished before going into the oven. I must say, they are worth the effort because they got rave reviews! Try them - they great!

I just read the review right before me - and I too added raisins and chopped pecans w/out the coconut. I have also added some white chocolate chips and that turned out nice too. I also don't flatten the cookie before I bake. Everyone loves them, so it's a keeper. (My husband was actually bummed that I baked a different recipe the other day - he wanted Andy's oatmeal cookies!)

When we take our beloved Persian cat in for grooming or boarding at the Vet's the girls there get treated to home made cookies. Andy's cookies got rave reviews from all of us. I didn't have any coconut in the house so used a cup of raisins and a cup of chopped pecans. With wonderful cookies like these they keep looking forward to Henry's visits.

These cookies have an excellent taste and the perfect amount of salt. I only put in 1 1/4c. oatmeal - the mixture would have been too dry with any more, and added some raisins - my Dad won't consider eating them without his rasins! I found the cookies turned out best if I didnt flatten them - the first batch were too thin and broke very easily. A definite keeper...for years to come.

This cookie recipe works with any add-ins. I did raisins sans coconut, raisins with coconut, chocolate chips sans coconut,orange peel and cranberries--all great. I used a heaping tsp of cinnamon, which makes the cookie a little darker and more nutritious looking. This is the best cookie I've made in a while. Thanks, Andy!

Substituted the coconut for raisins - made a great traditional Oatmeal Raisin cookie. Great consistency - stays soft and chewy inside with a slight crunch on the outside. They also brown perfectly and look great. Half a recipe made thirty cookies for me - I think a small tablespoon flattened to about 1.5 inches in diameter makes a good size, otherwise they come out huge. Recommended!

These are by far the best oatmeal cookies I have ever eaten. I have made them 3 times in 2 weeks! I have never used the nutmeg and have also added a small amount of chocolate chips once, as well as some nuts and dried cherries another time- delicious always. One thing: I do like the texture better when I used margerine vs. butter in this recipe- it makes the cookie a little thinner and chewier- which I happen to prefer.

Rating: 3
I used 1 3/4 c. of butter (instead of the 2 c. called for). I also baked it for 8-9 minutes instead of 12. The cookies turned out pretty good. They were crispy on the outside and slightly chewy on the inside. Still, it wasn't the thick, chewy cookie I was looking for. Anyone out there have any suggestions?

Rating: 4
Absolutely sweet and crisp on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside. One of the best oatmeal cookie recipes I have made. Few changes: Omitted nutmeg b/c I didn't have any and decreased the butter by half. Decreasing the butter did not affect flavor or texture at all. Will use this one as my oatmeal cookie blueprint from now on.

Another winner. I panicked, realizing that Thanksgiving is only two weeks away. I pulled out this recipe to get my holiday baking under way. They are fabulous. I too added about a cup of raisins and a cup of chopped walnuts. These are like little trailmix cookies.

All the recipes were easy but my friends are still trying to convince me to go into the catering business. Try these cookies...you won't be sorry.

yum. maybe my new fave for oatmeal cookies. I took the advice of those here and added about a cup or so of raisins and about 6 or 7 oz. of white choc. chips. I reduced the sweetened coconut to a little less than a cup and was glad I did because the raisins and the chocolate added lots of sweetness. I also made the cookies in big heaping spoonfuls --2 or 3 tablespoons-- so they'd be nice and large.
