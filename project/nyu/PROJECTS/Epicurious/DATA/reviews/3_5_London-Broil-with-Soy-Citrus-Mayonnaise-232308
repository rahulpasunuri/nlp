The steak was fine but anything to write home about. The mayo was disgusting. I felt like retching after tasting it on the steak. Probably would not make again but if I did, I would leave off the mayo.

Marinated the meat over night and it was extremely flavorful. I added twice as much marinade to the mayo and to me it still tasted like mayo, however, everyone else seemed to really enjoy it and asked for sweet potato fries to go with the mayo next time.

My family just adored this recipe when first I made it, and continues to do so 20 times later. I've served it to guests and get the same reviews. I agree with others that at least twice the amount of marinade reccomended should be added to the soy citrus mayo. It is very important to use good mayo and soy sauce, and I wouldn't dream of using anything other than a good red wine in this recipe.

Not as much flavor as I would have expected. The soy citrus mayo was disappointing....tasted pretty much like mayo.

This was inhaled. I checked the meat 7 minutes or so after flipping, and it was perfect. It could have even been pulled a minute before that. Definitely don't wait 10 minutes to check it.

I only give this 2 stars because while it is good for London Broil, it is not the best piece of meat I have ever had. Don't get me wrong, it is good (which is what 2 stars is). I would also make it again. I just would not have this as the main dish at a meal with guests.

I marinated it overnight. It was fantastic! The sauce really made it. I forgot the cayenne, so added it about a half an hour before cooking. I put at least a couple pinches on the steak and another in the sauce - it wasn't too spicy, just right.

Really good - a variation on our usual marinade and the soy citrus mayonnaise sauce was really good. Great with leftovers for steak sandwiches the next day too.

Wasn't blown away by this dish. It did make the normally unedible cut of cheaper meat taste pretty good and fairly tender.

Different and delicious recipe. London broil can be a tough cut of meat. Marinate for at least the minimum 4 hours or all day if possible. Cut thinly against the grain for tender eating. Serve rare to med. rare for best results. The sauce is sensational. Great with mashers and over your steamed veggies. Must have some hearty bread for slurping up all the sauce. I think minced garlic would be better for the sauce and I kicked it up by adding a bit more cayenne and I'm not a spicy girl.I wonder if you could freeze the sauce b/c I think this sauce would be great with grilled ribeyes and roasted vegies.

I have made this SO many times and each time I get compliments! It's easy and simple with impressive results. I don't think you need as much mayo as the recipe calls for and I've been known to skip the red wine and just add balsamic vinegar if I don't have red wine in the house. Don't overcook!

London broil is usually not that exciting... This recipe makes it so. The sauce is fantastic!

Rating: 4
This is the second time for me to review this dish. It is truly one of my favorites and my dinner guests rave over it when I serve it. The sauce is to die for and can be used for dipping vegetables (especially blanched asparagus) so be sure to save the marinade to mix with the mayo for other uses. I always get a good piece of london broil and I grill it. It's just scrumptious!

Rating: 3
Most london broil recipes call for grilling, and living in the city without a grill, this was a great option. I followed the cooking advice exactly (but used my own marinade), and it came out well, though slightly overdone for my taste. Overall, a good procedure, but watch the internal temperature closely and start checking before the recommended time is up.

I made it for a dinner party and it was a big hit. I used only 1/2 cup of Kikkoman lite soy sauce and that provided plenty of soy flavor. Also, lacking scallions, I pureed half a Vidalia onion and added a few more garlic cloves. Then I marinated for a full 48 hours and grilled the meat over hardwood charcoal for about 12 minutes total. Perfectly medium-rare with some medium slices on the thinner parts. Thin slices make a huge difference as the London Broil can get a bit chewy if it's sliced too thick. For the mayo, I added about 10-12 tablespoons of the reduced marinade and placed it in the freezer while the meat sat on the cutting board. Leftover beef makes a great sandwich too! I will definitely make this one again but will probably further experimentation by adding some chili peppers to the marinade. I think a little spiciness would contrast well with the cool creaminess of the mayo and all the extra garlic didn't seem to kick it up enough for my taste.

My husband really loved this, but I thought the steak was a little on the tough side. The marinade was very tasty even though I made some changes because I didn't have all the ingredients. I used all orange juice, no lemon, and liquid aminos in place of the soy. I used 1/4 cup red wine and 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar. I used finely chopped onion in place of the scallions. I also didn't strain out the marinade and used much more than the recipe calls for. Great flavor. I served with steamed spinach, honey & orange roasted carrots, and curry-cumin popovers from this site. Is this just a tough cut of steak or is it something I did when cooking that made it tough? I don't make steak very often. I would appreciate any tips. Thanks.

I love this recipe. I make it for everyone that visits because it is easy and tastes great. I love to grill it too. I always add more marinade to the mayo. This is a crowd pleaser!

Since the London broil (top round) steaks around here are SO tough, I marinated the steak for 5 days. While the meat came up to room temp., I boiled ALL the marinate for 10 minutes, and used about 1/2 of it in the mayonnaise. BBQ grilled it, served it with a green salad and "Baked Zesty Fries (c/o campbellskitchen.com), and it was a delicious meal. The steak was especially tasty. Will use this marinate and mayo many times!!!

I agree with all the positive reviews.Everybody loved the recipe. It was great to have this recipe and I did not have to grill the London Broil,since we had 12 inches of snow outside. The sauce is great and can be used for other meats.

I was very disappointed with this recipe; it was very salty and otherwise not flavorful. I used high-quality organic temari (soy sauce) from Whole Foods, a good cut of London Broil, and followed the directions carefully. I marinated the meat overnight and I did add a bit more of the marinade to the mayonaise as others suggested. Although I'm a salt-lover, this was too much for me. I cooked the meat to medium rare, sliced it against the grain, and served it with the mayo drizzled over mixed greens and a side of mashed potatoes. It was barely edible...for anyone. Definitely not a fan.

Rating: 4
I make this a couple of times a month becasue everyone raves about my cooking! It's totally fabulous EVERYTIME! You can easily substitute balsalmic vinegar for the red wine if you don't have any handy. It makes a lot of sauce and is WONDERFUL the night of, but I reccomend consuming it entirely the night you make it, not as good for leftovers. Excellent overall!

Rating: 4
This dish was AMAZING. My husband and 3 year old loved it too which is always a plus! The marinade is so good. I used Best Food Light mayo, maybe that was the problem with the mayo because none of us liked the mayo. I had reserved all of the sauce like another reviewer suggested and ended up simmering the meat in the marinade and also serving it on the side. This is good with any type of meat I think, we will be using it often! fyi, I used kikkoman low soy and cut the oil down to 1tbs in the marinade and 1tbs in the pan and it was great!

Rating: 4
This recipe is so great I have made it twice in one week - slightly different the second time and wasn't as pleased. I never really put much stock in brand names, but I definitely have to say the Kikkoman soy sauce is the way to go. The no name variety didn't offer much flavor, but loaded the marinade with salt. In addition, I found that the favor of regualar mayo over powered the marinade flavor in the sauce. I tried it with cannola oil mayo and found the flavor to be much richer.

Let's just say that the soy citrus mayo deserves a recipe page to itself! It's absolutely delicious and can be used with just about anything. It's good on broccoli, chicken tenders, sandwiches, and I would even say by the spoonful except I'd embarrass myself. };-D The London Broil turned out pink and juicy and was a big hit. Be careful when browning the first side by not getting the pan too hot. And when I cooked it on the second side, I added some of the marinade to cook with it. As the reciped suggests, be sure to save the marinade. That way you can make more of the SOY CITRUS MAYO!!!

Rating: 4
I've made this three times already - twice on the grill and once on the stove. It's really amazing and the marinade leave the meat so tender. I thought the mayo side sounded a bit ... unsavory, but it's delicious. My husband refers to it as "beef mayo" and loves it! Guests think I've slaved over the stove and I'm a genius whenever I make it, too, which is always nice.

Rating: 4
Oh man, is this good! Marinated for two days (using regular soy sauce) and cooked in cast iron skillet; turned out tender and pink. Citrus sauce was a hit with my husband who doesn't believe anything should come between him and his meat. Made extra and using on roast beef sandwiches. Yummy recipe!

Lovely, just lovely....I made this for a party of 5 and everyone (whose tastes vary from gourmand to "picky") raved. I think the mayo needs more of the marinade, and I used Kikkoman, which many consider to be one of the world's finest soy sauces. Delish!!

Delicious! I used flank steak since we have found London Broil to be unpleasantly "dense and chewy". This was a simple recipe that was a family pleaser.

I used flank steak because that's what I had. Our favorite part was the mayo, I pulled out some of the marinade prior and added that to the mayonaise. It really makes the dish.

The marinade really made the meat tender and flavorful, while the mayonnaise gave it an added something. My family enjoyed it the night I made it, but best of all, we enjoyed the leftovers as cold steak sandwiches, using the mayonnaise, the next day. Tasted even better!

Very flavorful. I used Trader Joe's low sodium soy sauce because that's all I had and used 3 Tbs. of oil in the marinade--my mistake in reading the recipe. I grilled it and it was perfect. I would put more of the marinade into the mayonnaise next time but otherwise wouldn't change a thing.

Delicious. With triple digit summer heat, we grilled outside instead of heating the kitchen. Used Kikkoman Soy Sauce and a bit more marinade than called for in the recipe. With grilled corn and herb butter...a very nice summer treat. Wonderful the next day too.

i have made this recipe twice- once in the pan and once on the grill- my family, guests and i loved it- i used regular soy and some sherry vinegar- i also added more than suggested marinade to the mayo so it became more of a sauce than a mayo- served it with the summer tomato recipe suggested- yum yum yum- just be sure to slice it ultra thin and on an angle.

I don't usually follow a recipe to the letter unless it's baking or candy so, needless to say I didn't this time. I used worcestishire sauce instead of soy and I used sour cream instead of mayo and I used a boneless sirloin instead of flank or skirt. It was really good. My family made comments without being asked. I too put more marinade in the sauce than called for.

Good, not great. I very much liked the flavor of the marinade - - I guess it's just that London broil isn't my "thing." I, too, added additional marinade to the mayo.

Shoot! I almost forgot. Regular Soy Sauce should work just fine. I would THINK that you could either substitute Sherry in place of the soy sauce or add a Tb. or so to the marinade to mimick the missing 'triple-fermented' action of the special soy sauce. We have so many markets in our area now that sell specialty items like that it's not an issue. I'll have to give it a try and post how it goes!

This recipe immediately caught my eye as I am trying to modify my eating life-style to lower carbs. I concur with sentiments to 'Cape Cod'. A recent real life analogy was on another site where a cook book was reviewed. The book provides methods for adapting each recipe to steer towards vegetarian/kosher/low carb. A Vegan posted a similar post, that the book didn't belong on the shelves because it incorporates animal products. It's not a vegan book. The comment was inappropriate. For those of you who would like some valid, published information on portion control, here is an article http://education.nyu.edu/nutrition/PDFS/portion_size.pdf It states, "Similarly, a USDA standard meat serving is 2 to 3 oz, and the recommendation is two to three servings for a daily total of 5 to 7 oz," (p.2). So, with this information, the 6-8 oz. portion per person falls within the USDA guidelines providing that is your only red meat of the day. For 'Bellingham', the recipe emphasizes to serve, "at room temperature or chilled." That is the part that really caught my eye as I am breaking myself of going out for lunch, instead bringing my lunch with me. In just one month of doing that, I have dropped 10 lbs and fit into clothes that I haven't been able to for 6 months. This looks like a terrific recipe to continue on that healthy path.

This recipe sounds good but can you get fermented soy sauce in the store, rather than calling an 800 #? Can you use regular soy sauce instead or something else. Thanks for any tips on this.

I made this recipe using "flat iron" steaks (also called chicken steaks). They tend to be 1$ cheaper per pound than either flank or london broil and are as tender as can be! No need to marinate for tenderizing...just to add some flavor. I also increased the amount of marinade for the mayo and added about another tbl of soy sauce to the mayo for more flavor. Everyone loved it.

Oh Please , Cape Cod . . . it;s just a ball park figure. No where does it say that each person has to eat exactly one 6th of the total amount served. Maybe there'll be leftovers for a nice steak sandwich the following day. Besides, 2.75 lbs. divided by 6 is under 7 ounces per person before cooking. That is not outrageous. It's not a couple extra bites of homecooked beef per meal that's making Americans fat. It's our sedentary lifestyles, and all the fast foods and processed foods

This is a great recipe and to Cape Cod, please don't use a recipe rating forum to spout your personal views on nutrition. This is for people to share information about how the dish "tastes" and should be made and your rating, which you admit has no basis, defeats the entire purpose and serves only to mislead people about the quality of this recipe. A nutrition site would be more appropriate.

Just for the record. The typical cut used for London Broil in both East & West coast butcher shops is Top Round. Flank steak is not a traditional London broil cut. This is a very good recipe if done correctly.

To the cook from London: according to Epicurious' food glossary, this is a London broil--A FLANK STEAK that has been cut into large pieces, tenderized by marinating, broiled or grilled, then thinly sliced across the grain. 2. A term also used for various thick cuts of meat including sirloin tip (see SIRLOIN) and top round (see ROUND).

Tasty and I would make it again; however, it is not outstanding. I marinated the meat all day and I cannot say that it absorbed much flavor so I had to rely on the sauce to make it interesting. I tripled the amount of marinade that I added to the mayo to give it some oomph. I served it warm for a dinner party and then had some leftover for the next day and it was quite good cold.

I grilled the meat in this recipe, and it was really good. I suppose I'll try it on the stove when the weather cools off. I agree with the cook below that Kikkoman soy sauce works really well in this recipe and with another that the more marinade should be added to the mayonnaise.

This was soooo good! I used the London broil cut (at least that's what they call it here in the northwest), simply one of the tastiest things I've ever fixed! I agree about increasing the amount of marinade in the mayo. (A hint: years ago I read that gourmet Chinese cooks use Kikkoman soy sauce...it works just fine in this recipe!)

This was very good and quite simple. I used a Flank Steak and grilled it. One suggestion (at least for my taste), I started the mayonnaise sauce with the 2-Tbs of marinade but ended up adding quite a bit more marinade. I didn't measure it, I just added marinade until I liked the flavor. It was a crowd pleaser!

Super easy and super good! I made this with the "Summer tomatoes" recipe (also in Gourmet July 2005), with some mixed greens and warm bread. Ate it fairly warm, but it's good to know that it can be room temp to make in advance for a party.
