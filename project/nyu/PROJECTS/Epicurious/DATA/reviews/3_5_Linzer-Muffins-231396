These are fabulous muffins, my favorite that I've ever made. Moist, crummy and full of flavor. I made as directed except for a few things: Did not toast almonds (and still has a rich almond flavor); cut the sugar to 1/2 cup (still could be reduced a little); added fresh lemon juice to wet mixture; and used fresh raspberries and blackberries, which I gently folded in at the end, instead of a jam center. I LOVE THESE MUFFINS. The one thing I would do to enhance next time is to put a few more berries on the tops before baking. So sad that berry season is ending as I would have been making these more than once for sure.

Baked these for the first time tonight. Followed recipe exactly, and they were perfectly done and moist after 20 minutes at 400 degrees. I would give these 4 forks, but I'm stingy with forks - they're worth at least 3-1/2 forks. I used my homemade raspberry jam which spread some during baking; next time I'll chill it before baking. A delicious muffin, and worth the extra work.

These baked up beautifully -- I used a thick jam and paper muffin liners so avoided some of the cohesion problems described by other reviewers. These are sweet and pastry-like and for us, more appropriate for dessert or with an occasional sweet breakfast.

These got rave reviews from everyone who had them. Personally I thought they were a bit too sweet. I'd stick with one of them with coffee for an indulgent breakfast. The ground almonds added a nice depth of flavor.

I enjoyed this muffin very much. They freeze well so it's nice to have them tucked away when a craving hits!

I enjoyed this muffin very much. The almond "cake" is moist & delicious and they freeze well so you can keep them tucked away until a craving hits!

Delicious for afternoon tea - too cake like for me for breakfast but delicious. I used plum jam as that's what I had on hand and whole wheat flour - I will make them again

No problem with the mechanics but the cake-like texture was somewhat bland; I put a dab of jam on top to liven it up.

Disappointing...I followed the reciped as written, and had several comments/observations/suggestions: 1) The biggest problem I had was with the jam filling. I used "President's Choice" seedless raspberry jam (a premium Canadian brand), which was rather soft at room temperature. As a result, when I covered the blob of jam with the remaining batter, it sort of squeezed out sideways instead of staying in the middle. Result: A big mess--the jam leaked all over the pans, fused the muffins to it, and made the muffins more fragile (the tops had a tendency to sort of crack and fall off. If I were to do this again, I would use a different brand and would probably chill it and perhaps even make a depression in the batter to hold it. 2) The muffins were OK--the texture was more fine and cake-like than muffin-like. Those that had disgorged most of their jam were pretty bland. 3) I found the batter to be a bit bland in general. I would probably double both the cinnamon and the almond extract next time. 4) When the jam stayed in the muffins, they seemed rather cloying to me. I might add some lemon juice to the jam to cut the sweetness.

OMG- these are just unbelievable! They came out tender, fragrant, with such a wonderful depth of flavour and texture. I am a *freak* for linzer cookies- and this recipe will be made in my house for many, many years to come. By far one of the best recipes I have found in my 6+ years here on Epicurious. (And I forgot the lemon zest- so I drbbled teh tiniest amount of lemon juice on the tops as they cooled, then when they were totally cooled I sprinkled with the icing sugar.) Also, you can buy ground almond flour in many healthfood shops, ethnic shops, and in the organic section of most grocery stores (Bob's Red Mill is the brand I used)- there is no need to grind your own.

Delicious! I used blueberry jam as I didn't have raspberry on hand. Also cut the sugar and almonds to 2/3 cup.

The kids loved it! I wanted to reduce the amount of calories in the recipe by cutting down on the almonds. To replace 1 cup of ground almonds, I measured 1/3 cup of ground almonds and added 2/3 cup of whole wheat flour. I did not have sugar and replaced it with brown sugar. It came out delicious.

Tasty muffins; however, they were bottom heavy, leaving jam everywhere and almost each one broke trying to get them out of the pan. So, I'd say fill 2/3 full and then a tsp of jam. Again, tasty, but kind of aesthetically disappointing.

This is an excelent recipe for muffins and with the almonds roasted before they were added creates a wonderful depth of flavor. I will definitly make this recipe again with varitations of jam and flours. My only suggestion is to only fill the muffin cups about 2 tablespoons full before the jam because my muffins were filled too much leaving only the barest skin of muffin on top rather than jam in the middle.

I thought these were a nice twist to the plain old banana muffins. I used whole almonds with skin on and really liked the texture and color they gave. I used Bonne Maman raspberry jam (with seeds) and thought it was good that way. The batter is very easy to make. One think I loved about them is that they keep very well for 2-3 days. A great recipe.

Not clear from the recipe--are these almonds blanched? I used whole almonds with skins, since there was no indication to the contrary. The resulting muffins were a little too rustic. My husband gave them a thumbs down and since he is the primary muffin eater around here, I won't bother to try again with blanched almonds.

These were really good and easy to make. I love the combination of almond cake with raspberry filling. Just like a Linzer cookie! And the dusting of confectioner's sugar on top adds to the authenticity. I will definitely be making these again!

I followed the recipe exactly and the muffins were delicious. It almost feels like eating littles cakes. I am always looking for new ideas for interesting breakfast items and I would certainly make them again.

this recipe also works really well with non-fat milk, olive oil instead of butter, and two egg whites and a spoonful of non-fat yogurt instead of the whole egg. YUM!!!
