Frozen yogurt is the fifth ingredient mentioned, last one before the berries.

My family enjoyed this easy-to-make, lowfat recipe. I thought that cutting the ladyfingers was a lot easier than rolling out the pie crust. I didn't find lime sorbet, so I used three alternating layers of lemon sorbet, lowfat raspberry swirl frozen yogurt and orange/passion fruit sorbet (fantastic, from Haagen Dazs). I also crushed some graham crackers and placed thin layers of graham crackers between each sorbet layer. Instead of berries on top, I whipped up a layer of meringue (I used the recipe from the Strawberry Baked Alaska on this site) for the top and browned it just before serving. Delicious!

Cutting the lady fingers was a real pain, and they didn't add much. A purchased dessert would have been far tastier. Next time i'll just transfer one to a nice plate!

The recipe calls for frozen yogurt in the directions but it is not listed in the ingredients. Sounds good so I'll do whatever and report my results.
