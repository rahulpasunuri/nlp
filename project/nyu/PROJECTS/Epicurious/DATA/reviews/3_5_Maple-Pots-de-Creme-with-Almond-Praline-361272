These were easy to make and set well. The finished color of these were very unappetizing to look at so I didn't serve them for my dinner party. When I tried them later I was very sorry I didn't serve them because they were fabulous! WOW! Then next time I made them I just cover the tops with more praline and that solved the color issue. Will make this over and over!

Very easy and absolutely delicious. Just remember to make it one day in advance.

I did not like this very much and I would say my guests agreed. Served 6 people instead of 4 but also served a wedge of apple tart with it as I thought the two would compliment one another. I did make a day ahead which may have been my mistake but I didn't like the taste very much.

Delicious but very rich. I made it exactly according to the recipe. Great for a special dessert.

I could not find maple sugar anywhere so just used some nice brown sugar. It turned out delicious! Its very easy and a nice presentation for guests.

We loved this! I had bought maple sugar in Michigan and had it on hand. I took this to a dinner party and everyone raved. I will definately make it again.

I used parchment paper under the praline, which was much easier than a pan. Next time I would loosely cover the tops with foil while baking, because I thought they overcooked on top. Great flavors!

Good flavors, quite easy. Make sure to not break the praline into too small of pieces. I substituted the cream with skim milk and 1.5 TBSP of corn starch and the pots still set. Make sure that the water if the pan comes half way up the sides of the pots or it will take significantly longer for the pots to set.

Be forewarned: getting the praline off the cookie sheet is a major problem. I was only able to scrape off about 1/2 of it; the rest is still glued to my cookie sheet and soaking in hot water. Should have used a Silpat or parchment paper.

This was so easy and went over beautifully. I was a little perplexed about how to get the praline out of the pan and then I just flexed the cookie sheet and it popped right out! I used maple syrup instead of the maple sugar and doubled the custard, tripled the praline, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T and it was wonderful.

This is so wonderful to serve and so so easy to make. I substituted maple syrup for the sugar (for praline).Everyone loved it!

Doesn't that look like a pecan praline rather than an almond praline in the photo?

Wow -- this is good and so easy to make. The praline is the hardest part of this recipe and that's not saying much. I didn't have any maple extract so the maple flavor wasn't super pronounced instead it tasted more like butterscotch (not a bad thing in my opinion!). I also didn't have almonds so made the praline with walnuts. Any nut would be good -- maybe pecans next time?

Rich and creamy and the perfect crunch with the almond praline. A big hit with dinner guests! Substituted maple syrup for maple sugar and baked custards in 6 1/2 cup ramekins. Perfect portion sizes for such a rich dessert.
