This is just like an artichoke salad I had on a very upscale cruise ship. I used the tender part of the stem also. It's amazing how tender and nutty the raw artichoke is. Very easy. I will definitely make this again.

Better to buy small artichokes and not have so much to discard. Also, artichoke stems, if peeled, have as much flavor as the bulb and heart and are quite edible. Recipes needs more flavor or a marinate time.
