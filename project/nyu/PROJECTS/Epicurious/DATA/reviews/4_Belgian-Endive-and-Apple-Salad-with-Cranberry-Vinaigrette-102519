A well-loved offering at my recent stuffed pizza party! Seeing the reviews below suggesting more oomph in the dressing, I added 1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard and a healthy pinch of sea salt. I think a minced shallot would also do the trick. In addition to the endive I used some romaine, chopped small. Rave reviews!

Made this as part of Christmas dinner and as a way to use up some fresh cranberries. Dressing could use a bit more depth, but overall, this salad has a nice contrast of flavors. Also added arugula, since I had some on hand, which enhanced the colors.

We had this with our Thanksgiving meal, served between dinner and dessert. Very refreshing and delicious. Definitely will be making this again soon.

Made this for company and it was delicious - had left over and it was even good the next day - unusual for salad

Salivating-ly scrumptious - Bowl lickin' clean! My personal likes changed the walnuts to pecans, a couple of times I sugared them for an extra sweetness - but wouldn't do that all the time. I used spinach instead of endive, personally don't care for the bitter greens. Dried instead of fresh cranberries. I liked the Fuji apples because of their sweet/tart taste. Last but not least of my personal perferences was to add crumbled feta!

Really delicious blend of fresh flavours! Was perfect as an appetizer for a meal in which the main course had some heavy cream and meat. Really tasty!

Delicious and colorful! I added some chopped romaine, which enhanced the color and offset the bitterness of the endive. I skipped the nuts because some of my family don't care for them, but added blue cheese, which was fabulous with the other flavors. Even with the blue cheese, I think the dressing needs a little salt. I enjoyed the leftovers for several days (not too soggy), and I will definitely make again!

I made this for our holiday luncheon and it was well received by all by the presentation and taste. I followed the advice of adding blue cheese and using dried cranberries. I subbed the endive with a bag of mixed baby greens. Colorful & festive.

Delicious! Only change I made was to leave out the onions since I'm not fond of onions. The apples do turn pink, but made the salad very festive. I have tried it with dried cranberries soaked in dressing also. Yummy.

I didn't like the combined flavor of this at all, even though I like the individual ingredients. It also didn't look very appetizing, given how the cranberry juice concentrate turned the entire salad pink. I used fresh cranberries, but maybe it would be better with sweetened dried ones. And yes, blue cheese might help fix this.

I made this recipe for a company Christmas party. However, I used a variety of mixed greens. I also used dried cranberries at the recommendation of other reviews. I didn't use the apples, since I had to make it in advance and they would discolor. I did crumble bleu cheese on top of the salad and everyone loved it!! Would definetly make this salad again.

I found the cranberries to be quite tart so I added a little sugar. Otherwise it was a great tasting salad and presented well.

It was so yummy. I actually added a bit of red wine (merlot) to the dressing and it added a great flavor, and the apple really soaked it up. Also used a mixed of lettuce to tone down the bitter endive taste. Best change I made though was using only pomegranate seeds, they are so tasty and juicy! It also went well with the cream of broccoli soup I made (recipe from here).

This is a truly fantastic salad. I first prepared it Thanksgiving '99 when it was published in Bon Appetit. I love this combo of flavors and textures. I, too, used dried cranberries with great success.

I loved this and so did the group I served it to. I've made it more than once and even added toasted pumpkin seeds to make it a true seasonal salad.

I substituted the fresh cranberries with dried sweetened cranberries , and used a mix of greens as well as the endive. I also used two kinds of sliced apples - Red Delicious and a green tart apple, and the combination was delicious.

I served this salad as a first course with a fall dinner (stuffed pork roast) and it received rave reviews. Since fresh cranberries are not always available, I buy a couple of extra bags around Thanksgiving and freeze the berries. They worked very well for this recipe. My guests requested copies! This salad will definitely become on of my staples.

Everyone loved this one. I couldn't find fresh cranberries, but used dried ones (Craisons). The endive was very bitter so I added several other types of lettuce. Since the dried cranberries were sweeter than fresh I used tart apples.

Was served this recipe over the Christmas holidays and thought it was fabulous. I love crunchy food and this had so many different flavors. I'm making it for a small party this weekend. Note that the cranberries can be very diffucult to find out of season.
