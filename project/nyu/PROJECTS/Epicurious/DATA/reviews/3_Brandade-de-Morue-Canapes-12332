great first pass at brandade. i followed the recipe almost exactly--not quite so long cooking time for the cod. i've had brandade at work, as made by a friend from haiti. hers was mixed by hand, which gives it a chunkier mouth-feel. i think i'll try that next time, even though she warned me how much elbow grease that calls for ;)

decent directions, only try poaching cod in milk, or even coconut milk. then serve with deep fried celery root.garnish with the freshest fish roe u can find
