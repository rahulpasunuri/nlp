Just terrific. I used baby bell mushrooms and greatly increased the sage. Added fresh rosemary and garlic. Used Quinoa. Roasted the squash cut side down in glass dish for 35 minutes on 400 while I prepared the filling, which gave it a nice brown look. One cup of quinoa makes way more stuffing than you need to two acorn squash. Still, the stuffing was delicious on its own.

OMG. This was so much better than I expected it to be. I used crimini mushrooms, dried cranberries and subbed quinoa for half of the bread (cubes). I also added an extra half tsp of sage.

This was a big crowd pleaser. I substituted Butternut Squash for the Acorn Squash, because I like it better & it came already prepped from the market. I made it for a Pre-Thanksgiving pot-luck & everybody raved about it. I would only make it with the acorn squash halves if I knew exactly how many people I would be feeding. I used both currants & dried cranberries. To make it a little healthier I used 2/3 margarine & 1/3 butter.

I forgot to add to my review that I substituted rustic wheat loaf cubes instead of the bread crumbs. I don't think the stuffing would have been so delish with the bread crumbs and highly recommend the sub as did so many other reviews.

This was wonderful. I will use the stuffing recipe from this for many other dishes, it is exceptional. I used baby bella mushrooms and added two Farmer Johns breakfast links to the onion mushroom saute as I had not realized I was out of sage. I then found some poultry seasoning and added a bit of that as well. Had friends over for dinner and everyone raved about the stuffing. Squash was good as well but the stuffing was the real standout!!

made this dish years ago and than forgot about it. just made it again, added some ground turkey to the stuffing and thought it was delicious and pretty healthy all things considered because i only use about 1-2 tabl of butter.

So very yummy! I did substitute 1 cup of cooked quinoa for the breadcrumbs to make it gluten free, used fresh sage, rosemary, and thyme. My boyfriend that is very leary of any squash type dish even gave it a thumbs up!

This was a nice, easy weeknight recipe. I made the whole thing in the oven rather than the microwave, and I substituted brown rice for the breadcrumbs. I also added some grated parmesan to make the stuffing creamier. Next time, I think I will added toasted almonds or pine nuts to give it a little crunch.

This was a delicious and easy recipe! I happened to have all the ingredients listed (when does THAT ever happen) and it was super simple to make. I roasted my squash (35 min in a 400 degree oven, halved and seeded face down on a cookie sheet with 1/2 inch of water). After I stuffed them and put them back in for about 15 minutes I would have liked to see them get a little browner, but I didn't add sugar like some other reviewers did. I used all fresh herbs, and I happened to have some leftover cranberry chutney (from the whole foods cheese section) which was delicious! I may try using bread next time instead of crumbs, but it doesn't really need it. All in all a great recipe, would definitely recommend it for a cold winter evening!

I took this dish to a Thanksgiving potluck at work and it was a big hit. Even the manly men firefighters liked it, which says something about a dish with no meat. Some of these tips are mentioned in other reviews, but I'll repeat the ones I think were especially useful: 1. Use chunks of rye bread instead of breadcrumbs. I'm not the biggest fan of rye bread, but I think its sharpness is perfect for this dish. 2. Microwaving the squash as the recipe calls for might work, but I baked it for half an hour instead. Put about half a teaspoon of butter in each "cup" - I used more, but this was too much and it just puddled in the squash halves. 3. I used three kinds of mushrooms: about half crimini, one quarter shitake, and one quarter oyster. I like the mix, but when I make this again I'll use the butter I *won't* add to the baking squash to saute the mushrooms and onions and bread pieces. Butter might bring out the flavor of the mushrooms more than the olive oil I used. 4. More savory! Season the bejeesus out of the dressing as you make it. I went easy on the spices because it's a new recipe, but in retrospect I wish I'd put in more sage, thyme, and maybe even some red chili to give the flavor a little more depth and complexity. Rosemary or even cumin could be good, too. 5. More sweet! I used dried currants, but mixing in dried cranberries, or substituting all cranberries, might be good too. I also added a splash of maple syrup over the top of the stuffed squash before the final baking. I could barely taste it when the squash came out, though, so if you think this sounds good, be generous. If you add the syrup, you probably can skip the final dollop of butter the recipe calls for too. The sugar in the syrup will help brown the dish and give it a nice glaze.

Rating: 3
This dish was excellent and I gave it 3 forks instead of 4 because I like to save 4 for recipes that truly blow me away. I took into consideration the other reviewers' suggestions and used quinoa instead of breadcrumbs (1/2 cup uncooked to make 1 cup). I used currants and also used fresh thyme instead of sage because I forgot to get sage. So, keep in mind my rating is also based on my modified recipe.

Rating: 4
I baked this for a full 45-50 mins rather than use the microwave. I simply sprinkled some salt on it, and put about 1 teaspoon's worth of butter inside the hollowed out portion. I then baked for 35-40 mins like that and added the stuffing as per the recipe. Turned out way better than I would have thought.. will totally make this again.

Rating: 4
I forgot to mention that the squash was a little mushy. I would take a few minutes off the time in the microwave next time and see how it goes.

I used craisins and added a little pork sausage when cooking the onions and mushrooms. The sausage had sage in it, so I didn't add the sage that the recipe calls for. It turned out delicious!!

Easy, impressive and delicious. I subbed rice for the bread crumbs to make it Gluten-free and sprinkled the edges with about 1/2 tsp of brown sugar and toasted pecans. The kids guzzled it up and went back to finish the extra stuffing.

yum!!! made this for a pre-thanksgiving potluck and it was so good...the sage really sets it off and yes I also followed suit and did it w 100% rye bread cubes from our local bakery..tasted great and was filling.

Not a huge fan of this recipe. I think the breadcrumb stuffing made it too dry and "bready", I think instead of breadcrumbs using rice or quinoa or couscous would be far more delicious. Despite that, the flavors were good - mushrooms and cranberries together. I will try this again but without the breadcrumbs and see how that goes.

Rating: 4
As everyone is saying - this could not have been easier or prettier. I used bread instead of bread crumbs as recommended, and it was delicious (liked the texture of the bread crust occasionally coming through). I think this would be a great recipe base to try a hundred different variations for the filling.

Rating: 3
I dressed up a box of ready to make stuffing by adding skiitakes, chopped onion, dried currant and sage. I stuffed the squash with this. Its a bit more seasoned than if I used the breadcrumbs the recipe indicates (shouldnt have used the sage). Acord squash is the perfect holder for this and the seeds are easy to scoop out. The best part is microwaving the squash, so quick and easy!

Rating: 4
WOW! For Thanksgiving dinner, I had an unexpected guest who is vegetarian. I wanted something special for him along with the usual side dishes. This was a hit with everyone and a great display. The only change I would make was microwaving the squash a little less time - I found some were soft than expected.

Rating: 4
Made just as suggested. The stuffing proved to be enough for two fair sized acorn squash from our garden. A fantastic recipe for Fall that goes well along side wild game.

Rating: 4
Fantastic... with a few modifications. Microwaving was quick and easy, but I think baking with butter and a little salt will make the squash a little creamier. I did use bread cubes, added some extra hot water, and used thyme instead of sage (what I had on hand). I added some chopped bacon to the stuffing, and made the stuffing with half butter, half bacon grease. Next time, when I put the stuffed squash in the oven, I'll put a bit of boiling water in the bottom of the pan to make the cleanup easier.

Like many reviewers recommended, I substituted bread cubes for the breadcrumbs, and used light olive oil instead of butter. This is an easy, fun, inexpensive dish and the audience loves it.

Rating: 4
I cannot believe how easy this was. And quick! I made the squash in the microwave and used wild rice instead of breadcrumbs per the suggestion below. Pine nuts and currants made it amazing. Also, I added one chopped up sausage to the mix which gave some extra oomph. I think it would be okay without the meat, though, also. My batch made much more filling than I could fit into two half squashes.

Rating: 4
Excellent. I used the bread cubes instead of crumbs which was a great suggestion, especially if you like dressing because it kind of reminds you of that flavor/consistency. Also, the next time I'll back off on the butter, because you wouldn't miss it if you used a little less and it's healthier. PLUS, the presentation on this baby is TRES Fabulous! You get quite a bang for your preparation buck here,so if you like the ingredients, give it a try. This one is a BIG hit.

Have made this several times and everyone loves it. I use fresh bread cubes instead of crumbs. Get a good variety of mushrooms for more flavor. This dish makes a great impression and is so simple to make. I used the microwave and found that I had to do the halves individually, but that wasn't an issue with time because I planned ahead. I will make this again.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Used blue oyster and lion's head (they look like a white lion's mane) mushrooms from the local farmer's market; a mix of dried cranberries, cherries, and blueberries; and brown rice instead of breadcrumbs. (The latter two were substitutions based on what I had on hand.) Could not have been better, and very simple to prepare. I, too, roasted the squash, with a little maple syrup, rather than microwaving since I don't have one. Added some time, but not effort. I will definitely make this again over the winter!

I've made this a number of times and everyone loves it. A fantastic addition to the Thanksgiving table, it also works well as an impressive but easy weeknight meal. I used rosemary bread and a combination of chanterelle and shitake mushrooms, which really kicked up the flavor.

This was very tasty. I used small cubes of sourdough bread rather than breadcrumbs. I also used 2 tablespoons, rather than 3 tablespoons, of butter for sauteeing, which was plenty. Next time I would cut back even more on the butter. My squash halves wouldn't fit side by side in an 8- or 9-inch baking dish, so I had to microwave them separately and then bake in a 9x13 dish--worked fine, but added 10 minutes to overall cooking time.

Rating: 2
It is possible that I may have caused the failure of this recipe to impress. I may have cooked the bread crumbs a little too long. My main problem is the stuffing turned out too dry and had too little flavor going on. It wasn't terrible, but wasn't great. I would recommend going with cubes instead of crumbs and increasing the stuffing moisture level. I would also recommend baking the squash with butter instead of microwaving - my microwave didn't cook the squash evenly. I have squash recipes I like a whole lot better, so I'm not planning on trying this one again.

This recipe is fantastic, even my daughter says its a keeper. If you use 2 or 3 very small acorn squash, you will still have enough stuffing, and every bite of squash has some of the stuffing. Otherwise, wouldn't change a thing.

I was very impressed with this recipe, and would definately make it again. Not only was it tasty, but beautiful - a great fall color pallet. I added pecans which I would really reccomend, the crunch really added! I also substituted olive oil for the butter, and torn up pieces of multigrain bread, and both worked very well in the dish. Try it for sure... its definately the perfect fall dish!

This dish was amazing. I substituted quinoa for the breadcrumbs and also olive oil in place of the butter to make a heart healty vegan entree out of this recipe. It was superb. Very easy to make (though it is a little time consuming) I might consider adding chopped walnuts in the future to add a bit of extra crunch.

Rating: 4
I am rating this as four forks because of its favorable ratio of epicurean flavor to amount of work involved. I baked the squash with maple syrup and salt and then filled/rebaked. It's really necessary to use bread crumbs from actual bread and not store bought; that makes all the difference! (plus you don't have so much extra sodium, as they tend to sneak it in store-bought). I added pecans to the stuffing and used olive oil instead of butter (why add all of that saturated fat?), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was delectable -- and I plan on making the stuffing as a standalone when I don't have squash around! My texture-sensitive and neophobic husband ate every last bit.

I've been making this several times every fall and winter for years now; it's delicious and easy to make. (I reserve 4 forks for life-altering . . .). For those who think it's only nice enough for weeknights with the family, I urge you to reconsider the ingredients you're using! I always use lots of fresh herbs (sage and thyme) rather than dried and always add some toasted, roughly chopped nuts (pecans, walnuts, or hazelnuts). It becomes special enough to serve at a vegetarian dinner party if you use a nice mix of wild mushrooms (hen-of-the-woods and oyster are particularly nice together). Another possibility is to soak the dried cranberries in heated wine (a good dry white) rather than water. Finally, rub that last tbsp. of butter inside the squash halves before you stuff them; it makes much more of a difference in flavor there than it does atop the stuffing.

Rating: 3
Easy and yummy. Will definately be making this again. I believe it is missing something that would make it that much more complex, but not quite sure what it is. I will be experimenting with this dish to find which ingredient would give it more depth and then would probably rate 4 forks.

This is a staple of mine. If you don't want to go broke or can't find shiitake mushrooms, you can sub a package of mixed wild dried mushrooms. Rehydrate with the cranberries. You'll need more water than called for, so add it judiciously to the saute -- this is where you get the flavor. I think it's even better than with the fresh shiitakes.

I have made this many times since I first discovered it, and it is wonderful every time. I like to use a little less butter than called for (about half), as it makes the recipe a bit healthier, and I don't feel that it hurts the taste at all. Brown rice is a good accompaniment. I love recipes like this one, that are tasty, healthy, and easy to make, too!
