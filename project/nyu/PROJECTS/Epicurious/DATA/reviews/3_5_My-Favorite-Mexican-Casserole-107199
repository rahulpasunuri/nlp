My suggestion is that if you want crispy tortillas you add them on top with some cheese sprinkled over(like Chilaquiles)rather than bottom. Much more fun, and tastier from my perspective, that way.

Must make adjustments and when you do is very good. My changes: upped the chips to 2 cups (broken), 1 1/4 c medium salsa & 1/4 cup enchilada sauce, doubled the garlic, red vs green pepper, added 2 tsp cumin, used black & white beans, oh and used hamburger with 1/2 a taco packet. Ok I really made a lot of changes but it's good!

Very good! People love it. There are numerous variations. I use ground turkey & sauté with lots of veggies & taco seasoning. Black beans work better.. Rather than a jar of salsa I use chopped tomatoes. I spread enchilada sauce over top. Then a 2nd round or crushed tortillas & cheese. It's delicious served with guacamole & sour cream.

Super simple, quick, and good. My family really liked it. Used black and pinto beans. Based on other reviews, added about 3/4 small can jalapenos, juice of 1 lime, 1/2 tsp cumin. Used about 2 cups of thick tortilla chips and broke them up with my hands so they were larger pieces and retained some crunch.

Rating: 4
This dish was very good. I didn't want the dish full of beans, so I skipped the garbanzo beans. I also added a small can of green chiles as suggested in some of the reviews. I also would like to mention that the tortilla chips do not form a crispy crust in the bottom as noted in the recipe. I don't see how it would stay crispy when it is covered with the filling. I will definitely make this dish again.

Comments about blandness were right on. I used ground chicken breast and added a diced jalapeno and diced red bell pepper. Used Monterey Jack with jalapeno pepper and added finely sliced green onion greens on top. Served with ice cold Corona beer. Sublime!

This is very delicious and makes a great dish to take to potluck. The deli chickens you can buy already cooked make it the easiest dish to make. I also swapped out a few things - used black beans, jalapeno canned peppers (only 1/2 a can), we do not like it too hot. Also the salsa is nice to add with the sourcream when serving.

I took this casserole to a pot luck party and though I wasn't thrilled with it, others seemed to enjoy it. Changed the recipe a bit and followed other reviewers advice by adding a small can of chilies, a can of sliced black olives, 1 tablespoon of cumin, black beans instead of garbanzos, substituted green salsa verde enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce and boiled a small chicken in broth with lime and garlic before shredding the meat. Even with the substitutions I found it to be a bit bland and it really didn't have a Mexican flavor to it. I am from southern California and am spoiled by the great Mexican food here I guess. I probably won't be making this one again.

Rating: 4
Love it! What took this from a 3fork to a 4 fork dish for me was to boil chicken thighs in ch.broth,garlic, lime juice for 3-4 hours then pull the meat apart for this dish. It takes it to another level than just using ck.breasts or leftover white meat. We use a tomatillo salsa in this which is excellent.

This is my go to recipe when I need to bring a casserole for parties, new babies etc.- it's always a hit. I gave it 3 stars only because I do make a number of changes. I use black beans vs garbanzo, Trader Joe's enchilada sauce or verde salsa vs tomato sauce, red, yellow or orange peppers vs green and I add 1 small can of chopped green chilis, juice of 1 lime and 1 T ground cumin. and I put out plain yogurt vs sour cream. Since my husband became a vegetarian we have also made this with soy chorizo instead of chicken and it's turned out quite well. We took that to a pot luck where there were several vegetarians and it went over well with the vegetarians as well as the meat eaters. It takes a bit of time to put it all together but it's well worth it. I usually make an extra small pan of it for leftovers or to freeze for later.

We substituted the chicken for lean ground beef cooked with a taco seasoning packeting and refried beans for garbanzo beans. Otherwise we used all the same ingredients and it was a hit with the whole family! Everyone loved it and wants to have it again. We served it with fresh cilantro and sour cream and tostito chips.

I'm always on the hunt for new recipes for "Taco Tuesday", a long standing tradition at our house. This one is a keeper! Like several others, I also used rotasserie chicken. Other then adding cumin & using extra salsa in place of the tomato sauce, I followed the recipe (think it was kids first exposure to garbanzo beans, and there were no complaints!). Did not think it was dry, in fact had leftovers for lunch today & still thought it was great. I used a stone baking pan so my chips crisped up nicely.

Rating: 3
While I found this recipe to be very delicious and wonderful in that it is so easily adjusted, I did find it a bit on the dry side, which can easily be solved next time. My main suggestion, though, would be to use broken or whole tortilla chips rather than crushed, and to spread them as a mid-layer and then again on the top laced with cheese. Putting the crushed tortillas as a base left them too soft and mushy after cooking, and did NOT form the crispy crust suggested.

Rating: 4
This recipe is great because as other viewers have stated, you can make adjustments based on what you have available in your pantry and it will still taste delicious. I used black beans instead of garbanzo and kidney. I added a can of cream of chicken soup and instead of tomato sauce I used a can of diced tomatoes. My husband absolutely loved it. I will certainly make this again.

Used a pre-cooked chicken from the deli. Pam on the baking dish, baked not fried chips to decrease the fat. Used all hot salsa with 2 tbsp. tomato paste instead of the tomato sauce. Added 1 tbsp. ground cumin (really needs), one can of green chili's, juice of 1 lime. Put the meat on one layer with a sprinkle of black olives. Made a 1 1/2 recipe for 10. Used one can garbanzo, one can kidney & one can black beans. Everyone loved - served for a hockey party. Easy & delicious.

What I liked about this recipe is that it was easy to subsitute what I had on hand, I have taken on a new motto to "cook what I have, not what I want". I halved the recipe, used yellow onion, red pepper, one can of black beans, a dash of chilpolte seasoning and a bag of Mexi cheese. Overall very good. Next time I would like it a little saucier and maybe throw in some black olives. The variations on the recipe are endless. My husband and son both liked it and it was very easy to put together early in the day and bake when ready.

I think this recipe is a good starting point. I used grilled Tri-Tip Steak(diced) instead of chicken. And then made the filling "smoky" in flavor with diced roasted red peppers, a pureed chipotle pepper,and no tomato sauce. I also divided the contents between two 9 inch pie tins and froze one. I think it will freeze well for a few weeks.

This was a great weeknight meal. I used pintos and kidney beans, twice the salsa and no tomato sauce and red bell peppers instead of green. I didn't saute the onions, garlic and peppers first as suggested by others, but chopped extra fine which gave it a super fresh flavor. Whole family loved it!

Wonderful and SO easy! Had a hungry group to serve and needed something quick. This makes plenty and everyone loved. Use black beans over garbanzo; added in lime juice to mixture and mild green chiles. Left out tomato sauce and served with fresh guacomole. Definitely making again!

Amazingly delicious. Great flavors and they combine beautifully. Don't leave out the tortilla chips, they add another level of flavor. Next time, I think I will layer it differently, with the shredded chicken in a layer, and the rest of the 'mix' as its own layer. Delish.

This is a great recipe. It's very fresh tasting. I also made some changes in ingredients to suite my familys tastes. But the main difference I make in this recipe is combining all the ingredients together. Chips, cheese and all! Mix all together in a bowl and bake, so easy and no problems with soggy crust.

I made this for my play group and all of our 2 year olds, and it was a winner. I used black beans instead of the garbanzo and omitted the pepper. Also added a layer of crushed tortilla (the thick kind) chips on the top with the last layer of cheese. I also found a spanish style tomato sauce that worked well. I baked it for 20 minutes covered, 15 uncovered.My friends requested the recipe and one has already made it twice- once for family, once for friends. I think if I had made two pans they would have been both empty! A keeper.

Excellent. I made it for Mexican friends with kids. 6 yr old loved it, 4yr old so-so, but she is a picky eater. Adults loved it. I made these changes: black beans, pinto beans, can of corn. No garbanzo beans.no tomato sauce. Added 1 cup of green enchilada sauce, 1 cup of medium salsa. Sauteed the onions and garlic before adding. Added juice of 1 lime. Used the cheddar and Monterrey jack cheese as suggested. Added another layer of chips over first layer of chicken. Incredibly easy. My husband is not a big fan of Mexican food and he loved it. would not use the enchilada sauce if making for kids as some may find it too spicy, but great for adults. Baked for 20 min covered and 15 uncovered.

I followed the recipe and found it dry and a bit bland. Also the onions and green pepper were virtually raw. In the future I would saute the veggies, leave out the garbanzos (too dry), add jalapenos/green chiles and try again. Also, the crushed chips turned to mush and I wondered whether broken up taco shells might not be a better complement for the dish.

This was great. Everyone wanted seconds. It's not haute cuisine but a satisfying winter meal. We did substitute and add several items. First the substitutions: Black beans for garbanzo, yellow pepper for green then we upped the cilantro to 1/2 cup and used Trader Joe's verde green salsa both in and on top. We then added in a small can of chopped green chilis, 1T ground cumin and the juice of 1 lime. Also, we have dietary restrictions in our house so we had 2 casseroles, one with cheese and one without which was still really good- my 10 year old picky eater says to say YUMM!

I made this last night and it was so easy and good! I used all black beans, frozen corn, and roughly 1.5cups of salsa. I did not cook the onion and garlic before mixing in, as some people did. I actually liked the extra crunch that the onions added (and since they were red onions, I didn't find the flavor overwhelming). Will definitely make it again.

Thought this was good. Made it for a weeknight meal. I substituted pinto beans for the garbanzo beans only because I like them more. I would increase the amount of sauce and salsa. I baked the casserole uncovered, (recipe didn't say,) which I regret because it seemed a bit dry. Would probably make again.

This was DELICIOUS! This would be a great way to use up leftovers after a party (chicken, salsa, tortillas). I wanted to make a healthier version, so I took corn tortillas and placed them directly on my oven rack for about 10 minutes to make them crispy. I thin just crushed them in the bottom of the pan and voila...fat free tortilla chips! My husband (who has a hearty appetite) loved this and compared it to a loaded nacho platter! I plan to use it for football Sundays! My substitutions: I added the juice of one fresh lime, eliminated the garbanzo beans and added one can of black beans, added a little more salsa and used medium salsa. I did not layer the cheeses because I wanted to just use a small amount on the top...it was perfect and the tortillas, which I crushed into large chunks, were very crisp!

I think this recipe is muy fantastico and my boyfriend kept sneaking into the kitchen to get more spoonfuls of it long after dinner was over! The "crispy" chip crust was not so much "crispy" as it was soggy, but I loved the flavor the corn tortilla added to the dish! Maybe the trick is to add more chips than the recipe calls for? I highly reccommend this dish for a Cinco de Mayo party, Seis de Mayo, Siete de Mayo.....

Pretty good. I followed the black bean advice because, I too love black beans over kidney and garbanzo(?).Also, I sauteed the onion/garlic to soften them up and release the flavor. Added a can a can green chilis and I have a nice dish to take to a Cinco De Mayo party. I like it and I am hoping the party guests do to.

I did the lower- carb version of this recipe by omitting the tortilla chips and the corn, but I did use black beans (only) and a southwest-style salsa which was heartier. It was terrific!! I had some extra organic poached chicken breasts, which I simply hand shredded. I also did follow the others' suggestions to sautee the onions and garlic (be careful not to burn the garlic!) and everything was super easy and quick. The sour cream, cilantro, toppers were a great touch. Would definitely make this recipe a keeper!

I love this recipe. I used chicken breast that I baked in the oven at 375 for 15 minutes seasoned with salt and pepper and olive oil (and a little butter added half way through) and then shredded with a fork. I skipped the garbanzo beans (seems like an odd choice in this recipe) and used kidney beans and black beans. I skipped the tomatoe sauce, used more salsa, and a little premaid enchilada sauce. It is hard to get jack cheese in Europe so I used a provolone picante cheese and cheddar. My tortilla chips were not soggy at all, but I was careful to use thick chips. I took the advice of other reviewers and sauteed onions and garlic. I skipped bell pepper. Loved it for weeknight meal of friday casual get together. I live in Belguim but am from California so am always happy for Mexican food.

This is a great dish for a casual gathering. It was a hit at an outdoor Labor Day party. I used black beans and pinto beans (no garbanzos), a mix of Monterey Jack and Pepper Jack cheeses (no cheddar), and mild enchilada sauce rather than plain tomato. I also left out the chips and instead layered corn tortillas on the bottom and in the middle, between the layers. Fresh tomatoes, cilantro and sour cream on top really make the dish.

I tried this recipe on default when I realized that I didn't have a few staples of another recipe that I was going to try. With a few simple changes this is a delicious and very easy, quick recipe. While I wouldn't serve for a formal dinner party, I certainly would serve to family, on a buffet or at a community potluck. These are the changes I made and will keep - I used 2 cups crushed corn tortillas (make sure you grease the pan and use a substantial corn chip with a good corn base as this will ensure a crispy crust. I then added 2-13 oz cans of chicken breast (I know, I know....this is going to blow your gourmet minds apart....and frustrate those of you who think some type to much) I added 1 can black beans and 1/2 can kidney beans, frozen corn (because we prefer frozen over canned, 1/2 red pepper (which I would keep for the contrast and color in the dish and then add 1/2 green also),1 tsp Mexican Oregano, 1 tsp cumin, 2 tsp Adobo seasoning (delete salt), 1/4 cup of finely chopped canned chipotles, 1/2 cup of cilantro because we love it and enchiladas sauce for the tomato sauce. Next time I will probably top with Queso Fresco or another crumbly mexican cheese for taste. And as for the taste...it is wonderfully warm, homey and delicious.

This has become a well-liked staple in my house. I substituted 1 can enchilada sauce for tomato sauce & added some green chili's. Both were welcome additions to this recipe! With the leftovers, I put the casserole stuffs (not the chips) in 8 inch tortillas, brushed on a bit of butter & baked until slightly golden. Tossed a few in the freezer & they are perfect for lunch.

My eaters and I prefer black beans to kidneys. Add more crushed chips to counter the slightly wetter bean. This is easy, yummy, and healthy.

Forget the complainers. When you want something fast and simple, this is a great recipe. You can spice it up to make it more "authentic", add more cheese, whatever you like. I added Adobo seasoning, and would have liked some chipotle peppers in there too. It's certainly not gourmet but good tasting, healthy, and filling is a pretty good combo in my book.

A keeper, for sure. The vegetables remain crunchy, the cilantro and tortilla chip crust provide a subtle Southwest flavor, and the result is filling and delicious.

I used this a a base recipe to empty out some stuff in my refrigerator. I had 1/2 of a leftover steak, frozen chicken breasts, no corn, no tomato sauce, and a bunch of chunky Chi Chi's salsa. I sliced the steaK very thin. I braised the chicken in the drained juice from a can of chopped tomatoes, some juice from a jar of sliced jalapenos, and half a beer. I substituted a can of black beans for the corn, and the chopped tomatoes and extra salsa for the tomato sauce. I added some of those jalapenos. I sauteed the onion in some olive oil before adding it to the mix. I only had pepper jack cheese and cheddar, so that's what I used. I had no tortilla chips. My husband really enjoyed it, and so did I. The jury is still out on my daughter, as she's still picking at it. I'd make it again with the chips and maybe an avocado for garnish. Not bad for a family meal, tho definitely not for company.

This is a terrific basic recipe just made t;o experiment with. As it is it is more of a new Yorker's idea of Mexican. I have served it for two parties, substituting black beans for the garbanzos, red and yellow peppers for the green ones, and habenero chedder and mexican queso for the cheeses. I also used a bit more chicken (3 whole breasts) with roasted red pepper salsa and olives instead of tomatoes for the garnish. This made it more "Southwestern" and my southern friends gave it rave reviews. Note: 3 recipes serve 48 people. This is a real "keeper" to my way of thinking.

To all those complaining about the amount of canned foods used in this recipe: the key word here is "Simply", as in "easy to prepare", which I believe is the point of "Simply Delicious". If canned foods don't meet your culinary standards, then by all means, soak your dried beans overnight and cook them for hours yourself.

This is a basic, unpretentious dish that has the benefit of being quite healthy and reasonably tasty and very easy. I will make this again but will add some ground cumin and perhaps some green chiles or some miles jalapenas.

I made this recipe and it was great.... although I did doctor it a little. I didn't have tortilla chips so I instead put a couple of tortillas, toasted, on the bottom and in between layers, to make something like a lasagne. I also had to use pinto beans in place of garbanzos. We really liked it and due to how quick, easy and nutritious it is, I will be making this in the monthly rotation.

In all fairness, I used this recipe as a base for the left-overs in my kitchen. I put an equal amount of chips on bottom and on top. I cooked the casserole for 30 minutes,then added the cheese on top and cooked for 10 more minutes. I added a 1 lb.,1.25oz. jar of enchilada sauce rather than tomato sauce and salsa and used a jalapeno rather than red bell pepper. I had 2 small zucchinis and I made a layer of those rather than using corn. I also had leftover chalupas (mexican pork and beans) and pork roast, both of which had onions included. I added some extra beans, too, but not garbanzo. The casserole was moist, with a crisp top and my family loved it.

I have to say that my entire family really enjoyed it. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it was very moist and heated through.

Yeah folks, admittedly this is far from a gourmet recipe, but it does have its merits. I was surprised to see such a basic recipe win top honors in Parade's "Best Casseroles" contest. "Huh??" Surely I could come up with something better and have my picture in PARADE magazine with a blue ribbon next to it. : ) Like other reviewers, I bristled at the thought of using a multitude of canned products. "It's going to be basic shmasic," I thought. But the family wanted to try it. Know what? Sometimes an elementary dish can fit the bill and be tasty. We all enjoy it - as rudimentary as it is. Note that the tortilla chips do not, as the recipe claims, "form a crispy crust on the bottom of the casserole." Instead they just lie there as the bottom layer, but that's okay. I poached my own chicken to yield fresh, moist meat (you can also prepare the recipe with ground beef; that works too), and I upped the quantitied of garlic and cheeses a bit. The fresh cilantro gives the dish some semblance of authenticism, so go for it (if you like the stuff, that is - many don't). Yes, this is "Cooking 101," but it's kind of yummy in it's own basic little way. Not everything has to be a showstopper, right? (....just don't ask me to prepare a dessert from a cake mix - I draw the line there!)

I guess my expectations were low, since it WAS opening cans, but my husband and I both enjoyed it. I left out the cilantro, since I don't like it, did the boiling water dunk for the onion, used a chipotle salsa and cooked the casserole at 375 for 45 minutes, since 30 at 350 didn't seem nearly enough. I had avocado on the side, too, in addition to s. cream and tomatoes. To the cook in LA, the only thing prepared was the salsa and man, groceries must be expensive there because I spent maybe ten bucks and had extra chips, cheese and salsa. For the Wisconsin cook, I wouldn't have dreamed of making a casserole from a bunch of canned food for a dinner party, no matter how informal.

This reminded me of bringing leftovers home from a mexican restuaurant and tossing them in the blender. On the upside....at least it wasn't so spicy that I can give the rest of it to our dogs for dinner tomorrow!!!

My kids and my husband loved this. It was easy to make and have it cook while I carpooled. I changed it a bit. I added 1 large can of crushed tomatoes with roasted garlic instead of the tomato sauce and salsa, 2 cloves of crushed garlic, 1 small jar of chopped chiles, 1 tablespoon of ground cumin, corn with red and green peppers already in it and white instead of purple onion and 2 tablespoon of homemade pesto ( I was a little low on the fresh cilantro) They already want leftovers tomorrow.

Okay, I admit I'm a food snob. I had to humble myself to try this recipe. Crunching up nachos and opening cans is not my idea of cooking. But the reviews convinced me to attempt this. Also, I am a student and seeking cheap, easy, meals. Well - I'm baffled. When one cooks something, there is usually some kind of improvement that occurs upon the assembling and heating of the ingredients. But such magic failed to happen in this dish. It essentially tastes like a bunch of beans, cheese, chicken, etc. on top of some crunched nachos. It looks just like that, too, for there is no melding. What's more, the onion and green pepper don't cook fully and are overpoweringly astringent. It reminds me of Taco Bell, or at least what I imagine Taco Bell food to be like. To boot, when I think about it, it wasn't even that cheap, as all the prepared and packaged ingredients add up to around $20.00. You'd be better off sticking a whole chicken in the oven for dinner.

This was, surprisingly, one of the best recipes I've ever tried here. I doubled the recipe but used only 1 can of corn. I also served chopped up avacado on the side.

As I was putting this together I thought it wouldn't amount to much. Boy was I wrong. This is absolutely delightful. Such an interesting mingling of tastes.
