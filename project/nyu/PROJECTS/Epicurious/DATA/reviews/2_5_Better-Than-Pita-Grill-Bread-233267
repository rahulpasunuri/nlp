I used this for making Shawarma rolls. It was just like the shawarma I would eat at the local lebanese store.

I tried this recipe exactly as it is.. and it came out absolutely beautiful. It reminded me of the Khubz we would eat for dinner while in Saudi Arabia. I've blogged it here: http://latenightcook.blogspot.com/2012/01/better-than-pita-grill-bread.html

I should have read the reviews.....though I may work this recipe again with some modifications. There is definitely too little water.....I would rather have to add flour than try to add water. The yeast water and sugar should be proofed a little at least - and I'm not so sure there shouldn't be more yeast. Ok.....so maybe I won't try it again! If I want tortillas, I'll use my recipe. If I want pita....I'll use a true pita recipe!

I knew something was amiss when I had to put all my might into rolling out the rounds. The result was hard, not flavorful, and a disappointment.

I followed the recipe as it was written before reading these reviews and found that the bread was extremely dry and did not hold together except for small patches(did not add any more flour like they suggested). Was able to make 3 weirdly shaped pieces and those were nothing to write home about.

After heeding the warning of the two previous people, I substituted the oil for melted butter, upped the salt and sugar, and added a whole egg. I grilled it on a regular pan. It turned out pretty good. It was still good the next day too. Make sure when cooking it on any pan, that you get some well-darkened spots. They add a great pita flavor!

I too followed the recipe (& reread it to see if I had made a mistake). I found the dough very dry (I did not add more flour than the 2 cups). They puffed as I cooked them but something was missing, texture I believe.

Something must be amiss with this recipe as the breads lacked flavor and were very doughy tasting. I did follow the recipe very carefully.
