@A Cook from Michigan-- There is a button left of the recipe that allows you to rate the recipe without writing a review if you wish. You just click on it and choose how many "forks" you give the recipe. Hope this helps.

Just curious--how does a recipe get a 4-Fork Rating when there are no reviews? Thanks--MsAliGal
