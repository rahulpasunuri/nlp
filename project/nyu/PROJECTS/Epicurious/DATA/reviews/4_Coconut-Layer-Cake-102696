I have been making this recipe since it first came out in 1999. At one point in my life I was a cooking class instructor and did some baking on the side for an area business, this was my go-to recipe for a basic white cake or chocolate cake, too, actually. This produces a moist, light cake, that is delicious. My son requested it every year for his birthday. Note, I have made the recipe as stated many, many times, but have also successfully decreased the sugar by up to 1/3 a cup without effecting the texture too adversely. Those who had issues with the cake being dense, I suspect that the batter is either being overworked or that the egg whites are deflated too much as they are being folded in. I usually stop using my standmixer after the butter and first round of flour are incorporated to decrease the risk. Especially with cakes that use egg whites to help them rise, it is very easy to stir too much, releasing the air that would help it rise and be light. Toasting the coconut sounds like a great option. I am making it today for Easter and plan to try that. I will be using large, flaked, unsweetened coconut on the outside or a mixture of that an traditional sweetened shredded coconut. Can't wait to eat it!

This recipe is delicious! My only modification is that i added 1 tsp. coconut extract to the batter and to the frosting. This recipe is fairly easy, and very moist and tasty! I will make this again, maybe even try cupcakes!

I have made this recipe several times. I really wanted to love this cake, as I love coconut and there have been great reviews. Each time I made it, when it didn't come out as expected, I had to think it was my skills or lack thereof. But at this point, after making this cake the 4th time, I'm pretty sure the recipe is flawed. It is strange because both the use of buttermilk and the whipped egg whites should lighten the cake up. But they don't. I am not afraid of a rich cake, but this one is too dense and not moist enough. If I had to guess the issue, and if I were to ever try this one last time (which I just might in my stubborness), I think I'd substitute cake flour and sift it. It's really strange to me that they don't call for sifting the flour when using all-purpose. Otherwise, I like the overall taste. The frosting adds to the overall flavor of coconut. So I would not expect to use a different frosting and get the same coconut effect.

Made exactly as written and it was the absolute hit of the block party. I lightly toasted the coconut and I feel that really heightened the coconut flavor so I did not at all feel a need for coconut extract as other users noted. I thought the cream cheese frosting would not go well (but made it anyhow), but it was perfect. I am making it again this weekend, but into cupcakes for another party!

Rating: 3
The only change I made was to toast the coconut that went on the top and sides. I should have used coconut extract (I bought some and forgot to use it) since the coconut flavor was too subtle overall. The texture was odd and too dense. The cake was borderline dry on the outer half and slightly underdone in the center. The only reason I awarded three forks was the amazing cream cheese frosting. I'll probably try a different cake recipe next time and keep this frosting.

Rating: 4
I made this cake today and my entire family absolutely loved it. As others suggested, I used three cups of cake flour in place of all purpose flour and added about a tablespoon of coconut extract. For the frosting, I reduced the cream of coconut to two tablespoons and added some coconut extract- perfectly sweet! I will definitely make this cake again; it may even become my base for a good old vanilla cake.

Rating: 4
This cake is fabulous. I followed the advice of one reviewer and added 1 tbsp of extract to the cake and 2 tsp to the frosting. I do not understand the reviews that it is too sweet. It is CAKE and it has 4 cups of sweetened coconut on top; really what did you expect? Eat a smaller piece... This got rave reivews from everyone. I think next time I would refrigerate the frosting for a bit before frosting the cake just to firm it up as it is a little soft.

I've been making this cake for 3 years. It has become the most requested cake for Easter and birthdays in my family (made about 10 so far.) I stick to the recipe for both the cake and the frosting with two exceptions: I toast the coconut before putting it on the cake, and I add about 1 tablespoon of coconut extract to the cake and about 1 to 2 teaspoons to the frosting depending on my taste preference. Like many butter cakes, it is dense, but people rave about it-love it!

Rating: 3
This is a very sweet cake. But most prominently there is A LOT of it! I doubled the recipe to make a two-tiered cake and now ended up with a 10-inch, an 8-inch and a 6-inch tier with plenty to spare for cupcake-size test cakes. Havent tried the big ones but I can say from the tiny taste-testers that it is very sweet! I would advize to cut down on the sugar.. Really fluffy though which I love!

i was going to make a mix cake but the other reviews raved so that i had to try this recipe. i would agree that the coconut flavor in the cake was mild--if i could have found real coconut flavoring, i would have added it. nevertheless, the cake was a big hit at easter! i halved the amount of confectioner's sugar in the frosting and also added 1/2 cup of cream in lieu of the second package of cream cheese as another reviewer suggested. i also stuck sweetened shredded coconut onto the cake. it was all very yummy. i made more cake than necessary because it was going to become a bunny rabbit (wish i could share the photo) and it's delicious without frosting too.

Easter dinner winner!Really good recipe and not at all hard to whip up. I used cake flour verses all purpose and like most others, extra extract to jazz up the flavor.I also made butter creme frosting verses the creme cheese, only because I am not a fan of creme cheese frosting. This cake is a keeper.

This recipe is phenomenal! I took other reviewers' suggestions and substituted 3 c. cake flour for the all-purpose flour, and I added 1 tsp. coconut extract to the batter and the frosting. I also used canola spray and parchment paper instead of butter and flour, and the cake didn't stick to the pans at all. It was denser than I was expecting, but extremely moist and delicious! It also keeps very well in the fridge; I made it 4 days ago and when I had the last slice today, it was still amazing. I will definitely hold onto this recipe.

i have made this cake several times, and it's turned out beautifully each time. though some reviewers find the cake dense, i've not had that experience. the only alteration i make is with the frosting. i use 8 oz of cream cheese, 1/2 c of the coconut cream, 1 c powdered sugar, and 1/2 cup of whipping cream. this cake has made me famous in some circles. thanks!

One thing I forgot to add with my previous review - The batter didn't seem to have a lot of coconut flavor so I added about 1/2 a teaspoon coconut extract to boost the flavor. I would definitely recommend it.

Very tasty! I was surprised at how dense the cake turned out even with the addition of the beaten egg whites. The only cream of coconut I could find came in a 21-oz bottle, so I had quite a bit left. I was initially a little concerned that the cake might be a little dry, so I mixed some of the leftover cream of coconut with water to thin it out and made a syrup that I brushed on the cake layers. I also cut the two layers in half to make four layers. Using the linked cream cheese frosting recipe, I just barely had enough to put between each layer and frost a thin layer on the outside of the cake. And I toasted the coconut before adhering to the frosting layer because I prefer the texture. Definitely a keeper!

I have made this cake several times, exactly as written, and it is a lovely cake with a perfect texture. It also makes great cupcakes - in the spring time, I put an edible flower on top of each cupcake as the final touch - looks so pretty surrounded by the coconut and frosting! Having also searched for many years for a perfect yellow cake recipe, I have also modified this recipe to make as a yellow cake - just substitute sweetened condensed milk in place of the canned cream of coconut. This yields a great yellow cake ready for your favorite chocolate frosting. Happy baking!

This was an amazing cake! I read tons of the reviews and after I made it decided that, as another reviewer suggested, some who complained of a runny frosting may be using coconut milk or coconut water, instead of the required coconut CREAM in the cake and frosting, that would make for very runny frosting and I'm not sure what it would do to the cake.... Only deviations I made was to sift the flour, as one reviewer has suggested. I cut the powdered sugar for the frosting in half, it was still sweet, with a nice tang from the cream cheese, a perfect blend coupled with the subtle dense cake. I also toasted the coconut and did not press it to the sides. I will make this many many more times!

This is a GREAT recipe. I needed a dozen coconut cupcakes, so I halved the recipe (which made 13 cupcakes). I added 1/2 tsp. coconut extract to the batter, and I recommend doing this (for a full recipe, add 1 full teaspoon). They were unbelieveably light and fluffy, moist, and rose beautifully. I frosted them with cream cheese frosting, to which I added 1 tsp. coconut extract and about 1/2 cup cream of coconut. DEFINITELY a keeper.

I was so excited to make this cake and it turned out terrible! I followed the recipe to a T, but got a sunken-in cake that wouldn't leave the pan. Something is terribly off with the ingredients in this cake. The crumbles that fell from the pan tasted delicious, and the frosting was yummy, but what a mess!

I have made this cake as part of a dessert I serve in my restaurant. The only thing I change is that I omit the butter and use the entire can of sweetened cream of coconut instead. It gives it a lot more coconut flavor and it has enough fat content so the butter is not missed. Love this recipe. :)

Rating: 4
Love this recipe! Much lighter than most coconut cakes. I did not use the cream cheese frosting -- I used buttercream and used the leftover cream of coconut in it -- following another reviewer's recommendation -- I added coconut extract to the cake and to the frosting. Even though I mistakenly added my only PARTIALLY beaten egg whites before the buttermilk -- I just whipped it up 30 seconds or so and the texture was still just great. I used three nine inch layers and they were ready in 30 minutes. I had some extra coconut cream and I basted the top of each layer with that before frosting. This is a great recipe.

To cindydoll from Miami- any grocery store should have sweetened shredded coconut- it gets used to make coconut macaroons, among many other things, so it's usually in the baked goods aisle, somewhere between nuts and chocolate chips. It's in a bag kinda like chocolate chips bag (also roughly the same size). Pretty sure that Baker's (the ones that make baker's chocolate) make the most common brand, but I could be wrong.

The cake turned out very well, everyone liked the cake. I used the cream cheese frosting recipe recommended from the tropical carrot cake recipe. The frosting was not good. It was the worst frosting recipe I have ever tried. It turned out pasty, goopy, ultra sweet, and twice as much as I needed. I used the coco lopez, shook it up well, scraped the can to get the stuff stuck in the bottom. My conclusion is that besides being a bad recipe, any cream cheese frosting does not pair well with coconut cake. I think the cake would have been excellent with a simple butter cream frosting and coconut sprinkled on top, which is what I will try if I ever make the cake again. Needless to say, I will never make either of the recommended cream cheese and coconut frosting recipes again. A bad experience.

I made this exactly to the recipe and thought it was delicious. I made it the night before, refrigerated the layers, and the cake was still moist the next day. The coconut flavor wasn't extremely strong but with the coconut frosting and covered in toasted coconut it worked perfectly. It may have been my oven (just moved into a new place and haven't tested the temperature control) but my 9in rounds baked in 35 minutes.

This was a delectably moist cake (akin to a tender pound cake but without any heaviness). I doubled the batch to make a 4- tiered fondant cake for my mum's birthday. The only criticism I have would be that the coconut flavour in the cake came out slightly muted. I didn't use coconut extract (didn't have any in my pantry), but I would definitely recommend the use of it to amplify the coconut flavour.

This cake is delicious! I took some of the suggestions from other reviewers such as using cake flour instead of all-purpose...Perfect! This cake was so moist and light. I also added coconut extract to the batter as well as the sweetened cream of coconut. As for the icing, I made a cream cheese icing with a teaspoon to a teaspoon and a half of coconut extract. It gave the icing just a hint of coconut and was not overpowering. Try this recipe and hold on to it.

This cake gets rave reviews every time I make it. Then I give the recipe to everyone at the party and THEY make the cake - and then THEY in turn are asked for the recipe. 1 can of Coco Lopez is fine for the cake and frosting. Just scrape out the little bit left from the can into the frosting. This will also keep the frosting from becoming too runny and unwieldy.

OMG! This is the best cake I've ever made. It's soooo moist and melt in your mouth delicious. I'm not a fan of cream cheese frosting, so I went with a quick vanilla butter cream and covered it with an unsweetened shredded coconut. It's a little rich, but absolutely phenomenal.

I thought this cake was delicious. The coconut taste in the cake part is subtle and when paired with the frosting and shredded coconut is lovely. I read reviews who said this cake is like pound cake (which it isn't, it has a nice fine crumb). I'm no baking expert, but I am pretty sure you beat the tar out of your egg whites while folding them in the batter. GENTLY fold the whites in until barely mixed. I used 2 9x2" pans plus three ramekins for extra batter. Ramekins were done in 20 minutes, cakes in 30 minutes.Also, I used my own much less sweet cream cheese frosting (2 pkg cheese, 1 c. confectioners sugar, 2 t. vanilla, plus a couple Tablespoons of extra Coco Lopez).

I actually made cupcakes from this recipe. I took another reviewer's advice and brushed the tops with the Coco Lopez-twice. It made a great sugary coating on the top. I added a layer of chocolate ganache, then a layer of almond buttercream, then sugared almonds. Just like a macaroon. The most decadent cupcake I ever had.And I had people begging me to make more. This will be be the only coconut cake recipe I will ever use.

A show stopper! Amazing when combined with the frosting from the "Tropical Carrot Cake with Coconut Cream Cheese Frosting Cake" on this site. Then covered with flaked coconut like my friend Pat suggested. (I didn't have any trouble using the 9 X 1 3/4 inch cake pans but others have.)

This cake has excellent flavor, beautiful presentation, is very dense and very very rich. I followed the recipe exactly, but used three 8" pans as suggested by others, and had no problems. I had to bake the cake two days prior to serving, so I froze the unfrosted layers and didn't totally thaw them before frosting which I think helped set the icing. I tinted the Coconut Cream Cheese Frosting (followed other reviewers suggestions)a very pale pink, then sprinkled coconut on the top only and around the base of the cake. I can make only a few very minor suggestions: perhaps use only a thin layer of frosting, the cake itself is very moist and dense and simply doesn't need much; and, cut it first into 1/4 cake sections, and then slice into flat 1/2 pieces instead of a wedge. Wedges are just too big. Everyone raved about this recipe, and I'll definitly make it again.

i paired this with the coconut buttercream recipe as suggested by some reviewers and it was DELICIOUS!. the cake was moist, not too sweet. i just ate it again this morning and it wasn't dry at all! i also added pineapple which worked great for the pineapple's tartness put together with the sweet creamy coconut was pure heaven.:D i also topped the cake with fat free whipcream and a sprinkle of toasted coconut pieces. it was GORGEOUS!

this was very moist and tasty, received excellent reviews from the family at mothers' day. baked in two 10" pans and still rose nicely and made a big two layer cake. toasted the coconut before sprinkling on top, this was nice finishing touch as it both added nice flavor and presented well. agree with other reviewers about frosting being too thin as written...used only 2T Coco Lopez and added about 1/3 cup more conf. sugar. I will definitely be making this again!

i made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday , he says his favorite cake is coconut. it was extremely well received. i think he actually said the word sublime. i thought it was pretty darn good too! i used coconut extract in both the cake and frosting and just finished the container of cream of coconut when i was making the frosting. to give it lots of coconut flavor. i was concerned that the cream cheese frosting would be odd with the coconut but it all comes together wonderfully.

I made this cake for a birthday party for a friend who used to live in Maui. It was a huge hit, so I made it about a week later and again it came out great. The second time I sifted the flour before measuring and the texture was lighter and more uniform. I also didn't have buttermilk, so I used 1/2 C regular milk with some vinegar in it and 1/2 C coconut milk. I used the coconut buttercream frosting also on Epicurious. I used a version of the filling in the Macadamia Nut praline coconut cake recipe, but used sesame seeds and crystalized ginger instead. Gave it a grounding earthy flavor with a little surprise of occasional spice and heat with the ginger. Great combo, everyone who has had my rendition tells me to open a cake shop!

Wowza! I made this cake for a friend. As I assembled it, I was a bit disappointed because the separate components didn't taste very coconut-y, but when I tasted it all together, it was wonderful. I did toast the shredded coconut, which I think makes a big difference. I don't actually like coconut, so I can't imagine how good it must taste to someone who does!! A couple of days later a friend of hers ate a piece of it and begged me to make it for her graduation cake! The frosting is a bit soft if you want something fancy looking, but if you're going to press the shredded coconut into it, it works fine, plus it tastes great.

Truly awesome cake. The cake was moist and rich with just a hint of coconut flavor. I had some cake flour that was about to expire, so I subbed 3 cups of cake flour for the 2-3/4 all purpose. I think the cake flour gave the cake a lighter texture. Another reviewer suggested using three 8 pans. I had three pans all prepped but after filling two, I decided there just wasnt enough batter for three pans. I ended up with two 8 rounds and 4 cupcakes. I took other reviewers advice and used the tropical carrot cake icing. Yum. Not too sweet and just a hint of coconut. The finished icing looked a little soft and I was afraid it might ooze off the cake, but it hung on like a trooper. Even after a few hours at room temperature the icing was still on the cake with no drips, oozing or slips. Great cake! Thanks for the recipe!

Just made for my fiance's birthday. It came out perfect! The only changes I made - I added 1 teaspoon of coconut extract and baked for exactly 35 minutes at 350 degrees, not the full 45 minutes that the recipe called for. I also suggest using the 15 oz can of cream of coconut, dividing it 10 oz. for the cake and 5 oz for the frosting. Of course the perfect frosting is the tropical carrot cake coconut cream cheese frosting - not too sweet, but just enough sweetness to compliment the cake. A wonderful dense and delicious cake that will be made again!!!

Excellent texture and flavor. I had to substitute the Coco Lopez with half & half, sweetened condensed milk, coconut milk, coconut extract and a little extra sugar but it turned out fantastic. Better the second day so make it a day ahead. Also loved the frosting, though I'm not a big frosting fan, though I did scrape off about half of it on my own piece nobody else did. Didn't do layers and this still worked well in a 9x13 pan.

I have made a lot of cakes over the years, but this one tops the list. I followed the recipe for the most part (I reduced the amount of sugar to the cake and frosting) and the results were fantastic. Regardless of what frosting you might use, the cake itself is unbeatable. Some reviewers indicated problems with the cream of coconut, but I think they must have used coconut milk, which is completely different, because the cake and frosting were flawless as far as I was concerned. I made this cake for a friend's birthday and everyone thought it was delicious. My friend took some of the leftovers to work and said people went crazy over it - he had never seen such a reaction before.

The cake is excellent. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to use a seven minute frosting that I flavored with coconut extract. I then topped it with shredded coconut.

I halved this recipe, as I wanted to make a little cake. It made the perfect amount of batter for a 6" x 3" round pan. I added about 2 t. of coconut extract, and it still isn't overwhelmingly coconutty. I also added some fresh dessicated coconut. I buy it frozen from the Indian food stores. I think the fresh coconut is so much better than the dried/sweetened, as it doesn't make the texture too heavy, but does add some nice flavour/texture. This cake was not like a pound cake for me, rather, it was light and fluffy--almost like air--with the perfect crumb. SO delicious and wonderful!

After having not made this for a few years, I decided to make it again for a dinner party and as I remebered, it was delicious! I only used a 1/4 cup coco lepez in the frosting but added slightly more sugar so it wouldn't be runny. I baked it exactly 45 minutes & it was perfect. Everyone loved it!

I made this cake for a school art auction and it went for $700! This cake is a KILLER. I think I might be bold enough to say that is this among my favorite cakes.

I recommend a tart curd to play off the sweetness of the cake - ginger lime and grapefruit are good ideas. Anyway, if you are looking for a different, exciting, and dangerously good cake this is it. Highly recommended

Cake was delicious. I am not good at cakes from scratch, but this cake was as tender and moist as promised (I did use cake flour, though and sifted it twice). Great for a birthday cake. It was not at all like a pound cake. Do watch cooking times as noted earlier. Also, do not under any circumstance bake this cake in 2 pans. You will have a mess in your oven (and possibly a small fire). Three 8" pans will be able to better handle the volume of batter. I had no problems with using the cream of coconut in the cake. As noted earlier, be careful you are not using coconut milk. Thanks to the earlier postings with the "real" restaurant frosting recipe. I did try adding a little cream of coconut, but beware: more than 2 Tablespoons of cream of coconut and the frosting will become grainy and separated. You may not want to use the whole 1/2 cup called for. The only way to remedy this problem would be adding more sugar, which would make it disgustingly sweet. My best advice: take your time, and take time to follow instructions. Don't be fooled: Any cake worth eating has been carefully and thoughtfully prepared. Fussiness comes with the territory. We're not making brownies here.

I made this cake for Easter Brunch, its the best!! But I substituted UNsweetened cream of coocnut becuase reviewers said it was too sweet. My cake was perfection. One guest commented that she wants to use it for her weddding cake! (Unsweetened coconut can be found in your international food isle...its used in thai cooking.) I lovethis cake!

I made this cake with no frosting after reading some of the reviews that described it as having a pound cake texture. That's a perfect description! The coconut flavor in the cake is only very faint, but the texture of this cake is out of this world delicious. I made it in a tube pan yesterday for a lunch party, glazed it with the remaining cream of coconut, and sprinkled it with toasted coconut. Next time I would just leave the cake alone. It's so delicious that anything else seems to attract attention away from it.

I made this cake as a 3 - 8" round tier cake w/ a buttercream icing (in the layers) and a whipped cream cheese frostin (store bought - gasp!) outside and it turned out excellent! It is a very moist, rich cake; indeed, a little slice goes a long way! I'll be making this cake again!

Rating: 4
It is definitely 4 forks for taste unless you want really strong coconut. Almost gave it 3 for fussiness. I followed the recipe exactly for the cake. I am not a big fan of cream cheese frosting so I substituted that. I also was concerned about the layer-sliding problem that others described, so I made a powdered sugar and butter frosting to put between the layers, and that added good stability. On the outside I used a whipped cream frosting with some of the extra cream of coconut. Thought this cake looked a little grainy and coarse when I looked at the rounds, but it was rich and moist and smooth. I agree with others that you need to start checking for doneness well before the minimum time in the recipe. I checked 5 minutes before that and it was already done. I was lucky it wasn't dry. The cake did not last long. I'm already looking for an excuse to make it again.

Made the following changes according to the advice of other reviewers: used cake flour (1 cup & 2 tb. for each cup of all-purp. called for), and sifted it before measuring; added 1 tsp. coconut extract; added 1/2 cup shredded coconut to the batter after the buttermilk. Baked for just thirty minutes, and froze layers for twenty minutes before frosting for less crumb trouble. The cake was moist, tasty, but could have been more coconut-y; next time, will add more vanilla and coconut extracts.

This frosting recipe is NOT from the cafe. Their recipe doesn't have coconut cream in it. It's a cream cheese/butter frosting. This cake is very dense and delicious. You only need a small sliver to satisfy your craving for something sweet!

Rating: 4
Very Yummy! I always make this with the "coconut buttercream" from this site. Once I made a mistake and added a whole can of cream of coconut, this made it even more rich and yummy, but too crumbly to ice easily, but so good. I also used this as the base of a 3 tier wedding cake (with a strawberry -orange filling). To make the stawberry orange filling in Feb., I cooked down frozen strawberries with added sugar, added a little orange liquer toward the end, and added gelatin. It was raved about forever, but I would never make it again as a wedding cake covered with fondant, too fragile to deal with easily, but boy was it good and pretty!!!

I made this as written for Easter, with just slight variations in the frosting (per other reviewers.) Rave reviews!! Pressed for time, made this as a birthday cake in a 9 x 13 pan. Still fantastic. As others have noted, this cake is very dense, so, thinking in terms of poundcake, I made several mini loaves (8 in total) from the basic recipe (but added 1 cup coconut to the batter.) No frosting, just a glaze with the remnants of Coco Lopez I had. Wonderful as a light dessert (or even for breakfast!)

To be fair, I am not a coconut cake fan. I decided to give this cake a chance after reading the reviews. I thought it was mediocre. The cake was too dense. The cream cheese taste of the icing overwhelmed the cake. I found myself scraping it off. Also, watch the cooking time closely. Mine was done in 30 minutes. I made the frosting the night before and it set up fine.

Really liked this cake as did our guests. Used unsweetened coconut milk and it was plenty sweet enough for us. Also made it with a different topping...one that my mom used for her "lazy daisy cake", and it was an excellent complement. Have made it a couple times and it's always popular. Yum!

I was expecting too much from this recipe with such wonderful reviews. The good news is the icing was excellent and the cake was really easy to make and it looked phenomenal! Bad news is it didn't taste as good as it looked. Dense is an understatement. So I gave it one fork for just so-so. If only it tasted as good as it looked....then the oohs and aaah's wouldn't have been reduced to "got milk?".

Insane! This is the quintessential coconut cake...crumby, light and the flavor...yummy, yummy is very well balanced. I converted it to cupcakes. They turned out beautifully; due to the high sugar content, be sure to grease the top of the muffin tin to prevent sticking. Cook time apx. 30 minutes. Has anyone tried adding shredded coconut to the cake batter? I will try this next time and post the results. I must say, it is criminal not to use the coconut cream cheese frosting recipe that accompanies the tropical carrot cake on this site. It is the lightest, most wonderful frosting ever. My ManMan, who isn't a cream cheese fan (or a frosting fan), commented on how delightfully light, fluffy and delicious the frosting was; he ate every crumb...coconut goodness w/o being excessively sweet. MmmMmmmMmm. So, so, so amazing. Enjoy!

This cake turned out very dense. I made it for Easter and several people said that they liked it and even my boyfriend ate it all and he dislikes coconut. However, I give it one fork because it was not moist or that tasty. Further, one of the guests at Easter who owns several successful restaurants in Los Angeles was less than impressed. It just doesn't seem worth the effort to bake it again.

First, a thank you to all the previous reviewers for your suggestions.

This cake is truly awesome! Too bad Bon Apetit changed the recipe for the frosting. There is no coconut in it; it's just a cream cheese frosting. The reason for the spring form pans is for easy removal. You could buy Wilton pans in any craft store and some supermarkets. If you find the cake gets very brown, it's due to the high sugar content in this recipe. This cake can be made in a larger single layer also. It makes a nice presentation for guests.

I made this cake for my neighbor's birthday during the summer because she loves coconut. Unfortunately, although the cake was moist and tender (I used cake flour with adjustments) its coconut flavor was too subtle for both our palates. Considering it has 1 cup of coconut cream, I was really expecting a punch of coconut, but it just turned out to be a jab. It was still a nice cake though and I would make it again.

Wonderful cake, moist with a strong coconut flavor that somehow manages to not be overwhelming. Even my husband, who hates coconut, liked it enough to get seconds. Next time, though, I'll put more frosting between layers. I couldn't get them to stick together quite right. Still, this cake tastes amazing, and I'll make it again.

This was easy to make and so delicious! I followed another cook's advice and added drained, crushed pinapple to the 1 cup frosting for the filling. This cooked a bit more quickly for me than usual. I would start checking at 35 min. This dessert goes into the permanent repetoire!

This cake is AWESOME and I'm not a huge coconut fan. I've have made it several times over the past few years and have been asked to share the recipe many times. I make it exactly as the recipe describes. Be sure to stir the Coco Lopez before measuring (it settles) and be sure to grease pans well - it always sticks a little but it's not a big deal. My only other recommendation is to be sure not to overbake the cake - start checking 10 minutes early.

What a fabulous cake! The cake itself is like a Sara Lee pound cake - dense and delicious. Make sure to grease your pans well! I followed the other reviewers' advice about adding 1/2 Tsp coconut extract and only 2 Tbs Coco Lopez to the frosting and the consistency and taste were great. I added a special flair to this cake by filling the layers with a super fast, delicious rum cream. Simply mix a 12oz container of Cool Whip, a small box of instant vanilla pudding, and 1/4 Cup of dark rum.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I made this cake for a bridal shower and everyone LOVED it. The cake is moist with just the right amount of coconut flavor. I used the cream cheese frosting recipe and my only recommendation is that you refrigerate the frosting before frosting the cake, it helps it to thicken and will cover better. I will definetly make this cake again!!!

I have spent years searching for the ultimate coconut layer cake recipe. This is the best I have found. Years ago I worked as a waitress in Florida at a restaurant chain calle The Ranch House.

In a word, HEAVEN! This is one of the best cakes I have ever made. It always gets compliments (it even got a compliment from a guy who hates dessert) and turns out fantastic every time. I had to do some searching the first time I went looking for the Coco Lopez but have since found it in numerous stores. I'd also keep an eye on the cooking time if you aren't well versed with your oven's temperature. I have tried out several different icings (even a chocolate cream cheese recipe) and they all work well. This will always be a regular in my house.

Lovely, and full of coconut flavor. It almost has the texture of a pound cake. I folded about a cup of sweetened flaked coconut into the cake batter and - based on previous reviews - eschewed the cream cheese frosting in favor of freshly whipped cream with a little cream of coconut, rum, and more flaked coconut folded in. I also brushed the cake layers with rum before assembling the cake and sprinkled toasted coconut on top of the whole thing. And the other reviewers are right about watching the baking time very closely: My layers were perfectly done at 30 minutes.

This was the best cake I have ever made! I didn't have the coconut cream so I took a chance and used half coconut milk and half heavy cream. I also added a half teaspoon of coconut extract to the batter and a quater teaspoon to the frosting. Man, this is one good cake! I served it with strawberries and coconut sorbet. I was worshipped by our guests who all went home with extra pieces...they were very hard to part with... the pieces of cake, not the guests... ha, ha!

Although I read all the reviews and was a little afraid to make this cake, I made it for a dinner party, with some minor changes, and thought it was the best cake I have ever made!! Beautiful and delicious -- a tower of coconut. I used cake flour instead of regular flour (with proper adjustments), and added 1/2 t. coconut extract to batter. As for the frosting, I only used about 2 T. cream of coconut and put in 1/2 t. coconut extract, and the consistency and flavor turned out perfectly. 1/2 c. would be far too much. This fulfills all of my coconut fantasies!

What a coincidence! I live very close to the restaurant that Bon Appetit got this recipe from and this has been my favorite coconut cake for years. I finally mustered the courage to ask 'Shubox' for the recipe and they gladly gave it to me and said it was featured in Bon Appetit. I was thrilled. There were a few differences in the copy I got and the one on this website, though. For instance, their version said I needed 2 spring form pans which I didn't have. So I went out and bought them ($40 each from William Sonoma) just for this recipe. Frankly, I couldn't tell the difference from these cake layers and others I've made from my regular cake pans. It was an expensive lesson. Does anyone know how spring form pans would contribute to this type of recipe? Anyway, the cake was still very good. There were other slight differences in the copy the restuarant gave me so I'm going to try the version that's on this site to see if it tastes any different. I'll also use my regular 9" cake pans. I loved the icing and it was very thick and easy to spread. I'm very happy to have this cake in my recipe files.

I had a little trouble with this recipe. Based on other reviews, I watched the timing closely since most said it baked in about 30 minutes. My cake at 30 minutes was getting pretty brown around the outsides of the pan, but the center was not done. I baked another 5 minutes and took it out. The cake was moist, but darker brown than I would have liked. Next time I will lower the oven temperature. The icing was fairly loose, but I made the icing, then refrigerated it before proceeding. It held up during the icing process, but started getting very loose towards the end when I was icing the sides. I toasted the coconut which added a nice flavor. I enjoyed it, but I noticed two of the six people I served it to for dessert didn't finish it even though they said it was good --- they might have thought the icing was a little sweet. I will try this again.

There is no measurement given on how much of the Coco Lopez to put in! I just winged it and put in half the can. I put the other half in the frosting but I know that was wrong because it turned out too runny. Next time I'll put more in the cake and less in the frosting. Otherwise, a pretty good cake, and not too difficult.

This was a very good cake, but I was a bit disappointed that Coco Lopez is laden with preservatives (I mean LADEN). I think I might take the advice of another rater and reduce coconut milk and sugar until it is thick and goopy to use as a replacement. I would love to make this cake again, but I'll definitely go a more "natural" route next time. Instead of sweetened coconut, I'm going to try using fresh coconut. I agree that the cake is very dense (even denser the next day), but it still was very moist. Good recipe, but could be better.

I did what one other reviewer suggested after reading about the various takes on the icing.

I followed this recipe exactly and the cake was awesome. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers, the frosting was a little on the liquidy side and I used coconut cream and not coconut milk. The frosting firmed up after I put it in the fridge and added a wonderful tangy taste to the cake. I think this would also work as a bundt cake with a simple glaze of coco lopez coconut cream, a touch of rum and a little sweetened condensed milk. I would poke a few holes and drizzle the glaze on top. Just a note, watch the timing for baking this cake because I found that mine cooked a lot faster than the 45 minutes that was suggested. All in all this is a great cake and I will definitely make it again.

Although I haven't tasted the cake completely with the frosting yet I can tell that this is a winner! (I tasted part of the cake that stuck to the waxed paper cake rounds and tasted the frosting with the coconut while I was frosting the cake.) Based on other reviews I used a different cream cheese frosting recipe. I used the White Chocolate Cream Cheese Buttercream frosting in Rose Levy Beranbaum's The Cake Bible cookbook. (Slowly melt 3 3-oz. bars of white chocolate in the microwave. Let cool. Beat 12 ozs. softened cream cheese and to this add the cooled chocolate. Beat in 3/4 cup softened unsalted butter and 1 1/2 Tbsp. lemon juice and you are finished! Delicious frosting) I'm sure I'll be making this cake again.

Really great cake. Accidentally I brought coconut milk instead of coconut cream. To remedy, I boiled the coconut milk until reduced by half with some sugar and Cruzan coconut rum and the flavor was amazing. My frosting was not runny, and the tang of the cream cheese contrasted wonderfully with the sweetness of the coconut cake. I also added some coconut flavor to the cake. And finally, I cooked some canned crushed pineapple with more coconut flavored rum and mixed with the portion of frosting for the cake filling. It was really really yummy! My only problem was that the cake, while extremely moist, was quite dense. Any suggestions on lightening it up?

A nice overall taste to this cake. I did like the cook below and used Coconut Extract to add more coconut flavor to the cake. I used my own cream cheese frosting recipe. Next time I would not use all of the batter for the two 9-inch pans. I thought the cake was a bit too high.

I've made this twice and both times received raves about how moist the cake was. I don't care for flaked coconut so I always leave it out. After my first attempt, I decided the result didn't have enough coconut flavor. The second time I replaced the vanilla flavoring with coconut flavoring. This gave the flavor a good boost, but I think I will increase the amount next time. I didn't think the frosting was sweet enough, so I added an extra cup of powdered sugar. Even with that extra amount, I still needed to refrigerate the frosting for more than an hour before spreading. I also discovered that putting a piece of cake in the microwave for 10 seconds, warmed up the cake without melting the frosting and made the cake twice as good.

I have made this cake at least 3 times. It's even a hit with non-coconut lovers. I thought it was a little dense, so the last couple times I have sifted the flour first and then measured it out. Also, I cut it into a four layer cake and frosted between layers (this helped to lighten it up too). I had to watch my cook time, it might be that my oven just runs hot. After the first time (it was a little overdone), I have been pulling them out quite early - as soon as the toothpick is clean.

My bookkeeper made this cake and brought it to work for us to try. I own a bakery - and don't ever feel the urge to eat cake....BUT.....one bite of this and I had to be restrained from eating it all!! READ THE REVIEWS...sounds like the consensus is to refrigerate the frosting to thicken rather than to keep adding more sugar. I'm going to be selling this cake at my bakery very soon! FABULOUS!

I am from va so I was a little nervous about making this cake for the first time. It is a favorite here and I knew that they don't use cream cheese frosting. I used the cake recipe and substituted a boiled white frosting recipe for the cream cheese. I put 3 cups of frozed grated unsweetened cocount on top of the frosting. It was absolutely delicious and I don't even really like coconut that much. I used three 9 inch cake pans and my layers were about 1.25 inches high. Overall a wonderful cake!

This cake was excellent. It was moist and flavorful. An easy to follow recipe. The cream cheese frosting was great - not too sweet, but still added a wonder flavor to the cake.

Made this cake for my daughter's birthday party (she is a coconut fan). Everyone loved it. In fact, she continued to brag about this cake to her friends for at least a week. The cake itself was wonderfully moist and the cream cheese icing went surprisingly well with the cake - although I found it impossible to use the entire 4 cups of shredded coconut for the frosting. Also, unlike other reviewers (regarding the frosting) - mine set up just fine and I had no problems with it being runny.

Based on all the reviews I made this for Easter. The frosting was very good as is, and while the cake was flavorful it did turn out to be way too dense. But I do think it has great potential, and will try it again.

I read some of the reviews and was a little skeptical at first, but the reviewer who noted that you should not believe everything you read... This cake was wonderful. It was a perfect finisher for our Easter dinner.

I didn't rate this cake because I made a BIG error. I overbaked it! I checked after 40 minutes (no-no) and nearly died. The outside was hard and dry. It seemed that it would have been very dense and moist if I had PAID ATTENTION! So I'll give it another go and watch VERY, VERY, closely.

This was a great recipie. I got nothing but raves from anyone who tasted it. The cake it extremely tender and delicious and I thought the icing was perfect. Got lots of compliments on that. I made it EXACTLY as is - which means, COCONUT CREAM. It is NOT liquidy. If your "coconut cream" is liquidy, either it has separated (still ok) and you should mix it before adding to the recipie (this will produce a gel-textured substance) OR you have bought coconut milk. If you live in a state like VA where liquor isn't sold in grocery stores but in ABC stores, your local Asian of Hispanic market carries coconut cream.

Has any one tried the "Coconut Cake Halekulani" recipe from Gourmet? Its not on this website. I have made it several times--it is incredible. I double the recipe instead of splitting the layers for a taller cake.

I carefully reviewed the reviews before attempting this recipe! Not being a lover of cream cheese frosting, I decided to go "off the board" and make my family recipe of "stay soft icing" (vanilla icing) which is always a crowd pleaser (email me if you would like this recipe). The comments at my party were the same: "the best coconut cake ever!". I had no troubles with the cake making. I think other reviewers were right, make sure you buy cream of coconut, not the milk counterpart. I also recommend you do not overmix at any point, and carefully watch in the oven, removing as soon as it is done. I also toasted coconut for decoration on the top and around the bottom edge of the cake and it was stunning in appearance!

I have made this cake 3 times in the last year. The first time, it was delicious, but the frosting was too runny. The second time, I had the cake was too dense, but the frosting was fine. I just made the frosting a day ahead, and it had stiffened up sufficiently to spread evenly. The third time, my friends raved! I made sure that my baking powder and baking soda were fresh, which I think is the density issue. The cake is already heavy, and with expired or almost expired leaveners, that leaves the cake flat. The frosting I made with the suggestions of some other cooks to start with a lower amount of the coconut cream in the frosting. I had used about 1/4 cup when it was perfect. It's also important to refrigerate the cake, and to take it out the recommended 2 hours before serving. Hope this info helps you taste a fabulous cake.

I made this for Christmas eve dinner and everyone loved it! Followed the recipe exactly and it was dense and wonderful. The frosting was great and very easy to work with. Keeps well.

I tried this recipe and thought it was delicious; however, the layers came out much too dense. Did anyone else have this problem? I thought the frosting was delicious, too, but next time I might decrease the amount of cream cheese to reduce a little of the "tangy" taste.

I made this for the company pitch-in, and got so many compliments, which is always uplifting. Just terrific cake. I didn't use this cream cheese icing, but another one I had. I liked the denseness of the cake especially well. My mom used to tint coconut green for wreath cookies - I wonder if that would make this more Christmassy? Or possibly too cutesy.

This cake was such an overwhelming hit at Thanksgiving that my family asked me to bake another one before the weekend was over. My grandmother was famous for her coconut cake, but unfortunately she never used a recipe and her secret passed away with her. This recipe captures the moistness sweetness of her cake. Make it with the cream cheese icing - using cream of coconut (not milk) works well. Or, change the icing slightly by using one whole box of sugar instead of 2 cups, and one bar of cream cheese instead of 2 8 oz bars (this will make the icing even thicker)

I have made this cake 15 to 20 times. Let me share with you how to make it better. I never divide the cake into two pans before baking. Put it in one 9 or 10 inch pan and bake till down. Remove from oven and cool 10 to 15 minutes. Make about 15 to 20 insertions into the cake with a utility knife and slowly pour 1/2 stick melted butter and 2 T. Grand Marnier until it soaks into cake. Let cool. Then slice the cake to make layers. Frost and your a hit! This cake will become one of your favorites. See my complete recipe on foodelitist.com after the Holidays.

Easy, Easy and Easy... I made this for a romantic dinner (my boyfriend must have dessert after a meal!) and it was a hit, no only with him, but with his friends and their wives! I agree with most of the other cooks - the cream cheese frosting tends to overpower the cake and its very sweet. The second time around I made my own frosting and it was delicious. I'm making it for thanksgiving this year!

I took this receipe to a fish-fry. Everyone loved it. I was only able to sneak a small taste. It was so moist. I will make again and again. However, I had difficulty slicing the cake, it crumbled a little. People ate the crumbs and licked there fingers. They did not mind one bit. I used my own cream cheese icing receipe. And I put crushed pineapple between layers (drain liquid) This was the best cake I have ever eaten.

A nice cake ... liked it a lot, didn't love it. It's a very filling number. I must comment on this frosting ... I don't understand why so many "cooks" here had problems with it? I was chuckling to myself as I was whipping it together ... the cream cheese, the butter, the thick gel-like cream of coconut and the powdered sugar. How could anyone get anything "liquidy" from those ingredients? It was one of the thickest frostings I've ever had the pleasure of frosting a cake with! I have a feeling those negative comments were coming from people who used "coconut milk" instead of "cream of coconut" ... a big difference! To all people contemplating making this cake ... don't worry about the frosting. It's as thick as can be if you use the correct ingredients!

The cake itself can't be beat. It's truly marvelous. But (like other raters) I felt the frosting was a bit too "cream-cheesy" -- which overwhelmed the cake. I think when I make this again I'll try a different frosting -- but I definitely WILL make this recipe again!

Made this for my husband, a coconut fan. Couldn't find the Coco Lopez so I used plain canned coconut milk I reduced a little and added sugar. It tasted okay. We both thought the frosting was way too tangy and overwhelmed the taste of the cake. Want to try it again with real coco lopez and a plainer frosting. It would make a nice cake for a special anniversary since it's white.

I made this cake for my Mom's birthday and everyone loved it. I can't believe how moist it stayed for a couple of days after her birthday. I too, agree the frosting is to sweet and I just a pinch of salt to cut the sweetness. I also found that refrigerating the frosting a couple of hours before spreading it on the cake made it easier to handle.

This cake was INCREDIBLE! I made it for my fiancee's birthday party & it was a huge hit. The cream of coconut made it wonderfully moist. I can't wait for another occasion to make this again.

I thought the cake was incredibly tastey and moist. The frosting was very sweet. I did not use the shredded coconut as this was for my son's birthday party and not all kids like the coconut texture. I decorated the top with candy, making a railroad and forest. It was a real hit!

This is really a beautiful, delicious cake. A real show stopper. Easy to make, great consistency and texture. Frosting came out perfect. Presented either recommended or with the addition fresh flowers (pansies) placed on the top of the cake make it a definite winner.

Mother said this was the best coconut cake she has eaten. My entire family was impressed. Everything in the recipe worked perfect for me. In fact it was also one of the best looking cakes I have made. I would like to try the recipe with white fluffy icing to taste the wonderful delicate essences in the cake - I kept trying to eat bites without icing and usually I need icing with any cake.

I made this cake for my Dads birthday and my family really liked it. I'm from Australia and wasn't able to get sweetened cream of coconut so I used coconut cream (used in Thai curries) I'm not sure if this is similar but it worked great. I also used only 1 tbspn of coconut cream in frosting but I mashed in the pulp of one mango and it made a yummy mango frosting. I also put some passionfruit on the top and the flavours blended beautifully. I will definately make this again.

The best coconut cake I've tried;very moist and tender. Since I was afraid the frosting would make it too sweet I only used half the cream cheese frosting for the layers and covered it with whipping cream and a little bit of the coco lopez,turned out great;friends loved it!

Excellent moist coconut cake. I chilled the frosting overnight before assembling, so I did not think it was too runny. My frosting job got a bit messy with crumbs falling off the cake, but it looks great when you cover it all up with coconut. The frosting is delicious.

I made this ckae the first time for a New Year's Eve party and it was so beautiful, no one would cut the first piece. Once it was cut , the reviews were unanimous- the best coconut cake ever! It was excellent and beautiful. I made it again a few weeks later with the same results.

I made this cake for my twin sisters' 40th birthday. I only used 1/4 cup of Coco Lepez in the frosting because I didn't want it coming out too sweet. I thought the cake was okay but my sister took the leftover cake to her co-workers at the United Way and they loved it! She said it disappeared very quickly and that a lot of people asked for the recipe.

Absolute perfection. The cake is moist and not airy. It has the same texture as Red Velvet Cake. Couldn't get enough of the frosting. It may be a little soft, but not much. Everything about it was perfection.

This was a great cake. I agree with the other reviewers - the frosting was too runny. I used almost 2 pounds of powdered sugar - still runny but spreadable but the frosting was WAY WAY to sweet. When you make the frosting don't dump all the coconut milk in-use only to thin the frosting. Make a pina colada with the rest.

I made this recipe for Christmas as my dad loves anything coconut...then I left it at my house. So when we returned, I froze the frosted cake and served it on New Years Day. It was a big hit, would easily serve 15 people. My big concern with the cake was the ingredients, which aren't exactly low cal, low cholesterol. However, in moderation, it'd be OK.

This cake was absolutely delicious!! It was sooo moist and got rave reviews when I brought it to work for a birthday. I agree that the frosting was a little too soft; since I will definitely be making it again, next time I will experiment with the frosting ingredients to get better results. Definitely a keeper. YUM!

The frosting was runny and the cake bland. The cake was tolerable, but not indicative of the level of effort.

Rating: 4
Definitely a cake for the family recipe box. Truly everything the classic coconut layer cake should be. The cream cheese frosting that is recommended calls for too much liquid and should be reduced to 3 or 4 tablespoons, not 1/2 cup. I added a pound of powdered sugar and it was still very thin. Tasted great though!

This cake was FABULOUS!! It caught my eye because my father loves anything with coconut. The cake was moist & the frosting was delious. I made the frosting ahead of time and refrigerated it; made it easier to work with. It was a hit & received rave reviews!!
