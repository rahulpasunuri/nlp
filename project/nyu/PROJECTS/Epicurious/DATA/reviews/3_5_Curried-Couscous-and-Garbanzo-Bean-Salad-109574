I used Pearl Couscous, and 10 oz was WAY TOO MUCH! Like other reviewers, I roasted the veggies first (carrots, cauliflower, and zucchini)and they are delish! I used rice wine vinegar instead of white. This recipe made way too much dressing, and I had to spill some of it out. I also squeezed some fresh lemon juice on top of the salad once it was done.

I have been making this recipe for over 4 years and think it's absolutely amazing. The original recipe is excellent as is but can easily be added to: I now add an extra tsp. of garam marsala to it. Over the years I have increased the veggies substantially: 1 lb baby carrots, 1 head cauliflower, and 1 lb. peas.

So easy to make and so delicious - a terrific main dish as part of a vegetarian meal. I served this with Indian-Spiced Potato Salad, Moroccan-Spiced Cold Tomato Soup, some flatbread, and fruit salad for dessert. It was a great hot-weather meal.

Pretty good salad. Great way to use of leftover vegetables.

I really like this salad. I read some of the other reviews and made some changes. I made the couscous with chicken broth, added dried cranberries and the scallions as the broth boiled, then added the couscous and covered to cook for the five minutes. Meanwhile I cut up carrots into match sticks, cut up cauliflower into mini florets, stirred with the curry powder, kosher salt and olive oil and roasted in the oven. I added nonfat feta (6 oz, though, not 10 oz) to the garbanzo beans along with champagne vinegar (really yummy!), a bit more olive oil, ginger, golden raisins and slivered almonds. Stirred everything together. I had it warm, but like it much better after letting it all sit in the fridge overnight. I'll definitely make this again.

I have made this many times and have come up with the following changes to make a lighter and tastier salad... I only use 1/4 cup of olive oil, add a little extra ginger, added juice of 1 lemon, chopped parsley and use Israeli couscous... It is delicious!

Delightful. We ate it warm, sans feta, so we subbed some toasted pine nuts for a little extra depth and punch. I was concerned that 2 tbsp. curry powder was too much, but the pasta absorbs it nicely. We subbed chopped red onion for the green onion per another cook, and were pleased. We thought 5 tbsp. of (good quality) white wine vinegar was perfect. I believe the bitterness other cooks have observed may be due to overtoasted curry. Curry has ingredients which may turn bitter upon heating, including garlic and ginger, so toast carefully. You're not going for your dark brown breakfast toast color, but a modest color change. If you have a good sniffer, trust it, and pull the pan off the heat at the first whiff of bitterness. I toasted the curry in a small cast iron skillet, rather than the saucepan the pasta cooked in, because I used melted frozen broth (instead of water) in the saucepan. Cast iron provides the ultimate control for pan-toasting, so that might help. Hubby says this is "definitely a keeper," his highest praise to date. I liked that the liquid used to "boil" the vegetables was also used for the cous cous, so none of the nutrients went to waste. We both appreciated that the salad provided both the vegetable and starch for our meal.

I wish I'd read the reviews carefully before making this-- almost everyone who seems to like this recipe also seems to have altered it dramatically. I made it exactly as written and it tastes very odd. Several cooks recommend rice wine vinegar; perhaps that would help. I felt like the ginger was mixing badly with other ingredients-- the dish was bitter and uninviting and yet also bland. I love all the ingredients but they do not work well in this recipe.

I really thought this was great. I cant stand people who change the recipe and then rate it, but I had to make a variation and I do think the original recipe would have been just as good. I didnt use curry powder (was out and didnt realize it til 20 min before dinner)so I used garam masala, a little turmeric and cayenne. Red bell peppers, carrots, no feta (hubby hates it) and lemon juice instead of white vin. Served with tandoori spices chicken breasts with a yogurt/lime/mint sauce and we wolfed it down. Very yummy.

Made it for friends to serve with the Moroccan Lemon Chicken. We all loved it. I made the coucous first and let it cool. I only used shredded carrots, which I did not cook. Instead I made a raw carrot salad with cranberries, almonds, golden raisins, garbanzo beans, feta and sliced green onions, rice wine vinegar (instead of white wine vinegar). Next time I will use red onion instead of green onions. I put it in the fridge for 2-3 hours. And, then mixed in the couscous and served at room temperature. The curry from the couscous went very well with the carrot salad. A great make ahead side dish!

This was nice and simple comfort food (I ate it warm). I also threw in some chopped black olives and some snow peas which added a little more color. I used half white wine vinegar and half rice vinegar just because of what I had around, but I don't think using one versus the other would have made much of a difference.

I used rice vinegar and some lemon, and added some extra olive oil. The textures were very nice - I had to cook the vegetables quite a bit longer than suggested, probably because I cut them larger than were used to create the recipe. This dish does not have a huge amount of flavor but is a nice complementary dish for a neo-Indian meal. I did enjoy the feta and green onion toppings.

This was good. I made it first with white vinegar and then the next time, I used rice vinegar, much, much better, not as bitter with the Rice wine vinegar!!

Next time I will substitute the vinegar with lemon and see how it goes. It's nice but didn't fall off my seat. Nothing exceptional.

Word up to my homie, Amanda in Winnipeg. I made this recipe exactly as written. It was easy, nutritious, inexpensive, and tasted pretty great.

I loved this recipe and so did my boyfriend. Great for vegetarians. The feta was a unique touch that worked well (make sure to add it only when the dish is cooler so it doesn't melt). I look forward to making this for friends sometime soon.

Delicious, but I think it tastes better with golden raisins and pinenuts.

Though this recipe has all the ingredients I love, the taste was below average. Perhpas extra dressing would help if you are set on trying it but I won't bother.

Just made this salad for a dinner this evening to compliment portabella mushrooms stuffed with goat cheese & hot sausage. I did not add the veetables, perhaps next time when not in a hurry. I added more vinegar, oil & water; couscous was dry. My spice was 1 tbsp curry & 1 tbsp garam masala and 1 cup of raisins. Great!

I have made this several times for guests and everyone liked it. Even my husband who says that he hates vegetables, couscous, and curry liked it. I made it as a side dish (served with chicken, pork, and seafood marinated in Moroccan herb rub) and it definitely serves more than 6. I added a bit of fresh parsley.

I definitely agree with previous comments about the chilli powder. This is key and is best then you make it yourself (I'm a fan of dry roasting my seeds and then grinding them in a mortar and pestil for fullest flavor). I also agree with trying a little sweeter vinegar to cut the bitter taste just a little bit. This went over very well a dinner party with people who were not familiar with couscous

This was fantastic! I have already made it twice and look forward to the next time! I couldn't find couscous here so I used small grain shaped pasta instead and added more water. It worked well. We used iceberge lettuce as wraps and that was the finishing touch. Enjoy!

Great weeknight recipe: quick, healthy, tasty, and makes leftovers for lunch. We're not big on cauliflower, so I used zuchini instead. Cut back on the oil and vinegar as it seemed like a lot, used just over 1/4c oil and just under 1/4 vinegar.

This was a good recipe. I added more vinegar, salt and pepper to enhance the flavors. And believe it or not, I perfer it warmed. Yummy!

This is a very simple to make recipe that goes very well with a lot of things. I have made twice with two different curry powders and this makes a huge difference. Be careful which curry powder you use or make your own.

This is a summer staple in our household. Good curry powder is key; I've had the best results with Penzey's brand. I also substitute canned broth (chicken or veggie) for the water, and use rice vinegar instead of white vinegar. The broth adds more oomph to the couscous, while the rice vinegar is sweeter and less acidic than white vinegar.

YUM! Used whole wheat couscous, otherwise stuck to receipe. It was an excellent, fun side dish.

This is a very versatile dish. I've made it several times for vegetarian friends with rave reviews. It makes for a terrific potluck dish, or I serve it with grilled chicken for an easy one-dish dinner.

I've made this twice - we love it! Good curry powder may be the key (?) I use a bag of pre-washed carrots, brocolli and cauliflower cut into small pieces, which makes this even easier. Also, whole wheat couscous works great.

I had high hope for a nice vegi dish but it was very bitter and blah.
