I added a chopped bell pepper, some roughly chopped basil, and some feta. I halved the olive oil and doubled the mustard. Balsamic might be nice in place of the red wine vinegar!

This salad is simple to make, but once completed, divine to taste. Grow tomatoes in your backyard and this would give you another reason to enjoy the fruits of your labor. A halved red onion, finely sliced, has to be added though to get the full extent of the flavors and tastes. Recommended!

This recipe has become a staple in my house because it's delicious and the fixings for the dressing are always on hand. And even if the only fresh vegetables I have in the house are tomatoes, I can still make a great, fresh side dish. I've used the same recipe with regular vine ripe tomatoes when heirlooms aren't in season. I recommend adding a little bit of very thinly sliced red onion. Add blue cheese or shaved parmesan if you like. And you can try champagne vinegar for a milder flavor if red wine vinegar isn't your thing. Try it and play around with it. It's a great dish to add to your arsenal.

This dressing was awful! I found the red wine vinegar and the dijon made this so bitter and acidic that we didn't even use it. I just drizzled the heirlooms with a bit of rich balsamic, olive oil, S&P, and a bit of torn basil. Perfect.

Excellent, simple but great flavors. I used Cherokee Purple heirlooms and yellow strips. I recommend using a very high quality olive oil and whisk it in very slowly in a steady stream - that shoudl cure the "too oily" problem.

Instantaneous and delicious. This is so easy and basic but with the right heirloom tomatoes, it's the best recipe I've found yet to let their flavor really come through. Per Brennan's suggestion, I added chopped shallot, which I let sit in the red wine vinegar to mellow. Yum!

This is good. I like this dish because it's so easy-all the ingredients are in my panty. I just use fresh tomatos from my garden.

Simply refreshing. Try adding some chopped onion and yellow pepper for some variety. Very nice summer dish.

The taste of the tomatoes would have been amazing if a little less olive oil had been used. The taste of the olive oil was a little over-bearing. Maybe an 1/8 of a cup instead of a 1/4.

This is a really simple recipe and good, but the dressing was a bit bland...I would add more dijon mustard to kick it up a bit...I did add some crumbled goat cheese...Yum
