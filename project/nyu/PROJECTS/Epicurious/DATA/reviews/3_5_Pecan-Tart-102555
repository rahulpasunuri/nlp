To the cook in Strtasbourg, France: If you e-mail me your address to jengoldenberg@hotmail.com I will mail you some corn syrup and some canadian maple syrup which is also wonderful in pecan pies.

I hate to be in the minority, but I just did not think this was very good. We love pecans and have tested may pecan pie recipes-this one ranks really low in our opinion. I'd keep searching!

this is impossible for to make . corn syrup does not exist in france. That is ever frustrating. can I substitute it for honey ? Or will it mess up the caramel? i have a feeling it wouldn' work and I love pecan pie, or at least my memories of it... ever frustrating...

This is an excellent recipe. I've made this tart every thanksgiving since 1999. I would give it 4 forks, however, the pastry dough listed for this receipe is very difficult to work with. I use a pie dough receipe from Cook's Illstrated and it comes out great.

iv seen much simpler recipes for this same thing..no cooking over the stove required..I wont go into detail though..but I will say toast your pecans..for 7min in a 350 degree oven...and brown your butter...gives it a nutty flavor..I like other reviews used a combo of maple syrup and both light and dark kayro..and I cut back on the sugar ..and just another sm. suggestion..go to wolfgangpuck.com..he has a sugar dough recipe that is to die for..try it! I also used part of his pecan tart/pie recipe...u dont have to pre cook it after all!!!

Flavor was terrific and everyone loved this as Thanksgiving dessert. My only complaint is that I found the recommended method for caramelizing the sugar difficult - I ended up with chunks of crystals. I've seen other recipes that recommend adding a bit of water to sugar to have consistency of wet sand - also adding something acidic helps to prevent recrystalization. Any additional tips on carmelizing sugar would help the less experienced cook.

Excellent!! A very simple and elegant dessert. Easy because it doesn't require hours of cool down time. I used 1/4 cup maple syrup, 1/4 cup dark corn syrup, and 1/2 cup light corn syrup for extra flavor. I also doubled the lemon juice recommendation. I brought it to a thanksgiving dinner party and it was a huge hit. Will be an annual tradition for sure!!!

This is the second time I've made this great tart. I used a ready made crust and it turns out just beautiful. I use 3/4 cup of dark corn syrup and 1/4 cup of maple syrup for added flavor. I also mix pecans and walnuts together for a different taste, either way it is easy and makes a wonderful addition to any dinner.

I will never make another pecan pie. This was much better.
