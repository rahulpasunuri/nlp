Did not love it, and prepared it exactly as directed. Regardless of my perhaps misuided expectatons, this is still not a coherent dish. If you at all expected any sort of Asian element to this recipe due to the mention of shiitakes, let me disabuse you of that notion now. It ended up being more quasi-Mediterranean than anything else, but with the tomatoes totally overpowering the delicacy of the mushrooms. The root veg, alongside the barley, just confused me. If you are looking for a Medi-style stew, by all means proceed, perhaps with the addition of a few peppers and more mushrooms. Myself, I am going to adapt this with an Asian influence, with a combo of strained dashi and beef stock as a base and dashes of brown rice vinegar and sesame oil, plus plenty of mushrooms and an array of green veg toward the end. To each his/her own. Two points for giving me an idea for something else.

It turned out well. I deleted the parsnips, added carrots instead, added two whole minced jalapeños, used roasted tomatoes, and almost doubled the garlic and barley. I also added thyme and a few bay leaves. I used the mushroom water and beef stock for 1/2 the fluid to replace water. I drizzled a little Sriracha over my serving at the end, and ate it with toasted pumpernickel. I didn't have lemon/parsley around but was thinking it would be good with a little gremolata.

I can't really comment on the recipe itself, because I made SO many changes that I basically created a whole new recipe. However, my suggestion for the recipe as-is to cook it stovetop instead of in a slow-cooker. It only took about an hour... the broth reduces and thickens, the flavors meld, and even a basic soup like this one turns out wonderful. I also added a dash of ground chipotle powder; it gave it an earthy kick.

After reading the other reviews, I decided to substitute beef broth and the mushroom-soaking water for the plain old water the recipe calls for. I also added 5 fresh cremini mushrooms, to add even more flavour! The soup turned out delicious. If the recipe had called for beef broth instead of water, it would merit 4 forks.

This was just o.k., fairly bland. A very basic recipe with one note of flavor. I followed recipe except for using half water, half beef stock for the liquid. The shitakes definitely add a meaty richness, but this could use some herbs or spices to add more flavor.

This is definitely a keeper. I used beef broth instead of water as others suggested. Also, before adding the broth, I used it to deglaze the pan I seared the meat and cooked the veggies in. I then added the liquid into the slow cooker. Also used the water from the mushrooms in the slow cooker. Tip: Permit an hour prep time if you use leeks that need a thorough washing. Next time I'll get it ready the night before.

Really nice winter soup. I cannot help but combine different recipes though! I used beef broth instead of water and added the soaking water from the shitakes. I cut the amount of tomatoes in half (although a full can would be fine), used carrots, celery and onion, and about 1/4 tsp. each thyme and marjoram. I could only find beef baby back ribs. Put in fresh porcinis at the very end. I got a very nice soupy consistency with rich flavor.

Used leftover prime rib bones w/plenty of meat on 'em, carrots instead of parsnips, used about double pot (vs. pearl) barley that I pre-soaked for a couple of hours. Added both barley-soaking and mushroom-soaking liquid along with beef stock instead of water. Cooked on stove for about 1.5 hr. Yum.

I followed some of the suggested changes in earlier reviews: carrots for turnips (more kid-friendly) and porcinis for shiitake (mainly grocery availability), and the red wine vinegar. I thought the mushroom component of the stock was just right with the porcinis, having discarded most of the mushroom water. A few splashes of red wine vinegar at the end gave it a real nice bright flavor. The whole family gave it 4 forks, no minor feat with our picky 3-yr old! Can't wait to try it with shiitakes next time. We might go up to 3/4 cup on the barley too for a sturdier soup.

I made a few changes based on other reviews. I took off the stems of the dried mushrooms before I soaked them and I used the liquid in the soup for added flavor. I used carrots instead of parsnips and no green beans. I cut back the water by 2 cups and added 1 cup chicken broth to the mushroom liquid. I also used a small shoulder london broil along with asmall beef shank for extra meat. Yum! Yum! Will make again and again.

I thank the other reviewers for their advice. I added half beef broth / half water, doubled the mushrooms using both porcini and shitake, used parsnips, turnips and swedes rather than just parsnips, and lastly some red wine. Perfecto!!

This is one of our favorite soups, with slight modifications. We substitute carrots for parsnips (don't like them) and use beef broth and mushroom water for plain water. Makes a big difference! The mushrooms make the recipe!

I thought this was a little bland. I was expecting more of a rich mushroomy flavor. I will try it again, but will use beef broth and will probably saute the mushrooms to bring out the flavor.

Too tomato-flavoured for me. I was expecting a rich beef and mushroom flavour but the tomato overwhelmed it completely.

Good basic soup, I used leftover prime rib bones and meat instead of the beef shank. Also substituted carrots, flat parsley and onion for the leeks and parsnips, and beef broth in addition to the shiitake mushroom water...cooked it in a pot on the stove for an hour or so, it was very tasty and delicious!

This is part of my fall/winter repertoire. I make adjustments all the time: stock instead of water, ruabaga instead of parsnips, add red wine, use dried porcinis, add a can of navy beans. Lovely, fun and filling for the long, dark Nordic nights.

This was good but not great. The overall taste was bland although I liked the mix of ingrediants. Perhaps the addition of beef broth could improve the richness of the taste.

A delicious and easy soup. I love cooking with my crockpot, so I just had to try this. The shitake mushrooms are the key ingredient. They add such an earthy flavor!

Excellent soup! I used smoked beef shank and added more beef broth. I doubled the recipe and brought to work. Served with smoked cheddar, garlic cheese bread. Everthing was gone before lunch.

I make it more as a starter soup than a main. I cook the meat & mushroom in netting bags and after a couple of hours I puree the other vegtables, then add the barley. It gets raves from family and guests.
