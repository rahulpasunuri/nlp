Delicious. Can't wait to make it again. So simple, especially on a weeknight.

I really wanted to stick to the original recipe the first time. I thought we had all the ingredients, but discovered the kale was past edible stage. Red cabbage was the first variation. The cabbage turned the soup an unattractive color, so paprika, 2 Tbsp, was variation II. What goes with parika? Marjoram - variation III. Why not a little cumin for depth (IV)? The wine seemed wrong at this stage (V). How about some crushed red pepper flakes (VI)? Miles away from the intended flavor, but this soup is absolutely spectacular! Next time I'll have fresh kale and make the original recipe.

I had Italian sausage and Swiss chard, so that's what I used instead of the smoked sausage and kale. I also added chopped tomatoes and red pepper flakes. Perfect for a cold Fall night.

forgot to mention we doubled the recipe so that is why we added the amount of sherry we did.

Rating: 4
this is fantastic! we made it with andouille sausage and think it is the way to go--added so much spice and flavor to the broth. we also used dried white beans we had cooked and substituted 1/4 cup sherry instead of wine as we didn't have any. i think the quality of your sausage and beans play a huge role in how good this simple soup turns out.

Well I just finished making this with some of the suggestions of other reviews. I must say...DIVINE! I had hot Italian sausage which I would highly recomend using as it adds great flavour to the broth. I did use 3 cloves of garlic, sauted some chopped carrot with the onion and sausage which added nice texture and color. I also addes a good pinch of hot chili flakes which was a nice blast if flavour as well. Unless you have an aversion to the wine be sure to use it as it really is what sets the flavour off in the soup. I used spinach as that was what I had on hand. I would defenitly serve this to company, it would be sure to please and impress all. Quick, flavourful, healthy and ingrediants you usually have on hand.A winner!

This is the first soup with greens I have made and it is a definite do again! I followed the recipe exactly except for mashing some of the beans before adding to give the broth a bit more texture. I would do it the same way again except add more beans and cut the sausage up smaller. I might try adding some chopped garlic along with the onion but I might not...it didn't seem like anything was missing.

This was a quick, easy and tasty soup. I followed some of the suggestions from other reviewers. I added just a little red pepper flakes and chopped garlic when sauting the onion. Before adding the kale, after adding the broth I used my hand emulsion blender to puree about 1/8 of the soup. By doing so it added a bit of depth to the soup. I topped the soup with a sprinkling of Romano cheese before serving. This was a nice, hearty soup and I definitely will be making this recipe again, this coming winter.

Excellent soup! My mother in law is going through chemo and needs both protein and fiber and she is raving about it! The keilbasa is perfect because its not too spicy. I substituted the wine for white grape juice and it was great.

great soup. easy to make, can eat on it for days. I always double the recipe.

Really fast/easy. Made lots of substitutions without problem. Added carrots, green peppers bc no kale/spinach. substituted white grape juice bc no white wine. Also used chick peas instead of white beans and sprinkled with romano cheese. A huge hit with my vege hating family.

This is great! I made a vegetarian version with Gimme Lean Sausage style veggie protein and vegetable stock. Since the sausage wasn't real spicy, I added some Emeril's Kick It Up Sauce at the end. This is a keeper!

Rating: 4
This was great. The wine along with the kielbasa really gave the broth a rich flavor. I topped it with freshly grated parmesan cheese. Make sure you use the reduced sodium chicken broth, even with that it was a little salty. (I used the 1/3 less salt variety).

Rating: 3
I sauted the kale and used all chicken broth instead of wine. I think the flavor of the soup comes mainly from the sausage. I used spicy chicken but any kind you like should do fine.

So yummy! This definitely hit the spot for my bean soup craving. I skipped the wine and used spinach instead of kale. Wonderful!

this is a great soup! we add carrots, use a whole bunch of kale and buy the best, most flavorful sausage at the market. a real winner!

I really love this soup and so does my husband. I use turkey keilbasa instead of the sausage and it works nicely. I aso love the nutrients you get from the kale. It's quite a chore to get my husband to eat his greens and this is a great way to do it. This is a regular soup in our house. :)

I find this is a very nice soup and easy to make, but it makes a very big difference what kind of sausage you use. Bland sausage makes the whole soup bland, so go with something spicy and smoky.

This was a wonderful fast and easy soup -- I made it the night before and served it at lunch at work and it was a great hit! Try it, you'll like it!!

Love this soup. I had never made a soup with greens before, but this is delicious. Even better the second time around and I willl be looking for more soups that use greens. I did make this exactly according to the recipe except for adding about 1 tsp of hot sauce and see no need to change what I did.

Horrible. Would give negative forks if I could, or just one spoon to gag me. I stuck to the recipe, clearly shouldn't have. Italian sausage and spinach sound a lot better.

I too have been looking for the ultimate white bean soup and apart from the White Bean Soup (Bon Appetit March 2000 on this site) this may be it. Mind you I did alter by substituting Mennonite Smoked Sausage for the linguica,and a package of frozen chopped spinach for the kale. I started out with dry beans as I prefer them to canned beans. While the onions were cooking I added a finely-chopped large garlic clove. So, garlic, smoky meat and spinach make a hearty and delicious bean soup!

Sorry, I thought this was just so-so. I'm still looking for the perfect bean soup!

Rating: 4
This is SO good! Instead of white wine, I used a couple of tablespoons of dry sherry (it's what I had on hand) and increased the broth accordingly. I also used more beans. I did use the linguisa and it really does add to the appearance of the dish (thanks, other reviewer!). I've been looking for ways to add green leafies to the diet since I'm not overly fond of salads, and this is a wonderful way to do that. My husband ate almost all of it for lunch, so I stuck what little was left in the fridge and forgot about it for a couple of days. I remembered it when I served sliced ham steak a couple of days later, so reduced the broth down a bit and served it as a bean side-dish to the ham. It really does improve (and I didn't think that possible) with time. If you're serving for a special occasion, go ahead and make it a few days before. You'll save the time on a starter, having only to re-heat, and you will absolutely get rave reviews on this one.

So easy & simple that I didn't think it would be very flavorful. I was wrong. It was so delicious! I had hot Italian sausage in the house, so browned that & used it. My husband loved it too.

Rating: 3
We did sub andouille for the kielbasa,(it was on hand) with terrific results. It may not have been the intended result, but ended up very well! The kale was not overwhelmed by the hot sausage and such minimal prep to produce a lovely soup! Easy, fast, and flavorful. Did serve with the onion and tomato salad and the crusty bread. Excellent comfort food!

Delicious and so easy to make. Two times, I have used a dry bean mixture (cooked before added to the soup). I mash some of them in some of the chicken stock before adding it to the pot... this thickens it a bit. Double the recipe because you will want leftovers!

My partner went crazy in the dried bean dept. at whole foods market, and came home with at least 10 different bags of beans! It's a good thing he likes soup. I'm making this for the second time, using a bean mixture and linguica, which imparts a smokey flavor and good texture. It's rich, satisfying and easy to make. Try it!

My dad used to make a very similar soup when I was a kid and I always liked it. I very much liked the inclusion of navy beans. I think they give the soup just the right amount of body. I doubled the recipe at everyones suggestion, but still I think next time i will use even more kale. I would also recommend that others try making it with linguica sausage. Linguica has a very satisfying flavor and also deepens the color ofthe soup a bit.

Rating: 3
Wonderful! We loved the flavor and didn't think it was bland at all and the wine gives it a nice fresh taste. Like others who have kale haters in the family, my kale hater declared this a keeper. Used Han's All-Natural Chicken Andouille sausage.

After reading all of the reviews I couldn't wait to make this soup. Followed the recipe exactly and the suggestions to double this. I used a Sauvignon Blanc, and also some spicy chipotle chicken sausages from Trader Joe's. Still, it was pretty disappointing. Bland was not what I was expecting, but maybe it's just that type of soup? I kept thinking something was missing even though I loved the flavor of the kale. Maybe not enough salt? Perhaps I should've sauteed some garlic with the onion at the start? Or perhaps I should try mixing some garlicy semi-mashed potatoes in? I still have a 1/2 pot, so I could just wait till tomorrow to see if the leftovers have improved any on their own before I try adjusting.

I made some changes to the basic recipe: I doubled it. I added cubed butternut squash with the onion, 2 cloves of chopped garlic, I seasoned it with crushed dried sage, Tabasco mild jalapeno sauce (the green one), some thyme and a bit of cayenne pepper. Absolutely fantastic.

My husband called and told me that he was going to be very late getting home the other night so I dragged myself to the grocery store with this recipe in mind. I used Lite Kielbasa and Sauvignon Blanc, 1 head of kale and 1 head of red swiss chard. Doubled the recipe at the suggestion of other reviews. Served with the recommended tomato and red onion salad and a great loaf of bread. This was WONDERFUL. Couldn't have been easier and even my teen-aged son slurped down some leftoevers the next day. This is on my "make often" list. Yum!!

Rating: 4
A real keeper which is even better the next day. Tripled this recipe and used one lb. of kielbasa and two heads of kale, as it's one of our favorite vegetables. However, would use Sauvignon Blanc next time as suggested by another reviewer, instead of Chardonnay (a little too "oaky.")

Rating: 4
This recipe is in my "cook often" file. It is wonderful as written and lends itself well to variation: For instance, once I left out the sausage (to save on calories), cooked and mashed a small potato in the stock to compensate, and added more kale. It was still a very good soup. Try chard instead of kale...that, too, yields an excellent soup!

Rating: 4
I LOVE this recipe. It's a perfect winter soup. I have made it at least a dozen times. It's a great way to eat kale and not feel like you're eating....well.....kale! But kale haters out there can easily substitute spinach. Also the longer the soups sits the even better it gets. Can't recommend this soup enough!

Loved this soup. Made is so quckily with canned white beans. Used lovely escarole in this one since it looked too beautiful to pass up in the store and it was worth it. Didn't have wine so did not add any.

This came out ok. It was a little bitter from the greens, but also because I had to use chardonnay because I had no dry white wine. I expect it will come out better the next time I make it.

I agree with the reviewer below, no changes are necessary. Using canned white beans ctually works just as well, and turns this into an easy workday dinner!

LOVELY JUBBLY. Neither I nor my husband had tried kale before and were a little apprehensive. I agree with another who advises not to hold back on the kale. I use a whole head and turkey keilbasa. I make this at parties and is always a winner. No changes need to be made.

I had a small turnip in the fridge, so chopped that with celery and onion and sauteed all with half pkg. of Ekrich Smoked sausage sliced. Added one carton of chicken broth, the seasonings (bay leaf, S&P, and a little rosemary)and a can of cannelini beans. Brought to boil and added greens (today all I had was some leftover romaine hearts and a little spinach), simmered for 15 minutes til turnips were tender. Added a splash of white wine at the end and enjoyed! I've been wanting to try a white bean/greens soup and this was terrific. Very versatile and light.

Rating: 3
Very Good and super easy recipe. Although I did add a cubed yellow neck squash, a couple dashes of Mrs. Dash, half a chicken bouillon cube, and only 1/4 cup of vermouth in place of the wine. I served it with a spoonful of grated Parmesan cheese in each bowl, along with sourdough croutons. Delish! A definate "do again".

This is a regular in our house. I use whatever greens are on hand--and i get organic produce delivered bi-weekly, so I usually have something. We like mild italian chicken sausage, little pasta shapes and the addition of whatever extra veggies we have on hand--usually carrots, which just light up the soup. YUM!

Very easy to throw together- don't hold back on the kale as it really makes this dish. I would pack in even more kale next time. I used turkey kielbasa and that was tasty as well. I agree- crusty French bread is a must for this soup!

This is a staple in our house. However, I have substituted a 10oz box of chopped frozen spinach, a few grated carrots and add small pasta shapes. It becomes more like stew, we call it Hot Dog soup and top it with Parmesan cheese! If you try my suggestions, please let me know what you think!

I MADE THIS SOUP AND IT WAS VERY EASY AND OH SO TASTY. WE LOVED IT. I USED MUSTARD GREENS AS THAT'S ALL THAT WAS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME. WILL MAKE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.
