The rosemary gives this dish subtle and awesome flavor. I used significantly less cheese (maybe 1/4 cup asiago) and it was still great.

Easy to make, creamy and filling, though it required a little salt for flavor. Poured some over sauted tomatoes and squash in a buttered custard cup then topped with more parmesan and some panko bread crumbs. Broiled for 3-4 minutes, made a delicious little side.

My husband usually avoids polenta like the plague . . . but he really liked this! Very quick and easy!

This was very good, but the consistency was almost like paste after adding the cheese. I don't think it really takes 15 minutes to cook, which was probably my problem.

I, too, used half milk and half chicken broth to enhance the flavor. The flavor was great, but the texture was a little too mushy for our liking. I'll definitely try it again, but with the addition of baking it before serving.

I made this dish for a dinner party and my guests said it was the best polenta they ever had. I altered the recipe somewhat and used 2 cups of whole milk, 1 cup of heavy cream, and 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I also added more mozzarella and parmesan. I transferred it to a glass baking dish and baked it for 20 minutes as well. It was absolutely delicious.

I used a 1:1 ration of low-fat and rice milk and part-skim mozzarella. Served as a bed for pan-grilled boneless pork chops and pan-grilled zucchini and red peppers (pork was seasoned with a dry rub of Montreal Seasoning crushed in a mortar and veggies were marinated in olive oil & balsamic vinegar, basil & oregano). Very fast to make and easy to clean up.

I loved this, even though I didn't have enough milk, so substituted chicken broth for the entire amount. Probably not as rich, but the taste was wonderful. Will use milk next time to compare. Taste before salting, especially if you use broth, even the reduced sodium kind. I found that with that and the cheese, I didn't need to add any.

I have made many polenta recipes but this one keeps coming back as my favorite! Excellent with the steak with peppers and balsamic!

Served this with steaks in a strong pan sauce and fresh green beans. Two of us ate the whole thing! A nice, creamy dish, easy to make. A great counterpoint to the strongly flavored meat. Topped each serving with a bit of freshly grated parmesan.

Easy and delicious. Served it to my 94-year-old grandmother who loves to cook and she stole the recipe from me. Modern comfort food!

This recipe is so easy and so delicious. I was always afraid to make polenta because of all the stirring, but this took about 15 minutes. You can cook it longer and then make patties out of it for frying. Top it with roasted red peppers sauted in balsalmic vinegar.
