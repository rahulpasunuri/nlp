Very easy, especially if you have a stand mixer with a dough hook! Even my picky eater loved this. It went excellently with the marinated flank steak I grilled right along side it and served thinly sliced tucked inside.

Made this yesterday, exactly as the recipe reads. After cooking, we topped with pesto or tomato sauce and some cheese, put back in the grill on top rack to melt the cheese - instant pizza :-) The dough is sticky, but as other reviews have said it was well worth it.

Has anyone tried making this recipe in a bread machine under the dough cycle?

Go to the flatbread recipe and click on the boldface "Green Charmoula." It will take you to the recipe. It's kind of like a Moroccan green salsa.

I live in Mexico and don't know what "Charmoula" is. Can you please explain? Thank you.

This is the most delicious flatbread I've ever tasted! The texture and flavor are excellent. The dough is very sticky and wet but well worth the trouble for such great results. We decreased the salt by half because 2 TBS is far too much.

Fabulous! The flatbreads turned out just like the picture and had excellent texture and taste. I made the dough the day before and stuck it in the refrigerator overnight to rise. This was a great plan. After dividing into 8 pieces, I formed (stretched) the dough right at the grill and dropped it on the grates. The grill times in the recipe were perfect. I served it with the green charmoula, which I thought at first, on its own, wasn't anything special, but once paired with the bread, and cotija cheese, was much better. I think the charmoula would go great with avocado, which I will try next time. I also served the flatbread with a red bell pepper chipotle spread. The only change I will make for the flatbread recipe next time is to decrease the salt by a third. Also please note that it took at least twice as long as stated to knead the dough to the correct consistancy.

I made this recipe this weekend for a pool party - the dough and the flatbread came out perfect. The only change i made was switching to plain low fat yogurt instead of sour cream.... I made the Green charmoula topping - it was outstanding.... guests were licking the plate!!!

This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to review a recipe. What a mess this made. The ammount of flour given in the recipe was not enough by a long shot. I added another 3 cups of flour just to get it to the handling stage. I have been making my own bread for 40 years and I should have known better.
