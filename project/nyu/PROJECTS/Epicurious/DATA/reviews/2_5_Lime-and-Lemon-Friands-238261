These were moist, dense but light testured. Delicious but could use a little more flavor, maybe almond?? Came out perfect in regular muffin tins. michigan cook.

I will try this recipe again because I think I did some things wrong. I over beat my egg whites to stiff versus frothy. Therefor, the cakes were a bit spongy. And I firmly agree with a prior reviewer that 400 degrees is too hot for the oven. They were too brown on top and the lemon and lime looked more like toasted onions. I'll try 375 degrees next time. There is definitely potential here. Served with the Lime and Lemon Posset, which was to die for.

Very zesty desert. Boyfriend went crazy for it, actually ate all of them over two days. The desert felt fresh and light, truly delicious. I'll make these many times to come.

Flavor was excellent, and the texture is identical to friands I ate often in Australia. However, I wonder if there was a misprint in oven temp or cooking time. I left them in for about 20 min at 400 degrees. They were not cooked through, but any longer and they would have been too brown on top. I will try at a lower temp.

I used the egg whites only. The recipe came out fine,and they looked very attractive; however my guests and I found them heavy and not very tasty.

I also experienced a very eggy final product. I separated the eggs as instructed. These were very buttery and needed to bake longer than indicated to be set in the center.

I need to redo this recipe. I had more of an egg taste and not a teacake taste. I hope others try this recipe and rate it.
