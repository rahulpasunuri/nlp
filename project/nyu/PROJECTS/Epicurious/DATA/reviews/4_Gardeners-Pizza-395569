WOW - this was the best pizza I've ever made. Great recipe. Dough was like silk. Made it a day ahead and had two nice size pies. One just had cheese, sauce and basil. I even made my own ricotta. The other was made with the cheese, chicken sausage, sauce and basil. Fabulous. Thanks for this recipe. It's a keeper.

Oooooh! But imagine the crunch of the crust along with gooey cheese and juicy grilled veggies! It looks delicious!!

This looks burnt!! Best take that into account when following the directions.
