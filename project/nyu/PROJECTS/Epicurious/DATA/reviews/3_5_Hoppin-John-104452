As written, this recipe comes out pretty bland. I took the advice of other reviewers and made it in chicken broth, and added some sautéed onions and garlic. Also used salsa and jalapeño peppers to spice it up a bit along with one small fresh tomato. I took out two ladle spoonfuls of beans and puréed in a food processor, and then added that back in to thicken the dish. I cooked my rice separately because it was difficult to figure out if my proportions would be right, and as you know, rice is all about proportions. Given all that, I guess I made a different dish, but this was a useful skeleton to start from. I ended up with delicious black eyed peas for New Years, but only partial credit for that can go to the base recipe. Happy 2013!

Have never enjoyed the meal of Hoppin John but used this recipe thanks to JJ Mirabile who owns Jaspers here in KC! Added Jasmine Rice and really enjoyed it. Thanks JJ & Epicurious.com!

Our family always uses 1 can of Ro-tel tomatoes and green chiles (Original) to 2 cans of black eyed peas. Drain the beans.The Muir Glen organic roasted tomatoes and green chiles works pretty well too. If you make it without the ham and make the rice on the side, vegetarians can have good luck too, then for leftovers during the week I add the ham or andouille sausage.

For the negative reviewers, please note that this particular recipe is very short on some exciting flavors (although it does provide a great basic framework). Things to experiment with: a few cloves of garlic (diced), a bay leaf or two, a yellow or red pepper (very finely diced) will add a surprising amount of sweetness, and using chicken broth instead of water when preparing the final dish.

I grew up on this dish, which my Mom learned from a southern woman she once worked for. She called it "hopjohn," and makes it a little differently. You fry a bunch of chopped bacon, add a bunch of chopped onion, fry till onions are golden, then add cooked blackeyed peas and cooked rice, and stir fry it till hot through and then a few more minutes. Salt and pepper to taste. She liked it with soy sauce. This remains a favorite.

This dish was great. My family enjoyed it very much. Instead of plain tomatoes to top it off I used salsa. JF in Cleveland

We eat hoppin john ever New year's Day. I substituted 3 cans of black eyed peas, omitted the water, and put all the ingredients in a crock pot on high. I also added one minced clove of garlic. My family really liked this dish.

When I make Hoppin' Johns - I fry up some bacon and then add onions and bell peppers (jalapenos if I am feeling fiesty). I season with salt and pepper and sometimes Zatarain's creole seasoning. DELICIOUS!

This dish has become an annual event in our household, but I do make slight additions to the recipe base. A can of seasoned diced tomatoes, garlic cloves as well as Italian Sweet Sausage seem to give it the needed "oomf" that most basic Hoppin John recipes lack. I suppose one could also say that changing the recipe no longer makes it Hoppin John, but I'll leave that up to you to decide! In the meantime, enjoy it!!!

I liked this but my partner (who usually loves bean dishes) asked me never to make it again. It came out just fine (peas tender, rice perfect, very little liquid remaining) but it lacked.... something (yes I added hot pepper). I even baked corn bread but couldn't find "greens" in Luxembourg. Next time I'll serve as a side dish with fried chicken. It was better the next day.

Very tasty. I pulled the ham hock out at the end, picked what little meat is there, shredded it, and added it back to the dish. Used a good bit of coarse salt and cracked black pepper to zip it up. I liked it a lot, my husband was less thrilled. But then again, black-eyed peas aren't his joy, so I still give this a "delicious" rating.

This was good for black-eyed peas. I added louisana hot sauce to kick it up a bit and a little kosher salt and fresh black pepper.
