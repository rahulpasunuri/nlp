I have made this recipe many times, including making it for my wedding reception. I made a double batch for that particular affair and it was completely gone at the end. It is an exceptional sauce.

I'm long overdue to comment on this GREAT recipe, which I've used for several years. We have it regularly on lamb burgers, salmon and other fish -- or just by the spoonfuls! Over the many times I've made it, I've adapted it a bit to (1) use a coarse grater on the cuke to make a nicer consistency (2) eliminate milk (3) add some onion powder & black pepper. I always use the seedless cucumbers which are milder and "burp-free". ENJOY, as we have and will continue to do.

You can use greek yogurt instead of sour cream. even 0% fat Total is think enough if you leave ut the milk. As far the person who's so upset this isn't real tzatziki - well, it doesn't *say* it's tzatziki, does it?

Easy, light and a natural with poached salmon. Suspect this recipe would have titled differently had it been a recipe for tzatziki.

THIS IS A TRULY FANTASTIC RECIPE. 4 PICKY EATERS AND ALL LOVED IT! I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME TIPS: I DID NOT HAVE FRESH DILL BUT USED GOOD QUALITY DRIED DILL AND IT WAS STILL EXCELLENT. THE TRUE DILL FLAVOR DOES NOT DEVELOP FULLY UNTIL YOU REFRIGERATE THE SAUCE,SO DON'T OVERDO THE AMOUNT. I USED "CREME fRAICHE" (FRENCH STYLE SOUR CREAM)INSTEAD OF PLAIN SOUR CREAM AND IT WAS PERFECT. I CHOPPED THE CUCUMBER IN THE BLENDER ON "CHOP" SETTING (WHICH ONLY GOES MANUALLY AND STOPS WHEN YOU DONT PRESS THE BUTTON) AND THE CUCUMBER TEXTURE WAS JUST RIGHT, WITH NO LUMPS. ENJOY!

If you are looking for a Greek tzatziki, this is not it. It's too runny and the real stuff doesn't come near sour cream. Take a carton of full fat yogurt and drain in cheese cloth or even coffee filters, overnight is best. Peel and seed a large cucumber. Grate, salt lightly and drain for about an hour. Mix with the yogurt, extra virgin olive oil (at least 2Tbs, but to taste), 2-4 crushed garlic cloves (again, to taste), salt and pepper and dill. Best to make at least 2 hours in advance. Now THAT is real tzatziki (and I've been to Greece).

I MADE THIS 3 TIMES IN 3 WEEKS AND NOW CONSIDER IT "MY RECIPE"! tHE 1ST TIME IT WAS LUMPY; 2ND TIME I LEFT OUT THE MILK TO MAKE IT THICKER FOR A FISH SAUCE. TODAY IT IS JUST RIGHT; I USED THE PULVERIZER AND BLENDED THE WHOLE THING AND PUT IT OVER A VEGGIE SALAD AND THEY ALL WANTED MORE. YOU COULD ADD A TAD MORE OF MILK AND SERVE IT AS A COLD SOUP.

Great recipie I have used on several types of fish! It also works well with dried dill, if you haven't got any fresh.

This was soooo good! We used it with butterflied leg of lamb and made gyros. I think that it would be geat with certain fish dishes also.

I serve this on cold poached salmon -- delicious! The perfect light sauce for a hot summer day.

This was the perfect sauce--creamy, quick to make, and healthy--goes on everything!!! Even my oh-so-conservative husband dared to try it--I ate it on lambburgers, he ate it on hamburger. We both loved it! Next time I will put it in a food processor so there are no cucumber chunks. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.

Great sauce that compliments all fish well. I've used 1/2 sour cream & 1/2 plain yogurt when making it & it's just as delicious!

I've made this sauce several times and have received big compliments. I serve it with grilled salmon and other fishes.
