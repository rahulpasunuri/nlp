Loved it! At first, it tasted a little bland... you have to keep adding the salt, truffle oil and pepper until it tastes just right. Served it with the blue cheese crusted filet mignon and red wine reduction sauce and a side of creamed spinach (both recipes on this site) one of the best meals I've ever made! These go great with blue cheese.

Liked it but also didnt taste the truffle oil. Feel like it needed the truffles to make it different. Enjoyed it but I think there may be better recipes for mashed potatoes out there.

I didn't peel the potatoes, and mashed them with the back end of a spoon - I like my taters rustic. I also used sliced black truffles and poured in the oil from the jar instead of using premade truffle oil. It was delicious - nice and decadent. I would have even liked a stronger truffle flavor - next time I plan to shave them rather than slice them [per a friend's advice].

Excellent flavor. Based on previous reviews I used a little less truffle oil and didn't not get an overwhelming flavor. Either with or without the truffle oil how can you go wrong with butter, half and half, and olive oil?

Wonderful wonderful wonderful. I have made this dish several times now because (1) I think it's very tasty and (2) everyone always raves (and raves). I have not added the actual truffles yet (too expensive) but the rest of it is such an explosive combination, it is still great. And it's is super easy.

This is a very good recipe. I, also, don't know what's up with knucklehead or marblehead or whatever his name is... If you buy quality truffle oil, you have such a delicious indulgence to enjoy. We had black truffle shavings and truffle oil left over from last night and this was the perfect way to use it up. This is comfort food at its best!

WOW-I will never make plain mashed potatoes ever again. I absolutely loved this, & it could not be a simpler dish to make. It's just fine without actual truffles,& I thought the Cuisine Perel Truffled Oil I used was very good quality at a reasonable price at $7. As a little oil goes a long way, I really think this is a simple & inexpensive side dish. I do recommend using the Yukon Gold potatoes.

Potatoes made this way are rich and delicious. Ignore "marblehead's" comments and go ahead and try this . Maybe s/he got hold of a rancid bottle of truffle oil? S/he made similar comments on the other truffled mashed potatoes recipe -- and I'll bet anywhere else truffle oil is mentioned. We'd be extremely fortunate to locate a truffle around here, and ordering them would be just too expensive. We can't all be Rockefellers ;) Anyway, we just love these potatoes -- give them a try, and I bet you will, too!

Too scared to overpower the recipe with the truffle oil - especially since I was trying it out on 12 at Thanksgiving - so I halfed it. Still gave it a nice subtle taste and everyone loved them. I had never tried the olive oil before -- it all added up to nice, rich mashers. I'll make this again.

great rich recipe. I too, used truffle oil and am mystified by marblehead's 'motor oil' comment.....

Just finished making this for our New Years dinner. AWESOME. Used extra virgin olive oil. Also warmed the half and half with the butter until it melted first, then added to potatoes (per Alfred Portale). Used white pepper.

Delicious!! I used white truffle oil and a domestic white truffle from Pike Place Market. (By the way, I have purchased white and black truffle oils and I have never had the motor oil experience which Marblehead experienced.)

No, no, a thousand times no. The "chopped black truffles" which are "optional" are what make this dish. They're not optional--they're mandatory. If you're going to make mashed potatoes, for heaven's sake, don't bother with truffle oil. Regardless of how much you paid for it, it still will taste like motor oil, and so will anything you add it to. Save your money for ordering black truffles while in season--you'll be glad you did.

I actually didn't use truffles since I had already spent a pretty penny on the meal that I was preparing but did go for the quality white truffle oil. Be sure to pay attention to the wording on the bottle, truffle "aroma" is not the same thing as being made with the actual truffles. It is definitly more expensive but well worth it.

A really easy dish that impresses the guests. I used lowfat milk instead of half and half and the potatoes still tasted rich and heavenly. I also used a 2:1 ratio of russet potatoes and unskinned red potatoes. Will definitely make these again.

Scrumptious! Although I have to admit, I added 1/4 cup of truffle oil and skipped the olive oil. The aroma alone was worth the expense.

I made this w/ a small $12.00 bottle of white truffle oil,butter whipping crm and omitted the olive oil. They were amazing. My dinner guest said they were the best mashed potatoes they ever had!

The flavor of these truffled potatoes depends entirely upon the quality of the truffle oil used - the less expensive oil ($7) made the potatoes taste industrial and nasty. However, the very special $25 oil made the potatoes absolutely delicious!

I had an interest in this recipe due to the use of white truffle oil, about which I had heard a lot but had not used previously. In my experience, the oil was not bad but not all that special. The potatoes still needed to be seasoned with salt and pepper and more butter. I will search farther for better ways to use the oil; there are clearly better ways to serve potatoes.
