I prefer a little more crunchy crust for a cobbler - and the puff pastry stars (or in my case, hearts and scottie dogs) don't hold up well in the fridge.

very good. I hate when we seem to think we know more than the chefs, but--for the ice cream, I added 1 teaspn Knox gelatin to the lemon juice to soften and cooked with the curd, 3 whole eggs to cut down fat and quicker. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup turbinado and used fat free buttermilk. Still delicious. The gelatin makes it smooth. Love my Deni freezer.

We liked the buttermilk ice cream a lot. It was very refreshing with a nice bright flavor. We served it with a very rich rum spice cake and it was lovely. I usually use another buttermilk ice cream recipe from this site but I was intrigued by the lemon. I will admit to adding about 1/2 cup of heavy cream because I had it on hand.

I made the berry cobblers but not the ice cream. The cobblers were fabulous--nice and warm and gooey with a lovely fruit flavor. I served them with vanilla ice cream, and my guests raved. I have made them several times for our Fourth of July parties.

Like the other reviewer, I, too, only made the ice cream. I was a bit disappointed. It would probably be okay complimenting something less sweet, but on its own, it's far too tart. It almost has the taste of lemon meringue pie without the meringue and without the crust. So you can see why it would be a bit challenging to eat on its own. Maybe one could make a lemon meringue ice cream pie!

Haven't tried the cobbler, but the ice cream is delicious with a blueberry pie. It's very easy to make and has a fresh, tangy flavor. Highly recommended.
