An easy and satisfying entree. We used vegetarian kielbasa and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

We served this last evening for a "back porch" dinner party for 6, an it was a huge hit. Increased dressing by 50%, although only used 3 tbsp dijon mustard. Used fresh sour dough from Panera. Biggest change: grilled shrimp as well as chicken sausage along with kielbasa. Not much dressing left over since I used generously while grilling. This is definitely a keeper!

made this with turkey italian sausage... really, really good! Even the kids loved it and that means I'll make it again for sure! Also used a little bag of broccoli slaw for the side salad... delish!

So good & easy. The dressing was delicious. My 4 year old even ate it all (except veggies). The bread grilled & soaked in dressing made it different & yummy! Can't wait to make it again.

This recipe was so unbelievably good! We love grilled veggies and the Kielbasa on the grill, slightly charred - to die for. A complete meal. I made garlic toast as an accompaniment and did not do the bread cubes.

Not impressed. So many better ways to kebab.

This dish is wonderful served on the deck on a week night. I've used the Healthy Choice brand and it's so low in cals. and fat yet still very yummy.

Fabulous - If you cut all the pieces a bit smaller - makes a great appetizer.

3 1/2 forks! Loaded with flavor. I'm not usually a big keilbasa fan, but this was a great combination, and grilling makes a huge difference. I will definitely make this recipe again.

The kebab element is a bit laborious and unnecessary. We used an indoor grill to do the veg and then the andouille sausage. The dressing is what makes this salad delicious.

Easy and delicious recipe! The dressing is great and the sourdough bread was a nice and unusual addition. I also had a lot of dressing leftover; next time I may only make half of it.

This was easy and very tasty. It was also a beautiful presentation. I used reduced fat Kielbasa. will make again.

This was definitely different than usual kabobs and I loved the dressing, but there was lots of it leftover and I couldn't really taste it on the spiedini themselves. Overall we liked it, didn't love it. I did only use 1 lb of kielbasa and wish I included more. And watch your grill, the bread can cook up too quickly before the peppers and onions.

Delicious! This was so quick and easy to make, and was so full of flavor. We also added steak along with the sausage for a mixed grill.
