Easy to make, with lovely flavor, just like the soup at my favorite Japanese restaurant. I made the Dashi using the nested recipe link, purchasing the Kombu and Bonita flakes at a local asian market. I believe using authentic ingredients to be especially important to the success of this recipe. Preparation took all of 20 minutes. Like other reviewers, I cut the seaweed down to 1/4 cup, as I found that was plenty for my tastes. Definitely a new staple in my house.

Tastes great and authentic. I went to the local Nijiya Japanese food supermarket to get the ingredients. Next time I wouldn't use as much wakame (maybe 1/4 cup dried?).

Just like the restaurant!! Will add pork next time. Excellent! Use the right ingredients - no substitutions!!

Quick, easy and perfect. Can throw it together with things kept around the house; great for a sick day. Our kids love it -- keep begging for extra tofu!

This is just delish, a traditional and respectfully Japanese preparation. I've been going through a dashi/miso soup thing lately, and have been eating it hot with any combination of mushrooms, sweet potato/winter squash, peas, Chinese cabbbage, carrots, sliced fish, and noodles. I even eat it for breakfast (BEFORE adding miso) by slowly stirring beaten egg into simmering dashi like egg drop soup, then doctoring further. This is even good cold, like for breakfast. Very versatile and one of my current faves.

Pretty easy to make and tastes great. I added shitake mushrooms and liked the amounts of tofu and seaweed this recipe has in the soup. I'll definitely make it again.

Super easy and so delicious, though I've never had so much seaweed in any miso soup I've ordered in a Japanese restaurant. 1/2 c. dried wakame resulted in almost 2 cups. So I only put half that amount in the soup and it was perfection.

Most excellent. As a addition, do not ever boil Miso, because boiling can kill the friendly bacteria in Miso. The good bacteria make for happy bowel absorption nutrition.

This is a great, simple recipe, once you have the ingredients. I had to go to a specialty japanese market to find the Dashi. It is a fish stock and will last a long time in the pantry. I make the broth with the Dashi as directed on the bottle, then add a leaf of kombu. I heat this up while I reconstitute the wakame in water. I mix some of the dashi with the miso - just to get it going - then add that and the tofu to the pot of dashi and let it all simmer together for about 10 minutes. I remove the Kombu before serving. Sometimes I add mushrooms. Good quality miso makes a difference.

Wonderful soup: whole family (kids aged 5 thru 10) loved it. I like a lot of seaweed so I put the 1/2 cup reconstituted in and then added the rest. Be careful with the instant dashi powder: all the boxes I found contained MSG. I made the dashi with kombu (kelp) and bonito flakes and it was gorgeous.

Great recipe! I use less than 1/4 wakame, otherwise, it's waaaay too much. I've made this about 8 times - kids love it, it's great for snacking and even breakfast! I don't make my own Dashi, I just buy the dried version and add a tsp per 3 cups water. That makes it super easy and something you can make at the drop of a hat. The miso keeps in the fridge for months! Wonderful! Give it a try!!

Not a review - a question. Would this soup freeze well?

This is a good recipe. The 1/2 cup wakame is too much unless you want a seaweed soup. To make this into a seaweed soup Korean style, you should stir-fry the wakame in Asian sesame oil with garlic for a couple of minutes, and then add the Dashi and other ingredients. You can also stir fry in a small amount of thinly cut strips of beef, for a fuller flavored seaweed soup. However, unless you are making a seaweed soup, 1/2 cup dried wakame is too much. Also, to flavor the dashi for miso soup, a few inches (e.g. 6 inches) of dried kelp should be added to the warm liquid to steep and removed before the soup comes to a boil.

recipe is super good! Leave everything AS IS minus the seaweed- which I would minimize down to 1/4 c. pre-cooked. This recipe is sooo much more exceptional than the miso soup you get at sushi restaurants. You can add whatever you want to the recipe to make it your own. YUM

Yum. I've never made miso soup before and this turned out great. So satisfying. I get tired of regular American breakfast foods and think I'm going to try a bowl of this for breakfast this week. I couldn't find wakame, so I used arame and it worked well.

This is not a review either. Where would be the best place to find all the ingredients for this soup?

EZ & terrific. Thanks to all cooks who warned about the overdose of wakame. I used 1/4 cup dried & it was plenty once reconstituted.

Rating: 3
I thought the soup was ok but the seaweed amount is way too big. In fact, next time I would leave it out altogether. Also thought that red miso might taste better. I have had much better miso soup in restaurants and one place I know uses soft tofu and somehow blends it in the soup so it almost looks like egg. The recipe is ok but needs a lot of tweaking.

hey, cfeinberg, thanks for the information...I think I'll check out that Miso book

Hi Mississuaga- I am currently reading "The Book of Miso" by Shurtleff and Aoyagi. Great book if interested in Miso...they say that miso can last from 6 months to a year without refrigeration even...hope that helps!

This is not a review. Am posting this question in a few places...How long does Miso last? (This epicurious crowd seems pretty knowledgeable - I'm sure someone wil know) Thanks

Finally! The exact taste from my favorite Japanese restaurant. I can't believe I was so fearful of using Bonito flakes before, but I'm cured now. It just doesn't get any easier or healthier than this. I agree about 1/2 cup RECONSTITUTED seaweed though, being a more appropriate amount.

Used JFC International dried wakame, and 1/2 cup was way too much. Another recipe that I like calls for only 3/8 oz. for 6 servings. Maybe this is miswritten and should read "1/2 cup reconstituted wakame"???

Awesome soup. Best I ever had. 2 notes: (1) The dashi powder makes dashi. I mixed 1 tsp dash powder to make one cup of dashi. (2) There was too much seawood, will cut that in half next time and prolly double the scallions.

Wow! What an easy, straighforward miso soup recipe! Made my own dashi from scratch. Would like this to be a bit saltier. Maybe I'll add a tad more miso for my taste.

I make this soup on a regular basis. My favorite variation is with soaked, sliced leeks rather than scallions, and with shredded napa cabbage added. Very tasty, and very healthy.

This soup is authentic and delicious. It tastes superior and less salty than what I've eaten in Japanese restaurants. Also, very simple to prepare. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this recipe three times. The first time I followed directions to the tee and it turned out fantastic. It's as good, if not better, than anything I've eaten in a Japanese restaurant. The next time I played around by adding shitake mushrooms, bok choy, extra tofu, and soy sauce. I've even added thin slivers of pork, chinese cabbage, and red miso...divine. This recipe is a keeper just as it is and it's also fun to play around with. Great comfort food, and the fact that it is so darn quick to prepare is the best part! FIVE FORKS!!

Such a simple recipe and such a delicious soup. Try it with red miso sometime for even more flavor. Delicious!

What a winner! Quite easy to make and tastes great! I actually like it better than what we eat in the japanese sushi restaurants because there is more tofu, scallions and seaweed. It seems that the Japanese sushi restaurants like to serve it more as a broth, than a soup, but it's still very light.

I have made this special soup on a regular basis, and am amazed each time by the authentic result of the recipe. It is a delicious, delicate, and fully balanced soup. I highly reccomend it with the wasabee/honey coated salmon.

The soup turned out wonderful! I will make it again and again! Maybe a little less wakame.

cookin in hawaii,this is considered the base of this perticular soup. We tend to add,mung sprouts ,snow peas sliced thin,carrots channeled along the sides then sliced very thin to resemble flowers and a raw egg scrambled in.
