I was surprised by how easy this was to make, and how good it tasted. This is a lovely, lighter soup - great for spring and summer. I added a large garlic clove, and a low sodium chicken broth cube.

I have made this recipe several times. It is simple, I don't put garlic just spring onions and the spinach. i use fresh baby spinach and its a great soup. Easy and delicious.

I was pleasantly surprised by the texture of this soup, and the bright green color was a fun feature. However, the flavor was extremely bland and did not provide the winter comfort I needed!

I got scared by the reivews, but I did add 2 cloves of garlic minced with the onions, added some chicken stock as I was short on the milk. Was delicious, will make it again.

I added minced garlic while cooking the onions. I added a boullion cube to the milk and then topped the soup off with about 3Tbsp of parmesan cheese. I found that this combination really helped add flavor to the soup without being overpowering.

I thought this soup was absolutely delicious and easy to make. I sauteed the spinach with three bulbs of chopped garlic and it tasted perfect

I thought this soup was really bland and tasteless. I even tried to jazz it up by adding some chicken stock, but it just wasn't that good. If you want a really good spinach soup, try the "Spinach and Scallop Soup" also available n epicurious. It's delicious!

I made this as a first course for St. Patrick's Day dinner(the color was great!), and it was wonderful! I used fresh baby spinach leaves. Easy and quick to prepare, a perfect creamy soup.

extremely easy and VERY good! i only had skim milk on hand so i increased the butter and flour a tad. misjudged it (the base was a little too thick) and put about 1/2 a cup of chicken stock into the blender when i was processing it, along with the dill. very rich tasting. we will look forward to having it again! i haven't tried it yet, but am willing to bet it would be just as good served cold.
