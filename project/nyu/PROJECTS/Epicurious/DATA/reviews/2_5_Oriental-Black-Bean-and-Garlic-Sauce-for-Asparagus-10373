Tasty -- sauce really livens up the asparagus; nice accompaniment to grilled salmon and green salad.

Very nice. This has a subtler flavor than I anticipated yet makes and excellent sauce for noodles with stir fry veggies.

My cooking technique is to first stir fry the asparagus (or green beens, broccoli, etc.) for a minute to coat with oil. Frying garlic, ginger and hot pepper prior to adding the vegetable is helpful. Then, pour in 4-6 ounces of water, cover and complete the cooking by steaming.

Common sense tells me that this is a sauce to serve over cooked asparagus. :)

In oriental Black Bean Sauce recepie it doesnot say whether the asparagus needs to be boiled before or stir fried. It is pretty confusing.
