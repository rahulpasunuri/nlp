Don't throw away the liquid used for simmering the ribs! It makes a super yummy soup base for cooking some instant ramen. :)

I followed the honey & 5-spice powder advice of others and the glaze was delicious! I found the meat a little tough but would consider the meal an overall success. Now I just need to think of other ways I can use that glaze. Yummy!

Delicious, but seemed too sweet after adding the 1/2 cup sugar, so I added another 1/4 cup or so of soy sauce. Only gripe would be that after following all the instructions to a T, they still did not "glaze" as claimed.

We used baby back ribs and boiled them as directed with the addition of a splash of rice vinegar to tenderize the meat a bit. We made the glaze as the ribs were boiling and then finished the ribs off on the grill basting with the glaze. Excellent!! I've had many ask for the recipe.

Very tasty! Not great to look at. Next time I may use baby back ribs for the appeal. Good for a party because they can be made ahead.

Scrumptious! My friends loved this. Still, a couple of them said the glaze was a little too sweet. Next, I'll salt it a little better and use more cayenne pepper.

Great!! Made it for three hungry men and there was not a rib left. Followed suggestions to use honey and stir fry first before adding glaze. Added more fresh ginger than called for and used five-spice blend. A keeper for sure!

These are incredible: does anyone knnow if I can make the whole thing, glaze included, and then freeze them? I need to make them for a school grad night!

Nice easy recipe. I took the tips from an other review to cut calories. It was very flavorful.

I used the boneless pork ribs as well, but had no star anise so used 2 tsp. of 5 spice powder and that worked beautifully. I also made sure to stir fry the chunks several minutes first for a nice crust before adding the glaze mixture. Served over brown rice for a tasty, easy dinner!

This dish is amazingly delicious, even just the glaze. The ginger add quite a bit of pazzazz to it. We found it tasted quite good on top of some flavored rice and garnished with a few orange slices.

These ribs were so easy-like another reviewer, I used honey instead of sugar. I didnt bother to cut them into 2 inch lengths-just separated each rib. My husband the rib freak loved these and so did I.

Loved this recipe but I have to admit I changed it a little to knock off some calories and it ended up DELICIOUS. First, I used boneless pork ribs and trimmed all the fat off. Second, I did not drain the liquid the ribs simmered in, but used it in the next step (after separating out all the oil)instead of the canned chicken broth. I added the orange peel and garlic, as per the recipe but omitted the second addition of minced ginger and soy sauce. Also, I substituted 1/4 cup honey for the 1/2 sugar, cutting even more calories! And finally-- no stir-frying in oil!! I just reduced the broth to a glaze by rapidly boiling for approx 10 minutes. Result: MUCH LOWER CALORIES and everyone RAVED to boot!

These are amazing. My family and friends fought over how many they would each get to eat. Very easy to make as well.

Big hit with my boyfriend and I. Wonderfully delicious with not much work. The best part is that there's no deepfrying/barbecuing involved.
