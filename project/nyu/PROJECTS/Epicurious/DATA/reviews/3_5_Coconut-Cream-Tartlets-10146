Yummy! I haven't made the pastry with it, only the cream. I just buy the puff pastry mini shells and fill with the coconut cream. Delish every time! And EASY. You can't ask for more.

I made the tartlet shells, pudding filling and whipped cream each in advance and waited to assemble until right before serving so the pastry would not get soggy. This way, they were ven great the next day... DELICIOUS and so easy!

I have made this recipe several times but as a pie. I just make the filling and the whipped cream topping and fill my pie crust. Everyone that has tasted it really loves it...including me!!
