Very delicious and easy to make. I used some crumbled feta (1/3 cup) which gave the poppers a little zing. Would use yogurt next time for the dip as sour cream is a bit heavy.

This is the recipe that gets my 7 year old daughter to eat zucchini! I'll make it forever!

i found them a little bland

This is more like a 3.5 star. We enjoyed them, they are sort of hard to keep in form but getting water out of the zucchini is definitely the trick to making this correctly. My guests loved them at my dinner party and I had enough sauce left over to put it toward tacos this week.

I used only sour cream mixed with a few chives for the dip and I also left out the sage for the poppers. I served this at a bridal shower and received wonderful reviews! They ended up being served at room temperature, but still everyone loved them!

I preface this by saying that I didn't make the dip. I made the "poppers" but didn't have any sage, so I used dried dill instead. They were delicious. Very quick and easy, and a less starchy alternative to potato pancakes with just as much flavor.

I used zucchini from last summer that was in the deep freeze. Thought it would be difficult to estimate "3 medium zucchini" but these poppers turned out delicious. Had to add extra egg to get a batter-like consistency. Sprinkle with salt when you take them out of the pan hot. Yum!
