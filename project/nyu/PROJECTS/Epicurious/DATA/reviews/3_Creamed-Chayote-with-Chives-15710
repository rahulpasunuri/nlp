Nice flavor but like other folks I ended up with chayote that were too hard to actually mash. Maybe longer simmering time (I let go for close to 15 minutes)... Even without mashing, fork tender had a delicate flavor (even with all the chives!). I'd make it again, but experiment with the time or maybe steaming chayote to get to point of mashing?

is this supposed to be 30 minutes? 3 minutes does not seem long enough to tenderize chayotes

I had never had this chayote squash, but it was so very good. I went by the recipe, but added more heavy cream, cottage cheese which was melted, parsley flakes, butter and black pepper instead of salt. This dish was delightfully incredible. Much more than I had expected. My baked potato paled in comparison to this masterpiece. I could see other types of squash, bacon and mushroom as being other things to compliment this good, good dish. Thank you for the recipe!

Absolutely luscious, the chayote are very delicate all on their own. The cream isn't necessary -- just a simmering liquid, broth or even the weird vanilla soy milk I happened to have on hand. Chives are gone too but it's the chayote that stars here so not a problem.

We first had chayote in the islands where it is called christophene. I was so excited to find it in the market and looked forward to this recipe. Unfortunately, the chayote was hard and flavorless. I added cumin, curry powder and some fresh cilantro to jazz it up.

when I make this recipe I will return and let you know what I think. I have two chayote vines but in Australia we refer to them as chokos. The recipe sounds great. Chokos are abundant here at the moment.
