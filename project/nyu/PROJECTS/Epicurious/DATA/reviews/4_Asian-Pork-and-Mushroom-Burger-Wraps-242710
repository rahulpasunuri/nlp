Loved this - fun to serve and great summer food. Couldn't find Lemongrass and had to do without. Cant' wait to make them again with the lemongrass. Fabulous recipe!

This is just fantastic! I do add some minced ginger and shallots to the ground pork. The sauce is a must, it enhances the flavor of the pork. While we enjoy eating the burgers in lettuce leaves, our kids prefer them on buns.

Terrific! I used ground chicken instead of pork, and didn't make patties. so it was a more tradtional lettuce wrap -- and it was awesome! Even the kids at our gathering loved it, mushrooms and all!

My husband & I made these on a whim. They were fabulous, and now a family favorite. I substituted the lemongrass with lemon zest, which worked well. I know we will mwke these again, and again.

These were so beautiful and colorful and were absolutely fresh and delicious. Couldn't find lemongrass so I used ginger in the burgers. I liked having the small burgers and being able to choose a smaller portion.

Excellent! Didn't have lemongrass, used chopped chives instead. The sauce is the best. The tastiest wrap I've had.

Took previous reviewer's tip and shaped the patties into flattened log shape, roughly the length of lettus leaves. And added some cooked somen noodles to the wrap. Liked the fact that everything can be prepped ahead of the time.

Used a beef/pork/veal mixture and didn't bother making patties. Browned meat, added mushrooms and seasonings and mixed everything together in a big bowl and, WAL-LAH, lettuce wraps. Very delicious!

Loved this new spin on burgers! I used ground beef instead of pork and it was delicious. This is a great, healthy alternative to regular burgers.

Wonderful, great summer dish. I would make burgers long and thin next time.

We really loved this recipe... though I think next time, I'll serve smaller portions as an appetizer rather than have many for a full meal. I had the butcher grind the meat for me - I don't think there's enough fat in the pre-packaged ground pork in the grocery store to make these as luscious as they could be. The kids liked them, too!
