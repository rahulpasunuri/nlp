Excellent low cost meal for the budget minded person and a great help to the working mother. This recipe provides a high source of protien and fiber. As a working woman, I use two cans of cooked garbanzos and canned chicken broth to speed preparation. One may also add add shredded store brought rotisserie chiken to this recipe.

Left out chickpeas, halves lentils and tomatoes, skipped turmeric and noodles, added fish filets and served with couscous. Nice.

Not my favorite version of this soup; way too much tomato. BTW, tourist from Boston, the directions to puree whole canned tomatoes arise from the fact that not all canned tomatoes are equal--the whole ones are the best quality; they hide the lower-quality tomatoes in thick purees and sauces. I buy the whole ones and reduce them to the size I need, which doesn't take long.

I wanted to love this recipe since I look for recipes w/ chickpeas and lentils. However, something is wrong w/ the spices and I haven't a clue. The taste was a bit "dusky". The flavor of the tomatoes is strong and good but somehow something is off in the spice department. I tried mixing in a little vinegar. I think the cinnamon is calling for something else. It needs to be piquant instead of so muted and dusky. Hmmmm....

One of our favorites! I also add kale or another dark green, more spices, cayenne and lemon. Highly recommend that you cook the chickpeas and use all of the liquid rather than using canned - the taste difference is amazing.

i added the quinoa as well, and extra spices - some cumin and red pepper flakes, and some paprika to give it some kick. the quinoa was a fantastic addition. thanks to those who mentioned using it. the soup was good, i'd probably make it again. i might add sweet potato to it next time instead of lentils

This is a great soup! However, like many others, we made some changes. We had additional ingredients around, so we also added eggplant, artichoke, cayenne, oregano and raisins (which nicely balanced the salty, spicy and sweet elements of this dish). We did not use pasta, but added fingerling potatoes at the end.

At the suggestion of another user, i added 1/2 cup of quinoa; I also added some chopped carrots and omitted the lentils and capellini. Even my somewhat finicky 14 year old really liked it and asked if I would make it again. I think I would add green beans or some other similar green vegetable when I make it next time to give it a little more variety and texture. Overall I would recommend it as a change of pace, light yet satisfying recipe that does not require a lot of exotic ingredients.

Here is my version which my husband loved: use 28 0z can tomatoes and add a couple of fresh ones use canned garbanzos up spices a bit add cumin add ground ginger and / or a touch of fresh ginger if on hand. based on reviewers who thought soup was quite heavy, I omitted lentils and noodles and replaced with kale (1-2 bunches depending on how many greens you like) add a shot of lemon to taste at the end. A totally different soup, but same base which was perfect and easy! A new staple.

Smelled wonderful in the kitchen. This soup is easy and delicious. I served this with the cardamom biscuit recipe on this site. It is super hearty,though. I made it the night before I served it, and put it in the refrigerator over night. When I reheated it, I didn't attend to it and the lentils at the bottom of the pot burned. Moral of the story is that this soup is super hearty and don't forget to keep on stirring or else beans and lentils at the bottom of the pot will burn!

Awesome recipe - with a few changes. I used dried chick peas - quick soaked them (bring 1/2 stock 1/2 water to a boil with dried chick peas, turn off and let sit 45 minutes). I sauteed the onion and spices in a pan, and added them to the chick peas and boiled 45 minutes. Then, I added 1/2 can of diced tomatoes with liquid and about 1/2 a package of cherry tomatoes pureed, plus a few cups of stock, and simmered for 30 minutes. I substituted 1/2 cup of quinoa for the pasta, threw in a coarsely chopped zucchini at the same time as the quinoa, let it simmer another 10 minutes, and added 2 tbs of lemon juice at the end. The chick peas were still pretty firm- but the soup is delicious and freezes great!

So great to find this recipe as a guideline! I spent a week in Marrakesh last month, and this soup is a staple at street vendors' stalls (at about 40 cents a bowl). Most people there make it with orzo, definitely include cumin and lemon in the broth, and serve with a little dish of salt on the side.

I agree with so many others; double the spices, add cumin and I also added cayenne. For those of you that don't do wheat it is also very tasty without the noodles, simply reduce the broth to 3 cups.

Wow- the reviews were all so glowing but I thought this recipe was a bit sloppy. The spices were all off and I had to doctor it a lot. The noodles at the end were a little "hamburger helpery" for my taste. I feel like I could have made up a better version of this recipe without even trying as hard as I did to save this gigantic pot of bleh. My husband went straight for the tums...and I had to apologize. :(

My whole family loved this soup (including a 10 month old and a 3 year old) I added about a tablespoon of fresh ginger with the aromatics, plus followed other reviewer's advice to add a teaspoon of cumin, 1/2 tablespoon of brown sugar, and about a teaspoon of grated lemon rind and lemon juice (at the end) and a tablespoon of raisins.

This soup has become a house favorite. Like other reviewers, we double the spices, add some garlic, cumin and red pepper flakes and use red lentils. We like the appearance of the vermicelli noodles, but if we're making the soup in advance, as we often do, we add them during the reheating. We generally use canned chickpeas, but always drain them and substitute water or stock for the cooking liquid, because liquid from a can of beans can be very salty and have strange after-tastes.

Rating: 4
Really delicious--my husband and parents loved it. I have made it with chick peas from the can (3 cans) and made my own chick peas, and both times it was great. When I cooked the chick peas, I put in a cinnamon stick. Use only 3 cups of added liquid for the lentils. I also added zest of 1 lemon and juice of 1/2 lemon at the end which really made it sparkle.

Rating: 3
This was very good, and very healthy. Replaced the butter with olive oil and didn't miss a thing. Followed previous reviewers' suggestions and doubled all of the listed spices. Also omitted the pasta alltogether to cut back the carbs. Would definitely encourage cooks to add the splash of fresh lemon juice at the end- it needs the acid.

Very tasty soup - you should try it! I couldn't find capellini or fine egg noodles, so I added couscous instead. I also used red lentils to reduce cooking time. The result was an impressive- looking, healthy soup with a subtle cinnamon flavor and aroma. It is even better the second day!

really horrible especially given the time it takes from soaking the dry beans to end result. I must have done something wrong because it wasn't like a broth. it came out thick like pasta sauce. Really not a good reflection of moroccan food which is normally very good.this was just slop.

Rating: 4
Like other reviewers I doubled the dry spices, adding 1 t cumin and 1 t red pepper flakes- recommended if you want a very rich soup. Thoughts: Use the whole tomatoes as directed and puree - you'll get a more full bodied result for your broth. Also,use the dried chickpeas as directed (rather than canned) - and cook in part stock part water. They will be firmer and have more flavor. In addition, the cooking liquid is the thickener for the soup and an important element to the dish. This reduces like a stew. So very delicious and healthy. Make enough to freeze some!

I used canned chickpeas and also added 6 oz. cubed chicken breast which I had sauteed briefly before adding them to the onions, tomatoe puree, etc. I also added cumin and coriander to add more flavor. It made a wonderful soup! I would definitely make it again.

I tried this recipe with the canned chickpea and orzo substitution (1/2 cup only) suggested by others. I also added several cloves of garlic, and did not double the spices or add red pepper. Instead, I added a teaspoon of harissa which spiced it nicely. I also added a handful of mixed greens (collards, spinach, and mustard) as I was sauteeing the onions, celery, and garlic, and used red lentils. Because I used red lentils, I only had to simmer for about 15 minutes, rather than 35. This was a great recipe to prepare quickly on a Sunday evening, for lunches through the week. Wnen I have more time, 'd like to try it with dry chickpeas.

Rating: 4
This is a great soup that was enhanced and simplified by the suggestions of the previous reviewers. Here's a summary of their advice that I followed: I replaced the dried chickpeas with two 15 oz cans of chickpeas (with liquid), used a 30 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the drained whole tomatoes, doubled the spices, and added 1 t ground cumin. I also replaced the capellini with orzo. This last change requires a slight increase in cooking time. You can add water to achieve the desired consistency, depending on whether you want soup or stew...I added about a 1/2 cup toward the end to achieve a very thick soup. This soup freezes beautifully and is a wonderful light supper or very hearty lunch.

This soup was absolutely incredible!!! Following the advice of others, I used canned chickpeas, diced tomatoes including the juice, 1/2 cup basmati rice instead of pasta, 4 cloves of garlic, 2 tsp ground cumin, and doubled the remaining spices. I opted to leave out the parsley and cilantro, but threw in some fresh-shucked corn. Well be making this again for sure!!

I love this soup - it is a great winter staple that takes you away from the chicken noodle and the chili. I just made it last night and made some substitutions - I didn't have any turmeric, so tried to compensate by adding a half teaspoon of cumun. I also added garlic and red pepper flakes (and even a dash of chili powder), as well as a tablespoonful of ajvar (a turkish red pepper paste ranging from mild to salsa hot). I also added an eggplant during the last 30 min of cooking. The results were divine.

A-mazing. This was a hearty, satisfying soup, beautiful to look at, and it fills the house with exotic, rich aromas. I made it for 10, and one of the adjectives used to describe it was "transformational." No joke! I followed other readers' suggestions -- added spices, garlic, jasmine rice instead of noodles, a dollop of plain whole milk yogurt on top -- and I added stock for a slightly more brothy texture. People just loved it. We made it the next week with ground lamb -- a big flavor change, but still really delicious. This is a great recipe that lends itself to a lot of creative tinkering.

I love the other reviewers' advice as they are usually dead on. Since I had no lentils on hand, I used 3 19-ounces cans of chickpeas.

It looks just like the soup I enjoy when I eat out!

This soup sounded so much like another recipe I have that I adapted it for my pressure cooker. I skipped the soak and cut the water to 4 cups. The first step I pressured at 10lb for 20 minutes, added the lentil and 4 cups broth and pressured at 10lb for 15 minutes. Using the pressure cooker takes this from start to table in 1 1/2 hours. I did add garlic and cumin as suggested and skipped the capellini. The onions, celery & lentils melted into the broth giving it a creamy texture. I love soups in the winter and this will be made often, year after year.

This was delicious and so fast/cheap to make! I followed popular consensus and doubled the spices and added cumin and a couple shakes of red pepper which was fabulous. I also skipped the noodles, used canned instead of dry chickpeas and a 12 oz can of diced tomatoes instead of 35 oz. I've found that with other Moroccan dishes I've made, the tomato overwhelms all the other flavors, so this variation was perfect!

This was an excellent meal. To simplify, I used two cans of chick peas, one can of lentils, and one can of diced tomatoes, all undrained. I also added fresh garlic to the onions, and doubled the spices, and included 1 tsp cumin and red pepper flakes. It cooks down to be more like a stew, which I served over jasmine rice. My very picky vegetarian teenage daughter LOVED it, and ate multiple servings two days in a row. So did I.

This was fantastic! So healthy, so quick, so flavorfull! Like other reviewers, I used two cans of chick peas, drained and rinsed, and pureed tomatoes (28 oz can) and added garlic. I had to add a little more broth, since I ommitted the chick pea water, and it was more of a stew than a soup. Instead of pasta I served it over couscous. You could do a lot of variations, but the tumeric-cinnamon-tomato-chickpea combo is a hearty, complex base from which to work.

Fabulous. I didn't really know what to expect, never having cooked with turmeric before. What a great combination of flavors. I added garlic as others did. I froze a great deal of it; will be great all winter!

This is as good as everyone says, a perfect winter supper. I did add two cloves of garlic, a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon and red pepper flakes. I didn't puree the tomatoes, just chopped them coarsely. I couldn't see the need for pasta at all, since it was quite thick. And in a recipe like this, I think there is a big difference between canned and dried chickpeas. The dried ones have a lot more texture and can stand up to all the other ingredients. All in all, a terrific recipe. I had to fight my husband for my share of the leftovers!

Richly flavored, hearty soup/stew that also has the benefit of being healthy. It was quite thick, which we like. I used ghee instead of butter and two cans of chickpeas since I only decide on the spur of the moment to make the recipe. I also doubled all the spices, added two teaspoons of cumin, a shake or two of coriander, added a few shakes of red pepper and threw in four cloves of chopped garlic and two chopped carrots (when the onions were cooking). All three kids rated it a winner.

As others said, this is cheap, fast (if you use canned chickpeas, which I did), healthy and delicious. A rare winning combo! I used a can of ground tomatoes with all the liquid, no need to use the blender. I poured it on cuscus, but I'll try it with whole wheat noodles. I kicked it up with red pepper flakes. It's delicious without them-but it is even better with some heat.

Wow -- this one is a winner! I made just a few enhancements. I added 1 teaspoon of freshly roasted and ground cumin to the spices. At the same time I added 2 chopped garlic cloves (as suggested by others). I used chicken stock instead of veggie. I used less stock than called for because I wanted a thicker stew. I also added 3 finely chopped carrots in with the red lentils. I waited until 10 minutes before the end to add in the parsley, cilantro and the cooked chickpeas. I served it over whole wheat couscous, and topped it with a few good-sized mounds of plain yogurt. Over that I sprinkled more of the cumin along with a spoonful of quick and easy "sesame salt". (This is made by roasting 1 cup of sesame seeds and then grinding them slightly along with a teaspoon or so of salt. This keeps for weeks and is great on everything.) I plan on freezing a few portions to enjoy later. Oh this is good!

This is an excellent soup. I tried dried bean for the first time and it does make a difference as the beans are not smooshy. I added a bayleaf when simmering the beans. I added garlin in with the onions and celery. Ialmost doubled the spices and added in some cumin. Served it with naan. Excellent soup that was every better the next day.

Fantastic!! So surpringly delicious...so easy..so healthy! As with everyone else, I added 3 cloves minced garlic with the onions & celery, along with a teaspoon of red pepper flakes (could've even used more). I used 2 cans drained chickpeas, organic chik broth, one 28 ounce can of tomatoes undrained and whizzed in processor then one 14.5 diced tomato can. Could use up to a full teaspoon of cumin definitely. Sorry, left out cilantro as I hate it! Let is simmer for about an hour to make more like a stew and served over basmati rice. Such minor changes and out of this world!

Sometimes substitute red lentils for nicer color, unique flavor. Loved others' suggestions to add garlic and extra spices -- thanks. Often add vegies on hand along with extra liquid and spices: favorite vegies so far are butternut squash, carrots, cauliflower for added texture and flavors. With summer coming, will experiment w/ zuchinni, red bell peppers, and ??? Added chicken and reduced lentils and peas once w/ good results for hungry meat-eaters. BTW - pasta makes no sense to me: wrong taste, it's better w/ couscous or flat breads for more carbs or soaking up liquids.

I made this soup today and went off to do some errands. I got the ultimate compliment: my son called me and asked what was making the house smell so great. It's a fun soup to make (used canned beans), and impossible not to tweak. I added garlic, cumin and hot pepper flakes. As we go into the weekend, and the kids and their friends come in and out, it will surely hold up. And I think this works in any season. P.S. I agree with an earlier reviewer - I don't see the point of draining the tomatoes and won't do it next time. The soup is plenty thick and could easily absorb that tasty sauce that went down the drain.

This is such a delicious, hearty soup! It's getting added to my list of standards. I substitued olive oil for butter and I used a 14-oz can of garbanzo beans, then used the reserved liquid from the tomatoes since there was no bean cooking liquid. The spices were really wonderful and pungeant, and I wouldn't want to add more. Next time I might add some garlic, but it was really wonderful as is--much better than the harira I had at a local Moroccan restaurant, which I found to be on the bland side.

Inexpensive, easy to prepare, healthy, *and* hearty - this recipe is a definite keeper. I followed the advice of others and added two minced cloves of garlic along with the onion and celery, as well as 1/2 tsp cumin with the other spices. As I was tasting it while cooking, it seemed like it would make a better stew-like dish, served atop rice, than a stand alone soup. So I let the mixture simmer until it had reached a thick stew consistency, left out the noodles, and served it over jasmine rice. The end result tastes like a dish I get at my local Middle Eastern restaurant - really good.

Really great. Like others, I used 2 cans of chickpeas, subbed orzo for the noodles, and didn't drain the tomatoes before I pureed them. I tripled the spices, added a half teaspoon of cumin and two teaspoons of ras el-hanout (bought commercially, but there's a recipe on the site), and two teaspoons of kosher salt. I served it one time with some chopped cooked lamb, but it's a fantastic vegetarian dish, and I didn't miss the meat at all.

The soup was great until I added the pasta. I added a bit more than 2 oz (accidentally) and then the soup sat for a while before we ate it.

I'll make it again, but either omit the pasta or be certain to use the correct amount or add liquid.

This was really good; after making it once we added it to our list of standard dinner items. It's got a nice full, spicy flavor without being hot. The only change I made was to add 1/2 t cumin. It's pretty fast to make once you've got your chickpeas ready.

We added some turkey that had been smoked in the barbeque, which did enhance the base flavors. I also added a small dollop of plain yogurt and served over jasmine rice.

I made this for a Moroccan dinner party as a first course and the Moroccan lamb Tagine as the main course. It was great! I added some small pieces of lamb to the soup for leftovers - it makes a tasty meal all by itself served with pita or flatbread.

I was in a hurry on this chilly, rainy day in New England. This soup was ready quickly and the taste matched the wonderful fragrance. I forgot to add pasta and decided not to when I did remember. I had some parsnip and added one which was a good blend to the flavors. A very good recipe.

A delicious, easy soup-- very filling. I added a couple of zucchini to give it more vegetables, and kicked up all the spices a bit (also added some cayenne for bite). A good choice to serve to meat-eaters and vegetarians together-- even the carnivores will feel full after a bowl of this.

Served this for a dinner party with fish chermoula from this site with roasted sweet potatoes tossed with cumin seed and everyone really enjoyed it. Agree it's better the next day.

I didn't care for the flavor the night I made this - it just didn't taste right. I had it for lunch the next day. Absolutely marvelous! This is a soup that MUST be left in the 'frig overnight before eating.

A delicious, refreshing change to the usual soups you find. I have shared the recipe with my closest gourmet friends and they all think it is tops. Keeps well for several days and freezes will too. I love the touch of the fresh cilantro.

This is great with whole meal rolls on a winters lunch.

If you are a bit stingy with the vegetable broth, this makes a stew-like supper. I thought I had lost the recipe only to find it with the "special recipes" in my 195? Joy of Cooking.

I love the flavour of this soup! It has a very thick wonderful texture. I used water instead of broth and substituted bulgur for the noodles and it was yummy, yummy, yummy! I've made it 3 times already and plan on making it many more times. I soaked the chickpeas the night before and the next day I made it. The prep time is very minimal.

This soup had wonderful flavors and textures. I loved the combination of cinnamon and tomato. It was very hearty too. My husband and I broke our Ramadan fasts with this soup many nights and were very satisfied. I will definitely make this every Ramadan.

Wonderfully flavored soup! This recipe makes a generous amount. For the two of us, it made 4 meals (including adding a salad). Had two this week, froze two additional portions.

I've made this soup 5 times already and everyone I've made it for loves it and asks for the recipe. I also used canned chickpeas and it was just as good as using the dried ones.

Excellent soup. Being in a hurry, I substituted canned chick peas and it was great.
