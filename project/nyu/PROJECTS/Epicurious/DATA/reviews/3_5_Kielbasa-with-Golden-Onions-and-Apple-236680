Very good. However, I also cut the onions back a little, and instead of frying the kielbasa in batches I cut it into large bite sized pieces and grilled it.

Loved this. Skipped the salt, used 1lb of sausage, and served it over tortellini(that I precooked and tossed in the kielbasa/apple sauce to reheat.

I made this recipe quite a few times because it is easy and quick to make. I prefer a little bit more apple than the recipe calls for to balance the salt of the kielbasa somewhat. I think one time I used a summer ale instead of the chicken broth--it toned down the salt a bit without compromising taste.

A great hearty and quick (but fattening!) meal for a cold winter's night. The flavors were noticeably more complex the next day, so I might recommend adding more chicken broth and letting it simmer longer to get the same effect on the first go-round. We served the kielbasa alongside handmade pierogies from a local Polish market - fried in plenty of butter, of course!

This is a delicious meal especially this time of year. I added half a cabbage. The flavors mingled and taste wonderful together. Enjoy with mashed potatoes or egg noodles.

This is a weeknight staple at our house (my husband loves it!) but I agree that some of the proportions need to be adjusted. Thank you to the cook from northern VA who suggested 1 onion and 1 apple per 3/4 lb of kielbasa. That works out just right when used with 2/3 cup of broth (I use veggie broth because I'm allergic to chicken). I reduce the amounts of the rest of the ingredients based on the recipe and the amount of sausage used. Great with brussels sprouts and mashed potatoes.

THis was delicious. I only used one onion and I'm glad I did. It was JUST enough. Anymore would have overpowered the rest of the flavours. I also only used 1/4 teaspoon of salt because the broth was already salty. Will definitely make again.

Delicious for a fast, cheap, and easy meal! I sauted the kielbasa and then did not drain the fat and fond. Instead, I sauteed the onions in that fat and scraped up the tasty, dark pieces on the bottom of the pan. I used a golden delicious apple because it was all I had on hand, and it turned out great. Consider serving this over pasta, mashed potatoes, or spatzel.

Excellent! I also cut the anount of onions ,.. about in half. The apple w it was excellent. Next time I would serve it over noodles because the sauce is so delicious, you wouldn't want to waste it. The dish was a little salty for me. Next time I would either get low-sodium Kielbasa or eliminate the salt called for in the onions.

I substituted some of the butter in the onion and apple mixture with applesauce.

This was seriously delicious. I was looking for something to do with the kielbasa in the freezer, and I had everything on hand. I used a boullion cube to make the broth. To make this for two people, I used about 3/4 lb of kielbasa, one onion and one apple. I halved the butter and used 1 cup of broth. Served with fries and a green salad. This will definitely be a weeknight staple in our house!

I have had this dish in Poland for breakfast. It is very good. I don't think the cooks at work used an apple and they left the kielbasa about six inches in length. Not as spicy as most Americans would like, but I think it's great.

Delicious. I used 2 apples, diced instead of minced, and 2 large sweet onions. Because the apples were bigger I simmered it longer. I also added a pinch of cinnamon. Served with linguine noodles. Quick and easy.

Delicious and SOOO easy! Used only one onion, though. The apple and onion balance perfectly!

I liked this recipe a lot. This is my 2nd time making it now. I do add more apples though and use low sodium kielbasa.

We really enjoyed this, a homey, cold night, easy dinner ... perhaps it was the really good kielbasa I used.

I didn't use as many onions as the recipe requests and it was still a little overpowering. The apple didn't add much flavor either.

Good idea, but the saltiness of the kielbasa overwhelmed all other flavors in this dish. The brand I used had 550 mg/2 oz, and if I make this again, I'll definitely look for one with less salt, and cut them smaller than 3 inch segments. Also, one apple is not enough, given the amount of kielbasa and onions. Also, I'd given the onions more heat or more time than described next time, since getting them carmelized enough to counterbalance the kielbasa is key.
