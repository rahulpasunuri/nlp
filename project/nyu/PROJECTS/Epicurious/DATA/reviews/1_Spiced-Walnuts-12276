I did a small amount of this to test before taking it to a party....it was a waste of time and nuts! I was looking for something with a spicy zing. These smelled wonderful while baking, but the finished product was bland. Still searching for a recipe....

This was really missing something--it was very blah, and all you could really taste was the toasted flavor from baking. I wouldn't do this one again.
