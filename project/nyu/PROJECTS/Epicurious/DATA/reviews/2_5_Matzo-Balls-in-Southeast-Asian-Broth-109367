I made a lazy person's version of this recipe, and it was delicious! I just used the Manichewitz matzo ball soup kit that has the broth flavorings and matzo ball mix in it and added the ginger, onions, lemon grass & etc as described in the recipe. It was delicious, although I'm sure even better if you make your own matzo balls & broth from scratch.

Totally agree. The flavor is in the bones. Since this already has an Asian slant, try adding a sprig or two of cilantro. Gives great flavor to chicken soup.

i have not made this recipe, but the likely problem is that a whole chicken will not impart much flavor...try using wings, backs, and necks instead (smae or a littel less weight as called for in the recipe...you can even ask your butcher for bones left over after deboning chicken parts). Chicken meat gives v little flavor (though some people like the boiled chicken that comes out of the broth)...it's the bones, fat and skin that give the flavor. Secret of some people's chicken soup: you have to use a little buillon anyway.

I made this for my family's seder. For the broth, I used a 4-pound chicken and a couple pounds of extra thighs. The broth came out great (very flavorful) and the lemongrass flavor was wonderful. Even after refrigeration, the matzo batter wasn't very stiff, but it cooked nicely and everyone loved the soup.

My family Loves matzo ball soup and we thought this would be a great replacement to the matzo soup mixes, but alas, we, too thought it was bland. Somehow, we envisioned something as tasty as Thai soup (Tom Yung soup)

I was all set to like this. Made it for my husband the night after Seder (had a heavy cold, thought I'd be a hero). It took hours and it was as bland as bland can be. I ended up adding lots of chicken bouillon so he had something to drink that didn't taste like "flavored water" (as he put it). Those who had a better experience--let me know what the problem was. I cooked it per the instructions (1 hr exactly) but there was no chicken flavor.

Made this as a replacement to the traditional matzo ball soup I usually make on Passover. My guests all loved the soup. The leftover chicken can be used in chicken salad or stir fried noodles.
