I only blanched the root veggies and the eggplant. It's best to have the others just grill, after sitting in the dressing for a little bit before grilling. I soaked the rosemary skewers for over an hour so that they wouldn't burn with the olive oil dressing. It made them a bit limpy wimpy but kept them from catching fire. They were delicious dipped in the hummus! Perfect to make for my veggie-only friend. I scarffed on fish as my protein.

I really liked this dish & so did my husband who usually doesn't eat Hummus.

important to use fresh veggies. Save the white bean dip as a spread on toasted or grilled crusty bread. I also upped the garlic in the white bean dip. I found it easier to skewer the veggies after I whittled one end of the rosemary stick to a point. We used this as a side dish and used the leftover chopped rosemary leaves to season the lemon chicken quarters that we also grilled. Very healthy, easy meal.
