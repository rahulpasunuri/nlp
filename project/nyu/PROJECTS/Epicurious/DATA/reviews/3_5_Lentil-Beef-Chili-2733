I am making this recipe for the first time. It has been simmering for about 3 hours now and the lentils are still crunchy--is this normal, or should they be softer? I have added quite a bit more water than called for in the recipe. I've never made lentil chili or soup before.

Pretty good! I added about three tablespoons of brown sugar to try and tone down the earthiness of the lentils. FYI, I halved the recipe and it was still EASILY enough for 4 people.

Very tasty, easy chili! Made it a bit healthier by using ground turkey breast and omitting parmesan and sour cream. Froze in individual servings and it was just as delicious reheated. Will make again... soon!

Really simple, I added a little cumin which did well for a smokier flavor. The cheese brings everything together nicely.

I omitted so much from this recipe that I can't give a true rating, but what I got was good (not unique). I used what I had on hand: 1.5# stew meat instead of ground beef, 1 cn tomatoes, tomato paste, lentils, no leek/extra onion, no green pepper, beef broth, no marjoram/basil and freshly grated asiago. This is a good basic for play and a nice switch from beans. I think 2, 28 oz cans of tomatoes would be too much (I used 1/4 of that). I'll try this as a veggie dish with butternut squah.

Delicious! Made a few changes; I had no canned tomatoes, leeks or green onions. Instead I added 4 white onions, 7 garlic cloves, about 1,5 pounds of boiled chopped potatoes, two bags of frozen pepper salsa and a bag of frozen corn. Added some tomatoe-chili spice mixture, left-over pasta sauce, a little ketchup and six chopped fresh tomatoes to make up for the canned tomatoes. I wanted to make this a bit spicy so I added more of the suggested spices in addition to some cumin, sweet chili sauce, curry, turmeric, pepper mix, paprika and a hint of ginger. Because of all the veggies I had to add way more liquid; beef and vegetable broth and a little light cream. Didn't bother with the cheese, served with light creme fraiche. I think the sour cream/creme freche (or Bulgarian yogurt) makes all the difference. Maybe I'll make this more of a winter veggie chili by adding carrots and cabbage next time. Soooo goooood, you just have to have more and more (my family had at least 3 helpings)! Perfect for a cold and rainy autumn night.

This was delicious. I changed up the recipe, using turkey instead of beef, and adding black beans, corn, carrots, celery, portabello mushrooms (not very traditional, but tasty) and additional chili powder. I used Hunt's crushed tomatoes which had the perfect amount of sweetness. I didn't add Parmesan, sour cream, or garlic (accidentally). Without the additional items, the chili may have been to soupy for my taste, as the person below complained. Besides the time it took to cut up all the ingredients, this was very easy to make and i will definitely make it again. My family loved it.

This recipe was a surprise. It tastes like spaghetti sauce, not chili. But it was good...just add some pasta.

Excellent and easy! Great flavor. Most of the time, I use ground turkey instead of the beef for a lighter meal. Always have to add water or chicken broth to the leftovers because there isnt enough liquid. Make this often in the cold fall and winter months.

Very nice. Hearty, easy, flavorful even without the peppers. Will make again.

This is THE BEST vegetarian chili. USE FRENCH GREEN LENTILS! It makes all the difference in the world! I did use vegetable broth & skipped the beef. I also cut the salt by half and didn't bother with the cheese + sour cream.

I make this chili all the time and even my kids ask for it. Cornbread makes the perfect side dish on a cold night.

Great Chili. What a great way to enjoy chili and get more nutritional benefits. I've made this probably 5 or 6 times over the past couple of years. It's always on my mind when I think of what to do with lentils, but then I have to write on my list to buy leeks. Don't omit anything unless you are making it vegetarian. The more veggies the merrier.

I disagree. Flatulence comments are always appropriate. Maybe there should be a rating pictogram like one thru four beans or poofs of gas--one being noneventful to four causing an evacuation of the house.

I used chicken broth instead of water, and since I didn't have canned tomatoes, I used canned salsa and tomato paste. I didn't have onions, but onion are in the salsa. Seems to be working! It's simmering now and smells great. Also, I soaked the lentils over night, just like my grandmother taught me to do.

Was the flatulence comment absolutely necessary? Come on!

This dish was very tasty and easy to make. I substituted chicken broth for the water so to add extra flavor. The chili was neither too thick or thin. The chili was highly enjoyable with a side of cornbread. We didn't experience the green onions & leeks flatulence issue of the prior reviewer. I'm not even sure why that would cause such a problem. I'm looking forward to enjoying the leftovers!

Not exactly an original dish but very tasty. I'd only suggest using either leeks or green onions but not both, as it obviously will cause flatulence (as it did with me the first time). The Parmesan is very good with it.

Left out the beef because I had all of the other ingredients and didn't want to go to the store. Accidentally used only 4 teaspoons of chili powder which was perfect with no beef. This is excellent! I just made it because I wanted to use my umpteen year old crock pot for the second time and make something that was healthy after indulging with house guests. What a surprise when it was delicious. Will definitely make again.

A great change from typical chili - very hearty and satisfying! I am also surprised how well this chili freezes and reheats in the microwave. The only change I made to the recipe was to add twice as much water - and it was still very thick. Will probably try with other combinations of ground meat - turkey, meatloaf mix (beef-pork-veal) and maybe even venison.

Very good, easy, nutritious and economical! The only change I might make the next time around is to decrease the chili powder a bit--maybe by 1/4th of a tsp. Otherwise, fabulous!

This dish is healthy and absolutely delicious. I used a whole minced jalapeno plus 1 tablespoon of chili powder. The cheese perfectly tempers the spice. This will become a standard in our house like bolognese.

This chili was DELICIOUS. I used half tomato sauce and half diced tomatoes with jalepenos but didn't use the chili powder cause it already had a good kick to it and with kids I didn't want too much. Would recommend!!!
