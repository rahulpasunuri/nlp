I had to cut this recipe down to serve two, and it still came out fantastic! It definitely needed to "set" for awhile after coming out of the oven (I may have miscalculated the broth/cream amounts) but it really tasted great. I managed to get my husband to eat turnips this way and he loved it.

PS- This recipe gets 2 forks for "good" because it doesn't elevate the challenging ingredient of turnips. If it did transform this ingredient well, then we would've given 3 forks. If it was a recipe that transcended the turnip, then we would've given 4. Depending on your love of turnips and access to varieties, we hope this helps you gauge the recipe. If it were only potato gratin - then the rating would be totally different matter. There are more palattable uses for some varieties of turnips, as there are more recipes for potato-only gratin. Truly, hope this helps.

OK. If you can't handle turnips or don't know about the varieties of turnips - avoid this recipe. Not because of the recipe but because turnips are the pig's ear of root veggies. If you don't love turnips but can find some mild varieties, this recipe will get the plate clean. If you love turnips and don't care if it's bitterish and rooty, then this is a great recipe. Finally, with all that cream, if you want a TWANG of heat, then up the cayenne. The only variation we made was that we sprinkled on cayenne as we poured each layer and even the eye-brow-raising Oops! spill as I sprinkled never amounted to a sweat in the final product. For those uncomfortable with spicy food, the proportions in this recipe will not make you sweat. We made two casseroles since we have a 1 and 2 year old. They got the basic recipe, we did the "sprinkled" and no one could accuse this recipe of being even mildly spicy for our respective pallattes. Enjoy. Turnips are a rustic pleasure, indeed.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I would have doubled the cayenne and black pepper, but that's personal taste, of course. We ate this with dungeness crab and it was perfect!

This is a great recipe as-written, but we liked the turnips in it so much that next time we plan to make it with all turnips and no potatoes. But either way it is wonderful and easy to make.

I disagree - it does get infuriating when people change a dish and then rate it. Change all you wish - but leave the rating blank. It is a disservice to anyone that wants to make or read about the real recipe. You can't review movies or restaurants this way so why should you review a recipe like this?

This is a delicious dish!! I used parsnips rather than turnips and was a total hit! My son-in- law who eats nothing besides the "basics" raved about this dish and actually requested it at our next family gathering. Naturally, I added more garlic as we are a garlic family and the cayenne is NOT even close to being overwhelming - just a nice touch!

I didn't think the turnips added much, and there are much better gratin recipes out there. My biggest complaint arose from my own carelessness: be forewarned, fellow cooks, that if you ignore the recipe, figuring that all gratins can be made in a 9x13 inch pan, you are wrong! I nearly burned the house down (exaggeration, but I did fill it with smoke), NOT what you want to do on Christmas night.

Lovely dish, but be forewarned that the quantity of cayenne gives it serious heat. In the future, I will follow the recipe for some guests, but greatly reduce the cayenne for others.

Oh my goodness, I think my husband and I had 4 servings each. I wanted to test it out before Thanksgiving and am now adding it not only to the Thanksgiving menu but to Christmas as well. I will make again but not too often as it has way too much fat in it. Of course that is why it tastes so good.

YUMMY! I halved the recipe and omitted the parmesan. Instead, I stirred 4oz of goat cheese into the cream sauce before adding in the potatoes and turnips and sprinkled on grated gruyere in the final step. This was a superb dish - a great way to make good use of spring turnips, which give this dish a nice peppery note. And, I will likely use the basic cream sauce again for "gratin-ing" other vegetables.

This recipe is amazing!! The turnips rather disappear (might add more next time) but give the potatoes a light and rich flavor that's wonderful. I used Asiago cheese for a bit more punch...and our guest had (count 'em) 7 servings!! :) This is lots of whip cream and calories but worth every bit of it and I wouldn't make it "healthy" for the life of me!

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner with Prime Rib. Everyone said it was the best gratin they've ever had . . . our houseguests requested the leftovers the next day for breakfast!
