The only way to make this is to take the advice of the reviewers and make additions to the soup. I added more chorizo (about 3/4 lb total), red pepper flakes and cilantro. Warning: the kale sort of looked like algae and my two younger children turned their noses up at it despite all the other ingredients that they would have eaten otherwise. All in all, an interesting soup but not worthy enough to go into our rotation.

Excellent hearty soup WITH a few additions. I took the advice of many and added paprika and cumin and diced carrots. I also added, more chopped garlic, Trader Joes smoked salt and instead of the chorizo sausage (not kosher!), I used "Tofurky Chorizo style ground meat (tofu). Visually this soup is stunning, and a great addition to my holiday meals, especially for the holiday of Sukkos when we'll be eating outside in the brisk night air.

We liked it a lot, but I think following the suggestions given by previous reviewers is necessary. As others advised I used at least a half pound of chorizo, browned first, and also added red pepper flakes, 1 full lemon's juice, cumin, smoked paprika and I also added a large handful of fresh cilantro. It is truly wonderful when you tinker a bit. Thanks to all for the great suggestions!

Made this last night for supper and it was delicious. I added a bit of turnip as well as the potato, because I had a fresh one on hand. Didn't put the sausage in and it was still a delicious soup that served as our main course meal. I did put in about 1/8 - 1/4 tsp of dried red pepper flakes to give it a bit of heat and that worked out very nicely. Might add some roasted red peppers or yellow zucchini next time for a bit of colour but all in all it was wonderful.

I didn't have chorizo so I substituted Insernio Italian chicken sausage, which was delicious but I think the soup was not as spicy as it would have been with the chorizo. So I added a some crushed red pepper as well as a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to each bowl. It was terrific

Made a few changes based on what I had on hand. Used purple (unpeeled) fingerling potatoes, a certain type of chard available here in Germany (Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris) and poultry sausage. Looked up spices for Spanish chorizo and added some oregano, chipotle chili powder (for a smoked flavor) and paprika. Also added a parmesan rind--an idea from another soup recipe on this site. Husband said it was one of the best soups he's ever eaten--and he's picky!

Really good starter soup. Healthy, quick meal.

This exceeded my expectations, really delicious and hearty. I made it vegetarian and added carrots and a whole bunch of cumin and smoked paprika and a bit of allspice. I also skipped the water and just used a 32 oz. container of veggie stock. Reducing the liquid made it a bit more like a stew. A satisfying and healthy dinner.

Excellent! Made this with a few minor changes. Used 1/2 lb chorizo and browned it first in olive oil. Added extra garlic and smoked hot paprika for a little more depth of flavor. Finely chopped the kale by hand without a problem.

My family loves this soup, and I make it regularly all winter. I use fresh chorizo, which I brown first and then, like some of the other reviewers, I cook the onions in the same pan. I also use a bit more stock than the recipe calls for. Otherwise, it's pretty much as written. Lovely!

Rating: 4
Like others I too cooked the onions, etc in the fat from the sausage I used. I used a spicy Italian out of the casing in chunks and it added a nice amount of heat generally to the overall dish. I chopped the kale instead of processing it, added a dash of red pepper flakes, cumin, and some chopped carrots, and this soup totally hit the spot. But what REALLY put this meal over the top was the leftover-cornbread-croutons I made by frying cubes of it in olive oil with a sprig of rosemary and a dash of salt. AMAZING!

Rating: 3
This was quick easy and delicious. Even better the next day so the flavors could really combine. The churizo really made the soup. Without the spices/seasoning from the sausage it would have been very bland. I think this is a great base and you could add just about any meat and seasoning to get a good flavor. I used sweet potato instead of white, I chopped the kale as I like the texture and I used what was listed in the recipe for chicken broth, but probably only about 1/2 cup water. I will definitely make this again.

I followed this fairly exactly and found the result dull and watery. Fortunately I have some cooking skills and a well stocked pantry so I was able to still turn out an edible dish in the end but it took a LOT of tweaking. if you ignored the 2 cups of water entirely and used a rich home made chicken stock I could see this being workable, but otherwise skip it!

Rating: 3
Overall very tasty, a great weeknight dinner. The only changes I made were: used fresh chorizo (not cured) so cooked it first then removed it, and cooked onion and garlic in the rendered oil. I also used twice as much chorizo as it called for. The longer the chorizo sits in the liquid, the softer its flavor becomes. And finally, I didn't think there was enough "soup" in the soup so I added an extra can of broth and cup of water. Otherwise, great. Made it for two friends tonight and they loved it!

Wow this sop is sooo good! I made it originally because it sounds just like the zuppa toscania soup that they have at olive garden only without the cream and i have to say its even better. I too sauteed the onions and garlic in the fat from the sausage and didnt need to use much olive oil at all. I finished the soup with a big heap of parm cheese and a big salad. Sooo good!

Tasty and filling soup. I pan-fry the chorizo first then remove it (to add later) and cook the onion and garlic in the chorizo juice. I also add some ground cumin and paprika to give the soup some extra spice.

Added some paprika and used chard and it was delicious. My husband couldn't believe how fast it was. Perfect for a weeknight meal and could easily be made vegetarian.

Good, simple soup, and easy to throw together. I followed the directions but left it vegetarian, then added a generous amount of Spanish hot smoked paprika. Next time, I'll add more garlic and more potatoes and add the chickpeas a bit earlier.

Ok soup. If I could I'd have shredded the kale as it was a bit too much for my liking. But it's an OK soup. Nothing exciting... I don't think I'll bother again.

I have made this soup several times, always with a few changes to reflect what I have on hand. For instance, I often use cheap mild italian sausage, which I brown in a dutch oven first and reserve in order to add near the end, allowing me to start the onions and garlic in delicious hog fat. This gives the soup a really appealing richness. Additionally, I always boil potato chunks separately, adding them near the end to preserve their shape and prevent the soup from becoming a starch bomb. I also roughly shred the kale because I like it to have more fiber and body. More garlic, red pepper flakes and paprika are never a bad idea either. All in all, it is a versatile, inexpensive recipe that yields an excellent, heart-warming soup. Highly recommended, especially for rainy or cold days.

I made a vegetarian variation on this recipe - added chickpeas with liquid from can, vegetable broth in place of chicken broth. The real secret was adding chorizo spices instead of the sausage - cumin, cardamom, paprika to taste. It was absolutely fantastic, and must more healthy than the chorizo version.

Very delicious! I really loved this--and the fact that it is healthy! I used italian turkey sausage instead of chorizo, and also added some crushed red pepper to it. I cooked it fully before adding it to the soup. Great soup!!!

Rating: 3
We thought this was great. My only word of advice is to be wait to adjust the seasoning until after you add the chorizo. Even though it's only in there for a few minutes, the flavor of the chorizo really alters the soup. Also, I used a container of 4 cups worth of chicken broth and just a cup or so of water, and it turned out great.

this is soooo good. i only used 1 cup broth and the rest water to avoid making it taste too much of chicken, and it worked great. it so comforting during the cooler fall days!

Such a wonderful soup! I used organic chicken, spinach and feta sausage, fresh kale from the garden, red onion, and replaced the broth with more water and scant bouillon. I also used several small red potatoes I bought at a farmer's market and couldn't have been more pleased with the results! It was great as leftovers as well.

OMG.. made this soup tonight and loved it. Husband did not like the texture of the Kale so next time I will use spinach. Yummy!

Seriously good, and I'm sure if you follow the recipe, it's even better . . . I made it with a mildly spicy chicken sausage, which I browned to "start" the recipe, before the onions. I didn't add the 2 c water and I didn't use a potato. I added my chickpeas early, at the pt where the recipe says to add the potato, to soften them up. I also added a tbs of red wine, a tsp of mustard seed and I put a large pinch of red pepper in with the onions and garlic. What else? Oh yeah, I didn't run the kale thru a food processor. This was delicious after I let it sit an hour or so at room temp, with the extra sausage grilled and eaten on top.

I thought this soup was excellent as well. I used some of the substitutions here-- turkey sausage (which had habenero peppers, a very goo addition), sweet potato, and less broth. I thought the combination came out fantastically. I think that carrots and regular potato would be better than sweet potato, but other than that, the soup is great. I also added a bit more pepper, garlic, and fresh rosemary to give it more flavor.

Rating: 2
I agree with the other reviewers who said that this soup was just okay. It gets better with age, but it's still missing something. Once again, I find myself wishing that I had read the reviews BEFORE making the dish, because I think that adding clam juice may have been a good idea. Parmesan grated on top may also help.

This soup was really tasty and easy to make. After the first serving I added another can of broth, sweet potato's, carrots and some red pepper. I substituted and used sweet italian turkey sausage, but used more than the recipe called for. I would make it again.

I was looking for a way to use the kale that came in my weekly organic produce delivery - thank goodness I found this recipe - it's a winner. Don't forget to pick up a loaf of crusty bread while you're at the market. As others have mentioned, all the great savory flavor comes from the chorizo, so keep that in mind if you're substituting. I used about 1/2 lb chorizo and will consider adding even more next time.

This is essentially a variation on caldo verde (Tuscan kale soup with chorizo, on this site) and since I love that, I also liked this. The chickpeas add a nice earthiness and texture. My kids cleaned their bowls. I used a half-pound of mild italian sausage links that I broiled in the oven before slicing and stirring in at the end. The chorizo I've been able to find locally has an overly strong smoky flavor that overwhelms this kind of soup so I actually prefer the milder sausage.

Since we do not eat pork our household we used turkey sausage. To give it the spicy kick that it needed we added some finely chopped pasilla peppers and extra garlic. Came out fabs and will be a regular in our household.

This is a really good and nutritious soup recipe. I made some modifications to suit my taste. I substituted fresh chopped pumpkin for the potato and regular smoked sausage for the chorizo. I also added some more seasoning to spice up the broth a little. It was bland when I tasted it so I added about 1/4 tsp. of Sazon Goya and 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme in addition to the salt and pepper. I also thickened the sauce a bit by adding some whole wheat flour that had been mixed with butter. It was delicious. Will definitely make again.

Loved it! Had everything in the cabinet or garden, and happened to have chorizo in the freezer from my favorite local pig farmer. The only thing I changed was I used a variety of both greens (kale, collards, chard) and potatos (yellow, red, and purple)...my soup was so colorful. I also added fresh rosemary which really added a nice aroma. Easy and lovely. Served with crusty bread and topped with good parmesean. delish!

I don't eat much meat, so I made this soup without ANY sausage or sausage substitute. My partner raved about it, while I thought it was just ok. If I made it again, I would try something different with the broth, which I thought was too bland. Of course, this is probably mainly because I left out the chorizo. Perhaps a bit of clam juice, as suggested by a previous reviewer, would help in this case.

We really liked this recipe. We did do a variation, however, because some of the ingredients were not available to us. We used cacciatore sausage instead of the chorizo (next time!!) and 10oz spinach instead of the kale. Also, we pureed about half of the chickpeas to give a thicker consistancy. Very tasty.

I made this for a friend who had a very sore throat - I was looking for something healthy but not too spicy and easy on the throat. It was quite tasty! As a vegetarian, I excluded the sausage, and because of the sore throat issue, pureed the soup before serving. The flavors came together well. I'd recommend it as a nice starter or with a nice crusty whole wheat loaf as a meal.

This is so easy and nourishing. I use fresh Herb & Garlic Chicken Sausage that I buy at Whole Foods, removed from the casing and sautéed with the onions and garlic. Makes a perfect cold night supper with crispy garlic croutons and a glass of Shiraz.

Excellent, and quite simple to make. I sauted the chorizo WITH the onions and garlic, so that the fat rendered would enhance the broth flavor. Then added the kale and potatoes and sauted a bit longer, before adding the broth. This is a perfectly light soup, with a lot of flavor -- if you use good sausage. I topped with some finely grated parmesan.

Soup is good but needed help. I went generous on sausage - three sausages or about 1/3 to 1/2 lb. - did not use low sodium broth, generous with kosher salt and ground pepper, then added 4T balsamic vinegar. Soup was great with these changes.

This is good, but it's much better if you cook the chickpeas from scratch, and then add to the soup. Use some of the cooking water for more body in the broth. I made it once from scratch and once with canned, and the difference was dramatic.

sorry, I re-posted because I initially didn't select whether I'd make again (since I wasn't really rating THIS recipe per se)... on the old site when you updated your review it cancelled out your last one. Oops. Oh well, I just didn't want to lower the "make again" numbers. If this sounds at all appealing to you, make this soup. Just be sure to add the clam juice! Happy cooking, all.

I make a soup just like this one... I use chourico (a portuguese chunky sausage) when I can get it, but the spanish chorizo would be great too (Goya is a good brand). I just wanted to share my secret -- a little splash of clam juice in the broth (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup). You won't be able to taste it, but it makes the soup taste *incredible*....

This is a delicious hearty winter soup. Be sure to use a good quality chorizo or kielbasa since much of the flavor comes from the sausage. I chose to chop the kale rather than mince it, which makes the soup more rustic.
