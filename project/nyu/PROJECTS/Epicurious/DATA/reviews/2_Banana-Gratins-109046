A real favorite as a kid though in no way would have called it a "recipe" back then. Just sliced bananas in half lengthwise, spread a little sour cream on, sprinkled with a little brown sugar. Ate just like that, no broiling. sGood use for green bananas vs very ripe ones.

My husband liked this; I didn't. Sounds like 50/50 but I won't be making this again. Eat a plain banana or slice one over some ice cream instead.
