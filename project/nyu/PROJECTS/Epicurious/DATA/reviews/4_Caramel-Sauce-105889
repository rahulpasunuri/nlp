I've tried a number of caramel recipies and this is my favorite. Everyone loved it and it stays slightly more pourable as it cools.

This was exactly the recipe I was looking for. I did not use a thermometer because I knew what color it needed to be already. Also, it took a little more than 10 minutes for my sugar mixture to starting turning colors quickly.

Made exactly as written, including bringing to 380 degrees. At the end, the temperature and color do begin to change quite rapidly. Delicious and relatively easy.

Wow this was sweet. I made it with the lyle's syrup and when I tasted it I almost gagged. I added an additional cup of cream to try to temper the sweetness. I won't use this recipe again.

Excellent caramel sauce for ANYTHING!!! Don't use a thermometer though - just take if off when it is golden. It gets dark very fast.

made per the instructions, At 360F the syrup started turning color and at 380F it looked like Bass Ale and added the cream and WOW! It's really good!

Excellent caramel sauce. I brought the candy thermometer to 350 and pulled it off the heat immediately for perfect results. I also used half salted and half unsalted butter and the caramel turned out amazing.

Very tasty but my first batch had a burnt taste, as the temp went from 350 to 400 degrees very quickly. Second batch was fine, as I was more attentive and removed it from heat as soon as it hit 380.

Oh wow. This is really, really good! I've never had better caramel sauce. And so easy too. I didn't use a candy thermometer; instead, I just let it boil till it reached a light to medium amber color. MMMMMMM! I'll make this recipe from now on for sure.

I too had attempted caramel sauce before trying this recipe and had a big mess. This turned out perfectly but I did not use a candy thermometer, I just waited until I saw that pale amber color. Also, I was already making it before I realized I had no heavy cream. I substituted evaporated milk, using 2 Tablespoons of melted butter and adding the milk to get 1/2 cup. It was wonderful! I poured it on top of an apple cheesecake and everyone loved it!!

Divine! I listened to the reviewer below about not using my candy thermometer and watched for the syrup to turn a light amber color and it turned out perfectly. I'm using it to top miniature cheesecakes. I think this will be my standard caramel sauce recipe from now on.

OK. I just finished making this for the second time. The first time I used my candy thermometer and tried to get the sugar syrup up to 380. I should have known better. The sugar burned (way, way before I even got near 380) and the caramel got poured down the drain. This must be a typo. Really. The second time, I left the candy thermometer in the drawer and used my eyes. I let the sugar syrup just start turning a pale amber. Then I added the cream. The mixture darkened as the cream bubbled (furiously) and turned a lovely rich amber. Success. This recipe makes a beautiful creamy, buttery, just-thick-enough caramel. I will certainly make this again, but I won't burn the sugar ever again when I make it.

Very good. I think the Americas Test Kitchen Caramel is SLIGHTLY better though.

Absolutely out of this world! It is indeed a versatile sauce and scrumptious. Of course, unlike the earlier poster, I live in the back woods of NYC in manhattan...I urge everybody to try it. I pour it over butter pecan ice cream.

This is an excellent, all-purpose caramel sauce. It's an extremely easy recipe and nearly failproof (just don't burn the sugar). The caramel flavor can vary from mild to intense depending on how long you cook the sugar, which makes it very versatile. It is thick enough for a dip if you warm it just a little, perfectly pourable if you heat it through. Delicious!

Thank you very much, Ms. Beranbaum, here in my town in Brazil we don't have industrialized caramel sauce available, so, your recipe came at the right time.

too much work what with commercial grades available
