Made these twice to rave reviews! Works out great just as written, sounds more complicated than it really is.

These were delicious waffles! I made a few adjustments to the recipe; I cut the sugar in half, subbed a 1/4 c. flour and added 1/4 c. wheat germ, used fresh ginger, and used almond milk. Superb! The buckwheat flour really adds a nice flavor. I made the yeast portion the night before and refrigerated, and they were fast and easy to finish the next morning. Next time I may add flax seed and add the fresh ginger right before making the waffles.

Wonderful recipe! And just an FYI to everyone about the egg white, it says in the ingredients list 6 egg whites, beaten ...so yes, they meant for them to be beaten when adding them in :-)

Over the span of 12 hours while preparing these waffles, I became increasingly certain that waffles, no matter how healthy or delicious, were not worth the trouble. These ones are! I even added some flax with the oatmeal, and they still came out crispy and fluffy. I will make them again and again :)

I've had this in my recipe box for a few years now but b/c of all the ingredients I don't usually have on hand, I've only just made it for the first time. It's very tasty and healthy too. I am pregnant so I need something to fill me up in the morning but the thought of most things makes me gag. The ginger eases my stomach and the almonds and yogurt adds the protein I need -- I use Islandic style yogurt for the higher protein content. I didn't beat the egg white before adding them but wish I had -- they didn't come out very crispy. I'll try that next time.

Very tasty. It yielded 10 waffles for me though -- my wafflemaker must be smaller than the one used in the test kitchen.

This is the staple waffle recipe in our house. It's an easy way to sneak some grains into your diet (or your husband and kids diets...) I've made them without ginger and they are good, too, but I added more sugar and nutmeg. But if I don't have candied ginger, then I use regular ginger (but only about a 1/8 cup) and add in a bit more sugar and fresh nutmeg. (I use a good quality brown sugar.) As another reviewer advised, it's really essential to beat the eggs whites until frothy and then fold in. Leftover waffles freeze beautifully - just pop them in the toaster. I also mix up a couple of extra batches of the dry ingredients and put into ziplock bags with a label so the next couple of times I make them, I can just focus on the other ingredients, which I find a good timesaver. The topping is great.

To the person below: Yes, you should be able to use it as pancake batter. You will need to add more soy milk and they will likely be thick and fluffy. Sounds like a good idea to me. Waffles always freak me out cause I can't evenly distribute things into the squares!

Absolutely Fabulous!

I have not yet made these... I have a question. I do not own a wafflw maker, could this batter be used to make pancakes instead?

These were the best waffles (but very untraditional). I liked them not sweet and earthy. Here are modifications that I made: I doubled the sugar, and whipped my egg whites until very foamy (not quite stiff thought) before folding them into batter. This made all the difference. The waffles came out crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. I don't think this dish would be successful if I put the mixed whites right into the batter as the recipe describes, thus I gave it 3 not 4 forks.

This recipie was the worst waffle recipe I have ever tasted! It is WAY OVER RATED and the soy milk and "candied" ginger were totally uncalled for! The realitives I made this for on Christmas morning were a little reluctant to try it, and after they tried it they told me never to make it again. It is a big hassle and not worth it in the end; I advise you never to make this recipe!

The batter didn't resemble waffle batter in the morning - I added more soy milk to loosen it up. My whole family loved the waffles, though.

Excellent waffles. I'm somewhat indifferent to the whole buckwheat-oatmeal-soy thing, but the candied ginger (minced with a garlic press for maximum dispersion) wins the 4 forks from me. Delicious.

A lot less sweet than regular waffles - much better. I agree that beating the egg whites a little more to make the batter lighter would improve it. But this made by the far the best-tasting waffles I've had - they actually had flavor and character and weren't the usual white flour and sugar bombs.

I made this for a group of freinds and we all loved them. The buckwheat adds a gentle, earthy flavor. They were especially good with fresh berries.

These are awesome! By far the best waffles, although we did alter the recipe a bit. We did not have crystallized ginger so we used regular ginger. No yeast--used baking powder. Turned out great. The flavor is wonderful.

Not really fair for me to rate. The whole from-scratch waffle thing seemed dreary, so I used a fat-free belgian waffle mix we like. However, the banana yogurt topping would have been a five-forker on its own. I added a couple of gentle shakes of nutmeg and a couple of shakes of allspice to the topping as written in the recipe.

Excellent! I did not have buckwheat flour so used whole wheat and it was great. Will try it with buckwheat next time ot compare. I will also try beating the whites more and folding them in to see if they can be a little lighter.
