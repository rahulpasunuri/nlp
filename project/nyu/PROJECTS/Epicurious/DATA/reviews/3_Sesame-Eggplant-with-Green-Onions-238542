Made as directed, but using a grill pan on the stove. Very disappointing and bland. Will not make again.

Easy and really good. Loved all grilled eggplant, and this is an excellent sauce.

Edible but bland. Nope, won't do again.

I broiled instead of grilling and served it with goat cheese. Delicious!

I only had one green onion, so I substituted some chopped red onion and few chives. I spread on the sauce as directed and grilled it on med-high for 4 minutes a side with no extra basting, and it came out wonderfully. I'm going to use the leftover in a sandwich with humus and tomatoes.

Basting the eggplant throughout the grilling process definitely helps add to the flavor. The sauce is great ... not an overpowering onion taste at all, which I was concerned about.

Delicious! I followed the recipe as written, except I dabbed the leftover green onion sauce on top of the grilled eggplant. It wasn't too onion-y and very easy since it can be done ahead.
