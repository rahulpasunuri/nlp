Such an amazing recipe! I exchanged the corn for another pound of squash, the water for chicken stock, and the lemon grass for the zest from an entire lemon. I added some extra pepper and a tablespoon of nutmeg then blended. I did not strain after I blended it to keep it nice an thick, yummy! In a separate pot I boiled some dandelion greens, strained and added them to the soup. Instead of treating cilantro as a garnish, I added about 1/8 cup chopped per serving. So good!

I added some nutmeg, cayenne pepper and a dash of lemon juice and it took this recipe to the next level. Yummy!!

My 13 year old found this recipe and insisted we make it. I was skeptical given the limited ingredients, but it was excellent. We made it just as described and used an immersion blender. Really excellent!

I used this recipe more as a guide than a strict recipe. I was looking for a good pumpkin soup recipe where I could use some leftover pumpkin from making a pie. And it just so happened I also had some left over lemongrass, so this was perfect. I didn't use nearly as much pumpkin as the recipe called for, and I just added corn until it looked like a good amount. It was probably much more watery than what the soup is supposed to be but it was still good. I also added two stalks of lemongrass. As other users have mentioned, I decided to mix in broth instead of plain water. I would definitely make it again.

I haven't tried this soup, but to the person who complained about "soapiness" - I heard on NPR that a small number of people consistently complain about soapiness when they eat dishes containing cilantro.

I'm very pleased with how this recipe came out- however it needs 2 to 3 times the amount of lemongrass listed. The dish also does well with a slight dusting of paprika on top before serving.

I thought this was excellent. A nice combination of flavors. I substituted chicken broth for the water and added a teaspoon or two of fresh ginger at the beginning with the onions. I think the lemon flavor came through plenty-- I had bought an actual lemon in case I wanted to add some juice (as per the reviews saying it wasn't lemony enough), but I didn't use it. I blended the soup but didn't strain it (I don't mind a textured soup and it's less work). Make sure to take out the lemongrass before you blend, though. I didn't think the cilantro was necessary, and I might have even liked it better without.

I've made this soup several times. I use two fresh stalks of lemongrass and I take the lemongrass out before blending with my immersion blender. This is a simple, quick, delicate soup that I enjoy on occasion. It is a good starter for a more bold and flavorful meal, or good for lunch/snack the next day.

Lovely indeed if tweeked. It does indeed need stock instead of water and a few of the condiments that have been suggested (ginger, garlic and oyster sauce). Don't go crazy on addons though or you will kill the lovely subtle blend of the original ingridients.

Excellent soup!It has a very nice taste. Next time I'll use more lemongrass ans less corn.

I don't know why I didn't listen to the reviewers. I make so many soups that I guess I thought I could rescue any soup recipe. I used 5 lemongrass stalks from my garden and still couldn't taste the lemongrass. This is more of a corn soup that the settlers would've made because they didn't know how to combine new world ingredients yet than anything Asian. If you insist on making it anyway you could add coconut milk, ginger, and some Kaffir lime leaves and have a completely different recipe but I was too irked to go there.

The recipe as is is bland, I can see how it could benefit from ginger and broth. I felt the recipe called for too much water, I didn't use all of it to blend and then felt as though I had lost even more flavor.

Overall, I was unimpressed by this soup. It wasn't terrible, but I can think of better uses for all of the ingredients.

yum! great soup, and so simple. i had no lemongrass, but a squirt of lemon juice brightened things up. also, i roasted the squash first. the second time i made this, i added roasted red peppers. good, too.

To the reviewer who suggested that perhaps one would not strain the soup -- this would be outrageously bad if it were not strained -- the lemongrass ends up in unchewable strands, and it definitely has to be strained well. As a result of the multiple posts about "soapiness", I too added some garlic, ginger, and nam pla (only drops), and also used chicken broth instead of water to add to the flavour. Worked out well!

This soup was yum! Although, We had to use frozen Squash, and our blender broke, we made it out. It was perfect except for the making of it. But the reward, Fabulouso!

A nice twist on the usual butternut squash soups. The lemongrass is very mild, but the squash and corn alone add up to a delicate yet delicious flavor. I didn't have cilantro, but I added about a teaspoon of fresh minced ginger (a common partner to lemongrass) in the beginning with the onions. I also only used 2 tbs oil and no butter.

This was a bland soup. I might make it for weekday lunch but it I made it to start a holiday meal and it was just too blah. I went to great lengths to get fresh lemongrass and then could barely taste it.

Delish! Served at a holiday dinner party. No need to strain. We garnished with toasted pumpkin seeds (pepitas) and chopped cilantro. Rave reviews from all!

Excellent, very easy-to-make soup. Even easier if you skip putting it through a sieve. I'd recommend using an immersion blender if you have one.

This soup was amazing!!! I used kabocha squash, frozen corn and replaced the butter with oil. I also pureed the soup with a hand blender very thoroughly, and did not strain it afterward. The soup was incredible. Pureed soups tend to taste like a blend of vegetables to me when that's what they are; in this soup, you could easily taste all of the components of the soup. I could distinguish a mixture of flavors that went really well together. It was a beautifully delish addition to my Thanksgiving meal, and it's now a regular in my eveyday menu rotation.

This went over very well in the whole family including some of the kids - which is unusual for a vegetable soup by us. I found the taste bland so I added about 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice and about two teaspoons ground ginger and was pleased with the results. Can anyone tell me the reason the recipe calls for cooking the onion and grass in oil with 1/2 tsp salt in the first step. What does the salt do for the process? Have already made it twice and my husband loves it.

Pretty good but a little soapy and sweet. I used chicken stock since just water sounded a little plain. I also added a little fish sauce to combat the soapiness. A nice change from regular old pumpkin soup.

Really great! Wonderful, rich flavors + easy to make. My boyfriend loves it! I plan on making it again for Thanksgiving.
