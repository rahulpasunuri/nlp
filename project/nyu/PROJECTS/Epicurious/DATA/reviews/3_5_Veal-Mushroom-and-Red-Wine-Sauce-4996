Quick, easy, inexpensive and delicious -- what more could you want? The guys at my house loved this dish. I was out of cornmeal, so I served this over pasta, but next time I'll try the polenta suggested in the recipe.

I have made this sauce at least 10 times in several variations and it is delicious. It's much better with ground veal (rather than ground beef) if you can get it and a quality red wine. The aroma is so appetizing, my s.o. can't wait to eat ! It's also great the next day !

This was a hit with the men in my household. The aroma of the sauce during preparation (which was EASY) drove them crazy. My fiance even wanted leftovers the next day (the sure sign that he loved the dish).

An acceptable, quick pasta sauce. Nothing spectacular.

I love this as a winter or fall comfort food. Excellent flavor. I didn't feel it needed any more zip at all.

This was pretty good (the leftovers were better). Needs a zip though. Tobasco was good on it.

It's almost summer here and I realize from the other great reader comments that this isn't, in its pure form, a very summery dish, but I still wanted to try it so substituted the mushrooms for carrots and celery, which did in fact give the recipe just a slightly lighter touch. Maybe not light enough to serve on the porch in July, but still fine by me.

This recipe was published just after our return from the Italian Alps where we sat in the sun with our ski boots kicked off and enjoyed a wonderful dish of polenta and meat flavored sauce while looking over a valley bathed in sunlight. I found that the recipe was perfect as written; the only substitution I made was to use a meatier mushroom (such as shitake or portabella). Add a salad of arugula and radicchio sprinkled with lemon; crusty bread and robust red wine for a great winters dinner.
