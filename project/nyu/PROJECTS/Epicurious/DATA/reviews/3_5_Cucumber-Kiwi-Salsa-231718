I made this with shallot and cilantro instead of red onion and mint. I didn't have ginger, but it still had a bright flavor. I used the new golden kiwis which together with the cucumber and jalapeño, make a lovely bouquet for the eye as well as the mouth! Another reviewer is spot on that it's best eaten immediately. Veggie, vegan, and delicious.

Very good! I made it with chicken breast and it went very well, a friend of mine used it with tilapia! Both were delicious! My only problem was the units in the recipe made too much for me to use before it went bad :( I should've watched closer! But it was totally worth every min. I spent making and eating it!

Very good when fresh though didn't hold that well so might be advised to make only what you'll use right away. But the clincher is that it took 30min to make. There are other salsas that are just as good that go together faster.

I have mint in my garden and am always looking for uses for it. This was so delicious; can't wait for garden cucumbers. I'll be making this salsa quite often during the summer. I served it with simply grilled sea scallops -- what an easy summertime dinner.

Very fresh tasting as is. But I added garlic and fresh cilantro. I will make it again.

I could eat this all by itself, three times a day!!!!!!!

A yummy, eye-appealing salsa with a good balance of sweet and tart with spicy undertones. The fresh mint was a refreshing addition which enhanced the other flavours. A lovely complement for grilled prawns. Enjoy!
