Good dish. I used Camembert and hot sauce, and rolled the stuffed okra in egg and corn meal--then fried the poppers in safflower oil. My wife loved the combo. And it's not nearly as much work as it seemed at first.

Very easy. I made it with Jalapeno Peppers instead. It was pretty tasty and quick.

This can be a bit of work. Be sure to use tender okra. I found it easier to cut the tops off and stuff them or cut a plug out of the side, stuff it and replace the plug. They are tastey but not a quick dish.
