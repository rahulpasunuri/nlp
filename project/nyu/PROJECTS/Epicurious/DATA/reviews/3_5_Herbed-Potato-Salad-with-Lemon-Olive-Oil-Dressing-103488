Just love this. The main thing is the tang. Herbs and additional vegetables optional.

Excellent. I started with just one teaspoon of salt and that was plenty.

This is a wonderful light alternative to traditional potato salad. As suggested by other reviewers I used basil in place of the oregano and added a couple tablespoons of fresh parsley. Surprised how well the mint blended in had expected it to stand out but just added a little zing. We loved it and plan to make again.

Everyone really enjoyed this potato salad. A nice change with all the herbs. I added 1/4 c of mayo, 2 cloves of minced garlic and substituted the oregano with basil. The garlic and mayo made a huge difference!

Made this without the red peppers (just didn't have them), and it was superb. A perfect accompaniment for any summer main dish.

I have made both this recipe and the potato salad with mint and peas, and I much prefer this one. I served it last night for guests, and it was a big hit. If the lemon is too overpowering for people, I recommend substituting 1/8 cup with cider vinegar.

I just made this for a family gathering. I personally am not a big onion or red pepper fan, but I LOVED this salad. It had great flavor, but might use a pinch less salt than the recipe calls for.

One of the best potato salads I have ever had. I was VERY skeptical about the mint, but it didn't overpower. Really really good! I also added some flat leaf parsley, too, to up the herbs. Nice and light, good warm or cold. I often toss it with tuna and eggs and beans for a great lunch the next day. This stuff's just great.

Made this for a pot-luck and everybody liked it but no one raved about it. I brought the remainder home and ate it all myself so I must have liked it, eh?

Excellent dish ... light and refreshing ... and even my husband who doesn't like mint ... liked it. A nice change from my standard basil or dill with potatoes!

Very nice! I don't like oregano in salad so substituted fresh, chopped basil. Quite a lot of flavour for such a simple recipe. Perfect for summer.

This is an excellent side dish that has a way of quickly becoming the main dish.

Light & flavorful side dish, the lemon and mint make all the difference. I've substituted basil for oregano - either one work great - don't skimp on the mint. Yukon golds work especially well too. Great recipe!

Not having fresh oregano on hand, I used a mixture of fresh Cilantro,Dill and Parsley.A great and easy salad to prepare.

What a wonderful change to mayonnaise based potato salad, especially on a hot summer day! I'm not a mint fan so I left it out and added 1 tbl of wholeseed champagne Mustard (mixed with the oil) instead. It was a great hit and has been added to my personal recipe collection.

This is a nice, light potato salad. Unless you really like Oregano, cut back on the amount or it will overpower the recipe. I chose to add a little more lemon juice and sliced, cherry tomatoes. Excellent!

A nice change from mayo-ed potato salads. I went a bit light on the oregano (probably one tablespoon of fresh) but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter, and found my guests having earnest conversations about how good the potato salad was. Everyone I cook for knows I use Epicurious as a source for recipes, but this was the dish that made them ask for the web address.

I substituted roasted red pepper and it added an excellent flavor! We ate it all in one night.

Wonderful, fresh flavors, light and summery recipe. Everyone thought it was fantastic and gobbled it down in one sitting! Definitely would make it again.

Light, summery version; I thought the flavors were terrific; the colors are pleasing as well. I used un-peeled red baby bliss potatoes, quartered. A very easy dish to prepare and a crowd pleaser.

This is very refreshing on a hot summers night.

I believe you are looking for the Roasted Potato, Garlic, & Red Pepper Salad found in Gourmet, 7/97. Do a search on this site and you will find the recipe.

Regarding the comments from A Cook from New Haven, CT: Where can I find a copy of the roasted potato salad with balsamic vinegar?

Maybe I just don't like fresh oregeno as much as I thought I would, but I thought this salad was a bit of a dud. It's easy enough to make, but it wasn't very popular at the picnic where I took it: I came home with over half of it uneaten! A better potato salad is the "roasted potato salad" with balsamic dressing on the Summer Sides BBQ page: that was a huge hit at our house.
