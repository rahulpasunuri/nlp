Awesome recipe! I exactly had 2 fennel bulbs so this recipe was perfect. I didn't feel like opening a can/box of chicken broth for such a small amount, so I used white wine instead. Magnificent!

This was so simple and utterly delicious! I was feeling a little naughty so added a splash of thickened cream, once the stock was reduced right down, to make it a teeny bit more decadent and it was divine. Absolutely wonderful without the cream though, will use this regularly as the hubby adored it too...

added a few shallots left from another recipe and cooked it down until there was no liquid. Really easy and elegant for a week night. Made with veal chop.

I love this recipe. It is so simple and so delicious! But, to make it even better, follow recipe as directed, then move fennel to a baking dish (including any remaining liquid), sprinkle with shredded parmesan cheese and put under the broiler till cheese is melted. Heavenly!

I love fennel and now I love love braised fennel! This is glorious and so easy, I followed the recipe exactly this time, and it was great; sure i'll try variations later, but can not beat just how it is!

My wife has asked me to do a simple fennel vegetable dish to experience the pristine fennel flavor. I choose this one and followed the recipe precisely using my own homemade chicken broth. It was excellent and definitely a keeper. Make sure to use a large enough pan to carmelize all the fennel as it adds depth to the flavor.

Excellent. I didn't change a thing except eliminate the salt since there was enough in the low sodium chicken bouillon I used. Added bonus: the trimmed stalks are great to eat raw!

Very easy to make as a side dish. I wouldn't recommend it as just one large side dish for a meal, but to complement other side dishes for a Thanksgiving or holiday meal it is delicious in small doses.

I changed this recipe a bit and it was delicious. I did not use the salt because I added a full cup of chicken broth instead of the water that was called for. Pleasant taste.

Great! I topped this with bread crumbs toasted in butter and served it as a light lunch - yummy.

Very good, easy and needs minimal supervision. Would definitely make it again.

I didn't make this myself, but I was at a dinner party and helped my host make this recipe. It was simply unbelievable. All it takes are some simple, fresh ingredients. Combine, and the taste is fantastic! It's a great side with chicken, but be aware that the taste is also extremely strong - stock gives fennel a taste as strong as it gives to risotto.
