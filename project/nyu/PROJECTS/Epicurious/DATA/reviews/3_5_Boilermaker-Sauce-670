My two sisters favorite sauce. I've made this several times for different groups of friends - always to excellent reviews. Easy to make and great taste. I've made sauce with chicken, pork, beef - all tasted great.

A tasty BBQ sauce that met with approval in a house full of bachelors. Great as an overnight marinade or a last-minute brush-on sauce, it's also a good use for a can of cheap beer!

I enjoyed this sauce a lot. It's easy and (the best part of all) it can be made well in advance of the time you need it. Great for entertaining.

I've made this recipe a couple of times--once for hamburgers; once for chicken breasts. I marinated the chicken in some of the sauce for a few hours and then brushed the rest on. A yummy and easy sauce for the grill!
