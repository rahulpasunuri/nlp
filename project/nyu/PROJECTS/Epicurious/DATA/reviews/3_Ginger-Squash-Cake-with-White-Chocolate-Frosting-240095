This was interesting, but not a keeper for me. It made a very moist cake with a nice blance of flavours (I stuck with the recipe as written). I would omit the 1/2 c of hazelnuts in the cake and just stick with the 1/4 c as a topping (too crunchy overall). Also, believe the recipe when it says to use good quality white chocolate for the topping - the white chocolate is totally exposed in the frosting.

I had to make the following changes which I think actually helped make this cake so tasty: Baked squash in advance and simply scooped out flesh. Doubled recipe and made in 13 x 9 pan Used pecans instead of hazelnuts Didn't have fresh ginger so added extra ginger powder. Icing wasn't worth effort - lots of better frosting/icing recipes out there.

it was good. I used left over squash. I'm not sure I would make again. Didn't WOW.

A tasty cake, but the prep is kind of a hassle - grating the squash, ginger, etc. Not sure it is worth the effort. Also, the frosting was really a glaze when I made it - didn't hold very well on the cake.

This cake is outstanding! The (ground and fresh) ginger really elevates the flavor and the white chocolate frosting (glaze) is the perfect compliment. I had just enough leftover to roast, puree and use for the butternut squash risotto w/cornmeal shrimp.

Delicious cake, I added about 1/2 cup of chopped crystalized/sugared giner, and then used half the amount of powdered ginger.
