fyi - for the tangerine peel, you can buy a fresh tangerine a few days in advance, peel it and let the peel dry out. This is what the dried tangerine peel is in Chinese recipes!

This recipe takes about 1.5 hours to make. I found it on epi by searching for "stir fry" so I was expecting something quicker. The flavor is good--think teriyaki. I had to skip the tangerine peel--couldn't find it. Nice meal for a cool fall evening. Simple, although time-consuming.

Excellent. This is definitely a keeper. It took a while to find dried tangerine peel, but the search seems to have paid off. Even my wife who doesn't like anise enjoyed this dish. So, what *do* we do with the frozen let overs? ;-)

This is a great recipe. I cook it in a Chinese Clay Pot, I added some whole canned Bambo Shoots to the pot. The chicken turns out so moist and tender with that citrusy soy anise taste that is so wonderful.... A quick stir-fry of Vegetables and some rice and you are set to go. And to the last reviewer, Yes freeze the broth and you can use it to cook another chicken and it is even BETTER !!!

And what are we to do with the frozen "broth"? Is that to cook another chicken in?
