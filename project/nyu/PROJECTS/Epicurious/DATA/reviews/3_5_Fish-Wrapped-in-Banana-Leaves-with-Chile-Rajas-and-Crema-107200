This was my first time using banana leaves--so fun.

Some notes on the recipe: Since Mexican crema is difficult to find, a close analogue is sour cream mixed with a bit of milk (to thin it), some salt, and lime zest. Banana leaves are available frozen from all of my local Asian markets (C Mart and H Mart are two big chains that carry them).

This was a great meal to serve in Mexico since we have banana trees in the garden. It was wonderful made with fresh Dorado fish caught locally. I did add a pat of butter before I wrapped it up and served it with rice. The package makes a nice presentation and lots of tasty juices flow onto the plate. Delicious!!

This wasn't very good. It took a lot of work for what was basically a steamed fish. The onions and chilies were good, but I wouldn't make it again.
