I gave this only 2 forks. It was good. Boyfriend liked it. I used about 1/4 oil and 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup of water. It just wasnt very interesting. Still was too oily I thought. The bread made it worthwhile. I probably should have used more tomatoes to get more liquid. It really made only two bowls of soup. Boyfriend said he would have let it cook longer but I dont know - I was scared of the liquid just boiling off. All my ingredients were from the farmers market so it was refreshing, but.. I would make this again with a lot more tweaking. Reminded me more of a tortilla soup.

This soup is perfect for a cold. I used a lot less oil, added an onion and used chicken broth instead of water. Very flavorful, spicy and healthy tasting.

I added some leftover roasted chicken for protein and about 10 pitted, drained and chopped kalamata olives. I thought there was too much oil called for in this recipe and will decrease the amount next time. The flavor was great - but the oil issue kept this one at 2 forks. Anyone else have the same problem?

What a great soup! I made it with fresh tomatoes from the garden, added fresh basil, heeded others' advice and added a can of garbonza beans (the only kind that I had on hand). Next time I might also add sweet potato.

To the gentleman in Germany I say if you did not want vegetable taste then why pick a vegetable dish. The soup alone makes an excellent addition to my eggplant.

This is a yummy quick recipe...my tweaks: added a can of white beans for protien, a handful of basil and parmesaen to top...wonderful! Might even add *more* garlic next time.

I was a bit skeptical after reading other reviews with their descriptions of all the doctoring this recipe needed. However, I made it and mostly followed the recipe to the letter, adding just one other tomato and a chicken boullion cube (because the other critics scared me!). It was a fantastic soup. The bread really made a difference (more texture), but the flavor was great and it got rave reviews from my friends and family. The leftovers were also delicious! Go for it!

In thirty years of cooking, this was the worst recipe I've ever followed. Maybe the tomatoes in Germany aren't that good, but this tasted like water with raw garlic. After I added beef bouillon (lots) , tomato puree, dried basil, and a little cream at the end, it turned into a really nice soup, and my guests raved about it!
