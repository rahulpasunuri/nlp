This is delicious! The point here is to emphasize the beautiful fresh greens, not the dressing. If your idea of a good salad includes ranch dressing, you should look elsewhere perhaps. If not, I urge you to try this...you won't be disappointed.

You call this a recipe? Tossing lettuce with a vinaigrette? C'mon, get real.
