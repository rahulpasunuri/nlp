Tasted exceptional and I will definitely be making again. I like lots of sauce with my mussels so I doubled the amount of wine and cream and added a few more threads of saffron. In terms of preparation, I found the recipe to be more complicated than necessary. Keep it simple by making this a one-pot meal. Soften the leeks in a large stock pot, then stir in a tablespoon of flour which will help thicken the sauce later. Add the wine, mussels, parsley sprigs and saffron; cook on high until the mussels open. Next, stir in the cream then divvy the mussel and broth mixture into individual serving bowls; garnish with minced fresh parsley. As a side dish I served fresh tagliatelle pasta with crushed vine tomatoes, shredded fresh basil, and fresh buffalo mozzarella. Yum.

I used this recipe when it first came out, and the people at the party, where I served them, are still raving about "those mussels"

48 mussels is around 3 pounds for me. The saffron taste wasn't strong; next time I'll add a bit of fennel. Definitely do add a generous amount of pepper and salt. I also added 2 shallots, which helped with the texture. You may be tempted to cook the leeks and mussels concurrently. Don't do this! Instead, make sure the leeks get done before the mussels, because you'll want to dump the mussels into the sauce right after the mussels are done so that they don't dry out. I served this on top of store-bought frozen french tries.

I could not find Saffron threads so I substituted 1/8 teaspoon saffron powder with good results. Will definitely make again.

Incredible! I served this with toasted Italian bread as an appetizer and I have been thinking of it ever since. I want more!

I've made this dish several times and it always is delicious. Added fresh tarragon instead of parsley and just a touch of Pernod. It's a nice and light dinner with a salad and crusty bread to sop up all of the sauce. Yum!

Have made this many times for various friends - always outstanding. Substitued thyme for parsley - positively devine! I serve with good french bread and a manderin/walnut salad. Raves from all. Enjoy!

Yummy! Rich and hearty. All you need is a bottle of chilled Chardonnay and some crusty bread and it's a complete meal.

This is a wonderful. I intended to impress my boyfriend and I did. I put only one leek and it enhanced the saffron flavor. A WONDERFUL RECIPE, TRY IT

Made this recipe for the first time for a New Year's Eve dinner for a few guests. Loved it! Turned out perfectly the first time. Easy and delicious. I served it as an appetizer with some crusty bread and good dark beer. We had penne in a tomato, pancetta, basil sauce as the main. Great combo, have made it many times since!
