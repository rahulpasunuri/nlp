I make this every year for Thanksgiving and they are a big hit. I get up extra early to get them done ahead of time. They are perfect as an appetizer before the main meal and with the meal as well. Last year I made the mistake of brushing too much water on the rolled breadsticks and they didn't crisp up like I prefer, so this year I was less liberal with the water and they were perfect.

They were good but I had to add alot more flour than recipe called for. The folding method is not needed and causes very irregular shaped bread sticks. Flavor was great.
