Good way to use fresh pink-eyed peas.

This was quite tasty but VERY salty! I could not find fresh black eyed peas and used some canned beans (low sodium) so that probably contributed to the overall sodium count a bit but if I make this again I will also use low sodium chicken broth and skip the salt on the onions. Also, I feel like this would be great over some rice or even some pasta and will probably make that with it next time as well.

I loooove this recipe! It's incredibly easy to make, as I've made some alterations to the ingredients based on what my supermarket has. I can only imagine how much better it would be with the correct sausages!! I've made it again and again and again. It's a fairly healthy alternative to boring dinners, as there is meat and veg (no carbs!) and the only fat is from the sausages.

This was really good. Great flavor! And it cooked in less than 30 minutes. I had fresh beans, tomatoes and thyme from our garden and found fresh black-eyes at the market. I thought I'd try this recipe and am so glad I did as I'll keep this one and make it again. Great!
