Really good, in large part because the flounder was fresh from the farmer's market. I used some old challah to make the bread crumbs, which I've never tried before but worked great. Didn't have any red bell pepper but the mayo was still very tasty.

This was the ultimate in bland. I made the mayo with roasted peppers and the rest as written. The fish was crispy and cooked fine but again, tasteless. It was like dipping someting void of flavour in to a mayo jar. Threw it out. No family members liked it.

I made changes suggested in other reviews panko, roasted red peppee and also used cilantro instead of chives in sauce. There is lots of sauce left over but I'm sure I'll find some use for it. ;-)

I made this and it was wonderful. What is even better, the leftover fish reheated wonderfully in the toaster oven (minus the mayo.) The was easily as good as the day originally fried...the panko did it, I think. For the red pepper mayo, I processed most of a 7.25 jar of roasted red peppers, and then proceeded as written, with the addition of one minced garlic clove. I used some of the mayo on black bean "steaks" from Costco, and everyone loved them. Try it!

Although I found this to be acceptable, my family was not real impressed-especially after the other reviews-we found this recipe tasteless-maybe I should have added more cayenne pepper to add flavor-I made the recipe as stated-I also used tilapia

Like others, I roasted the red pepper and peeled it. I can't imagine the recipe would be as good with an unroasted pepper, and why would you drain it. A fantastic and easy meal.

I made this with roasted red peppers w/low fat mayo, panko breadcrumbs, olive oil and just a bit of butter as a low-fat alternative. The red pepper sauce has a great flavor paired with the fish! Definitely a keeper

Delicious! This recipe is definately a keeper. The longer the mayo sits in the fridge, the better. Served with mashed potatoes and asparagus; not one bit of fish was left! Used the left- over mayo to make a tuna salad sandwich- loved it!

The fish was excellent. I did run out of the egg wash so I will double that for next time. I also made the mayo with artichokes as another reviewer suggested.

What I did differently - used low fat mayo, roasted red peppers, no chives but minced garlic instead - delicious sauce. I used tilapia and the only thing different with the fish, was to use panko crispy bread crumbs. Overall the dish was very good and I would use for company.

Delicious! A very good weeknight meal. This can be done in under 20 minutes. I steamed some asparagus to go with it. Had extra red pepper mayo and used if for grilled chicken sandwiches the next day.

This is a really nice way to do sole. I didn't have a red bell pepper on hand, nor any jarred. But I did use a jar of marinated artichoke hearts instead, and that worked great. Try it!

I also used very very thin filets of flounder. I used regular bread crumbs with a few spices mixed in. I wish I would have used panko. I found the sauce to be amazing, but as with all mayo sauces...it needs time to set. When I first made it, it tasted like flavored mayo...30 minutes later, much better...next day, fantastic. Make it early, you will not regret it. Also, I used roasted bell peppers...really made a nice touch to the sauce.

Fabulous with Panko bread crumbs. So crunchy. I'm sure it would be good with regular crumbs. I also thinly spread some sour cream on the fish before dipping into flour to get rid of the fishiness. I used flounder fillets that were cut very thin. A bit thinner than I'd prefer. I could care less about the sauce after I used the panko crumbs. I put spices in the egg mixture. A teeny tiny bit of Cayenne pepper in the egg batter. I didn't have chives, only parsley, so the sauce wasn't exact. Lemon wedges helped. I'll probably make this again Tuesday or Weds. Served with steamed Fennel & Shitake mushrooms, and butter & Salt.

We used ling cod and it was great with the fresh breadcrumbs. The red pepper mayonnaise was okay and added to the 'look', but the fish would be fine with just lemon wedges.

I made this with panko instead of fresh breadcrumbs and it was the most perfect crust ever!! The mayo was great on the fish!

Absolutely fabulous. The red pepper mayonnaise is a great compliment to the fish. I paired it with baked asparagus that was seasoned with olive oil and italian seasoning and it went perfect. Definitely making it again

Absolutely fabulous. The Mayo makes this dish. So fantastic it is my new dish to serve to company. I only had Panko and this made the fish super crispy!

OMG. This was wildly easy and so delicious and looked so elegant. I just diced the bell pepper which gave the mayonnaise an nice texture (my kitchen machine is broken). And I admit I seasoned the fish and then dragged it through fresh breadcrumbs. The thicker breading is just too heavy for me. But it was lovely. Had Scallops with Csesson salad, Asparagus risotto and this. A real keeper.My husband and friends all raved.

I love sole, and thought my first bite of this recipe was a tad bland, UNTIL I tasted it with the red pepper mayo. It absolutely makes the dish!

I used Sourdough bread to make the breadcrumbs and even my young children liked this!
