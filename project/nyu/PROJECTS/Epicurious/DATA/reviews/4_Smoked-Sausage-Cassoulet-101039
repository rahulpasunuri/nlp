Absolutely delicious! I just made two changes... I substituted skinless, boneless chicken thighs (about 4-6 pieces, approximately 1-1/2 lbs) for some of the sausage. The only other change I made was to 1/2 the amount of cloves.

I cut down on some of the ingredients as follows and we STILL had enough for at least 6 servings: 1# andouille; 2 leeks; 1 can great northern beans; 1 can butter beans (instead of limas); 1/4 tsp cloves; 2 Tblsp tomato paste; and for topping: 2Tblsp olive oil, 2 c bread, 2 medium tomatoes, and added some garlic powder. Kept all other ingredients as stated in the recipe. Because you lose the "crunchiness" of the topping when reheating the leftovers, I suggest that when the initial 30 minute baking time is completed on day 1, you put servings in individual ramekins or casserole dishes for serving and top those for the final 15 minutes of baking. Store the leftover, un-topped cassoulet and topping separately and assemble when reheating.

I made this tonight with only a few modifications which were due to dietary needs of my guests and/or lacking certain ingredients. I used 12 oz each of andouille and sweet italian sausage (both made with turkey/chicken, no beef or pork), and an additional 1.16 lb of boneless chicken thighs which I browned after browning the sausages. I also used sherry in place of the brandy, and made a bit more topping. I think I cooked it a bit longer before putting the topping on top for the final 15 minute bake period. The whole thing fit nicely into my 7 quart dutch oven. Overall, it was marvelous! The flavor was excellent, very balanced, luscious and rich, and it presents as a gorgeous one-pot dish. I know this will sound cliche, but truly? It reminded me of a dish I ate during my first trip to France as a 17 year old. Several people asked me where I found the recipe; I was happy to direct them towards Epicurious. :-) Enjoy.

Absolutely delicious. I would like to make it a little more traditional next time by adding some duck confit and maybe some duck sausage if I can find it. Mike Allard, Courtenay BC

Totally lip-smacking. BF said it was the best cassoulet he's ever had, and that's saying something. Used hot louisiana sausages for the heat, and smoked chicken apple sausage, as well. My neighborhood deli/store has pre-cooked duck confit, so that was the 3rd meat item. Also used large white Italian butter beans, pre-cooked with some pork fat. It is indeed a versatile and compelling recipe. We're making it for the visit of my brother and wife this weekend.

Hm. This recipe resulted in a strange dish. Too much sausage, I recommend adding some chicken for variety. Also, would double up on the white beans. I will try other cassoulet recipes. I agree with the reviewers comment about too heavy on the cloves. I was SO looking forward to making this and it just didn't cut it for me and my hubby.

Ths is an extremely versitile recipe. I make it with chicken apple and chicken andouille for my Muslim and Jewish friends and it always tastes great. Make the recipe once as is then adjust. I have probably passed this one on to 20-30 people all over the world and everyone raves!

Aside from the chopping, this was an incredibly low-maintenance dish to prepare. I did it all in my Le Creuset French oven, which was perfect for this type of dish. I used random sausages from our freezer-- Italian elk sausage from my husband's annual hunting expedition and gouda/apple stuffed sausage. The flavor is incredible and follows the rules of fabulous European cooking that favors fresh, simple ingredients that lead to knock-your-socks-off flavor. I judge a dish by whether or not I would serve it to company, and this one passed the test with flying colors! It took me about an hour to prepare, but as a make-ahead dish, this is perfect for a busy weeknight or for entertaining a large group.

I made this despite the bizarre controversy going on in the reviews. I was unhappy with the tomato-heavy flavor of the cassoulet to start, and thought it called for too much cloves...so added a bunch of flour and heavy cream which balanced it out. I also braised two duck breasts to make it more of a traditional cassoulet. Overall, I wasn't that impressed with this recipe.

Almost perfection and abundant flavor is what I would say about this recipe!! I made this as a "Sunday dinner" for the family and we all enjoyed it. The leftovers will be lunches. I only made two changes...For personal taste, I left out the lima beans and substituted with carrots. Also, left out the tomatoes in the topping. Yum, yum!!

Rosemary, sage, parsley and smoky sausage marry deliciously in this recipe for a classic winter stew. It was very easy to make--in fact, I did it while wearing one of my twin 11-month-olds in a Baby Bjorn and the other watching from a high chair. Will definitely make again.

This was the perfect choice for my fall foray into one-pot comfort meals. I used an equal mix of kielbasa, andouille, and smoked sausage; fresh sage instead of dried, vegetable broth instead of chicken broth; and since I don't care for lima beans, I sauted some diced celery and carrots with the leeks. It's a recipe that you can play with. Allowing the flavors to meld for a day before topping with the crouton mixture was a good idea. I loved this dish, as did my mother (although she could have lived without the spice of the andouille.) It's very a very filling, very economical, and very flavorful one-pot meal. The crunchiness of the croutons was lost by mixing them with the tomoatoes, and I will omit the tomatoes in the topping next time around, because that crunchiness would add texture dimension. Some panko bread crumbs mixed with parsley would also work. I might also try it with a mixture of sausage and chicken thighs. This recipe is definitely going into my repeat file.

I forgot to say one thing I did change for this recipe is to use dried beans instead of canned ones. I hate mushy beans.

What ever you want to call this recipe it fit the bill for me. I was looking for an inexpensive 1 pot meal for my husband and I to take to work for lunches. I used chicken sausages to cut down on fat and it was delicious.

Chef of the Valley is completely correct in stating this in no way resembles traditional french cassoulet, made with confit, takes a day (or two if preparing each element from scratch). If one reads the note attached to the recipe originally printed in BA, the creator was living in France as a student and was inspired by what he experienced. Obviously, he didn't receive any formal culinary training. This recipe perhaps should be called a smoked sausage ragout,but, nomenclature aside, this is a tasty recipe. Try it yourself and let your taste buds be your guide, not a name.

This is SUCH a wonderful dish! My husband and I have enjoyed making it many times over the years, and made it for a crowd of 25 one time. We thought of the recipe this week (it's been a long time!) and I am so glad to find it on here. I wasn't sure if I could find the BA issue it was in- I wasn't sure when it was published, but do remember that it was the cover recipe. We'll be serving it to our friends for one of their birthdays tomorrow night, and I can't wait to taste it again!!

This is my first attempt at a cassoulet and I was very pleased with the result, even if it is not an "authentic" cassoulet. I made it for a New Year's Eve party. I added carrot and celery and omitted the lima beans. I think one of the nice things about this dish is that each cook can make variations and still get a good result. It was a hearty and warming meal for a cold Wisconsin nights.

What a laughable comment, but unfortunately is what I have learned since coming to the US a year ago to study cuisine, just in watching the society too many Americans behave needlessly insulting and/or behaving in an juvenile manner just as shown by the "cook" from Richmond, VA. Yet now at 30 I have my own clients and restaurant, so obviously I had some skill, and its not snobbery. This is not a traditional cassoulet and I stated thus from experience and having tasted it. To each his own, especially in a culinary sense. I give everything a chance, it's how one learns, and certainly do try new things and ideas but this taste was totally off for me. Obviously other commentators their families, and in my case, my professional clients as I am a personal chef have had similar opinions, but so curious how this person singled my comment out and pointedly made . Consider the range of ratings given, either quite low or very high, so obviously it is just a matter of personal taste, and most of the higher ratings were when the user greatly changed the recipe. A cook for Richmond, VA had to make it personal. Extremely declasse and unprofessional.

We made this recipe pretty much exactly as written for a Christmas Eve gathering. We used turkey kielbasa and I believe we added a can of beef consomme. We didn't make it a day in advance, but it tasted great anyway. We made a double batch so we had some to eat for several days, and it just got better and better. I think this is pretty much a perfect dish for company: the resulting flavor suggests that you put much more effort into it than you did. It also looks beautiful with the tomato- bread topping, and it's relatively healthy. Note also that we made this for a crowd that has had its fair share of traditional cassoulet, and if the diners were disappointed, they hid it well.

Rating: 4
It's almost laughable how much I changed this recipe--I halved it for starters, used turkey sausage, replaced the leeks with an onion, substitued sherry for brandy, skipped the lima beans, used two cans of cannellini, used plain' ol whole wheat bread, and didn't have any parsley. It was still delicious.

In the traditional French cassoulet, they literally could take all day to prepare and cook using layer upon layer of flavours. I've studied French cooking for some time, and I have NEVER heard of adding an apple or cloves as ingredients. Although I would imagine the apple taste could go well with the smoked pork, in a mixture of herbs, beans and various other meats...If you are looking for a tradition cassoulet recipe, this definitely is not it. I would never prepare such a dish for myself or my clients (I am a personal chef) under this recipe title.

Excellent, tasty recipe. The only caveat is that it takes a LONG time to prepare. It's worth the time, but just be aware of how much chopping, dicing, slicing is involved. I typically prepare the ingredients the day before, and cook it the next day. On the other hand, it makes a big pot. So, with a side salad, we usually have dinner for several nights. Make sure when you reheat after the first day, that you only reheat what you intend to eat, and keep the rest aside. If you reheat the same pot over and over, it tends to get mushy. It's a great winter dish.

I give it 4 forks as a comfort food. This is one the kids like...uncomplicated and hearty. I used white navy beans, pressured for about 45 minutes, and smoked turkey sausage from Safeway. It does get better over the next few days.

Flavorful to a degree but ultimately just tasted like sausages and beans. Not that there's anything wrong with that but it's not really the cassoulet flavor I was hoping for. And yes, I realize this is not a recipe for THE cassoulet.

I had bought some kielbasa and didn't know what to make and this was exactly what I was looking for. I don't like lima beans, so I substituted those with a can of pintos. Seeing how much sodium was on the label of the bean cans, I ended up rinsing the beans and it didn't seem to harm the recipe at all. The brandy and the cloves made this recipe. The cooking times seemed longer than they really needed to be, but then again, I burnt a couple of the croutons; low, slow heat and more oil would have helped.

I love this dish and make it for company when we are watching football or the Academy Awards. I use chicken franks and low-fat Kielbasa to keep the fat down. And I freeze the left overs for more fun later. The brandy gives it a nice kick.

This is phenomenal! My husband went nuts when he tasted it. I followed the recipe exactly, using chicken andouille, Hillshire Farms smoked turkey sausage, and linquica. Better than any cassoulet I've had before. The key to the topping is to make sure the bread cubes are crispy before you mix them with the tomatoes.

Quite delicious. I added a whole smoked chicken, in addition to the sausages. The topping was delicious but did come out mushy, as others have noted, so the second time I made it I did just bread crumbs and parsley. This is great to make for a crowd, since making it ahead improves the flavor. I doubled it and then did a single batch and that served about 30 people nicely. I used canned cannellini beans; the lima beans were great since they added a nice splash of color.

We prepared this a day in advance and it was amazing. I followed the recipe "almost" exactly but did add bacon, a whole smoked duck, poultry sausages and a couple of hot italian sausages which worked out perfectly. With the addition of the extra meat, we were able to serve 10 people easily. The bread topping is a must as well. I found that I didn't need to add more chicken broth when I reheated the following day but I had used more than was required initially. Enjoy on a really cold day -- it's worth the time involved.

Very good cassoulet. I halved the recipe and still got a good 6 servings. I used 1/3 sausage to 2/3 dark turkey meat. Next time I'll use half of each. Didn't have any brandy, used sherry instead. I will definately make this again!

Great recipe for cassoulet, and easy to make! I added 5 slices of bacon (added a great smokey flavor), and will try some chicken or duck next time as well. As other reviewers noted, this recipe makes a massive amount of cassoulet - I cut the recipe in half and it easily yielded 6 large portions.

I had so much confidence from other reviewers, I TRIPLED it for my afternoon outdoors birthday party for 40 people. I followed the recipe except for slicing the sausages before browning them, and adding the boneless chicken thighs, cut in half; nice to be able to make it in advance so I could relax and enjoy the party while it was reheating. Everyone loved it, houseguests gladly ate leftovers the next day. We had salads, bread, and homemade chunky applesauce with it.

This is a hearty and delicious meal, and although it is very easy to prepare, it is not a quick-fix. I made it a day in advance and refrigerated overnight (as recommended). The next day, while it reheated, I prepared the topping. I used some spicy sausages and some reduced-fat sausages. The flavors in this dish were a perfect mix. I can't think of any way it could be better! Because it made so much, I shared with friends who also thought it was wonderful.

This is a divine combination. The only thing that I would change is I would reduce the amount of fat that I sauteed the leeks & garlic in because it is very fatty - but great for a cold winter's day.

Like many other reviewers, I added some chicken thighs which works very well. I also used butter beans instead of lima, and several of my guests were grateful. Finally, I omitted the breadcrumb topping for health reasons; if you use chicken or turkey sausage for your meat this dish is really pretty healthy, and this way we could have dessert. Looking forward to enjoying it again.

Fantastic! I made one change. I reduced the sausage by about 1/2 lb and added about 3/4 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs. I think this was a good addition to the flavor and texture.

My husband and 14 year old son loved this and ate heartily. My daughter and I ate normal adult portions. I used yellow onions in place of leeks and 1/2 pound of tomatoes in the topping. I made it a day ahead and the flavors mellowed perfectly. The topping was terrific, not mushy. I only have about 3 servings leftover! Half the sausages were lowfat smoked chicken and half of all the sausages were spicy - yum.

Wonderful cold weather food. I served this to a gathering of 10 friends, several of whom are basic meat-and-potatoes types, and everybody loved it. The only thing I changed was the topping; I used fresh French bread crumbs, parmesan, and parsley to make a thin crust over the top.

Very good indeed. Was a real hit at a post cross-country skiing afternoon. I will not mix the bread with the tomatoes for the final baking next time - that tends to make the bread a bit "mushy". Make it a day ahead to let the falvours minglr.

My wife and I enjoyed this dish, and I would probably make it again. The cloves didn't do much for me, so I might leave that out. I made this a day in advance. If you do that, I strongly recommend reheating for more than 30 minutes. Personally, I liked the bread topping more when I was nibbling out of the bowl than when I put it on the cassoulet; it seemed a bit soggy even after the 15 minutes in the oven.

This was outstanding! I am making it again this weekend, but will substitute thyme for the sage -- we are not big sage fans. Contrary to what some others have said, I think the bread and tomato topping adds a great deal to the texture of the dish and would definitely recommend adding it, at least the first time you make this dish. Use good sausage, too -- not just turkey kielbasa. It's worth the extra calories to go all out on this dish. My family really loved it, too. Even my picky teenagers raved!

Wow. This came out better than I thought it would, considering that the ingredients and preparation steps are rather ordinary. The cassoulet is sweet and smoky and the flavors are tightly integrated. I made this for a work luncheon and because people are fussy about beans, I substituted Goya small white beans for the Great Northerns and fresh string beans for the limas. I also omitted the topping based on what others experienced. The dish has a nice deep flavor that keeps you coming back for more. I would recommend NOT using a non-stick pot - let the sausage make the pot bottom brown (or black!) and scrape up the bits when sauteing the onions. This dish is just perfect for the All-Clad 5qt. casserole!
