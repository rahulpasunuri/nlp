I did this from the magazine recipe so I didn't benefit from your reviews. I too would have halved the whipped cream recipe, as I had way more than needed. Takes a bit of time, but really worth it for the wow factor. I didn't have peppermint extract but I did have peppermint oil candy flavoring. Since I was concerned it might be too strong, I used it very sparingly and taste-tested along the way to ensure it wasn't overpowering.

We love chocolate but found this to be almost too rich. Looks lovely and festive.

I have made this tart twice for group events and everyone always raves about how it reminds them of being little children again. I will say that you probably want to serve it in very small slices because it is pretty rich.

I've made this a couple of times now and keep getting asked to make it again. It's unusual, it's decadent, it's festive, and it's easy. I use my own pie crust recipe, otherwise I followed the recipe as written and would make no changes. It's so rich I make the sevings small, but with a glass of port or an espresso on the side, it's perfect.

I made this exactly as written except that I also halved the whipped cream topping and it seemed like plenty. My crust didn't just shrink, it "melted" and slid into a giant shortbread cookie-like blob in my tart pan. Still, it was tasty and didn't impact the pretty presentation. I agree to pulverize the candies between the layers!

Amazing! I added 1 tsp. peppermint extract to the filling and used only 1 1/2 cups of whipping cream for the top layer. It was a perfect amount. I'm making it again for sure. Everyone loved it.

For the crust I used the "Spiced Cranberry-Pear Tart" recipe from the same issue. It can be made a couple of days ahead. Also, "Andes" makes a peppermint white chocolate I used instead of hard peppermint candies. The dish was delicious...agree on cutting back on whipped topping.

This made a lovely presentation and was not difficult to prepare (I had no trouble with crust as some others did), but I found the chocolate filling to be a bit too intense. I'd make it again with a slightly lightened up version of the chocolate filling ... perhaps adding a bit of whipped cream to it. I cut down on the amount used for the topping as others suggested and it was ample enough, so perhaps whip enough as the recipe calls for, but add some to the chocolate first.

I agree that the whip cream is WAY too much and would cut it in half next time. A lot of work, but was a big hit.

I didn't have a problem with the shrinking crust that others have mentioned. I heated a pizza stone in the oven for about half an hour before cooking. Maybe this helped? I would agree that the recipe is very rich and very filling. You only need to serve a sliver with some coffee. Everyone at dinner thought it was fabulous.

Agreed with other reviews regarding shrinkage of the crust. It was quite a lot of work with decent results - not outstanding. Definately half the amount of whipped cream. Crushing peppermint candy to powder helped overrall consistency of the tart. Put garnish candies on just before serving to prevent bleeding.

Wow, this was a terrific recipe! I made the following modifications: Used a good store-bought crust (really, you don't need to make one from scratch, the crust is not the center of attention here), used a mix of Ghirardelli bittersweet and their holiday peppermint chocolate (limited edition for the holidays) - about a 1 to 3 ratio, respectively, and added a touch of peppermint extract to the filling (I omitted the crushed candy altogether). This resulted in an excellent tart - creamy, almost thick pudding-like filling and great balance of chocolate/peppermint flavor. My husband and daughter both loved this!

This got rave reviews. It is very rich so serving small slices is essential. I cut the whipped cream in half and did not bother with the plastic bag piping, wasn't necessary. I took the suggestion of a previous reviewer and pulverized the peppermint candy. The crust worked, but based on reviewers comments I lined the bottom of the tart with foil and topped with ceramic baking weights which prevented shrinkage. This is not only delicious but very pretty.

I agree with the cook from Portland: the filling was too rich and thick for the tart. I would have preferred something more mousse like for filling to give it a lighter feel after a big christmas dinner. I halved the peppermint extract in the whipped cream and it was lovely. To the cook working with the crust, perhaps you added a bit too much milk. I found the crust very nice to work with and it held it's shape very nicely. If you are looking for dense chocolate flavor, I highly recommend the Chocolate Torte with Cranberries from a few years ago. Far superior in taste and looks.

Everyone seems to love this recipe and I can say that we only liked it. While the flavors are wonderful, the chocolate filling is way too rich. It was like eating fudge with peppermint whipped cream on top. Just too much after an equally rich holiday meal.

I made this tart for christmas and everyone loved it! The tart crust was difficult to work with, it melted over the side of the tart pan and onto the bottom of my oven, but tasted great. I chopped the candy canes very fine in the food processor and this worked well. I also halved the whipped cream topping as other reviewers suggested and it was perfect.

this is almost identical to last years chocolate pie w/cocoa praline nibs. It is a delicious and rich dessert and a good end to a meal.

I made this for Christmas this year, and it did not dissapoint. I did cut down a bit on the whipped cream in the last step, added a little extra extract to the cream, and had a slight miscommunication with my husband/shopper regarding the peppermint candies. Instead of candy canes, he bought Andes peppermint creme baking bits. They are softer & had bits of candy-cane in them. I still ran them through the mini processor, but I think they were quite a bit softer and smoother than the hard candies would have been, and the flavor was still there. That is how I justified the additional extract in the topping, though. I didn't take the time to pipe the topping, and it still looked great. Very delicious - will make again the same way.

I echo the crust shrinkage sentiment. The flavors were great but a better recipe for the crust is needed. We involved the kids in pulverizing the peppermint candies: a heavy duty quart-sized freezer bag and a meat mallet were all that were needed. Lots of fun and we were left with candies that bordered on dust. The amount of whipping cream was excessive but we all savored the excessiveness - hey it was Christmas Eve dinner!!!

There will be no broken teeth if you use Ghirardelli peppermint chocolate bar (special Xmas edition)!

Spectacular Christmas treat! A bit time-consuming but worth the effort. I cut the tart in two inch squares and it easily served 24. Whipped cream topping can be halved, and no need to pipe in a ziploc bag, pretty swirls made with a knife will do. Present on serving tray with fresh holly springs. Noel!

Add lemon juice to the crust to minimize shrinkage.

This is an excellent recipe, and a real crowd pleaser! It's really delicious and has a very dramatic presentation. However, a few changes are necessary--if you use peppermint candy between the chocolate and the cream layers, pulverize it! Otherwise, you'll need to get a release from your guests for any broken teeth that might ensue--seriously, it's more than just a texture problem! Next, the amount of whipped cream for the topping is really excessive. I used 2 1/2 cups the second time, and could have used less. I didn't have too much trouble with crust shrinkage--but I followed all the chilling/crust preparation instructions religiously. My friends asked if this dish could become the traditional birthday celebration dessert--they loved it!

I made this exactly as written. I would probably only make the filling again. Definitly not the crust...it shrinks alot!!! And I would use the peppermint extract in the filling and in the whipped cream, as opposed to using the crushed mints underneath the whipped cream. The taste combination was wonderful, but I didn't like to crunch thru the smoothness of the filling and whipped cream. I love the whipped cream, but would only use half of the amount given in the recipe. It was just way too much, made it hard to cut the tart. The crushed mints on top are decorative, but bleed with the moisture of the whipped cream. Be sure to add them when serving the tart.

Even taking great care while rolling the crust and chilling it per the recipe, it shrunk. Dissapointing. For the chocolate, I used semi-sweet chips. Next time I will use bittersweet to get a stronger chocolate flavor.

Absolutely lucious for Christmas. A huge hit for 110 guests. Nice presentation.

delicious, festive and easy. You need less than 1/2 the whipped cream called for

Filling and Whipped Cream were outstanding! The crust, on the other hand, was terrible. I had to make the crust twice and both times it looked unappealing. Shrunk (even after freezing) and puffed up too much (probably due to the b.powder). I ended up using a standard pate sucree recipe with great results. Very rich and festive for Christmas!

Excellent! Made it for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit! I would half the topping, just a little too much whipped cream!
