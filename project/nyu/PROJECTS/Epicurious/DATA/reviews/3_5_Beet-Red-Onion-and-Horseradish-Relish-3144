This is a very nice relish to accompany any roast beast. I use good(not great) balsamic vinegar and when vidalias or other sweet onions are available i substitute for the red onion but finely dice. shallots also work.

This is delicious! I am not sure why anyone would complain. I used locally harvested beets, 25 year old balsamic and a decent extra virgin olive oil. The natural sweetness, enhanced by roasting, of the beets along with the balsamic contrasts but also tones down the sharpness of the horseradish and onion. This is so good that I could eat it by itself!

Absolutely delicious! As a previous reviewer noted, beets and horseradish is a traditional Czech condiment, and my family has always served it with polish sausage. Also really wonderful with andouille or any other smoked sausage. A keeper.

This is an excellent recipe! I get rave reviews everytime I make it and now have to make it for every holiday meal! It is great relish/side dish.

Why is everyone trying this with beef? This is an excellent version of a relish that Czechoslovakians eat with ham and hard-boiled eggs. The strong flavors perk up the eggs, and a sugar-cured ham is strong and sweet enough to stand up to the horseradish and complement the sweetness of the beets. Try this again -- in a different way!

I agree with the cook from Long Island. The relish did not "add" to the beef. The beet flavor was lost between the onion and horseradish. It was inedible as a leftover as the horseradish taste took on a life of its own.

My brother brought this to our holiday repast as a complement to our 18-lb. standing rib roast. It was pretty to look at and interesting to taste. I enjoyed its mild flavor and would make it again, but wouldn't rate it an all-time favorite.

Served this as a side dish with prime rib and got mixed reviews from 17 eaters. Comments ranged from "It's OK" to "Very good". No one disliked it or raved but there was quite a bit left in the serving bowl at the end of dinner. Next time I would add a bit more horseradish and 1 less beet.

i served the beet relish with the horseradish & roasted garlic crusted prime rib. i felt that the red onions and horseradish were extremely spicy together and did not complement the rib at all. no one could eat it with the rib. i would not serve it again. too strong flavors!
