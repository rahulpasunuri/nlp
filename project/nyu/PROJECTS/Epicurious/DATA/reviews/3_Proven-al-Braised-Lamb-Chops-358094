I too loved it and will certainly make it again. I too will use more garlic. Yes, have bread on hand as the soup is every bit as good as the rest of the dish.

Even though we used russet potatoes instead of boiling potatoes, this dish was very good! I backed off 1/2 cup on the wine but it didn't seem to make a big difference. Next time I will use more garlic and a little more thyme. I'll also make a loaf of crusty bread to soak up the broth. Delicious!

With a few very minor changes this dish was absolutely fabulous. double the onions, use more garlic and half the chicken broth. I will definately make this again. YUM!
