I'm kind of surprised that this recipe has only four reviews! It is one of my standard "go-to"s for almost any occasion. The veggies obviously can change but the Caesar mayo is incredible. I've used both pre-shredded Parm and grated my own -- and while one is better the other, you can definitely get away with using the pre-shredded (not the green can). Great flavors and so easy!

Really yummy. I also used anchovy paste. My guests liked it so much they double dipped.

I serve the dressing in a hollowed-out red cabbage half for a colorful presentation. Anchovy paste works just as well as anchovies. This is a fantastic appetizer.

My guests and I really liked this dip. I used other veggies with it. Although radishes look terrific, they are not the first to be eaten. I would definitely make this dip again with a variety of seasonal crudites.

It's a simply fabulous dip. I particularly like to serve it with asparagus, jicama and red peppers.
