This is good, but it is also extremely messy to eat, and I think there might be a little too much tarragon in the mayonnaise (not much, though).

Wow! What an awesome recipe. This is simple, easy and fast. The flavors are fresh and delicious. This is easy enough for a weeknight meal but could also be used for entertaining. I used tarragon and basil in the mayonnaise and substituted rice wine vinegar for the tarragon vinegar because it was what I had on hand. Delicious!

Love the recipe, very simple but very delicious. Personal preference - I substituted rosemary for the tarragon and red wine vinegar for the tarragon vinegar and they came out quite nice.

I made this for an after work bbq at my boyfriend's apartment. It was easy and good. The mayonnaise mix was delightful.

This was a wonderful change from grilled burgers on the deck. Great combination of flavors.I wouldn't change a thing.
