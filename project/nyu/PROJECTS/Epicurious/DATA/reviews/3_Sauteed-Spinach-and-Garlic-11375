Lacked flavour when made without making any modifications to the recipe.

I made the recipe almost as directed and it was delicious. I just added sea salt and used minced garlic. It was very simple to prepare and very tasty. I will make it over and over again.

I love really simple stuff. This is it. I mince the garlic and of course you got to add some sea salt.Stir up the garlic constantly or it can turn bitter. My whole family loves this recipe and its the basic flavors that makes it great.

Sorry - this is a huge modification - but sautéed spinach should be in everyone's repertoire, so here goes: Heat 2 T rice bran oil, preferably in a wok, at high heat until just smoking. Add 2 cloves thinly sliced garlic and stir for a few second until barely brown. Thrown in 1/2 lb baby spinach and toss to desired doneness (I prefer to stop when most leaves are wilted, as the spinach will continue to cook.) This will serve 2, and I do not recommend doubling due to the heat/time facotr. Also, people have different tolerance for garlic (and garlic has different ideas on how strong it is depending on season, etc)

This recipe will yield a delicious side dish if you use double the garlic(or more, depending on personal preference). Also, use fresh ground salt and pepper and let the garlic (minced instead of sliced) simmer in the pan for a few seconds before adding the spinach.

While my family enjoyed this side dish there is one change I would make. I would mince the garlic since I don't like eating the slices. other than that both of my children loved it and would not think of having spinach any other way!

Have had this dish several times in good restaurants. However, this rendition was lacking... not enough garlic, not enough flavor. Perhaps modifying this recipe as other suggested would make this better, but "as is," I didn't even keep the leftovers. A real disappointment. Great concept, just didn't translate in the execution. I'll keep looking.

I haven't followed this recipe exactly, but for those of you who doubled the garlic,,, try adding grated ginger instead of the additional garlic. I sometimes add a touch of vinegar, too.

One of my favorite side dishes. I like to serve it with chicken and steamed rice. I found that adding crushed black pepper and a couple dashes of white wine or lemon juice to the sautee made it all the better. Also, a few extra cloves of garlic for super garlic lovers like myself doesn't hurt!

Perfect side dish. Served it with honey and soy salmon from this site, so I added a little dark sesame oil to the spinach at the end to complement the main dish. So easy and delicious!

Served this with lamb. It's very similiar to Sauteed Swiss Chard also on this site and one of our favorites.

This recipe is a staple in our home. When I need a less subtle flavor in a vegetable I substitute escarole or chicory. Lots of fresh black pepper, and you don't need either lemon or vinegar. Also, GREAT to eat the next day.

This was easy and delicious. Served with grilled swordfish for a low fat, South Beach Diet legal meal.

A perfect, easy side dish when you are searching for a light, green vegetable. I used it with Fried Chicken and cheesy squash casserole to balance the richness of those dishes. Altering the instructions a bit, I chopped the garlic, sautéed it in olive oil; added the spinach, stirring so that bits of garlic infused the leaves, and finished it off with lemon juice. It was a huge hit.

Nice side dish for lamb. Made per recipe and was quite happy with the results. Next time I may add some bacon and acid (lemon juice or vinegar) to give it a little more complexity.

My husband and I loved this recipe. The spinach and garlic combination were a perfect blend. Will definitely make this again and again.

What a wonderful recipe! I placed a boneless, lemon-pepper grilled chicken breast on the bed on spinach, and it was a tasty success! Try this recipe - you'll love it!

I love sauteed spinach with garlic as a side dish at restaurants and this is a good, easy recipe that matches restaurant quality. I tripled the garlic and slivered it. Before serving I sprinkled the spinach with lemon juice and pine nuts. The only thing better would be to sautee the spinach in butter.

This was very good. I too added mushrooms and red pepper flakes for extra flavor. This recipe is nice and quick.

I knew I'd love this because I love spinach and garlic, but I also added mushrooms and plum tomatoes to the mix and it was great. I've also used this as a "topping" to a baked potato (just add a bit of parmesean cheese on top) and it added lots of flavor!

This recipe is good but becomes excelleent with the addition o a few tbsp of balsamic vinegar, de-pending on the amount of spinach.

I have taken to using the sauteed spinach as a bed for broiled salmon or halibut. For my taste, I double the garlic plus I add toasted sesame seeds. I sometimes add almond slivers as someone else suggested. It really only takes 1-2 minutes saute time and it is so delicious!

I used the suggestion of the person from Highland Id. I added the lemon juice to the garlic just before adding the spinish to make sure the garlic didn't burn and then tossed the leaves. It turned out great

I've changed this to a 4 fork recipes by adding the juice of one whole lemon just before serving. I've also found that reheating, if made ahead of time, really corrupts the texture of the leafs...TOO wilted.

Try adding some diced pepperoni and sliced ripe olives--so good.

This dish lacked a lot of flavor! Could have used butter, cream, or vinegar! Whatever the case it sure lacked personality!

My children really liked this one. Normally anything with the "V" word in it (vegetables) gets the official 2 thumbs down, but they really ate this one up. My husband had me make a second batch before dinner was done. Next time, however, I am going to try slivered almonds.
