Great weeknight dinner. Agree with previous reviewers that adding a bit of roasted red pepper would enhance color appeal if you do not have red jalepenos; and that deglazing the fennel pan with white wine might increase the complexity of flavors. But very good as written.

So, after reading the reviews I made the recipe as written except I couldn't find red jalapenos so I used green jalapenos. I tasted the fennel before adding it to the spaghetti and wow, was it spicy hot. The heat from the jalapenos seemed to have infused the fennel. I'm guessing that this dish is more or less spicy depending upon how hot the jalapenos are. Anyway, we loved the dish, but I will cut back on the jalapenos next time. I served this from the pan on the stove and found that the fennel and pancetta sunk to the bottom so next time I will turn it into a large shallow pasta bowl for serving so that the solid ingredients in the sauce are more evenly divided.

Perfectly good, but not outstanding. I made this as written except subbed red pepper flakes for the jalapenos. We liked the way the fennel seeds and fennel bulbs reinforced each other's flavor. But to me both the lemon and the parsley got lost. There are many more pasta recipes that I find more viscerally satisfying and just plain yummy. So while I'd make it again, I wouldn't say this was special.

Good recipe, I would call it a change-of-pace pasta. Probably not for company. I will do it again, there are many variations in all the reviews here. I know it is not "Italian" to say it but I would use less pasta, and cut the fennel into smaller pieces. Altogether another arrow in the quiver. Try it, you will like it.

Fantastic! Took a chance and made it as a side dish at Christmas dinner to mix it up...everyone loved it! Made it with the Pancetta Sage Turkey (keeping with the Italian theme). Did not add fennel seeds and used crushed red pepper instead of the red Jalapenos but turned out perfect! Even great re-heated or if you need it make it in advance

Great recipe, the lemon adds great flavor, definitely make again. Used a different pasta, had just one fennel bulb, turned out excellent.

Rating: 4
Very, very good! I only had one fennel bulb, which was a bummer, and forgot the pancetta, so I used garlic and red pepper chicken sausage. It was still fantastic but I'm sure it's way better with the proper ingredients. MMMm!

Thumbs up! I have never cooked with fennel before but it has a subtle taste and is a nice complement to the dish. Our grocery store ran out of pancetta so I used Canadian Bacon. No not the same but it worked fine, just added more oil to make up for it since pancetta is greasier. Also used extra mini red peppers (left seeds in for a couple of them). Delicious dish! Hopefully, my husband feels the same way when he gets home from work shortly.

Delicious. Used a bit more pancetta, and next time will add more chiles as it wasn't very spicy. Was concerned about all the fennel being overwhelming but it wasn't at all.

Delicious weeknight dinner. Upped the pancetta and garlic, added some white wine. Agree with the other reviewers that it wasn't spicy enough, so I added some red pepper flakes on top of the red jalapeño. It was a mild, fruity heat in the end which was just right. I couldn't bear to toss the fennel fronds, so I added them in with the parsley and it didn't hurt it any. Will definitely make again!

I've made this weekly. it is so awesome without a red sauce and mild fennel flavor. This is my new signature dish. The only thing I add, to obtain more color, is roasted red peppers.

I didn't leave any forks for this recipe because I made a vegetarian version and I don't think that my version compares to the recipe as written. I think the pancetta would definitely add flavor that you just can't get without it. To make up for the lack of flavor, I made it extra spicy and added extra lemon juice and some really good olive oil at the end. I would give my vegetarian version three forks.

I made this last night with some trepidation since I had never cooked with fennel before. I was afraid the dish would taste like licorice, but the subtle flavor of the fennel was wonderful! I agree with previous reviewers, it didn't have any heat as written, so I would add the seeds of one jalapeno or add red pepper flakes. I would also increase the pancetta to a pound. This took a bit longer to make than I thought it would, but the result was great, my husband raved about it!

This is superb. It's Italian cooking at it's best; few flavours, simple and it just works so well. I'll come back to this again for sure!

I loved this recipe for the combinations of flavors from the sweetness of the fennel, the saltiness of the pancetta and the pecorino romano, and the spiciness of the Jalapeno. Served with a Ceasar and Foccia bread and was a wonderful meal. I used a green jalapeno since I could not find the red.

This is a fabulous and unique dish. If fennel is your thing (or maybe even if it isn't...), you'll love this. As with most recipes, I used this one as a base and took the liberty of adapting it to my own tastes by increasing the amount of pancetta, adding speck, and adding additional parsley, garlic, and fennel seeds.

Rating: 3
Quite tasty, and very easy to make, but not as delicious as I was hoping after reading the reviews...

Rating: 4
Like some of the other reviewers, I used some, but not all of the jalapeno chile seeds to add some spice. It turned out great. This is my new favorite recipe. Great for weeknights (although slightly longer to make than I prefer) and good enough to serve to guests with a salad and bread.

Was apprehensive about the stong fennel taste while I was slicing it, but it all mellowed out, and was a very delicious dish. Our guests enjoyed it a lot.

I substituted duck bacon for the pancetta (I don't eat pork) and this was one of the most incredibly pasta dishes that I have eaten. Loved the lemon flavor taken on by the fennel. Will be making this again for sure.

Rating: 3
I thought it was subtly tasty, but my husband felt it was a little bland underneath the heat of the pepper. If we make it again I may try adding more pancetta. One other drawback was the longer cooking time for the fennel; I like to keep weeknight meals under 30 minutes if possible.

Rating: 4
Boy, was this ever good! I used proscuitto and, just as another reviewer had mentioned, I also added about 1/2# shrimp. I carmelized the fennel for a richer flavor, too. My husband cannot tolerate too much heat, so I halved the amount of pepper. There was so little heat, if any, that I have to agree with the other reviews who used the full pepper that the heat index could be turned up a little. Next time, I'll sub red pepper flakes, maybe 1 teas for the pepper, and add just a little more lemon. Excellent, excellent dish. It will be on our dinner menu again soon.

I thought this was delicious. I used one fennel bulb (I watched a woman take the 2nd to last bulb at the store, leaving only one for me!) and one leek but otherwise, followed the instructions pretty closely. I think I used some poblano that I had instead of the jalapeno and it was a nice flavor. It was the first time I have cooked with fennel bulb and I loved it. It was super-easy, too - yay!

This was so delicious. After cooking the pancetts, I seared shrimp which I tossed with a bit of fennel seeds, s&p. It was simple but fabulous flavors. I can't wait to make again!

Delicious. Even our picky teenage girl loved it. The fennel contributed a subtle "kick". My husband and daughter definitely gave this recipe a "thumbs up - do again".

fist time cooking with fennels loved it. I would suggest to not cook the pancetta too long as it will get a little hard and dont be afraid to cut the fennel in big pieces it adds a wonderfull flavor to the pasta! will do this one again !! added some shrimps and tomatoes like suggested below and deglaced the pan with wine! awesome dish..

Delish! Subbed red pepper flakes for jalapeno, but that was it. Super good and even better the next day for lunch!

Rating: 3
My husband loved this! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used whole wheat spaghetti and bacon instead of pancetta. Next time I will cut all of the core off the fennel, because it stayed hard, and I might cut smaller pieces to make it easier to eat. I felt like it was missing something, so I might also add diced tomatoes next time, and maybe some more spices, but on the whole, this was a good recipe.

Rating: 1
Absolutely one to toss out. I made this because my children and I love all the ingredients, but the end result was far less than we hoped for. Bland, even with extra garlic and jalepeno, and definitely needed more pancetta.

Rating: 3
I loved this and will definitely make again. Small changes: Subbed bacon for pancetta and used red pepper flakes instead of jalapeno. Word to the wise: Be sure to use low-salt broth. The amount of reducing concentrates the salt a lot. I wasn't so careful and ended up with something super salty the first time.

Kind of boring overall. I folowed the recipe exactly - except for a green jalepeno (no red available) and despite the list of strong, flavorful ingredients, I found the finished product to be fairly bland.

Divine. What a glorious use for fennel.

Very good meal. My sweetie and I enjoyed it. The fennel takes the dish in a different direction from so many pasta dishes. I did make a few changes. To make the disk into a full meal, I added 1 lb of shrimp in the last 2 minutes of the fennel reduction. At the same time I added a cup of quartered cherry tomatoes and a small jar or drained, quartered marinated artichoke hearts. Also, to make the dish earn the "spicy" I left the seeds of 1/2 a jalapeno in the mix. Next time I might try adding 1/2 cup of dry white wine with the stock.

Couldn't find fennel at my local supermarket so used anise. A different taste im sure, it was still nice. Def. will make again with the right ingredients ;-]

Just being honest, but this recipe is boring. Needs more oomph- and not just from the heat of the peppers. I added more vegetables, cheese, lemon, spice, everything, and it still was really mild and boring.

Definately a keeper! Used a habanero as well as green jalapeno (couldn't find red) & the spiciness was perfect. Also used almost a pound of pancetta. Everyone loved it.

Rating: 4
Made the recipe as written, subbing bacon for pancetta. One tip for anyone who can't find red jalapenos - green ones eventually ripen to red. I've accidentally left them on the counter before and in a day or two they turn. Not sure how much it makes a difference in flavor though, seems to be more of an aesthetic issue to me.

Super delicious! I used 3 red jalapeños, seeded, maybe it's where I live or the grocer but there was NO heat in this dish. Going to leave the seeds of 1 jalapeño in next time. Toasted the fennel seeds for fun, which added a richer flavor and fun texture. Added lemon zest in addition to the lemon juice. Used regular bacon because that's what was in the freezer. Will definitely make this again, the overall flavors are subtle but very tasty and the bacon/fennel-bulb works together incredibly well!

Just made this for a grateful crowd. Really, REALLY delicious melding of fennel (a favorite of mine) and pasta. Made a fennel believer out of my husband. Couldn't find red jalapenos -- that would add nice color, but otherwise followed recipe completely. Run, don't walk, to this one.

Loved this recipe and so did the rest of the family. Halved the recipe but used the entire 3oz of pancetta. The extra pancetta was kept out of the main dish but sprinkled on top with the extra parsley. Also kept all the pancetta fat in the pan and did not add the olive oil as directed since the extra meat added the extra fat needed. This also added to the dish from a flavor perspective. I do agree with previous comments regarding extra 'heat' but that is a personal preference. The recipe, as written, is excellent but the user should adjust 'heat' to meet their own liking.

Halved the recipe and substituded veggie Italian sausage in place of pancetta. Next time would maybe use an extra pepper, could use a bit more heat.

I would never have made this but for the favorable reviews and I'm glad I did. Fantastic flavor and good heat on a cold winter night. Doubled the garlic and added one whole poblano to the jalapenos. Even the kids cleaned their plates. Will add this to the "make again" list.

To quote the other reviewers, this is "exquisite", "complex", "scrumptious"... and "comfort food." I agree with all of these assessments. This dish is easy and classic phItalian-omenal. For our non-spicy-tolerant munchkins' sake, we eliminated the jalapenos in favor of sprinkling crushed red pepper as desired on our individual servings. Perfecto!

This was, hands down, the best home cooked dinner we have had in a long time. It was amazing in flavor, simple and comforting. We will absolutely make this again and again!

I adore spaghetti, and I adore fennel, so I figured I'd like this dish. It's truly more than the sum of its parts, though. The flavor is rich, complex and layered, and the lemon and fennel seed add a nice brightness. LOVE it. My guy did too.

This dish was exquisite! My husband says he would have been happy to be served this at any fine restaurant. Followed the recipe as written, no changes needed. Served with the Saviah Cellars 2005 Laurella which complemented the flavors well.

This was great! I made a vegetarian version by substituting tofu Italian "sausage" for the panchetta. I also added a shallot.

Man! Do I love fennel! This recipe is scrumptious! i only used one jalepeno, 'cause that's all i purchased. when i make this again - i'm using two. Other than that - followed the recipe to a "T", perfectly easy and oh so delicious. Super easy too...the fennel mixture can cook and cook. I got distracted, and still...i could eat the entire mixture.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. This could be served as a side dish or as an enree. For those who like more meat with an entree I think adding chicken or shrimp would be delicious as well. I made the recipe exactly as it's written except used two green jalapenos since I couldn't find red jalapenos. I thought the amount of spice was perfect - very subtle. For those that like things very spicy I suggest adding the seeds of the jalapeno or adding in red pepper flakes.

This was pretty easy and tasty. I substituted plain bacon since the pancetta available was too fatty (even for pancetta) and it was fine. I only needed about a cup of cheese. Cooking the fennel softens the flavor, but adds some subtle complexity. Good carb-y comfort food.
