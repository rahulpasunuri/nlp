made it as written and it was great. on the sour side, but i like it. salad dressing also goes great with spinach and goat cheese salad.

I love this salad! I have served it to many dinner guests, as well as for smaller dinners and it's always the talk of the meal. It is suprisingly filling too, so be careful about making this a side salad. I also like to add walnuts and cherry tomatoes to give it a little more flavor.
