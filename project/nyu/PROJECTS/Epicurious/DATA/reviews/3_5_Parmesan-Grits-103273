When I looked at this recipe I thought it was simple and would have a mediocre flavor. I was wrong - in this case simple is PERFECT. I cooked it exactly as written, using freshly grated good parmesan, and it was wonderful. This is the perfect comfort food!

Grits aren't just for breakfast anymore. So easy. Served it with grilled salmon and cole slaw. Loved it.

Great side dish. My family loves it! Very easy to make and a nice change from the usual rice or potatoes

We tried this new twist on grits and enjoyed it very much. We're even asking our Boston relatives to try it.
