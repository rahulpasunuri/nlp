A family favorite. I use 2 wonton wrappers for each ravioli; put the egg wash on the edges and use a hand press that I bought from Pampered chef & it works very fast & is very good (presses into nice circles) I trim the edges while I have the press on the ravioli. Goes extremely fast.

This was...eh. I had high hopes, given the reviews and the cost of all the cheese (I used high quality cheese--I think using Kraft in this would be disgusting, as per another review) and fresh herbs. But it was very filling with an ok flavor. I did like the ease of preparing homemade pasta without having to make the dough, though.

The filling was good, but it does not go with meat sauce. I wanted a cheese ravioli with meat sauce and what I personally picked didn't work. The ravioli was good, they were light tasting and the lemon was a nice touch. I'd only make it again if I did it with the suace recipe provided.

I make my own pasta and use a different sauce but I think the cheese filling is fantastic. I've made it several times and it's always a hit.

Would it be a sin to add sauteed mushrooms and a touch of diced proscuitto to the filling? That said,we adored it as is, but I wonder if the flavors might deepen a bit...The broth/butter combination is begging for other uses as well.

The cheese filling (high quality sharp white cheddar subbed for cantal) just wasn't right to me, but my guests all loved it, so I didn't fork rate it. My 1st try making raviolis w/wonton wrappers and worked like a charm. I measured carefully & didn't deviate from the recipe, yielding about 42 raviolis (served about 5 to each adult). Broth was very nice with it. With the extras on the 2nd night I made more broth and also a lite tomato/basil/garlic sauce, which DIDN'T work with it. Paired well w/the powerful zin we had. Also, 3 minutes was too a little too long. Didn't fall apart, but check at 2 minutes & watch closely so they don't get mushy.

Very much worth the time, a very tasty dish. Couldnt find the cantal either, but subbed a high quality white cheddar. And they do freeze very well.

ok so i didnt have cantal or white chedder so i used the kraft shredded sharp chedder mixed with the romano cheese. i ended up having way more cheese than i needed but this might have something to do with the fact it was shredded not grated. however this dish still came out tasting excellent. however it can be a bit time consuming to make the ravioles.

I can't make enough of these raviolis at our house. This is one of the best winter dishes around. We serve this with homemade garlic bread and salad and to rave reviews. If you can't find the Cantal cheese, the white cheddar is just as good.

A wonderful and very easy meal to prepare. I made the entire recipe even though there are just 2 of us. I froze the extra raviolis in a single layer on a sheet pan & then popped them into a freezer bag. This is fast becoming one of our "staple" meals to have on hand after late nights at the office. I'm looking forward to trying other fillings in the wonton wrappers.

Even my grown son who features himself to be a gourmet and chef loved this one. And you have to make the broth, too!

My husband has always loved to cook and since we've gotten married I am trying to learn also. I decided to try this recipe after seeing it in the October issue. My husband absolutely loved it. He thought it was the best meal I've ever made and we've made it twice more since then (once for guests). It is rich and I can never finish all of my portion but it is delicious.

Did substitute vegetable broth instead, reduced butter to 2 tablespoons and used the sharp white cheddar. DELICIOUS meal but quite rich. I only got 27 ravioli out of the mixture though.

The soup was excellent. Be careful to not overcook the ravioli as they will fall apart. Could not find the Cantal cheese and substituted a good cheddar. Will definitely make again.
