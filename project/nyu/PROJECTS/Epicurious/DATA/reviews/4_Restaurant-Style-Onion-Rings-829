Crispy, easy and 'moreish'! I kept the onions whole, cut them thinly but didn't concern myself about it too much. Would be fantastic as a side to a juicy steak; much like those crispy onion rings served at a Chop House.

This is an excellent recipe, if you follow a few rules closely. Some reviewers were having probs. with the flour/spice mix not being enough, it being too bland or the onions sticking when frying. The following should address them all: 1)Slice the onions 1/8 inch thick or thinner, for the best results, and the flour mix will last for all of the slices. In addition, you will have wonderfully thin and crispy rings, the kind you see mounded daintily on a good steak or burger. 2)Add 1/2 t. garlic powder to boost the flavor if desired, or increase the cayenne. 3)Coat the onions in the flour mix in SMALL BATCHES. I coated 10-15 in the flour, and transferred them to a mesh strainer to sift off the excess flour mix back into it's bowl.Then dumped the strainer of rings into the fryer, and swirled once. They never stuck and fried up in a minute to two minutes. Once you get the assembly line system going, it's a piece of cake and goes quickly. Just remember to keep the cooked rings in a 200 degree oven on a wire rack to stay warm and crunchy while the rest fry. We ate so many of these, we got belly aches, but are gonna do it all over again in a couple of days. They're that good.

I made this twice. The first time they came out perfectly delicious. Really gourmet tasting. Really messy though. The second time they were badly burnt. A deep fryer or thermometer would be helpful. Too bad I have neither.

Really good although I didn't completely follow the recipe. We had no vegetable oil so we fried the onions in olive oil. Not a problem except that it smoked a lot. I used the whole carton of buttermilk for one large onion and bumped up the spices with whatever looked good in the cabinet. I cooked them for about 7 minutes but maybe because I didn't cut the onion super thin. They came out crispy and sort of flaky and tasted great. I will definitly put this into my rotation.

Crispy and fresh,I like the recipe as listed. I found 2 large onions to be too much for the flour mixture.

These earned rave reviews... I've been looking for an onion ring recipe for a while now, and believe I've finally found a winner! As per the other reviewers, I did add some extra seasoning - - garlic pwdr, onion pwdr, increased the cayenne, etc. I will definately make this again.

These are absolutly fantastic!!! Light, crunchy, crispy. I drained my onions very well so I didnt have any of the clumping others talked about. Of course I added my own preferences of spices like garlic powder etc. And I put them in a plastic container with the flour and spices, and shook them to coat. I was going to try several recipes to get just the right one, but no need now. I found this recipe and now its a keeper. FYI- if you have a basket in your deep fryer, leave it in the oil and add onions, when done just raise the basket, and your onions will not stick.

I used a thin slicer and soaked the onions as directed. I agree with the other reviewers that the onions clump with the flour but the longer you let the onion/flour mixture sit, the worse it becomes. The clean-up wasn't too much of an issue, I used the zip lock bag method. Too messy for such a mediocre at best result. The end result looked like the crust on fast food chicken. Not worth the effort or the clean-up.

I was cautiously optimistic about these, but they really turned out great! I avoided the mess by putting a lid on the bowl and actually TOSSING them around, rather than using a fork, etc. I fried them for more like 4 min (not 2)in a fry daddy - next time I will add more salt/cayenne/other seasonings - they were a tad bland, but GORGEOUS to look at with great texture.

This recipe was decent but nothing special. I've used onion ring mixes with better results. For the time and energy, this simply wasn't worth the time.

I won't assign these an official rating because I'm not sure if I made these right. Combined with the flour, the drained buttermilk-soaked onions became a big gummy mess. Is that supposed to happen? I had to pull apart onion strips somewhat with my fingers to avoid having one big onion ball. In the end, the tangles of thin onion slices did taste and look pretty good, though. As a newbie to deep-frying, though, I was frustrated at how smoky and smelly this process was. I am having to launder my clothes multiple times to get rid of the smell...

These were great. I sliced some onions very thin and some medium (with a mandoline), and my husband preferred them thinly sliced. The slight spice of the ceyenne went well with the sweet onion. This is definately a keeper.

OH! MAN! These are good, and very easy. I used Vadalia onions and sliced them regular size, they're nice and crispy outside and softish onion on the inside. We've been trying, on and off, to make onion rings for years, and never found a recipe that worked. Now we have one!

These onion rings got rave reviews from the entire family! They are the best - crispy and not greasy at all! Have requests to make them again very soon and will probably do so as they were really easy to make!

Oh My Gawd!!! These are the best o-ring's I've ever had. My family raved over them. I used our local Walla Walla Sweet Onion and cut them in thicker slices. I poured an entire quart of buttermilk over two large, sliced onions and let them soak, tossing occasionally for about 2 hours. I didn't add any spices to my flour other than a bit of salt and pepper. I didn't want anything cutting into the taste of those Walla Walla's! Delicious! A new family favorite!

Yummy! I just made these and ate them with 2 different kinds of chicken--BBQ broiled and fried. I live in a small apt and I heated just about 1'' of oil in a frying pan and had no troubles. I also added black pepper to the recipe and I tried it as a flour batter for the fried chicken--worked great! Definitely will make again!

These were wonderful! I served them on top of grilled steaks and my husband and son went wild. I, too, have been disappointed in ALL onion ring recipes, but not this one! I used my mandoline to thinly slice the rings. Will definately make again and again!

These are the best onion rings I have ever made! Each time I have attempted an onion ring recipe I have been dissapointed. These are exceptional and very very addictive. My husband ate TONS of them!

Very easy to make with delicious results. Would consider using these as a topping on vegetable casseroles or even salad. The kids couldn't believe they were eating - and liking - onions. Addictive!!

Everything was great with these onion rings EXCEPT FOR THE FIRE!! The recipe said to use a heavy saucepan for the oil. I think I let it get to hot because when I dropped the first batch of onions in, there was a big poof and I had a grease fire on my hands! It was pretty scary but luckily there was no damage. My advice is to watch the temp and be careful not to exceed 350. My husband lectured me saying we should only fry in the "Fry Daddy" because it is made so it cannot exceed dangerous temperatures. Now back to the recipe....the onion pieces were great. I sliced them as thin as possible. They were very much like many of the restaurants serve. I made an Outback Steakhouse style dipping sauce but quickly found they were so good on their own that we didn't need the sauce.

This is, by far, the best onion ring recipe I have ever attempted. I served this side with Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwiches. My guests couldn't get enough. The only thing I would have done differently is to make more! This recipe will become part of my personal recipe collection.

Whoa !!! Outstanding !!! Used liberal spices, perfect onion rings !! Very crispy and not greasy. Easy. 32 year restaurant career person, trust me these are the greatest. Impress your dinner guest.. just cook up these!!! FYI instead of deep frying inside, (we have a small apartment), I set up my coleman camp stove outside on our deck, no oil smell and easy clean up.

My astonishingly picky daughter *loves* these rings, and asks about every two weeks when we're going to have them again. They're easy to do, and the taste is great.

I will make these again as a treat. I served them with grilled hamburgers and a bon appetit spinach salad that I can not find on this site. My kids and I are more fans of onion rings than french fries and these were scrumptious.

These are really great specialty 0-rings. I lost the recipe sometime ago and have really missed the dish - especially when family is over and they ask in advance for them. Again, as a specialty item, (not to gorge yourself on) these are tops.

How wonderful to have onion rings without all the heavy batter! I've made them this way for years with milk and the buttermilk adds more flavor!! Kudos!!!

I cannot recall exactly how many times I have made this recipe, but I know that it has been many, many times. I had them in one of my favorite restaurants; now, I can make them at home anytime. I have to threaten my boyfriend to keep him from eating them as I make them! Thanks for the recipe.

I don't even like onion rings but I made these because it went well with the steak...They were great! Not too time intensive if you plan ahead and let them sit in the buttermilk in the refrigerator. But not exactly low-cal! I was able to make them into "rings" -- not very difficult.

My husband and I loved the onions but they did take some time to cook. We would definitely make them again for family.
