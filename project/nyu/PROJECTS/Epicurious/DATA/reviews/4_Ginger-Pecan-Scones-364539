A yummy and quick breakfast option. Great flavor and light and fluffy texture. You definitely need all 3 types of ginger to really get the full ginger flavor. I didn't think the ginger was too strong. I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I substituted yogurt and they turned out great.

15 minutes was enough for me too. Great taste and texture, although I didn't find them too gingery. Just about right.

Really tasty. I follwed as written, except...accidently bought low-fat buttermilk (and didn't realize it..was trying to figure out why my batter was so sticky...added at least another 1/2c flour). Like several others, I did not add extra ginger to the top. I made them smaller - four circles of 8 each, turned the heat down to 400*, and baked for ~15 mins (Breville oven seems to bake fast). Given the amount of baking powder, they were rose a lot, and were still a very good size. I didn't take the fork rating down in spite of the stickiness, as I assume that was user error!

They are very "gingery" but good. Used less crystalized ginger and didn't use on top. They taste better cold cause you can taste the pecans better. I also used extra virgin coconut oil instead of butter. The 20 minutes was too long. I would check at 15 minutes.

These were fantastic! My husband and I love ginger and these certainly had plenty of ginger flavor, and the pecans added great texture and a nice contrast. My husband declared these the best scones he'd ever eaten!

This recipe was great as is. I didn't have buttermilk, so I followed the advice of others and soured some almond milk with lemon juice. It was fantastic. My husband thought these were the best ever.

I made exactly as written. The dough was so wet I thought I had made a big mistake, but they came out light and fluffy and absolutely fantastic. This is a keeper.

This is my new "go to" scone recipe! The three types of ginger give them multiple layers of flavor. Instead of adding ginger on top, I make a simple maple syrup glaze (powdered sugar, maple syrup and cream). They definitely have the wow factor.

Ginger-ey! These come out pretty humble and homely-looking, but they have a nice flavor profile. Maybe a little TOO heavy on the ginger, but I think if you reduced it much more, they'd end up being a little too bland. Mine came out slightly chewy from over-kneading - don't make my mistake. (For the curious, you can also see a photo of mine on my blog, just copy and paste this link: http://blog.smiling-web.com/food/2011/05/my-god-its-full-of-ginger/)

I made these for Mother's Day brunch and they were a hit! The triple dose of ginger was just right and the pecans really made it! I followed the recipe as directed, except I halved it and substituted fat free half & half in place of the buttermilk (it's what I had in the fridge). It worked well except the dough was a bit wet so had to add more flour. I would definitely make these again!

wonderful! Eliminated the ground ginger and didn't put candied ginger on top. Was afraid of ginger overload. Super fast and easy, my 4 yr old helped! Serving them for Easter Brunch.

These are really tasty. Even my picky eater nephews were gobbling them up.

Wonderful! Great flavor. I used whole wheat flour and less than 1/2 c sugar and they were still plenty sweet. 20 mins was slightly over-baked, unusual for my oven. Will def make again.

These were delicious, even more so if you love ginger! Melt in the mouth goodness, very forgiving of my less than light hand in kneading. A few notes: when I chopped the crystallized ginger in the Cuisinart, it tended to clump together so on adding it to the flour mixture I used my fingers to separate the clumpy bits. No buttermilk on hand so I used about three quarter cup sour cream and stirred in milk to make 1 cup. Used minced ginger from the jar rather than true fresh ginger - easier. This is definitely a winner on my list.

Excellent! Although I'm not the biggest fan of ginger, these scones sounded delicious and they were. Followed recipe exactly.

Oil? What oil?

This recipe was good but can be better. Next time I will reduce the amount of oil. I prefer the Mustard-tarragon Chicken saute recipe.

Excellent as written.
