This recipe is really badly written. To a "kettle" of boiling water, add rice? How MUCH water? And isn't a kettle a closed pot with a small spout? It sounds awful, anyway.

I found this to be a somewhat touch-and-go recipe: beautifully simple, but erring on the side of bland. I needed to add, add, and add salt in order to bring down the acidic edge (which I normally enjoy in other recipes with vinegar and lemon juice). This was despite having gotten the dressing where I thought I wanted it in terms of salt and pepper before mixing it in with the rice. On the other hand, I'm not the biggest fan of arborio rice or using grain in mint dishes, yet I found both elements pleasing here. I wouldn't make *this* dish again just because it is rather ordinary, but it did give me some ideas for constructing other easy rice salads.
