No more passover brisket for my family! This recipe was fantastic. It is involved, but not difficult, and the ability to prepare ahead is a lifesaver when serving a seder meal (or any meal with several courses). I served with our traditional kugel and steamed spring vegetables. This recipe is a NEW holiday tradition for our family.

This was superb. As it was not 'Matzoh season'! I made the mushroom polenta from another recipe in Epicurious, using only the mushrooms and some liquid from this recipe. Even though I did not have the correct piece of veal the one I had was great. The basil twist in the gremolata is a new one to me and adds another good element. I did not braise it as long as called for as my piece of meat was smaller and after an hour it was very tender.

I thought this dish was wonderful, although admittedly, I left out a few key ingredients -- namely the porcini mushrooms (substituted chicken stock for the braising), and the basil in the gremolata. Still, the gremolata takes what is essentially a comfort food dish, and elevates it to the level of seriously yummy. I served it with a mushroom risotto. Oh, and by the way, the indication that you can prepare this dish a day ahead is absolutely true. I braised the veal on a Saturday, so for Sunday dinner all I had to do was reheat it in sauce, and make my risotto.
