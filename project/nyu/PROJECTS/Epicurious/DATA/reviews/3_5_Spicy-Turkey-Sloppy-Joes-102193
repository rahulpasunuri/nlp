Love this recipe, but not a fan of the "sloppiness", so I changed how I serve it... Bowl, some romaine lettuce, slice 1/2 wheat baguette on bottom, top with turkey mixture, sharp cheddar or jack cheese & lot of green onions. Sauce soaks into bread & melts cheese. I eat w/ a spoon. Not a fan of ketchup, so I use diced or purreed tomatoes, little chopped chipolte pepper in adobo or some chili garlic sauce. I toss in a jalapeno & some "good" diced green chilis. Not a fan of green peppers, so i add red peppers & lots of Red Stripe. I take this prepared on car camping trips - just reheat & build it. The jaws drop. Healthy & packed with protein after a long day of kayaking or jiking.

I'm shocked at how good and easy this is! As a kid I liked Manwich - this is an adult and healthier version. I usually use red bell pepper and chopped vidalia or yellow onion, Heinz chili sauce or ketchup and sriracha, and I serve it on crispy ciabatta or small wheat rolls with grated sharp cheddar. I'm writing this review because I just mixed some leftovers with leftover mac & cheese - stuck it in the oven with grated cheddar on top - and yum - an amazing use of leftovers! Just wanted to pass it on!

This recipe was rather easy to whip together. It took a little longer to get to desired consistency but that is fun with cooking. I must say that for as good as this recipe is and I will most likely make it again, it was rather sweet. I used ketchup since that is all I had and this has to be the smoking gun for sugary sweetness. Almost too much so. Next time I make this, I will use tomato sauce and tomato paste and hopefully maintain the very nice flavors but eliminate the sweetness. I would say this is a solid, 2.5 star rating.

Good amount of spiciness but it was too thin. I added a small can of tomato paste and it was much improved. Also, I advise a darker beer. All I had was PBR.

This is the best sloppy joe recipe I have tried, and I have tried many. It has just the right amount of spice and sauce, of which I find one is often lacking in most other recipes I have tried. Even better served with shredded sharp cheddar cheese. This will be my new to-go recipe.

This is a great recipe to prepare when you want an all in one meal. Very hardy and spicy. It's definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
this is probably my most favorite sloppy joe recipe - i have made it a million times, both with turkey and with beef, dark beer and light, as is and with variations, and it always comes out hearty and saucy and delicious and even better the next day. i also modify it occasionally to use as chili - add a can of beans and some fresh diced tomatoes and reduce slightly less (or add stock).

Exceptional for what it is! I used turkey thigh meat and just a bit of ground beef, red bell pepper instead of green. With the specified amount of Spice House chili powder, chili sauce, and the green chilies it was spicy enough for me (who likes hot) and just right for the teenage girls and their dad. Wonderful easy, tasty meal for a weeknight, and bonus that the only dishes used in preparation are a cutting board and single pan.

Excellent. This recipe is easy and healthy. We serve it on a wheat bun with a slice of pepperjack cheese. The meat freezes well and makes for an easy dinner at a later time if you don't use it all.

Rating: 3
Yep. Used an IPA and a mixture of ketchup and Sriracha. Next time I will go half and half.

Rating: 4
A real keeper! Makes ground turkey actually taste worth eating and that's saying something! The only change that I made was adding a bit of cornstarch to the end product in order to thicken the sauce. This will be going on our regular rotation for quick and easy meals. Even my 2yr ate it, complete with green peppers.

Best sloppy joe recipe! I make this vegetarian by using the Quorn ground round and add a small can of tomato paste to make it a little saucier. My husband absolutely loves this.

Rating: 3
This is a really good option if you want something hearty but aren't in the mood for hamburgers. Just a couple of notes, I used ground lamb instead of the turkey because that's what I happened to have on hand and it worked really well. I also prefer red pepper so I used that instead of green. Also, I used a Yorkshire ale and it was a very dark ale and it worked quite well. I'd be interested to try this with another kind of ale or beer. Lastly, this is really good the next day so if you are looking for something you can make ahead, this ideal. I highly recommend you use a pretty hearty bread too because it is quite literally sloppy and we resorted to using forks and knives. I'd make this again.

This is the only Sloppy Joe recipe I make - not that I make them a ton, but the go to recipe. The flavors are terrific and so easy. Seems healthier than beef. Always rave reviews

A good weeknight supper. Very easy to make.

This is an excellent, simple recipe for a weeknight dinner. I did switch the ground turkey for 3% fat ground beef which has about the same fat & calories and added some cayenne for more kick. Those who like milder flavors and children will love it just the way it's printed.

This is a regular in our dinner line- up. I use red pepper instead of green and I substitute Mexican chili powder for half of the chili powder which increases the spice level. Easy and tasty.

Rating: 4
I've been making this for a long time and use the turkey mixture in a tortilla wrap...I improvise with the ingredients each time I make it. Some of my alterations in the turkey mixture are: dark beer, cumin, chopped fresh cilantro, red pepper, and chopped shallot. In the wrap I use: romaine or field greens, sour cream, mexican queso, avocado, chopped tomato and salsa. Get the largest wrap you can find and use as many organic ingredients as you can find!

Kind of weird. Not what I was expecting. I think the beer flavor was too much?

This has become a staple "quick" dinner option in our household. This recipe freezes really well. I double the batch and freeze into two person servings. My other half is a bit of a meat and potatoes, kind of guy and he loves this recipe. I did modify it ever so slightly. All organic, no green peppers, added red instead, used chipolte chili powder, and serve it on onion buns with pepper jack cheese. Pairs great with a Pinot Gris or our favorite "house wine" Laurel Glen REDS.

I really enjoy sloppy joes and this one I make over and over. Using ground turkey instead of ground beef makes it healthier without compromising flavor.

Really good with a different taste. I used half Chili sauce and 1/2 ketchup, chopped yellow onion instead of green, red bell pepper instead of green. Guiness beer works well, let simmer for a while to burn off alcohol.

Rating: 3
Good basic recipe to start with. By the way, I didn't find this spicy (hot) at all. If you like a bit more heat, add some red pepper flakes or cayenne. I also added finely chopped carrot and a red bell pepper instead of green for more sweetness. Took a tip from another reviewer and added a little BBQ sauce. Will try again with a different flavor of beer!

Light yet filling. Great heat with a delicious sweetness.

A quick family fave. Have made many times w/different variations. The beer/ale makes a difference. Recommend using Guinness- or a comparable dark brew!

Rating: 2
I agree with the previous reviewer, nothing special. I followed the recipe using Heiniken and adding 1 teaspoon of ground cumin. We like things spicy, but using the full 3T of chile powder made it a bit too spicy and it drowned out the other flavors.

Rating: 2
Certainly an easy dish, found it nothing special. I used chipotle peppers instead of green chiles, which made it REALLY hot, but we like it that way. Next time I would add more tomatoes, make it a little saucier. Decent recipe, not outstanding.

Rating: 3
I used a sweet onion instead of the green onions and a combination of red and green bell peppers. I only had one pound of ground turkey but still used the full amount of spices -- it definitely was not too spicy. Served it over hot cornbread and we all loved it.

Rating: 3
After reading reviews and seeing that people were rather mixed on the spice level, I decided that since we normally like things hot, I would try it full strenth. Oops - big mistake. I now have to make a second batch without any spice to mix with the first to dilute it. Otherwise, we did enjoy the flvor we could taste (even to make a second batch).

This is one of our family favorites. Excellent to double and freeze. I agree with another reviewer, use a dark beer. We also like it topped with a slice of cheddar.

Rating: 3
Perfect! Only used 1 T. olive oil becos I ran out. Used half a green pepper, 2T. chili powder (wouldn't have hurt to use 3 tho), ketchup, omitted the green chilies and green onions and added a can of Texas Pete chili sauce. Added the green pepper in the last 10 minutes of simmering so as not to get soggy as another reviewer suggested - simmered for about 30 minutes total. Great consistency - was not too runny. Served on Pilsbury frozen baked biscuits. Would have taken leftovers for work but my boyfriend and I ate the lot!

Rating: 4
This was super easy to make. In order to make this kid friendly (3 boys- 8 yr twins and 6 yr), I omitted oninons, peppers, chilies. I used 1T. chili powder, 3/4 cup beer--also made it not so runny-,1/2 c. chili sauce, 1/4 c. ketchup, 1/4 c. BBQ sauce, and 1 T. worcestershire sauce. Turned out perfect and kids loved it!

Outstanding. A real crowd pleaser. Double the recipe and freeze individual portions in zip lock bags for later. Use dark beer.

This was great and my boyfriend said to put this on the "make it again" list. I read some reviews beforehand and a few complained that it was too acidic -- I think it is the worstershire sauce so I decreased the amount to 1 tbsp instead of 2.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this was too acidic. We threw it away. I used ketchup instead of chili sauce and did add the can of chilis, which I think made it too sour. What did I do wrong?

A very satisfying meal - plus quick to prepare. Just don't drink too much of the beer before it's time to add it (Guinness works well)

I found this to be a good sloppy joe recipe. I used Guinness Draught, added some stone ground mustard, and a couple splashes of tabasco. I didn't use any green onions, as I did not have any on hand, but the dish gets along without them just fine.

Tasty and quick! My boys (13 and 11) really loved this, even with the 3 tablespoons of chili powder. We'll make this again for sure.

I've made this many times and LOVE it! I wouldn't change anything and the 3 T. chili powder wasn't too much in my opinion. Next time I'll try a dark beer (stout or porter) as another reviewer suggested. It could only make it even better. YUM! BTW, this may be the first time I've given a recipe 4 stars as I'm pretty picky!

Rating: 4
I made this without the chilis, with ketchup, with a reduced amount of chili powder and a Heineken that was taking up space in my fridge. An amazing recipe, although next time around I'd stick with the recommended amount of chili powder (this coming from someone averse to spicy foods). When considering the recipe I was tempted to run to the store and but a richer, darker beer but the Heineken worked quite well with it. This will definitely stay in my reportoire.

I have passed this recipe on to others. We like it best with stout beer and the ketchup combo.

I make this recipe often. Sometimes I add mushrooms, which give it a nice texture. The recipe is great because you don't really have to measure and you can just throw everything into one pot. I do recommend using as fresh ground turkey as possible (buy and use within a day or two).

I thought this dish was okay, but my husband and eight year old daughter didn't care much for it. They both prefer the kind from a can (easier on me, I suppose!) I probably would not make this dish again.

Loved this recipe! I coudln't find any ground turkey at the local store, so I used ground chicken instead. Also forgot to get green chilies so I used some diced jalapeno. The only beer I had on hand was a somewhat bitter English ale (Tetley's) which I was worried wouldn't work, but it turned out great. Will be making these again!

Rating: 4
This one is on our regular rotation. I too add an onion sauteed with the garlic before adding the turkey. Cut the chile powder back to 1T and add red/green peppers (lg. dice) at the very end with the scallions so they don't get too soggy. Served over saffron rice - a major yum. Sometimes add kidney beans as well, but it's just as good without.

This recipe was quick and easy - perfect for after work or when you don't feel like making a big "to do" about dinner. The ale was a nice touch! This recipe will go in the permanent file.

I made this for a group of meat-loving guys and they devoured it. I cut-back the chili powder and added some sweet BBQ sauce at the end. Very delicious!

I liked this but found this recipe made for a fairly thin watery Sloppy Joe, so I added a can of kidney beans that I rinsed and mashed and a can of drained diced tomatoes to the mix the second time I made it. I also added a tablespoon of my favorite BBQ sauce. Then I I let it simmer for 15 minutes as the recipe calls for and transfered the whole thing to my crock pot/slow cooker. I cooked it in the slow cooker on automatic (med) for about 3 hours. The result was fantastic. Thicker, heartier, yum!

Yum! Yum! I used octoberfest sam adams beer and found the flavor to be very different and good although I left out the chiles and used a regular onion (added with the garlic).

Fabulous. And so easy! Unlike most ground turkey recipes, you won't miss the beef here at all, it really is good. We also reduced the amount of chili powder. Nothing fancy, but it's a great mid-week supper. This goes in the permanent file

Delish, reduced the chili powder to 2 1/2 tbsns. and only used 2 tbsns. of olive oil instead of 3, didn't miss it at all. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and boiled it down until it was thick. I cooked some of the green onions with the garlic in the beginning too. Filling and very satisfying. I also used 1 bottle of Harp beer.

I used the Silver Palate brand fat free Thai chili barbecue sauce and only two tablespoons of chili powder. It was fabulous and hearty. The next day I added a can of black beans and some diced peeled tomatoes to the leftovers and it was a great chili!

This dish completely depends on the quality of chili sauce that you put in it. All other ingredients are just filler. I had a great chili sauce and a great sloppy joe.

I had to substitute ground beef and spicy sausage for the turkey, but it was terrific! Not too spicy - I only used 2 and half tablespoons of chili powder and I added a couple drops of hot sauce for more flavor. I also added chopped onions with the peppers and ground beef and sauasage which was fine. Will absolutely make again!

I must have screwed something up with this. I used a chili sauce that I had in my fridge and this was way too spicy to eat. And I enjoy spicy food. But this stuff would have blistered paint. Could the 3 tablespoons of chili powder been a typo?

Normally, spicy foods are not my cup of tea but this was excellent. You might need to adjust chili powder according to your own taste. Instead of white bread try toasted wheat bread. This recipe is definitely a must try and for me a keeper!!!

I haven't had these for years and this recipe is definitely fast, fantastic and spicy. However, I only had just over a 1 lb. of turkey, but didn't adjust the amounts of ingredients asked for, and it still could have had more sauce. I used 2 1/2 tbsp. of chili powder and that was more than enough (from now on 2 tbsp). I also recommend using a "pale ale" beer. Because it's darker, there's a subtle woodsy/campy flavor. Next time, I'll use use 1/2 cup of onion, when browning the turkey, rather than 1 cup of green onion at the end (reduce to 1/2 cup). I used more than 3/4 cup of chili sauce because my memories of sj's were tomato based. So, I'll add 1/2 to 1 cup of diced (canned or fresh) tomatoes.

Great recipe, and super fast. Nice for people who don't eat red meat.
