This salad is very easy to make and tasty! We added shaved parm on top, and thought that all of the flavors were highlighted nicely.

It was just ok. I added some tomatoes and cucumbers, and even with that it tasted rather bland. I could not taste either garlic or capers, as the vinegar overpowered everything. Next time I'll add more garlic and capers and will use lemon juice instead of vinegar.

This recipe was fast, easy and tasty. I used my mini Braun chopper to make the recipe. (get the same results only faster) The portions were enough for my family of 4. The first time I used mushrooms, but I preferred using chopped tomatoes, a sprinkled of parmesan cheese and a good shaking of coarse ground pepper. Yum!!!

Fresh tasting and fast to make. In addition to the romaine & mushrooms, I added red onions and cherry tomatoes.

Excellent, simple and quick! I sauteed a mix of button, crimini and shitake mushrooms (leftovers) and added pepper to the dressing. This was great with steaks on the grill and we'll definitely make again!

Delicious, my entire family loved it and asked me to make it again! My youngest is four and he even liked it!

My son loves a mushroom salad but is a very simple eater. This salad fit the bill. I served it with a homemade chicken pot pie. A very simple meal that satisfied everyone.

this dish was boring. It needed something...lke chicken, or tomatoes or onions or SOMETHING! it was very simple and easy to make but I would not make it again. I was disappointed.

Having not yet made this, I just wanted to say that an easier way of mashing the garlic and capers is to use a mortar and pestle - easily picked up for $15 in a cooking store. The recipe looks wonderful and I will be trying it tomorrow night.

This was a huge hit at my 4th of July party. The capers offered such an interesting depth of flavor! I forgot to drain the capers, and thus added an extra 1/4-1/3 cup of vinegar to mask the saltiness. No one ever noticed!

This was sooooooo good. The worst part was smashing the garlic past. Wish I knew an easier way but it was well worth the effort. My family loved it.

Excellent choice of ingredients! I've made this a few times and, it never fails, the guests always ask for extra dressing for dipping their bread!

Husband & I loved this recipe - had no capers, but will add them next time - also, didn't use salt - used Mrs. Dash seasoning - Well worth the minimal preparation it took :) A terrific salad!
