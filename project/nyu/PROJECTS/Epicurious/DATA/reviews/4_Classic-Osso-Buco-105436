I have been making this recipe since 2003 and it is awesome! As others suggested I do use a little more carrot and only 1 orange for 4 veal shanks. A good butcher will have more uniform shanks. Add a tablespoon of veal demi glace from Williams Sonoma for richness and cut back on the salt. Some of my friends like the gremolata, but I personally can do without it. Great with all kinds of sides, fettucine, rissoto, orzo, or this last time I made potato and celery gratin! You can definetely reduce the sauce on top of the stove to make room in your oven for the gratin. (and yes tie the shanks for a better presentation)

With or without the Gremolata, it's a deeply flavorful Osso Buco. Will definitely make it again, next time using smaller rounds of the veal. The large pieces I used took much longer to cook and I think the smaller ones are more juicy, though an advantage of the larger pieces seems to be less fat. The dish is much better the second or third day after it's made.

Very good! Used less wine and more chicken stock and it was good. Just make sure the liquid covers up most of the meat!

I have always wanted to make this dish at home, having enjoyed it in restaurants for years. I followed the recipe for the most part, having to make a few substitutions due to limitations of my pantry: used mandarin orange, a dry champagne and mixed stock instead of what was called for. I also added more carrots. This easy recipe combined flavors I would never have put together on my own, and I loved it!

This is a great recipe for Osso Buco. I didn't include the tomatoes or the Gremolata, I substituted vegetable stock for the veal stock and cooked it on the stovetop for almost 3 hours instead of in the oven. I used to make Osso Buco in tomato sauce but will make it this way from now on - the sauce is lighter and aromatic. I serve it with french fries and salad and my 4 year old and 6 year old sons ask for seconds.

Awesome and super easy to make. I love the addition of the orange but one was plenty. I kept the zest in large pieces so it was easy to remove at the end. Also, I thought it was better without the gremolata. Served with mashed potatoes and a field green salad. Yum!

Been using Epicurious for years. Have never before entered a review but must here. This is truly an exceptional dish. Many tweaks no doubt possible to accommodate what is on hand (I used grass fed beef shanks and beef stock), but the orange and gremolata are essential. Cut back on the zest (max of one orange) if you are wary of strong orange note - but the citrus hints coupled with the bite of raw garlic give the dish bright and memorable flavors that are quite special. Serve it over/alongside an unadorned risotto with the same crisp white you used in the dish - I used a graue burgunder.

Delicious, but very expensive cut of meat. I used chicken stock and added a rosemary sprig and several thyme sprigs. Cut back on the orange too!

Made with beef shanks but still oh-so good! My mom was putting the (few) leftovers in a container and was sitting there with a spoon, cleaning out liquid at the bottom of the pot. Very. Yum.

This recipe failes to tell you that you must buy deep cut veal..you also must tie up the shanks with cotton cord; otherwise it will fall apart as it cooks... I also would never use the oranges required for this is not the classic version.. serve this with rissotto of some type. There are many wonderful ones out there.. My original recipe for this came from a cook book of 20 yrs ago..The book was from a couple from Cape Cod.. I wish I could find that receipe again, since it had 2 versions...one with tomato and one without, which they called the White Osso Buco...

This is the best Osso Buco recipe and was the first one I made. Since I have altered it slightly by adding extra root vegetables and using lean veal stew meat to reduce on the fat and connective tissue. Classic risotto goes perfectly with classic osso buco and definately try the gremalata.

Rating: 0
I have made this recipe many times to rave reviews..love the gremalata too. I plan to use stewing beef and make a beef stew out of the ingredients. I imagine it may be a bit like a beef daube which also often uses the orange zest.

This recipe in and of itself is flawless. The perfect osso buco depends on the quality of the meat! I love this!

Wonderful recipe! This had so much flavor and was beautifully rich. I used whole baby carrots instead of chopped, and had to use chicken broth instead of veal stock since I can't seem to find it anywhere. I look forward to making this again and again.

This was fabulous! I had to change a few parts of the recipe because I just used what I had on hand. Fresh roma tomatoes instead of canned, marsala instead of dry white wine, one orange instead of two, beef instead of veal broth, and I had it in the oven for about 2 hours. I used a smaller piece of meat than the recipe called for, and still 2 hours was about right. I cut back on the amount of broth since I figured the braising would create a little liquid on it's own. I served it with spaghetti on the side. The gremolata added a nice freshness at the table. Loved it.

I will be the dissenting voice, found this recipe bland. I think you must drain the tomatoes before adding them, I felt that the liquid took away the flavor. Although the gramulata might add flavour, it was unappealing in its presentation, maybe a salsa style would be better? For a dish this expensive, I wouldn't make it again as is.

Spectacular. You must make it with the classic Risotto Milanese

Four forks: Exceptional! I've made this twice now to rave reviews from visiting friends. Once with risotto and once over angel hair spaghetti. Not traditional, but suits the dish nicely. I agree the gremolata is a bit much. I cut back on the orange zest too, and sprinkle sparingly.

I made this recipe exactly as written except using only 1 orange, and there was still way too much orange taste. If you are wary of orange, or too-fruity-meat, try another recipe, there are so many better ones. We used fantastic meat, so the recipe turned out okay, but we had to keep telling ourselves to ignore the orange taste. Try a different recipe, or leave out the orange!!

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I cooked for about 2.5 hours in the oven. Absolutely perfect osso bucco! I served with orzo and butternut squash and sage recipe also found on this site. Heavenly . . .

Rating: 3
I thought this recipe was very good but without the gremolata it just tastes like a very good veal stew. The gremolata makes this distinctive and if you make this dish don't leave it out. I only used the zest from 1 orange because I feared that it would taste a little too orangy. I cooked it a day ahead of my dinner party and rewarmed it. I served this with the butternut squash polenta also from this site. This is definitely a "ta-daa!" kind of meal as the veal was very expensive. It was a hit with my friends though.

Great recipe that I make every time I'm home in the US. Has anyone tried substituting oxtail for veal shanks? Veal is not available here in China, but oxtail is easy enough to find. Also hard to find are ovens! I am going to try to make this stovetop with a tightly sealed dutch oven and low heat. Wish me luck.

This was so much easier to prepare than I expected. I must admit the cost of four lbs of veal shank was a little shocking but in the end, I halved it and saved the still-frozen other half and had plenty for our birthday dinner. Took other reviewers' suggestion and served it w/Risotto Milanese also from this site. Excellent.

Melts in your mouth. Not difficult at all to prepare. Be sure to not skimp on the gremolata.

Rating: 4
The best! This has become a staple in my house over the past few years. To me, it is the ultimate comfort food. The orange zest (which isn't always in osso buco recipes) is key to the sublime taste of these meltaway morsels. The gremolata is also key, as it adds freshness and color. I serve this with Lidia Bastianich's recipe for Risotto Milanese. Search no further, the ultimate osso buco recipe is this one!

Rating: 4
As a base recipe this is excellent, but osso buco absolutely demands risotto milanese and gremolata to reach "beyond compare" status. My family recipe uses neither carrot or orange peel, instead it relies on a good sprig of fresh rosemary and a couple of sprigs of fresh thyme for depth of flavor. Remove the herbs after cooking, especially if you are preparing the dish a day or two ahead of time, which I recommend, so their flavor remains subtle. Leaving them to infuse longer is too much of a good thing. As noted in a previous review, this is a dish that is definitely much greater than the sum of its parts.

"The best Osso Buco I've eaten in 10 or more years" was a comment by a guest, who tries osso buco in every restaurant he can around the world!!! I've never made osso buco before and found the recipe extremely easy. I served it on mashed potatoes/parsnip, with broccoli to add some colour. I think it might have been missing something (I made it exactly as written), as the rest of the guests didn't rave about it as much as the other courses that were served that evening (the Roasted Garlic Soup (recipe on Epicurious) got wows & requests for the recipe from everyone whereas the osso buco didn't!).

Great Recipe, extremely delicious and I thought easy to make. The veal falls off the bone into a wonderful sauce. Must have the gremalata and risotto milanese as accompaniment.

My family loved this dish at home on a snowy evening. The first time I made osso buco for them using a different recipe, they hated it. The meat was chewy and too fatty. Shopping before a snowstorm, I saw some leaner cuts of veal shank at the market and I tried this recipe with some trepidation. It was a huge success and even better the next day for lunch. I cooked the dish the full two hours and served with pasta, a green salad & baguette. Fruit, cheese & biscotti completed the meal.

I make this dish with beef shanks, and it has been my Christmas day dinner for years (along with mushroom risotto). The gremolata is an absolute must in this dish.

I was inspired to make this recipe after having osso buco at a particularly fine restaurant in NY. The results were fabulous, and this osso buco has ousted brisket as my family's most requested holiday meal. I made it this recipe for 10 (rather than 4), and it required a significant preparation-time commitment. I would advise that despite multiplying the servings, the stock/sauce should NOT be correspondingly increased; a little bit extra of each would have sufficed. While neither the sauce nor the stock [okay--I was pressed for time and had to tweak the boxed variety] tasted particularly flavorful on their own, WOW!!-the whole was so much greater than the sum of its parts. The meat was meltingly tender, and easy to serve because the butcher cut the shanks into steaks with a central chunk of bone and tied them. FYI, since I made this, I went back to the restaurant and ordered it again--this version far surpasses the restaurant's!!

This was a wonderful Christmas Eve dish. Left us lots of time to relax and visit. I followed the recipe exactly but did forget the gremolata--oh well--no one even missed it! I served it with pasta and crusty bread. The pasta seemed to stand alone, though. Perhaps I'll try the garlic potatoes or risotto. Ages 8 through 50 enjoyed every bite and there were no leftovers. Next time I make it (which will be this weekend) I will prepare it ahead of time for a better blending of flavors. This is a wonderful winter, company-impressing dish. And easy!!!

I wish I had had some veal stock because I'm sure that makes the difference between 3 and 4 forks. I added a lot more herbs and garlic and it still could have taken more. Made a day ahead. My guests raved. I'd serve it next time with mashed potatoes instead of risotto, altho I know risotto is traditional.

To die for. I had made it only once before, from a different recipe and found it only so-so. I decided to try this version and with was amazing. I made a nice risotto to accompany it. It's wonderful for those times when one craves something different. It's even better as leftovers the next day.

Having recently had a *wonderful* osso buco in Carmel, CA, I was excited about trying this recipe. This was okay....but the veal was *expensive* and the dish was not impressive enough to warrant the cost of ingredients. It was good comfort food, satisfying and rich, but not spectacular.

Love this recipe. Second time I've made it. This time used a nice Cabernet Sauvignon for cooking and served with a great Argentinian Malbec. Added sliced cremini mushrooms and more carrots. I added very good olive oil and a teaspoon or two of lemon juice, salt & pepper to the gremolata because otherwise it tasted bitter. Served with roasted butternut squash. This is an excellent dish!! Specially, if you like to experiment a little bit.

This was great! The only change I made was to use lamb shanks, my husband isn't crazy about veal. After browning I put everyting into a crockpot and left it to cook slowly. Refrigerated overnight and ate it the following day with leftovers to freeze. The flavor was outstanding and the meat fell off the bone. I will definitely make this again.

A fabulous meal for 4, with a bit left over to savor the next day! I added 3 carrots so each diner would have a taste, used red wine because that was all I had on hand, drained the tomatoes, used zest from 1 orange, and used canned beef broth. Prepare ahead and then relax in your hot tub while your meal cooks to perfection in 2 hours.

I wish I could say I was as enthusiastic about this dish as everyone else. I thought it was good, yes - but I truly felt that the orange zest was too overpowering. I was hoping that it would "calm down" during the cooking, but much to my disappointment, it still remained at the finish. I will make this again, but will definitely omit the orange zest and substitute red wine for the white. I served this with grilled asparagus and risotto milanese - both turned out excellent and complemented the veal well. Happy New Year!

Rating: 4
Excellent - simple (except for making the veal stock) and very tasty. Great company dish as it can be prepared ahead of time and improves with a day or more melding of the flavors. I used a 28 oz can of plum tomatoes and red wine instead of white wine. I had liquids fully cover the shanks to ensure even, moist cooking.

Excellent! I added a few tbsps of Madeira. The sweetness balanced the tomato acid nicely. I also added a small amount of celery to the aromatic veggies at the beginning. I also served with mashed potatoes, but wish I had done saffron risotto as suggested.

The dinner was delicious and well liked among a group whose ages were 16 to 49.The meat was extremely tender and well seasoned. I forgot the gremolata at the end because of my company but will try it the next time. I also served it with mashed potatoes because my kids are huge potato fans but will definitely try the risotto next time, which seems to be the customary side. Once I got it in the oven I could relax and get busy with the rest of the meal. You'll love it.
