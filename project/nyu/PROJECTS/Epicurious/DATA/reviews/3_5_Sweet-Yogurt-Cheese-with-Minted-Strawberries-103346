I served this desert after a spiced chicken main course, and it was perfect. I made the recipe exactly as written. It was light and fresh and different. And interesting enough to top off a special dinner party.

The yogurt cheese was nothing special at all - I would have rather just eaten the strawberries alone.

This is my husband's new favorite dessert. I sometimes add strong-brewed flavored coffee to the yogurt mixture to give it a Tiramisu flavor. Using fat free yogurt and fat free cream cheese work very well in this recipe.
