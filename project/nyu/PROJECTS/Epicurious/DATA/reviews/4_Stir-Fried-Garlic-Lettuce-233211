Quick and satisfying. This is a lovely way to eat lettuce in the winter. If you are a Chinese cooking fan, you will already have the sauces on hand. All you need is a bag of romaine hearts in the fridge. Cooks up in no time and is warm and flavorful. A nice healthy meal with a piece of chicken or fish by the side.

Delish, very versatile, I stir fried onions for a few minutes first then proceeded with the recipe as given, at the end added udon noodles and there was my meal. Yum.

Fantastic and super easy recipe. Do it last minute for best results. Goes great with anything and it's light.

I will definitely be making this again! Followed it exactly, and it came out just right. I did an extra table-spoon of sesame oil, and you could probably add some sesame seeds to decoration, but overall this was a winner.
