Easy! Awesome flavours! I take it to my in-laws every Christmas and it is a hit! Perfect with a short-black or macchiato coffee. I change it up adding different nuts, dried cranberries etc. you just can't go wrong!!!

I stumbled onto this recipe last year while looking for something different to have on hand for holiday visitors. This was perfect! It's not difficult to make but tastes like a labor of love. I took G from Hoboken's advice and used the chocolate coating. Delicious! Perfect served with coffee, tea or port. I even sneaked a few thin wedges onto cookie plates that I gave as gifts. Can't wait to make it again this year.

this is wonderful. A good method for candied orange peel can also be found at Saveur Mag. It is worth the time- just do it Turkey day prep weekend and have it ready to go for Christmas baking. folks who disdain fruit/nut confections as being to heavy or cliche'd love this. it is a great gift on its own or as a discntive addition to a cookie offering. different and something folks don't generally make for themselves. i agree with the previous reviewer's chocolate possibility- but there is also a good recipe for chocolate panforte on MSO.com. I make both and give wedges to friends as part of our gifts. be sure to label as they will first love eating and then will ask 'what is this' ?

An interesting confection. It was tasty, just a bit unfamiliar. The nuts, fruits and spices are very similar to fruitcake. The difference is it's contained in a chewy texture (kind of like a tootsie roll or chocolate Riesen). Most of my cooking time was spent chopping and preparing ingredients. Cooking the honey syrup and mixing was easy, though. I, personally, really dislike candied fruit and even though only one thing is candied in this recipe, I felt it dominated the taste. Next time I would leave it out, probably substitute a dried fruit.

As an American of Sicilian decent, I read this recipe with awe & excitement when I realized that the ingredient list sounded exactly like my family's favorite xmas cookie 'Mostacciolli' (no, not the pasta) - a square or diamond-shaped cookie filled with these same ingredients, but covered in chocolate. We were not disappointed - the recipe was well-written, easy & the end result was perfectly authentic in flavor for us. I agree with 'Taxdodger' that the syrup reached the correct temp quickly. Couldn't find candied orange peel this year, so I made my own (NOTE: good recipe on Epicurious for Candied Citrus Peel). My only addition to this already terrific recipe was that I poured melted, bittersweet chocolate over the top, in typical Sicilian dessert tradition: - boil 1/2 c of heavy cream - pour over 6 oz chopped chocolate - stir until dissolved - pour over top of Panforte & refrigerate until firm. I also decorated the top of mine with slices of candied orange peel. BENNISSIMA! We couldn't get enough on Christmas day! As a good friend said of it, "This is filled with all my favorite childhood memories!"

I made this 4 times (3 for a gift for my family). Turned out great. Interesting to make and the flavors are really nice. I hate fruit cake and this is nothing like that. The candied orange peel is just fine! Highly recommended.

This is an interesting combination of fruitcake and chewy fruit/nut candy. No one in my family likes fruitcake but me, but this keeps a long time and can be divided up for gifts. A little goes a long way. No changes to the recipe, except my syrup reached the designated temperature in only a couple of minutes after boiling, so watch carefully. Spices definitely interesting!
