This is a good recipe. The result, however, is VERY crispy and DARK but then we never eat the skin!

This dish was ok. I think the marinade would have been better with some garlic and perhaps less orange zest (1 TBS vs 2). I also think the oven temp is too high as stated. I roasted mine at 375 for an hour and only got a few overly browned spots. I think there are probably better ways to prepare Cornish Game Hens.

This is a wonderful, quick, and easy dish to prepare. This goes well with a side of red potatoes or rice dish.

This is a fantastic dish1 I've made it quite often and have substituted a turkey breast for the hens..delicious...served with jasmine rice and spinach salad - huge hit every time

Great recipe, easy to make, looks fancy with some greens and rice on the side. Make your date think you can cook! Tastes fantastic, even if you're lazy and use orange peel and ground ginger from your spice rack instead of fresh. I made two hens and didn't need to add the broth. I used the Soy Veri Veri Teriyaki sauce as well which is sweet and has a great presentation with the sesame seeds. The skin on the hens burnt a little; I had to turn the pan around about halfway through cooking to prevent complete charring.

Delicious and easy. My first time making game hens. I tied them up and they were nice and juicy. I used the Soy Vey or whatever its called too and it was terrific. Made it with a rice pilaf with apricots and nuts.

I liked this recipe very much. I followed one of the other reviewers' suggestions and did not use the broth and it worked very well. I too used the Soy Veri Veri Teriyaki, which was very flavorful. I had no trouble with burning. I cooked them for more like an hour and a half. I recommend this easy and tasty recipe.

This turned out quite well for me. I did have to watch it closely to prevent burning. I did not have time to let the hens marinade, however, they were still delicious.

I used a teriyaki glaze not the liquid teriyaki sauce in a jar and the recipe was awesome. The skins were brown and edible and the sauce perfect. The meat was tender. I served it with fresh asparagus and a mixture of brown, wild, and red rice sauted with onions, mushrooms, red peppers, garlic, teriyaki, and ginger. A fresh salad and strawberry shortcake for dessert. It was a hit and the perfect meal for a date because there was not a lot of work.

When I prepared this dish, the skin on the hens burnt. Too much sugar? It sounded great, but was disappointed. Any suggestions gladly accepted.

This had a nice flavor (made with Soy Vay Veri Veri Teriyaki and fresh-squeezed OJ), but adding the chicken broth to the sauce was a mistake. There was plenty of sauce without it, and the chicken broth just made it too thin. I ended up using cornstarch to thicken it a bit. Next time, no broth.
