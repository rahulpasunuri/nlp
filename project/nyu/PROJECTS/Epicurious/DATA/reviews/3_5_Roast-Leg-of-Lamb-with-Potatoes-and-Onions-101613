I made this dish for Easter (2011) and it was a great success. Preparation is not that hard. Savory was not part of my recipe, since I couldn't find it. As a suggestion, I would add even more onions.

This was good, especially the potatoes, which were full of flavor. I do wish I had pulled it out right at 130 degrees, though, because it was a little too well done. It went up about 10 more degrees while resting.

Excellent Lamb Recipe

Perfect and easy! Since I didn't have savory in my garden, I used just the thyme and rosemary and added 3 extra garlic cloves. Looking over the reviews, I decided to cook at high temp (425) for the first 20 minutes minus the same amount of time in the recipe. I didn't cook the potatoes before hand due to the comment of them being overcooked. I placed them and the onions with the beef stock salt and pepper in the roasting pan and placed the lamb on top and started from there. After removing the roast and left to rest I changed the oven to broil and slightly browned the potatoes tossing until they were all golden. My roast was 6 3/4 pounds and cooked perfectly, medium rare, rare and a few well done pieces so everyone was happy!

It was a hit - my friends said it was their favorite thing I'd ever made for them, but I thought it was a little bland. Very much a "meat and potatoes" recipe. I'd make the leg of lamb again but probably look for a more interesting preparation.

We loved this!! It was flavorful and the lamb remained tender. The onions and the potatoes were a great accompaniment to the lamb and utterly delicious!!

This was so easy! I skipped the savory (couldnt find it) and used golden delicious potatoes intsead of russet. Go with the fresh herbs and mince them in a grinder. Half an hour into it I squeezed half a lemon over the lamb 'cuz that sounded good in other recipes. Half an hour after that I basted the potatoes with a little reserved beef broth to deglaze the pan and add a little moisture to them then basted the lamb with the pan juices after that. I used a meat thermometer rather than depend on the time and cooked it to 145 and let it stand for about 30 minutes before we were ready to eat. Everyone loved it (some real picky eaters here), it tasted great (and I love lamb), and I can't wait to try it again! This was the easiest thing I've ever made for a special dinner like this! A real keeper.

An excellent dish. You may vary the amounts of onions and potatoes depending on the number of people eating. I use a commercial beef stock which is not too salty. Of course, fresh herbs make all the difference.

Amazing! I used all the fresh rosemary and thyme I bought and skipped the savory. I increased the garlic to 6 cloves. I stuffed as much of this mixture into the lamb as possible and added lots of extra salt to the skin. I started the oven at 425 and reduced then reduced to 400. The potatoes were more of a mash at the end but really good anyway.

If you love lamb, this is the dish for you. I decided to skip the step of putting the garlic slices into the lamb. Instead, I put whole cloves of garlic into the roasting pan with the potatoes. It came out great.

Easy and simple to make and tastes great. And the best thing of all low fat. I did not find it necessary to baste the meat. The evaporating juices in the pan make the oven fairly humid and thus no basting. That is, if your oven is good.

After checking out a few of the leg of lamb recipes on the site I decided to go with this one and I'm glad I did. It was my first try with a leg of lamb and it was delicious. I used a smaller New Zealand spring lamb, adjusting my time accordingly, and the lamb was cooked to perfection. I should have started the potatoes earlier because even after turning up the heat again and leaving them in the oven while the lamb rested they still didn't get the crust that I was looking for. Despite this, it was still a wonderful meal (served with watercress & spinach and yellow beans) and my 14 month old gobbled up the leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day. Thanks for the tip about the basting. I used beer and I'm sure that helped to prevent the meat from drying out.

This recipe was absolutely perfect. All of their flavors complemented eachother so incredibly well. I kept checking the lamb to make sure it wasn't drying out and I added a beer throughtout the cooking time to baste it. I also used a boneless lamb and cooked it for about 1 hour 10 minutes for medium rare. All of my guests loved it. Its a keeper and I will make this again and again.

Although the tastes were good in this recipe, the lamb came out too dry. The recipe states to cook the lamb for 1 hour and 50 minutes for medium rare. That may have been too long as the meat came out dry and tough. Maybe covering the meat would have helped, or basting or searing. I don't know. Is it worth trying again? I don't think it is worth it because a leg of lamb is not exactly inexpensive. Lamb is not supposed to be so dry. I agree that the potatoes were good but try another lamb recipe.

I liked this one but for my own traditional taste i prefer a New Zealand spring instead of local varieties.

Great recipe. Added a bit of red wine, and fresh savory half-way through baking the leg. Potatoes and onions were very yummy too. No lefovers!!!!

It was good but i would have added some juice so baste it. was a little dry.

I made this recipe for my family and everyone agreed it was delicious. Great flavor,and fairly easy to make. I used a boneless leg roast and I didn't boil the potatoes and onions first. I just baked them in the oven for an extra 10 minutes with the beef stock before adding the lamb. It worked out great!

I made this meal in a cook-off (guys against the girls), and nevre having cooked a leg of lamb, I felt this a very easy recipe. The main course made the evening, and the guys prevailed!

The recipe is really easy to follow and the result is delicious, very Provencal. Not a dish bursting with flavor, though -- It's more on the mild side.

This was an excellent preparation for lamb, and very easy. My only note, I used Knorr boullion and felt the potatoes were a little too salty. My husband disagrees and thought they were fantastic.
