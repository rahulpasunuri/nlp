This soup had delicious and complex flavors. I topped with sour cream and sunflower seeds, which really was a nice finishing touch. Taking advise of other posters, I peeled pears and used peel in stock and did not bother straining the soup after pureeing it. Thought the texture was fine without straining. However, it did take many steps, and the clean up (incl 3 pots, 2 pans/sheets) was time consuming. Altho my family loved the soup, I am not sure it is that much better than several other squash soup recipes that I have made, which take far less time to make and clean up.

Didn't have pears available, but apples also work well. Baked the apples, scooped them out of the peels and put the peels in the broth. Swirled with greek yogurt and sprinkled chives on top for a little votive. Doubled batch,to freeze and reheat. Great recipe!

A good review from an inexperienced cook. Made a few mistakes, as I always seem to (put the deglaze reserve in w/ the stock; didn't boil the water for stock before adding everything in. I DID peel the pears before roasting & I think that was a good plan) but it was still VERY tasty. I also didn't do the final step of processing (it's late; I'm tired) & I would say that if you want to make it easy on yourself & don't mind your soup a little chunky it's entirely unnecessary IF you really finely chop the onion before browning it. I thinly sliced mine & now have long (tasty) onion strings in my soup. Everybody has mentioned the pear & the squash, but the onion is the real reason to puree it. It was sweeter than I expected; my pears must have been very sweet; squash as well. Might try a little Worcester or a bit more salt when I reheat the leftovers, but otherwise it has a lovely, warm, satisfying flavour.

So delicious! This soup is wonderful. It has such a light, delicate flavor and a smooth, silky texture. I didn't bother to strain the soup so I can only imagine the texture would be even better had I done that step. Like other reviewers I peeled the pears and used those in my stock.

Delicious. And it can be made in advance of serving, so I don't mind some roasting time or chopping time. It's quite an efficient recipe, making the most of every bit of the ingredients. I followed the recipe 95% - I had that stock bubbling longer than suggested and it may have made for a more flavorful soup. I also started the onions in a splash of crisp white wine instead of butter for my dairy-free-dude, and it was outstanding. I'll make it again for sure. I wasn't afraid of keeping the pear skins on, knowing that my Vitamix can decimate anything. So the texture was restaurant-smooth and bosc pear skins gave the golden soup a subtle fleck that visually hinted at the layers of flavors. Mmmmm.

This is a great recipe. I had a lot of squash and pears from my CSA share to use up. I doubled the recipe with good results. I used a combination of carnival and acorn squash and used sekle pears. I was skeptical about how the stock would turn out but it was really good. I also followed the suggestions of another reviewer and peeled the pears first and threw the peels in with the squash seeds and peels, thus avoiding having to pass the soup through the food mill and saving a step. Served this for a casual lunch with cheese and homemade bread. Everyone loved it, including my 4 y.o and 2 y.o boys. I will make this soup again.

I searched epicurious for all the ingredients I wanted to use after the holidays, and this fantastic recipe appeared! Made just as written, it is delicious, though spices and herbs could be added to one's individual taste. My pears, a holiday gift from my bookkeeper, were heading south and didn't quite meet the "firm, yet ripe" specification, but they performed beautifully, adding pear flavor and texture to every bite. I love the way Deborah Madison maximizes every bit of flavor from the squash, pears, and ginger through roasting, deglazing, and making a stock from the skins and seeds. Though I love the silken texture of the soup, I am trying to find a way to avoid that last step of putting the soup through a sieve or food mill, which triples the time and effort and is the reason for my withholding that last star. I agree with the reviewer who peeled the pears. The peels could be added to the stock for flavor but could be strained out so that the immersion blender would produce a satisfactorily smooth soup.

I loved this recipe. I've always been afraid to do a squash soup and this one is amazing-you truly taste all the ingredients, and it's nice that there aren't that many. I used a butternut squash and otherwise I followed the recipe. The only thing I did that wasn't specified was to peel the pears, but I can't imagine you're not supposed to ... the Bosc pears I used I think wouldn't have tasted good in the soup with the peels on!

This was an exceptional recipe and I disagree with the other reviewers about the need to add additional spices. If you follow the recipe as written, the natural flavor of the squash and pears is made even better through roasting, resulting in a full-bodied and beautiful flavor. It's a little labor intensive, but well worth it.

Since I had baked squash ready to go, I changed the prep by sauteing the pears, chopped, with some garlic and ginger until tender and just starting to brown. I stirred in the squash and some vegetable broth, then added a cup of lowfat milk. I blended the soup with an immersion blender, then added sage, coriander, cinnamon, salt and pepper to taste. It's perfect for my vegetarian daughter!

This is the first soup I have ever attempted to make, and I would have been entirely lost without the recipe. I had an already cooked squash in the fridge, and decided to give this a try. After having read the previous review, I was expecting to add a few spices. I ended up adding some grated horseradish to the stock, two cloves of pressed garlic and one minced thai chili with the onions, and the following spices during the final simmer: ground nutmeg, ground mustard, lots of fresh cracked pepper, salt. When all was said and done, there was a rich flavor from the squash, pear, and ginger, and a nice kick from the chili. In my mind, the pear is what really makes this soup great, so I give it 4 forks.

Soup was yummy and very wintery. Wasn't nearly seasoned enough though. I added pepper to the roasted veg, salt to the onions and more salt and pepper at the soup at the end. Cut the squash in to 1/6 and still took an hour which heavily carmelized the pears (which I liked). Think the creme fraiche is a must if you're not vegan!
