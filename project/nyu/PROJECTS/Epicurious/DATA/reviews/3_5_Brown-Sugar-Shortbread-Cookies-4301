I've been making this recipe since it was published in 1997. I took a copy to college on a recipe card that year and have always found it to be astoundingly good.Whether you follow the recipe exactly, as I did as a novice cook, or adjust it to your taste, you will do well. In the last year I've experimented with making it modestly healthier by using half whole-wheat pastry flour and slicing it into 1x1" diamonds (and then giving away most of the batch). It is also delicious that way, particularly when topped with pecans.

I thought this recipe was great! I did however do a few things different....I only bake for 40 min, and I use a bigger pan than suggested. I used a 9x13 pan and it worked well. I have made this twice now and I would have to say the Do Not over mix is the most important step.

Delicious! I found this recipe using supercook and entering the ingredients I already had in the pantry, and it gave me this! I looked at what others had to say, and I was also a little sad it would take an hour to get my cookies, so I made them in muffin tins. Like I said, they taste great, I'm sure the consistency isn't quite right, they're a little chewy on the outside. Maybe I should have pressed them into the tin more, or put less dough in each tin (I just used one 18-muffin tin), because they still took about 40 minutes. It was really hard to tell when they were done because they turned brown on the edges but they were still so soft. I'm also a bit shaky on creaming butter, I don't know if I had it at the exact right consistency. Bottom line. Good cookies. Oh and I put cinnamon/sugar on half of them and I like it both ways. The cin/sug adds a bit of complexity I think.

Delicious! I took the advice of a few others here. I added a bit of vanilla, left off the sugar/cinnamon topping, finely ground some pecans to add in, and rolled it out onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment. I do suggest rolling these out thin, they are very crunchy once cooled, and watch cooking time. I found on a cookie sheet 35 minutes was enough time. Will definitely make these again, yum!

Delicious and takes only minutes to make. Before adding the flour, I mixed in 1 t. of vanilla, 1 t. of maple extract, and a cup of chopped pecans. Patted into buttered roasting pan (the kind that comes with all standard ovens) and baked at 325 for 25 minutes. Omitted salt (used salted butter) and cinnamon-sugar topping. Yum.

Made these for Christmas gifts and they were lovely. I doubled the recipe and baked them in fluted tart pans - came out great!

This was really easy to bake and I loved how it tasted. Everybody loved it, they were so suprised that I made it from scratch.

I made these in a 7x11 baking dish lined with parchment (for easy removal) and baked them for 50 minutes on the middle rack in the oven. It is one of the easiest doughs to work with, although it is extremely important not to overmix the dough. I served them to my friends at a Tea that I gave. Everyone raved about them.

These were fantastic! I made exactly as instructed and ate several while they were still warm from the oven. They have a very chewy texture and are quite rich. My family loved them and I will definitely be making these again soon.

This recipe was god-awful. Baking for an hour burnt these cookies to a crisp; they were as hard as hockey pocks and tasted about as moist.

This recipe was okay. I made them for gifts and our friends loved them. I might make them again if someone requests. There are much better cookie recpies.

I thought this recipe was great, although I baked on a cookie sheet and for only 40 minutes - they came out perfect. Also, I omitted the cinnamon-sugar topping and served these with lemon curd - really really wonderful.

these cookies are delicious, but i only cook them for 35 minutes in order to keep a fairly soft center. one hour kind of dries them out. perfect with tea or coffee.

Really disappointed by this recipe. Required way too much brown sugar and the taste was very flat. Will never make it again.

This is the best shortbread recipe I've found. Definitely follow the "do not overmix" instruction - I thought mine were seriously undermixed, and they came out perfect! I might lower the amount of cinnamon sugar the next time. I think there's a little too much.

These are so easy to make and absolutely delicious. I accidentally used 1 tablespoon of cinnamon instead of 1 teaspoon, but I think it probably turned out even better. They're very rich though.
