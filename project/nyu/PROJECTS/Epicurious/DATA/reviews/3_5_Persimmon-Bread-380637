Lovely. I agree tho, half the sugar and a bit more fruit!

Bon Appetit recipes have been really disappointing for the last year or so. I used to be able to find many great ideas and recipes that were reliably good and easy to follow. Now, as in this recipe, ingredients list not in logical order,ie grouped together according to sequence. This bread is okay flavor-wise, but the use of butter makes it heavy and 4 large persimmons are way too many for only needing 1 cup. The plus is that the bread is not too sweet and more orange zest would give more flavor.

Doubled this recipe using only 1 2/3 cup sugar, and 2 heaping tsp. of grated orange peel, only dusted raisins with a bit of flour and added 1 1/2 cups of toasted chopped pecans...delicious! I now know I will freeze more persimmon pulp next year just for this recipe.

Good way to use up some persimmons but sugar and butter quantities can be cut in half easily. I used 1/4 cup more persimmon pure instead of 1/4 cup butter and cut sugar in half but still thought this was too sweet. Can't even imagine it with a whole cup of sugar! Also, there is absolutely no need to discard the persimmon skins. I pureed the whole fruit with great results.

I've made 4 double recipes of this now, and this is just a fabulous recipe. I'm fortunate to have a ton of Hachiya persimmons, so I'll be making this a lot more--and my friends and family are VERY happy about that. The bread is very dense, moist, fruity, and uniquely rich-tasting. In doubling the recipe, I used just under 3 Tbs of orange zest (from my neighbor's tree), and I soaked the raisins in 1 cup of the orange juice (which I drained before adding the raisins to the batter). I also added 2 cups of chopped walnuts (for a double recipe). I baked my loaves for about 1 hr and 10 mins; they sank a bit afterwards, but they look like the photo with the recipe otherwise (which also shows a slightly sunken loaf). I can't understand how anyone wouldn't like this. It's a major winner in my book.

it's a bit complicated for baking don't you think? if you ever have time try to visit everything-cake.com, their cake recipes are quite nice and easy to follow

Total failure for me. I followed the recipe EXACTLY, and after 1 hour in the oven I still had a pan full of goo. Gave it another 35 minutes and it's still not properly cooked. The edges are edible -- dense and chewy and tasty -- but the rest of it is going to have to go in the trash.

This was delicious! Dense, and sweet but not too sweet. The persimmon gives a deep, hearty fruit flavor without being overwhelming. I did use less orange peel than called for - the peel of 2 oranges, which was probably closer to 2 tsp. I also found that I only needed 2 large persimmons to get 1 cup of puree (with leftovers!) Will make a great dessert. Used white raisins and found them to be fantastic - don't skip the "plumping" step for the raisins. Definitely a keeper.

Pretty good quick bread -- on the dense side, and very buttery. The 2 tablespoons of orange zest overwhelm the rest of the flavors, wonder how it would be with less.
