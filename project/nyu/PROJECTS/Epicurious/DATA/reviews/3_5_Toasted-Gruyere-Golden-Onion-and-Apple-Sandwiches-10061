Fantastic! I cut the rye into smaller squares and served this as an appetizer at a dinner recently. It was incredible and gone just about instantly.

I served these at a shower as tea sandwiches and they were a big hit. I chopped the apples up and added them to the onions instead of using apple slices. Also, I used balsalmic vinegar instead of white.

A bit messy but good lunch fare.

I made this for a party today and it was so easy to make and tasted great!! The broiling only takes a moment and the cheese melted perfectly. The flavor of the Gruyere goes perfectly with the other ingredients. The rye bread flavor also added a lot to the flavor. I highly recommend this. It was a hit!!
