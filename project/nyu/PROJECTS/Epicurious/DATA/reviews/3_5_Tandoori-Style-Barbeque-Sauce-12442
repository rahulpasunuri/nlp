This was very tasty on the chicken. I added coriander and used fresh ginger. I also baked it. It came out a little dry; however, I didn't cover it to bake which was probably why. I used a stone roaster which didn't have a cover and you're not suppose to use foil with it. Next time I will use a different dish. It was still very good. I'll definitely make it again.

I have made several versions of this recipe. This is the one I like best. I add onion, ground cinnamon and cloves, and substitute fresh ginger for ground. I heat the DRY spices in a small frypan WITHOUT oil over medium heat until they start to release their aroma (about 3 minutes). First process one small white onion, garlic, and ginger to a puree with the oil. Add the remaining ingredients and puree. Marinate skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1 inch cubes, in the mixture overnight. Heat the grill as hot as possible (500 degrees) and quickly cook the chicken tightly bunched on skewers. DO NOT allow the chicken to touch the grill! Use a rack or baking pan to keep the meat above the grill. Cook until moderately browned, about 10 minutes. I find this to produce highly flavorfull and moist tandoori chicken.

I must say this is my first attempt to cook (and eat) Indian food. I ended up adding about 1/2 tsp sugar and a little more salt to suit my taste. I also added some turmeric to the spice mixture. Somehow, my chicken came out overcooked after baking it (covered) for 1 hour at 300F, and broiling it for less than 10 minutes. If I ever make this sauce again, I'll lessen the cooking time. I guess I'm not really a fan of Indian food.

Excellent recipe. I followed some of the suggestions from the other NYC critiquer. I doubled the recipe and added the ground coriander. Next time, I will probably add fresh ginger. I also took his suggestion for baking. came out moist.

This was absolutely fantastic! My brother and I have been working with different ways of preparing it for the last month. My favorite so far was with chicken legs and thighs. I first brined them, then sprinkled with black pepper, covered and baked them in a 325 degree oven for 1 hour. Then, transferred them to the grill with wood chips for smoke flavor. I continually basted them with the sauce. First I seared them right next to the coals, then moved the coals to the bottom to finish. A wonderful crust forms, and they fall off the bone. Fabulous.

I doubled the recipe and marinated eight pieces of skinless chicken in half of the sauce overnight. I then baked the chicken (covered)for 1hr at 300, basted it with the rest of the sauce and put it back in at 350 for another 20-30 minutes. My only modifications were to add ground coriander, fresh ginger and ground dried chilis. The result was one of the best dishes I've made in a while. My wife and I were especially pleased that it didn't contain that much salt.

This makes barbequed chicken taste almost like it came out of a Tandoori oven. Great taste, great recipe.

We barbecue all year round, so I am always looking for something a little bit different. This sauce was very good that even my fussy teenager ate the whole thing. Carefull when cooking the spices; they could burn quite easily. I will make this recipe again, with pleasure!
