This recipe is a great idea! I call it "Faux Sushi." If your couscous doesn't hold together, try adding a little mayonaise. Leave out the ingredients you don't think you'd like in this combination. I plated this on a sashimi plate and balanced hashi (chopsticks) on the corner of the plate. Some people thought it was actually sushi. Try it with deli ham and/or turkey.

The filling had good texture, but it was a very odd combination of flavors that didn't really go with the flavor of the roast beef. I'd try a different couscous recipe here, something with pine nuts and dried cranberries maybe, but this one is just bizarre. Also, this is not finger food--the couscous filling has a tendency to fall out and could get messy.
