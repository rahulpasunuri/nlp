I wish I could give six forks to make up for the review by "A Cook from London," who thought the dish was "really good" but only had two stars to offer. These dumplings are, in fact, really good. Their texture is much more pleasing than that of the fluffy (Bisquick) style.

Firstly, I do not believe in dried herbs with their attendant propensity for woodiness and resistance to rehydration while being quickly cooked. Fresh herbs are always to be prefered - and never scratch the throat on the way down. The basic intent of this recipe is sound; any combination of fresh herbs will suffice. I used sage, savory, and thyme as the dumplings were made to accompany a hearty chicken stew seasoned in like manner. I augmented the milk with 2 Tbls of chicken stock instead of the same amount of milk. I steamed half of the dumplings as the recipe suggests, while the other half were added diractly to the bubbling stew and cooked in the oven. No contest: the dumplings cooked in the stew had far more flavor and a much lighter texture than those steamed over water.

Used buckwheat flour, dried parsley, nutmeg and soy milk. They came out really good! I steamed them on top of a stew (Irish Stew) from this website. I didn't think it was so easy.

These are so good and easy to make. Instead of drop dumplings for stew or for chickne and dumplings...give these a try. Just like when I was a kid. Place these on top of your stew instead of steaming them seperately. Wonderful!
