This was a downer. I think, the reviewer who added the parmesan had the right idea, and if I ever go this route again, and I am thinking that I will not, I would shorten the cooking time for the brussel sprouts and hope for a better texture and a bit more bite.

This was a hit! Was complictaed at first too much preperation. But I will try it again. This time I think I got it down.

I agree with most that this had little taste, however, at the very end, before I served it, I shaved some good parmesan over the dish and that brought out all the flavor. It was wonderful....after the parmesan. I would strongly recommend the addition at the end.

Even the anti-brussel sprout crowd loved this recipe. Easy recipe that is very tasty. I had several people ask for the recipe so they could make it again.

This was pretty blah. It didn't really come together and it didn't hold well for a large dinner. Next time I'm back to serving them with brown butter.

This dish required a significant amount of preparation and was disappointingly tasteless. I would not prepare it again and I would not recommend it. I suggest steaming the sprouts whole, serving with a little butter and maybe some nutmeg!
