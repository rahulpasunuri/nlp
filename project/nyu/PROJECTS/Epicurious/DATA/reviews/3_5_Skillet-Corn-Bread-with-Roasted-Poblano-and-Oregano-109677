Delicious easy little cornbread recipe. But I agree with the others, absolutely use 2 problanos, and as a hint, when peeling them, it's OK not to have them perfectly clean, do not rinse with water or you will have just removed all the flavor that they were roasted for.

We really liked this, but I didn't make it in a skillet. Made this the other night in an 8x8 pyrex dish and I ended up baking it for 40 minutes. I also used 2 poblanos and I can't imagine one being enough.

Easy to make, moist yet it does not fall apart. Wonderful flavor.

After searching for what we could do with our garden poblanos, I'm so glad we happened upon this recipe! It is light, moist, flavorful, with the perfect crust. We'll definitely make again. Yum!

I made this corn bread as a side for the Ultimate Ribs from the same July 2004 issue. I'm not a real corn bread fan but this recipe was super easy and turned out a beautiful presentation. My friends and family that tried it all loved it. I used about 2 tsp. dried oregano instead of fresh.

This is a great staple recipe to have on hand and is perfect to go with a big bowl of soup or chili. I could also see this being a huge crowd pleaser for brunch. It's quite simple, and if I could make one ammendment, it would be to double the amount of poblanos.I know, that sounds like a lot, but poblanos are really pretty mild on the scale of chiles and using 2 roasted/peeled/diced peppers would really give the bread the boost that it needs. All in all though, a great recipe.
