Love this salad !!!!! I followed true to recipe and it was amazing. I served it with jerk chicken and a green salad with olive oil, lime salt, and pepper dressing. This is my new potato salad! The family was very impressed!

I added 2 extra slices of bacon, left out the hot pepper sauce and the cayenne. Wonderful summer side dish!!

It would be much better with fewer potatoes

I love this recipe! It is a great alternative to regular potato salad. I am going to make it again for a party in January!

We really enjoyed this recipe, it seemed to grow on us. I had to omit the tumeric but I added a bit more dry mustard in it's place. I used dried thyme but will use fresh next time. Try this one!

I thought this was a very good recipe and would make it again. It was a nice variation from a typical potato salad. I served it as part of a caribbean themed dinner. Rather than mix the hot sauce in with the other ingredients, I tossed it with the warm potatoes. I think this added a little more flavor to the potatoes themselves.

I'm not sure what makes it jerk? I can't taste the spices very much. It's still pretty good though. It's hard to go wrong with potatoes, bacon and eggs. I added chopped serano chilies too and that definatly made it more interesting.

I found this quite enjoyable. Nothing astounding, but a good pantry-clearer. I will probably make it whenever I want an accompaniment to a Janaican-style entree

Good flavorful bacon, extra hot sauce and perfectly cooked potatoes make this recipe fabulous. A lot of work, but we make this at least once a year.

Every time I have made this my guests have all said that it's the best potato salad that they have ever had. It is so much more interesting than standard potato salad.

A disappointment. The potatoes overwhelmed and blanded out the rest of the recipe, even when I increased the bacon, celery and cornichons. It tasted like plain ol' mustard potato salad with a mildly spicy mayo based dressing. Skip this one!

My husband and I have made this recipe at least once a year since we saw it in BOn Appetit. We make it when we have jerk chicken. Compared to other kinds of potato salads for a Jamaican kind of meal you can't do any better. We tend to add a bit more hot sauce (red chinese pepper sauce) and a little bit of vinegar.

I was a little hesitant to make this after reading the other reviews, but the risk was worth it. I made it for a Jamaican cookout, and it was a big hit. The turmeric gave it the color of a mustard-based potato salad; not at all scary to me, nor to the others who raved about it.

It took a few bites to get accustomed to the flavor. I would definitely make it again. The combination of flavors gives it a different tasting potato salads

I made this recipe for a Caribbean themed dinner party. It was okay. I parboiled the potatoes with the skin on and then grilled them in the oven. This gave a little flavor... not much. I think the American version of potato salad is much better. The tumeric made the salad a "nuclear yellow" color and was a little scary.
