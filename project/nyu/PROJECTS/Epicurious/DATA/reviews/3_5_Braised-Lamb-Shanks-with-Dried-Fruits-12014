I absolutely love this dish. I make it every year on the first nice spring day in April. I also use dried pears in the dish for a more subtle fruit flavor. It's always outstanding with the guests.

I've made a pork stew with apricots and prunes and it was very well received,so this one was a go. I love complicated meat dishes, both in execution and taste. Love it.
