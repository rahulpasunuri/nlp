I thought it was great but I added lots of red pepper and parmesan for a little bite.

Why too much trouble. Puree is over salted.

A lot of expense. Little taste.

This dish looked really gorgeous, but I didn't enjoy the flavor or texture. I found the whole combination pretty disappointing.

This dish was great!. I am an avid fan of eggplant, roasted red peppers and chick peas. I look for any dish with these ingredients. It is excellent of you are a vegetarian (I am not). The left-overs were just as good the next day for lunch!

I wasn't crazy about the eggplant & chikpea puree by itself, but in the final dish all the different flavors came together. The meal was delicious and impressive looking. Definitely one I will serve to guests. I toasted the pine nuts first, and used orange and yellow peppers. Shitakes are a must.

In contrast to other reviewers I thought this recipe was full of robust flavor. I loved the basil and lime and everything just melted in my mouth. I had wonderful orange peppers with a strong flavor which might have made the difference. The only thing that I will change for the next time is the shitake mushrooms. They were just too tough after only 2 minutes of saute while the button mushrooms were too limp. This dish has a beautiful and impressive presentation.

Sound like it should be good, but it's too bland. Most of the recipes on this site are great, however. Hang in there!

Even though i took the advice from the other reviews and tripled the garlic, it was really bland. all the flavours mixed together so well that you didn't distinguish them from one another. it was terribly healthy and pretty but disappointing. Also, the other reviewers had much to say about the pine nuts but since they are so expensive in hawaii, we used macadamia nuts which were rich and pleasant.

The recipe as shown is a bit bland, but it's beautiful to look at. I think that the cherry tomatoes added a bit too much moisture and "watered down" the flavor of the other ingredients. I used mixed mushrooms (shitake, oyster, crimini & button) and that worked quite well. Next time I make this, I'll roast some red & yellow peppers to add to the mushroom topping and omit some tomatoes. Also, some chopped basil, parsley or thyme will add some nice color and flavor to the mushrooms. Don't forget to toast the pignoli. Finally, the lime in the puree was a bit overpowering. (maybe because I used key limes??) but next time I'll go with lemon juice in my puree. I'm looking forward to making this again with my changes... It's a great dish to make since all the ingredients are in season. Oh yes, one added bonus -- my 2 year old ate all of the puree and roasted pepper! (He passed on the tomato/mushroom topping.)

A terrific and impressive dish to serve to guests!

I enhanced the recipe by adding more garlic and toasting the pine nuts. When I make it again, I'll add some spices to the stuffing mixture as it was a bit bland. On the positive side, it is healthy vegetarian dish.

This side dish received rave reviews by my husband who likened it to "restaurant quality" gourmet. It was time consuming, but well worth the effort. I highly recommend it with a simple meat dish.
