I absolutely LOVED this recipe and so did everyone else who tried it - easy and fail proof and so pretty on the plate!

I did not like this at all. The sugar never turned brown but hardened. It took an additional 30 minutes to bake. Taste was OK. I would not make this again.

I love flan. I also love Mexican hot chocolate. This recipe brought two of my favorite treats together, and it turned out perfectly. I didn't use the canela cinnamon, only because I forgot to buy it. I used the more traditional cinnamon stick, and it turned out just fine. Very creamy, with the perfect balance of chocolate and a slight hint of cinnamon. This recipe is a keeper and I'll be posting it on my food blog within the week.

Yes! Yes! Yes! (or si! si! si!). Excellent. Made exactly per instructions, with canela & Ibarra, but put it in a pie pan & cooked it 10 minutes extra.Cut down the sugar in the flan slightly (because that's the way we like it.)A guest brought lots of fresh cup-up fruit, and whipped cream. Thank you Topolobampo - my favorite restaurant when I'm in Chicago! (tip: don't unmold on a flat plate - there's caramel sauce on the bottom!)
