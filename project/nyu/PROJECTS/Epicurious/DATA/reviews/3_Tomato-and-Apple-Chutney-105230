I'd prefer it without orange juice, cause it tastes similar to ponche and with less sugar.

THIS RECIPE IS REALLY GOOD - BUT NOW I AM GOING TO TRY IT USING MY UNRIPENED GREEN TOMATOES THAT WE HAVE PLENTY OF IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST! I WILL LET YOU KNOW HOW IT TURNS OUT.

The instructions tell you to let the chutney's flavors develop for a month or so and that is correct. Good flavor with a hint of clove. I've been making my own chutneys from scratch for 4 years and I look forward to making this one every year with the tomato season. Go for IT!
