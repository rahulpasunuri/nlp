Fantastic! Very labor-intensive but worth it. A couple of tips: 1) spread the risotto on a baking sheet and refrigerate for a couple of hours...makes it much easie to work with. 2) experimented with freezing and they're perfect. Make them, fry them, let them cool down and freeze. Then reheat for about a half an hour at 325. They taste just as good as when first made.

I made this dish few weeks ago and I was kind of disapointed... Flavors were good, but somehow something was missing. I did use another kind of cheese and maybe that was a bad idea, but then again, usually it's only mozzarella in these balls. If I ever have some risotto left, then I'll do it again, but I will not go thru the trouble to do one just for this recipe.

This aArancine is great! Yes, you use fresh risotto because all of the risotto is used in making the arancine. I find this to be a particularly great late summer dish, as the risotto can be slightly heavy but the citrus really keeps it fresh and lightens it a bit. Using the Etorki cheese is awesome. Its a slightly sweet, and almost caramelly taste. I served this Citrus Arancine with bacon lardons, a green tomato relish, and lightly dressed greens. Perfect appetizer for a home-cooked gourmet dinner for the special someone in your life.

I am excited to try this recipe, as arancini (arancine?) were a memorable part of our trip to Sicily. However, the arancini we had there were large-almost baseball sized. Eating one would fill you up for days.

Why waste fresh risotto by frying it? Go the leftover route. I did and it was so so.
