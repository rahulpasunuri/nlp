Ridiculously easy and really good. I did add extra blueberries, however.

You will want to double this recipe + even more blueberries. This muffin cake is so delicious, and tastes award-winning. The ingredients meld so well together, and the result make it seem like a lot of effort was put into it - when in reality it is so simple. Absolute find!

Nothing special. I doubled the amount of blueberries but otherwise made as directed.

These were pretty yummy and easy to make. Next time I'll add raw sugar to the top along with the coconut. I also used jumbo muffin tins so they were a little bigger.

P.S. I took these to my work for coworkers and then made a double batch for my customers at a small boutique. I have had at least half a dozen requests for the recipe and have sent it out to friends and family just because I think they're that good.

I loved the combination of the lime, coconut and blueberries. I used wild Canadian Sheild blueberries and added more because they are small. I also used sweetened coconut. I will definately make more of these!

Simply great! Used brown sugar instead of white, orange zest as I had no limes on hand, and added a tiny dash of almond extract (I really like how the almond melded with the flavors of the blueberries and coconut).

These were good, and certainly easy to make. They turned out a little denser than I'd expected. I made the blueberry puree and heated it up before pouring on top--I think that made these better.

I loved this but made the following changes: - double the blueberries - add 1 oz of Cointreau I suspect that some Coconut flavoured rum would also add a interesting touch. The lime zest is the best part, don't skip!

I baked these in 2 small mini loaf pans, toasted the coconut that went into the batter and added another 15 minutes to the baking time. The response was so favorable, I put them in gift baskets for my sons wedding and hand them out during the holidays.They freeze perfectly.

This recipe was wonderful. I also made these in mini bundt pans and served them with whipped cream and fresh blueberries. The lime zest gives it a slight citrusy taste that balances out the density and sweetness. I will definitely make these again!

We served these at our B&B for Valentines day, substituting raspberries for the blueberries, and cooked them in heart-shaped muffin tins. They present themselves beautifully and guests were delighted. Great served with a side of creme fresh and more raspberries or strawberries. We'll be making these for many special-occasion breakfasts.

Wonderful! I baked the batter in miniature Bundt pans and served them warm on a plate with blueberry puree and topped with fresh whipped cream, fresh coconut and more whole blueberries. My guest were not only impressed with the presentation, they also finished every bite of dessert. :)

These were a party in your mouth--moist, delicious, very different! My husband made a funny face when he first tried them. Then, he asked for another. When I went to place the others in a container, I noticed another half of another one was gone. I also used 2.5 times the blueberries called for--perfect amount!

These little cakes are delicious! Just the right amount of sweet and a yummy chewy top. They would be elegant enough for a special dinner with a little bluebery sauce and a dollop of lemon sorbet...if you can keep them around that long! Very versatile!

I took these "muffins" to work and they were gone in less than 15 mins. I also think they needed more blueberries. The coconut added a great flavor. Would definately make this again and again.

Yuck! i did substitute orange and lemon zest for lime zest but i think the muffins would have been just as bad w/ lime. The coconut did not seem to work at all! Everyone in my family agrees- double yuck and a waste!

Delicious. I have to agree with the reviewer from Rye Brook, however - these aren't at all what I expected them to be. They have a lighter texture than other pound cakes, and taste far more like (buttery) muffins. I had hoped for something different, but still enjoyed these. They were gone in a matter of hours.

Wonderful! Made these for breakfast in Texas muffin tins and doubled the blueberries. The coconut toasts on top of the muffins to make them extra tasty.

These are very delicious miniatures cakes. Although small, they are surprisingly dense. They're excellent for a small desert, but the blueberries make them a nice, quick breakfast treat also. My neighbors beg me to make these for them whenever I can. I've probably made 10-15 dozens of these cakes since discovering the recipe. I don't know how well they keep b/c mine have never lasted long enough to find out.

I wasn't overly excited over this recipe. I added more blueberries to the recipe as well and made them in cupcake papers. They were OK, but not as great as I thought they'd be. The blueberries that I used were nice big juicy plump ones, but the cakes were just OK, I'm not going to make this recipe again, I know of others that are better.

We loved these muffins. They were scrumptious.!! We added more blueberries than the recipe called for (3/4 -1 cup) and doubled the recipe with great success. We used cupcake papers and we wound up with about 2 dozen muffins. Too bad we couldn't bring ourselves to share them with our family and friends! Only kidding. They loved them too, even the coconut haters.

My husband and I both loved these "muffins". And those that I took to work were well-received. I'll definitely make these again many times. I added more blueberries than the recipe calls for and would probably add even more next time, though.

I just couldn't get excited about these cupcakes. Maybe if I'd poured a lemon sauce or blueberry sauce over them I'd have enjoyed them more. And the texture wasn't what I'd expected either, given the title of the recipe.

Absolutely wonderful! These rich little cakes blew me away, and even my mother who doesn't like coconut loved them. They were not only unbelievably quick and easy to make, but also tasted great.

These were a big hit at my restaurant. We served them slightly warm with a lemon custard sauce ---YUM...We called them babycakes!

A pleasant alternative to blueberry muffins. These have a bit more body, and went in a flash at a July 4th barbecue in Berlin, Germany.

This recipe is easy to double (I never make small quantities even though there're only 2 of us - I like to share). I used paper cupcake cups which made cleanup easy. I didn't have enough lemon rind, so added some vanilla - tasted and smelled wonderful! Did not rise all that much, so it was okay to fill the cups to the top - didn't overflow. Very easy, moist, and tasty! I will make this often!

Wonderful! And so easy! Like the other rater, I used unsweetened coconut. Also, I skipped the lime peel and used buttermilk instead of cream (just what I had on hand). Got rave reviews!

I substituted unsweetened coconut for the sweetened....divine.
