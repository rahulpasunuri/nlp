I was not at all dazzled by this recipe. To me it tasted like a very standard chocolate cake recipe, which might be fine if you're looking for a low fat cake option. I did substitute fresh plums, as suggested by 2 other reviewers and perhaps the baby food kind would have been better (perhaps providing a moister cake??). I didn't know what to expect as far as the recipe being termed a "pudding", but it was not super moist or pudding-like in any way. Perhaps the baking time is a bit too long?? I also cut the sugar in half as suggested by other reviewers and am glad I did; it would have been way too sweet otherwise. I also did not make the sauce, but have since added some chocolate ganache/frosting to jazz it up a bit. If you're looking for an easy, low fat chocolate cake, this is a decent option but definitely nothing dazzling.

Very good recipe. I used half the sugar, and made it with chopped prunes (about 10oz) as I could not find prune baby food. It was very moist and flavorful. They freeze very well too. I made the Cinnamon Rum Sauce for the frozen ones as the previous reviewer suggested, and it did not go together at all. The Rum Sauce overwhelmed the plum pudding, and you could savor neither the pudding nor the sauce (which is very good in itself, particularly on vanilla ice cream).

This is a great and very simple recipe. I used an 8" springform pan and sliced it like a cake. Served it with Cinnamon Rum Sauce (made with Gosling's Black Seal Rum). A real hit.

This was good. Real good. I used 1 cup of normal prunes chopped instead of baby food, 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 tablespoon dark treacle instead of the castor sugar and added a handful of walnuts.

This is easy to make and was a big success.
