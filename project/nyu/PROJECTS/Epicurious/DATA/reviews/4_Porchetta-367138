I'm planning on making this for Easter, and I'm wondering if this can be cooked the day before serving. If so would this be sliced and reheated or reheated whole prior to slicing? Also there's no mention of any sauce or gravy.....are there enough drippings to be able to make gravy with? Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks!

My husband and I had fun making this. We're touring Europe in a motorhome and are in Portugal where pork is plentiful and cheap. Cooked it on the barbie so no worries about messing the oven. The fat from the belly basted the roast and the end result was deliciously tasty and not fatty at all....it's a real showstopper. La grand camping cuisine.

I have made this recipe three times to applause from those around the dining table. What I have discovered is that it is not necessary to have the "skin on" the pork belly. My opinion is that it is preferable without and encourages those enjoying the meal to dive into the belly rather than push it aside. This is an outstanding entree. I took the drippings from the most recent preparation and made a silky gravy using fresh orange juice and crushed fennel; sieved the gravy twice. Fabulous.

Made this for a New Year's Eve dinner and wow! was it amazing. Absolutely worth the work. A couple of notes: we did the assembly and let the roast sit overnight in the fridge before roasting. Also, the recipe calls for a center loin roast, NOT a tenderloin, although the two are sometimes called the same thing. Tenderloins are much smaller and have less fat (and less flavor, imo) - short explanation here http://www.porkbeinspired.com/Cut_LoinRoast.aspx Using a center loin, I don't think you need to brine. We didn't and the results were amazing. There is a lot of fat in the belly, I don't think I'd make this for a fat-phobic crowd.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly except for how long to cook it. Since it cooked at a high temp for the first 40 minutes I cooked it on the grill outside in a broiler pan. That way I didn't mess up the oven and have lots of smoke in the house. I brought it into the oven for the 300 degree cooking but only cooked it 1 hour and 15 minutes. Then I let it rest for 40 minutes and it was moist and delicious. I didn't eat the pork belly but some did. The flavor of the pork loin is incredible. I got the pork belly at a local farmers market. I am definately going to make this recipe again.

I will make this again after I forget how much a pain in the a$$ it was to clean up the oven. I will never forget the way the pork loin tasted. It is, hands down, the best pork tenderloin I've ever had. However, the pork belly is kind of a throw away. It is necessary to develop the flavors in the tenderloin but most of my guest just cut around it. The skin was nice and crisp but not really edible and spewed grease over the entire oven for 40 minutes until the heat was reduced. I rate the taste 4+ forks and the prep/clean up 2 forks. Not for the faint at heart.

This was a very good recipe, but I will probably not make it again. It was quite a bit of prep time and most of my guests cut around the pork belly. I received very good compliments, but I thought the fennel was overpowering, so if you don't like fennel, I wouldn't make this recipe. Also, if you could the roast an. Additional 2 hours, it will be way overcooked. I cooked mine for an hour and 15 minutes and got it to medium.

WOW! This was worth the expense and effort. I assembled the porchetta on Friday and roasted it on Sunday. I didn't grind the spices but instead cracked them and mixed with the garlic and sage. Otherwise, followed the recipe as written. This was one of the most impressive and delicious roasts I've ever made. A huge crowd pleaser, and I'm looking forward to making it again.

For those who said you made it in advance, did you just assemble in advance or actually cook the whole porchetta the day before? What did you do to reheat before serving?

Succulent, simple and impressive. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I purchased a jar of fennel salt from Williams Sonoma that contains fennel pollen as well as salt and fennel seed. Fennel pollen is authentic to Italian porchetta. I served it with roasted fingerling potatoes, figs and garlic (NYTimes.com), and sauteed broccoli rabe.

This is truly fabulous - and easy. If you can find pork belly,that is - easier in urban areas, or in areas where people understand the beauty of the pig belly. Just simple herbs and great pork flavor. And the dogs LOVE the pork cracklings. A definite keeper.

Great success and worth the work. A couple of suggestions- I was able to find pork belly no problem at a local chain supermarket but needed to be specific about some aspects. Had to ask for it boneless, and order it by dimensions not by weight (about 8 x 20 in.)Re Q's from another review, I would not recommend brining the roast since it was very moist just with the fat from the belly but I guess you need to watch the internal temp carefully. I also would not add additional spice mix- what's in the recipe was plenty spicy. (and the recipe does say to rub it on the roast as well as the belly.) Finally, as the recipe says, you'll need a (large) serrated knife to carve it, and serrated knives to cut and eat it with. Skin's too tough to eat with non-serrated knives- a mistake I made when setting the table...

This was really delicious! I can't wait to make it again the next time we have company. I felt so relaxed having everything done 2 days ahead. I served it with some oven roasted potatoes and sauteed kale. If you have trouble finding pork belly try the Asian markets-they also have really good prices on meat!

I have not made this as yet, but dying too. questions to others. To me it would make sense to brine the pork loin, whilst letting the pork belly air dry. (hey if it's going to take 2 days) I think I would also make a bit more of the spice mix and put in on the loin prior to wrapping the belly around the loin. Does this make sense?

All eight guest said it was among the top pork meals they had ever had. It was a challenge finding pork belly at generic grocery stores but could be ordered through an ethnic market. Finally, through a restaurant contact I was able to secure a 2 inch thick belly WITHOUT THE SKIN. They rolled out the belly to a perfect fit around the pork. With that much fat it is obvious a deep roasting pan is needed. The recipe was followed exactly. The meat and belly cost $51 but was so worth it.

This is absolutely delicious!!! Served it to 8 people and everyone loved it. The only change I would make is to take it out of the oven at 130 degrees and let it sit for 30 min. as instructed. It was a little dry when I took it out at 145 degrees. Served it with the Domino potato recipe and the brusel sprout and radicchio recipes from the Oct. issue. All were just fabulous. Can't wait to make it again. Barbara Buss

This was a big hit. My guests loved the crispy outer layer and moist meat on the inside. One of my guests made it the previous week and reported that it was a bit dry. This was not the case for me. I attended to the length of time I cooked it and made sure that it was not too dry. I would make it again. Well worth the effort.

this is a very famous dish in Milford, MA. At Christmas people wait in line outside Olivas Market their Christmas Porchetta. If you have an Italian butcher nearby they may know how to assemble it for you. This has been a tradition in my family for generations, no one really eats the pork belly it's mostly for flavor, remember what emeril says's pork fat rules!

The presentation was amazing, it looks wonderful but there was too much fat. The pork loin was delicious but all but one guest left the pork belly on their plate. The exterior skin was delicious. This recipe is expensive and a lot of work but was almost unappetizing, I would not make again.

Made this dish for a dinner party this weekend, and it was awesome--well worth the time it takes to assemble! I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I did end up adding orange slices without the skin because I just assumed it called for a peeled orange. Even still, everything came out perfect, and my guests loved it.

If you do nothing else this year make this Porchetta that Bon Appetit calls the Dish of the Year. Served it last night to 6 regular dinner guest. Praise came from the time they walked in the house and smelled the aroma and then saw the roast all the way through dinner. Followed the recipe exactly as written. The temperature and timing of the cooking was perfect. Make this two days in advance, it is a little time consuming but saves you time on the day of the dinner. Served it with the Saveur...Zucchini, almonds and pecorino romano recipe and used Italian Zucchini. Also roasted new potatoes with O/O, salt on a bed of fresh sage bundles at 350* for 1 hour.
