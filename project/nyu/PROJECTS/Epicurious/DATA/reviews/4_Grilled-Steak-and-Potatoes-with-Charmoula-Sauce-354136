one of the few things I have made that got a request for an encore so soon. I mashed the potatoes and served with grilled corn on the cob, on which I also used the Charmoula.

We made the charmoula with smoked paprika, and grilled fresh peppers instead of jarred, which really gave this a Spanish twist. The sauce is what makes the dish. We thought it was great!

Excellent dish that didnt depend on garlic to make it tasty. I substituted the garlic for grilled shallot which I grilled beside the steak. A great change of pace, no one minded that we had eaten steak the night before. Serve the sauce drizzled over the top
