I'm a fresh food snob, but after repeatedly washing, then trimming, wilting, draining, squeezing and chopping 5 large bunches of spinach, I was left with what looked and tasted EXACTLY like chopped frozen spinach. Next time I will definitely go that route instead. I agree with A Cook from NYC that once you've got your spinach ready, you can really just eyeball the remaining ingredients and adjust it to your tastes. Nice side dish. It will be even better next time when I eliminate half the steps and just open a box of the frozen chopped variety.

My attempt at this dish turned out bitter. Make sure you have fresh staples in yyour pantry. The sesame oil and seed I had on hand had probably gone rancid and caused the bad taste.

This reminds me of my Korean mother's spinach. It's good with rice and Korean kalbi or another Korean rib recipe.

This recipe was very good, a twist on spinach that was simple to make. I toasted the Sesame seeds in a toaster oven instead, because I was pressed for time and wasn't sure how the pan toasting would turn out. Squeezing the water out of the spinach was a little difficult. Also, you really do need a lot of raw spinach to result in a decent amount of cooked spinach. I only used three bunches of spinach and it cooked down to what seemed like one cup of spinach.

This sounds like the korean namul - when we make this we plunge the spinach into boiling water for just a moment, and then we cool in ice water and drain immediately - it helps to keep the crunch!

Don't worry too much about measuring any of these ingredients exactly. Make the amount of spinach that you feel is adequate (frozen cooked spinach is an easy substitute here)--eyeball it if you like--and you can add the rest of the ingredients by taste.

It says to use five large bunches for eight servings. If you only used one bunch, of course it was barely enough for two. Eight divided by five is 1.6. I don't think your experience implies that the recipe wasn't tested.

This goes down as one of those recipes not tested before being published. I used a large bunch as specified. I also only cooked at high heat for two minutes, not 4 minutes. Four minutes would be way too long. The resultant amount of spinach was only barely enough for two people. Also, I would not squeeze out the water before chopping. The spinich should be barely wilted. It tasted good.

Simple, light salad. For 2, I added 3 cloves of sliced garlic and next time I would decrease the amount of oil.
