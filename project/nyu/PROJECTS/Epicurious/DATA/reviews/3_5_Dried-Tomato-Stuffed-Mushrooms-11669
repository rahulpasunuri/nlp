We found this disappointing. I foloowed the recipe to the letter. After 20 minutes in the oven they still weren't cooked. The flavor was just OK, nothing special.

So very delicious. I made these with "baby" portobello mushrooms. So, based on the reviews, I added extra sun dried tomatoes (probably 2 1/2 or 3 tbsp total) and extra bread crumbs. Very easy to make, also.

This was awesome. I really loved the flavors, I served it over a mushroom risotto and all my guests loved it. I do have to say that the previous reviewers were right, it needed more stuffing, i added a whole box of minced baby bellas and it was just enough filling. Delicious and healthy.

Loved this, quick and easy for dinner parties. I chop up the stems and then add the same amount again of sun-dried tomatos, which seems to make for a good balance.

Very tasty for stuffed mushrooms. I used olive oil instead of butter, s.d. tomatoes not packed in oil, along with finely diced cherry tomatoes and a very generous heaping of green onions. The presentation could not have been more beautiful, and the taste impressed everyone as well.

Great for a party! These were gobbled up as soon as I brought out a new tray. I substituted canned roasted peppers for the sun-dried tomatos, which kind of defeats the purpose of the receipe, but it was great. Also added a little tobasco and garlic. If you multiply the recipe by 10, as I did, it doesn't make enough stuffing for all the mushrooms.

this recipe was so simple and great! I wowed everyone with this simple appetizer. I'm making it again for relatives to impress them. Definately a winner.

This was good and simple to make but you taste the mushrooms more than the stuffing. Nex time I'll try to buy slightly larger mushrooms and cram more stuffing into the caps.

This was SO GOOD! I took the advice of another reviewer and minced a few extra mushrooms for the filling--glad I did! I doubled the recipe for a small gathering, and it was the first dish emptied.

I think the cooking time is wrong. I made this twice, and checked both times at ten minutes and they were done.

I omitted the breadcrumbs and cheese and instead added some cream cheese (low fat is fine)and dried thyme. I followed the advice to chop some extra mushrooms to bulk out the filling. Also microwaved then grilled rather than put on the oven for one small side dish. Made double quantities and every morsel vanished - between 2!

I made this recipe on a whim and what a hit! I had been given 5 stars by my dinner guests. However, you may want to add a little more substance to the stuffing, the tomatoes and shallots cook down rather significantly. Possibly mincing more mushrooms for the stuffing would be appropriate. I also suggest adding a touch of romano to the mix. It adds a little something extra.
