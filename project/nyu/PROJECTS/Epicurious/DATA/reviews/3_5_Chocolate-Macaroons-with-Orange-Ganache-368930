There are a number of things wrong with this recipe: 1) Ingredients should be weighed not measured in cups because humidity affects the volume of ingredients and by using measuring cups. 2) The time it takes to pulverize almonds takes longer than 90 seconds. And if the large pieces of almonds are sifted out, this would change the volume of the almonds required to make a picture perfect macarons. 3) I don't get why the extra 3 tablespoons of eggwhites are added into the meringue and not simply whipped along with the rest of the whites. 4) The requirement to use 61% cacao or less makes no sense to me. The higher the cacao content, the better quality results you'd get from it. Have ever tried using Hershey chocolate that has about 30% cocoa or less? You be the judge. 5) The amount of cloves in this recipe is crazy. And so is the addition of allspice and salt. Maybe I'm just a purist, but if you want those spices in your ganache, you might as well make a pumpkin pie instead. I do think the the contributor meant to leave out important notes and added ingredients in this recipe. The recipe is not meant to be followed, but use it as an "inspiration?" Then don't bother. The ingredients in this recipe are expensive. It's such a disservice to mislead the readers by giving an "inspiration" rather than an accurate recipe. At least give a warning that macarons are tough to make if you don't have the right tools and ingredients. It's not your typical chocolate chip cookie, folks. It takes experience, and knowledgeable contributors or at least those who don't intentionally mislead, to make or share this type of pastry. Otherwise, don't waste your valuable ingredients and time with it.

Earned 1st place in our neighborhood holiday cookie exchange contest with these, so they were good! I used silpat on 2 trays, parchment on the 3rd, and the silpat cookies cooked better (smooth, flat, no cracks). My bittersweet chocolate is 70% cacao, so I mixed it with semisweet at 61% cacao (@1.5 ounces each). I used 1/4 tsp. cloves because I was concerned 1/2 tsp. cloves would overpower the flavor. Easy, just a bit time-consuming. Sized at between quarter and half-dollar diameter (they spread as they sit for the 10 minutes). Baked as directed for 16 minutes, turning once, and they were fine on the silpat. Very well received at our party! I now use silpat for every cookie, as success is consistent.

Since most of these review are actually complaints about spelling and cultural differences, I'll try to be helpful. This was not my first time making macarons, but use weight measurements instead. So, I was a little uneasy abou this recipe, but it mostly ok. Pulsing the almond/powdered sugar mixture takes awhile,mostly to get the almonds to the appropriate texture for sifting. I prefer an almond flour/ground almond based recipe for this reason. Also, the macarons turned out hard after baking (before refrigerating), which has never happened to me before. Maybe it had something to do with the 16 minute baking time? Anyway, it seems silly to overcook the macarons, just so you can put them in the refrigerator overnight and they soften up. Most recipes I've used bake for 8-10 minutes and the macarons are ready to eat after cooling. However, the flavor of the macarons and the ganache were great. I would just go with a more traditional (i.e., weight-based) recipe in the future. Also, my batch produced much more than the recipe stated. I got probably around 120-140 cookies, making 60-70 sandwiches. All in all, I think this kind of a bastardized version of macaron-baking and, given that this is from Bon Appetit, they should trust that their readers are capable of executing a more complicated recipe.

I think the point the 'Cook from Boston' might be trying to make is that in common American kitchen parlance, a "macaroon" refers to the chewy baked coconut cookie, and a "macaron" is the light pastry sandwich filled with a flavored ganache. Methinks there is no hard and fast rule on that, but it can lead to some confusion. All of which is off topic. Do they have to be piped? Has anyone tried just dropping spoonfuls?

Disappointed to find that this recipe was not our more American version of a macaroon. Perhaps I will use it to inspire me like another reviewer stated

This recipe sounds delicious and it will be my first MACAROON/MACARON recipe. May we all, Americans and our friends & neighbors near & abroad, share, enjoy and celebrate our recipes together (their written, spoken and cultural variances as well:-)I, too, used to believe that a food snob was the cool thing to be. I've found that for me, it's much more fun and educational to be open to all of the above and cook/bake/share with an open heart and an open mind. Please give yourselves the gift of that freedom. Happy Holidays to All!

To Pammers from Tualatin, the "layer" showing above and underneath the ganache is the foot from the macaron. The picture does match the recipe. Can't rate yet, but I always weigh my ingredients when baking macarons, so I don't think I'll be following this recipe other than for inspiration.

The picture does not match the recipe. The picture shows an additional layer of something (macaroon mixture?), above and underneath the ganache.

To the "cook from Boston". How petty! they are Macarons in France and, perhaps in Quebec and other French-speaking regions of Canada. In America, they're Macaroons, and nothing wrong with that. Cook from Canada

to the Cook in Boston--this is a recipe from BA and we cannot change the name from "macaroons" to "macarons." That said, I hope you'll find these to be delicious! -Esther Sung Associate Editor, Epicurious.com

Not a review but a website comment: these are macarons, not macaroons, and epicurious should know that!

I have never made these, but have eaten plenty. When I've had them, they've always been a bit chilled.

I did not review, as I did not try yet. I wanted to ask, when one is meant to refrigerate the cookies to achieve the right texture. Before baking, after baking but before the ganache???

My first attempt at macarons, and they were pretty good! I recommend being careful to pipe small discs (no larger than a quarter) and space them well apart. My first tray was ruined because they were too big and too close together.
