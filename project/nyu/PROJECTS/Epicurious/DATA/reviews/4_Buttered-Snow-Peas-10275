Hey, Canada...did you try the recipe or are you just going to amaze us with your wit and use of the English language. Like many recipes on this site, the beauty of the recipe is it simplicity. I am sure if I ate this meal at your house, you'd overcook the snow peas and claim you were a gourmet. It works, try it and then comment.
