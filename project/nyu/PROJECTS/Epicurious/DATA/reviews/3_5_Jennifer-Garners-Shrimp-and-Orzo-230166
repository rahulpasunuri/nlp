I was very disappointed. I expected better based on the reviews. The tomatoes dominated the dish and the shrimp were overpowered. I did not think that the feta cheese worked.

Very good, fast, and easy. I felt that the sauce needed some more flavor, so I added a bit of bacon which probably did wonders for the recipe. It was so low fat already, why not add some bacon? I will definitely make this again.

Actually, I give this recipe 3.5 forks for taste and ease of preparation. It was really good, quick and adaptable. I made it without capers (didn't have any) or feta. Also, because my husband can not eat tomatos, I omitted them as well. I know, you are thinking..."then you didn't make the recipe..." but as I said, it is very adaptable. I followed the basic premise of the recipe :) . I'd definitely make it again.

Delicious, quick & easy! I've made this many times as it quickly became a family favorite; everyone who eats it loves it. Uncooked frozen shelled & devined shrimp work just as fine, as do dried vs. fresh spices.

Delicious! I added some fresh basil with the feta. Very simple to make. Will add it to my summer menus.

Very nice. I am beginning the week of celebration for father's day. I am starting a week of lunch for my husband and I know he'll love it.

Excellent. Kids even loved it. We don't usually like feta cheese but works very well in this dish.

Despite loving Food Network, I am a the worst cook ever! I almost mistakenly put cilantro in for parsley in this recipe. This was seriously the easiest and best tasting recipe ever! My husband loved it and he is the cook of the family.

My sister recommended and now we wait for EZ peel shrimp to be on sale so we can have it! We have actually been known to have it twice in one week!!

I love this recipe. I have probably made this more than a dozen times, and I never tire of it. For a casual dinner it's even company worthy. Easy, fast and deliciou -- what's not to like.

Awesome recipe! Easy to make. If you run out of Feta, try reduced fat bleu cheese. We make this once a month.

This is one of my favorite meals to make, and I make it quite often. Quick and easy, I highly recommend it.

I made this for myself & my husband last night. The recipe was super quick and I had so many of the ingredients in the pantry - which was nice. I used frozen shrimp and added some lemon grilled chicken for my finicky husband. Very tasty.

Very good simple recipe to throw together. The orzo gives it just the right texture. Adding the feta gave it a different twist. Would make again.

Very yummy... a perfect mix of flavors, and easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand. A keeper, for sure!

I love this dish! I would definitely make it again! The capers really make this dish a lively one, as does the white wine! I can't make it all the time due to the shrimp being costly, but it is a special occasion dish!

Pretty tasty, especially for how simple it was and how many of the ingredients I already had in the house. I'd definitely make this again.

Jennifer Garner is hot, her dish is not. Liked it, but did not love it. Watch the amount of red pepper you infuse this plate with.

An absolutely wonderful dish! I made it last night and it made 4 good-sized servings and was filling. I had the leftovers for lunch today and it was just as good, if not better the next day! I'm also excited to try making it w/tofu next time.

This was the best italian shrimp dinner I've ever had! My boyfriend (who hates shrimp) loved it, too : )

I absolutely loved this meal. It had a lot of flavor and was so quick and easy!

The sauce might be better if it had more time let the flavors blend, especially with some of the stronger items like capers. Would almost want to make the sauce the day before and add the shrimp just before serving. It was just a bit overwhelming otherwise. Fresh basil might make it better too.

This was delicious. My husband and son both asked that I make this one again. I followed the recipe except I had no orzo so I substituted bow tie pasta and switched the feta for parmesan. Nicely done Jennifer!
