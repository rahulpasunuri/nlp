This was delicious! I made it twice: the first time, as written, and we loved it. The second time, I made it for a big buffet; so, I substituted spring greens for the arugula and parmesan shavings for the ricotta salata. I was very happy that I splurged and bought the Champagne vinegar. It made a beautiful dressing!

Delicious! I used manchego cheese and it was wonderful in the salad. I also used half spring mix and half arugula but I will use only arugula, like the recipe states, when I make it next time.

One of the best salads I have every had. The dressing has clean bright flavors. I subbed white wine vinegar for the Champagne because that was what I had. I also had trouble getting good pancetta, so I subbed procuitto. This is definitely a keeper!

I think you could halve the amount of honey in the dressing but it still turned out well.

I used prosciutto instead of pancetta and this turned out lovely. I also used shaved grana padano parmesan instead of ricotta salata.

This is a top notch salad. Since discovering this a few years ago here, I have made it every year to kick-off Thanksgiving and other special occasions.. I plate everything individually for presentation and it is terrific. Highly recommend as is.

This salad was the first time my 1.5 yr old requested for more salad! Added raisins, sunflower seeds & kale.

Made this for a potluck and it was a huge hit. Only thing I did was I used procuitto instead of pancetta. Whole Foods had procuitto salad toppers and it was reasonably priced so I didn't have to fry anything. And they were delicious! Added a nice crunch to the salad. I did mix a little bit of field greens with the arugula to stretch it a bit but probably 75% arugula and 25% field greens. Will definitely make this again!

Super easy and delicious. I didn't have pancetta on hand, so I just used bacon. I also mixed the arugula with a spring mix. Great salad.

This salad has become my Sunday staple, and it helped me win the family Top Chef competition this weekend. I have often made it exactly as-is, but I've also substituted based on what I have on hand. I have yet to find a fruit that doesn't taste good in it. Strawberries have been an especially big hit. The ricotta salata cheese is delicious, but so is manchego or even crumbled blue cheese.

i substituted Pomegranite Vin for the Champagne Vin. and threw some toasted Macadamia Nuts on top! Stellar! Just made a whole bottle of the dressing to be ready for next time.

this salad is sooo good. the crunchy saltiness of the bacon, with the subtly sweet asian pear and the slight bitterness of the arugula is just outstanding. it's been a hit everytime i've made it for guests. i followed someone else's suggestion and went for 1/2 baby spinach and 1/2 arugula. definitely looks best w/ salad plated first, then fanning pear slices and sprinkling bacon over the top,

I just try the vinaigrette, it was very mild and good. I will do it again.

A little too sweet? My Whole Foods was out of regular arugula and only had a weird micro-arugula (slightly more than sprouts). I bought it since I wanted to try out this recipe for dinner guests but it wasn't very peppery. I'll have to try this again sometime with regular arugula. This was a little too sweet for my taste but the peppery flavor of regular arugula may cut through it all. So, don't do it with micro greens.

I served this salad on New Years. Everyone loved it. I had to get the ricotta at Whole Foods. I also grilled the pears to enhance their ripness. Really good.

Because I was cooking for kosher people I used turkey bacon instead of pancetta. It was still fabulous. The dressing is light, very simple to make and just brings out all the flavors. I will definitely make this again and again and again!

Nice salad. Dressing is light tasting and could be used for many salads. Pancetta was good, I but might be tempted to try sweet and spicy pecans as an alternative. Used Japanese pear (good) and happened upon ricotta salata at Whole Foods and glad I did (loved it!). Would make this again.

The vinaigrette is SO good! I used a mixed of baby greens and prosciutto. I can see how the pancetta would be amazing.

I'm not rating the recipe, as I had to substitute parmesan for the ricotta salata. However, the altered salad was good (not great). The dressing was nice, but I will reduce the amount of pancetta in the future. Also, I wouldn't bother buying expensive pancetta when regular bacon will do in this application.

Soooo good. The salad itself is a delicious blend of flavors and textures and the dressing is subtle but very good and a nice, interesting change from the typical vinegarette.

Great dish! The salad dressing is light and crisp, which is a nice contrast to the salty pancetta. Half baby spinach and half arugula helped balance everything out.

A keeper! Used Asiago cheese instead of ricotta salata, a very good substitute and easier to find.

Rating: 1
Not sure if my ingredients were subpar (they shouldn't be - we have a good grocery store), but I was not wild about this salad. I'm not all that adventurous when it comes to cooking and even I thought it was pretty boring. Maybe the dressing needed a bit more salt? I like all of the ingredients on their own, but did not think they were too exciting together.

Rating: 3
Made this for Christmas Eve--assembled the dressing ahead of time, cooked the pancetta and "peeled" the cheese ahead of time. The ricotta salata has a definite mild taste, and I don't think I would substitute (it was hard to find, though--check an Italian deli). The champagne vinegar can be purchased at Trader Joe's much cheaper than at the local supermarket. The salad went very well with the ravioli main course.

A wonderful salad I have made numerous times. If the pears are not ripe, trying roasting them, then chilling.

Rating: 4
A wonderful salad with an incredible array of contrasting flavors and textures. The ricotta salata has no real substitute, and the crumbling texture of the pancetta is beautiful with the creamy pears. If a quick call to your local markets is not fruitful, go to igourmet.com and order online.

Rating: 4
Great balance of sweet, tangy, salty, crunchy and bitter- just to name a few. Served as a help-yourself family style, and noticed the pears lose their crispness and taste and soak up the vinaigrette after a a pretty short while. Also make sure not to over cook the pancetta- the bitter aftertaste can take an excellent dish and make it clash- the arugula is enough bitterness already, [plus who likes burnt bacon anyway).

Wow. This was simple and delicious. Fantastic combination of flavors. Granted, I substituted proscuitto (did not fry it) for the pancetta and another hard aged cheese for the ricotta salata, but it was still great. I will make this over and over.

Tasty and light - I didn't expect to find the pancetta or ricotta salata but came upon both at a specialty store. The pancetta looked too fatty to be good so I opted to make crisp bacon. Bought the ricotta and tried it the night before making the salad - I thought it tasted awful. I decided to fry up slices of goat cheese dredged in plain bread crumbs. The dressing is very good.

Rating: 4
Great salad that never fails to impress. Have served it at a couple of dinner parties now and my guests have raved over it. Definitely worth searching around for champagne vinegar and ricotta salata. My only change was to use a chunk of pancetta cut into lardons instead of the slices.

I have made this salad many times and it never fails to please. Although I live in a large metro area, I have had difficulty from time to time finding the ricotta salata. I have substituted block feta, shaved with vegetable peeler, with good results. Terrific blend of flavors.

Rating: 4
I made this salad using crispy bacon rather than pancetta, and with fresh goat's cheese rather than ricotta. I also added diced avocado...absolutely delicious! The avocado and fresh cheese gave it a wonderful creaminess that balanced beautifully with the tangy vinaigrette, salty bacon and sweet pears. I will be making this again and again.

Fabulous! Tripled the recipe for a dinner party full of foodies and everyone loved it. I layered the ingredients on a big platter, with dressed arugula first, then ricotta, Asian pears and pancetta sprinked with dressing, and added some toasted pine nuts. Lovely light course. Wouldn't change a thing.

This is one of my all time favorite salads! The only change I make is exchanging bacon for pancetta (love pancetta but it can be difficult to find). The dressing is delightful and meshes perfectly with the salad ingredients. It's wonderful!

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone asked for seconds -- on salad, at Thanksgiving - so you know it was good. I couldn't find ricotta salata, but instead of substituting feta I substituted shaved gruyere. Not as strong a flavor but still worked. The dressing is a great tasting light vinaigrette and a good dressing for salad with fruit and I've used it on mixed green and other salads to good effect.

This salad was good but not great. I went to great lengths to get the specified ingredients, but even after making it exactly as written, I think excellent results could be achieved by using bacon and feta. Also, I would add some toasted nuts (perhaps hazelnuts or pecans) for an added crunch. I agree with other reviewers that serving it as a "composed" salad with the dressing drizzled over (I did toss the Arugula with dressing first) makes for a more attractive presentation.

Amazing salad. I planned it for Thanksgiving, but didn't get to it. I made it with and served it with turkey soup. I followed other advice and only lightly tossed dressing with the arugula. My kids loved it.

Really nice, light salad. Used a mixture of arugula, belgian endive and heirloom lettuce leaves. I had some pear infused vinegar so I used that instead of the champagne vinegar. And I left out the pancetta since I wanted to keep the salad light.

Delicious flavors...instead of mixing everything together with the dressing, I arranged the components on top of the greens and drizzled the dressing on top, on individual plates. It was a nice presentation, and I could make sure that each person got all the components. The dressing is yummy--can definitely be used on any salad.

Whenever I walk past fragrantly ripe pears I think of this recipe! The salad is a wonderful balance of the pear's sweetness, the pancetta's smokiness, the arugula's peppery flavor brightened with the wonderful vinaigrette. I have never served it that people didn't ask for the recipe -

Rating: 4
Since first discovering this in Gourmet several years ago this has become one of those core salads in my collection of recipes. It is especially good when you can walk by the bin of pears at the grocery and they are so ripe you can smell them! It makes for a salad that is at the same time slightly sweet, smoking salty from the panchetta and peppery from the arugula. I would highly recommend this salad.

wow-easy, and so good! made this last night as a test run for Thanksgiving- my husband, who is not normally a big arugula fan, loved this, and commented how perfectly dressed it was. The salad dressing is really perfect with the ingredients. yum!

I must admit that I always chuckle when I read reviews that go something like this: "I didn't have chicken breasts so I used a pork chop and I didn't have any turnips so I used a radish but this dish was DELICIOUS!" But here I go nonetheless: used regular bacon instead of pancetta and feta instead of ricotta salata (because Trader Joe's doesn't carry it), and white wine vinegar since I didn't have champagne vinegar. Happily I had both arugula and pears. This recipe did turn out beautifully and was a nice change from a standard mixed green salad! Also, it was super easy for a weeknight dinner.

Fantastic salad. The dressing is so light and the combination of the arugula and the pancetta with the sweetness of the honey and pear is unbelievable. I had this salad with steak with Stilton cheese and the Yukon Gold Potatoes with Gorgonzola and Pancetta recipe from the October 2006 Cooking Light Magazine. I also paired it with the Bon Appetite December 1997 Peas with Pancetta (another good one is the Bon Appetite June 2006 Orzo with Peas, Dill, and Pancetta).

I too am opposed to the slaughter of baby arugulas. On the other hand, if you happen upon a wild pancetta roaming the countryside, it does make a great addition to this salad.
