Loved that this recipe called for steaming the acorn squash (healthier than roasting). In actuality, the acorn squash steamed for closer to 25 minutes before it was ready to eat so allot a little extra time for that but overall a very easy recipe. Decent, a little less to be desired in taste, though we did like the lime vinaigrette and will use that concept for something else (white beans, corn, and veggies perhaps?). Felt like this recipe was missing something to make it "richer" and will go for a different sauce the next time around. But we had all of these ingredients laying around so it was worth a shot! a side note: Remember to keep the seeds for roasting - mix with 1/4 tbsp evoo and a pinch of salt and lay on a parchment paper/foil lined baking sheet at 275 degrees and yummm!

This recipe was very bland. If I were to make it again I would definetly have to spice it up with plenty of seasoning. It didn't tickle my palatte.

Not really sure on this one. Interesting, but an odd mixture of flavors. My boyfriend was scared to eat acorn squash, but ended up loving it, so I guess that's a good sign. I thought it was just ok.

This was quick and easy to prepare. However, it wasn't anything special or complicated enough to really merit it being a recipe.

I made this recipe twice!The second time I made it with spanish stuffed peppers, yum!!The lime juice really complements the squash.

This tasted so good. The lime and the squash together, mmmmm. getting it off the skin after it was cooked was awkward.
