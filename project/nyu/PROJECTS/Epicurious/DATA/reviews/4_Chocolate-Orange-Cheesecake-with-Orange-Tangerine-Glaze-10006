I make cheesecakes often and wanted to do something a little bit different for a family dinner around the holidays. ALL felt it was the best cheescake I have made, and that they have ever had. Had trouble finding the tangerine marmalade, so the orange was just fine. If you are not an orange marmalade fan, this one may not become your favorite.

Very good cheesecake. I also had a leak in my water bath, but I served the cake anyway. The crust was moist, as a result, but not bad at all. The cheesecake itself was perfect in texture, creamy with not one single crack. The orange flavor shines through cleanly, without overpowering the dessert. Nice pairing with the chocolate crust.

Great receipe! When my pastry chef friend and I made it, it turned out PERFECT but it came out a little runny when I made it by myself. Any advice?

Terrific make ahead dessert. It was easy to make and everyone loved it. Couldn't find chocolate wafers, so I asked my husband to remove the cream centers of Oreo cookies, He enjoyed that job. Like many others, I used orange marmalade and added shaved semi-sweet chocolate on top. My friends liked that the dessert wasn't too sweet, I did have a lot of the filling left over, so I asked my husband to do more of the Oreo cookie crust and I made several individual cakes. I was surprised at how easy that was to do and how cute they were. I didn't have any ramekins at the cabin, so I improvised and used individual soup crock pots in place of the springform pan; and after cooking and cooling for the recommended time, the small cakes popped right out. Will be making this dessert again!

I have been making this cheesecake every Christmas since 1996. A tradition my family now looks forward to each holiday season. Delicious and well worth the work!

Excellent cheesecake - light and rich with nice height to the cake. I've made 3 other cheesecakes from this site and I think this is by far the best. I covered it with a raspberry sauce instead. Next time I think I'd experiment and add more orange zest/juice, it was a very light orange flavor. First time using a water bath - so easy and no cracks, no leaks, from now on I'll always use one!

Fantastic cheesecake. Light and rich with just the right amount of orange flavoring. I made it once with the orange - tangerine glaze and it was good. The next time I served it with a raspberry sauce and it was to die for. Can't wait to make it again.

A bittersweet chocolate sauce makes all the difference. I found the marmalade to be a nice contrast but a bit bitter. Would use the very least to cover the cheesecake next time. Cooking method is perfect, creamy, no cracks.

Recipie was easy to follow and delicious. for a nicer presentation you may add chocolate shavings on the top of the cake and perhaps a few garishes of green for color balance.

I couldn't find the tangerine marmalade so use just orange and tangerine zest. This was a little labor intensive but weel worth the time it was a smashing hit will surely do it again

Easier to make than most cheesecakes and with the glaze, results in a very attractive presentation. I made it for a girls' dinner party and everyone loved it. Next time, I'd garnish with dark chocolate curls for more of a chocolate taste. For the glaze, I used Safeway brand Seville Orange Marmalade and it was perfect.

I made this as a donation to a church organized dinner that my mother was helping with. It was very good and turned out very beautiful. The orange and chocolate flavors were perfect, like the "Double Chocolate Cheesecake", people thought it was from a professional bakery. I would definitely make it again were it not for that fact that my family went head over heels for the aforementioned Double Chocolate Cheesecake.

delicious and simple; i made it once for my famnily, and i am going to make once more for the class of '03 commencement dinner next week...i couldn't get chocolate wafers, so i used butter and chocolate gram crackers for the crust, and added dark chocolate leaves on top.

Wonderful cheesecake! I will definitely make this cheesecake again as it was delicious, easy to prepare, and elegant. I had no cracks, the crust didn't stick and the glaze gave it a professional touch. Yum.

Another excellent cheesecake! What a nice, bright, orange flavor! I can't imagine what the orange-tangerine marmalade would do for more for this recipe tha a good quality orange marmalade, so I didn't knock myself out trying to find one. Based on the comments, I added a dark chocolate ganache in a checkerboard pattern, alternating every other square with marmalade and the chocolate. The cake could have easily stood on it's own without the chocolate. Anyway, I made two of them for back to back parties, and barely got a piece for myself! This one definately adds to my collection!

I made this cake for Easter. I liked the sound of the chocolate in the recipe, but was disappointed to see the only chocolate was the crust. So I made a chocolate ganache to go on top. It turned out perfectly, and my family loved it, even my picky son who claims to hate cheesecake.

Like all cheese cakes, it is very rich. But the orange flavor was a refreshing contrast to the richness. The flavor gets better with age, you could even make this 2 days ahead. I had to use chocolate graham crackers because my store did not have wafer cookies. They were fine. Also had to substitute regular orange marmalade. Be sure not to buy the "sweet" marmalade. This cake is sweet enough. It was very impressive and delicious. I served it with a home-made dark chocolate sauce zig-zagged over a slice. As far as the water bath, I was paranoid because the other cook had a leak! So, I used two sheets of over-sized heavy-duty aluminim foil. That way there was no gap in the foil coverage. The heavy duty foil is less fragile than regular, so there is less chance of a tear and a leak. The water bath works - no cracks. Enjoy!

This was the easiest and smoothest cheesecake I have ever made. The water bath really makes a difference. I did butter and chill the springform pan prior to putting in the batter. I also doubled the orange zest amount because I personally love orange. Amazing recipe. I will make this again.

This cheesecake was a big hit with my parents. My dad is a grand marnier freak and he ate a BIG chunk! I ground up some Keebler double chocolate cookies for the crust. For the topping I added 2 TB. of grand marnier. Delish!

This cheesecake has become my favorite New Year's Eve dessert - have made it about six times. Despite the availability of fine gourmet ingredients here in the Boston area, have never seen orage-tangerine marmalade. So, like one of the other reviewers, I use a fine orange marmalade with a bit of Grand Marnier or Cointreau. Made this on Thanksgiving this year and had the crust crack for the first time, despite the water bath. And water bath seeped into the crust. Dumped it and started over, without water bath. This one cracked, too. Something in the air? This New Year's, will try the Cheesecake with Candied Figs, Orange, and Hazelnut from this site.

Not as yummy as the title suggests. I would have liked more chocolate. But still good.

I made this recipe for a party, and guests were very impressed...kept asking what bakery I bought it from. Instead of glazing it with tangerine-orange marmelade, I heated some plain orange marmelade with Grand Marnier, flambeed it, and served the cheesecake with a bit of sauce over each slice. I'll make it again for sure!

I've made this twice, and both times guests were ready to kiss my ring. This is absolutely outstanding. I added some bittersweet chocolate shavings to the top after glazing. The finished product looked like it had come from a professional bakery. Couldn't find orange-tangerine marmalade, so used some Scotch Whiskey and orange marmalade I'd received as a gift, which was just FINE.

Made it for a party. People loved it. Everyone asked me for the recipe.

Although the title is tempting, this cheescake is just so, so. Since there isn't any chocolate in this recipe (eventhough the title says otherwise) I spruced it up a bit by substituting the orange marmalade glaze with a rich, bittersweet chocolate glaze. Much, much better this way!
