This was a real winner. Very creamy and a nice pop to the taste with the Dijon! It's in my arsenal of dressings for sure!

I like this vinagrette very much, my version uses aceto balsamico instead of vinegar, only extra vigin olive oil and the secret ingredient: a bit to taste of Pedro Ximenz Sherry!
