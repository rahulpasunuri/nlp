This recipe was absolutely Amazing!!!! We added 1/2 lb of ham, 3 cloves chopped garlic, and 2 stalks celery with the potatoes. I didn't have a scale so I used 3 10oz cans of baby clams (and their juices) and 2 bottles of Reese clam juice like someone here suggested. With the extra juice I had to thicken it more at the very end. Since we are in New Mexico we had no access to fresh clams so I was so happy to find a recipe using canned. It was almost as good as Mo's back home in Oregon!!!

Followed the recipe pretty closely, with a couple exceptions, and it was delicious. Listen when they say not to cook the clams too long after adding them back in because they did toughen up for us. Changes: 1.) Couldn't find clam juice and used 2 cans of canned clams (in addition to the fresh) instead. Worked fine. 2.) Took the cooked celery and carrots, ran them through the food processor, and cooked them down with the broth. Keeps vitamins but have to get rid of excess water. 3.) Since removed thyme, carrots and celery manually, didn't use sieve. If you do this, make sure to wash the clams very thoroughly.

We made this yesterday after digging our own clams on Block Island. I added more clams, eliminated clam juice and used a combination of cream and half & 1half Wonderful!

I was Duck Hunting on Long Island and I got out of the water fresh clams. Brought them just to steaming not boiling. I also added a half can of creamed corn which gave it just a hit of sweetness. The best!!

Delicious! My seventeen year old thought it was the best. I added 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 1/2 cup of light cream, way too many calories for me with all cream. also, used 1/3 lb. of bacon instead of 1/2 lb.

Great recipe. I added more clams (I like to have them in every bite) and a little more water and cream (I don't want my spoon to be able to stand up in the bowl but I do want that hearty texture). Next time though, I'm going to cook the half the potatoes seperately so that they can cook all the way through and just melt into the chowder. Everyone loved it!

Great recipe! I made it with leftover clams, saved some of the shells and just boiled the shells for the "liquour". Eliminated the carrots and forgot to add the extra water. It was fantastic, fed 6 adults for first course.

Love this recipe. Friends ask for it again and again. Fresh thyme really makes it special. Like most chowders, this is even better the next day.

Growing up in Boston, my family wouldn't hear of gussying up their chowder with anything but oyster crackers. Carrots always figured into our chowder, too. If you don't like them, by all means, don't use them. However, much of the fun of cooking is in making your own choices about what tastes good to you, not dictating terms and rules for the masses.

NEVER put carrots in anything but beef stew or vegetable or pea soup. I'm surprised that no recipes state white onions. Yellow/brown onions are slightly bitter when cooked. White are slightly sweet. Crackers? Good lord, why spoil a good meal with CRACKERS? If you want bread, at least have a good sourdough.

A true Cape Cod classic- just like my grandmother used to make! Adding the veggies while steaming the clams made the stock even richer. I even used lower fat milk- still delicious!!

This is the classic recipe, and the best. Traditionalists insist that clam chowder should be made ahead of time and allowed to sit off the heat, but not refrigerated, for several hours to allow the flavours to blend. Reheat the chowder gently. It should not be allowed to boil. The oyster crackers are a great suggestion to replace the traditional soda crakers. Love it.

Excellent clam chowder! I used canned steamers instead of buying fresh clams. It was just as good!
