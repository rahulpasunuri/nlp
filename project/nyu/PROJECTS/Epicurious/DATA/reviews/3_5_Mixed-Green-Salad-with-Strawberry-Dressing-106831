A salad hardly needs a recipe but for the dressing, and this dressing was FANTASTIC! I mean, really really good! Everyone loved it at our dinner party. As for the other ingredients, I subbed crumbled blue cheese and candied sliced almonds. Everything tasted just perfect together.

I did some variation on this. Mixed greens, sliced fresh strawberries, blue cheese crumbles and pecans-dressing used strawberry balsamic and basil olive oil(less than recipe called for),pinch of salt and about 1/4 tsp dijon mustard. Excellent.

Rating: 3
Fresh and delicious. I followed user suggestions and used half the oil. Also, I happened to have jicama around and added some of that, cubed. I'm not a big walnut fan, so I used almonds instead. This was unexpectedly good. A keeper.

I was looking for a non-dessert dish to make with leftover strawberries and was happy to come upon this one. I followed the advice of all those who recommended cutting the oil way down (I used about 1/6 cup) and of the reviewer who recommended making the dressing in a mini-prep (fast and easy). I should have followed the many suggestions to add onion or something else with a bit more bitewe found the salad to be somewhat unbalanced. And I think our strawberries might have been sweet enough without the added sugar. Still, I'm happy to have tried itI really liked the dressing and will look forward to tinkering with the overall recipe.

I made this for a contribution to a pot luck and everyone wanted to know "Who made the salad?" (in a good way!) I used 1/3 c of olive oil and added more greens so I did not have too much dressing.

This is a simple, elegant recipe that everyone raves about. It promises to impress! Make it and you won't be disappointed. *I use the candied nuts you find at the grocery store in this salad. They're easy and add a sweet zing to the salad.

I did not like this salad very much, although everyone seemed to enjoy it at the picnic we served it at today. The dressing smelled like...garbage. I have a very strong sense of smell (I can smell milk going bad 2 days before anyone else in my family), so maybe no one else would notice or mind the smell. The taste was all right, but not memorable. Granted, I did use supermarket feta (actually, Trader Joe's -- not even as good as supermarket feta in my book). Maybe it would have been better with the French feta I usually buy. But there are other, similar salads out there, and I'll make one of them next time.

Rating: 4
This recipe has a great combination of flavors, and can be good year-round if you can find good strawberries. Like others, I was suspicious that there was too much dressing and cheese in the recipe, so I used about 1/2 c. of the dressing and about half the cheese, and the proportions seemed to work out well! I like to toss my salads in paper bags before serving, and this was also an effective way to mix everything together.

Rating: 3
I had made similar salads before, but the mashed strawberries in the dressing really add something! As with some other reviewers, I substituted gorgonzola for feta--we just like it better--and the result was excellent. Will make this often in "strawberry season".

This is my favorite summer salad. I usually doctor up every recipe I use but this one is perfect the way it is. If it is too much dressing, just add more greens!

Made this for Easter dinner and got rave reviews. I blended all of the dressing ingredients together along with a small amount of red onion. Also, per other comments, reduced oil to 1/3 cup - still had plenty of dressing leftover. Great, easy to make salad.

Rating: 3
I found the dressing to be a little heavy for the delicate baby greens, but overall it had great taste and was very well received by my guests. I sliced the strawberries ahead of time and mixed them with a little of the dressing, to keep them from getting dried out, which was a great idea, and I didn't mix the feta in with the greens, but sprinkled over top along with walnuts that I'd toasted with a little butter and balsamic vinegar. yum. I'll definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
Great recipe and very easy. Only problem is that the proportions do seem off. I had 5x the amount of dressing needed and way too much cheese. Otherwise A+

Yum! I made this with baby arugula and skipped the cheese (we were having a kosher meat meal) and it was great. Very simple and summery.

Not being a fan of feta, I substituted gorgonzola cheese and it was delicious.

First of all, I didn't have feta for this salad, so I did not include it. I imagine it would be much better with the feta, but without it, the salad was just a tad on the boring side for me. My guests really enjoyed it though, and didn't leave any salad in the bowl. I did enjoy the strawberry/balsamic combination which I have used many other times. I would make this again, but only if I had feta or something else with a lot of flavor to add. Also, I did not use all the dressing, as it would have been way too much.

Rating: 3
This was a tasty salad! I served it with cotija cheese and roasted pepitas instead of feta and walnuts. The saltiness of those ingredients contrasted very nicely with the sweetness of the strawberries and balsamic. It's definitely a combination I recommend! I would also suggest making the dressing in the food processor so that the strawberies have a smoother texture.

Rating: 4
I have been making this since it first appeared in the magazine and everyone always loves it! To repeat what many other reviewers have said: Use half the oil in the dressing and extra sliced berries in the salad. Add a little red onion to the salad or minced into the dressing. I prefer pecans or pine nuts to walnuts. Love the feta but its still good without it. Arugula and baby spinach added to the greens are a great addition....great recipe. Endlessly adaptable. Looks beautiful on a buffet table. What more can you ask for! ( use top quality feta-anything else is nasty and ruins the whole recipe!!!)

Rating: 4
A yummy and beautiful looking summer salad. I agree with other reviewers that the oil can be reduced. I added some diced scallion to cut the sweetness and the richness and subbed spiced pecans for the walnuts. Very enjoyable.

Rating: 3
I am making this for Easter because of the wonderful strawberries. I added red onion and cucumber, all sliced in a food processor, and sliced the strawberries instead of halving. I pureed the strawberries for the dressing and added a bit more than called for and it is great! Just put all the ingredients for the dressing in a glass jar and shake to blend. Too easy!

Rating: 3
I made this for a family dinner, substituting raspberries because I had a hard time finding strawberries. I used a little less oil in the dressing and threw some red onion slices on the salad. It was very good. My sister-in-law, who has the most discriminating palate in the family, especially liked it and requested the dressing recipe. I would try the previous suggestion to add a little onion to the dressing next time. I was pleased with it overall though.

Rating: 3
Very nice change of pace. My son who likes strawberries loved this salad. He's 6, but my daughter aged 8, was not that fond of it. However, I liked it enough that I will make it for company tomorrow. I used pecans instead of walnits and I put some sliced onions in the salad.

Rating: 3
I made this for a family gathering. And it was delicious! I double the recipe for 12 adults and there was very little left over. I used finely chopped walnuts and toasted them with a little brown sugar. I also took the advice of others and used a little less oil. It turned out excellent and I had rave reviews. I will be making this one often!

Rating: 3
The dressing is my new favorite - trying mashing and wisking by hand or blend in a blender - 2 different textures and both delicious! Love the feta, try adding fresh peaches, baby arugula - love the peppery taste with the strawberry dressing. I added kosher salt and more pepper (for the cook that thought the dressing was lacking something). Red onion kicks it up a notch as well. Dressing works well with most ingredients.

This recipe is even better if you use filberts (hazelnuts, for those on the east coast) rather than walnuts. Pine nuts are also better than walnuts.

This is a beautiful salad. The dressing is delicious. It tastes quite good, although I felt it was lacking something. I haven't figured out what to add that would "pick it up a notch" while complimenting the taste. Maybe a red onion. Even so, I would definitely make it again because it is very appealing.

This is such an easy and delicious recipe -especially when the salad and feta need to be dumped into the salad bowl and all you have to do is cut up the strawberries and bang all the dressing ingrediants into the food processor. Always a big hit and I never have to worry about left overs.

I loved this salad! I put all the dressing ingredients in my mini chopper and let it do all the mashing and blending for me. The only thing I changed was I left out the walnuts because I didn't have any.

This is a very good salad. I modified it a bit by using the frozen Birdseye strawberries in a pouch. After thawing the berries(I didn't mash them) put in a bowl with olive oil, 2 or 3 T of balsamic vinegar and leave out the sugar. The berries are still so cold even after thawing and makes a perfect salad for a hot Summer day.

This is a simple, good salad recipe. The dressing has a delicious, unique flavor that my dinner guests enjoyed and for which they requested the recipe. The only change I made was using toasted pecans instead of the toasted walnuts. Will certainly make this again!

Made the dressing in a mini food processor, used white balsamic vinegar, only one teaspoon of sugar, cut oil to 1/3 cup. Substituted gorgonzola for the feta. Added a few green onions per other reviews. Did I make the same recipe? Pretty much, I guess. My Easter guests loved it with the changes.

I used Goat cheese instead of feta, and also white balsamic instead of brown (so the dressing remained a nice "strawberry" color). I used fresh strawberries from my garden, delicious!

Rating: 3
We've made this several times, always using the food processor for blending the dressing, and love the result. To those who found it oily, the proportions of oil/vinegar are right (roughly 3:1), so try using your blender or processor to help emulsify. As for the weight of strawberries versus greens, common sense rules. Use more or less of each, as you prefer, but remember that mesclun greens are very lightweight, versus the denser strawberries. Any kind of nuts will do, but toasting them really brings out the flavor. Also, has worked out with goat cheese in lieu of feta.

Rating: 4
Wonderful - everyone always goes for seconds of this, we never have any leftovers and company always asks for the recipe! Great with toasted pecans and regular feta (crumbled myself.) Be careful with dressing, add only a little if you like a light dressing, I serve extra on the side for those that like more. Great balance of sweet and savory! YUM!

This was a really pretty and fresh tasting salad. I never would have thought to put feta and strawberries together. The only substitutions I made was to use pine nuts, since I was out of walnuts and a little red onion for zip.

Rating: 1
As written, things that made this a 1: wrong proportion of berries:greens, less than an ounce of greens per serving?? Things that made it worth experimenting with: adding few berries to dressing though with FAR less oil, berry+feta combination. Planned experiments: (1) berries+feta+nuts (no greens) topped with a BIT of dressing and (2) lots of greens dressed and then topped with a few undressed berries+feta+few nuts. Would also skip the nuts any day.

Yum! Made it for Mother's Day. Left out the cheese & the nuts in the salad since I served it with Linguine & Goat Cheese/Leek/Smoked Salmon - would have been too rich. Quartered the strawberries & also added some orange slices. I can't say I didn't alter any of the measurements in the dressing, but isn't that what tasting is for? It came out superfresh, not too oily.

The weight of the solids and heavy dressing turned my company dinner salad into a limp & less than optimal side dish. Although my dressing ingredients were fresh, we all thought the dressing had an odd,oily flavor. Were I to remake it (not) I'd make the strawberries smaller than "halved" & make sure the feta is finely crumbled.

Yum. I always add a bit of green onion into the dressing for some kick. It adds just enough complimentary flavour and doesn't overpower the dressing.

Simply fantastic. My husband loved it and delared it a "keeper". Now having observed this time and again on epi, I must say this: don't rate the recipe if in fact, you didn't make the recipe. While I fully understand the creative changes and substitutions that avid cooks tend toward, I want to read reviews that more or less reflect the recipe presented. Tweakings and feedback are appreciated but c'mon, at least one reviewer made an entierly different salad.

I want to thank you all. If it wasn't for the ratings I would never have made this salad and I'm so glad I did! Since I can't seem to follow a recipe either, I made these changes: Used less oil per recommendations, substituted fresh lemon juice instead of vinegar, added some fresh slices of orange AND I candied the nuts by boiling in pure maple syrup, cooled and then deep fried in olive oil. I never give a 4 rating, but if I did this would be the one!

Yum, yum, yum! This was wonderful! Of course, I altered it a bit... (I can never seem to stick to a recipe!) I tossed the walnuts with butter and brown sugar in a skillet over medium/high heat to give them a caramelized coating. I also added a cup of dried cranberries. Talk about a good salad-- this one was a perfect transition from summer to fall, and I especially loved the dressing.

Yes, yes yes to this dressing! It was wonderful. I often use strawberries in my salad, esp. if I don't like the looks of the tomatoes in the produce section. But I never thought of using them in the dressing . . . the only changes I made were to cut way back on the oil, and I found (prob. because I used less oil) that I needed a tiny bit more sugar. I did make this salad as written, with the feta and almonds, but I will be using this dressing all over the place.

Both my husband and I really enjoyed this salad. The strawberries really helped to lighten the richness of the walnuts and feta. I used my KitchenAid food processor to mash the strawberries, then added the salt, pepper, sugar, vinegar, and slowly added the oil as it was processing. It worked really well, even with much less oil. We will definitely make this over and over again.
