This recipe didn't work for me- I'm not sure what went wrong, the polenta firmed up in the frig but t when I tried to fry it it basically turned into glop. I also agree that the taste is bland.

These fritters were greasy and VERY bland. For the trouble to cook them and all the dirty dishes they caused, they weren't worth it. If you want to make this recipe, use less oil and more cheese.

This is basically fried southern cornbread. The batter is stiff, like dough so don't expect it to pour. It'll hold it's shape when you add the cheese, like a ball of dough. I made it twice. I couldn't find edam at my local market so I used Havarti the first time, and then low-moisture mozzarella the second time. Both times turned out well except I really couldn't taste the Havarti in the first batch. If I make this again, I'll double the Havarti or use a stronger tasting cheese. Both batches turned out golden brown, crunchy and would make a good snack, esp for kids. However, the taste was bland and probably could be jazzed up with more spice or jalapenos or curry or something to ramp up the taste a bit.
