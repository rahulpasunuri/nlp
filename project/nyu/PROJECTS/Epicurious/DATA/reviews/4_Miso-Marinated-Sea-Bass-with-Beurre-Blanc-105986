I made this several years ago, followed the recipe as written and everyone loved it. With all the issues with Sea Bass I made this again with Cod and it turned out great too. I'm about to make it again and just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Big thanks to Whole Foods sustainable fish policy. They have a certified source although expensive at $26/#.

I liked this recipe, but there is another recipe with a miso glaze that I like better - http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/102851. Now, the beurre blanc in this recipe, with the glaze in the recipe link I am including here would be my 'best of both worlds' recipe.

Mirin and sugar make this dish too sweet. This fish IS sweet, so I used dry white wine instead of mirin, and avoided sugar altogether. In addition to that, I added some Meyer Lemons' zest and juice to the glaze, and chopped in red and green jalopeno peppers. Next time I'll add even more lemon (chunks, perhaps)garlic, and curry - to stand up to the sweetnes of fish+glaze. I don't think this dish needs berre blanc or any sauce for that matter.

This recipe has potential, but the miso flavor is way too strong; it overpowers the fish. Scrape off the miso after marinating as is advised in other recipes like the one for salmon on this site. Also, do not marinate for more than two hours, it will start to cook the fish. I served it on top of sushi rice with peas and shiitakes with a side of sesame spinach and a crunchy, lightly dressed Asian slaw. It worked fine, except for the overwhelming miso flavor. I left off the buerre blanc.

This recipe is excelent. Incredible flavor. My wife insists I make this dish again. This can be made with or without the beurre blanc sauce. For those not keen on paying high prices for sea bass, check out your local Trader Joe's. They have EXCELLENT freshly frozen fish. (I know, I know, frozen fish is taboo.) But at Trader Joe's the quality (and price) can't be beat. Just place it in your frig to thaw the day before, and you're ready to go. (Trust me..I don't work for TJ's)

This was a hit at my gourmet club tonight. The flavor of the marinade was delicious, everyone raved. The only disappoiting thing was that for the high price of the fish...$15.99/# ,I would have expected a fillet without bones, but alas ours had bones. I do think this would be just as good without the effort of the beurre blanc, but i am glad i made it.

this is a classic sea bass recipe - the miso maranade is simply sublime. I had a similar thing called 'sea bass sate' in a very upscale joint in manhattan call TAOs ... sate ... you know that thai dish usually with chicken/beef strips on bamboo skews with peanut sauce - only this with seabass strips and the miso sauce. My god - this is the same. Make it at home or shell out 40 bucks a plate at a top notch joint. Of course good sea bass is pricy but at least it is farm raised now and i've stopped my boycott of this wonderful fish. Want to impress a fish lovin spouse - make this ! Only thing don't overcook it.

You can use less miso or less of the mirin to make it a little less sweet.

Made this for our gourmet club; wow! This was really excellent. Very easy, elegant presentation, and impressive. Used red miso instead of white (none at my grocer's) but the presentation was still very pretty. Loved the sauce. You could skip it for a weeknight meal, but it is definitely worth the time and calories for entertaining. This is one of my very favorite fish dishes.

I thought the marinade was excellent. One could alter it but its simplicity was its best asset. As for the Beurre Blanc? I prefer the old classic with white wine and vinegar and no cream. Other than that it was a simple elegant dish that I would use again.

This recipe was fantastic! I used halibut instead of sea bass, omitted the cream and added some chicken broth instead to the sauce. Also simplified marinade to miso and one cup white wine. Delicious and simple! Will make again for company.

The fish is amazing in this marinade! I served over a seaweed salad with mushroom ragout on the side. The cream sauce didn't do anything for me, but my husband liked it. I thought the fish stood alone and didn't need the sauce. Will definitely make the marinade again! Fabulous!

Truly a 4 forker. But then cream has a way of doing that. The sauce is subtle and does not over power the fish.

It sounds great on paper, and I thought it would produce a more intense flavor, but after all the work, it had only a very subtle flavor which was good, but not great. I followed the recipe without any modifications.

Perfect blend of flavors. This tastes like the ones you order in fine Japanese restaurants. I didn't have time to prepare the beurre blanc & I wanted a lighter taste without the cream, so I simply simmered the miso marinade in heated oil and garlic until it was thick yet pourable. I also seasoned the seabass with salt & pepper before marinating. My husband was so impressed. So happy I found this recipe.

This dish is fabulous! Very soon after I've had it, I find myself wanting it again. My husband and 12 year old son are crazy about it too. Its light, yet rich at the same time. Relatively simply to prepare once you gather the ingredients, which wasn't difficult since our local grocery had everything on hand. Seabass is sublime!

A staple in my house. Although it seems like a lot of ingredients it is easy to whip up and leave to marinate. Very simple, my guests are always so impressed. The cream sauce is a little heavy, so I often make it minus the cream sauce.

Awesome! Due to a mistake at the fishmonger, I made this with Chilean Sea Bass, which I had given up eating because it is endangered. Still, this was incredible.

I thought this was great....all of the ingredients can get costly relative to other dishes, so for me it is more for special occasions. I bet this would work with any white fish if sea bass isn't available.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit! I made almond rice with it and everyone talked about it the whole night. Some of the ingredients were hard to find but Bristol Farms had them all... I am making this for a dinner party next week again!

Very Tasty and Moist. The sauce came out a bit watery, maybe I needed to cook it down a bit more. Overall the taste was very stimulating & flavorful. I served it atop a grilled portobella mushroom and a side of mashed yams with carmel-pecan sauce.

Incredible recipe!! IMHO, well worth making the beurre blanc sauce....makes the very good fish into an OUTSTANDING meal. I have also made this with halibut!

I did a test run of this recipe on my six year old and husband using cod instead of sea bass and skipped the beurre blanc. I like to test things out on them before serving a dish for company. All I can say is that my six year old (who is normally a very picky eater) loved this dish. In our trial run, I served it with Jasmine rice and a salad. All I can say is that not only is this a great dish for company, but if you're trying to get your kids to try seafood, this is definitely a recipe to try. Even without the beurre blanc, it was just wonderful and very easy to prepare. It will definitely be a keeper in my recipe file.

I don't do much cooking other than the occassional bar-b-que, but I tried this one on a Saturday for my girlfriend and it went over VERY well. Not only was she impressed, but I impressed myself. This dish is VERY good. I will definately make it again.

INCREDIBLE! I'm not the biggest fan of sea bass, both thought the marinade would be worth a try. It was great (even with sea bass). We served it with some soba noodles tossed with a little sesame oil, lemon and green onions. YUMMY!

Absolutely amazing. A little time consuming, but worth it. I significantly extended the time to cook the sauce (so it would reduce more) WOW!!! Served with small/tiny new potatoes...

I made this dinner for my husband for Valentines and we both LOVED it. Served with sauteed spinach and mashed potatoes. Would definitely do this again. I got all ingredients at one store...Central Market in Austin. If your grocer doesn't have a large selection of asian foods, go to an asian grocer for the mirin, miso and sake.

Beyond belief good...don't know what happened in CO (see below). I have made this several times with raves every time.

Guests enjoyed, I was truly disappointed. Spent the day on a hunt for ingredients and the dish was merely so-so. The sauce cools fast, so my plate was cold before I ever sat down. I absolutely love sea bass, but this dish does not complement the fish in my opinion.

A month after our wedding, I preparded a dinner for my wife and the couple that introduced us. Having bought a fresh 1.75 lb. Chilean Sea Bass filet, I chose this recipe. Had to find an Asian supermarket to procure the mirin, white miso and the sake, but had fun doing so! All in all, best dish ever especially if you adore non-fishy fish! Flakey, falls apart, and the beurre blanc sauce is perfect. The marinade provides a wonderful taste that blends well with the beurre blanc...overall a great recipe and a joy to prepare!
