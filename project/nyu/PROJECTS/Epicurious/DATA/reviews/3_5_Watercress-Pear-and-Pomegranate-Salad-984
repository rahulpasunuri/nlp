Well suited for Christmas Dinner! The red of the pomegranate and the green of the watercress and greens is seasonal. This has become part of our family's holiday tradition.

I've made this two years in a row for thanksgiving. it's visually stunning amidst all the casseroles....The dressing is the best part, it's yummy. I liked it better with roquefort personally, after making it both ways, and I added Trader Joe's candied walnuts the second time. The walnut oil was a splurge for me, but it adds so much and is also good to use in homemade granola

I made this recipe last christmas and it was extremely boring. I used Ricotta salata, which, when combined with the other ingredients, ended up producing a very one dimensional composition of flavors. Using feta would be the way to go, if you are going to make this.

I also made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. Definitely use feta cheese. Carmelized spiced walnuts would have been a great addition. I didn't use honey, but the tartness was a nice contrast to our au-gratin potatoes and prime rib.

I made this for Christmas dinner and was disappointed. It was visually appealing but the taste was lackluster. I used honey in the dressing because, as other reviews noted, it needed some sweetness. I also used goat cheese instead of feta and wondered if the feta would have punched up the taste a little more.

Big hit at my thanksgiving dinner. Will definitely make again. Used macadamia nut oil as my sister is alergic to walnuts. Also used mache lettuce instead of watercress which I loved!

2 foodie friends at a recent dinner raved about this. Didn't have butter lettuce, subbed arugula instead. Subbed rice vinegar for white wine vinegar for same reason.

This was EXCELLENT. Sub'd goat cheese for feta and didn't have walnut oil so used grapeseed. Was really good and very pretty.

Beautiful presentation with the many colors and lovely combo of textures too. The pears definetely make this dish. I sub'd goat cheese over the feta/ricotta to appease guests and was delicious too.

Very festive and impressive looking salad. I thought the dressing was a bit strong, so I will try 2T. vinegar with addition of sugar or honey. The greens, pear, feta and pomegranate make a great combination of flavors. I'll definitely make again with noted changes and with walnuts as other cooks suggested.

Great salad! Unexpected and colorful. If using best quality white wine vinegar, 2T is enough; that will enhance the flavor of pomegranate juice. Definitely use Feta cheese. Enjoy!

It's a keeper. Used baby spinach and a GOOD QUALITY feta (there is a lot of lousy feta out there). A touch of honey made the dressing perfect. I also added some carmelized spicy walnuts that I had in the freezer as a garnish. This salad is beautiful and delicious-enough said.

such a great salad! i just used spinach leaves, and didn't have any walnut oil on hand, so omitted that and sprinkled walnuts in the salad instead. i was looking for pomegranate recipes, and this is a delightful treat.

I made this salad twice in the last week, once with ricotta salata and then with a David Woods goat feta from Vancouver Island. The feta wins. The ricotta salata is too bland for my taste. The first time I was out of white wine vinegar and used red. It seemed to make no difference even in the color of the dressing.

I made this for my son's all-school picnic and it was a huge hit! I heard the teachers raving about it on the playground for days afterwards.

This was a nice combination, even though I substituted baby spinach for the watercress. The pomegranate juice and the seeds were a nice contrast to the pears and feta.

I actually tasted this recipe recently at a Christmas buffet, and was so impressed I went looking for the recipe. I think the chef who prepared it may have cooked the pears slightly, and the dressing he served with it was a cranberry vinagrette. In any case, the taste combination was superb, and I'm all set to try it out at home!
