The turkey was really good, but the sauce didn't have much kick to it. I question the direction to strain the chiles.

We weren't wild about this recipe. The turkey turned out fine, but the sauce was strange. We're fairly adventurous eaters, but the combination of the chili broth with the mint and tomato just didn't connect. It tasted like a bland yet minty tomato broth.

Absolutely amazing! The flavors are rich and complex. My guests agreed that this was the best turkey they've ever eaten. My husband typically doesn't like Mexican food - but he loved this. I will definitely make again. The turkey breast was perfectly done by cooking to 160F as recommended. I saved the leftover sauce to use with grilled chicken breasts later this week. One caution: don't wait until the last minute to look for achiote paste. You will probably have to visit a specialty store to find it.

Is this a bone in turkey breast?

The sauce for this recipe is fantastic! The addition of masa along with the mint gives the sauce a complex and authentic flavor.
