I did not make this recipe either, but in response to the previous comment from SLC... The Iguanas do make a fine mole, but for the best you need to go to Conejito's Restaurant in Milwaukee, WI. Then you will know what fantastic mole is.

Love this recipe, I made it with frozen chicken tenders and cooked it up to go in tortillas. Soooo easy and delicious.

I did not make this recipe, but read the reviews and want to make a correction. For the best mole, go to either the RED or BLUE IGUANA in SLC. There is no purple. You will not be dissapointed. Each carry 7 different moles, ALL primo.

Excellent alternative to the usual Mexican fare, this tradtional fest dish goes well on any table, addtion of pablano peppers add a unique touch. for an alternative try green mole with pork. For the person who got sick go to the Purple Iguana Mexican Resturant in SLC and let them serve you some of their mole, you will be cured.

This was tasty and easy...mole can be used for various meats. The other reviewer who got sick, may not have used the necessary precaution when cooking with meats...this is a VERY tasty recipe.

I used turkey breast and it turned out just fine. A new and interesting way to use boneless turkey breast. I do admit I used canned Mole sauce. Who cares?

I made this recipe and it was very good. It is a basic Mole sauce. I used chicken breasts. My guess is that the other reviewer got ahold of some contaminated poultry. I doubt it had anything to do with the recipe, unless he/she was allergic to some of the ingredients. I will make it again.

Spent half the night puking and the other half crapping napalm. Fix this at your own risk.
