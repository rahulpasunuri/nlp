LOVE LOVE LOVE this Lemon Lemon Lemon Loaf! it prompted me to write my first ever review :) made the recipe exactly as written except used Meyer lemons rather than regular. drizzled the butter slowly - took a while - and it worked out fine. had a slight spill in the Cuisinart after combining the sour cream and vanilla but not too bad.

What a mess! I can't believe whoever wrote this delicious recipe said to put all the liquids in a food processor. I had liquid running out the bottom all over my table. Perhaps what was meant was a blender? Also, next time I will fold the liquid into the dry, rather than the opposite way. Otherwise, this got rave reviews and plate licking to all who tried it!

I have made this cake several times all to rave reviews. The whole trick to this recipe is to DRIZZLE the butter into the food processor SLOWLY, much like drizzling oil when making mayonnaise. If you do not drizzle slowly the butter will not emulsify properly with the other ingredients and you will end up with the greasy mess that some reviewers described. Technique is everything with this recipe. If you follow the directions exactly the cake will be wonderful!

I LOVED this loaf!!!!! I did the recipe as written, (did 1/2 of the recipe since I didn't need two loaves) however I didn't have cake flour. For 3/4 cups of cake flour, I used 3/4 cups MINUS 1 1/2 Tablespoons of AP flour and added 1 1/2 Tablespoons of corn starch. I also skipped the lemon syrup section since I didn't want a cake too sweet and lemony. There were going to be kids at the house, and I didn't want to totally alienate them with a large lemony flavor. I found that with the lemon/confectioner's sugar glaze, it was plenty sweet and lemony. I can't wait to make this again!

This was really disappointing! I've loved everything from my Baked: New Frontiers in Baking book...but this didn't turn out at all. I ended up with a spongy, chewy, flat cake, it didn't set up like bread, seemed to be way too much egg/butter with too little of the two types of flours? Doubt I'll try making it again since it was so far off from anything good and used a lot of good butter and eggs, but confused by other good reviews so not sure where it went wrong.

This is a horribly unbalanced recipe as are most of the recipes in the Baked cookbook. The Lemon Loaf calls for twice as much butter as needed and results in a coarse greasy mess. I wouldn't recommend this recipe nor any other recipes from The Baked Bakery cookbook and I wouldn't waste time trying to fix this recipe. There are too many better recipes out there.

Really good and really lemony, as the name implies. I loved it as I loved the intense lemon flavour. My husband wasn't a huge fan as the lemon taste was too strong for him. I've made it with both the syrup and the glaze and with just the glaze. I prefer with just the glaze. The syrup was too much lemon even for me! The cake doesn't need the syrup to stay moist.

I made this recipe but just with half of everything as I only had one loaf pan. Did not turn out as expected. I too thought it was slightly "eggy" and would probably not make it again. The flavour of the fresh lemons was great, the texture not so much.

I used a mixer instead of a food processor. Overall, it tasted delicious..very lemony..My husband loved it. It tasted best on day 3. There was an eggy taste the first day, but went away as it aged.

This cake made as instructed did not rise for me - the cake looks a bit flat, but does have a nice flavor. I prefer a loaf in the more traditional method, with nuts or blueberries. The syrup was great, but it would be good on anything.

Made exactly as written, but as a half-recipe. Guests ate every crumb, and I really liked the texture, the bright and forward lemon flavor, and it was so easy to make as well! This is a keeper!

This is without a doubt the best lemon loaf I have ever made. Don't listen to the bad reviews below, they have no idea what they're talking about. It is very moist and VERY lemony. I'm making it for my brothers 60th birthday party because when he had it at Christmas he said "I can't stop eating this, it's so good". I highly recommend this recipe!!!

This is recipe worked well for me. I used a mixer instead of a food processor and I had no problems, just make sure you use a large mixing bowl. I used hazelnuts on the top.I wouldn't that because the tastes of lemons and hazelnuts don't mesh too well together. I had some problems with glaze but it was because I used the wrong sugar. In my opinion, the glaze was a bit more tart than it should have been. I also used salted butter I just didn't use any salt and it worked out ok. I would make this again.

Delicious! Super lemony... mmmm. I will make again, but will try to cut down on the eggs, the sugar, the butter and see how things turn out. I just don't want to feel THAT guilty eating slice after slice.

I have made this cake several times and it always turns out fabulous! Remember to DRIZZLE the butter into the food processor. Everyone who I have served this cake to has raved about it and has asked for the recipe. I have served it with and without the glaze, but with is definitely my favorite!

I would make these again, they are delicious! Certainly not a low calorie or low fat lemon loaf by any means, but a must for giving to others or a special treat. My friends asked for the recipe as soon as they tried it! I love the fact that it uses so much fresh lemon and has such a strong lemon flavor!

I baked this loaf and noticed an eggy taste. The lemon syrup and glaze didn't seem to cover the egg taste. However, three days later, I tasted it again, and there was NO EGG TASTE. The lemon syrup and glaze are wonderful additions to the loaf. This recipe is definitely for lemon lovers...of which I am one! Carmen

In reference to some comments I would like to say: Food Processor: I used my food processor that was 8 cups and it worked out fine. I got nervous for a second but besides one dip from the shoot there was no real mess. Waste of Ingredients: I was a little surprised at the amount of eggs and butter required; it was by far the most ever used. However, if the directions are followed I cannot see how there would be any problems. I'm not an experienced baker at all so that might be to my advantage. I notice a lot of people (with more experience) tend to deviate from the recipe. I don't think that recipes with changes to the original should be rated.

I tried looking for cake flour but military grocery stores can be pretty limited at times. I did, however, find a bread flour (not knowing the difference until later) and my loaves still came out perfect! I'm not an expert baker or chef but I love to bake and cook. This recipe was very easy to follow. I only wish I knew about needing two pans earlier on. I had to send my husband out last minute to buy another one. Either way, I will definitely use this recipe again. :0)

This is amazing! It is time consuming but well worth the effort. I've made it a few times but never used the glaze, it's plenty sweet and moist enough without it. Maybe one of these days I will

Agree with below, this was such a waste of all my ingredients, but especially the butter and eggs. I started with a half recipe just to try it out and im glad i did. It was grossly eggy and just dripping butter, I almost gagged when i tasted it. I think you could half the butter and eggs, sub a little oil and have a great cake...going to try it that way, or just find a batter loaf recipe and take anothers advice and just add lemon zest and juice.

Unless you wish to have a greasy omelette, do not squander 8 eggs and a pound of good butter on this recipe. I'm an experienced baker and have made many dishes from Epicurious, but this recipe is decidely not one of the good ones.

Beware! Don't try this recipe in your food processor not unless it's industrial size. I took the advice of other cooks and simply use a large mixing bowl. That said, it still was a disappointment. Texture turned out coarse and chewy, and a half pound of butter and 8 eggs went to waste.

OMG - a great dessert that is so simple and packs a great lemon flavor. I used all organic ingredients for this effort. If I close my eyes, I swear that my Nanna made this and sent some my way. **** GREAT RECIPE FOR THE NOVICE BAKER. ****

I'm not sure what happened here. The cooking time alloted was WAY off - this was done at 55 minutes. My oven does cook a little hot but this was a serious time difference. Luckily, I just wanted to check it because I had a moment free and it's a good thing I did! However, it didn't matter - while not burnt, this cake was DRY beyond belief! Normally, I prefer pound cakes with some cream cheese or sour cream so the cake stays nice and moist. This cake definitely needs some such help! I took it to my grandmother's for Easter anyway as she loves lemons. I thought it might just appeal to her in spite of its flaws but there wasn't enough lemon taste to make up for the dryness. All in all, there are many other pound cake recipes that I love so I might just tweak one of those into having a lemony zing.

My new favourite lemon loaf recipe (once I got rid of the food processor). Very good, as light as cake but with a firmer crumb. Never mind the food processor, just start by beating eggs and sugar in a large mixing bowl and pour in the melted butter while you beat. This was a one-bowl whiz with easy clean up, and beating the eggs and sugar another couple of minutes after adding the butter improved the texture.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipes exactly. This is definitely a loaf - not a cake. It's a dense moist lemony loaf. A word on the actual baking process. Be warned you will use a lot of mixing bowls and your food processor isn't big enough. Unless you have a monster-sized food process there is no way you'll be able to fit in the sour cream after adding 8 eggs and the butter to the lemon sugar mix. At that point it was already leaking so I put the mix in a bowl and whisked. Seemed to mix up fine. I would halve the recipe next time - it would just make assembly simpler. But all in all the great lemony taste was worth it!

I have done this recipe (minus the glaze) at least 4 times (even doubled it once using a large food processor) and it has turned out perfectly each time, with everyone wanting the recipe. I have also added a few dried cranberries for an extra touch and that version was also very well received. Note however, it takes longer to cook...at least where I am...than the suggested time. This recipe is definitely "a keeper"'!

I'm a lemon freak, and this satisfied my "lemon tooth." It's so buttery and lemony, it's practically a lemon curd in cake form! The cake is moist, tender and delicious. The glaze gives it just the right sweet tang. My food processor also leaked a bit, and like the previous reviewer I didn't let the butter get completely cool. I also reduced the amount of sugar in the cake.

Excellent recipe, very easy to follow. Food processor also leaked, but was very careful in adding the sour cream, because I saw the level inching past max!! Did not cool butter that much. Reduced sugar in recipe by a quarter cup.

So lemony and sooo good. I think it should be called Lemon Lemon Lemon Loaf, because there are actually 3 lemon elements. This came out so moist and was intensely lemony. If you love lemon, make this.

One more note about my review below. The whole aspect of "folding" the flour into the wet ingredients was very strange, as you will see. I think of folding when the batter is much thicker. I dutifully "folded" the flour in and it was lumpy, as the batter that the flour was being folded into was just so very wet and runny, making for a weird process. There were lumps of flour around the size of 1 teaspoon, but I went with it just like that to see what would happen and it baked and turned out perfectly.

I followed the recipe exactly and LOVED it. I was apprehensive about all of those ingredients going into my food processor, which is a standard size, and sure enough, around 1/8 cup did leak out. This is really moist and different from a lemon bread--it's super moist, super lemony and the eggs really come through in a very delicious and interesting way. Would definitely make it again.

I made this on the weekend. I was afraid it was going to be too soft once I took it out of the oven, but it was perfect. The cake absorbed the syrup without getting soggy. Absolutely delicious! Everyone loved the intense lemony flavour.

Wait- after reading littlechef13's comment about the eggs, I looked back, and I must have accidentally put half of the needed eggs in.. So perhaps they are correct, but it does work, probably either way!

This is a beautiful recipe if followed exactly -Baking is a chemistry, you know- and needs to cook for the whole time. I took it out a bit early because the top was very golden, and I figured the browning meant it was done, but not quite. However, quite delicious, the syrup is a must.

i had high hopes for this recipe after reading all the sparkling reviews, but i was disappointed. while prepping the ingredients, i'd thought, that's a lot of eggs, but i gave it a chance. it was altogether too eggy. i ended up not serving it. the next day, i tried to salvage it and used it for nordstrom's bread pudding, but i would not make this recipe as it stands. needs adjusting.

Made half recipe because I only wanted 1 loaf. Turned out excellent. Did not make the glaze, maybe next time, ran out of time this time. Use for strawberry shortcake, got rave reviews from everyone.

Very moist and delicious, and everyone loves it. I've made it twice. I use the syrup but skip the glaze - you can also try brushing the syrup over the bottom, so the top stays a little more crunchy and you get a nice surprise when you eat the bottom of a slice. I'd like it to be more tangy, will cut the sugar and increase the lemon juice next time. My biggest problem is that on both occasions my food processor leaked. I had a big, gooey, raw egg and butter mess to clean up.

It was good, but not spectacular. I have made lemon loaves that are easier and just as tasty if not more so. I thought the directions were weird and complicated. Also I had to whisk in the flour to get it to combine.

I am not a fan of super-sweet, so I did not make the frosting. Even so, this was an incredibly lemony cake--and we enjoyed it. It tasted like lemons, lemons and lemons, with a few lemons thrown in for good measure. It was still too sweet for us--but we understand that we are odd that way. I think next week, I may try to cut the sugar down in the cake or in the syrup or both.

Very rich, but wonderful. Did not change a thing!

Verdict: gross. I followed the recipe closely except 1 thing: I used a whisk instead of a food processor. The melted butter was cooled to room temperature and became lumpy. The food processor would have taken care of that. Instead the loaves turned out a bit greasy. (Yes. I used real, unsalted butter.) It will probably taste good, but it looks bad. I will try this again, but with a food processor. So many people had good experiences that it would be worth it. The simple syrup and glaze is wonderful.

Fantastic recipe! This is one of the best desserts I've ever made! It comes out beautifully and the taste and texture are exceptional. I reduced the sugar to two cups and increased the lemon juice to about 1/3 to give it a slightly more tart taste and am glad I did. Be sure to use all of the lemon syrup, it keeps the cake moist and delicious. Freezes great!

Good, but not great. A bit silly that they wanted me to use a food processor - could have been done with a whisk. Overall it was yummy, but honestly not worth the calories. I'll stick to my low-fat banana bread (look up the recipe on this site, its amazing!)

Haven't made this yet but wanted to clarify that All Purpose flour can be substituted for cake flour using 7/8 C AP flour plus 2 T cornstarch per cup (replace the 2 T flour with cornstarch rather than just reduce the amount of flour). ;)

This is an AMAZING cake if you follow directions well. I prepared a smaller test cake first, and found that parchment paper lining in the pan is a MUST, and soaking the cake with 2 times the syrup (or three if you do the sugar and lemon to taste) makes for a much more moist cake. My family loved it, and i have already had repeat requests!!

I was interrupted so many times while making this cake that I completely forgot the vanilla and sour cream. I cut down the sugar for the cake by a quarter cup too. Despite the mistake, the cake was wonderful. I can only imagine that the sour cream and vanilla will make it even more so. I went the whole route with the glaze and four of us nearly wiped it out in one sitting.

SOOOOOOOO GOOOD! I just finished making the lemon loaves, and had to leave the room while they cool off and absorb the lemon syrup. Didn't come out looking like the picture thought, it looked better, more homemade. This was great considering it didn't take that long to make and it tasts amazing. An idea would be to make mini loaves and give them away as gifts during the holiday season.

Make this, you won't be disappointed!

This is definitely lemony - reminds me of the lemon poundcake that Starbucks sells only better. I used cookykamp's suggestion of using the wrappers from the butter for the bottom of the pans - "PERFECT" worked very well.

These are SINFULLY GOOD! I was skeptical after reading the first reviewer, so only made half a batch...wish I had made the whole batch now. I used little 6 x 3-1/2 loaf pans and got 3 beautiful loaves. Baked for 10 min. at 350 degrees, then about 20-25 at 325 degrees...perfect. Also, instead of using parchment, I just took the wrappers from the butter used in the recipe, trimmed them to fit my loaf pans..worked out perfect and no waste! Don't skip the glaze at the end...all the components add up to one heavenly taste! If you love lemon this is for you! I'm adding this to my Christmas gift give-away repitoire along with my Date Nut Bread and a jar of Chai Tea Mix. My friends are going to love me!

Excellent! My good friend who is a big fan of lemon cookies really loved this. A quick note to A Cook From Dubai: please don't ever use margarine for anything. It is one of the most unhealthy things you can put into your body.

To the reviewer who doubled or tripled the recipe - I recently took a cooking class and the chef said that there are certain recipes that don't turn out when you double the recipe. It has something to do with how one ingredient interacts with another, it is something scientific. I'm sure Alton Brown would be able to give you a good explanation why it won't work. You're better off mixing the ingredients one recipe at a time.

To the above reviewer - did you double all of the ingredients?? If so, You would have needed 16 eggs and 8 sticks of butter, as I see it. I haven't made it yet, I'm just addin' my 2 cents ...

This cake is YUMMY! Its a dense and buttery cake though so those watchin the waistline...stay away cuz once you have tasted it.. you wouldnt want to stop! Next time i might substitute 1 cup of the butter with margarine to achieve a lighter recipe. I didnt have cake flour as is not readily available where i live, so i used the simple subsitution formula, 1 cup cake flour = 1 cup All purpose flour minus 2 tablespoons. I dont like my cakes overly sweet so i cut the sugar down to 2 cups. It came out just right! I gave 1 loaf to a friend who hasnt stopped raving! Perfect tea cake... fresh and yummy!

There is something very wrong with this recipe. I made it yesterday with Meyer lemons and wasted 16 eggs and 8 sticks of butter as well as three precious meyer lemons when I had to throw all six (I doubled the recipe) of the loaves out! It may be that there is too much butter, but I cannot deconstruct the ingredients to determine what went so wrong. It would be great if some other brave soul would make and review.
