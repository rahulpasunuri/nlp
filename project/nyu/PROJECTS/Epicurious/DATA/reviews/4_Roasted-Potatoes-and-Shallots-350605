Wonderful side dish! My potatoes started to stick so make sure to stir it a lot. But the flavor was awesome. I did as one review mentioned and roasted the potatoes first, then added the Shallots. Very good and will make again soon!

I loved the idea of this recipe, but had reservations about roasting the shallots for so long, with good reason - they were in the oven for 20 minutes and started to burn. I took them out, roasted the potatoes, and added them back in for the last 5 minutes and they were very soft and dark. The next time I made them I put the potatoes in first, and then with 15 minutes left I added the shallots with much better results - they were brown, a little crispy, and delicious. I brought them to a dinner party and everyone thought they were awesome.

not bad, just not very special

Super simple and very delicious! I made this for Christmas dinner along with a prime rib and mixed veggies; I wanted something simple that could roast in the over along with the prime rib. This fit the bill! My 11-year old niece, the pickiest eater I know, went back for second and third helpings of this! Had people asking for the recipe before I they left!

Usually use cippolini onions & red potatoes, but had shallots & fingerlings on hand. Followed recipe using kosher salt instead. Big hit. Lovely flavor. Will prepare again.

Was looking for something simple to serve with last nights' leg of lamb. This recipe is definitely going into the rotation. Only real difference was I did not peel the potatoes and they were great.

My boyfriend picked this recipe out and I wasn't expecting it to love it, but it was surprisingly delicious! I'm in the middle of making it for a second time. Really tasty, especially given how simple it is.

I made this tonight and it was delicious. I couldn't find Yukon Gold (strange, right?) so I used gold fingerling potatoes instead. I roasted the shallots for 15 minutes, then added the potatoes and roasted an additional 30 minutes. I highly recommend,

Yum! Just like grandma used to make. I tossed the potatoes and shallots all at the same time and threw them in with a roast chicken with an hour left to go. Delicious!

I've made this twice already since I found this recipe. I added fresh rosemary both times to tie in with the main course. I only roasted the shallots for about 10 minutes before adding the potatoes. Very delicious and easy to make.

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were the only dish that had no leftovers! Delicious. Only suggestions would be not to cook the shallots as long alone if you want to leave them in the pan while you roast the potatoes. They were almost perfect after the initial 30 min, so I took them out while I roasted the potatoes. Also I roasted the potatoes longer than the recipe calls for because I like them really crusty, but that is personal preference. Very easy and very delicious.

I tossed in a half teaspoon of Herbs de Province near the end of cooking to give the dish a different flavor. Very tasty.

Good basic potatoes. I made these instead of mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving.
