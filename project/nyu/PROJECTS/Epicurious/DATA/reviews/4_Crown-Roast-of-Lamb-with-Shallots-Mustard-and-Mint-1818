I made this recipe for Father's day last summer and it was a hit... People still talk about it. I threaded the rack into a crown and placed the veggies in it and around it! Wow, very impressive platter! I added mint to the butter mixture and served with the sauce and some mint jelly, both on the side. I recommend this dish...

Easy. Nice. Spray stuffing with PAM after assembly so it doesn't fall apart. Oh, I also added more liquid to the stuffing to help with adherance

I made this for Easter dinner and it got rave reviews! I used lamb chops, and marinated them in 3T olive oil, 3T honey, 1/2 T dijon, 1 T fresh chopped rosemary and salt and pepper for about 2 hours. Then I panfried them and followed the rest of the recipe for the pan sauce (absolutely divine!). I omitted the potatoes from the spring vegetables and instead served garlicky mashed potatoes with a touch of cream cheese in them--perfect with the sauce from the lamb. The mint added such a wonderful freshness to the vegetables but was not overpowering (I'm not a huge fan of mint, but it was perfect in this dish).

Very simple and a good change from heavier rack of lamb preparations. I used fresh rosemary instead of the dried. Veggies are delicious too.

WOW!!! By far one of the best dishes I have EVER made. The meat was so succulent. I had six for dinner, and every single person was licking the bones! I am not a big fan of lamb, but this puts all that to rest. Just like all the others said...it is easy, it is delcious, and yes...it is expensive! But what is a delcious meal prepared for those you love worth? And I'll just tell ya again...IT"S DELICIOUS!!!!

This is the easiest but yet most elegant of all lamb dishes I have made. The sauce is great and all the colors of the veggies make this a truly unique presentation. My niece asks me every year if we will have it for easter nad it is a resounding YES!!!

Fabulous. Beautiful presentation. Delicious and different. Expensive, but well worth it. The family has raved about this meal for days.

This was not so hard (yes, expensive) but all the veggies surrounding it make it among the most beautiful entries to present. And once it's done, the whole main course is there, nothing more to bring out.
