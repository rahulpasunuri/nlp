I was really impressed by this; it reminded me of the pumpkin seed dishes that I've eaten in the Yucatán peninsula. I still think that this Sikil p'ak is my favorite: www.thenomadicoven.com/sikil-pak

I had such high hopes for this dish based on how much I love the ingredients and the glowing reviews. It did seem like a lot of work, but worth it for a delicious weekend meal. Though I followed the recipe to the letter, I ended up with a sauce that was more like a weird paste. It was like an oily course pesto or a badly emulsified homemade nut butter. The flavor was OK but the mouthfeel and appearance were just too gross--I actually ended up throwing the whole thing away and ordering tacos instead.

This is pretty time-intensive meal to prepare. As I was cooking the pepita portion, I was thinking "are you kidding???" but when I plated up the meal and served it up, I was amazed at how good it was! It is definitely something that you would find at high-end restaurant!

I served it with a brined, roasted turkey for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful! It makes a great substitute for the usual Thanksgiving faire. It's even becoming a family tradition.

This was great! I would probably take the skin off the chicken or try it grilled, but the sauce was excellent.

This was excellent, but being a busy new mom, I cheated the whole way through. Bottled tomatillo sauce from Trader Joes, roasted chicken pieces from Whole Foods, all I did was grind up toasted pepitas and voila! Seriously delicious and surprising.

Excellent recepie. Instead of putting the sauce over the chicken, I roasted off some cumin on a pan, ground it roughly in a mortar, and crusted the chicken with it. Seared it off, then, braised the chicken in the sauce until it was just done. Excellent! Ate it over rice.

A richly-flavored, delicious sauce. I was surprised how much everyone liked it, because from reading the ingredients list, I thought it might lack something, maybe acid. That was definitely not the case, though. I will certainly do this one again.

Yummy,something different-but VERY hot-and I'm Indian.I held strong and ate the dish since it was so good- but my poor Italian husband required several tissues and exclamations to get him through the meal.When I make it again I will not let as many seeds in- unless I'm feeling feisty.

Both I and the one friend I've served it to so far love the sauce, which we ate over grilled chicken. It's all I can do not to sit down in front of the pot with a spoon. I used already-roasted pepitas to save effort, fewer chilis, and less chicken broth with nice results. I recently harvested a lot of tomatillos from my garden, and I just finished making a double batch of this sauce, which I'll freeze in small servings to eat all winter. Delicious.

I was so drawn to this dish because it's something a little more unusual in Mexican cooking. I served it for a dinner party with visiting parents and a new boyfriend, and everyone absolutely loved it. It IS time consuming, so I did the prep work the night before. I used a coffee grinder for the seeds. The sauce can be used with anything, really, and it's better the day after.

I couldn't decide whether it looked worse than it tasted, or not. It was a mess either way. Ton of work, too. My suggestion: Run from this recipe.

There was something almost East Indian about the way this tasted. Sauce is superb and can be poured over chicken and fish cooked other ways.

I turned this into enchiladas by adding a little more heat (in the form of a few dashes chipotle hot sauce) to the sauce, reducing it by 50%, and adding about a cup of Crema Mexicana. For the tortilla filling I sauteed two small onions, combined it with the cooked chicken thighs, and added one cup of canned pumpkin and 8 ounces crumbled Queso Fresco. Perhaps this was unorthodox, but the result was incredible. . . .

We had this dish at a dinner party and everyone loved it!

This sauce was interesting and very good. It was also heavy and fairly oily, so I would cut back on the oil used next time. I would also like to be able to reduce the number of steps involved in making it, but am not sure where cuts could be made. I found the tomatillos and serrano peppers at a Whole Foods store.

Great sauce. I used grilled chicken breasts, and canned broth which worked out great. The sauce was a little too spicy (I think I added an extra chile or two), so I added some cream. Very nice!

Lovely! The leftover sauce was even better than it was the first night. The full recipe fed three of us. One thigh is too small to be a full portion of something this good.

Excellent dish - especially for entertaining. The chicken can be made in advance and then easily reheated to serve with the sauce. Presents beautifully and is delicious. Best when served with the recommended red rice and soft, warm, oiled corn tortillas.

My husband and I made this for a mexican summer barbque. Everyone loved it. While it did not look as green as in the picture it was delicious. It tastes like it has cream in it but not a drop. We served it with black bean, corn tortillas. The sauce is good on pork as well or just about anything.

wonderful stuff. Use left over Thanksgiving turkey too.

Fantastic! I cut the recipe in half, and it was wonderful. I served the dish with some flavored jasmine rice - 1 cup jasmine rice, 1.5 cups chicken broth, 1 tablespoon cilantro, 2 cloves garlic, a pinch of ginger and some salt. Bring to a boil (covered) then simmer for 15 minutes. The broth leftover from poaching the chicken works fine for this! My fiance was seriously impressed - "damn good!"

I once dined at a Mexican restaurant in -of all places! - Canterbury, England, and ordered a chicken dish that contained a mysterious green sauce. Not being able to coax the cook out of the kitchen, I left wondering what was the secret? Now I know. It was pipian. This sauce is definitely an unusual taste experience for the newly-introduced to authentic Mexican cooking. The only change I would make is to add more tomatillo sauce (salsa verde) to the pumpkin seed sauce, as it came out a bit too thick without enough spike for my tastebuds. I think this sauce would top a delicious enchilada dish with pork or chicken. In search of pepitas? If you have a Trader Joe's in your area, they have large packages of the seeds for far less than you would pay at a grocery or health-food store.
