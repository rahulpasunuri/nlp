The sauce was delicious. Didn't think it went well with the duck tho and didn't like the cooking method for the duck. I prefer to render fat side about 15 mins on a medium heat, then turn and cook 3-4 mins, then rest. Going to save the sauce recipe for pork.

This was amazing and not too difficult to make. I didn't have shallots and substituted regular Sherry for Sherry vinegar, but it came out great regardless.

Delicious! I added 1T Cointreau to the sauce just before it finished reducing. I added just a touch of duck fat to the sauce when I added the butter, and only added 2T butter. Perfect recipe, I can't wait to make it again. The sauce can also be used with chicken or cornish hens.

This recipe is fabulous, and was our Christmas dinner! We used our turkey fryer to cook the duck and we also cooked a chicken at the same time, (the kids who don't like duck). Both birds were about 6.2 pounds. I made the sauce the day before, and then reheated it before adding the butter and orange peel. The only change I made was to use Sherry instead of Sherry vinegar, which I did not have. The sauce was really delicious on both the duck and the chicken. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe turned out to be a wonderful holiday meal although we did have some problems along the way. I tried twice to cook the sugar and water mixture and both times it crystallized, never reaching the amber color. I took the advice of a previous reviewer to cook the sugar without the water until caramelized. This worked much better. We followed the remainder of the recipe as written (with the exception of omitting the orange segments) with great success. This was the first time our family had duck for Christmas dinner and the entire family is looking forward to making this recipe again.

Great recipe. Here is a slight variation. Cook the duck as follows: Preheat oven to 400°F. Trim any excess fat from duck breasts. Cut three 4-inch- long by 1/16-inch- deep lengthwise slits in skin (not meat) of duck. Season duck with salt and pepper. Heat heavy large ovenproof skillet over high heat until hot. Add duck, skin side down, and sear until brown, about 5 minutes. Turn over; cook 3 minutes. Transfer skillet to oven; continue cooking to desired doneness, about 3 minutes for medium. As to the sauce, adding a dash of Grand Marnier at the finish does not hurt.

Loved it. Followed the recipe as it was. Just great. We had only two of us so we are repeating the meal tonight!

Oh my....... It was a master piece. The recipe tells you just what to do. I hadn't eaten duck before this and this is probably the best way to start on my duck eating trail.

It was amazing. I made it exactly as the recipe indicated, and I will definitely be making this again.

A Couple of points: 1 - It is definitely improved by adding a few tablespoons of Grand Marnier towards the end. 2 - The grated orange peel needs to be added a little earlier so that it any bitterness is removed - and I prefer to add more of this than the orange segments. 3 - I found that the method for making the caramel took too long and even then frequently seized up and resulted in a mess of dried sugar lumps in the pan. Delia Smith's (famous British cook - similar to Julia Childs) method for making caramel is much easier and quicker - less than 5 minutes. Pour sugar (no water!) into a non-aluminium pan over a medium heat without stirring. When the sugar starts to melt a little around the edges give the pan a gentle shake and return to the heat. When approximately 1/4 of the sugar has dissolved start to stir gently until the caramel turns a golden brown. The sauce also freezes well prior to the addition of the orange segments which have a tendency to break up.

This dish was absolutely delicious. I had a whole duck so used that and poured the sauce on sliced duck - worked very well. The sauce is AMAZING -I followed it step by step and wouldn't change a thing, take the time it needs to prepare, aprox 45 minutes, and it works perfectly - I'm actually making it tonight to top off pork tenderloin!

I made this with the boneless/skinless breast of two wild mallards. It was very easy to make, and it turned out very well. I recommend cooking the breast to an internal temperature of 125F, and letting it rest for ten minutes for a nice, tender, medium-rare.

I used the expat's searing suggestion and it worked perfectly. I used blood orange vinegar and pomegranate simple syrup instead of sherry vinegar and sugar water. The sauce didn't really thicken much until the duck was done and I added some of the juices to it (in lieu of butter). 4 duck breasts and a 4 lb ham for 5 people ended up with a slice or two of ham left, one of the duck breasts, and a lot of delicious sauce that will be used on chicken tomorrow.

This is a fantastic dish. I used 2 large oranges and kept the rest the same. I think adding some Grand Marnier at the end would be good, as someone suggested - next time. My son said we should have duck more often and I agree! Served with wild rice and roasted asparagus, onions, and mushrooms. Fabulous!

This was fabulous, but the sauce does take a lot longer to reduce that the recipe states. Thanks to the comments of others, I made the sauce ahead of time and finished it when the duck was ready (I used a quartered duck, which took longer to cook than just the breasts.) I served it with a blend of wild and wehani rice and stir fried sugar snap peas. Delicious, simply delicious, and I can't wait to have it again.

Excellent. I cooked the duck while the sauce was starting so that I could add some of the drippings from the duck into the sauce; it made all the difference in the world! Also, make sure that you have enough heat to sear the duck without cooking it too much through--it needs to be pink inside. And open a window or use a vent while cooking the duck--my whole kitchen was filled with smoke because I didnt think to do either.

This was an excellent recipe. I read the reviews and decided to alter the recipe a bit as some suggested. I used only two oranges. And at the end of the sauce reduction I added 2 Tbsp Grand Marnier when I incorporated the butter. I also decided to follow the cooking procedures of another tried and true duck breast recipe. It is similar to these instructions however turns out perfect each time. First I seared it, skin side down, for 10minutes. Then turned the duck over and seared for 2minutes longer. Immediately I placed the duck breast, meat side down into a 425 degree oven for about 8minutes. It turned out perfect. My husband thought this recipe rated 4 forks, as he said it was awesome. I would have to agree. Very impressive.

This was incredible! Easy to make and delicious. I've made it a few times for my husband who is Belgian and for his birthday I'm making it for a special dinner with my French neighbors.

This was perfect. For a cuter plate, I used clementines instead of oranges, and did not mix the segments into the sauce, but rather served them on the side. 1 clementine per serving was enough. I also used magret duck instead of muscovy, and the cooking time was still correct, but the duck really splatters dangerously so you need to keep away from the stove as much as possible.

All I can say is the sauce was delicious and I am making it again tonight. Have been dying for the chance to make it again. Definitely leave an hour for sauce reduction and 2 oranges are plenty.

this was beyond expectations! very good. i included blood oranges for some colors, and if i were to try it again, i would hold back on the chicken stock, and use the duck breast fat instead from the frying pan. je suis une chef francais! :)

This was a delicious tasting recipe, but I do have a few hints... do not worry if your sugar and water mixture becomes crackly, it will melt whne you add the juice... make sure that your oranges are sweet, I used some South African oranges and they were quite bitter and finally, if you use duck legs, braise them first in a hot fry pan then transfer to a baking dish and roast them for about 30-40 minutes at 375 , I also basted them with the sauce. We really enjoyed this recipe. Does anyone have any other duck recipes that use cherries?

Served with parsnips (which went beautfully with the sauce) and radicchio (which was a nice contrast to the sweetness in the sauce, but not my favourite) this was a lovely dish. The sauce did take a while to boil down, as everyone said it would (allow at least an hour); but it was easy to make and was worth the wait!

Rating: 3
Time consuming sauce, but with a good flavour. I added two thick slices of ginger to the sauce at the stock stage. A very strong sauce that went well with the duck. We used smoked duck, as it was the only thing available.

Absolutely delicious! A huge hit in my house!

This sounded so impressive when I told my family what I was making. Not hard but time consuming. If I were making it again for guests, I would make the sauce the day before so not to worry. I have had this with cloves added so I might try that next time.

Just wonderful! Added 2T Grand Marnier to the sauce with much success.

I loved this sauce, although I DID make a couple of small and pleasant alterations to it: instead of chicken broth, I made a lovely broth from the duck neck, wings, feet and back bone, which I then reduced to the required 1 1/2 cups. This intensified the flavor. I also reduced the number of fresh oranges from 4 to 2 (4 just seemed way too overwhelming for the amount of sauce). The cooking time for the duck seems a little scant to me. Mine came out nearly raw after the recommended 18 minutes. But then again, I was working duck halves as opposed to just the breasts. Overall, wonderful recipe.

I thought the recipe was pretty good. It yielded a relatively authentic duck a l'orange. I would definitely not follow the timing outline by the recipe, however. The number of oranges, as stated by other reviewers is not necessary. Adding some of the duck's juices definitely complemented the sauce as well.

Rating: 3
I thought that this ended up as a delicious and elegant dish. However, I had to make the sauce twice. The recipe calls for 1/2 hour of reduction after the addition of the stock. I went and took a 15-minute shower and came back to a completely reduced and charred pot of something that looked like marmalade! So keep an eye on it... it's worth it-- the final result was very good.

This was a fast and simple way to prepare duck, although i think there are WAY too many oranges in this recipe (almost more oranges that duck!). i'd use at most 3 medium oranges next time or 2 large ones. otherwise pretty tasty and simple.

I thought this dish was great and simple. It does take a while to reduce the sauce, but who doesn't have something to do around the kitchen while it simmers away? I did add a couple of tablespoons from the drippings to the sauce, which probably added a bit to the flavor. I also quartered a whole duck and included the drumsticks, which were also delightful and there was more than enough sauce.

Turned out great. To answer the San Franciso Chef's question for a side-dish, I served wasabi mashed potatoes (there's a recipe on this website) and stir-fried asparagus with lots of ginger. An asian-style cole slaw using a vinagrette of mayonaise, rice wine vinegar, ginger and finally a touch of sesame oil, would also be an easy and tasty complement.

Excellent idea to try it with salmon--I did so last night, and it was marvelous. I advise being very careful about not adding the orange segments to the sauce until you're moments before you're ready to pour it over the meat. Any suggestions for a light, possibly gingery or Asian-style vegetable complement?

It was wonderful on wild duck. I am trying it tonight on salmon. Let it reduce as the recipe says.

Added Grand Marnier to the sauce as suggested, I agree that the recipe calls for too many orange segments, the reduction process is slow going but the dish was definitely worth the wait.

Rating: 1
I believe this recipe to be seriously flawed with the amount of orange juice, and with the general amount of liquid -- you start out with over 3 cups of liquid stuff! Even after reducing according to instructions the sauce isn't thickened at all, and it's awfully sweet. Besides, it's a crime not to use pan juices in a preparation of this kind.

wonderfull! I've made this dish several times. It takes a long time, so allow for that (I ended up serving valentines day dinner at 10PM the first time I made it) but it is well worth the wait. I serve it over cous-cous and follow with chocolate souffle for a fancy dinner.

Excellent. I added a heafty portion of Grand Marnier to the sauce, Yummmm. I served this dish with turnips and carrots which I boiled and then sauted in butter. A roasted sweet onion went on each plate as well. A hearty '97 Mondavi Cabernet was a great partner. The house smelled like heaven... that is if heaven includes roasted onions and Grand Marnier! You will get an extra kiss for this classic.
