This was delicious and so easy to make. The leftovers heated up well and tasted just as good. I served it with a sage polenta and broccoli rabe to rave reviews.

So easy and so good! My plan was to make it ahead and reheat the next night, but it was so good I couldn't wait. I cooked everything in a dutch oven and roasted carrots with it-yum!

This was yummy. A taste to remember. I followed the recipe as is, with maybe a little more garlic. Couldn't stop eatting it...and the next day, better.

I probably wouldn't make this again (unremarkable dish) but if I did, I'd lower the temp and cook it longer. Found it tough.

Loved this! I have tried it as the instructions suggest and I have done a pureed version of the sauce after reducing - the puree method was really, really fantastic and a little more elegant looking on the plate. I froze extras [sauce, shank and all] and reheated without any impact to flavour or esthetic. Make sure to chop the fresh rosemary garnish very fine as it can sometimes be a tad chewy. Definitely a dinner party quality offering.

Wonderful! This recipe is great and so easy. I used one lamb shank and some leftover lamb (from butchering two racks the week before). I also added anchovy paste to the onions and black olives with the tomotoes. I would definately make again for company.

This sounds fabulous. Has anyone frozen the whole shebang and then reheated with the fresh herbs just prior to serving? I need to make one week ahead if possible.

Loved it! My husband is not a big fan of lamb but he enjoyed this dish. I added a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste.

Delicious! I made this for seder dinner and it was fabulous. I even had to make it with low sodium broth and no added salt - (for my father-in-law's diet) and it was still great. My kids loved it too!

Loved this recipe! Cooking it the night before made it easy to put this big feast (dinner for 9) together. I made this for our second Seder dinner, and our guests loved it! I added a little fresh Rosemary and dried Majoram to cook with the onions and celery. I also added 12 anchovies fillets before adding the can of tomatoes, which really enhanced the flavor of the lamb. (A tip I learned from the "Naked Chef.") I would serve this dish with rice next time - to soak up all the yummy juices from the stew. Although it did pair nicely with my roasted Butternut Squash.

This dish is wonderful! Served with braised lentils. Real comfort food. Even my husband who doesn't like lamb loved this and so did my 10 year old. Try it - you won't be disappointed!

I made this dish to celebrate my husband's birthday. We both loved it and will make it again. I made it just for the 2 of us, 2 shanks, but will definately make it for guests. My husband gave it a rating of 9 out of a possible 10!

Really quite excellent! My only difficuly was finding a pot big enough. I reduced the sauce after removing the shanks for about 1/2 hr and then put the sauce through the blender. I cut the meat into bite-size pieces and served over linguine. Freezes well too! It will definitely be a recipe I use over & over again

I just made this for the first time last night - It was easy, the kitchen smelled great and the results were wonderful. I halved the amount of lamb but made the whole recipe for the sauce and will use it tonight or tomorrow over noodles or meatloaf. A real keeper!

I added a few more spices, majorame, thyme...it was wonderful. The sauce was so good my husband used it as a base for spagetti the next day.

This recipe was easy to make. My husband and I both enjoyed this and it was even better the next day as leftovers. Next time I might leave out some of the rosemary and I wasn't quite sure how long to boil the sauce when the dish was finished so it would thicken. I served this over rice and it was tasty.

THIS RECIPE IS EASY TO MAKE AND GREAT MAKE AHEAD DISH. THE ORIGINAL PUBLISED RECIPE PAIRED THIS WITH A NAVY GRATIN AND A SALAD WITH CROQUE MONSIEURS AS A STARTER. I FIRST SERVED THIS DINNER TO FRENCH BUSINESS GUESTS (OF ALL PEOPLE) AND IT WAS QUITE SUCCESSFUL.
