This is a standard anytime I want something elegant and delicious for dinner guests. Makes quite a presentation. Love recipe as is, but prefer it warm to chilled. Also good with a little creme fraiche stirred in at the end.

The result was really quite bland. I was dissapointed because the reviews were over the top. A stronger stock might make the difference (I used low sodium). We did use almost 2 pounds of asparagus and that may have diluted the flavor a little but then the soup was not too thick. The timbales was pretty flavorless as well.

I made the recipe exactly as listed and it was superb. Served it warm with the timbale for dinner. The next day, we had the leftover soup chilled, without the timbale. It was just as good!

So good and so elegant! Good hot, warm and fully chilled. If you aren't going to make the timbale (and you don't need to; add the lemoned/shalloted crab into the bowl, add diced avocado if using, pout in soup, dollop with fat free yogurt and add caviar on top of that), you can skip the avocado. A "red" caviar (salmon or tabiko or the domestic cheap stuff from the grocery store) add a nice brininess that enhances the crab. Very easy, healthy and impressive. Make it!

I've made this recipe several times in the last 6 months and it is perfect every time. Delicious!

Quick and easy. Quite tasty. Use a vegetable mill if you don't peel the asparagus -- those fibers are tough to puree otherwise.

Loved this recipe! I served it hot with the timbale (no caviar) and drizzled with white truffle oil. Yum! I used half stock & half light cream and it was very filling. I also used arugula instead of the spinach. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious. Two tips. Add a touch of cream of the thickness of your choice. As well, if you want to do the timbales ahead, get a small very nice cracker (Carrs is good), and prepare them in advance on he cracker. When time to serve just put the cracker on top of the soup it will sit on top!

I mad ethis according to the recipe - no subsitutions other than cheaper America caviar. I tasted the asparagus soup as I was making and that alone was amazing - really like it alone hot. Finished dish after chilling and assembling was also really good. I was telling my husband I couldn't decide if I liked the soup better hot or cold. really tasty and the kind of recipe you can easily tweak to your personal preferences.

Love this soup recipe. It's beautiful for a special occasion (I first made the soup on Christmas Eve with the crab and caviar) or perfect for a healthy casual lunch without the crab. I use an immersion blender and the soup is done in a flash.

Made this several times, each to acclaim. I find it needs a bit of sea salt and lemon at the end to perk up the soup and I often throw in a few snipped chives at the end. I've done it with and without caviar, also have made it with marinated chopped shrimp instead of crab, and have added a dollop of creme fraiche or sour cream too. It looks fabulous, but is fairly easy to make, esp if the soup is done ahead of time. Pureeing the soup to a rich consistency and using good quality veggies is key.

This was a huge hit at my dinner party last night. I used Tobiko- flying fish roe instead of the caviar to top it off. I love the contrast of the orange roe on the avocado.

I made this as a hot soup in February and it was excellent (the crab and avocado were added at room temp). I blended using an immersion blender and it was super easy. I also skipped the caviar

This is one my favorite summer recipes. I always get a favorable response from those for whom I make it. I know very little about caviar and don't care for it particularly. So, I prefer to top the timbale with a little riced egg. (To rice an egg: cut a cool hard boiled egg in half; separate white from yolk; press first the white & then the yolk through a potato ricer). Sprinkle about teaspoon of riced white and a 1/4 teaspoon of riced yolk on top of the timbale. Perfect for lunch or brunch on a hot summer day.

ok, i didn't make the timbale, which i think would elevate anything. but i thought the soup was cafeteria quality.

No review, because I haven't made it yet, just a note to the cook with the Linda Blair effect--be sure to remove the small cup on top of the blender before blending hot soups. You can put a towel over it, but having the space open lets the pressure from the steam escape, which prevents the lid from flying off, covering you and the kitchen with green stuff.

I'm only at the taste for seasoning stage, still warm, no timbale yet, but this is so good, and so easy to make, I had to give it a favorable review even before seeing the end result. Watch out, though, there's a certain Linda Blair effect on the blender...that's why I had to pull up the recipe again, to print a readable copy! Hold that lid down TIGHT.

This is a wonderful soup, especially for entertaining. It is beautiful and delicious. I added lemon juice and doubled the crab. A segment of PVC pipe worked very well to mold the timbale.

This was a big hit! My husband loved it.I substituted one cup of white wine for a cup of the chicken broth and I added just a touch of fresh lemon juice. This is a perfect meal for a hot night.

Elegant, delicious dish. Made exactly according to recipe and was surprised how good the taste and presentation was given how easy to make and how light the ingredients. Served with Sea Bass Chermoula with Braised Fennel from the Gourmet Cookbook. It's so hard to find good recipes for entertaining - dishes that can be made in advance and will please even diet-obsessed guests. This menu was a hit on all counts.

I made this soup on Mother's day and everyone loved it. It tastes great and looks amazing. We also ate the leftovers hot the next day and enjoyed it again.

This soup was so fantastic - even the non-veggie lovers really enjoyed it. I didn't do caviar. Instead put a small dollup of low-fat sour cream to top off the timbale. Shallots are also great with crab meat mixture. I found it easiest to use hands to mix crab meat. Would be great served warm as well.

I served this last night at a dinner party with some of our friends from our wine group. I followed the recipe exactly, except I served it warm (it's winter) and doubled the crab in the timbale. Excellent, and very easy to make. It does require last minute prep work, approx. 10 minutes, so be prepared. Served it with a '96 Chassagne-Montrachet.

This is perhaps one of the finest soups I have ever served. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. The second time I substituted chilled bay shrimp marinated in lemon juice and shallots for the crab and skipped the caviar, topped w/creme fraiche instead--served as first course, followed by crab cakes w/chipotle aioli, and finished with chilled strawberry rhubarb compote. My guests raved the most about the soup-although it looks beautiful and fancy, it is really quite simple to prepare.

This is a most elegent soup,eeasy to make and absolutely delicious. It will be on my list to make for entertaining when I really want to pull out all the stops. Great Soup!

I made this soup for an upscale Mexican dinner party and used a tomato coulis (sauteed shallots with peeled, seeded and chopped tomatoes...cooked down until fairly dry..then mashed) instead of the caviar. It was a great success.

In my husband's words, this soup was a grand slam. It was wonderful for a dinner party because it could be made ahead. The timbale of crab & shallots, avacado, & caviar made all the difference - don't skip this part - plus it was easy. I took the advice of another reviewer and substituted 2 cups of fat free half and half for 2 cups of the chicken broth - it imparted a nice, but not heavy, creaminess. Lots of oohs and ahhs with this soup - an elegant soup to begin a meal with.

WONDERFUL! A KEEPER. I DID ADD SOME MIXED HERBS TO THE SOUP TO GIVE IT A BIT MORE FLAVOR. ALSO SERVED IT WARM WITH THE COLD CRAB, ETC. THE AVOCADO IS ESSENTIAL. USE A GOOD GOB OF CAVIAR. I HAAVE ONLY GIVEN 4 FORKS TO ONE OTHER RECIPE. SO THERE YOU GO!

Yummy. Easy to prepare in advance. Surprising delicious and refreshing. Did not use Osestra caviar - opted for Black White Fish instead - which was an attractive and certainly less expensive garnish. Also added a little cayenne to the soup, but that's me - and was nice, subtle kick. : ) Enjoy!

I forgot to pick up fresh spinach and used frozen(thawed) instead, with no apparent harm done. I am definitely going to make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was first rate.....absolutely gorgeous, delicious, and relatively easy. The soup itself freezes well, too. The only thing I would add next time might be a sprinkling of paprika or cayenne for color. Perfect for a elegant summer meal starter!

Instead of the timbale which sounded time consuming I served this with bowls of chopped vegetables, avocado, red peppers, scallions, tomatoes and a dollop of creme fraiche. Great!

A lovely elegant starter. I had to get rid of a large amount of crab and this was a nice way to do it. Even my non seafood-eating guests dug right in. The colors look great together. A very luscious cold soup. Not difficult. I would highly recommend this.

This was a delicious soup. The next time I may use lobster meat instead of the crab. It is not difficult and looks spectacular. A very elegant starter.

I served this soup without the crab. Refreshingly different from most soups. Great flavor.

I made the soup from this recipe as is, with the exception of substituting 2 cups broth and 2 cups fat-free half and half for the 4 cups broth, to make it creamier. I did not, however, make the timbale, opting instead for a simpler garnish of diced avocado seasoned w/pepper and lemon juice, mixed with grated romano, chopped shallots, and some tarragon. Excellent! Rich, wonderfully flavored soup.

This recipe was a HUGE success with my in-laws. My wife and I owed them a big favor, and we chose this soup to start off the big dinner that was their 'reward'. I followed the recipe with one exception - I used black lumpfish roe instead of Iranian caviar (sorry, I have limits). If you're pressed for time, you can reduce the chilling time to a half hour by chilling the container in ice. Once again - it was an amazing dish!

I barely followed this recipe, but perhaps my comments will be helpful since there are no others. I used the asparagus soup recipe from a veg. cookbook which is almost identical, but includes 4 tbls. uncooked white rice. Sautee the rice with butter and leeks until translucent but do NOT brown. Then puree the soup and the rice adds a nice thick creaminess without the cream. For the timbale, I reserved about 1/2 cup of the soup mixture strained and pureed it with 1 avocado and added 4 egg whites into the blender. Poured this in 1/5 cup portions into glass timbale baking dishes (very small glass bowls or short juice glasses work). Set glasses in baking dish with water matching the height of the filling. Baked at 350 until dry. Unmolded these in the bowl. Topped with sauteed shrimp, drop of creme fraiche and cheap black cavier and surrounded with a warm soup and it was delicious.
