Made this for a Super Bowl party and it was a huge hit. Really really yummy. Was great both with chips and on wings and pork and almost anything else that was around! Can't wait for summer to try it on things coming off the grill. I listened to some of the earlier comments and was careful with the amount of liquidity. Used an immersion blender, and it worked perfectly.

I really like this -- had about five pounds of tomatoes in my garden i had to do something with, and now i think i might find some pretty jars and make some gifts here. Next time I might just roast all the ingredients in a 350 oven to get the same roasted effect with less effort. I'd leave the tomatoes in a bit longer than the rest of the ingredients because if there's one tiny fault with the way mine turned out, it's that I think it's just a touch watery.

This is so easy and so delicious...plus, it made my house smell wonderful! I added about a 1/2 tsp salt because I thought it needed it. Next time I will put my garlic through a garlic press before adding it to the blender. I had some big chunks I had to fish out and mince.

This is a fantastic salsa! Just loved! Followed a fellow reviewer and kept the tomatoes whole, blackened in a cast iron skillet, then used a food processor to coarsely chop. After I added it back to the skillet, I simply let the salsa 'rest' in the hot pan for 15 minutes to lightly cook, since I like my salsas more on the fresh uncooked side. Perfect!

Absolutely wonderful! Very complex flavors and a simple preparation. If you prefer more heat add a bit more chipotle - I make 2 batches, one hotter and one as stated in recipe to please the crowd. Freezes well. Wonderful on chicken, pork and steak tacos, as well as served with chips.

Tastes great, has beautiful color, and the preparation is very easy! Texture is slightly liquid, but not too much. Very desirable with chips, and will get cheers from your guests. Everyone will try to guess what gives it the slightly sweet flavor. Take note that the tomatoes should be cooked whole, and not cut into chunks. This allows the onions, garlic and tomatoes to get scorched. I think the recipe could have been slightly more clear on that one point.
