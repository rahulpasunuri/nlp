The best cake I have ever made! Fantastic result never lacking in flavour. Make sure to make this cake in season so as not to lose on the main flavour of the blackberries. Will definetley be making this recipe with rasberries or peaches just for a twist!

other people mentioned that the frosting was really fatty so instead of 3 stiks i used 2 and it still came out pretty bad in my opinion. my fiance likes it though. and the cake was pretty good, nothing special though. i might try the cake with a different frosting

This recipe sounded so good that I made it for an important family birthday. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fine - not hitches. BUT it was so not worth the work. The flavors weren't all that special or different. Big dissappointment - won't make it again.

This cake was somewhat dry, the flavors could have been interesting together, but totally not worth the fuss. I won't make it again.

Made this for my mom's birthday a few years back and she said it was the best cake she's had... which is saying a lot! I still dream about it.

I made this for friends and used peaches instead of blackberries. It was fantastic, and everyone raved. One friend said it was in her top five of favorite cakes, and it wasn't even made with chocolate. (She is a certified chocoholic.) If you're using peaches, cut down on the sugar and add a bit more cornstarch.

This cake was visually stunning, but to me, it just tasted like butter and sugar, no real flavor. Standard good wedding cake taste. I'm all about flavor so I would not make this again.

This is a heavy dense cake. I made a cranberry jam (straiined) instead of blackberries- and it was great. I spread thin layers of both the cranberry jam and the buttercream frosting between each cake layer.

Spectacular. I made this cake for a good friend's birthday, and everyone raved. I think it's one of the best cakes I've ever tasted. I made the recipe as is and wouldn't change a thing. The tartness of the berries is a perfect foil to the richness of the buttercream. I will make this again and again and again...

I made this cake for my brother's birthday party and it was a hit. A few people told me that the frosting was very rich (as someone else here has mentioned, it is a bit fatty - something I would fix the next time I make it), but that was the only negative comment. The cakes were delicious. I used hazelnuts instead of walnuts, and i frosted the sides and top of the cake because there was SO much frosting. I think a half-recipe would have sufficed! Also, I did not make the jam but rather used store-bought blackberry jam and spread a little of that between each layer. I simply topped the frosted cake with fresh blackberries. Overall, minor changes to an excellent recipe!

I made this for my husband's birthday and was disappointed by the buttercream, which was too fatty, and the jam, which was much too thin. The cake was lovely and I would serve it again with another frosting or even alone with strawberry jam and creme fraiche, but the flavors and textures really didn't come together as I was hoping they would.

This is a wonderful recipe. The jam turned out a litle thin, and I had extra, so I poured it over the blackberries once the cake was assembled, and let it drizzle a little down the sides--beautiful and delicious...and EASY!

Great. Subbed almonds for the walnuts and raspberries for the blackberries. Fabulous and very elegant.

This cake was amazing! A true crowd pleaser and quite easy to prepare. I made a few minor changes..I spread each layer of cake with a thin layer of jam before the buttercream. I also found there was so much buttercream that I used less in between the layers and frosted the sides too. Such a big hit. If blackberries weren't so expensive, I'd make it all the time. With the 2lbs needed @ 3.99 per 1/2 pint it adds up well into the $20 range.

I made it just as written and it was wonderful - Everyone raved about it. Definitely a perfect ending for a dinner party!

This cake was phenomenol. It received incredible reviews from everyone I served it to, including someone who "never makes, eats, or likes desserts." I used hazelnuts in place of the walnuts, and used an organic brown sugar in the cake batter, which gave it an amazing depth of flavor. Every aspect of this cake is fantastic.
