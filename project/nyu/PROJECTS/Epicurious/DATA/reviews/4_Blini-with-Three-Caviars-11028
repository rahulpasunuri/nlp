Made these for a Christmas party to serve with sour cream, smoked salmon and chives. They went down very well indeed! I would not, however, recommend making them with wholemeal buckwheat flour (which was the only kind available in my local supermarket). It gave them a rather yucky grey-brown colour which wasn't very appetizing, although they tasted fine.

This recepie is great for ones who enjoy the process of cooking, as it has few stages and at the end you have a wonderful result. I used all organic ingredients and it came out very nice. This blini are ideal for caviar. And i made them for russian holiday 'Masleniza' - when whole week you eat blini!

Has anyone tried freezing the finished blini? The recipe looks very good, and I understand the time issue. So it would be great to make them now and serve at the holidays. Any advice appreciated!

When I last made these blini, I put them on my toyo stove to raise and went about my busy day. When time was up and I should check the raising blini dough, it had come up and out of my very large bread bowl, across the toyo stove, down the front, across the stove platform, thence down the front to the floor and across the floor through the living room to the kitchen. Now, did any of you hear my screams when I finally looked up? We called it "One blini mess". The blini were heavenly when cooked and served with red (chum) caviar and creme fraiche.

Oh my God, YUM! The recipe might seem daunting at first, but I promise, it is worth it.

These where absolutely wonderful. Mixing up the batter I was wondering what everyone was complaining about. This was easy, but then I got to actually cooking up about 100 or so itty bitty pancakes. It was a pain! It was worth it! Served it with cold smoked salmon, creme fraiche, chives and fried capers. I made them for a New Years Eve poker party and they were the hit of the night.

If you like caviar, you MUST make these blini to go with next time. They are heavenly -- especially with creme fraiche. Be sure to leave enough time for preparation. You won't be sorry.

It's not so hard to make - Mostly mixing thingsin a bowl and waiting. Overnight refrigeration does make the blinis exceptionally tangy - almost beery in flavor. They're excellent with the caviar, and also served hot with butter and honey.

This recipe is worth the trouble, the blini are superb, moist and tender. Caviar and blini are sinful but such a pleasure.

This was very good, but took quite a bit of work. I topped the blinis with beluga, sour cream watered down with milk, chopped red onion and egg, and chives. They looked beautiful and tasted great. I was worried when I tasted the blinis fresh off the pan and plain, (very yeasty) but the completed product was wonderful. This was definitely the star of the party.

They were nice, but I'm not sure I'd agree that they were worth the trouble. Perhaps the fault could be mine -- lots of chemical processes there that must go right -- but I think I'd look for a simpler recipe next time. I think I'd also increase the buckwheat flour to plain flour ratio.

This recipe is outstanding. It does take a little time, but well worth it. Use creme fraiche instead of sour cream for a real treat. Don't be fooled by the taste of the blini without the condiments. Toghether with caviar, creme fraiche, onions, eggs - wow. Incredible.

This is EXCELLENT! It might look a bit daunting but the time is well spent (doesnt actually take too long. I only used fresh salmon row - served the dish for an intimate new years celebration - It could even be called a sensual dish...
