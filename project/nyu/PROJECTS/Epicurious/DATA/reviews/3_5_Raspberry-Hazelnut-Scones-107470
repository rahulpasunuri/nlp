I made these for a brunch and everyone raved about them. One guy said "this may be the single most delicious thing I've ever eaten". I had no trouble with the jam oozing, possibly because I made them the night before and cut them when they were still pretty cold with a very sharp knife. I also used toasted pecans instead of hazelnuts because I had some on hand. I used one of those double layer cookie sheets so had no trouble with the bottom overcooking. Really great scones!

I've made this recipe twice now, and both times got rave reviews! However, I have found that it's far less work to make the scones without the jam and to simply serve it on the side. When you fill the scones with the jam, you can't stuff enough of it in there to make a flavor impact -- it just seeps into the dough, leaving you wanting more on the side anyway. That said, they're beautiful and tasty and I plan to make them again and again!

I'm glad I wasn't planning on sharing these with anyone. They were really yummy, but turned out really ugly, slicing the rounds. The tops slid to the side because of the preserves. Next time I will definitely make the scones individually, placing a thumbprint of preserves in the middle and sealing the edges. The scone is sweet and moist, not dry at all, and the preserves are a wonderful counterpoint. These are a wonderful treat to wake up to in the morning.

Cookin' up a storm says: Quite possibly the finest scone outside of England I have ever had. Texture was quite pleasing even though I didn't use cream but 1%. NO lie,1%! They were moist but not soggy nor heavy. Yes, the stick and a half of butter was neccessary. Can't imagine a scone without it. I finely ground my hazelnuts so they were more mealy and thus easier to work the dough. I smoothed the jam as instructed and I forked the top layer around the edges to prevent oozing. I did pre cut but even so, they were so close together, I had to leave in a few extra minutes as the ones in the center weren't quite done after 16 minutes. I made 12 small vs. 6 large and dusted the tops with powdered sugar immediately after removing from oven. Dear Lord they were tasty and didn't need even a dollop of clotted cream on the side. As good as it gets in my book.

These may have been the best tasting scones I have ever made. They were very flaky with all of the butter and cream. I use a scone pan that perfectly sizes and shapes the scones... these actually stuck to the pan because they were so fragile. They tasted great though. Obviously with the scone pan, you don't have to cut the rounds...just shape into balls, dip a well in the center, and place the jam inside, then seal the edges. I will probably make them the same way next time, just forget the scone pan.

I test-drove these today in preparation for making them for a baby shower. I followed the recipe as is (except I halved the ingredients). Note, I did not refrigerate the dough/scones, just baked them straight away. I made heart- shaped individual scones and had no problem with the jam oozing out. My only problem is that I baked for 15 mins, and the bottoms had already browned, but the center was still just a little undercooked. I think I need to lower the temp. a bit (maybe to 380?) bec my oven gets very hot. But a delicious and easy scone. Will def. make for the shower!

The flavor was terrific, but I, too, had trouble with the jam oozing out, which made the appearance suffer. Otherwise, this is a 4-star recipe.

These were nice enough, but I wouldn't try them again. The raspberry-hazelnut flavour combination is very good, and it's nice to have a bit of a hazelnut crunch in and on the scones. I cut the raspberry filling by 1 Tbsp to reduce spill-out while baking. The dough itself was a bit too rich and "cookie-ish" for me (I blame it on the cream and generous amount of butter used).

Very, very good. Used toasted, chopped pecans in place of hazelnuts. Followed the lead of others and made two discs. Had the same issue with the filling oozing out once I cut the discs. Will try making individual scones next time. Easy to prepare and the results are wonderful.

These scones are excellent! I made them once and they oozed a bit so this time I did the following. I made 2 large disks instead of 4 smaller ones. I spread the 4 tbls of preserves on one disk and then put the second disk on top and sealed the edges. I cut it into 8 pieces and placed them in a scone pan. I had to cook them about 25 - 30 minutes using the scone pan (Still at 400 degrees). I then let them cool in the pan for about 30 minutes and removed. They came out perfect and all the preserves stayed inside the scone.

These scones are our family's answer to Christmas morning breakfast...easy & delish! A batch of these makes a lovely treat to give to friends; I've even presented it as a small hostess gift so the hostess has something to anticipate the morning after the party.

The recipe is excellent just the way it is. They did not leak too much on me. Since everyone said it was a great base recipe for scones, I used it as the base, kneaded in chopped up dried apricots and craisins, left of the preserves all together and put chopped pecans on the top. It was terrific.

This is a such a delicious batter! Made it the first time for Mother's Day today, and there were several people who professed to dislike scones who had two or more. I made them with both the hazelnuts and the raspberry preserves and they were excellent, but again, this was such a great batter that I'll use it as my base scone recipe from now on and modify fillings. Yes, they oozed a little when made exactly as directed, but it's easy to make individual scones w/o ooze factor. So good!

I made this recipe for my co-workers. I didn't have Hazelnuts on hand so just used chopped Pecans. I made the dough the night before and baked them in the morning. I almost got mugged on the way to my office they looked so beautiful and smelled so delicious. Everyone raved about them especially eating them warm. It's the best scone recipe I've come across.

Definitely chill the dough a few minutes before shaping the disks, otherwise it might be too soft and sticky to work with. Also, I shaped the disks on floured waxed paper, then inverted one disk onto the other - it was easier that way.

Each time I make this, I and my guests are delighted! I've made it as written and have made my own variations: blackberry jam & sugared almonds, marionberry jam & pecans, and strawberry jam with lightly salted macademias...each time it is superb; we usually use our fruit jams that we've made the summer prior, which is why the flavors are so varied. Do experiment w/ the recipe as it is a wonderful "base" from which to start finding your own combinations. One note: I've found the scones stay together better if you make 2 flat disks (cookie size), dollop the jam on the bottom one, then press disks together carefully and chill in plastic wrap until ready to bake.

I have made these scones many times and never once had a complaint. The people at work can't get enough of them. Really pretty easy to make.

I was looking for something dainty for a lady's tea. Following the advice of the Jersey cook, I cut out 2.5 inch circles with a biscuit cutter and put each scone together individually. Put a dollup of preserves (1 tsp, about) in the center of each, and used a smidge of water to seal the edges. Labor Intensive? Yup. Worth Every Minute? Absolutely. They were light, flaky and delicious, with no jelly leakage!

My Family loves these scones! I made adjustments = 1 stick of butter, pre-packaged hazelnuts with husks on already chopped so you just toast them for a few minutes. I mix all the nuts in and I only make two rounds, cut into 8 wedges with sharp knife, brush with cream & top with raw sugar, bake on parchment for 20 minutes. Taste is incredible, flaky & rich. EASY to make! I used my kitchen aid on slowest speed to mix butter in and cream. If you chill dough in bowl for 15 or so minutes I think they come out better. :)

I replaced the hazelnuts with finely chopped dired apricots and made 6 scones (12 balls divided by 2 layers per scone) and they turned out fantastic! I like the scones big so these were the perfect size. Also, instead of sprinkling hazelnuts at the end, I use raw sugar which gave a nice crunch and sweetness at the end.

Rating: 3
I had the same problem as the other reviews with the preserves coming out during baking, but it tasted delicious! Next time, I will make 12 separate balls and flaten each and put the preserves in the middle and bake. They will be ALOT more presentable while tasting as good as they did!!

I can't understand all of the middling reviews - these are fabulous scones and I make scones all the time. I made these New Year's morning and everyone raved. I used a silpat mat so the jam leaked but it didn't burn (just use a bit less and add more jam once the scones are cooked.) Also, I have tried to cut down the butter and they don't taste the same so use all of it. Trader Joes carries finely chopped hazelnuts which are perfect and cut down on the labor. A highly recommended recipe!

This was one of the best and easiest scone recipies I have ever made. The scone was tender with a crunchy crust just watch out for jam running out. The best part is you can make it the night before and bake it in the morning.

I had opposite problems. My hazelnuts overpowered the scones, and the preserves you could barely taste. My dough came out more like a tart than a scone and they never puffed. I did like the taste of the hazelnuts, but it was definitely not worth the work involved to make them.

Same thing that happened to Omaha happened to me. I think there is a bit too much of preserves and I will cut on it if I do it another time. I thought overall they were okay but they are not the most tasty thing I have ever done.

I made these over Christmas for my family and they all loved them.

I had trouble with this recipe. Though I sealed the edges of the dough as instructed, preserves leaked out when I cut the rounds into wedges. This was very messy, and the preserves burned when the scones baked, giving them an unpleasant scorched flavor. Any suggestions from those who made these successfully?

Amazing!! Great recipe for doing ahead. I substituted walnuts for hazelnuts which were very, very good. Texture and flavor of these scones are sensational and they were a huge hit with everyone on Christmas. Wouldn't mind having these EVERY day.

yummy. I called them Linzer Scones. I prepared them the night before and baksed them the morning we opened our Xmas Presents. My 15 month old danced when he saw them in a basket on the coffee table and they kept my three year old sustained through 2.5 hours (but just 2 toys worth + a lot of playing) on Xmas morning.
