I made this with the proportions listed in the recipe - except I used 6 TB of ghee instead of 8 as suggested by another reviewer. It was still way to oily for me. Might try it again with even less or might not. . .

Reminds me of mom; love the aromas. Only used 4 eggs and didn't use any flour, came out fine. I also cook it stove top all the way through, I like the crispy edges it makes.

I have not been to Iran, nor do I know much about Persian food, so I speak with little authority in terms of authenticity, but I can say that this recipe is fantastic. I might cut back to 6 tablespoons of butter instead of 8, though. Half a cup is a whole whole lot. I mail ordered spices specifically to make this dish and it was absolutely worth it.

I prefer the traditional fried style. This works in a pinch though and is yummy! Popular at a party I brought it to.
