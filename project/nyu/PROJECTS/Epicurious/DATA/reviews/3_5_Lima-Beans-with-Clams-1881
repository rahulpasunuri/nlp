I used fresh local lima beans (added just after the wine), substituted shrimp for clams, and served over pasta ... very tasty.

I thought this recipe was outstanding! It seemed so simple I wasn't expecting more than a quick, tasty dish with ingredients I happened to have on hand. It turned out to be good enough that I would serve this to company, yet also healthy enough that I would make this for dinner any night of the week. I served it over whole wheat pasta and it was a delicious, filling meal.

Very good! I subed shrimp for the clams, used a can of crushed tomatoes and added 1t of thyme. It was excellent!

I found this recipe by accident and was so intrigued by the ingredients I just had to make it. The recipe itself is a bit confusing- it doesn't tell you what to do with the garlic (I sauteed it with the onions and bay leaf at the beginning, which seemed logical). Also, it's a bit vague on when to add the lima beans. Having said that, it does create a very tasty dish. And there is a delicious broth that cries out to be sopped up with a big hunk of crusty bread. A very filling, relatively easy dish.
