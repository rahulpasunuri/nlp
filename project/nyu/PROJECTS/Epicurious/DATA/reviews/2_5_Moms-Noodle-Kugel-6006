It seems to me that some of the reviewers did not read the recipe carefully. The salt is added to the water in which the noodles are cooked, not to the dish itself. Only 1/8 teaspoon additional salt is called for (basically, a pinch). Also, the directions clearly state that 1 1/2 cups of noodles are to be cooked in boiling, salted water. Why would one cook noodles in boiling water if they are already cooked? Although we might modify ingredients to suit family tastes, this is a good basic recipe. It is, after all, a sweet kugel. Complaining that it isn't a savory kugel, seems inappropriate. The optional ingredients allow for individual preferences, but it will always be a sweet kugel.

I LOVE KUGEL

I found it overly salty. I would only put in a dash of salt. I've had much better kugel.

I would make this recipe again but I would add more noodles. Recipe did not specify whether the 1 1/2 cups of noodles was cooked or not before measuring. I would definately use 1 1/2 cups cooked noodles.

I wouldn't make this particular dish again or even in the first place. It is definitely not rich enough. I love Jewish cooking, although I am not jewish. I have broken bread and thrilled to many prayers sent up in Hebrew sitting at my best friends' table. Wife and husband. How sweet is the memory. He is dead and I don't know where she is anymore. All my Jewish friends favored Kugel and the wonderful raisins and noodles and butter and eggs and spices, hmmmm how wonderful. But you know how it is, to each his own. I like the really rich, good stuff.

This is what I call comfort food.

My family loves kugel, but we do not eat the sweet version. In fact, we wouldn't even consider it. In recent days I have adapted my mother's version to make it lower in cholesteral. It doesn't quite hold together as well as the original, but it is taste- not presentation that we want. I use no- yolk egg noodles, an egg substitute and low fat cottage cheese. Basically boil a bag of noodles and drain. Add 1/4 cup. veg. oil, 8 oz cottage cheese, 2 fake eggs, some dill, onion powder to taste, tbs. salt and pepper. use your clean hands to blend together. Put in Pyrex baking pan (sprayed with PAM) and bake 45- 1 hour @ 400 degrees.

While the concept is OK, the amounts are very imprecise. What exactly does 1 1/2 cups noodles mean? Also, this will never work with just one egg.

I love kugel,its a comfort food that reminds me of my grandmother, mama Grossman. I don't think cottage cheese or sour cream should be optional, just part of the dish. I have made it adding cream cheese to to above and it makes it even creamier!
