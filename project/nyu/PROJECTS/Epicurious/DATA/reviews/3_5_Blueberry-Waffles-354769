So tasty! I made as stated except used straw instead of blueberries. Has a lot of great things in it. Try it!

I have a great non-stick waffle iron that I usually don't need any oil for...the veggie oil spray is a must for each waffle. The blueberries really stick in there otherwise. Made pretty much exactly to recipe specs except I used 2 whole eggs rather than just the whites. Put whole flax seeds and rolled oats in my spice grinder to get the different flours. Hearty and filling. Makes you feel healthy while eating waffles :)

Sounds Delicious I am 13 yrs old and planning to surprise my parents with a nice waffle breakfast.from my experience,the waffles are generally better if the batter has been made the night before,ready for that morning.I am wonderin whether this recipe is the same or whether I could make say,2 hrs in advance.

Such a great base recipe for a fabulous blueberry waffle. I actually didn't have oat or flax, but I used a cup of finely ground almonds instead. Also used chopped pecans instead of walnuts. Served with organic raw honey. So good!

Without any question, this is the best waffle I ever had. We like our pancakes and waffles to have a hearty taste and this recipe nails it perfectly. I did not have oat flour so I ground oat meal and that seemed to work just fine. It is a healthy breakfast item and works out to 380 calories and 8 grams of fiber and 6 grams of sugar.

These waffles are amazing. I added 2 tbsp of cane sugar. I didn't have oat flour, so I put some old fashioned oats in the food proccesor and pulsed until fine. I also put my blueberries in the food processor and pulsed 2 or 3 times. Your batter will be purple, but the waffles will come out nice and brown. I served with honey, fruit, and whipped cream.
