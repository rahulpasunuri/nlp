We had just been peach-picking, so I found this recipe to use up some of the peaches fresh. (The rest I made preserves with, which I used as the preserves in the recipe.) I love the light, healthy aspect of this dish. We served it with grilled chicken. Great for summer, when you want something cool. Will definitely make again.

Love this recipe for an easy and quick salsa to serve with tortilla chips or over fresh salmon. I roasted the red pepper for that added smoky flavor. Also, didn't have any peach preserves and used my favorite bbq sause and some maple syrup to round out the flavors. Delicious Make extra and take some to your next dinner host for a special gift:)

I LOVE this recipe!!! I did not have any apricot preserve, so just threw in a ts. of a sweet jelly I had.... Worked terrifically!!!!

I've made this salsa twice now, and people love it, though the first time some wished it was spicier. The second time I used a tablespoon of bottled chipotle sauce, half a jalapeno chile, minced, the juice of a whole lime, and no jam. That went over really well with the folks who weren't keen on the sweetness first time around with the jam. Didn't peel the peaches, either.

I made this recipe as written, but didn't have time to add the cilantro. I thought it was just ok.

Used Japanese white peaches in season and it matched very well. Will have to try the US peaches next time.

I love this recipe! I make it as soon as peaches come into season. This weekend I wanted to make it but couldn't find any yellow peaches so I used white this time. I added more lime juice and a bit more preserves. It was fine, but the yellow have SO MUCH more flavor. I always get so many compliments when I make this.

I used raspberry preserves instead of apricot and added a few splashes of tabasco for kick. The end result was a tasty and refreshing salsa.

Enjoyed the recipe at recent BBQ. Last minute change to add Italian dressing for extra flavor.

Mmmmm. Lovely. I'm making it for the third time in a week. Fruit in season; I imagine it might be not so good out of season, perhaps the reason why some reviewers were less than impressed. I also used raspberry chipotle sauce once instead of apricot preserves (check out the zuni wraps recipe for details) and that was excellent too.

Wonderful, yummy salsa. I served it with tortilla chips tonight and couldn't get enough. I think it will pair well with blackened fish in the future. Definitely let it sit and meld before serving (as instructed) to allow the flavors to blend.

eh, this was okay. I was disappointed after reading the enthusiastic reviews; plus, I'm a HUGE peach salsa w/ chipotle fan. My boyfriend really liked it (served it on pan-seared swordfish), though, so maybe it was better than I'm giving it credit for. Still, it's something I doubt I'd make again.

Not vile, but not very good, either. I think my chile might have been a bit on the strongish side, since even the most heat-tolerant Texans at my party exploded into flames. I will not make it again. As one native Texan attending my fest simply announced "That ain't Salsa"

Absolutely delicious - have made this with both seafood and chicken, and has never failed me. Made with nectarines instead of peaches ... mmmm, yummy!

I haven't even tried this recipe yet, but it caught our eye when roaming over the site. Sounds great - and my fiance had the suggestion that, for, say, a potluck or a home party, slicing large roma tomatoes in half lengthwise, scooping out and reserving the pulp for other uses and filling the "shells" with this salsa mix would be a great presentation.

I have made this salsa twice and will make it again. It's perfect for this time of year because of the fresh ingredients that are available. I served it with grilled pork chops and also chicken. I'm going to try it with seafood next since so many others have liked it that way. I've had requests from friends for the recipe. A real hit!

Great salsa as is. And all the veggie and herb ingredients are ripe for picking in the yard. Use this recipe as a guide to experiment with other fruit salsas. Fresh mint almost always helps (good for the reviewer who doesn't like cilantro). For my taste I like adding a finely minced habanero (there are hundreds in my garden this time of year) for crazy, but citrusy, heat. A great complement to the peach. SURGICAL GLOVES ARE A MUST FOR HABANEROS. The only thing worse than the pain of removing a contact lens with capsacin-covered fingers is, after an excruciatingly blinding hour...you need to remove the second lens! Heck, I use the gloves even picking the peppers.

Very nice recipe for summertime. I used it with whole red snapper which I grilled. Lovely. I would have liked a bit more spice so I'll use more peppers next time.

Made this for dinner with friends one evening and then brought to Syrah wine tasting next day. Served it in butter lettuce leaves. Got rave reviews. Had to make some substitutions: Used really ripe nectarines instead of peaches. Used bottled roasted red peppers - had on-hand, and added some tiny "santa" tomato. Used 10 shakes of tobasco chipotle sauce which worked just fine - for those who cannot find adobo. Yum! 6 people asked for recipe.

Absolutely wonderful. A great use of abundant peaches and cucumbers in August. I served over quinoa with grilled shrimp, and the grilled shrimp were practically ignored because everyone was more interested in the peach salsa and quinoa!

Update: made this to accompany the salmon with horseradish. Despite having really flavorless peaches (amazing at this time of year!), it was a wonderful complement. The combination of sweet/cool/spicy is great with grilled fish. (To those using gloves with the chipotles, be cautious if you purchase latex ones: many people are very allergic to this, and using them in cooking could provoke a reaction. As mentioned by others, make sure the chilies are canned chipotles in adobo, not fresh ones.

For the cook from Hempstead with the leftover chilis, you can freeze them individually on waxed paper, then store until you need them. Then try the Black Bean, Yellow Pepper and Cumin Chili from this site in the fall! Also, I recommend mixing the lime juice, chilis and apricot preserves before you add to the salsa. Otherwise, it's delish! Made it twice, once substituting nectarines and basil -- just as good!

Just like the cook from Bergen County, I served this with scallops and rice and it ws DELICIOUS!! I used 3 tablespoons of Polaner Apricot All Fruit, everything else I used the instructed amount. I found it very easy to cut up the chipolte, just use a fork to take it out of the can and hold it down, then just slice it! I now have a whole entire can of them though that I dont know what to do with. This salsa recipe is amazing.

Very good combination of flavors. I used fresh peaches I got at the farmer's market. I also added a jabernero chili to the recipe. This made it much spicier but my boyfriend loved it. Served with grilled Mahi Mahi.

This is SO good! I made it to use with grilled salmon. I am not a pepper fan so I just eliminated the chipotles altogether. I'm adding this to my favorite Salsa recipes--It is so fresh and refreshing!

Delicious! I don't understand the people having trouble with burning hands due to the chipotle chili. You open the can, use a fork to get one out, place on cutting board, smash with knife, scrape into bowl. I freeze leftover chipotles individualy on a plate & once frozen, put them in a container & take out what I need.

You can rub a little olive oil on your fingers tips before you cutting hot peppers. It will then wash off.

I am not a tomato salsa fan, so this is a definite find! I've served it with toasted pita triangles, with grilled fish, with barbecued meat, with grilled tofu. I've even had it with with just plain rice. It's a great recipe! And so pretty too with the reds, greens, and yellows.

I'm sorry, I just had to get my 2 cents worth in. I know this is a recipe review and not a lesson in medicine - but some of you seem to be concerned about sodium intake. Sodium and obesity really have nothing to do with each other. Too much sodium can cause water retention, which is just that - water. If you cut down on sodium, you may lose some water weight - once again, only water - not fat. I also believe that sodium does not necessarily CAUSE hypertension. However, if you already are hypertensive, sodium can definitely exacerbate the condition and should be avoided. And yes, I agree, unless it's a genetic thing, exercise and dietary modification are really the only ways to lose weight. . . . OK, so shoot me down for not trying the recipe!!! But I do intend to.

Maybe Pat Boyle is saying that people eat too much sodium, which causes them to retain a lot of water and therefore makes them obese? Sorry, but I'm with the cook from Missouri on this one!

I haven't made this yet but it looks so good! To the cook from Long Island: I had the same burning hands sensation once after chopping jalopenos. I had to stop cooking, it was so intense. Everyone I mentioned it to thought I was making it up. I actually went to bed that night with ice packs on my hands. Very Weird.

To Pat Boyle: Two tablespoons of this salsa has only 1 mg. of sodium. Aside from genetics, there are two reasons for obesity: overeating and lack of exercise.

This is very delicious. I would definitely make this again but I would probably put only 1 tablespoon of apricot preserves. It was too sweet. Also be carefully handling the chipotle chiles. My hands actually were burning for an hour after I chopped them.

My husband was crazy about this dish and ate most of it himself. I thought it was good but not great and would probably have given it just two forks if not for my husband. The next time I make it I will use a very small dice--maybe 1/4-1/3inch. I also think it may be better tasting (but less colorful)if the cucumber was peeled first.

Rating: 3
Delicious and beautiful to look at as well. I used only 1T of jam-it was enough, my nectarines were very sweet. I also upped the chipotles,again to contrast with the sweet of the fruit. Loved it over grilled fish. Letting it sit for an hour or two in the fridge really brought taste and texture together.I will be making this salsa again,for sure!

Rating: 0
To Pat Boyle: Sodium has been implicated as a possible cause of hypertension but there is no evidence suggesting it is reponsible for obesity.In this recipe cutting back on the chipoltes would reduce sodium, other ingredients have only trace. You could therefore judge the sodium content by reading the chipolte chili can. I do agree that in general, it would be good for recipes to include sodium in the nutritional content list.

I'm probably going to try this because it sounds great. However,like many people,I am on heavy medications that cause retention of fluids. I also believe sodium is causing a lot of our nation's obesity. Sure wish you'd include sodium counts in your recipes.
