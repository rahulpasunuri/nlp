substituted pork medallions and WOW! This is fantastic. Certainly not low in fat but even my wife who is very fat conscious loved it. The medallions were wonderful on their own but with the sauce! We will make this again and again.

I don't know exactly why this recipe is so good, it just is. I made it per the recipe except that I did not have fine dry bread crumbs so omitted and they weren't missed. I bought thin sliced chicken breasts and they were perfect. The capers really make this.

THANK GOODNESS FINALLY FOR A TRUE RECIPE.

The flavor of the chicken was a little bland, I found, when making it the first time, as was the sauce. I added a pinch of sugar to the latter and that made a huge difference. But - when I made it a second time, I added an extra dipping ingredient for the chicken cutlets - lemon juice (fresh). The procedure was as follows: dip cutlets in lemon juice and allow to sit for about ten minutes; then into the seasoned flour (added more pepper than the recipe calls for), beaten egg, then breadcrumbs. They rested in the refrigerator briefly while the oil and butter melted to a sizzle, then were browned nicely. The addition of the lemon juice made all the difference in the world. I served the chicken with buttered broad egg noodles with poppy seeds and fresh parsley, and a crisp cucumber salad with a lemon/sour cream dressing (to which a pinch of sugar was added). The capers were deep-fried until they exploded into little 'flowers', and sprinkled over the chicken. Lemon wedges finished the dish - it was delicious and pretty.

Not bad, nothing spectacular. I also added lemon juice to deglaze the pan before adding the capers and parsley. Definitely needs salt and pepper. I forgot to put in the fridge for 10 minutes, but it didn't seem to matter. Not a bad recipe but needs tweeking.

Ok, would probably actually give it 3.5 stars since I did have to modify the sauce a tiny bit to make it absolutely perfect. For some reason, I've had it in my mind that I loved capers, and have had a jar of them sitting in the fridge unused for the last 2 months, because I didn't know exactly what to use them with. This recipe works very well. Don't try to cut corners by failing to "roll out" the chicken breasts. Even if you don't have a proper rolling pin, stick the breasts in a plastic bag and gently smash/flatten out with something heavy (I used a heavy can of pears for the "smashing/rolling"--but please don't actually open the canned pears to use in this recipe!!) Even if the chicken breast falls apart from the "flattening" a bit it's ok--This tenderizes the chicken and "mangles" it somewhat--(mangle a bad-sounding word I know but it gives the chicken breast a rougher surface area for the yummy egg/bread crumbs to cling to...) Anyway, the only problem was as I was finishing things and tasted the butter/caper sauce the recipe recommends-- a bit too bland, even with the capers, for heavy breaded food! I remembered some of the other comments I read here and threw in some whole-grain mustard, lemon juice, a corner of a chicken buoillion cube, and wee bit of water and flour in addition to the herbs, to make more of a substantial sauce. Served the chicken schnitzel with some roasted potatoes/carrots and a greens salad, with the caper sauce poured over everything--fantastic!! Also, this recipe, although it sounds time-consuming, (different bowls of flour, egg yolk, bread crumbs...) was actually quick to do, and a refreshing change from the usual...also one of the few meals I've made at home ever that didn't seem to need garlic (love garlic though I do...)

Will definitely make again. My family loves this type of chicken. I would probably add squeezed lemon juice to the butter, capers, and parsley in the pan and I think I'd like to add dijon mustard to the egg dip next time. Otherwise very good with chicken tenderloins.

Did not find this recipe notable, however I did not have Panko and used breadcrumbs. Thought the resulting crust was too heavy for the dish. Will try it again with Panko..

Did not have bread crumbs so crushed a cup of saltine crackers. Was very good, tender and juicy. Nice flavor! My family of 5 gives it a thumbs up!

This was our first try at this recipe, therefore, we did not deviate. We found the recipe very easy to follow. The results was a very impressive meal. We will certainly make this again, but will experiment somewhat.

The chicken turned out OK, nothing fancy, though I had added a touch of garlic powder, paprika and white pepper to the flour, and the caper sauce was so-so...maybe I had too much oil left in the skillet. It was too greasy.

Quick & easy to make -- the three step process to bread the chicken, along with the short wait, made for a coating that adhered to the chicken. I agree with the other poster about deglazing the pan with white wine -- next time around I'll do just that.

I used regular chicken breasts which took a little longer to fry, but they were delicious. My husband just raved about the meal. It will be a regular at our house.

Easy and elegant,and the whole family enjoyed it. I added a little white wine to the pan to deglaze it after browning the chicken, and then added the capers, butter and parsley. This also gave me some additional sauce to pour over the cutlets.

This dish was very good. I really enjoyed it; so did my family. I also accompianed it with a side of garlic mashed potatoes, and some Chardonnay..It was great!!!!
