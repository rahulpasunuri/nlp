This is the absolute BEST dessert recipe I make. Whenever strawberries (or any other type of berry for that matter) is in season, my husband and kids insist I make this recipe. I'm not a fan of brandy for the sauce, so I just add extra vanilla (but if you love brandy, by all means go for it, I'm sure you'll love it). In addition, I have been known to make small individual biscuits for ease of service (but I don't change the recipe... ever).

I made the shortcake in the 9" pan, but then cut it into wedges for individual servings. The chocolate sauce just makes this recipe the most beautiful looking dessert! I don't think I'll ever have strawberry shortcake again without the chocolate sauce on it!

Followed the recipe except used a combination of blueberries and strawberries. This is an excellent dessert! I like that the chocolate sauce can be served separately in case, can you imagine?, you have guests who don't like chocolate.

The flavor combination is wonderful. There will be no leftovers with this dessert. Followed the recipe as written.

I had a flat of strawberries to use (didn't want to freeze)- and wanted a chocolate recipe. This fit the bill and then some!!! I used bittersweet chocolate, followed the recipe (except I put a layer of the chocolate sauce on the bottom shortcake instead of on top of the strawberries)- made the whipped cream on top into a layer (instead of 'dollops')- took it over to the neighbors and had RAVE reviews!!! The dessert was perfect in taste and presentation. I made the chocolate sauce and biscuit the day ahead (and had no problem cutting biscuit). Will make again when I have strawberries!!!!

Excellent shortcake! I think the buttermilk is what makes it. You can halve the chocolate sauce and add a little almond extract to it. For flair add a tablespoon of Orange Extract to the strawberries. Dash the plated dish with ground Cinammon. Very simple to make. You can make the shortcake part and the chocolate sauce a day ahead.

this is a super recipe, one of the best desserts i have ever made i think. i doubled the chocolate chips in the shortcake, and then you dont need nearly as much sauce in the end, i would halve the sauce recipe the next time i make this. everything else was perfect. it was great when it was first made, but still pretty good the next day for leftovers.

This is an excellent recipe. And extra chocolate in the biscuits doesn't hurt anything...As usual, I was in a hurry and glanced at recipe and saw the 6 oz. of chocolate for the sauce -- and put 6 oz. of chocolate into the biscuits instead of 3 oz. I didn't realize it until I was later making the sauce. The biscuits were still great (can you ever have too much chocolate? I don't think so...). I used bittersweet chocolate, and I wouldn't recommend using chocolate any sweeter than that. I also made individual biscuits in a muffin tin rather than one large biscuit--I ended up with nine of them. I think that you could make 10 or 12 biscuits in muffin tins and still have a generous serving size. This is a fabulous recipe--everyone in my book group loved it.

I'm not a fan of strawberry shortcake but everyone else seems to love it. So I gave this recipe a try. I'm still not a fan. My guests seemed to like it well enough but I won't be making it again.

Yummy! LOVED the taste and textures, BUT had a hard time slicing through the biscuit once the dessert was assembled, and each guest's serving looked messy. Like the idea of individual biscuits, so that the presentation is pretty, and so when the guest puts his/her fork in it, and it topples, well, then.. it looked good when served! I used Callebaut bittersweet chocolate, and kept the chunks large!

Making the one big biscuit was easier and the presentation was very impressive. But the dish was disappointing because the shortcake was too sweet. What really makes a strawberry shortcake for me is tasting the contrast of salty and sweet in the same bite. I even lessened the sugar and increased the salt but it wasn't enough. I'm going back to plain i.e. unsweet biscuits for future strawberry shortcakes.

My favorite shortcake recipe... I made this in individual shortcake scones and served with whipped cream and fresh strawberries and blueberries (for the Fourth of July). Leaving out the fudge sauce and using whipped cream instead really lightens the dish for the summertime. The shortcake is also a great base for scones-- another time, I took out the chocolate and added dried cranberries and lots of orange zest and the result was an incredible scone for breakfast!

SINFUL-- how can one go wrong with chocolate and strawberries? everyone loves this recipe and it makes for a beautiful, decadent variation on a classic summer favorite. good presentation--- try it for a party.

I have made this numerous times around the fourth of July. It is a very festive dish that takes advantages of the seasonal produce. How can you go wrong with pairing chocolate and strawberries?!? Very delicious recipe.

Very, very good. I made individual "biscuits" (they looked more like scones,actually) and served them halved, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream instead of the whipped cream,topped with the strawberries and drizzled the chocolate sauce on top of them. Delicious combination of flavors. Be sure to use good bittersweet chocolate, it's a perfect compliment to this. I'll definitely be making this one again!

Very good and easy to make, I made it for my significant other's birthday and our friends loved it. It was a great birthday cake. We ate the leftover's the next day and it was even better. After letting it sit overnight and become cold it was easier to cut and handle.

This was great!! It's nice for a change. Very easy for my 5 year old to help. She was really proud of herself. My 2-year old kept mmmming! I will make this again. Try it! I only had semi-sweet chocolate, but I bet it is even better with bitter-sweet. YUMMY!!!!

I started making this recipe at 9:30 at night and finished 1 1/2 hours later. I know you're not supposed to eat two hours before you go to bed, but it was well worth it. My husband and I loved the shortcake -- the combination of sweet biscuit and melting chocolate bits is simply divine! -- and the chocolate sauce is to die for! (I accidentally added one extra tablespoon of whisky -- didn't have brandy -- but I think it could actually use more!) Next time I make this I'll probably do the chocolate sauce a day ahead and reheat it when I serve the dessert. Don't let the 1 1/2 hours scare you -- this dessert is sure to impress!

YUMMM! This is a great strawberry shortcake. The shortcake will be pale when it comes out of the oven, but don't worry-- it will be covered with whipped cream. Be sure to let the shortcake cool COMPLETELY, or it will slip and slide.

This was great especially with the wonderful strawberries in season right now. I was alittle short on time so I used reddi-whip for the whipped cream. It was still a hit!

I have made this twice to rave reviews--for my parents and my boyfriend. The bittersweet chocolate is better. Try to use better quality chocolate. It fell apart a bit, but who cares--the sauce and whipped cream covered it up and it tasted heavenly!

I've been making this for years and it always gets raves. If you have leftover choclate sauce, let it chill and use it for chocolate truffle insides. They're excellent!

A splendid update of an old favorite, this dessert is attractive, delicious, impressive. It has several steps for each part to be assembled, but each is simple and uses readily available ingredients. I make it for my family as well as special occasions...regularly...and my waistline shows it!

I made this yesterday for Easter, it was great! I did the dough in my food processor, then made individual biscuits instead of one big one. I also used both bananas and strawberries (my kids won't eat the latter)- both are great with chocolate!! I served them split open with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream, then the fruit, then the sauce drizzled over. I propped the tops on the side. Very pretty presentation; definitely worth doing again.

Made this for Easter and everyone loved it. Since some of our guests can't eat strawberries, we divided the shortcake into wedges first, then sliced horizontally. We then made individual servings - some w/strawberries and the others w/bananas. Regardless of the type of fruit, everyone raved about it. We certainly will add this to our files as a great dessert for entertaining!

Absolutely fabulous!! Well worth the effort-- although I found it to be quite easy, despite all the ingredients. I made this for a summer picnic and it was a tremendous success. This makes a show-stopping presentation and tastes even better! A real keeper!!

FABULOUS!!! The chocolate bits were a great addition to an old favorite. The chocolate sauce just made it wonderfully decadent. The surprise was how great it was the next day. I expected a gooey mess......it wasn't as pretty but it tasted JUST as good. The shortcake was still crumbly. I regret to admit that I gobbled up the left overs for breakfast....what a way to go!! This is a SURE FIRE winner!

I made this shortcake for a group of 12 women. I thought it would be a terrific summer desert. I was met with great reviews. They all loved it. The presentation is so beautiful and colorful. I can't wait to make it again.

The chocolate pieces in the shortcake add a wonderful texture and flavor to the cake. The overall layers of whipped cream, strawberries, chocolate and cake make it an impressive presentation. I add some chocolate dipped strawberries (the biggest I can find) on the side. Easy to make two or three cakes for a large group.

I fixed this for my girlfriend on Valentines Day, and it was so incredible that we haven't stopped talking about it! THe shortcake/biscuit was divine-crumbly and moist, just perfect! I used Kirshwasser in the chocolate sauce and the strawberries to add a little pop! Wonderful dessert!
