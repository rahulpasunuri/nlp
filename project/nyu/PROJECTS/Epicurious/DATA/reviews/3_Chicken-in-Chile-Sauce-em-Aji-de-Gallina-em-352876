I read a number of the other comments before making this recipe. I was somewhat concerned that only 33% of people would make the recipe again, but I decided to forge ahead anyway. I'm so glad I did! I haven't made much South American food before, so I don't have any clue if this was authentic or not--as many of the other cooks say. However, I found this dish, and especially the sauce, to be really great weeknight dish that is a nice break from the regular chicken dinner. I'm so glad I had a lot of extra sauce left over--we've been putting it on everything all week. I'll definitely make this again.

ok, the ingredients are the right ones but the preparation of this recipe is a little off from the authentic one. The chicken is suppose to be boiled and shredded and it get combined with the sauce made with the aji paste, bread, cheese, etc. The presentation is not the correct one. It cannot be called Peruvian because it does not represent the authenticity of such a popular recipe.

The traditional aji de gallina sauce is very similar to this, however the chicken is shredded into the sauce and is served over sliced potatoes. the olives and egg are arranged over top and it is served with rice.

This recipe should definitely not be called aji de gallina. The true recipe requires calls for shredding chicken or hen mixed in with the spicy sauce at the very end and simmered together for 5-10 min with chopped walnuts and parm cheese added at the very end. In Peru it is always accompanied with sliced boiled white potatoes, chicken eggs (never quail or hummingbird) and botija olives although kalamatas will do. This can also be served with white rice.

I'm not too sure this is authentic but it was delicious. I'll keep the recipe, that's for sure.I've been to Peru, frequent a Peruvian restaurant in the ATL and had ají de gallina made by a Peruvian friend. This seems different but worth eating. The sauce was lovely and nutty. My roommate and I really enjoyed it. I used a honey wheat bread and fat free milk and that didn't seem to harm the taste. I also cut the recipe down because I'm cooking for two, that also worked out well.

Could somebody delete this recipe? this it's not ajie de gallina at all, is embarrassing the real one, and walnuts? is nutmeg not walnut. After read this give me a big headache. is disgusting how people try to made experiments with proper food, this should call embarrassing ajie de gallina or fake chiken, and what have to do rice and lentils? you can companion with potato or white rice. adios

This sounds interesting, but is NOT ají de gallina. The real deal is with shreded hen or chicken and you cannot put in the chile and the soaked bread bread at the same time, chile has to cook...

In Peru, the traditional recipe calls for quartered or sliced regular hard-boiled eggs. They are used for decoration and some texture once the dish is served. Quail eggs make a nice decoration too, but they are 100% optional.

I believe they have them at Whole Foods.

And what you had in Lima and Cuzco was nothing compared with what I had in Macchu Picchu. There they used humming bird eggs.
