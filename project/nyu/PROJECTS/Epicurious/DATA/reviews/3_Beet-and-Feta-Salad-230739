I used fresh roasted beets, asparagus,peppered feta, and toasted pine nuts with the dressing. Served it over baby Romaine. My family agreed that we could eat this salad daily...Lovely! I also added a little bit of lemon zest to the dressing. Next time I might add a few thin slices of red onion for a little kick. Another option is to substitute orange juice for the lemon. Just a thought.

I used this recipe as a starting point for what turned out to be a great salad! Here were my modifications: I used fresh baby beets, doubled the feta, added a minced, hard boiled egg, added raw pine nuts and substituted organic pea shoots for microgreens. Fabulous!

Maybe it was the canned beets, but this salad didn't have the kick it should of with these ingrediants, yet at the same time the beets and feta overwhelmed the greens.
