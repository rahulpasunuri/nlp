Wow, this is spicy! My lips burned for hours but it is addicting, none of us could stop eating it. I added a can of rinsed Black Beans and cooked Brown Rice at the end. As others said, use less peppers for less heat or dollop with sour cream. Meat was so tender and delicious!

After reading the review/comments, I only used 3 chipoltes instead of the 5-7 it called for, and I de-seeded them. I'd say it was a low-medium level of "heat" and I will use 4 next time. I used a Lagunitas pale ale for the beer. Tasted pretty yummy. Garnished with a dollop of sour cream, some diced avocado & a sprig of cilantro. I'm going to add some beans and cilantro into my next batch & see what it's like using Guinness instead.

If you need your sinuses cleaned out, this is a keeper! It was way too spicy! I would love to make it again with a less spicy pepper and possibly make my own adobo sauce so I can better control the spice. I used this stew in two ways. I took out half of the meat and juice and mixed it with a sweeter milder barbeque sauce. I allowed this to continue cooking on med-low until the meat fell apart and used it for pulled pork sandwiches. It was a hit. For the other half, I left it as is and used it in tacos. Sour cream and cheese help cut the spice. I can't imagine eating something this hot as a stew as recommended.

This recipe was quick and easy to prepare. I do wish I had read the other reviews before making it because it was rather spicy. This was my first time cooking with Chipotle peppers and I had no idea how spicy they were. It was still delicious though!

Like everyone else, I thought this was delicious but way TOO HOT. I had to drink milk while I was eating it just to keep my mouth from going numb. Aside from that, I added cubed butternut squash for the last half hour of cooking, just to add a bit of sweetness. If I make it again I will definitely cut the number of peppers in half. Maybe add some sour cream or other dairy product to cut the spiciness a bit.

AMAZING!! Will definitely be making again.

Wow, this was the first thing I made from a recipe I searched here and this is a winner! I too made the mistake of using 7 peppers. Thankfully I tasted the stew 30 minutes in, and quickly removed them. I also added pinto beans and a can of tomato sauce. The result is that this is now my favorite chili recipe. SO good! I plan to try with grilled chicken and may also first slow smoke a pork shoulder and use that meat instead of browning it.

To maintain the spice/flavor and reduce the "heat", used roasted passilla peppers. Made a sauce of tomatillos, peppers, onions & garlic. Added after the beer dissipated and simmered another hour or so. Yum. Pork fell apart, many layers accented with recommended avacado, cilantro and lime wedge. Had the audacity to serve it to pozole afficianados and they love it. Give it a go!

As most people said, this was delicious, but very hot. All four people served love spicy foods, and thought it could do with a little less heat. Will definitely make again with maybe only 3- 4 peppers.

The first time I made this I went over the 7 peppers called for because some of them were small, so I felt like I needed to make up for it, and I also figured other people just couldn't hang because I like things spicy. It was insanely hot! This time around I used 3 fairly large ones and 2 tablespoons of sauce. I'm still feeling the heat. I also used two beers and let it simmer longer until the meat just fell apart. It's great topped with cilantro, sour cream, and avocado. I had southern cornbread on the side too. Good stuff!

very very good and easy! used beef broth and a tablespoon of tomato paste in addition to the recipe. also have made this recipe with boneless pork loin and it is just incredible. perfect for a cold day, and also used as the meat for taquitos (along with some tortillas, cheese, guacamole, and beans).

very, very good. I, like other reviewers, only used 4 peppers w/o seeds. I used Sierra Nevada beer. Highly recommended.

From all other reviews I can tell not very many people do it the way the recipe calls for it... I follow the recipe and it came out very tasty and nice!... hot, but nice!... cut back on the Chipotle if you don't like it hot... I used Sam Adams Octoberfest... I'll try again with something sweeter like the Bock or Cream Stout... goes great with corn tortilla chips...

Used boneless pork chops, added chopped garlic and green bell pepper when I sauteed the onions. Added tomato paste and 1cup beef broth for simmering. Also added chili powder and pinch of sugar, reduced cumin to 1 tsp (don't really like cumin and didn't want it to overpower the dish). Made cornbread to balance it out, cold beer to cool off your tongue!! Was a nice balance of hot (I also only used 4 chipotle peppers de-seeded). Would definitely make it again.

I made this for the Superbowl. Tasty! Following some fo the advice of other commenters, I cut back on the chipotles (used four of them, and scraped the seeds out of two. Probably would have scraped the seeds out of all except I forgot until I'd already chopped two up). I also added a small can of tomato paste and a splash of milk (didn't have half-and-half). I used Guinness for the beer and probably used about a can and a half because the liquid kept boiling off. And, I used pork tenderloin because it was what I had on hand. I ended up cooking most of the liquid off, then dumping the pork mixture onto a pile of chips (on a tin-foil-covered baking sheet). I piled shredded monterey jack cheese and salsa on top of that, popped it all under the broiler, and voila! Delicious, smoky chipotle pork nachos! MMMMM.

Loved the flavor of this dish! I made some modifications based on the reviews posted. I also used boneless beef short ribs. Here's what I did- After the onions (and garlic), were caramelized, I added 3 tablespoons of tomato paste then deglazed with Guinness beer. I added 1 cup of beef stock, a few sprigs of thyme, the browned meat, 2 chipolte peppers, adobo sauce, cumin, salt & pepper. I brought everything to a simmer, covered and then placed in a 300 degree oven for 2 hours. This dish had layers of flavor, and also had the perfect amount of heat. Serve with flour tortillas, guacamole, shredded cheddar cheese, red beans & rice. Pair it with your favorite margherita! This was a definite crowd pleaser for Superbowl Sunday!

Super-easy to make and very spicy - just the way I like it but I can see where it would be too much for some. Great the next day in tortillas with some cabbage, onion, cilantro and lime.

Very simple and tasty, however it is way too spicy for me. I will make again w/ less peppers and the seeds removed. I made it with ground pork which was great!

Juicy, tender, flavourful. Easy and just enough spice (but I do like hot food). As stated by other reviewers, you may want to remove the seeds and cut down to half the chipotles for a bit less heat. The longer you leave it simmer, the more tender it becomes (I usually let simmer a few more hours). I continue to try different pork cuts as well as different types of beer - but a consistently yummy recipe.

Wow! I wish I'd had this recipe last time I entered a chili contest! This stew tastes even better as a left-over. Like other reviewers, I halved the amount of chipotle peppers, and it was still plenty hot for this fire-eater. I made cornbread to alongside it the first night, and my husband loved it. Later, I folded the stew into a tortilla with some brown rice and cheddar, and that was superb! The pork shoulder is extremely fatty, so using this stew as a stuffing for peppers or burritos along with rice or beans would be a way to cut back on the saturated fat in one serving.

Bear with me... I could only get my hands on a bone-in pork shoulder. But, it worked as I shredded the pork once it was through braising. I only used 3 chipotle peppers and it was HOT HOT HOT! So, to ease the pain, I threw in a small can of tomato paste & a T. of half & half. Served with a good garlic tuscan bread, a sprinkle of cheddar cheese & dollop of sour cream, it was a winner! I have to remember this recipe for tailgating...

Even using the minimum # of chipotles it was very very spicy. I would recommend halving the suggested amount.

My friends and I loved this except that it was so hot we really couldn't eat it...and I used half the peppers! Although it was too hot to really eat much, my guests did want to take the leftovers home to dilute them into other dishes because the underlying flavor is so good! I will definitely make it again, but with more caution.

Excellent. Seven chipotle peppers made this quite spicy. I stewed it for three hours then served in burritos with pinto beans and cheddar.
