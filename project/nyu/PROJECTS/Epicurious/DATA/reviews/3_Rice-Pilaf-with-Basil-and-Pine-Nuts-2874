Made for my family of 4 plus a guest. Didn't realize that it was only supposed to serve two! Whoops. We thought it was delicious. I added some diced red pepper, along with the onions. I can't wait to make it again! As written, we had no leftovers, for our group of 5.

Both basil and pine nuts are items my family all like, but my grown son and husband did not like them in this dish at all. I thought it was merely OK. Not a "make again" dish for our household.

Nice to even eat on its own!

This rice is delicious and easy. I've made it many times before for many satisfied people. I have also adapted this recipe for use with quinoa instead of rice. Cook the quinoa in the chicken broth and drain once desired texture of quinoa is reached. Then, add onions that have been sauteed ahead of time, and mix in basil and pine nuts. A great substitue for rice.

The first time I made this, we loved it. The leftovers were turned into fried rice the next day. Now, when I make it I make a double batch . . . and we all look forward to having it as the basis for fried rice (add green onion, chopped chicken, and a scrambled egg cut in thin strips. Toss with some soya sauce, heat through. Yummm!)

This was good --not fabulous -- but good. I prepared it once exactly following the recipe, and again adding some chopped sun-dried tomatoes as suggested by another reviewer. I do think this would benefit from some garlic, and the sun-dried tomatoes were a great idea. It just needs a little something else...

This is an excellent recipe and is easy to prepare. I follow the recipe as is and my husband and I really love it. It serves well with chicken, lobster and/or other seafood.

My husband, son, and I all loved this rice dish. I had all the ingredients on hand. I did add finely chopped garlic and added a tsp. or so of chicken boullion to the recipe and used jasmine rice instead of the suggested long grain. This is a keeper and very easy to make!

Excellent. The pine nuts add just the right stuff. Easy, cheap to make, and great tasting to boot. Can't go wrong on this one.

Delicious! So easy and flavorful. It was a great sidedish to complement the mustard chicken recipe on this site.

I LOVE this dish!! My husband, who is the fussiest eater on the planet, said it was fantastic. That's a HUGE compliment! And it's super easy to make.

I found this recipe in Bon Appetit years ago and lost it. I was thrilled to find it on this web site. My family and friends really enjoyed this dish for our summer barbecues. It is a perfect side dish for a main dish with a pungent marinade.

I liked this recipe, but unfortunately, my family didn't like the crunch". I think it can be salvaged by adding a garlic and some parmesan cheese. This feed a family of four, so it makes plenty

Sorry, but no one liked this one. Rather bland and missing something.

I like this very much but found that I like it even more when I steep a few Saffron Threads in the Chicken stock,(homemade is a plus) add a minced clove of garlic about 30 seconds before the rice, and at the end add about a 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan and a teaspoon or so of butter along with the Basil and Pine-nuts. OK so it's a different recipe now. I also like to brown Chicken pieces or Pork Chops, put them aside, prepare the rice then nestle the meat in the rice before covering. When the rice is done remove the meat add the Basil, Cheese, Pine-nuts and Butter. let it sit for a couple minutes then serve on a platter with the meat arranged on top.

Very tasty, visually appealing side dish. I served it with "Opulunt Chicken". Nice complimentary dishes. Tastes good reheated too.

I thought this recipe looked a little plain, so I did a little makeover work and it was excellent. I used 1 leek, 1 shallot, and 1 clove garlic in place of the onion. I also used bulgar wheat in place of the long grain rice. The new recipe was excellent. Rave reviews from everyone!

Really good rice dish. I put in a couple cloves of garlic with the onion, and had it with fish.

It took a lot longer than the recommended time to cook the rice. Decent flavor but nothing I would make again.

I made this for a dinner party and tripled the recipe. I added 1/4 cup of chopped sun dreied tomatoes also and thought added great flavor and pretty color. I was also able to make earlier in the day and reheat right before serving.

For vegetarians, use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. Great dish!

Not only is this dish extremely easy to prepare but it is also delicious. I have a huge rice fetish, and this recipe is one of the tastiest I've ever made.

What a wonderful surprise of different tastes! Very quick and easy and the addition of the basil and pine nuts creates color and texture.
