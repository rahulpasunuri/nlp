This recipe looks intimidating but do not be deterred! We did it at last minute with young "pretreated" turkey with popup timer, only 5 hours in the brine, stuffing separately on the stove while the turkey roasted. Rice required much more than a cup of broth. Reduced the butter for roasting to about 3 T. It was still wonderful. The stuffing would make a great side dish on its own. Susanna Foo is amazing - her 1995 cookbook is one of our favorites. Don't follow the usual wine picks for turkey. This requires a slightly sweet and floral white wine. We had a Gevurtz-Viognier-Pinot Gris blend. Succulent!

Used a 13 pound turkey and prepared according to the recipe. The aroma and flavors were great and this is the first time I have used and understood the five spices in Chinese five spice, which I have used previously as a ground purchased spice. I could not purchase the mace blades locally, but none the less the results were wonderful. If we could rate the stuffing separately I would give it a 3 star. I thought the stuffing was a little bit on the greasy side, which must have been from the Chinese sausage. Still good, but not outstanding. Served with peeled and parboiled sweet potatoes wedges, fresh sage on top and wrapped in Parma prosciutto and finished in the oven. Made a fresh grated carrot and beet cold salad with citrus and fresh ginger dressing. Used the beet greens along with garlic and sauteed red onion with Spanish paprika for a side dish. Made for a good Thanksgiving dinner.

Loved this! My husband and I decided to have a quiet Christmas at home this year. We didn't need a whole turkey for the two of us, so we tried this with duck instead. I'm looking forward to an excuse to make it with turkey. The stuffing is outstanding - especially for those who are gluten and egg allergic!

We have made this recipe twice and has been a hit both times. If you like the hint of five spice, you will like this. I make a gravy with the pan drippings and the taste is not over powering. We do not put the stuffing in the bird, but cook in the oven with the giblets (after a quick fry). I have found on both occasions that I need to at least double the amount of liquid for the rice. Not sure of anyone else has comments. In regards to whether you use a white, brown, or purple turkey, not sure of the value of any input unless you have actually tried the recipe and have something worhtwhile to comment on. Peace

I have yet to prepare this recipe, but I plan to this Thanksgiving and found some information I thought you ought to know if you are using a brown feathered turkey (aka heritage, heirloom), which I plan to use. Based on the brining method I assume this recipe calls for a white feathered turkey (aka mass produced, wide breasted). Here is a link to help with preparing brown feathered "old fashioned" turkeys: http://www.williamrubel.com/heritageturkeys/roasting-heritage-turkeys

It was a lot of work but well worth it. The stuffing is fantastic. I rinsed the turkey for quite a while after taking it out of the brine and found it still a bit salty.
