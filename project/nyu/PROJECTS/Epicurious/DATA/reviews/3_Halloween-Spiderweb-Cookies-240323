I think a better way to get the spiderweb effect would be to use a round chocolate cookie and use white frosting to make the spider web on it... less sugar over-all, and less food colouring.

these were really below average sugar cookies. Not inedible, but not really a treat either. The icing on the other hand is horrible! It is the chalkiest, driest, hardest icing I have ever come across. You could probably use it to lay bricks.

yummy but rather time consuming.

I made these last year with my neice and nephew. We had such a good time making these. They tasted just like an average iced sugar cookie to me. The real fun was in the making of them.
