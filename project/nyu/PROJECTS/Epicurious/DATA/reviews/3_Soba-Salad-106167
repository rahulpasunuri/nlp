I was a little worried making this the first time after reading all the negative reviews. But it was great! I didn't substitute anything, and think I know why others didn't care for it. 1. Carrot doesn't work in place of the jicama because jicama is crisp and sweet, not crunchy. 2. If you sub out the mustard greens, you have to add something peppery to mimic the spicey flavor this veggie gives the salad. And finally, 3. When the recipe calls for salted water for the soba they mean SALTY! Without it the flavor of the roasted sesame oil is dulled. Hope that helps - and for those who love their fresh veggies this recipe is a summertime keeper!

I made many changes to this salad and my recommendation is contingent on serving it with the scallops. I think this only serves four and not six. First the substitutions; 2 carrots for the jicama and watercress for the mizuma. The major change I made was to the "dressing" which is unbearably bland. I tossed the soba with the sesame oil. I made a dressing from 1 TBL rice vinegar, 1 TSP sesame oil and 1 TSP vegetable oil, 1 TSP mirin, 1/2 TSP soy sauce and 1/2 TSP Thai chili sauce. That made a huge change in the flavor. The addition of the soy/citrus marinade from the scallops added the necessary kick.

It was a bit bland after I mixed it, so I added some additional sesame oil and a lot more rice vinegar. I substituted watercress for the mizuna (nice spice).

This is one of my favorite recipes from Gourmet! I don't really think it's too bland - I like the freshness of it, the vegetables aren't overwhelmed. That said, I do add a bit more sesame oil to it, and cilantro sounds like a nice addition (I'm making it now, I'll try that!). The best part is an excuse to use jicama, which I love, and people are always very interested in (since it is a rarely used vegetable!). Perfect to go with a summer lunch or dinner.

As written, I can only give it two forks. I substituted carrots for jicama and spinach for mizuma - ingredients on hand. The vegetables with the soba noodles were great, but the dressing lacked flavor and that I will definitely change in the future.

After reading everyone else's comments about the bland dressing, I made this with the following variations and thought it vastly improved! 1. Double the ratio of rice wine vinegar to oil - 2. Add grated ginger and lime juice to the dressing 3. Add a 1/2 tablespoon of mirin (sweet cooking wine) to the dressing, optional but adds depth.

This is a very good low-fat/low-cal salad. I added some fresh ginger, and next time will try subsituting spinach for the mustard greens (kinda bitter).

This dish goes well with the scallop recipe but on its own it would be rather bland and missing something as the previous reviewer states. It was also labor-intensive because there's a lot of chopping. I'll try it again with my new food processor and see if that cuts labor and time. I couldn't find mustard greens anywhere so I used radish sprouts which are very peppery on their own but blended in nicely with this dish.

My husband and I loved thie Soba salad with the scallops. I doubled the sesame oil and rice vinegar and also added 1 finely minced red thai chili. (We like spicy Asain food!)

I love soba, so was eager to try this. The simple sesame oil/rice vinegar dressing is definitely missing something.

This salad tasted as good the next day as the night before. I used what I had in my pantry/fridge: radishes and celery instead of jicama and romaine and arugula instead of mustard greens. I served it with the preceeding scallop recipe and it was a big success.

Chilled leftover salad is just as good, if not better. Everything is still crunchy. These flavors go so well together!

Excellent salad. Made as written with the addition of minced cilantro. Was a great main course salad with the Citrus Marinated Scallops. The scallops were divine and the marinade was outstanding. Will certainly make again and again.

I liked this a lot with the scallops. I could not find mizuno or mustard green. I was afraid arugula alone might be too bitter so I used a combination of curly endive and shredded arugula - nice color, texture and flavor. The leftover salad even held up as lunch the next day. I know it's annoying when people really mess with a recipe and then rave about their own version, but I did add extra sesame oil and rice vinegar. It otherwise seemed like it might be a bit too dry.

I am not a bell pepper fan so I substituted a red pepper that was not a bell pepper, but still sweet. I could not find mizuna and substituted arugala. I served this salad with previous scallop recipe. Fantastic!!!
