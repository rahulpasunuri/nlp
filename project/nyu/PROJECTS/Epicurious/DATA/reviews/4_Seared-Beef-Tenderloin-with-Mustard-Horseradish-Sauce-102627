I made four pounds of this at my party last night (around 26 adults) and there are only scraps left. I deviated slightly iffom the cooking method. I cut the four pound piece into two halves. I then salted both pieces on all sides and wrapped them in plastic at room temp for an hour. After unwrapping, I dried them, seasoned with pepper and seared them in a hot pan for about 2 minutes per each side (8-10 min total). I then put the skillet in a 425 degree oven for 20-25 minutes. I then quickly wrapped in plastic and a ziplock and put them in the freezer. I think I needed about six hours to get them frozen enough to cut paper thin. The beef was awesome on its own with a good roast and sear. The sauce is very good. As mentiioned in other reviews, it needs an extra tbsp or two of horesradish to add more zip. The sour cream is key here, because it cuts the acidity of the dijon and horseradish. We found people loving the sauce even though they told us afterwards that they dislike mustard and horesradish individually. One piece of advice is that doubling the meat does not require doubling the sauce. We have loads of it leftover. A single serving of the sauce goes a long way.

I've made this dish many times. It's my #1 "go-to" for any kind of casual gathering, from card games to cocktail parties. So easy to make, and so well liked by guests. Only problem is that there's never a crumb remaining for the host afterwards!

Using a meat thermometer, it took way more than 20 minutes to get to 140! And it looks very blackened on the outside. Is this normal? It's in the freezer now. I hope I haven't ruined Christmas dinner! Not sure why I got so brave and tried a new recipe for a big family dinner!

Made these for husband's 50th birthday - made two large trays and the disappeared straight away. So easy - will definitely make again

I love this recipe for a delicious and beautiful appetizer. I have made it twice now, and both times with the recommended sauce - fantastic. I follow the recipe exactly, and agree that the beef has to be frozen for cutting. Yesterday my beef wasn't completely frozen, guests were arriving shortly, so I cut it anyway. The beef still looked beautiful, but wasn't in perfect rounds like last time. Also, I would recommend cooking the beef very rare. Don't omit the watercress, it is just perfect with the beef. The only change I might make is that I would make at least some of the little open face toasts in advance with the meat, watercress, and sauce so that the guests don't have to make them themselves. But even when the guests have to make their own little sandwiches, this beef disappears into happy tummies.

After reading the reviews, I was expecting a much better recipe. I made this for a holiday party with only so so results...

Prepared this for my annual Christmas Cocktail Party - was a big hit. Freezing the meat is KEY - and made slicing SOOO easy (I was fearful I won't be able to get it thin enough, and it was prefect). Used baby arugula rather than watercress and toasted the bacquets. So pretty and yummy!

I know this is super- short notice, and I'm not sure if anyone will respond... but I figured I would try anyway. I planned on serving this at a party for 60 people 4 days from now. Last night I bought the meat, but I got it in steak form. Will this recipe still work if i pan-sear the steaks (approx 4 minutes on each side to get them to medium-rare), and then freeze them for a bit to ease with the cutting? The host of the party is expecting this dish... and the $90 worth of meat needs to be used somehow. Thanks so much for the help!!!

I have no idea what LMbaer from mpls was talking about when reviewing this recipe, I doubt they did either. They probably shouldent have substituted a chuck roast for the tenderloin, just kidding. This is an elegant and simple hors d'oeuvre anyone can get right. It's just a alternative way to prepare beef for a nice presentation at the table. Pairs well with a red wine and shallot reduction also.

I did not care for this. I personally would rather use this very expensive cut of meat grilled with garlic mashed and sauteed mushrooms. I have meat snobs in my family, only the best cuts, and they would not eat it.

Made this for a dinner party last night, used 2 lbs. of tenderloin for about 15 people- it was gone immediately and was the only thing I made that had no leftovers! I was worried the horseradish sauce was going to be too strong, but it was wonderful! I toasted the baguette slices after brushing with olive oil for more flavor and crunch. I love it when a recipe this easy tastes so great, plus it really showcased our delicious Iowa beef!

Always a crowd-pleaser, and so simple to make! I made about 4 lbs. of tenderloin for a party this weekend, and have about 1/2 lb. left (this was along with several other entrees/appetizers). Tried the suggestion to oven-cook after searing; I think it brought the meat to the desired degree of doneness. (I have one or two well-done fans, but I usually cook up theirs after the meat is sliced.) The sauce is a must for me and DH, although others like the meat just as is. Note to the person asking about using pork tenderloin: it's a totally different meat and would not necessarily work well with this preparation. Better to do a nice marinade and then grill it (don't think most people want ultra-rare pork...) It's worth the extra $$ to use the beef for a special occasion.

I made this for a bridal shower for 26 women, doubled the recipe, and they mauled it. I should have tripled the recipe, but they would have just mauled that, too. This is a great recipe!

Made this for a New Year's Eve party and it was a big hit. Finishing it off in the oven with a meat thermometer is key. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe. This is a great make-ahead recipe that works well on a buffet. Good presentation, as well. Don't pass on the sauce, it's fantastic!

Have made this for several parties and everyone loves it. Very easy, make ahead kind of dish.

I have made this twice for parties. Definitely finish it off in the oven. The filet can be made the day before if properly stored and then assembled just ahead of guests' arrival. The sauce is a MUST and it's great for other beef entrees as well. I serve it with little, sliced "silver dollar rolls" from the bakery: about 1-2" in diameter and soft. No matter how much I make, it always gets totally gobbled up!

A good, simple recipe. Great for a party because the work is done in advance. It's a solid recipe, but not a "wow".

Would I be crazy to try this with pork tenderloin? It's sooo much cheaper.

I took the advice of several other reviewers and, after searing, finished the roast in the oven. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. The party guests were all weight-concious females, yet not a scrap remained. Easy & a very elegant presentation.

We really enjoyed this! We chose not to assemble it as little sandwiches, but instead made up plates of the watercress and beef, and served slices of a multi-grain baguette on the side. We loved the combination of flavors in each bite - a bit of beef, a bit of parmesan, a caper....yum! We actually forgot to put out the horseradish-mustard sauce, and it was still great!

This recipe was a hit at our Superbowl party, even if our team didn't win! The advice from previous reviewers regarding finishing it off in the oven was very helpful. After consulting my beloved Joy of Cooking cookbook and my new meat thermometer, I preheated the oven to 425 degrees while searing the roast on all sides, and finished the roast in the oven until medium rare. The spicy sauce was a great complement to the meat. The meat, incidentally, was pricey by our standards ($14.99 per pound!) but totally worth it - we just served less expensive accompaniments.

Brought it to a New Year's Eve party and it quickly disappeared. Every one raved. It really was delicious and so easy! And has a great presentation too. Like another reviewer, after I seared the tenderloin, I put it in the oven at 400 for about 20 minutes and the 'rareness' was perfect. Also only added half the amount of mustard called for in the sauce which seemed just right.

OMG!!! If you like carpaccio you will LOVE this! It is so easy. I didn't "finish" it in the oven, I thought 20 minutes in the pan gave it a beautiful crust and brought it to fabulous blood rare perfection. There was not a scrap left at my party!!!

To the previous contributor regarding select vs choice, I always buy select since it's much cheaper, but I don't believe I sacrifice flavor. I always get tons of compliments on my beef tenderloin no matter how I make it. Let's hope this recipe is good!

I haven't made it yet, just have comments and questions. Does anybody have recommendations re: "Select" vs. "Choice" quality meat? I prefer to always use Choice but it will be pretty pricey for the amount I have planned. Also is the watercress solely for garnish (in which case I may substitute something else), or does it actually make it into the sandwhich? By the way, for the previous reader, it is "one 1-1/2 lb. tenderloin"

What is the amount of beef? 11 1/2 lbs? 1 1/2 lbs? It sounds wonderful but I don't know how long to cook it. Help

I changed this recipe, since I love to cook sauces with my tenderloin. I cooked the tenderloin med. rare; meanwhile I sauteed red and yellow peppers with garlic, salt and fresh ground pepper. Because of previous reviews, I only added 1/8 cup of Dijon mustard to the sauce. When the tenderloin was cooked, I put the sauce on the steaks and placed the peppers on top. Wonderful sauce-I will cook this again!

We made this recipe for a cocktail party. It was very popular. The sauce was excellent. Like another reviewer, we seared it and then completed it in the oven with the help of a meat thermometer.

This is a great (if incomplete) recipe. Really good for a buffet or coctail party. I seared the tenderloin then "completed" it by putting the frying pan in a 375 degree oven for 25 minutes (used a meat thermometer). By freezing the meat it really made slicing it much easier.

Having only recently started preparing meat, I could have used some more information on 'cook until done'. Considered frying it in the pan for 20 min, but then realized it was probably meant to be put in the oven at an unknown temp. For all that, it turned out very well- tasty sauce and great presentation.
