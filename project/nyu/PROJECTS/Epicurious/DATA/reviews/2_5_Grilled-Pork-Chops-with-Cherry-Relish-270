Rather tasty! Made as directed. Even my picky teenager (who proclaimed the night before she no longer likes or eats pork chops), gave it a thumbs up & devoured the cherry relish too. Will add to the make again list.

Needed a quick grilled pork chop recipe and this filled the bill as I had all the ingredients except ginger so I did w/out. After reading the other reviews I decided to improvise. The relish seemed like it would be a bit dry so I added about 2 tblspns of balsamic vinegar and then some fresh thyme and chives. My husband raved about this and claimed the leftovers for his lunch the next day. Definitely a keeper!

After reading the reviews, I was a little nervous about this recipe. I decided to add curry powder and really loved the results. My boyfriend, who is very finicky, said it was the best meal I ever cooked.

I found this dish to be just okay. It certainly tasted better with the pork than on its own, but like another reviewer, I felt the elements just didn't come together. And it wasn't my cherries - they were fresh and very flavorful on their own.

I substituted the cherries for ripe plumbs, hand-picked from the tree in our front yard. Yummy!

This dish was extremely easy and very flavorful. I substituted ground ginger and used some cherries that I had canned last year. I would imagine that frozen cherries (thawed) would be just fine as well.

I found this recipe to be very unexciting. It seemed good on paper, but after the enticing smell of the sauteed garlic, ginger, and onion, the whole was less than the sum of its parts. My wife and I found it nothing to write home about.

Enjoyed by all on the 4th of July. A last-minute grill problem meant I had to finish the chops under the broiler (same time as grilling). So good, so easy. I used ginger paste instead of fresh ginger (available at ethnic grocers).

This was SO easy and had such an interesting flavor. Bye bye boring old Porkchops and Applesauce! Unfortunately, fresh cherries were completely unavailable when I planned to make this, so I had to use canned ones. I didn't expect much success, but it turned out delicious! I bought a can of sweet bings and simply drained them. Once cherry season hits, I'm making this again.

My friends definitely found it a hit, and we're picky college students. I wasn't able to get fresh cherries. However, I found dehydrated cherries work in a pinch. Just soak them for an hour or so to help rehydrate them and add some of the water to the relish with the cherries since some of the flavor is leeched out.

This has been added to the rotation at my house. We look forward to cherry season!

Didn't get to grill the same night I began to marinade so it sat covered in my refrigerator for an extra day. Don't know if this made a difference. I discovered I was out of gas for the grill so I broiled them in the over for 4 minutes on each side. Never having done this before, I was sceptical but they came out great. With the added relish ingredients there was a plethora of tastes with every bite. It was delicious!!

If you have any leftover relish, it is good on crackers smeared with a little cream cheese or goat cheese.

I loved the taste of this as well as the ease in preparation. It also is a cost effective recipe which is always a bonus. I would definitely prepare it again.
