I've been making this jelly for probably 20+ years when this recipe since it first appeared in the magazine and I always get rave reviews. i always give it for holiday gifts and I aways serve it with roasted lamb and grilled lamb chops. It's fabulous!

I have been preparing this recipe for 22 years and it has never failed me. Contrary to another review, I would say "Don't ruin the recipe with pepper", and for those who can't get it to set, I would say "That's not the recipe's fault." Delicious every time, and visually pleasing, as well!

I have been making this recipe for years, and I love it. I substitute red wine, as it is a very pretty jelly, and put one mint leaf on top so guests know that it is mint jelly. Yes, it is sweet, but I like it.

Oops, ignore that thing about boiling one minute. I meant to write that about another recipe for mint jelly.

I figured out what's causing this not to set up: you have to boil the mixture for one minute AFTER you add the liquid pectin. The directions that come with the liquid pectin tell you to do this for all jams and jellies. Why this recipe omitted the step, I don't know. I re-boiled mine, and it set up.

Ok I take it back. Second batch did finally set up but it took over 24 hours must be something to do with the liquid pectin I am not sure.

This recipe SUCKS.Not only did I deplete my mint garden but wasted far too much wine on a recipe that NEVER set up...now i'm left with jars of sweet mint juice

I doubled the recipe since I have abundant supplies of both mint and rosemary. I didn't have quite enough wine, so I added a third more lemon juice to make up the liquid. This gave the final product a distinct tang, and I must say, a refreshingly delicious one. I haven't actually tried it with anything except a spoon, but I think it might make a nice glaze on a pork tenderloin or marinated barbecued chicken wings (with the chilis mentioned by the previous reviewer this time)....

A little too sweet. Could not taste the rosemary. Could use some heat (hot pepper).
