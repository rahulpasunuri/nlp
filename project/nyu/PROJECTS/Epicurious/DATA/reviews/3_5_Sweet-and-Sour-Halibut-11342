Made this last night pretty much from the recipe, but took others' suggestion to double the sauce. I didn't have fresh gingerroot so I used 1 teaspoon of ground ginger (instead of 1 tablespoon, remember I doubled the sauce).

Delicious & easy - I've saved this recipe for years. It helps to double the sauce, which is always in high demand.

Delicious. I would make this again in a minute.

I think the key to this dish is making sure the sauce cooks long enough - I cooked it almost twice as long until it lost some of the vinegar's sourness.

Did not care for the sauce at all, it's edible but is overly sour and lacks character. Much better sweet and sour recipes to be had. A waste on good halibut.

I wish I'd read the other reviews before making it!! Then I would have known to at least double the sauce... Even so, it was delicious and quite easy to prepare.

This is fine for a weeknight supper but certainly not a big deal. I'll keep looking for new ways to prepare halibut.

Excellent dish, and super easy....the sauce is great, but definitely needs more of it. I doubles the sauce and was still not enogh, for my taste. I added bell peppers and celery, would also be good w/ chicken or shrimp. YUM!

I had leftover cooked halibut (microwaved) and used it for this. This is a yummy sauce, but not enough of it. I'll double it next time. Also I might add garlic, and a little red pepper flakes. I also added barely warmed chopped home-grown tomato, and sprinkled it with toasted sesame seeds and it was good. I think a few crisp-tender cooked bell pepper pieces would also be a good addition.

This was very good and not time consuming. Although, I don't think its anything special, its a good weekday dish.

What a refreshing way to prepare fish! This one is a keeper in our household. Only changes I would make is to grill the fish w/o flouring then cover in sauce - halibut has such great flavor that flour and frying is not needed! My husband ate 3 helpings!

Love the sauce! To reduce calories and fat, I covered and baked the halibut in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes instead of frying.

This was fabulous! Living on the west coast I am always looking for good fish recipes. The amount of sauce was just right but if you prefer lots of sauce on your rice double it. This recipe would please even non fish lovers and would go especially well as a Chinese food entree.

I made this with Alaskan sable (just like Chilean sea bass)instead of halibut and it was terrific.

Great as a stand alone dish, but begs to be customized.

This is a "keeper". My husband is a fisherman and we have both Alaskan halibut and salmon in the freezer. I thought I had taken out the halibut, turned out to be the salmon, cooked it anyway, and the results were delicious. Thanks very much!

This was excellent!! it was so good I had to come back to review it. It was a hit with my whole family and got my 4 boys to eat fish! the sauce would be great with egg rolls or pork or chicken instead of the halibut. But I wouldn't change a thing!!

Delicious. Loved the ginger. Made this with together with shrimp with peanut sauce (sauteed shrimp instead of fried, though). Feared it would be a bad combination, but everyone loved it and we're making the same meal again very soon. Tempted to use even more ginger, but probably not.

This is an easy to make very good recipe. I added fresh nutmeg to the flour and also added some fresh bell peppers and mushrooms to make it more of a one dish meal. Up here in Alaska we are always looking for good ways to make halibut! Again, very good.

the combined flavors crown halibut King of seafoods.

Very different but delicious. Finely grate the ginger. My husband loved it and begged me to make it again. Might be nice with Squid. Easy as pie. I served it with Cous-Cous and used a mold to make a mound, then topped with the fish.
