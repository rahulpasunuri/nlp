I had a few problems with the amount of batter. I tried at first to put it in my 9" springform pan (I don't have an 8") but the batter barely covered the bottom of the pan. I transfered it to an 8x8 glass baking dish and baked it for about 27 minutes, but the cake came out more like a thin brownie than a cake. I ended up making a second cake a layering it on top of the first with some frosting a chopped almonds between the two layers. After frosting the cake, I decorated it with daisies made from almonds. Sadly, despite all my efforts, the cake (which was the only dessert at the party) did not fly off the pan. In the end, the cake turned out to be a very expensive brownie. I will say that the next day, we ate the left overs and it was much better chilled in the fridge then served at room temperature.

I don't like to buy baking chocolate, as it's several times the price of chocolate bars. So I buy chocolate bars --I pick them up whenever I see them on sale. I always look for at least 60% cocoa--that's bittersweet, or dark.

This cake is FANTASTIC. PLEASE use GOOD quality dark chocolate, I used the Lindt 70% and it was perfect for this recpie. I'd never had Irish whiskey cake before so I was expecting it to have a strong whiskey flavor but it didn't, it was a subtle flavor in the background. I used Jamesons, my favorite Irish whiskey. This cake is NOT very sweet and which is why I love this so much, it's just full of chocolate flavor. I used a 9" springform and cooked it about 34-35 mins. I will make this again and again.

Easy to make but time-consuming. It was very good, but not so outstanding that it would be worth making again.

I made this for new years - Lovely indulgent boozy cake. I substituted Makers Mark and it was heavenly. The glossy frosting was amazing. I didn't have the smaller spring-form and used a 10 inch. Baked it for 25-30 minutes. Was about 1.5 inches tall - but rich and delicious. I am going to try it again - thinking of doubling the recipe and using the 10 inch pan. I also used regular sugar and vanilla extract.

This was very popular last year and it was requested I make it again. Yummy.

This was a very nice dessert, without being too fussy. Simple and refined. "Adult" flavors, not too sweet. Everyone loved it.

Excellent dessert! Everyone thought it was going to be really rich so only asked for a small piece but everyone came back for seconds (and thirds!). It is very light with the right amount of sweetness, especially the frosting. I also didn't have vanilla sugar so used regular sugar and added vanilla. Lots of steps but it's not difficult - just takes time. Try it!

I've made this cake twice with excellent results both times. I used pastry flour instead of all purpose. And I purchased vanilla sugar from Williams Sonoma instead of making my own. It is a very dense & very rich cake. And if you happen to screw it up, you can serve the Irish whiskey and tell your guests it's cake. They'll never know the difference.

Substituted regular sugar and vanilla extract. Easy recipe, though not nearly as moist as other chocolate cake recipes. Perhaps adding some oil would help. Good but not great.

Superb. I used cognac as I didn't have any Irish Whiskey.

wow...what an intense cake. If you enjoy a truly bittersweet dutch cocoa type cake this is the one for you. Very dense, very dark, very tasty!
