My friends RAVED about this dessert, & my husband said it is the best dessert I have ever made (& I make fancy desserts often). I used frozen berries & added a scant tsp of cornstarch. Next time I will add either beaten egg whites or whipped cream to the marscapone/curd mixture to make it lighter/creamier. I made it more like a trifle, in a glass bowl, with 2 layers of ladyfingers. Excellent recipe!

I added some whipped egg whites to the marscapone/lime curd topping and it added a light and fluffy touch that was perfect. I also used lime zest on the berries and served the each portion with some fresh berries washed in lime juice syrup over the top and lime zest.

This recipe was amazing. Served it over the weekend for a dinner party we had. I found it quite a bit of work but totally worth it. Everyone went crazy for it. You could also use a white cake, angel food or crunchy plain cookies as well. Kitchenpuss

Sensational!!! Can actually be made way quicker than suggested if you are in a rush. I normally like doing everything way ahead of time but was out of time when guests suddenly were coming to dinner. The curd sets in the freezer in a few hours, and the berries cool down quickly. I served in individual glasses and easily served 6 big servings with lime curd left over. In the glasses I had 2 layers of everything. I reduced the amount of cream and mascarpone as I love lime curd and the leftover curd cream was devoured as an extra when serving. I used quickfrozen berries which were fine. Super delicious and looked fab in individual glasses.

Delicious....realized too late that I had no limes in the house so made the 'lime' curd into 'orange curd' and still tasted fabulous. Served it in a trifle bowl (large clear glass bowl) and everyone awed when I brought it to the table for the final course. Heeding the warning about 'sogginess', I made the curd/marscarpone topping AND the berry layer the night before, refrigerated both and then layered the morning of the dinner party and it was perfect (even though I used 'soft' ladyfingers. Would be easy to sub pound cake, angel food cake or any kind of cake for this layer and the result would likely be similar...will make again

This was fabulous! It is now one of my favorite summer desserts. Everyone I have served it to has been impressed. By the way, I follow the recipe exactly and it always turns our wonderful.

Much effort, but deleicous. I had problems with the texture. It came out very soupy, next time I would add more lady fingers. I did use organic lady fingers, so this might have had an effect on how they absorb the syrup.

Made this dessert for our gourmet group last night and it was just sinfully delicious. Yes...many steps, but nothing technically difficult and everything done in advance. One thing was I had trouble spreading the mascarpone/lime curd layer without the berry mixture bleeding through a bit, so there were some streaks of purple on top (I know I am incredibly picky about this kind of stuff). If anyone has a recommendation on how to avoid this, I would greatly appreciate it. Also...I think the berry mix would be wonderful over pound cake with maybe a little of the mascarpone/lime curd mix on top...just to change it up a but. Otherwise, this is a fabulous dessert for summer entertaining. Will definitely make again!

While time consuming, it's simple to make and YUMMY! Personally, I prefer recipes that I can make in advance; just plan to make the curd & bery mixture one day in advance. Make sure to click on LIME CURD as it's a hyperlink to that recipe, and it is indeed divine. To avoid soggy berries, I simmered the blueberries for 5 minutes, then added the blackberries & raspberries for the last 3 minutes. Worked well, but will do the timing as 6 minutes + 2 minutes next time. I used more strawberries than recipe called for as visually, I felt it needed it. Truly delicious.

This was great. I was skeptical of the powdered sugar in the berry mixture but it worked really well. The little bit of cornstartch found in powdered sugar actually worked as a slight thickener if you bring this just to a boil for a quick second so as not to hurt the berries. I actually prepared this in a glass pie plate and doubled the laters of lady fingers and berries and then topped with one layer of the lime curd mix. I think that without the extra layer the topping would have smothered the berries. This may be a matter of preference since I prefer the flavor of the summer fruit to really stand out. It is a beautiful and easy dessert. Give it a try.

Loved this! Made it for Father's day and it was a hit. I had read the review about it being too soggy, so I cut back the water a bit, and also turned the ladyfingers on their side in the dish instead of laying them flat. It was perfect! The only minor drawback is the time factor-- having to make the lime curd the day before, letting the fruit cool/chill, etc. But it was worth every bit!!

I made this dessert for a graduation party. It received rave reviews. I had not realized that the lime curd was supposed to sit overnight, so I just let it sit in the fridge for as long as the berry mixture, to cut down on time. It was delicious, and the mascarpone topping was perfect!

i made this recipe exactly as is the first time and found the lady fingers got too soft. The second time I made with 2 cups sliced strawberries (no sugar and no heating) directly on the ladyfingers. Then topped with the Mascarpone topping then dropped blueberries on top - it was wonderful - all my guest loved it!!

The recipe for the lime curd is attached to this recipe. Click on the ingredient that says "Lime Curd" and it's really a link to that recipe. You're not supposed to buy it or anything. I'm really surprised people missed that, since Epicurious does that a lot. So, hope that helps people out.

Okay this tasted FANTASTIC, but there are a few caveats. First and foremost, Lime Curd is really hard to find. Even a speciality food store that carries lemon curd won't necessarily have lime curd. Start with locating this ingredient before signing on to the recipe. Next, the recipe doesn't say how MUCH lime curd to use, but I guess you can do what I did, which is "to taste" and that worked great. Also, I don't understand the cooking berries step, or how you could "simmer" raspberries "until soft but intact". While I accept the fact that I'm not skilled, raspberries are a very delicate berry and once they're heated up and stirred they fall apart. In future I would cook only the blueberries and fold the raspberries, blackberries and strawberries into the cooled mixture. Also, I drained the cooked mixture of the excess juices so that the ladyfingers didn't become completely soggy and this worked really well. They retained a bit of crispness, and you could also still taste the lime simple syrup that is brushed on them. Overall this was a huge hit with guests and looked beautiful (I made it in a triffle bowl), it tasted wonderful, but again, a few glitches with the actual recipe itself.

Definitely a bit labor intensive, but well worth it. I only used one tub of mascarpone and half the cream so it was much more lime flavored. I'd also recommend reducing the powdered sugar by at least half. The berries were way too juicy and made the ladyfingers soggy, while I would have preferred that they retained a little more texture.

Many parts of this dessert were delicious, however, it was very heavy (and is still sitting in my stomach). If I were to make again I would reduce the amount of mascarpone and use more whipped cream to make it lighter. Also this is fairly labor intensive but in the end worth the time for a special dessert. I reserved some of the lime curd to put on top as a garnish which was pretty and gave the dessert a little burst of flavor that I don't think it would have had otherwise.

Have not made it yet, but sounds delicious - a nice, summer treat. For the reviewers who have asked about lime curd - you can find this 'ready-made' somewhere in the jelly isle of most supermarkets - I believe made by 'Dickenson's'.

For those looking for the lime curd recipe, just click on "Lime Curd," which is the link to the recipe. This site has resisted for years to make such links more evident.

What is lime curd and why doesn't the recipe say how to make it? Confusing... Sounds really awesome though and I will make it IF I can find "lime curd".

Delicious!! Instead of very expensive mascarpone I substituted softened cream cheese with a little heavy cream mixed into it. I also used a jar of store-bought lime curd instead of making my own. With all the berries and fruit and other cream there is no way anyone would know the difference, and you save nearly $20 bucks and a lot of time. Otherwise I made it all in one layer and served a lot of people. After a big party 16 had some, and there was still leftover.

I made this for Mother's Day and it was a hit! I did change the recipe a bit though, I layered the tiramisu instead of making it a single layer- it was gorgeous! The lime curd was fresh and crisp, adding a nice and springy feel to the dish! Will definitely make this again!
