i kicked this up a notch, adding celery,chopped jalepenos and green onions to the broth, then added taco seasoning to the meat balls.

Authentic-I know many "authentic" recipes, and who is to say what is. I believe chicken broth is best in my opinion-add dried tomato soup later. Don't leave out potatoes, celery, carrots - I add zuchinni and slice corn-on-the-cob later. Rice, Garlic, jalapeno, cilantro, onion, egg and....chopped mushrooms(hah!-yes I am a gringo) in my meatballs. My Mexican husband says it is way better than all the "authentic" recipes he has had. Lemon wedges and corn tortillas while serving. Experiment, that is what makes good, creative cooking.

Everyone leaves out the MINT!!! Also, the onion and garlic should be ground in a molcajete or food processor prior to adding them to the meatballs. I also add a touch of cumin seed, ground fresh. Add 3 tb of finely chopped FRESH mint leave. No beef broth or water. The soup is tomato based! No egg or breadcrumbs, either..doesn't need it. The best recipe I've ever seen for albondigas is in the cookbook "Mexico the Beautiful". Worth every penny. All the recipes are fabulous and as authentic as they can be when altered a bit for what is available in the US.

A Gringo must have given you this. Use plain water, NOT beef/chicken stock. Below is a great recipe For Albondigas Soup...try it, you'll like it! ALBONDIGAS SOUP: 1/2 pound pork ground 1/2 pound beef ground 1 medium onion chopped 1 medium tomato chopped 1/2 bunch cilantro chopped 1/4 cup rice salt and pepper to taste 3 cloves garlic minced 1 large egg 1 cup bread crumbs Mix all ingredients together, make meatballs about 1" in diameter, drop in pot of boiling water, cook until rice in meatballs is done. correct seasoning.

Rated only due to the fact I used celery and carrots, and half of the meat was Italian sausage which adds loads of flavor to the 'albondigas.'

There seems to be a lot of the key ingredients missing from this recipe. Spanish Rice...it is served over Spanish Rice, plus celery, potatoes, and carrots. There should be rice in the meatballs as well as cilantro. Tortillas are served warm on the side.

Not quite the albondigas that I remember. Where is a "real recipe"? When one goes to a decent mexican resturant, albondigas soup sometimes has rice in the meatballs, the broth is usually so tasty, and there are carrots and ather various vegetables in the soup. Why can I not find a recipe that tastes like that?
