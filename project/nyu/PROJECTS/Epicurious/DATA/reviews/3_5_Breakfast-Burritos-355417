Good, easy recipe to make. I used corn tortillas instead of flour (a personal preference) and didn't add any cheese. Next time I'd like to try it with refried or black beans which I think would make the recipe even better.

Easy breakfast to make. I didn't have Mexican chorizo so I replaced the chorizo with turkey bacon and it was delicious. I also added red and green peppers and topped it off with some hot sauce.

Awesome - really like those in Santa Fe. A very good variation is to sautee an uncooked salmon burger (crumbled) instead of the chorizo and use fontina cheese instead of monterey jack. Very, very good! Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/foo d/notes/Breakfast-Burritos- 355417#ixzz0tVUviS9H

I didn't have avocado so sauteed some spinach after I had cooked onion, the chorizo and potato. And instead of salsa I added chopped jalepenos to the eggs. Then a tiny dollop of sour cream and some home grown sprouts. It reminded me of the breakfasts I used to have at Sofio's in Telluride.

Excellent recipe.....make sure you thorougly drain potato, and brown it in some oil before you add to the chorizo. This makes the burrito less ''wet'' and helps to retain the flavor of each ingredient.

Actually, the avocado is wonderful, though optional. You can certainly add refried beans, but I like whole, drained and rinsed black or pinto beans. I also add green chilis. This can get soggy, so be careful that your ingredients are fairly dry before you add them. (Or just eat fast!)

Hold the avocado and use refried beans. Ham or bacon works as well.
