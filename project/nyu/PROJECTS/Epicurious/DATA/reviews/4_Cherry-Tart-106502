Made this for a big group of people on Valentine's Day weekend with cut-out hearts as the "lattice" top. It was devoured! Got a lot of compliments. The only thing is: this crust is a NIGHTMARE to make. I read the recipe at least 10 times as I was making the crust, and know I did everything right, but the crust wouldn't stick together! It was as though it needed another egg or water. VERY bizarre. I actually had to wait a bit for the butter to melt more to hold the crust together, rather than making sure it was super-cold as other reviewers have said. It ended up tasting delicious, but the stress I went through to make the crust...well, I'm not entirely sure it was worth it. lol Three forks are for the taste, NOT the process.

My favorite tart to make. Not hard at all and it tastes so good, everyone at your dinner party will think you are a professional. Crust is definitely difficult...just keep chilling as recommended. Also, it's really easy to fix crust "blunders" while in the tart pan. No one will every know! This is my husband's favorite dessert.

I just made this for a delayed T'giving dinner. It was an easy recipe and my 12 guests raved. Not a single crumb left.

This is not a tricky crust if you just remember to keep it cold. Refrigerate to chill before rolling and during the rolling out process if necessary. When putting in the pan use another piece of dough to gently tamp the crust into the tart pan. You will be surprised at how well this works, because the crust is not getting warm from your hands.

This turned out absolutely perfect! I turned the temperature up at first to get the beautiful crusty golden brown, and then lowered it back to 325 and covered the tart with foil. Make sure to use high quality cherry preserves. Can't wait to make this again! wonderful spring dessert. The crust is one of the best I've made.

Amazing! This was my first experience working with this type of crust. Other reviewers are correct -- you do need to work quickly. I found putting the dough back in the freezer while arranging the lattice helped. This is a keeper -- I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it.

This is a beautiful tart. I used a mixture of tart and sweet cherries and toasted sliced almonds. The crust is tricky, but I rolled out the crust and froze it for 5 minutes(at the suggestion of another reviewer) before placing it in the pan. I also cut the lattice strips and chilled them before putting them on the tart. I would have used my standard pie crust recipe if the reviews were not so outstanding in favor of this one. It does make this tart something special.

This crust is really worth making - the taste is fantastic, however it is the hardest crust to work with . I have made this recipe serveral times and always end up battling with the crust-but the result is simply delish!!

The tart received rave reviews from family and friends! I tweaked the filling recipe with the following changes: instead of using cherry preserves, I cooked a combination of frozen blueberries, strawberries and raspberries with some sugar until it reduced to a jam-like consistency. Also, used 1 cup of dried cherries, blueberries and cranberries instead of just cherries. The amount of filling just about filled the tart (I'd imagine using just 1/2 cup of dried fruits would have resulted in a pretty sparse filling). Used almonds instead of pistachios. As others found, the crust was a little tricky, it's all about getting it to the right temperature to work with. Definitely go with the shortbread crust, it's simply delicious!

You must make haste with this crust, which I also found to be a pain in the rear. I had to re-chill it twice the first time I made it because I did not make enough haste pressing it into the shell. After the first bite, though, all troubles were forgotten! My guest loved it and I had to tell them that they shant take any home with them - several asked- because I wanted it! I have tried it with less almond extract as a fellow reveiewer recommends and actually think the amount in the recipe is spot on. I usually use the entire jar of cherry preserves (the recipe calls for a little less than what comes from Smuckers) and add a few more pistachios than are called for.

I have made this recipe dozens of times and always a success! I roll out the dough and freeze it for five minutes before I put it into the tart pan. Oh and I use peacans because I have those in the freezer all of the time. That's my only suggestions.

I didn't have any lemon on hand but I did have lemon flavored pistachios. Replaced almond with vanilla extract. Thats what I had available! I have to say the pie crust makes this tart. Make it for cherry lovers.

I used Irish butter and let it get to room temperature before mixing and I think that was a mistake. I had a hard time rolling the dough (I'm no dough expert), and decided instead to press it into the tart pan in pieces which worked out fine. I ended up needing more filling so I emptied the rest of the cherry perserves into the mix to fill it out and again, this worked out great. I cooked mine about 1 hour 20 minutes. It was great (served with vanilla ice cream) and I'll definitely make it again!!! My guests raved!!

This is such a great recipe! I made it for Easter orphans (mostly my boyfriends single friends) and everybody loved it! I was sad to see there was non left to take it home:( One suggestion, I did one and 1/2 the filling recipe and it was the perfect amount.

Very, very easy and delicious. I used a prepared pie crust and almonds instead of pistachios. Next time I think I would add less almond extract (tad overwhelming).

Beautiful, delicious dessert! My Easter guests were most impressed! I would encourage cooks to use the pastry in the recipe rather than traditional pie crust. The crust in the recipe is more like a shortbread than simple pie pastry. I found it very difficult to work with - gets soft very fast due to the butter and the lattice looked a bit of a mess when I put it in the oven, however, it is a forgiving crust and sort of smooths out as it bakes.

This is very tasty and the lattice effect makes a nice presentation. I cheat, however, and use the pie crusts you can buy in the box in the refrigerated section of the grocery store. Makes prep very easy! Hope you enjoy it.

Very good tart with a flaky crust. Rich and sweet, and easy to modify (I've substituted dried cranberries and oranges zest for the cherries and lemon zest to create a Thanksgiving tart.)

Have made it several times. . . always very well received by guests/office workers. It's pretty, a little different, and not difficult. Crust can quickly get too soft to work with easily, but haste in this case prevents waste.

I have alrady made this tart 3 times. It has become one of my standard dessert recipes and everyone always goes crazy over it. It serves 8 and is nice topped with homemade almond ice cream. My changes - I use 2-10oz. jars of the Knotts Berry Farm Bing Cherry preserves as well as the dried cherries and almonds instead of the pistachios. Great year round dessert!
