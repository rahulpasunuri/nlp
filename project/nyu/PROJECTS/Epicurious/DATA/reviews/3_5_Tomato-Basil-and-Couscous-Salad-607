This is a great recipe to have in your pocket. It's one of those recipes that works with so many things. I'm sure it's great as written, but I added quite a bit to mine. I had a big crowd so I more or less tripled it. Using vegetable stock for the couscous, I added a cucumber, a bunch of chopped parsley and a small bunch of mint. I also added some chopped feta and the juice of one lemon. It was a huge hit and the only thing on the table with no leftovers! I'll make this again and again - or some variation of it!

This recipe was so savory, quick and healthy. I'll definitely repeat with additional adjustments. Initially, I soaked the couscous in vegetable broth, tried the vinegar on a bit before deciding not to use any at all (it takes away from the light and fresh feel of the salad), used extra crushed pepper (i'm a spicy senorita) and settled for some large tomatos. It was much better without the tomatos, but suspect it was the type of tomato I used that didn't jive.

My go to summer salad recipe. I always reduce the olive oil to 1/3 cup and I up the vinegar. I also use a white balsamic so it doesn't make it that unappetizing color. Definitely add some fresh mozzarella to it!

What a great recipe. So light and healthy. I used some lemon juice and zest along with grape tomatoes halved as some suggested. Next time will do it with chicken and blue cheese crumbles!

I love this salad especially in the summer because it is delicious and easy to make. I reduce the vinegar to 1/8 cup and sometimes substitute flavored vinegars such as tomato, black currant, etc.. I also use different broths depending on what is fresh in the fridge.

Served this last night with the Crunchy string bean salad with red onion and proscuitto and chicken al mattone last night to rave reviews. It was even better for lunch today.

I LOVE this salad. I've made it many times for family and potlucks. I always get raves. It's so simple to make and tastes better the second day (but it rarely lasts that long) I usually decrease the oil a bit but keep the vinegar the same- the flavour is delicious!

Very nice followed the recipe, but also made the lemon juice and cucumber additions like some others. A nice salad to welcome SPRING!!!

Pretty good salad. I used sun dried tomatoes instead of cherry or grape tomatoes, and added some feta. Not really a winter salad, but it's not like the ingredients are seasonal so it still works.

Pretty good summer side salad, and healthier than mayonnaise-based pasta and potato sides. I took the advice of others and substituted lemon juice for half of the balsamic and it was still a bit vinegary for my taste. However, it was still a nice pairing with falafel, red pepper hummus, and tzatziki on a warm spring evening.

This recipe got favorable reviews at my July 4th BBQ. I used a few of the suggestions, including using 1/2 balamic vinegar and 1/2 lemon juice and adding a diced cucumber. I also used grape tomoatoes which I cut in half instead of diced seeded plum tomatoe. I think it made for a prettier presentation. I think it was better the second day.

I made this salad for a department picnic and it was a big hit. However, like another reviewer here, I didn't like the combination of the vinegar and the onions. It's overwhelming and bitter. Next time I'll leave out the green onions. Oh, I also added in diced cucumber which I thought fit perfectly.

Very good, very easy. I followed the recomendations about more lemon and less oil. I mixed everything just an hour before serving, but it was still tasty the next day too.

I'm always looking for easy summer salads to add to my rotation. This met all my criteria: easy, flavorful, and light. I halved the oil/balsamic mixture and added some crushed garlic. The only thing I'd do differently is increase the balsamic vinegar.

not wild about this one. Both my husband and I thought it was just too vinegary tasting. I followed the recipe exactly this time but next time I would cut the balsamic at least in half and maybe sub lemon juice for some of it.

Tasty-Easy and Crowd Pleasing! This dish is SO easy to make and brings in lots of smiles. I made it the morning of our BBQ dinner, and the flavor really came out by the time we served it. The next morning...it was even better. Make it the night before your event. Great way to use up the extra basil and tomatoes in your garden!

This was a great summer picnic dish. I made it the night before and packed it in a cooler for the day. Everyone fought for the leftovers. Delcious, easy, and attractive.

Really great side-dish with just about any summery meal. It's perfect for my vegetarian husband, because it has a lot of flavor and texture. What a great use of cous-cous. I followed the recipe to a T, and used sweet 100's from the garden. Tastes best after it sits for a few hours, and when served room-temperature.

I made this for a labor day potluck party. It turned out really well. I happened to have on hand a tomato basil flavored couscous and the color was out of this world with lots of extra basil. I did not use the small tomatoes as sugguested by another reviewer and I sure wish I had. Even with my so so tomatoes it was devoured. I will make it again with the proper tomatoes. One of my guests refused to leave until I gave her my printed out copy.

Took this on a picnic and it was a tasty side to our chicken main course. Here are my changes to brighten it up a bit: ommitted the green onion and added 1 T. lemon zest, 1/2 c. roasted pine nuts and 3/4 c. crumbled feta cheese. Also used only sweet 100s and small sun golds cut in half. Try this when tomatoes come in season this summer!

Good but not great. I added some smoked chicken to make it a main course salad. My family liked it better warm than cold. Good when basil is in the garden, but I wouldn't buy basil to make it

Yum, yum, yum! I've been making this for years, too - it's always the first thing I make in the summer with my garden's basil. I, too, cut back a bit on the oil, and wait till the last minute to chop and add the basil, so that it doesn't blacken (although I agree it's good the next day, just not quite as fresh looking...) This is a big winner!

this has become a staple in my repertoire since it first appeared in BA. In the summer when tomatoes are at their freshest it is one of my favorite ways to eat them. I have streamlined the recipe to maximize the tomato flavor, making the couscous with water and simply tossing with scallions, tomatoes, balsamic vinegar and a splash of oil. If I have fresh herbs they go in as well.

I don't think you CAN be too vinegary with balsamic vinegar if you use a great quality vinegar. That's key.

Rating: 3
I have to disagree with everyone about the dressing. I used 3 T each of oil and balsamic and thought it was too vinegary, and also kind of a yucky color. Next time I'll switch out some vinegar for lemon juice, which I think goes better with couscous anyway. Other than that, very nice, and pretty much what I would have just made up without a recipe. I added some black pepper-feta but it would have been just as good without. Also used vegetable broth instead of chicken.

My husband, who generally avoids anything with tomatoes, thought this was fabulous. I had to remind him to save some for me. This tastes even better if you let it rest a day or two.

After reading all of the rave reviews, I just had to try this recipe. Although I followed other cooks' suggestions and changed the ratio of balsamic and oil, and added extra green onions and a bit of fresh mozzerella, I have to admit that neither my husband nor I were crazy about this recipe....I think it was the combination of balsamic and basil with green onions that did not really appeal to me. However, having said that, I will probably make this recipe again, as it is quick, easy and an interesting change from the usual summer salads.

This is a fantastic side dish. I made it as written the night before and lighty sprayed ramakins with olive oil and then packed the couscous salad into them and covered them with saran wrap. At dinner I took them out and turned them out onto the plates (nice and molded by the ramakins) with the lobster tail and skewered prosciutto wrapped shrimp served with the best ever shrimp sauce. A great seafood meal for summer!

Oh my god this dish was so good I don't even know where to begin, especially given how easy it was to make. Overall it was simple fare with a fantastic meld of flavors. I only added about 1/4 of the balsamic/oil mixture (as previous comments suggested) and then added a handful of golden raisins to the dish.

This dish is always a hit. I've made it several times and have always received rave reviews. It is much better the second day, and I think cutting back on the oil to a 1/3 of a cup is key. I also find that using cherry or grape tomatoes (when plum are out of season) add so much more flavor when teamed up with the balsamic vinegar!

Rating: 4
This recipe has been my favorite couscous dish I've made yet. I received alot of recipe requests for this dish at a wine-and-cheese party. I substituted the chicken broth with vegetable broth (to make it vegan) and used half of the olive oil requested. It was very easy to prepare. This recipe will be a staple for cook-outs and parties!

I LOVE this salad. I made it to take to a Bridal shower the other night, and I've been finishing up the leftovers:-)I took the advise of other reviewers and used 1/3 cup each of oil and Balsamic vinegar. I added more of the vinegar after tasting. This salad has more flavour the next day! Another yummy salad to add to my favorites!!

I've been using this recipe for the last two years now. Its marvelous.. Depending on the strength of your balsamic, be careful of how much you put in. I generally add my balsamic last pouring it in straight from the bottle tasting it as I go! I also use "Fresh Cuts" Delmonte diced Italian tomatoes too - draining off the juice before adding! Hey, I'm all for short cuts!
