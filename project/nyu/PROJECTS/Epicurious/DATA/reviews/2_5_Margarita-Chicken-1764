This dish is fantastic! I make this dish regularly to rave reviews. I marinate the chicken for the full 2 hours and then sear the chicken. It makes the meat extra moist and flavorfull. I serve it with wild rice and grilled vegetables. I have never had a complaint and a monkey could make this recipe, great for first time cooks and newlyweds.

I prepared this in a similar way to A Cook from Leucadia, CA - I marinated the chicken (as indicated by the recipe - 2 hours tops), then cooked it in olive oil (I don't have a grill) & added a sauce made with chopped onion, garlic, tomatillos, tomatoes, cilantro & 1 chile in adobo. Perfect, fresh & easy. ITA that this is a good basic marinade for adding extra flavor to cooked chicken. I'll try melting some cheese over the top when I reheat it. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

I marinated the chicken for 24 hours and found the tequila to be overwhelming. I would recommend marinating it for less time, or perhaps, reducing the ratio of tequila to lime juice. It was interesting, but I prefer a marinade of pure lime juice.

This was a great recipe! I followed the way that the first user did and it turned out delicious! I definitely recommend this- its really tasty.

This was soooo good. I added a little olive oil, crushed garlic and cilantro to the marinade. The key is to keep basting the chicken. I used a grill pan, it worked great. I sliced the chicken and laid it on top of a sauce made from 1/2 avacado, 1 tomatillo, cilantro to taste and a dash of olive oil! FANTASTIC! I served with mexican corn recipe from epicurious. The whole meal is a YUM! Alot of eye appeal too!

I add a tablespoon of olive oil to the marinade. This chicken is great for fajitas or on it's own. My family loves it.

You need to have more fun with this recipe. I made up my own margarita chicken fajita recipe. I marinate the chicken for two days in a marinade made of tequila, triple sec, lime juice, cumin, mashed ripe summer fruit (plums, nectarines, and mangoes are my favorite), tropical fruit coctail, chili powder, and salt. You can roast, stirfry, or grill the marinated chicken. I stirfry accompanying onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes in a sauce made with lime juice, cumin, chili powder, salt, and oil. You can play with the recipe too. Add some fresh orange juice. Or throw in some fresh jalapenos. Make a spicy pico de Gallo to go with it. BBQ the chicken! Or roast and shred it for chicken tacos. And, of course, serve with real margaritas!

I like this; my wife LOVES it. Good tang but the tequila leaves a bit too much of an edge. Still, well worth having

I like the simplicity of this dish but have yet to make the recommended go with, Latin Confetti Salad, mainly due to the longer ingredient list. Although I plan to try that soon.
