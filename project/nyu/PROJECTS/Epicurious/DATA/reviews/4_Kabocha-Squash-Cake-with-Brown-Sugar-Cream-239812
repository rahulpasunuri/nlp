Light and yummy cake! I messed it up a bit because I didn't see the instruction to drain the squash. I blended the squash with the milk and put it in the fridge overnight, then added that (incredibly dense) mixture into the batter the next day. Intentional changes: I doubled the recipe, subbed sunflower oil for half the olive oil, and baked the cakes in paper baking cups. I might use a bit less sugar next time. Oh, and I added some maple syrup to the leftover squash mixture and served it like pudding -- yum!

These would be so delicious if it weren't for the overwhelming flavor of olive oil. I would make these again, but use all canola oil. Or 1/4 olive oil and 3/4 canola oil. Also, this makes a small batch so double up. Doubling it made about 12 small cakes in a muffin pan

Made a double batch as recommended. Used vanilla extract, 1/2 whole wheat, and reduced the sugar by about 1/4. Also added apples to half of the mini cakes which I would do again. Did not do the cream. Worked well in greased cups or liners.

Nice to have a very different dessert recipe in my repertoire. Make the cream! It's delicious and you'll think of other ways to use it. I don't think the recipe should say "from one 3 pound squash" when you could use a much smaller one to obtain the 2 cups of squash cubes. I recommend you choose the smallest Kabocha in the market unless you have a use for the leftover squash. Even a 2-pounder will be too large. I doubled the recipe and still only used half of my 3 pound squash. Thankfully, I had a plan for the rest: check out the Kabocha Squash Soup with Corn Relish on this site. The doubled recipe yielded 12 small cakes, which I baked in a muffin pan. The recommended 18 minutes resulted in a very moist, but cooked-through cake. Also, I substituted 5-spice powder for the cinnamon and was pleased I did so.

This was a great dessert - everything can be done ahead, and the flavor is wonderful. I had to use pumpkin because I could not find kabocha, but it was still great. Note - these cakes are small, so if you want more, you should double

We liked these little cakes - and what a fun way to use the Kabocha squash from the garden. I made them in mini-bundt pans, which made for a charming presentation.

These are so amazing. They were really moist and light with a very original, yet not too exotic flavor. My 2 year old kept requesting more! I didn't bother with the cream, but I can see how it would be great. Good to know that it wasn't too dry without it; in fact, they are perfect brunch-muffins on their own.

L-O-V-E this recipe! Make all the time! Definitely make with the kobocha squash; change out oil with canola and 1/2 quantity. Freeze the remainder of squash in snack bags (2 recipes). So easy to make!

Everyone else enjoyed the cakes, but I thought there was a little too much of an olive oil taste. Next time I will be sure to use a mild flavored olive oil and maybe sub out some of the olive oil for canola oil (or something of the sort). I doubled the recipe and still have a ridiculous amount of the puree left over, any ideas?

In case anyone else is thinking about it, it is possible to substitute canned pumpkin for the squash in this recipe. Add a dash of milk to it and proceed with equal volume substitution. The slightly spicy notes from the olive oil and beer are really good. They go well with either white flour as the recipe calls for or half whole wheat pastry flour. The finished texture is really interesting--a surprisingly delicate crumb for such dense little cakes. Even using pumpkin, the taste is distinctive. It is not the same as pumpkin bread or the more typical pumpkin cakes.

Fantastic! Don't skip the brown sugar cream!! It's what turns a good muffin into a truly extraordinary dessert. The cream is very silky, and has an almost ethereal quality to it. It would go great with pumpkin pie as well. Highly recommended.

This cake was great. I skipped the frosting, it really doesn't need it. Had to cook mine longer and add a little extra flour, I think that my squash was still too wet. Next time I will just microwave the squash instead of cooking it in the milk. I don't think it will make a difference. I used "whole wheat pastry flour" and it came out great. This cake has a beautiful golden color. I baked it in a loaf pan instead of ramekins.

wow that is most ridiculously good!! wayyy better than I ever expected. Used 1.5 tsp vanilaa extract instead of bean. Made cakes in muffin pan and cooked 15 minutes. Made 9 muffins. They came out beautifully with some Pam spray. You'll have TONS of squash so plan on doubling or tripling this and making some soup or something too. Really really delicous!

I made this cake as described, only substituted canola oil to save a few dollars. I made it in a cake pan instead of ramikins. It was moist and delicious. The brown sugar cream was to die for. My dinner guests said it was the best frosting they ever tasted. Will definetly make again. Next time I will use an acorn squash so I don't have so much leftover squash puree.

Made this "Latin Style" using a slice of calabaza from the mercado, a can of medalla, local spices, and azucar negro. True to latin style, I could not discard any of the puree, so I doubled the other ingredients and added a cup of oatmeal to soak up the excess moisture. The results were wonderful. Half were our dessert and the rest were gone by breakfast. We nixed the cream and ate them like muffins. A delicious, moist, aromatic, comforting cold weather sweet.
