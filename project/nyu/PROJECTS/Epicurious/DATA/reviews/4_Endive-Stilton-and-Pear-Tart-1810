I have been making this recipe for 5 years now. It never fails to impress. It is absolutely beautiful. Great for Thanksgiving or Christmas or as an appetizer at dinner parties. It is very quick and easy to make. The hardest thing you have to do is Crimp the puff pastry dough. My advice there is to just go for it, it always turns out fine no matter how bad it looks before going in the oven. Do leave an ample border when filling the tart. Perhaps a bit larger than half inch will make the crimping easier. I am certain it would work just as well with roquefort as it does with stilton. I know Stilton can be hard to find in some parts of the country. Don't be intimidated by the puff pastry dough (available at Trader Joes starting in November and many other places year round and commonly called Pate Feuilletee.) I agree that square is just fine and is what I do when making it in the US where round puff pastry dough is harder to find. I have made it square many times and it works beautifully. One of my absolute favorite recipes.

I was very disapointed in this recipe. I usually love the combination of these flavors, but when I made this the cheese overpowered everything else. Everyone at a dinner party tried this and nobody went back for seconds. If I were to make this again I would use a much milder cheese, maybe goat.

This is an excellent recipe, I made it the first time many years ago and since then I "find" it in my recipe box and rediscover it with great pleasure. It impresses my guests and most of all it impresses me... It is simple, fresh and tasty. A must.

This recipe is very easy, very delicious, and looks very impressive. My puff pastry was a big rectangle, so I just cut it in half to make the top and bottom, and cut 3 slits in it, it was gorgeous.

This is a keeper recipe. I shall bake it again as a marvelous appetizer for Thanksgiving day. Some notes. I sauteed everyting in a large soup pot. I do not have a frying pan large enough to hold all that endive. The endive ends up reducing quite a bit. I drained all the liquid produced by the sauteing of the endive and shallots and pears. There is no reason to cut 9-inch rounds out. I considered that more trouble than it's worth. I unrolled my defrosted puff pastry - 2 perfect squares. I brushed the bottom square with egg, added the filling, attached the other square, crimped all the edges,and brushed the top with egg. It is an impressive-looking tart. Once cooled, the tart cuts easily into pieces.

I loved this recipe. I baked it without the top piece of puff pastry and it tasted yummy. My guests enjoyed it also.

The puff pastry was more than I wanted to commit to, so instead of cooling the pear, endive, and shallot mixture, I added the Stilton and chives to the casserole I was using and baked the mixture at 375 for 15 minutes and served it as a dip for crackers - to compliments from everyone. I will certainly use this recipe again.

Tastes good, but not spectacular. The beautifully browned round crimped tart does look quite appealing, though. I made this because I needed to bring an appetizer to a party, but I didn't read the recipe carefully -- this is sit-down fork-and-knife food! Be sure to drain the endive mixture very well before you arrange it on the pastry round.

The tart came out great! A super accompanyment to wine. A great appetizer. Luncheon entree with salad or side dish that can stand up to game or beef. Great taste and easy to make!
