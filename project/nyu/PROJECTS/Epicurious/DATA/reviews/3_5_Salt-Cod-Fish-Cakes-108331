One of the best fish cake recipes I've made. Love fishcakes since I was a young girl when my great aunt.. Mabel, from Nova Scotia cooked them for me every fish friday. A great dish for Lent.

Excellent. Used a dill sauce to top the cod cakes off. A hit with my grown up kids. The parsnips made them special. I baked some potatoes and added them to the cakes. Had to make stuffed potato skins the same day. Great outcome.

As a lover of "comfort food" from home, these are pretty close to the ones mom used to make. I suggest adding a little dried savory or thyme as she used to do. The pickles are a great addition too.

As close to traditional as you can get! Here we serve fish cakes with chow chow (green tomato pickle) which might help Ottawa's taste less "bland". The cakes are not supposed to be spicy, just good, hearty fare. What is called "comfort food" now.

A little bland. It was good with tartar sauce though. Perhaps I soaked the cod too much?
