Very Yummy! I added Special-K to the oats & added vanilla extract & cinnamon to the butter mixture. With the addition of the Special-K, I needed to slightly increase the amount of the butter mixture. Dried blueberries & a small amount of crystslized ginger. I could not find the pumpkin seeds so I substited toasted pine nuts instead.

There's another granola recipe on this site that uses egg whites instead of butter, so eggs are a possible substitute for some of that butter: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Maple-Walnut-Granola-with-Dried-Cranberries-240430

I could not make this recipe as it is written as it just sounded too unhealthy with so much butter. I replaced the butter with 1/2 cup of orange juice and that seemed to give it the necessary sweetness and the moistness so it would toast up. I also just added the nuts to the oats and toasted it all together. Adding 1 tsp of cinnamon gives it a nice boost. I have also made it substituting the honey for maple syrup.

only ok, too much butter and could use a tad bit more sweetness whether honey or brown sugar. also, cook at a lower temperature so as not to burn.

I have a problem with the butter too. Will try with canola or grape seed oil. Also maybe some cinnamon or vanilla?

i love granola. i used olive oil instead of butter which imparted a great earthy flavor. threw 1/2 c. oat groats in too that gave it a good texture. coarse sea salt is a great addition too.

I make this regularly, and it disappears in a flash. It is great as a cereal but also as a topping. I have tried many granolas, both commercial and homemade; this is the best of them all!
