Quick and easy, yet not that good. Not sweet enough for our taste. Won't make these again.

I was dissopinted in the doughnuts. The spices in the dough were nice but the overall fried taste was not what I was expecting. Overall, it tasted too cheap-fried and would not make again!

Not good. Maybe I did something wrong but I let it rest and chill and still came out terrible. I'm not so great at deep fried foods though. . .

These are great doughnuts. They are quick and easy with lots of flavor. I used powdered buttermilk and there was no difference. These will definitely satisfy those crazy doughnut cravings without waiting for dough to rise!!

Best doughnuts I've ever eaten!!! And so easy and quick to make!!! I served these New Year's Eve and they were a hit. I used the cinnamon and not the allspice, and a corn-canola oil blend for frying. I am grateful to the reviewer who suggested letting the dough rest before frying. I actually prepared it in advance and stuck it in the fridge for about an hour, hour and a half until I was ready to cook them. That made the batter much stiffer and it stayed together in the pan really well. (In contrast, toward the very end when the batter had gotten to room temperature, it was goopy and didn't form nice round balls) They key to these is making the amount of dough you drop in small enough. This was definitely the problem that the cook from NC experienced. I used a medium size ice-cream scoop for ease and filled it with about a two teaspoons of batter. They formed nice round balls in the oil. Before serving I sprinkled them with powdered sugar. (We thought that was plenty--rolling them in it would have been overkill for this rich treat!). Also, it is very important to get the oil up to 375 before dropping the batter in. Impatient as I am, I started too early. The result was dough that had to stay in there a little too long to cook and tasted a mite oily. Aside from that first batch, these were the best doughnuts I've ever had. I'm not sure why--maybe because they were so fresh. They reminded me of Cafe du Monde's beignets (a New Orleans staple for those who are wondering what I'm talking about!), although it's been years since I've had those! I'm planning on making them at my next celebration. I'd like to try some partially dipped in ganache, some covered with flavored glazes, and so on. In fact, I'm having a lot of difficulty refraining from making another batch right now!!!

This was easy and quick, really good for a last minute donut craving my husband had. They kids loved them alos. Great way to get donuts with little effort.

We make these at the restaurant. I just made some batter and it is in the fridge. I eat these without the powdered sugar and they're great. I think next time, I'll experiment and use browned butter.

These doughnuts were delicious! Once they had cooled a little, I put them in a ziplock with sugar and cinnamon and shook them up to coat them. You could do the same with powdered sugar. I would definitely make this again- and I think I'm going to tomorrow. The only trouble I had was with keeping the oil at a steady temperature, but I suppose this comes with practice.

Quick and easy, makes a nice old fashioned doughnut hole. My family really liked them. I rolled them in powdered sugar.

This recipe was easy and fast. I let the dough rest for about 10 minutes while the oil heated. This seemed to allow it to puff up and thicken a bit, so it was easier to scoop. Also, I used a melon-baller to scoop out the dough. This gave me pretty uniform balls. My girls loved them rolled in cinnamon-sugar. Will definitely make this again.

This was my first attempt at making doughnuts, and I was somewhat disappointed. I think my biggest mistake was making the doughnuts too large because even after the outside was very dark brown, the inside was still gooey and uncooked. And while they did have a nice taste when warm (even though they were half raw), they transformed into bland lardballs after they had cooled. If I were to make them again, I would definitely make them smaller and eat all of them right away, but I don't think I'll go to all that trouble when Krispy Kreme is right down the street.

Very easy, quick preparation and super yummy! I actually made one batch and those were eaten so quickly that I had to make a second one! Don't omit the fresh ground nutmeg it really adds to the flavor. I also add a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.

These were fun to make and yummy to eat! They didn't really come out round for me, but they still tasted good. I can't wait to make these for my friends. They are especially good with the powdered sugar on them.
