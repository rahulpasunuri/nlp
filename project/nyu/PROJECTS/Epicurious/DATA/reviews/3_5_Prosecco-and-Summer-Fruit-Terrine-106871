I have made this numerous times and it always comes out beautifully. Several times I have given this as a gift. A favorite of nearly everyone I know. To the cook from Santa Fe, In polite society one never pushes back their plate. It just is not done.

I just have a question - since the wine is cooked, is this dessert safe for kids to eat?

I made this dessert to follow a meal of fried foods. It was the perfect compliment to the fried fish, fritters, onion rings, etc.; it was very refreshing. I used 1 large can of mandarin oranges (per another's suggestion), fresh blueberries, blackberries, and halved green grapes. I'm not great with presentation, but I tried to do a nice layering with the grapes on bottom/top and orange/dark fruits arranged in an alternating pattern, and it turned out beautifully. I would call it an elegant and refined way to experience a simple childhood memory. Jello for adults with infinite possibilities. Everyone enjoyed this treat so much, they ate it with their fingers later in the evening. I call it a home-run.

I have made this several times and it has always been extremely well- received. No matter how much I make, nothing remains at the end of the night. It has been fun to vary fruit, as much for the taste and textural variations as well as for the changes in shape and appearance. Can't go wrong! Healthy, light, entrancingly beautiful... It is pretty presented in a big or individual rounded bowls, loaf pan, or inverted (slightly slanted) Pyrex dishes. My favorite version was for a dinner for friends the night before their wedding. I used every heart-shaped serving dish I could find or borrow. I made each dish in two stages, and used reddish berries in a first thin layer so that there was a reddish glow to the overall appearance. It was fine that other colors of fruit showed through, as that reddish covering was defining. I wish I had done as some other reviewers have done and used a bit extra gelatin. I am eager to try as gelled Sangria as another reader has suggested.

I added to the hot prosecco mixture * 3 soupspoon of honey, plus * 1/8 teaspoon of orange blossom water (found at Middle East market) and * the skin of 1 orange cut in julienne and cooked (cover the orange peel julienne in cold water and bring to a boil, strain and repeat 2 more times). I made several times and it is allways a huge hit.

Used halved Bing cherries, seedless red grapes, strawberries, peeled nectarines, red raspberries, blackberries, and blue berries in a clamshell mold instead of a loaf pan, it looked fabulous when unmolded! Followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect, not too sweet, set perfectly overnight, and is a great do-ahead hot summer night's delicacy with a stunningly beautiful presentation!

I just made this for a 4th of July barbecue and it was a hit! I had no trouble with the gelatin setting and used strawberries instead of grapes along with white peaches in the spirit of the holiday. It was bright and light and not too Jello-y; brilliant summer dessert!

Won't rate because I haven't made it yet (certainly will come summer). IF YOU CAN"T GET THE GELATIN TO SET, remember fresh pineapple,papaya, kiwi, or figs contain enzymes that prevent the gelatin from setting up. either cook the fruit first or used canned.

It was really great but needed more gelatine to set firmer on the top section. I used non-alcoholic sparkling and it was yummo!

Made this with raspberries and blueberries alone, in honor of Independence Day, and it was a HUGE hit! The color was beautiful, texture just right, and everybody raved at the lovely presentation (unmolded from a loaf pan, berries 'round the edges). I had made a back-up dessert, just in case, but it went untouched. I couldn't find Prosecco, so used good ol' Napa Valley sparkling wine and it was great.

I have made this recipe many times and it is so easy and I get rave reviews each time. I use frozen fruit (peaches, manago's, berries when not in season)I do use fresh grapes. I always make it in a loaf pan or terrine and have never had any problems with it sticking. The trick is to use a shallow say 4 to 6" tops. It will be more transparent and really show off the fruit inside. The taste is light and sweet being made with the Italian wine and not heavy at all. Really nice change from the usual and once you make it you will make it again.

Divine Dessert for a late summer dinner party!! served with a blackberry sauce on the side-- Have made it many times when july/aug fruits are at their best- but also made it in last december to follow heavy xmas eve dinner-- used grapes and some berries from Chile- still wonderful and festive.

Beautiful, tasty and great for a summer dessert. This dessert is especially good for those guests who don't like more traditional, sweet desserts. In fact, if I were rating it based exclusively on my own taste buds, it would probably get only 2 forks but the fact that it is so pretty AND was so appreciated by several non-sweet-eating guests, makes it a 3.

Made this for a large barbecue as the "low fat" dessert. Used a large straight sided glass bowl,didn't unmold, just decorated with fresh mint and doubled everything. I didn't use peaches.. the color was great with Blackberries, blueberries, strawberries and green grapes. It was wonderful and had many requests for the recipe. It was NOT like jello at all.. in fact there was lots of fruit and not much "gelatin". It sparkled and I will be making it again, in individual molds next time for a smaller group.

This is a light, refreshing dessert. I followed the recipe exactly and had some problems getting all the gelatin to desolve but it still set up perfectly. I even used bing cherries and still no problems. The dessert would have looked exactly like the picture except the cherries tinted the gelatin pink. I rated this as 2 forks simply because this just wasn't that special. I really felt like I was serving my guests jello. Despite the pretty presentation, the summer ripe fruits and the delicateness of the Prosecco, it still looked and had the mouth feel of jello. I won't serve this again to guests and I don't think I'll go through all the trouble again for just myself and my husband.

This was so easy to make! I followed the exact directions without a problem. I put one layer of fruit down, and also layered it so that there would be fruit against the side, then poured in part of the mixture. I put it in the fridge for about 5 minutes, removed it and then poured the rest of the mixture in along with fruit. The final result looked just like the photo. Very refreshing!

This makes an excellent dessert in a pretty glass bowl and doesn't have to be unmolded. I have a problem with the proportions though - it calls for 2 3/4 tsp gelatin from 2 1/4-oz envelopes, but each envelope contains 2 3/4 tsp! This explains why it doesn't set up very well. Also 4 cups of fruit with the stated proportions of liquid and gelatin is way too much. To look like the pictures and to use an 8-cup bowl use 4 cups of fruit, double to rest of the ingredients (using any sparkling wine or ginger ale with less sugar) and use an extra about 7 teaspoons of gelatin. To make the small size - 2 cups of fruit and 4 tsp. of gelatin - too gelatin would make it rubbery. Could it be that Gourmet didn't test this recipe?

I followed the recipe exactly, but the geletin wasn't as set as I would like it to be after 8 hours of chilling. I made individual ones and a few of them broke upon unmolding. But overall the effect was beautiful and the taste was really refreshing and summery.

lovely. I used cheap sparkling wine, and it was just fine. One bottle will make 2 desserts...it's a shame to waste the wine, otherwise. Also, I put it in a bowl, not a loaf pan, and when it was "decanted" it looked beautiful.

DON'T USE MARACHINO CHERRIES! They sunk to the bottom, unlike everything else and it made it look dumb. I also used serveral types of berries. Very pretty. Blackberries make it look special.

Summer's almost here and this dish is so refreshing. I made it last summer with that new plum/apricot cross called "Pluots". It was a winner! Perfect when you want a light dessert that's pretty, too. Used a Moscato di Asti this time and have used sparkling cider when making this for the kids. Everyone loves it.

I made 16 individual cups for a dinner party. 4 of them with Jello for the kids. What a hit! I added some extra gelatin for insurance. I unmolded them earlier in the day, and set them out on a cookie sheet and back in the fridge until dinner. Don't use pineapple or kiwi - it won't gell. As for the El Paso cook and the Heineken - I think she probably meant Henckel Trocken - a sparkling white wine.

Rating: 0
I made this dish, but I omited the fruit, the sparkling wine, and the plain gelatin. Instead I used lime Jell-o. I prefer the "quick-set" method. Lacking in patience, however, I just slurped it up in liquid form using a dirty ladle. My teeth are still green!

This is a great, refreshing recipe. My liquor store was out of Prosecco, so I used a dry California sparkling wine. This was a HUGE hit. It is beautiful and could probably serve as a centerpiece on a buffet or table.

I thought this was too sweet and VERY alcohol-y. I'll cut down on the sugar and possibly dilute the prosecco with sparkling water next time I make it. I would also increase the fruit/gelatin ratio...i think there was too much fruit not enough gelatin with this version.

MADE IN A FLEXIBLE,LOAF PAN AND MADE A PATTERN WITH THE FRUIT ON THE BOTTOM, ADDED ABOUT 1 INCH OF GELATIN AND LET SET IN FRIDGE FOR ABOUT 25 MINUTES. ADDED THE REST OF THE FRUIT-CAME OUT BEAUTIFULLY WITH THE DESIGN OF MANDARIN ORANGES, RASPBERRIES, BLUEBERRIES, AND BLACKBERRIES ON THE TOP. GUESTS LOVED IT.

I made this and really enjoyed it. I made the "loaf" version and was really surprised at how much fruit was in it. It set up beautifully and was very easy to make. This is the first time I have had Prosecco and love it as well. DOn't hesitate - try it.

I made the recipe using the loaf pan but next time would probably do the individual cups. It looked like a science project and was a lot of fun to make and eat. Two forks because it fell apart when I sliced it up-probably my fault, not the recipes...we laughed and the dessert caused quite a stir, I mean wiggle...everyone should try this at least once...

This is a luscious summer fruit dessert. We used local NH peaches, blueberries, and melon; and added red seedless grapes. I do not understand the comments of some reviewers on here. There is no resemblance to commercial Jello. Gelatin is an esteemed ingredient in many classic dessert and savory dishes. I followed the recipe exactly and it set up beautifully. There are lots of alternatives to Prosecco (which I happen to love). I think a good German Riesling would be lovely. I also think water would be perfectly fine. Perhaps a sparkling bottled water would work just as well

Rating: 3
I loved this dessert and I am absolutely not a fan of Jello per se. It was quick and easy and, in 6 individual dessert cups, set in just a couple hours. I do have a question - is this an appropriate dessert for children (or pregnant women)? If not, what "virgin" alternatives to the Prosecco might work?

Rating: 3
The possibilities of the recipe are staggering. Made both the terrine and individual serving versions for a large dinner party. Ran out of Prosecco and substituted Heinecken (I know - NOT the same thing - but was desperate) with more sugar & raspberries simmered in (be sure to strain out the seeds), and the gelatin ended up a beautiful pink raspberry color and still tasted great!

well, i didn't make it, but i'm definitely going to try it! a good friend brought this dish to a party i was hosting on a hot summer night -- WHAT a success! light, refreshing, and such a unique flavor! a total treat. she used peaches, raspberries and blueberries and made it in a loaf pan. it came out after a little nudging and some hot water. and according to her, it was very easy to make. yum yum yum. (and to the person who is turned off by the jello aspects... geez, open your mind. just because cheez whiz is the nastiest stuff on earth doesn't mean you'd reject a melty brie out-of-hand, right? same thing...)

for the new little foodie that was appalled by the jello type aspect of this dessert I assert that you need to expand your culinary horizons. Simplicity is the hallmark of truly fine cuisine. Most cooks, as they mature, find that they want to make simpler recipes that highlight the natural flavors of a dish. As for terrines, they are a hallmark of french and russian high cuisine. Many bavarian desserts like Charlotte Russe which would no doubt impress a beginner are just fancy dress gelatin numbers.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I plan to. It looks beautiful and sounds simple. For the cooks who had a hard time getting their molds to gel: I have read that fresh pineapple and kiwi will prevent gelatin from gelling. Perhaps the acid in some of your fruit reacted with the gelatin.

Visually stunning!! LOVED the flavor!! Went to the Farmers Market and got all fresh fruit: peaches, strawberries, blueberries and bananas. Made the individual molds - got rave reviews at a summer dinner party for old high school classmates.

This was fantastic! I used Bellatore Gran Spumante from CA, which was inexpensive and tasty. I used canned peaches in heavy syrup (drained) because the fresh ones weren't the greatest, and I added plump blueberries and beautiful strawberries (cut in half). I layered the fruit in a 1.5 quart glass loaf dish, paying special attention to how the fruit would look from the outside. Everyone loved this dish, and it was simple and stunning!

I also had this collapse on me, TWICE, once in individual cups and again as a "loaf". I followed the recipe to the letter, and was very disappointed. I don't know what went wrong, but it did taste good and am glad others got to enjoy it. I may try ONCE more if someone can tell me the secret. (Could it be Texas in August?)

I am NOT a fan of gelatin, but this was really good. I made it yesterday to take to my book club for dessert, and everyone loved it. It looked beautiful (in the terrine, I had a hard time getting it out of the glass Pyrex) and it tasted great. The Prosecco really comes through, but it's not overpowering. I used more fruit and really packed it in--peaches, blueberries, blackberries, and strawberries. It was quick and easy and looked amazing. I'll make it again.

I've made this recipe twice - once in the form of a terrine, using Prosecco, and once in individual molds, using Asti Spumonte. The Prosecco version definitely tasted better, but the individual molds made for a better presentation. I'm going to do it again, using Prosecco, and make it in a round mold so that I can pile fruit up in the center. It will look great on a dessert buffet table.

Eeeeeeew. I didn't make this. I was served it. Jello, as a concept, is bad enough. I thought the 1950's were over? What is this? I also thought Epicurious had more class than this. As for my poor hostess...who was going, apparently, for a retro-meal...when the six of us at the table took polite bites and pushed back our plates, she galantly brought out a tub of Ben and Jerry's.

Truly light and refershing. Have made them individually and in a large mold. TO TULSA-- I found 8 oz stainless individual cups by AMCO and unmolded them. A half a minute of running hot water on the outside of the cups and they slid right out and looked beautiful.
