Like many others, this was my first time cooking duck and I was hoping this would be a good starter recipe. The sauce was delicious and very easy; just put everything together and let it sit on the stove for 30 minutes. I followed the reviewers' advice and used 3/4 tbps chipotle and i removed the seeds so it wasn't too overpowering. The duck, however, is something i need to keep practicing. I don't have a broiler pan (never came with the oven and never bothered to get one) so i seared it in a cast iron skllet skin side down for 5 minutes, and then put it near the heat in a 400 oven for 6 minutes. The texture just wasn't right, so next time if I do this I'm just going to invest in a broiler pan. I rated it delicious because of the sauce and the ease of making it, and because I think i would have been pleased with the results if i had followed the instructions better. The last thing i'll say is that the dish needs to be served HOT. once hte sauce and duck cool just a few minutes i felt the difference. i can't explain why, it just didn't taste as good while it was cooling. served it with brown rice/quinoa mixture and a side of baby carrots. if the duck texture had been better (my own fault) this would be a great recipe. i think the sauce can be used for a LOT of other things i.e. chicken so it's worth saving.

The sauce is very nice and oh so easy. We weren't amazed by it, but it was a nice change of pace and a great way to use up oj. I served it on cornish hens; didn't make the duck. I probably won't make it again...not cuz it wasn't good, just not inspirational enough to go out of my way to find the recipe again.

Review: Fantastic! Made three times. Over 20 people tasted, and loved. Duck: The best duck breast to start with is a Magret  the dish went from excellent with fresh duck breast to FANTASTIC with Magret. We ordered the Aged Magret de Canard from Hudson Valley Foie Gras. http://hudsonvalleyfoiegras.com/foiegrasmarket.html Do not overcook the breast  think of it like beef steak not chick breast: Medium to Medium Rare. If you dont like it M/R or M you can cook it longer. But do yourself a favor and try it M/R and M first. Sauce: When doubling the sauce, do not double the salt! I ruined the sauce  it tasted like a salt lick - had to cut it in ¼s and add all the ingredients to save it  which we used for other dishes because it is that good. I used Trader Joes Grade B syrup which is dark amber. It thicken just great so long as it was constantly stirred over steady heat. EXCELLENT!

I made this 2x so far. I intend to make it for the holidays. Sauce is exceptional altho, it never thickened up to the consistency of caramel like I wanted, so I used 1 tsp cornstarch after the sauce had been chilled, and rewarmed to a low simmer to bring it to the right thickness. LOVE LOVE the sauce. I found the broil method too smokey- I got better results pan searing (make sure you cross hatch the skin, without cutting the meat) and then finishing by roasting at 400degrees for 5 min, and resting. I skipped the cloves and added star anise. Served for a dinner party with silky skinless goat cheese mashed potatoes, and roasted asparagus. Mmmmm

My duck was a little tough (I'm quite sure this was a result of the duck itself, not the recipe) but the sauce was *excellent*! I made about half the recipe, used about 3/4 Tb chipotle with the seeds scraped out. We were pouring it over everything and are considering making a jar of it just to have around!

I can't figure out why everyone loved this recipe. I used 1 tablespoon of chipotle chiles and made sure to take all of the seeds out before adding. The sauce was overwhelmingly spicy...and our family loves spicy foods. It was just not a good combination with the duck. There are much better duck recipes on this site.

Wow! This was outstanding and so easy to prepare! This was my first time cooking duck breasts. I followed the recipe as written. The breasts were a perfect medium-rare. The orange chipotle sauce is perfect with the duck -- for us 1 TBS of chipotle chile was perfect. This is definitely a keeper. It can hold its own against any restuarant. I served creamy mashed potatoes with a little goat cheese mixed in; fresh fava beans dizzled with olive oil & sea salt; and a wonderful Red Beet and Sweet Corn Slaw (Matt Gordon of Urban Solace Restaurant in San Diego). Perfect meal! Will never again shy away from cooling duck breasts at home.

Really nice. Next time I'll back off the ancho a bit, perhaps to 3/4 Tbsp. And for those worried about all the smoke (which is typically for stove top), broiling produced almost zero smoke. Yeah, we can now eat duck breasts again, as our kitchen exhaust fan is almost non-existant.

Tried this recipe earlier today...my first time cooking duck. The duck turned out medium rare as the recipe described and the skin was very crispy. The meat was a bit tough though, which is probably due to the meat itself and not the recipe. The sauce was pretty good, but I think I would lessen the amount of chillies as it was quite spicy. I probably used 1.5 Table spoons and the recipe calls for 1 Tbl spoon. Next time I would either stick to 1 or maybe go 1/2.

I, too, scored and pan seared the duck breast (leaving lots of duck fat for all kinds of other delicious things!) so this is just for the sauce... which is out of this world. I made it a day in advance and had to be careful not to take so many tastes that I ran out. It both enhanced the duck and had a lovely sweet and spicy taste. So highly recommended!!

Was my first attempt at Duck, first time even eating it as a matter of fact! The wife had been saying she wanted duck and figured I'd give it a try. I thought the recipe was great, I unlike other reviewers thought the sauce was great but will add more chipotle next time. I too overcooked it a bit trying to get that crispy skin, but it still came out very juicy and satisfying!

Wow! I make duck a lot and this recipe was splendid! The sauce was awesome just as written, although the second time I made it I used Star Anise instead of cloves and it was also terrific. The broiling instructions were also amazing for cooking off the fat! I used to sear it fat side down first, but I'll always make it this way from now on. Crisp skin and very little fat.

I did not broil, but put skin side down in a hot cast iron skillet for five minutes, then into a hot oven for another 5 minutes. PERFECT Loved it

I love duck but it's my first time ever making it at home. I had smallish duck breasts, maybe 4oz each and broiled them for the shortest time given. While the meat was tender and delicious, it was cooked to medium well and I really like my duck medium rare. While I am excited to broil duck breasts again, I think I would find a different sauce. This one had an unpleasant bitterness to it. I think a balsamic glaze of sorts would work better for me.

Up front--couldn't find duck breasts anywhere so I roasted a whole duck. The review is pretty much for the sauce...it was fantastic! I only used half of the chipotles after reading the reviews and we definitely could have used the whole T, if not more. Delish!

Rating: 1
I was disappointed by this. My duck did get a bit overdone as the fat had not developed a nice golden brown colour after 8 minutes under the broiler. But the big letdown was the sauce. Strangely bitter (I had to add a bit more syrup) and the chipotle didn't stand out enough. A recipe elsewhere on this site for a cilantro chipotle sauce (for pork) had a far more vibrant taste with contrasting sweet and smoky-spicy flavours.

Rating: 4
BTW, unless you like to gnaw on cinnamon sticks, I think it should be obvious (although they said nothing of the sort in the recipe) that you have to strain the sauce before serving. Who wants to nibble on chipolte seeds...

The sauce on this is to die for. Duck needs to be challenged by its sauce. That`s why you never see Duck In A Light White Wine Sauce. Most sauces are a sickly sweet blueberry, blackberry, etc. Some of those sauces are great; I`ve made them all. But this sauce is unbelievable for the smokey-orange taste that comes out. I kept the sauce on for a little longer to get it a tad thicker. In terms of the duck itself, I have a tendency to set my house on fire when broiling duck breasts. Therefore I have migrated to the barbecue, where I put my Muscovy`s skin side down for about ten minutes and flipped and cooked for another five minutes, all on Direct Low. Works like a charm and no 911 calls necessary. Enjoy!

Delicious. Mine caught fire in the broiler which created a tasty blackened crispy crust (and lots of smoke). Ended up using half fresh-squeezed OJ and half from a carton. My sauce took about an hour to reduce. Served over mashed potatoes.

Wow! Fast, easy and impressive, what more can you ask? Great for Christmas dinner, then I served the left over duck as "peking duck" with hoisin and scallions the next day, and used the extra sauce as a dip for grilled shrimp. It's the recipe that keeps on giving.

Excellent recipe only problem we had was the smoke from the duck fat set off the fire alarm - next time will barbecue the duck breast

I've made this twice now, exactly, exactly as written. Oh. My. God. I don't know if I have ever eaten anything more delicious and decadent and wonderful. My wife concurs. I served it with garlic roasted red potatoes and the mixed greens salad with apple cider vinagrette. I don't know what more you could ask for on this earth. If you are reading this, do yourself a favor and make it tonight!!

This is wonderful. Made it last night for dinner. Very easy and great flavor. Do need those juices in the sauce after the duck has rested. The sauce is spicy on it's own but with the duck, perfect.

Okay, so I didn't exactly follow the recipe, but wanted to share my twist. Was short on OJ, so I added a handful of pitted fresh cherries, then used my emulsion blender to blend into a sauce. Added a bit of red wine. This turned out amazing and went so well with the duck. Am going to try the OJ version tonight.

Duck: now demystified! Wow! I'm fairly new to cooking as a 24 year old guy, but I found that this was amazingly simple! After I found and dusted off my broiler pan, it went off without a hitch. The skin was perfectly cripsy, it was medium rare, just like in all the nice restaurants I've been to! Made some whole wheat couscous to acoompany and broke out some white wine. I 2/3'd the portions as I wanted to only use 2 1lb duck breasts which fed three perfectly, and it could have stood the full tablespoon of the chipotle peppers (i took some of the review advice and cut it down, even though I'm a total spice head), but overall it was hyper successful and a lot of fun to make. Took probably a little less than an hour too.

Wow, the sauce was delicious - citrusy and spicy. It went perfect with the duck. Cooking the duck breast in the broiler worked great. I followed the time for the Long Island and it came out perfect. The skin was crispy and the meat was medium rare. Plus it didn't smoke up the whole house as it does when cooking it on the stove top.

I make this for special occassions and special company, and no one knows how easy it is....instead I get raves and they say it is as good as a five star restaurant!!! Serve with wild rice mix, green veg., light salad, and VOILA!! *****'s are what you will get!!!! YUM!!

Living in France, duck is everywhere, so we come back to this one again and again. I go easy on the chipotles and scoop them out after the sauce has reduced, which minimizes the heat while keeping the smoky flavor.

This dish was a real treat. I wanted to put the duck on the BBQ but thought I should follow the recipe the first time I made it. Glad I followed the recipe! The juices from the broiled duck really finish the sauce. Prior to adding the juices, I thought the sauce was "fighting" with itself. Seemed a bit too sweet. But the finished product was delicious. We did increase the chipotle but we are "chili heads" and appreciate the heat. Served the duck slices over creamy mashed potatoes, with sauteed Swiss Chard (olive oil, sliced leeks and garlic) on the side. The husband gave it one of his highest compliments - "This would be good for company." Will be making this again.

I think the sauce for this recipe is too harsh. IMO, the spicy hot and excessively acidic flavors need to be softened. Instead of broiling, I panfried the duck breasts (as instructed by delicious frozen Bell and Evans boneless breasts from Whole Foods). Then I deglazed the pan with the sauce prepared as per the recipe. Off the heat, I stirred in 4 tablespoons of room temperature butter.

My husband and I just finshed this dish--we both thought it was one of the best ever. I did, based on previous reviewers comments halve the chipolte--and it was a perfect combo of hot and sweet. Will use for other meats too.

I made this with quail rather than duck and it was delicious. Do however go easy on the chipolte. The sauce was excellent but I wish it had been a tad less spicy. Next time I'll start with half the recommended amount of chipolte and then add to taste.

I made this for dinner last night and every piece was devoured. The sauce was nice -- liked the chipolte heat. Couldn't have been easier. My breasts only needed about 4 minutes a side and were medium rare.

Very easy and tasty. I have never cooked duck before and now my fears are over. I cooked it until 135 degrees instead of 130 and still found it very pink. I made it with curly kale which was easier to find than broccoli rabe and liked it a lot. The sauce I will keep and use on anything, as it is REALLY tasty.

I haven't actually eaten the duck yet but the sauce has made my house smell heavenly!! I will make this again just to get those wonderful smells! I know it will be fabulous and only hope my guests enjoy it as much as I will.

I made this with quail instead of duck b/c that's what I could find but really it's the sauce that makes the dish and I'm sure it would work wonderfully with almost any game bird and probably any game meat. Do go easy on the chipolte - they pack a punch - add a bit and taste, you can always add more. I also cooked the quail in a roasting pan and added the juices to the sauce and reduced a little bit which I think helps the depth of flavor.

This was excellent. Easy too. The sauce was delicious and complemented the duck breast perfectly.

I made this last night for my husband's birthday dinner. I like hot stuff but this was way too hot!!! Should I have taken out the seeds from the chipotle chillies? I cooked my duck breasts to a temp. of 140 degrees and they were a little over done for our taste. Was a little disappointed with the heat of the dish but I am willing to try it again to see if I can get the sauce right next time.

This is an excellent recipe. The flavors in the sauce blew everyone away...the mixture of chipotles and orange juice is brilliant...sweet and spicy at once. I have made it twice now in two different ovens, and in both ovens the broiling time was several minutes shorter than required in the recipe. It is hard to find a truly excellent recipe for duck for home cooks, and this one is that rare find. I will make it again and again.

vox4 from Toronto, I think you're right, that is what I grew up calling rape (pronounced sort of like RAH pay), now called broccoli raab or rappini. I usually steam my rape and then drizzle it with olive oil and sprinkle a bit of salt on top or steam it for less time and then throw it in a pan with olive oil, garlic, and a little salt. This would be a a perfect accompaniment to this dish.

To sigridur: the green stuff beside the duck seems to be broccoli rabe, also known as rapini. Very good sauteed in olive oil with a bit of minced garlic.

You may want to try this recipe again with the chipotle peppers! Chipotles are smoked jalapeno peppers in a thick tomato sauce called adobo. Look for them in small cans near the Mexican canned and bottled ingredients at the supermarket. You're sure to be suprised by the different taste with the original recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe for a duck, the sauce is outstanding. I made it with plain chillies, since I dont know those chipotle chillies are. Can anyone tell me what it is.? Also what is that green on the pictuere that the duck is served with ??
