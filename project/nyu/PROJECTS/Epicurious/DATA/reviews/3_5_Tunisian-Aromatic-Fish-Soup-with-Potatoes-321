The name of the recipe is so accurate. It is wonderfully aromatic with such simple ingredients. I used sweet potatoes instead of regular ones, forgot to add the lemon and always skip the mint and it was excellent.

Not bland but lemon juice too dominant. Try 1 1/2 teaspoon instead of 1 1/2 table spoon...

Very authentic Tunisian soup both in taste and in smell. I can't imagine what some may have done to cause them to find it "bland". Using a firm, stronger flavored fish like haddock eliminates any need for fish or chicken stock although fish or chicken stock will not ruin it. Although I added a bit more cumin and cilantro than the recipe called for, the only real change I made was substituting a tablespoon of harissa for the red pepper flakes. In my experience, it's the combination of mint, lemon juice, cumin and cilantro (not parsley) that gives it that North African flair. Chick peas instead of potatoes work well in the recipe, and makes it even more "Tunisian".

I make this occasionally using fish stock and clam juice instead of water. I also add some anchovies for more taste along with some Old Bay seasoning. I also use canned diced tomatoes as it is what ussually have on hand. It is an easy flavorful recipe.

Great stuff here. It delivers the promise - nicely aromatic, fishy and lots of spuds. Btw: DO NOT use canned tomatoes in these recipes - they infuse too much of their own flavours into the dish.

A very interesting combo of flavors with mint and cumin. Used a can of diced tomatoes and juice in place of the fresh and some chicken stock for part of the the water. I used parsley because part of my family seriously hates cilantro. A good, easy and healthy soup(might substitute white beans for the potatoes for a true low carb meal)

I found this to be a delicious, fast and healthy dinner. The only change I made was to use canned tomatoes instead of fresh ones. I don't know if this changed the flavor that much but I didn't think this soup was bland at all. I will definately make it again.

I used vegetable stock from a carton to add depth,omitted the garlic, and increased the amount of red pepper flakes.I found this soup delicate and well balanced. Very satisfying, NOT AT ALL BLAND.

Wonderful. I used fish stock, which (listening to other reviewers) seems to be essential for a full-flavored soup. I skipped the mint, went for more cumin and also added some sweet peas. It was flavorful, beautiful, and a snap to make.

Nope. I won't make this again. Flavor was only so-so. I tried to jazz it up a bit with a cilantro sauce I made--it helped some but could not recesitate.

I, too, found this bland. It smelled wonderful, but lacked flavor. Next time, I will add more lemon juice, more cumin and use stock. The first time I use a recipe, I like to follow it exactly. In this case, I should have listened to the reviewers and spiced it up bit.

This is very good. And easy. Eat with rice!

This recipe was wonderful, and did smell delicious whilst cooking. I did find, however, that the liquid had decreased dramatically by the time the potatoes were done. So next time I will double the amount of liquid - I used fish stock cubes.

This is a recipe I pulled from a friend's Bon Appetit years ago. Have made it several times and the result is sublime esp. if fish stock is used. I too double the amount of fish to make a substantial meal.

Simple and sooo good! Our apartment smelled wonderful while this was cooking. I disagree that it is bland - not everything is meant to be overpowering. The aroma helps the taste - it's a joint sensory effort!

I used fish stock instead of water and it was absolutely delicious! Very aromatic.

This was very bland, despite my having used cilantro ,not parsley, and twice as much of each spice/herb called for. It also needed about 2 times as much fish. It did smell nice, but no better than anything else made with cilantro does.

Smells great, looks great, tastes great!!! Made it a number of times. Added some leftover white rice to the stew last time, great addition. This is my favorite recipe from Epicurious so far.

Aromatic? My kitchen smelled WONDERFUL! I did not find this bland at all--mild, but superb flavor and a little bit of a kick from the red pepper flakes. I used cilantro, and imagine that the soup would have been very bland using parsley instead. An easy to make, good-for-a-winter's-day soup.

A bit bland. The mint disappeared among the potatoes. I added half againa as much fish as called for and it was roughly enough. I would add the herbs at the end and use more than the recipe calls for.

This is a great one pot meal and base recipe. I made it away camping and added some green beans. Perfect. Other times I've added red pepper. It even works without the mint. Try it with Sumak. A definate must for the reportoire.

This recipe sounded good but it's in need of modification. Start with a fish broth, add some mussels and prawns and the flavors will be great. As is, it's blah, with no body to the underlying broth and not enough interesting stuff inside. Pretty, though!

Certainly aromatic. I used juice of 1 lemon to make it more tangy and added more chilli flakes to give it more of a kick. I also simmered the soup about 20 min more than the stated time to make the potatoes softer. End result:Very good

This is light and delicious. I made it with salmon as well as white fish and it was great.

I've made this soup several times. It's great -- simple yet loaded with great flavor. It has earned a place in my "short list" of quick dinner soups.
