My husband immediately declared "I want this to a family tradition birthday cake for ever going forward." And my girlfriend - a major health nut - said, "Wow. I'm having a second slice, and I NEVER have a second slice." Getting the cake to absorb the liquid simply takes time. But it will absorb. Really great recipe!

Delicious!!! I'm an inexperienced baker and was still able to pull it off - just took a bit of patience getting the cake to absorb the liquid, but it does. A huge hit during a dinner party with guests who were diving in for second slices (probably not as Lake Austin Spa intended, but all the same...).

I loved this recipe and so did my family. Comimg from a latin family I was very nervous about there reaction and I was so excited when they all raved over this cake. I am happy it came out perfect and can't wait to make it again.

The recipe is not written for a beginner. However, it is easy to make and one of the tastiest lower calorie desserts I've ever had. I absolutely love the way this turned out! Some advice: 1. Have all of your ingredients ready (mis en place) 2. I used a round spring form cake pan and prepared it with oil and flour - I'd recommend doing this. Lastly, since I took this cake to a potluck, I cut it into serving pieces and then put them in a container with the milk mixture. I chilled it and it seemed to soak up the milk better that way. Plus, I didn't have to try to transport a larger and wet/sloppy cake. Unless you're looking for a special presentation, I'd cut into servings and then soak for AT LEAST 4 hours (more if you can). By the way, I've spent time in Mexico and have had authentic tres leche cake - this comes very close and you will mot miss the calories.

this is very easy, the bananas are optional and not needed. Used 1/2 cup coconut flakes with wet topping. Kept is same 8 x8 pan I baked in, punch large holes especially in middle and pour topping. For those not familiar with tres leches is wet moist cake.

I made this cake for a friends birthday. The sauce was amazing but the cake was a more dense than it should have been. So dense, that the liquid didn't soak into the cake as well as it should have. Perhaps it's because I didn't use cake flour. I used flour and corn starch. Regardless, it was still very good.

I've made other Tres Leches cakes before. I decided to try this one with the bananas and coconut. It's a great idea for this cake. I will make it again but since it came out a little dry and skimpy, I would double the recipe for a larger cake and then quadruple the liquid, since it came out a little drier than I'm used to. Add the liquid a little at a time until your happy with the saturation. It is supposed to have a somewhat grainy texture cake and very wet. I'll also quadruple the bananas in the recipe, they were very tasty.

I am currently in the process of making this cake so haven't yet tasted it. However, I have a few things I'd like to share. 1. What is a 6x8 cake pan??? 2. How can you arrange a cake on a platter and spoon 20 oz., over a pint, of liquid onto it? Doesn't work well on a platter. I read the comments before baking it and approached it hesitantly and with low expectations, but I don't expect it to be so bad I'll throw it away (i.e. A Cook from Toronto). I'm making it at my husband's request, and I know he will enjoy it regardless. Overall, I agree with the comment from Santa Monica, I would have liked a bit more instruction and detail.

This was a terrible recipe. I have baked many, many cakes and I threw this away

I made this cake last year and friends are still raving about it. I did not think it was too difficult. The cake texture was perfect. I would urge bakers to try this recipe if they want to impress friends and also discover an entirely new taste delight.

I'm not a serious baker - so I found that the recipe didn't give enough instructions. It's a fairly complex recipe - and mine didn't turn out very well! The cake was very dense and didn't turn out spongy in the way that tres leches cake should.
