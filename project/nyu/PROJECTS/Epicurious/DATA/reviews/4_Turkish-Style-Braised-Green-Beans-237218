This was easy and delicious. I'd cut down on the sugar or even eliminate it next time, and double everything else. I used only 1/2 C oil and could have used less. And next time I'd probably let it cook for a little with the lid off--we thought it was too liquidy, although maybe serving it with rice would solve that. We served it with warm pita and greek yogurt.

Excellent. Fresh green Romano beans are terrific. Reduce oil to 1/3rd cup. For tomato, seed, chop and reserve fluid that drains when you chop it. Add this fluid to the cup to make up the 1 cup water (or add in more tomato fluid up to 1 cup). After 30 minutes of simmer, begin to check if done.

This was really delicious and very simple. Made for our dinner club, everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. Made it early in the day and served at room temp.

Changes made to the recipe were 1/4 c. olive oil (could prob cut back to 3T) and half the sugar. Regarding cooking times...I cooked my onions down more (10 minutes) and I also sauted the green beans for about 3 minutes prior to adding the water, sugar and salt...also braised the recipe for 1 hour and 15 minutes. Used Great Lake green beans the first time around and they were particularly tough but the extra time did the trick. One last thing...once you have cut up 2 medium onions, they are larger in volume than the green beans...use the amount suggested in the recipe even though it looks like too much...it will be fine. Most of the changes were to try to replicate a particular recipe at the Greek Lady in Philly so this may not be "authentic" but it certainly came close to Greek Lady's.

I made this using a can of diced tomatoes and without the garlic. It was wonderful. I served it over some brown rice and would even consider throwing in some ground turkey or beef (as a Lebanese friend of mine does) next time for a complete meal. I was shocked at how even my five year old finished a plate of this.

Further to my comment on 11/08/09, I forgot to mention that I did not use 2/3 cups of olive oil-- not even close! I used a few tablespoons at most, just enough to saute the garlic and onion. It was delicious.

This was quite delicious and easy to make, although now that I've entered the recipe into a calorie tracking program I wish I'd gone a little easier on the olive oil! I also might cut back on the sugar just a bit.

One word--- YUM. So easy to make, yet tastes like you put way more into it. Has the kind of flavor that makes you keep wanting more. I think serving with the greek yougurt and pita bread is a must. Sopping up the juices with the bread is just another added treat. I may cut down on the oil next time... I just get uneasy using that much oil in my cooking. But, then again, it's probably why it was so good!

This is an excellent recipe. I decided to do it last-minute and had to use organic canned, diced tomatoes instead of fresh--but it turned out just fine. And yes, it's much better at room temperature.

I recently spent with a family in Turkey and this dish (I believe it is called taze fasulye in Turkish) was one of my top favorites. This recipe is EXACTLY like how I remembered it in Turkey - however I left out the garlic and sugar for authenticity. This is excellent on its own, spooned over some rice, or sopped up with a piece of bread. I liked it warm, but I'm sure it will be even better after it's cooled to room temperature. This is the only way I want to eat green beans from now on.

Loved it. A good side dish with just about anything but also as a vegetarian dish with a grain. Will make again.

Wow, made this with green beans and tomatoes fresh from the garden. It was perfect for those green beans that were a little bit tougher. Yum.

My Turkish husband introduced me to this simple but delicious dish. I agree with a previous reviewer that it tastes better the next day served cold. I especially like it with a dollop of yogurt on top.

Make sure you braise the beans for at least an hour, skip the garlic if you insist on "authenticity" and definitely keep the sugar. Better served the day after it has been cooked (bring to room temperature) with finely chopped italian parsley, a wedge of feta cheese and some crusty bread.

My guests didn't LOVE it, but I was thrilled. Really fantastic dish I would be happy to make again.

Shannon, I'm not sure what you excactly refer to by "Southern", but if you would take a look at the map (you're not Miss OSuth Carolina are you??), you would easily notice that Turkey is in southern Europe, on the same height as Greece, on the coast sharing a very similar climate with Greece, SOUTHERN Italy, Spain and France, thus all the ingredienst which you describe as "everything from a good southern garden" are available and widely used. The recipe is indeed very Turkish, maybe the addition of sugar could be a little less but other than that it is a very typical recipe. Saying that the recipe is Turkish does not exclude similar dishes in other cuisines, and the type of food which is described as "zeytinyagli" indeed describes a certain style of cooking vegetables, you have a wide variety cooked in this manner; i.e. slow cooked with lots of olive oil, lots of onions and sugar are musts, with or without tomato, and they are eaten cold or lukewarm, often with some lemon juice. If you'd visit a typical restaurant in Turkey (not like the Turkish restaurants abroad serving kebabs only) you could sea artichokes, beans, leeks, stuffed vegetables, eggplant, zucchini...you name it...all kind of vegetables (and yes, those from a "southern garden") cooked in this manner, eaten as a starter.

I make a very similar Med.dish w/1additional tomato and 2-3 slices smoked bacon. It cooks for 3 hours. My mom remembers her Italian mother & relatives making it and also broccoli. Salt pork or pancetta was used.

Zeytinyagli, vegetable dishes cooked slowly and for a long time in a lot of olive oil, are a course in itself in the Turkish cuisine. Traditions differ across the country, but it is eaten before or right after the main dish at room temperature or slightly cold, not as a side to meat etc. This recipe is actually a pretty good rendition. And it is really Turkish, believe me, Shannon_s. I lived in Atlanta for a year and the green beans almost always had bacon or ham cooked with them and almost never olive oil. I believe olive oil is not a traditional southern staple...

This is Turkish? Someone better tell my (and millions of other) Southern grannie. It incorporates everything from a good southern garden. I guess it sounds more exotic as "Turkish" LOL! I love these especially with roasted meat. Southerners dip white bread into the bubbling tomato broth as it cooks. Yum!

Very good, especially in the winter when "fresh"green beans are rather tough.Added chopped fresh mint prior to serving for a bit of zing.
