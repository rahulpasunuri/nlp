I was looking for a jicama salad and happened to have everything on hand for this. I saw the pork rinds and thought interesting so I tried it. I really liked the salad. I wasnt sure about the pork rinds so I put them on the side for people to add or not. I added them to mine but found it didnt really do anything extra for the salad. I would make this again omitting the pork rinds.

this was a very unusual and tasty salad, and it received rave reviews from everyone i served it to. but my recipe pile runneth over and, it just didn't stand out enough to make the the 'keeper' pile. i would recommend to anyone making it, to marinate everything except the radishes and add them at the end as the red in the skins gives the dish a pinkish cast.

This was an interesting, easy, and very tasty salad. My husband couldn't believe what was in it! I'll definitely make it again, this time for company.
