This is a wonderful recipe! I have been eating this for years. Grits are a Southern staple and not just for breakfast. Alot of these type of grits recipes came about because all people had was grits and they need a better way to cook them! we eat grits at any time of day at our house, and we at these with a blackened grouper with a parmesan cream sauce..... talk about good!!

I have not yet tried this recipe but will definitely. Just wanted to say to the Stow, MA cook thank you for your comment. People are always talking trash about grits but will happily eat their side of polenta. I used to work at a health food store in north carolina. There we sold milled corn in the bulk bin as grits. When i moved to San Francisco, that exact same milled corn was sold as polenta

Very tasty! One can decrease the time & attention required by cooking the grits in a microwave. Increase grits to 1 1/4 cups and decrease water to 4 cups. Cook on high for about 12 minutes, stirring a couple of times along the way.

Chicago- did you actually make this recipe, or did you give it only one fork because it seems gross to you? Please don't evaluate a recipe you haven't tried.

Wonderful complement to a savory fish recipe. This takes some time to prepare, but is well worth it. I had neither time nor inclination to seek out the "specialty" grits the recipe called for, and just went with the quick version, which worked out just fine, and cut at least 20 minutes out of the prep time.

Those of us who are of Italian descent (and those who know Italian food) will look at this recipe and say, "Yum! Polenta!" I can't wait to try this recipe. I'll take Laura from NC's advice and serve it with grilled fish.

To Chicago and others from northern regions, we in the south would not eat this for breakfast. It would instead be served as a tasty side dish for grilled fish or shrimp, and for DINNER! so ya'all try again at the right time of day, and enjoy!

I don't understand these people who've responded to this recipe--did you all leap out of bed and make these for breakfast? Rocket scientists, beware: garlic at 8am is predestined to "repeat on my" for hours. (Especially garlic toothpaste--if you didn't like this one, do NOT try the garlic toothpaste recipe!)

I should've listened to the cook from Chicago. Not only did these taste nasty but they repeated on my for hours...if you know what I mean.
