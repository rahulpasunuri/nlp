This dessert is absolutely great. I have made it many times, and everybody loves it. I follow the recipe exactly; it works for me every time. Just store the leftovers in the refrigerator, and heat them in the microwave 30 seconds before serving. Serve with whipped cream.

This souffle didn't work out for me. The texture wasn't right. I have had souffle cooking experience before. When I added the cornstarch the mixture went really thick. I think it's meant to do this but the recipe should have said.

i think the problem with this recipe is that you have to be more careful than it tells you. when warming the gg yolk, it began to scramble, and i think that pretty much ruined the texture. the flavor i liked (i too doubled the lemon). if i tried it again, maybe i'd try that step over a double boiler.

I was not impressed. It seemed more like a sweet lemon omelette than a souffle. Perhaps that's from using corn starch instead of flour. The flavor was boring -- just lemon and sugar. It definitely needs some kind of sauce as well. I will continue searching for a good lemon souffle recipe, as this wasn't it.

Double the recipe and make extra! Everyone wanted seconds. Light, elegant and delicious. Made per instructions in advance, and chilled. Baked after dinner. Served with warm blueberry sauce from this site. Definately a winner!

My family and I loved this dish! I used two jumbo egg yolks instead of 3 large ones and skim milk. Thanks to the other posters for mentioning to wait until the egg/milk mixture began to thicken before taking it off the heat.

Exquisite. I used skim milk to make a low-fat version and it was still great.

This is an elegant and simple desert. I prepared the base and kept it at room temperature and stored the separated egg whiles in the fridge. When i was ready to serve desert I finished the recipe (whip the whites and combine with base). I also served it with a raspberry coulis which is simple to make and adds a nice accent.

I cut the recipe in half, but used 2 yolks, 3whites. I also increased the lemon per other reviewers comments. I am a new cook so I would have appreciated knowing how thick the lemon base should be when you quit cooking it. I think I over cooked mine as it didn't fold into the whites easily. However, it was still yummy and I definitely will make again and work on my technique. I also made them ahead and kept them refrigerated until I was ready to bake & serve them. Worked great!

I loved the recipe and would give it a top rating after the adjustments I made to the recipe. I doubled the amount of lemon juice, added an additional two yolks and I also strained the lemon curd before folding in the egg whites. It came out absolutely perfect. I made in in advance and refrigerated half the portion and froze the other half. Either way, it is a great make ahead dessert and got rave reviews.

For all of the stress, I'm underwhelmed. I may have made a mistake and not folded in the whites too skillfully, however i found the taste one-dimensional, and the texture a bit gritty. Maybe a sauce could have helped. Any ideas?

What a fabulous dessert! It is impressive and delicious and easy -- a surefire combination. I made the souffles ahead of time, placed them in the refrigerator and brought them to room temperature before cooking. A definite keeper.

Nice summer souffle. I didn't even think of making them ahead, but it's not a bad idea. 2 of my dinner guests actually like watching me make them! I served the souffles with a warm blueberry sauce. Very light and flavorful.

You can make this in advance. Just refrigerate the souffles and bake when ready.

Question: I would like to make this souffles, but it seems like you have to make this right after a dinner and I don't think my guest would like to wait around while I prepare a souffle--any suggestions. I've never made a souffles, but it would be great to have a make-a-head souffles.

I've made this recipe a few times now. (It's too easy not to!) Once I made it with orange peel and juice in addition to the lemon, decorated with candied lemon and orange peel. I wish the recipe would have explained that the milk and yolk mixture would (and should?) turn "pudding-like" when simmered together.

I have made this twice now to rave reviews. It is light and tangy, and a souffle always wows the guests. I made it in a large souffle dish and served 4 people.

It is winter here in Australia. I prepared this dish after serving a roast lamb stuffed with English spinach and feta cheese (Tasmania of course). The souffle was light and tangy. A truly delightful finish to the dinner. It was not complicated. My guests are brilliant cooks. They loved it.
