Boil the potatoes. Beat them in the Kitchen-Aid. Slowing add in the liquid, rosemary, butter. Skip all the other nonsense. As long as you use fresh ingredients, you'll end up with a delicious dish.

Fantastic. I subbed the 1/2 and 1/2 with the cream and milk from cans of coconut milk and added about 3 heads of roasted garlic, too. This was fantastic.

Perfect texture and flavor! I added roasted garlic, as per the advice of some earlier reviews and that was a nice addition, but not necessary.

This made a great side to my crusted tilapia recipe. I reduced the ingredients for two people. I will definitely make this one again.

Hands down the best mashed potatoes I've ever made (and I've been trying new mashed potato recipes every Christmas for years!) I used 1 Tablespoon of rosemary and otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.

This is a wonderful recipe for mashed potatoes. The rosemary gives it great flavor, but is subtle enough not to interfere with other dishes. For a low-fat recipe, you can omit the butter completely. I forgot it once and the potatoes were still creamy and delicious.

Simply delicious and flavorful and so easy to make!

Served these potaotes with a spiral baked ham with Marmalade-Horseradish Glaze, also from this site. Infusing the cream with the minced rosemary is key. Added apprx. 1/2c. of coarsely grated longhorn cheddar for color, and additional layer of flavor. Would be good with any fresh herb that you happen to have on hand.

My husband loved this recipe, so much he asked me to make it again. Thanks to the other comments I also added fresh garlic and Parmesan cheese making this dish truly wonderful.

Made this Last night and They were phenomenal. I was really surprised how the flavor came through. I will make these a regular in my repitoire.

Delicious! I used Yukon Gold potatoes and riced 'em rather than mashing -- lovely consistency. I eyeballed the half and half and probably put a little less than 1.5 cups based on the watery results of others. It was fine, but I think it would have been fine doing the entire recipe. I did add two small heads of roasted garlic, but no garlic flavor really came through. Next time, I will slow cook the garlic in the butter and then add the mixture for a more powerful flavor. The rosemary flavor really does come through -- it's subtle but absolutely lovely.

Honestly, I found these potatoes lacking at first (they were a bit bland and too watery), but with the addition of garlic and cheddar cheese, they became the best mashed potatoes ever! Rosemary is my favroite spice, so this was perfect.

We had this alongside this year's Thanksgiving turkey, but as others have noted, these potatoes can complement many different entrees. I'll be making them again to go alongside the Herb and Garlic-Crusted Beef Tenderloin (also on this site) at Christmas. I also added a head of roasted garlic and will added another one the next time I prepare it, as we all love garlic. Awesome!

I've made this several times and it is one of the best mashed potatoe recipes I've ever made. The rosemary is subtle, but adds just the right note. I also love that you can make them ahead. And, as others have noted, you can make many alterations to this recipe.

We served this as a side dish for the "Filet Mignon with Merlot Sauce" and it was wonderful. My 10 year-old picked the reciped and made them. If he can do it, anyone can. We will definately be serving these again.

Had these wonderful potatoes with rack of lamb. Delicious!!

This recipe was good however it calls for way too much cream. I had 6 pounds of potatoes and still didn't use all the cream it called for as I found it too watery. Also, I used fresh rosemary and next time would use a bit more for flavour. Overall though, with some modification, a nice potato recipe to use with turkey.

I'm with you Visalia! These were great. I'm a little ashamed at myself that I hadn't thought about this before as it is so easy. I riced my potatoes and added the cream and butter the day before. I stuck the potatoes in the oven to warm and added the rosemary about half an hour before serving. Easy and SO good!

Can mashed pototoes qualify as a "dish beyond compare"?? These surely do...if you love mashed potatoes and you love the flavor of rosemary, you will love this recipe. After completion, do let the pototoes sit covered in the pan for at least 20-30 minutes to let the rosemary flavor really come out.

This was delicious and easy to make. The potatos were fine on their own, none of my guests needed to add any more butter or anything else to them, and the rosemary made them really fragrant.

These were great. I even used fat free half and half, and Smart Balance instead of real butter to cut down on the fat. They were still good.

Everyone found these delicious. I used exactly what was called for for everything but the potatoes and I added 1 tsp of minced garlic to the rosemary cream mix on the stove. I probably used only 3 lbs potato. Even with less potato I thought the recipe came up a tad dry, regardless of its good flavor. Add more butter or milk.

I love adding fresh spices to basic mashed potatoes. I am always pleased with the results. I have even added chives & parsley into the mixture to vary the taste.

Ok, here's the exciting thing about this recipe: you can do almost ANYTHING with it. You can leave it as is, you can add garlic, chives--there are SO many options! This is the perfect basic mashed potatoes recipe. I cut the potatoes into 1" cubes and cooked them for about 20 minutes (until nice and tender), then blended them with the butter and rosemary in a mixer. After I was sure the butter was incorporated I mixed the cream until it was nice and fluffy (oh YUM!), and lastly I scooped individual servings into ramkins and baked until the tops were golden brown. El YUMMO!

A good, solid, flavorful recipe that makes a good backdrop for spicier foods. Not every dish on a menu should blow out one's tastebuds...something has to play the low notes. For those of us who like more texture in our foods, though, don't bother to peel the potatoes. Just scrub them well and mix the nutritious peeling right into the dish.

I liked this recipe very much. It is just a little different.
