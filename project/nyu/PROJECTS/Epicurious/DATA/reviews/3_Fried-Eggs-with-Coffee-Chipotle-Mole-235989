Great breakfast alternative. I served it huevos rancheros style over a whole wheat tortilla topped with cheese and it was delicious. I have to admit I was a bit skeptical at first but in the end was pleasantly surprised by the flavors and ease of preparation.

I made this for my husband and he loved it. I also made it for my mother-in-law, my sister, her friend Angelique, Angelique's mothers daughters friend who was home recovering from a nasty fall while skiing in Aspen. Then there was Uncle Ladlee, and his boyfriend Tray, their dog, Mr. Tootle's, and a street person (never did learn his name!)who came right in from the street because those darned pork chops smelled so good. Everyone raved!
