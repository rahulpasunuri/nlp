Loved it! Sauteed some onions and mushrooms to add. Kept the sauce light and definitely cooked longer than 13 minutes. Even good heated up the next day. I definitely will be making this again!

I would make this again with some modifications. It was just too many strong flavors thrown togehter. I will pair the sausage and gorgonzola again but I will reduce the gorgonzola and leave out the olives. I added extra green pepper, which helped to cut the richness a bit.

I avoid Boboli at all costs, but made this with Bertucci's pre-made dough. I loved the flavor combinations, but it is a bit salty. I'll make this again, but I think it's too sodium-infused for my regular rotation. It would be a great hors d'euvre, though.

Absolutely fabulous! I made my own dough, used Aidele's cajun sausage, and also threw on some onion and mushrooms. I loved it. Very flavorful!

This is a delicious, hearty pizza recipe. I made the following changes: homemade pizza sauce, frizzled sage leaves (so yummy) and red bell pepper slices. I also used the Trader Joe's fresh pizza dough. Very tasty. Try it before you are dissuaded by the lower rating.

My husband and I loved this recipe! I will be making this again. I made my own pizza dough, and it definately needed more then the 13 minutes in the oven- still turned out great.

I used Pillsbury pizza dough instead of a pre-baked pizza crust and only cooked the pizza for 13 minutes as both the recipe and the dough directions called for. That was not enough time, at least in my oven, and the pizza ended up kind of a soppy mess, although the flavor combination was good. If using this dough again, I would probably cook it for about double the time. I forgot the green peppers and heeding the warnings of other reviewers that the pizza was too salty, cut down on how many olives I added. I think there's plenty of salt already with the sauce, gorgonzola, and sausage. Easy weeknight dinner--would make again.

this was simply the best!! gourmet pizza. I am going to make for dinner parties or even cut in small pieces for appetizer. I used thin BOBOLI crust and spicy turkey sausage to cut down on fat.

Extremely salty and the combination of marinara sauce and gorgonzola was not favourable. I still shudder when thinking about it!!

I have made this about 4 times and love it. I suggest using turkey sausage, it tends to be less salty, without loosing flavor (plus it has less fat!)

My husband and I found it a bit too salty for our taste. I don't think I'd make it again.

This pizza was super! Excellent flavor. Do not skip the fresh basil and use dried,no comparison.I used black olives because Kalamata were too expensive and had good results.

This is wonderful. A bottle of wine is a must with this pizza because it tends to be a little salty. I have made it twice to rave reviews. I did not have fresh basil, so I used dried. It was still very good, but fresh basil would make it that much better.
