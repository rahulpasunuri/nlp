We thought this was very good...I plan to make it again, but next time would probably saute the garlic with the onions. Browning the bread with the garlic just made the garlic overcooked, and I had to throw the garlic out. I cut the recipe in half and possibly used more bread than it called for, but the consistency was very good for me...

Outstanding recipe! Cut the chicken broth by 50% and it was a perfect sauce. Others found it bland. I believe that with the full amount of chicken broth it was too thin to really coat the chicken well.

I followed this as written except for using the sherry to deglaze instead of pouring it raw into the blender. The sauce was terrible and very watery from the 2 cups of broth. I consider myself a very good cook and excellent when it comes to following recipes, so I don't take the blame for this one. Looks nothing like the picture. At least the chicken was tender and edible, but the sauce wasn't.

I thought the sauce was delicious, and could eat it with a spoon. BUT: this recipe was included in the Fast, Easy, Fresh section and was a little more involved and made more dishes than an easy weeknight meal. Also, the day that I made it the sauce seemed watery and the bread/almonds were a bit gritty. By the next day, when the bread had absorbed the liquid, both the flavor and texture were improved. I would definitely make this again, but I would make the sauce a day ahead.

Some of the other reviewers seem to be criticizing this dish for lack of having a big kick. If that's their narrowly focused criteria, they're simply cooking the wrong dish for their pallets. This dish is fantastic -- but it is much more subtle. Chicken in Garlic-Almond Sauce has an amazing DEPTH OF FLAVOR -- and that can be even more amazing and satisfying than a one-note flavor that says "BAM"! I made this recipe as written, with just a few tweaks to it. I added a 6 cloves of garlic instead of 4, and in the last 15 minutes or so added some roughly chopped sun-dried tomatoes that had marinated in garlic oil. (That was a really good addition for color, flavor and texture.) Also: I recommend that you don't just "garnish" with parsley; add a handful of chopped parsley near the end of cooking, and let it cook into the sauce. Be sure to top each serving with sufficient sauteed slivered almonds too, as both the flavor and the texture of the almond topping is important to the dish. This one is a keeper. Hope you enjoy it as we did.

Always looking for something to do with chicken. This sounded good but it was kinda blah. Will make it again but use more garlic, saffron, paprika (from review) or something to give it some depth. Its ok but needs work

Not a keeper. Try the Apple, Currant & Caraway Stuffed Chicken Breast recipe on this site, if you haven't already done so. Now that's good!

I think I will try this next week! Just a friendly tip before cooking this it may be a good idea to taste the apples all mixed together then add salt, sugar as desired..or not at all!! 1 1/2 tsp seems like quite a bit of salt.

Usually, when I chose a recipe, I make it as written the first time and then try modifications suggested by reviewers or my own tastes after that. This time I tried the recommendations right away and it just didn't work. The sauce was grainy and sort of bland. I paired it with Ginger garlic green beans and that has a very strong flavor that overpowered this dish so perhaps it was my own mistake.

I want to make this for Halloween. Anyone have suggestions as to what to serve with this?

Good flavor, used sliced almonds instead of slivered. Thought the sauce could be thicker. Maybe using a coarser bread would do the trick. Lots of sauce, maybe a bit too much. Served with pilaf.

I had the benefit of comments in three prior reviews, so when I made this I changed things up a bit. First, I processed the almonds, cooked garlic/bread mixture, black pepper and saffron together *WITHOUT* any liquid. I did not add any salt at all because the broth I used was already plenty salty. After I browned the chicken, I added the sherry to the pot to deglaze it and cooked it down to about 2 tablespoons. Then I removed it to the bowl with the chicken. I added a bit more olive oil, then cooked the onion until translucent. At that point, I added the almond/garlic/bread mixture, the browned chicken/reduced sherry and the broth to the pot. This prevents any spillovers from the blender and cooks off the raw alcohol taste of the sherry. We try to limit our carbs so I did not serve this with any rice, bread or additional carbs at all, the sauce was great on its own. We also had a greens salad and pinot grigio and a quince mousse for dessert.

A hit in our house. I made a few mistakes: the broth overflowed the processor, so the sauce was think-but thined out in the cooking.I used a good Italian bread, which may have had more body than American white. Used tumeric to give it a golden color and added some hot hungarian paprika to give it some umph.There is enough sauce to double or triple the amount of chicken.This tasted better on the 2nd day.It's an easy recipe that we'll make again

This did not taste anything at all like I was expecting. I used sherry and that's pretty much all I could taste, there was no garlic or almond flavor at all. Very surprisingly bland. It does make a ton of sauce which. Is nice over some rice if you can handle the flavor of it. The saffron sure did add a pretty color to it though.

This was ok. I was looking for a bolder flavor. However my picky eater loved it and had seconds. It makes lots of sauce! I served it with couscous which held up well to the sauce.
