I used rice noodles just because I think spaghetti is a little weird for a peanut sauce. I also used regular peanut butter. I really enjoyed it. I also made sure to flush the noodles with cold water so that they didn't get all suck together when I added the sauce.

I don't know what I did wrong but this turned out to be one gluey tasteless mess. And I followed the recipe...I did not even serve it to the kids!

Love it. Great way to use up leftover veggies at the end of the week. Could easily make without shrimp and make a perfectly satisfying vegtarian meal. I like the idea of adding a tsp or two of sesame oil ... thanks for that!

I make this recipe as written except for adding a bit more ginger and garlic and my family loves it. I make it with tofu and it is one of the few meatless recipes that gets raves from my college aged son. I have never had problems with the texture. This dish is colorful, tasty, quick and healthy. It would be easy to make it a bit hotter if you prefer. Try it.

I found this recipe a little gluey and, despite doubling up on the chile sauce, rather bland and uninteresting. The crunch of the snow peas and shrimp (plus some raw bean sprouts and green onions I sprinkled on top) was a nice contrast to the soothing noodles. Jennifer Martin's Thai Noodle Salad (on this site)is still the standard bearer for peanut noodles as far as I'm concerned. I'll just add the shrimp and snow peas to it.

This was delicious and easy. We made it with rice noodles - yummy. Our kids loved it. Had to laugh at the reviewer who said the peanut noodles were too peanutty.

My husband and I did not like this dish. It was way too peanut-y. We kept checking the recipe to see what we did wrong - but it appears we added all of the right amounts of ingredients.

This was really delicious, fast and easy. I did not have snow peas on hand so sliced a few zucchini and carrots (matchstick) and threw them in with the sauce. I had jarred roasted red peppers so used that. Also cooked the shrimp in the sause for the last few minutes. Would make again with or without the shrimp, very satisfying meal.

Made this for guests. Nice because you can assemble all ingredients ahead of time and it goes together quickly. Very tasty and not a bit left! Eager to try it with tofu for my vegan friends, can easily substitute for the chicken broth.

This was great! I am a lover of peanut sauce with satay, so I really loved this. Instead of spaghetti, I used fresh chow mein noodles, cooked them for a few minutes in boiling water, strained, then added a little sesame oil to them. Also didn't have snow peas, but julienned a zucchini, which turned out great. My husband and I just about licked our dishes clean.
