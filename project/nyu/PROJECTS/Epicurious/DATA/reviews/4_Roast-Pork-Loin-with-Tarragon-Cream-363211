Very delicious. There were only two of us so I used a small boneless pork loin at 1.2 lbs. Seared it off then put in the oven at 475 for 10 minutes. The sauce could be made to go with many things, but really paired beautifully with the pork. I served with some crusty bread which was great for swooping up a little extra sauce, and an apple & shaved fennel salad.

I fixed this for a group of 30, and it was a huge hit. I added mushrooms and garlic to the sauce preparation. I served this recipe with roasted potatoes (purple, red skin, and gold) and roasted carrots and parsnips, with a basil oil. I will definitely be serving this again.

This is a very nice dish that is simple to prepare with great results. I agree the sauce which is very good, can easily be used for chicken, veal, etc... Anyway, I didn't change a thing and it was fantastic. I will be adding this to my list of favorite dishes for pork.

Very simple and yummy. I used sliced pork loin and just pan sauted with minced garlic to cut down the cooking time. I added chopped apples and crimini muhrooms to the sauce and it as fantastic.

This has become a go-to recipe for entertaining. I've used the preparation with chicken breast and veal chops to equally good effect. Thank you!

Simple and delicious. I added mushrooms and minced garlic during the shallot phase of the sauce.

I loved this! It was easy to make and delicious! I also used a boneless pork loin and cooked it to about 140 degrees. Served with roasted red potatoes and broccoli. The sauce is delicious and I ended up eating it with everything else on the plate! If I hadn't been serving it to someone else I probably would have licked the plate.

Flavorful sauce made this recipe a hit for New Year's Day dinner. I used a boneless pork loin roast and it turned out great.
