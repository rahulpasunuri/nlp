I used about 1.2 oz of dough for each tortilla, and only got one tortilla on my comal at a time.

I used the Maseca brand mix as recommended. These were so good! It totally elevated the level of the taco filling. The taco fillings in this issue are great, but made much better with the 'homemade' tortillas. If you don't have a press, lay a sheet of saran wrap over your ball of dough. Use a glass pie plate and press the ball down as flat as you can get it. Then use a rolling pin to thin out your tortilla. Keep cooked ones inside a folded over kitchen towel till all are done. Tortillas should puff up a bit before flipping (turn up heat if doesn't).
