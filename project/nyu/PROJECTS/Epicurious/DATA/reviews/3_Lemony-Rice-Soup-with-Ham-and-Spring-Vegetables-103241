This actually also makes a great winter soup when asparagus is not in season. I doubled the recipe, added some garlic with the leek, then tossed in chopped carrots, potatoes, and cabbage, and sauteed all those veggies along with the leek and garlic in the butter on low for 15-20 mins before adding the other ingredients. Bright, hearty, satisfying.

Excellent. Added small amount carrots and celery and reduced rice slightly. Made w/homemade ham broth.

Delicious. The only thing I changed was adding a rind piece from a piece of Parmesan cheese, which was suggested in the menu description. The soup was delicious and everything done just right. I wish I had doubled the recipe, because I would treasure eating this again tonight.

Surprisingly quick recipe and very flavorful but mine also came out much too salty (I only made one recipe with all the ingredients called for, nothing substituted). Anyone else have this problem? As long as I can reduce the salt I would absolutely make this again.

Great quick soup to use up leftover ham and rice. Doubled the recipe, used cooked basmati rice, which kept the broth nice and thin, not too starchy. Added parsley and lots of lemon.

Made this tonight with green onions (shallots) instead of leeks because that's all I had on hand. It's easy and yummy. This soup won't change your life, but it's a nice item to have in your arsenal, especially when dinner is needed -- quick!

This was a fabulous light spring dinner, and a total surprise given I was just trying to pull together a soup with what I had in the fridge. I doubled the recipe and chose a good stock (I like Kitchen Basics) for a soup my husband took second helpings (piling on extra ham). That's usually a good sign!

What a lovely soup. It tastes so fresh! I also made it with frozen peas when I didn't have asparagus.

My family, including two small children, thought this was very good. I doubled the recipe and probably quadrupled the amount of lemon zest and juice. (Zest of one whole lemon and at least 1/4 cup of juice.) Reminded me a bit of avoglomeno. A nice way to use leftover Easter ham, and I also used the leftover asparagus--adding it at the same time as the ham--just to warm. Also substitued brown and wild rice for the white rice.

This is a staple in my home it's so easy, fresh and light. I make the rice seperatly so that it doesn't get soggy with the leftovers. This also speeds up the cook time because you can start the rice at the same time as the leeks I always double the receipe and add a bit more lemon and a lot more ham.

I would say 2.5 forks as well - had a very good flavor, easy to prepare. I doubled the recipe, but next time I would not double the rice. The rice makes it more starchy than I like; I prefer more broth.

Loved this soup. Light and lemony. I doubled the leeks and used high quality ham (from Shelburne Farms).

This is really a two-and-a-half fork dish; fairly well received by guests, and a good meal for a spring evening, but not something I can't wait to make again.

This soup is good, but needs some more falvor. I added 1 C wine, 1 T "Bells Salt Free Seasoning" a couple of yellow onions and 2 C's white wine. Yummy. try it with more turkey and less ham.
