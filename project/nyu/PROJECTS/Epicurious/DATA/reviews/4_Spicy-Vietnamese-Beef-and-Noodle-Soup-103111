Super yummy recipe that we'll likely make again and again. We are big fans of udon noodles and almost always have them on hand - whether or not they are authentic, they were a great, chewy texture in this dish. Swapped sambal oelek for the serrano chilies but otherwise followed to a T. Don't skimp on the fish sauce and lime after the cooking is done - it really added to this dish.

This was a fantastic recipe. A little time consuming because it has to simmer for so long, but not a lot of work at all. No need to chop up the vegetables too precisely, and they give amazing flavor to the broth. I too used rice noodles instead of udon and loved it. The fresh herbs and lime really add a lot, and make sure to add a bit of heat in the form of the chilies or sambal olek (Thai chili paste). I'll definitely make this again.

I was looking for something to make with my whole grain udon noodles. This was delicious. I used homemade beef broth and added some sliced mushrooms just before serving.

This soup was amazing! Be sure to use rice noodle and add some chopped peanuts and chilis in oil!

I have already made this soup several times. It's delicious. I did cut on liquid volume a bit, other than that I pretty much followed the recipe and the result is great. I don't care whether this dish is similar to pho or any other soup, whatever it is, it is yummy, and that's what counts. Whether you SHOULD use this or that kind of noodle so it's closer to the 'original' is irrelevant and arbitrary.

I wasn't thrilled with how this turned out. Made just like the recipe instructed except forgot to toss the noodles with sesame oil. That probably would have made a difference and I also noticed that it did in fact need a splash of fish sauce at the table. Also I think it would have been much better had I made the trip to the oriental grocery to buy the rice noodles like others suggested. I used what the recipe called for and did not think it was a good combination.

I enjoyed this but as a lover of pho I was a tad disappointed because it didn''t taste like traditional pho...something was missing. I definitely need to play with this recipe but all-in-all I think it's a keeper. I at it for breakfast and dinner and froze the rest. I plan on making this again and adding a few things.

This recipe doesn't claim to be pho, just inspired by pho. Great combination of ingredients, we really enjoyed it. We used rice noodles.

Excellent recipe. Very soothing to the stomach due to the ginger. I've passed the recipe to many friends;all of them really enjoyed it!

This is NOT Pho (it's called Bun Bo Hue), so flat rice noodles are inappropriate, or for that matter udon noodles. Actually, the noodles my mother uses are slightly thick than the ordinary rice vermicelli. Other than that, looks pretty darn close.

Mixing spices from a Vietnamese recipe for Nuoc Dung Bo (Spice Beef Broth)and the rest of the Bon Appetit recipe and technique made an excellent Pho Bo. I added 1 1/2 cinnamon sticks, 4 - 8 whole cloves, 2 large bay leaves, and 2 tsp. fennel seeds to the spice mix with the star anise and black peppercorns. I think the other noodle suggestions are better than the udon. We love this soup. I've served thin sliced raw top round to individually add as well and used some soup bones with the oxtail in the broth. Next time, I will use neck bones following other reviewers' ideas. My son loves the 'salad' of herbs that can be added. I think the lemongrass is optional.

This soup was perfect! It is authentic as any Pho that I have tasted. I could not find any fresh lemongrass, so I substituted 1T. dry and it worked wonderfully. This dish comes highly recommended to serve to guests who enjoy something adventurous.

I agree with the cook who suggested neck bones as a suitable sub. I have tried it both ways and both are agreeable. Little parts of the tails are FAR superior to the larger ones. I cannot agree about leaving them whole and gnawing them. There is way to much fat to sift through and can make for a nasty experience. Better to selectively take meat from the bones. Gnaw on them then. I always use 5 spice instead of star anise and usually use hot garlic chili paste or sauce to pep it up. The broth is the good part of the recipe. Add whatever crunchies and greens you want at the end. Also, nix the udon noodles. They are too bulky and starchy for this soup. I like broad rice vermichelli (thai). With these changes, I might up the rating to 3 forks. Barely a two without.

I have made this soup more than 10 times and each time is spectacular. Friends love the taste, the aroma as well as the "look". I have substituted beef neck meat instead of oxtail (cheaper and easier to find, meat just as tender) and egg fettucine instead of noodles listed in recipe. Defintely prepare broth day ahead, and prepare all other ingredients next morning as this will make serving the much easier and faster. This is one soup that will impress your friends !

Great dish, easy to make. But I used Chinese kway teow noodles instead, which I think is more authentic. (I'm Asian). I also cut down on the water to about 6 cups to make it more flavourful.

This broth gets it right - rich and flavorful. I'm Vietnamese, left Vietnam when I was too young to be in the kitchen, but old enough now to know what good Vietnamese food should taste like. With the exception of the lemongrass, this is essentially a recipe for "pho," so I'm not sure why udon noodles (Japanese) are used. Besides, 12 ounces of noodles just isn't enough! I bought a package of 30+ ounces of udon and still not enough. The udon was thick and starchy, am just not used to it. Therefore I suggest using flat rice noodles. Also it's a torture to cook the broth and then have to wait until the next day (for the fat to solidify in fridge) to eat, so I was very generous with the skimming during the 3-hour simmering: you can SEE the fat layer on top. Last suggestion: unless you'll be serving this to royal highness, you really don't have the time to tear the meat off the oxtails, leave them be. The meat is already so tender and gnawing at the oxtails is half the fun. If your guests find this uncouth, then you've invited the wrong people!

This recipe in incredible. EVERYONE to whom I've served it absolutely loves it. It is well worth the time to make it.

An excellent soup/stew that utilizes frugal cuts alongside exotic (to many Americans) ingredients. I made it verbatim, and everyone loved it. Substituting chicken strips for oxtail and chicken broth for beef broth (as julianne did), makes this an entirely different dish. Please try it the way it is posted here!

I modified this recipe to make it more like a hot and sour Vietnamese soup I had at a restaurant in Seattle. I used thin chicken breast pieces instead of oxtails, chicken broth instead of beef, rice noodles instead of udon. I added a tbsp rice vinegar to the broth as well. It was great, and i would definately make it again. It took some searching to find some of the ingredients, but it was worth it.
