so easy to make, fresh and healthy! the only sad part is that the granita melts fast, but still tastes great!

Easy and excellent. My dinner guests were a little cautious at first---it is VERY green. But after a few mouthfuls they are raving. I probably used a little less mint but that's the only difference.
