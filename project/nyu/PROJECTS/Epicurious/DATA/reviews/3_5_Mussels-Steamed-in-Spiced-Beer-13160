I've made this recipe several times now, and absolutely LOVE it. For the those who say it's too bitter as written, I agree. I squeeze in the lemon juice now, because lemon rinds really make everything bitter. As far as types of beer, I like IPA the best, but it works well with wheat varieties as well.

Yesterday was my first time preparing mussels. I used this recipe and it came out great! I used Bass beer and ground corriander seeds instead of whole corriander seeds.

I'd suggest a Saison, Wit, or Belgian Tripel /Golden Strong as your beer of choice.

this is a very simple, very quick recipe, I found the beer that I used for it was a bit strong, but I don't normally drink, so I wouldn't know, maybe try adding some water and maybe fish for flavour

Used Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Was very good. Great flavor.

Broth was not that flavorful at all.

Nice change of pace from the mussels in garlic & white wine. Wasn't sure the broth would be as flavorful, but it worked just fine with a crusty whole wheat baguette.

Everyone that has tasted this recipe at our home has loved it --- including one person that "hated" mussels---until she tasted this recipe and requested a copy of it--to make for her own family and guests!

I found this bowl of mussles to be somewhat bitter. I used a Sam Adams Boston Ale, a pale ale might be better. You might try a spice back to hold all the seeds. The coriander seed, where as tasty, was a bit much to have busting open in your mouth.

Good and a keeper, but there is a Thai recipe for mussels which is much better called "Mussels With Thai Red Curry"

My husband loves mussels! I wasn't sure he would like it; he loved it. I will definitely be making it again, it was a hit!

Put the mussels from a gourmet restaurant I frequent to shame. I served as an appetizer and received rave reviews. Had a wonderful cajun flavor. Every last mussel was devoured.
