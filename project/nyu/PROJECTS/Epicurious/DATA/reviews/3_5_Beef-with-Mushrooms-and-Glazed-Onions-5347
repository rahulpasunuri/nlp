This was a lush and elegant dish. The marrow melted beautifully. The mushrooms and onions not only made for a tasty flavor combination, buthelped create a truly dinner-party-worthy presentation.

I foolishly tried this recipe the first time for a dinner party. I wanted to make sure that the sauce would turn out right, so I heated some of the wine/broth mixture and added a little marrow. The marrow didn't melt and the "sauce" looked awful. It was lumpy and liquidy thin. I discarded the marrow and saved the sauce by stirring in a mixture of cornstarch and cold water and heating until it thickened a touch. It tasted great, but I was disappointed that the marrow didn't work. The mushrooms and steak were very good.

This was the most amazing beef tenderloin dish I've ever made. My guests all raved about it! I did not use Port in the recipe nor did I add any extra wine to compensate and it was really good! Also, I used as much beef marrow that I could conjure up. I ended up with about 3/4 cups of it and it turned out great! I will definitely make this recipe again. The beef was so tender...melt in your mouth meal!

I was not able to get enough marrow (the joys of living in rural Nebraska) so it was not a fair test. It was still very good. It took a lot time and if I ever get the marrow I would do it again.
