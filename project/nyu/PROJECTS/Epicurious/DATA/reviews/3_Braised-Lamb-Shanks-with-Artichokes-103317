Too much lemon and dill - my husband hated it. I love lemon and dill but the taste overpowered the artichokes. The lamb was tender and moist. If I made it again I'd cut the lemon and dill in half.

Very simple and very delicious. Substituted a "poultry blend" of fresh herbs because I can't stand dill, otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Might try frozen artichoke hearts in the future, using fresh didn't seem like it was worth the effort, but otherwise this is fantastic. We're using all the scraps to make lamb stock.

Cleaning the artichokes is wasteful & alot of work. In the future I will use canned or frozen hearts. Otherwise the recipe is a snap, and very good. I added garlic and a few mint sprigs to the sauce. The sauce is very delicate and goes well with a dry white wine.

This was a very easy dish to prepare. Instead of using fresh artichokes, I used canned artichokes. After browning the shanks, adding onions and broth, I finished cooking in the oven for 2-3 hrs. Husband and children loved it.

This was wonderful! I happened to have some homemade lamb broth on hand, so I used that instead of the chicken broth. My husband really likes lemon, so I went a little heavy with the lemon juice. Besides being delicious, it was also a very easy dish to prepare (aside from cleaning the artichokes!)

Fortunately, I live near the artichoke capital of the world, Castroville, California. So, I have year round access to fresh artichokes. I substitute baby artichokes, cut in halves, for the large ones. These make for a more tender dish. I also use fresh green onions instead of yellow onions. Likewise, I add fresh parsley and mint. This really livens up the flavors. I serve this over a bed of steamed rice. It has become a family a favorite.

Braised lamb is one of my favorite dishes, and this one turned out beautifully. I might add a little bit more lemon juice next time, just to experiment. I wasn't exactly clear on what they wanted me to do with the artichokes, so I just trimmed it down to the heart, cut it in quarters and cleaned off the thistle. This dish got high marks from my partner as well.
