Quick, simple. I substituted the garlic and poultry seasoning for caribbean jerk seasoning. I added some red pepper flakes and caribbean jerk seasons to the flour batter. Perfect.

Can't go wrong with this one.

This is delicious chicken, uncomplicated like Mom makes! I rubbed the chicken with tons of chicken seasoning first. The only downside was that our apartment reeked like oil for days... but no one is going to complain about that when the fridge is full of fattening delights!

Well, my suspicion is proven correct that MY mom makes the world's best fried chicken (!)-- and she taught me. Notes on how to "fix" this recipe: DO NOT add garlic or poultry seasoning! Instead, add 1 teaspoon paprika to the flour. DO NOT refrigerate the washed chicken. Instead, wash it just before cooking, salt and pepper each piece, and immediately coat it with flour. Enough flour should stay on the chicken to make a crispy crust, without appearing to be "battered" (ugh!). Cook the chicken in 1 1/2 cups SOLID vegetable shortening, heated to around 375 degrees. When you turn the chicken the first time, cover the skillet and turn down the heat. Turn the chicken SEVERAL TIMES to prevent it from getting too brown, while it cooks tender -- about 30 minutes. When the chicken is about ready, take off the lid and turn up the heat again so that the chicken is very crisp and hot when taken up. Serve HOT with mashed potatoes and cream gravy, hot biscuits, corn on the cob, bread-and-butter pickles, and a salad. Apple pie with homemade ice cream is the perfect dessert.

Tasty, extremely simple and quick. Good basic recipe somewhat lacking in imagination however.
