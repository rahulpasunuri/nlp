Excellent! Made with the recommendations of others. That being-double the spices, decrease the egg whites to eight and increase the pumpkin to one cup. Serve with the recommended bourbon sauce--but use sparingly. Outstanding!

Fabulous. Made souffles for the first time, using this recipe, and they were a hit. I definitely agree with doubling the spices. I also added a little powdered ginger. I liked the bourbon molasses sauce, but I added about 1/2 the quantity of molasses, and used black strap. I didn't think the sauce overpowered the souffles, but it is sweet, so only a little is needed. I can't wait to make these again!

Very beautiful and impressive dessert. I used a whole can of pumpkin (15 oz) and 10 egg whites. I thought it was a little bland, and doubling the spices would probably help. I was surprised at how high it rose. I only had 2 ramekins, so the rest went in a casserole dish. It rose high but then fell after it cooled. I am going to try to reheat it tomorrow and see if it puffs up again.

Easy recipe and beautiful results! Made two batches and the first came out lovely! BUT.....the recipe notes you can make ahead of time and hold in freezer for an hour before baking. I tried this and not only did the souffles not rise but the ones that did deflated the moment they were taken out of the oven. I thought it sounded far fetched but trusted epi. Make, bake and serve! The only way to pull off souffle

I made these as suggested, with only 8 egg whites, 1 cup of pumpkin, and double the spices and they were fantastic. It filled 8 large ramekins. We didn't do the bourbon sauce, but thought these were perfect with just the powdered sugar. I thought I'd have a couple left so that I could try the reheating, but the kids polished them off.

This recipe is exceptional. I used fresh baked pumpkin and followed the suggestions of other reviewers and increased the pumpkin to 1 cup and the eggs to 8. The oven time/temp are approximate and will vary widely by oven. My oven set on convection cooked them in 14 minutes. The sweet bourbon sauce and unsweetened whipped cream made a nice counterpoint. We went very easy on the bourbon sauce keeping it to a max 2 tblspns per ramekin. This will be a classy and very nice alternative to pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving.

These were terrific, but I agree with the other reviews and would cut down the amount of egg whites by at least two next time. Maybe I used smaller ramikens, but there was enough batter for ten. It was a great way to use up my left over pumpkin and made for an impressive dessert.

Based on the reviews, I increased pumpkin to 1 c. (probably could have increased further), decreased egg whites to 8, doubled the spices and made the bourbon sauce per the instructions. Delicious and beautiful presentation! I'll make them again.

i got a "superb" rating from my family members at thanksgiving! I did alter the recipe....I used fat free half and half instead of milk, I added fresh vanilla beans to the pumpkin mixture, I used 8 egg whites instead of 10, and when whipped that even seemed like too much so i used almost all, but not all of the whipped whites. Also, I used a lightly sweetened whipped cream rather than sauce, but i think the sauce would be amazing too! this was an absolutely amazing dessert. lastly, i cookecd them too early, and reheated them before serving and they did re rise.....

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! i also freezed them...super easy! The sauce added alot. Whip cream and a sprig of mint on top! This will now be a staple!

Fantastic! The technique of freezing before baking is brilliant and actually works (I was amazed). I halved the recipe for 4 people but used the full amount of spices and used fresh pumpkin roasted and pureed - just because I had some on hand. Nice to be able to say it was made with fresh local pumpkin. I put the souffles tiogether and put them in the freezer, then in the car to a potluck; into the host's freezer; right from freezer to 400F oven. Done in about 17 minutes - absolutley beautiful and delicious. Who would think you could bring souffles to a potluck dinner? I will use this technique for dessert souffles from now on. No fussing during dinner, just pop into the oven after serving the main course. I served this with a simple bourbon sauce (no molases) and I think it rounded out the flavors really well.

These souffles are wonderful! VERY easy to make and they rose perfectly. I tried them out as a possible Thanksgiving dessert and I will definitely make them - much more impressive than pie. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used a full cup of pumpkin - the flavor was perfect. I also only used 9 egg whites. These were airy, light and flavorful. I did not make the bourbon molasses sauce as I am not crazy about either of those flavors - I just made a lightly sweetened vanilla whipped cream and it went with it perfectly. I baked some right away and froze others overnight to make the next day. The frozen ones turned out just as good (the fresh ones I baked for 18 minutes and the frozen ones baked for 19 minutes). So, this could be a great "make ahead of time" dessert.

These were fantastic! I made them with skim milk and they were still good. It made more than I expected. Even though I cut the recipe in half it still made 8.

very good. nice and light. I also added a little more pumpkin than what it called for and did fewer egg whites and we thought it turned out very well. the bourbon sauce was good, though a little too bourbon-y for our liking.

This was so easy and so good. I did use fresh pumpkin and I also layered the spice and used brown sugar. The pumpkin taste was subtle but good. I also made a Bourbon sauce from a recipe not included on epicurious because molasses didn't sound good. I halved the entire recipe and it was perfect for 4. Absolutely a winner would definately make it again.

I have made many different types of dessert souffles and this one is my favorite. I am not a big fan of molasses so I pair this souffle with a bourbon maple creme anglaise. Fabulous!

Rating: 4
very easy and impressive. I actually never made a souffle before and these turned out perfectly and didn't even fall after serving. The bourbon sauce was good but I couldn't discern the bourbon at all and it was so intensely flavored with molasses that you had to either eat the souffle with no accompaniment to appreciate the delicate pumpkin flavor or have it with both the sauce AND the whipped cream to cut the power of the molasses.

My daughter and I entered our version of this recipe in the Annual Spice Challenge, a family tradition  and won! The spice for the challenge was Penzeys Chili 9000. The spice needs to be the star in order to win the challenge. Points are awarded for originality, taste, and appearance. We decided to layer the spice throughout all components of this dish, to make it the subtle star. We chose to add ¼ t. of Chili 9000 to the soufflé, ½ t. to the bourbon sauce, and 1/8 t. to the cream. For an unusual twist to this recipe, try it!

Delicious and easy. Although I did have to throw out the first batch of eggs because it did not thicken. I served as a side with smoked turkey and ginger salad. Used the bourbon sauce the next night also with salmon.

With all the egg whites light on pumpkin flavor but beautiful, and the sauce is fantastic.

Great and easy recipe and was a great finish to Christmas dinner. Made the following changes: increased pumpkin to 1 cup, doubled the spices, added 1/2 t ground ginger, and only folded in 2/3 of the egg whites. 10 egg whites would have diluted the mixture too much. As it was, the flavor was delicate and I can't imagine what it would have been like with all the egg whites. Made the sauce, but didn't end up serving it. Instead used a melon baller to create two miniature scoops of vanilla ice cream and served them on the spoon that accompanied the souffle. Made a great presentation without being overwhelming.

This was a fabulous dessert! It was impressive and a relatively light dessert for Thanksgiving. I made the sauce and believe that those of you who skipped it really missed out. I will certainly make this again in the future- easy to make and really tasty!

I've never made a souffle before but this turned out fantastic! It was so light and airy. I didn't make the sauce but wish I had as I think it would have really enhanced it.

My friend Tim tried this in lieu of pie. We opted to omit the sauce because we thought it would be too much for the soufflé. We found them to be a wonderful, light dessert after the sumptuous feast that is typical of any Thanksgiving table. We would probably make two changes next time to pump up the pumpkin flavor a bit: use a full cup of pumpkin and reduce the egg whites to 8.

This got rave reviews at Thanksgiving! However, I didn't add the ground clove as I felt the Allspice added enough clove flavoring. The sauce was a great accompaniment to this souffle.

This was a great lighter alternative to pumpkin pie. We loved them. I used 1 Tbs vanilla instead of the bourbon in the sauce. The sauce went very will with the souffles and I will use the sauce recipe for other things. The recipe made more than would fit in 6 6-oz ramekins. I froze the extras and made 2 days later. They turned out well.

This dessert is a fabulous alternative to the standard pumpkin pies. It is simple, light, and a crowd pleaser. The bourbon-molasses sauce, and a dollop of whipped cream, made this dessert the bomb. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. The recipe provided enough for a 10 ramekins. Use the sauce for vanilla ice cream or other!

These were a hit! My fiance (always skeptical of souffles) said this might have been the best dessert he's had. This was my first time making a souffle and it wasn't at all difficult - they turned out just like the picture! I only made a few changes: (1) Made a half recipe, which was way more than enough for four 6-oz. ramekins (probably could have filled six). (2) Used brown sugar instead of granulated in the pumpkin- cream mixture. (3) Skipped the bourbon- molasses sauce and made a lightly-sweetened whipped cream that I spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, and ground cloves. Yum!

I don't know why people aren't fond of the sauce. It really MAKES the recipe. Just a drizzle on the soufflé, with the suggested unsweetened whipped cream, and it created many complex layers to this ultra yummy ending! The only thing was the soufflés collapsed in five minutes. Don't know how to make them stand up better. Oh, well, I guess I'll have to attempt (and eat) this countless times until I get it right.

The souffles worked wonderfully. The people at my table enjoyed the addition of whipping cream and the bourbon sauce. Actually, the sauce was the hit at my table.

This is a spectacularly elegant dessert for a more sophisticated table. It's airy and light and gets a wow. Based on the prior reviews, I didn't make the bourbon sauce. However, it seems to me a good sauce would enhance it.

I made these to try them as a possible alternative to pie for Thanksgiving, and we loved them! I threw out the sauce (the bourbon and molasses flavors did seem to go together, but not in any way I'd want to eat, much less serve, them). I made instead the maple bourbon sauce from a recipe for pumpkin profiteroles, but didn't need it. The souffles were perfect on their own, and were improved only by a little good vanilla ice cream on the side. We now have our Thanksgiving dessert.

Has anyone tried this with arrowroot powder instead of eggs?

Having read the previous (and only) review I bagged the sauce. Good thing. While these are souffles in that they are made with egg whites and puff up beautifully, they are more meringue than anything else. Denser and more sugary than most people expect in a souffle, I think this recipe is somewhat mis-labled. That much sugar at the end of a meal was too much sweetness for my taste.

The souffle was very good and turned out beautifully BUT it was ruined by the disgustingly sweet and overpowering Bourbon and Molasses Sauce, a truly horrible concoction.
