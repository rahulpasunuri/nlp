This was a tasty omelet. However, I would not make it again due to the simple fact that it took forever to prepare and cook. This is an omelet folks! Also, these omelets were huge. You could feed a small army. I'll look for something a more basic.

A very savory and hearty omelet. Perfect as is, preferred grated Provolone over Fontina. Serve with french baguette, green salad and a beer. Enjoy !

We made this for a main dish dinner, and it was perfect. We had everything already in our pantry, and after slicing the leeks, it was ready in less than half an hour.
