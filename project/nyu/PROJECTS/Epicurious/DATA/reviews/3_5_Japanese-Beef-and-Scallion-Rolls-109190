I love getting Negimaki at Japanese restaurants, & this was the perfect recipe to make my beloved treat at home. I used a flank steak and carefully sliced it with the grain (important!) & followed the directions to a T with the exception of the sake...since I didnt have any i used soy sauce instead and it worked just fine. we had some sauce leftover, but the sauce was really the most delicious part! i do agree that blanching the scallions was an extra step that was probably unneccessary, as they would wilt when they go in the frying pan. once cut, they cooled very quickly, i like the suggestion of hitting them under the broiler for a minute or maybe sticking the cut pieces back in the frying pan for a bit? delicious!

This was good, but I streamlined the recipe a lot. I skipped blanching the scallions and used braciole meat instead of flank steak, which made it much easier to form the rolls with one piece of meat. I felt the rolls were a little bland having only marinated for 15 minutes, so next time I will marinate my meat for a longer amount of time before I form the rolls, and will make extra sauce to drizzle on them.

Minneapolis - The prosciutto used by Greenwich was a replacement of the ham mentioned by Manhattan as a sarcastic example of his/her mention of people who make significant changes to a recipe on the site and still rate the recipe highly. I haven't made this yet, but it looks good enough on screen to make my mouth water, so I'm putting it on next week's menu! :-)

Wow...very good. I browned them though first on top of the stove, then place them under the broiler to crisp them up a bit. Not sure about the Ham and Prosciutto variations as it changes the whole thing, however can appreciate the creativity!

I really had to laugh at the people who changed the recipe to ham and still rated the recipe. Having lived many years in Japan, I was thrilled to find this recipe. I didn't use flank steak but I did use very thinly sliced beef. Instead of frying it I grilled it as it would be done in Japan. Yummy.

Haven't tried this yet - but question - where does the prosciutto or ham come in that everybody's talking about?????

GREAT traditional Japanese family dinner recipe! My mom would add cheese with scallion, and serve with ground sesame+tsuyu dressing

Amazing!!!!!!! I tried the recipe following the suggestion of the cook from new york, I used proshutto rather than sliced ham (I thought it would give it an extra edge, and wasn't I right!!!) and I used both asparagus and scallions. I served it with potato salad and chips. If you cook proshutto you have always to add some lemon zest (this is a trick I've learned from Mario Batali) and - believe me - everybody raved about it for the whole weekend.

This recipe is very interesting so it is going to be my tomarrow's lunch but I'm writing this to say hellow to Dworlaw from Manhatan who sems to be a man after my own heart. I have never had a disappointment with a recipe, all one has to do is to "visualize" or "testiulize?" the resalts. Will follow with another comment after tring.

I love the notes where writer does not follow the recipe but junks it up and loves it. For example, something like this: My family loved the beef negamaki which I changed slightly by using sliced ham instead of the beef, asparagus instead of the scallions, and ketchup for a marinade. The result: applause from the kids and wife.

This dish was easy, quick and delicious. My husband and older daughter are not huge fans of onion, but blanching them really seemed to make them soft and mild. The only change I made was to double the marinade/sauce recipie. I served this with tempura vegetalbes and steamed rice and the sauce went very well with all of it. We will definately be making this again.

I think this would be a hit at a backyard barbecue for those who want something besides the usual burgers and steak. I made some shortcuts and the results were more than likely just as tasty. I used flap meat, a cut that is already quite thin (for carne asada) and pounded out each three pieces into 10 inch by 4 inch rectangles. I didn't really see the point of blanching the green onions, so I skipped that. Followed the remaining recipe except for the marinade. I used a good-quality marinade from San-J which contains sake. The negimaki was delicious and an attractive compliment to a menu of miso soup, cold cucumber salad, vegetable tempura, shrimp gyoza, plenty of steamed rice and cool, crisp Viognier. I find myself eating more and more Japanese-inspired dishes. They tend to be deeply satisfying without the residual bloat :-}
