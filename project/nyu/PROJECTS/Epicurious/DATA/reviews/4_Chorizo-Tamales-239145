Well, I made the meat/corn mixture but then used the recipe for tamales on the bag of masa tamale mix. This worked great except I felt that there wasn't enough meat. Maybe the proportion of tamale to meat was off by this method. However, they were very tasty even so. I froze them a few days then thawed out before steaming. Super to know this works great! If I use this method again I will use a pound of chorizo.

Very flavorful, although they could be perfected by adding a couple chopped roasted poblano peppers. If you're not trying to be Martha Stewart, I suggest forgoing the tied-up package method of wrapping these and just place 1/2 cup filling lengthwise on the husk, fold the pointed end up like a burrito, then roll tightly. You'll get done MUCH faster!

I was wondering how much cornmeal is equivalent to 2lbs(as I didn't have a scale handy). The conversion is 3-1/4 cups=1lb cornmeal.

These tamales are delicious. And easier than most traditiional tamale recipes so this is a good place to start if tamales are a chore that you care to take on. The flavor and texture are great. Changed nothing really and used probably 2 cups chicken stock. Really loved them.

I made this for my husband and me. He said he never understood why people thought tamales were so great until he tasted this recipe. I have to agree, these tamales were great. The chipotle peppers gave them a smoky, flavorful taste rather than being overwhelmingly spicy. Will definitely make again.
