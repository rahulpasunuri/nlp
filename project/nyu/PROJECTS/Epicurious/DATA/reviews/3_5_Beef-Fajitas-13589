To answer the question of lemon or lime juice, USE LIME JUICE! I made this recipe for my family while on vacation, and everyone loved it. We used flank steak and marinated them overnight. I have since used this marinade for chicken(1 hour) and that was also wonderful. Very easy and tasty.

This was absolutely delicious. It was too windy outside to use the grill, so we used the wok and it worked perfect. These fajitas were as good as any we've had in a restaurant and the recipe is going into my "save" folder. I also used a bit of lime juice along with the lemon juice just because I had it on hand from making the guacamole.

Forgot to mention in my review below that I use fresh lime juice instead of the lemon juice. This is a must!

I have been using this recipe for almost 10 years now and it is simply the best fajita marinade ever! I am always asked for the recipe. I use double the amount of ground cumin and marinade at least 24 hours.I always double or triple the recipe.The marinade is even better on chicken. Works well with pork also. This is a staple at my house.

Great marinade! Made it with top round steak, sliced on the diagonal, delicious and tender. The marinade recipe is going into rotation..

we too substitute lime instead of lemon juice. wonderful-very easy, tasty, and comes out perfect everytime. Skip the bell peppers and serve with grilled poblano peppers and onion that has been tossed with a bit of olive oil, salt and pepper.Grilled on gas bbq( in pan with holes made for bbq) )We love pico de gallo and guacamole with it too, and black beans. Make sure you have a margarita in hand too!Ole!

Followed the recipe, except cutting it in half and using London Broil instead of skirt steak and lime juice instead of lemon juice. It was really flavorful and delicious. I wouldn't change a thing!

I was a good recipe. I used white onions and shallots instead of red, and extra virgin olive oil where vegetable oil was required. Aside from that variance the dish looked and tasted great. I also added shredded sharp cheddar and shredded green leaf lettuce to the finished product.

I would give this 4 forks except I believe it is critical to use lime instead of lemon. Serve with home-made Pico de Gallo and this is a raver.

this recipe is quick, easy and delicious! i doubled the marinade(using lime juice) and marinated a batch of steak and chicken overnight. wow... what flavor:). i typically slice my beef or chicken into strips before cooking, but i followed the recipe and sliced after they were cooked and rested. it made a huge difference... very moist and tender. even the chicken was moist... and that rarely happens:). i will use this recipe over and over again.

Have made fajitas forever & usually just marinated in lime & tequila, but this recipe is better. Used LIME in the marinade for well pounded flank steak. Had more than needed so grilled the rest on ridged iron skillet days later & the meat was even better. Grilled the onions(white & scallion)& green bell peppers in same skillet while meat rested. Avocados not ripe so made pico de gaillo with tomato, jalapeno, onion, lime juice & cilantro. Heated tortillas over gas burner & we take turns eating them as they are made. Served as always with LIME wedges. Outstanding fajitas!

Really good. The cumin was very strong at first so I wasn't sure, but we were really happy with how they turned out.

I added about a tablespoon of chili powder to the marinade to give it some heat. I grilled both the flank steak and the tortillas, Que Bueno!

Have made this for years (a family favorite) but got the basics from another magazine. Lime juice a must, plus soy sauce in the marinade. Sirloin steak works fine. Time constraints have led me to discover that sliced avocado, fresh, sliced tomato and medium salsa work well as additions to the grilled items.

Rating: 3
I've been making this one since 2001 and keep coming back to it because it is so simple and so good (agree that lime juice is the way to go for the best fajita flavor. Skirt steak is great if you can find it, but flank makes a good substitute.

Rating: 3
I only made the marinade recipe and it was delicious with the skirt steak. I grilled peppers and onions and served them up with the fajitas and various homemade salsas. Regarding whether it's lemon or lime, the original issue (which I have) calls for lime juice, but online is says lemon. I opted for the lime which, IMHO, goes much better with beef than lemon.

LEMON OR LIME THAT IS THE QUESTION. I've made this fajita before and both used lemon or lime in different occassions. They are both good. One time a friend threw a party and was serving one of those HEB preseason fajita. It did not turn out great so I doctored the second batch by cooking it on a skillet (she didn't have a grill) and marinting it with a soy sauce, lots of pepper, and drizzled lot of lemon as it sizzles. I let the soy caramelized on the beef and it was the juiciest, tastiest, lemony fajita they ever had. Of course it did not helped that a it cooks, the aroma is simply mouthwatering. Now there's a restaurant in town (Lupe Tortilla) who marinates the beef overnight in lime and the whole 9 yards. They have the best tasty fajita in town. The rest are mediocre. So LEMON OR LIME? I'd say marinate it half and half and serve it half and half so your guests would enjoy both.

I found that "fajita meat" sold at Super Target works best for this recipe. VERY tender and flavorful compared to the other cuts of meat I tried. Served with jalapeno pinto beans. Leftovers are not around for long.

Update as promised... Lemon vs. Lime: The lemon was only ok in the marinade, doesn't do the recipe any harm but the lime, in my humble opinion, is what it takes to make this dish 4 forks

I will never buy another manufactured product for fajitas -- ever. I mixed lemon & lime juice. What I got in the end result was McCormick's Fajita Mix and it was the very, very, very best and I thought I could never replicate it.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used a large new york steak instead. I also seasaoned the meat before marinating with Suzie Qs Santa Maria style seasoning. It turned out great!

I hope to be making this recipe tonight, so do not have the right to actually "rate" it, but did want others to notice that in the ingrediants they ask for "Lemon" but in the proceedure say "lime". There probably would not be a huge difference, but wanted folks to know anyway.

I've rated this recipe and have made it tons of times, slight variations but it's always one of my favorite-definitely tried and true. I'm commenting today because I asked my husband to put the steaks up to marinade in the morning so we could cook them when I got home from work. He trusts my cooking and LOVES these fajitas so he figured what he was reading was how I prepare them. He didn't read my comment about using lime instead of the lemon but tonight we are making them exactly how the recipe is (A first for me). I'll definitely let you know how it is made with lemon juice. To be continued.

I made this recipe with both chicken and beef for a neighbohood block party. It was a hit; even my next-door neighbor who is a retired chef said it was delicious. For this big crowd, I rolled the tortillas by twos and wrapped in aluminum foil. Worked well for a large crowd.

I made this with flank steak and chicken. I marinated the steak 24 hours but it was very tough. For the chicken, I used a store-bought tequila lime marinade and it actually had a lot more flavor than the marinade on the steak. Very disappointing.

These were OUTSTANDING! My guests at our first Mexican Fiesta LOVED them! The flavor is excellent. I used a flank steak as that was all my butcher had and it was very tender, delish. I started marinating the meat the night before and we did not actually make the fajitas (is important to cut across the grain) until ~8PM the next day. It was one of the hightlights of the dinner ~ I will definately make this again!

After reading reviews I decided to make this and don't see why this got rave reviews. I love all the ingredients in this but hated the marinade. It seemed to have a almost sour taste to me. I like fajitas to be full of flavor. I would have given this 1 fork but my husband liked it alright. I didn't use the same cut of meat for this but it wasn't that, it was the flavor of the marinade. I will not make this again.

I haven't cooked this yet, because in your recipe you list 1/4 cup lemon juice, which is what i prepared, but, in your direction you state to whisk the "garlic paste, LIME juice, cumin and olive oil. Which is it Lime or Lemon juice? I think Lime juice would be the better in this recipe. What say you?

Yes, add more garlic and lime juice...and you have the best fajitas on the planet. Served it with a tomatillo salsa receipe (found on this site) which is also excellent. Only marinated mine for about 6 hours and the meat was still excellent.

A very good fajita recipe - I use it all the time. Two tips: double it in volume across all ingredients since I find it doesn't make enough. Secondly, I double the garlic all around since I'm a garlic fanatic. This also works well with chicken and shrimp too (don't marinate these guys as long as you would steak though).

I used lemon juice, freshly ground cumin, and eye of round(cut across grain). The HUGE onion I used wasn't enough and want to use lime juice next time. Served with tortillas,cheese, sour cream and fresh garlic lime salsa. Yum -- we ate the leftovers before bed!

While I have not made this, in response to the previous reviewer's question- Be careful to cut the meat across the grain like you would for any lower cost cut of beef, like London Broil. If you cut it the wrong way, it could have been marinating for days but will be too tough to chew. Hope this helps!

Rating: 2
Made it with skirt steak, but it was really tough (although meat was medium rare inside). The meat seemed good quality but one had to use a steak knife to cut it, instead of just bitting it. A more intricate marinade definitely helped the flavor. What did I do wrong?

I used the lime jucie as so many had suggested. It still needed more help than that though. All I tasted was the lime juice on the meat. It definitely needed more spice added to it.

While this is a very good fajita recipe, I have created my own with a base of Worcestershire and Teriyaki sauce, thrown in some lemon pepper seasoning, cayenne pepper, cajun seasoning, orange juice, orange extract, canned crushed pineapple in its own juice, lemon & lime juice, tequila, and triplesec. If you let the meat and vegetables soak in this overnight and cook them the next day, it's delicious. You can use flank or skirt steak - but skirt steak is better if you can get it.

Excellent for serving guests in celebration of Cinco de Mayo! I will use this recipe often throughout the bar-b-que season. The vegetables are beautiful (I used white onion though). I threw in a couple of whole jalapeno peppers also.

What an easy recipe! I had my husband grill the meat while I sauted the peppers and onions and we were sitting down to supper in about 15 minutes. I used the lime juice and it really hit the spot! Leftovers were great in a salad for lunch the next day. Try to marinate the meat for as long as you can.

Rating: 4
What is missing from this recipe and lots of others is SALT! If you salt the onions and peppers as well and resalt the meat and especially the guacamole, then the flavors will be brought out. I also add cumin to the peppers and fresh cilantro after they are cooked. I love this dish and make it quite often. Great with chicken breasts as well.

In the words of my husband, "That's some fajita!" This dish was a huge hit at our house. I had some leftover sirloin steak that I thinly sliced before marinating and then just reheated it in a wok. Great results. I am sure it would be even better using the skirt steak.

These are as good as all the other reviewers indicated! Thanks to the suggestions...I used only lime juice, doubled the marinade recipe, and marinated the vegies, too. I also did chicken in addition to beef....used flank steak (medium-rare on the grill) and it turned out fine. I marinated the steak for 24 hours; the chicken for about 30 minutes. I put the meats and vegies on a platter, and offered bowls of salsa (hot and mild), guacamole, sour cream, cilantro, and shredded cheese. Everyone made their own. The next day I used the leftovers by placing the ingredients in 1/2 of the tortilla, folded it over, and fried it like a quesadilla. YUM!!! Don't forget the margueritas!!!

I tripled the recipe, got the skirt steak from a quality butcher and grilled it on the outdoor BBQ. I had no idea this dish would be so tasty and such a hit!! Next time I will freeze extra batches of steak in the marinade to have on hand for a quick and impressive dinner. I highly recommend this recipe!

The recipe cites 2 citrus juices (lemon and lime) but lime works best. A presentation on a platter with shredded cheeses, lettuce, tomato, the cooked onions and peppers, and other fixins for quests to build their own is enjoyable. Add more cumin amount for spicy taste.
