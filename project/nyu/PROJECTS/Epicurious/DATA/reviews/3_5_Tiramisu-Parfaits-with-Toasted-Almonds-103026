This recipe is quick, easy, and tastes great! I also used mascarpone cheese and lady fingers which sent this over the top. I strongly recommend it.

Easy and decadent but would recommend using mascarpone cheese vs cream cheese if it's available. Allowing the dessert to mature overnight is well worth it.

Excellent recipe as written. I had a little syrup left over??

I made this for a dinner party in a square pan and it turned out fabulously. I used marscapone and ladyfingers. Quick, easy and everyone loved it.

This worked WONDERFULLY in a trifle dish. It is easy and fun to make, can be made the day before, and all swooned. It is delicious and looked gorgeous as a trifle. A show stopper when I brought it to the table.

Great recipe! I used ladyfingers and mascarpone and my friends loved it. I made it last week for my girlfriends bday dinner and I am making it again tonight for another party I am hosting. What I loved most is that I was able to start making it at 1:00 and it was delicious when we had it at 9:00 and more importantly, I was able to make it when I have two children that are 1 and 2! Strongly recommended!

My friends like this dessert also. I made it in a sqaure glass dish. I used lady fingers and drizzled extra syrup over the top of the cheese filling. It is VERY rich, but so easy to make and it is very good the next day. This is a keeper!

These turned out really great. I am a die hard Tiramisu afficiando and was hesitant to use cream cheese in place of mascarpone. I decided to try the recipe as written and they tasted really good. I'm not throwing out my "real" tiramisu recipe or anything but I would make these again. I used 10 oz. clear plastic cups and took these to a BBQ last weekend. (The recipe as written yielded 8 parfaits in this size cup)I added fresh whipped cream lightly sweetened and flavored with almond extract to the tops before dusting w/ cocoa & topping with the toasted almonds. They travel really well and can be made the night before without compromising the taste or texture.

Love this recipe. I make it in a casserole dish or trifle dish and bring it to potlucks. It always gets attention. I love tiramisu, but live in a culturally deprived area where mascarpone is not readily available and the ladyfingers are kept in the meat department (not kidding).

After reading the reviews I was excited to prepare this dessert. It was disappointing. My guests love tiramisu and they thought that this version was "good" but not close enough to the real thing. The pound cake consistency bothered some of my guests as did the coffee/kahlua syrup.

This was easy and impressed our guests. I was out of Kahlua so I used Creme de Cocoa and would definitely make it that way again.

This rivals the best tiramisu we've eaten at top notch restaurants. I used 12-oz. parfait glasses and the quantity was perfect. Only change I made was replacing cream cheese w/mascarpone cheese. I've never used pound cake for tiramisu before but think I actually prefer it to ladyfingers-- adds more texture and substance.

It was easy, and good. But I had leftover coffee syrup and poured extra on the parfaits; it was overwhelming. I'll be stingier with the syrup next time.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about it. One lady said it was the best she had ever had. It was really easy to make and prepare and it looked professionally done. I did the top of the parfaits with an icing tip and they looked great.

I've made this two times now to rave reviews from friends! The first time, I made it in wine glasses as I had no parfait dishes and the individual desserts were delightful. I recently made it for a dinner party in a 9 by 13 glass dish and it worked great. I shaved bittersweet chocolate on top. I had people over tonight still raving about last week's dessert! I love tiramisu and even without the authentic ingredients, this one turns out better that most I've had at restaurants!!!!

There are not seven deadly sins, but eight and this is it! This dessert is so sinfully rich and decadent that it's difficult to say "no" to one more mouthful. I agree with the cook in Vancouver that you should use marscapone instead of cream cheese (if possible) and half kahlua and half rum along with lady fingers instead of pound cake. I would recommend a tuile cookie or chocolate "straws" with a halved strawberry for a garnish.

This was a big hit, and even better after a couple of days in the refrigerator. Forgot powdered sugar at the store, so I used granulated, just cut the amounts in half. Also used half Kahlua half rum (couldn't decide). Didnt' find it too rich; exactly the opposite! Even with mascarpone, it felt light. Oh- made it in a glass dish 'cause we didn't have parfait glasses - it worked wonderfully, and would be spectacular to take to a dinner party or buffet!

This dish is supposed to be rich, which it is. The only addition I would recommend is to add a Tbl. of couintreau SP? it really adds a perfection to a fast and furious delight...

Very rich and delicious! Excellent results without too much effort. I used dark rum instead of liquer and garnished with chocolate-covered espresso beans. There was quite a lot of extra espresso syrup, so next time I would halve the syrup ingredients to prevent so much waste.

I liked this recipe a lot. I used reduced fat cream cheese and it didn't make a bit of difference. It is very rich and a little goes a long way. All my guests loved it. I would make it again.

Wonderfull mix of espresso, alcohol and mascarpone. I love it. Try using Lady Fingers instead of lb cake, rum instead of liquer and mascarpone instead of cream cheese. I've done it as the recipe says, but with my poetic liscence changes it's much, much better.

This was too rich. It is one of those desserts in which you love the first few bites but by the time you get to the end you're feeling a bit nauseous. Doesn't REALLY taste like tiramisu either, but the first couple bites are close enough, since it is relatively easy to make. And here is an odd thing--did I screw up or is the recipe off in the amount of espresso syrup we're supposed to make? I had about half of it remaining when I was finished making the parfaits! (And thank goodness, because no one could have eaten more of that syrup...)

I forgot how rich tiramisu is; it is a good recipe though.

My sisters and i are big tiramisu fans and have tasted tiramisu by many restaurants. Both my sisters thought it was just the same as the restaurants'. I definitely would make it again!

What is 2 tablespoons plus ß cup powdered sugar - a "B" cup powdered sugar? Leaves a lot to the immagination... How much is it exactly?

This was very easy to make and very delicious. It really did taste close to the real thing! Made it for a friends b-day and we all loved it.
