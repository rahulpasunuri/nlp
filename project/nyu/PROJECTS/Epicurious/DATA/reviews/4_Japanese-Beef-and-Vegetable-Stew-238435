This recipe is a winner! I like my sukiyaki served with an onion but other than that, I prepared it just as described. My husband even raved about the fantastic flavor of the tofu.

We just made and ate this. It was delicious. Had to leave the heat on for a couple of minutes to get the meat done. And we used ultra thin noodles because that is what we had, which did end up a little too soft, but every flavor was fantastic. We used four cups of watercress and this worked especially well. This is a very nice sukiyaki.

The ingredient hunting was part of the adventure. Assembling them was the next, and consuming them the final. Although salty, it was tasty.

The first time I enjoyed this was at a dinner during the new year's eve festivities. A wonderful way to enjoy friends and dinner and not the typical fondue. I found this recipe to be very close to the original. Try it at home!
