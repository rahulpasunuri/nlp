This recipe was simple and delicious, with the exception of the idea to tuck disgusting pre-made candies into the cream puffs. We tried a couple...messed up the taste, texture and purpose of a cream puff. Haha...I'm sorry, I have to laugh at the "cooking whiz" reviewer who was disappointed there was no cream in the dough. I can relate...I went to all the trouble to murder Dan and Suzzette Wellington, then when I dragged them home it turned out they were totally unnecessary for my beef Wellington and crepe suzzettes! Doh!!! Note: curd works with a variety of fruit juices. I made a variety of puffs with lemon, passionfruit, pomegranate, etc for a spring outdoor party, and they were great.

the directions for the cream must be wrong. You fold the curd INTO the whipped cream in 3 additions. Then it stays nice and fluffy! I thought the puff pastry turned out great but they're right about the temp/time. something's wrong there! Use lower temp and watch the time!

I only made the pastry cream as a filler for prebaked shells. I used 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 1/2, and let the curd cool to room temp before I added the whipped cream. The consistency is perfect, and it's delicious--I could have just eaten the lemon curd by itself, too. :)

I just did this! It's great. The filling is a little too sweet for me. But overall, it's awesome. I'm planning to do that again! :D

I made this recipe for my in-laws and their friends for a dinner party and they were a HIT! This is a very standard choux pastry, and you really have to follow the pastry directions exactly for them to turn out correctly. Pate a choux is complex and finicky, so be aware of that before you try to make these. I was thankful for the other reviews though so I was forewarned on the temp. There's a serious issue with the time/temperature on this recipe. I turned the temp on the oven down and they were done in about 15 minutes. I hovered over them at first until I they were browned enough and went ahead and pulled them out. They were perfect. You just need to watch your first batch then taste them when you think they're brown enough and see if they're done throughout.

This is quite an odd recipie the cream puffs which actually have no cream in them are terrible but the filling is fantastic. The actual process for making the puffs I thought was unusual and they tastes like buttery scrambled eggs and when you put them in the refrigerator to cool they completely flatten out. The filling however is quite good and very easy to make but I would suggest using it for something else because it is just a waste on these puffs. I would not make these puffs again however I might make the filling again if I can find a different puff recipie.

I made only the puffs because I had a filling already. They came out wonderful! Next time I will try the filling too.

Maybe I didn't do them right, but they were essentially flavorless and the cream ended up all runny. I might try them again, but over all, for the effort involved, they weren't worth it.

I'm going to have to try again. I had problems with the whipped cream going flat when I folded it into the lemon curd. I don't quite get how hot lemond curd and cold whipped cream are supposed to go together without one (the whipped cream) falling down. The resulting soup was really tasty though and I ate a lot of it. The puffs don't taste like anything on their own, and don't eat the dough before it's baked. It's awful. Anyway, like the others before me mentioned, watch them like a hawk because they'll be done well before the suggested cooking times. All in all, I want to like this recipe, but I didn't succeed this time around.

I usually follow an old family recipe for cream puffs, but didn't have it with me. The recipe for the dough was normal, but I really don't understand the temperature directions on this. My first batch burned within the first 13 minutes of being in at 425. I reduced the heat to 375 and my next batch came out just fine. The lemon curd filling was superb. I piped it into my puffs, which created a pleasant surprise for the guests. I'll stick to my family recipe, but definitely a decent replacement.

Okay, I don't know what went wrong, but these cream puffs did not work. The dough was runny and could not hold any shape. I've made cream puffs before with no problem. I noticed that this recipe calls for more butter than some but don't know if that's the problem. The filling is excellent. I had to run out and buy puff pastry to replace the cream puffs for my dinner party tonight.

I only wantet to make the puffs because I have my own cream to fill them up. I LOVE how they came out!!! Firm, tall, and beautiful! Thank you!

Made exactly as written and they turned out perfectly. The lemon curd with the whipped cream folded in is really delightful; lighter than a typical pudding or custard filling. Pastries like this just aren't that great held over in the fridge.. If they kept for a longer time I would give them another fork!

We had the same problem with the puffs baking much faster than indicated. We just watched them and pulled them out of the oven when they were a beautiful brown. We added diced strawberries to the whipped cream/lemon curd filling and everyone loved them.

We made 4 desserts for Easter lunch.. these were the HIT of the party. The only problem/question i have is about the baking time. I have new decor ovens (that have been calibrated) and the first two trays baked really quickly (17 min) and were way too dark. So I baked another single sheet. I cooked them 15 minutes then briefly opened the oven (to let a bit of heat escape) and turned the temp to 350. They only took 10 minutes more before they were fully cooked. Did anyone else have problems?

A bit labor intensive. Skip the pastry bag and use a teaspoonful. Very yummy results.
