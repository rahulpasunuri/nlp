i only cooked the plums on the stove for 20 min. at that point i had caramelization starting to happen and the plums were soft. i also made a quick Pâte Brisée instead of puff pastry, which i've never believed was quite right for Tatin style tarts. i made both the plums and the dough the night before and assembled and baked the tart the next morning. very easy and quite delicious. though as one reviewer pointed out, it's not exactly a pretty dessert. definitely more rustic. perfect for casual affairs, picnics, even brunch perhaps.

I don't believe that picture shows plums that have been cooked for 35 minutes! I ended up with something like a runny jam on top of a slab of slightly gooey pasty. It was fine with some ice cream but I probably won't make it again. Next time I'll make a crisp with the plums.

I agree with the cook from Rochester. I ended up baking off individual puff pastry tart shells and using the plums for "filling" Flavors were great, just too much liquid for the puff pastry, as written.

This was easy, tasted good and presented well. Half the plums I used were ripe and the other half were just on the cusp. I used a 10" skillet instead of 9" and just accommodated. My plums didn't seem too syrupy at all, especially because the dessert needs to set for a few hours before serving. Using puff pastry was a snap. Only complaint was that it was too sweet so next time I make it, I will cut the sugar by a 1/3 cup. Vanilla ice cream did help to cut down the sweetness, but it was still pretty sweet. I served it at a dinner party and it was a hit. Color was gorgeous.

If your plums are even slightly on the ripe side rather than firm you will end up with too much juice like I did. I remedied this by stirring in approximately 1/4 cup of instant tapioca into the sauce while it was still simmering on the stovetop. This thickened the sauce so that only a small amount of juice was running on the plate just like the featured recipe photo. I suggest you have some instant (minute) tapioca on hand and after about 25 minutes on the stove you should be able judge whether you need to thicken the sauce slightly. Add the instant tapioca a tablespoon at a time and stir it into the sauce real well. Let it simmer a minute or two and then add a little more until it resembles a slightly thickened fruit sauce. Keep in mind that the sauce will continue to thicken as the tapioca continues to cook and as you continue baking it in the oven. It will continue to thicken even more as it cools.

This recipe was simple to make and very tasty. FYI for those who don't know, ( I didn't) there is no need to blanche the plums. My dessert did not create excess syrup, however it is not a 'pretty dessert'.

I agree that there was too much sauce, maybe reducing the butter/sugar would help. Nice use of seasonal plums. Also halve the recipe for a small family; it will not keep.

Although very sweet, the flavors are good, and the creme fraiche is a nice contrast. However the amount of juice produced by the plums was so great, that what was produced was a soupy mess and when turned out just swamped the puff pastry.
