I make this recipe every year for Christmas because amongst all the spice, mint and sugar stuff the lemon is a refreshing change. I stumbled across these one day and while the preparation is a bit tedious... the bars are FANTASTIC. They are the first things to go in my cookie tins every year, and we triple the batch!

These were a big disappointment, not enough filling and too much crust and streusel. Ina Garten's recipe is far superior.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was a disaster. I had to throw the entire thing out. The "streusel" topping was like another thick layer of crust; the egg filling tasted like sweet scrambled eggs, and the bottom crust was nothing special. I threw out the entire pan. This recipe definitely needs some major reworking - as other members have suggested, reducing the cooking time of the filling; eliminating the topping, etc.

These bars were a little time counsuming to make but were very good. I did expect them to be a little more tart though with all the lemon juice and zest. Next time I might try cutting down the sugar by 1/4 cup and adding a more zest to get that more tart than sweet flavor.

I had to make these in a pan smaller than what was called for which is maybe why the streusel topping was such a mess. The lemon bars were absolutely delicious though! All my friends loved them!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe with a few minor changes. I used the base/crust recipe from the Double Lemon Bars on this site: 2 cups flour, 1 cup unsalted butter (room temperature), 2/3 cup powdered sugar, and added my own addition of 1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts (for crunch.) I baked the base at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. I then lowered the temperature of the oven to 325 degrees. The only changes I made to the filling were: an increase in the lemon juice to 3/4 cup and an increase of the lemon peel to 1/4 cup (finely grated.) I also scraped the pulp from the lemons into the filling. After pouring the lemon filling over the hot crust, I sprinkled 1/2 cup toasted macadamia nuts over the filling and baked it for 30 minutes. I then followed the directions for the streusel as given in the recipe. I got rave reviews and many requests for the recipe! It's the only recipe I'll use in the future! Yum!

Mmmmboy! These are some tasty bars. I was lazy, so I made them sans streusel, but they are still wonderful, and look nice dusted with powdered sugar. I only used 7 eggs total - rather than toss extra whites left from the crust, I used them with 5 more whole eggs in the filling. So much better than the boxed lemon bar mix, and not too hard - try them!

I am looking for some entertaining summer desserts and will try this one. Any presentation ideas? Thanks

This is the best of at least 5 recipes I have tried for lemon squares. I also used about 1/4 more lemon juice. To crisp up the streusel topping, I also put it under the broiler for just a minute.

I love this recipe!! I have made these umpteen dozen times for my clients. A tip: for something a little different, I layer the struesel topping with the lemon filling, and bake it all together, I have tried adding about a 1/2 cup more lemon juice to cut the sweetness a bit, and you can also substitute lime juice for 1/2 the lemon for a lemon lime bar, and it works out great. This recipe can be made in tart forms, for an awesome lemon tart. Very versitile recipe!!!

These are delicious. Used more lemon juice, as others suggested.

It had good reviews at my party. I liked them but thought they would be more lemony. I will try adding more lemon juice next time.

I loved the way the different layers looked. Though I had problems with the timing: the shortbread took forever in the oven, and the lemon filling was set in just 12 minutes. Finally, the streusel wouldn't turn golden, so I put it under the broiler. In the end it turned out quite nice but very buttery. :o)

This is a good recipe but I doubled the lemon juice like another reviewer said and I was really strong. If you are going to increase the lemon you need to increase the sugar as well. The consistency was good and they looked good. I'll have to work with it. These are more of the rich and decadent style than the dainty lemon bar style.

This recipe was delicious! My husband loved it too. I followed some of the reviews and used double the lemon juice (1 cup) and used powdered sugar for the topping instead. I highly recommend using 1 cup of lemon juice vs. 1/2 cup, I thought it was just right. Any less would have been too eggy. Definitely a recipe that will be kept in the family!

I have tried many lemon bar recipes over the years and never found one that I liked better than this one. These bars are AMAZING!

I will have to stop in at 60th Street Desserts and try a lemon bar to compare it to my batch. I was not pleased with the results of my efforts. It just didn't have enough lemon zing and the filling was too eggy for my taste. I thought it could have been a bit sweeter as well.

Try the other lemon bar recipe on this website, as it has a much more vibrant lemon taste. This wasn't bad, but the other recipe is sooo much better!

The topping was very bland, and I agree that the filling lacked punch. Could've used more lemon flavor/juice. I would skip the topping next time and just go with powdered sugar.

Living in a hot, sticky climate, I was attracted to the idea of a streusel topping, as the usual powdered sugar would melt in 5 minutes. The topping, in fact, was just fine. However, the lemon filling lacked punch. Next time I'll make it using my regular filling recipe of 4 eggs and only 6 Tbs. flour. Then it should be great.

Great lemon bars! Shredded fresh coconut on the top before finishing the topping adds a nice touch.

I was surprised at the other reviews. I really liked this recipe - the bars were moist and tangy. I did omit the topping and topped them with powdered sugar instead. I have made them over and over again! They are quite addictive! So, don't hesitate to give this recipe a try!

I followed the recipe exactly and feel it is probably not the same as the one served in the restaurant. The bars were pasty and the topping like sawdust. I'll stick with the regular lemon bar I know. I felt the flour in the filling was unnecessary.

I had to use a glass baking dish as opposed to a metal one, and failed to adjust my cooking time. Lemon bars are not salvageable if they are overcooked...I bet these would've tasted great...

I personally think cold lemon containing baked goods taste like metal, but my barbeque guests loved them. I'd make it again, but use some combination of raspberries/blackberries/blueberries.

Absolutely delicious
