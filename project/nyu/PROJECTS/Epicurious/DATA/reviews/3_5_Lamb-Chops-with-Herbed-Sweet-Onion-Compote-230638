This recipe is ok, but one needs to determine the lamb cooking time based on the size of the chops. 4 minutes is not enough, I used five and when I make it again may go to seven. The onions need longer as well, especially if you want to have some degree of caramelization. Perhaps it would be best to start them by themselves and then finish them in the skillet used for the lamb. I'd cut down on the vinegar as well.

Delicious. I added a small amount of lemon juice as another reviewer suggested, and I believe that really made the dish. I am making this for my son tomorrow night.

I liked this as I am a huge fan of vinegar. I think a rice vinegar would be better though as the white wine vinegar overshadows the lamb. I will make this again though, with rice vinegar.

Very nice. The compote could be used with roast lamb as well. I added some sugar to the compote as I didn't have sweet onions and used pickled onions instead.

If there are only 2 reviews both very favorable, how can the rating be only 50% ? I thought it was a quick and easy everyday meal, made no changes.

We enjoyed this very much. I added some lemon juice and more garlic to the herb mixture and marinated the lamb chops for a few hours. Then to the compote I added some chardonnay (what we were drinking with the lamb) along with the flavoured white wine vinegar. I also blended the compote with an immersion blender.

This was great. The mint and oregano were great together. Easy and delicious.
