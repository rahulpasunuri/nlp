You do indeed use only 1/2 cup of flour! These cookies are to die for. My go-to chocolate cookie from now on. They bake perfectly on Silpats. Make again? Oh yes, yes, and YES!

Read all the issues with runny batter, and looked at the recipe again. A HALF CUP of flour for all those ingredients? Eggs, butter, sugar, chocolate. I don't think I've ever made a cookie with only a half-cup flour. So, I figured it was a typo, and I added a total of one and a half cups flour. Easy, delicious, a great kind of meringue texture. I toasted hazelnuts for a more Nutella slant.

These are wonderfully flavorful. I followed the recipe as-is, except for making the cookies smaller in the last batch I baked. I think they ended up slightly gooier in the middle than I would have preferred when they were the size recommended in the recipe. The last batch was chewy and soft but not quite gooey in the middle when I made them slightly smaller. They were a hit with friends and coworkers. Lots of "Oh wow!" comments after biting into them. Will absolutely make again!

I make these cookies every year for Christmas and my family absolutely love them! I make them smaller but they do still take 15 minutes to bake and they turn out perfectly. If you dough turns out runny you probably didn't beat the eggs and sugar enough. You need to make sure you beat it together until its a creamy yellow color and should more than double in volume.

Update to an earlier review - I had a terrible time making cookies with this recipe - they were too thin and stuck to the wax paper. Well, looking at an enormous amount of cookie dough still left, I decided to spread it on a cookie sheet pan lined with wax paper and make a bar-type cookie instead. The results were excellent - chewy and delicious! Was thrilled I was able to rework the dough into something really good.

An unholy mess, I am sorry to say. The dough/batter was very thin, and completely stuck to the wax paper! The cookies ended up in crumbled pieces trying to get them off. The taste was okay, but nothing about this cookie lived up to the rave reviews.

This is the most awesome cookie ever. I believe this tops any chocolate chip recipe. I made some last night and I ate at least 10 of them. :) I think this is my favorite!

OK, what did I do wrong? Mine spread out too much and ended up being frisbees. I chilled them in the fridge for longer than called for and added some flour to a min-batch of them to see if that would help.

The batter has to be refrigerated before being dropped onto the parchment paper or it will be too thin or sticky. Yes, they freeze beautifully. I did try them with the raspberries using raspberry flavoring instead of the vanilla but that flavor did not come through. I used very good chocolate, so the chocolate flavor overpowered the raspberry flavoring. However the freeze dried raspberries from Trader Joe's in the chocolate cookie were delightful. Have come to the conclusion I will stay with the original recipe as adding the raspberries is quite costly, too much for a cookie that is good on it's own. One last note is that I use coffee flavoring instead of the vanilla in the original recipe, it really seems to bring out the flavor of the good quality chocolate.

Can you freeze these after baking?

I followed the recipe exactly and they are wonderful, actually sinfull. Thinking of using the basic recipe without the toffee and substituting dried raspberries for the toffee and raspberry flavoring for the vanilla so I will end up with a chocolate raspberry cookie. My mind also goes to chopped crystalized ginger with ginger liquor. Just ideas right now.

I love these cookies! A friend made it for me and then sent the recipe to me. I substituted pecans for walnuts but only because we had pecans on hand. I made a batch (with normal size cookies) and then froze the rest. Later, I took the frozen cookies straight out of the freezer onto a cold baking sheet lined with silpat and they turned out better than the fresh batch. They kept their shape and were not too delicate and still perfect moist in the center. I'll always freeze them first from now on. Also, I noticed that if I used wax paper they would stick. Use silpat instead! It makes it so much easier.

These cookies are amazing!!! I made them without the walnuts because my husband and I are not fans. Totally delicious. Made them for a party and they were gone in seconds. Should have made a double batch!

These are amazing! I made them 'normal' cookie size, because they are super rich and a large size seems too overwhelming. When they cool, they are chewy, and gooey, with chunks of melted and re-cooled toffee. The BEST cookies I have ever made, hands down. NOTE: I made my own toffee for these, too lazy to go buy pre-made. I don't know that it changed the texture from what the recipe states.

Wow wow wow. These cookies are amazing. I reduced the sugar a tad to 1.5 cups but added an extra Heath bar thanks to the advice of others. I refrigerated the dough overnight and almost got a blister on my hand from trying to scoop out so many portions the next day. Well worth the physical pain though... yum.

rich and delicious. I stuck to the recipe except a little less walnuts. I had the cookie size range from @1- 2 Tablespoons. It made quite a lot. As earlier reviewers note, spray the parchment and you will have no trouble with sticking. The ingredients are somewhat pricey due to so much chocolate as well as the heath bars (I used mini heath bars so was a little uncertain how many were needed)

Rating: 3
Yes, these are sinfully good, but not without issues. The suggested size IS atrociously large, as others have duly noted. And there is simply too much chocolate in this recipe (did I seriously just write that? Yes, it is so.) It's hard to justify the toffee pieces, as the flavor is lost in the rich chocoloate, and only adds to the caloric intake, not the flavor. Walnuts work very well here - keep them fairly chunky for the right texture. These are worth making once, but definitely won't be on my go-to list.

Rating: 3
The cookies tasted yummy and went over well. The only disconcerting part was that the chunky pieces of toffee were really hard as soon as the cookies cooled. I'd definitely make the toffee pieces smaller next time.

I just made these cookies and they are amazing!!! Like brownies in a cookie format! I did substitute pecans for walnuts (my preference) and made the cookies using a 2 tbsp scoop so they were half the size. I could not imagine making them using 1/4 cup of dough... that would just be too much sugar in one cookie for me. Great on their own but I am sure they would be superb with some really good vanilla bean ice cream sandwiched between them!

I made these when I first saw them in the March 2000 issue and they have never steered me wrong! I tend not to make them so big normally because most people dont, or more likely shouldn't, eat an entire one. I make them half size at most and on top of a small scoop of vanilla bean ice cream or with some really good, strong espresso! Heaven in a cookie for those who love chocolate and toffee YUM!

How is this not at 4 forks?!? This cookie is AMAZING. If you use the right ingredients it's the best chocolate cookie you've ever made! I purchased a pound of Ghiradelli 73% (?) chocolate bars. For the toffee bars, I bought Almond Roca and chopped it in a Cuisinart. I skipped the walnuts, Almond Roca took care of the nuts. I've made these twice and everyone raves about them. They will puff up and then flatten out when cooled. I also scoop the balls then freeze and bag them. Take them straight out of the freezer and bake when needed, they come out perfect!

These cookies are amazing! If you're a chocoholic like me, you'll love them. Very chewy with a brownie flavor. I added chocolate chips instead of nuts because my husband doesn't like nuts in cookies, but still delicious! One thing -- I chilled the batter for 45 min as directed, but it was still not very firm so I chilled it for an hour total.

I made these with cashew brittle instead of toffee, so that might be my problem... I thought these cookies were a little one dimensional, and that one dimension had a kind of weird, heavy flavor. The texture was great, but I was just not impressed with the flavor. I made a second batch of the base cookie replacing the walnuts and toffee with tart cherries and almonds and those were delightful. I will be making my variation again.

Made these in July for the first time and they were perfect and out of this world. I tried making them 2 days ago and the chocolate went all dry and yucky before I could mix it all together, so tossed out the chocolate and gave up. Tried again tonight and something else went wrong grrr the mixture isn't as thick and when I cooked them, I ended up with one big giant cookie!

OMG these are absolutely the best cookies I've ever tasted. They have a brownie type look and taste to them, but they are also light, like meringue. You need to buy the best chocolate for these and also add chunks of pecans, chocolate and toffee to it. Do not put in little pieces - the bigger the chunks of nuts and chocolate, the better. I used pecan halves, mini Hersey kisses, you can buy them for baking and I bought Skor toffee backing pieces - not big enough so next time I will buy some Skor bars and break them into chunks. Everyone was so taken with these they couldn't stop talking about how good and different they were. Don't make them smaller than the recipe state - Have one big cookie, rather than picking at 5 of them. It's really hard to stop eating them ;-)

Rating: 0
Very easy, straightforward recipe. The cookies came out super-chocolately, almost like brownies. I made them with Cadbury chocolate-covered soft toffee because that's all my supermarket had; next time I'll look for hard toffee (Heath bars) to give them that classic toffee crunch. Because some reviewers mentioned that they got stuck to the parchment paper, I greased it with a little vegetable shortening and had no problems lifting them off. All in all, very yummy and I'm sure I'll make them again.

Ohhhh man these are delicious!! I made them for all my friends (after tearing them away from the dough, which is as good as the finished cookies) and they loved them (even my pro-baker friend)! The recipe is a little more high maintenance than a normal cookie recipe but sooo worth it. I had some trouble with the cookies sticking and I realized I had the wrong side of the wax paper up (so not the recipe's fault!) I would add even more heath and keeps the chunks big. YUM. Make these! They're bomb.com!!

This cookie is a keeper!! I used the bittersweet Ghiradelli, left the health bars in chunks and they were amazing. I do recommend NOT chilling the batter longer than 20 minutes, it becomes very hard and difficult to work with. I used the 2 tbsp scoop,baked them 15 minutes as recommended and they turned out perfectly. I can see serving these cookies with a scoop of Hagen Daz vanilla! They were devoured by my eight graders!

These are fabulous! I made them with Ghiradelli bittersweet choc chips and medium ground Health toffee chunks. These are easy to make and oh so yummy. I made 12 cookies using a 1/4 cup scoop and 28 using a 2 Tablespoon scoop out of this recipe. I cooked them both 15 minutes. The smaller ones were better for my potluck but the larger ones look like cookies from a bakery.

This is a keeper. I am not a huge chocolate cookie fan, but even I liked them, and everyone else loved them. They were a little sweet for me; I used Nestles chocolate chips...next time might use bittersweet. They are quite rich. I bought a bag of mini-Heath bars because they were cheaper than individual bars. If you do this, use 30 mini-bars for the recipe. I also made them small and they were fine that way. I think I baked them for about 11 minutes.

These cookies are amazing! They are so chocolatey and delicious, I have made them twice now, and both times they came out perfectly! I prefer a smaller cookie, cooked them on wax paper for 11 minutes and they came out perfect. I did use Guittard chocolate on the second round, and I have to say it was worth the money,they were so much better! I even cooked half, saved the second half in the fridge and cooked them up the next day....batter was a little more difficult to work with, but they cooked just as well the second day as they did the first.

Oh my GOSH!! I only saw this recipe today, and after reading several pages of reviews, I knew I had to try it. I followed the recipe exactly except for adding an additional Heath bar which was suggested by one reviewer. I cleaned out my pantry of chocolate which needed to be used, including 9 squares of semi-sweet chocolate, a 3.5 oz. bittersweet bar (Lindt) and made up the difference with chocolate chips. I had thought about using some milk chocolate, but now that I've tasted the finished cookie, I think it would be too sweet. Used a 1/4 c. measuring cup and the finished cookies are GORGEOUS. Since I never stop at just one or two regular-sized cookies anyway, these were a perfect size for me. They are super easy, they don't dirty a lot of dishes, and they satisfied my craving for something sweet but special after a long day at the office. A huge thank you to the reviewers on this site. I NEVER make a dish from Epicurious.com w/o reading several pages of reviews. I can always count on getting good information here.

Awesome!! When I made them, I thought my chocolate had seized, so I made another batch of chocolate. "Seized" again, but tried them anyway. Dough looked just fine, but only had toffee chips. Made giant ones with Heath bar pieces and smaller ones with toffee chips. Both recipes were great! I will make these over and over again! They are cookies that work for me.

Rating: 4
I made these yesterday encouraged by the many comments and I agree they are wonderful! Chilled the dough for the required time and I found the batter that I used last that had chilled for 2X that amount was still very easy to scoop and drop. Beating the eggs and sugar the required time (almost a meringue consistency) seemed to help. I made smaller cookies (12 cookies per large, 12" X 17" cookie sheet) and even at that they are a generous size. Baked at 350F for 10-11 minutes (just until a few start to look like they are slightly flatter) and let cool on the sheet for a few minutes before lifting off the Silpat or they would break up or crumble. Also found a stainless steel spatula best for lifting vs. a non-stick which ironically did stick to the toffee. I used my own toffee that I had made and not used for a candy recipe and just smashed it up for "chips". These are best eaten cool when they become fudgy and chewy with a wonderful flavour. Thanks everyone for all the great tips and reviews. It sure helps the finished product.

Exceptional cookie! Made it for the family Christmas gathering, and it was met with rave reviews. I made the cookies exactly as directed and found that the oven temperature was a little too high and the cook time was a little too long. 12 minutes at 325 seemed to be exactly right in my oven - make sure you keep a careful watch on your first batch of cookie so they don't burn.

I make a huge batch of this every year for the holidays. It has also gone over well as "thank you" gifts in the past. People LOVE them! The chocolate and toffee bars make these cookies a little pricey, and there is a little more labor involved than in your average cookie, but this one is sooooo worth it. Sometimes I omit the nuts or scoop smaller cookies, but following the recipe as printed will give terrific results.

These cookies are high maintenance but worth every second's effort.

These are so worth the effort and expense. Do yourself a favor and a) don't chill the dough for longer than 45 (I'd do 35 min or less), as the dough becomes ROCK hard and so difficult to work with; and b) use a #16 ice cream scoop (that's about 1/3 C.) to scoop these cookies, then smoosh them down by a goodly amount before baking. I've made them several times and now chill the dough for about 1/2 hour then portion out the dough on the cookie sheet (it makes exactly 18) and bake them in the next day or so (wrap the sheet so they don't dry out). I'd think that you could even freeze the dough as individual cookie "pucks" and bake as needed (trust me, after you try these, you will absolutely NEED them) for about 19 minutes. You could even add about 1/2 C. more walnuts.

Amazing! I made these cookies for a family party and the next day my inbox was full of people asking for the recipe! A bit expensive but so well worth it. And making them gaint it part of the fun! Feel guilty afterwards and take the plunge into a (big) piece of heaven. Happy cooking!

Whenever I ask friends and family what their favorite cookie is, these get brought up! I have to disagree with the previous reviewer about the Heath bar. It it definently worth it to chop up the candy bars instead of using the bits. I have also experimented with making them smaller, and they are equally good. (Just make sure you adjust the cooking time.)

I have made these awesome cookies several times and have the following tips. 1. I made these cookies one year at Christmas and they did not keep well (got dried out). My advice is to make them and eat them all within 2 or 3 days at the most. (Not hard to do; they are that good). 2. I no longer make them giant, but just like regular size cookies and adjust the cooking time down. 3. The Heath bits sold near the chocolate chips are a great timesaver. Yes, you don't get the large chunks in your cookies that you get from chopping Heath bars yourself, but the extra effort is not worth it, IMO. Everything else about this recipe is though. These cookies rock!

These scrumptious cookies were even better after a couple of days! A little crunch with a lot of chewiness inside...it's absolute heaven with (not too sweet) coffee ice cream! The only change that I would make is to cut back on the sugar, it was a tad too sweet. I used 70% cocoa valhrona chocolate, and I guess I was looking for more bitter than sweet cookies. Minor adjustment... but will definitely make it again!

To the cook from New York: if you can try it next time with a hand mixer for the eggs and sugar, that might solve the problem. Because they have you beat for a full five minutes, it could be the air (or lack of air) that caused your cookies to be a little flat. Good luck - and definitely give it another try if you can!

I just made these cookies and they did not come out well. There were so many good reviews that I am sure it's my fault. They came out very flat and the toffee seemed to melt a lot. I was wondering if anyone could give me advice to what might have gone wrong. I followed the recipe exactly, but I don't have an electric mixer so I did all the beating and stirring by hand. I wonder if I did not get enough air into them? I would really like to try them again.

Phenomenal! I made more smaller cookies so I could share them around with more people. They were grateful. The one tip I would suggest is to be very careful about the last few minutes they are in the oven-- it's easy to leave them in a minute too long and burn the bottom of the cookies.

These cookies are worth every second of their preparation. You CANNOT skip the refrigeration part. Also, don't chop the candy bars too finely. They are UNBELIEVABLE. I like them best made the same day. Plus, as you need to keep the dough refrigerated you can make it up and use it when you need it. I gave a bag of frozen dough balls to a coworker with baking instructions and he said they were perfect.

I've been making these cookies since 2000 when they first showed up on Epicurious. I can't recommend this recipe enough - I made them again yesterday and was curious to see the latest comments on the recipe. It's probably too late, but a poster in 3/08 mentioned her melted chocolate chips didn't melt - that it just turned into a paste. It sounds like your chocolate seized - either it was over-heated or you may have gotten some water in there. The chocolate should be thoroughly melted and velvety - like a fondue. You can avoid seizing by definitely using the double boiler as the recipe says. If you don't have a double-boiler, just put a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water. Important: do not let the bowl touch the simmering water! You want steam, not contact with the heat. Melt slowly and evenly and stir a lot - don't rush the process. I hope this helps you and any other bakers that encounter this problem - please try the cookies again, you won't be disappointed! I use Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate bars and Skor toffee bars. As some other reviewers said, I chop the Skor bars very coarsely so there are nice big chunks of toffee. I also would not leave out the toasted walnuts - they give the cookies great complexity in flavor and texture. To me, the cookies are better when thoroughly cooled. I use parchment paper every time - I would not mess with waxed paper. Good luck and enjoy!

These cookies are sooo delicious...the cookies are in between a brownie and cookie texture. I used bittersweet chocolate chips. I followed the recipe, but decided to cut back on the sugar and used only 1 cup. I still think the cookie was a bit sweet, next time I'll probably use only 3/4 cup. I made the cookies smaller too, got a little over 2 dozens. Definitely a keeper and will make again.

I made these for Christmas and just like everyone says, they were SOOOOOOOOO good. I got rave reviews. People just loved them. I gave them out as presents. I had to modify the ingrediants.

Making my mouth water now just thinking about them. I thought the nuts were fantastic. Chop them up pretty small.

My son and grandson have voted these "The best cookie ever" and renamed them "Chocolate Gigis". Gigi is my Grandmother name. Definitely increase the toffee and make the toffee pieces bigger.

These were the most amazingly delicious cookies I've ever eaten. Move over brownies, you have met your match! I decided to make the cookies a bit smaller--a little less than 1/8 cup dough from a medium-sized cookie scoop. They spread out to be about 3" in diameter. Cooked for 14 minutes they were perfectly crackled and wonderfully chewy. I took a previous reviewer's advice and made the Heath bar chips somewhat large so the flavor would be more evident. Oh, and I went with Ghiradelli's semisweet chocolate chips. These cookies are way too good. Aside from the amazing taste, another great thing was how quick they were to put together. It took me no more than 15 minutes to have them ready to chill.

These were great! And yes they are "Giant" so maybe next time I'll try making smaller ones as people have suggested. The only hesitation with these were that they did seem to pack a lot of sugar, so I might decrease the amount next time.

Excellent cookies but quite prone to burning on the bottoms if you a) do not use parchment paper and b) do not watch them closely. Lack of parchment paper caused smoke to pour out of my oven! With parchment paper, however, these came out perfectly. Also, use 6 (not 5) Heath bars and chop them into slightly larger pieces (I aimed for the size of one chocolate chip but next time will aim for the size of approximately three chocolate chips.) Their flavor gets lost a bit, otherwise. Lengthy refrigeration makes the dough very tough (a sturdy ice cream scoop helped me, although next time I'll try rolling the dough into a log first, as suggested in another helpful review.) Finally, instead of super-sizing I made these into about 50 smaller cookies. They took 13 minutes to come out moist and burn-free! Delicious!

These were the best cookies I have ever made. Insanely good! I used a 1/8 cup measure for smaller cookies. I made with nuts and without nuts and they were much better with the nuts.

I wonder if I missed the boat on these cookies. Found the dough to be a very odd consistency (very thin before chilling, extremely tough after chilling). The finished product was too rich for my taste (or most people's, judging by which cookies flew out of the tin fastest). Also had trouble with burnt bottoms- have not had this problem with any other cookies in my oven.

Wow! Fabulous cookie to say the least. I made the recipe as written and these are perfect cookies. I think my neighbors are going to be happy with their cookie box this Christmas. Pour a tall cold glass of milk with these.YUMM

Definitely worth making. I went with 3/4 C flour (the thinness of the unchilled dough scared me), double the salt, and coarsely broken Heath bars. Maybe I didn't need to worry about the thinness - by the time it was chilled in the frig, I just about bent a spoon trying to get the dough out of the bowl and onto the pans. The cookies both tasted great and kept a good shape. (I kept the dough in the refrigerator till I dropped them on each cookie sheet.) And because they're so rich, you need not make them so large. With the first batch I made large ones as the recipe said - and they are impressive - although the bigger they were, the flatter they looked. After that I went smaller, which I prefer. I cooled the cookies completely on the parchment paper (I just slid each batch off the hot cookie sheet onto my granite counter), then moved them off the paper when cooled. At the office 5 women tasted them and the cookies got 2 wows, one amazing, and one lady said she had to sit down to enjoy it.

Also, I made regular sized cookies and it made over 60! And, as mentioned below, the dough does work better chilled.

These cookies are delicious! I made them both with and without the nuts... I liked them better without. I will definitely make them again next Christmas!

Outstanding cookie, especially if you are a chocolate lover. I made a smaller cookie, about 2 tablespoons of dough instead of the 1/4 cup. The dough is quite sticky and very firm if refrigerated too long, as I did. I found it much easier to handle it by forming the dough into a log wrapped in aluminum foil. The dough is much easier to slice than to scoop out when thoroughly chilled.

DELICIOUS!! These cookies are amazing...even my husband (who usually doesn't rave) loved them! They are soft and chewy like a brownie, but oh so much better with the health bar!! I'm making another batch now, since the batch I made for the teachers is already gone!! :)

Yes, these are most definately CRACK cookies. I made the dough 2 days ahead (try not eating the dough, THAT was brutal). Left out the nuts, used fake eggs. I made them 1/2 Tbls size, and cooked them on parchment for 16 minutes.(Kept the dough in fridge between batches). They are KILLER! I just hope they last for my party in 2 days!!

These are not for the faint of heart! Using a quality chocolate would be a must in my opinion; not Hershey's chocolate chips. I doubled the recipe and added a few more Tbsp of flour plus a small amount of cinnamon. Heath bars in chunks seems much better than the small heath chips. Baked on parchment (wax paper sounded so odd) without any sticking at all. Cookies don't flatten out as much as the picture shows, but perhaps that is because I put these in the garage to cool overnight (ran out of time) and the dough is quite solid and cumbersome to spoon out of the bowl. Next time, I'll chill for the 2 hours. There will be a next time! I wish I had made 1/2 without nuts so those who don't eat nuts could enjoy.

I made these with a few extra tablespoons of flour, without the nuts, and refrigerated the dough for a good two hours before baking. I made small cookies, and cooked them for about 12-13 minutes. They came off the parchment paper easily after cooling on the pans for 30 minutes or so. These are delicious cookies!

Rating: 4
The ONLY problem with these cookies is that they are addicting - I have to double the recipe because my family loves them so much, they don't last but a few days. The only thing I changed was that I added white chocolate chips just to offset the color. Hands down the best cookie recipe. My husband also calls them "Crack cookies".

Rating: 4
This recipe was fantastic! I made a few small changes. I doubled the recipe to make the cookies for a work function. I used bags of chocolate-covered Heath bits, and used 3 for the double recipe instead of two, but omitted nuts. I let the dough chill for about two hours. The double recipe yielded about 45 large cookies and 10 small. The cookies burnt a bit on the bottom, so I reduced the cooking time to 13.5 minutes, and they turned out perfectly. They taste a lot like brownies, which are one of my favorite desserts, so I loved them. The cookies were a huge hit with everyone else, and I will definitely keep this recipe!

I made these at home and chilled them overnight. I baked them at work the next day (I work for my husband who is a chef). He and several of his cooks tried them and they were a hit. My husband even said they were possibly the best chocolate cookies he had ever had! You definately cannot go wrong with this recipe. I agree with the person who said big chunks of Heath candy bars are best and would add that I like a little more salt.

Rating: 4
These were fabulous. I made them with Lindt bittersweet chocolate. I've made them twice--the first time I subbed pecans for the walnuts and didn't cook them as long; both mistakes. The slight astringency of the walnuts is needed to contrast with the chocolate, and they do need to be dry on top or they are unappealingly uncooked in the middle. Both times I made them with a bag of Heath bits, and next time I will either add two bags to punch up the toffee flavor, or I will chop the candy bars. I think that larger chunks of toffee would make for a better cookie. I also added milk chocolate chips the second time and loved the contrast with the very bittersweet chocolate. These are still crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside two days later--a real winner! Lastly, I ran out of parchment and used waxed paper as the recipe suggested. Big mistake--now I have wax all over my baking sheet and I'm having trouble getting it off.

I have made these cookies at least a dozen times, always to rave reviews. My family call them "crack" cookies because they're so addictive. Some tips that I hope are helpful: I use a stand mixer and beat the eggs and sugar until thick and light lemon colored ; this usually takes longer than 5 minutes and seems to be the key to the cookies turning out properly. I use parchement paper to bake them on and let them cool slightly on the baking sheet before moving them. Sometimes they require more than the 45 minute chill time in the fridge before baking. Give these cookies a chance, they're terrific.

Delicious! Only notes - letting them rest in the fridge for a day makes them better - richer flavor, denser. They're fabulous after the 45 min in the fridge but something about that extra time really helps. Also, I love STUFF in my cookies so next time I'll add more Heath. Otherwise - perfect!

Made these over the weekend. Turned out great - in taste and presentation. I baked them on Reynolds Release foil and didn't have any problems with sticking as others have noted. I think one of the tricks with this recipe is making sure that the dough is well chilled before baking. My kitchen was warm when I scooped these onto the cookie sheet, so I put the entire sheet with the dough balls back in the fridge for a while to chill again. The result was prefectly shaped cookies. Next time, I would probably add more walnuts and maybe even more toffee. I did use crushed toffee bars, but would probably just use the Heath bits in the baking aisle next time. Great recipe - a keeper!

I had no trouble with these cookies at all - followed the recipe *exactly* and they turned out perfectly delicious and looked exactly like the picture. They are part cookie, part brownie, part melted fudge - if you know someone who loves chocolate and brownies - stop what you're doing and make these for them! I stored the leftover cookie dough balls in the frig and just make a few at a time. They'd make a great hostess gift - bake a few and then give them the rest of the dough balls (frozen) with baking instructions.

I really liked this recipe. It's really more of a brownie than a cookie and that's fine. It's definitely a crowd- pleaser. The one disappointment was I think the toffee flavor got a little lost. I might up the toffee a bit next time. I would also probably add a pinch of fluer de sel on the top of each cookie to bring out the chocolate more and make them more interesting. P.s. "NY Cook": that's 1 and 3/4 cups brown sugar -- recipes on here often read that way.

Had to halve and Anglicise the recipe (and substitute quartered chocolate eclairs as I couldn't find anything remotely like described bars)..oh, and I used cashews as I've run out of walnuts...and I flattened them a touch which made them less cake like and baked them on what we Limeys call Silicone sheets (reusable impregnated fabric).

the problem with this recipe is that the cookies stick to the waxed paper. you end up having to scrape off bits of cookies and throw away half of them. i tried spraying with pam--didn't work. it's a serious flaw in the recipe. the only thing that kind of worked was when i took the cookies out of the oven and immediately scraped them off and transfered them to a wire rack.

I made these cookies for a cocktail party/game night for small group of friends. I was worried I would experience some of the problems people have stated here (runny cookies) but they turned out perfectly! I made the dough early in the morning and baked the cookies almost 12 hours later. I also put the cookie sheets in my freezer so they were ice cold. I made "normal"" sized cookies and baked for about 9 minutes. They were beautiful. I expected to have half of the batch left over for a dinner party the following night but I was only left with about 6 cookies. I caught my friend stuffing a few in an empty Wheat Thin box on her way out the door and my sister has already requested them to take on her spring break next week.

These cookies are fantastic, and they're as chewy and good the next day as they are the first day. Everyone who ate one raved. I think the key is to bake them until they're done but still very soft; that will keep them chewy the next day as well. The second time I made them I did increase the amounts of both walnuts and heath bars, and we all preferred them this way.

These cookies were great right out of the oven, but when they cooled, their texture changed, which I didn't care for. They weren't chewy anymore and were instead cakey and light. Is that how they're supposed to be? I did make these cookies using heaping tablespoons instead of 1/4 cupfuls. I decreased the baking time to around 10 min, which others had suggested, but they weren't cooked all the way through so I had to pop them back in the oven for about 5 more minutes. Maybe that was a mistake? But after 10 minutes the batter was still raw. I also used semisweet chocolate chips instead of chopped chocolate. It worked out fine, although when I tried to melt the chocolate, it didn't really melt...it just turned into a paste...is that what's supposed to happen or is it supposed to be runny? Maybe it's because I used chips? I also left out the nuts. It could probably use about a couple more toffee bars too.

If it weren't for all the positive reviews I would have thought the proportions were off or I messed up. 1/2 cup flour and pound of melted chocolate and really thin batter, what? but I was wrong. Man these are delicious! A chocolate lovers dream. Crispy on the outside and fudgy chewy on the inside. Chilling the dough at least 30 mins is a must and I returned the bowl to the fridge between batches. I didn't make giants, instead used a small melon or sorbet scoop with a blade to push out the contents. That was really handy for this sticky dough. Baked the smaller ones 10-12 mins. I took the advice of a previous poster and added 2 more Skor bars and they were perfect. Don't chop the bars too small. Even though the chunks seem to melt the toffee consistency is back when they cool. I too think they were better the next day.

Rating: 4
These were amazing! I followed the suggestion and used chocolate chips instead of chopping the chocolate, which worked great. I used Skors bars and pecans instead of walnuts...just sounded better. I used waxed paper, which I buttered and I didn't have a problem with the cookies sticking. Everybody that tried these told me they were the best cookies they'd ever had.

These cookies were amazing. They were super rich, but not too sweet. We used pecans and Skor bars instead of Heath (same thing). Had a slight problem removing the cookies from the wax paper the second go-round so we ended up eating the cookies in chunks. We probably should have waited longer for them to cool, but they were still delicious.

this is a bear of a batter! but well worth the wait. like pervious post suggested, i let my batter sit over nite. 45 minutes was not long enough, and the over nite batter, for me, was the trick. also 15 minutes is a little too long.

These cookies are delicious and have universal appeal - the best of both brownies and cookies. I used semi- sweet chocolate and Muscovado sugar, and no walnuts because I didn't have any. The Muscovado with the toffee and rich chocolate was phenomenal, so if you can find it and don't mind the expense, substituting it for the regular brown sugar is a really easy way to fancy up these homey (decadent) cookies. I recommend keeping the toffee in biggish chunks, and not omitting some kind of nut. The cookies were excellent without them, but the added textural interest would have been welcome.

Rating: 3
These are not cookies, they're round candy bars! Very good, nonetheless. I used bittersweet chocolate, chilled overnight, baked on a silpat. Cookies came out very flat and almost too sweet, but had a good chocolate flavor. I will try them again and leave the toffee in larger chunks to see if that helps - my chunks were around 1/4" square and perhaps too small.

Ugg! Very frustrated with this recipe. After seeing 379 fantastic reviews (with the exception of maybe 20) I thought these were a sure win. Unfortunately, that was definitely not the case. I bake on a regular basis and just made a classic batch of choco chip cookies that turned out beautifully (so I know it wasn't the baking soda). My dough was initially a great texture. But the cookies deflated, no matter how long I cooked the cookies. Very frustrating and a waste of money and time! After 2 ruined batches, I'm sticking the rest of the batter in the fridge overnight.

OUTSTANDING. I used all bittersweet chocolate (ghirardelli), reduced the sugar by I think 1/4 cup, beat the eggs and sugar for 6 minutes, and chilled overnight. I think those last two are responsible for the incredible texture of these cookies - they are rich and soft like a brownie, but surprisingly light. I also used one more toffee bar than recommended, and I think I will use more next time (and there WILL be a next time). I didn't toast the walnuts this time, but I think I will next time, as the toasty flavor will compliment the chocolate very nicely. I made them a little smaller - maybe 2 tbsp each, ish? - so I ended up with 36, and baked each batch for 13 minutes. They were a BIG hit, and I will definitely be making them again!

A GREAT cookie recipe indeed! BUT ... I would omit the walnuts (they leave a weird aftertaste), do NOT use the toffee "bits" (not the same texture as the Heath bars), make CERTAIN you chill the dough, and lastly, if you're cookies are flat, CHECK THE DATE ON YOUR BAKING POWDER!!! These are good with macadamia nuts or you can omit the toffee bits and use crushed butterfingers or white chocolate chunks. The texture is amazing!!! I think next time I will try it with oats or coconut.

These were utterly delicious. I was concerned they might be too candylike and sweet, so following other reviewers' suggestions, I used four ounces unsweetened chocolate and 12 oz. Ghirardelli semi-sweet bits. Also, I found the 8-oz. package of Heath bits, which are desirably tiny and uniform. I used a small ice-cream scoop to form the cookies, and baked some on parchment paper and some on Silpat. The cookies still stuck somewhat, and I cook-sprayed the spatula to make them easier to remove. The cookies released a bit easier from the parchment paper.

These cookies don't really need another excellent review. They are FABULOUS. My best friend (a chocolate critic to say the least) said they were the best chocolate cookies EVER! I used toasted almonds instead of walnuts and the pound plus bittersweet chocolate bar from Trader Joe's. I found that the cookies stayed much fuller when baked on a silpat as opposed to the parchment. I refrigerated them for about 2 hours before baking at about 325 degrees and made them a bit smaller. MAKE THESE!!!

Took the reviewers advice from Akron...used 12 oz bittersweet choc and 4 oz unsweetned. I added 1-1/2 tsp. instant coffee granuales to the melted choc mix to enhance the chocolate flavor. Chilled the dough for a few hours and baked for 15 mins. PERFECT! I used a #40 mini ice cream scoop to spoon out the cookies. Pefect size. I got 52 cookies. Good thing, cause these went fast. They're like a brownie in cookie form. To quote another reviewer..."Chocolate Nirvana"! Definate keeper!

With all the rave reviews, I expected these cookies to be amazing, but I have to say I was a little disappointed. The cookies came out a bit flat and sweeter than I expected. Maybe I did something wrong... I think next time I'll try with half bittersweet chocolate and half unsweetened, and I'll cut the sugar a little too. The good news is that these cookies were very rich and chocolatey. They'd probably be amazing mashed up with vanilla ice cream.

I had to make these cookies just because they got so many fantastic reviews. I agree. These were so chocolatey-decadent! I read a lot of the reviews before making and took some of the suggestions. I used 12 oz. bittersweet chocolate and 4 oz. unsweetened. I beat the eggs and sugar for somewhere between 5 and 7 minutes. I melted the butter and chocolate in the microwave. I omitted the nuts, just as personal choice, and broke the toffee bars into larger chunks. I did refrigerate the dough overnight, and I think that really helped them turn out wonderfully. The dough was really hard from the overnight chill, so I shaped the cookies with my hands a bit (I got 20 cookies), baked them at 350 on parchment-lined sheets for exactly 15 minutes and they were perfect. Still soft in the middle -- delicious! Husband LOVED them, and he already wants to know when I will make them again even though they're not all gone yet!

I've reviewed these before, about a year ago, and I have to come back and say again THEY ARE GREAT!!!! I usually think cookies are an overly time-consuming dessert, but these are easy and the taste is so gourmet. Unbelievably good. Chocolate heaven. I do like to increase the amount of Heath bars.

I used frozen Heath "bites" with good results. I made the cookies smaller as the giant ones sounded too big for me. I think these cookies improve with age- they tasted better a day after baking.

I made these in the 1/4 cup size. They are a meal! But what a meal! Used the recipe exactly as printed. Next time will do as some of the others have suggested and use less nuts and more toffee.The chocolate you use is really the most important thing about the cookie. I used Giardelli and they are lovely.I am going to try some other fine chocolates and see how they affect the cookie.Thanks to all the reviewers for warning about the baking times. Mine took 15 minutes in a 325 convection oven.I kept a close eye on them. THey are worth the extra care.If you love CHOCOLATE they are the cookie for you!

Sinfully delicious! I love to cook, but I don't usually enjoy baking. These cookies are both easy and delicious! A definite keeper.

I too have been baking these cookies ever since they appeared on the cover of Bon Apetit. They are my family's most requested cookies. One experience I'd like to share is that this recipe doesn't double well. Somehow, when I tried to double the ingredients to get two batches of cookies, the proportions went wrong and the cookies fell flat. So I would say that stick closely to the recommended proportions. It is well worth the effort to bake two or more batches seperately if you are baking for a crowd. These cookies are sinfully delicious!

Rating: 4
I am not a nut person, so I omit the nuts and instead increase the Heath bars - usually use a whole bag of mini-Heath bars and cut them into quarters. You need to watch these cookies carefully, as in order to get the best result, they need to come out of the oven before they look quite done. They settle and firm up as they cool. Amazing cookies - a definite keeper!!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong but I didn't find anything special about these. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out very flat and the taste is okay but not spectacular. I will keep looking for a chocolate cookie recipe.

I'll admit that despite the 300-odd reviews, I scoffed when I saw this recipe. HALF a cup of flour for a cookie recipe calling for 4 eggs?? That definitely seemed like a typo. But I tried it anyway (substituting oats for toffee bits, incidentally). The texture is amazing: it's airy, slighty chewy and and melts in your mouth. But there's no lack of chocolate flavour. So I stand corrected - and all the other reviewers are right: this is outstanding!

Rating: 3
Im having a hard time understanding how anyone could give this recipe a bad review. While these may not be the best cookies EVER, they are pretty darn delicious! They have a great texture, and a rich chocolatey flavor that is complemented by the toffee pieces. I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone looking for an impressive cookie recipe.

Rating: 4
Outstanding recipe - a real crowd-pleaser. Be sure to chill the dough for a full 45 minutes, even longer if your mixing bowl is small & deep. Let the cookies cool fully on the baking sheet before removing. They are gooey/fragile, and will smoosh up if you try to remove them too soon. I used silpat sheets on my cookie sheets, with excellent results. As the other reviews noted, the quality of chocolate will make or break this recipe.

Rating: 4
I've made these since they appeared as the cover recipe several years ago in Bon Appetit. My friends have been paniced since I lost my issue a few months ago and have not been able to make them lately. Very glad to get this recipe again! My only tip is to resist the temptation to bake these longer than the recipe states. They are still good over baked but, excellent when baked as stated!

Rating: 4
These cookies are delicious! Best cookies I've ever made. I did increase the Heath chunks and decrease the nuts a little. Another suggestion I followed was 3/4 semisweet chocolate and 1/4 unsweetened (didn't have bittersweet and this combo worked well). Very rich taste and heavenly texture - err on the side of underdone if at all....once they start to over cook, you can't see it but it really changes the texture. And even when you mess up they're good!!

My favorite chocolate cookie recipe!

I tripled the recipe thinking that the cookie count was accurate - big mistake. I had a ton of dough. However, everone loved them and wanted the recipe! I chilled the excess dough and then froze it in logs for future use - actually would have been a good idea if it had been my plan. Now I have cookie dough whenever I need a quick something for book club or company.

I have been making these cookies for years and they are my husband's favorite. A tip for those of you having trouble making the toffee bars into chunks: use a hammer to break the chocolate bars into chunks while they are still in their wrappers. This method is quick and it will give you nice big chunks (don't over beat them!) and keeping them in the wrapper will prevent your kitchen from becoming a total mess.

Always a hit in my house! We like to make them a little smaller so we don't feel guilty eating them 2 at a time.

This recipe won me my office's annual cookie competition! For smaller cookies, I used a #40 cookie scoop and cooked them for 9-10 minutes. I cut Heath Bites into quarters, and used 2 (so 1/2 a Bite) per small cookie. For the regular (1/4 cup) size cookies, I found that cutting the Bites into halves and using 4 (so 2 Bites total) per cookie worked well. Definitely give the large cookies a second chill after portioning them (around 20 minutes, like others have suggested). The smaller cookies get dry if you put them back in the fridge for a second chill before baking, so just bake after portioning. For the first chill, just after making the batter, I like to let it refrigerate overnight.

Rating: 4
I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and substituted almonds and Heath Bar Bites. As I was mixing the batter I realized I was out of vanilla extract so I substituted almond extract. (A little too almond-y; next time I'll do half and half). I beat the eggs and sugar for 5 minutes on high and waited until chocolate was almost fully cool. The dough was VERY thick (but sticky). After refrigerating ~ 1 hour, I dropped by tablespoon and ended up with ~6 dozen 1-1/2 inch cookies. I baked for only 11 minutes. The results were very light (almost like a macaroon) but rich and chocolately. YUM!! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I have made these cookies several times over the past three yeasrs. EVERYONE loves them and requests them. As I've gotten older, I've gotten bored with the standard chocolate chip or sugar cookies. These are a nice addition to any baker's recipe box. A few tips - I use the mini size Heath bars that come in bags. I do not crush into teeny tiny pieces. Instead, I pound them into small chunks. Do not use the bits. These cookies will not turn out as good. I found that Skor bars didn't work as well either. Do NOT use chocolate chips. For the most part, the chocolate in chocolate chips is not high quality. Instead high quality baking bars. Much easier to measure than chips as well. Refrigerate the dough suffiently. Depending on where you live, 40 minutes may not be enough. Make sure the dough is sturdy when you remove from the fridge. I have never had runny cookies. Watch these cookies CAREFULLY. They burn easily, especially with the toffee and nuts. I made the mistake of walking away once to return to gross throwaways. Use silpats if you can. Personally, I suggest making the cookies smaller than what's recommended in the recipe. They are very rich, and the big cookie almost detracts from the overall flavor and look of the cookie. I've made these dozens of times, and haven't had any of the problems people have mentioned. These would be great for a holiday cookie exchange or bake sale, although I can never make them last more than a few days in my house.

this cookie takes practice but so worth it once you perfect it! use the Heath Bar Bites sold in the candy aisle and save yourself loads of time. i use two bags added at the end of the mixing and decrease some the nuts. also, make sure you add the entire 16 oz of choclate and chill the dough otherwise your cookies will be flat. if you tried it once and didn't have it work out, try it again because these are awesome.

Based on other reviews, I made these cookies verrrrry carefully: measured exactly and used 1 lb. Scharffenberger bittersweet chocolate, mixed the sugar and eggs for 7 minutes, used eggs at room temperature, chilled for 2 hours (dough was extremely stiff by this point), baked for 15 minutes exactly. Used a 2 T cookie scoop, gave up because of the stickyness and dropped about 2 T by hand on parchment. Cookies came out beautifully and looked like the photo. Very good warm, excellent cold. Will definitely make again!!

I have made these cookies for a couple of years and always get rave reviews. There have been many helpul tips in perfecting this cookie. I think a place one could make a wrong turn with this recipe is if they use chocolate chips. Remember, most chocolate chip bags weigh 12 oz. You need to add 4 more oz. to that to get to a pound of chocolate. Perhaps that is why some have complained of flat cookies??? Also, I have always used pecans because I prefer the flavor over the taste of walnuts.

These are absolutely one of the BEST cookies.

This cookie recipe is definitely worth making again if you tire easily of the ubiquitous chocolate-chip or sugar cookie variety. A recomendation: If you are a heath bar enthusiast, I think that you should cut down on the amount of walnuts included in the recipe, and up the amount of heath bars to one or two more. It is also important to use the best quality chocolate that you can afford because that will make these cookies taste even better. Semi-sweet chocolate makes these cookies taste incredibly sweet. I believe that bittersweet chocolate might cut down on the sweetness factor.

These turned out delicious and will definitely be made again. I made them smaller than the recipe calls for (I used rounded tablespoons of dough), which worked out well. I also used a mixture of Baker's semisweet, Ghiradelli unsweetened and Ghiradelli dark. The result was a very adult cookie - too chocolately and rich for my 6 year old's taste, but raved over by the adults. One word of warning: I used the Heath bits that come in a bag in the baking section of the supermarket and will not do that again. They simply are not big enough pieces to really get that toffee taste in the cookie. Definitely buy the Heath bars and break them into bigger chunks. Next time I try this recipe, I will use peanut butter chips instead of the toffee, just to try something different. I am betting it will be just as delicious!

This is a wonderful recipie, but I have found that it is essential to chill the dough thoroughly, and use the parchment paper lined baking sheets. A little tip for the Heath Bar Chopping. I freeze the package of Heath bars for at least several hours or overnight, and then while they are still in the package, crush with a hammer or meat tenderizer. Works great, not messy and the chunks are the perfect size.

I usually agree with the reviews on this site, but have to strongly disagree with the majority. These cookies were impossible! Mine did not spread and ended up in a big, lumpy, undercooked mess. I tried different aproaches with each batch, but nothing worked. I ended up tossing all the cookies because they were not fit to be served-even at a child's birthday party. This was a big waste of chocolate, toffee, and time.

Very intense cookies. I used Bakers chocolate, 3/4 semisweet and 1/4 unsweetened, and Trader Joe's toffee chopped in large chunks. They fell somewhere in between the reviews, not large and cakey, but not flat either. However, I used the baking soda test that another reviewer suggested (afterward, before baking some other cookies), and mine appeared not to be very active. What I did have happen to these cookies was that they slumped and melted randomly depending on where the toffee bits were. For this reason I might suggest using smaller toffee bits, but then you lose the effect of the big chunks. Tradeoff. I also was able to improve the problem by by flattening the cookies into circles before baking. The toffee bits still melted, but they cookies turned out much more evenly shaped and baked. I baked the cookies right on a metal sheet rubbed with vegetable oil, and I found that if I loosened them right after I took them out of the oven, they wouldn't stick, and I could also sort of push the spilled melted toffee back toward the cookie. I experimented, and discovered I liked the 1/4 cup size best cooked for only 12 minutes, but since they're so rich I preferred 1/8 cup sized cookies, baked for 10 minutes. Don't let them cook until they *look* done. They *will* burn on the bottom, and you won't know it until later. Also, I served these a few minutes out of the oven with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream and homemade caramel sauce. Yummy. I even got a "to die for" out of my mom, who usually avoids sweets. My dad liked the dough unbaked. With the high chocolate content, it's just like fudge (but with raw eggs, so of course I can't recommend it).

I haven't made this particular recipe, but have one very similar that I adore....only difference is the addition of chocolate chunks and dried cherries, which add another layer of flavor which really makes the cookies out of this world. Try it sometime!

These are yummy cookies. I couldn't find the heath bars...so I used the toffee bits...won't do that again. Couldn't taste the toffee. Making them again to use as ice cream sandwiches, so I substituted white choc chunks for the toffee. Yummy! (Used cookies and cream ice cream) Big hit! p.s. I've made these many many times and w/o thinking I greased my cookie sheet. They turned out as flat as pancakes, so those with flattening issues, make them on an ungreased sheet. Hope that helps.

Keep dough in fridge between batches and use only cool or additional sheets so you never place dough on a warm sheet.

I've made these cookies many times and they always turn out beautifully, that is, until yesterday. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of bars and had the same poor results that many others complained about below (runny batter, flat cookies, burned edges).

I've had some amazing cookies in my time but these take the, uh, cake. Like, if I ever realize my dream of opening up a bakery, I plan to put these babies out as freebies to entice customers to try my other goodies. One note though, I made them for Mother's Day because my mum loves chocolate-toffee combos and she was the only one who didn't rave. The reason being that she doesn't particularly like chewy-gooey articles and these cookies are nothing if not that. The rest of the (large) group couldn't say enough and I totally binged on the leftovers the next day.

Wow, I hate to be a downer but these cookies turned out awful -- all I could think was, What a waste of Heath bars! We made them for my birthday and had to end up making something else, as these were such a disappointment and ended up being fed to the squirrels outside. Followed the directions to a T. Batter/dough was extremely runny, even after beating for longer than 5 minutes (as some recommended) and refrigerating for several hours. Unsurprisiningly, the cookie turned out very flat and dry. Had to add some extra flour because it was so runny, so that might have contributed to the dryness. Even tried underbaking them to achieve the cookie as seen in the picture, but no luck. Everyone else seems to have had no problems, but I'm afraid that I will never touch this recipe again -- wasted a pound of good chocolate and all of my toffee bars! BLEAGH!

I've been wanting to try this decadent cookie ever since my friend mentioned it to me. So, I finally took the plunge, did exactly what the recipe stated and my cookies were very FLAT! However, it tasted delicious, chewy and fudgy. It definitely did not look like the picture, though. Maybe I didn't beat the sugar and eggs long enough...however it looked like it was getting thinner. Or maybe, I didn't let the chocolate cool enough. I'd really like to make it so it will turn out looking like the picture.

Wonderful cookies! Definitely a must for chocolate lovers. Can't understand why some reviewers had runny batter and flat cookies. My batter was thick, so much so that I had to knead it like dough to mix in the heath chunks and toasted, chopped walnuts. I mixed the sugar and eggs 7 vs. 5 minutes, so maybe that's why this was the case. In any event the cookies turned out BEAUTIFUL (just like the picture) and yummy. I didn't want them Giant size, so I used a small ice-cream scoop and that worked just fine, and it was easy too. A fantastic cookie that tastes more like a brownie than a cookie!

These cookies can satisfy any chocoholic. I couldn't find any Heath or Skor toffee bars so I opted for Skor toffee bits. Used 1c.

My bake time was 11 minutes in my convection oven.

These cookies were an absolute hit!! Yummm. Quite easy to make and very good for any chocolate lovers you know. I would definitely recommend leaving the Heath bars in big chunks, and if possible, adding more than the recipe asks you to. My cookies did not turn out flat (unlike some other reviews I heard). I'd recommend not overmixing the dry ingredients into the wet, chilling the mixture until firm, and using fresh baking powder (you can test baking powder by adding it to water; it should fizz to the top). I would definitely make these cookies again!!

If you only make ONE Christmas cookie this year, make these. They recieved rave reviews from everyone. Be sure to follow the directions exactly, and you will have no problems at all. I used almost an entire bag of mini Heath bars. Hit them with a hammer before you unwrap them. It makes it much easier. I left the toffee chunks somewhat large for a bigger kick. Also, take the advice of another reviewer and use the Ghiradelli chips instead of the bars. The bar is 2.49 for four ounces. The 11 oz bag of chips is 1.99. The ingredients, fat content, calories, etc. are exactly the same. I opened up the oven to bake something yesterday, and saw I had left one on a baking sheet from last week. I ate it! That's gross, isn't it?:-) They are THAT good.

These were a huge hit in the office. You'll get more than 18 cookies if you use an ice cream scoop, but they'll still be "giant". It definitely helps to have a kitchaid mixer to beat the eggs, and you can melt the chocolate in the microwave (2 min on high). I bet they'd be great as ice cream sandwiches!

I have to admit, I was skeptical about making these cookies based on the vast difference in opinions regarding the recipe and its results. However, I read all of the reviews and took the general consensus. I have to go with the majority here, these cookies are fabulous and I had absolutely no problems making them. I followed the reciped as stated making sure to mix the brown sugar eggs for the full 5 minutes, chilling the dough until firm (which was key because based on the consistency of the dough after mixing, which was like a brownie mix,I thought I had done something wrong), and then using the parchment paper and allowing them to cool before attempting to remove them. For the people who had trouble with this recipe, I must agree with prior comments, you probably did something wrong. For anyone having trouble finding bittersweet chocolate, Ghiradelli makes "double chocolate" chocolate chips, which if you read the ingredients, you will see they are made from bittersweet chocolate. So, for those of you who are skeptical, don't be, these are soft, fudgey, rich, great tasting cookies that are worth the effort and expense.

I am a cookie fanatic and have spent many summers working in bakeries. These cookies are great, divine, wonderful. Definitely use Heath Bars instead of the baking bits. These cookies also freeze well.

Rating: 4
Wow! Excellent, though not salty enough. I increased the salt to 1/2 tsp. I also thinned out the batter with about 1/8 c. hot water. They *will* stick to baking sheets -- I used DuPont Teflon baking liners on mine, and they came off fine. Silpat sheets also work well. If you use baking parchment, be sure to cool the cookies COMPELTELY before trying to remove them or they will most certainly stick.

Absolutely divine. It's a lot of work, but it's worth all the effort.

Excellent. I chilled the dough for a couple of hours, which makes the dough very firm. Then I used an ice cream scoop to form the dough balls.

I've made these cookies a couple of times, and there are a couple of small changes I've made that seem to really help. First of all, the Hershey's Bake Shop line makes a 7 oz. bag of chocolate-covered toffee bits that work really well. Maybe the most important change is to NOT chill the batter for 45 minutes. I did that once, and the cookies came out like flat, crispy disks -- okay if that's the cookie you're looking for, but if you want something more brownie-like, just chill the batter until slightly thickened, 5-10 minutes. Don't even bother using parchment or wax paper -- just lightly grease a baking sheet and drop the cookies onto that. It's a very rich cookie, but has been popular at gatherings I've brought it to.

Rating: 2
I bake a lot and this didn't turn out. I was concerned that there wasn't enough butter in them but figured with all the chocolate (and everyone elses luck) it'd be OK. Nope. They all stuck to the parchment paper. Either way, the batter's fantastic by itself.

After reading all the reviews I was a little hesitant to make these, but I did. If you are a confirmed, die-hard, chocolate fanatic, you will love these! Even if you're not, you will still enjoy them. I used Skor and I chopped them into pieces about the size of a penny. I also used parchment paper and I let the cookies cool on the paper (remove from pan) before I tried to remove them. The cookies did not fall apart nor did they stick to the paper. I had no trouble with making these. I will make them again!

Rating: 4
The cookies were fabulous!!!!! The first time I made them, I used Skor, and I really did not like them. The toffee melted too much and wasn't crunchy against the chewy cookie, and the Skor also made it way, way, way too sweet for my liking. The next time I used a toffee from IKEA, called Daim, I think. They are small, so I just cut them in half. The chocolate on them is also more chocolaty than Skor, which tastes like ultra-sweet cardboard. They stayed crunchy. Also use really good quality European chocolate. They were the best cookies I ever had! Very rich and chocolaty. YUMM!!

Rating: 2
Per the majority of comments, I had to try these. Mine turned out fine, by "everyone's" definition. However, it seemed to me they didn't know what they were: not quite a brownie, not a toffee cookie. Although my family ate them, they were too sweet for my tastes... I'll stick to my other favorites...

Rating: 4
This was, without a doubt, the best cookie I have ever made. If the directions are followed exactly, you can't go wrong. I chilled my dough for 2 hours and used top quality chocolate. I used Skor candy bars, but next time will break into pieces at least the size of a nickel or larger. They were delicious and everyone loved them!

Rating: 4
I had two types of chocolate in the house--nestles semisweet chips or scharffen berger bittersweet, so I decided what the heck and used my scharffen berger (small fortune). I wasn't disappointed. These were so good! I chilled the dough overnight, then baked on parchment and they were perfect.

Rating: 4
These were DE-licious! Chocolately and I the walnuts and Heath bar pieces were a tremendous combination. The cookies are really quite easy to make. For the couple of people who experienced "flat saucers", I am guessing they didn't beat the brown sugar and eggs long enough. Though in the directions it reads "about 5 minutes", it wasn't very descriptive on the consistency and texture. I think if you truly time the 5 min. you'll be ok. I also did not make 1/4 c. size cookies. Mine were more regular. And I added 2 T. extra flour since I'm at high altitude. EXCELLENT COOKIE RECIPE!

Rating: 3
I would almost make these in brownie form instead... yummy though (especially right from the oven).

Rating: 4
Wow. I made these cookies for my chocoholic husband. He told me, with conviction, that they were the very best cookies he had ever consumed. I agree. I skipped the nuts (I'm allergic), and I left the candy bar in fairly big chunks. These are truely amazing cookies.

Rating: 3
Made these for a picnic. Received raving reviews from kids and adults alike! Used semi-sweet chocolate and crushed Skor bars. They were rich and delicious. Next time I'll make them a little smaller.

Rating: 4
Although these cookies require more work than normal, they are totally worth the effort. I recommend refridgerating them overnight since the 1 time I didn't do that, the toffee didn't melt properly in the oven and they came out way too dry. I think that may be the problem some people are having. I also recommend using parchment, it keeps them from getting too crunchy more rich and fudgy (which I like). I'm allergic to dairy and have to use margerine which several of my friends deem as a poor excuse for butter. However, this recipe (using margerine) completely won them over since the cookies turn out so rich and chocolately and the toffee and nuts add so much, it doesn't matter. Best cookies ever!!!

Rating: 1
I have to agree with the cook from Columbus - I don't know how else has made such fabulous cookies - I followed the recipe verbatum and I came out with flat saucers for cookies (although my husband still ate them!)

Rating: 4
Loved these cookies! But I rearranged the instructions a bit (kind of by mistake, but it worked out): I took dry ingredients and put them in my KitchenAid mixer, then added the butter (softened) and whisked it all together with the brown sugar, vanilla, and eggs (for 5 minutes). Then I melted the chocolate and Heath pieces together in a big bowl over a double-boiler, then added that to the whisking mixture, and then added the walnuts. I didn't have to wait 45 minutes for the batter to refrigerate before baking the cookies... only waited about 10 minutes. Baked the cookies at 350 for 15-17 minutes and they're PERFECT. I will make these again tonight.

Rating: 3
You must try this recipe!! The cookies are sort of fudgy and crunchy at the same time, but must admit overwhelmingly rich. Instead of making giant cookies, I used a 1/4c scoop and results were great.

Rating: 4
I found this recipe in an older issue and couldn't wait to try it.... I am SO GLAD I did because these are WONDERFUL! I had a little trouble b/c I wasn't sure how many cups the chips & Toffee would be since I bought a pre-crushed bag of Heath bar Crumbs. I also made the mistake of using a mixture of semi sweet and milk chocolate chips but it was REALLY GOOD anyway... I did use a bit more flour than the recipe called for (mostly b/c I thought I used more chips than the recipe required.) I didn't use parchment or wax paper (just a lot of Pam spray) and the cookies came out fine- I brought these to my boyfriends workers and as a treat for my Dad and his staff who were working the night shift at the Emergency Room (my Mom heard about them and was jealous she missed out) Next time I'll take the sites suggestion & bring ice cappuccinos to keep them full and awake :)

Rating: 1
This did not go well at all. Honest, I meticulously followed the directions . . . and I refrigerated for several hours. Still, once in the oven, the cookies dissolved into one flat contiguous mess. That was the first two batched. Things improved only when I added lots more flour. I don't understand how everyone made this work with only one-half a cup.

Rating: 2
Made these for the 4th to accompany homemade ice cream. I did not think they were as spectacular as promised, especially considering the wealth of ingredients. I have an old standby for a similar chocolate/coffee cookie that is easier and outstanding. I had no trouble with them sticking on parchment, but they were difficult to measure out when chilled for 2 hours.

Rating: 4
I made some seriously wonderful stuff for my son to take to a houseparty at the lake over the 4th. These cookies were the only 'unknown' factor, as I'd never made them before. They got rave reviews from the college crowd! Followed recipe very closely, except that I took another reviewer's advice and added 6 Skor bars. Broke candy up by hand *before* unwrapping, chilled dough several hours, baked on silpat and allowed each batch to cool awhile before trying to pick up. No problems at all. Son (who is not that big on sweet stuff) called today begging me to FedEx another batch to him -- and telling me to be sure to enclose the recipe!

Rating: 3
I used the silpats and had no trouble with sticking. Freezing the Heath bars and whacking them a few times in the wrapper with a hammer provided nice sized chunks. I bought a 6 pound bag of chocolate at Costco and ate about a pound of it while making the cookies so I basically feel too sick to try them but they look good. My husband was chomping on them and smiling as he left for work. I chilled the dough for 2 hours.

A wonderful, chewy, hit of chocolate. There was a mad dash for these cookies at a barbecue I hosted last week. The best cookies I have ever made.

I have been making these cookies for about 2 years now and everyone raves about them. I have found that making them smaller is the key. Also, using "Heath Bites" instead of the Skor or Heath bars packs a bigger punch. Very Rich and very very yummy. If you are a chocoholic, make these!!!

Rating: 1
It must be me!!!!!!!!!! my co-workers devoured them within the morning shift. husband also did a number on the them.

Rating: 3
I didn't give this recipe four stars because I felt that they didn't need the Heath bars--they made the cookies too sweet. Even though I used silpat mats, you still have to make sure that the cookies are cool before you try to remove them--they will stick otherwise. Another tip is to make sure that the dough is very firm when you scoop them out on the cookie sheet. My cookies held their shape beautifully and looked just like the picture.

Absolutly loved this recipe, although tasting them fresh out of the oven I thought they were a bit too rich. But once they cooled they were wonderful, and they were even better the second and third days after I made them! Used Skor bars and a combination of semi-sweet and bitter-sweet chocolate b/c that was what I had on hand. Had no trouble with them sticking to the pan. My co-workers raved about this one!

Rating: 4
All I can say is OH MY GOSH!! These are wonderful cookies. Very rich and wonderful! I used the semisweet chocolate, left out the nuts, and made them a little smaller. Look forward to making them again with the bittersweet chocolate. Definitely a recipe I would recommend! My co-workers are going to love me!

One batch of these got very, very well-done after an unexpected important call made me forget them -- but they didn't burn! Just got a little harder than I would've preferred. I think I'll make this recipe again sans cocoa powder like others have said. Either way, it's an absolutely fantastic cookie.

I've made this recipe a couple dozen times and rate it as the best cookie recipe I have. They are great hot, are even better the 2nd day and can keep for several days, which makes them great for a make ahead dessert or for mailing. They have an addictive rich chocolate taste and a great chewy texture. The following tips may help if you tried them and they didn't turn out. Take heart, my first attempt was an unqualified mess. First, some chocolate chips melt completely (become liquid) with butter and some end up more like playdoh. Either will work for the recipe. However, if the chocolate melts completely then you will need to refrigerate the dough for several hours. Otherwise the cookies spread like pancakes. In general, I've found that thoroughly refrigerating the dough (at least 2 hours) brings about better results. I've used chopped toffee and toffee bits and, frankly, they both work. The chopped toffee makes a first class cookie but in a pinch (or if you're short on time) the bits will work too. Wax paper is a bad, bad idea. I've never had a good turn out with these cookies and wax paper. Parchment is terrific. However, if parchment isn't a part of your kitchen, you can simply grease the pan between batches and remove the cookies within a minute or two of taking them from the oven (otherwise they will stick and break apart). You do have to keep greasing the pan though or the cookies will be difficult to remove. My last tip is that I highly recommend using unsalted butter (as indicated in the recipe). Otherwise the cookies will cross the line to being too salty to taste good. I hope these suggestions help. These cookies are really too good to miss!!

This recipe is not worth the cost of the ingredients. I would rather have eaten the candy bars. When cooked, they disappear into the cookie and cannot be tasted.

These are super delicious! Because they're so thick and rich, they're perfect cookies to mail. In fact, they're so good, i'm making them for my, mom for Mother's Day. Also, use the bittersweet chocolate. And I used pecans instead of walnuts. the butteryness of the pecans is perfect with toffee.

Oh my goodness!! These cookies are the most delightful cookies I have ever had. Every single time I make them for a dessert I gave mass raves and I don't hear about them till I make them again. This is the ALL TIME BEST cookie recipe I have ever encountered!! They are wonderful and there is just no way I could ever not make them again!

Smashing. The dough is very fudgy, and if you leave it in the fridge too long it'll be just about solid. But they bake up nicely.

These cookies were absolutely delicious and a big hit. I used Toll House semi-sweet chocolate chips since I had them on hand and they worked great. I bought Heath toffee bars already chopped; next time I will use fresh Heath or Skor bars and chop them myself. I always use a baking stone so the parchment wasn't necessary. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
These are the best cookies I've ever eaten! I've made them several times and absolutely love them. Once I did use Toffee bites or those packaged Toffee pieces, and they definitely don't work--they melt away and disappear. Like others advise, chop the Skor bars coarsely so you have big chunks. Also, bittersweet chocolate really makes them more chocolatey and rich than semisweet. You'll think you've died and gone to heaven, they're that good!

Rating: 4
Oh my gosh yummy! For those of you who didn't or couldn't find Heath bars I used Skor bars...my personal favorite. Instead of chopping them leave them in the wrappers and just moderately bang them with a hammer or rolling pin. It works! These are definate do overs.

Rating: 1
I know this recipe deserves a 4, but I haven't arrived yet. I followed it closely with one exception: I couldn't find Heath Bars, so I substituted Heath Almond Toffee Bits, and they must have melted into the batter to make it thinner, and the cookies sprawled all over the pan. Ho Hum -- Hope to try again with Heath Bars.

Rating: 4
These cookies were oh so gooey and chewey. Very yummy. I used the pre-cut Health bar instead of buying actual bars and cutting them and it was good. May have been better with bigger chunks and the chocolate coating but not sure. They were a hit! Kind of time consuming to put together and bake though...

I love this recipe, it's YUMMY!!!!! When I make Them, instead of using the Toffee Bars I use Symphony Chocolate Bars. They are chocolate bars with Almonds and toffee in it. This leaves the cookies with big chunks of milk chocolate and Toffee. They are devoured at my home. I will definately make them again!!!!!

I can't count the number of times I've made this recipe! I follow the recipe exactly (except I sometimes make them smaller so they go further). They are always devoured ravenously and I am always asked for the recipe. A great recipe to take to a gathering.. they stand out above all the rest.

One of these cookies can be considered a complete dessert. We took them to the lake, and they were a totally, no-fuss end of the meal. The batter is so dense that it is important to make sure the bottom portion of the batter is well mixed. I think that you'll love 'em!

Rating: 2
Sorry to say I was disappointed. Maybe because I used toffee pieces (Skor) rather than broken up Heath Bars. I would not recommend this as the toffee pieces are too small and tend to taste grainy/sandy in these cookies. I would also leave out the nuts and increase the toffee--maybe 2X!. (My friend tasted them and said they taste almost identical to a recipe from the Cook's Bible, which relies on cocoa powder--more convenient and cheaper)

Rating: 4
Excellent! Just like Mrs. Fields, if she made such a thing. Unfortunately, for a pound of chocolate, the 5 candy bars and the nuts, you're almost paying as much as for Mrs. Fields.

These cookies were *devoured* by my family and coworkers. Followed the recipe using parchment and breaking up the heath bars into large chunks. I actually had to hide cookies to bring into work because my family kept sneaking them. Personally, I could eat them every day. They really are delicious.

these are great. very soft and heavy with chocolate and giant they are! i skipped the toffee.

They sounded great but weren't. Not that they tasted bad but rather they simply did not meet my expectations. If you do make them, make sure they are at room temperature before you attempt to lift them off the baking pan -- if you try when they are warm, they will be difficult to lift and they crumble. When they are room temperature, they lift off easily.

Amazing?? Fabulous?? Cookies from heaven??? These tasted fine, but were not the knock-out I expected after reading these swooning reviews! I actually thought they were sort of plain after baking the first sheetful, so I added some chocolate chips for a double-chocolate cookie to make them a little more interesting.

Holy moly these are good! I didn't have a full lb of semisweet, so I used 12 oz semisweet & 4 oz unsweetened, with great results.

These were pretty good cookies, but I didn't swoon over them the way many reviewers did. They were SO sweet that I ate around the toffee parts just so it wouldn't be as cloying. I didn't make them giant-sized-- just used an ice-cream scooper, and baked them for 10 minutes. I made the batter a few days ago, and kept it in the freezer. That way I can make a fresh batch per night. Baked on my Silpat baking mat (Williams-Sonoma, or Martha By Mail) and had no trouble whatsoever with sticking.

Took these to a picnic last summer and no one believed I made them from scratch - they were that good!

I gave some of these cookies to my college age cousin. She and her roommate said they would be the food of choice if stuck on a desert island. You must be a chocolate lover, and be sure to chill the dough completely. I have made these over and over. My 9 year old begs for them (but without nuts of course.) And hey, dark chocolate is full of anti-oxidants! So I think they are good for the soul and body.

I tried this recipe a number of times (with very poor results) as cookies. However, when I added extra flour (one cup versus the amount called for)and made them as brownies, they turned out truly fantastic! The other things I do are to add chocolate chips to either the bottom of the pan before I put the mix in or to the top of the pan after I put the mix in and then, immediately after it comes out of the oven, I put frosting on them. This is truly for chocolate lovers. They are so rich, they almost taste like fudge.

I brought this to a christmas party and it was such a hit! I only used bittersweet chocolate and with parchment they slipped right off the pan. The batter did get rock hard after chilling but I dipped a small ice cream scoop in hot water to dole out the cookies and kept the batter in the fridge between batches. LOVED this cookie!!!

To those who had trouble with these cookies sticking to the pan, I would suggest investing in a reuseable Silpat baking mat. They're available at Williams-Sonoma, or by mail order on Martha Stewart's website. I've never had any problems with sticking when using the Silpat mat. Try it.

I've never seen a recipe so reviewed so passionately, with so many opposing views. Naturally, I had to weigh in myself. This is an excellent chocolate cookie, just short of a brownie, that went fabulously with the homemade chestnut ice cream I served for dessert. I wish I had read all of the reviews, however. The toffee definitely needs to be chopped in large generous chunks, otherwise they melt into the background. I had no problems with the texture or with the cookies sticking to the pan. I will definitely make these again.

These are the best chocolate cookies I have ever eaten. They were the hit of the party, and everyone wanted the recipe. It is important to chill the dough, otherwise the cookies will spread too much during baking, and will turn out flat. I kept the dough in the fridge between batches. I also buttered the parchment paper - and so I had no trouble with the cookies sticking to the pan.

You have got to be kidding!!!! These cookies are not even cookies!!! I followed the recipe to a T and they were flat hard and even though I sprayed the pan with pam they would not come off. They were too expensive to even try again. Very dissapointed. The only person who could not have a problem with these cookies is Martha Stewert!!!

I initially made these as a Christmas treat for my co-workers, using a heaping tablespoon of batter per cookie and baking for 8-10 minutes. While they were a considerable hit, and disappeared with astonishing rapidity, I found the sweetness almost overwhelming, even in small doses. I tried them a second time, using 4 oz of unsweetened chocolate and 12 oz Callebaut semi-sweet chocolate, which I thought a considerable improvement. As for the toffee bars, a hammer seems the best implement for breaking them into generous sized chunks that don't disappear into the background chocolate

Rating: 4
This is one of the most decadent, sinful cookies I've ever eaten! They're definitely a keeper. Like others, I made them much smaller (and froze half of the batter for later) as they are quite rich. A chocoholic's dream. FYI, the brown sugar equals the amount in one (Domino's) box. Also, don't let the chocolate mixture cool too much or it will solidify when you try to mix it into the rest of the batter.

I even forgot to chill them and had no problem. I made small ones and am glad because they are very rich. Make sure you don't chop the Heath bars too small.

I really loved these cookies. They were like a cross between a gourmet brownie and a cookie. The secret to well shaped cookies (ones that don't fall flat) is to chill the batter as directed and then chill AGAIN after you scoop onto the baking sheet - about another 20 minutes. YUM!

Rating: 4
These came out GREAT! Wonderful with a great big glass of milk. Followed the instructions except I chilled for about 2 hours and made the cookies smaller. (So that I could get more of them) Looking forward to making them for the holidays. (My cookies lasted fine for 4 days - I kept them in an airtight container.)

I made these for friends and they were a huge hit! After making them twice,I found that using ghiradelli chocolate chips made a big difference in taste. Also, undercooking slightly added a wonderful chewiness.

These cookies were splendidly gooey and decadent. My only problem, however, was with their short shelf life. After just two days, the cookies were dry and had lost much of their taste. Otherwise, though, they were a hit!

Terrific cookies! Make sure the oven is the right temperature, if it's not, they'll leak out and you'll end up with flat doodles.

I've made these cookies twice and each person that I've served them to requested seconds! I had excellent results, and I didn't even use wax paper. I also found that these MUST NOT be overcooked. Great!

My family loved these and so did everyone else at the picnic we brought them to. I would agree that the Heath bars are best left in big pieces because the smaller pieces melted away. Also, don't overcook these. I would suggest doing a cook test of three or four cookies to know how long your oven will need. It may seem a bit time consuming but worth it as I overcooked my first batch and was not impressed with the result but decided to make the rest and was so happy I did.

Made these for my team members at the office. They went over extremely well. They are very chocolatey so I made them smaller so I cooked them just a bit under the time the recipe suggested. I got about 24 cookies out of the recipe. They were chewy and not flat at all.

The cookies were okay. The first batch I destroyed (made them smaller and baked for 15 minutes, hard as rocks). The second batch, I baked for 10 minutes, better, but I just did not like the walnuts in this cookie, plus it was too much chocolate. But I loved the idea of Toffee in cookies!!!!

I have made these cookies a number of times since it was printed in the March 2000 issue. Each time I make them they are a huge hit and I have been told by a number of people that these are the best cookies they have ever had. I had no problems at all with the recipe, though I will say that I think the dough needs to be cold to work with it. I use a small ice cream scoop to make the cookies and that has worked beautifully.

Rating: 4
These cookies are to die for! I made them back in March when the magazine first printed the recipe, but just now got around to checking out the reviews. I am shocked to find that people either LOVED them or HATED them. To those who thought they were a mess and difficult to make I say, "you must have done something wrong." And to those who thought they were expensive to make I say, "only the finest ingredients make the finest product."

Rating: 3
The only thing I'd change about this recipe is the "Giant" part. The cookies are so rich and delicious, they're more like candy. A little goes a long way. Next time I make them, I'll use a tablespoon or two of batter rather than 1/4 cup.

I was very skeptical about making this recipe but there were so many positive reviews that I had to give it a try. I was not impressed. I followed the recipe to a T.

Excellent recipe. I made 4 doz. and they were gone in a flash. I like to use bittersweet choc. instead of semisweet. They're the tastiest cookies I've ever baked.

I must admit I was skeptical about these cookies based on all the previous reviews. Happy to report they were as great as everyone said. My husband took them to a business meeting and said everyone raved. Thanks to all the previous reviews, I knew to make the following changes (all of which helped): no wax paper, substitute 4oz unsweetened chocolate for semi-sweet, refridgerate dough longer, make smaller cookies (I got 60), use large chunks of Heath bar.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe 5 times and have gotten rave reviews each time. Tips are to use 1 cup flour and substitute 4 oz of unsweetened chocolate for that amount of bittersweet. Cookies will be puffy and not as sweet. For one batch that I brought to a picnic I added 3/4 tsp of cayenne pepper. Besides giving some zip to the chocolate-sweetness, it definitely increased the consumption of the home brewed stout!

Rating: 3
THESE COOKIES WERE CHEWY INSIDE, FLAKY-CRISP ON THE OUTSIDE. THE LARGE COOKIES TURNED OUT BETTER THAN SMALLER ONES. i CUT MY HEATH BARS IN MEDIUM CHUNKS, NEXT TIME I WOULD CUT THEM INTO LARGE CHUNKS TO ADD MORE TEXTURE TO THE COOKIES SINCE THERE AREN'T ANY SOLID CHOCOLATE CHIPS, ONLY NUTS. DOUGH WAS DELICIOUS, TOO! EAT THEM SOON BECAUSE THEY BECOME ROCK HARD AFTER 2 DAYS! iRRESISTABLE IF YOU LIKE CHOCOLATE!

Rating: 3
If you love rich, chocolatey cookies, you will love these. I melted semi-sweet chocolate chips in the microwave and they turned out fine. You may find it easier to buy the "Skor pieces" already packaged in the baking section at the grocery store instead of chopping up all of the candy bars. My cookies turned out a little flat, but I think I could have chilled them a little longer--perhaps a quarter cup more flour? The taste was sensational and the tecture divine. Do NOT use wax paper. If you don't like fudgy brownies, you will NOT like these, though.

Rating: 3
I baked these cookies last night, and they turned out perfect. Any chocolate lover would agree that this recipe is to keep. I think that the chocolate cookie dough is superb, and could be made with peanut butter chips, white chocolate, etc. Make sure that the dough has enough time in the fridge...I let mine sit there overnight and I baked them the next day...I think this contributes to thier success.

Rating: 2
This recipe sounded so good....I just had to try it. In my opinion, they were very sweet and the chocolate flavor seemed to be muted by the sugar. I can certainly understand why milk is an excellent accompaniment...it tempers the sweetness. There are far better chocolate cookie recipes out there. I would not make this again.

Rating: 0
This cookies are *great*...and I am a cookie fanatic. I've already made them 3 times! Two suggestions: 1) freeze the cookie dough (don't refrigerate) and they'll hold their shape *a lot* better; 2) use Heath bars and not SKOR bars.

Rating: 1
I love chocolate and toffee so I thought these would be the perfect cookies. Was I ever wrong! They were sickeningly sweet (all that brown sugar!)and only faintly chocolatey. Also, given the ingredients, they are expensive to make. Definitely not worth the investment or the time or the calories. I sent the leftovers to my husband's office and they came back unfinished. Even my kids wouldn't eat them.

Fabulous cookies...I probably wouldn't have got around to making them without all the raves on this site, but I'm so glad I did. Very much like a brownie, and they're not kidding about it being great with a glass of milk.

Rating: 4
What a terrific cookie! You must love chocolate to enjoy them and I think they are very much an "adult cookie". As other cookies suggested, I used 1/2 bittersweet and 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate. Chilling is essential to a puffy cookie. I chilled the dough for 45 minutes and then shaped cookies on the lined cookie sheet. I put them back in the refrigerator and chilled them for another 30 minutes. Perfect results.

Rating: 1
There has to be a mistake in this recipe. Just 1/2 cup of flour? I really would like the real recipe because there is no way you can use just 1/2 cup flour and 4 large eggs and have it turn out like in the picture. I hated the recipe the way it was.

Rating: 4
Wow! These were great cookies but so large! I will reduce the quantity of dough used for each cookie next time. For other cooks out there who hate using a double boiler, you can melt the chocolate (I used Ghiradelli semi sweet morsels) and butter in the microwave (60 seconds on high, stir then 30 more seconds), stir it well after melting and let it cool to lukewarm while making the rest of the dough- no problem! I saw these cookies on the cover of the magazine and mine turned out just like them. WONDERFUL!

Wow...what a great cookie! Definitely brownie like(the batter is to die for). Mine came out nice and thick. I didn't have a problem with them flattening out. Make sure you refigerate them for the suggested time, or more, and they'll come out beautifully. I used half bittersweet and half semi-sweet Ghiradelli chocolate, as recommended by a previous reviewer, and Skor bars (couldn't find Heath bars). Parchment paper worked great...no smoking issues. I ended up with 21 big cookies and baked them for the 15 minutes. Delicious and picture perfect! I will definitely make these again and again.

One of the best cookie recipes ever. Gives you more of that wonderful crunch of the top of a brownie plus melt-in-your-mouth innards. For one pound of the bittersweet chocolate, I substituted 10 oz. of bittersweet and 6 oz. of unsweetened. I prefer the more intense, less sweet chocolate flavor. Also, I used the microwave (3 min. on high) to melt the chocolate and [margarine, which I used instead of butter]. Idea: for ultra grandiosity for Mom on her birthday, use broken-up See's English toffee pieces.

These were wonderful. Try not to serve them hot out of the oven -- they are even better after they have cooled a few hours and the toffee chips are no longer melted.

Everybody raved about these cookies! My only advice - do not overcook. My only changes to the recipe? I made them small because they are so rich. Also, the 1st time I made these cookies I used half of the dough and froze the rest. The frozen dough turned out much better cookies.

I saw this recipe when it was on the cover and was anxious to make it. I LOOKED delicious. I was very dissapointed. Mine were flat like pancakes too. They looked nothing like the picture. The taste was ok, but not great. Maybe if they had stayed thicker they would have tasted better.

After reading the reviews, I made this recipe with double the flour, belgium chocolate and Hershey toffee pieces. The dough was refrigerated for a hour and we made them small, I got about 50 out of this recipe. They are pretty tasty, though rich. My two daughters had a good time making and eating them and would make them again.

These were not worth the effort. They came out totally flat like pancakes. I used egg beaters, maybe that was the problem. I was so dissapointed, I didn't even bake the second batch, the batter it still in the fridge. Maybe they will come out better tonight, as another reviewer suggested.

Rave reviews from all my guest!! Although some said they would need more to make a definite determination. I downloaded recipe for 4 people in my office this am.

This recipe was not nearly as great as I expected, judging from previous reviews. I used good quality chocolate (Ghiradelli), but I used Wax instead of Parchment Paper (mistake!!), and Skor instead of Heath bars (they were all I could find). For the amount of time and effort it took to make these, it was definitely not worth it.

This has to be the best chocolate cookie recipe ever! People I have made them for become desperate for more. I have made them using several variations and have had a disaster, so followinf the recipe to the letter is essential. Wax paper isn't very good, do use the parchment. I had no problem with the cookies smoking but then I always use those thick cookie sheets (with the air trapped inside), also I only use nestle or ghiradelli chocolate. I tried substituting egg beaters for the eggs, - what a disaster! I found Heath bars (made by Hersheys) tasted a bit better than the other sort - 'Skor' I think the name was. Anyway, this is the best.

Rating: 4
These cookies have become a family favorite. Absolutely scrumptious! They are, however, quite rich so I make them a bit smaller than recommended. I substituted Hershey toffee pieces for the Heath bar and find it works very well. I've noticed in reading other reviews that many people have had difficulty in preparing this recipe. All I can say is, use the best quality chocolate you can find (I used Ghiradelli bittersweet) and follow the directions i.e., beat the sugar for 5 minutes until thick, refrigerate the batter for 45 minutes before baking, use parchment paper, and cook for the designated amount of time. This is not one of those recipes you can "fudge" on. Follow the directions and you're sure to have satisfying results.

When I made these cookies for an engagement party, I accidently used 1 1/2 cups of flour instead of 1/2 cup of flour. They were the talk of the party & no one realized my mistake. I tried it again with 3/4 cup of flour & thought that they were a little too sugary for my taste. I think the magic amount of flour for me will be about 1 1/4 cups. I also had a problem with the silpat liner/heath bar smoking & setting off my fire alarm! And in an effort to hide a few from my husband, I froze a couple & they even tasted good frozen & thawed out!

Tastes very much like a brownie. I was highly disappointed.

A great cookie. It's best to use parchment paper and if you have one, an ice cream scoop of the approximate size. It makes portioning a breeze. Also, if you chill the dough after scooping on the cookie sheets, they won't flatten as much. I also used english toffee bits from the baking section of the supermarket instead of the Heath bars. they're just as good.

These cookies were delicious! Everyone raved about them. I know that I made some mistakes when I baked them, never having made them before I really didn't have a good feel for how they should look when done and I actually undercooked them a bit, but no one really complained. They are the true chocolate lovers dream and I would make them again. I had no trouble with the wax paper. In response to some of the comments on the chocolate, I have to agree that there are many variations in chocolate, I never use "cheapie" brands of chocolate, I stick with Nestle's or Giradelli's because of taste and consistency. A tip for those of you, like myself, who hate the double boiler method, try melting the butter in the microwave and then adding the chocolate to the hot butter. It works like a dream.

To the cook from Laguna Niguel, CA. Perhaps you didn't scorch your chocolate. Its important in a recipe with such a huge amount to use a brand that tastes good. Chocolates vary enormously in flavour. The Baker's Catalog has a good selection & describes the flavours accurately. You can 'toughen' chocolate & spoil its flavour & texture by accidentally splashing water (even a tiny amount will do it) into the chocolate mixture as you melt it over the double-boiler.

Great cookies! Everyone loved them. One word of warning, DO NOT follow the recipe's suggestion to use wax paper to line the cookie sheet!

Sorry kids, but this one did not ring my chimes. For my taste, there wasn't enough chocolate oomph. That's because it was all semi-sweet. Also the toffee pieces became more chewy, than crunchy on the following day. Good concept cookie, but it just didn't work for me. Since trying this recipe, I've unearthed similiar ones, that use unsweetened chocolate, and that's where I think I'm headed. Happy cooking!

Definitely a keeper. Made them b/c my husband saw the cover and thought they looked good. Had people over for dinner and they wanted to take a doggie bag home!!!. I use miniature heath bars--that's all they have in the grocery store and use proportions exactly in the recipe. Like a brownie--only a cookie. Everyone gives them four forks!!!!

This recipe was a great hit with my co-workers. I expected the cookie to be overwhelmingly rich, but it was not! It was just right. Great with coffee.

Really simple to make, rich, and just perfect for the chocoholics I know. I used Hershey's Skor bars, too. They must be the same thing because they are described the same way and come in just the right size. I did not use the "giant cookie" method, but used a tablespoon of batter for more regular sized cookies and got about 6 dozen.

Haven't made these cookies yet but wanted to let those of you who couldn't find Heath Bars know that Hershey's "Skor" bars would work just as well.

These were delicious!! Such beautiful cookies! I only had milk chocolate chips at home, so I substituted a bag for the chocolate. I did have to add an extra 1 1/2 cups of flour and one more teaspoon of baking powder. They were so good!!

Perfect for chocolate lovers. I had to substitute chocolate chips for the chocolate and synphony bars for heath bars and I added a cup of chocolate chips to the batter.

Excellent cookie, especially if you are a chocolate lover. We first tried the recipe at cooking school at Tante Marie's in San Francisco. I substituted pecans for the walnuts and used half bittersweet and half semi-sweet chocolate. Very good the next day and the day after that. Suggest you double the recipe

Made these this weekend -- an excellent cookie! I had a hard time finding Heath bars though; had to substitute Hershey's mini-toffee-chocolate bars

Amazing- only wish it made more cookies! I left out the nuts and the cookies were still great.

For weeks I have been trying to get a co-worker to visit the Epicurious website, and when I brought these cookies to an office lunch, she was finally compelled to take a look! I did not use a double boiler to melt the chocolate and the butter; instead I melted them in the microwave on high for about 2 1/2 minutes, checking every 45 seconds or so to stir and to make sure the mixture did not burn. When most of the chocolate and butter had melted, I removed the bowl from the microwave and stirred the mixture until smooth. I am a huge fan of cookie dough and am often disappointed when the dough becomes a cookie, but that was not the case with these cookies. The dough was so delectable, almost like fudge, that I was certain the cookies could not possibly measure up to the taste, but, much to my surprise and delight, they did. The batter yielded 22 cookies and that was even after I'd consumed a considerable amount of the chilled dough! Several people asked for the recipe and there was not a single cookie left to take home with me!

These cookies are one of the few that actually taste better the next day. For even more decadence I added an extra chocolate bar and substituted pecans for the walnuts. These are our new favorite cookies.

You can make these things even better by adding 3/4 cup choc. chips....only for the choc-o-holics of course. For some reason became BRITTLE....any one know what I did wrong?? I think it's my (*&@(#$^ gas oven and the cookies were over-baked. So what I did was, I crumbled the cookies in vanilla ice cream and re-froze it....to DIE for.

These really are the best they rival any cookies selling in posh NYC bake shops. Here are some additional tips that I found: do a combination of bittersweet and semi-sweet chocolate, use toasted pecans instead of walnuts, press the cookie batter down before baking and again when they come out of the oven and do not be afraid to make smaller cookies so that there are more to savor. These are THE BEST !!!!

These cookies came out picture perfect. I didnt use any waxed paper just a good old nonstick cookie sheet. I omitted the walnuts and added pecans instead. These are the chewiest richest chocolate cookies I have ever had and are stupendous with a glass of milk. I will definitly make them again!

WOW WOW WOW!! These cookies are far and away the best chocolate cookies I have ever tasted. I know that sounds melodramatic, but it's true...they are absolutely delicious. An added bonus is how beautiful they turned out. I think they'd be great as a gift for someone, nicely wrapped in a pastry box. The recipe isn't hard, but I didn't think it was "easy" as some have mentioned, simply because I thought it took a bit of time to make. But that's probably because I don't have a big enough oven to make a big batch at a time. These cookies are divine,thank you, Bon Apetit!!

These cookies are awesome.I made them the very day my issue arrived, because the photo on the cover commanded me to. I omitted the walnuts. They were very easy to make and cam our beautifully. My husband and I each ate a warm one, and we were groaning at how good they were. I was surprised to find that the toffee had completely melted. Then I had a room-temp one the next day with a cup of coffee and it was even better! And I found that when they cool, the toffee rehardens, but not in clumps. So they are crisp and gooey at the same time. If you like rich, chocolatey cookies, these are the cookies for you.

This is my new favorite cookie recipe. I am always on the hunt for the ultimte chocolate cookie and this may "take the cake." My only problem was trying to stop eating the dough!

These were fantastic!! I made a lot more than 18 and I let the batter sit in the refrigerator for almost 2 hours and they turned out great. Will make these again since they were so easy and delicious. Next time I will add more toffee.

THESE COOKIES ARE THE BOMB! Definitely, need a tall glass of milk to go with one. These are now my husband's favorite cookies.

My mother made these cookies for me when I was home recently. They were fabulous. She doubled the amount of walnuts which didn't seem like too many. I think you could also double the toffee.

I saw this recipe and had to make them immediately. Everyone that had one gushed and raved and asked for the recipe. One thing, when I made these, I ended up with a yield of almost 36 cookies, at 3 inches across! Much more then the 18 given in the recipe.

Wonderful. My husband says it will replace chocolate chip cookies in our house.
