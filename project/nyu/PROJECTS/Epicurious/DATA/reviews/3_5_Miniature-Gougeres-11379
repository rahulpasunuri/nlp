Made this with Irish cheddar flavored with porter instead of gruyere for a St. Patrick's day potluck. Omitted the dill seeds, sprinkled with fresh ground black pepper, and used 3 jumbo eggs. They turned out great. Golden, puffy, totally held their form. I was worried that the brown color from the porter in the cheese would make them ugly, but they just became a deep golden brown color. Really lovely and they came together so fast!

For the Cook from Boston, gougeres are traditionally made in a ring form that sounds quite similar to what you were served. In order to make a gougere in that form, pipe large puffs next to each other so that you form a ring. The twisting may appear from either the texture of the puffs, or by alternating the pattern of them. The gougere ring is done when the tops are slightly browned and a straw or toothpick comes out clean. Also, I have found that mine become much puffier if I cook them at 400 F.

Loved the ease of this recipe - my other gougeres recipe requires way too much beating. I used the fresh parmesan on top (and gruyere inside), but not the dill. Next time will try fresh dill. Also, 1 Tbsp. is too much - they don't rise as well. Use less.

so delicious and elegant, and absolutely easy to make. did not include the dill.

A tip about pastry bags - if you don't have one, load the dough up in a freezer ziploc and cut off the corner. In the UK, I had a gougere loaf, where the chef just twisted the dough and sat it on a baking sheet. Anyone have any experience cooking that form?

These were delicious! I didn't use dill seeds, just made them with the gruyere. They froze beautifully. A big hit!

I loved the versatility of this recipe. I used thyme and gruyere. My guests loved them. I will definitely need to make a double batch next time. I'm also looking forward to trying some of the variations that were suggested.

Darobb, There are a couple reasons I can think of that they may have not puffed: Usually, you need to cut a little slit in the side of the puff right at the end of the baking. Return them to the oven after slitting. It allows the moisture to escape. Also, if you are up in the mountains you might try reducing the liquid a little. Doing that allows the puff to maintain its shape a little easier.

My only complaint is that the puffs didn't really puff. Any suggestions as to what I did wrong? I had hoped for a texture more like cream puffs/profiteroles.

Simple and everyone loved them at our New Year's Party. Used sharp cheddar and sprinkled coarse black pepper on top. Didn't have a mixer but my husband did a very nice job mixing them by hand.

Great standard recipe and fairly fool proof. I used gruyere, but would probably up the amount to 2 cups next time and add some fresh thyme. Am also planning on making these with cheddar and chives and another batch with parmesan and rosemary. My guests loved them, but oddly enough, they all seemed to expect hot cheese in center -- go figure!

--A tried and true winner. Swiss cheese works just fine. They freeze exceptionally well. As others have mentioned, this is very versitile, but I only add additional dill to this delicious tidbit.

These turned out great. I made them w/o seeds and that was fine. I used a little cookie dough scoop to portion. I made this twice and each time one tray puffed up beautifully, and the other only puffed OK. In the future, I will only bake 1 tray at a time.

I haven't made this recipe yet but would like to know if margarine can be substituted for someone who has a lactose intolerance.

Fairly easy and very tasty. I used cheddar, black pepper, rosemary, and parmesan. Used a spoon, not a pastry bag, and they look great. Turned out even though I had to stop right after cooking the batter on the stove and before adding eggs to run to the store to get more eggs; just zapped the batter in the microwave to heat it up and proceeded.

Very yummy and very easy! Works well with cheddar and you can make endless combinations such as by adding cumin or black pepper on top. But by opening the oven half-way to switch the baking sheets around, the gougeres collapse! So I am stuck baking one sheet at a time. Any suggestions?

I left off the dill but they were still a big hit at the luncheon. Used Jarlesberg with Parmesan on top. Next time I'll use the previous advice and divide the recipe in two and make half of them sweet.

We make the pate a chou, and put gruyere in half for the gougere, and bake the other half plain for profiteroles for dessert. Yum!

Thanks to the cook from Ennui, MD on the freezing tip - made these in the shape of a ring (9" - double stack the puffs) over the holidays - used fresh marjoram (very fragrant - about 2T) and 1&1/2 cups Leerdamer cheese - stacked some thinly sliced Blackforest ham in the center and served with a honey mustard - huge hit on the buffet. Cut the gougere into wedges and then in half - guests could make their own mini 'hamwiches'.

These are incredibly easy and there's so much you can do to vary it - different cheeses, different herbs. And since they're made with such basic ingredients they can be whipped up anytime. And I wouldn't bother with a pastry bag - one of my guests thought I'd used one and I hadn't!

Wonderful, easy recipe. I used sharp cheddar instead of Gruyere and freshly chopped rosemary instead of dill. On the first batch I sprinkled parmesan, on the second batch I sprinkled coarse ground salt. Both were terrific. And I agree with the other reviews: much easier to make and a prettier presentation when you use a pastry bag. These are a fast and yummy appetizer -- and great with champagne!

Having never attempted anything like this, I was overjoyed when this recipe yielded something similar to what I'd had in a restaurant. I also add slightly more gruyere, plus some grated parmesan. And whether you spoon or pastry-bag it, make sure the portions are tiny, or else they don't puff as well.

I prefer the original version of the gougere recipe using sharp cheese, brushing a mixture of Dijon mustard and wine on top of the cooked gougere and then sprinkling with Parmesan cheese. Goes so well with white wine as an appetiser! Suzie.

I like using black pepper instead of dill seeds and omit sprinkling anything on the tops.

This is a variation of an old recipe Gourmet published in the late 60's. The original version used a sharp chedder cheese sprinkled with fresh grated parmasean, which I still prefer. Also, don't waste your time spooning these out, use a pastry bag. it is faster and makes a better presentation. cook them until just before they brown and then throw them in the freezer. Because the choux dough makes them mostly air, they reheat and brown quickly. I've reheated and served them over a month later and noticed no difference. A definite keeper for emergencies.
