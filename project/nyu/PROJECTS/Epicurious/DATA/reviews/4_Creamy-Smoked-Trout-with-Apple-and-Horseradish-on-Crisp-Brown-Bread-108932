Loved it! Loved it! The combination of the smoked trout, apples, horseradish and lemon was sublime. Works well with stone wheat and water crackers in addition to the black bread or pumpernickel.

Ugh...This recipe was not a hit when I brought it as an appetizer to a dinner party. It was the only thing left on the table after all the other appetizers were cleared out.

I make this all the time -- great for any season and everyone loves it. the more horseradish, the better.

I made this for our Christmas party last night and it turned out great! My husband voted it his favorite. :) I made it the night before, due to another reviewer's note that they thought it actually tasted better the next day. Then the day of the party I only had to make the toast and that was nice. It was yummy the next day, and the day after too. The only things I changed were that I used fat free sour cream, and low fat mayonnaise. I don't think it affected the flavor at all. The crisp apples were yummy to have in the winter too. I will definitely be making this again!

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner. Couldn't find smoked trout anywhere, so I used packaged smoked salmon (found in the supermarket next to the tuna). It was a HUGE HIT!!! I made so many appetizers that we couldn't finish everything, and I found that this recipe stored well overnight and we served the rest on Christmas. Next time may use as a filling for stuffed cherry tomatoes or new potatoes.

This was absolutely fabulous! This was my contribution to my gourmet wine-dinner club this weekend and everyone gave it "four forks" plus! I used prepared horseradish instead of fresh and added about 1/2 T more just before serving. I didn't use all of the sauce, probably had about 1/4 cup left. I added the sauce a little at a time to get to the moistness I wanted when mixing everything up. We decided this would also make a great light luncheon salad on lettuce with some fruit on the side! I can't wait to make this again!

Delicious! I didn't use all of the creamy horseradish mixture to avoid a "soupy" spread. The toasted pumpernickel is a must. Stays good for days! I added the apple last to avoid browning.

This recipe was great! And easy. Due to a remodel in progress, we don't have a kitchen right now, but we still go to a potluck every month with friends. Finding things to bring has been a challenge. This recipe is so easy -- just cut things up and throw it together -- that I could make it on my coffee table with a knife and a cutting board. And people raved! We made it in early December, and it was refreshing to have something as an appetizer which was so light and crisp tasting. A lovely smokey taste too. For the two vegetarians in the group, I made some in a separate bowl and instead of smoked trout, I marinated some tofu in some Lapsung Souchung tea (a very smokey tasting tea), and it turned out lovely. Almost the same taste as the original, but no meat.

Made this for an apple-themed party and it was a hit, even with picky eaters. A few weeks later we came across a very similar dip at a hipster seafood place (they served it with saltine crackers)- we all agreed that this was much better. Only thing I changed was adding a bit more horseradish. There weren't any leftovers, so we made more the next day and spread it on toasted bagels for brunch. Nummy!

Just realized that I left the "h" out of thyme ... a stickler for spelling, I am mortified ...... ha ha

I love this recipe, but as always, I added my own signature, a head of roasted garlic (mashed), a couple of sprigs of tyme, a few leaves of basil and Italian parsley (chopped), the zest of one lemon, three dashes of Emeril"s Bayou Blast and I served it with Trader Joe's Wheat Crisps. My guests were begging for more.

Cored and thin sliced 2 Granny Smiths, mixed them in 4 TBS. lemon juice and used in place of crackers or bread(left apple out of recipe).Very good.

Mine got better with time. It had a strong fish taste right after I made it. Was actually best the next day. Also liked it served in endive leaves.

These were amazing! Didn't change a thing (tried it on crackers, too...yum)

The flavor was good, but I was dissappointed with the consistency. I don't blame the recipe for that ... my smoked fillets were on the dry side. So, be sure to select nice moist fillets and I am sure this would be even more delicious!

Excellent hors d'oeuvre! I also used the mini pumpernickel cocktail loaf and this was super-easy - the most tedious part was the matchstick sized apple slices, but I can live with that. Looking forward to using what's leftover of the spread on a toasted bagel - Mmmmm!!!

Really good. I took it to a party, and it was a big hit. I added a little more mayo and sour cream, chopped the apples instead of making matchsticks. I think it's better with crackers than toast points.

Absolutely fabulous, easy appetizer. My guests enjoyed it immensely. I toasted a loaf of the little, pre-sliced, square cocktail bread, and it was perfect.
