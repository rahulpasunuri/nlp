My mom introduced me to this lamb and salsa verde recipe which she found in Giada's cookbook. It's a perfect summer dish and great for a BBQ, serving many. I used the salsa verde on grilled Greek seasoned chicken breasts with a tomato/cucumber/feta salad, tzaziki and white rice. It was a hit. The salsa would also be great on fish as suggested by others.

Made this for Easter dinner, everyone loved it. I also loved that I could prep it the night before, marinate in fridge overnight and it was ready to go when I was ready to cook it. Will definitely make again. I had the butcher bone and butterfly, but I needed to do a lot more trimming of the fat, if I had not done that I do not think it would have come out as well.

This was very good - added some Nicoise olives but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. Prepped it the day before which was nice - one less thing to do the day of... and the flavours truly permeated the roast. Stood up well to the lamb - would be too overpowering for pork or even beef.

this is delicious! the salsa verde absolutely makes the dish. like another reviewer, i prepped the roast the day before, partly to allow it to marinate and partly because i wanted to just zip in from church, bring the meat up to room temp, then put it in the oven. it came out beautifully tender and flavorful. i had bought a boned, but not trimmed or butterflied, leg of lamb... will seek out professional help on those annoying tasks next time, although the end result was worth some effort.

Absolutely delicious and a very nice change of pace. It is easy and yet complex in taste.

Made this for Easter dinner this year and it was a huge hit. That salsa verde is so fresh. It's absolutely delicious and well worth starting early so the meat can marinate overnight. Will be making this again.

As the recipe is written, one hour and 20 min is way too long to roast this piece of meat. I made the mistake of not checking the temp until 1 hour after I put it in the oven and it was already way over done. The salsa verde was good, but not WOW. Good recipe, way too long on the cooking time.

The salsa verde was delicious, I put it through the blender and heated it before I served it, but the high heat made my oven smoke horribly.

This is a wonderful recipe for lamb. I wish that I had doubled the salsa verde because it was so delicious.

The salsa verde was nothing special. I tasted it before putting it on the lamb, and I needed to add more mint. Also, the roasting time was too long for rare lamb.

I actually had two butterflied leg of lamb, so it cooked in about 1 hour. It was perfect! I pulled them out of the oven at 125 degrees and the meat was tender and a little pink! PERFECT! The salsa verde added a delicious flavor. I added a little more basil and mint than called for in the recipe as I felt the marinade needed to be a bit thicker. This was an incredibly easy dish! A real keeper!

Made for Easter Dinner. Wonderful. I grilled the lamb and basted with salsa,sliced and napped with more salsa. Perfect. Everyone loved.

I only added 1/4 cup of olive oil to the salsa. The sauce was much better the next day. I was a bit concerned about pulling the roast from the oven at 120 degrees but after it rested it was perfectly cooked to med. rare.

This was an amazing dish. I'd never made leg of lamb before and this was an excellent initiation. The sauce was complex and rich; my husband and I just loved it!

This was just terrific. I did put the leftover salsa into the blender briefly before serving it as sauce. My guests loved it.

I made this as part of my Easter meal and it was a huge success. I had 16 for dinner from young teens to adults and they loved it, as did I, over the ham. I made no changes, followed it to a T. This was the first time I ever made a leg of lamb. It was delicious!

Very easy dish to make. You can manipulate the recipe but you don't need to do so. Delicious.

This is a winner. It is great to prepare the night before and just pop it in the oven the next day. Yes the salsa was very soupy. It seemed more like a marinade for the first step. For its' overnight stay in the frige I wrapped it in plastic wrap and tied it with string just before cooking. I too wound up straining off the juice to make it more like a salsa to put over the lamb. I thought it was really yummy!

I made this recipe exactly as it is written with a 3.5 lb boneless leg of lamb. It took two of us to tie up the leg with the string because the butterflied leg of lamb is difficult to hold together. The salsa verde was very tasty but I agree with another reviewer that a cup of olive oil is excessive. I found myself straining the salsa when I added it to my serving of lamb. That said, it is delicious. I'm really looking forward to trying the salsa in other dishes.

A cup of olive oil? Half a cup of lemon juice? This is not a recipe for "Salsa Verde," it's a recipe for olive oil soup. And if you want a "butterflied" leg of lamb, go somewhere other than Whole Foods, where it's butterflied if it's boneless. I fully anticipate being crucified by my guests on Easter '06. Perhaps, I can amuse them by a trip to McDonalds.

We didn't have any leg of lamb, but the salsa verde with pork tenderloin was amazing! I've made it three times and will keeep it in my recipe collection as one of my favorites!
