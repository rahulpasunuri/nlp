This was a lovely side dish. I do like couscous but find many recipes too bland. This wasn't too bad but I added a chicken stock cube to the water prior to adding the couscous and I threw in a dash of Herbes de Provence.

We liked this very much. My husband declared it was the best couscous preparation he'd ever had.

a good basic recipe - I added some sauteed sliced potatoes, an extra tomato, some cumin, and substitued green pepper for the zuchini - served with grilled chicken - it was excellent!

For my taste this dish could use twice the veggies and perhaps more spice. A good, basic dish that's easy to make, but personalize it to make it tastier.

Delicious by itself and with the snapper. And very easy. Will make it frequently.
