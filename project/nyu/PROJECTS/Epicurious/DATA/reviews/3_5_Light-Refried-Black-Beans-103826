Works with white beans, too.

Needs salt. 1 teaspoon worked for me. Very good warm with grated cheese on top.

Excellent. I added a bit of canned corn towards the end to vary the texture and seasoned generously with paprika, cumin, and chopped cilantro.

Loved how easy it was and that I could control my spices. Followed the advice and didn't add water. Next time I will probably add finely chopped onion and bell pepper for color.

This is a really simple, easy to prepare recipe. I would definitely make it again.

Love this recipe! so simple and easy 100 times better than any canned refried beans. I esp. like to use it for the Tostada with beans, eggs and chorizo recipe on this site.

This was insanely easy. I added some salt, cumin, coriander, and lime. Far and away the best refried black beans I've ever had!

Like other reviewers, I added more flavor. I added some diced red onion, which I had on hand from making salsa, that I sauteed to being soft before adding the beans. I used pinto beans and after mashing cooked for some time over low heat until it was creamy. I didn't even use the liquid poured off the can, as the liquid that clung to the beans was enough to make a thick sauce.

Just made these for dinner to put in burritos. Added an onion, dried cumin, dried corriander, and no water (they had plenty with the liquid from the can) and oh my gawsh they were awesome!

I was desperate for a base for my 7 layer dip and only had a can of red kidney beans. This worked fine with the substitution. I also added some lime and some "Pete's Hot Sauce" to the mix and it was great!

I have made this recipe many times.I add whatever I have in the fridge,carrots,celery, green onions. But for me, the most important addition is a tablespoon or so of chopped chipotle. Also I use olive oil and skip the water. It's great!

I agree with those who said this needed a little something. I added some bacon bits and a splash of lime juice -- yummy!

I thought these were great. The beans had much more flavor than I'd expected. Plus, this is super-easy. And, low-fat. Great!

Something was amiss for me in this recipe, there was a funky aftertaste. I'm not sure if it was the corn oil or the liquid in the can, both of which I don't usually use. I'll probably keep looking for a staple recipe for refried beans.

When making beans I always add a little vinegar--apple cider--to them and let it boil off a bit. It needs a little acidity. Also, I recommend a squeeze of lime before serving.

great basic recipe with just salt and pepper. added cayenne, red pepper, coriander and cumin - just a touch and it was incredible. be careful not to use as much liquid as called for or it gets too runny. I used about 1/4 of the liquid.

Forgot to mention, I added no water at all and it was still on the soupy side (although it does thicken up after standing for a while).

This is a very good basic recipe, but definitely needed some "jazzing up." I added ground cumin, coriander and cayenne pepper to taste. Don't be shy with the fresh cilantro! Served over jasmine rice, it was delicious.

Great side to mexican food. I topped with cajeta cheese and a dab of sour cream. YUM.

I couldn't believe how delicious these were for so little work. I will make this often.

Generally, I don't like it when people rate a recipe they've doctored up. But this recipe really needed a little doctoring. I cooked as described, but added a little cumin and corriander, plus a few spoons of salsa at the end. I served over left-over white rice w sour cream and cheese. It made a very quick and healthy meal. Three forks with my additions (or whatever you like)--only 2 as written.

Couldn't be quicker or easier, but too bland for my taste. I needed to add some sea salt and double the garlic.

I took the comments of the other cook who is on a lo-carb diet and used Eden Organic. The only difference is that I used soy beans and used bacon grease to fry up the beans. I let them cool and then reheated them before serving. I'm not a fan of refried beans but these were really good. My husband thinks they were only okay given he has a thing against soy beans. :-) I'd imagine using the black beans would make it great. Definitely completed the Chili Rellenos dinner!

I have only bought refried beans in a can or dried in a box. This tasted a thousand times better than those, I will make them myself all the time, and it took about 5 minutes! Also added a tsp. on cumin powder.

These were good, not great. Being from Texas, I can only give these two forks. But not bad for "light" refried beans. Really easy, but do need some jazzing up.

Very nice! I added a little bit of cayenne in addition to the other ingredients since these beans were not that flavorful to start. I had the Eden 15-oz cans of Black Beans, and there was enough liquid in the can so that I didn't need to add any additional water. Ended up exceeding my expectations, and, since I'm on a low-carb diet, these are about the only kind of beans I could eat regularly. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I made this using black beans as part of a "Fiesta" themed pot-luck buffet dinner. The beans were really easy to make and very good. I would make them again for sure.

Hey who knew how easy this was to make??? I also did the grean onion thing too (thanks I never would have thought) I served this with Chimimgas sour cream homemade salsa OLE'

Like the cook from San Fran, I added green onions to the garlic and also added a little diced jalapeno. Then, I transfered the beans to a baking dish, put a little queso fresco on top and let it sit in the oven for a while. The result was delicious. I'll make again soon.

These black beans rise as high as black beans can go--which is pretty darn high. I used canned beans with 50% less salt, then went heavy on the garlic and cilantro. They are better than I have tasted in any Mexican or Cuban restaurant.

I make a lot of stuff from this site. At some point I was bound to get burned. Here it is. This was nasty. Sorry Folks.

Very simple and easy to make. Just like the the real thing. I used pinto beans, and added them to the pan through a food mill. Saves a lot of mashing.

Very yummy and so easy to make-- who knew? I added some chopped green onion to the garlic and added a tablespoon of fat-free sour cream near the end to make it creamier. I also grated a little fresh monterey jack cheese on top and it was fantastic!
