Great, very tasty recipe that takes advantage of summer's bounty. Makes a great side to BBQ'd chicken or fish, or a light supper w/a fried egg as suggested. I would use a lot more fresh herbs, though. A couple teaspoons or so of fresh thyme, and some fresh basil is great.

I agree that this dish is missing "something". I did add jalapeños, which were a good addition, maybe next time I will add more. I will definitely still make it again. It was enjoyable to eat and cook.

I though that this recipe was fun to make and overall worth the effort. I forgot to add the corn cream back in to the dish until we had eaten some of it. Don't do that! The corn cream is what makes the dish! I do have to say, though, that it was missing a little something. I added a little more paprika, and it may even be a good idea to add a little cayenne. I made this with grilled steaks for a nice summer meal.

Very tasty! I made it with the fried egg and it was a great dinner. Next time I make it, I might toss in some finely chopped jalepeno to balance out the sweetness of the corn.
