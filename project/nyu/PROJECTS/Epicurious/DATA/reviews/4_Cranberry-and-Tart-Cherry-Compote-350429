Made some changes, to accommodate ingredients in the fridge and to decrease sugar. Used pomegranate juice instead of cranberry cocktail and about a half cup of cranberry sauce instead of currant jelly. Is a great recipe, not too sweet at all. Next time, I would try a Polaner all fruit currant jelly, if I had one in the house.

Very easy and forgiving recipie. Bought dried cherries in commercial grocery store, wasn't sure they were the "right" cherries, but came out great regardless. Superb alternative to cranberry sauce in can. Family with mainstream taste loved it. Will make it again this Thankgsiving.

I used canned jellied cranberry sauce in place of the currant jelly and it was wonderful!

Made this for Turkey Day and it was a hit. Great twist to having traditional cranberry sauce. Will definitely make it again.

This is fabulous! I end up doubling this recipe because it goes so fast! I've made other variations using blueberries, which make great toppings for pancakes.

Yum! Just as good as the other recipe on the site involving dried cherries in a cranberry sauce. The currant jelly changes the flavour to something quite different than the other recipe, in a good way I think.

I make this every year for the holidays, I'm not a huge fan of cranberries, but the flavor combination in this is wonderful. I think I usually double the receipe so I have some to give away.

I made these with our traditional Thanksgiving dinner. It was my first time making cranberry sauce from scratch, and I was amazed by how easy and fast they were to make. I particularly like this recipe because it doesn't have orange peel. The sour cherries are also a nice touch. This will be a mainstay on our Thanksgiving menu from now on.

This sauce was the perfect addition to our Thanksgiving meal of smoked turkey and ham. Very tart--a little taste explosion in your mouth. Definitely a keeper.

I thought this was a different, delicious way to make cranberry sauce. My son-in-law, who hates spice, was not wild about the allspice taste. Everyone else just loved it! I would definitely make it again.

Amazingly good. Usually, I like my cranberry sauce "straight"--no orange peel, etc., but this was the best I've ever tasted. Well worth the little extra effort. It's our new family recipe.

A little too sweet for my tastebuds. Yet, it went quite well with the Thanksgiving meal.

Fab combinations.... Indeference to Southwestern taste, I eliminated the jelly and added two seeded and finely chopped jalapenos with the lime peel. Again - really special. Retired chef
