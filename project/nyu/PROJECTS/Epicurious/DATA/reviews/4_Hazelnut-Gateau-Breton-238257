Excellent, full hazelnut flavor gently highlighted by the vanilla (I also used extract). I used an 8 inch springform pan instead of the 9 and it did require the full hour baking time but turned out perfectly.

I forgot to note, I baked it for only about 20 - 25 minutes; thanks to other reviewers for the heads up.

This was easy to make and wonderful.Even better the next day or two, assuming it is kept well-wrapped. I could not find hazelnuts and used almonds instead. Small slices only, it is rich.

This cake is a dream. Buttery, toasty, dense, travels beautifully, and lasts for at least a week when well wrapped. I make it every few months and always have a hard time letting others eat some!

After making Far Breton in Dorie Greenspan's book, I can't help but wonder if I should try this again. Mine the first time was so hard I could barely cut it. I guess I severly overbaked. Will try again soon.

This one is special. A unique cross between shortbread and pound cake. Somehow it is elegant and comforting at once. Two teaspoons of vanilla works perfectly if you don't have vanilla sugar/bean, and 3/4 teaspoon of salt is sufficient if you only have unsalted butter on hand. Overall, it is dense, buttery, and just delicious.

I made this with regular sugar, vanilla extract, non-organic eggs, unsalted butter, and bleached flour. Having butchered the recipe así, I would say it is still pretty good. A nice, not too sweet, sort of different cake.

This was delicious and so easy. I picked this recipe as I had a bunch of egg yolks I needed to use after making the blender chocolate mousse (also outstanding!). I used pecans as that was what I had on hand, and they worked great.

This was a very tasty cake. Not too sweet. I did not have vanilla bean so I used about 3/4 tsp of vanilla. I wish I had used more. Also I might decrease the baking time on this a little. Mine was in for about 40 minutes before I took it out. The edges were very dark brown. Despite this, the inside of the cake turned out well. I think I will try the Frengelico whipped cream next time.

This got wows from all guests at my dinner party. I took tips from other reviewers--since I had no vanilla bean, I used 2 tsp. of vanilla extract (regular, not double strength), and I also wanted to use frangelico in the garnish. I whipped some cream up, and then beat in a bit of frangelico. I didn't measure, but it was just enough so that you could lightly taste it in the richness of the cream. I left it unsweetened. I also candied some hazelnuts with a simple water-sugar mix. When serving time came, I dolloped the frangelico-whipped cream in several spots around the edge of the cake, and topped each one with a candied hazelnut. It was gorgeous and the cake was delicious. Mine also turned very brown, which scared me a bit, but the cake inside was a normal color and incredibly moist. (I was really surprised by the latter attribute). In any case, it got rave reviews. I will definitely be making this again!!!

I serve it for my son's birthday with creme fraîche with a hint of frangelico liquor. Divine

This was delicious. We served it with dollops of strawberry jam on top, hot fudge sauce and vanilla ice cream. I would make it again.

Good, I made it with almonds and I'm sure it would have been better with hazelnuts. A little like a pound cake or a nutty, chocolate-free brownie. Mine got pretty brown on the edges and bottom crust. . .

Very rich, but very good. I had a baking bug so didn't have time to make vanilla sugar, but i used a whole vanilla bean, and wow, it was super decadent.

This was an easy recipe to make. The aroma while it was baking was incredible. I used egg white wash over the top instead of the yolk. I didn't have a vanilla bean so I used 1 & 1/2 tsp. double strength extract instead. It was still very delicious. It's like a shortbread in a dense cake...a great scone replacement. I am saving this one!!
