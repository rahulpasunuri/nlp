We were very disappointed in this recipe after seeing the other reviews that raved about it. While edible we found it bland and dry, not worth making again.

I found this salad rather disappointing, especially given how much I love chicken sate and Asian- inspired slaws. Although not truly bad, it was simply lacklustre. Despite the ease with which the salad can be assembled, I can't imagine that I'll make it again, as I can't think of any easy or minor revisions that would spruce it up.

Love this! When I bring to pot lucks and parties, this is often one of the most popular dishes, notable particularly for an entree competing in a dessert-laden world! Three personal preferences: 1) serve with much less dressing already on it and more on the side, along with more lime wedges and chopped cilantro. Not only can each person adjust for personal likes and dislikes, but also the manner of offering the additional lime, cilantro and dressing can add to the presentation. 2) consider adding some additional vegetables, liked blanched and sliced sugar snap peas or snow peas, or perhaps slivered bits of plum tomatoes. 3) As I find most store-cooked chicken to be too dry, I typically poach my own chicken using a method I believe is Asian. It is close to effortless and calls for bringing enough water to cover a chicken to a boil (with some ginger slices and scallions added for flavor), adding chicken (whole or parts), covering tightly and then turning off the heat. Left undisturbed for an hour or so, the chicken will still be steaming hot -- and moist and flavorful to perfection. When cool enough to handle (and not lose its juices), separate the meat from the skin and bones. Remaining cooking liquid could be useful as base for Asian soups calling for chicken stock. Return skin and bones to cooking liquid to concentrate the flavors; strain. BTW  This now my preferred way to start traditional chicken soup, too. I recommend using bay leaf, dill, carrots, parsley, and the like for flavor. When chicken is poached to desired point, do as above. Then return skin and bones to the pot, perhaps with additional chicken parts for flavor; simmer until broth is adequately concentrated. After straining, embellish or use the simple broth for stock. Bonus: fabulous cooked chicken for sandwhiches, for more traditional chicken salad or for any other recipe that calls for chicken.

Oh, one more thing - serve with LOTS of lime juice. Even with all the vinegar, it needs the extra tang.

I made the dressing more or less as written, and it was quite good. However, since we don't care for cabbage, I sauteed some shredded brussels sprouts instead and mixed those with the chicken, peppers and mint (didn't have any cilantro), and served the whole thing warm. It was good, but I'm not sure I loved the strong flavor of the sprouts with the dressing. Also, the rotisserie chicken had a somewhat mushy texture that was unappealing (that's the fault of the grocery store, though, not the recipe). Would definitely make again, if only for the dressing, but may try shredded romaine lettuce or something else next time.

It took me about 1/2 hour with all the ingredient preparation. My dressing came out perfectly following the directions and using Skippy Peanut Butter. It tastes delicious.

I followed the recipe exactly and while the flavor was ok/good the product was way too thick and sticky and made goop out of the salad. I used Skippy peanut butter. Maybe that was the problem. After I followed the recipe I upped the flavor with more ginger, soy and sesame oil but the pasty texture was awful. Did anyone else have to water it down further and with what, besides water?

I made this for Mothers Day and it was a hit! The dressing is perfect to use for dipping carrots and cucumbers into as well. The salad was creamy and satisfying and I've already made it again since.

excellent! my husband loved it! we made whole wheat roti to go with it and ended up making "wraps." i added a hint of salt and extra red pepper flakes to spice things up. next time i'll increase the garlic as well. don't skip the lime wedges!

I bought a rotisserie chicken but when I opened it at home (after I made this sauce), the chicken was no good so I ended up back at the store buying raw chicken tenders. I cooked the chicken in a skillet with a little bit of oil. Then I put sesame oil in the skillet, cooked some scallions, garlic, ginger and then added vegetables and did a stir fry. I also cooked some noodles and when the vegetable stir fry was done, I mixed the cooked chicken, the vegetables and the noodles together in a big bowl. It was delicious - a big hit! Not the salad I planned but the sauce worked for a chicken sate, vegetable, noodle stir fry.

Great recipe, good use for leftover chicken (never mind the "rotisserie" kind). I would say serves no more than 6 (forget "6-8"). Recognize that the "active time" is much more than 10 minutes (all that chopping!) but worth the effort. I will definitely be making this again!

This was very dull, especially the dressing which was ooky-thick. Much better recipes for this dish on this website...

This was really good! I would use a little less chicken next time, but really tasty, great sauce.

Great peanut sauce and wonderful light salad. Made a few changes: grilled chicken breast and added jimaca to the broccoli slaw I used. Definitely a keeper!

Really good. My husband took the leftovers for lunch at work today and his coworkers tasted it and want the recipe. We used broccoli slaw. My chicken didn't yield as much meat as the recipe called for and it would have been even better with more chicken. We will make this one again!
