Wonderful flavor, but the filling fell apart. We're going to experiment to see if we can get the filling to stay together, because we are going to make this again.

My family loved this pie at Thanksgiving, but next time I will use half the amount of marmalade... it overpowered the pears. I also prepared the fruit mixture first & let it sit while I rolled out my crust, it helped to soften my slightly green pears & let everything soak up the brandy.

I've made this recipe at least half a dozen times over the past several years. It is delicious and always gets rave reviews. Make more filling than the recipe calls for and mound it up a bit in the pie dish. It presents better. Also try substituting Apricot marlmalade for the orange, and currants for the raisins. Nice variation.

This pie was wonderful. I did however leave off the marmalade 'cause I didn't have any and didn't want to substitute any other kind of jam for fear it would make it to sweet. I also mixed all filling ingredients except for the cornstarch together and let them sit for about an hour in a bowl. If the juices had been > 1/2 c., I would have boiled these down a little to concentrate them and prevent a mushy pie; however, there was not this much this time so after they sat, I just mixed in the cornstartch and finished the pie. On the firmness of pears, I used some firm and some slightly soft pears to see which was preferred. While the firm pieces weren't "apple-pie" soft, they were still tender and indeed preferred over the softer ones. Six of us polished off this scrumptious pie in one sitting :)

I used firm bosc pears which never softened sufficiently. I couldn't bake it any longer without burning the crust. Also, the dish was awfully sweet. My guests said it was good, but I don't think I'd try it again.

We are a family of 5. And all of us prefer fruit pies to cakes. So this pie is an nice different recipe from all the different apple pies, squares and crumbles. Especially at this time of the year, it was nice to offer a pie with a fruit of the season. I might make it for Chrismas dinner and I would add some fresh cranberries to it.

I thought this pie lacked in flavor. I used ripe Anjou pears but would suggest using Bosc pears (I think they have more flavor and intensity, which is necessary for this pie.) The pie was just ok, nothing special.
