Made this recipe as written and it was fantastic. Wouldn't change a thing. Perfect.

Really appreciate the cook from SF who explained how to correctly shell and then peel fava beans - it was just in time to ease my confusion on my first time out of the gate (or in the kitchen, as you'd have it) with fava beans...

This dish is really lovely. Quite easy to make, appealing on the plate, and very tasty. We paired it with a couscous salad and thought about adding asparagus on the side but then bailed on that. The only down side is the work required to prepare the fava beans.

Knocked it out of the park on Mother's day with this recipe. Only change was I used scallops instead of the Halibut. It was amazing! My two cents on the cooks who complained about the starchiness of the fava beans. Fava Beans are delicious when in-season, but in my experience using frozen our out of season ones -- you'll definitely find them to be starchy. Don't bother making this unless you have great fava beans -- this dish is a showcase for gorgeous produce!

I thought this sounded great but didn't have a number of the ingredients on hand so here is what i did instead: Replaced the red pepper flakes with white wine and tossed in some smashed sauteed garlic (I also tossed in some artichoke paste I had from a recent vacation but certainly not something that is necessary). Instead of drenching in flour, I broiled the fish with dill, lemon, white white, salt, pepper. Broil uncovered for 5-6 min, then cover lightly with foil for 4-5min. Complemented dinner with a mache and butter lettuce salad with tomatoes and thinly sliced fennel. Topped off by a great white with just the slightest touch of sweetness to cut the acidity.

I'd give it less than 1 fork, if possible. This was edible but did not really enjoy it. Maybe it's just me. Not my thing... I think the mash was kind of bland although I put more dried pepper than asked for and drenched the whole thing in lemon but it was just... spicy. Bland and spicy. Oh well.

Excellent dish that's perfect for the spring or summer. Yes, the fava beans take around an hour to shell, boil, cool and peel, but it's worth it. Alternatively, you can buy frozen fava beans as some of the other reviewers have done. I used fava beans and mint from my garden. For a side dish, I heartily recommend a couscous dish that I whipped up. Put two and a half cups of Israeli (pearl) couscous into three cups of boiling chicken broth. I used Imagine Foods non-chicken broth. Bring to a boil, cover, lower heat, and cook for ten minutes. Fluff up when done and toss with some olive oil, toasted pine nuts, half a chopped tomato, sliced kalamata olives, crumbled feta and some fresh parsley. Enjoy!

I haven't made the recipe, but just to clear up some misconceptions about fava beans: you don't soak them, you remove them from the pod, then you blanch them, then you slip them from their outer layer. If you are eating that layer it probably does taste starchy and heavy.

I Loved this dish!!! So much good flavor and I didn't mind all the prep with the beans, I was in the mood to spend time in the kitchen. I'm wondering though, if the leftover mashed fava beans will hold up if I freeze them. Does anyone know?

Just wanted to point out that Halibut is NOT overfished and in danger of extinction, as a matter of fact is one of the better managed fisheries in the world. For a list of fish stocks go the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)and you will get the real scoop. BY the way Fava beans are not THAT hard to peel, have you ever tried to make mole from scratch??? THAT is hard

Delicious! Will make this light and refreshing dish again!

We really enjoyed this. Yes, Pacific halibut is considered a good choice by the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The fava beans were a lot of work, but worth it. Put on some nice music and enjoy some wine and have fun, that's how to enjoy cooking! Mostly followed the recipe, but increased the mint/lemon/red pepper/salt rub to increase the flavor. And add a bit more olive oil and a fair amount of fresh lemon juice when pureeing the favas. Delicious! And fun to make.

I apologize for doing this but I haven't yet made this recipe but wanted to respond to the comment about halibut being a bad fish to eat for the environment. If you check Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch website you'll see that Pacific halibut is given a green light. It's just Atlantic that is bad. http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/SeafoodWatch/web/sfw_factsheet.aspx?gid=9 This recipe looks great!

This is a GREAT recipe for fava beans. I grow them and I'm always looking for new ways to prepare them. Fava beans are always worth the time and effort--they are seasonal and have a unique flavor and color. Oh and the halibut is really good too.

I signed up just so I could write a review. Today is Earth Day. Halibut is overfished to the point of it being endangered. While you have "green topics" splashed all over your home page today, wouldn't it have been more genuine to feature an earth-friendly recipe today, of all days? Maybe a vegetarian dish (better yet with heirloom vegetables), which has a lower carbon footprint than meat-containing meals. Or if you must have meat, how about grassfed beef or truly free-range chicken? I normally really enjoy your site, but today I am disappointed with you.

Poker Guy's decided this one. Fish good, Bean Bad. Well it did scrape a 3 on the rating vote but it was close. Just wasnt a big joy in the eating of this one. Not one of my faves at all, but some of the guys really liked the Fava on garlic flat bread. The Halibut was excellent.

I give this recipe three forks because the fish was really delicious and the rub perfectly complimented the flavor of the fish. The fava beans on the other hand were a huge pain. I've never prepared them before and to be fair, only let them soak for about ten hours after getting a bag at the farmers' market. They took a lot of effort to peel and needed MUCH more cook time than the recipe called for. The result was a mealy, heavy, starchy concoction. Maybe I'm just a fava bean novice but I don't think I'll go back to them again. Would also second other reviewer's calls to make some extra rub for the fish.

I questioned this recipe when I first read it so I was pleasantly surprised with the nice change of the fish routine. The grocery had no favas (dry or frozen) so I used lima beans. They take some extra effort to mash. I also made the mistake of buying spearmint instead of regular mint. I was worried it would be too minty, but the result was great with the fish. Other thoughts: used lemon zest and only 4 pieces of fish (which meant I had enough rub). NOTE: fresh halibut is expensive so don't buy too much.

I usually choose recipes that are quick and simple. This recipe fit the bill. And we wanted to include more fish in our diets. No substitutions were made. My husband and I loved this recipe. This was the first time I cooked fava beans and was a bit intimidated. Once I got started it was simple. After shelling the pods the peeling of the beans turned out to be squeezing out the beans from it's skin. This recipe is fresh and healthy. The lemon peel, we used zest, added a delicate flavor.

Fresh and delicious! This was actually really good... I used frozen edamame beans, which weren't very elegant-looking when mashed, but the blend of flavors was TASTY. Salt note: I think the halibut was a little too salty; next time I will cut the salt in the rub and maybe add a touch more to the beans.

I wasn't very sure about this recipe when i first read it but decided to give it a shot. It turned out way above my expectations and my husband could not stop raving about it. Made a few small changes. I could not find fava beans so I used a combination of Lima beans and edamame and after cooking them, put them in my food processor with the rest of the ingredients. Also, followed the previous reviewers advice about the amount of mint mixture you spread on top of the fish. The amounts listed in the recipe make enough for a little over one fillet. I tripled it for the three filets I made and let them sit for about an hour before cookie. Absolutly delicious recipe with a great combination of flavors.

I've made this dish twice since it was published, once for my wife and she then "requested" it when she hosted her ladies night event. Both times it turned out wonderfully. My only comment is that the amount directed to make for the mint/lemon rub for the halibut is WAY TOO little to cover the amount of fish. I quadrupled it the second time and it was still not enough - I had to make more. Also, I only cooked the fish for 3 minutes each side so that the fish didn't get too tough.
