This is awesome - I have made it many times and find it goes with most anything. I do usually put in extra orange and lime juice and use serrano chiles from my garden. Tonight it is going on Chilean Sea Bass - but I have served it with a spicy grilled chicken with great success. One of my favorite go-tos when I serve a variety of grilled proteins and a variety of "sauces/salsas"

This was a very interesting combination, I also added some garlic, but just half a clove and way more lime and orange juice because it wasn't becoming pasty enough. I made it for flank skeak but the next day I also served it on burgers instead of relish, it was amazing!

Understand that this is not what most people think of when they think of chutney. That said: it's quite good. I didn't have fresh hot peppers so used some cayenne. The mix of hot, sweet, and citrus does quite well with the mint. Easy - fast - colorful - tasty.

To the other reviewer...this is more of an Indian-style chutney...not the type of chutney you would generally think of...it comes out looking more like a paste than a sauce. When I make grilled tandoori chicken, I make a similar kind that is made with cilantro and parsley. The chutney/paste gives a very fresh and pleasing to the palate zing to grilled meats. With these thoughts in mind, I would recommend that they try it again.

I used serrano chilies instead, added 2 cloves of garlic, skipped the orange zest, and used green onions instead. It was delicious with Indian style lentils and basmati rice.

I made this in a blender rather than a food processor, but it was awful and took much more than 15 minutes. Are you sure it isn't 1/2 cup of mint, the lime and orange juices couldn't even be tasted.
