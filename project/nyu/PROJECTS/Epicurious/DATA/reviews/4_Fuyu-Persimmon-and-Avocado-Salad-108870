Made as described except on spring mix. Fantastic. This is our first time eating persimmon and glad to have such a great first recipe. Ironically, hated the dressing when tasted alone, but it really worked well w/ the persimmon and avocado. might want to try with jicama too next time.

By far the best fall salad that I've had. The miso and vinegar make the persimmon taste super sweet and scrumptious. We live in the Southern Hemisphere and can't wait for autumn to come which brings fresh persimmons. Add a crusty loaf of bread and some seared protein such as shrimp, chicken or salmon and it's an entire meal.

Outstanding. Full of flavor. Made no changes in recipe.

This is a great alternative to the overdone greens/dried fruit/nut/blue or goat cheese salads. Avocado and persimmon make a nice combination. Didn't have a lemon handy and used a fig vinegar instead, which added a nice sweetness. A good balsamic vinegar would also be good I think.

Delicious! The velvety texture of the avocado goes so nicely with the crisp sweetness of the persimmons. Used baby spinach for the greens and only had red miso on hand so used that and was good, but suspect white would be even better. My boyfriend is Japanese and was suspicious of the flavor combination, but loved the results as much as I did.

Fabulous and without all the fat!

A wonderful combination of ingredients. Ripe persimmons are key. Miso dressing great with other salads too- makes a nice lower cholesterol alternative.

Made this with some Japanese friends. We were all curious about the combination of ingredients, but we tasted and agreed it was wonderful! White miso is much milder than most other miso, not very salty; it suits the salad nicely! However, we used extra virgin olive oil, which had too strong of an olive taste. Next time will use a milder, olive oil.

The salad has great potential, but the texture left a lot to be desired. Next time I shall replace the avocado (much as a love it, it didn't really belong in this salad) with jicama for a little crunch, and try frisee lettuce. In addition, there didn't seem to be enough zing to the dressing, so I added a little dijon mustard, which did the trick nicely.

I made this salad with bagged mixed baby greens instead of the watercress. It was delicious, and a nice alternative to ho-hum ordinary salads. The miso dressing was a bit too intense, though, and I think I will tweak it when I next make this salad (maybe by adding rice vinegar?).

These ingredients are in perfect balance and proportion. I made this as a salad course for some foodie friends at Thanksgiving dinner. It was such a hit and such a refreshing break from tradition that it was added to menus for several other gatherings throughout the holidays. The ripeness of the persimmon is equally important as the ripeness of the avocado. Be sure to use only FUYU persimmon. The miso dressing is delightful on other salads as well.
