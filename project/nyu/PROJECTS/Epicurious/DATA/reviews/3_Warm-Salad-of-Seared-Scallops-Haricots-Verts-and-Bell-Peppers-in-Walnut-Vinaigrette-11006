This recipe is one of my go to's for a quick but delicious dish. I do think if you're not careful it can get a bit oily so I omit the remaining olive oil from the vinaigrette (I just add the walnut oil) and add the vinaigrette to the dish to taste. I also usually add a touch more vinegar and omit the sugar. I've made it without the radicchio and think it's fine that way, but I think the radicchio adds a nice element of bitterness to add more contrast. Pecans work just as well as walnuts on top. I don't think it has a wow factor that deserves 4 forks, but given the simplicity of the ingredients and preparation I thought it deserved more than 3. I wish I could give it 3 1/2, but because I think it's ridiculous that they instruct you to sear your scallops first and then leave them sitting there getting overcooked and cold while you saute the veg rather than doing the reverse, I had to go with 3 stars. Still a really solid dish.

My family doesn't like peppers so left those out. I added a bit of dill to the scallops. It was just a bit bland all & all. I also accidently over-cooked the verts. Next time I'll add a little more seasoning.

Followed the recipe as presented. The result was much too bland for my taste.

Fabulous and fast. We add a bit of maple syrup to the vinagrette instead of sugar -- nice complement to the walnut.

I didn't have any haricot verts green beans, but I made this salad and it was great! I only made it for 2, so I just approximated the ingredients. The only thing it's really important to get right is the oil & vinegar amounts in the dressing. I would definitely add the haricot verts next time. If you like this salad, you might try the arugula and green bean salad on this site - it has a similar base with some good variations like goat cheese and hard-boiled egg.

This recipe serves only 4 people, but I only used 1 yellow and 1 orange pepper each. Increased both the sherry vinegar and walnut oil to intensify flavors. Sprinkled lemon on scallops after sauteeing. Beautiful presentation with the various colors.

This recipe is a keeper. What makes it is the infused sherry walnut vinaigrette. Outstanding.

While I appreciate the comments of the reviewer from maryland, I think he/she is on crack. This is by far the best warm salad recipe and I use it for the basis of all the warm salads I make. It is minimal work and maximum effect.

We have salads every Thursday evening, so I am always looking for interesting main dish salads. This was pretty good but not incredible. I am willing to put in a lot of effort for a spectacular meal, but we did not consider this salad to be worth the effort.
