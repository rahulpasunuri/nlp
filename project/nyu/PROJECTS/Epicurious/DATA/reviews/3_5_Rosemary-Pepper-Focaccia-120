I have to say that when I made this recipe I ignored the rise time and the proof times - as with an bread recipe I let the dough rise as long a it took to double. That's just been my experience with focaccia. Also, avoid spreading the dough out too thin (as you might in a pizza pan or cookie sheet) - you're going to get something similar to pizza dough. With the last focaccia I made divided the dough into 2 parts and baked each in an 8 inch cake pan (and allowed it to rise for an hour covered before I baked it) - it allowed me to get a more uniform depth. Hope that helps.

I have made this twice now, and the second time I mixed rosemary into the dough (based on previous recommendations) - that changed the flavor from good to great! However, despite a great flavor, mine isn't really turning out like a focaccia. It's more of a flavorful pizza crust. Does anyone have any tips? Thanks.

This is truly excellent. Added some rosemary to the dough in the food processor as others have suggested. Also for toppings, along with the oil, rosemary and red pepper, I sprinkled on a little parmesan and garlic powder. So yummy.

This is a good recipe for what it is - a very quick focaccia bread. I would make it again but only if I needed bread in a hurry. Next time, I will add rosemary to the dough as I found the bread itself did not have much flavour.

Excellent and EASY. Definitely jazz it up with more olive oil, garlic, parm/romano cheese. This can be used for all kinds of focaccia recipes. Bread comes out light, airy, and delicious. Ready in no time, thanks to the food processor.

Wonderful!! I took another reviewer's advice and added garlic and parmesan to the top. Only caution, double this recipe, it's gone fast.

VERY easy. I did jazz it up with some rosemary added to the dough and some garlic and parmesan added to the top before baking.

This recipe was so easy and enjoyed by all. I combined the oil with a crushed garlic clove, and brushed it over the top. Yum.

this is great! I think next time i will try to add rosemary to the dough itself, (i love rosemary) and add more pepper to the top. This was so easy to make and keps quite well.

I don't know if it was the bread flour (which I've never used before) or the recipe, but this bread was fantastic!
