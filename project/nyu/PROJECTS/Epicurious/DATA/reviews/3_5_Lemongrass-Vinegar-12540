If lucky to live near a "good" store one may now purchase fresh lemongrass paste in a toothpaste tube dispencer It feeds out in convenient units. It's in the produce section. White tube. GREAT! I put it in all kinds of foods. This is one of them. I used it friday with sucess. My poker party was appreciative of benefits received. Isn't that what cooking is all about? Combining two recipes to improve both and receive gratitude in return? Using lemon in things may it first seem strange, but jazz up things. Try it. 4 stars

Love the exotic combination & simplicity of only 2 ingred.s ....But actually you don"t have to steep herbs that long in vinegar, & look much prettier in empty wine bottles corked & sealed w/ wax.
