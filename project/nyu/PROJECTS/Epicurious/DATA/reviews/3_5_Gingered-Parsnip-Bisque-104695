I've not yet tried this recipe but when I do, I think I'll add a touch of curry; as a restaurant in my neighbourhood recently had a parsnip and ginger curry puree as their soup of the day.

We liked this soup. Not a dish beyond compare, but very good. The only change I made was to substitute 1/2 cup chardonnay for 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I will made again.

Nice flavor and easy to make. It may need more liquid added. I thought it was a little thick, but then it is a bisque.

Wonderful - simple to make yet with complex flavor. Great for fall/winter dinner parties. I used homemade chicken stock and added a carrot per others suggestion.

This has become a family favorite. It is easy to make and so flavorful. I found that using a blender, while not leaving the soup super smooth, still was delicious with the bits of parasnip and leek...also a carrot for color is a must.

This is a delicious and elegant first course soup. The flavor is surprisingly complex and spicy. I pureed it in batches in the blender and did not feel the need to strain it, as the texture was lovely as is. I made baked croutons out of slightly stale Challah to put on top.

Very good, added one carrot for color..chestnuts are a must!

This was so delicious, comforting and warm but wonderfully refreshing with the ginger flavour. It was very easy to make, too.

Definitely strain the soup because the consistancy is so much better when smooth, plus you can greatly reduce the ginger strings. I used non-fat condensed milk (per the suggestion of another cook), plus some 1% milk. The "kick" was a little too much. Next time I'll reduce the amount of ginger.

I absolutely loved this soup the first time I made it. Actually, I screwed it up--I left the parsnips in the fridge for a couple of days, and they were so shriveled up I could only use about half the amount the recipe called for. But the result was delicious--very light, with a definite gingery bite. The second time I made it, I used the full called-for amount of parsnips and found it a little too heavy for my taste. I really liked the lighter version better. I've also made it with non-fat evaporated milk, and it's still very good. Definitely use the fresh ginger, though--it makes the dish!

Wow! This soup is great, and I don't much care for parsnips. The texture is wonderful and the flavor is complex. This soup is elegant enough for a dinner party--no one would guess how easy it is to make.

Great smooth texture and surprising kick (was it the ginger or the cayenne?) Perfect Fall Soup. Definitely benefits from the crunch of the croutons (toasted nuts would be great as well)

Very good with a surprising kick from the cayenne, (maybe I sprinkled on a little too much). I made this for some friends who I'm sure have never eaten parsnips before. They raved! Make sure to pass croutons around-I use the seasoned variety.

this is great! I put this in my blender on liquify, and did not have to strain it, then added milk instead of half & half, great flavor and is on my repeat list.

Outstanding. Spicy, gingery, a great beginning for a Thai meal. I used whole milk rather than half and half and thought the taste was not compromised.
