Absolutely nauseating. As bad as anything I've ever gleaned from Epicurious. The radiccio/anchovy mix tasted like catfood salad. Oddly enough, my 10-year old daughter (picky) liked it, so go figure...

I didn't follow the directions for the chicken, but I did make the sauce and put it on chicken. It was delicious, I used a LOT less fennel seeds though. Just add a few pinches and taste before you dump all of it in.

Delicious dish. Since chicken is marinated and mustard butter prepared in advance, the final preparation was quick and easy after the guests arrived. Served with polenta which compliments the flavors in this dish.

Fantastic. The flavors combine to create a complexity of sweet and tart with the radicchio capers and anchovies taking just over the top. I have served it to 3 different groups and all have loved it. It is a very stricking dish visually as well.

I would rate this only one fork, but my family thought it deserved two. I made it because I love all the ingredients - anchovies, radicchio, fennel, capers, lemon ... However, it wasn't great. Also, I had to keep the cooked radicchio mixture warm for a few minutes before it was served, and it quickly lost its vibrant color and crunch. Therefore I recommend serving it immediately as the recipe states.

I made this recipe despite its poor reviews because we love radicchio, fennel and capers. I can understand why some people might think this dish is too bitter - because it is bitter. For us that isn't a bad thing - we like it. I thought the flavors all came together well, but something was missing. I'd make it again but somehow tweak it. The chicken was really great - crisp on the outside and the fennel-butter was really nice. The radicchio salad was the disappointment. Maybe some lemon juice at the end to brighten things up? Not sure.

I made the recipe as stated except ommitted the anchovies. I thought the butter and chicken was great, but was not a huge fan of the radicchio/caper salad. It was too bitter to my tastes, but I didn't add any anchovies and everyone I served it to agreed that the anchovies would have provided a counterpoint to the bitterness of the capers and radicchio. The presentation was beautiful--very colorful.

To give the chicken a wonderful golden color, I dredged in flour right before sauting, cook until golden, then added the marinade to the pans. Also, I prefer boneless thighs, they do not get as tough as breasts and can handle bolder flavors.
