Veal scallopine was good but the spring pea coulis was boring and bland -- and I simply cannot think of any way to spice it up or improve it. This recipe is not a keeper.

Not worth it.

I thought this recipe was delicious. I did dredge the veal in seasoned flour and sauted it in butter instead of using the nonstick spray. I think it made the veal more tender than it would have been using the spray.

Making this better. I roasted the asparagus in olive oil. Also made fettuccine with shiktakes, peas from Bon Appetite (didn't use the prosciutto) and used a mushroom noodle. Lovely plate. Also added some heavy cream to the coulis. The Chardonny is the right choice.

Tried this for Mother's Day... I thought it was bland, the veal had no taste of its own, only the overbearing taste of pea-mush. I'd rather have regular old veal scallopine with mushrooms and wine, and all that fun stuff any day - it's a traditional favorite for good reason!

Refreshing spring dinner. I served this at a dinner party and it was a crowd pleaser.

This was wonderful! Great for entertaining as most can be made ahead. The color was beautiful. I served this with a saffron risotto and the yellow color was a great contrast to the pea coulis. The only change I made was to lightly dredge the veal in flour as I like the texture it provides. Definitely try this!
