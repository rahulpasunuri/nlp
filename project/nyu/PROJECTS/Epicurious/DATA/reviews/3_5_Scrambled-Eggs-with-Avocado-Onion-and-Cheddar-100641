I enjoyed this even though I really don't care for avocados. I made this with my 3 year old, it was easy and she even discovered she doesn't like avocados, haha. I would make this and add tomatoes to it, I love tomatoes and eggs together and I would still add the avocado, if I had one on hand,

I added, smoked turkey sausage in rounds, sun-dried tomatoes & artichokes. Served on a slice of German Rye bread. Yum!

Very good. I ate half of my serving before remembering to add the cilantro-- wow, that really made the dish! Also, I'm lactose intolerant so used tofu sour cream instead of cheese and it was still very tasty.

Was looking for an easy breakfast dish this yesterday morning. Had everything but fresh cilantro so used the little frozen squares you can get at Trader Joes and mixed it into the egg mixture. Turned out fine but wound definitely use fresh next time. Served with whole wheat tortillas. Yummy!

Good stuff. Nice variation on scrambled eggs.

Simply delicious. I didn't have any cilantro, so this was my variation: after removing from heat, and before adding the avocado, I stirred in a dollop of sour cream that had been mixed with a generous amount of chopped fresh dill. The added tang worked fabulously.

Simple & easy. I think it's a base recipe for more experimentation. Nice!

This was such a simple recipe, but it tasted so good that I have to give it three forks. I added a mushroom when sauteeing the onion, which gave the eggs a bit more texture.

I love cilantro and avocado, so this dish tasted great to me. I didn't have plain cheddar cheese so I used a shredded blend of white cheeses (provelone, mozzarella, asiago, cheddar) that gave it a simple, mild, cheesy taste. Very easy and quick.

Very good and quick. I'm eating a low-carb diet, and this works very well. A nice variation on scrambled eggs - don't leave out the cilantro, it makes the dish.

This is a great recipe. It doesn't seem like there is any cheese in it. Great flavor and looks yummy too. Don't be fooled by the cilantro, this is not a santa fe breakfast thing.

Simple, but very bland. We served with Pace Picante sauce, and it spiced it up nicely.
