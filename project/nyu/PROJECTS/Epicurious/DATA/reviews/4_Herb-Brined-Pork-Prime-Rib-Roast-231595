This was excellent! I brined only for 3.5 days. I made this Xmas eve along with thyme, apple and roasted onions; shredded Brussels sprouts with bacon and carrots with shallots and thyme. (all from this site). These worked extremely well together. Everyone raved!

Excellent. Our pork prime rib roast was brined for 3 days and we found the meat very tender and moist. Great recipe.

Fabulous recipe. I started brining 5 days ahead and didn't need to do much else except the rub and pop it in the oven. So moist, tender and flavorful.

I made this recipe last week and it was great. I brined the pork for five days. The herb flavoring was throughout the entire roast with a delicious subtle hint from the juniper berries. I served my wife, my son, my daughter and her fiance and these are all some major food critics.

This was the best! I will always do pork this way from now on. Super tender and juicy. I might lessen the sugar a bit as it was a tad too sweet for my personal tastes. So good!

I only had two days to brine it and it was still wonderfully juicy and tender.

Juiciest pork roast I have ever made! I followed the recipe exact, except I continued cooking until it had a nice golden crust on the outside. Turned the oven off and left it alone until about 90 minutes later because our dinner got delayed. I was sure that it would be cold and dry but just the opposite!!! It was perfectlyl cooked, juicy and still very warm inside! I am saving this for company since the roast can sit so long unattended until ready to serve!

I also brined the roast for only 3 days but it was awesome nonetheless. I combined this recipe with that of the sausage-stuffed pork roast also on this site. It was delightful.

Moist and delicious! I could not find thyme sprigs...mine were under a foot of snow! So I used dried rosemary and cracked pepper to roast. Ironically, it is not at all salty! As a matter of fact, I intend to add salt to the top next time. Wonderful!

I don't know how to rate when I alter a recipe. Excellent, even though my butcher did not do a good job frenching the roast. I might try to do it myself next time. Brining is perfect if you only have one oven, practically double the recipe, and are making a ham and several sidedishes that require the oven alongside. Oh yeah, brined before tying together (made space in pots more convenient) and only for about 24 hours. Rubbed on herb paste from Roasted Double Rack of Pork, from this site, the night before.So tasty, guests took leftovers home.

The flavor is amazing although I only brined it for 4 days. One hour in the oven may be too long so next time I will bake for 40 minutes and then go from there. I also served it with Mashed Potatoes with Prosciutto and Parmesan Cheese (from this site) and Two Mushroom Gravy which paired so well.

This is a terrific recipe, but surely the instruction to brine for 5 "days" was intended to be 5 hours?!

Exceptional!! I made this for a dinner party last night and everyone said it was the best pork they ever had. I brined it for 5 days and followed the recipe exactly. However, I did not french the rack or separate the bone & tie it back together since I think the flavor is best when you leave the rack as is. You can always cut away from the bone after it is done. Will try this with pork shoulder and see what happens.

Only brined for 3 days. From now on, this is the ONLY way I will do any kind of pork, even chops, which I will just brine overnight. The flavor and moisture were just beyond compare! Our guests asked for the recipe, and were going to make one for themselves this coming weekend. Hope they invite us!

I only had 3 days to brine and it was plenty of time-also used 1/2 amt of sugar as suggested. Rubbed with a paste of maple syrup and coarsely ground mustard before roasting and made a wine reduction sauce with the sauteed mushroom " pan goobers" from the Wild Mushroom Potato Gratin recipe. (To die for). Served with a domestic Syrah and it was delightful!

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner. Brined pork for 3 days only using bay leaves and peppercorns only. After drying roast rubbed with paste of rosemary and garlic. The gravy I made from pan drippings was fabulous with garlic cream cheese mashed potatoes. A clear winner and definately a keeper. Now going to try on a rolled loin (always a challenge to cook well)!

Exceptional! I prepared this exactly as written, including the brining time. Simple to prepare, with an impressive outcome. In our oven it required an additional 1/2 hour cooking time. I made a tasty gravy by deglazing with wine and chicken broth, and added a bit of butter at the end. Sides were sweet potato puree and green beans with a mustard dill sauce, prepared ahead and served at room temperature.

Very tender! Very flavorful! We used a tenderloin (tied to make it round).

This won rave reviews from all of us! I followed the recipe as printed with the exception of the brining time and used standard bay leaf. I started brining the roast on Wednesday night and removed it on Saturday morning. This pork is so moist,the flavor is excellent and the presentation looks beautiful. We served it with creamy mashed potatoes, gravy and swiss chard. It's a "10" in our book!

I used essentially this brine, but added 2 sprigs of rosemary, two sprigs of sage, a teaspoon of fennel seeds, and used only 1/2 cup of sugar. Brined for two days. It definitely improved the taste and texture of what can be a dry roast. Made a paste of rosemary, garlic, pepper, salt and olive oil and smothered the roast with it in the morning before cooking. Deglazed the pan with white wine and a tablespoon of dijon mustard for a delicious sauce.

I contacted the Spice House in Evanston, IL and was told that by default, most purchased bay leaves are going to be Turkish. Also, my butcher assured me that five days of of brining wasn't necessary, two or three worked fine. I have become a big fan of brining, always prepare the Thanksgiving Turkey this way following the Martha S. recipe. Have made this roast once and will be serving it again for Easter. Thank you B.A. and thank you other reviewers!!

FANTASTIC! Everyone is begging for the recipe!

I had this dish originally at Zuni Cafe so was intrigued when the chef shared it in Bon Appetit! Didn't find the boned pork roast, so I used a boneless pork roast. I also doubled the herb topping because it is so delicious! I used regular bay leaves. Served it with roasted winter root vegetables and a mixed leaf salad. Easy to make! I think it'll be a family favorite.

Pork was extremely moist and flavorful. Not sure where to find Turkish Bay Leaves, but Florida Bay worked fine.

We are from a small northwest Iowa town so we have all kinds of pork. I saw this recipe in my Bon Appe'tit magazine and thought I had to try it. The recipe was very easy and delicious. All I had was a boneless loin. It would have been better if I had a bone-in loin to add the flavor of the bone. I didn't have Turkish bay leaves so I used regular bay leaves.
