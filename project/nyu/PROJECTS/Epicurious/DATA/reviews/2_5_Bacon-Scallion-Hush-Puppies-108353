I made this recipe without the scallions. Other than that I stuck to the numbers though. They turned out really dry and not at all as sweet as the hush puppies i'm used to. I would suggest adding some sugar to the recipe for sure and doing something to prevent dryness.

I loved the flavor of these, but I agree with others; I've been eating hush puppies my whole life and these a little dry. A bit more milk and oil next time.

Easy recipe to make. To keep the hush puppies from being too dense, I separated the egg and whipped the whites which I folded in last. I also added a little sugar. They were delicious!

Two words... "Oh Man". This is by far the best hush puppy recipe I've ever used. It's my favorite comfort food - I make them once a year and tonight's the night. This is it - I've stopped looking. If yours come out like lead, then check the date on your baking powder. This was perfect. Just remember, a hush puppy is NOT a corn fritter - they're denser and more grainy.

I wasn't impressed with these. I also used a Fry Daddy but thought they were heavy and non-descript.
