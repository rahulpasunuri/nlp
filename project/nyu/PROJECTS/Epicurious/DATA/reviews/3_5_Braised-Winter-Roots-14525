For those of you out there that don't like fennel (I do, but I forgot to add it!), this comes out really well without the fennel as well. It's a great winter vegetable recipe and I look forward to trying it with fennel. Also, I used 1/3 olive oil and 2/3 butter and it still tastes really rich and wonderful.

Enjoyed this with the Beef Tenderloin with roasted shallots, bacon and port recipie also found on this site. They went together perfectly. I would replace some of the butter w/ non-stick spray, but otherwise it was wonderful.
