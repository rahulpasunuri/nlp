Good cake, added choc chips just before cooking, and added coffee granules to hot water. Fizzed up nicely. Its a very wet batter, was not expecting that, and took about 40 minutes to cook. I used self raising flour and found it made the cake very light and fluffy. Beautifully chocolately. Finished with whipped cream and fresh strawberries. YUMMMM

super quick, super easy. Other reviewers are being way too snotty about this recipe. I don't completely fault them, though, because this recipe as originally published was meant to capture two versions of mom's homemade chocolate cake. It's very church basement potluck and very good! Slather it with cooked vanilla frosting (cooked milk/flour mixture as base then lots of butter and powdered sugar) like you'll see with some red velvet cake recipes. Easy, fast, yummy. Gonna make one now.

To the last reviewer, to make it more fluffy, I seperated the eggs, and after adding the yolks, I folded in the whites which I had whipped. I still thought the cake was a little pedestrian, but the texture was great.

Followed the recipe exactly. I found that the cake a bit too moist for my liking. It wasn't as "fluffy" enough. We don't like our cakes too sweet but as mentioned in other postings I did find it a little bland . We used a bundt and baked it an additional 5 minutes longer. Does anyone have a suggestion on how to make it more fluffy?

This recipe makes chocolate cake mixes obsolete, it is just as easy and just as good if not better. I agree it is nor a formal cake, and I don't think it would work as a layer cake, but it's pretty darn good and would work very well for a casual meal, picnic, barbecue, or just family. It is very moist. To counter the issues of blandness, I added 1 tbsp of instant espresso powder to the baking soda before pouring in the boiling water--and yes, it still bubbles up. The cake tasted like deep chocolate, not like coffee. I made it in a Bundt pan, added 5-6 minutes to the cooking time. I was able to easily remove the cake from the pan after about 40 minutes of cooling on a rack, cake was still very slightly warm. For the instructions to grease and flour the pan, use cocoa powder rather than flour, and you won't have any white streaks on the cake. I made a simple glaze: heat 1/2 cup of heavy cream to where it is just below boiling (surface will shimmer), remove from heat and stir in 1 small bag semisweet chocolate chips, stir until smooth. If too thick, add a little more cream. Drizzle warm glaze over still-warm cake.

I love this cake. I've made it --oh, probably ten times since it was published last February. Not to sound too "MARTHA", but it is the most perfect cake to serve your kids when they come home from school -- all it needs is a simple dusting of powdered sugar. No, it's not fancy, and I wouldn't serve it to company, but it is just perfect for a cold winter afternoon at home with your kiddos.

I can't believe that before me, 100% of the people said they would make this again. The cake was so bland! There are millions of other chocolate cakes that I would make before using this recipe again.

I love this chocolate cake! It's fast, easy and the ingredients are usually available in my kitchen. I make it in a Bundt pan and add 5-10 minutes baking time.

After reading some of the reviews that said it was somewhat bland, I added a few handfulls of chocolate chips to make the texture more interesting and improve the taste. What a hit. It was especially good warmed in the microwave with vanilla ice cream. It wasn't an amazing cake but very quick and very easy. The bubbles that are created from mixing the ingredients are also very entertaining for kids, or the easily amused (like me).

My only comment about the recipe is that the directions said that the baking soda/water solution would bubble. It did not.

This was a nice cake in that all of the ingredients are very basic, and ones you're likely to have on hand. The texture was nice, but the flavor...just kind of blah. But I would make it again, as it is quick and easy.

Wow - so good AND easy. I'll never buy a boxed cake mix again.

I made this on a whim one afternoon when my three year old and I were looking for something to do. What a cinch...I don't consider myself to be a very good baker but even I couldn't mess this up. I put a homemade chocolate frosting on it, which was pretty tasty but the cake didn't really need it. This isn't the recipe I would serve to company but if you want to please your kids with a homemade afterschool snack, this is a good choice!
