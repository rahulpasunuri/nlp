The butter helps the curd to set up as do the yolks. It also gives the curd a more mellow flavor.

I think it's the butter that makes it a curd rather than a custard.

I won't fork this recipe, as I haven't tried it yet, but it resembles a restaurant recipe I used years ago, with the exception of the butter. With an extra yolk, is the butter even necessary?
