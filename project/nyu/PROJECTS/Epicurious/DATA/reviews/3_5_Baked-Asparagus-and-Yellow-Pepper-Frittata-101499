Served at Easter brunch. Very favorable reviews. Made recipe without modification, and found that as is it was a nice mix of textures and flavors. It doesn't need cheese to stand on its own, but it could be a nice addition if you felt the need to add your own touch.

I served this along with Hell's Kitchen's Bison sausage. Yum! Will make again. I don't give many four fork ratings. Has to be over the top.

Really great brunch dish. Took the tip from another reviewer and just added the asparagus to the pepper mixture about 1/2 way through the cooking time. Consistency came out right so I don't think you need to bother with the blanching step. I also used red instead of yellow peppers (it's what I had) and instead of shallots & scallions, added a thinly sliced leek to the peppers. Added some freshly grated asiago to the egg mixture and sprinkled a little bit on top as well. Great recipe, will definitely make again!

This is a staple brunch recipe in our home bc my husband does not eat cheese and it's hard to find egg dishes without cheese. It takes a little prep work but it gets rave reviews all the time.

I made this for a bbq dinner, for a vegetarian friend, and it was great- everyone had some. I couldn't get yellow bells, so I used red, didn't have as much asparagus as it called for, but the colors and flavors were great. The ratio of veggies to egg were right on, and I think you could successfully make a lot of variations in ingredients.

I've made this frittata with milk (probably 2%, which is what I usually have on hand). Soy milk should be fine. I'm not sure almond milk would work, flavor-wise.

Has anyone made this frittata with soy or almond milk instead of heavy cream?

I didn't bother to blanch the asparagus, just sauteed everything in a pan first. I added a red onion and a bunch of halved grape tomatoes and combined the still hot vegetables with the egg mixture so nothing would sink to the bottom. I sprinkled on some crumbled goat cheese just over the top just before baking. People loved it at my sister's baby shower.

Well it certainly smelled great while it was cooking. Perhaps I should have left it in the oven. I was sooo disappointed!! Far too much asparagus and it had no flavor. I may try to make it again, on a much smaller scale, and add additional seasonings to see if I can come up with a keeper.

This was a HUGE hit at a recent brunch. Made some changes: used only 1 lb of asparagus, plus sauteed two chopped leeks with the peppers and shallots and added in shredded Asiago cheese--stirred some into the egg mixture, then sprinkled some on top before baking. Everyone raved! As for reheating, i just microwaved it for about 90 secs and had it for lunch the next day and it was STILL delicious.

I have made this dish more times than I can count and it's a favorite of all who try it. My husband does not eat cheese, so this is one of the few "brunch casseroles" he can enjoy. It's heavy on the veggies which I think makes it great.

A huge success at yesterday's brunch and the favorite of the egg dishes for all.

I made a half recipe of this as directed, though i cooked the asparagus longer because it was thicker. Also used fat free half and half and broiled the top briefly at the end. Very tastey, a good vegetarian entry. My menu included Trader Joe's Tomato-Red Pepper soup and Rachel Ray's Portobello Mushroom Salad. My husband dripped some soup on the top of his frittata and added hot sauce- that was yummy!

I've made this dish almost every year for Easter or Mother's day brunch and it's always a success. I was surprised at how tasty it was with almost no herbs, or spices. The combination of the veggies gives it so much flavor. I never even thought to add any cheese. It's a great make ahead dish and everyone has seconds.

Great. I made half the recipe. Exchanged a couple of vegetables and used goat cheese instead of cream.. We like more spice so added a little Chipotle spice. Really good.

Good recipe. I should have read the reviews first because I can see where some cheese would make this a 4 fork recipe. I did not use zucchini. This is a very simple recipe to put together and it would be very transportable.

I've varied the vegetables for this dish according to what's in season, and it's always good. Regarding cheese, though: one of the things I particularly like about this recipe is that it doesn't have cheese and is therefore lighter but has great flavor. I've also always used regular milk instead of cream, and the results are great!

This was a perfect make ahead dish for an Easter Brunch. I read all of the reviews here and made these changes. I decreased asparagus (to about 2 cups chopped). I decreased yellow pepper but in retrospect that was a bad decision. I deleted the zucchini and scallions and increased shallots to 4. I sauteed the asparagus with the yellow pepper, shallots and butter. I added salt and pepper at this time. I increased eggs to 12 and cream to 3/4 a cup. I added parmesan on top. I think adding tomatoes on top some time later in the baking time might be a nice addition. I plan to make this dish next month for a baby shower brunch. It is a fabulous and simple brunch dish.

Rating: 3
To make the egg stand out more (I am an egg-loving kind of person), I'd say the veggies could be reduced a bit. I think I would also add some spice to it next time, but I'm not quite sure what...I used this same basic recipe but added spinach and maple sausage and it came out wonderfully.

What a pleasant and tasty change from the typical bread/ham/cheese/eggs brunch casserole. I carefully read through the reviews and made these changes: cut asparagus into 1" pieces; deleted zucchini and replaced with mushrooms; increased eggs to 12; added 1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg and 2 cloves grated garlic; added 3/4 cup grated asiago cheese to egg mixture; topped with sliced tomatoes and additional asiago. Served for brunch last weekend and the pan was literally licked clean! Highly recommend this for an out-of-the-ordinary brunch dish.

Chose this recipe as a take-off point for using up Easter leftovers. I had crisp-tender asparagus, scallions and shallots, but none of the other veggies. Added some chopped up bits of our Greek lamb roast to the mixture. The entire family enjoyed the end result and the teenagers went back for seconds. Don't think it needed cheese as previous reviewers have suggested.

Rating: 2
This dish is beautiful in presentation and the veggies are great but the flavor was boring. The second time I made it , I added bacon and hot sauce but that didn't help much. If I make it again, I will add sausage and more hot sauce. I would also suggest leaving the zuchini in large chunks-better flavor. Do not overcook this recipe!

I LOVE this recipe! It is a perfect bruch entree - I made it for my family on Easter and everyone raved about it! And it was easy and and can be prepared ahead of time so you don't have to cook everything at the last minute.

I have made this 2 times and altered it each time. The most recent variation was my favorite. I too added 1/4 tsp. cayenne, 2 garlic cloves, and asiago cheese. I substituted baby bella mushrooms for the zucchini, red peppers for the yellow and white asparagus for the traditional green. The suggestion to top with black bean salsa was a great idea. Also great the next day!

Rating: 3
This recipe is good because it can be made ahead of time. However, it definitely needs garlic, cheese and either cayenne pepper or minced chili peppers. It also needs at least 12 eggs. I would add more shallots than called for as well and experiment with the kinds of vegetables and herbs you throw in. Mushrooms are a great addition. However, what made it really good, was heating it up before serving (a must) and topping it with sour cream (I used fat-free) and a really good salsa (I used a black bean and corn). That turned it from okay to great. No need for heavy cream either. This can be a low-fat and healthy dish by using milk or even fat-free half and half.

I made this a day ahead and it reheated very well. The vegetables were still crisp and it looked great. The flavor was fantastic too, but I think that was due to the changes I made. I read the reviews about this being bland so I mixed in 5 ounces of grated asiago cheese and sprinkled some across the top of the dish. I also added an additional 1/4 cup of cream. It tasted really wonderfully and I will definitely make this again!

We had this as a light meal with a salad and bread last night. Following the advice of other reviewers and thinking it might be bland I added about a 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper to the egg mixture.

I also sauteed my asparagus with the other vegs rather than blanching and it was good. I ended up using 15 eggs for mine because it was a bit too dense for me the other way. I did add gruyere cheese to the top prior to baking and served it with homemade salsa.

Ok, my version - asparagus, sauteed red (not garrish-looking at all!) and yellow bell peppers, sauteed portobellas, scallions, shallots, garlic, DRIED basil and a pinch of tarragon, yes tarragon! Melt a wedge of St. Andre's (minus the rind)and blend with a bit of the heavy creme to liquify and make in blendable with the egg mixture. Definitely 12 eggs! Top with thinly sliced tomatos and crumbled feta. Gorgeous presentation and most yummy! Enjoy!!

I made this for a potluck brunch, and people liked it. I followed many of the reviewer suggestions: used 12 vs 10 eggs, added both feta and bits of brie (no rind) to egg mixture, rather than blanching asparagus I sauteed it with the other veg., made a night ahead and reheated at the brunch. The only thing I would change next time is I think I would add some sundried tomatoes and feta to the top before baking. It served 12 along with other brunch items. Give it a try.

I halved the recipe using 6 eggs and adding a handful of grated swiss cheese on top a few minutes before it was done. My husband loved it, my 11 year old says it's good but he wouldn't want to eat it alone for a whole meal, and I thought it was good but a little on the bland side. Maybe next time I'll try feta instead of swiss on top, and add a little extra black pepper.

Omitted zuchinni and used mushrooms as suggested by many. Added some reduced fat feta to the egg mixture. Make sure you use the correct size dish. I mistook my 18X9X2 for the 13X9X2 and it really affected the thickness and texture of the eggs. I will do this again with the right dish because all the flavors are definitely worth your while. Definitely top with tomatoes and Parmesan. YUM!

Beautiful and tasty dish. Didn't waste my time on the blanching the asparagus---just sauteed them lightly with the shallots and peppers. Followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and cut down on the veggies ratio. Also used 12 eggs and 1% milk instead of cream. Added 1/2 cup grated parmesan. Made this ahead of time the night before, so all I had to do on Easter morning was put it in the oven. Left-overs (if there are any) will be great for dinner with a salad.

Rave reviews on this one. I was disappointed there wasn't more leftover! Served 8 as a brunch savory accompanied by a baked french toast dish and a ham. I added a half cup of grated cheddar to the mixture and sprinkled just a couple of tablespoons of parmesan on top before baking. I don't see how anyone could call this dish bland. I thought the shallots really kicked it up. Maybe I used too many?!?!? I used red peppers (because I had them), but will use yellow next time. Didn't need the constrast in color - in fact, it looked kind of garish!!

I thought this was very good. But, like everyone else, I did vary it some. I left out the peppers and included fresh corn and sauted portabellos instead. And I did add some brie with the rind removed. This was an excellent brunch dish and was easy to make, and was convenient for a large group.

Very good side dish, but I added crumbled feta cheese as a topping for each serving. Without the flavor of the cheese this was very bland. With the feta, it was wonderful!

Prepared this for a catered brunch for 30 last week with good results. Since it is a frittata the egg mixture is not necessarily supposed to completely cover the vegetables. However, I agree the recipe as written will probably only serve 8 - or increase the egg/cream for a thicker product. All in all this looked very nice on the buffet and was quite tasty. I also topped with some freshly grated Romano cheese and served with green and yellow wax bean marinated salad, chive biscuits and a strawberry lemon trifle (adapted from the one using raspberries on this site).

This recipe was a good start. I made it for a brunch for my family this sunday. The other reviews were helpful in modifying the recipe. I used 12 eggs instead of 10; milk instead of cream; I roasted the peppers and asparagus; and I sauteed portobello mushrooms with the butter and shallots. I left out the zucchini and I also included a wedge of melted brie with the rind cut off which i mushed into the eggs before baking. It was delicious and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.

Thanks to all the other reviewers, I was off to a roaring start, using more eggs and half and half instead of cream. I added tangy chevre to the eggs, some ham, celantro instead of parsley, a few fresh basil leaves, and a bunch of mixed mushrooms sauteed first in butter. (no zucchini). Used both shallots and red onion (didn't have scallions). Also, some crushed red chili pepper and powdered coriander gave a little kick. As a last minute color inspiration, I circled the top with tiny cherry tomatoes (which could also have been thin slices of large tomatoes). They crusted beautifully in the oven. Topped it with parmegiano reggiano for some additional tang five minutes before end of baking. Great looking & tasty, it impressed a club of sophisticated wine-drinking foodies. You can't go wrong here.

This is a good, basic recipe, but requires some serious "doctoring"...I use 12 eggs and add Tabasco, herbed feta & Romano cheeses, garlic and sliced mushrooms in addition to the listed ingredients (I don't add the zucchini).

It's also great with crumbled goat cheese.

I was looking for a different brunch idea and found this recipe. I am not a yellow pepper fam so I left them out and the recipe was still terrific! Everyone at brunch said it was wonderful and I will definitely make it again. I used 11 eggs and added parmesian to the top before cooking. Also, one large shallot seemed to be enough. I served with fresh cheese biscuits, sausage, bacon, fruit salad, yogurt and granola. No one left hungry! Enjoy.

I, too, made this for an Easter Brunch and thought it was delicious. It is definitely more of a VEGETABLE dish than an egg dish since the veggies play such a prominent role. Two yellow bell peppers seemed a bit excessive to me but perhaps mine were just too large. Will definitely make it again. I served it with the accompanying Gourmet menu which included ham and cheese biscuits and salmon. So elegant and delicious.

This dish worked well as part of a mother's day brunch. I used 12 eggs, which I would do again next time.

Very tasty dish which was well-received by my fellow-brunchers. However, it would be a bit of a stretch to feed 12 with this recipe, if this was the main savoury item.

This was a delicious and easy recipe. I only used 10 eggs, not 12 like others did, and it was fine. I would recommend NOT cutting all the vegetables on the diagonal; what a waste of time. I did it, and the aesthetic appeal was nil. I might omit the cream and add some cheese instead the next time.

This was absolutely delicious! I, too, used 12 eggs instead of 10, and also added thyme and a sprinkling of Parmesan.

I was looking for a recipe that could be made ahead of time to serve to a very special couple. I found this recipe and I was (as they were) blown away. I prepared all the vegetables the night before and then in the morning all I had to do was beat the eggs, cream, s & p, combine with the vegetables and bake. I did use 12 eggs (plus a little more cream) and one red and one yellow pepper (for addtional color and it was beautiful). I think I may try it with egg substitute and milk sometime in the future.

Excellent dish, very well received at our monthly breakfast meeting. I used 12 jumbo eggs, red peppers (for the color contrast) and light cream, and added a little thyme to it and sprinkled parmesan over the top. I forgot the parsley, but didn't miss it. I sauteed the veggies and let them sit overnight, then added them to the eggs in the morning so I could bake it in the morning before the meeting. I will definitely make this again and again! (I also made another frittata with 12 eggs and added just diced tomatoes and the "Sunny Paris seasoning" from Penzey's - it was excellent as well. These two frittatas complimented each other very well.) Got rave reviews from all 15 guests.

We liked this dish very much. It is both delicious as well as convenient to make before brunch guests arrive, leaving more time for other last minute tasks. The left-overs were also terrific the next day in our lunches!

I made this as part of a brunch for a very "particular" group and they loved it! I agree with the suggestions of using red peppers and using 12 eggs instead of 10. You can make this the day before and reheat!

I made this dish the night before and warmed it up the following morning.All of my guests, including a professional chef, raved about it. The one change I did make was that I used 12 eggs instead of 10 and added some extra cream. Ten eggs did not look like it was going to be enough to cover the vegetables.

I enjoyed this very much. I did use different color peppers in it (orange and red) I made it for my son's confirmation brunch. It was a hit. I served it with a variety of muffins and fruit.

I took this dish to a morning picnic and recieved many favorable comments. Although a bit time consuming, it's well worth it. I substituted one red bell pepper for one of the yellow peppers for a more interesting color combination. Highly recommend.

A springy and delicious way of starting a late sunday. I made it accompanied with a strong-dressing salad, and it was a hit. Of five, four asked for the recipe (the other one saw me preparing it)

Great brunch dish, easy to take along and visually pleasing.
