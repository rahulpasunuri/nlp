Excellent. Cooked down the marinade after removing chicken from marinade and poured over roasted chicken before spooning salsa on top. Salsa is a must. Used chicken breasts. They turned out perfectly tender. Will make again. Served with rice. Great way to use seasonal plums.

The marinade is wonderful, and the chicken legs, all by themselves, are worth doing. The plum chili salsa is also delicious in its own right. The problem I have with this dish is that you lose the wonderful flavor of the marinade if you eat the salsa and the chicken in one bite--and I'm used to eating salsa that way, as a condiment. The salsa definitely dominates. So I ate them in separate bites, and that was ok. This dish made me a fan of plums--well, at least of plum salsa, and I'm sure the salsa would pair with with pork and maybe whitefish. I'm going to experiment, because I really loved it.

Delicious. I served the salsa with rice. It was a terrific meal.

Great marinade! We used it on boneless skin-on chicken breasts on Sunday, and on pork chops on Monday.

Awesome. I'm shocked at how few are the reviews on this recipe. I simply made the marinade and then roasted the chicken in an excess of it while making the salsa to accompany. So sweet, sour, and savory. One of the best (and more interesting) chicken recipes on this website. Would recommend slightly increasing the mint and cilantro in the salsa, but otherwise quite perfect as is (note: I omitted the sesame oil). Red Jacket Orchard plums in season perhaps took this over the top for me.

I can't wait for plum season! I have made this several times using boneless skinless chicken thighs with most fat removed. Always had dinner guests, and all were thrilled by the unique taste of the cool plum salsa with the melt-in-mouth chicken. Made in oven and on grill, best in the oven. I add a little plum wine because I love OVER THE TOP FOOD !

Absolutely phenomenal! I've never reviewed anything before but felt I had to with this recipe.

OUT of this WORLD; a reason to look forward to plum season! Use only 2 large plums in the marinade, and increase the salsa by half! Marinate boneless, skinless thighs 24 hours; cook as directed for melt- in-your-mouth bliss, or grill indirect for BBQ lovers. Other tweaks: add the zest of the orange to the marinade, omit the sugar if grilling.

Since it was 111* today I grilled instead of roasting. It worked out just fine. The salsa was the best part.

Wow! And I have to tell you I'm stingy with the forks. I marinated the chicken for 24 hours and the marinade really did permeate the meat. I used breasts instead of legs because I think it's easier to eat with the salsa that way. After I took the chicken out of the marinade I boiled and then strained it to serve as a sauce. I made a side of quinoa and basmati pilaf with anise seed and it was all just out of this world! Not only would I make it again I'm going to make it again this weekend. Fabulous!

I agree with previous reviewers that the marinade didn't add much flavor. However, the salsa was delicious with the chicken!

This dish was devoured in a hurricane of oohs and aahhhs. The salsa should be cold, right out of the fridge, and spooned on to hot chicken; the contrast in texture, flavor & temerature is breathtaking! A party for your tastebuds. I reserved additional marinade and placed chicken in a small puddle of cold marinade first, then put salsa on top. Faboo!

This recipe was great- the salsa was very good- but I think I might have goofed because I was serving this later on in a dinner party- so I covered the meat in the oven with the salsa and let it sit for a while- and maybe the whole contrast of this is suspose to be the cool salsa and the warm meat? It was great- but not AMAZING!

Both my husband and I really enjoyed this recipe and agreed that it is good enough to serve guests. We will definitely make this again.

This dish is absolutely fabulous! It's a perfect recipe for when plums are ripe and practically falling off the tree. The salsa was the probably the best I've ever had. Also, I used chicken breasts cut in half instead of chicken legs. It turned out just fine. SUPERB!!

Wonderful! I made this for a friend's birthday dinner, and people devoured it! Very tasty and different. The plums and chili are such a neat combination. I used chicken pieces instead of just legs, and I grilled them on the BBQ. The flavor was sooooo good! The salas is a winner, too. Make sure you use the freshest plums you can find, you won't be sorry! I served with Chateau Ste. Michelle Johannisburg Riesling, a nice combination.

I gave it 3 stars due to the 2 I give the salsa and the 4 I give the sauce. I halved the sauce because I only had 4 chicken legs, but will make more sauce the next time. I marinated them overnight and only turned them in the morning. They were delicious, but instead of the salsa, next time, I will serve with additional sauce. The salsa definitely needs the sauce mixed in and is just okay, in our opinion.

As did the previous reviewer I too used a boneless pork loin roast. I pricked it several times on each side with a paring knife then marinated it overnight before roasting. The flavors soaked throughout the roast. I basted it several times with the remaining marinade. Served it with the plum-chili salsa, a simple rice pilaf, and the Asparagus with lemon and garlic that can also be found on this site. Dinner was enjoyed by all. I think that I'll stick with the pork in place of the chicken legs.

I do drop-off catering, and used this recipe for a pan-asian dinner. I substituted pork tenderloin for the chicken, and my clients are raving about how good it was. Very easy and beautiful.

I made this without the salsa. The chicken was great, but a bit "purple." Also, I'll make sure next time to boil down the marinade BEFORE baking the chicken. I boiled it down as the chicken was cooking (due to time constraints)and used it just as a nice PURPLE sauce.

Would use less mint next time and chicken breasts.
