Great soup. It has lots of flavor and is very easy to make. It's a nice comfort soup even for us that live in warmer weather such as Florida. The Kielbasa adds so much flavor. I used cabbage instead of kale because I had a hard time cooking the kale until it got soft the first time I made this soup. Otherwise no problems.

As many have posted, this is a great starter to an incredible dish! I substituted hot italian sausage, which infused the broth with a hint of spice. Also added carrots, onion, extra garlic, and a cup of wine to the sausage saute. Used one can cannellini and one can navy beans, as thats what I had on hand. Also added a bay leaf and substituted kale for the escarole. This soup is absolutely amazing! I made extra to freeze but can't stop picking at it as it cools! Cannot wait to make this again with whatever happens to be in the cupboard at the time!

I made this as a prelude to a big Italian feast for friends. It got ooos and aaahs from allincluding myself. This opening act was loved by my guests as much as my Aunt Nancy's meat sauceand Aunt Nancy was no slouch in the kitchen. The one thing I did was to substitute sweet Italian sausage for the kielbasa. It just doesn't make any sense to put polish sausage in an Italian classic such as this.

Not a keeper. Like many here, I substituted Italian sausage for the kielbasa. It seemed a better match for the other ingredients. And I cooked my own white beans instead of using canned. The soup was just not very flavorful. It did improve the next day, but I wouldn't bother making it again.

I made this for a Super Bowl Party and this was the crowd favorite. Add me to the list of people who used Italian Sausage and regular, not low-salt chicken broth. I will make this again and again. It's really great.

This was very good, and very filling. I used extra broth and added some starina pasta, and garlic pork sausage from Whole Foods. I agree with others, this is a good base recipe with lots of options. I think the flavor of the sausage is essential to blending all the other flavors. Bland sausage, and some precooked sausages may not do this soup justice, but can be used if the cook addes his/her own spices to taste.

The ingredients attracted me to this recipe. I'm not an experienced cook, but it was hard for me to believe that a soup could be made after simmering for 20 minutes. My suspicions were confirmed: This recipe does not meld. All the few ingredients can be tasted separately, especially the canned chicken broth. Canned soup is better.

I just had my first bowl of this and it was very, very good! Easy too! I used Whole Foods chicken sausage with roasted red peppers instead, but otherwise, stuck to the recipe. Finished off with a handful of chopped fresh parsley. I bet it will be excellent tomorrow after the flavors really blend!

I'm a real soup lover and in cold weather make some kind of soup weekly. I've added many wonderful recipes from this site to my repertoire, and when I consider time and effort vs. flavor, this is my favorite. It's so easy and so wonderful. I also make the changes suggested in many of the other reviews. I make it with sweet italian turkey sausage and kale. I always add carrots. Because it's so quick cooking the quality of the broth is very important, and as others have said, make sure you use low salt. Especially when you add the parmesan, it just gets way too salty otherwise. I also often add a big handful of alphabet noodles for the kids. The noodles are small enough that the cook in the short time that the soup is cooking. You're in for a treat, enjoy!

Excellent recipe! I used two cans of beans (one mashed, one whole) and it was delicious. Very simple, but very satisfying. Couldn't wait for leftovers the next day.

yum! One key point is the low salt broth, if you use regular you will be very unhappy (and pretty thirsty)

I made a few changes so I'm not going to rate. But with the changes I thought it was awesome!!! I used Italian sausage instead and added potatoes. Brought it to a family dinner and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I didn't need to add the oil or salt and pepper had lots of flavor on its own. Delicious!

This is an easy, flavorful, hearty soup perfect for chilly autumn and winter nights. I made just a couple modifications which worked very well: I doubled the beans as Amy wisely suggested, increased the garlic, and used Italian turkey sausage removed from the casing, which I browned with the garlic. Don't be afraid to use LOTS of escarole. This makes a quick, healthy and delicious meal when served with some crusty bread and a salad; we'll be making it often.

This is a delicious and easy soup! I used turkey kielbasa to cut the fat and added carrots, which added nice color and flavor. like some others, i used kale as i could not find escarole. otherwise i did everything according to the recipe -- very flavorful and comforting soup!

Used sweet italian sausage. Sicilian boyfriend took it out of the fridge when he got home, put a spoon in & his eyes lit up. Very impressed.

This soup is wonderful, how did I ever live without it? I used 1/2 kielbasa, 1/2 sweet Italian sausage & the flavor was perfect. My husband & I make a meal out of it a couple times a month. Add more beans for a more hearty soup & make extra, it will go fast!

My boss made this soup a couple of years ago and I loved it except for the sausage, so when I made it myself I used Italian Sausage instead. OH MY GOODNESS!!! It was amazing. I made it for a huge family dinner with 12 guests and everybody raved about it, and they asked me to make it with Thanksgiving dinner this year so I am. I absolutely love this soup and have recommended it many, many times.

This soup was wonderful,just what we needed on a cold night. We love garlic so I added a few more cloves, and another can of beans. It was extremely easy.Fresh cheese is a must.

Take some cues from the White Bean and Escarole Soup with Garlic, and improvise. I tried sausage with basil and tomato, another time with sun-dried tomatoes and feta cheese. More garlic, less garlic, a sprinkle of other dried herbs or not, flavored canned tomatoes--more, or less. Canned white beans, maybe or not, some pasta. Given all the choices in my repertoir, hubby chose "escarole soup." There are no mistakes with this soup. Filling and satisfying.

What a fabulous soup! I had such a craving for it and it turned out marvelously and with little effort. It was nothing to chop the kielbasa sausage, garlic and grate the Parmesan (always use freshly grated Parmesan or you really cheat yourself in the end). I only made a few changes. I wanted a real "beanie" soup, so I used 3 cans of cannellini instead of one (they're so small!) To make up for all the extra beans, I went ahead and sautee'ed the entire head of minced garlic and the broth itself was fabulous (trust me, the garlic wasn't too overpowering). The turkey kielbasa was perfect and lower in fat than most other sausages. The large head of escarole wilts perfectly in the soup. And instead of the canned soup, I just made 7 cups of broth in my microwave using some chicken bouillon cubes, which worked lovely. At the end, I drizzled about a tablespoon of olive oil over the soup and stirred it in. Always remember to season to taste at the end. The FRESHLY grated parmesan cheese is a must! The next time, I'd consider sauteeing diced carrots with the garlic just for the color. I even got a little creative with my second bowl of soup and toasted a slice of bread, cut off the bread ends to make it look pretty, put the toasted square in the middle of my bowl of hot soup and THEN melted some parmesan cheese on top of all that (sorta French Onion Soup style?). It was simply marvelous. So marvelous that even my 6 and 4 y/o daughters requested that I put some of the soup in their lunch boxes the next day! :) So, you know it's a hit when that happens. Even hubby said that he'd never tasted a better bean soup -- restaurant or otherwise. So, please don't miss out on this wonderful quick & easy soup. You won't be disappointed. This definitely goes in the "fav" file. (P.S. Let me know in your reviews if this lengthy review helped you!) Bon Appetit!

This soup is great. I love escarole & bean and the kielbasa was just an extra bonus flavor. I forgot the parmesan, but I'll definitely try it next time.

This is a simple, hearty soup that lends itself to many variations. I used spinach instead of escarole, and used turkey kielbasa, which isn't as flavorful as the real thing, so I added a teaspoon and a half of dried sage, and a pinch each of red pepper flakes and oregano to spice it up a bit. I also let it simmer an extra 15 minutes to bring out all the flavors. Healthy and filling without being overbearing.

This was a perfect, cozy soup to make...very enjoyable! I added some black pepper and some Parmesan cheese to my bowl of soup...very good! And also very easy to make. Hearty, but not really heavy soup.
