Wonderful! After baking and cooling, added Tony's (if you have to ask...), a few dashes of Tabasco for a kick, a few dashes of basaltic vinegar, and three tablespoons of sugar. Also used half veggie stock and half water to get it to the right consistency, then topped it with goat cheese. Will definitely be making this one again!

I used fresh tomotoes since I have a lot of them right now from my CSA farm. I used 2 red Italian frying peppers and a jalapeno which I removed the seeds from, along with the onions and garlic. I roasted the veggies and then put it all in the blender with a couple of cups of chicken broth. I added a chiffonade of several fresh basil leaves after blending. I topped it with sour cream, but I like the idea of topping it with goat cheese. I will definitely make it again and try that next time.

Excellent, even without fresh peppers or tomatoes! I really did not expect this soup to be as intensely earthy and flavorful as it was. Along with the onion and garlic, I roasted all the whole tomatoes from a 35 oz. can instead of fresh (they took not nearly as long as the recipe predicted to get charred), and I used three pre-roasted jarred red peppers. After roasting, I pureed all the vegetables and fruits in the blender along with the thyme, some black pepper, a few leaves of fresh basil, 1 1/2 c. homemade chicken stock and maybe 3/4 c. of the thick juice from the canned tomatoes. And that was it. Seriously superb -- when I tasted it from the blender, I said aloud to myself, "Christ, is that good!" I recommend topping the soup with croutons (I had leftovers from some I'd made the other day) and a little feta or pesto. I would say that the recipe as I adapted it yielded only about three medium-sized servings, though. This will become a wintertime-but-wishing-it-were-summertime staple, I suspect.

Scrumptious. Used whole canned tomatoes that I halved and deseeded, a red and orange pepper, large onion, 5 big cloves garlic, and after they were roasted, added in the liquid I had left over from beef burgundy to thin it, along with some of the reserved tomato juices. Didn't need cheese or anything...was completely divine and can't wait for lunch so I can have the leftovers!

I roasted a can of San marzanos instead of fresh tomatoes. Added a little balsamic to the roasting. Then roasted at 400 for 40 minutes. I then pureed it with Swanson's Chicken stock and added fresh basil and served it warm with Serrano Creme (also from Epicuious) Delish!!

Delicious! Left out the thyme and served with a dollop of pesto.

This is very good, but a similar recipe that I used calls for vegetable broth (instead of the water) and 3/4 C. wine. I liked the result better.

I followed the recipe exactly, except for substituting crumbled goat cheese for ricotta (as did many other reviewers). Also, I had some leftover roasted vegetable stock, so I used a little of that and a little bit of water to thin it. I served it hot. It was great - a wonderful appetizer for a special dinner!

I have made this soup many times. It is extremely easy, has excellent flavor and is very diet. I strongly recommend substituting goat cheese for the ricotta when serving. I also recommend adding 2 tablespoons per serving (when serving hot) of a red pepper, onion, garlic and red jalapeno pepper mixture. I chop these (2 peppers, 1 onion, 4 garlic cloves, 1 jalapeno) and pan brown them in a little olive oil - scrumptious and adds some nice chewable items to every spoon. The jalapeno flavor also helps give the soup a spicy taste. Highly recommended!

This was a great soup, especially taking advantage of local tomatoes and red peppers. I added an extra red pepper and 2 TBSP of fresh basil and served warm.

Fabulous ! Great flavor and easy ! Several thoughts: First, I used chicken stock as suggested. But in retrospect, I realize there was probably a reason that the recipe states using water to thin the soup: because with a full 2 cups of chicken stock, it dilutes and masks some of the wonderful, smoky, roasted flavor of the vegetables. Next time, I will use half water and half stock. Second, I used goat cheese as suggested and it tasted great. Third, I agree that you need to fully roast the vegetables so they are charred. Fourth, I put in an extra red pepper as suggested (highly recommended if the tomatoes aren't in season). Fifth, I removed the seeds and loose pulp from the tomatoes before roasting. Sixth, we served it hot, which I think is preferable for the flavor and texture of the soup. Seventh, I found the amount of ingredients in the recipe are a bit skimpy to serve 4 people. I ended up increasing the recipe by a half. Finally, do make it. It is superb !!!

This is one of my FAVOURITES - even without the cheese. Sweet, ripe tomatoes are key (i like the strawberry variety). It is a rare recipe indeed that is healthful and so full of flavour. PS - why would one make "red pepper soup" and comment that it was "too red peppery"?

I don't know...not very good in my book. I used chicken broth instead of water and added some fresh basil to the end result. Still VERY BLAND. Also much too red-peppery for me.

I love this soup. Have made it twice now. The first time for my father in law who HATES vegetables and supposedly hates peppers. Served warm first time - the second time I served it cold and for added thickness/body I pureed in some canned white beans - my guests were sure there was cream in it. Basil garnish is a must.

This is an outstanding recipe. I put the roasted vegetables through a ricer, added 2-3 oz. goat cheese and 2C. homemade chicken broth and heated with the thyme. My husband loved it. I think it would also be good chilled, or with feta cheese, which I plan on trying.

I had it hot, with some yoghurt. Very delicious, although I might in future sieve it to remove bits of tomato skin (a particular dislike of mine). I reckon it'd also make a great pasta sauce, or base for a more complex pasta sauce.

Following the other reviewers' suggestions, this is one of the best soups I've ever made. I used chicken broth instead of water, crumbled feta instead of ricotta, & added a Tbsp of balsamic vinegar - yum. I also found that lowering the oven temp to 400 F worked better so that the tomatoes didn't char.

Like other reviewers, I used homemade chicken stock instead of water for more flavor. It's important to skin tomatoes and peppers thoroughly to avoid strings. The goat cheese added a creamy texture - it was excellent!

Very Flavorful. Used Chicken broth instead of water and roasted shallots in addition to 2 more red peppers and tomatoes then the recipe called for.

Refreshing anytime of year, hot or cold. Added fresh chicken stock, 3 red peppers, 1 Vidalia onion, 1 leek, 1 shallot, fresh basil,lemon, Balsamic and a pinch of cayenne. At the finish, a few shavings of chevre gouda. Delish!

I used low fat coconut milk instead of water. It was very creamy and rich. I have servced this many time to guest and it has always been a hit.

We loved this soup and I have already made it many times. I've served it both hot and cold. I like the suggestion of garnishing with sour cream as opposed to ricotta, though we did enjoy the ricotta. I will also try it with a little cream added as suggested by the Cook from Dallas. This is a good first course.

This recipe is amazing and simple with only a few changes/additions. Don't be afraid to generously salt the vegetables and make sure and roast the vegetables until they are charred lightly (which takes up to an hour) then I use about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream along with water to get to the proper consistency. At that point, if the soup is still 'too tomato-y', I add sugar 1 teaspoon at a time until I can taste the full flavor of the soup. I prefer it served hot and also, since having added the cream, don't use the ricotta. And that's it. A really terrific soup.

Make sure your puree this soup (unless you like chunky soup) Good taste. I served the soup cold. I would use 'good old' sour cream to top the soup. Ricotta cheese was too different for my guests.

My husband, friends and I found this recipe to be very unsavory.

The flavor of this soup is excellent, especially if you let the veggies char. Goes well with a nice Cabernet or Merlot. The texture can be improved by straining soup through a sieve after blending.

This soup was a bit acidic. I added a little chicken base to it, but that didn't help too much. I wouldn't recommend tis to anyone!!

I grew yellow bell peppers and tomatoes this summer especially for this soup. It is absolutley marvelous. It also freezes very well and can be enjoyed even in winter.

Try adding 8-16 fresh basiil leaves (finely diced), 2 Tbsp of balsamic vinegar, and some fresh cream or butermilk at the end for a truly different and delightful dish. A nice cabernet sauvignon to rinse the palate...mmmm.

I love anything with red roasted peppers, maybe I'll add more red peppers than tomatoes.

I didn't really care for this recipe. If you seed the tomatoes before roasting it might be better. I didn't seed them and the seeds gave the soup an acidic taste.

A very pleasing soup! The roasted red pepper flavor comes on nicely. I thought that perhaps the tomatoes would take over but they didn't. The dollop of ricotta cheese, to finish, really makes the soup come together. I sprinkled fresh thyme leaves on top and my guest was delighted. I served it warm but would also try it cold. I will certainly keep this recipe on file and look forward to it during the summer, when tomatoes are at their best. By the way, the tomatoes I used were typical sallow winter ones...but the soup was a winner nevertheless.
