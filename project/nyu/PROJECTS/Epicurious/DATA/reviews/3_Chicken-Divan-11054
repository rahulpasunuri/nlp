Reduced the flour and butter to 2 TBLS each to keep it lower in fat and carbs. Sauteed some onions, garlic and sliced mushrooms and threw them in with the broccoli. Did make sure to season the sauce well with salt and pepper. Did not bother whipping the cream. A satisfying, delicious one dish dinner. Will definitely make again.

Quick and simple and tasty. True, it is a bit bland. I added some creamed onions , but it was still bland. Next time I will try something else to liven it up. But it is definitely worth making again.

Two and a half forks. This is quick, simple, easy (downright foolproof) and good. The sauce took less than the 20 minutes stated in the recipe. The sauce is not highly flavored but I enjoyed it very much, especially with the wine and lemon. I differ with a previous reviewer who said the canned soup version was better... in my opinion, this is far better. I would make this again.

I thought this was a very good recipe for beginners. You need to adjust the salt/pepper to taste as well as the amount of flour and sherry. The cheese is great on this, feel free to add as much as you like. Be careful when making this that if is very quick. Measure everything out first, cook your chicken next. I pounded it slightly to make sure all the pieces were the same thickness (allows for all the pieces cooking evenly). Enjoy.

I used leftover thanksgiving turkey and loved the richer flavor in this dish. I doubled the sherry (per some review suggestions), which made the white sauce quite good by itself; however, when combined with the turkey and broccoli, it was very light, almost bland. I did serve it over pasta, which probably sucked up any extra flavor. Also, I topped it with fresh breadcrumbs (per one suggestion), which toasted in the oven, and made the dish much better than it would have been!

This was a recipe I learned from my mother at a very early age. After years out of practice, I had to look up a recipe just to jog my memory about the proportions in the sauce... this one tasted ok- but not like I remember making. I made it a second time, changing the proportion of the "roux"- this recipe seemed a bit runny from what I remember (not to say it's correct by professional standards)... less butter and seasoned the flour. I also added more Sherry and more parmesan (who can say no to more cheese?). I also seasoned and boiled the chicken breasts whole and used that water for the sauce. much better :) ps... asparagus tastes just as great as broccoli.

Very bland. Hate to admit, but the recipe I made in college with canned soup is better. (My husband agrees.) And BTW, it is deceitful and shameful to serve meals with chicken soup to vegetarians. As an ex-vegetarian, when I found out that people had intentionally done this to me, I lost all trust in them.

I thought it was good, but not amazing. It was the first time I ever made chicken divan, and after reading the reviews I was anticipating a much tastier dish. My husband, though, really enjoyed it.

I like combining elements of my mom's recipe with this home-made version. I add 1 tsp of curry powder and the lemon juice, and use 1/2 & 1/2 in place of the whipped cream. Season it well and top the whole thing with a thick layer of cheddar cheese. Total comfort food!

It came out REALLY good and my fiance loved it. I used some dry white wine instead and maybe a bit too much of it. It turned a bit more into a Chicken Francese sauce than what the recipe probably intended, but nevertheless... IT WAS DELICIOUS! If you want to go vegan, replace the chicken with portobella mushrooms. That came out tasting just as good.

Made this last nite with turkey. I used a combination of gruyere and parmesan cheeses and also used chardonnay instead of sherry. Everyone really like it including my 6-yr. old who would like to live on spaghettios and McDonalds. Served it over rice and was a very tasty meal.

Substituted chardonnay for sherry and used a pre-cooked, rotisserie chicken to save time.

This recipe is also found in the new Gourmet cookbook, which is where I got it from. I used the microwave, as I always do, to steam the broccoli, and I topped the casserole with fresh bread crumbs that got nice and crispy in the oven. A very pleasant dish.

Looking for a way to use up smoked turkey breast from the holidays...I loved its flavor in this dish which I served over linguini to make a complete meal. Used gruyere cheese, having no parmesan in the house. I was able to make half the baking dish vegetarian for my daughter by leaving the turkey off that end. (She doesn't know about the broth in the white sauce.) Next time I'll cut the broccoli into smaller pieces rather than spears.

I now make this dish frequently with leftover roast chicken. I too use cheddar, as my husband and I love good sharp cheddar (Cabot Hunters). I skip the lemon and add extra freshly ground pepper and a pinch of nutmeg. It is not fancy fare, but good, quality comfort food with none of the MSG and additives in Mom's old cream of chicken soup divan. I also use frozen broccoli from the garden rather than supermarket fresh. What's not to love?

I took the suggestion to use half & half I used white wine instead of sherry and cheddar cheese instad of asiago. I season my chicken breasts which the recipe does not call for Overall it is a not bad. I have made the dish twice and will continue to make on occasion.

Rating: 1
Too creamy/saucy. Even though I followed the suggestions to use asiago cheese (v. parmesan)- it still tasted like a can of cream soup over chicken and broccoli

Rating: 3
Recipe can and should be simplified in 3-4 ways, e.g. just whisk in 1/4 cup half-and-half (no need to whip heavy cream to stiff peaks -- that's silly). Once you do that, and substitute asiago for parmesan as others have suggested, it's very tasty and a winner.

Rating: 3
In a word..YUM!! Admittedly I did make some modifications. I used asiago and chedddar. I increased the amount of sherry and to cut some of the fat, I used half & half instead of cream. It was absolutely delicious. There is nothing bland about this dish. Give it a try. You won't be sorry.

I wanted a recipe for leftover chicken, and this is a great recipe. Since the ingredients are basic and usually on hand, and the dish gets raves, its a winner! I, too, added pasta at the bottom. It works well for completing the dinner.

Rating: 2
Overall this wasn't a knock out dish. I used cheddar cheese and parmesan and it was still bland. I would suggest adding sauted onion and garlic and a whole lotta salt and pepper. Should have stuck with mom's old fashioned recipe that calls for canned soup. It tastes better.

I made this recipe for dinner last nigh and the family loved it. I doubled the recipie. I used extra lemon over the broccoli. I was very generous with the paprika. The chicken was so moist and the sauce was really good. I definitely would make this again. I will be having a few girls over to dinner soon and I will make this,with maybe rice or noodles.

In the middle of serving this for dinner, my sweetie mentioned that his mother had made this when he was growing up, and did not care for it, but he really, really liked this. He never eats leftovers but actually requested the dinner redux! Made exactly as reciped (?), but added a bit more sherry and stonger cheese (pecorino?). Delish!

This is simple-to-prepare comfort food. I steamed the broccoli in the microwave and because I didn't have whipping cream on hand, just stirred half-and-half into the sauce, and it was fine. Served over buttered pasta. I agree that it was a little bland-- a lot of salt and freshly ground pepper was applied at the table. I'm tempted to play around with the cheese next time, and maybe try something a little stronger, like Gruyere. Chicken divan isn't a world-burning dish, but this is a nice recipe, and a wholesome, easy weeknight meal.

I love cream sauces, so I enjoyed this; my husband thought it was a bit bland. I reduced the fat by using evaporated milk (not whipped). Great way for all of us to enjoy eating broccoli!!

This Divan recipe is Divine! Finally a recipe for Chicken Divan that doesn't call for some kind of canned soup. Oh -- I add an additional 1/4 c. good grade parmesan and don't scrimp on the sherry.

This recipe makes the best Chicken Divan I've ever tasted. Incredibly creamy sauce that leaves a nice comfortable feeling in your tummy. The sherry adds a nice flavor too.

Made this dish for a friends parents who are not too adventerous when it comes to food. Even they thought it was bland. The basics seem good but there is something definitely lacking. Won't be making this one again.

My husband insisted that I throw the leftovers out. There was something about the sherry, lemon, cheese combination that made it seem a little bad tasting to us.

Perfect for the one pan supper I needed to send to another family. I made enough for us too and it was wonderful! (I also skimped on the cream and just used some low fat milk).

Delish! I omitted the whipped cream completely (didn't get to the store), and the sauce was plenty rich.

It is tasty, but the flavors are very subtle. Considering the amount of effort involved in the preparation, I would prefer a more pronounced sherry flavor. Also, it seemed a bit dry.

This recipe was perfect just the way it is. I served it with basmati rice and everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe which worked fine. The sauce was perfectly smooth and creamy. Very tasty.

Just like mother used to make! I added cooked fettucini as a bottom layer and eliminated the lemon in favor of some Paul Prudhomme Poultry seasoning and a touch of tobasco. As Emeril says--it kicked it up a notch. I also used the leftovers from a grilled turkey breast. Delicious.

I added gemelli pasta to this recipe to make it a more complete meal. Cooked one lb. of pasta and added it to the pan before baking. Very good recipe; Definitely not low fat. Next time I may add more white wine to try to give it a different flavor.

Rating: 3
Very good, very rich. To add a little to it, I first sauteed 1 thinly sliced onion and 2 large crushed cloves of garlic in 1 Tbsp butter, then added raw strips of boneless chicken thighs, pepper, salt, and paprika. I spread this mixture over the broccoli and then used the same pan to make the sauce, scraping up the nice flavorful bits. Next time I will decrease the whipped cream by 1/2, and possibly try it without it altogether, as my husband found this dish too creamy, and the brown sauce before you add the cream is delicious on its own.

Certainly not a recipe for fat-watchers, but it certainly is delicious! My wife and children (ages eight and twelve) loved it. It will be a fairly regular special meal here, I believe.
