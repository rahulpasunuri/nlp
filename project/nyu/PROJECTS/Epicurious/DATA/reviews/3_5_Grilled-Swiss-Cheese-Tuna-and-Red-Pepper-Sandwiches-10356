3 Forks = Delicious, and delicious this is. I've made these several times, always to my family's delight. It's good cold, wonderful grilled. A tasty, hearty, EASY step up from plain cold cuts for a weekend lunch. [I use bottled diced hot cherry peppers (about 1 T for 2 sandwiches), and I use a second skillet on top to press and flatten the sandwiches while they cook.]

Thought this was good but not great-I didn't add the cherry pepper-may have been the key ingredient-will make it again and add the pepper

Just made this for a quick dinner - a great new twist for me on tuna salad - my old recipe was truly OLD! Really liked the spicy kick to it - delicious combination of flavors - will definately make again!

I don't like any hot so I left out the peppers in mine but made "to the letter" for friends and they LOVED it! Good quick meal to have in your repertoire.

WOW! Just loved this combination of flavors; only changes were adding an extra cherry pepper (I like "hot") and I used sour dough bread. Delicious!!! KIMBER

I really liked this for a change from the regular tuna salad sandwich. The cumin is a must. I have grilled it, but like it just as well cold on toasted sourdough.

When people hear what is in this sandwich, they are afraid to try it. After one bite, they always want to know how to make it.
