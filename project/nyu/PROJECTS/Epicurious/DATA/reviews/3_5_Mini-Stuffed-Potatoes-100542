I have made this several times and get compliments every time, plus there are never any left. I use a little more bacon and chives. Only issue is the last minute prep but guests eat them throughout the night at room temp and still like them

I made these for a NY Eve gathering, and they were wonderful. A couple steps, but otherwise easy to assemble, and all can be prepared, then baked right as guests arrive. They looked elegant and tasted awesome. Everyone loved them. Will definitely go in my go-to recipes for parties and gatherings.

They tasted good and everyone liked them but there wasn't any wow factor like with some mini twice-baked recipes I've tried. Kind of fiddly to make, messy to pick up, and I was left with a TON of leftover filling even after making extra potatoes (my baby potatoes can't be -that- abnormally small, can they?). It definitely needed the extra chives and bacon but if I had to do it again, I'd just cut the sour cream to one cup, maybe slightly more. The filling was much better after it mellowed for a day and we preferred just smothering some roasted potatoes in the filling.

These were great, made for a happy hour. Tossed them with olive oil and garlic powder. Used more bacon and chives than the recipe asked for. Only problem is the last minute prep, as they are better warmer than room temp. However they all went in a hurry, people loved them

I tossed the potatoes in the olive oil and some kosher salt. After scooping out the middle I added cheddar cheese and crumbled bacon. The day of the party I simply heated them at 350 for about 10 mintues. I let them cool a bit and then topped with sour cream and chives. They were gone in no time-everyone loved them.

This continues to be a favorite party appetizer! I made again this year for a Christmas party and they were quickly eaten. I use the Chipotle Dip recipe from this site for the filling. After I cut the potatoes and toss in olive oil, I sprinkle with coarse salt, garlic powder and white pepper before roasting cut side down. I roast the potatoes a day or two before the party and store in a zip-lock bag in the refrigerator. The morning of the party I scoop out the potato and fill with the Chipotle Dip, cover and refrigerate until the party. Always a crowd pleaser!

Okay, I've made this half a dozen times already. In re-reading the recipe just now, I realized that I have been making them wrong the whole time! But they are very good anyway. Instead of scooping the potatoes out and setting it aside, I put all the scooped- out portions in a large bowl and mash them a little with a fork; then I mix in the sour cream, onions, cheddar cheese, etc. I then spoon the mixture back into the potato shells, mounding the stuff a little higher than the potatoes. Not too difficult or time consuming, but very delicious!

Made this for the first time for Super Bowl XLII. They were a hit! I served them at room temp. and thought they tasted great. I added a little shredded sharp cheddar to the sour cream mixture and then garnished with a little extra bacon, scallion and a little more cheese. They were pretty and very delicious.

These are great, and not terribly difficult. I would, however, say that they really do need to be served at least warm, if not hot (much warmer than room temperature)

I agree with all the reviews, made these for my cocktail party and I could not keep the tray filled. I added a little more bacon, did the potatoes the day before adding the oil and rosemary. A winner!

I used larger ones rather than the smaller version. Didn't want all that extra work.

This was a lot of work for rather mediocre results. The presentation is nice, but I'd rather save some time and make "regular" potato skins.

This was so easy! It was a great make ahead appetizer.

This recipe was a big hit. Like other reviewers, I stuffed them with the Chipotle Dip from this site. I also added crumbled bacon on top. Very good.

I would make this dish again but I would follow other reviewers and add cheese before the sour cream and cut the sour cream to less than half.

Great finger-food! I have never had potato skins without cheese, so here is what I did: after the potatoes were done baking, I turned them over, sprinkled shredded sharp cheddar cheese over them and baked them another 5-10 minutes (until cheese melted and bubbly). Then I added the topping. They were awesome and I will definitely make them again! I didn't have to cut a "flat" spot for them to sit up and if you wait until they cool a little bit before adding the topping, you won't have a "runny, sour cream mixture".

These were SO good!!! My daughter, nieces and nephews gobbled them up SO fast! I used baby yukon potatoes instead of the red potatoes. Also I put the bacon and a little shredded cheddar cheese in the potato shells and heated, THEN topped with the sour cream so you could eat them warm! Mini-potato skins! YUM!

Great appetizer. Simple, quick and delicious.

absolutely everyone that i have made this for wants the recipe... great job epicurious.....

These were good but nothing spectacular. Especially since you can't really serve them warm due to the runny-melting-sour-cream effect. However, the little stuffed package is a great presentation. I'll probably try this next time with some sort of bacon/cheese topping instead so it can be served nice and toasty warm.

I can't believe how easy and good these were. You could serve them at a Super Bowl party or a fancy cocktail party, they are that versatile.

Made this over the holidays - not one left! Found I had quite a bit of the sour cream mixture left over - could have halved the amount made. However, did the left over sour cream make a wonderful chip dip! MUCH better than the store bought variety - so good that I'm deliberately making the extra next time.

This was a great, easy appetizer! I think they needs to be served cold because the sour cream gets all runny when they're hot.

Perfect for football or other casual party - easy and tastes great.

Definitely a Super Bowl/beer guzzling/sitting-on-the-couch-with-your-guy-friends-high-fiving kind-of dish. It's great for that purpose, might be out of place for more formal settings like christmas. Also, the way the recipe reads this dish is to be served cold, which was weird to me.. I served it hot instead. I would make this again..

This recipe is entirely too simple!!! Who would have guessed a red potato could be considered bar food! I make this little gem way too much for my own good.

This is a great appetizer recipe. I made mine per the recipe, except after the potatoes roasted and I spooned a bit of the middles out, I put a pinch of finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese and a crumble of bacon on each. Placed them back in the oven just long enough to melt the cheese, and served them with the both the chipolte dip and blue cheese and carmelized shallot dip on the side(both found here at epicurious). These were the hit of the party and everyone wanted to know how to make them. They are an easy, tasty, and healthier (slightly) alternative to the standard chips and dip. I have a feeling these will become my contribution to future family functions.

I made a variation of these for a Fall party. Except I didn't use the filling in this recipe, but the Chipolte Dip recipe also on this site. They were inhaled within minutes.

I made these for the superbowl this year and everyone who tried them ate at least three or four. Make sure that you get the mini potatoes, as larger red ones take much longer to bake.

I made these for my St. Patrick's day party last night and they were a big hit.I just served them at room temp and they were fine. I would definitely make these again. I had a good amount of the sour cream mixture left over, so I would reduce it next time.

outstanding,, easy but very time consuming stuffing those little potatoes, you can also add chives, onion, pepper, really anything and they are always great.... have made them a few times and although i usually dread it because it takes me so long, they are ALWAYS the hit of the party......

I made these for a party and once someone tried a bite they were hooked! I didn't bother scooping out any of the potato and just put the sour cream mixture on top!

I also added blue cheese and cheddar & then baked them. They were a hit! (In fact, I've been asked to make them again for a picnic next week.)

I also made this for Super Bowl XXXIV and it was the first dish to disappear at my party. They were suprisingly easy to make and they looked beautiful on the serving tray.

Made this for Super Bowl XXXIV but used cream cheese mixed with a little ranch dressing and blue cheese. Put diced yellow bell pepper in half the batch (representing Rams blue & gold) and sun dried tomatoes in the other half (representing Titans blue & white with Red flame). The potatoes were the most delicious helmets and everyone loved it.

This is so easy. I have been doing a similar version for years, except I mix blue cheese and some shedded cheddar in with the sour cream (I use less sour cream). Then I bake them until the filling is bubbly. They're great warm or room temperature. Great on a buffet with beef tenderloin!!!

This recipe is great!! Adding shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture makes it even better!!

For a summer recipe, I sometimes omit the bacon and sprinkle the sour cream with fresh dill and serve chilled.
