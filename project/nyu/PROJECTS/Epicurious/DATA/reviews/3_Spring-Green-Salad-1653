I have been making this salad for many years! It is always a hit .... so refreshing with its vibrant flavors! The lemon and dill are a tremendous accompaniment to any fish or chicken dish.

Amazing. Simple, wonderful and light spring flavours. Always get 'asked' for the recipe when we serve it.

Great! Took to a dinner party and everyone asked for the recipe. Very simple yet tastes so fresh.

"definately" is spelled definitely

Boring, bland and uninteresting. It was definitely not a show stopper as I had read (the other reviews). I won't be wasting my time on this one again! Just tastes like something is missing..

Very good and "spring" tasting! Substituted dried dill for the fresh so I let it soak in the dressing for a few hours. I also used less oil --kept it a one-to-one ratio with the lemon juice.

Looks very average but I made it for a baby shower after reading the reviews. My guests were amazed! Kept asking what was in the dressing. DEFINATELY a keeper. (Could it be any easier!)

I made this for an Easter potluck and it went over very well. My friend, a true gormand gave it four forks. However, I made it with balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice (and a bit more vinegar that called for).
