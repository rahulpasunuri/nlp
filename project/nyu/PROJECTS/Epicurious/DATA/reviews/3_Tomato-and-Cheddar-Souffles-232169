Tastes great - good as a side dish. Not hard, but looks impressive / special for guests

Delicious! I chopped up the plum tomatoes and divided between two souffle pans. Added a dollop of sour cream. This was my first souffle and I will definitely make it again.

I loved it! Simple and pretty tasty! My first time making a souffle and it turned out well! I liked digging down to the tomato! But it definitly should be diced up, like the others said! Maybe some basil would be nice!

I served this for Sunday brunch, and it was spectacular. Amazing, a recipe in Gourmet that has no goat cheese or cilantro and even goes so far as to suggest how much salt to use! Pinch me. Perhaps the food fashion police went out for a bite. Make this before they come back.

Just made this on Saturday - I loved it. I served it with an arugula pasta dish and sliced strawberries for lunch, and the leftover souffles were delicious for breakfast the next morning. I actually made 5 souffles since I had so much batter and I was afraid they would run over. They collapse quickly but they are fluffy and not soggy at all.

I have to totaly disagree with the first 2 reviewers. This was light and cheesey! The only problem I have is with the slice of tomato at the bottom. You have to go at it to cut it with your fork to get some in each bite. I would dice them next time. I also plan to experiment with using other veggies on the bottom...already planning on carmelized onion, and sauteed mushrooms. Will also experiment with different cheeses...fontina, manchengo come to mind, of course in combo with the parmesan or peccorino romano. I served this as a light meal with a classic caesar salad and some crostini. WONDERFUL, fast, easy, light meal. Hubby loved it!

The tomato made this souffle very soupy and nothing special. There are many souffle recipes that are WAY better.

Nothing really special about this recipe. The flavor of the tomato was lost and the souffle fell much faster than others (due to the weight of the cheese). Pass.
