Excellent flavor. Suggest removing the marinade before putting it on the grill, otherwise there is considerable flaming from the oil in the marinade. Or use indirect heat.

This is the second year in a row we did this for Easter. It is awesome. We probably used about 3 times the number of garlic cloves they suggest to insert into the meat though. Love garlic! Anyways, great recipe. Took remaining marinade and brushed it onto asparagus and orange bell peppers to grill with the leg of lamb. Served some garlic and rosemary roasted fingerling potatoes with it. Fabulous!

Unfortunately I didn't have the whole grain mustard so used regular Dijon mustard. I should've used less olive oil as the marinade really was runny, not like a puree. And, as one reviewer already noted, then it doesn't work on the bbq as well. I also used lamb chops, not a boneless leg of lamb, but that was no issue. It really was good, I'll make it again.

Have made this 3-4 times . It's a family favourite ,even for the one that don't like lamb . Easy prep , & turns out well even if you run short on the marinating time.

We enjoyed this dish immensely after only marinating for about 4 hours. Can't imagine how great if we'd left it over night. Took a bit longer to cook as it wasn't exactly butterflied - butcher just cut out the bone & was meat was pretty thick. Will be a keeper!

This is one of my standard, go to recipes. It's important to use the course ground mustard as called for in the recipe - it holds up much better on the BBQ. Even people who are neutral on lamb will love this one. I have tried it in the oven but was disappointed compared to the grill - of course!

Turned out 'good'. I followed the recipe exactly and my husband cooked it perfectly. It was good, just not exceptional. I guess I was expecting to get a little more from the marinade? I couldn't really tell it had anything on it. I will look for something else next time.

We grilled a leg of lamb for Easter this year. We got a 5.75 lb leg from Costco and watched a video on YouTube about how to butterfly it (it was easy). We did use a bit more garlic than called for. Grilled the lamb on a charcoal kettle grill, which took about half the time stated in the recipe, and it came out amazing. Even the left overs were amazing the next day. My two year old even loved it. Fabulous recipe and definitely a keeper.

I've made this twice so far and it gets raves even from guests who "don't like lamb." Left over cold lamb slices made great pita-pocket sandwiches along with Greek salad and feta cheese. I'm trying the mustard-rosemary-garlic paste with bone-in chicken breasts tonight.

Really excellent way to serve lamb. Everyone had seconds and raved about the taste. I thought the mustard might be overwhelming but it wasn't a prominent taste. Cooking time seemed short but it was perfect.

Amazing! I too bought my lamb from Costco and served it at an Easter Dinner party. Rave reviews! Will be making this one again.

Like the previous reviewer, I used a butterflied leg of lamb from Costco. It was only 5 lbs (that's the largest they had), and after I trimmed the fat, I probably had 4-4.5lbs of meat to cook. I might leave a little of the fat on next time for moisture and added flavor. The marinade was simple and it really smelled great when the meat went on the grill. I reduced the cook time a bit to account for the fact that this roast was smaller than called for in the recipe. I probably should have only cooked it for 12 mins/side to achieve med rare because the meat continued to cook while it rested and it ended up being med to med well. But the flavor was terrific. Interestingly the three kids (ages 6 and under) gobbled this up despite the claims of their parents that they wouldn't like it. This is a keeper!

I served this to 9 guests for New Year's Eve using a 5.5-pound butterflied leg of lamb from Costco. I followed the recipe exactly and marinated it overnight. It could not have been easier. My guests raved and everyone cleaned their plates.

Great recipe for leg of lamb. I essentially followed the recipe, but left a bit more fat on than recommended and cooked it fat side up first. I also used a meat thermometer in an area of medium thickness and cooked it to 140 degrees. I picked a medium thick portion as opposed to the thickest part as I knew I'd have leftovers and I wanted the thickest part to be somewhat rarer knowing it will continue to cook when I reheat it. I served rice pilaf with pine nuts (Epicurious 2008) and shaved zucchini salad with parmesan pine nuts (Bon Appetit, August 2010) with it. The rice was very good, the salad exceptional!

Excellent. You can also use bone-in leg of lamb and even roast it in the oven. Just make sure the internal temperature comes to 155 F or so before you take it off the grill or out of the oven. I use slightly less olive oil than the recipe calls for.

I have yet to make this, but upon reading the reviews which I ALWAYS do prior to starting a recipe, I realized that the cooking time stated is presenting a big problem. As with any recipe, use your judgment, always. Trust your instincts. Every time I don't, and follow the recipe as written, I end up disappointed. For meat, you can always use the palpation test to check for doneness. If meat springs back easily, it is done, and pull it immediately. If it still has some give, but doesn't feel totally mushy, it's probably just right, about med-rare. Either way if you are covering the meat to keep it warm, the internal temp will rise another 10-15 degrees. I usually pull the meat when it feels rare and let it rest, covered for 15 minutes.Lamb is one of those meats you do not want to cook over Medium doneness. Best Med-rare. It will still be very pink, but that's how it's supposed to be, especially because it is a game meat. Don't expect it to look like beef. I was notorious for over-cooking lamb, mostly because the color was throwing me off. Also, I only buy New Zealand. American is too gamey for my taste.

I have been making this recipe for many years and by far it is the best grilled lamb. My neighbors are always requesting it and it has now become the expected dish at our annual block party. I recommend uisng New Zealand lamb, they are smaller and milder in flavor.

Made it last night for family Sunday meal. It has been a while since we have had any lamb because most of them are not big fans of lamb. But this recipe changed their minds every one enjoyed and came back for more. It was easy to make and tasted very good.

We're in the minority, but my husband and I just didn't care for this. I'm not sure why, but I did feel that it had a somewhat "gamey" taste and was overwhelmed by the marinade. Maybe we're just not lamb lovers!

the flavors work well and the cooking time is relatively short,some accompaniments recommendation would have been nice.

Made this for my family for Easter, received rave reviews by everyone. My little in-door grill was too small for such a large piece of meat, so I broiled the meat on high heat for 10 minutes per side. Everyone could select their doneness, from well to medium rare. Other than that, didn't change a thing. Delicious!

We had this for Easter and thought it was excellent. Grilling time really depends on the size and shape of the butterflied lamb. I had 2 half legs and they were done well before 17 minutes a side.

We had this for Easter dinner and it was delicious. We love lamb but wanted to experiment with other than simply roasting. Served Julia Child's Potatoes Gratin Savoyard, roasted asparagus and steamed carrots. And of course, mint jelly!

I'm sure this would taste delicious if not overcooked. But we played a guessing game to try to figure out when it was ready, and we guessed wrong. 17 minutes per side was way too short. It would have helped to be told what internal temp it should reach, for example. (This was my first time cooking lamb.) Our thermometer said lamb should reach 180, but I gave up at 155 (it had been on soooooo long, and the rest of the meal was getting cold), and it was overdone - not burnt, but definitely not the succulent 6 pounds of lamb that I dropped $60 to wow my crowd with. Maybe our thermometer needs replacing, but still, the recipe offered no guidance, so it wouldn't really have mattered if had been working. Please - add some additional details to save what looks like a good recipe. Thank you!

This was a delicious Easter luncheon. Ours turned out wonderfully, altho I agree with the comment that more specific cooking instructions would have been helpful. We used a meat thermometer, which helped enormously, because we had to cook longer than 17 min. on each side.

While this turned out well--I think the instructions could have been clearer. Med-High heat is not enough detail. There wasn't anything that said how hot the grill should be, nor did it speak to closing or not closing the lid. As such, 17minutes per side was WAY too much. The lamb was overcooked in my opinion -- and would have been much more succulent and delicious with better instructions.

Made it for Easter dinner. Great, great, great recipe. I don't have access to an outdoor grill, so I used a 2 stovetop griddle. And finished it off in the oven on a roasting pan.

We ROASTED it until it reached an internal temp of 155F and it was perfect. Served with potatoes roasted separately in our dutch oven with rosemary, onion, garlic, and thyme. Also included a side of green beans with a Dijon shallot dressing. Used the lamb drippings to make a gravy with a little Shiraz, garlic, and a touch of set-aside marinade (thickened with corn startch). Great stuff.

I made this for Easter and it was great! My girlfriend doesn't usually like lamb, but she really enjoyed this recipe. I served it with mashed parsnips, sauteed swiss chard and green bean almondine

First time grilling lamb and was very pleased with our results. Tender, juicy, and flavorful. Will add a tzaziki the next time (ready for leftovers) although it stood on its own well. This made a great Easter dish!

A side dish that would be wonderful with this meat is the Sweet Potato/Yukon Gold Potato Gratin w/ Herbs. Found on this website. A real find. Very rich and flavorful.

laurak_d Pilaf is a must and we also do stewed green beans (the flat Italian style w/tomato, bacon, onion and olive oil. S&P to taste)

again, not a review but a question... Can I do this in the oven and get good results? My grill is dead and awaiting replacement parts.

This is an answer to laurak_d about what to serve with lamb. A few suggestions: grilled or steamed asparagus; potatoes roasted with garlic and rosemary; homemade mint sauce which can be sweet or savory; tzaziki, which is Greek or thickened yogurt mixed with shredded cucumber, garlic, and either dill or mint. Artichokes, as you mentioned, would be fabulous. Anything with garlic, lemon, rosemary or mint.

Roasted new potatoes go well, asparagus...artichoke sounds good too.

I don't have a review, just a question. I've never made lamb before and I'm thinking of making this for Easter dinner. What sides go well with lamb? I've been hungry for artichokes, so thinking of making them and a potato gratin.
