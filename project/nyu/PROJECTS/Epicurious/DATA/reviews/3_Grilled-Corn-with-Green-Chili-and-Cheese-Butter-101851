Granted, our produce is not the greatest here in Vegas so I even soaked the corn in sugar water for 15 min. Still, the result was dry and chewy. The butter seemed to incorporate too much of the (canned) chili liquid and lost it's ease of spread. Next time I'm grilling the corn in the husks.

Not only was this good on corn but we are trying it on corn muffins and baked potatoes

The corn turned out to be really good, but we hardly tasted the butter. Grilled corn is just really good all by itself. Next time, I'd use this butter on steamed or boiled corn. The butter had a fabulous flavor -- it just got lost in the smoky grilled corn.

Delicious! If you're from the Philippines, you could buy the grilled corn off the streets in Baguio so you can forgo the hassle of barbecuing ... and enjoy the sauce!
