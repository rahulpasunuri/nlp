I expected this to not be cooked enough, but it was cooked perfectly. I halved the recipe (as that was all the bok choy I had) and used half "mini toy choy" and half "bonsai choy". I added the toy choy first as it had curly leaves and looked like it probably needed to cook longer, and in the end those leaves did hold up better than the flat bonsai choy leaves. I used some cooking liquid I had on hand (some combination of vegetable stock, beef stock and beet cooking liquid I suspect) instead of chicken stock. I think the sauce was the right consistency for the dish. To those who managed to burn the garlic, perhaps you are cooking it too long in the initial step, or the oil is too hot? I did not exceed the time required and my garlic was still fairly white (at least on the top side) when I added the choy, but it was perfectly soft and well-done at the end.

This receipe starts with the technique of burning a bunch of garlic and making the kitchen smell bad. Then you add a few more ingredients and it turns to bok choy in gravy. I was hoping for a crisp clean bok choy stir fry with garlic, this was not it.

Great, all-purpose recipe for stir-frying any sort of Asian greens, beans, etc.

I agree with Ms. Tabasko, nix the cornstarch as long as the Bok Choy is properly dried... Other than that, the timing on the recipe is flawless

This recipe is great, though I'm still trying to find where/when the sesame oil goes. I added firm tofu, a little chopped onion and a sliced celery stalk. You need hi heat to get cornstarch to thicken - to thicken I suggest that once everything is cooked, removing the all but liquid and turning the heat up very high till the sauce thickens, if it gets too thick you can add broth or soy or water.

Made exactly per the recipe (except I grated the garlic instead of slicing it) and it was super fast and easy to make. Turned out delicious, but the sauce didn't thicken a whole lot, which was fine. Was still very velvety due to the cornstarch.

I made a few modifications to this. Added 1 tbsp ponzu (instead of soy sauce) and 1 tbsp fish sauce to the broth and cornstarch (no additional salt). I don't own a wok so I used ~1 1/2 tbsps peanut oil in a large non-stick frying pan (didnt think it needed quite so much oil). I kept the heat on medium as to not burn the ~ 4-5 cloves of garlic. I also added a little bit of freshly grated ginger at this point. Only had slightly over 1 lb of baby bok choy, added it all at once. The sauce didnt really seem to thicken upon simmering so I don't see the point of the cornstarch. Nonetheless, this was really tasty. Served with miso-glazed salmon steaks (Bon Appetit, May 2011) and some short-grain brown rice with sambal oelek.

really good, but not sure it needs to be cooked in oil. I used arrowroot powder instead of cornstarch and the sauce was good. Used half no-chix broth and a bit of fish sauce. Probably could just steam the bok choy in the sauce and make it a little healthier. also, added shallots to the saute and a little ginger. great with pineapple fried rice and/or pork & pineapple kebabs.

neither imaginative nor particularly helpful. It's possible that the pan needed to be hotter for the entire process but the recipe says nothing about that. I think you have to be sure to keep the pan very hot because mine was almost steamed and there was way too much "sauce" left. The garlic seemed like it may have been too much and I never say that..

Wow, I don't know what I did wrong, but mine wasn't good at all. Because I was unfamiliar with bok choy, I followed the recipe exactly. The garlic was burned, some of the vegetable was limp and other parts tough. My husband and I really didn't like it and in fact threw away about half of it. Too bad.

Very good recipe. I made it as specified and it turned out very well. My kids gobbled it up. I did not have problems with it being soupy as other reviewers reported. I measured out the ingredients because it's the first time I made this (I do tend to just dump and eyeball when I know a recipe well).

Yummy! My family liked a touch more salt and white pepper added. Husband added a chili oil over his for a spicey kick.

Wonderful! If shoots are tender, this works great as is. If the bases are more tough, I like to separate and saute them for a few minutes before the leaves.

I used the low-sodium soy sauce and half the salt the recipe called for, and it was just right. If I'd followed the recipe, it would have been too salty for my taste. Otherwise, delicious!

very safe recipe! i've made it twice no. if using larger bok choi, peel leaves apart and slice each leaf once lengthwise to 1" wide stalks. easier to cook & eat.

This was very tasty. Didn't have cornstarch so I skipped that and it didn't seem necessary. Also used grapeseed oil. The garlic came out very nice.

One of my favorites. I don't add the 2 teaspoons of sesame oil since it can be very overpowering. I usually do about 1/2 teaspoon.

Easy and interesting way to serve bok choy. I drained off a lot of liquid. Served it with Veal Picata and noodles. Definitely a keeper.

Delicious! Couldn't find sesame oil in the cupboard, so I sprinkled sesame seeds on top. Healthiest thing I've eaten all week--Maybe this is why the Chinese live so long! :)

This recipe was great. Complimented my Asian pork really well. I made a couple of changes.... I didn't have any seseme oil, used grape seed oil and didn't have vegatable oil, I used olive oil. Also, I used about 6 cloves of garlic. The flavor was great.

This was good, my first experience with bok choy. I slipped and added too much toasted sesame oil it gave it a slightly overpowering burnt flavor. Next time I'll be careful not to add too much sesame oil. Also, Next time I think I will finely chop the garlic instead of slicing it so I don't get chucks,and maybe add a little less of the garlic. I love garlic but I think it may have been a little too much to add 8 cloves. I will make this again. The texture was great!!! the bottom of the leaves was cruchy like celery! and The tops of the leaves were dark and soft like spinache.Its like getting two veggies in 1, and very pleasant to eat.

i'm not sure what i'm missing that other reviewers liked, but this dish was on the bland side and not necessarily the best way to show off bok choy. i don't think i'd do this recipe again.

This is a fabulous, flavorful and very appropriate method of cooking baby bok choy. I found it had a perfect blend of flavors for this already strong-flavored vegetable. Any more flavors and it would be a mish-mash, taking too much away from the delicious flavor of the bok choy itself. I've made it twice - once exactly according to recipe, and another time with some substitutions. I agree with another reviewer that when following the recipe, you should use either low-sodium broth or low-sodium soy sauce, or both. The second time I made it, I replaced the broth with white wine, and added some stir-fried Chinese eggplant. I loved this even more! A couple of tips: I disagree with covering the bok choy - I stir-fried it until it reached the desired tenderness, then added the sauce and stir-fried some more until it thickened. This will reduce the possibility of it being "soupy". Second, be careful to slice the garlic very thin, and to NOT overcook it. Just stir-fry for no more than 10-15 seconds, and then add the bok choy and keep stirring. Also, I chop the bok choy up a bit more than the recipe says, or it's too long and unwieldy to eat. If adding Chinese or Japanese eggplant, slice into diagonal rounds and stirfry on their own in a bit of peanut oil first, and set aside. Add at the end, along with the sauce.

I should have trusted my instincts. When I first looked at the ingredient list, my thoughts were, 1. Gee, that looks kind of bland, and 2. Wait a minute... 1/4 CUP garlic? Are they kidding?? But with all those 4 fork ratings I figured there must be more to it than meets the eye. Lo and behold, the recipe turns out to be: 1. kind of bland, and 2. simultaneously very garlicky. It's also really soupy (I had to pour off a whole bunch of liquid before serving. It's not terrible or anything, it's just nothing more than pleasant (if you like a whole lot of garlic and not much else). Don't be fooled by the reviews into thinking this will turn out to be anything more than the sum of its parts. Next time I'm in the mood for bok choy, I'll look for something a little more ambitious.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, this came out extremely bitter, I think I burnt the garlic a bit but I don't know if that would have made that big of a difference. Also I nearly choked to death on bok choy because it was so long.

I made this in an effort to incorporate more of my partner's favorite food (bok choy) into our dinners... this was good! The sauce actually felt a little heavy to me, but I tend to like things very lightly dressed. Next time I will cut back on the oil, broth and cornstarch.

Who knew the perfect stir fry sauce was this easy? This tastes like the sauce from many of the dishes at my favorite Chinese restaurant. It is great as is, but I prefer turning it into a main course by adding things like mushrooms, eggplant, and tofu. Sometimes I use fish sauce with water in place of the broth.

This isn't the most mind-blowing veggie side dish ever but it is fabulous and when you consider the time and money invested versus the results it is really outstanding. Note: Go either low sodium broth or low sodium soy sauce (or both). Both full sodium ingredients makes the dish quite salty.

Very good. I enjoyed the recipe so much that I've made it a few times. I would suggest going a bit lighter on the seseame seed oil since it has a pretty powerful flavor.

More baby bok choy in our organic box...what to do? Well, tonite I made this simple, quick and delicious dish.. I prepared the sauce beforehand, cut the bok choy and sliced the garlic. Just before sitting down to dinner, I threw it all together, and served from the wok to keep it hot! Yummy. Additional salt was all it needed, as I had used "light" soy. Try it!

We really liked this recipe. I don't have a wok, so I made it in a large nonstick frying pan. The sauce was great. I will definitely make this again!
