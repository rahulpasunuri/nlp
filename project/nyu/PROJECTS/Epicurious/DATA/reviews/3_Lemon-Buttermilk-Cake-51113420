This is an excellent lemon cake recipe -- beautiful lemon flavor that is not overly sweet. I made into cupcakes and frosted with a simple buttercream. It made 26 cupcakes. I used Dorie Greenspan's technique and rubbed the zest into the sugar -- to infuse the sugar with the oils and flavor of the zest -- before adding the butter and beating.
