Very good, particularly the salsa itself. Couldn't find pear nectar so I used a slightly sweet white dessert wine that I had on hand instead and it worked fine in place. Next time I would probably use chicken tenders for a more moist result.

My husband receives a box of Harry & David pears every holiday season from one of his constituents and I always try to find some way to use them up. I tried this recipe this year and OH MY GOSH... it is an absolute keeper! The only substitution that I made was "pear juice" instead of "pear nectar" because I couldn't find it in the grocery. Cutting the chicken breast in half - horizontally, was easier than pounding them down to tenders, but still was just as tender! The salsa is just amazing and could stand alone. I served it on a leaf of romaine alongside the chicken. The sauce for the chicken was a great compliment. I will keep this for next year when we receive that shipment of pears and invite a dinner party for more to enjoy! I loved it, my husband loved it! Try it!

This was very good and I ate it heartily. 3 stars because the chicken is a little greasy and the sauce a tad sweet (like others I used mango nectar, not finding pear at the store). It was a satisfying meal, very quick to put together, served over rice with a side salad. Also, it looks pretty on my blue plates.

This recipe is delicious! I couldn't find pear nectar so I used mango nectar instead and it was delicious with the fresh pear in the salsa! I will definitely be making this again

My picky daughter loved this! It was very easy to make and impressive-great for company. I omitted the lemon juice in both and came out fine. Did not have pear nectar, so pureed 1 fresh pear instead. Did not have cilantro, but mint worked well (though I can imagine that cilantro would have been even better).

The cilantro salsa is absolutely exquisite

We made this in the winter, served with brown jasmine and wild rice mixture and oven roasted Brussels sprouts. We enjoyed the salsa, but I will omit it next time since it didn't seems to pair with the meal. I used pear sauce from Trader Joe's (no pear nectar available) which made a thicker sauce with a shorter cook time at the end. A keeper for us.

This dish is amazing. Super simples to make. I've changed the pear nectar to white grape juice since pear nectar is hard to find. I've made this dish multiple times and it is always incredible. Great fall flavors and will satisfy everyone.

No thank you. This recipe was so WHATEVER. Not a complicated dish, but the flavors were odd and too fruity. Nectar gave it an island flavor, but not in a good way. I will not consider remaking.

I did not have any ripe pears, so substituted canned pineapple. This was an easy dish, lowfat and the sauce was delicious. Next time, I might use fresh pineapple, or mango in the salsa

This recipe is a regular in our home. It is perfect as a midweek dinner or as a dish for company that is fairly simple and uncomplicated. I didn't change a thing. I serve it with basmati rice and vegetables.

This was really easy and very flavourful - not too sweet, which I'd been afraid of. I found it was perfect served with some mashed sweet potato. I'd say that it's more like 4 servings though.

Outstanding! used anaheim peppers instead of jalapeno (yes, we're wimps). Friend used lime in place of lemon juice and used lime zest. Comments ranged from "this is a work of art," to "the two of us finished off every last drop." Didn't search for pear nectar; used pears and pureed with stock then proceeded.This is a keeper! will I make it again? absolutely and again and again and again!!!!

My daughter tried this recipe last week and loved it. She forwarded the recipe to me and I made it for dinner one evening mid week, It was easy to prepare and made a very great and eye appealing dinner. This one is a keeper for our future dinner group menus. (I couldn't find Pear nectar, substituted a small can of cut pears, pureed them and mixed half pear & juice from the can)

This recipe is terrific - easy for weeknight, and fancy enough for guests. I add peeled, cored and sliced fresh pears to the last 5-10 minutes of cooking time to soften, which adds even more flavour and texture. Yum!

I absolutely love this recipe. It's easy to make and the flavors are so good and clean. I love it!!

Excellent! Thicken the reduction with a little mixture of broth and flour and refine the taste with more or less broth, mustard or nectar. The next time I try this recipe, I will add artichoke hearts to the sause. It might make this dish too good!

The chicken was delicious. I pounded it out slightly first. The sauce was very good. We found the salsa to be a little too lemony. I would cut back on the juice next time.

Oh, one more thing, I just pan fried the chicken breast,(no flour) only long enough to brown and then popped them in the oven to finish cooking while I made the sauce. Since I left the flour off of the chicken, I added a little bit of flour to the oil and juices left in the pan. It helped the sauce thicken a bit. Did I say that I LOVED THIS RECIPE!!! :)

I LOVED LOVED LOVED this recipe!! I live on a small island and there are times when it is difficult to find fresh fruit and veggies. So.... I made this recipe with canned roasted red bell peppers and canned pears. Then I used the juice from the canned pears in place of the nectar. It was SO GOOD!! The cilantro is key to this recipe and I can't always get fresh so when I can get it, I chop it and place it in a clean egg carton, fill each space with cold water and freeze. A great way to store unused cilantro since fresh doesn't last long!

The pear salsa was delicious! I skipped the flour and the chicken turned out fine but the sauce seemed to need a little something, maybe more lemon?

I had my doubts about the pear, but, wow! I made it low fat by decreasing the amount of fat, delicious & different!

I thought this was great but the food processor was turning them into slaw so I put half through the processor and hand sliced the remaining. My experience with Brussels sprouts is that if you just sauté them theyre tuff , so I steamed them through for about 5 minutes until they were tender, followed the rest of the recipe and they turned out great. As an added touch try sprinkling with parmesan cheese.

This is a great recipe for this time of year. The salsa looks pretty and tastes great, and the pear nectar sauce was delicious.

Very good flavors...go easy on the butter and oil for the browining...I would omit the dredging in flour next time...the salsa was wonderful - use plenty of jalepenos if you love the kick. The pear nectar sauce was a wonderful finishing touch to the dish. Very colorful. This is a "keeper" Recipe.

Super easy to prepare--I browned the chicken then transferred it to a baking dish to finish in the oven. Don't skimp on pepper in the sauce.
