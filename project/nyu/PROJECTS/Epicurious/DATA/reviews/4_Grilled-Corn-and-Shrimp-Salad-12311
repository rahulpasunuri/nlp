FANTASTIC!!! This is the first time I've ever written a review, after many years of using Epicurious. Huge thanks to whoever recommended the frozen roasted corn from Trader Joe's. Delicious and such a time-saver.

I had ready cooked prawns so this salad was easy and quick to make but it just didn't do it for me. Bland. I will not be making it again.

Very easy, very good. Not a raw onion fan, so I grilled slices of red, then chopped and added. Delicious!! Needs something red, however...maybe roasted red peppers?

My family LOVES this salad. It has a great spice from the jalepeno and onion, sweetness from the corn, tanginess from the lemon, and a nice flavor and texture from the shrimp. An excellent summer food. Although I do recommend a couple of strong mints afterwards for the onion breath.

This was good, if not exactly how I'd imagined it. First of all, unless it's an appetizer, there is no way it will serve 6 people - maybe 4 at most. I expected a smokier flavor from the grill, which I would have liked, and more spice from the pepper. Also, I only used about 2/3 of the dressing. Any more would have been overkill. Changes I'd make next time: Dust the shrimp with ancho or another chile powder; double the jalapeno; add extra lemon or lime juice to the dressing; use scallions instead of the red onion; throw in some chopped tomatoes for color; and serve it over milder greens. You could also omit the shrimp and serve it as a relish or a side dish.

I have made this many times and everyone loves it. I use sweet (e.g. Vidalia) onion instead of red and serve with mixed greens instead of watercress, with avocado and tomato for garnish. When entertaining some who can't stand the heat, I cut back (but never omit) the jalapeno and serve extra on the side. I use a flat Cuisinart pan made for the grill to saute the shrimp - very easy.

This recipe was delicious and even better the next day. I didn't have any watercress, so I added grilled zuccini and tomatoes instead. Yummm...

I really like this salad. I made a few changes, used frozen corn (forgot to get fresh) and sauteed it with some chopped red pepper for color. I also used butter lettuce instead as recommended by others. It is a good side salad or main course.

Wonderful. I followed the recipe with the exception of substituting european greens for watercress, added sliced grape tomatoes and diced avocado. I used Trader Joes pre-cooked jumbo shrimp, defrosted them, removed tails and cut in half for bite size pieces. I roasted the corn in the husks on the grill - soaking the corn in water for 1/2 hour first and cooked 6 minutes per side. Pretty salad and delicious.

I'd been wanting to make this for a long time. Finally did last weekend. I'm not a big fan of shrimp, so I was a little worried. It was quite good. I served it in a tomato 'cup', but didn't like it much that way. The leftovers were wonderful the next day, just out of the bowl. I'll serve it over bibb lettuce next time.

Used x-large shrimp, cilantro and served over bib lettuce....a meal! Excellent!

This salad was good, but the dressing was missing something in my opinion. I ended up adding at least 2 extra tablespoons of lime juice, salt and pepper, and a tablespoon or so of roasted tomato salsa. Also added a couple dry farmed early girl tomatoes and it was much better. I thought the shrimp were a little dry; I would brine them before grilling next time.

Great recipe! I used other reviewers suggestions and substituted Romaine for watercress, frozen Trader Joe's roasted corn, pickled jalapeno instead of fresh, and added red pepper and red onion. Fresh and light!

Delicious! Was even tastier with a couple tomatoes thrown in. Next time I'd add feta or gorgonzola too. Wonderful recipe!

Delicious, Fantastic!! To save time, I cut the corn from the ears and sauteed it on high heat in a pan I very lightly brushed with olive oil, turn frequently so it doesn't get too black. I used medium frozen shrimp, thawed and removed the tails. Coriander is the same as cilantro. As noted from other reviewers, I added extra veggies for color. I add 3 campari tomatoes cut into wedges, and I added 1/2 of an orange pepper diced. I only added 1/2 red onion and I did not add the jalapeno. I doubled the dressing and served some on the side at the table. I made this a few hours ahead for the seasonings to blend and then placed some prepackaged baby romaine on each plate and the salad mixture over top. Served as a main dish with warm whole wheat rolls.

This is one of the best recipes I've used from this website this spring. It's a definite keeper. Like another reviewer, we grilled the corn and shrimp on the stove using our grill pan. I'm fond of cilantro in salad, however, this combination of sweet corn/savory shrimp and spicey greens was very heaven. I personally didn't think it'd benefit from any changes at all.

Rating: 4
This was just as delicious as everyone has said! I made it exactly as written but think that the suggested addition of tomatoes or substitution of other greens would also be good. I used a gadget I had in my drawer that removes corn from the cob, and it worked great. The only thing I found time-consuming was discarding the stems from the watercress. I will definitely make this again for my family and would also serve it to company. This is a very pretty salad in addition to being delicious.

Excellent as is, a meal or a side dish salad.

Wonderful summer salad! For the a SUPER quick easy short cut - Trader Joes sells frozen roasted corn and I thought it tasted just as good as when I've grilled the corn myself.

I live in an apartment, so grilling is out. I brushed the corn w/ olive oil and wrapped each ear in foil & roasted @ 400 degrees in the oven for 1 hour. And made the shrimp in the broiler. Very good light salad.

Oh, this was soooo good! I added a couple of chopped Roma tomatoes for color and I used butter lettuce in place of the watercress. It is perfect for a luncheon or bridal shower. Might add goat cheese next time as Cook from Vancouver.

Excellent salad-my husband and I loved it. I substituted fresh corriander for approx. 3 tbls of ground corriander. I had a "bag of ceasar salad" and just used the romaine lettuce from the bag. I did find a jar of mild jalapeno chiles (the kind you find on nachos) and they worked just fine. I also used light olive oil. It took a little bit longer than 45 minutes to prepare, but I'm at a disadvantage with 3 kids. I'm going to make this for our block party this fall. I think the neighborhood will enjoy it.

This was delicious...the jalapeno, cilantro and lemon flavors accented the roasted corn and shrimp over the watercress. It did take more than 45 minutes but was worth it!

Made this for the first time this weekend. My husband thought it was possibly the best summer supper he'd had in years. I prepared it according to the recipe, only substituting a romaine mix for the greens and adding garden tomatoes per other reviewer suggestions. It's the best of the summer produce stand, with grilled shrimp as a bonus.

Very quick, light and delicious! I just added some shredded lettuce because I forgot to bring home the watercress! Next time I will definately make with the watercress.

This is so good and very easy. I served over a bed of mixed greens. Used a little less onion, otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.

Great recipe! Added red pepper & zucchini to frozen corn, and one additional tbls. lemon juice to dressing. Used Romaine instead of watercress (all I had on hand) tasted fabulous!

I tried it exactly as stated & it was yummy. Next time i want to serve it for a lunch & I'll try spinach and goat cheese. Someone said you could make the the day before....Do you think it would be good?? I'd like someones advice. Thanks

Have made this recipe several times, each time requests are made for recipe. Omitted the watercress, added summer tomatoes with cherry tomatoes and added 1 cup diced celery for crunch. Delish!

This was really good. I made this for a ladies luncheon. I doubled it and served it with organic mixed greens. Forgot to add dressing ended up serving it on the side. The goat cheese is a nice addition as are the cherry tomatoes. This will be a summer staple!

This salad gets praise from everyone - including my meat-and-potatoes only family. I've been adding goat cheese. Serve with a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc - AMAZING!

This was a great salad; I made it for a baby shower and served without the greens in Belgian endive boats... it went like hotcakes!

I quadruple this recipie every year for a large party that I have and there is never any left over. I never use the watercress. For the party, I serve it in a large bowl without any greens. For a family dinner, I use a variety of lettuces. This is an outstanding summertime recipe.

I had a difficult time not eating too much of this stuff! I think that if there is anything left by tomorrow, my guests will love it. And yes, cherry tomatoes are a nice addition.

a great base recipe. add minced salami or chorizo, asiago or manchego cheese, and quartered cherry tomatoes for extra oomph. i also added baby romaine and baby spinach in equal parts to the watercress to make it more of a main meal salad, and more palatable to younsters. made 2x the reco'd dressing.

Fantastic crowd pleaser! I'll get lots of use out of this recipe over the summer! I also want to comment on the cook from Scottsdale "knowledge" about the jalepenos...they do in fact come canned, just like chiles, as I use them in several other recipes...not all grocery stores across the country carry the same things.

Rating: 0
I haven't prepared this recipe. Was just scanning shrimp recipes and came across the reviews. If you two look at this again, please note coriander leaves IS cilantro and to the best of my knowledge jalapenos are not canned (except smoked ones in adobo, which is much hotter than fresh) so I assume that person was referring to canned green chiles.

This is a wonderful salad. I substituted cilantro for coriander and replaced the watercress with baby greens to make it more of a salad. A pint of grape tomoatoes sliced in half was added for more color. Lemon flavored extra virgin olive oil as a substitution helps bring out the shrimp in the salad. Everyone wanted the recipe after eating this salad.

The store was out of watercress, so served this on a bed of mixed greens. Otherwise, follwed the recipe exactly. The sweetness of the corn is a great counterpoint to the dressing. This is an excellent summer meal.

I don't often give a recipe the rating of a *4*, but this one deserves it! Be sure to use fresh white corn and fresh shrimp (oh and real charcoal for grilling, if possible!!). I didn't have a fresh jalapeno to use, so I used a few pickled slices I chopped which were very, very good. The balance of this recipe was perfect and the smoky taste of the corn and shrimp was fantastic!!

Rating: 3
I've made this several times this past summer. It is very good and a nice addition to a barbecue but I find the jalepeno a little bit too much spice I think the next time I make it I will use mild (canned) jalepenos.

Makes a great light summer dinner with sliced mango, fresh rosemary bread and a glass of Pinot Grigio. I used mixed spring greens instead of watercress.

Rating: 4
This is a real keeper. I added 4 more jalapenos because the one just did not provide enough bite. I didn't bother with the watercress as I was serving it at a pool party and used it in place of potato salad. It was a huge hit--received numerous requests for the recipe.

this was the hands down winner at a recent summer cookout. I use hardwood charcoal in our grill and it took just minutes to grill the corn and the shrimp. I have already had several requests for the recipe. So I have been emailing it out like crazy.

I prepared this dish for one of my "100-people" barbecues last summer. It was hands-down the best dish on the picnic table; and the first dish to be emptied. I will recall the smiles of utter satisfaction on the faces of my guests when I'm thumbing thru cookbooks looking for that perfect summer buffet sidedish.
