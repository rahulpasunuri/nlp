I cannot believe I'm the only reviewer/rater of this recipe. It's wonderful, easy, quick [especially if you use a machine to chop the toasted nuts. Also, toast nuts at 350 to 400 F, about 10 minutes until golden brown, instead of standing over a hot stove only to end up with some raw and some burned nuts.] Great breakfastlunch, or snack, alone or with yogurt or cream. Last but not least, it freezes well.
