I really like this recipe. It looks decadent yet it's so simple to prepare. The only thing I add is sprinkling of fresh chopped parsley at the end. I serve it with mashed potatoes and spinach. Delish!

This is a great recipe. I added sliced mushrooms and sliced scallions. Just sautee them in the pan before adding the sherry--terrific!

Used locally raised chops. The sauce is outstanding. We will have it again.

This is delicious just as written. The sauce tastes a bit insipid on its own but is magic with the pork. A perfect easy meal and special enough for guests.

Wow! What a great, quick recipe for pork chops! I'll definitely return to this one again. I used Port and milk - it was so great!

So good! Made it several times, quick, easy, and DELICIOUS! We've tried this recipe with bone in pork chops,boneless pork chops, and boneless thin cut pork chops, they all turned out fine. For boneless thing cut pork chops, I reduced the cooking time to 1 1/2 minute / side.

Amazingly good for such a simple, quick dish. I was hesitant using Sherry instead of Brandy, but it matched the pork perfectly.

This was great - quick, simple and delicious. Next time I will double the sauce.

Here is the thing, all I could find in the cabinet was Dry Sherry, don't know how old either since it was a bottle from the airlines....years ago (20+). Not only that, I only had stuffed porked chops - but made this anyway. It was quick, easy (especially since I love pepper) and on the table in no time! Great!

One of our favorite pork chop recipes - my husband and I have made it several times. We made the sauce with brandy recently when we were out of sherry and it was also delicious.

Made this tonight and it was excellant. Made exactly as recipe stated except I doubled the sauce and used boneless pork chops. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was delicious and as some others have written, it seems like it will stand up to lots of improvisation. I was out of sherry so I used vermouth. My 7-year-old gave it a big thumbs up. We will definitely keep this in the rotation :)

I cannot cook if i know company is expected. I go into panic mode and always seem to mess things up. I tried this recipe because of it's simplicity. Knowing my husband dislikes pepper, i substituted montreal steak seasoning and I'm following a weight watchers diet so I sustituted fat free creamer. My company loved it and I thought it was delicious (and only 7 points)....thanks epicurious!

Easy and tasty. I added a little sage and a little tarragon.

actually had cognac from new year's eve which i used in place of sherry. my guest rated it one of the top three meals in the last twelve months, and it couldn't have been easier and quicker.

For something so easy it is a great meal. My family is not big pork eaters, but this recipe was a hit. I will add a little more sherry next time.

I have substituted similar liquors, depending on availability. Didn't know a good poivre was so easy to make! We are the center of pig production in France, so this is a good main dish, always appreciated by family or company. To make it easier, do all the chops at once in a large pan, and return the meat to the pan for a final minute of cooking with the sauce when it is completed (so pork isn't cold).

Very good and simple recipe. Not a WOW but company worthy. I used a little less cream and the sherry flavor did not come through. I would use more sherry next time and more pepper.

Tried this for dinner this evening and was very pleased with the results. (I love recipes that don't include a whole bunch of ingredients). Didn't have sherry so substituted tawny port instead - appeared to work fine. Definitely a keeper

I wasn't expecting too much from this recipe because of the overall ratings by others, but I made it and I was delightfully surprised! My family raved about it and wanted more! I made it exactly as the recipe states. It was wonderful and I will absolutely make this one again.

This was really delicious! I used boneless chops and the outcome was great. The sauce is very tasty.
