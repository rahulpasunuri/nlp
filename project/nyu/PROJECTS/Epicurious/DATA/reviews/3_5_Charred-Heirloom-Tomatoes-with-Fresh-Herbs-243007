This isn't a recipe, it's merely a process (and a delicious one at that). I don't think many cooks need much help figuring out how to grill a tomato.

excellent with summer heirlooms - just a quick go on the grill or else they'll over cook. a bit hit. recommend with enture tuscan grill menu

I made the mistake on not heating my grill up hot enough so they did go a bit mushy on me. But I have grilled tomatoes before and loved the results. The herbs added a nice touch to this particular recipe.

I was disappointed with this recipe. I purchased four different heirloom tomates at my local farmer's market at a cost of $12.00. The results after grilling were mushy tomatoes all with the taste of the herbs. The individual flavor of each was lost. I wouldn't make this again.

...grilling is the perfect way to bring out some incredible flavors in fresh tomatoes. It intensifies the underlying sweetness that might otherwise be missed. This is a simple but effective way to release those flavors. I also like the charred tomatoes with a light splash of white balsamic vinegar and some chunks of fresh mozzerella.
