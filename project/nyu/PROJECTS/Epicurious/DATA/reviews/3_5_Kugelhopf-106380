I added another tsp of orange zest, and 1 tsp of almond extract. Toasted the almonds and added about 3/4c to dough. Baked for 15 minutes not 20-25.

While I have not tried this bread yet, I would like to point out that I found it in the category of Eastern European breads. As Austria is not part of Eastern Europe, this bread is misclassified.

note to the previous reviewer: breads continue to bake after they come out of the oven [just like roasts]; they usually do need to sit a while uncut for optimum flavor and texture.

Really nice bread. Reminds me of being a kid and mom making homeade white bread... buttery and sweet flavour. I baked for 15 mins without the cover and then 18 mins with the cover and it was a bit crustier than I would I have preferred. Will probably cut the baking time a bit more next time. (I used a dark pan.) Also, I am definatly not wait an hour to cool before digging in next time... I bet this is teh best just out of the oven!

This bread is a traditional Easter bread in our family. After attempting this recipe for the first time, the consensus of my taste testers was that it did not contain enough raisins. The second attempt yielded a sweeter bread using a box (approx. 2 cups) of golden raisins. I also cut down the baking time due to my darker bundt pan. A definite winner!
