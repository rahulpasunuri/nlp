Wonderful flavor. I would make it again, but use small-precut carrots instead.

A refreshing change from the typical carrot dishes. Would make it again.

Fantastic way to do carrots. We all loved it. They were tender, sweet and complimented well with the marjoram and molasses.

My review below--by the way, I forgot to mention that the recipe makes enough to feed an army. I made a third of the recipe and had a nice bowl full.

I prepared this dish (only had to substitute dried flaked marjoram for fresh which was not available) yesterday for the Big Dinner. There were six other side dishes along with the turkey and dressing, so lots of competition for the favorite side dish. This didn't win. It was good, and very pretty, but not standout. The molasses flavor, even using light molasses, is pretty strong. A good dish, but not a huge crowd-pleaser.
