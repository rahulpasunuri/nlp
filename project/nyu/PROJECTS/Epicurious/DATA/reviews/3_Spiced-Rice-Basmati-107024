This dish is not only delicious, it smells lovely, even though I had to use ground cardamom instead of actual seeds and regular long grain rice instead of basmati. I *did* add a bayleaf, which I thought was a nice touch.

This was so delicious that it's hard to believe it was so easy. One comment on the reviewer who said the rice was bland, maybe try using good quality basmati. It makes a difference.

Made it "as-is" from the recipe, and it was a great hit. So good, that it only served 2! :-)

I took the advice of the previous reviewer and used chicken stock instead of the water, it was very good, but if you do this cut back on the amount of salt. I used ground cardamom for the seeds. This is a very flavorful rice and would definitely make this again.

This recipe was really easy to make, and one could leave it while it cooked. The rice itself was a little bland. Maybe use chicken broth instead of water next time.
