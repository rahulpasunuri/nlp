Wouldn't normally give a 1-fork review but according to epicurious 1-fork = okay, and that's exactly what it was - okay. Didn't have much flavor and was difficult to scoop onto bread because of the beans. Maybe mashing the beans would help.

I doubled this recipe for a party of about 13 last night and it was a huge success. People were asking for the recipe! I left out the carrot, used garlic powder instead of fresh, and added some Italian seasoning, more salt, and a squeeze of lemon juice. The lemon really brightens the flavor. This was the first appetizer to run out. Affordable, filling, and tasty!

I first made a double batch of this for a ladies' cocktail night, and it got rave reviews. The taste is so fresh - it's amazing! Leftovers the next day (if you have any) taste great!

This was so delicious. I put it on toasted french beget for a cocktail party and it was a hit. They went fast and everybody loved them.
