As a garlic lover, this was a find. I too added some dijon to the sauce and a significant amount of salt & pepper. Moist salmon and a lovely garlic flavor. Not to mention, super easy

With all the positive reviews, I was expecting this to be quite good, but it was jus ok. I added the mustard to the garlic puree, as some recommended. The puree was delicious, but it really didn't add much value to the salmon.

This is an excellent recipe! All the prep is done in advance and since you're baking under a layer of roasted garlic puree (I did add dijon mustard for delicious added tang) you can trust the fish not to overbake and dry out. I gave the fish 15 minutes in the oven at dinnertime and concentrated on other, last minute stuff. The salmon was perfect! I baked it in the upper part of the oven so that the top would brown slightly and this took the place of the final broil suggested by some. Perhaps the easiest, most reliable and most delicious fish recipe I've made in years!

Upon tasting this dish i recieved the following comments: "It felt like angels were singing a chorus of Carmina Burana in my mouth." "My taste buds fluttered and danced with the garlic soaked salmon as the wine invigorated my sensual side." Aside from the commentary, I knew this dish was a success. I was thoroughly impressed with the turn out. Although, I have tried this dish with canned tuna and it didn't exactly float my boat. In otherwords, stick to the recipe, you can't go for the gold using copper utensils. Definitely a dish for the old man and the sea.

This is an excellent dish for a large party because it is delicious and elegant, easy to prepare, and, can be made the day before. I served it with chopped tarragon because I used rosemary in another dish. Results were splendid. I imagine dill would work just as well.

Took another users advice and made this one combined with the broiled salmon with apple-date chutney on this site. It came out absolutely wonderful! Loving the garlic paste, I'm going to try it with some parsley & basil on some steaks tomorrow.

I loved this. I made it just for myself so just mushed up the roasted garlic and oil that I cooked it in to make the paste to smear on the salmon. Use the rosemary for sure, it provides a nice balance to the rich salmon and roasted garlic. This will be a staple, at least this summer while the salmon is plentiful!

We are garlic lovers and didn't particularly care for the amount of garlic on the salmon. Might try again with less garlic.

This was very nice, pretty simple to make, and easy to prepare in advance-my market was out of rosemary, I used thyme instead and it was lovely.The roasted garlic was a good but not overpowering compliment to the salmon.

If they had 2 1/2 forks, that what I would rate this recipe -- somewhere between 'like it, don't love it' and 'delicious.' Very easy to prepare, and I liked that it can be made in advance. Also, I nearly always have all the ingredients on hand (other than the salmon). It was fine for a casual dinner with family, but I personally don't think it's impressive. Also, don't plan on doing much kissing after eating this! Major garlic breath!)

Delicious and a beautiful presentation! I followed the recipe exactly, using copper river salmon and fresh rosemary and meyer lemons from my garden. Recipes don't come much better than this. The flavors blended beautifully still allowing the fresh taste of the salmon to come through.

This was, perhaps, the most successful salmon dish I ever made. Everyone loved it. Not a morsel was left. The cooking time of fifteen minutes is right on the money. Note: I added a tablespoon of dijon to the recipe, and it gave it wonderful extra zing!

Sorry, garlic paste and salmon does not work for me. Very so-so dish no matter how quick it was to make. My chardonnay was excellent, however.

Very tasty. I purchased a whole copper river sockeye (around 5 lbs) and used 4 whole heads of garlic (easier to bake whole rather than individual cloves of the garlic.) Not wanting to mask the flavor of this delicious fish with a heavy sauce, this recipe fit the bill perfectly.

The roasted garlic puree was a nice mellow accompaniment to the salmon. Served it with roasted asparagus, a simple salad and white wine and had a delicious, easy meal. Next time I will cut down on the cooking time slightly.

This recipe is delicious and simple to prepare. In-laws loved it and my husband, who doesn't eat fish, enjoyed it, too. I would definitely make this dish again.

I don't even like salmon, but this dish was delicous! It was super-easy to make however it tasted like it took hours to prepare. I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I added dried rosemary to the garlic/butter puree. I served the salmon with spinach (sauteed in butter, olive oil and shallots) and garlic mashed potatoes. YUM!!

I made this on Christmas Eve for my family and close friends, doubling the recipe. Everyone raved about the extraordinary flavor and aroma. My finnicky cousin kept declaring that it was the best salmon he had ever had, and my father, who rarely eats fish, lauded me with praise all evening. I gave 3 forks instead of 4 because there is nothing that is so different or interesting to me that it is "beyond compare." What I can say is that it is a crowd pleaser and that it is easy to double or triple. Very little work makes a well-received dish here.

Simple, easy, and shockingly yummy! I highly recommend this one.

My local store had a special on Copper River salmon and I looked specifically for a simple dish that involved roasting as opposed to grilling. This was very good. The salmon itself was incredible, but the sauce was a nice accent and it did not overpower the salmon's flavor. I served this with sauteed spinach and couscous.

For you salmon and/or garlic lovers...this is the one. Of course if you don't start with a nice piece of salmon you won't like. Best if you can find it fresh. Easy to make and I've always had compliments from friends.

I first made this recipe back in 1998, when my husband and I were dating and I was trying to woo him through his stomach. He absolutely loved it and requests it often. I served it to guests for the first time the other week and I had many requests for the recipe! It's so easy to make that it is ideal for company.

This is so easy to make, and very good. I tend to use a little less garlic than required by the recipe, so that the flavour of the salmon comes through.

This was good, mainly because our cut of fish was excellent, but I won't make it again. This is coming from two GARLIC LOVERS--it's just not right for salmon.

One of the best and easiest salmon recipes we've tasted. Substituted fresh snipped chives for the rosemary as garnish.

Hello everybody! I was the first person to rate this recipe and to recommend adding dijon & mayonaisse. I have also found that it doesn't need the butter. (although everything is always better with butter!!. I find that the mayonaisse (light) tends to keep it very moist. Be sure to try the glazed grilled salmon recipe on this site. It is excellent - second to this one!

Incredibly good! However, I roasted the garlic upeeled, and then mixed with more olive oil than butter, the second time. Tasted better and is healthier. I also added mustard, as suggested. Really amazing and easy.

Excellent taste and easy to prepare. Also, this is the best way I've found to roast garlic. Most recipes call for it to be roasted in the skin and I've always found it messy trying to squeeze it out of the cloves. This way is easier and you don't lose a bit of the garlic.

This dish was great. I followed some of the suggestions, i.e., adding mustard to sauce and broiling a bit before serving. The second time I made it I doubled garlic/sauce recipe and served as dip alongside salmon. There was nothing left. Easy also.
