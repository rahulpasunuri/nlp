This dish is fabulous for anyone who likes onions and the aroma, while cooking, is heaven.

I made these for a dinner party--doubled the recipe--and everyone loved them. Slightly time-consuming, but mostly inactive, so not a big deal. Lucky me, I have leftovers

Good flavor and presentation but the process! Takes too long and like another reviewer noted the basting juices dry up after an hour. I added water to the pan and that helped. The last hour I put the oven on convection at 425º and the bacon/onion were done in about 40 minutes. Mine were MUCH darker than the photo. 1/4 onion is a good serving size because sweet onions are so large.

Definitely different and the half onion is pretty. A good choice when my usual side dishes are tired, but not a big enough hit to be a regular.

I made with 1/2 the sauce and only used one onion in an 8X8 pan. All of the liquid was evaporated and burning after one hour! I added more liquid and it still kept evaporating and burning. Bottom line, I'll try again but reduce the entire cooking time to one hour for the first step, add the bacon and cook for 30 minutes more and have more sauce on hand to add if it dries out. Oh, and line your pan with foil, this pan is going to take LOTS of scrubbing to get clean. Basting thick slices of onion with italian dressing and tossing on the grill is much easier and better tasting.

I made this dish with Bermuda onions and served it with Pork Chops with Sour Cherry Sauce (also on Epicurious). They went over very well.
