Excellent flavor and easy to make! I also sautéed the celery and carrots first, then onions.

Wow! This IS a simple, great tasting soup recipe. I made several changes. 1)I added an extra carrot 2) I sauteed the vegetables, carrots and celery first for a few minutes, then added the onions for several more. Then I seared the skinless, bone in legs(2) and the (2)split skinless chicken breasts.(in tihe same pot with the veggies) 3) I used a modest concentration of Better Than Bullion Lo Salt Chicken Broth (made from concentrate)(I run this through a fine mesh scoop a couple of times to remove some solids that I believe detract from the flavor when left in), instead of using just water. 4)I added an extra 2 cups of water, and 5) I used 1 teaspoon of salt, figuring I could add more later, if needed. We had slices of a nice 9 grain bread as a side....This one is a keeper!

FYI - the version of this recipe that appears in the print edition of The Gourmet Cookbook calls for 1 teaspoon of salt, not 3.

Love the simplicity of this soup, and it tastes great. Like many others, I did sub some of the water for some chicken broth. I added salt to taste, and it was delicious. My 2 year old loved it!

My husband is not usually a soup kinda guy but he loves this recipe. Everyone in the family loves it and yes, it is extremely easy to make. For extra flavor use a big, fresh, organic, free-range chicken. YUM

Delicious, so simple it's almost sinful soup. If I want to be extravagant, I use the whole chicken in the soup; otherwise, taking some of it out after cooking is a good way to have extra chicken for alfredo, tacos, etc.

Surprisingly delicious and comforting on a cold winter night. I thought it would be rather bland so I did add garlic and green beans and a can of fire roasted tomatoes along with some herbs. I think the addition of some lemon juice would be good too.

My family loved this. Best of all it was SO easy! Definitely in the winter rotation.

This is one of the easiest soups to make from scratch. It is delicious. Makes a wonderful chicken broth you just can't get from a box. Use organic chichens, they have much more flavor. I like this soup because you don't have to strain anything or through any veggies out. Everything is cooked in one pot and in one hour its done. All that's left to do is pick the chicken meat off the bones. This is real comfort food. Made almost 5 quarts, some to eat now...some to freeze for later. Make this one...you won't be disappointed.

Amazingly easy and delicious, makes a ton of soup. We didn't measure anything but the water and the rice, and went heavy on the veggies. Also included parsnip, which added a very interesting and yummy flavor. Perhaps don't add parsnips if you want a more traditional tasting chicken soup. The brown rice was a great addition. This is definitely going to be a staple recipe for me!

I was in a hurry and used organic chicken broth instead of making the broth as directed(added salt to taste vs. what they suggested). The soup tasted delicious and was very easy to make. I'm not really a soup maker but this was delicious and easy. I may add the leeks next time, as someone mentioned.

the recipe calls for waaayyy too much salt. salt at the beginning and then taste before serving. mostly likely you will not need any additional salt.

i added leeks and turnips. used a combo of organic chicken stock, organic veggie stock & h20. i also used a kosher chicken from whole foods. we are in the middle of a snow storm with almost 2 ft of snow... this soup with some crusty home made bread and a glass of wine is pure heaven. i would definatly make it again. this recipe is like a black dress. you can dress it up or dress it down. but its a staple in my culinary closet.

This is a healthy, easy and delicious chicken soup recipe! Since I usually cook for two, I cut the recipe in half and used two split chicken breasts instead of an entire bird. I also substituted half of the water for chicken broth and added assorted "soup greens," i.e. parsnip, turnip, leeks and a bit of dill for extra flavor. This is now my go-to chicken soup recipe!

Really good and so easy! I used half chicken stock and half water for more flavor. Be sure to use organic chick; tastes much better.

Delicious, easy, makes a lot of soup. I used an organic chicken which gives the soup so much more chicken flavor. I cooked a second chicken using the same method, but left out the rice--provides lots of delicious broth and the chicken still has plenty of flavor for sandwiches, soups or chicken and dumplings. A keeper.

This soup is delicious and had my friends fooled into thinking I'm a great cook! I've shared it with a few friends over dinner (then left over lunch) and got oodles of compliments. I didn't change anything except left out the parsley. I love pepper too, so I added an extra teaspoon. I will definitely make this again!

This is my favorite chicken soup for making when someone is sick or needs a bowl of comfort food because it is so simple and easy. I add 1/2 bouillon cube, more celery & carrots and more rice. I also add thyme and a bay leaf.

Really yummy and EASY! I didn't change much with this recipe, but I let the soup chill overnight, that way the fat rose to the top and I was able to remove all of it. I then added the chicken into the soup. Of course you can only do this if you aren't eating it right away. Delish!

This soup was good. It was so easy to make that I'm sure I will use the recipe again. My children liked it which is always a plus.

I love this soup for the great combination of flavor and convenience. I used half homemade chicken stock and half water for the liquid. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe. This was a gift for a sick friend, so I packed the soup in containers and refrigerated overnight, then came back and defatted the soup the next day. The soup was so satisfying that I kept two of the containers for myself!

This turned out great. I followed the other suggestions and used chicken stock instead of water. I also cooked everything for an hour before adding the rice. I put the rice in while I was deboning the chicken and let it cook for another hour. I didn't use regular brown rice, I used a mixture of brown rice, wild rice, and radish seeds from trader joes. It gave it a nice kick. I also added about double the veggies it called for plus parsnip, potato, and 3 garlic cloves. Very good, everyone loved it. Also can be ate for someone following weight watchers!

A keeper. Very simple, yet very tasty. Definitely use chicken stock instead of water; the outcome depends to some degree on the flavor of the stock. I just made the recipe a second time using Trader Joe's organic chicken stock, and it wasn't nearly as flavorful as when I used regular store-brand stock. Go figure! Next time, I might try boullion cubes as some other Epicurians suggest, since it does call for a large amount of liquid (which you definitely need all of -- because the brown rice sponges a lot of it up as it cooks). I mistakenly bought cilantro instead of parsley for this recipe but it turned out to be exceptionally tasty. Oh and one more note: I also once tried this recipe in a slow cooker and it did not turn out at all (glue-y) but it doesn't matter, because the regular recipe is so incredibly easy. If you're using a mandoline for the celery and carrots, you'll be finished with prep in 10 minutes or so.

This is really good. Nothing special about it. Just good, normal, chicken soup.

This soup is delicious and easy! For a change of pace - use cilanto instead of parsley, ( I actually used about 1/2 cup, ) makes for a little different flavor than the usual chicken soup.

I agree with previous reviewers - I don't like a greasy stock. Made this recipe with a great organic chicken stock in the box (easier than degreasing and all of that) and added aromatics that I like (bay leaf, thyme) and the basic veggies. Added diced rotisserie chicken at the end so as not to dry it out. It's tasty with the addition of green beans, chopped tomatoes or whatever suits you.

Before making this recipe, I read previous reviews, combined what I liked, and it turned out absolutely delicious. I used 5 chicken boullion cubes, frozed corn at the end, & parsley at the end. I also skipped the extra 2 tsp of salt. I served it up in a bread bowl and we couldn't stop eating it !! Fabulous ! This will definitely be "my chicken rice soup" recipe going forward. P.S. I didn't have any trouble skimming the fat as others did, could be because I was using a skimmer & not a spoon or something else. Was easy, tastey, & great!!

I made the chicken broth first (w/chicken, carrots, onions, celery, salt, pepper), then cooled it overnight and defatted it. I then returned it to a boil and added the rice and a new batch of veggies. This made a much cleaner, less greasy broth.

This is awesome. This soup is thick, flavorful and delicious. I use arborio rice in place of the brown...use boullion and not broth, and add 3 cloves pressed garlic with onion, and some frozen corn in at the end. I don't add celery or salt. YUM! I have made this several times already and plan to again tonight!

My search for that good old fashioned taste has ended! There is only two of us so I used leftover chicken from "MY FAVORITE SIMPLE ROAST CHICKEN" recipe on this site. Threw the cooked carcass in the pot (plus pan drippings from the night before), simmered and removed bones as instructed then added the meat 5 min. before serving so it didn't get mushy. Also used chicken broth and boullion cubes as other reviewers suggested.

This was just wonderful. Smooth, almost creamy, mildly-flavored (I was a little skeptical about the lack of spices)...I found myself wishing for a more normal winter so I could appreciate this true comfort food on a blizzard-y day. And so easy, too! Just watch the salt--it was quite salty without adding the last 2 tsp. of salt.

I had 2 problems with this recipe. One, I couldn't defat the soup with all the other ingredients and rice in there. Two, adding the parsley in the beginning made it turn brown and unappetizing. The taste is ok but the the texture (too much fat) and brown slimey parsley make it hard to eat. I may try cooking the chicken and vegetables, defatting, and then adding rice, plus add parsley at the end and let the whole thing sit overnight.

Very good. I will make this often. I used chicken broth instead of water and added chicken base. I used all chicken breasts instead of whole chicken.

A good basic recipe, but very tasty - a perfect comfort food! I made my own broth a few days earlier (placed whole chicken in pot w/ water, onions, carrots, celery, red peppers, parsley stems, spices... whatever leftover veggies and herbs are in the fridge... removed meat from chicken after an hour, placed remaming chicken parts back in, and left to simmer for 3 hours). The pre-made broth made for an easy mid-week meal, especially when using the food processer to chop the veggies, herbs, and chicken.

I usually dislike the "I made it this way" remarks, but they were helpful so here goes. Yes, do use stock instead of water. It's amazing the rice doesn't get overcooked but it is perfect and I used white. Probably would add some corn next time. So easy, so quick, loved it!

Excellent basic chicken soup recipe. My 4-yr old ate 2 bowls of it! Added quite a bit of "better than boullion" chicken-soup base to give it more flavor. Served it with dollop of home-made fresh (spicy) salsa for a nice "kick." YUM!

I enjoyed this soup on a cold snowy day. I used only 2 quarts of water and dropped in 4 chicken flavored boullion cubes, 2 cloves of chopped garlic and 2 bay leaves. Good result!

If only someone could make a candle that makes your house smell like this soup cooking. I had the windows open since its spring and my neighbor and my husbands friends who were over playing horseshoes stalked me until it was done. Luckily this recipe makes alot. This is a very inexpensive meal when you want to feed alot of people. After reading the other comments on the blandness of this, I did as my mother does when she makes homemade soup. Any spice at close reach get dumped in and hope for great results. I also added about 8 chicken bouillon cubes to the water and 4 bay leaves (make sure you remove them before serving, my husband didn't know your not suppose to eat them). It turned out GREAT!!! Even my very picky children asked for seconds. I will definatly make this again and again and again.

Great way to use up leftover turkey. I used chicken broth instead of water and added 2 bay leaves and lots of fresh parsley. I used leftover turkey that had been frozen. Wonderful flavor, nice and rich. I'd probably use more rice next time.

I agree with the other reviews this is a tad bland. The second time around, I added 2 T of "Bells all natural seasoning (ww.brandy-ent.com) It has been around since 1867 and comes in the same yellow box my Gramdmother used when I was a kid. Also, try using chicken stock ( home made is best)instaed of ther 3 cups water. Helps significantly. All said, a keeper.

I've made it twice and added chicken soup starter (about 4 Tbsp) as the original recipe was bland. The second time, I didn't have parsley or celery on hand so added crushed rosemary which was very good. I love the brown rice, and how easy this is to make.
