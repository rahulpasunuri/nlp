That was Excellent. Used a non-virginia ham. and what ginger I had and made due with 1 can crushed p.-I mashed as they cooked- p and i can p. rings and that juice and two tsps. crushed garlic. I basted till i ran out-about 9 times, and coverede it with foil lighly and left in oven longer was better. 2.5 hours

I made this for New Years for my boyfriend and his mom and normally I am not a huge fan of ham but I have to admit that this came out wonderfully. I followed the other suggestions of making a little extra pineapple mix. I also made sure to baste it every 15 minutes. It was soft and the flavor was wonderful, plus it was very easy to prepare. I will definitely be using this recipe the next time I make ham. It's a keeper!!!!!

A simple and good, basic recipe for pineapple ham.

Made this for New Year's dinner; have not cooked a ham in years and this was the best one I ever ate. Made it exactly as per recipe here except I used a 7-8 pound, lean, boneless cooked ham. Roasted it at 325 for 90 minutes and left off only the cherries. The flavour of all of it was amazing, and on day three it still tastes great. Thought the sauce might have too Asian a flavour to match the rest of the meal but not at all - it all blended beautifully. We'll make this again for sure.

Because I don't like an overly salty ham I boiled it for 30 mins in ginger ale. Then I doubled the ginger and garlic, added a tablespoon of Braggs, and reduced the sauce a second time after the ham was baked. It was fantastic.

Good. The family liked the cooked pineapple. My son kept asking for more pieces of pineapple - he claimed that it was fruit that tasted like ham.

Excellent recipe. I have made this for two family dinners. Everyone raved over this ham. It's a keeper

I skipped the cherries, which seemed to me a silly adornment and of no consequence to the flavor. I added more ginger and garlic, because I don't think 4 cloves of garlic is enough to have significant impact on 5-10 pounds of salty rump. The genius of this dish is the paired flavor of cloves and ham.

This is a fine, basic recipe for making ham. I left out the cherries -- that was a little too corny for me -- but the other ingredients made this a hit. On the other hand,how wrong can you go with ham?

No need to find another Easter ham recipe... this one is perfect. I added a little more pineapple juice to the glaze because we love to have extra for serving. I could eat the garlic used in the glaze by itself... it is that good. Pretty presentation, and even works well with a spiral ham.

Great way to cook a ham! Yes, it does remind me of the way my Mother cooked ham in the late 60's. After reading about the basting sauce being too sweet and thick to use, I decided to just heat it on the stove and add it to the roasting pan without letting it reduce (with the ham elevated above it on the rack). There was plenty of juice to baste the ham every 15 minutes and the juice reduced (thickened)itself in the roasting pan with plenty left for gravy. My family raved about this one.

MY HAM TURN OUT GREAT. NOW I NEED SOME SIDES TO GO WITH IT. PLEASE CAN YOU HELP WITH THE SIDES.

My ham was delicious, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was moist and not dried out at all, big hit for Easter. Only complaint, my sauce boiled down to almost nothing, so I didn't have much sauce by the end, though I did baste it faithfully every 15 minutes for about 2 hours. Very nostalgic, it reminded me of the hams my mother and grandmother used to make back in the 60's. Thanks!

I made this for Easter dinner yesterday and everyone loved it. It made such a beautiful presentation. Preparing the ham was also a fun thing to do with my 10 and 12 year old who both love to cook. My only complaint was with the pineapple basting juice. It cooked down to a sticky mess and there was nothing left to serve with the ham even though I followed the instructions exactly. Next time I won't line the pan with foil, either. It's stuck and literally won't come off (I am ashamed to say it's still there this morning).

This came out to be the most moist and tasty ham I have made. I would probably do with less maraschino cherries on the next go around, but it is highly recommended.

I don't fix ham much anymore, but wanted something different for Christmas dinner. This made a beautiful presentation and everyone had seconds. The sauce is a tasty addition to an otherwise familiar recipe.

I used this recipe for my first time at making ham and it was fabulous. I made the basting sauce the night before and then heated it on the stove before putting it in the roasting pan.

This was good but I don't think it was particularly flavorful. It was very pretty to serve.

This ham is absolutely delicious. The glaze is wonderful, fills the house with a spectacular aroma, and the ham is moist and delicious.

Delicious! I have made this ham several times. It makes great winter comfort food served with Fanny Farmer mac and cheese and a steamed green veggie. Our favorite is using the leftovers in one of the scalloped potato recipes from this site.

This recipe is wonderful - fast, easy & delicious. We used a Hatfield ham - boneless & rindless and followed the recipe exactly. The pinapple rings were delicous cooked against the brown sugar, so we will try to do additional pinapple next time.

This recipe reminds me of the ham with pineapple that my mother use to make for Christmas Eve when I was growing up. Will make this again.

My boyfriend and I made this for Easter and it was quite delicious. We decreased the amount of mustard and sugar since it was a smaller ham, but kept the amount of glaze the same. It turned out wonderfully!

I just made this dish for Christmas dinner, and everyone loved it! I used a 7 pound boneless ham, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I served it with twice baked potatoes and the apple, dried cherry and walnut salad from this site. A perfect holiday ham, nice looking and very flavorful!
