I have made this recipe for the past couple of years and everyone always requests I make it again. It does not detract from the natural flavor of the yams!!

this was good for the crowd but....: i couldnt simmer it for 10 minutes since it was bordering on burning. as soon as i tried to combine it with the yams the butter mixture turned into one giant caramel lollypop and stuck to the spoon. i ended up melting it again over a double pan and then added the chunks to the yams, tossing it as it baked as to re-melt it completely. the end result was still good. i still think these differences come from the ingredients i use in my country.

This was so easy, and everyone at the table enjoyed it, even the veggie-haters. Easy and tasty, what more can you ask for? Healthy? Oh.

Fantastic and easy. Made just as the recipe was written, although chopped my potatoes fairly small as I was short on cooking time. Dinner guests loved it, and it is going to be one of my Thanksgiving offerings.

This is a wonderful sweet potato recipe. Although I don't usually add a sweet potato dish for Thanksgiving, I made it this year, since we are now living in the south (North Carolina)and since we were hosting 4 Marines from Camp LeJeune for TG dinner----they loved it!! Sticking to the southern theme, I used bourbon instead of Scotch, which I think is much more appropriate for the overall flavor. In the future, I might try adding hot spices like chili powder, cayenne, cumin for some extra kick. Raising the oven temp may help the carmelizing process, especially if you are roasting a large quantity. Using a flat roasting pan will also help.

Shoubi.. you can pretty much assume they are talking about sweet potatoes, though many here in the states use "yam" and "sweet potato" almost interchangeably, whether botanically correct or not.

Not a review, but rather a question--is this recipe calling for the use of sweet potatoes or yams? They are not related in the least (yams are tropical--most people stateside have never actually eaten them) so putting them both in reference to one another is a bit confusing. I'm assuming this is for sweet potatoes?

These were very good. I used Captain Morgan private stock instead of whiskey, I think this made it sweeter, but everyone liked it a lot. It made a good companion to the maple peppercorn chicken.

I added fresh rosemary and doubled the whiskey, honey, and sugar. Also, this took almost twice the time shown in my oven. Really nice change from gooey yam casseroles that compete with the pumpkin pie.

This was excellent. We had it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. We made it again and loved it the second time as well. I brought leftovers to work and another coworker, skeptical of the idea of sweet potatoes with pepper on them, raved after just one bite. We didn't get them very caramelized, but our oven temperature is a bit unpredictable, so I don't know what to recommend for a good oven.

I also made this for Thanksgiving and my family LOVED it! I did leave it in a bit longer to carmelize.

I made this for Thanksgiving. Used regular honey. Did not carmelize but made a nice sweet sauce. Everyone liked the flavor...added a bit more whiskey.

Served at Thanksgiving and got rave reviews. We were all disappointed there weren't any leftovers. We did use wildflower honey, which was a little milder, and I imagine that controlled the strong honey flavor. Everyone asked me for the recipe afterwards.

Not thrilled with the amount of honey, which seemed to overpower the sweet potato flavor. Recommend increasing the temperature to 400 to better caramalize the potatoes.

Great if you want easy; not great if you want interesting. Prepared for group of 30 adults and 15 kids. Easy to double, but dish never glazed and took just over 1 hour to cook. Both issues could have been the deep dish I used to hold 6 lbs of potatoes. Not quiet sure why recipe specifies wildflower honey, since it tasted the same to me as regular honey.
