Delicious and juicy! Used a pork tenderloin and cut into four strips (lengthwise). Used the pork in a stir fry with rice noodles. Will make this again definitely!

Easy to prepare and tastes great. We kept the tenderloin whole and grilled it for a little longer than 30 min. Served with vegetable fried rice and garlic sesame green beans,

This is excellent!! I doubled the marinade recipe and used a 2 1/2 pound pork tenderloin roast. I soaked it in the marinade for about 6 hours (I lightly scored the roast so it would absorb the wonderful flavor of the marinade), then roasted it whole. One word of caution; use a meat thermometer. It took considerably longer to cook than I anticipated. My husband loved this!
