I'm not exactly sure how some of the reviewers found this dish less than appealing. My husband and I made this Sunday and it is quite good. Following recipes for other risottos, we used chicken stock only (no water) while cooking. And the herbs we used are from our garden. We both loved it!

I thought this was a beautiful and very flavorful recipe. I did not think it took too long. I use it as a main dish with a vegetable side. Delicious.

This was a little disappointing and bland. With all of the flavors in it, I thought it would be better.

As excited as I was seeing the ingredients, the flavors just didn't work well together. And the 20 minutes of stirring just wasn't right, but that's risotto. I was naive to think it would be ready as quickly as the recipe led me to believe.

We were disappointed with this dish. We are risotto lovers, and have made many different risotto recipes. This recipe has many of our favorite ingredients - basil, spinach, garlic, leek, white wine and parmesan chees - but it wasn't as good as a lot of other risotto recipes we've made. We won't make this again.

I thought that this risotto was only okay, given the amount of time that any risotto takes-- but the next day I thought that it was very, very, good,and by day three it was delicious! The flavors need to to set and meld-- once they do, it's really a noteworthy dish.

The beauty of risotto is that you always start at the same point but can end up in so many different flavor profiles given the added ingredients. Recently I have been looking for more vegetarian versions of all my favorites (brothers new girlfriend is a vegetarian&will eat cheese thank the gods), so found this recipe. I was not disappointed. This was as good basic risotto, but with a great herbal combination. I thought at the end I might like a bit more basil flavor and a touch more acid. I will try a bit more basil and little lemon juice to finish next time, but didnt change anything this time. Unlike others I never review a recipe unless I have cooked it as written, so my review is based on the recipe as written.

My first time making risotto and it was delicious. My dinner guests could not stop raving. My only complaint is that it takes too long to make and this risotto was to be served as one of three side dishes (Not to mention, I had two entrees to accommodate for my guests diets). I definitely plan on making it again but next time I plan on serving it as a main dish - Too much work and ingredients to only be served as a side dish.

This is a wonderful (and very flexible) risotto recipe that of course takes time. It's also a beautiful color which makes an ideal base for grilled salmon. I just served this as a side to Christmas Eve dinner topped with fresh mozzarella (a gift) and lightly sauteed grape tomatoes. Lovely green and red colors.

Was a very easy risotto to make for all the flavor it packs! i made extra herb past for a bit more flavor and added 2 big cloves garlic. i used a combo of water/chkn/veggie stock b/c i had a little of each i wanted to use up - ended up using 6 cups total of broth. doubled the wine and it was extra yummy. i also added 1-2 vineripe tomatoes and some dried porcini mushrooms i had on hand to make it extra meaty. very yummy! and didn't take that long!

I used 4 cups chicken stock, .5 cups water...this worked well. Also sauteed fresh mushrooms with the leeks. A nice addition.

I was really happy how this recipe came out. It was very easy to make, and I plan on making it again. I did make it with shrimp and I think it adds a lot to the dish.

Perfect as is! I served it with a phyllo wrapped fish on top and a orange reduction sauce, my guests loved the risotto!!

This recipe is very good. It's a relatively easy risotto to make, and it's full of fresh flavor. The herbs were acually so strong that they almost tingled on the tongue, but not a bad way. I served this with the sausage-crusted lamb recipe from this website, and my family loved it. P.S. To all those who have complained that this recipe takes too long to make--don't make ristto if you have a problem with this. It's the way risotto is. The slow adding of flavorful liquid is what produces the creamy texture or ristotto. If you don't feel like standing at the stove, then don't make risotto.

This was a fantastic risotto. It was sooo good. I added more wine for additional flavor. The only problem is not the recipe's fault -- it takes forever.

This was my first risotto and it turned out wonderfully. I made shrimp skewers as recommended and now this is one of our favorite dishes. (For shrimp skewers used deveined tail-on shrimp, about 5 to a metal skewer, sprinkled with fresh-ground salt and pepper, added a little olive oil, and grilled 3 minutes per side. After cooking, I sprinkled extra finely chopped basil and it. parsley over, perfect with the risotto)

This is delicious!! It is also really beautiful with the herb puree. I served this for a nice family meal with salmon and it got great reviews. I too used all cx broth and the flavor was rich.

This was my first risotto. I thought it was great. It wasn't too difficult to make, i followed the directions exactly with the exception of substitution of shallots instead of leeks (I didn't have any). It was VERY rich, and I was surprised at how the rice absorbed all that liquid. I can't wait to try making other risottos. This one was a good one to start with. Very rich and flavorful. A wonderful dish when fresh herbs are abundant.

I make risotto all the time, and was happy to find this variation to add to my repertiore. It has great summertime flavors. The reason I only gave it three forks was because there are a few changes to make this recipe successful. Like other readers, I used all chicken stock (homemade) for full flavor. The boxed stuff works too, but homemade is worth time and effort. I also added a shallot in with the leek and fresh halved cherry tomatoes from our garden for color and flavor. This was a great, simple weeknight meal with the lemon garlic chicken skewers.

I thought this was a little bit bland. It would be good as a subtle side dish but definitely not as the star of the meal

This wasn't the most fantastic risotto I've made but I think it would've been better if I'd read the advice below about using all broth instead of broth and water. We briefly marinated some skewered shrimp in olive oil, s&p, dried marjoram and fresh tarragon before grilling to put on top and that made a great compliment and a full meal. I'll give this another go with more broth next time.

Beautiful risotto! I also made with all stock, and did not have parsley, so substituted a mix of other herbs (thyme, rosemary, chives) - delicious and easy to make. I also used a spoonful of the herb paste, mixed with olive oil, to toss with shrimp which we skewered and grilled.

What a beautiful risotto! Wonderful fresh taste. I used all chicken broth instead of water and the flavor was rich and full. Was pleased that the basil flavor was more subtle than a pesto. There was no need for additional salt. Using arborio rice results in a lovely creamy dish.

This recipe really showcased fresh basil and parsley, while the risotto was an understated base. It worked beautifully with grilled swordfish. The next day I made risotto pancakes with the leftovers- great again!

This was the first time I've ever made risotto and it came out beautifully! But it seemed to have taken longer than 20 minutes to boil in the chicken broth. I also used medium brown rice and since it absorbed all the broth, it was just as delicious as using white rice! I served the risotto with halibut and both my boyfriend and roommate loved it.

I made this tonight and the only change I made was that I needed 3 Tbsp. of oil to saute the leeks. What a wonderful risotto! I served it with sauteed ahi tuna and it was myfavorite risotto ever.
