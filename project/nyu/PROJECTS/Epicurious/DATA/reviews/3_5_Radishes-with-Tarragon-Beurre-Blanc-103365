We loved this! It had a lot of flavor. We had it on thinly sliced bread with thinly sliced radished on top. So yummy.

We couldn't stop eating these. As my husband said "it's like eating pretzels"

I enjoy eating radishes. The beurre blanc is also great spread on slices of french bread with the radishes placed on top and sprinkled with salt. Delicious!
