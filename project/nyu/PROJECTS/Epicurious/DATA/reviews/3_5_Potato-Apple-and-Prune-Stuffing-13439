This is our traditional family thanksgiving recipe that everyone waits for each year. I first saw it in the magazine and have been making it since. We cook the stuffing separately and baste with turkey drippings, and can control how dry or mushy it becomes. I make it as in the recipe, and in a pinch store bought stuffing is fine and already seasoned instead of bread.

I LOVE this recipe and have made it many times! The prunes and apples are wonderful, though I could do with less potatoes. The turkey and port wine gravy from the same issue is great too!!!

This recipe is wonderful. I have made it every year since I first tried it in 1997. Doubling the amount of bread crumbs helps with the texture.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving. Browning the potatoes can be a bit tricky, but don't let that stop you!

This recipe was such a hit with our family that it has been our "family recipe" since I first tried it in 1994. The parsley is a HUGE typo; it should be 3/4 cup not 4 cups, and 3/4 cup is still plenty. I substitute raisins for the dried prunes--they're easier on the kids. I also substituted apple juice for the port one year and that turned out pretty well too. This recipe is drier and "chunkier" than many, but our family doesn't like mushy stuffing.

Nice and unusual, but I used a mix of dried apricots, prunes, and pears and reduced the amount of parsley (the suggested amount is really excessive!). I liked the flavor, but the texture was a bit odd and chunky. Next time I'll use double the breadcrumbs; perhaps that will mend things.

This promised much but delivered little. The recipe itself is a little suspect -- words were missing here and there; and 4 cups of stock for the gravy and 4 cups of parsley for the stuffing seemed too much. It didn't mar our Thanksgiving supper, but next time I'll choose another.
