This is a terrific recipe. I sub nonfat Greek yogurt for the mayo, but keep the rest the same. Healthy, tasty, fresh, does make a ton. Great for a summer picnic or brunch party.

I served this at 4th of July party and it was a huge hit!

Loved the slaw, Loved the fennel seeds! My guests raved about this departure from the usual slaw. The dressing is delicious and makes the dish. Immediately after tossing in the fennel seeds I remembered one of my guests doesn't like fennel but it was too hard to pick them out, so I figured she'd likely pass on the slaw, but she enjoyed it and said that the fennel seed flavor wasn't overpowering and was just a nice hint in the background. She ate seconds. My slaw wasn't soupy when served 4 hours after making it, but the leftovers were a bit soupy the next day (still yummy). If I were concerned about this, I could draw the moisture out of the cabbage by salting, but I didn't think it was a problem. Will definitely make again and so will my guests!!

I would have loved it if not for the fennel seeds. Next time I'll leave them out.

Makes a ton of slaw. Has a nice mildly sweet taste that was really enjoyed by those who don't like traditional slaw. It is a bit soupy.

I don't really care too much for the tartness of the cabbage, jicama and granny smiths but the dressing balances it nicely. I probably won't make this again but the dressing is a keeper!
