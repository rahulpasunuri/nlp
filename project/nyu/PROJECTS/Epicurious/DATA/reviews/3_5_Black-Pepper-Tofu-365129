Delicious. My husband turns his nose up at tofu, though he's never had it. I cut the butter to 1T -- that's a misprint, right? -- added a dash of sesame oil and cut the pepper to 2T. Perfect.

I made this without all the butter and it was great - and didn't need the extra fat.

I have to admit, I was very skeptical about this recipe. My husband, who hates tofu, tasted it first and declared that it was actually good. I cut the pepper at least in half and seeded the peppers which made the heat just right for us. Although I did reduce the butter to 2 Tbsp., the next time I am feeling indulgent, I will try it with the full amount.

Don't substitute things! The soy sauce mixture is delicious and worth hunting down the different types (plus all together they cost a whopping $7.) After several tries, I did decide to reduce the amount of red chili, but kept the black pepper the way he said. I have also reduced the butter, and will say, it is incredible with the amount called for but if you halve it, you should be fine. Ultimately, moral of the story is stick to the recipe! It's fantastic!

This is a wonderful recipe idea. Most people, including me, need to adapt it to cut down the fire (reduce black pepper) and butter. The basic flavors, however, are remarkable together. And the ratios and ancillary ingredients seem to be malleable. The sparkling presentation of the dish makes it a wonderful option for vegetarian guests.

This is great--IF you make your own adjustments. For example, I assumed the butter was a typo and used 1 tbsp. I used one onion (what I had on hand) instead of shallots. I pan-fried the tofu (that one is a no-brainer). The sweet soy sauce at my local Asian market contained preservatives I try to avoid, so I mixed soy sauce with brown sugar (lots of recipes for make-your-own kecap manis online), and I added molasses to replicate the dark soy sauce. I omitted the other sugar. I used ONE small hot green pepper, and I just ground an amount of black pepper that I found appropriate. Despite all of the modifications required, this is a unique and tasty, and was one of my more successful tofu dishes.

I made a lot of modifications, but it turned out well. I used 1 package of lite firm tofu to make dinner for two. I looked in 2 different gourmet grocery stores in No California. I only found soy sauce, reduced salt soy sauce and tamari soy sauce. I used some soy sauce, tamari and sweet rice wine. I used 1/2 tbsp of butter; 11 tbsp seems like a misprint. I only used 1 red pepper and 2 large shallots It was very good but it would have been much too oily and spicy if I followed the recipe as written. Even with the changes, my husband said it was potent (and he likes spicy).

As a nursing mom I had to throw everything out. I like heat and this was over the top. Sadly after almost 2 hours, we were left with eating lean cuisine which surprisingly tasted much better. Also, I didn't think the butter wasn't needed and could have been substituted for something else.

Delicious! All of the "this was too hot" reviews scared me off, so I included less chiles and just ground out pepper until *drat* I ran out - it wasn't quite hot enough for me this way, but still tasty. I used regular soy sauce and added in some Mirin to try and replace the sweet soy. It was still a tad too salty for an everyday dish next time I might try low-sodium soy or maybe some lemon juice or another acid to cut through.

This dish is excellent. My only quibble is that the recipe doesn't warn of the high volume of heat all of that black pepper delivers. I really like hot and spicy food, yet I nonetheless half both the chillies and black pepper, and the result is still nice and fiery. When my asthma has been acting up and I've had a yen for this dish I have even compromised by adding one chilli and one Tbsp. black pepper, even that packs a full punch of flavour. I usually make this by cutting half of the butter amount with sesame oil; I'm not all that concerned about the butter quantity but sesame oil adds a nice flavour to the dish. Sometimes if I want to adulterate the flavours I'll add the juice of between 1/4 and 1/2 of an orange, while omitting the sweet soy sauce.

I love this recipe. My first awareness was via The Guardian where readers are cautioned about the black pepper. It's really worth a read before trying this beautiful dish. http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/oct/25/vegetarian-recipes-black-pepper-tofu

I am not a tofu fan but I was doing a 2 weeks vegetarian thing so I decided to make this. I made 1/2 the recipe and cut all ingredients in 1/2. These are the changes I made. I used 1 red onion finely chopped as I had no shallots on hand.I used regular green finger hot chillis as I had no red ones. I cut the butter in half- used approx 3 tablespoons instead of the 5.5 for the 1/2 recipe.This was NOT a quick recipe.It took about an hour to complete the recipe. But the end result was fantastic. I admit to being a chilli head and the heat and flavour were good. I may cut down on the sugar next time as I dont like sweet food.

We made this following the recipe and it was inedible with 5 tbsp of black pepper! We had to throw the dish away, which was too bad because the fried tofu looked great. If you make this, drastically reduce the amount of pepper you use in the sauce.

As someone who doesn't eat meat, I always look forward for great tofu dishes. This recipe is almost perfect. Even my wife who doesn't like tofu and spicy food was delighted with it. However, I slashed the amount of butter by 1/2 because otherwise it's too much. Will definitely make it again.

Loved this recipe but there is too much black pepper. We have made it serveral times, cut the black pepper by 2/3s and used regular soy sauce. Very good.

I tested this recipe, I made lots of changes in the measurements and items at hand. I used green onions instead of shallots, used chili oil (no chilies at hand), powdered ginger and only used regular soy sauce since it was all I had in the pantry. Despite all the changes, the dish turned out very good, very spicy...i only used about 2tbsp of crushed pepper since I was just testing with small amounts of tofu. I will make it again. This is for those who like spicy food...one can always cut the amount of pepper added to the full recipe.

I have been using Ottolenhi recipes for years and found that you should always reduce the fat content. Beyond that this is a very good dish, but if you don't like spicy food don't make it!

this recipe is great! i've made it several times, but always reduce the amount of butter.

To make this even quicker, I sauteed the shallots &c. in a wok while the tofu fried. It's the perfect method for frying tofu, but the sauce as written wasn't sublime. Tossed in some green beans and tatsoi for some color and textural variety.

This was really good. The cornstarch makes an amazing crust on the tofu. I used 4 Tbsp butter, used the molasses substitute mentioned by another reviewer, and I just ground black pepper from my pepper mill until my wrist got tired, probably way less than 5 Tbsp. I used 2 jalapenos. I also stir-fried asparagus and mushrooms in a separate pan and added them to the plate. I would not describe this recipe as quick at all. Cleaning and chopping all those shallots, garlic, and ginger takes time. There's also a nasty mess to clean up when you're done due to all the frying. I am puzzled by the healthy tag on this recipe, but it's tasty.

I cut this recipe in half, used only two chiles, 1 1/2 TBS of crushed peppercorn and not much butter in a non-stick pan. It was delicious and plenty hot and peppery. I loved the cornstarch dusted, fried tofu and will cook tofu this way for some other recipes. Yum.

I'm not sure how this dish makde it to "healthy selection", because it uses alot of butter. All I could taste was buffer and black pepper. I have to say, it was my very first disappointment of the Epicurious recepies. Highly do not recommend it.

I haven't made this but what the heck is it doing under quick and healthy? Oil for deep frying? 11 TBS of butter? Seriously?

Rating: 4
So, first I'll mention that even though I found this recipe in a search for "healthy", I really don't think this dish qualifies. Yes, it's got tofu in it, but when it's fried and then sauted with 11 (!) tbsp of butter, it loses some of its innocence. That said, this recipe is absolutely amazing! I prepared it as written, but with about 2 T less black pepper and fewer chiles. It was still plenty spicy and had an outstanding flavor. 4 forks, easy.

This was delicious! Per other reviewers I cut the amount of butter in half. Also I couldn't find the sweet soy sauce so I substituted 1 part molasses to 2 parts regular soy sauce and used regular soy sauce instead of light. Next time i would cut down on the peppers as well, it was a bit too spicy. Despite this it was still pretty amazing, would make again!

This was delicious, though I'll make some changes when I make it again. First, the butter could be halved, for sure. Tofu night at our house is generally about fast, fresh, and cleansing. Between the butter and the frying... Second, ridiculous as it may seem given the recipe's title, I'd omit the black pepper. It was my least favorite part of the dish, primarily because of the texture of the cracked peppercorns. The sauce was wonderful enough before their addition. And the green onions? I'd do snow peas instead as a more substantial vegetable presence and to assuage my guilt about all the frying and buttering.

This was super yummy, and both my wife and daughter said it was one of the more delicious things that I have made...It is hard to go wrong when you are deep frying things, and adding 11 tbsp butter. Delicious, yes...healthy???

11 tbsp of butter? Is that possible correct in a "healthy dish." The res of this looks good.

One of those "can't believe I made this myself" recipes. So good! And spicy:) Must admit that I went out on a limb to find the Sweet Soy Sauce at H Mart (giant Asian grocery north of Boston) and it took me, a checker AND a manager to find it in their enormous aisle of soy sauces (who knew there were so many?). I'm thinking it was worth it.

My friend made this dish and it was divine! I can't wait to try it myself. The sauce would also be perfect on fish. I was blown away!

My sweet goodness, this is perhaps one of the finest dishes I have ever made. Perhaps the joy came amidst the sense of relief that dozens of shallots, onions, and cloves of garlic all harmonized to present a delicious bouquet of umami. I used dairy-free butter to make this recipe completely vegan. Aside from much time spent peeling and chopping, this was quick and easy to cook, and wowed every mouth at dinner.

This recipe was delicious! I used tempeh instead of tofu, which gave it a very toothsome and hearty flavor. I didn't have the kecap manis but seem to have managed fine without it. I wondered how it would taste to have SO much black pepper but the sauce was delicious and the flavor was surprisingly well-balanced. This recipe is definitely a keeper!
