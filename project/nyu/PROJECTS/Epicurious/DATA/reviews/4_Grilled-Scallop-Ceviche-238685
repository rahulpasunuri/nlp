super easy and delicious. Served it as main course with pilaf rice with peas. Helps to have very fresh good quality scallops.

Our family and friends rave about this dish. It's fresh tasting and unique. We prepared it for a New Years party and several pot lucks. It doesn't last well overnight, so don't make extra.

Nice mixture of flavours; but feels like it's missing something; especially compared to the last time I had ceviche in Rome.

Really delicious and as good as any ceviche I've ever had (even though it's not really ceviche). It has all of my favorite flavors - lime, chilies, cilantro & seafood. We didn't have any oranges, so we had to use clementines. It still worked out fine!

Great recipe - another variation I've done that comes out great is to toss the grilled (or pan seared) scallops with thinly sliced yellow bell peppers, halved cherry tomatoes, a jalapeno chopped up (as well as some sort of hotter pepper - just a bit of it - habanero is a bit too hot, but something in that range), chopped scallions in place of shallots, some blanched green beans or asparagus, and some of the chopped up oranges. Then add a bit of rice vinegar to the lime juice and olive oil and a splash of juice from the chopped up oranges. And then mix the whole shebang with red quinoa (about a cup dry before cooking) for a great and healthy one course dinner. Comes out great...

Perfect recipe, I wouldn't change anything. It's a delicious combination of flavours, a wonderful and healthy summer meal. All I added was tiger prawns. Yum.

YUM!!! Made as is three times now. Wouldn't change a thing. Wonderful right after it's chilled, not that great the next day.

This was a perfect light summer meal. I served it over baby spinach leaves as the main course. Wonderful!

Added mango to the 'ceviche' and a few shots of tabasco. A huge hit! Even the cats wanted some.
