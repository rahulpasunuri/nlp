i'd have to agree that it's rosemary trout with a side salad--HOWever ... the rosemary trout is simple, delicious, and goes well with the "sauce". you don't need tabbouleh, necessarily--and in fact, if you choose a "traditional" recipe, it might be too zippy. the trout and the "sauce" require only rice, or a simple side to let their flavor shine. IMAO.

I couldn't get whole fish, so I used fillets and surrounded them in the pan with rosemary springs. Came out pretty well! I would recommend tossing the tomatoes into the pan for a minute or two until just softened after you take out the fish & rosemary sprigs. I would also reduce the chopped rosemary in the tomatoes as it ended up being a little intense. I served it with pearled couscous & sauteed zucchini and really enjoyed it!

Based on the suggestions in earlier reviews, quickly sautéed the "salad." This is really easy and tasty. Will make again.

I made this with Steelhead Trout fillets which I cut into individual pieces and baked in the oven. I didn't roast them with the rosemary but did saute the shallots, rosemary and cherry tomatoes briefly as suggested here. It was delicious and a big hit with my guests.

The title of the recipe is misleading -- it's really a side tomato salad and not a sauce. The next time I try this recipe I will add the "sauce" to the pan along with the trout for the last few minutes and see if that works.

I've made this dish several times! So delicious! I tend to get fillets and not a whole fish. I also saute the tomato sauce a bit. I would also recommend roasting the tomatoes! So delicious.

excellent flavor with the rosemary. I omitted the tomotoes as I didnt have them on hand and subbed half a apple chopped and a little more vinegar and shallot! yum! definitely gonna make this again when I come across some more trout.

Great recipe. It is easy, quick and has a great taste. Whole fish always seems intimidating but this was easy. I pan roasted the mix on a medium heat, just until the tomatoes started to pucker (prune). Next time, I will pan cook the shallots & oil, then add the tomatoes, balsamic, salt & pepper. I can't wait to try it on the grill & broiler.

Ok, this is a great recipe. Some changes I made that really helped: I used cod, rather than trout. I didn't want the fishiness of the trout. Also, I roasted the tomatoes fast and hot in the oven in olive oil and then also added some grapeseed (anything mild) to the salad and put that over the fish. Lastly, I made it when israeli couscous with chix stock and a few rosemary springs. Very Mediterranean! Yummm

This came out delicious - having good fresh fish and rosemary is the key.

Excellent and easy recipe. I was surprised at how much flavor this had given the short prep time and few ingredients. My changes: I only used 1 tsp of oil in the sauce and I broiled the fish (4 min each side) per another commenter's suggestion with just a spray of olive oil on each side. Lightened the fat but was still wonderfully flavorful!

Had this for dinner with friends over the holidays who roasted the fish in the oven so even healthier. Yummy!! and so easy. Definitely making this again, in fact tonight. BBQ in the summer would be a great idea.

Very quick, delicious, simple and healthy. Great light fish with subtle, melodious flavors. I am not even a big trout fan, and still enjoyed it. I will probably try with other fish as well!

This is so good and so easy! Lovely for a summer dinner party and a breeze for weekday dinner. I had a half a trout and did it under the broiler because I hate frying fish and it came out beautifully. I sautéed the tomatoes on the stovetop while the fish cooked, just for a minute or two and it was great.

Yummers. Easy as heck, yummy, and healthy. We grilled a piece of trout and just put this on after.

This was a very quick recipe with great results! I will admit that I varied from the recipe a bit (simplified due to ingredients). Not having shallots on hand I used garlic... the sauce came out wonderfully sweet. The trout (a fillet rather than a whole trout) was very simple and flavorful. Overall, this dish was delightfully flavorful, easy, and elegant.

Instead of cooking the fish inside we grilled them over medium hot coals. It was delicious and the rosemary really flavored the trout! I made a tabbouleh from Arabesque and it was a perfect accompaniment.
