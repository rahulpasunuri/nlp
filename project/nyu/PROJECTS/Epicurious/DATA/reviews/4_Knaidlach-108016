I stopped using only schmaltz to make these when at dinner one night an enterprising youngster took bets among his peers as to whom among us would be the first to drop dead into the soup. I pride myself on my chicken soup and didn't want it polluted with someone's face. I ceased being authentic. So now I pay homage to my grandmother's by using a bissel of rendered fat, and tip my hat to my father's cardiologist by filling in with grapeseed oil. Alas and alack, or oy gevalt... take your pick.

I've been making "sinkers" for 20 years til last night when I tried this recipe. Light, fluffy, and absolutely delicious!
