I thought this recipe easy and very good. My husband, who usually will ONLY eat dark meat, actually liked it. In fact, he ate the leftovers for lunch the next day. I would use a little extra prosciutto for more flavor but the caper sauce was perfect. Will definitely make again.

The flavor combination is nice, but I felt this recipe wasn't really worth the effort -- especially the large pile of dishes afterwards.

This was a nice change to add some flavor to turkey. I will definitly make this again.

Didn't have turkey so used chicken tenderloins instead: two tenderloins on either side of 1-2 thin thin slices of prosciutto. I used fairly coarse whole wheat (not Panko) bread crumbs. Some eaters including two teenagers were suspicious of the caper sauce, but it really MADE the dish. Will definitely be making again.

What a geat way to use turkey! This is an easy, tasty week night dinner. I served it with pasta and a light tomato sauce, salad, and crusty bread. Be sure to use Panko crumbs.
