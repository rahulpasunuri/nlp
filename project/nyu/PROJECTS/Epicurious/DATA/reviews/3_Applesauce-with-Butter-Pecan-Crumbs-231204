My review is based on many substitutions. I added brown sugar and cinnamon to the crumbs. I didn't have chunky applesauce so a used canned pears, mostly drained, lightly mashed, then heated up in a pan until almost caramelly. I layered crumbs, fruit, crumbs, whipped cream, and a little more crumbs to make it purty. It was an excellent "cheater's fruit crisp". I'll try it next time with canned peaches. This was the best part of the "Perfect Pork Chop" meal, although I doubt the original would be very good.

I tried it and didn't like it too much. I wasn't sweet enough for my taste.

Surprisingly good for how basic the recipe is! I don't usually like applesauce, but made this for my fiancee and we both ended up loving it. Very nice for an end to a fall/winter dinner.

Nice and quick for a single person. Good!
