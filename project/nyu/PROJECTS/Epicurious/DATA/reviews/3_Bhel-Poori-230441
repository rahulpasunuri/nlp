I have just given a review on papad and this is another favorite of mine. I buy the entire mix from www.indianfoodsco.com and it comes in a bag. The poori is in the mix so do not despair, the sev and rice crisps too. I buy the cilantro chutney and tamarind chutney from them too.

Bhel : Mixture of puffed rice, sev, and other ingredients Poori : Fried indian bread - can be flat like crackers or like shown in the picture . As an accompaniment for Bhel it is like small flat crackers. Hence Bhel Poori is crushed flat cracker like pooris in the bhel mixture. These pooris add that extra crunch to a bhel which otherwise goes soggy with the chutnies. Pooris in the picture are of different variety and are eaten with vegetables, curry or sweet yoghurt etc

The name poori seems to have confused people. The recipe clearly calls for Indian puffed rice also called poori. There is a variety of Indian fried bread also called poori. The picture put up with the recipe is that of the fried bread!

This was excellent! So many different flavors. I don't think the photo was of the recipe given. Finding the ingredients was a little challenging. We used hot & spicy sev, which made the dish spicier than called for. No mater--tasted great.

Where's the recipe for the poori? Kind of pointless without that....
