The poached salmon was wonderful and moist; the peppercorns added a nice taste -- they soften after refrigerating. I did not use the pickle topping, but instead made a sauce of roasted red peppers blended into lemon-mayonaise. Very tasty.

Steelhead is a sea (or Great Lake) run rainbow trout. Trout and salmon are closely related, but are not the same. there are also sea-run cutthroat trout. They are about the same as a steelhead, but smaller.

i have had steel head...head and shoulders above overpriced sockeye!i have heard it is a farm raised mixbread salmon and trout....regardless; it poaches like nothing this side of sturgeon.a good effort but no poaching liquid works without generous amounts of salt!

Your cook from Hailey, ID hasn't heard of our Pacific Northwest treasure called the steelhead. Scrumptious with an herbes de Provence lemon butter.

First of all it was a great recipe. This is to the reader "A cook from Hailey, ID" dated 07/15/00. Salmon Trout does exist. I found it in Alaska and its official name was Alaskan Steelhead. It is a bit thinner than salmon but the taste was similar. I would recommend it to anyone who likes salmon.

To the previous reviewer: Here in Los Angeles every grocery store sells pink trout. The meat of the fish looks exactly like salmon but the outside looks exactly like trout.

What is "salmon-trout"? I thought these were 2 different fish. Are they cross-bred in captivity? I've never heard of "salmon-trout" - its either one or the other. Based on the facts, the author of this recipe needs to do some research & become enlightened before I will make it.
