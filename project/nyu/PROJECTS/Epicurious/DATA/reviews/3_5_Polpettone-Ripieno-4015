I love this recipe. It's great for a dinner party. You can prepare everything in advance and put it in the oven when your guests arrive. That way you are not in the kitchen while your guests are relaxing before dinner. It is so pretty when you slice and serve it. My friends loved thought it was delicious. I have made it three times.

It was just ok. Won't make again.

This is a very flavourful recipe but I would not bother with the jelly roll process. I had a hard time making the roll up and in the end had to bake it in the tin foil. So it would be just as well served as a layered meat loaf. I gave it 3 forks for flavour but it doesn't rate a fourth fork for presentation.

This is a perfect recipe - one of my very favorites. It is delicious, easy to make, and makes an outstanding presentation. For economy's sake, I sometimes substitute capicolla for the prosciutto.

I used part 93% and part 80% ground beef so it wouldn't be to fatty. I also used three hot Italian sausage links, which were a bit over 1/2 lb (about 12 oz) and didn't add any other spices as some of the reviewers suggested. It was simple to make and everyone loved it.

Yummy and so unique! The eggs really added to the "Wow" in the presentation (and key to keep them whole). I followed the recipe exactly and got rave reviews.

This was a terrific crowd pleaser!! Delicious, easy to make, easy to cook. I took a previous readers advise and only used 3 eggs. Rave reviews from my guests.

I would like to make this, as it sounds good, but I don't understand part of the recipe: "Place eggs end to end in line down long side of roll. Arrange parsley along both sides of eggs". Do they mean to put the boiled eggs at the very bottom of the narrow end of the lengthwise rectangle of meat?? It almost sounds as if one should put them down the sides of the rectangle. Also, should they be chopped or something?? Thank you.

Delicious! Reminiscent of what my mother used to cook, along with other roast on Saturday suppers for friends and family. Howeve, she didn't add sausage, she added ground pork.

Excellent. I used italian breadcrumbs instead of the milk and bread. I also added parmesan cheese and garlic to the meat. I used only four hardboiled eggs, and next time I will use three, cut in half. I also sprinkled grated parmesan over the roll in the last 15 minutes of cooking. It made a nice crust. I will definetly make this again.

This was a winner for me first time around. This recipe is far, far better than the usual Italian meatloaf (which is what this is, after all) recipes. Important to let sit full fifteen minutes, then it slices beuatifully and has nice presentation. I served it with a side of pasta and fresh diced tomato sauce (with just a very little sauce over the polpettone). Great.

I made this for supper last week, had more hamburg and sausage than recipe called for, added garlic and a bit of onion to the meat mix. We had enough for 2 meals, 4 servings each time. I had a pasta side 1st time, 2nd time with mashed potato. Mashed potato was a winner. Will make this again

This was terrific, unusual, not hard to make and loved by 5 guys aged 19-38. Another good thing: there was enough for all of them. I took a reviewer's advice and used raw, rather than cooked, spinach. It cooked as it baked. I also as suggested used saran wrap to roll it up and then wrapped it in foil. I did, however, use the exact ingredients suggested. No substitutions. I served with a green salad and ciabatta, but next time will try something more substantial. Potatoes perhaps. Anyway, there will definitely be a next time for this.

This recipe is great. It's ingredients are simple and widely available, it tastes great and is easy to do. With ingredients like these, how can you go wrong?

This was wonderful! After reading the other reviews, I did use a few of those tips: added garlic and basil to the meat mixture, rolled in plastic wrap instead of foil, used ham instead of proscuitto (because the deli was out). Next time I won't even bother precooking the spinach. Also, why bother slicing the cheese in strips? Who cares if cheese overlaps? At the last minute I also heated up a can of diced tomatoes w/roasted garlic & onions as a sauce. I served it with zucchini sauteed with garlic and red pepper flakes, garlic bread and a salad.

fabulous recipe.I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. Very impressive presentation, sliced and surrounded with italian parsley on a large platter

Wow, this was fantastic. The presentation was unbelievable, and the responses of my guests reinforced what I already knew: I had made a spectacular entree. But I will come clean. I made a few changes. First of all, my fiance hates Italian sausage, so I used 1.5 lbs of 96% lean ground beef and .5 lb of ground pork. I also used only 2 egg whites in the meat mix instead of 2 entire eggs. And no one missed the omitted artery cloggers. I actually rolled the meat up on saran wrap, because I find it easier to use than foil, and then I transferred it to the foil and rolled it up tightly. I think it is wonderfully impressive, and it's so little work for so much reward...everyone should try it.

Loved this one. Easy to make and very flavorful. We're not a big fan of Italian sausage so we substituted portabella mushrooms (diced) for a different flavor. Turned out great.

This is one of our favorites. It's easy to make, d looks good and tastes great.We love it hot or cold. I've shared this recipe with lots of my friends and it is now a standard for all of us. We make it just like the recipe and love it.

Made this for my wife this past mother's day. Was superb hot, anf just finished the leftovers cold. Both yummy. I'm thinking about using this again as an appetizer course, just serving thinner slices

This looked lovely and tasted just awful. I did not like the texture of the sausage mixed with the ground beef and I should have omitted the spinach--love it fresh, have never eaten it cooked. That flavor and smell took over the dish. Yuk!

This recipe was great. Very easy to make and what a wonderful presentation! I omited the spinach but didn't notice anything missing. I served it with Au Gratin potatoes and roasted Asparagus and it was a wonderful dinner. I'm going to make it for the in-laws to 'wow' them next they're over for dinner.

Not only would make it again, it's saved as one of my personal favorites. (And I HATE MEATLOAF!!) I substitute a garlic sausage for the Italian sausage and use cotto ham or boiled ham slices as a less expensive alternative to the prosciutto.

Great recipe! My family LOVED it. I omit the spinach - kids are not crazy about it - and add a scant tablespoon of Italian Seasoning and 1/4 teaspoon of Basil to the meat mixture. Great company meatloaf.

I have made this recipe several times. It taste great and the presentation is unique and appealing. My best friend is always requesting it when she comes to visit from the east coast.

This dish is good the way it is but its great if you just add some of your favorite seasonings. Think garlic salt, rosmary,anything that is not to overpowering as there are some very light flavors in this dish
