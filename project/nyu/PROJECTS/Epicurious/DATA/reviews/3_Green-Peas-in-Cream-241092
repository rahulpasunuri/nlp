Simple, delicious comfort food. These peas will be making an appearance on my Thanksgiving table.

This was a great, last minute side for some fresh late summer peas one night. We skipped the sugar and chose to use fresh chives from our garden and the dish was absolutely delicious! I would recommend using fresh peas over frozen if at all possible because the natural sweetness in fresh peas eliminated the need for sugar - and the fresh sweet crunch married with the savory cream and chives was perfection. We served it with lamb kabobs and homemade taboule (if we hadn't used all the mint in the garden for the taboule i would have thrown some into the peas, as well!)
