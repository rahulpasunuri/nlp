What a keeper this recipe is! I did change to lemon vs orange but other than that I kept everything the same. Tossed with baby arugula & marinated feta, so delish!!

This is excellent! I used lemon peel; did not soak berries but simply boiled 45 mins with perfect results; added chopped yellow pepper that needed using; fresh parsley and basil. Made recipe as written otherwise. Will make for company. And me again!

I used bulghur wheat instead of kamut, added more garlic and capers. It was wonderful. I will definitely make it again. It took a little more work than I thought, but for a potluck dish, it is well worth the effort.

I did not soak the wheat berries and forgot to add the orange peel and bay leaf. I used fresh tuna, poached, and basil. This was delicious and easy to pack picnic fare! It serves 6-8.

Delicious! I used lemon peel instead of orange peel. My husband (who claims to hate capers) gobbled this up. Also, you don't need to soak the wb overnight, just boil for an hour and they're fine. Would definitely make again this summer.

Interesting texture from the wheat berries, which remain crunchy even after long soaking and cooking. The flavors were great- the citrus and tomatoes give it an acid kick, while the herbs give it depth. I used basil, parsely, and mint- seems like a strange combination but it works!

Surprisingly, very good. Has great flavor and texture. I served it over mixed baby greens, but also think that it would be good in a pita as a sandwich. (I used albacore tuna packed in water.)
