Added 1/2 tsp of ground ginger and they were very good and easy. I made appetizer sized 1" meatball servings with a sweet and sour sauce for a reception. Big hit at the party.

Made with a few changes: Added ground ginger to meatballs. Used ground beef instead of veal. Used honey instead of sugar, left out the water in the sauce. Poured some of the sauce over the meatballs last minute while they were still in the oven, let them caramelize a little on top.

I found the original recipe bland however with added garlic, green onion, fresh ginger and a bit of hoisin sauce I was very satisfied!

This recipe was a great starting point for an Asian meatball- definitely lends itself to improvisation. I left out the water chestnuts to save another visit to the shops and instead added spring onions finely sliced, grated fresh ginger and garlic (about a teaspoon of ginger and one good sized clove of garlic) together with a generous pinch of brown sugar. I made the meatballs smaller than suggested (1 tbsp each) and served them as a canape on their own. Delicious, and popular with both young and old!! Think next time I will try them with a thai beef salad style of dressing as a dipping sauce.

Our house loved this recipe. Quick and easy just perfect for a weeknight dinner. I made double the sauce as the rice soaked it all up and it was too delicious not to double!

I'm also surprised to see negative reviews. Note that fresh water chestnuts are awesome in this dish if yoiu can find them - they're in some Asian markets. A more complex dipping sauce using spicy red sichuan pepper oil, scallions and ginger makes a better addition than the simplistic lime sesame sauce.

I'm astounded by the negative reviews, this is one of my absolute favorite go-to recipes! I have made them dozens of times and think you just can't go wrong with these. Other than the time involved in rolling little meatballs, this recipe is very easy, and so delicious! When I take them to the potluck there are never any to take home (so I make extra and freeze them, before cooking, for later)

So disappointing. Meatball lacked flavor, was dry and I had followed the recipe exactly. Sounded so promising......

Nobody at our house liked these. While I was excited to find a meatball recipe that didn't include tomato sauce, these were just odd.

this was gross. the meatballs had very little flavor. the sauce was good but it didn't mesh well with the meatballs.the sauce belongs with something else not meatballs. its a strange combination of flavors. live and you learn.

Definitely a keeper! I used a little over a pound of lean ground beef and half-pound of lean ground pork, replaced the water chestnuts with coarsely chopped onion and used reduced-sodium soy sauce...it was fantastic! The sauce was way better than I anticipated, so I doubled the recipe (using only half the sesame oil called for) and put some on the meatballs before baking and also added it to a side of stir-fried veggies, then served with rice steamed with sesame oil. I found pure sesame oil at my local grocery store and it wasn't that much more expensive, so it's worth it to buy a good quality brand. These would also be great to make smaller and serve as an appetizer for a party. Big Hit!

Yum, made just as written, this was my first time using lamb and they were delicious. Will try chicken next time to make a little less expensive. Turned out moist, we all loved the little pieces of water chestnuts, fantastic sauce.

Have cooked this reipe many times and it is always big hit, I have used ground beef and ground turkey,I did prefer the original recipe and follow instuctions as written.

LOVED these ... as did husband. I added garlic as suggested by another reviewer. Did not have ground veal so used ground turkey. Has anyone tried to make it with ground chicken and/or turkey? I will try ground chicken next time ... might lose some flavour but the fat content of pork makes these a special-occasion dish for us. Also, next time I will try red pepper flakes in the sauce.

This is a wonderful recipe; I've made it several times. Do not cook a moment longer than 15 minutes since they are tender when cooked right but really suffer when slightly overcooked.

This recipe was easy and tasty. A big hit with the family. I skipped the water chestnuts because my kids don't like them and used lean beef in place of the veal because that's what I had on hand. It's important to use top quality soy sauce and sesame oil My guess is those with less stellar reviews may have suffered from imitation sesame oil...it is hard to find the genuine stuff.

These meatballs are light and flavorful and always happily satisfy an Asian food craving. The raw meatballs freeze exceptionally well and are perfect for a quick weeknight meal. Have used veal/pork mixture as well as turkey and both turn out a great product. The cilantro is what gives the meatballs flavor. Don't skimp! I always serve these with sweet rice and lots of the sauce.

Yum! These were really good. I'm not a fan of water chestnuts, but used them anyway and ws glad I did. Great appetizer. I served it with the chicken rice and mango lettuce wraps (on this site) as well as potstickers and rice. Really good!

For those with the question about the "sprigs" - I have the original recipe and that line is indented so that it is clear that the sprigs refer to cilantro sprigs. 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro plus 1/4 cup (cilantro) sprigs

Refreshing, tasty and surprisingly light for a meatball. I did this with ground turkey and it tasted wonderful. Excellent with an herbed couscous.

My family and I loved these meatballs. The combined flavors of pork, sesame, water chestnuts was unusual and delicious. Next time I would make them smaller than the recommended 3 tablespoon meatballs and server with rice noodles rather than rice.

I wouldn't make this again. I had high hopes that it would be tasty but they really were rather bland and the sesame oil (which I like) was somewhat overpowering. Just okay but I told my dh I won't make them again. The kids wouldn't touch them either.

I loved this recipe. I used a little less sesame oil (I don't love it) and fewer water chestnuts. But the end result was perfect. I am making them again soon!

You can also heat the sauce in a saucepan and also add some Thai fish sauce to it.

Agree with chef from St. Louis - YUCK. These had no flavor. The dipping sauce was no help. I even tried drizzling the sauce on the second batch before cooking. These were the only thing left on the buffet table -- I am warning my friends that I think this recipe will dissapoint.

The waterchestnuts and cilantro were wonderful additions however the soy sauce made them too salty. The sesame oil was overpowering as well. I'll make them again but cut way back on those ingredients. Minced garlic would be a nice addition.

I served these as an appetizer. Added chopped scallions and subbed soaked crustless bread for the breadcrumbs. Also I drizzled the sauce over the meatballs BEFORE cooking and they came out glazed and delicious.

Absolutely delicious! I had rave reviews from my guests. I did the recipe exactly as is and doubled it. I served with Jasmine Thai rice and (warm) Edamame soy beans. Top your Edamame soy beans with sesame oil and kosher salt. Next time I am going to add some Julienne carrots to garnish my meatballs and make extra sauce. The sauce is great with the Jasmine rice!!!!

I followed the recipe exactly as written, and these meatballs had very little flavor. Definitely were not a hit at my party- many were left over. Also, they stuck to the pan, so they were flat on the bottom. Overall, yuck!

Made it for a potluck and doubled the recipe using all pork. My only change was adding several cloves of garlic. I used a super easy homemade plum sauce to glaze the meatballs since it didn't seem like the Sesame Lime sauce would be enough. It was awesome.

Loved it! I served it with a Mango/Tomato/Cucumer salad with Rice Wine Vinegar. I also added a Cilantro Paste and fish sauce to the meatballs instead of the chopped cilantro. I used the fresh for the sauce.

Great hit at large dinner party. Can prepare ahead and reheat successfully. Used all pork. Next time will try with half turkey.

We really thought that this was tasty. I couldn't find any ground veal the day I ws making this so I substituted ground turkey...it worked! The only other thing that I would change is that I'd at least double the amount of sauce if I were to serve it with rice. Also, this would be a nice appetizer if the meatballs are made bitesize.

I made this recipe with a combination of ground beef and veal. It was wonderful, even tho I misread the recipe and added the entire 5 Tbs. of soy sauce to the meat. To speed up the recipe I used a hand grater to shred the water chestnuts. Because my son didn't like the "large" pieces of cilantro, next time I will finely chop them. And since I didn't have sesame oil, I substituted sesame seeds in the dipping sauce, drizzling the entire batch onto the meatballs.

Good, but not great. I liked it, but didn't love it. My 4-year old, who usually likes everything would only eat one bite - the cilantro was too much for her. Since there are much better recipes on this site, I probably won't make this one again.

Great meatballs - with minor adjustmetns! I too, dislike cilantro - we call it Coriander down here in Australia. I substituted chopped up scallion greens (spring onions to us!), and they worked well. Also, I used SEMOLINA instead of bread crumbs, soaked in the milk as per recipe. Much less messing around. This trick is thanks to Nigella Lawson and her 'Mediterraenian Meatballs' - diffferent seasonings, but meatballs are meatballs. We love'em. I usually cook them in the oven in a baking dish on a rack, with a cup or so of water under it - gets rid of a bit of fat. Thanks fir this recipe, Epicurious.

This was a very good twist on the Italian syle meatball. They didn't really need the dipping sauce. The cilantro and water chestnuts really made the meatballs taste Asian.

It seems obvious to me that it should read: "1/2 cup chopped ciltrantro leaves and 1/4 cup of (the cilantro) chopped sprigs." I think the confusion is a result of its not all being on the same line, making some people miss the "understood" subject, cilantro. For those of you who don't like cilantro, please know that it is a staple of Asian cooking. But raw cilantro and cooked cilantro have very different flavors. The cooked cilantro is much more subtle. Try it, you'll probably like it!

Sprigs of what?

This recipe sounds real good. When you say 1/4 cup sprigs do you mean cilantro sprigs or something else. For the reply to the reviewer not liking cilantro use flat leaf parsley or nothing else.

To the cook from vt -- I too dislike cilantro and recommend replacing it with finely chopped scallion greens.

what would be an alternative to cilantro? I would like to try it, but without cilantro. Any advice is appreciated
