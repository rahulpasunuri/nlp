I was the only one in the family who liked this. Everyone else thought the tastes didn't flow. If it was my rating alone this would have received three forks.

I did not have the serrano chile so I cooked in chile oil and added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes. I loved it. All the flavors complimented each other.

For me this dish was less than the sum of its parts. While we love every ingredient in the dish and always have them on hand for inclusion in other recipes, I prefer green beans simply blanched and then sauteed with olive oil and shallots.

I tried this recipe. It was a last minute thing and I did not have any mint so I substituted cilantro: I think it worked great. Two-third of a cup of oil is a *LOT* of oil! I only used about a tablespoon and a half of oil for two shallots. Re. the comment from Billings MT on 09/18/04: "I couldn't find a red serrano chile so I went with a green one. Boy was it hot!" Chile vary so much in heat that I usually taste each chile as I chop it (just touching it to my tongue) so I know hot hot it is and how much of it to use. Also bear in mind that chile can be much less hot at the pointy end than at the stem end. Re. the comment from San Diego, CA on 04/13/05: "Haven't tried this yet, but want to let readers know that ready-fried shallots are available at most Asian markets ..." It's true that ready-fried shallots will cut down on prep time, but be aware that the taste is also significantly different.

I made the recipe with 3/4 of a green serrano chile, but otherwise just as written, and it was delicious.

I first thought about leaving out the mint, but I am SO glad I didn't! It counteracts the hot chilies beautifully and adds a great taste to the dish! Fantastic with a mexican casserole or a simple meat.

wonderful combination of flavours...in the future i would garnish the beans with the crisp shallot rings instead of mixing them in as the residual oil on the beans made them lose their crispiness.

I made these and loved them...I was a little confused by the comments from Portland because the way I read the recipe it says to add the beans to the oil after the chiles and saute until heated through... Anyway, they're great and I'll make then again.

If I were to make this again, I would probably stir-fry the beans instead of cooking in boiling water. I would add the beans after the serrano is added to the oil, and stir fry them for a couple of minutes.

I made this last night for a buffet so served it at room temperature. It was delicious -- great combination of heat and cool. Definitely a keeper.

Haven't tried this yet, but want to let readers know that ready-fried shallots are available at most Asian markets -- such as 99 Ranch in California -- in the Thai section. This would cut prep time tremendously!

Excellent combination of flavors and easy to prepare

I loved the combination of mint with the green beans - what a refreshing and "fresh" tasting dish. I've made this twice now - once for Thanksgiving and once as a side dish for a party. Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. The shallots are a bit of work, but are good. For an easy weeknight recipe, I might just use the mint and pepper and skip the shallots.

Very tasty! The fried shallots add a great flavor. I couldn't find a red serrano chile so I went with a green one. Boy was it hot! A little too much spice for my family. Next time I'd half the amount of serrano chile it calls for and would probably be much happier.

yum! delicious and easy. i forgot to buy the chili pepper so i used red pepper flakes instead.

Not bad, but not in outstanding. They were really not special enough to be worth the effort that goes into them.

Normally, I hate green beans, but this recipe has gotten me to love them. The combination of the chile and mint was perfect with the bean flavor. And the shallots added the extra punch for a fantastic side dish!

Excellent! I wish I'd had this recipe when the yard was full of green beans.

I made this dish with fresh string green beans. I didn't use the mint or chilie because of my children, and it came out good anyhow. I did add some freshly squeezed lemon. They loved it!
