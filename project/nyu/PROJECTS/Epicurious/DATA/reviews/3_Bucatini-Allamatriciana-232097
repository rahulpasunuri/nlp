Who cares about authenticity when you have a Rockin' Pasta Dish like this! Because we live near Italy, I DID leave out the garlic, but the rest was as is. Oh, I did let the sauce simmer longer to break down the cherry tomatoes a bit more. And it was fantastic!!! I used a long, very long pappardelle (that I brought home from my last italian trip) and it was just perfect with the silky sauce. Highly recommended! Just try it! You'll love it!

I used this recipe specifically to try out our house cured guanciale. It may not be a traditional amatriciana, but I found the flavors to be very appealing with the garlic and the vinegar. I think everyone needs to put semantics aside and try this recipe as is. Ask your local butcher if they have guanciale, it really is ideal for the dish, perhaps that was the problem with others who tried the recipe. They have guanciale at Fleisher's in Kingston, NY and will delivery to NYC.

Skip the vinegar - I'm pretty sure that it would ruin the flavor. Guanciale is a must, but not too hard to find in an Italian neighborhood. We like to add some sliced mushrooms to this. We also fold in some fresh basil while working the pasta into the sauce. Lastly, I prefer to take a fresh Serrano chile, roast it, then chop and add in place of the red pepper flakes. We prefer the smokiness that it adds and works nicely with the guanciale.

As others have said: Wrong. May be a fine bucatini dish, but Bucatini All'amatriciana it ain't. No garlic. Ever. No fakey, for-the-american-market balsamic vinegar. Not even, or especially not even, the real thing. Just no vinegar at all. Ever. Even onion is controversial. In Rome it's standard. In Armatrice it's simply not done. Go figure. I agree with the reviewer below who refers to the Babbo version. Excellent and authentic (authentically Roman in any case, the Amarticesse may disagree). Finally, never with bacon. Make it with pancetta if you must. But for the real thing seek out guanciale, cured pork jowl. That's how it's done and it is the essence of what makes this simple and classic dish so memorable.

This is not the real one. No vinegar, no garlic at all: it crashes the flavour of the guangiale...

I thought the recipe was even better the next day. I had to substitute unsalted pancetta for the meat.

I think that this is a great recipe for every day meals. This is a regular recipe for me and I encourage others to make it (yummy!)

Lousy recipe. (Vinegar??) Look for the much simpler and far better one from Babbo Ristorante instead. (Google it.)

To answer HULADOG, WE ITALIANS are to say what is and is not correct. This recipe will render a very delicious Al Amatriciana so long as you leave out the garlic. NEVER should this dish contain garlic.

Absolutely no garlic! It has no place in Amatriciana.

A simple and perfectly delicious Al Amatriciana. My only note would be to warn against chopping the onion too finely given the construction of this recipe and the time it takes to render guanciale or bacon. Excellent.

this is far from the authentic recipe. try the recipe from the silver spoon cookbook. it is authentic.

I've had the dish in Italy many times and find this similar. Perhaps when served family style, the pepperocini are added at the end, but for a group or at a restaurant, it's okay to cook it. I agree, no garlic, but yes to the Balsalmico!

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved it. I used pancetta along with pecorino romano, which is saltier and more flavorful than parmesean. I have made this in the past (when I studied abroad in Italy) and the Italians don't normally add balsamic, but I thought it added a nice subtle flavor. Great meal, simple and tasty.

i really love this recipe! it's so flavorful and a little spicy and a little sweet and so delish. my bf is not as big a fan, who knows why, so we only get to make it once in a while....but if he and i ever break up (!) this will become a staple. btw, i use bacon bc that's what we have in the house, even though i feel a smidgen guilty.

Okay, so as others have said, it may not be the most authentic, but as it stands, it's a a good pasta dish with a unique flavor. The bacon and balsamic make a wonderful salty sour addition to the spicy cherry tomato sauce. I made this recipe exactly as written, and thought it was very tasty.

Unbelievably good! Mild pancetta is perfect, and I used 2/3 of a can of diced tomatoes, slightly drained. I was inspired to make this dish after having it on a family trip to Rome earlier this year--my 9-year-old daughter couldn't get enough of it. Do not follow the advice to omit the balsamic vinegar--it is essential to getting the sweet-salty-spicy balance just right. Buon appetito!

Delicious! A very simple recipe that had my entire dinner party clamoring for more. I find it amusing that the Italian reviewers take offense at this recipe. Who is to say which recipe is 'correct'? The results are what are important. Most cooks will modify a recipe to suit their tastes. I used smoked bacon for convenience and doubled the quantity, used two cloves of garlic, and used a small can of diced tomatoes. The results were fantastic. Recommended!

I left out the balsamic vinegar and used Canadian bacon rather than the guanicale or pancetta. Additionally, I included a small diced onion and replaced the cherry tomatoes with a can of Carluccio San Marzano cherry tomatoes supplemented by some additional tomato sauce. It was very delicious, and we just love bucatini.

YUMMY!!!! I added 2 garlic cloves cause my family loves garlic! This recipe had them licking the bowl!!!! Already had requests to make again! This was a winner for my family!

Amatriciana does NOT have any garlic, nor vinegar only onions and pancetta (italian bacon, do not use regular bacon, ever), that's where the sweetness comes from. Also, if made with paste, it will turn out even better. I have been making this sauce all my life and I am from Italy. This recipe is an incorrect one and the peperoncino does not get cooked in the sauce, you add it if you want to afterwards and individually.

I object to garlic, I'm pretty sure there isn't any in the original recipe. To the cook complaining about too much vinegar: the vinegar has to be completely evaporated before you add tomatoes. It acts as a degreaser for the guanciale fat. By the way, pancetta is a good substitute. And 6 minutes cooking for raw tomatoes sound a little too short.

This was a nice rustic dish. 2 tbsp of balsamic vinegar made the sauce too sweet and overpowered the tomato taste. Will cut it in half or leave it out completely next time. The bucatini makes it a very filling meal!

Yuck. This is not a good recipe. Sophia Loren's recipe for this dish (from her cookbook) is really tasty. If interested, you can probably google it.
