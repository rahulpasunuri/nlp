Good, quick and easy:) I wouldn't change anything about the dish except possibly add more vegetables or less noodles in my opinion. I used water instead of broth. I liked it but my husband didn't which is all relative - We probably aren't a very good judge on this dish. We've recently changed the way we are eating to mostly vegetarian and drastically cut down on the high fat cheeses, so our taste buds still need to adjust I think.

The bok Choy leaves soaking up the soy and sesame oil prior to combining the rest of stirfry is SOoo key. I used freshly ground peanut-butter instead of peanuts due to ill preparedness but the meal was STILL a winner. I combined with previously sautéed seitan and served over quinoa.

This recipe is easy and pretty tasty. I like to shake it up a bit and add other veggies I have in the fridge, as well as some Maggi sauce. I also like to use less broth and more peanuts.

Absolutely delicious!! Next time I would add edamame. And I added mushrooms and it was great!

just ok, adding the vegetable stock really takes away the flavor added from the soy sauce/sesame oil/vinegar mixture. If I make this again I would not include the broth.
