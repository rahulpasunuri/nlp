This salad is great. I had to make a few tweaks as we were traveling and I din't want to buy all the ingredients for the dressing and had someone who couldn't eat dairy. I roasted the sprouts and nuts in grapeseed oil. I added cooked pancetta at the last minute sprinkled over the salad. Then I used Brianna's vinaigrette, warmed it a bit in a pan and poured that over everything. People had seconds!!

This has to be one of the best Brussels sprouts recipes I've ever had. SO yummy and a perfect fall dish. The only difference is I used my favorite champagne vinaigrette: 1 garlic clove, finely chopped 2 tablespoons dijon Mustard 1/4 cup champagne vinegar 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoons honey 2 or 3 dashes hot sauce 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil print a shopping list for this recipe preparation Whisk together the garlic, mustard, vinegar, lemon juice, honey, hot sauce, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Slowly whisk in the olive oil until the dressing is emulsified. Alternatively, you can combine all the ingredients in a blender or a food processor and puré until smooth. http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Champagne-Vinaigrette-353469#ixzz2BrfRs800

Delicious! My husband and I both loved this! There is very little I would change about the recipe, except for maybe using a little less oil in the dressing. We also added parmasean and arugula instead of frisee

Fabulous. Used leftover brussels from Christmas dinner ... hubby doesn't care for them but they're strangely transformed in this salad. Added chicken too, for a bit of heft.

Followed this exactly and it turned out great. Everyone loved it, even the brussels sprout haters. Will definitely make again.

Awesome. I have not done it with the Frisee and Endive, but with mixed baby greens and with spinach. It's just as good. I've also done just the brussels spouts prepared from this as a side for Thanksgiving. I love them with the toasted pecans. Yum.

This salad was a hit - I added crumbled pancetta and sprinkled the plates with a bit of extra virgin olive oil before serving. The brussel sprouts were amazing.

Where has this recipe been my whole life? Just finished making this and I am so glad I did. Really the carmelization of the brussels sprout is a revelation. I literally danced when I took a bite. My husband who generally is not a lover of the brussels sprout was amazed at how good this dish was. Try it and enjoy!

This salad is delicious. Roasting brussel sprouts is definitely the way to go.I like to make sure a few leaves of the sprouts fall off in the process to ensure extra crispiness. You don't even need the dressing, although it does compliment the sweetness well. Make this!

This salad is DEVINE! I thought I didn't like brussels sprouts before trying this recipe but I would easily rate them at the top of my veggie hit list now. Also, the roasted brussels sprouts and pecans are delicious on their own.

I used different greens, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Really good stuff - unusual combination. The biggest takeaway for me is the brussel sprout preparation - roasting in butter with the pecans right in it. It was so delicious that I'm using the method to make my brussel sprouts as a side dish.

Delicious! Very unique salad. I wouldn't say I "love" brussels sprouts but when I saw this recipe I had to try it. I will defintiely make again.

delicious vinaigrette, and the roasting brings a wonderful smoky flavor to the sprouts. I didn't think the endive added anything to the mix. would try it without the endive next time.

My dinner guests really enjoyed this salad, especially the combination of the brussels sprouts with the endive. I replaced the frisee with arugula but otherwise made it as indicated. A winner.

I just made this with leftover brussel sprouts, but did it stove-top and with arugula (since we had that in the house). It was delicious.

i prepared this dish as a first course for prosciutto-roasted halibut with fresh thyme. I added a small amount of blue cheese which we loved. for a wine pairing we chose montes pinot noir (chilean) which was stellar with both courses. we will absolutely enjoy this salad again!

Wow, I loved the roasted brussel sprouts! Roasting really brought out a sweetness. The crunchy toasted pecans and the crispy greens made for a wonderful and unusual salad.

An excellent winter salad and the best part of the meal that I made tonight. I added prosciutto which was good but it didn't need it.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and it was wonderful! For such a simple dressing, the flavors are delicious. I saved some of the dressing to toss with mixed baby lettuces.

Made this year for Thanksgiving. Absolutely delicious! I made extra vinaigrette and we have been using as our salad dressing. Also have just drizzled over roasted brussel sprouts!

I made this for a dinner party and everyone enjoyed it despite their initial reservations about brussel sprouts. I used spring mix instead of just endive and frisee and it was delicious!

Delish! I brought it to my book club and everyone raved. I also chopped up some procuitto, browned it till krispy and put it on top of the salad, I thought about a little bit of fig too.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit. My husband usually hates brussle sprouts, but loved this salad. I will definitely make this recipe again.

a great salad. frisee, endive & brussels sprouts were not guest favorites i learned, however they loved it! the vinaigrette is so simple & basic. and due to space in the oven, i had to pan roast the sprouts & nuts. perfect combo.

I love this recipe! Roasting the brussles sprouts makes all the difference in the world- even people that don't like them love this dish. I highly recommend this dish.

I loved this salad and so did my guests! I added the juice of half a lemon to the dressing and sprinkled some Parmesan cheese just before serving, and it was fabulous!

this is a great recipie. I made it with just assorted organic greens...it was surprisingly easy and I will make it again--next time for company. rave reviews from my husband, too!

I used bagged mixed greens instead of the frisee. It was excellent and a surprisingly (for some!) delicious use of Brussel Sprouts.

A great way to start a dinner party. Warm and tasty. It was a little bitter, but I imagine it was supposed to be (my first time to cook the sprouts).

This is a terrific combination of flavors and makes a great fall salad. I had rave reviews about this--even from brussels sprouts haters.

Very good. Dressing good. Toasted sprouts longer, and used less butter.

This is a very nice dish that can be served as either a salad or a vegetable sidedish. It has very nice flavor and textures. It is easy to prepare. I toasted the sprouts and pecans long before the meal and just warmed them before serving with the vinagrette which I also had prepared in advance.

This is a very good salad - substantial and quick and easy. I just use the spring mix from my grocer which has the frisee and endive in it. I used this during the holidays when one might use brussel sprouts as one of the vegetables, but this recipe is much more interesting. Try it even if you are not a big brussel sprouts fan. I have had lots of requests for the recipe.
