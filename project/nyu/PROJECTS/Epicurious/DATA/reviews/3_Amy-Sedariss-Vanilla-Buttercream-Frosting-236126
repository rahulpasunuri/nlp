I love this recipe. It is the PERFECT buttercream for piping. Anyone who is complaining about it being too thick should try piping it instead of spreading it.

The only good point was that my daughter had fun playing with the frosting -- it had the consistency of Playdoh and spread just as well as Playdoh would on a cake.... I made a second batch because I needed frosting in a hurry (daughter's birthday cake.) I followed the advice of previous reviewers and used less sugar and more milk, vanilla and almond extract. It turned out pretty well and I could actually spread it.

For a quick, easy shortcut vanilla buttercream frosting, this worked great for me. I didn't add any flour or cornstarch, but per other reviewers, I started with a small amount of sugar and added more until the desired sweetness was reached. This is very much an adjustable recipe; play with the measurements until you get the frosting you want.

I made this recipe, but changed it quite a bit based on reviews about it being too sweet. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cups, and I added a half stick of butter to thicken it. Some people say they've added flower and constarch, imo, that is a terrible thing to do for a frosting, it ruins it. If you want it less sweet, cut sugar and add more butter. DO NOT add flour to frosting, eww! I also added a very little bit of almond extract, some lemon zing, and a little bit of lemon juice. This recipe is very basic and very flexible. It is too sweet the way it is, frosting shouldn't over power cake, it should compliment it.

While some people may be willing to settle for this "shortcut" recipe, I was really dissatisfied with this buttercream and would likely never use it again. The taste was very bland, and the consistency was good at first, but after just ten minutes was so stiff it pulled my cake apart as I frosted.

Made this for cupcakes. It's so amazingly delicious--and easy. Who needs canned frosting when you can just whip up buttercream heaven in minutes. Got tons of compliments --even from my 6 year old! Used a bit less sugar, per other suggestions.

This is great frosting but I did make an adjustment - I used 1/2 the sugar and used flour to make up the rest of the bulk, oh and added a smidgen more vanilla. Once the blue food colouring was added it made gorgeous Easter Cupcake frosting.

a really good "go to" recipe for buttercream. Used less than a full box of confectioners sugar as it was a bit sweet. Also added more vanilla and milk as it seemed to lack a bit of taste and was a bit thick to spread well.

Simple and a perfect match for her vanilla cupcake.

I agree with the other reviewers - just slowly add sugar to taste. I always add a little extra vanilla extract and I threw in some corn starch and bleached flour to make sure it got to a spreadable consistency. Very easy!

Yuck. Too sweet. Too sticky to work with. No shortcuts for me next time.

This frosting is very good (and I actually had enough for about 36 cupcakes) but it is SO so sweet. Next time I"m going to start with half a box of confectioners' sugar and go from there.

This is the basic buttercream icing I grew up with, and it is easy and good. I agree with the direction to whip it well. To cut the sweetness a bit, I used a little less confectioner's sugar (I made a double recipe, so I used about 1.75 lbs or 1.75 boxes) and made up the volume with a 1/4 cup of white flour and a few tablespoons of cornstarch. This doesn't affect texture in these proportions, and I didn't taste anything other than the butter/sugar/flavoring.

This frosting is perfect for when you are in a pinch, or making a sweeter frosting for the kids. Nothing sophisticated, but it works. A little on the sweet side-

This was a great simple buttercream and so easy to put together. I just put all of the ingredients in the bowl at once and beat - couldn't have been any easier. It was very sweet (I used a 1 lb. box of powdered sugar) but that was what I was looking for! I piped the frosting onto the cupcakes with a star tip and it held its shape wonderfully - I didn't need to add anything.

This is great and will probably serve most purposes for most people. I added Kalhua instead of Vanilla. Very easy to make, don't worry about the precise measurement for the sugar. Just gradually beat in after the milk and butter have been reasonably mixed together. For those who think it is too sweet, there is an "authentic" buttercream frosting that involves making a simple syrup and about 6x the butter called for in this recipe. (you can find it on epicurious also) Choice is yours...in order for the frosting to be stiff and "classic looking" you need to add a lot of butter or a lot of sugar.

We made this frosting to top Amy Sedaris's vanilla cupcakes. It's a very nice frosting, very sweet. Since the cupcakes are not too sweet, this was a good pairing. The consistency was not as smooth as I would like but my husband used a hand whisk instead of the mixer so that is probably why. Let's blame him. We still loved it.

I add creamy peanutbutter , not sure how much. I add as a final ingredient and whip until we like it. This is great on cookies, cupcakes and even brownies.

Love it! I was a little confused by the "box" measurement when I went to the store and found 3 options for box size, but I think she means a 16oz box. I just add sugar until the consistency is thick and spreadable, which makes it very sweet. I agree with other bakers who are saying frosting should be sweet. This is a recipe you can fiddle with and not screw it up. I use it as a basic frosting template, then jazz it up with different additions based on my mood. Tonight I added 1/2 the vanilla, about 1 1/2 tsp. orange zest, and a drop of orange food coloring for fun to frost some vanilla orange cupcakes. I've also added raspberry jam or cinnamon. Have fun and enjoy!

Love this! Super easy, may be a little too sweet for some but I used it on some red velvet cupcakes and it got rave reviews from everyone at my house!

for all in this thread complaining that this is too sweet or that amy sedaris is unqualified -- this recipe is identical to the buttercream frosting that my mother, my grandmother and my great-grandmother, and now i, use on our family recipe for devil's food cake. of course it's sweet! if you want a less sweet frosting, make something else, but this recipe reflects longstanding tradition for buttercream frosting!

Firstly, I love recipes that are; 1) not fussy and 2) adaptable to my needs This recipe (and her cupcake recipe) certainly fit those criteria. This is a good, basic buttercream that you can pretty well do what you'd like with (add other flavor extracts, chopped chocolate, food colors, even a tblsp of jelly/jam if you wanted).

I made it with a little vanilla and 1/4 tsp peppermint and it was perfect for my chocolate cake. I started with 3/4 box of powdered sugar and added to my own desired consistancy. I believe frosting is supposed to be sweet.

I made this frosting for Valentines Day cupcakes and followed the suggestion about just adding enough icing sugar to get the desired consistency. I used about 2 1/2 cups. I didn't find the frosting thick enough when I went to ice the cupcakes - even after leaving it in the fridge for 15 minutes beforehand. It did taste pretty good however with just 2 1/2 cups of icing sugar.

These were a really good basic vanilla cupcake with a good flavor and a nice texture. Easy to make and everyone liked them.

OK, so I made this recipe rather than the other better-reviewed frosting recipes becuase I had the ingredients on hand (alas, no cream of tartar in the ole pantry). I think the trick is to put everything except the sugar into the bowl, start up your mixer and slowly add the sugar until you get to the right consistency. I used about 12 oz of sugar, as opposed to 16.

Don't pay attention to that person grousing down there. Yes, this frosting is sweet. Maybe too-sweet for some. No, Amy Sedaris is not a cook by trade. And no, that doesn't make a difference either way.

Good for "in a hurry kids" cupcakes but too sweet for my liking.

This recipe is right off of the box of powdered sugar! Give me a break! And she gets to call it Amy's Frosting? All over-rated. She's not really a cook, just a celebrity

This is hecka sweet, but certainly a serviceable and quickly-made frosting for a batch of cupcakes destined for kids. I added a pinch of salt, and I think the vanilla could be upped a bit. Without food coloring, it's a lovely ivory color. Next time I would add sugar until the consistency is right, but stop short of a full box.
