I was disappointed at this recipe. The result was just ok. I added garlic to the onions in the last 5 minutes of caramelization. I also subbed asparagus for broccolini. It is better next day, but not good at all the same day.

I had a great cut of salmon, and this dish was fantastic. Sooooo delicious.

I've made this recipe a couple of times. It's delicious and surprising. Who knew horseradish and salmon went together so well?

This is an excellent dish! The flavors are unexpected but delicious. I didn't make any changes except to replace some of the cream with whole milk. I added the reserved cooking water, cheese, etc. immediately after draining the pasta (while it was still hot) and didn't have trouble with the cheese clumping up. It was kind of tedious with all different parts, but I will definitely be making this again anyway.

This recipe is delicious. I used broccilini and chx broth as that is what I had on hand. Very easy to made for a week night meal.

This is one of the greatest recipes I've ever tried from this site. I'm not a huge fan of horseradish so I cut it back a bit and was sorry. The sauce is out of this world. I also didn't use as much salt as it called for and should have. My husband must have said "this is unbelievable" a half dozen times during dinner!!!!!

Made this for my in-laws and was worried about how it would turn out. I let them know this was a new recipe and I had a back-up just in case. My father in-law said it was the best dinner he ever had! I have a few yummy salmon recipes but this was quite tasty. The only thing I changed was using broccolini instead of rabe. Loved it! Making it for my husband tonight. Gave it 3 instead of 4 forks because I couldn't give it 3 1/2. This is a keeper!!

This was very good; I cut the recipe in half to try out before I make it for guests. Did the onions and the horseradish sauce ahead of time. I'll be making this for company sometime soon!

A wonderful blend of tastes and textures. The rapini adds a sharpness to the pasta while the horseradish cream adds punch to the salmon. Brilliant.

Fabulous, and so easy! At $23/lb for fresh, troll caught salmon I was concerned that the sauce would overpower it; it did not. I'm adding this recipe to my repertoire for guests. (For those who may not be aware, for the best carmalized onions resist the urge to shake and stir.)

This recipe was great. Very easy to make and not a lot of preparation involved. End result was amazing!

This recipe is outstanding. I thought the horseradish could be doubled and the sauce would be even better. I also used broccoli and white wine instead of the clam sauce. Next time I will use chicken broth. Don't worry about having orchiette. Use any substantial pasta such as curlies, etc. I would use this dish even without the salmon.

Am going to try this tonight but thought I'd leave this hint behind...Cut up 3-4 sweet onions into thin slices and put them in your crock pot with 1/2 stick of butter ans leave on low for 10-13 hours - the result is the easiest caramelized onions (although the house will stink to high heaven ;)) I package them up and freeze them and use them in recipes, quesadillas on pizza, burgers...

This is a great recipe, but then - anything with broccoli rabe and pasta usually is! Next time, I think we will try it with chicken, using chicken broth instead of the clam juice.

I tried this one because of the rave review from NYC cook. I liked it overall and may make it again but searing the salmon on the stovetop made my entire house smell like a giant fish!!!! ugh! - next time I would definitely broil the salmon in the oven. Remember not to eat salmon more than once a month kids, (unless you can get fresh wild salmon) to avoid those nasty PCB contaminents....

I've had the toughest time getting used to fish. I know it's good for you and I want to like it for the health benefits. This recipe helped the transition tremedously. I've already made it a couple of times and is a summer favorite to serve dinner guests. They all rave about the flavors. Cook the salmon on the grill in summer.

Utterly delicious. The store was out of rapini, so we substituted mustard greens with nice results. Their mild tanginess worked quite well with the horseradish sauce. One slight problem though: adding the water along with the parmesan to the pasta mixture caused unsightly globs to form. I'm tempted to add the cheese to the sauce instead, but I'm afraid I might upset the lovely balance of flavors.

I made this as a "thanksgiving" treat for my mom and dad - it was excellent and we all agreed we would make it again. Onions are time consuming but add a rich, sweet note. Horseradish cream is delicious, worth the fat and calories!

This was absolutely delicious. We couldn't find broccoli rabe, so used small broccoli buds instead which worked great. I also mixed cream with half-and-half to lighten it up slightly, although it is still very rich. The carmelized onions were great. I'll definitely make this again.

Not sure what I did wrong, but the pasta/rabe sauce was gummy and not very good. I have better salmon recipies in my file

To the Cook from Canada and anyone else with seafood allergies, most health food stores carry vegetarian fish sauce and oyster sauce made without any seafood products. If you can't find it, here is a link for a recipe http://www.geocities.com/dpham_001/cooking/fishsauce.html or http://www.recipecottage.com/vegetarian/fish-sauce.html

To the previous cook from Canada - I have substituted clam juice with shrimp broth. In a small sauce pan boil some water or chicken broth with the shells and "goobers" from shrimp. Then run it through a strainer. It freezes nicely too.

I would like to know what you can supstitute for a clam juice in this recipe.We are alergic to it.

Great dish and presentation. Next time I will prepare the rabe sauce and the caramelized onions a day prior. We all enjoyed it quite a lot.

Killer!! We barbequed the salmon which made it even better. I used more rapini and onion and less pasta (8oz) and cheese (1/2 cup) for a healthier mix. It was great and got rave reviews from guests.

This is a very easy, delicious and impressive dish to make! My guests compared it to a 4 star restaurant! The only change I would consider making would be to grill the salmon. I strongly recommend this to any cook.

I loved this receipe. I did substitute another small shaped pasta for the orecchiette since it isn't a pasta shape I'm fond of. For the person who found the amount of dishes to be excessive, I cooked the salmon in the same skillet I used for the onions.

Pretty darn good. The sauce is the bomb(that means it's good). I threw some crab meat in the leftover pasta mix and had a dandy salad it of it for lunch the next day.

This was wonderful, my family loved it. Including my 10, 11 & 12 year old daughters! I found it very easy to prepare, and the horseradish sauce was delicious.

Excellent! I didn't think the horseradish was too much or overpowering. It seemed to be a perfect compliment to the meal. I did have a lot of pots to clean, but it was well worth it!

This was disappointing and too labor-intensive for the result. As something different, it was OK, but nothing to write home about.

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish! It was easy and the presentation looked great. However, I substituted light half and half for the heavy cream. And I will try the suggestion of baby shell pasta intead on the orrichette. I had trouble with the pasta sticking together. Will definitely keep this in my file and make it again.

We loved this dish. It is very easy.I used creamed horseradish and did not find it too strong . I have also made it with baby shell pasta with good results. I would give it four forks.

The onions were a wonderful addition to this, but the horseradish sauce was a little disappointing. I don't think the salmon enjoyed the pairing to the degree of intensity called for in the recipe.

Fabulous (and easy)! The sauce is wonderful and all you have to do is reduce the cream and clam juice by boiling. I cut back on the horseradish. You may want to taste before using all of it. YUMMY!
