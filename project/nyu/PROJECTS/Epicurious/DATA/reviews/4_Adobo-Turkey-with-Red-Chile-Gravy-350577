This was the best Thanksgiving turkey ever. Everyone raved about it. I took suggestions from other reviews and doubled the adobo recipe and used orange juice instead of water. The adobo was aromatic and complex and delicious and gave the turkey a beautiful color. It is not spicy, but flavorful. The best part was the night after, we shredded all the leftover turkey meat and marinated it all day in the remaining adobo sauce and made turkey enchiladas by mixing the remaining gravy with a can of red enchilada sauce. We had 20 people over and they went crazy over it! It was even better the next day. I would make this again -- it would be delicious with any meat. I'd love to try it on pork.

This recipe is a keeper. I quit cooking turkey in an oven and prefer to use my rotisserie on the Weber kettle. You can choose your smoke wood and this recipe is perfect for this preparation. I followed everything to the T. The gravy is excellent and went well with stuffing and mashed potatoes. Will make this again with the half priced turkeys I find after the holidaze.

Here's a quick review and some tips. 1. It is the single best turkey we have ever had, and at least half a dozen family members have asked me if I'm making it again this week. It is absolutely exceptional. 2. It's a lot of prep time. It's worth it, but it isn't quick. 3. Make extra, both Adobo and the gravy. You'll want to use it on lots of things. Good luck.

This is really hard to rate. I kinda wish Epi had a five-fork system. In any case, although the recipe itself was fine, my problem with it was that it just wasn't what I want for turkey. That said, I used the leftover "gravy" to make chicken soft tacos that were out of this world. Here's the dirt: Since it marinated in the adobo so long, I left off the brine (it wasn't in the recipe anyway) and the turkey came out fine but a tad dry. I really missed the brine. If you want to try this recipe, I highly recommend that you add a step for brining the turkey. The adobo was fantastic - some of the best I've ever made. I won't be making it with the turkey again, but I'll certainly be making the adobo. I'll probably go ahead and make the "gravy" since it worked so well with the soft tacos as leftovers. My main disappointment with this recipe is that the adobo didn't really work with the turkey all that well. Still glad I tried it - just not really my thing, I think. I'll stick with a traditional turkey and keep the adobo for other dishes.

Outstanding. Turkey is turkey, but the gravy is incredible. This replaces the recipe for red chili sauce from Sunset magazine that I've been using for over 20 years. I made a lot of the adobo, and made a second batch of gravy (which is more like a sauce)and put it over turkey enchiladas. I used dried pasilla instead of the ancho, which I couldn't find. I also toasted the chilis in the oven at 300 for 5 minutes instead of on the stove.

Yummy! My guests raved that this is was the best thanksgiving turkey they ever had! Flavorful and moist. This one is going to be our thanksgiving turkey from now on. I doubled the marinade as one reviewer suggested. I knew that we would want more marinade on our turkey. I also added freshly squeezed orange juice to the marinade instead of water. Keeper!

I am usually in charge of making the turkey and dinner for thanksgiving at my mom's house. Being from a latin family this recipe really stood out and fit the bill for our family. I did brine the turkey beforehand as I feel that this is essential. This turkey turned out fantastic!!! And the gravy was delicious. I will be making this turkey again this year because of all the rave reviews from the family and of course requests to see it again!!!

I have never made turkey before and decided to give this a try as my first time. I really liked the idea of spicy rub on turkey. And it turned out delicious! Gravy was perfect too, made from the same ingredients. I failed to marinate it with adobo, so I ended up just roasting as is but it still maintained a ton of flavor. Gave me confidence in turkey-making!

This year i thought i'd give my mom a break and prepare thanksgiving dinner at their house. Made the adobo ahead of time to give the turkey a full 24 hours to marinate. The flavor and color was exceptional; Turkey was moist and the red-chile gravy over a basic garlic mash was delicious. Recommend Serving with a chipotle-cranberry sauce and chorizo-cornbread stuffing (which recipes are also from the site.) It goes without saying we will not be reverting back to a conventional turkey, and i've unintentionally become designated Thanksgiving cook next year.

Best turkey ever! We did brine it beforehand because we can't stand the thought of skipping that step. We thought we should have doubled or tripled the adobo recipe for this because it was so amazing. It looked and smelled wonderful while it was cooking and was incredibly moist and flavorful when we ate. We loved this recipe!

I am so non traditional and this recipe was perfect. I love flavor and this turkey was wonderful! My guest all loved it!

This was pretty good, but I think that I prefer the pancetta sage turkey from this site. THAT was the best turkey I've ever had.

We have prepared this dish three times and it is without a doubt, the single best turkey we've enjoyed. We used locally-grown Minnesota farms turkeys and the result is outstanding. I think this rub would be great on lots of differnt types of meat. We will try on others.

We made this for Thanksgiving last year along with a more traditional turkey recipe and all of our guests preferred this version. The turkey turns out so moist and flavorful. We will make it again!

I have been hosting dinner parties and Thanksgiving for over 25 years and this may be the best meal I ever made. We made the entire menu associated with this recipe and everything was OUTSTANDING and was just terrific together. The gravy was exceptional.

The Turkey turned out beautiful and moist. I would have liked a little more heat but I'll adjust that next time (cause I plan on making it again)

We will never go back again...to regular turkey. Made this as part of Christmas (next time I'll pay attention to the recommended sides). Increased the number of chilis to 5 each (for my Mexican husband) and it was not too hot for me. The bird came out just as pictured--which helped a lot to know that was the way it was supposed to come out--and it was moist and juicy. The gravy was so much better the next day, too. Using the leftovers in a turkey salad with some of the spices for added punch. Yes, we will definately make again.

Zoinks -- this was incredible. The gravy was perfect, not too spicy at all. My only mistake was putting out a second gravy for my spice-phobic guests. Goes nicely with the poblano corn pudding from this site. I plan on making this again in a few days for enchiladas -- the gravy really does have a wonderful flavor and should make a great base for a sauce.

This was delicious -- perfectly spiced and the gravy was wonderful too. Give the bird a full 24 hours to marinate, you really want those flavors to sink in. The next day I made roasted turkey paninis with pepper jack, carmelized red onions and chipotle cilantro mayo and those were great too.

This was great. The gravy really made it- and it was a very pretty bird! The cornbread and chorizo stuffing was excellent with this.

I need to add my 4 forks and comments I need to add my 4 forks and comments of Amazing. I made this for Thanksgiving. The bird looked beautiful on the table. The rich mahogany color of the bird was beautiful. The flavors were sublime. I rubbed the adobo marinade under the skin on the breast and thighs, as well as the outside of the bird. We loved the combination of flavors from the spices and the chiles. The gravy was a beautiful shade of red, and accentuated the flavors of the meat.. It was a hit with the entire family. I will definitely make this again.

Amazing! We had to substitute dried chipotle for the ancho and guajillo as e couldn't get those; we all coughed a lot when making the rub but LOVED the hot taste, even our little kids. I would probably never make a turkey any other way, thank you!!

Big hit this Thanksgiving! We used a bone in turkey breast (9 lbs) and cooked for 1 hr on the grill and finished in the oven (covered w/ foil). I also added a bit of cayenne to the adobo based on reviewers' comments. Gravy was excellent and you could really taste the adobo throughout the turkey, it was moist and full of flavor.

Made this recipe for an alternative T-day. Used 2 7 lb. chickens instead of turkey and marinated it over a weekend for service on a Monday. Loved it, particularily the gravy (kids were mopping it up) Some changes i made: I jacked the oven temp to 400 since it was chicken, not turkey. Lilian Chou sure knows how to make an "alternative" to T-day; her Asian Style Roast turkey from last year is another winner i can recommend.

I have quite a few ancho and guajillo chiles left over so I will be making some parts of this recipe again. I think I will bottle the adobo for gift giving. However, I plan on keeping some of the seeds when toasting the chiles the next time. There just wasn't enough heat to this recipe.

This turkey was juicy and good, but the adobo did not seem to add any kick to a traditional turkey.

Its hard to go wrong with anything that uses guajillo chiles and this is no exception! If you are familiar with carne adovada and similar dishes from the Southwest you will love the marinade and gravy. If you are not familiar with such dishes and are looking for something different to do with a turkey, this is a good recipe to try because it offers plenty of flavors and not too much heat. Dont be scared off by how vinegar-y the marinade smells& everything is fine in the end. There are lots of different opinions about the heat to use when cooking a turkey and I used the temperature that has worked for me in the past as opposed to the one specified in this recipe. Use whatever is familiar to you and it will still turn out great.

This is a fabulous turkey recipe. Tons of flavor, not a lot of heat. This was my first attempt at homemade gravy and it turned out great. I'm going to make a huge batch of the adobo sauce and use it on all my meat in the near future - I bet it rocks on pork tenderloin!

Not too spicy as I feared. I love the heat, but not my guests. The perfect amount of warmth on your tongue. I was a bit sketchy on the gravy, but after I tried it I was sold. I marinated for 2 days with a bit more salt and smoke/grilled outside. The flavor was amazing and the meat was MOIST!

Turned out very nicely. Adobo marinade for 10 hrs. flavored the meat well. I was surprised. Smoked a 12lb turkey for about 3.5 hrs at 250f to temperature. Moist flesh, crisp skin. Adobo gravy pairs perfectly with dressing.

Oh. My. Goodness. I've made this twice since I got the November 08 Gourmet. It's easily my new most favorite thing to put in my mouth ever. EVER. We didn't do a whole turkey - just a half breast, but we used the full amount of adobo. It made oodles of the adobo gravy which goes absolutely perfectly with the cornbread stuffing that goes with the recipe. I would easily make this again and again!
