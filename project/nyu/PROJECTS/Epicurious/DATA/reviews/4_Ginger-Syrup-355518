Delicious. Does have a lot of bite though. For a somewhat milder syrup, first add the ginger slices to cold/room temperature water, bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer for 3-4 min. Drain the water, then proceed with the recipe as written.

to make leftover ginger into candied ginger: Preheat oven to 200°F with rack in middle. Set a metal rack in a 4-sided sheet pan. Arrange ginger in 1 layer on rack and dry in oven until dried but still pliable, 2 to 2 1/2 hours. Cool completely. Candied ginger keeps in an airtight container at room temperature 1 week.
