This soup is so delicious as is. I do put a little less than half the cream in, but it is spectacular. I brought it to a friend whose son is ill, and she said she wanted to lick her bowl. Both my three and five year olds love it, and it is so simple to put together. Highly recommend!

I used regular celery, as other reviewers suggested, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. Maybe I'm just not enough of a celery fan, but to me this soup simply tasted like salty pureed celery. It also had a very unappetizing color, kind of a washed-out sludgy swamp color. My boyfriend kindly refrained from commenting on the soup until the end, but we both knew what was wrong: one fork for you, celery puree.

I'm usually not a fan of celery, so I was surprised how much I liked this soup. I didn't have leeks or shallots, so I just used onion and garlic. Didn't peel the potato, and used a hand blender to puree the soup. I didn't bother straining because we like texture, but would probably consider it if I was serving it for company. Even using my on-hand ingredients, this was delicious and a great way to use leftover celery.

I got rave reviews about this soup. Everyone thought it an elegant start to a summer evening meal. Served it cold. I did sieve the soup just to try it out and the velvety smooth texture was wonderful

I too used regular celery, but added a head of fresh roasted garlic to the saute before adding the wine. The house smells heavenly! Will serve with cayanne gruyere bread sticks. Yum

This soup is sublime. Left out the potato. Did not add any cream. Had no leeks so used one and a half cups of shallots and a tad bit of onion. Used Rapunzel Vegetable Boulllon. Did not strain.My Vita Mix made it creamy and smooth. Wow this is good.

This soup was great. I made it with regular celery and didn't strain it. I found the texture and taste to be really pleasing. In the future I may use a little less cream than the recipe calls for since the finished product was extremely creamy--I don't think it would suffer if a little less cream were used.

Really, really yummy. Fairly simple to make. I used regular celery too and did not pour it through a sieve. I don't mind the texture, in fact it is healthier and more substantive. I used veggie broth in stead of chicken broth and it is delicious. I definitely recommend this soup.

Made variations of this and the "cauliflower puree" recipe. For low-fat, lactose-free alternative, skip the butter and heavy cream, and substitute cauliflower for the potato (I used a whole head). I've varied the amount of wine and broth depending on whether I wanted more of a soup or a mashed potato-like dish. Seasoned with dill. Was easy, hearty, and delicious!

I also used convential celery and did not sieve. I also used one onion instead of the leek and shallot. I added 1 tbs. fresh dill to garnish. Very easy and delicious.

This is delicious and easy, if you don't sieve. For a hardier and healthier version, I do recommend pureeing the soup in a blender after the celery has softened, but why sieve out the good fiber??? That's the problem with modern diets - no wonder our heart disease and cancer rates are so high. I also used conventional celery; next time I may try Chinese celery.

YUM! This was easy and tasty. I also used regular celery. I used an oval wire mesh sieve that had extender 'arms' that expanded over a large bowl in my sink. I poured the puree into the sieve, moved the solids around, then disposed of them. A keeper!

I tried the recipe using Chinese celery. There was quite a strong celery flavor. I think I would have liked the recipe better using conventional celery like the other reviewers.

Everyone loves this soup even they normally have other kind of soup on regular basis. "This could not be found in other places" claimed one of the guest. It is also quite easy even it took quite some time to soften the celery. Anyway the result worth the efforts!!

Like the other cooks, I used regular celery for this soup. Also, I didn't peel the potato. The finished product looks good with the tiny bits of potato skin in the soup. Plus I love the flavor that a potato peel gives. I made it for my family, and another family, who LOVED it, and asked for the recipe. My 3 year old, who loves celery, but usually won't eat soup, liked it, too.

I have made this soup twice now using regular celery with great success. Delicious first course for any Asian-inspired dish. However, I really would like to try it using the authentic ingredient it calls for. Is there another name for chinese celery? I saw something that resembled what other reviewers describe, but it was called something else in my nearby market that caters to Mexicans.

Despite living in Japan, I was unable to find the Chinese celery and used regular celery instead. The flavor was still pretty good, but I think next time, if I still can't find Chinese celery, I will use bok choy. I've used it in soups before with good results.

The Chinese celery resembles cilantro (cliantro is aka Chinese parsley) in its stems and leaves but the stem is about twice the size in length and 1/2" in width. While the stalk of the celery is hard and has little leaves, the stem of the Chinese celery is pliable and leafy like the cilantro. Also it has a stronger flavor and taste than the cilantro or the celery.

Kate, I use silken (very soft) tofu, and blend it into soups. No lactose, no thinning of soup and lots of added calcium, soy isoflavones and other things that are good for me. What is Chinese Celery??? It sounds like cilantro. Anyone know for sure what it is? Thank You!

Really delicious! I used half chinese celery and half regular celery cause that's what I had. After tasting the soup, I didn't feel the need to add any more cream to it, it was heavenly as it is. I ran the blender for a while and didn't have a problem seiving. I used some herbed croutons from this website and that made it even more delightful. A dish like this makes me want to organize another dinner party soon. Keeper recipe for sure.

Quite nice with a subtle flavor, although (as other reviewers noted) the sieving takes a long time. Sieving also reduces the amount by half, I found, so it ended up being more like 4 servings.

I couldn't find Chinese Celery so I just used regular celery and I put in 1 Cup of Pinot Grigio wine instead of just 1/2 C. I also used my Braun Puree wand and just pureed the whole pot and didn't bother to sieve it. Also didn't do the croutons...just crusty French bread and butter. It was to die for! Now I'm gonna try it again with Chinese Celery. Can't wait.

This soup is great!!! It was very easy to make and the taste was very delicate. Sieving took a long time but it's worth doing it because the celery is very stringy.

Kate, as I'm sure you know, fat has nothing to do with lactose intolerance. You need soy milk. I've tried many brands and the ones I like the best are VIta Soy and Eigth Continent. Rich's a;so makes a whip cream that you can use, but it's total junk as far as ingredients. I feel good about using soy milk in my recipes because its healthful. If you don't think it's creamy enough, you can add a tablespoon or so of soy butter. I get positive responses from people, and no one knows its not real milk/cream. (Just make sure to use regular/original, not vanilla!) Leah

For Kate - If you haven't yet found Land O'Lakes FAT FREE Half & Half, you'll be amazed. The carton shows 10 calories per Tablespoon, and 10 carb. grams per 2 Tbsp. All others on label are 0%, and it's really fine in your chowders and cream soups, especially.

I'm lactose intolerant and cream KILLS me, does anyone out there know a fat-free low-cal alternative to 1/2 and 1/2 or whipping cream that can be substituted one for one??
