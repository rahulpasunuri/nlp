A bit of work but more than worth the result. Everyone in my family absoulutly adored this recipe and we will without a doubt make it over and over again.

Quite a bit of preparation work; however, the end result is superb! Stick to the ingredients and all works out well. Great dessert for my honey!

A bit disappointing and a lot of effort for minimal taste. The bread to filling ratio seemed a little off but could be remedied by dividing the filling into four ramekins instead of six. I searched high and low for sour cherries and never did find them but the sweet ones seem to work just fine.

I found this a bit disappointing. It was good but not great. I did follow one other reviewer's recommendation and assemble it several hours ahead and refrigerate. That did seem to work fine.

Served these at a Winter dinner party for 8 with one guest a professional chef. She had not had time to review the January issue of Gourmet and asked for the recipe. I was good and gave credit to Gourmet. Great for chocolate lovers.

Made these for New Year's eve dinner and really enjoyed them. The recipe is fine as is with no changes - the cherries could be replaced with almost any fruit that can handle the heat. Would definitely make again. Everything can be assembled and stored in the refrigerator well in advance and then baked just in time for dessert.
