Finally found a keeper! This is a very special cranberry sauce and I think it is the candied walnuts that really make it as well as the roasting process. Was delicious with our turkey dinner yesterday and then on a homemade roll with turkey last night! Only sub I made was with the walnut oil, I used grapeseed, will make this next Thanksgiving, God willing!

Lovely flavor and fairly simple to make. Mixed in the bowl, as recommended, but had to substitute grapeseed oil for the walnut. Otherwise, as written, and wouldn't change a thing. If you bake the walnuts on parchment (not wax paper) as directed, you shouldn't have any problem removing them and breaking up any clusters. Will definitely make again next year!

Awesome! This will be my yearly cranberry sauce from now on. The candied walnuts are to die for and I think I may make them just to nibble on.

Beautiful Recipe! I didn't have walnut oil, so I used one tbs olive and 2 tbs sesame. Turned out great. I also didn't have fresh thyme and used 1/2 teaspoon ground instead. Lastly, I didn't have time to make the walnuts, so I purchased Candied Walnuts and Pecans from Trader Joes. I preferred the pecans so I chopped and used those. Worked out great!!! .

Exceptional! I made this last year to rave reviews. I burned my first batch of walnuts and got it right on the second batch. I was wishing I had made a third batch just to snack on. I am going to make this for my birthday party and put the sauce and nuts on some brie for an appetizer. It will surely be a winner!

Christmas dinner 2010... This was awesome sauce, pure and simple. Grandpa went ga-ga over it. DON'T roast the walnuts on waxed paper unless you are willing to remove them pronto or you know magic.

I received several compliments on this recipe after serving it for Christmas Dinner 2010. It is crunchier than traditional cranberry sauces (even without the nuts) and has a different but nice flavor.

Rave reviews! I think it's better to not mix the ingredients on the sheet pan but in a bowl. I used silicone liners and that worked great. This recipe will become a tradition in our family.

I have lots of cranberry sauce and chutney recipes from the years, but this is my new favorite. I loved the chewy texture of the roasted berries, and the contrast with the crunchy walnuts is a really nice touch. This would be very good with roasted pork, too. Highly recommend.

I usually don't care much for cranberries, but this was a terrific flavor, and the family favorite this Thanksgiving. A good blend of sweet and tart. Easy to make too. I did roast the cranberries directly in the corning ware bowl I used to serve them in and it worked out very nicely.

Though some call it conventional, jellied cranberry sauce isn't exactly flavorful. A new cranberry sauce formula could possibly be precisely what you need this winter holiday. Your cranberry sauce recipe ought to be more than just a red jelly. There are multiple ways you could approach a cranberry sauce formula and pull even more flavor out of this Thanksgiving side dish.

Fourth Daughter made this for Thanksgiving - and it's a real keeper. One of the very best of a number of cranberry sauce recipes! Even Spouse, who is not all that fond of cranberry sauce, loved it.

Well balanced flavors. Oven roasting cranberries had great depth. A definite keeper.

This was the best cranberry sauce I have ever made or had!! Made it as written. Watch carefully the roasting walnut time. Enjoy!

I roasted the cranberries this morning, and wow! What a delicious aroma! I made a double batch, one to take to a friend on Thanksgiving and one to serve at my dinner on Saturday. I realized after beginning that I only had enough white sugar for one batch, so I made the other batch with brown sugar and then combined them. Great taste! I'll do the walnuts later today. The only thing I would change is that I would NOT line the pan with foil, and I would mix everything in a bowl before hand. When I mixed the ingredients on the foil covered pan, the foil tore, so I ended up picking bits of foil out of the sauce. The cooking times and temperatures were fine.

I made the whole recipe as written and it was perfect! Rich and savory. I think the roasting time is correct.

I made the Cranberry Sauce half of this recipe and it turned out wonderful. The berries get concentrated and the texture is fantastic. The cooking times seem to be in error - probably 5 minutes (instead of 15) for getting the berries and sugar started, then another 10 with the wine is all that is needed. Mixing berries and sugar on the plan worked out better than I expected and "stirring them" on the hot pan worked out fine with a flat wooden utensil.

Finally completed the recipe and thought it was pretty good. It provided a twist to our conventional cranberry sauce. Would probably cut back on the walnuts as there seemed to be too much of them.

Can't rate this recipe yet as i haven't added the walnuts. However, had some thoughts on the cranberry part. I mixed in the pan and would recommend this be done in a bowl and then put in the pan. During the first round of roasting, much of the sugar and juices went to the side of the pan where they burned. I would shorten the cooking time and put them in a smaller pan. After adding the wine, I only cooked for about five minutes as the cranberries were way done. Think the roasting times are too long. The cranberries seem to have a good taste.
