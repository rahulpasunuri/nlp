I got loads of compliments! The gravy recieved the most raves. I can be a bit lazy, so I didn't cook the cider with the drippings. I just seperated the drippings and mixed in the cider. I did need to add corn starch to thicken it a bit. Also, I basted the turkey with chicken broth for the first few hours because there were not enough drippings.

I thought that the turkey was very moist, and the gravy quite good. I did not think this was a memorable recipe, just a very good one.

I am planning to make this recipe this weekend, but my brother in law cannot eat Gluten. Has anyone ever tried to make this gravy with a flour substitute? Any suggestions on which substitute tends to work best in gravies?

I made this for Thanksgiving 2003 for my far-flung relatives and they are still talking about it. I've made a lot of turkeys but this is the one I'm sticking with. I can't imagine a better recipe.

This was the first and last turkey I ever make. Brining sounds wrong, but have faith. The brining kept it juicy and just enough salty: juicier than any I have ever had before. More herbs under the skin would be fine if you like that. The cider sage gravy was AMAZING, especially with the green apple Hornsby's cider beer. DELICIOUS!

Very good. Liked the diced onion in the gravy. We like the gravy from the "Roast Turkey with Sage & Sherried Cider Giblet Gravy" recipe (on this website) better.

I wanted to cook a big traditional turkey dinner for friends on New Year's day and this was a huge hit. I'd never cooked a turkey before, so I religiously read all of the reviews for tips and tricks. I must admit, I skipped the gravy (had some picky eaters and didn't think they'd go for it). The turkey was so moist and juicy! The brining technique worked so well. And I cooked it breast down for most of the time, which also contributed to such a juicy bird. I paired it with the whipped sweet potatoes and cornbread and herbed bread stuffing with sausage (from this site) - also huge hits. I have now become the official turkey cook for next Thanksgiving!

What a super recipe- I suggest adding more fresh herbs, and an apple stuck with cloves into the cavity. I also lifted the skin up from the brest, and stuffed with more chopped herbs and butter- this keeps the meat super tender, and bastes it with more flavour. I also used organic fresh pressed apple juice instead of cider because all of our liquor stores have been on strike (!!!) over the holidays. It worked like a charm, and in fact I would make it this way again, instead.

I haveto confess, I did not make the Cider Gravy yet. But I like the turkey recipe so much that I will be making it again at the end of the week. This is the first turkey I have ever done, and it was PERFECT!! I want to try the apple trick noted above as well.

This recipe was so excellent, I made it twice in one week. One suggestion is to double the fresh herbs within the cavity and leave some extra herbs around the base of the turkey. This really helps the flavor infuse with the meat, it kicks up the flavor of the basting juices, and it does not take away from the traditional turkey style. I also tried adding a quartered granny smith apple to the cavity the 2nd time. When buying hard cider for the gracy, making it green apple cider (Hornsby's) rather than plain draft cider enhanced the overall flavor of the gravy. The other important thing is to only let your turkey temp get up to 165 before taking it out of the oven, overbaking takes away from the herb flavor and can make for dry meat.

Last year was the first time I made a turkey. I used this recipe, and to my chagrin there were NO leftovers. I used a kosher turkey, so that may have contributed to the moist and tender consistency of the bird, but I really think starting it out in a very hot oven is key.

Fantastic! The very best turkey my family and friends ever had including myself. They talked about from Thanksgiving through Christmas 2003! And now I am required to do an encore this year! If I keep this up, I will be hosting these people every year! Thanks Epicurious...(Tongue in cheek)

This was my first turkey, and it was wonderful. The gravy has a very nice flavor. I was a bit nervous about searing the turkey first, but the bird was moist and delicious. I will definitely make this again. I made this with the mashed potatoes with sage and white cheddar recipe on this site.

I can only comment on the gravy, since I made my life easy and did not goof with a big bird. THE GRAVY WAS EXCELLENT!!! (I pre-baked turkey legs, drained the juice, and then took the meat off the bones 1 day prior to XMAS, so I only had to reheat it. Refrigerated the turkey juice and then skinned the fat off of the top.) Made 1/2 of the gravy recipe. For my 1/2 recipe I used 3/4 cup of apple cider, 2 cups turkey juice and 2 tsp. rum (didn't have any "hard cider"). After reducing this mixture by about 1/3, I added enough canned low-fat chicky broth to bring the mixture up to 2 cups. Then followed the halved recipe exactly. Best gravy I have ever made!!! Served it over the turkey, ham slices, and plain mashed potatoes. Hubby and Son loved it too!!!

This recipe is very good with a few changes. Instead of turkey, use a pork loin. Instead of herbs, use crushed vegetables and instead of roasting at a high heat, cook for 30 minutes @ 110 degrees. You will be amazed.

Very simple and tastey. Made this with a 25 lb bird and she came out beautifully. The gravy was delicious.

Just a caution about working with a kosher turkey - while the recipe does mention removing feathers or quills, you should allow yourself about a half hour with a needle-nose pliers to go over the turkey carefully for this. A tweezers does not grip enough for pulling out those pinfeathers and deeply situated quills. Also, obviously the use of butter does not make this a kosher recipe - simply a less time-consuming way to achieve the effect of brining.
