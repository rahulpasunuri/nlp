I make a variation of this pizza, I never tried this particular recipe but I popped on to get more ideas....for those of you looking for more texture or extra ooomph, I use a pre-marinated garlic lemon pepper chicken that I get at the butcher. It adds extra flavor and texture. I also add minced garlic to the pizza....

I love the combination of ingredients in this recipe, although I took into consideration another review that I read before I made this recipe and took it upon myself to add a few ingredients to make it just a little more exciting. Try sauteeing sweet sausage along with crushed garlic and chopped onion and adding these ingredients to the spinach mixture. This made the recipe just a bit more zippy and turned 6" pizzas into 10" pizzas, which, in turn feeds alot more mouths. I would definitely recommend trying the recipe this way, and should anyone else make it and decide to add something more, please share it with us!!! I believe this recipe could be left open to the cook's own personal tastes and imagination. Enjoy!

If you love goat cheese, you might like this recipe as is. It needs more of something though to make it worth making again: more garlic, more pepper.....
