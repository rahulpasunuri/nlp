I have a question-I love the deep dark gingerbread cake from Dancing Deer bakery. It is a moist, rich, dark cake. Does anyone know if this cake is similar? Thanks in advance

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this before, having made it about 4- 5 times now. As a gingerbread lover, I think this is the definitive recipe: black, rich, moist, spicy, and slightly caramelized. Even non-gingerbread lovers (e.g., my husband) love this, with just cause. I have never had a sticking problem, using my Nordic bundt pan with baking spray (flour added); my pan does NOT use a complicated design, FYI, and the cake unmolds perfectly after the 5 mins. of cooling time. I adore this recipe and everyone who tries this cake falls in love with it.

I first tried this recipe about 7 years ago, and have been making it every Christmas since. I follow the recipe exactly, but this year I substituted melted butter for the oil and the taste was even bettr. It does seem inevitable that the cake falls a bit in the middle - if anyone knows a way to prevent this, Id be much obliged, but it doesn't affect the taste or texture in any way. Many have mentioned the prohibitive cost cardomom - thought I'd mention that Trader Joe's "pumpkin pie spice" lists cardamom among its ingredients along with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger and lemon peel. I wonder if I used a few tsp of this mixture in lieu of the cinnamon and cardamom and cut back a bit on the ginger how it would work out? I've also noticed that you can find tiny packages of spices at some stores in their natural foods departments at low cost.

Scrumptious. Truly, scrumptious. I made a gluten-free version. Flour mix: 2 Cups Brown rice flour; 2/3 Cup Potato Starch; 1/3 Cup Tapioca Flour (thank you, Food Philosopher, Analise Roberts for this mix). (You will have a little flour left over -- use it to prep your pan). 1 teaspoon xanthum gum. I used 1/4 Cup of our homemade spiced pear sauce and 1/2 Cup oil. So delicious. Oh yes, obey the recipe and use a LARGE saucepan when bringing the stout and molasses to a boil. Boy, did I make a mess. :)

I made this on a whim one Sunday. We like strong flavored gingerbread, not the commercial, pale, flavorless gingerbread you can buy in a store. This recipe was exceptional. I made one modification, I added about a 1/4t salt to sharpen the flavors. The gingerbread was strongest on day one, by day three it mellowed. Next time, instead of using the 2T of ground ginger, I would use fresh ginger, perhaps that would make the gingerbread just a bit stronger and add a little heat. This recipe is amazing! You will not be disappointed!

This is a quality-of-life-enhancing recipe. An utterly soul-stirring affair. I substituted 1 cup of the white flour for 1/2 c almond flour and 1/2 c buckwheat flour (and sifted out the mealy bits), cut half the sugar out entirely, used a mixture of coconut oil and EVOO instead of vegetable oil, and added a tablespoon of fresh ginger (cut one tbsp of dry)... all with fantastic results. Topped with a scoop of coconut ice cream...TDF.

I have made this recipe twice now, and I really do love it. Even though I was impatient both times with waiting for the molasses mixture to cool, which is why (im guessing) my cake spilled over a bit, and then sunk, I am going to make my mixture on the stove, and leave it to cool while I go to work. I havent had any issues with sticking at all, I use Bakers Joy spray, baking in a cathedral shaped bundt pan (idk the brand) I also added a teaspoon of Orange oil the second time, I made it. Delicious.

This recipe did not work for me. Even after extending the baking time by several minutes, it was underdone and wet. I ate the parts of the cake that were close to the pan edges (i.e. done) and they were delicious. Might try again with a bit less liquid and longer baking time.

Loved/love this gingerbread - 2 things -the batter fit in and baked through perfectly in a 9 by 9 inch square baking tin, and after having buttered and floured the tin and baking for the full 55 mins, the only sticking problem I had was with the part of the dough mixture that had not mixed in thoroughly and settled at the bottom of the pan in a tar like consistency. ( which could be thought of as candy like - the whole thing is really delicious, and I only wished I had mixed a bit longer.) Definitely 4 forks!

This is a fantastic recipe. I've made it a few times now. My 13 year old loves it and made it with a friend for her Secret Santa party. I was a bit curious to see if all the kids would like it since it has such intense flavors. Came down later to find not a single crumb left. They devoured it. Unsweetened whipped cream is the perfect accompaniment to the full flavors.

I was a little worried about this cake when I first made it. It had such a strong molasses flavour but when I served it I cut small pieces and added a caramel sauce and whipping cream and everyone raved. I would make it again but I think I would try cutting down the molasses.

This recipe is simply glorious. I agree with the reviewer who likened it to Rosh Hashanah honey cake--I'd say it's similar but has a deeper, more complex flavor and I am obsessed with the slightly chewy exterior that develops on this baby! Super easy to make: I used Wolaver's Oatmeal Stout (if you're getting one, might as well do the whole six-pack, right?) and baked it in a square pan because I don't like the fussiness of bundt pans. Other than that, I followed the directions to a T and it turned out beautifully. The only thing keeping me from eating the whole thing right now is the party I'm hosting tomorrow...

The flavor of this recipe is wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly but the centers fell. I used seasoned stone loaf pans, buttered and floured them and they really stuck to them. I would definitely make this again in a different pan. I made a lemon curd to go along with it and the flavours were fantastic for a blustery fall day with a cup of Irish tea.

Great recipe! I used 2 tbsp fresh grated ginger and 1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper (sounds weird but adds some spice!). I also used 3/4 cup fancy molasses + 1/4 cup blackstrap. I did not have issues with sticking as I buttered and floured the pan *well* and turned the cake out exactly 5 minutes after removing from the oven. I will definitely be making this again!!

Great recipe! This is a new tradition for the holidays in my house. It is best when made a day ahead, wrapped up and allowed to let the spice flavors develop. The only warning I would give is to heat the stout in a large saucepan. The first time I made it, the stout boiled over when the soda was added. I now know to allow for that, and don't have to clean up a mess. The result is well worth it!

I made this recipe exactly the first time. It is the best ginger cake recipe I have made. It had all the qualities I like... chewy, moist, sweet, etc., but I wanted a bit more ginger punch. I dropped the ground ginger back to 1 Tbsp. and added 2 Tbsp. of fresh grated ginger to the cooled molasses/stout. I also added 1 Tbsp. instant espresso to the molasses/stout because I think it enhances the flavors nicely. I've also dropped the sugar back by 1/2 cup with no major issues in the recipe, but prefer it sweeter. I've also added some crystallized ginger for a little chewy kick every once in a while. Yummy!

Best gingerbread ever - but it does need a little salt to pick up the flavors. Otherwise it lacks a bit of complexity. Last time I made it with Newcastle's brown ale, since that was all I had in the house, and I actually prefer it to the stout.

I just made this tonight. The good thing is that I had no problem with sticking at all. I sprayed Pam for baking and turned it out after 5 minutes of cooling. The bad thing is that Im kind of underwhelmed by the taste and Im hoping it gets better overnight. 50 minutes was too long in my oven and it tastes a bit too sweet for me. But the real problem is that it tastes beery to me. I didnt expect it to actually taste like GuinnessI thought it would just add depth and richness. Did I measure the Guinness wrong? I spooned off the foam so that I had a full cup of liquid. Is that correct? It sounds dumb, I know, but I never tried to measure Guinness before!

Loved this gingerbread. I used 3/4 cup of granulated sugar instead of 1 cup. Thought it was the right balance. Served it with whipped cream. Terrific reception from the family.

This is my second holiday season making this recipe. I think my best advice is give it time! This is not a gingerbread to eat the day you make it. I prefer to give it 24 hours to "mellow" before serving, up to 48 hours. Soft, sticky, spicy and delicious are exactly how I would describe it! I have used both a bundt and loaf and the results for both have been good. My absolute favorite gingerbread- this year it was my home made gift to friends!

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful, moisty, spicy gingerbread. It gets a beautiful "crust" on the surface with a little bit of chew - delicious! I baked this in loaf pans and ceramic mini loaf pans and had no issues whatsoever with sticking. I sprayed the pans thoroughly with Baker's Joy, and lined the mini loafs with parchment paper as well. Not sure what all the fuss is about.

Rating: 0
Oh, this is fabulous. Not sure why the reviewer kittybitty didn't find it spicy or gooey, as mine was very spicy (make sure your spices are fresh!), very moist, a bit sticky/gooey, and with a wonderful thin, crisp crust. I used the spoon-and-sweep method for the flour, instead of the scoop-and-sweep. I also used a very old, very thick and very heavy made-in-the-USA aluminum bundt pan instead of a thin one - thrift stores often carry ones like that. I also subbed a dark, thick porter for the stout, as it was what I had at home, the flavor profiles are similar and it turned out great. At any rate, a delicious cake that elicited many oooh and ahhhs from those that like gingerbread (and polite comments from those that don't, so this is definitely a polarizing cake).

Rating: 3
I'm not sure why this cake didn't thrill me. I was 100% sure this was going to be amazing based on the reviews. I went out and bought a new Nordic Ware pan this morning and made this cake for a guest this afternoon. I "braced" myself for an outpouring of praise, but the cake was just OK, nothing great. I followed the directions to a T except that I used 3/4 cup white sugar (not 1 cup) and I did not wait until the molasses mixture was fully room temperature before adding it to the flour, but these changes could hardly affect the cake drastically. I had no problems with the cake sticking - I used a thick coat of Baker's Joy on my new pan AND I dusted the pan with cocoa. After waiting 5 minutes, the cake popped out without issue. I was hoping for something spicy, gooey or with a gingered, caramelized quality, but I just got an average cake. I really expected something better. FYI for efficiency nuts like me - you can pre-heat the oven, grease the pan, grate the nutmeg, and clean the kitchen while the molasses mixture is cooling.

I make this cake a lot- it is my "go to cake" for occasions where I need to bring a desert. You must use the spary with flour in it to for your pan. I do find that a traditional bundt pan works best but have used others. I used to get a lot of sticking before I switched to the baking spray with flour which I read on here and it works like a charm. I love gingerbread and this is marvelous. Like the whiskey idea.

i made this recipe verbatim tonight and its wonderful. and im not normally a gingerbread person. i used two nordicware mini bundt pans because im taking them to my coworkers. i baked the pans, at the same time, for 20 minutes at 345 degrees because my old oven can run too hot. generously sprayed the bundt pans with cooking spray with flour. the batter made 3 pans worth. well see how they taste tomorrowthe spices are definitely present but not as intense as i expect theyll be tomorrow. even if the flavor doesnt deepen im satisfied. a couple of them got crustier on the outside as they cooled, but maybe thats just the nature of gingerbread. i'm going to pretty them up with a lemon-cream-cheese glaze and try not to eat them all before taking them to work!

This was delicious gingerbread, but like others, I had a terrible time with it sticking to my Bundt pan. I'm thankful to the reviewer who suggested making trifle with it because that was the only way I salvaged my dessert with company arriving in an hour!

I have just taken my gingerbread out of the oven and it is fantastic. I used a stout that had been aged in whisky barrels and would definitely consider a tbsp whisky in with the stout next time I make this. My only substitutions were treacle for the molasses as it's more readily available here and I crushed and used the seeds from 2 whole green cardamom pods in lieu of powdered cardamom. I didn't have a ring/bundt tin so used 1 24cm x 13cm loaf tin and 1 20cm round tin. I lined them with 3-4 layers of greased brown paper to stop the sides overcooking and filled both up half way. The loaf took 50 mins and the cake a few minutes more. Next time I'll use 3 layers brown and 1 layer baking paper, as the cake stuck a little to the brown paper. I also cooked them at 160 Celsius (350 Fahrenheit?) as my oven is hot. This will be my go to gingerbread recipe from now on, wonderful flavour and texture.

After 3 attempts to this recipe, I found the secrets. A Nordicware bundt pan is essential, a fully greased and floured (with shortening! as recommended by Nordicware) pan, and five minutes cooling time.

The flavor of this cake is 4+ forks, however it doesn't work in the average bundt pnn. Mine stuck so bad I ended up making gingerbread trifle with it! I have noted the same recipe on this site, using a 9 x 5 pan, lining the bottom with greased parchment paper. I'll have to try again using this method!

I love this recipe and will continue to use it for my go-to gingerbread. I tried it in a springform pan and had trouble with the baking time conversion. A great alteration is to make or purchase a good quality lemon curd, slightly heat it, and drizzle over the cake. My favorite cake combination!

Made this in little loaf pans to give away for Christmas. 1) 3 pans to one recipe 2) Took 42ish minutes to cook 3) Forgot the white sugar altogether in one batch and was actually pretty good. But in the future will cut white sugar in half. 4) No need to "Pam" or even butter/flour the cardboard pan liners. 5) Everyone LOVED it

What a treat this recipe is every year at Christmas! I so enjoy making it, and everyone- from tots to grands- just loves it. I do add a 1/4 tsp. of sea salt, but otherwise follow the recipe precisely as it is written. One year I did run out of vegetable oil and used melted butter to make up the difference...equally fabulous!

Rating: 4
This is the best gingerbread ever! I've never had a problem with it sticking to the pan. The key, I think, is a high-quality, heavy bundt pan. I use a class Nordicware pan sprayed with Spectrum Baker's Spray (oil with flour already incorporated); this works really well. Also, make sure to unmold the cake exactly 5 minutes after you take it out of the oven - at this point it will have pulled away from the pan a bit and the sugar is still soft enough to release.

Rating: 4
Additional note: I've always made this recipe (many times) with two loaf pans, never with the bundt. As long as you line your baking dish with parchment paper (or wax paper) you will never experience any sticking to the pan. This recipe is the greatest!

I have made this cake several times with great success. I did have to buy a new heavier bundt cake pan in order to have the cake cook evenly and to have it come out of the pan without sticking.

I loved this cake and agree with most reviewers that it is deliciously intense, moist and gingery. However, mine stuck terribly to the bundt pan, despite generous buttering/flouring. I have read through many reviews and found very few such complaints, which is confusing to me! I can only think that I have to use even more butter or shortening next time, as I otherwise followed the recipe to a "T".

I love this recipe, which I bake using a gingerbread pan I got at William-Sonoma (wedding gift card). Anyway, it's like making cupcakes, so I had to reduce the time. I start looking at 20 minutes, but I think they take 25. My changes: up the cinnamon to 1 TBL, make cloves a pinch and up cardamom to 1/4 tsp. These are a big hit with kids and adults at our yearly party. I don't think they're too spicy or too sweet, as one of the reviewers said, so I left the sugar at 1 cup brown and 1 cup white - but I use whey low, so maybe that makes a difference.

I will definitely make this again. It was easy, not very time consuming and enjoyed by all ages at our Thanksgiving dinner this year. I used regular molasses(yellow label), light brown sugar instead of dark, and butter instead of oil. It was not too dense or spicy and very yummy!

I thought that I would try this recipe, Gramercy Tavern - it had to be good. I was hoping for a grown up version of gingerbread, spicy and not too sweet. I couldn't find my bundt pan , so I used a 9 inch square baking pan. The cake burned on the outside and was raw in the middle. Perhaps if I used a bundt pan it would have cooked through. And it was way too sweet. I added chopped granny smith apples, raisins and chopped walnuts to the bottom of the pan before I poured in the batter, hoping for a gingerbread upside down cake. But because the batter is so thing, the fruit floated to the top. If I try the recipe again, I will reduce the sugar.

Moist and spicy cake, good, but not the best ginger cake I've ever had. I thought the proportion of dry to wet ingredients seemed a bit off-- the batter is very wet and the cake sank in the middle. I think I will try David Lebovitz's "Fresh Ginger Cake" next.

This is the most delicious gingerbread I've ever eaten. The intensity of it sort of reminds me of a Rosh Hashanah (Jewish new year) honey cake. I could easily see making this cake for that holiday. I used Guinness draught because that's what I had and I was forced to use butter as I had sadly let myself run out of oil. I also used regular molasses (Grandma's yellow label) and I thought it was just fine. I'll be making this every year, I hope. It's just wonderful, especially with the unsweetened whipped cream!

Very warm and spicy for the holidays. I wrote on my blog about a delicious moment when I tasted the gingerbread. Here is an excerpt: I had made it yesterday by first boiling a solution of oatmeal stout and molasses (I sipped the stout regularly to be sure it was a good fit), and in a side bowl, sifting together flour, ginger, freshly ground nutmeg, cinnamon, and a pinch of cardamom. A few eggs and a giant dose of sugar had then joined the two together, and 50 minutes later, the oven had pulled it to the form of a bundt cake--with the help of a pan of course! I took another sip of my wine and decided to partake in a piece of the gingerbread. My fingers reached for the cold and sticky brown loaf and set it on the white napkin next to the clear glass of warm red wine. With one more sip, the mood was set. My teeth sank in easily. I was not disappointed that the crunch that had characterized the outer crust had softened to the air, because this same softness seemed to have been acquired by the dense and chewy center which now presented itself in quite an elegant manner. This soft sticky gingerbread was all the happiness I was searching for, though to keep my integrity in tact, I must admit that I still finished my wine!

Rating: 4
Outstanding! Deep flavour, and a pleasant combination of slightly crisp, caramelized exterior and rich, moist interior. One note: the recipe tells you to bring stout and molasses to a boil in a LARGE saucepan. There are only 2 cups of liquid involved, but please do use a large saucepan, because the thing foams up like an angry, rabid animal! No need to skim off the foam though, because once the liquid has cooled to room temperature the foam will have dissipated.

This cake tastes great, has a lot of flavor, and is very moist. And even better, the recipe seemed very forgiving. I made it on a whim, just using what was handy, which meant a) a Guinness that had been opened and sitting in my fridge for over a month, b) blackstrap molasses, c) part canola oil and part sesame oil, d) less white sugar than was called for. I forgot to let the molasses/stout mixture cool to room temperature and so after i added it into the egg mixture I dumped the whole thing into the flour mixture in hopes of cooling the mixture and thus not cooking the eggs with the molasses. Heh. I also put the batter in two small loaf pans (8 x 4) so that I could freeze one loaf if I wanted to. The the little loaves cooked forever (60-70 minutes) and got a little burned. And even so, it came out great! Even the burned parts are tasty! We had it with vanilla ice cream, which probably helped (it is kinda intense with blackstrap molasses...), and my friend decided to take some home to his girlfriend -- who is a discerning eater and loves ginger cake. I love a forgiving recipe, and this one seems to be. Next time I'd try make sure the batter was not so deep in the pans and not use blackstrap molasses, but even all that was fine.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! I should not be allowed to make this unless I know I will be able to immediately pawn it off onto others, because it's half gone already and has barely cooled. The first time I made this, I didn't have a bundt pan so baked it in a tube pan, which didn't work so well--the batter leaked everywhere. Then I inverted it too quickly and it exploded all over my counter. No worries, just threw the chunks in a bowl with rum, roasted pears and whipped cream and called it Gingerbread Trifle. This time, I baked it in two 8 inch round pans for 35 minutes and it was perfect. Easy, delicious.

Great gingerbread, moist and dense. Ate it hot out of the oven, don't see how it can get any better but we didn't eat it all tonight so we will be able to verify this. Thanks to all the suggestions here. Reduced white sugar to 1/2c, used eggbeaters and replaced 1/2c of the oil with applesauce. Pam and cocoa to dust pan and cooled only 5 min. Popped out of the pan with no stickage. Baked 60 min.

I made this gingerbread today as a thank you gift for a dear friend. I doubled the batch, and used dark brown sugar. Then I baked the cakes in a mini-bundt pan. They look fantastic! I buttered and then sugared (white sugar)the molds. They came out picture perfect easy! I will deliver it tomoorrow along with fresh cream for whipping and finely chopped candied ginger so she can serve it later this week. This new bride is hosting family for Christmas for the first time! These gingerbread cakes will be a stunning desert for her first Christmas dinner!

Some please help me out here! I should have known that a recipe that has 4 3/4 cups of liquid to 2 cups of flour was going to be odd. (sugar counts as liquid in baking) While baking, it came up over the sides of the pan and spilled onto the oven. Close to the 50 min. of baking in collapsed. It is definitely a gooy dence cake but what happened in the baking process can't be right. Anyone with any thoughts?

Best gingerbread I've ever had. I've made this recipe many times, and it's been a hit with everyone. I like to make a little hard sauce to go with mine in lieu of whipped cream. If this is your first time making this: the molasses/guinness mixture will go from boring to boiling in the blink of an eye. Use a larger pot than you think you need and keep an eye on it or else you'll be cleaning up an enormous mess. I had to throw out my drip pans and get new ones...

This was a Gingerbread lover's cake. It was easy to put together, smelled great and easily came out of the pan. I used Oatmeal stout from Trader Joe's, slightly less ginger, light molasses and glazed it w/ the lemon glaze recommended in one of the reviews. My problem with it is I don't think it has universal appeal and is really more for those who love true gingerbread (super gingery, not sweet, fairly dense, rather molasses-y) versus the Starbuck's Gingerbread Loaf kind of folks. I gave half the cake away to a gingerbread lover (and, to the recipe's credit, he DID like it quite a lot), but I won't make it again for our family.

QUESTION:The Gramercy Tavern Gingerbread calls for 1/2 TEASPOON baking soda and the Guinness Stout Ginger Cake calls for 1/2 TABLESPOON baking soda.As we know, other than this discrepency, they are the same but does this cause a problem, or does anyone know?

This is my absolute favorite gingerbread. It's moist and dark and absolutely wonderful! Look at all the ginger it has! How could it be anything but terrific for a ginger lover like myself?

Just a follow- up to my previous review..this Christmas I made 10 of the gingerbreads to give as gifts, so I learned a lot..here is one mistake I made:for one cake,I didn't wait long enough for the stout molasses mixture to come all the way back to room temperature. The cake puffed up and spilled over in the oven, and then fell. The cake still came out of the pan with no problem, and it was still delicious, but it was shorter because of the batter loss. So a word of advice on that issue..be patient! And for the person who said their cake was inedible..I would guess that it was because you used Blackstrap molasses. Make sure you use a mild molasses. Brer Rabbit was on sale and so I used it in all of the cakes. I also made one cake with candied ginger instead of crystallized ginger. (There is a difference). The candied ginger is gooier and heavier, and sinks to the bottom of the pan, which in this case worked out well, because each peak of the trees(Nordic Ware tree Bundt pan) had a sort of gum-drop top, it was a fun surprise. All of the gift recipients raved about them, and requested them again for next year! I finally made one for my own family today!!!

Yes, I also stopped searching for the perfect gingerbread cake. This is it! I made this in a NordicWare bundt pan and used baking spray. I waited 5 to 10 minutes after it was done, and it came out perfectly - no sticking problems at all. This recipe makes a dense, moist, spicy cake, and if you are a true gingerbread person, you will love this! It is a keeper in my recipe book!!!

I am so glad that I can stop searching for the perfect gingerbread cake. I read each and every review, took to heart all the tips, and now I will be making it for years to come. As one person did, I also used a chocolate stout which I found at Cost Plus World Market.I used the full amount of brown sugar, and reduced the white sugar to 1/2 cup. I also added crystallized ginger, about a 1/4 cup, which I finely minced in my mini processor. I have an extensive collection of Nordic Ware Bundt pans, and I used the one with the tree design, so when the cake is sliced, each person has their own little Christmas tree, covered with powdered sugar snow. Absolutely beautiful. I have not had any sticking problems at all, even with such an intricate design. I used a generous amount of Pam Baking spray, and I dusted the inside of the pan with cocoa. I think that the cooling time is essential to make sure the cake doesn't stick. As soon as I take it out of the oven, I set the timer for 5 minutes. The cake slips out perfectly every time. Perhaps part of that success is the quality of Nordic-Ware pans. They are worth the investment. Thanks to all who reviewed the recipe, and thanks to Epicurious for sharing it with us diehard gingerbread lovers!It is the best gingerbread I have ever had!!

I love this recipe. i almost never make recipes twice, but i'm saving this one to make every winter! First time I made it I replaced the stout with coffee and skipped the cardamom--still fantastic. Yum. The batter always scares me--it seems too runny, but turns out amazing...

It should be noted that this recipe is for a cake rather than a quick bread, the latter of which is what I know to be 'gingerbread'. This recipe is EZ + it bakes up flavorful, gooey & sweet. BUT it's also very good - for all the same reasons. A word of caution: I used this recipe to make individual breads which I don't recommend. A large bundt pan - greased & well- floured as called for - would have turned out a cake that had a caramelized exterior & a soft, delicious interior. I could have then cut it into wedges to wrap & give as gifts. As individual cakes, I got lots of caramelization & goo, less cake. And a LOT of sticking, despite using a combo of non-stick Teflon pans + greased & floured aluminum pans. Somehow I doubt that anyone I give these to will mind however, as they lick gingerbread from their sticky fingers. Thank you to "ninah148 from Philadelphia, PA" who suggested Gramercy's Tavern's alternate recipe for "Guinness Stout Ginger Cake" which contains less sugar. I'll be sure to try that next.

I cook because I need to for my health not for the joy of it. As a marginal cook, I am pleased to have something useful to share. I learned this in cake decorating and it works every single time. Mix together equal quantities of shortening,cooking oil, and flour. I usually do 1/3 cup of each. I use my mixer to achieve a very smooth consistency. Store in airtight container in the cupboard. Using a pastry brush, very lightly brush the mixture on every surface of the bundt pan. Don't miss any spots. After your cake bakes, set the timer and allow it to cool exactly 10 minutes. This is my favorite cake to take to parties and it comes out of the pan perfectly every single time. I have used this mixture for many different baking projects and it has never failed in over 20 years. The key is very thin and complete coverage.

Delicious! The spicing is terrific. I served it with warm applesauce, which complemented it nicely and made it a very autumny dish. I made a half recipe, which took 38 minutes in an 8x8 pan. No problems with sticking (but I served it from the pan).

I just took this cake from the oven, and it has collapsed. The only difference I made was to not use butter to grease the pan (I used Crisco no-stick spray) and I used a tube pan, not a bundt. Also the stout was labeled Extra Stout. Anyone know why this might have happened? thanks. I haven't tasted it yet, maybe it will taste o.k. -- just look funny. Not sure if I will try it again, unless I know what caused the failure.

I made this for my Thanksgiving family reunion, and it was the most popular dessert at the table. Considering how easy it was to make, I'll be making it regularly. I did use a stoneware pan, which gave it a lovely chewy texture.

This recipe is AWESOME. I'm a real gingerbread lover, and this gingerbread is the best I've ever tasted. Easy and fun to make, too. I made it the first time for my Thanksgiving dinner and it was the hit of the evening. I served it with a homemade lemon curd, and the two flavors together are delicious. Like a lot of other people who tried this recipe, I had trouble with the gingerbread sticking to the pan, even though I greased and floured it. I'll keep working on just the right method to make the bread slip out of the pan, but I wouldn't let that small detail keep me from making this wonderful gingerbread!

The flavor of this gingerbread was outstanding. It was gone in an instant. I did have problems with the cake sticking in the pan despite generous greasing and flouring so I would be wary of making this for a company dessert or dessert table but the family is clamoring for more!

Great! Spicy, moist, smells delicious while cooking. I halved the sugars, as in the alternate recipe, with good results. I think it might need a pinch of salt. Other than that, my only comment is that I couldn't believe how stuck to the pan it was--I have a great bundt pan, and have never encountered sticking before, but this REALLY stuck. Any ideas?

This is the best gingerbread I've eaten, bar none. I am somewhat of a gingerbread freak, and I must have tried hundreds of recipes. This one ends the search. Dark, rich, spicy, and sticky. I used Guinness, but think that an oatmeal stout would be better. I can't recommend the Goose Island Oatmeal Stout for this one, however. I've tasted it, and it's too bitter for this recipe. I'll search out a true, less bitter and richer, oatmeal stout. Also, don't use the Guinness "Draft" with the silly little shot of gas inside. I think the beer isn't as rich as it would be in a regular, off the supermarket shelf Guinness.

This is fantastic gingerbread! It has become one of my regular recipes during the winter. A must-try.

You have to make this--if not for the sheer pleasure of eating it, then just to educate the majority of the world, which thinks that gingerbread is flat, crunchy and shaped like a man. This stuff is good. And it gets better as it sits. I made the recipe with half the granulated sugar, as suggested. Oh, and this bugger was hanging on to my silicone bundt pan for its life. I hate those things. Anybody need a silicone bundt pan?

I would also caution people to compare this recipe and comments to those of the Epicurious recipe called "Guinness Stout Ginger Cake", which is the same recipe from the same restaurant but with a few key differences. I followed the directions for the other recipe, which has half the sugar, and loved it. I used a 10-cup bundt pan and made 1 1/2 times the quantity specified...it rose above the top but did not spill, and I was able to cut the top (bottom of cake)off clean without losing any design. I used all powdered spices and light brown sugar, which is what I had available, and no fresh ginger. I used the Pam spray that said "for baking...with flour", as it had a picture of a bundt cake on it. I soaked the pan with this Pam, and it popped out with not a crumb left behind when I reversed the pan immediately after cutting the bottom flat. It also had a nice, crusty brown surface without any white marks people seem to have when they actually flour the pan. It baked in 50 minutes, but my oven runs hot. I would reiterate what others have said about using a large pot for the stout and molasses...as soon as you put the baking soda in, it foams up to at least three times the height of the liquid. The other recipe calls for 1/2 TABLESPOON instead of 1/2 TEASPOON baking soda that this one specifies in the beer/molasses combination, I might try this one next time with half the sugar. Nonetheless a dark, spicy, rich recipe that I would make again. I don't feel it needs any icing, I served with whipped cream and felt it was a perfect complement.

A delicious cake, with many compliments last night at a Super Bowl party. A couple of notes: I used a non-stick decorative bundt pan, sprayed it, and floured it. The cake still stuck, and all the detailing of the bundt pan pulled off when cake came out. Next time I'll use a plain tube pan or a less detailed bundt pan. And, it was done at 52 minutes---I was worried, because as the directions say, there will be some crumbs adhering to the toothpick, and I was worried by seeing crumbs on the toothpick, but it was indeed done. And, it's great because it gets better and better as it ages---was even better this morning, now two days old!

I made this for Christmas last year, and am making it again as dessert Christmas Eve Dinner (which means we can also eat it for breakfast on Christmas day -- yummy!). The texture of this gingerbread is wonderfully moist, and it has a wonderfully full, spicy flavor. Top it with a bit of whipped cream and you really do have a little slice of heaven on your plate. I do agree with other cooks that it's very difficult to remove from the pan successfully; last time I hand greased and floured the pan, but I'm going to try the Baker's Joy this time as recommended by another cook. But, it's a small price to pay for so delicious a treat! Enjoy!

MAKE THIS! Best gingerbread EVER! Very spicy, rich, and complex flavor. Even better the day after, or days later. The texture is amazing- my boyfriend doesn't even like gingerbread but raved about the texture and flavor of this. I cut back to 3/4 cup white sugar as others did, and used a healthy dose of nonstick spray and flour on the pan. Had no problems taking it out after 5 minutes of cooling. I'm making more today!

This is the best gingerbread ever! It is, however, very difficult to remove from the pan successfully. I've found Baker's Joy to give the highest percentage of success, but even that isn't foolproof. Take another reviewer's advice and use the leftovers to make a trifle-- layer vanilla pudding, gingerbread, and whipped cream. I took the gingerbread to a Christmas get-together last year and no one commented on it. I used the leftovers to make trifle for a New Year's Eve party, and it was the hit of the evening!

to cswoveland from Vancouver: Did you substitute one and one-half sticks of melted and cooled butter for the oil? I've made this cake before, and it always is moist and delicious. I've got my first of this season in the oven now. Thank you for all for your advice about sugar and removal from pan.

Rating: 4
I used melted butter (cooled), not oil. I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 C. as per many other recommendations. I followed the baking directions from "A Cook from Northeast" (Pure Convection 350 for 20 minutes, reduced to 325 for 30 minutes). Cooled in the pan (non-stick bundt pan, liberally greased with Crisco and "floured" with cocoa, as another person suggested) for exactly 5 minutes. The cake slid out of the pan effortlessly. I brushed the top with the syrup from a bottle of preserved ginger while it was warm, then dusted with powdered sugar. This cake is terrific!

Cut back on the sugar and added in chopped crystallized ginger as suggested by other reviewers. Am very glad I did! Made it Tuesday and it is incredibly moist and good now on Sunday. May have to get a piece now!

I made this for an apple tasting party, serving it with cider syrup whipped cream. All the guests were complimentary, but I regretted not cutting the amount of sugar in the recipe in half. I felt it far too sweet, which really interfered with the complex flavors of the stout and spices. In searching for the recipe again to review it, I can across a recipe for Guiness Stout Ginger cake, which is very close to this recipe but with half the sugar and additional fresh ginger. I'll try that recipe next time. BTW, thanks for the advice to allow the cake to cool for just 5 minutes and turn it out of the pan. Mine came out cleanly without sticking.

Maybe I'm doing something completely wrong, but the amount of molasses in this recipe makes it practically inedible

Hot damn, this is good! I made it according to recipe both times, with the exception of subbing 1/2 bread flour the first time and all bread flour the second, as I was out of all-purpose. It worked fine, though the seccond time the crust was more breadlike than the nice sticky goodness that I got the first time. Is definitely better the more it sits; it's 3 days old today and is fantastic. I'd like to try adding crystallized ginger-it's very gingery already but we love it.

The best gingerbread I've ever made! Adjust the spices to your taste, sometimes I'll add a bit more of everything and some finely chopped candied ginger for something totally over the top, but for a good homey gingerbread that stays good for days, you can't beat this one.

Outstanding. Super moist. Best gingerbread I have ever tasted. Most important tip: line the pan with parchment paper, and grease both. Follow this advice and there will be no problem removing from the pan. I made this recipe with Russian Rasputin Stout - my guests raved about it. They walked home with every last piece!

Rating: 4
This is always a crowd-pleaser. As for getting the whole thing out of the pan in one piece, the one fool-proof trick I've found is to use a silicon pan--it peels right off. Keep in mind that silicon pans can shorten baking time, so it might be wise to keep a closer eye on the gingerbread until you're used to the pan.

Rating: 4
Hands down, the BEST gingerbread ever. After much experimenting I've found that I agree with decreasing the white sugar by 1/2 cup and that the key to getting a "whole" cake out of the pan is to unmold after cooling only 5 minutes or so. I always make this with half whole wheat flour and half buckwheat flour, adding an additional 1/4 cup buckwheat. It works well to substitute 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce for the oil. The spicing is amazing, but I always tweak it further with 1 tsp ground coriander and - for additional spiciness - 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. OUTRAGEOUS!!!

This is great! I made it yesterday and we couldn't wait to have some for dinner last night - it is very good the first day, and now that I'm nibbling on a piece for breakfast, I can confirm it's even better the second. Very strong ginger taste, and I kept a light hand with the spices. I followed the advice of many here and reduced the white sugar by 1/2 cup. Also, I used light brown suger and regular, not robust, Grandma's molasses (that's what I had in the pantry). I used a nonstick bundt pan that I slathered with a huge amount of Crisco, a first for me, then floured. I baked on the convection setting at 350 for 20 minutes and at 325 for another 30 and it was done. I cooled it for exactly five minutes before turning out onto a wire rack. No sticking. There is a thin but firm crust to this cake - I was afraid I had overbaked, but it's just all the sugar caramelizing on the surface. More sugar would have made this stick, I think. It is plenty sweet even after cutting back, so that is my advice to anyone making this for the first time. I thought the cake looked a bit small when I took it out, but the flavor is so strong that you will cut thin slices and easily serve 10 people. Everybody loved it and it took quite a few hints for anyone to guess that Guinness is the secret ingredient. One more thing - it's a lot of fun to bake a cake that doesn't require a mixer. This is a fun one to do with kids.

Sure am glad I made this two days ahead, since half of the cake STUCK to the pan, meaning I have a the bottom half plus a bunch of gooey pieces. Tastes wonderful, but really, if you are making this for an event where you want a cake in, well, one piece, be careful! I will now go look for a recipe for gingerbread trifle, that will be our Christmas dessert now...

I am actually not a huge gingerbread fan, but made this for a holiday party. I have never had gingerbread quite like it-- it was so light. And prefectly spiced and not too dark and harsh like gingerbread can sometimes be. I will be making it again this weekend and will cut back on the powdered ginger and will add chopped crystallized ginger.

This was fab...everything that all the reviews say it is! The only thing I did differently was that I used melted/cooled ghee instead of oil. I do feel that it added flavor, even though I have not tasted it made with oil. I used a non-stick bunt pan which I sprayed heavily with Bakers Joy. It still stuck in several places. It seems that as the outside of this cake begins to cool, it gets harder and gooier. Perhaps that is why it begins to stick to the pan. I left it in the pan for 10 minutes before removing, but next time I think I am going to remove it 5 minutes after it comes out of oven. I'm also going to use shortening and flour for the pan. Will make this again and again. Children liked it as well!

Rating: 4
FABULOUS! I love the rich flavors in this cake. Definitely make the day ahead to allow flavors to meld/mellow! The only change I will make going forward is to emulsify the eggs, sugar and oil in the food processor to lighten the texture slightly (a Cook's Illustrated tip). Process the sugars and eggs til incorporated; with blade running, slowly add oil until thickened (like a mayo); then add molasses mixture. Transfer to bowl and follow directions as indicated

The best gingerbread, hands down. Served with a irish whiskey whipped cream for St. Pat's, and with a traditional hard sauce for Christmas. Make sure everything is well greased and sticking isn't an issue. And always bake a day ahead so it has time to age; it makes all the difference in the world

This cake is delicious and very easy. I used fresh ginger root because I didn't have powdered ginger. I just grated about a 1 1/2 inch knob of ginger root. It is tastier after a day or so.

I adore this gingerbread recipe - it's delightfully dark and sticky. However, if you use a springform pan (10 inch) and heavily grease it with shortening (NOT butter - that will just soak into the cake), plus a piece of waxed paper at the bottom also greased, there shouldn't be any sticking. This has always been highly effective for me. I cut the white sugar to 1/2 a cup, but this does produce a very dark gingerbread, so adjust based on the palate of the consumer. I also like to add some minced candied ginger to kick things up. It tastes best a day or two after it's made, as long as you keep it well-wrapped.

Just a follow-up to my previous review, to those who are having problems with sticking to the pan. I did mine in a springform pan. 3/4 of the recipe was perfect for a 10" springform. No sticking.

I've been making this cake for years. I've tried every combination of butter, Crisco, Pam, flour, unseasoned dry bread crumbs, bundt, or plain pan that I can think of. IT STICKS! I still love the flavor, but that lovely crust is stuck to the inside of the mold. Oh well.

As a lover of all things ginger and a diehard epicurious visitor, I can't believe it took me so long to discover this amazing recipe. Just made a downsized version - about 3/4 - in a 10" pan, with the following modifications: lacking stout, used Strongbow hard cider instead; used all light brown sugar instead of 1/2 dark, 1/2 white, and added some minced crystallized ginger, just 'cause I love it. This took only 35 minutes in my convection oven, before dinner, and was cooled enough to enjoy for dessert an hour later. Moist, dark, satisfyingly chewy around the edges, with lots of zing from the ginger. Husband and enjoyed it unembellished, but would surely go well with a rich vanilla ice cream.

Well, everyone tells me I am a great cook, with desserts my speciality, but this cake didn't come out wonderfully for me. It tasted good and smelled wonderful, but it was very dense, almost heavy. And it didn't have a carmelized crust that someone mentioned. Baked it in a bundt pan, and it looked great and came out of the pan perfectly, but after sitting covered for 48 hours, just wasn't a winner.

My gingerbread just came out of the oven, and my daughter and I each had a slice, still hot. Incredible. Both my bottle of stout and my jar of molasses were 12 oz., so I logically made 1 1/2 times the recipe and used four aluminum foil loaf pans. I sprayed them with baker's joy spray liberally, baked for about 50 minutes, ran a knife around the sides of the cakes and they slid right out of the pans. I also sprayed the cooling racks before I put the cakes on them, as I don't want to lose one bite of the delicious carmelized crust! One goes to work with me tomorrow, one for my best friend who adores gingerbread, one for Christmas Day dinner and one to pick at to our heart's content!

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe - for high altitude I added 2-3 additional Tbs of Guiness and flour per cup, an additional pinch of the baking powder and soda, reduced the amount of both sugars by 2-3 Tbs per cup and pushed up the baking temp by about 10-15 degrees. I left the amount of oil, eggs, molasses and spices the same. Perfect every time. I don't have a bundt pan but used both a 9X9 and a loaf pan and had better success with the loaf pan as the edges didn't carmelize as much, and cake came out with no sticking. Will definately make again - possibly with the addition of raisins, currents and dates. Would be great with a brandy hard sauce or Grand Manier whipped cream.

I made this 2 years ago to give away at Christmas and I've been pressured so much to make it again this year that I finally gave in. Fantastic recipe. Wonder if an orange / clove glaze might be nice overtop. Perhaps fresh caramel sauce on the side! Too decadent for words. I buttered and floured a bundt and a springform mold pan and both came out just fine. Wait until bread has pulled away from the sides of the pan, but it hasn't cooled completely. The cake will drop out everytime.

After trying two different gingerbread recipes that were awful, it was a pleasure to find a recipe that was wonderful! The cake was light and moist and had a nice hit of ginger. I didn't have any problem with the cake sticking to the pan. To be on the safe side, I used a non-stick bundt pan, sprayed it with Baker's Joy, heavily greased it with Crisco and then floured it--the cake practically fell out of the pan. This is definitely going into my recipe box.

I've made this twice. The first time it came out of the pan perfectly and was absolutely wonderful except a little too sweet for my taste. The second time I reduced the white sugar to one half cup and this was much better. However, I used my leftover stout, which was flat and it didn't seem to rise as much. In addition I put it in a loaf pan and it did not cook through. Because the batter is very liquidy, I think a bundt pan is necessary. I also waited too long to take it out of the pan and it stuck a little. I believe the secret to getting it out of the pan unharmed is not to let it cool completely. All the sugar and molasses harden, thus causing the sticking. Very necessary to not use "flat" stout. It is a fabulous recipe and with the above changes I will make it often.

This is a wonderfully rich, moist and delicious gingerbread. Probably the best I've ever made. I eliminated one tsp. of ginger and it was perfect. In other words, I used 1 TBSP plus 2 tsp. Very important to use high quality ginger. I think next time I would try reducing the amount of white sugar by one third cup. It was just a little too sweet for my taste but otherwise great.

This would have gotten four forks if it would have come out of the pan in one piece -- Pam and flour didn't do the trick, will try with butter and flour next time. The flavor was excellent though! The oatmeal stout shined through. I served it with pumpkin ice cream for Thanksgiving, and it was a huge hit.

This gingerbread is fantastic, and I say this as someone who has never been overly fond of gingerbread - probably because I had never had a really good example of it. But this is lovely - dense and moist, with a depth and combination of flavors that I had not tasted in other gingerbreads. I am really not a baker but this was so easy and came out perfectly. It's true what everyone else says - make this early and let the flavors improve over a couple of days. It was good on the first day, but by the third day it was divine. I used Guinness extra stout to make this as it was all they had at the grocery store, and I also had to use regular - not dark - molasses *and* I had to omit the cardamom since I couldn't find it. But it was still delicious. I also used a bundt pan and sprayed it with Baker's Joy, and the gingerbread came out almost in one piece - with one small section left in the pan. But it was easy enough to press back together, and when I plated the gingerbread I piled a few orange slices in the center hole and dusted it with confectioner's sugar and a little orange zest, and it looked great. Try this recipe!

my husband absolutely loves this recipe! he says it tastes like a big molasses cookie. this makes a dense, fudgey-thick cake, NOT a bread-like cake (like say, banana bread syle). it is fantastic with fresh whipped cream. it's definitely earned a spot in our dessert repertoire.

I've now made it four times, with varying degrees of success in getting it out of the pan in one piece. I'd always used generous amounts of Crisco and flour. Today I tried the lazy approach and sprayed my pan with Pam (the one with flour) and it popped right out with barely a crumb left behind. But no matter what shape it's in, it's always unfathomably delicious. Serve it with whipped cream and pears poached in red wine and your friends will literally never forget it.

YUM YUM YUM, to die for!!! Easy, keeps well, a festive yet simple, homey crowd-pleaser. I've tried many gingerbread recipes over the years, this is the BEST. Did not change a thing. Cake came out moist, even, beautiful. Make sure you grease AND FLOUR your pan well (or use cocoa instead of flour so that it's invisible.) Just the way your house will smell while it's baking is worth 4 forks! Serve with dusting of powdered sugar and whipped cream. Wonderful.

Definitely the best gingerbread I've ever made - the Guinness really adds another taste dimension. My only change was that I added another 1/4 cup of flour, as my batter seemed a bit thin - and it baked up perfectly. Guinness takes a while to settle so it may be that my cup was a bit generous. It's also a great dessert for my friends who are dairy intolerant (but who can eat eggs...)

This cake has a fantastic flavor! However, I live at a high altitude (5500 ft) and both times I have made this, the batter has risen, running out of the bundt pan (creating a mess in my oven). The resulting cake was sunken and stuck to the pan. The second time I prepared this, I tried making adjustments by decreasing the leavening agent and the sugar, and adding an additional egg and slightly more flour. I also let the beer stand to try to get some of the fizz out. Unfortunately, this did not help. The flavor is so good that I am willing to try yet a third time in order to get this right. Any suggestions from high altitude bakers?

Fantastic gingerbread recipe. Made exactly as the recipe stated. And for those of you out there that find buttering and flouring a pain, I would highly recommend Baker's Joy. It is a cooking spray and flour in one can and I find it to be amazing. It is located in the baking section of the grocery store.

HOLY TOLEDO, THIS IS GREAT!!! Very rich and dense, like a cross between cake and brownies. The absolute best gingerbread recipe available.

This gingerbread brought down the house at my St. Patrick's Day party. I had made three kinds of soda bread, boxty, smoke salmon, the whole nine yards and everyone could not stop talking about the gingerbread. It was incredibly dark and moist and delightfully sticky. You MUST use shortening, not butter, to grease a pan - butter contains 20% water and will soak into the cake, while shortening has no water and provides a much more effective barrier. My only change next time will be to bake it a bit longer, since the interior (I used a Bundt) was a bit underdone.

This gingerbread is amazing! I used a Guiness - and a very fussy bundt pan which I greased *generously* with shortening and floured (and it did NOT stick). Mine took about 75 minutes to actually finish in the oven. Served without whipped cream - just dusted with powdered sugar. Waited 3 days -- divine.

This is the only recipe for gingerbread you will ever need! Best ever! Fudgy, dense cake with a good spicy kick and a chewy outside that is delicious cold or warm. Mine fell slightly- I did take a peek to test about 10 minutes before the time so won't do that again. A definite winner- I am hooked!

I love this gingerbread to bits, but will someone please tell me how they get it not to stick in the pan? I've made it twice in a nonstick bundt pan buttered and floured within an inch of its life, and half of it has ended up in the pan each time. I've managed to reassemble it and get it to stick together by leaving it wrapped in foil till the next day, by which time it looks less ravaged than I remember. But still!

Now THIS is KICK-ASS gingerbread! I was looking at the old-fashioned gingerbread recipe, which got so-so reviews, and thinking maybe I could punch up the spices. Fortunately (and thanks!)one reviewer said this is the brains-fall-out delicious recipe (FOTFL). We appreciate real hoss-kick spicy ginger flavor at our house, not the timid, wishy-washy, let's-not-offend-anyone spice cake that usually passes for it. THIS IS THE ONE! If you had more than 4 forks, it could have them all. No problem getting it out of the non-stick Bundt, either.

I've been craving gingerbread since the start of the holiday season and just recently went out in search of the "perfect" recipe. Of course I turned to Epicurious, and the reviewers here seemed to think this was the best gingerbread recipe so I gave it a try. Aboslutely wonderful! Easy to make - even easier to eat. Like someone else said, it's chewy on the outside and moist and spicy on the inside. Top with a dollop of whipped cream and you're on your way to bliss!

This cake is brains-fall-out delicious! Made it Christmas Eve for our Christmas Day dessert. Such flavors! And, it lasted more than 3 days for us;kept well for 5 days. Very intense taste and not for sissies. And, you whisk everything together, how easy is that? Fine quality cake, for sure. Thank you.

Hi I've made this several times, it may be the all-time best gingerbread recipe. This is in contrast to the disappointing "Old-Fashioned Gingerbread" recipe elsewhere on this website (April 2002) which I just made this past weekend and found very disappointing. I won't desert Gramercy Tavern's dessert again!

I made this recipe for the 4th time yesterday, and I still love this cake! It improves with age as well. The outside is chewy, the flavor is spicy and warm and your house smells incredible while it bakes. Be sure to coat your bundt pan well - mine stuck on the last round.

Without a doubt, the best gingerbread I've ever tasted. My spouse, who used to eat this at Gramercy Tavern, closed his eyes in ecstasy when tasting it for the first time. If you're a gingerbread fan, you've GOT to try this. Nothing short of exquisite.

I love to cook but I don't do much baking. I've made this several times now and it is always a hit. Somehow it's become the dish everyone asks me to bring. I serve it with caramel ice cream drizzled with a little caramel sauce. It compliments the spicy richness of the cake.

I was so looking forward to this, but I was not impressed w/ the final product. It was moist, rich, and heavy on the spices(esp. the ginger)--but too much so, in my opinion. I made this for a younger crowd (20s) and did not get a very enthusiastic response--perhaps b/c we didn't eat much of this kind of gingerbread growing up and aren't nostalgic for it.

Well, this is divine. Family and friends loved it. In my heart, though, my steadfast Laurel's Kitchen recipe remains the winner. This one is just a bit too decadent. I would try it again with half the sugar, perhaps. The Guinness really is a special touch.

If you like dark, dense and sticky gingerbread, this is your recipe! I didn't have any problem with the cake sticking as I gave the pan (star-shaped bundt) a good brushing of butter and then floured. Served with Rum-Raisin custard sauce or apple-pear caramel sauce is the perfect comfort food for cold, blustery winter days. As the recipe states, it truly is better the second day.

I was searching for a recipe for cardamom bread, and happened to come upon this gingerbread recipe. After reading all the great reviews, I figured I just had to try it. The recipe sure didn't fail to please!! I love gingerbread, and this recipe is definitely the best gingerbread I've had. Like other reviewers, I had to bake it longer than the 50 minutes stated in the recipe. Mine was in the oven for about 65 minutes. Also, because of reviewers stating it was difficult to remove from the pan, I made mine in a loaf pan instead of a bundt pan. Although it is not as showy as a bundt cake, I wasn't planning on making it for a special occasion. It came out of the loaf pan with no problem whatsoever.

Rating: 4
The best ever. I made it exactly as stated. I would probably mix a little coco powder with the flour to dust the pan because it gave it a white coating I did not like. The taste is fantastic. I find most of my guest full by desert time but every one of them ask for seconds on this one. I served it with creme freshe.

The best gingerbread ever! My boyfriend hates gingerbread, and thinks this is delicious. I followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfectly. Had no problems getting it out of the pan, but I wouldn't advise using a super-decorative pan because it probably would stick.

I think I didn't grease the pan enough, because the cake broke as I unmolded it (it's a rather sticky cake). However, it's one of the yummiest things I have ever tasted, which is why I'm giving the recipe 4 forks. My boyfriend and I turned it into a fabulous trifle with rum custard!

This is my "new favorite" gingerbread recipe. I know that I raved about how good this was the day I served it (made it the night before), my co-workers loved it at that time! However, we had plenty of left-overs to enjoy for a couple of days. The flavors blend & only get better!! If you love old-fashioned gingerbread -you must try this!

In contrast to other reviewers, I didn't find this cake too strong. I served it to my inlaws here in Austria... they have never had gingerbread (or molasses for that matter), and they were thrilled with it. I was too! I used a teflon bundt pan and didn't have any problems with sticking.

This gingerbread is incomparable. It's moist, gingery, treacly and delicious. In contrast to others' experience, I had much better luck with Guinness as an ingredient than with oatmeal stout. Either way, it's a simply wonderful gingerbread, the sort that takes you back to childhood. It does sink in the middle, and it is heavy. Those are features, not bugs.

Like most everyone else I thought this was spectacular. I followed the ingredients to the letter with on exception - I forgot to add the baking powder! Incredibly stupid, and the cake STILL turned out great. That's a seriously infallible recipe. (It did stick a bit in little spots, but nothing the confectioners sugar didn't cover.) It was a huge hit, esp. with those who love molasses.

Made a dry run before making it for Christmas eve - My husband and office devoured it, despite the fact that I ran a little short of molasses. Used Samuel Smith's oatmeal stout. For less expensive coriander, try an Indian spice store.

I made this for Thanksgiving and served it with Vanilla ice cream and Caramel sauce. Everyone really liked it. I didn't put in the cardamom because of the cost, and I used a double chocolate beer. The results were great! I did have trouble with it sticking. It didn't want to come out at all! And I got most of it out beautifuly with a little chunk sticking. I used a nonstick bundt pan with crisco, but will definetly flour it next time!

Rating: 3
Excellent cake that's even better the second day. If you don't have stout but still have a dark beer, add some espresso (1-2 tsp. good espresso powder). I also added about 1/8 tsp Kosher salt, given very high altitude that I'm at. Worked out beautifully.

I was really pleased with the flavor of the oatmeal stout. I used my new small, 10-cup Bundt pan, and it fit perfectly. It really made a nice presentation when dusted with powdered sugar he next day. I would bake this cake a day before you plan to serve, since the flavor seems to mellow.

Rating: 4
My first attempt at gingerbread cake, and this one was wonderful! I used Guinness and omitted the cardamom because I didn't have any and a bottle cost around $13! I used a non-stick bundt pan sprayed with Pam and dusted with flour and it did not stick at all. Made 2 days in advance, served with unsweetened whipped cream and it could not have been better.

I made this for an 18th century dinner party. I had looked at Amelia Simmon's book, and was glad to find a modern adaptation. I baked it in Nordic Ware's BUNDTLETTE PAN. The recipe makes 10. I did not have a problem with sticking. They were so good, my family ate the first batch and I had to make more for the party. Served with a choice of whipped cream or hot lemon sauce. Hard to find both coriander and oatmeal stout in my town, but I think it was well worth the search!

Rating: 3
This is one of my most requested recipes. The gingerbread is dense and moist, with a dark, malty flavor. I add a touch more ginger and cinnamon, and don't omit the cardemom. So far I've only made this with the Guinness, but I am itching to try an Oatmeal stout. Keeps well and best served with creme fraiche or sweetened whipped cream. Try this for Christmas rather than fruitcake!

Amazing! As I told a friend...this ain't your grandma's gingerbread! This recipe is complex, spicy, scrumptiously ooey gooey and yum, yum, yummy! The secret to unmolding this cake, so that the chewy coating stays on the cake and not in your pan, is to allow the cake to cook in the pan only slightly before turning it out onto a rack. Enjoy!

Well,I finally made this. After all the glowing reviews, I was terribly disappointed. Maybe it was my fault (my cake was nowhere near done at 50 minutes and required another 10 before I could take it out of the oven) but even though the flavour was good, we thought the texture was unpleasantly gluey and cloying. The lovely sugary crust that some reviewers mentioned stuck to the pan and although the cake came out neatly in one piece, all of that nice coating stayed on the inside of the cake tin. And I did butter and flour thoroughly! Perhaps I should have left it in the oven even longer. I might have tried again with this one if it weren't for the fact that I have another ginger cake recipe that knocks the socks off everyone who tastes it. It has pieces of chopped, crystalized ginger in it and a lemon glaze and the texture is so much better than this cake. Perhaps it'll taste better today as everyone has mentioned how good it is on day two.

This is as good as it gets! Deep and dark, dense and delicious, moist and sinfully good. My bundt was too small so baked in a tube pan. Checked for doneness at 50 min. and it was very jiggley with tester coming out wet, so I returned to oven for another 10 min. but it promptly fell - maybe I bumped/jarred it? However, it was done after the extra 10 min. and tasted marvelous served with an old fashioned lemon sauce drizzled over. Of the many recipes I have made from this site, this is in the Top 10. If you like ginger, then this is definitely the cake for you. Sinfully sumptuous!

Great, great, great recipe!! I've made it twice, and took it out of the oven about 10 minutes prior to the recipe time, ensuring raves for the gingerbread's moistness and density (even for a relatively "light" tasting cake). It's fantastic with oatmeal stout - I used Sam Smith.

This cake is fantastic, and gets better as it ages, particularly if kept in the refrigerator. My mom and I made this exactly as the recipe called for, but we did add rum-soaked raisins (actually, raisins simmered in rum...) as another reviewer recommended. Very moist, very delicious.

Absolutely wonderful. I made this for company over Christmas weekend and got great reviews. It has a great flavor that gets better over time, very rich and comforting.

I rated this one too soon. I didn't like it at all on day 1 plus I had poor results when doubling it.

Yes, I will make this every year now for the holiday.

Outrageous!! This is a great recipe. I added dark rum soaked raisins at the last minute and used stout from a microbrewery here in Maine. Doubled the recipe and made 11 small loaves of bread to give out for Christmas.....there are only 8 loaves left, so I have to make more!

This gingerbread cake/bread is by far, the best food you will taste this holiday. You will definitely add this to your "best of" list. The stout that is used is a great conversation piece. Also, the fact that this recipe goes back to 1796, it is rich with history.

Has anyone else noticed that this is the same recipe as the Gramercy Tavern Ginger cake with one major change: 1 cup each of white sugar and brown sugar. Why did the gourmet recipe double the sugar? Here is the url for the ginger cake: http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=105881. I like the Gourmet recipe, but I thought it seemed heavy on the sugar. Anyone else tries the other and compared the difference? Also, the pan size is 6 cup bundt vs. 10 cup bundt in the gourmet recipe.

Rating: 4
Not for the faint of heart, but an amazing, heavily spiced cake, obscenely moist and flavorful. I didn't have any problem with sticking, but I used small bundt pans (fairly ornate) and butered them very liberally. It's worth tracking down the oatmeal stout for this gingerbread. I tried it with Guiness and, while the result was still superlative, the flavor wasn't quite so complex. One note: if you do decide to use this for a fancy dinner and use small pans, only fill them half-way. I only made six (the recipie would've easily accomodated twice that many) and each cake weighed about a pound.

I made this to take to a Halloween party, and it got absolutely rave reviews from all the guests. I personally found the flavor to be just a little bit too strong, but everybody else thought it was fabulous. It is incredibly moist and looked great on the cake pedestal decorated with strips of candied orange peel. I would definitely make it again, although I might try an different pan, as mine stuck a little, consistent with the experience from the other reviewers.

I have stopped my search for the perfect gingerbread. This is it! The texture is wonderful and the flavor gets better each day you have leftovers (if possible). The spice combination is perfect; not at all too strong. I also had problems with sticking to the pan, even though I buttered and floured. I did use a rather ornate tube pan. Next time I will try a smooth sided pan. This gingerbread is excellent, everyone who comes across this recipe should try it. At the risk of gilding the lily, I am going to make this at Christmas to use in a trifle with lemon curd and whipped cream.

I have made this recipe three times now had have finally moved to a tart type pan with a removable bottom as it always sticks to my Willam Sanoma pretty tube pan. That is not bad because then I can't take it anywhere and have to eat it all myself and I love this gingerbread! I follow the recipe specifically but the first time I mistakenly put too much soda in and the cake was the best that time. The flavor is perfectly spicy and like other readers say, like I remember my grandmother making. I also love the chewy texture.

I'd been searching many years for a recipe that might produce gingerbread as spicy and moist as my Grandmother's, and now I think I've found it. The first time I served it with whipped cream, and the second with Lemon Curd (Gourmet, January 2001). Delicious either way!

After making and tasting this gingerbread, I don't believe I will ever try another recipe. This stuff is unbelievable! Dark, rich, gingery, and it has a great sugar "crust," as one of the other reviewers says. I made the Guinness Stout ice cream (also in Epicurious recipe files) to go along with mine; the two go great together. Make this -- often.

My boyfriend is a huge gingerbread fan and he loved this cake. I did have a little problem with it sticking to my Bundt pan, but got advice on using Crisco and flour and will try that next time. Powdered sugar disguised the flaw. I wouldn't make this for people who aren't big gingerbread fans because it is very strong, but for the right people, it is rich and delicious.

well i liked it. it has an incredibly strong flavor and i accidently used "blackstrap" molasses. i am not sure what difference that made. others thought it was too strong and "pungent". i would make again in the fall and definitely serve it with whipped cream or ice cream to cut in on the flavor.

The best!

I was disappointed with this after all the rave reviews. I found the cake too strong tasting - the Guiness gave it a bitter taste. I was looking for more of a carmel colored, mild tasting gingerbread. This gingerbread has very strong flavors and is very rich. I did not like it at all - some of my office mates thought it was ok.

This gingerbread is BEYOND fabulous. I found the recipe 5 weeks ago and have since made it 3 or 4 times. Everyone raves over it. Then they stuff themselves. I have tried to keep myself from eating it by freezing it, but I love it frozen (slightly thawed) even more than warm! The cake forms a sugary "crust" that seals the moisture in. It really is even better after sitting for a couple of days. I always make it at least 24 hours before a party, but it tastes great regardless. Try the gingerbread with a lemon glaze drizzled over it while still warm. Combine 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice with 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a saucepan. Bring it to a boil to dissolve sugar and remove from heat. Let cool just a bit, and drizzle over the cake. My only trouble with the gingerbread: the crust sometimes sticks to the pan, even if it's well-oiled. I suspect a nonstick pan would produce a more consistently gorgeous cake, but who cares when it tastes so good?

I have been trying numerous gingerbread recipes and found that they never seemed to have enough ginger flavor. Well...not only does this recipe have great ginger flavor, but the oatmeal stout beer and dark molasses give it more depth and complexity than I could have imagined. Next time I may try cutting back a little on the sugar, but I will not change ANYTHING else. My husband and I agreed that we found the perfect gingerbread recipe.

Made it for a birthday party and everyone loved it. I added extra ginger as another reviewer suggested and I was the only one who thought it was a bit sharp. I sent some home with my 11 year old nephew, and he ate it in the car!! I used the recipe for "ginger whipped cream" and paired with the gingerbread, it was out of this world!! I didn't have any sticking problem, used butter and made sure the flour was evenly distributed in the pan. Also, to the novice baker, wisk the sugar and eggs until just blended unless otherwise instructed!!

My boyfriend, who is on a quest to duplicate his Jamaican grandmother's gingerbread, gave this one rave reviews. Great flavor and consistency even on the first day (better the second). Don't be put off by the stout, it seems to add another dimension to the flavor that really is wonderful. I like really spicy gingerbread, and therefore more than doubled the amount of ginger. Definately a favorite.

This is THE best Gingerbread I, my entire family, and my office co-workers have ever eaten. The first time I made it, I used Irish stout (all I could find) and it was great but had a pretty sharp flavor. We loved it tho, so I made it again, this time making it two days ahead so all the flavors could blend and blend. I used Oatmeal Stout the second time, and it was fantastic. Much smoother than the first time w/Irish stout and not as sharp tasting. Sublime! It has become a family favorite (and office request). You will love it, I promise.

Perfect! I've been looking all my life for the perfect gingerbread recipe, and I have finally found it. It is rich without being overpowering, not too sweet, very moist, and very gingery with an aftertaste reminiscent of ginger thins. I cooked it in a springform pan and it worked out fine. I also didn't have dark molasses on hand so I used mild. It tastes fantastic, so I can't wait to try it with dark molasses and see if there is a noticeable difference. I had no sticking problem at all. I generously buttered and floured the pan and it came right out. Next time I will try adding raisins, because they would be such a great match for this recipe. Excellent!
