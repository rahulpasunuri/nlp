These are super easy on the grill instead of frying. Of course, this is just the basic recipe. To get more flavor, use a stock cube instead of salt. Adding jalepenos is perfect to spice up the black bean and sweet potato stew. As a stand-alone dish, simmer a mix of shiitake, oyster and other mushrooms with onion and garlic and then add them to polenta that has been cooked veggie or mushroom stock. Put it all in a big rectangle dish, brown it in the oven a while and serve!

I liked this but not so much the sweet potato and black bean stew.

Three forks if you serve them with the accompanying recipe for sweet potato and black bean stew. I don't believe these were intended to stand on their own, but rather are mildly seasoned so as not to compete with the flavors in the stew. If you want polenta that stands on its own, so to speak, then look elsewhere.

What a bore. I made these to complement the black bean and sweet potato stew. They're a great idea in theory, but with only three ingredients (cornmeal, salt, and water), it shouldn't be surprising that they aren't bursting with flavor. I recommend adding something to give them a kick, because they do hold promise as the perfect compliment to the black bean stew.

I make these ALL the time for a vegetarian polenta burito. Everyone agrees that the trianlges make the meal! Once, i tried to make them with white cornmeal ( didn't have yellow on hand) and it didn't thicken. Other than that i have had no problems with this!

The polenta triangles were a great complement to the black bean and sweet potato stew. I found it took much less time for the polenta to thicken up than the recipie suggested.

This was really bad. There was nothing going on... No herbs, no parmesan, no taste, really...
