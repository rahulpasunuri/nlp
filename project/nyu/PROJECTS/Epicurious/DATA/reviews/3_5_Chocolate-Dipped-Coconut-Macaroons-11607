I've made these delicious morsels and I highly recommend using a small (table spoon size) ice cream scoop, with the squeeze handle, to shape them into a desired size and shape.

Silly me, I wrote a review for the wrong macaroon recipe. So here goes: I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and used unsweetened coconut. Even at that, these macaroons were plenty sweet. I wet my hands and rolled the dough into balls for baking. Definitely use parchment paper for these; otherwise they stick. After cooling, I dipped them in 4 ounces of melted bittersweet chocolate and put them on a foil-lined tray to cool in the frig. They came right off the foil. Delicious!

I've been making these since 1992 and i can never make enough! I cut the sugar to just under 1 cup and I make a batch with milk chocolate and a batch with bittersweet chocolate.

Way too much sugar. Came out dense and hard. Might work as a coconut bar mix with a shortbread base or something but isn't a macaroon. Will keep looking for a lighter, fluffier proper macaroon recipe.

A good recipe but with certain errors; first of all, even after making much smaller portions, the recipe only made 20 macaroons, secondly the amount of chocolated listed in the ingredients is much, much more than necessary - 4oz would be enough, thirdly, it would be easier to remove the macaroons after being baked if they were cooked on a nonstick, baking sheet or a silpat.

These were easy to make, pretty tasty, and looked elegant. I made them as scant tablespoons instead of heaping teaspoons and got exactly 30. I used unsweetened coconut and 1 and 1/4 c sugar, but they were still too sweet for me - next time I think I'll try 3/4 c sugar as well as unsweetened coconut. I baked mine for 20 min and they came out on the crispy side, but within several hours had softened into the chewiness I wanted. One note of warning: I didn't shape the first batch into balls very carefully, as I assumed they would spread a little while baking. They didn't, and so ended up looking misshapen, but I was more careful with the second batch and they were much prettier.

I do a dessert and champagne party every year and made these for the first party several years ago. They have since been a requested staple at the party every year. I add some vanilla paste, but other than that, do not change a thing. My husband and my best friend request an extra batch just so they can split it for themselves for later! When I have been in a hurry for the mixture to chill, I pop it in the freezer and stir it a couple of times, and it cools a lot faster. I have even made these with the dough still slightly warm. Always easy and exceptionally yummy!

Fantastic. I only used 1 cup sugar which was fine. Long process with cooling, baking, cooling, dipping, but worth it!

Love this recipe. Made it based on the other reviews. Never made macaroons before, always bought them at the store. After making them, I don't know that I could ever eat store bought again. They will seem soft when you take them out of the oven but harden on the outside as they cool. I painted the chocolate on with a spatula as this worked better than dipping. Also I used a silicone tray liner and sprayed it lightly with non stick spray. Removed them to a cooling rack immediately and didn't have a problem with sticking. Amazing, even those that don't like coconut loved these cookies.

the cookie was more candy-like in consistency-- chewy and chocolate-covered. everyone seemed to enjoy them. i found them more enjoyable the day after, having been in the fridge and chilled.

These cookies fly off the plate whenever I make them! I have one friend who even asks that I make these instead of buying him presents. I cut the sugar in half, add a little extra vanilla and I drizzle chocolate over the top in addition to coating the bottoms. Make sure to use very high quality dark chocolate for the best contrasty flavor.

Good, crisp macaroons. I was expecting something chewier, but was pleasantly surprised with the crisper (but not to crisp) texture of these macaroons. Definitely beats the ol' standard meringue macaroons. The chocolate was a nice touch.

These were the best macaroons I have ever made! I made some without chocolate and liked them both ways. I used about 1/3 sweetened coconut and 2/3 unsweetened, which made the sugar level about right for my taste.

This was the runaway hit on a large cookie tray. When cooking egg white mixture, stir the bottom frequently and do not allow to brown. I added some melted vegetable shortening to the chocolate to help it set and remain firm at room temperature. Easy preparation and great results.

We made this dish over Passover, using matzoh cake flour instead of regular. My mom had the best time making them and thought it was just the easiest recipe. She also liked that it was one of the few Passover desserts we made that didn't have heavy oil or butter.

Have made these many times and consistently use half unsweetened coconut (King Arthur website) and half sweetened. They have more coconut flavor and are not so nauseatingly sweet. I also barely cool the cookies before touching the surfaces into melted bittersweet chocolate, which results in beautiful patterns.

Near perfect macaroon, in my opinion, definately a keeper. Outside nicely browned with soft, chewey center. A bit difficult to shape, as they're so sticky when raw. I made 12 large-ish macaroons rather than 30 tiny ones, and only dipped half of them in the chocolate. The only "complaint" I had about these was that the ones that were not dipped in the chocolate seemed a bit too sweet to me, so if I make them with no chocolate I'll either decrease the sugar or use unsweetened coconut.

I really love these cookies! I've dipped them in chocolate and also plopped a hershey kiss in the middle after they came out of the oven (but I prepare the cookie itself with half the sugar called for). Fabulous with morning coffee.

This is the best macaroon recipe ever. I don't dip them in chocolate but I'm sure they'd be great with chocolate too. Everytime I make these people go crazy over them. They stay nice a plump and don't flatten out and run everywhere.

delicious - my family ate the cookies before they were cool enough to dip in the chocolate. next time i'll hide them.

crust is TOO CRISPY. it's hard actually... VERY DISAPPOINTING. I was expecting some soft chewy macaroons but it came out as crispy coconut balls. not very appetizing

I won the Christmas cookie contest with these cookies. I did have a hard time forming the pyramids, but used a scoop to put them on the trays, then gently mold each mound. That's only if you want the pyramid shape. For the kids I made small size balls and coated it with chocolate after. The best macaroons I have ever made.

Rating: 4
I've made these 2 times now, and both times they got RAVE reviews. Followed the recipe almost exactly. Instead of forming pyramids I used a small ice-cream scoop. Instead of dipping the cookies I drizzled them with the chocolate cream. YUMMY!

I skipped the chocolate part and added these to an assortment of fruit for dipping in chocolate fondue. I was so relieved to find a recipe for this that wasn't either made with condensed milk or just a coconut meringue. (I feel like every time I use condensed milk it has this funny taste. Tried ice cream once. Bleck.) I'm a big fan of these, though.

Rating: 3
I too used unsweetened coconut and went even further by reducing the sugar by two table spoons. The outcome was wonderful. Definitely enough sweeteness. They look beautiful and my housemate was "oh my godding " them. They are the perfect little cookie. Plan on giving them to friends and sticking the rest in the fridge for an indulgent snack.

I like the flavor of the finished macaroons, but, I think that I must have overcooked them in the first stage. The macaroons that I made are a distant cousin to the light ones mentioned by others. I will try them again.

These are amazing cookies. A big hit at Christmas. Not sure why people are suggesting using milk chocolate instead of bittersweet. The sugar in the cookies mixes wonderfully with the bittersweet chocolate -- no need for the extra sugar in milk chocolate. Be sure to use use a high quality chocolate like Scharfenberger or Valrhona. And don't overcook in the saucepan or the stove or they will turn out too chewy -- but still delicious. :)

Delicious! These were a big hit in our holiday care packages. Beware of overcooking the coconut balls - ours were a little tough from baking too long. Also, I would consider increasing the amount of milk chocolate in the topping to make it less bitter.

Excellent flavor and texture. I recommend melting the chocolate in the sauce pan with the rest of the ingredients--very good this way and a big hit at the holiday party.

A great recipe. I made them for a baby shower, and instead of using dark chocolate, I melted white chocolate, and tinted 1/2 blue, 1/2 pink. Very attractive and tasty!

I made these for a bake sale and they sold out...very delicious. A different approach to the chocolate step is to let the liquid chocolate drip from a spoon and "stripe" it, it's a beautiful effect.

I don't normally make macaroons but this recipe was very good and easy to do -- it just takes some time (cooling down the mixture until cold took an hour and a half). Make them the day before you want them, they taste better and you won't be pushed for time.

Followed the recipe to the letter, and these are waaaaay too sweet. Won't make them again. But I LOVE epicurious.com and have had happy results from many recipes on this site!

Yummers! I had less than 30 total macaroons, so plenty of chocolate for dipping. I ended up doing them in their entirity, and also ended up regretting not following the "foil-covered pan" tip in the recipe. Anyway, I did finally manage to dislodge them all, and they are superb! Like delightful little coconut bonbons! Definitely worth the first portion of the recipe, stirring the batter, when I thought my arm was going to break off from fatigue!

Rating: 4
Yummy! the only thing I changed was to toast the coconut and let it cool before adding it to the saucepan. It seemed to cut down on the moisture of the cookies. I was surprised at how crunchy they were under the chocolate. I think mine were *way* too big since I only got 10 out of this batter, but the consistancy was fine.

Made these for easter. Were delicious and received many compliments. Easy too. I used semi-sweet choc which was good too but next time will go to specialty store for the bittersweet. Next time will also cut down on sugar a tad. One of my favorite treats!

Wow, were these good. We baked them in a mini-muffin tin, using foil liners (spray liners thoroughly with oil). Increased baking time about 10 minutes til crust was the color of toasted coconut. Macaroons lifted out easily for dipping, and made a neat presentation in their little foil cups. An easy and delicious holiday dessert.

These are a favorite of all my friends. The key is to cook the mixture so that it is really thick and REALLY pulling away from the pan--however, you have to be dilligent about stirring it constantly to avoid scorching. A delicious and elegant cookie!
