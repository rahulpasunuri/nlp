I made this last night as an appetizer for a dinner party and WOW, this was smash hit. I did as the others had suggested and cut the oil back to a half cup and it was still wonderful! It was rich and tasty and the bread was great for the broth that was left over. My guest just couldnt stop raving about it.

We've made this many times. 2 helpful hints: 1 - Dump in everything at the beginning. Don't keep the parsley out or else it won't blend with the other flavors as well. It's also a LOT easier and you cna just eat out of the pot. 2 - We like cilantro in this better than parsley. Enjoy!

Did not thing this was as good as every one else, a waste of expensive saffron next time i will try some Thai spice for a little more zing.

This was fantastic and extremely easy. I would definitely make this again. I agree with previous comments that the oil can be halved.

This was so amazing. We were spooning up the broth when the bread was gone. I only used half as much olive oil, and it was plenty buttery enough. Also, I used 2 dozen very small littlenecks, and it served 2 people as a main course (I served it with a chilled spinach soup). I didn't think the lemon was necessary. it didn't really add anything to the taste. This was my first experience cooking clams, and I will definitely try it again.

Wow! This was not only a beautiful presentation, but enticing to the tastebuds! I used Manila clams instead, and they were wonderful. Be sure to have a nice French bread to sop up the broth. Delicious!

This is one of our all time favorite recipes! I typically wish to try so many recipes--therefore I do not prepare many twice. This is a to die for exception!---Need good bread for juices. It is OK to go a little lighter on the oil. My guests have loved this recipe--Enjoy!!
