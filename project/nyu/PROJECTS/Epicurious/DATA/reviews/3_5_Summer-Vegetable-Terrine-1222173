Does no one at Epicurious read the reviewers' comments? This recipe from 2006 has constantly been identified as 'Vegetarian'. However, as most reviewers have pointed out, using gelatin (instead of agar agar) makes this a non-vegetarian dish. PLEASE, Epicurious, Pay attention and be more helpful.

No rating just a comment. Most of the reviews complained because it is not vegetarian. No where do I see that it is supposed to be. It says "Summer Vegetable Terrine" not Vegetarian Terrine.

I was excited to try this until I noticed it was NOT VEGETARIAN. Quite disappointing.

I was thinking about saving this recipe until I noticed that it is not vegetarian. Substitute agar agar and it will be. There are already a litany of reviews that are saying the same thing. Maybe it will prevent people making a non-vegetarian dish for vegetarians and perhaps Epicurious will relabel this recipe.

This terrine can be made into a vegetarian dish by substituting equal amounts of Agar Agar for the gelatin.

Agreed with other posters - this is NOT vegetarian and really needs that label removed. I'd hate to see someone make this for a vegetarian guest and find out the hard way we can't eat gelatin.

I saw this recipe in the "Our Favorite Vegetarian Recipes" section of this site, however GELATIN is not vegetarian. Please don't mislead readers, as someone who is not vegetarian may be looking for a vegetarian recipe to serve a guest, and this most certainly is not one.

Vegetarians do not use gelatin. There is the alternative, Agar Agar, but not sure of proportions.

The NJ cook is right. I would never consider this on a vegetarian menu.

Looks nice, but it is definitely not vegetarian. Gelatin is collagen processed from animal hides and bones. I guess according to snopes.com the federal government doesn't consider it a meat product, but, inmho that's just silly. It comes from a dead animal.

This is a light terrine that is incredibly impressive to present and very flavorful. A wonderful spring-time dish.

This delicious recipe made a stunning addition at a recent pot-luck supper. It is perfect for summer dining and looks simply gorgeous. It was fun too - although very time-consuming. I'd do it again.

I followed the recipe carefully and the reward was magnificent. The terrine was stunning to look at and everyone loved it.
