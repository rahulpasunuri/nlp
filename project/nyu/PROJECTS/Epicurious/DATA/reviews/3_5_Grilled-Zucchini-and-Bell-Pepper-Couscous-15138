Easy, delicious twist on regular couscous. I roasted the veggies because it was raining and I couldn't BBQ and it was delicious like that. I didn't bother mashing the garlic and salt together (just sauteed the garlic before adding the broth).

We bought Roasted Garlic and Olive Oil Couscous at Walmart and used the spice pack. Goes great with grilled chicken. This recipe is well worth the trouble!

Very interesting dish! Grilled zucchini made it really enjoyable. Next time I will be more careful with cumin seeds, it was too new and strange taste for me.

This was a terrific recipe! So easy, I whipped it up in record time because I was in a hurry. I used several vegetables to grill: red peppers, yellow squash, baby eggplant, and zucchini. I tossed them in balsamic vinegar and olive oil and s&p before I threw them on the grill. Then I chopped them up and added to the couscous. I didn't bother with making a paste of the garlic, I just tossed it all together. Served with skewered grilled shrimp (recipe on here as Grilled Shrimp with Garlic and Rosemary), excellent dinner in 1/2 an hour!
