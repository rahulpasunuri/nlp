I believe the cooking should of been executed differently. Render the sausage first, then add veggies. Use any firm fish and shellfish of choice. The broth was flat, even with some red pepper flakes.

This was nice, but there are plenty of other Portuguese Stews and Chowders out there that are more worthy of your fish bucks. Jasper White's South Coast Portuguese Fish Chowder is just one example.

This was a fabulous recipe! If you used fresh ingredients and your own twist on the seasonings this will not disappoint.

Well maybe I'm not a fish stew fan. I tried the Provencal Stew recipe before I meade this and thought it someone bland. This one was better, but.... How are you going to get a good brought if you don't even put the fish in the soup?

So good I wanted to cry. After the first step of steeping the saffron threads in the heated wine, which made the most beautiful and fragrant red saffron tea, I knew this dish was going to be a winner. I used white meat chicken sliced into thin strips in place of the saugage for a more diet-conscious version and I had no complaints. I served mine with dollop of spoonbread dropped in the bowl alongside the shellfish.

Couldn't get mussells or saffron. I used factroy-block cod, shrimp, & littlenecks seasoned with 2 Tbs. Stonewall Kitchen Seafood & Veggie spice rub. I added frozen peas and cubed parboiled Yukon gold potatoes. It should have been 2 tsp of the Seafood spice rub. My bad. For stock, I used Twin Seafood's, West Concord, frozen fish stock. The cod block flaked easily and was wicked delicate to handle. It wanted to fall apart. The corn meal was not eager to affix itself to the cod. Very taxing. I finished the cod in the microwave after the crust was fixed instead of in with the soup, Thus preventing the cod from total flaky disintegration. The Reviews: Brenda said it was salty but good. Olivia ate 5 bites then didn't like it any more. Sam went to a concert in town. I thought it was excellent and pretty easy. Brenda thought it was much much better today after sitting 1 day. The wine: Terruzzi and Puthod Terre di Tufi 2005. Here's the rap on the 2004. It's only 1 digit away from 5, so calm down. WINE SPECTATOR ONLINE 88 points: "Fresh white, with ripe lemon and lime and a hint of toasty honey character. Medium-bodied, with a fresh palate and minerally finish. Always very good. Like it a lot, as usual. Drink now." WINERY NOTES: "Considered the finest examples of a White "Super Tuscan" this blend of mostly Vernaccia with a small amount of Chardonnay will be a perfect companion to Spring Food including, hor's d'oeuvres, all types of seafood and shellfish, roast veal with zucchini and pasta with pesto sauce." Personally, I especially liked the notes of lime. 'Till next time, bon apetit.

I have made this dish several times for different guests all to wonderful reviews. The only changes that I have made is substituting shrimp for the mussels (my husband dislikes them) and using ground safflower rather than pricy saffron threads when I ran out of them. I throw a dozen of large shelled shrimp into the stew for the last minute or so, until they turn pink. The last time I made this dish I used ground linguica (I already had it in the freezer) rather than cutting the sausage links into chunks. I think it made the stew even tastier! I always serve it with crusty bread for dunking and a salad and can tell you that not only is the presentation beautiful, but there has never been a drop left at the end of any meal! Great dish that is relatively easy to put together.

I followed this to the T and it was just so so. Wife and daughter agreed. It was bland. Sorry. I wouldn't waste my time on this again.

Delish! I substituted frozen haddock filets for the cod. I fried them completely done and put them in a 200 degree oven to stay warm while I prepared the broth. I cooked some spaghetti and poured the broth and seafood on top. I flanked the fish on each side in hubby's bowl since I thought he might complain about soggy fish. However, I put mine in the center of the bowl and ladled the broth over it. For 1/2 the recipe I used one very spicy gourmet green-chili sausage link from Costco. I agree with others that the fried fish adds to the stew and distinguishes it from others similar. Thanks to Legal Seafoods (one of our favorite restaurants) for supplying the recipe. Half of the recipe fed two big eaters amply.

This recipe is delicious and very special.. my dear friend/sister has made it for me on many special occasions, and now we live apart, but i make it for my loved ones. Always a big hit!

Fearing my husband's somewhat limited palate would balk at the mussels and clams, I substituted lobster tails and served this up for Valentine's dinner... and it was a hit! (though the recipe as written would be more prettily symmetrical in the dish, and I may force the mussels on him next time). Couldn't get cod and used wild perch instead, which worked out fine. Seemed to need a bit more broth than as written, so I threw in about a half cup more wine at the end. Yum.

This dish sounds soooo delicious, I can't wait to try it. For anyone looking for Saffron, you can find it at any Middle Eastern food store. It's used a lot in middle eastern cooking and they don't charge that much. I've bought it for $3 for a good size compressed tsp. Good Luck!

Wonderful recipe! I'm too cheap to slap down $21 for saffron threads, so I used 2 t of hot Szeged paprika instead, and it tasted great. Used sole instead of cod fillets - they kinda fell apart but the flavor was still there. Excellent, fun recipe.

Wow! I've made this one twice in a week now. It was so good I made it for company and everyone asked for the recipe! I live in a boring suburb and I couldn't find saffron at the local supermarkets, but I knew it was important. Instead, I bought one of those packages of Carolina Yellow Saffron rice. I sifted out the powder and used that with the wine. I also tossed a good handful of rice into the stew while it was cooking. Don't hesitate to try this one! I substituted shrimp for mussels and clams the second time (throw them in at the last minute) and it was just as good!

I'll add my kudos. Even my husband, Mr.s "Oh, you're trying some new fancy schmancy recipe?" with a look of apprehension, LOVED this one.

This is such a flavorful combination of tastes and textures. If one is careful in cooking and presenting the cod, you can keep the delightful crisp corn meal crust that contrasts so nicely with the broth and other ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly as printed and would not change a thing

Originally had this dish at Legal Seafood in Washington DC. Followed the recipe exactly and have never been disappointed! Guests are blown away by this one.

This was a lunch dish that I made for friends visiting from San Diego. I had been looking at the recipe for months, and I just wanted an excuse to try it. I thought it was very good, and they told my they thought it was great. My husband loved the left-overs. For desert I also made the Orange Cake with Orange Cream Chesse Frosting with Blueberries. That recipe can also be found on this site.

Technically, I would not make this dish again, since my wife is the cook!!! Having said that, we have had the dish four times in the past four weeks and I can't tell you how much we enjoy it each time. It is fast becoming one of our favorite dish. It is so tasty and healthy. We had it last night for a small dinner party and served it with two New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs - Selaks 1999 and Villa Maria 1998. My wife says it is also a cinch to cook, but then she is a Cordon Bleu graduate. Thanks and best regards, Rurik Halaby We had it last

An excellent dish for seafood lovers like us. We have used smoke sausage one time and Italian the next; both bringing different flavors to the broth. Don't forget to include sourdough bread to soak up the soup.

When I went searching for the spicy portuguese-style Manhattan clam chowder that my grandmother used to make and couldn't find it, I used the basics from this to alter other chowder receipes. This helped me find out how my grandmother used to cook. It's the saffron that did it. I also added red pepper flakes to give it some kick, two bay leaves and more vegetables (potatoes and celery), as well as eliminating the fish and using just clams. A little tomato paste thickened up the soup perfectly.

Wow! what a great recipe.I served it to our family and received so many compliments that it will definitely be cooked again. The next time I intend to add some potatoes, cut into 2 inch cubes to add some consistency.

I had this in Lisbon, Portugal a few years ago. I came home and tried to remember and copy the ingredients, but never really got it right. This recipe is RIGHT! We ate this outdoors, looking over the water, with fantastic wine and sopped up the soup with heavy bread. Truly a keeper!

I had this stew at Legal Seafood in Boston and it was wonderful. It's just as great at home!
