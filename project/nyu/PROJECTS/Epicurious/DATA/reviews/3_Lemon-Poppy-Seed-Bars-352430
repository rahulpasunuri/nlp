strange directions for cooking the lemon curd, step 2 boil? for two minutes. I always thought that if you are cooking with cornstarch you bring it to a boil then once the pudding covers the back of a spoon its done cooking, But I've never made an egg custard like thing before. any thoughts would be appreciated.

This took me about 1 hour to prepare. I took it to a potluck and 10 of us shared it. After we each had one piece, there were two pieces left. Everyone was vying for them, it was delicious. I used fresh lemon juice and zest which I am sure enhanced the flavor.
