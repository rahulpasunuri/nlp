This is a great recipe, you can add blueberry or peaches to this, or both replacing the apples. The biscuits recipe rules!!

This was ever so tasty, if you can live with all the butter that goes into it. The biscuits were the best part: super-dense, buttery, and lightly sweet. The apple mixture, while delicious (loved the apricot and orange zest) turned out runny in the end for me, is that normal? Next time I would add some cornstarch to make it gel more. In any case, once you cut into the biscuits they do a great job of soaking up all the warm fruit juices. I substituted amaretto for the brandy, by the way.

The creator of this recepie has turned a very simple traditional southern desert into something difficult. In this case simplicity is better. The key to a great cobbler is fresh fruit and simply dumping the batter over the fruit and not mixing it. For those of you who are not from the south, truly delicious biscuits do not come from recepies. Ask any southern woman what the exact measurements of the ingerdients to her biscuits are and she wont be able to tell you. It's just a feeling not a cup or tablespoon.

This was delicious! I thought it would be difficult to make, messy too, but it was incredibly easy.

I was on the quest for the perfect cobbler / biscuit recipe and tries several recipes. This is it. I do use White Lily flour and the biscuits are the tenderiest lightest I have made! I usually make the biscuits and use them for strawberry shortcake. YUM! The apple part is good but the biscuits are the best.

I haven't made this, but I find it far too "complicated" and rich for a simple cobbler and would not bother attempting. I have a much simpler and good recipe. To me, simpler is good.
