So simple, yet incredibly elegant. I used a smaller pear and the portion was just right...a larger pear would almost be too much. I didn't have any dessert wine, so I added a bit of honey to cheap sauvignon blanc I use for cooking and it had a lovely flavor. Instead of doing the custard sauce, I spooned some of the liquid over the pears (which I did dust with cinnamon) and then swirled a bit of warm store-bought caramel sauce around it. This would make a wonderful dessert for Thanksgiving dinner!

I tried this recipe again but put a twist on the sauce... I reduced the cooking liquid from the pears until it became coat-the-back-of-a-spoon thick, then added about twice as much heavy cream and heated to a simmer. At that point I turned off the heat and melted several ounces of semi-sweet *dark* chocolate into the sauce. The cholocate I use is 85% cacao solids, which works great. The resulting sauce is really rich and complex, with the fruity flavors of the pears and raisins melding nicely with the heavy chocolate . I bet it would be even better with the pecans mentioned by the previous reviewer.

Very light in calories but fantastic tasting. I added roasted and chopped pecans to the raison mixture, which really made the taste fantastic.

Elegant and very easy if you skip the custard sauce. The syrup is delicious as is. I dusted the pears with a little cinnamon before baking and the final presentation was a notch nicer. I've also tried this replacing the brown sugar with crushed gingerbread to reduce the sugar content. Hungarian Tokaj Aszu is an excellent substitute for French Sauternes.

The pears were good but the custard sauce was a bit of a let-down. It didn't firm up and became more like an egg yolk syrup than a sauce. I would not make it again.

A little challenging to make the first time, but well worth the effort! Beautiful presentation and our guests loved it.

Iprepared this recipe for my wifes birthday party and it was the hit of the party. I would definitly make this again. In preparing the sauce the bowl should be almost completely immerse in the simmering water.
