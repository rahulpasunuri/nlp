This was my first time trying lentils. I used a good quality balsamic instead of red wine vinegar and more of it...delicious. Would make again.

This was fantastic. I made it vegetarian with Boca italian sausage and was generous with the red wine vinegar. Yum! I will definitely make it again- it is healthy and very tasty.I do suggest making at least a double recipe- it only makes enough for about 1.5 servings- my 2 yr old (She loved it!) & I ate it all and had to make more for my husband when he got home!

This stumbling cook found WLSw/S to be easy to follow, inexpensive, and surpisingly unique in flavor given the fairly standard ingredients. Great for lunch.

I don't like lentils, but we had some so I tried this. Substituted anise for celery (out of celery) and it was excellent. Easy to fix and great flavors, and the lentils tasted wonderful. Probably healthy, too, not that it matters. Will make again for sure.

We didn't care for this recipe at all. I thought it was bland and far too lentilly. Make sure to use high quality, tasty sausage for this recipe.

I have made this recipe three times and have been very pleased with the results. Interesting change of flavors occur when I substitute green onion or apple/feta sausage. An excellent lunch choice.
