I made this with a baguette, regular butter, sea salt, cherry belle radishes and arugula. It was a great way to use radishes, since they aren't usually everyone's favorite. I put my kids in charge of making it, and they had a great time. It was a hit! Will definitely make again.

Delicious & gorgeous. Have made twice now with Easter Egg radishes, both times for parties, and I was suprised what a hit they were. Couldn't find ficelle, so subsituted ciabatta, sliced thin and toasted.
