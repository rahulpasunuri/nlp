Wonderful! I made the beans from scratch. Soaked over night then put in the slow cooker in the morning with the garlic, sage etc as per recipe from this site. After 8 hours they were still quite firm so I transferred to a pot and simmered until liquid reduced and beans were tender. Save the liquid!! Use it instead of water when making the dish. Lovely and so simple. I don't think canned beans would compare but would probably use them in a pinch.

Liked this very much. I did tweak it a lot to incorporate members'comments and to suit my tastes: browned turkey sausage first, sauteed 1 finely diced small onion and 1/2 c. carrot before adding garlic, used dry white wine instead of water, and 28 oz fire roasted tomatoes. Had no sage so used fresh thyme and added a pinch of red pepper flakes. At the end added a bunch of chopped fresh spinach. I kept it a bit soupy. Delicious.

I made the mistake of not cooking the sausages long enough at first, it is definitely important to get the sausages nice and browned before continuing on the the following steps!

I took the other reviewer's idea about using wine (red) instead of water. I'd also suggest using more plum tomatoes to give the dish more flavor.

I made this dinner for the second time tonight. It is delicious! A couple of changes: I browned the sausages and THEN added the garlic so it wouldn't burn. Also, I substituted white wine for the water.

This was good, not great, but it was super easy for a weeknight. I had left-over white beans from a dish I'd made earlier, but I think canned would be fine, which is probably what I'd ususally use. Next time I'll add a bit of the other suggestions to liven it up a bit.

Tasty and easy week night menu option. I like many others used canned beans, added rosemary, red pepper flakes and used way more tomatoes. I also threw in lots of extra green veggies from kale to peas to make it a complete meal. I also added fresh Parmesan which I recommend highly!

This was a simple and easy weeknight dinner. I took a few shortcuts - used canned beans and added thyme, rosemary and sage to the sauce. I also started with 1/2 onion, which I carmelized. Lastly, I added about 1 tablespoon of anchovy paste to the tomato sauce -- I would have added it to the carmelized onions but didnt think of it. Very tasty.

While this was very good, it didn't quite live up to my expectations after reading so many rave reviews. I made the beans from scratch using the recommended recipe. Had to cook them for over 3 hours until they were remotely tender (old beans, perhaps?) I agree with the suggestion made by several other cooks regarding the garlic--don't add it before the sausages, or it will be overcooked and crunchy. One change I made was to add another 10 oz. or so of tomatoes, and at the end I threw in some spinach so I didn't have to cook a separate green. On the up side, my kids loved it. I just thought it could have been more flavorful. I did use chicken sausage instead of pork--maybe that affected the flavor. Would try it again, maybe with crumbled Italian pork sausage instead and some crushed red pepper to kick it up a notch.

This was a fantastic and easy dinner! I used spicy chicken sausage instead and it turned out really well. Due to time limits, I also used canned beans and they were perfectly fine.

had made cannellini w/garlic and sage earlier in month and used half for the white bean and squid salad (delicious!) and froze the rest...pulled out for this dinner. I also pulled sausage from casing and crumbled to brown, then proceeded to follow recipe..had to use add'l liquid (homemade chicken broth) and threw in a little more red pepper flakes for the hubby. Served with toasted baugette slices and garlic puree. Very good!

I just love this dish. Have made it with canned beans only, used 1/2 of the bean liquid, as I didn't cook with dried beans. So good, so flavorful.

I second the "grown-up beenie weenies" sentiment. I used canned beans (A mix of cannellinis and great northerns) to make this an extra fast, extra comforting dinner. Added a green salad. Delicious.

Delicious. I started with the dried beans. Rather than soaking overnight, which I'm never organized enough to do, I followed Mark Bittman's quick soak method for beans: In a pot, cover beans with 2 inches of water. Bring to a boil & boil 2 minutes uncovered. Turn off heat, cover pot, and let stand 2 hours. (It's best to do this earlier in the day.) At this point, the beans were ready to be used in the Cannellini Beans with Garlic and Sage recipe. One other change: I substituted rosemary for the sage. I'm not a big fan of sage, and I love white beans with rosemary. This is defintely a keeper.

Used Italian sausage and garlic bacon sausage, plus pancetta. Also, we roasted the tomatoes first. Beans were so creamy. Served it with creamy polenta from this site.

This was a great way to get the kids to eat a few beans (stuck to the sausage). The dish was delicious. I agree with adding the garlic later; mine browned. I also used 2 cans of tomatoes (I like tomatoes) and also added some coarsely chopped kale during the last 30 minutes, which was quite tasty!

I too cheated and used canned beans, only because the store didn't have dried ones. But I don't think that it really mattered - as the recipe was wonderful! The beans were perfectly mushy and flavorful.

This was a fabulous dish. We made the beans from scratch and they seemed to never quite get really soft but it didn't matter. We've made this a couple time since. Its a keeper!

This dish was delicious! We made the beans from scratch ( canelli beans with garlic and sage recipe from this site)and they were so good! We can't even imagine how canned beans would work half as well. The only changes we made were we used a 28 oz can of tomatoes ( this was not too much tomato in our opinion) and we used hot sausage instead of sweet ( gave a great warmth to the meal). We also followed others advice and browned the sausage before adding the garlic. Add some crusty bread and this was a fantastic meal. Just perfect on a cool fall night. We can't wait to make it again!

Was great. Whele I did make some modificaions in the Cannellini Beans with Garlic and Sage per reviews on that recipe's page (also check my review of that recipe), I really didn't modify this particular one. It was delicious.

Hearty, easy, delicious, inexpensive. A green salad made this a complete meal.

Simple and hearty, easy to make with ingredients we usually have on hand. A green salad on the side made for a healthy, complete meal.

I thought this was really tasty, and a perfect fall/winter dish. Next time I will not add the garlic until the last minute or so while the sausages are browning; my garlic was sticking and getting burned, so I had to add the liquids before my sausages were nicely browned. I made the cannellini beans from scratch using the recipe on this site.

Followed the recipe almost to the letter. Only change was to remove the garlic before the sausages finished browning to prevent the garlic from over-browning. It was worth the effort to cook the beans from scratch. Sage was perfect herb for this dish. Leftovers were delicious, too.

Followed receipe exactly except that I used smoked zesty italian sausage as that was what I had on hand. It was good but not as flavorful as I would have liked. It was better the second day - but I would not try this again. There's too many good receipes out that to spend more time on this one.

This was outstanding! I used canned cannellini, which I think is fine due to all the flavors that come out of the sausage. I used 4 cans of beans, which worked out to about 5 cups, and from two of them included the water they were in. I used a 28oz. can of plum tomatoes without the juice and probably 8 cloves of garlic, half crushed, half minced. Next time I will probably mince all of the garlic as the crushed garlic eventually burned. Absolutely delicious recipe. Will definitely make again many times this winter.

Pretty good. My only complaint would be that I thought the sage imparted too strong of a (soapy) flavor to the dish. I would use just 3 or 4 fresh leaves instead of an entire sprig, unless you love sage.

I enjoyed the simplicity of this dish. I did use canned beans and downsized it for two of us--one can white beans, three sausages, 3 cloves garlic, one 14 oz. can diced tomatoes, sage. Easy and good.

I made this recipe with the white bean recipe from the magazine. I wonder if I had overcooked the beans or messed up the proportions because the beans didn't absorb the tomato sauce and the final dish was watery -- but still tasty. I would make it again with chicken instead of sausages.

I use garlic from the Cannellini beans recipe and use about 1c of my favorite marinara. I think you have to use a good marinara though, one that's mainly just tomatoes, garlic, and basil. I've made this twice and kid and husband love it. Second time made it for a group of friends and got rave reviews and requests for the recipe. Great alternative to the usual pasta.

I find the casings from Italian sausage to be NASTY. Plus having to use a knife to cut them up while eating takes away from the rustic comfort of the dish. So I removed the sausage from the casing (getting about four lumps of casing-less sausage per link). It was wonderful, and the sausage flavor really infused the beans. Plus we could eat it with spoons!

I cheated and used canned beans. It was delicious! It's like eating a grown up version of beenie weeinies. The dish was flavorful and very easy. Everyone loved it. I wouldn't change a thing.

Loved this one for fantastic flavor and ease of prep. I used 3 cans White Kidney beans (since I didn't have time to soak overnight). Next time I might use a little spicy sausage to add some heat. Didn't add any salt, the canned beans had plenty. If you're salt sensitive, I'd rinse the beans.

Good flavour and simple, but the garlic should be cooked after the sausages are browned, to avoid burning the garlic.

I loved this recipe. I used canned beans and it tasted just fine. I'm too unorganized to plan ahead for dried beans. With the leftovers I sliced up the sausage and mixed in a bag of fresh spinach until it was wilted and covered in the sauce. It was great. I will definitely be making this again and adding in the spinach.

A nice winter comfort dish. I cooked the white beans in a crockpot during the day and then combined the rest of the ingredients for the final dish in 30 minutes. I added 2 sausages instead of the full amount and 1 can diced tomatoes. Really tasty!

I really loved this recipe. Made the beans from scratch as suggested and although I can see how canned would work well and is a ton easier, I really liked the texture of the beans. Although, next time, I think I will doctor this up with a little cayenne pepper and take the sausage out of the casing and crumble it up to mix in with the beans.

Made the full recipe of white beans from scratch, without soaking overnight. Only used half of them for this comforting, rustic dish - then again, I only used about 3/4 lb of Italian sausage (half mild, half spicy). With adjustments (for my smaller household), this was a nice stewy dinner, with plenty of juice for dipping good bread. Was just as tasty, if not better, the next 2 days for lunch. Next time: consider canned beans, although using dried was painless, just not fast. Would serve over some polenta. Ooh, with sauteed broccoli rabe. Yum.

Wow, I loved this dish--and it tasted even better the next day. Went to considerable trouble making the beans from scratch, per the accompanying recipe, but I'm not sure that's even necessary. I might try it with rinsed canned beans next time, doctored up a bit with extra garlic and sage, to see if corner cutting is feasible.
