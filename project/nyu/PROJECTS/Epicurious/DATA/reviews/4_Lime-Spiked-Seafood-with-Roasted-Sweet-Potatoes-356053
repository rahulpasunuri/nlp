I was surprised by how good this was, and the hubs wants it to go in the 'make it again' file. My pantry forced me to make a couple very minor changes: butternut squash instead of sweet potato (I cubed it, tossed it in ghee, and roasted it until it caramelized); ghee instead of olive oil; and shrimp instead of scallops. It was pretty on the plate, too, all heaped up in a mountain of goodness with cilantro on top.

Doubled the recipe for dinner for three - definitely had an extra serving of food. VERY rich. Only changes we made is we halved the pepper because my dining partners were wimps. Could still taste the heat, but it was much more subtle. We were very skeptical to begin with cause it didn't look like it would have much flavor, but it was awesome. Very easy, pretty fool proof, and plenty of food.

I tripled the recipe for family dinner, which was a bit dangerous but worked out well. Everyone loved it -- it's like a deconstructed/reconstructed fish chowder, which is why all the ingredients work well together. There were a few comments that echoed other reviewers (cream a little rich for one, sweet potatoes a touch strange for another), but consensus was overwhelmingly positive. I had to use a jalapeno and was afraid to make the dish overly hot so didn't triple the quantity there -- there was no heat at all, though. Will rectify the next time out. Pretty easy, too.

This was absolutely delicious! I loved the complexity of the flavors. I'm pregnant and it made me feel like I was eating ceviche (which I really miss!). The only thing I want to find a substitute for is the heavy cream. I will try using half and half next time.

Simply amazing. I made this exotic, delicious meal for my parents' 44th wedding anniversary earlier this year. Let me just say, it pairs perfectly with champagne! I love that it's light but filling and really captures the soul of ethnic cooking. The smells while it was cooking were magnificent. I would order this in a restaurant any day and can't wait to make it again for my fiance!

I thought the flavors in this were unexpected and awesome; my boyfriend asked me not to make it again. Based on the mix of reviews, that just about sums up how divided opinion of this dish is. I agree with one reviewer who said that if they make it again, they'll do it over pasta. The seafood sauce is really tangy and interesting - maybe it just doesn't belong with sweet potatoes (God love 'em).

Also made with just salmon as I detest scallops (is it just me that thinks they taste like soap?) and also used creme fraiche instead of heavy cream. I also had mistakenly used up all my sweet potatoes earlier in the week so ended up serving over rice, which was very nice. A lovely fresh tangy combination with just the right amount of heat and very pretty with the colours of the ingredients - I will definitely make again.

I really enjoyed the fish & the sauce (I too tinkered w/ the recipe & only used salmon). However, as much as I love sweet potatoes, I found the combination didn't work. The sweet potatoes have their own strong taste, which didn't gel with the sauce. Next time I'd use rice, risotto or pasta.

I didn't have enough lime juice- so in addition to the lime juice, I added some (of course-freshly squeezed) lemon juice. I also served it along side with some garlic stir-fried swiss chard- YUM :oP

I cannot explain how embarassingly wonderful this recipe is other than to say that we sat at the kitchen table literally humming as we ate it. No two bites taste the same and the explosions of the different ingredients tantalize the entire mouth. Well done! Will make this again and again!

My husband enjoyed this but I wasn't crazy about it. The flavors seemed strange together - fish and sweet potatoes. I won't be making this one again.

My Ecuadorian husband (who knows how delicious seafood should taste) said that this was "muy rico", a great combination of both sweet and salty, and very fresh tasting. Even our 3 year-old daughter enjoyed it... the scallops especially, believe it or not! Definitely a recommended dish.

I made this last night, and it was amazing. The flavors and textures are unique. I went precisely by the recipe, only adding more onions as suggested by some. I also used butter and a little olive oil to carmelize them. My only negative comment is that one person cannot make this, start to finish, in 25 minutes. If you do the prep work ahead of time, you can cook it in 25 minutes, and if you had someone to help with the chopping, etc., you could probably do it in that time.

I wish I could have given it no forks. It was bland and heavy and didn't smell that great. I followed the recipe exactly. The only redeeming things about the whole concoction were the sweet potatos and the cilantro which masked the taste a bit. Thank god it didn't take that long to make!

trust me...cod and shrimp are just as good in this recipe. i also tossed my sweet potatoes in some olive oil, salt and pepper. to lighten it up a bit i used half and half instead of heavy cream. i'm usually not one to make so many changes the first time i try a recipe but they all worked.

I thought this was delicious, like the other reviewers. I doubled the Salmon, as they were out of scallops at the grocery. Yum, yum! The only thing I'd change is the heavy cream in this recipe. For me, it was actually a little too much. I'd probably cut with white wine or veggie broth.

Whole family LOVED it! So simple but so flavorful! Keep in mind that the ingredients are only enough for two, so be sure to up it for more eaters or bigger appetites. Gave it 4 forks!

YUM! I substituted squid rings (chopped in thirds) for the scallops since that's all I had on hand. I added them at the very end after cooking the salmon. Everything else I followed as was written and ohmigod was it delicious!

Eating this RIGHT NOW!!! It is soooo yummy and cooks up SOOOO quickly!! I took the advice of another reviewer and doubled the onion. Also doubled the sweet potato. Added a little more cream to offset. Layers of flavor, variety of textures... C'est Magnifique!!!

OMG! This dish has it all--sweet, savory, a bit of picante and looks great on the plate. I roasted the sweet potatoes and prepped everything else an hour or so before my guest arrived. Re-warming the potatoes at a low temp while doing the actual cooking took less than 15 minutes. Absolutely foolproof! It's a truly great recipe. If I could give it 5 forks, I would.

This recipe was actually rather easy and quick to prepare. It's not every day that you get a recipe you don't have to prep every thing at once. Taste-wise it was delicious! I wish the main liquid ingredient was not heavy cream, but then again, isn't that what makes everything taste so good :) I personally next time would double (maybe even triple) the amount of onions, their sweetness really adds to this dish and having one in each bite would have been perfection. I also would caramelize the onions in butter and not oil. Gosh, what does another few 100 grams of fat matter at this point. I was really looking forward to the scallops as part of this meal, but was really surprised when the salmon stole the show on taste. Next time I would probably leave the scallops out. Don't get me wrong, they were good but the salmon was unbelievable. I will make this again, and in the near future. It's a keeper!
