This recipe was great. I found that I needed to add more stock & wine to get the rice to the right consistency. I used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock, and I added celery for extra flavor. Finally, I think that a bit of heavy cream near the end of the process would have sent this dish over the edge.

I've made this lots of times and absolutely love- as do my vegetarian friends. The most recent time, though, I added the juice of one lemon and a tblspn of coleman's mustard, and it gave it a great springy kick to it!

Yum! It would make a big difference to use fresh shelled peas, as I did, as opposed to frozen. With the asparagus, it makes for a really fresh dish.

Rather bland, even after adding more wine, cheese and salt than was called for, plus some mushrooms and pepper. Also, the asparagus comes out overcooked -- I'd recommend adding it much closer towards the end.

I added more liquid than was called for (both broth and white wine) and cooked about 15 minutes longer. It was absolutely delicious -- it got rave reviews. It could be a side or can be an entree, but I would add more "extras" in the future, such as mushrooms and maybe shrimp. Overall, a beautiful risotto.

Yummy and easy. Took a little longer than the recipe said, but well worth it. I'm looking forward to leftovers!

I pretty much followed the recipe except I added some celery to the onions, leeks and garlic. I sauted them at a very low heat for 15 minutes (see Jamie Oliver's Basic risotto recipe, the best I've found so far) and then followed the remainder of the recipe. I would most definitely make again.

I have made this twice, and truly love it. Used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock - it also reheats well and could be made in advance and reheated.

The only change I made was with the green garlic. Didn't have it so I used regular garlic. It was really creamy. I could easily see adding shrimp to this recipe. I served this with broccolini and strip steaks done on the grill. Everything was a hit.

This was delicious. I couldn't find any veggie broth but the chicken broth worked fine. I used perhaps double the asparagus because I had an entire bunch. I also subbed fresh basil for parsley as a personal preference.

This is sooo good. Please go home and make it right now. Its comforting and hearty without being too heavy. At the last minute I realized I was out of Parmesan cheese (I know, what a sin) so I made it without and I also left out the butter. I'm sure the Parmesan would be a good addition, but it was fine without it, and probably cut down on the calories.

This was an excellent dish. It took a bit longer to cook than was stated in the recipe. However, the risotto came out velvety and the vegetables were perfectly cooked. My husband even went back for seconds which he never does, and my 14 year old daughter loved it, saying it was "good comfort food."

This deserves 3.5 forks. Tastey and easy. I added mushrooms and broccoli since I ate it as a main course but it would have been fine without those additions.

This risotto is velvety good! I fixed it for dinner this evening. It makes A LOT! Great vegetarian side dish (or main course). Served it with grilled chicken for a simple but elegant, and nutritious meal. :)

This recipe was great! It was my first risotto and it turned out to be a lot of stirring but pretty good! I added mushrooms and a little basil. Everyone was licking their plates.

Delicious recipe, authentic technique. Guests & family enjoyed it. Leftovers stuffed in cored out tomatoes and baked till warm. Terrific side dish or light lunch.

This recipe is wonderful. It's flavorful and simple. I made it with vegetable broth to suit my vegetarian guests. It turned out great and received excellent reviews. I'll definitely make this again and will share the recipe with friends!

Delicious! I used chicken broth and sprinkled a little extra parsley and some lemon zest to brighten the flavors just before serving. A big hit!

Hurrah! I can make risotto! This recipe was easy, fun to make and great aromatics filled up the home. I sustituted shallots for the leek and added sauteed shitake mushrooms (1/2 with the asparagus and 1/2 sprinkled on the finished dish). The flavors really came together once the parm. cheese was added. Sprinkled garden chpped chive on the top as well (gotta love summertime). This took me 1 hour from start to finish along including prep of a tomato/basil salad to accompany it.

First time making risotto, easier than I thought. Will definately make again!

Very tasty. Would definitely make again. Used Chicken broth though. Did not have any vegetable broth, but would probably have used chicken broth anyway. Otherwise, according to recipe.

This was a fabulous dish, and it even pleased my partner who is a very picky, meat and potatoes eater! It was easy to make and the first time I had ever made risotto. Delicious the next day and I will try making little risotto cakes out of the left-overs (just little pancakes with a little egg and pan fry). Will definitely make again.

i love this recipe because i always have leftovers which i turn into rice croquettes. i take scant 1/3 cup risotto and make balls out of it, stuff a ball of cheese in the center, roll them in panko breadcrumbs and fry. Man-that recipe gets four forks!

This was delicious and much easier than other risottos I've made. Even tasted good cold the next day.

It was more effort than it was worth, a little bland.

This recipe is good but this site also has a recipe for Risotto Primavera (without the ALLA) which calls for more veggies and basil, and was DELICIOUS. If you like this recipe, you'll like the other one better!

Delicious! I had some basil and baby spinach leaves on hand which I cut chiffonade-style and added the last 5 minutes. This was quite good.

I used regular garlic, frozen peas and no butter- it was great! I paired it with grilled salmon, which I highly recommend.

Lovely! I didn't think the extra butter at the end was necessary. Because we like our asparagus on the crispier side, I added the asparagus stalks about 30 mins into cooking, and also set aside the asparagus tips and added them later with the frozen peas; I also increased the amount of peas by about 1/2 cup. The green garlic has a very light flavor, better than regular garlic in this dish.

Excellent dish much complimented by my guests. Incidentally, I used olive oil instead of butter to sauté the onion, etc.
