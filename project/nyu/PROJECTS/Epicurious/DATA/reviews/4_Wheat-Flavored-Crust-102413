This is incredibly delicious. I've tried it with as much as 1/2 c. wheat and it's great. But the more wheat added the less pliable and stable the dough - it's better in pans (pie, tart) than free-form (crostata), for that reason.

Interesting idea. Part of me likes the zippy bite of wheat in this but, on the whole, I'm not a fan. I guess I'm a purist. Now, if I could only find that extraordinary (non-wheat) flaky crust that I found on here, forgot to bookmark, and subsequently lost. Ah, c'est dommage!

No lard ?

What a great recipe. The wheat crust did come out quite flaky and gave a wonderful rich taste to the pie. The filling was also quite tasty. The maple really lends a nice flavor and is not overly sweet like some pecan pies can be. My grandpa, parents and aunt all said this was one of the best pecan pies they have had - and pecan pie is holiday tradition.

This was quite flaky, and I made it in a food processor with a pastry blade. I was impressed by the recipe, since most whole wheat recipes require whole wheat pastry flour... this is a good compromise.

wonderful, perfect with the pecan pie. You must make it a day ahead and chill overnight. the next day while making the filling, I rolled out the crust and put it in the pie shells, then put the pie shells in the freezer so to keep the butter from melting. The pie was perfect.

Horrible crust! Too bad you can't rate this recipe in negative digits! An unfortunate waste of time and money... No such thing as "flaky crust" with this one.
