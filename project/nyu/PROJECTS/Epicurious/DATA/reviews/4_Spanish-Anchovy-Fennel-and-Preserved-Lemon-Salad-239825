Fantastically bright and fresh tasting. Unusually for me, I didn't change anything, or I thought I didn't; I made this from memory, and mistakenly remembered there being Queso Fresco being crumbled over it, so in it's place crumbled feta as the Mexican cheese is impossible to find here. Must have been from another recipe, but it certainly didn't make the salad bad! I could see it being a little 'cleaner' on the palate without the cheese though. This one's a keeper.

Fantastic. Ultra simple. Took it to a pot luck yesterday, first thing gone. I am going to make it again tonight. Because boquerones are hard to find, I used 2 cans of smoked trout and a can of regular trout from trader joes. Worked great. Took the olive oil down by 1 tablespoon (i don't like my salad too greasy) and I added an extra 1/2 a tablespoon of preserved lemon. (which I highly recommend making. They are easy and delicious in so many things.) Delicious.

Whoa Nelly--this is such a vibrant combination of flavors! I used the boquerones--ordered on-line--and the results were fantastic. On a hot day, when you want something tangy and bright, this is a great choice. The preserved lemon is key--it's like eating sunshine. I've also used this recipe as a base, substituting grilled chicken for the boquerones, doubling the red onion, but soaking it in cold water for 30 minutes before adding it to the rest of the ingredients. I'll never make a garden salad again.

Really simple and quite delicious. I used smoked fish as I didn't have the spanish anchovies. Love a salad with just five ingredients (not counting the dressing).

I loved the bright, puckery flavors of this salad. Regular anchovies would be all wrong flavor-wise, I see why the previous reviewer thought the salad was only good. Must use boquerones!

The salad was good, however, I used the homemade preserved lemon suggestion, and found them to be quite salty, therefore use about a third of the lemon. I used regular anchovies as I could not find the spanish kind
