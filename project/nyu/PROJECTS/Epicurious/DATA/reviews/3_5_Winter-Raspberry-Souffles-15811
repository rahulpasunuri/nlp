I made these tonight as a test for Easter. They rose initially and looked good, but then fell into a bubbeling mess. They would not be acceptible for compsny, Any suggestions? Otherwise, this is my 1st and last souffle.

This was delicious and pretty straightforward to prepare. It is an elegant dessert that impresses. I, too, refrigerated the souffles for several hours and they rose at least an inch. Also, my raspberries weren't in syrup, so I just added 1/4 cup of sugar when heating them on the stove (I made 1/2 the recipe). It worked just fine.

Definately. I love to cook, and I put together a dinner that my family and I as well as a neighbor would really enjoy. The perfect recipe with a wonderful taste. It certainly fits the name.

Remember to put it in the oven as soon as it's ready to go and don't wait to eat it or it will most certainly fall (like mine did) But it was by far the most decadent dessert I have had the pleasure of making that did not involve chocolate. I also added fresh berries and whipped cream to really bring out the true regal nature of this dessert.

I had fresh frozen raspberries with no syrup. (I picked them and froze them.) I added 3/4 cup sugar (from another recipe for frozen) and drained as much liquid as I could from the berries. Still too much liquid so used a tablespoon of cornstarch when heating the puree. Souffles were still delicious but after 22 min were a bit too moist and heavy. Would take many tries to adapt the recipe to fresh home frozen, I think.

The souffles still rise if refrigerated for up to two hours between spooning into ramekins and baking. Overall well-liked.

So easy to make! Prepare the raspberries the night before. It will save so much time. What a taste treat. This was my first souffle and they came out great. One didn't puff though; I think that is because I don't have the best of pans to set my ramekins on. It didn't matter to my guests... they were to busy raving about the flavor and texture of the souffles.

this souffle recipe was really simple to make and the balsamic vinegar brings out the flavor of the rasberries and gives a really neat taste would reccommend this to anyone who would like to prepare a gourmet dessert for family or friends it is quite an impressive dish when served immediantly
