I noticed that no one has mentioned using the Chimichurri Sauce. Try it and don't worry about the balsamic reduction. They are also very good with a tart and sweet pickled red and yellow relish or just a squeeze of lemon. A similar preparation is used to make tacos here in Texas with some lime and pico de gallo in a warmed tortilla. They are sold at taco trucks around Houston and are great.

Fast and easy way to make sweetbreads. I marinated them in a balsamic glaze after parboiling (just reduce 3/4 cup of balsamic vinegar to 3-4 tablespoons) and put them on skewers with figs. For some reason, the sweetness and tartness of the balsamic glaze disappeared after grilling so next time I'll put the balsamic glaze on after grilling. Great party finger food that is quite satiating.

I will never make sweetbreads any other way. Season and top with Balsamic Glaze...perfection on a plate along with a nice red wine.

This is a nice alternative to the heavier sauced versions in French Cuisine but there has to be better. I have tried grilling non parboiled sweetbreads in the past to what I recall were good results.

I added some grated Asiago cheese and a tad bit of fresh basil. Very nice. I hope you will enjoy these additions also. I've also used a counter top oven/broiler to prepare the sweetbreads.

So I sez to her, I sez "you're lucky to have anyone cook for you at all". Then she sez something to me about geting a job....nonsense. This recipe is excellent. Everyone either fries or serves in a cream sause. This is truly a delicacy. Thumbs up!

Delicious! BTW - What kind of review do you expect from someone who writes sez instead of says?!

I love sweetbread and I had heard my friends from Argentina always raving about "mullejas a la parilla" and I had to try this. My brother gave me that awkward look when I passed them to him to put on the grill, but when all was said and done, they were a hit. As for our dear friend in NJ "who would be so desperate..." I find it interesting that the finest restaurants in SF will always have a sweetbread dish... I have spent $15 on two sweetbread ravioli's and they were worth it. Don't knock till you try it.

Wow, I tried this with the balsamic reduction everyone mentioned. Sublime; like crispy, but magically buttery soft ribeye steak tips. As for "who would be so desperate," my dear, how do you think lobster, bacon, and barbecue ribs came about? Epicurean delight is born in culinary necessity.

Tried it last week... it was very good. I was looking for a "summer way" of preparing sweetbreads, instead of the usual wild mushroom ragout I serve them with which can be quite heavy for a balmy summer night .I would probably add some sort of balsamic glaze next time I make them, just to add a bit of color and to kick it up a notch, as I didn't make a any sauce for them.I served them with a fresh corn succotash... yummy!

Always like a bit of grilled sweetbreads or any ofal in general. People should eat more parts of the animal in general - so much is wasted and for naught... . Further, to those who might be curious what desperation would drive one to eat thymus, I would answer, "Taste." I would reccomend some type of wine or balsamic reduction with these ... so good.

Excellent. This was a nice departure from the usual cream sauce, fried etc. heaviness that can torture sweetbread preparations. I loved its flavor. I pressed them out of habit without realizing that the recipe didn't call for it.

And furthermore, how desperate do you have to be to be eating thymus glands?

My husband made this for me, so I sez to him, I sez, "if you ever make this swill for me again, I'll take away your apron and make you get a job!"

This was my first attempt at grilling sweetbreads, and I thought it was delicious. My husband prefers a firmer texture, so next time I'll try pressing them first.
