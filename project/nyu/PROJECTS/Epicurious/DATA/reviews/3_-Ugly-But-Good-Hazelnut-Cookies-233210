Flavorless, uninspired, waste of time. Followed the recipe exactly. Was looking for a gluten-free recipe and this was terrible.

These were very good cookies. I drizzled the cooled cookies with melted 60% cacao chocolate. Next time I'll try making them with 1/3 less sugar.

These cookies are AMAZING and a perfect treat for a gluten intolerant diet. They turned out perfectly.

These cookies are AMAZING. They turned out perfectly. An excellent recipe for those on a gluten-free diet! I will be making this one again and again.

These were delicious and "ugly" despite my mishaps. I never got the egg whites to stiff peaks. They were shiny and silky, not firm. Otherwise, I followed it to the letter, and they are crispy, nutty good. Check the bottoms after 15 min. since mine were a little too brown after 20 min.
