Great way to use up vegies. I used butternut squash, omitted okra, basil, cornmeal and yellow tomatoes. Instead I used baby romas from the garden, portobello mushrooms, asparagus, 4 times the corn, and whole wheat flour. I seasoned with salt and pepper and some smokey seasoning I bought at Trader Joe's. Excellent!

This was great inspiration! I did do some tweaking, and it still turned out well. For the crust, I subbed about 1/4 c corn flour for 1/4 c flour, in additional to the 1/2 cornmeal. I also mixed up the filling a bit: added asparagus and extra corn, used red tomatoes, and omitted the eggs. I also tossed in some corn flour with the cornmeal. I was very worried about the bottom crust getting soggy, so I poured it all into a strainer briefly, before filling the crust. It was crispy on the bottom, but it held up pretty well. I will definitely keep this in my back pocket for CSA overloads. It seems like there's an infinite number of possibilities, and it was a hit at the potluck for which it was made.

I made this with a slightly different mix of veggies and without the boiled egg, but still - yum! The crust was nice and crunchy and I really appreciated the addition of the cornmeal. I think I might have liked a little more salt in the veggie mix for next time. Here's a link to a photo I took of this pie: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4312835298_3706f38b48.jpg

This is my third time making this pie - always turns out delicious. a few tips - I cut the squash a day in advance and leave it in a container with salt, that way by the time I am ready to use it - most of the water has gone out, this will help avoid soggy crust, also I would suggest making the conrnmeal crust, it is delicious!

This recipe is great!! The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderful. My husband and I just altered it for the winter season and can't wait to bring it to Thanksgiving. We used butternut squash, parsnips, leeks, and garlic, cooked in a mixture of butter and oil. We kept the corn, muenster cheese (although are dying to try it with smoked gouda!), basil, cornmeal and put in 6 eggs. Probably the best savory winter pie I've ever had!

Crust was awesome! No problems at all with anything being too wet, in fact it was perfect in that regard, too. Followed recipe as is, and was struck by the monochrome effect -- next time would completely switch the vegetables around. Did not mind the okra at all (used frozen), but the summer squash -- overwhelming. Would be better with a winter squash and a different mix of veggies. Also -- holy salt! Careful;)

O.K. but doesn't have wow factor. Family said they liked it but no need to make it again and I agree. Substituted beans for okra. Let squash drain for 45 minutes and let the seeded tomatoes drain for 5-10 minutes. This helped keep the pie from becoming too wet.

I made this as the main dish for a small dinner party where two of my guests were vegetarians. The only change that I made was to throw in approx 2 T of tapioca to help keep it from being runny. It was wonderful! Served with an appetizer of stuffed mushrooms, a pear and endive salad and a rich rice pudding for dessert. Very satisfying.

This was VERY good. Definitely going to make it again. I substituted green beans for okra, added a bit of chopped bell pepper and doubled the garlic. It was wonderful. Good leftovers too. My husband was fighting me for the last piece. My only problem was being left with a lot of water in the bottom of the pie dish when cut the first day and the bottom crust was soggy. I drained the squash as directed and also drained the other vegetables before mixing together. Will try draining them longer next time. I can't decide if adding some flour to thicken the juices into a sauce would be good or would ruin the whole thing . . . .

This was delicious. I couldn't find okra so I used green beans instead. Otherwise, followed recipe to the letter. Made it for a dinner party and my husband gobbled up the leftovers before I could get another bite.

This was delicious! We all kept nibbling at it long after we were full. Very forgiving with ingredients - I used more corn, less tomatoes, yellow and green zucchini because that's what I had. Oh, and half meunster with half white cheddar. The prep was way longer than a summer side deserves. Honestly, who wants the oven at 400 for an hour in the summer? My suggestion: skip the crust and hard boiled egg and add the cheese and cornmeal at the end. The heat of the sauted veggies will melt it. Let it sit a while to allow the cornmeal to soak up the juices and soften... or skip the cornmeal. The crust does make for a beautiful presentation so I'll keep that when making for guests. The hard boiled egg makes it a nice main course. All good variations.

this was great, so fresh tasting. yes a bit of work but worth it...made filling omitting corn, cheese, basil & cornmeal previous night then added those next evening when making supper. Also made crust ahead & kept in fridge; put filling in casserole dish & topped with crust. Also used green beans instead of okra since that's what I had. The crust was very tasty but mine wasn't very flaky b/c I added too much milk...you don't need anywhere near as much as the recipe indicates. Used Havarti cheese, and it was nice enough but did not find the pie particularly cheesy as I had been expecting. Would definitely make this pie again, including crust.

I'm going to have to agree with everyone this pie is wonderful. We had guests over and made this and everyone had seconds. It is very forgiving, I made the crust 2 days ahead to save time and it was still wonderful. I also added jarlsberg cheese b/c I could'n't find Muenster (and didn't feel like havarti) and it was wonderful. I added okra, lots of corn and tomatoes. This one is a keeper!

i have to agree this was really delicious. i did not use the okra, used a bit of broccoli instead. only cooked the yellow squash for a minute or so.

Great recipe! I used squash, tomatoes, green beans and basil from my garden. Skipped the okra, not a favorite and forgot the T.of cornmeal in the vegies, still turned out wonderful. Can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I made it with the okra and I wasn't a fan, but I don't like okra, so I should have predicted this. Everything else about the pie was great. The crust was easier to work with than usual biscuit style crusts, and I love the idea of using hard boiled eggs to lend some substance instead of putting raw eggs in there like a quiche. It was very aromatic with the basil and scallions. If you don't like okra, just make this without it, or with another vegetable. Green beans?

Time consuming, but very flavorful. I used zucchini instead of yellow squash.

Very tasty, I'll definitely make it again. I thought there was too much squash though, and the 1" pieces were too big. Next time I'll reduce the amount of squash, cut it smaller and maybe add some beans, peas or carrots.

I did this recipe with all the ingredients OKRA AND ALL okra is fabulous, your loss if you leave it out. This pie is fantastic with big chunks of delicious heirloom tomatoes. Great great crust. Will be making again.

This was awesome -- definitely a recipe I will make again. The only changes I made were red tomatoes instead of yellow, green beans instead of okra, and a square glass casserole dish rather than a round pie dish. I went with the havarti cheese. I served it with mashed potatoes (with goat cheese and basil - also from this site), and the combination was a hit with my little dinner party of four.

This was great. I too, left out the okra, but added extra corn and some peas. I was afraid it might be a little bland, but the flavoring was wonderful. I used the muenster, but after trying it, I think I could have used any mild cheese such as mozzerella or Jack. I placed the filling into individual casserole dishes with the cornmeal crust on top only. Very delicious and I will make again.

When I saw this recipe in this month's Gourmet, I knew I'd have to make it right away - and I'm glad I did. The corn meal crust really puts a summery twist on a traditional pot pie, and the filling was exceptional. We don't like okra, so I substituted green beans and sweet peppers. Added extra corn and omitted the eggs. This would be a wonderful way to use up any leftover veggies from the market!

I halved the recipe because I didn't have enough tomatoes, and I also cut back on the cheese and butter, yet this was still very good. I think the crust is a great crust recipe. I used half whole wheat and half white flour instead of all white flour. This recipe conveniently used everything that was in my garden yesterday.
