I am just commenting on the dressing. I was looking for a dressing for a veggie-rice salad I was making with what I had in my fridge and the dressing I made is so delicious that it's more like a dip. I used this recipe as a base: I used a clove of garlic, one avocado, dijon mustard, olive oil, a bit of white balsamic vinegar, a bunch of fresh dill (1/4 cup?), salt, sugar, pepper, 1/2 & 1/2, and lemon juice. I blended it and it is thick, creamy and delicious. It would be great as a spread, a dip or just with a spoon. I will thin it out to put on my rice salad.

I was looking for an avocado dressing to use on my taco salad and this is the one I tried. Like others, I amended the recipe a bit to my liking... I added a clove of garlic and used cilantro instead of parsley. I also added some lime at the end - which gave it a nice, fresh flavor. Delish. Will be making this again!

This salad dressing is amazing! I did use buttermilk instead of cream and cilantro instead of parsley. Also added a couple of cloves of garlic. One of the most delicious salad dressings I have ever tasted. Put it over bibb and romaine lettuce with mushrooms, radishes, tomatoes and grilled chicken. Wonderful, though I think bacon would be a better accompaniment than chicken. Next time...

I doubled the cream for more smoothness and left out the parsley. Loved the dressing this way.

I made the dressing as written & I am excited & amazed at how delicious it is! Mixed it into a can of tuna for an alternative to mayo. Fantastic. This dressing recipe will go into my permanent file for all things yummy that must be made again & again & again & again ... can't wait to try it over hearts of palm & butter lettuce.

WOW. Why anybody would NOT LIKE this dressing is beyond me? I added garlic (but of course) and instead of cream used low fat no sugar yogurt. The mustard in the recipe tantalizes the taste buds. It's really a lovely dressing and we will make it again and again and again, until avocado season ends! Thank you.

We enjoyed this dressing very much and will definitely be making it again and again. Nothing could be simpler or faster. I will try it with cilantro next time as suggested by other reviewers, but the parsley version was delicious.

The dressing was awful! Not worth the time or effort.

Definitely cilantro instead of parsley!!!

I thought this was OK, but I won't make again. The dressing was too lemony, and for the variety of ingredients, everything kind of tasted the same.

Quite good. I added a small clove of garlic for a bit of bite and increased the amount of avocado. It was well received at our giant family bbq. Found it dead simple -- took about 20 seconds in the food processor.

This was a good dressing. However, I thought it was a little too lemony and I don't think parsley adds much at all. When I make this again I will reduce the lemon and substitute cilantro for parsley.

we just made the dressing - not the rest - but a very nice avocado dressing nonetheless

A big disappointment! A lot of preparation effort for a dressing that tasted like mayonnaise. I would not make this again.

Mmmmmm. Light & flavorful salad, which is very good!
