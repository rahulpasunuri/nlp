We agree these are pretty darn good exactly as written. They were quick to put together and no trouble at all shaping into balls and we liked that they were baked, not fried. They were very tasty but I wasn't totally happy with the texture that the lentils gave them ~ a bit pasty. I think next time I'll make them with bulgar instead.

These are perfect as written. My husband is always begging for spaghetti & meatballs and I love these because then I don't feel guilty. I serve them with a puttanesca sauce from Grace Parisi. I used a medium sized ice cream scoop to form the balls and then pressed them firmly together in between my palms. They compacted and sort of squished and mushed together so I didn't have any issue with them falling apart or being dry. I'm still trying to figure out why these taste soooo good. I made the whole batch and then froze half and popped them in a ziplock so I could use just as many as I wanted. I think these could be used in a flatbread sandwich with Greek flavors and be delicious too!! Others have suggested black beans but that would be nice to easily form the balls but not nearly as delicious as the lentils - and I love black beans.

I can't review something I haven't made but I noticed one or two "I changed this somewhat" comments that look like it was turned into a totally different dish! Having said that, I may try black beans or garbanzos instead of lentils since several people felt the lentils were dry. I'll try this tomorrow and if I like the result will post further!

I like this recipe especially with mushroom pasta sauce. I pureed some of the mixture and then formed the balls. I did serve it at a Super Bowl party with tomato sauce and the crowd enjoyed them (and they are meat eaters).

I made these the other night and really enjoyed them. I put them in spaghetti and meatballs and they were really very tasty and had good texture. I did have to put more breadcrumbs in because they were a little to moist even after chilling them for a few hours

This recipe was a big hit at our Super Bowl party; even people who were REALLY skeptical beforehand asked for the recipe. I added an extra egg since other reviewers found them dry, but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. I served them in tomato sauce and also made meatball sandwiches - both were great. To split the work I did the lentil/veggie mixture a day in advance, which saved me some time on Sunday. They're time-consuming but worth it.

This recipe is a lot of work and tastes rather bland. I made it as written, tried it before shoving in the oven, added extra chili and cumin - and still was kind of blah in the end. Will definitely never ever make again.

I made these tonight and found the process very lengthy, so be prepared with some time on your hands. I found that lentils made these a tad dry, and if I make them another time I would use black beans as suggested by another reviewer. I also found forming them into balls is a bit difficult, perhaps because many of the components are chunky. Next time I would be tempted to put the ingredients in a food processor to blend it all together.

Even with additional spices and the recommended pesto (very good), the lentils made this too dry and flavourless. I will give it one more try with some modifications.

These have an excellent flavor. I attempted to make them vegan by leaving out cheese and using flax meal plus water for eggs, but they didn't hold together well. I imagine they'd be fantastic as written.

The first time I used French lentils because I had them left over. They were good but a tad dry, even though I served them with tomato sauce. Next I tried chickpeas and liked the taste much better - served with hummus (tahini would be excellent, too) or a yogurt dip. You just have to mash the chickpeas fairly well so that the balls hold together (the size of the chickpeas makes them unruly).

I made these yesterday. I had all the ingredients on hand. It was a bit of a lengthy process, but I don't mind making meatballs so I was prepared for the extra prep time of making the balls. They are great! I almost left out the walnuts, but that would have been a mistake. They have a surprising meaty texture and a delicious flavor. My carnivor husband liked them as well, what a surprise since he's not impressed by soy meatballs. I think my two little grandsons will love these! Thanks for a keeper!!!

not yet a review but an inquiry: how well would quinua fit into this somehow in addition not so much to dominate but just add a bit more nutrition? and how much? I also think that maybe the addition of a bit of chile would be a kicker :) thoughts before I try it?? jaime98903@yahoo.com

sounds delicious.. I've made a variation of these in the pastby substituting whole wheat bread crumbs for the lentils and added basil pesto and additional locatelli romano grated cheese.

Loved these! I did make some substitutions- black beans for the lentils, green peas for the mushrooms, Sriracha for the tomato paste, and rolled oats for the bread crumbs. I've made them twice in the last week. Easy to put together. Yum!

The basic recipe is good, but came out a bit bland. I am going to try to add some Indian spices to jazz it up next time.
