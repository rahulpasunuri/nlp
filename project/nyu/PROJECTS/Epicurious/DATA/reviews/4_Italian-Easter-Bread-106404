This is the third time I've made this bread, more like cake for Easter and I think the best. Used cake flour which I hadn't before and Italian mixed citrus peel from KAF, also threw in some candied orange peel from the recipe in BA April 12 for marmalade cake, it is fantastic and I will never discard an orange peel again. Will be great in yogurt, muffins or anything else. I made in 9 inch cake pans and make sure to remove within 5 or 10 minutes left one in too long and very difficult to remove. Will be on my Easter menu by demand, the second cake has to go to work on Monday.

I am only part way through step three. Hope to have this for our Easter lunch in two days. I am concerned that the dough is not behaving correctly. I typically don't use cool water with the yeast. It has always been warm. Was any one else concerned at this point? I made my own candied orange peels, not hard. Here is hoping. I will write again after the bread is eaten and let you know what the group thought.

This made a delicious and beautiful pannettone-like bread/cake, but I have a couple of issues with the recipe. First, it should start off with a warning to start it exactly 6 hours before you hope to turn in for the night. Second, the dough is way too dry in step 3 (or maybe it was 2?). I added a bit of extra milk and didn't feel the need to counterbalance it with extra flour later on. I used duck eggs and 2/3 white whole wheat flour (fresh ground), but it did not taste "healthy" at all.

There is a crazy amount of butter, but it is an excellent cake!

I loved it! I didn't have access to candied orange peel, so I left it out. I used a ten inch springform pan instead of the nine-inch that the recipe called for. I would use raisins next time, though.

My family liked this bread a lot. Because I didn't read the recipe all the way through before I started(!) I messed up the 8-10 hour and final 3 1/4 rising time. I ended up rising it about 15 hours, then about 8 hours. It turned out beautifully, didn't hurt it a bit. The crumb is lovely, and the flavour complex. I used dried cranberries, instead of raisins or candied peel. I took the advice of previous reviews,and used orange ,almond and vanilla extracts, and would use even a bit more next time. Because of how many steps are involved, I'm not sure I will make it all the time, but will for a special occasion.

This bread is delicious. The first few doughs were stiff and scary looking. I made two braided loaves and only needed about 1/2 the glaze. Used golden raisins soaked in grand marnier I started in the morning and around midnight after the last rise, I formed the loaves and put them in the refrigerator. Took them out, let them rise for 3 hours and had them for breakfast.

Oh boy...I consider myself a very good baker of breads, cakes & cookies, but this recipe just did not work out for me. Followed every step - using fresh yeast, but I ended up with a very heavy, not- quite-done in the middle "bowling ball." Found beautiful paper molds in Carlow's Cookery in Doylestown. Used candied orange peel from The Larder (Altomonte's was out of the $15 imported orange peel, but now I'm actually glad I didn't have it - it would have been a waste). I've had authentic Easter bread in Italy and there was just no comparison. Back to the oven....

This is called Colomba Pasquale/Colomba di Pasqua in Italian. We are an Italian family, and we think this tastes absoluty authentic! It is SO good. Although, I did substitute, I used golden raisins and zest from 1 small tangerine in place of candied orange peel. But the dough is so amazing! I found my dove molds at Golda's Kitchen online. Our family in Italy has not even seen the molds for the doves they always go buy the finished product at the markets during the holidays (Easter or Christman- the panettone).

One of the very best breads I have ever made! Unbelievably soft and silky crumb, beautiful balance of sweetness from the top and buttery goodness from the bread itself. I wish I had read the reviews before making it, as I would have experimented with the extracts (orange flower water might be good, too). Like others, I used macerated raisins instead of orange peel. Baked in a well-buttered tube pan (I halved the recipe, and it made an angel food cake-sized loaf). I also added coconut to the glaze ingredients and used plenty of powdered sugar, creating a real crust on top. Baked for 35 minutes. Suitable for relatively novice bakers, IMO -- just follow the directions and be patient with the many steps. I am already planning my next loaf!

Great recipe, yes very time consuming I start the evening before up to step 4 and do the rest the next day. I found my paper dove molds at goldaskitchen.com.

Yummy . . . it brought me back to when I was a little girl and my family celebrated Easter with my Italian great-grandmother. Like one of the other reviewers, I also added the lemon and almond extract in addition to the vanilla extract and included golden raisins.

This is an exquisite delight! The bread is fabulously excellent the first day and even better the next. My graddaughter says it is "almondy goodness"! My Italian beloved says it is the best he has ever eaten. I used the zest of one navel orange and 1 1/2 cups of golden raisin macerated in Grand Marnier in place of the candied orange peel and added 1 teaspoon each of pure lemon and almond extract in addition to the 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. I did not have a spring form pan so I used a 9 inch cake pan prepared with butter and lined with parchment paper and baked it a bit longer keeping the temperature at 375 degrees for one half hour and then lowering the temperature to 350 degrees till it was golden brown. I believe it will become an Easter tradition by popular demand for years to come. Do try it. It is so simple and the rewards are great!

This recipe is wonderful. A "labor" of love, but really, very simple to make. A new tradition for my family going forward. I sub'd choc chips for the orange peel and added almond and orange extract as did some other reviewers, though I am sure the original recipe is still delicious. What you get is a buttery, not too sweet, flavor that is unlike many homemade or commercial desserts. The house smelled wonderful when baking. Can't wait for next Easter to make it again. Thanks Gary Rulli for bringing it to us!

this is my first recipe review, just made this for easter and this is amazing! i followed the advice of some others and left out the second stick of butter in step 4, added homemade candied orange zest, orange extract, and almond extract in step 4 and divided the dough into 3 small loaf pans in step 5 because i needed to make 3 loaves. baked for 35 min. and it worked out great. takes the full 2 days, but it's easy and sooooo good! happy easter!

Excellent! A big hit at our big Easter dinner. I'm not an experienced baker, but the recipe was easy to follow and straight forward. Simple, but definitely time consuming- I worked on it on and off all day Saturday, woke up super early Sunday morning for step 5, and three hours later for step 6. I didn't have the dove molds or 9" springform pans, so I instead used two tube pans. I split the dough in half, made a roll of each, and circled each in the pan. It worked great. Also I didn't have the candied organge- but managed to make some by washing, drying in the oven and dicing up some marmalade. That still didn't make enough so I had to also add in other diced candied fruit. I think next time I'll try what another reviewer suggests which was to add almond and lemon extract to the dough in addition to the vanilla for extra punch. But as it is it's awesome, it got compliments all day long from everyone who tried it.

fabulous recipe! could not be easier to follow. I did stretch some of the raising time, due to daily family schedule, and it worked fine. Also, because I have 3 small children and none of them love 'canditi' (candied fruit peel)or raisin, I added about 1/2 cup mini-chocolate chips to the batter, and a tablespoon or two to the final glaze. Fantastic! Growing up in Italy in the '70s and '80s, I got used mostly to the commercial Colomba and maybe, once in a while, to the one the local bakery would make. This one tasted sooo much better! Great recipe!!!

This recipe looks like it would be difficult but it is simple and is the closest recipe to my grandmothers easter bread I have found. I usually use dried diced fruit instead of orange peel but it is great either way. The hardest thing about this recipe is the waiting until it's done and getting a second piece before it is gone.

I think that this bread has the best, softest, silk-like crumb I have ever tasted. THe crumb really is superb. I didn't have the candied orange peel so subbed raisins soaked in water and orange liqueur and was sorry I used the liqueur, I didn't care for the hint of liqueur taste in the finished product. Left out one stick of butter without a problem, and baked in 9 inch springform pans. Because of the glaze (which I found delicious) the bread stuck to the pans terrible, so next time I'll make parchment 'collars' for the pans for easy removal. Definately recommended for your special occasion, although time consuming!

This recipe is so great and so easy. The time it takes sounds a bit scary but it's all wait time, the ingredients are working, not you. This was the first year I made this...will definitely become a tradition!!!

If I could give this recipe 5 forks I would! Fantastic! This is the second year I made this bread and I followed the recipe to the letter both times. Don't be intimidated by the number of steps it takes, it really is not hard, just time consuming. The directions are so easy to follow. I had 22 people at my house on Easter and everyone loved this bread. I made it in two 9-inch springform pans and they gobbled up both loaves. I will make this every year. So delicious.

Wow! This was fantastic, and very easy to make. It will definitely become a tradition in our family! I added currants and only half the amount of peel, since we aren't big peel fans. Unfortunately, I won't get to see how well it keeps, as it was gone the day after our Easter dinner!

I loved this bread. Definitely will make it again!!!. Simply delicious!!!The steps were really easy to follow and watching the dough change through the whole process was a great experience. I was not able to find the orange candied peels so I replace them with lemon/orange and grapefruit zest. Fun fact: I had to wake up at 5 am to do step 5 and then went back to sleep for three and a half until de dough was ready for step 6: beaking it!

I gave this recipe 4 forks even though I didn't make it exactly as the recipe is written because I can imagine that it would be at least as good if not better the original way! Also, I wanted to indicate to other cooks that even if they don't follow the recipe exactly, it is still completely workable and delicious. That said,this bread is phenomenal! One big change that I made was to follow another reviewer's lead and leave out one stick of butter. It was not missed at all! It was still rich and buttery. I also substituted raisins macerated in triple sec for the orange peel and added lemon and almond extract in addition to the vanilla. I baked the breads in 2 8-in round cake pans and they came out great. The bread definitely requires time and patience, but it well worth the effort. Happy Baking!

I was trying to recreate the Easter Bread my Italian mom always made. This comes pretty close but not quite as good. I added one tsp of lemon and one tsp of almond extract in addition to the vanilla called for. I know mom used all 3. The other change was I could not bring myself to add the 2nd stick of butter! Why does this recipe need almost 3 sticks of butter ? Overall - excellent directions,very time consuming, not sure if it would have enough flavor if I did not add the extra extracts.

I made this recipe and while it was time consuming, it was extremely easy to follow. Everyone who tasted it loved it. Tasted just like my mom used to make. I have adapted it to different size pans without any difficulty. I also made it with lemon rind and anise extract instead of the vanilla and orange rind. Glazed it with egg wash. Wonderful both ways.

I've never rated an Epicurious recipe before, but this one is truly exceptional...time consuming, but great fun--and the directions are fantastic! It will definitely be an Easter tradition in our home. I made three separate batches and baked them in 9 inch round paper molds (couldn't find doves, even at Sur La Table, where I bought the round ones). Three of our Easter guests were visiting from Italy, and they absolutely RAVED about the bread. They said they'd never gone to the trouble to make colomba pasquale at home, and joked about having to fly all the way to America to find such an incredible recipe! The only changes I've noted are that the final rise (in the paper molds) took longer than indicated...closer to five hours or so...and the oven temp was a little high. Next time I will do 375 or 400 for the first 10 minutes to kick-start a nice oven spring and then turn the oven down 25 degrees or so for the remainder of the time...and watch it closely. Do try it! You'll LOVE it!

This sweet and delicate bread takes time but it's wonderful, not difficult at all, you just need some time and that's it!!! Your family and friends will really love it! I just used yellow raisins instead of the candied orange and it was absolutely fantastic, will surely make it again.

Fantastic. This is actually the equivalent of Colomba Pasquale, a traditional Italian Easter cake (too sweet to be considered bread with a meal). On a whim, I added this to my Easter menu for my boyfriend and his family, all of whom are from Bologna, Italy and very much into food. It was the absolute hit of the Easter meal. I felt like a star! According to my Bolognese group, it is truly authentic. Yes, this recipe takes time but don't be intimidated. It is more than worth it. The recipe is perfect, no changes. Keep it unrefrigerated but airtight, and it lasts for weeks I'm told. Mine are gone!

This recipe is Divine.I made this recipe three times last Easter-Twice for giving and once for keeping.It is light slightly sweet but not too.It is worth the work and I felt proud of myself for starting my own family tradition.he instructions on this recipe were very precise and easy to follow.

I tried this recipe for the first time and I really liked the taste of the bread. The texture reminded me of a fancy egg bread with a slight orange flavor. The glaze turned out fabulous. Be sure to not let the glaze get on the paper or it will tear the bread when unwrapping. I didn't have time to get the dove shaped molds so I used the springform pans. The downside to this shortcut was that the bread became scorched on the bottom and sides. Probally due to the heat. Next time, I will lower the temp in my oven to 325 and not put the bread on the bottom third of the oven.

EXCELLENT recipe.... my husband just moved here from Milan 2 years ago and he said it tasted really authentic. It is time consuming, but worth it!!
