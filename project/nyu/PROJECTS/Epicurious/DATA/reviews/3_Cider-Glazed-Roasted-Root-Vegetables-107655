Lovely caramelized roasted veg. Simple flavors but so good in fall and winter, especially with meat. I agree with a previous poster that the time indicated is too long. One question though: why does the cider need to be sparkling? Any bubbles will be long gone by the time you eat the vegetables.

This was very easy to make and presents beautifully. I would substitute the sparkling apple cider with frozen concentrate for more apple flavor.

Made it along side a lamb dish and got rave reviews from everyone...and it's easy to make and serve!

Have made this to serve with Christmas dinner two years in a row, and it goes over very well. For ease, I melt the butter and cider together, then toss the vegetables in the mixture before placing on baking sheet (easier than dotting w/butter). I also find that the given time in the oven leaves them mushy, so I tend to cut the time they cook both covered and uncovered by almost half.

This was a very nice and different dish. I sliced my veggies in my food processor and baked them for about 45 minutes. Very nice dish!
