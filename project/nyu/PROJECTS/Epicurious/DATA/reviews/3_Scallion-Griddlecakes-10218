Very tasty. I put some soy sauce with chopped ginger on top of the pancakes as a dressing and it brought out the flavor immeasureably.

Yum! These are basically moist, fluffy pancakes with tons of chopped scallions. They may not be like the traditional Chinese Scallion Pancakes, but they are still good.
