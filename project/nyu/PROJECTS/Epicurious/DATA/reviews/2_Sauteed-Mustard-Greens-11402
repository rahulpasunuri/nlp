This recipe is fine, for what it is. Not everything needs to be exciting with the everyday flavors: garlic, anchovy, crushed red pepper, etc. Sometimes all you want is sauteed greens with a touch of salt. This recipe is what it is, and on those grounds, it's a solid 3.

This recipe lacks creativity and flavor. Try adding a squeeze of lemon, a splash of white wine, some chopped garlic, shallots or onion and and a bit of salt and pepper!
