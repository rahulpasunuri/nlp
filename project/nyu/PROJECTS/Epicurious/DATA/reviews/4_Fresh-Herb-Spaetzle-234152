I made this last night after deciding on slow cooking a Bavarian pork roast. Went out and bought a spaetzle maker and WOW, was this both fun to make and delicious! I omitted the onion and used cinnamon because I didn't have nutmeg as I thought I did. Instead of using the chicken broth, I used some juices from the roast which was amazingly flavorful with several dried herbs, beef broth, cloves and red wine vinegar. We also served it with sauerkraut and red cabbage, and naturally, German beer and a Riesling. This was FANTASTIC and may be a new holiday tradition. I'm very tempted to throw the leftovers, roast and all, into some stock for a leftover soup as mentioned below. Fantastisch!

Oh, this is the best! First, I had the good luck of finding a spaetzle maker grate at the Goodwill and have been wanting to try it out(it was perfect).Instead of water, I cooked the spaetzle in the broth I made from my Thanksgiving turkey, then sauteed in the butter/oil mix (without onion/mushrooms). THEN I ate a bowl of the turkey broth with parsley and spaetzle IN IT. YUM! Like the best turkey noodle soup but better. I think this would be nature's perfect curative food if you had a cold or flu. I'm going to get another bowl ...

My boyfriend made this for me today and even though we didn't have the herbs fresh, it was DELICIOUS. I can't even imagine how it could get any better. I'll definitely (have him) make this again, haha.

I guess I need to go out and get myself a potato ricer, because while this was delicious I was covered in sticky dough and had the worst time getting proper spaetzle shapes into the pot (tried using a broad flat ladle with exact 1/4" holes). Even with this disaster it was so yummy, though, so will try again. I did forget to season with salt and pepper at the end, and while I thought it was fine without, my partner did want more salt - which of course was easy enough for him to add at the table!

I haven't tried the sauce, but used this recipe for basic spaetzle many times. Everybody loves them, including my son, who is an extremely picky eater. Super easy to make as a side dish. Great even the next day, when quickly browned with some butter and lightly salted.

This was so great! Used whole wheat flower instead of white as used a mushroom mixer - both these gave the dish added flavor. I was told by a good friend that in Germany they add cheese (to make it mac & cheese like) and will try this next time.

A good recipe. A couple of tips to make this easier: 1. If you don't have a spaetzle press, use a pastry sleeve or plastic bag. So much less messy. 2. To fill a pastry sleeve really easily, tie off the nozzle end with a sandwich bag tie and then put the bag into a tall narrow recipient such as a hand-blender jug. Fold the sleeve over the edge and fill. Once done, twist the bag a few times and seal the top with another tie.

Delicious, comforting, and quicker to make than I expected. I modified the recipe a little and it turned out fabulous. I finely ground some dried mushrooms and added it to my original batter, and only used a little bit of thyme. I also used a ricer with large holes. Though they formed nicely when boiled, next time I might try a colander method since the batter was a little tricky to work with using my ricer. Lastly I sauteed them in a cast iron skillet with butter and thyme until slightly browned. I served with Thomas Keller's easy chicken schnitzel recipe.

Easy and very good. Served with Beef Tenderloin.

Loved this! I used a ricer with a medium amount of holes (not the one with tons of whole I use for mashed potatoes) and it worked perfectly. I used parsley only and made them ahead. Then just before serving to guests sauteed them in butter/oil a bit but they didn't really brown as much as I hoped. I added some broth and it added flavor. Since I was serving with short ribs with a rich gravy I skipped the mushrooms and onions but will try that next time if serving with a simpler meat. Delish!

Love this recipe! I made it with schnitzel and it was delicious.

Great recipe. I only made the noddles as a side dish for a German pork roast with dried fruit that has a lot of white wine gravy and it was perfect. So far I have made 4 batches: once with chives and parsley but when I added fresh sage it was tastier, adding thyme was also good. I used a lot of herbs and needed to thin the dough to make it easier to push thru the spaetzle maker. I even made them using 2% milk with a small splash of half and half and could not tell the difference. The same when I used only 2 eggs. The salt is important, don't skimp on this. I found that you can be flexible with this dough and still get good results. Will keep making it.

This was ridiculously easy, yet delicious. The family made the Spaetzle together and had so much fun. The cheese grater was easier than the Colander. We only used Thyme but will try the other herbs next time. We paired this meal with a Thyme/Rosemary crusted pork chops and Reisling. Could have stood up to a Pinot Noir or maybe Gamay

This is a great recipe! I used my potato ricer and it made it very easy and not too messy. I think it might work better than a cheese grater. I'll definitely make it again!

Very tasty and worth making. Such comfort food! I used chives and parsley and served it with a rotisserie chicken. I used a food mill with the large hole disk; it worked well. The spaetzle stayed separated and sauteed beautifully. Yum!

I loved this! I made the spaetzle to go into chicken soup for book club and they were great. Everyone raved about them. I was worried about making them with just a cheese grater, but it really wasn't that messy. I've made them again a couple of times and loved them each time. I used only parsley, but imagine that other herbs would be good too.

I'm not going to rate this recipe as I did not make it as said. I used it without the herbs as just a plain spaetzle recipe and it was fantastic. My fiance who spent much of his childhood in Germany was thrilled by it. I was worried about it being difficult to make without a spaetzle maker, but I used a ziploc with holes snipped in it and it worked just fine. Also, an easy way to tell if the spaetzle is cooked is when it floats.

Wonderful flavor on the spaetzle. I haven't made the sauce, but have done the noodles a number of times and always get great compliments. Went to Germany last year and found this recipe to be very close to what we ate there. Love this.

I have made this several times - with and without mushrooms. Great both ways. Even though the recipe says it can be made only 3 hours ahead of time, I make it a day ahead and refrigerate. So, all you have to do prior to serving is bring to room temp and saute. Especially convenient if you work and don't have time or want to mess up your kitchen just before guests arrive.

Really tasty and flavorful! I used fresh thyme, sage, and then some dried herbs, and the flavor was very good and very buttery. (I might cut back on the butter next time to make it a little more healthy, but, as is, it was delicious.) Apprehensively I used a regular cheese grater to press the batter through, and surprisingly, it was pretty easy, just a little time consuming, as I had to do it in batches, like the recipe says. It does make 4 main course german-sized portions. I will definitely make again.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time it was so good, but so messy (pushing through a cheese grater) that I got a spaetzle maker. Well worth it! I use soy milk instead of whole milk, and find I need to add a bit more or the dough is too thick. Delicious!

The herbs in this dish give a sometimes heavy plate a lighter taste. The dough was simple to work with and this recipe is simple to modify to taste.

Mint, sage, Greek oregano, and a dash of cinnamon are nice choices too.. Don't skimp on the flat leaf parsley!
