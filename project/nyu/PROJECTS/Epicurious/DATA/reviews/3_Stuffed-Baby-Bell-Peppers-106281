YAWN This recipe reads like it could be tasty, but, it just is too bland. I added garlic, but obviously not enough. Next time, I would add a stronger cheese, perhaps goat's cheese, and maybe some spinach and a bunch of garlic. The mixture it self is a nice start, but it needs work.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed this recipe very much after a few adjustments...we added 1/2lb spicy italian sausage and a couple of cloves of garlic sauteed with the onions and chopped up into the mix along with more parsley. Without the kick of the sausage I think this would have been very bland. Also, baked on a crusty bread crumb top on each pepper.

I have to say I was very disappointed after reading the other reviews. I found this recipe very bland and not worthy of serving to anyone. I had to re-check the recipe to make sure I did not make any errors, and I followed it exactly...don't recomend it!!!

These were a big hit at a recent barbecue. All ages loved them. I used half fresh grated parmesan and half romano. Give yourself extra time to stuff the peppers.

I feel guilty reviewing this, considering that I didn't really follow the recipe. I just took inspiration and moved from there...All I can say is that capers, black and green olives, and sauteed onions, mixed with some lean ground beef and brown rice, can be wicked when stuffed inside a pepper! I served the peppers with roasted tomato sauce. I even cooked what didn't fit inside the peppers as a meatloaf, and it was amazing. Let your imagination run with this one!

Great! Elegant and not too time consuming. Looks great with a formal meal.
