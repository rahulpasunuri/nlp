This was by far, one of the best tarts I have ever made. I followed another reviewers advice and added more butter to the crust, it turned out like a sweet, buttery rosemary shortbread cookie. The filling was superb but I needed more lemon flavor so I added twice the grated peel and a dash of lemon juice. I can't wait to make this again, my only issue is that fig season is so dam short!!

Wonderful. This is our 2nd time to make this yummy tart. Used a bit more butter, a bit less water and doubled the salt to make the shell more like shortbread than dough. Also added a little port to the glaze.

This was so easy to make, tasted fantastic, too. I skipped the currant jelly and drizzle the figs with rose infused honey instead. I'll be making this again soon!

This is my favorite summer dessert recipe yet. Perfect every time.

Incredible and so interesting. Made them in individual tarts pans which was a pretty presentation and just drizzled with fantastic honey from the farmers market instead of the glaze. I also couldn't find cornmeal that wasn't stone-ground but did as another reviewer suggested and used corn flour. We will have this often-- restaurant quality dessert.

Loved it! Perhaps next time I will add a bit more salt and a bit more butter (less water) for the crust so that it is more like shortbread and less like a regular cookie.

The crust makes this exceptional. What a great overall combination and balance of flavors.

The crust on this was AMAZING! I want to try it in some kind of savory recipe! I took another reviewer's suggestion and used greek yogurt in place of sour cream, and it was great. The fresh figs (I have an abudance from my 6-year-old tree this year) are wonderful, but I suspect you could use other (sweet and ripe) fruits as well! The hint of lemon in the filling really adds to the entire effect. I think little individual tarts would be lovely, and I'm going to try that in the future.

A girlfriend made this for a dinner club event last night. Absolutely to die for! The crust is the star. Will put this in the fall rotation.

A dear friend served this tart at a luncheon I attended yesterday. It was the best tart I ever tasted!

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe. The heartiness of the cornmeal and the hint of rosemary was wonderful. I picked ripe sweet figs off the tree. I also doubled the lemon rind because I love lemon. I also discovered that I had no sour cream and used greek plain yogurt instead. It was awesome. Definitely saving this one. :)

Wonderful recipe. I substitutes some ground blanched almonds for part of the flour. Very easy. Great with figs but I will try it with other fruits.

I made this tart for an engagement party, along with Beaumes-de-Venise Cake with Grapes (also found on this website). I chose this recipe because I had big, beautiful figs that I wanted to use. I usually am unsuccessful with crusts, so I hesitated to make the tart, but this was so easy. I don't know how one can find cornmeal that is not stone ground. I just chose the finest grind, which worked well. Pressing the crust into the tart tin instead of rolling it out made a world of difference. The tart was absolutely gorgeous! The rosemary was wonderful, and the mascarpone filling was delicious. Both the cake and the tart were unusual (and sophisticated) and won rave reviews.

Wow! What a terrific dessert!!! Very tasty & beautiful to look at. I served this at a dinner party and all of the guests were very impressed. I wouldn't change a thing.

Beautiful, fresh tasting tart that is not too sweet. I enjoyed the crunchiness of the crust and the hint of rosemary went well with the honeyed glaze. Good, fresh figs are what make the tart, though.

Rating: 4
Also, since red currant is hard to find, I used apricot jam instead - excellent.

My mom first made this a few years ago when a kind neighbor with a tree gave her some fresh figs and it was memorable indeed. When I saw some in Trader Joe's this weekend I snapped some up and made the tart, which is phenomenal. I think it'd also be nice with fresh apricots or plums.

Great Yum! Ok but what is "Not stone ground cornmeal". I tried course..ummm not good.. to crunchy. Then used corn meal flour...That worked great. Made the kitchen smell great too. Had to have the figs flow in as i live in Wisconsin!

yummy and trying it next with my Habenero Peach chutney in the place of the currant jelly

Rating: 4
A delicious showcase for fresh figs. The flavor combination is perfect. The rosemary crust is light and crumbly and complements the sweetness of the filling and glaze. And it is actually pretty easy to make because the crust is not rolled and can be prepared ahead of time, along with the filling. I will definitely be making this again the next time I can find fresh figs!

I made this last week, but had to use a combo of blueberries and peaches as the store had no figs. It was a big hit--the contrast of the savory cornmeal/rosemary crust with the lemony filling and sweet fruits was fantastic. I'm making it again for a party tomorrow--Labor Day!--and my wife just saw that our store had fresh figs on sale! Will try to post a review after trying the tart with figs.

Delicious end to a summer dinner. I used a 9" round tart pan, which meant a thicker layer of mascarpone creme and a bit of leftover dough for the crust. The rosemary was a good touch.

This was really wonderful. I am finding that cornmeal is a great ingredient in summer fruit desserts. This was an unusual, amazing combination of sweet and savory flavors. I am not too familiar with fig desserts, but I liked this enough to definitely make this again.

Savory, fragrant, rich and very impressive to look at. The flavors really compliment eachother.

I thought the flavor pairings would be too "busy" but it really wasn't. My husband said it was good but I didn't think much of the crust. The rosemary was overpowering and you should definitely not use stone-ground cornmeal. The filling was yummy though. The lemon cream marscapone was a gentle flavor and was nice with the figs. I drizzled a reduction of balsamic vinegar and swirled in some raspberry jam for a bit more sweetness. With the exception of the crust, I will try this again. This time is was a sad waste of fresh figs from the garden.

This was a show-stopper at my last dinner party. The presentation is stunning. The almost savory rosemary crust is a perfect balance to the sweet filling. I used twice the jelly in the glaze and it made a beautiful, shiny red glaze across the top that enhanced the looks and taste.

Rating: 3
The presentation of this tart was beautiful. Very impressive combination of flavors and textures. I found the crust to be slightly on the thick side, as well as somewhat dry. Rosemary added a delicate yet surprising flavor to accent the figs. I used red raspberry jam rather then red currant jelly.

This tart gets 4 stars for the presentation. On taste I would give it 3 or 3 and a half. It definitely tasted quite good, and the presentation impressed my guests. The tastes and textures were, as other reviewers have said, an unexpected and delightful combination. As far as the red currant jelly, I didn't feel it added anything particularly significant to the tart. And the honey was rather unneccessary on the figs--which are wonderfully sweet already. If I were doing it all over again, I would warm a few tablespopons of lavendar honey or spring flowers honey and pour that over the tart. The glazing does add something, but the red currant jelly and typical clover honey didn't really do anything for me, or my guests. For those of you looking for substitutes, try one of the more interesting honeys alone. Also, I used a 9" round tart pan because I didn't have a larger one. That was definitely a mistake. I prefer very thin, light crusts, so next time I'll use an 11" round pan (bigger than the recipe advises) to thin it out even more. It's a substantial crust as it is, so I think it would be better as thin as possible.

Rating: 4
I made this for a dinner party & everyone loved it. One friend even mentioned that he was still thinking about it a few weeks ago. I was a little hesitant to try it originally because the crust sounded a little too complicated (flavors) but the savory flavor against the marscapone was sooo good. Best of all - it's extremely quick & easy to make!!

Any ideas for substitutes for the red-currant jelly?

Rating: 4
A true keeper. An amazing combination of contrasting textures (crust vs. filling and fruit) and delicate tastes. Using cream cheese in place of mascarpone is a sacrilege. Mascarpone provides a much more subtle taste and a refined texture that cream cheese can never match. Cream cheese acidity will dampen the taste of lemon zest and affect the taste of figs. Feel free to slice figs much thicker than on the picture. I've made it with three different varieties of figs so far, and it was amazing each and every time. Suggestion to try other fruit is interesting but do make it with figs for royal indulgence or you won't know what you're missing. If your oven is convection, cut down baking time.

This was really good. It turned out so pretty I took a picture of it before cutting out. The flavors blended nicely. The rosemary was wonderful in the cornmeal crust. My figs were so ripe and sweet, it would have been more tasty not to add but a dash of sugar to the mascarpone filling, used slightly more tart lemon and not glaze the figs. Next time I should taste my figs to adjust the filling accordingly. Will make again with thicker slices of ripe figs.

Rating: 3
Makes for a beautiful tart; absolutely needs the rosemary/cornmeal crust. Next time I'll double the fig slices; better once it develops more flavor overnight. Good basic crust & filling tart recipe for adding other fruits. Apricots perhaps?

I am not a good baker, but this was easy and delicious. Have made it twice to rave reviews. Even people who say they don't really like figs loved this tart. The cornmeal in the crust and the rosemary really make this tart a standout!

Rating: 3
Delicious indeed, and worth making again and again! I would caution against substituting cream cheese for the mascarpone as this will compromise the subtle flavour of this tart. The next time, I will prepare the tart a day ahead and serve it slightly chilled; this apears to enhance the flavours. As well, I plan to experiment by adding some fine balsamico rather than honey to the glaze.

A showstopper indeed. Very elegant and delicious. The mascarpone mixture is simply exquisite. I will try it again with other fruit.

What a showstopper. This tart looks like a million bucks, and that you, the prof-gourmet, slaved away at it for days! It is ridiculously easy to prepare, don't let the ingred list put you off. It's also an expensive recipe to make, so I suggest to use cream cheese cut with sour cream to make the consistancy of the mascarpone instead of the real mc coy. You won't be able to taste the difference enough to justify the $10.00 on the cheese, IMHO. Ripe, succulent figs are crucial to it's success- (if you can, buy organic) otherwise you'll end up with a dry, dusty tasting fig topping. I served this to a dinner party, and even though everyone was stuffed nobody left a bite of their dessert. This is the first recipe I've ever given 4 forks... and I'd give it 5 if I could! Simply outstanding and elegant.

Rating: 3
My guests were still full from the main meal, but we all decided to dig into this tart. Everyone ate every bite of their serving. This was remarkably simple, gorgeous to look at and tasted divine. It was both sweet and savory--the perfect dessert. It looks far more complicated than it actually is. I can't wait to make it again.

It looks like the figs are not peeled in the picture? Do people eat figs unpeeled? I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it before even taking a bite. The presentation is relaly nice, once you peel the figs. And they devoured the whole thing! Anyway, I have been looking for a recipe to duplicate my favorite fig tart at this really expensive patisserie, and I think this is it! Not the same, but I think this one's better, and so easy to make. The rosemary smelled so nice when the shell is baking in the oven. I did mistakenly use salted butter so the crust came out a little salty. Will be more careful next time.

Rating: 3
I was intrigued by this recipe because of the cornmeal in the crust and the mascarpone cheese, both of which I love. I was a bit too excited to taste it, so I didn't let the crust cool sufficiently. It tasted good, although I thought that there was just a little too much rosemary. I'd decrease the amount ever so slightly next time. As opposed to some reviews, I liked the cookie-like texture - not too dry for me. The filling was perfect - very lemony and not too sweet. I didn't glaze the top. I wanted all the fresh fig flavor to shine through. After sitting in the refrigerator overnight, the flavors were even better. Next time I'll let the crust cool before filling.

Make sure you look at the picture attached to the review. I have made this recipe several times and even desert haters love it. I grated lemon zest on my cheese grater to make it finer. Make sure you chop your rosemary really fine.

Rating: 3
This was an excellent tart with a nice balance of sweet and savory flavors. The cornmeal and rosemary in the crust were perfect counterpoints to the sweet figs and rich lemon mascarpone cream. The tart is a snap to put together if one makes the crust and lemon cream the day before and assembles the tart at the last minute. Each of my guests loved this dessert. It was a big hit!

Rating: 3
Much easier to make that it appears. I did increase the amount of sugar and used powdered sugar instead. I had a smaller tart pan that called for so I used the extra lemon cream filling to stuff some dried figs I had. I liked that almost better than the tart!

Rating: 3
I was really intrigued by the look and sound of this recipe. The ingredients can be expensive if you don't have your own fig tree. I think it might be wasted on people who are not very knowledgeable about food but I made it for friends who are gourmets and we all enjoyed it very much. It's a winner!

Rating: 4
This is such a great concept in foolproof form, assuming you can find ripe figs and good quality mascarpone. I love the rosemary in the crust contrasting with the sweet elements. It may not be the most "accessible" recipe, but those who like it will love it!

Rating: 4
Amazing dessert. The best tart ever! I used 8.8 oz of Marscapone and a little more sugar and lemon zest. I am glad I had the extra cream as it complements the crust so well and I could tell if you didn't have enough cream, you may think the crust is too dry. Be sure to use high end corn meal that is not stone ground for the crust. Also, a little fresh ground Kenyan decaf with cream and Calvados really sent this experience over the top.

A 4 rating sounds like something I've never eaten. On the other hand, this fig tart was the best I've ever eatten, and I'm making it again this weekend using nectarines as well as figs...and serving it with ice cold lemoncello. yum!

Delicious! The combination of the crunchy crust, smooth filling and sweet figs was outstanding. I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream since I didn't have any in my fridge. My party of four gobbled up the entire tart in one sitting.

I enjoyed this tart very much, as did all of my 18 dinner party guests (I had several desserts). It is easy,attractive and if you like figs and are looking for a dish that highlights them, you'll enjoy this.
