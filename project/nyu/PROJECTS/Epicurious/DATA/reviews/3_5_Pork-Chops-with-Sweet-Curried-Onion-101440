Simple and tasty. It's quite different from the usual marinade or pan reduction I do for pork filets, and it is good enough to make again. And it does go well with the suggested apple and celery salad.

Delish! Thanks so much to the other reviewers for their suggestions! I did three tablespoons jam, 1 tablespoon curry, and a medium yellow onion instead of red. It was absolutely wonderful, and as others said, it would be fantastic on chicken. I served it with a fresh spinach salad topped with feta. I think it would have been way too weak in flavor without the changes.

As some of the others, I substituted a dry white wine for the water and used only 1 teaspoon of Jamaican curry, as not to kill the taste of the porc. After seasoning the 1 inch chops I seized them for 2 minutes per side on the grill. The chops where then placed along with the sauce in a bag made of parchement paper and cooked "en papillote" at 325F until they reached an internal temperature of 160F. They where then let to rest for 5 minutes. This was done so that the chops would be tender, and in effect they where. I served this on a bed of white rice cooked in chicken bouillon with some chopped roasted walnuts added to the rice. Along with this I served a simple salad with a oil and vinegar sauce.

So yummy! Thanks to the previous reviewers who suggested using wine vs water and tripling the apricot jam. We loved it!

I made this for a family dinner, and everyone loved it, even my most picky eater. I used more of the apricot jam, and a white wine (bordeaux) rather than the water. I also used the wine to deglaze the pan after cooking the onions and curry. I serverd a salad of spinach, apple, toasted pecans, golden raisins with a mango chutmey- curry dressing, and some brown basmati rice. We drank the white bordeaux. All told, it was an easy, tasty meal.

I must have really messed up on this recipe, because we(me and my family) hated it. I didn't even finish my meal. The onions that everyone raved about were a liquidy mess and the flavors did not seem to blend and taste good with the pork.

Loooved it! I thought I wasn't going to love it but boy was I wrong. Used apricot preserves instead of jam and increased the amount.Reduced the amount of water and used crry paste instead of powder. Definitely will make again.

Loved it......hubby doesn't like the sweet so much but he ate the whole thing. I used extra curry, and a hot curry at that. Thought it was great....onions and such took longer for me though.

Actually pretty easy to make and very tasty. I loved it. Although if you use an inexpensive cut of pork, it will be a little oily.

This dish is quite tasty and very easy. I used 1.5 tblsp of curry and 3 tblsp of jam (red pepper jelly). We loved it and will definitely make it again.

This was actually really good and VERY easy to make. The onions turned out delicious. I followed the suggestion of using more jam and less water. Turned out great and it was quick!

Made this dish with few changes. Used white onion, 1 tbsp curry, substituted 2 tbsp saki for water and mango chutney for jam and added handful of raisins. Sauteed curried onion in saki-chutney-raisin mixture for at least 10 min. Served with saffron rice and salad. Delicious.

I will certainly make this recipe again. There is nothing to it and the results are so flavorful. I did take the advice of other reviewers and used 3tbs of apricot jam. I also used much more curry than was called for.

My husband loved this, but I used a mango chutney in lieu of the apricot jam. Turned the pork dinner into an indian entree.

I gave this recipe two forks because even though I used some hot curry powder and increased the jam it still needed something. I found that I had left over hot chinese mustard and added a generous teaspoon of that to the sauce. Success!! With the mustard I'd say it was Delicious. I also had thick boneless chops that I pounded out. This would be great on chicken as well.

This was absolutely delicious and incredibly simple. I took the advice of the other reviewers and used about 3 tablespoons of apricot preserves, then followed the rest of the recipe. I used boneless pork loin steaks instead of pork chops. Next time I will use pork chops or pound the steaks so they are flatter and cook faster as the thickness of the pork loin steaks and the extra time it took to cook them did not really suit this recipe. This is a wonderful recipe, a definite keeper!

Very easy and tasty recipe. Great for a weeknight, but could also be served to guests. But I agree that you have to increase the amount of jam, and I found that 2 tablespoons af water were enough. I made used 1 tablespoon curry to increase the taste. Served it with simple basmati rice, lovely.

Very easy to prepare!!! Everyone loved it and it's been requested several times already. I did follow the advice of the prior cooks and increased the amount of apricot preserves and decrease the amount of water (to taste). Enjoy!

Very easy, unique flavor, and quick to make. A wonderful weeknight preparation for pork chops. You may even wow guests for a last minute dinner party. I served this with Two-Potato Gratin (on this website) and green beans. I took others advice and increased the jam to about 3 tablespoons, made the full recipe of the jam mixture, and halved the rest of the ingredients for two of us.

Very, very easy and quick to make. Delicious, but I agree with other reviewers that you need to use two to three times more apricot preserves than called for. Otherwise this is a great recipe that I will surely make again. It paired nicely with curried couscous.

Tonight I was the cook; elizabeth cook's husband. We both enjoyed this recipe. It was very simple, took little time to prepare and given the non elaborate nature of this recipe, it was terrific. I would suggest two things. First, use less water than recommended or add corn starch to thicken. Second, add more jam (preserves could be better)than recommended. I doubled the amount.

A great twist on pork chops. I used red currant jam and still thought it was very tasty. Great with the apple-celery salad, too.

Quite tasty. I too added twice the amount of apricot preserves as well as substituting a yellow onion for the red one. I served it with a brown rice pilaf and found the meal wonderful. I bet it would be good with chicken too.

Great quick and flavorful recipe. Definitely a new twist on the average pork recipe. Use 2-3X the amount of apricot preserves.

Absolutely FANTASTIC flavor, and really easy to make (though kinda messy to clean up, but that's for the hubby to do anyway! LOL) I doubled the apricot jam from the start (going by the other reviewers) and it was excellent! About to make it again tonite! Rated this originally 1 1/2 years ago, and still come to the site to try to remember all the ingredients (which is strange since there's so few, don't be fooled, it has MEGA flavor and is a great change in the regular old pork chop recipe!) Thanks for the recipe, and great site!

Great recipe for a weeknight meal. I also doubled the amount of preserves, and it came out great. When I returned the onion to the skillet, I added a little more water and let it simmer for about 5 minutes to thicken the sauce. Great flavor for a fast and healthy meal.

As promised, this recipe was quick and easy. I added fresh apricots (because they got squashed on the way home from the store) and then blended the sauce. Served with basmati rice. Yum.

I give it a 2.5, my wife gives it a 3.0. Substituted a large white onion, used 1/4 cup apricot jam, stuck with 1.5 tsp curry. Wasn't paricularly outstanding, but for my wife's sake I'll be making it again sometime soon. Also, it's nice and fast, taking closer to 35 minutes than 45.

Delicious! I had to substitute orange marmalade for the apricot jam, and I think it would have been better with the apricot, and more of it. Having been brought up with a deathly fear of trichanosis (sp?) I baked the chops before browning them in the pan. I made it for Valentine's day, and we both enjoyed it.

For the sauce I used 1/3c. dry sherry instead of the water, and 2tbsp. no-sugar-added preserves, which turned out well. Also used a little more curry (2 hefty tsp). Seasoned the pork and the sauce with garlic salt instead of plain. I used the whole onion, and glad I did, because with the delicate sweet curry flavor, the onion made a great side dish rather than just an accent. I served it with fresh cream peas w/dill, Butternut squash and Great Northern Beans. We really enjoyed this as a low glycemic meal.

not too bad because it is rich in flavours that complement each other. i used sweet mango chutney since apricot jam was unavail. would not mind doing it again at home, but not for guests.

Quick and easy, but delicious. I took the advice here and used more jam (maybe 1/4 cup) and used a plain yellow onion instead of a red one. I didn't make the accompanying salad recipe, but I did make my own version of a raisin carrot slaw with red cabbage and cilantro. I served it with coconut rice.

I made this recipe with great results my husband loved it even though he hates trying new things!! I did take the advise and made more sauce using a half a cup of sauce and used 4 tsp of a three fruit jam. Very tasty!! I also used only 1 tsp of curry powder and 1 tsp of curry paste. A definite keeper!!

The sauce is great the pork chops are tender-this sauce requires the old to taste theory--looks like most of us agree more sauce--will definietly make again.

Wonderful! I've never made pork shops before. What a great way to start. I followed all the suggestions of putting less onion and more jam. My husband couldn't stop eating it.

The onions turned out great!! The apricot jam/curry powder sauce was an incredible combination. I also added hot curry paste which gave it a little heat...and doubled or tripled the amount of apricot jam.

I doubled the apricot jam and still didn't think it was nearly enough. We liked this well enough, but I've got so many other good pork chop recipes that I'm sure we probably won't try this one again. But if I was--I'd use a little less onion and a LOT more jam!

Quick, easy, and VERY delicious. I took the advice of others and added double the amount of apricot jam. I also used 3/4 " thick boneless center-cut pork chops. They turned out perfectly moist and flavorful. A definite dish to keep in mind for last minute dinner guests as well. All ingredients are on hand at all times in many households.

This was a great recipe. However, I feel I should let you know that I changed it a little, out of circumstance. I thought I had apricot jelly/jam in the pantry. To my surprise I did not, so I substituted homemade orange-mint jelly. The recipe still worked fine. I served it with fresh yellow squash and chardonnay. A really quick and tasty meal.

This is a great weeknight recipe--the curry flavor is delicious with the pork. I might add a bit more apricots to the onion curry...
