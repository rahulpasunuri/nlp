Not bad. I made as is except for using farro in place of pasta, and then I just used plain crimini mushrooms. I did think the radicchio was a little too bitter for the recipe, but as others have noted, you either love it or you don't.

I loved the idea of pasta with mushrooms and radicchio, but not the idea of it as a salad. I changed it completely, I cooked the radicchio with the mushrooms, and added cherry tomatoes. I eliminated the vinegar and mustard and let the broth, the liquid from the mushrooms and the oil be the sauce. It was fantastic!

The leftovers were pretty gross. I guess it'd be better as a one time meal.

Eh. Decent, but I won't be making it again.

I made it with spinach instead -- it was still great, but could've used some red pepper flakes. I also added a bit more olive oil than the recipe called for and used vegetable broth. A great weekday-dinner recipe: simple, tasty, not too hard or time-consuming.

My husband and I thought this was delicious. The recipe was easy and very tasty. My only recommendation is to watch the amount of pepper you use, as the radicchio is bitter and peppery. I doubled the amount of Dijon mustard for more tang.

Wow! I was surprised at just how delicious this salad was. I used fresh picked radicchio from my garden. Perfect and so easy.

Yum. This is a quick, light summer dish. I added more mustard and vinegar for a little added zip. Great for leftovers as well.

The recipe had a lot of basic ingredients that sound good when mixed together. If the radicchio, and d. mustard were not added and then maybe add a few more herbs and spices to added a bit of zip, the recipe would be good.

This was an easy to make, delicious recipe! I added fresh basil because I had some in the fridge and it was spectacular. I used baby portabellas instead of white mushrooms because when cooked, they stay firmer. Also good as leftovers served cold.

Not having access to fresh Shitaki mushrooms, we opted to use some re-constituted dried, and used fresh Portabello in lieu of. Very tasty! We served this with some asian style chicken thighs, and enjoyed it thoroughly. Next time, we plan to serve the salad hot (using Shitakis)on a bed of lettuce, tossed with diced chicken. Company fare for sure!
