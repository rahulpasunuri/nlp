Definately hit this one out of the ballpark for my vegetarian friends. I made the recipe as stated but replaced the radicchio with black kale (much more nutritious, easier to find and less bitter), doubled up on the pear and feta as other reviewers suggested and added halved red seedless grapes. If you wanted to up the protein level I would add a half cup of chickpeas to it. Very quick, easy and it looks nice too. I would definately make this again.

To passanie: I'm not too familiar with radicchio, but often salad greens (or reds) fresh from the farmers market have A LOI more flavor-- often bitter or peppery-- than the same vegetables, days old, sitting at the supermarket.

This is delicious. I had some precooked barley, next time I will warm it up. Also, I use almonds instead of walnuts.

This was pretty good! I made it without raddichio because the one I bought at the farmers market was horribly bitter (I don't get that - it doesn't taste that bitter in the mixed greens I buy - was something wrong with it?). I substituted a small handful of mixed greens instead. Oh, and why so much oil? I didn't put any in and it tasted great. Especially love the nutty flavor of the toasted walnuts.

Easy, delicious and a beautiful salad to boot. Not at all bland as others have commented. Perfect as written - but simple to increase or decrease the quantities to your liking. So happy to have found another receipe that uses high quality carbs.

This was really good. I did not find it to be bland as others have. I might add a little more pear next time and make sure the feta is a saltier variety. Two tablespoons of lemon juice is pushing it--I might go easier on that. I would not substitute for the radicchio--that's the key ingredient for this salad.

Caveat: I made this without the celery or radicchio, and substituted pecans for the walnuts. Perfectly ripe pears are key. The lemon juice keeps the pears from oxidizing, so it stays good for a few days. Even without feta it works.

This was a good salad. It was a bit bland, but I would still make it again. Maybe add a red wine vinegar or substitute some of the parsley with other herbs. I also added some red grapes. I doubled this for a dinner party of four and it was way too much. The original would have served 4 as a side dish and still had leftovers.

I give this four forks, though I didn't exactly follow the recipe. I made this with toasted pecans instead of walnuts, omitted the feta, radicchio and celery. I added salt (since I didn't use the salty cheese) and fresh pepper. Very tasty! The lemon juice keeps the pear from browning, so its still pretty the next day.

I usually love this kind of dish, but this one had a very bland taste. I tried adding additional seasonings and even raisins to boost the flavor but still wasn't satisfied. I wouldn't make it again.

Delicious! Even my teenager liked it. I substituted fresh, chopped spinach for the parsley due to availability. I think I might keep the spinach the next time. Definitely will make it again.

Really good. I made the salad without the radicchio, and served it chilled on a bed of mesclun greens, as a side dish. It does look kind of bland, but was really delicious and hearty.

I used apple instead of pear and added green grapes. Delicious! Not boring at all, as barley can be.

I used mixed greens and did not peel the pear. It was a delicious combination of ingredients! Light, yet filling.

Strange but good. My husband and I didn't quite know what to make of this salad, but we both enjoyed it. Next time I'll add more feta and more nuts. It's a strange mix of ingredients, and I served it as the salad course (instead of as a side dish). After reading the other reviews, I'm curious to see what the leftovers are like. And we do have leftovers--I would say that this recipe serves four, not two.

Very good. As someone suggested, I used an apple instead of a pear. If you eat it as leftovers, make sure to bring it to room temp (texture improves).

Great California-style salad for a different twist! I used pre-packaged mixed salad to make this even easier (it included romaine, radicchio, etc.). I only added about 1/3-1/2 of the barley that the recipe called for and I added purple grapes for color and taste. Made it a very light and refreshing salad!

This was easy, quick, delicious, and pretty -- a four-forks combo! I have some leftover in the refrigerator now, and I have some doubts about its taste 1 day later (soggy feta?), but it's still a winner. 2 time-saving tips: I didn't peel the pear and did all the chopping with a food processor.

This recipie combined an interesting variety of flavors without being too overwhelming. I don't love radicchio and it's also pricey so I substituted arugula, which was delicious.

I found the radicchio too bitter, substituted baby bok chooy and cilantro. thought it needed a bit more lemon juice and oil but overall it was delicious. great as a light supper entree.

Quick & simple dish, if you have cooked your barley ahead when you have time. It would make a very good vegetarian main dish salad if you go heavy on the walnuts and cheese. I substituted apple because I've never liked pears. Healthy and tasty!

I love this salad - not only are the flavors unusual and delicious, but it's a very colorful dish - the greens of the celery and parsley and the purple-red of the radicchio make a pleasing presentation. To serve this to a friend who has an allergy to nuts, I substituted dry roasted sunflower seeds for the walnuts - yum.

The recipe was good and different. I will make it again but I will increase the Feta and pear a little to suit my tastes and offset the radicchio a little. If you have never tasted radicchio before the bitterness is a slight shock, but it blends well in this recipe. DLS
