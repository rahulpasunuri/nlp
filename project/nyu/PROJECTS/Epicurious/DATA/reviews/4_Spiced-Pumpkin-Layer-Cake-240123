For an inauguration party, this seemed like the very American choice. (Plus I had loads of leftover pumpkin.) I followed some fellow cooks' advice and increased the spices by a third, used 1/2 applesauce for the oil, soaked the raisins in rum and also, because I had light rum, doubled that for the icing. I chilled the icing to firm it up a bit. I only had a little bit of sweetened coconut, so used an equal amount of unsweetened mixed in for the topper. Everyone wanted to take a piece home with them. Orgasmic, was one comment. One great recipe!

Very moist and delicious! I was unexpectedly low on pumpkin so replaced half of it with applesauce and crushed pineapple. Worked brilliantly. Like other reviewers, I reduced the white sugar to 1 cup and it was plenty sweet. I also increased the rum in the frosting to 2 tbsp and it was still a very subtle flavor. Plenty of frosting to cover the whole thing, so I stuck the coconut to the sides instead of on top. Will definitely be making this again!

This was good, but even with 1 C white sugar in the cake and only 3 C powdered sugar in the frosting I found it too sweet. Maybe leaving out the raisins next time. They were distracting flavorwise,too. Another reason I deducted a fork---they said leave the sides bare, well mine still had traces of flour from the pans and looked horrible.

Rating: 4
REALLY GOOD! This cake looks and tastes just like autumn. As per the other reviews, I decreased the sugar to 1C white and a scant 1C brown. Also as other reviewers have mentioned, the baking time in the recipe seems to be incorrect - I baked two 9 inch rounds for 35-38 minutes, and they were perfect. Cake is moist with a great pumpkin spice taste and a beautiful crumb. A new favorite in my house - will make again and again!

I was excited to make this cake after reading the reviews, so I made it for a gaming night with a group of adults. The overall consensus was is it didn't have enough flavor! If I were to make it again, I'd up the spices, change canola oil to butter, and double the frosting recipe (it wasn't enough frosting to make the cake look like the photo). I will likely not make this recipe again, as there are many other recipes to try that will hopefully be more exciting to eat!

Made this for dinner with friends last night and we were scraping plates. Making it again for a weekend get-together. I used Craisins instead of raisins and decreased the coconut, just cause I'm not crazy about it. Delicious!

This recipe was fantastic. The cake was flavorful and moist. I used Bailey's Irish Cream in the icing instead and several people commented on how spectacular the frosting was. Overall a great recipe that got loads of praise.

Loved this pumpkin cake. It was moist and delicious. However while making the frosting I did not like how sweet it was going to become so I only put half the amount of powdered sugar for it and added 2 more tablespoons of the dark rum. It gave a good lingering taste of the rum which complimented the cake itself. Overall wonderful!

This pumpkin cake was AMAZING, and a great way to use up all the extra pumpkin in our cupboard that's been there since.... I don't even know. I'm not sure why we had so much in the first place! Anyway, we had 7 people raving about the cake as soon as they took their first bite. It was DELICIOUS and very moist! The rum in the icing made the icing unique and also gave the perfect touch to the cake. The one mistake I made was not putting enough icing between layers, make sure you put more than you think on.. :) It was an awesome recipe and I would definitely bake it again, it's a great recipe for autumn.

This is a great cake. I have used pumpkin pie spice in lieu of the various spices. I make it in a Bundt pan and frost it with orange frosting by adding a few drops of both red and yellow food color. For the stem I have used a flat bottom ice cream cone turned upside down and once even used a broccoli stalk for the stem. Looks just like a pumpkin and very pretty on your fall table!

This cake does not need to cook an hour. The bottom of mine came out burnt. So dissapointed as I am serving to company. I've made ahead of time so I'm hoping the frosting counteracts the dryness from over cooking. Have not tasted yet.

Easy and versatile cake. I used this cake recipe (minus the raisins and coconut) to make a shaped cake using a cake pan with a lot of detail, and it worked perfectly. I also let half of the batter sit for a while as the recipe made enough to fill the shaped pan twice. The second batch of cake was as good as the first. The flavor was delicious. Next time I will try it with the raisins and coconut and frosting.

Great recipe. The cake was moist and delicious. I didn't change anything about the recipe except I realized I didn't have and baking soda halfway through preparing it. Whoops! This didn't seem to affect the texture whatsover. For the frosting, I left out the rum (didn't have any) and tasted it as I added the powdered sugar- stopped at 3 cups because it was plenty sweet. The frosting also made enough to cover the sides of the cake as well, and not just in between the layers & on top. I will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious! I did what many other reviewers did and upped the spice measurements a bit and lowered the sugar to 1 cup and 1 cup. Otherwise I made the recipe as written. It was a huge hit in my house and I will make it again for sure. The cream cheese frosting was delicious as well. A lovely cake to share or to have at home for a fall weekend.

I made this as directed, except I added a dash of Lor Ann cheesecake flavoring to the frosting and it was AMAZING. I served it to friends, and it was a major hit. Easy to make, and there are so many potential variations. I am going to make it again soon, but will add pecans and clove. A definite keeper! I made this a couple of weeks ago, and people are still talking about it, calling it the "best cake [they've] ever had". Oh, and it's even better on day 2.

Great flexible base recipe! I made it with 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup honey, 2/3 cup oil and 2/3 cup applesauce, added 1/2 teaspoon more baking powder, increased the spices as suggested-also adding clove, put it in a bundt cake pan and marbled with melted chocolate. It turned out fantastic-moist and rich. I think it may be difficult to mess up this recipe.

Great cake! I followed the previous reviews and upped spices by 50% cut sugar to 3/4c white and 3/4 c brown sugar, sub half applesauce half oil for the full oil amount. I didn't have raisins but it would have been even be better if I did. I made this for my mother's birthday and everyone enjoyed it.

Wow! This cake is fabulous. I didn't have oil, so I used 1 cup butter and 1/4 cup apple sauce. I also took the other reviewers suggestions and upped the spices by 1/3, adding a big pinch of cloves to the mix. And since I didn't have shredded sweetened coconut, I reconstituted dessicated coconut and it was fantastic. I also used palm sugar for 1/2 of the brown sugar. Despite these changes, or maybe in spite of them, this is the best pumpkin cake I've ever had. I am even going to cut the sugar in half and try them as muffins. Yummy, yummy, yummy. You're going to love this one. Oh yes, reduce the baking time. I made 2 9" cakes and cooked them just over 30 minutes.

I followed a lot of suggestions in the reviews and made a couple of changes of my own resulting in a delectable treat. I upped the spices by 50% each, used half oil and half applesauce, and cut the sugar down to 1 cup white, scant 1 cup unpacked brown sugar. I am definitely making this again!

So I'm going to be one of those reviewers that didn't want to go to the store, but it was snowing...I didn't have raisins or coconut, so I used so chopped crystallized ginger and various nuts (sliced almonds and chopped walnuts and cashews). I used a mixture of whole wheat and soy flour since whole wheat flour makes my cakes too dense. I also used butter cream frosting instead and soaked the layers with Grand Marnier...all that being said, the cake was excellent. I was a little scared to make so many changes before trying it the original way, but it turned out great.

This is absolutely delicious! I've made it as a 3 layer 8" cake too, and bake it for 25 -30 minutes. If you do make the two 9" pans it does not need an hour to cook. It's always done in 45 minutes. Other people I've given the recipe to have had the same result.

This is great; I only give it 3 forks because it's not all that unique. I did tweak a bit, but it still turned out perfectly. I used the same amount of batter to make a 3 layer cake rather than a two. I only baked the rounds for about 30 min. I increased the frosting by a bit for full coverage of the layers. I used 1/2 applesauce for 1/2 the canola. It's the first time I've tried this - and the cake turned out as moist as ever. I did increase the spices as recommended, by about 1/3 and I added some ground cloves. Glad I did - depending on your taste it may be a bit light on spice without the increase (though it does over power the pumpkin a bit). I subbed pecans for the raisins. This is a great recipe, and versatile.

Had high hopes - I think the only problem with this was that it overcooked. It baked for 50 mins (not even the hour per directions) and it was a bit on the chewy side. I think I also over mixed the frosting as it was on the soft side - I did use a cheap brand of cream cheese and wonder if it is softer to begin with? Will try this again as cupcakes and watch the cooking time.

Very good. I made cupcakes (bake 20 mins) for a birthday party at work - the recipe made 24. Omitted the coconut because a co-worker is allergic. The icing recipe was enough for all the cupcakes. I also did not use all the butter - probably used 6 T. It's good but still a little heavy as pumpkin recipes tend to be. Not a light cake like a spice cake. But it's great to have a reliable pumpkin cake recipe.

Wonderful worth making!I added 1 cup chopped toasted walnuts to the batter. Used 2 8 inch pans. Baked 40 mintues, almost too long..do not go for 1 hour or it will be dry.

This is a delicious cake that is perfect for fall and winter. However, I thought that 2.5 cups sugar was a tad too much, so I used 1 c granulated and 1/2 c packed brown. It came out tasting amazing and I cut some calories. Also with the calorie cutting...the frosting calls for 10 tbsp butter. AH! WAY TOO MUCH! I used 5 tbsp, and the frosting was perfect. I didn't change anything else. Great cake!

I got a great response from this recipe. The cake had a very nice body, and kept quite well (I shared it with friends over a few days). When making it, I used about 2 tsp of ginger and only 1 of cinnamon, since my husband dislikes cinnamon in quantity, replaced the raisins with crystallized ginger, and omitted the coconut. I also made the recipe as cupcakes, since I wanted a lighter dessert. The cupcakes took about 25 minutes to bake, and came out very well. The recipe made between 25 and 30 cupcakes with plenty of frosting. In point of fact, I made the recipe twice, but only made the frosting once because people liked the cupcakes just as well without it. I'd definitely make it again.

I also omitted the raisins and coconut and added a pinch of cloves, which gave it some great extra spice. Delicious! I'm going to using it to make cupcakes for THanksgiving in the shape of turkeys- topping with toasted coconut and using candy corn for feathers and chocolate malt balls for the head.

I made this last weekend using a giant winter squash from my garden for the 2 cups of pumpkin. Then I added the raisins and subbed the coconut and orange for diced dried apricots, walnuts and lemon. I thought it turned out really well, and it tasted kinda healthy and earthy, the complete opposite of a grocery- store cake. My husband who doesn't like cake but loves pumpkin pie has been actually going back to the fridge for seconds and thirds. Topped it with a central arrangement of apricots, raisins and red roses and it was quite pretty too.

I made this recipe with just a few modifications. I replaced the pumpkin with a can of sweet potatos strained the syrup off and cut it with about 3/4 cup of apple cider tthen I omitted the orange peel and coconut. I say it has to be one of my most favorite cakes to eat now. It is super moist and very flavorfull. I gave several pieces to frinds and family to try and everyone of them stated that they loved it. YOU CAN TASTE THE RUM in the frosting So if kids or people with issues with alcohal are going to be eating you may want to use extract. The cream cheese frosting comes out very smooth and creamy and is very easy to apply if it is slightly cold. If you like spice cakes you will love this one.

What a disappointment! I made this for a party, and had that embarrassed disappointed feeling when everyone is politely eating, and you realize you could have made a better dessert from the Trader Joe's Pumpkin Bread mix. It was dry, & lacked flavor-- like a mediocre carrot cake (I couldn't taste the pumpkin at all). I won't be making this again. (By the way, I only baked it for 45 minutes, and it was still dry. I recommend checking after 30 minutes, to be safe!)

Easy and so delicious. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of the bake time. One hour is too long for two 9 inch cakes. I also baked in springform pans and they were done in 35-40 minutes. They still needed to be trimed. Also make sure to evenly distribute the frosting between layers and top. I didn't put enough frosting in-between the layers and so had some left over. The frosting is not too sweet. The cake would be dry without the frosting.

Impressive, easy, and good. I baked it in two springform pans and found that the tops were sufficiently flat that they did not need trimming.
