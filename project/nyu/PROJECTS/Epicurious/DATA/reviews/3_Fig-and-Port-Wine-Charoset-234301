Wow, this is just sooo delicious!! I added salt when the onions were cooking and I pureed it with an immersion blender before adding the pine nuts. I have never had charoset before and neither had my jewish fiance, so we had no pre-conceived notions of what charoset should taste like. He hates apples, so this was the only recipe that seemed like something we both would like. It was so yummy on matzoh and it also goes really well with a slice of gruyere on top or some blue cheese. I highly recommend!!!

An interesting taste - very different from what I except from charoset, though. More like a tzimmes.

Rich and savory! I didn't have figs; used prunes instead. Sooo good!
