Perfect! Especially if you use salted butter...it just enhances the sweetness and richness.

I halved the recipe, added some salt since I only had I salted butter, and used KAF glazing sugar instead of confectioner's...no cornstarch in the glazing sugar. Next time, will try using einkorn flour to make them wheat-free and double up on the vanilla.

Hello. I have tried many versiones of this cookie as I am mexican ans I live in México City. Truly they tend to be very buttery, so does this recipe, so I changed it a bit: I reduced the butter to 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks)and I add 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour. They come out a bit drier but crispier and there is no need to put the dough in the refigerator.

Was not as impressed with this recipe as I thought I'd be. They were still okay, but my grandma's recipe (Mexican Wedding Cakes) were better in my opinion. I have been looking for an exceptional recipe for this kind of cookie, and I am yet to find one. Maybe better luck next time!

I've made this recipe so many times, and it always turns out delicious! I usually leave out the cinnamon, and just coat with powdered sugar.

These are delectable! I took the advice of another reviewer and rolled the cookies in powdered sugar just before baking, and then again after baking according to the recipe instructions. These are really delicious.

Great recipe! I used this for a Mexican dinner party. Everyone thought they tasted good. Next time I will use 1 more tsp. of vegetable oil. I only used one to make it more moist. I also used a little extra powdered sugar in the dough part. So whatever I did made it delicious! Try using a little extra powdered1/3 cup sugar in dough and 2 tsp. of vegetable oil for moisture. Good luck!

I absolutely love mexican wedding cakes. I added a touch of cardamom with the cinnamon for the coating simply because I love the flavor.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! Rave reviews from everyone who has tasted them and requests to share the recipe and make more from them all. An easy, go-to, favorite! Based on reviews, I put in about 1-2 tsps of oil to help w/ moisture, otherwise, they were not dry at all. The batter will be sticky, but don't be afraid to add a little more flour to help form it into a ball for chilling. The recipe will only yield close to 4 dozen if you make really bite sized cookies, but I found the even larger cookies came out just fine.

Tip about the powdered sugar, roll the cookies in it before you bake this will put some of the sugar in the top layer of the cookie, then coat again as directed. You will be happy you did, this tip is from King Arthur whole grain cook book. Worth the work I promise. OH and this cookie is great super duper thumbs up and keep it for good

These were easy to make, turned out well, kept excellently in an airtight container, and best of all my girlfriend loved them! The cinnamon and powdered sugar coating is what you taste (it coats your mouth with the first bite) and you have to dust the cookies several times after rolling them in the mix as the moisture from the warm cookies turns the sugar into a glaze- like coating. The cookies themselves do have an excellent texture, though.

Rating: 4
these cookies were so easy and fast to make, but were such a big hit! i seriously think these could pass as professional bakery quality. i had some old walnuts that were going bitter, but after they got into these cookies, the bitterness was totally undetectable. also, my husband preferred them without the powdered sugar coating so that saved me the last couple of steps.

My family has been making Mexican Wedding Cakes for well over 40 years and they are a holiday tradition! My mother passed her recipe on to me, and I recently married an Italian who has always called these Italian Wedding Cookies. The slightly crumbly texture is fantastic - I mean, this is a SHORTBREAD recipe!! So simple and always a treat. They freeze really well - I make extra to enjoy in January and February!!

Wow! What a simple recipe but sooo delicious! By far the best Mexican wedding cakes I've made. Mine only took 15 min to bake, and next time I'll add 1/4 tsp salt, as I used unsalted butter. I liked the very subtle flavor the cinnamon added. These will be in my Christmas recipe binder from now on!

I practically had to use a crow bar to get my boyfriend away from these cookies. I made them for a potluck and they were the talk of the party. They were light and heavenly, and eating them was like eating a little puff of cloud. One girl said she'd like to eat her body weight in them. That's gotta be a compliment.

Rating: 3
I thought these were great... not FANTASTIC, but great. Excellent flavor (I used both walnuts and pecans, mixed together, so that you got a little bit of both in each cookie) but my primary complaint would be the slightly dry texture. I followed the directions pretty much to a T, minus the nut substitution. I think another user mentioned doing half butter and half margarine for a moister texture. I'll try that next time, unless there are any other suggestions out there.

Awesome recipe! I made these as part of my Christmas cookie exhange and they were a big hit. I tweaked the recipe a bit with tips from a Martha Stewart cookie cookbook. I used almonds instead of pecans and added 1/4 tsp. of salt. I also mixed the cinnamon in with the flour instead of adding it at the end.

Just make a double batch..a single one is too small! Also, since the cookies don't expand when cooking I made them into 1" rolled balls (bite size) so you can put more on a sheet. I also used salted butter and crushed walnuts. After the rolled in sugar cookies set, roll all the cookies in the sugar again as they are a little sticky. Yum!

These are a big hit with everyone. I did spilt the fat using 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup margarine and it yields a less crumbly cake/cookie in the end.

YUM! I love these cookies. I added a bit of salt, as suggested by previous reviewers, and they came out great. Oh, and in case anyone is wondering, if you (ahem) don't read the recipe and accidentally roll all the cookies in powdered sugar *before* you put them in the oven - they still come out fine. The half I both pre-and-post rolled might be even better than the ones that only got hit with the sugar after the oven. :)

People LOVED this!! They wanted more, but I didn't have enough for third servings for everybody. I would make this again. Although they tend to break apart easily if you handle them when it's still warm. (learned from my mistakes now :) )

Made these for a family gathering several years ago and got raves. Then, last weekend, I happened on a wedding cookie in an upscale bakery in Atlanta and they instantly reminded me of these. I will definitly make them again. Just don't be fooled by their powdery and light texture, they still have calories!! I could eat a plate full no problem.

Followed the recipe exactly as written and was VERY pleased. I tossed the cookies in the sugar twice, though - once about 5 minutes out of the oven per the recipe, then again once they were completely cool. Same recipe as in 1950 Betty Crocker, except that recipe has 1/4 less nuts and 1/4 cup more flour and half the vanilla. May try that version and see how it tastes, but this is definitely worth making!

For a gluten free recipe I used authentic flours GF blend for the flour, adding about a 1/2 tspn of xanthan gum. They baked up just fine, but are very fragile, so next time I will add one egg as a binder. However, they are terrific and totally GF!

My mother makes a version of these called Russian Tea Cakes (just omit the cinnamon) every year at Christmas. It simply wouldn't be Christmas without them. I came across this recipe while just checking out regular cookie recipes and was thrilled when I tried it out and it's just like Mom's! Everyone should at least attempt these once. Kids have a ton of fun rolling the warm cookies through the powdered sugar. (My favorite part was licking off the sticky mess left on my fingers afterwards.)

After trying many other versions, I stubbled upon this recipe a few years ago. I have made it every holiday season since. They always come out perfect and disappear quickly. The only change I've make is I double the cinnamon and mix it into the cookie batter rather then use it into the coating.

These are heavenly!! They just melt right in your mouth. During the cooling process, I couldn't wait to try one. I was in absolute heaven. I think they are the best when warmed a bit. Originally, thought these were going to be like pecan fingers. But unlike pecan fingers, these little cakes/cookies/bombs of heaven are light & airy, whereas pecan fingers are dense. My fiance, consumed his share in about 10min flat and wondering when I was going to make them again. They definitely hit the right chord in my kitchen & have earned their place in my recipe box.

These cookies aren't too sweet, and they have that traditional, crumbly, sandy texture that is addictive. I did find that after refrigerating as directed, the dough was a little more difficult to shape. (It kept crumbling apart) Other than that, these cookies went like wildfire at a ladies luncheon I catered.

Excellent cookies, easy to make. Be careful to add the exact amount of cinnamon or the cookies aren't as tasty. I made a double batch and added a little more by accident. It was noticeable but didn't make the cookies better.

I bake a lot of cookies and these always disappear first. This recipe is well written and easy to follow. The cinnamon is a nice touch, but I mix it in with the flour. I also like to add a little espresso powder just for a change. I highly recommend using a melon baller to get a small and consistant size. The smaller the better.

I make Mexican Wedding Cakes every Christmas, however, the recipe I use is much more time-efficient, and easier. Just put the 2 sticks butter,1/4 C. powdered sugar, 3/4 C. pecan pieces, 1/4 tsp. almond extract, 2 C. flour and 1/8 tsp. salt into food processor, process until it balls together, remove and wrap in wax paper, put in 'fridge one hour, roll into balls (not too big!), bake @ 375 for about 15 min. or til lightly browned on top. Let cool and roll in powdered sugar, and later, roll again in powdered sugar. Always receive many compliments on this! Melt in your mouth!

This cookie recipe, I created without a cookbook out of necessity when the kids wanted cookies! One ingredient was always missing. This one was so simple! And my children loved them! They call it our "Down and Out Cookies!" Its apart of us that reminds us how God has brought us through many things. I found out that many cultures have the same recipe, its just called another name.. I don't use cinnamon, just powdered sugar with vanilla in it.

Excellent! The best of the mexican wedding cookie recipes I've tried. One suggestion -- shape the cookies into balls before chilling the dough. then, just take out what you need and put them on the cookie sheet. they'll bake up nicer. Also, you can double the recipe and freeze 1/2. If they are already shaped, you can bake just what you need right from the freezer.
