This was delicious and I will definitely make this again--it's so easy. I used balsamic vinegar instead and it was still pretty tasty, and I added some butternut squash into the mix.

Really delicious! Definitely something I'd make again. Just keep an eye out for the balsamic which burns quickly.

This is the second time I made this dish and both times I was underwhelmed. The first time, I had roasted them earlier in the afternoon and reheated it for Thanksgiving dinner and they seemed blah and dried out. This time, I made sure to roast them just prior to dinner and it was the same result. I won't make these again and waste the fresh farmer's market carrots and fresh parsnips.

I don't care for parsnips so used sweet potatoes (not yams) instead. Also used pre-cut & peeled bag of carrots. We made one day ahead, refrigerated and re-heated while turkey was settling. Everyone loved, perfect side dish to all the other sides and very easy.

Made them for Thanksgiving - what a terrible disappointment! Dry, tasteless and less than blah. Thankfully, also made brussel sprout hash with caramelized shallots - TOO good for words!

Good, except that the parsnips cooked faster than the carrots. Next time I'll make the parsnips slightly bigger than the carrots so they'll be done at the same time!

Had really good carrots in season from farmers market. White Balsamic is a pantry staple, sweeter and more delicate, great for dressing salads, and I would recommend using it in this recipe.

I bought the while balsamic vinegar, but afterwards wondered why I bothered - just use the regular type. This was a nice recipe, but not spectacular.

I didn't have the white balsamic and used the regular. Still a very nice dish!
