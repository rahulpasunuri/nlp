Truly grand! As others have observed, using yummy fruit and ripe fruit is more important than the exact combination. For example, apriums worked great instead of plums, canteloupe instead of peaches, papaya instead of kiwis. (The rock-hard peaches and kiwis will get used later this week.) Other yummy subs: 1) St. Germain is milder and more subtle than Grand Marnier. Half as much is fine. 2) The juice of a couple Meyer lemons made the OJ a little more tart. 3) For a decadent accompaniment that works in hot weather, combine whipped Cream Chantilly and Mascarpone cheese -- doesn't go watery and tastes wonderful with fruit. I added a bit of St. Germain to the whipped cream instead of vanilla.

So easy, and works with any fruit you've got. Too early in the year for stone fruits so used sliced apples and pears instead, along with kiwis, green grapes and orange segments. Fine with sucralose instead of sugar in the orange liqueur sauce, which provides a nice intensity without an overwhelming alcohol taste. Everyone loved it, and I'll make it again and again. Really fresh tasting.

I have always used fresh fruit in the past, but couldn't find ripe peaches and plums this time of year. Used canned mandarin oranges and peaches and added extra of the other fruit to balance color and make up for the missing plums. It was still a great salad!

Wonderful fruit salad recipe. I made this for a barbecue as a healthy dessert and received many compliments. I didn't measure out the fruit, just eyeballed the proportions, adding more of the fruit that looked more ripe and balancing the colors. I used both black and yellow plums, white peaches, strawberries, less orange segments (didn't want it too citrusy since there is orange liqueur and o.j. in it), kiwi, mango and blackberries. I omitted the sugar (and didn't miss it). If you don't have to worry about nut allergies, adding sliced almonds on top just before serving is a tasty touch and adds crunch to the salad!

This is the first truly delicious fruit salad that I have ever made! It's obvious that many combinations of fruits work. We used green grapes, oranges, and strawberries - thanks to the reviewer who suggested adding the strawberries just before serving. I can't wait to try other fruit combinations. Also, we used only half of the Grand Manier, orange juice, and sugar - perfect for us!

I thought this was way too strong and I love grand marnier. The mix of fruit was nice and colorful.

Made this for brunch for guests and it is really colorful and very good. I thought that the juice mixture was a little to sweet and I may adjust that next time.

I made this as a "healthy alternative" for a Super Bowl party, and the entire salad was gone by the end of the night! Also, it's great for people who are allergic to pineapple.

lovely. used orange brandy ice wine instead of the sugar/grand marnier/oj and the sweetness level was perfect. served layered in a 12 cup trifle dish.

The fruits in this salad made such a nice combination that when it came time to add the liquor and sugar I just couldn't bring myself to. I poured in the OJ and didn't look back!

I'm not a big fruit salad person because they always seem kind of mushy and icky and brown but this one was GREAT! I loved the hint of Grand Marnier and I couldn't get enough of the fruit salad (I omitted the oranges as I forget to pick them up and it was still great)

Made this for a 90th birthday party on a hot day. Everyone liked it, young and old alike. Used bllueberries, raspberries, strawberries, white peaches, green grapes, mango, plums. Tip: wash and add the strawberries at the last minute, as they dont hold up well. Also, any brand of inexpensive orange-flavored liqueur will do. No need to splurge on the expensive kind.

This was delicious but I thought the booze was a little overpowering. Next time I make it I'll cut back on the Grand Marnier.

This is delicious and, with the liqueur sauce, it's light and elegant. I used Cointreau in the sauce. I used colorful fruits like pineapple, mandarin oranges, kiwi, strawberries and grapes. I served this at my son's baptism reception buffet and it my guests commented on it- which is a big complement for a fruit salad!

I have used both Cointreau and Grand Marnier in this recipe as well as an assortment of fruits. This recipe has gone over very well for brunch. Among other fruits I've used in this recipe are: apples, bananas, and blueberries.

This is a delicious fruit salad that I've served frequently for brunch. I've varied the fruits and do not bother measuring them. I usually do not include plums. Other fruits I've used are apples, bananas, and blueberries. I've used either Grand Marnier or Cointreau--whichever I've had on hand.

I let my fruit salad marinate for four hours, stirring it up once in a while, and it was delicious. Don't bother adding the sugar; you won't need it.

Used 2 C each of green grapes, strawberries and oranges. Used 1 C ea of blueberries and fresh precut pineapple. The green, red, orange, blue and yellow colors made a beautiful salad, and these fruits can almost always be found.

Very simple and delicious! You can substitute any of the fruits for whatever you'd like and it still tastes wonderful. I used blackberries, oranges, pineapple, kiwi, and green grapes.

Served this for Easter brunch and received lots of compliments. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, though, because I couldn't find all of the fruit. I used green grapes, strawberries, kiwi, oranges, tangelos, and tangerines. I followed the recipe otherwise, though, using Grand Marnier and not orange juice.

I used Gold pineapple, blueberries, cherries, cantaloupe, kiwi, and snuck in banana right before serving this with waffles for our New Year's Brunch. My family loved it. I made so much my boys and I snacked on it for a few days - very healthy considering all the Holiday leftovers! The key is to use the freshest, ripest fruit available (I did not add any liquor)

this was a great fruit salad -- everyone was right, I was also scared about the liquor, but it tasted terrific. I used pears, mango, blueberries, grapes, strawberries, and kiwi since it isn't summer fruit weather, and I served it with fresh whipped cream on the side. People lapped it up!

This is a very nice fruit salad. Not only is it tasty but it is one of the prettiest fruit salads I have ever made. I used black plums and yellow peaches. The rich colors and hint of green make it lovely to look at before enjoying its unique flavor with the Grand Marnier. I will make this again.

A perfect brunch dish for summertime -- I just made it for Father's Day and it was a huge hit. I was worried the Grand Marnier would overpower the fruit, but quite the contrary -- it complimented it perfectly. Some guests even poured the leftover sauce into their Mimosas! This is a great addition to any brunch menu.

Excellent zing to a fresh fruit salad. I served it in a small punch bowl on Easter morning for a brunch.

Exactly what I was looking for - fresh tasting fruit salad with a little zing for Thanksgiving breakfast. The "sauce" didn't taste good to me until it hit the fruit, but the flavors worked together perfectly. I used grapes, apples, honeydew, melons, pineapple and blueberries.

I was a little wary of messing with the flavor of a great fruit salad by adding orange juice and Grand Marnier, but the sauce really gave the dish some pizzaz. This was also really good as a topping for ice cream for a simple, adult sundae.

Apparently this dish is fail proof. I used what looked good at the store; strawberries, oranges, melons, grapes. I was out of Grand Marnier and had to use Triple Sec. Needed just a little extra sugar. Perfect for my Easter Buffet.

Wonderful and so easy. The Orange Liquor gave the salad a wonderfully light and fresh taste. Plums and peaches didn't look so good in our store, so I substituted watermelon and cantalope balls. Will definately make again!

I worried about adding an alcoholic liquid to this salad, and was pleased to find a non-alcoholic form of Tripple Sec to use. This salad was eaten as a side dish to Easter breakfast, and not a grape was left in the bowl! This fruit salad is beautiful to present, and is just as good to eat! A real crowd pleaser!

I am in fifth grade and I did this for a project for my class. Everyone wanted seconds and thirds. Everyone says that I make the best food. This was very good.

Outstanding, refreshing fruit salad. I skipped the sugar and added some dinasaur eggs, a hybrid cross between apricots and plums. I used Cointreau instead of Grand Marnier. Even with this switch the salad is truly "Grand". We had overnight guests who brunched on this salad before leaving in the late morning. Between the four of us we nearly finished off this dish for eight.

Made this for a potluck and everyone loved it! I don't particularly like fruit but loved this! Added extra sugar because the fruit wasn't as ripe and flavorful as I'd hoped; didn't skimp on the liquor as advised by others. Bought red grapes but will be sure to get green next time as the color is needed to balance all the red and peach.

This is a great recipe! I added Marionberries for some added color. This salad gets great raves!

This was quite good. I couldn't find fresh peaches at this time of year so I elminated them. It wasn't "boozy" liked I expected. I added edible pansies and a little grated coconut. It made a beautiful accompaniment to Easter brunch. It doesn't make as much as you might expect, though. I had to be careful of how much I served to each person.

I made this salad for Easter dinner last night & it was a huge hit! I tripled the recipe & it was completely devoured. Only a few drops of the juice were left in the bowl. Since peaches and plums aren't really in season, I substituted mangoes & I garnished the top with sliced star fruit. Since kids would be eating it, I also toned down the Grand Marnier (only used a splash) & added more orange juice and some juice from the mangoes. I think it would be even better full-strength!
