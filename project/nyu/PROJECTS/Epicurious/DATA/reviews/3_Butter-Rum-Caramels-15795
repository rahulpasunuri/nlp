sorry, but this recipe sucked. It had a decent flavor, but not great. I couldn't get it to actually solidify, even after chilling it for 2 full days, and it was a sticky mess to scrape out of the pan. When I saw that this one wasn't working I made a batch of the hazelnut caramels and they turned out excellent, try those instead.

An amazing recipe. I have made so many batches, everyone loves them! They are so easy to make, I don't even have a candy themometer (I just use the ball test), and they have been wonderful each time. I've doubled the recipe, and it's been great. Such an awesome gift to give!

We have been making these caramels for years. I have always done the vanilla for rum substitution as well. We have never had a problem removing the caramel from the pan or cutting it. It is crtical that you do not exceed the 245 degree mark and that you be sure to get an accurate reading(sometimes the temperature can be cooler towards the outside of the pan). We usually remove from heat at 244 degrees.

Like the previous reviewer, I substituted--1 T vanilla bean paste for the rum. I cooked at medium-low heat for 5 minutes, then raised the heat to medium-high; 6 minutes later the mixture was at the required temperature. I had difficulty getting the caramel out of the pan after refrigeration. These really are delicious.

I substituted 2 tsp vanilla for the rum and ended with a caramel that was easy to work with, good texture and tasty.

I agree--gauging the temp. was difficult and left me with a runny dish of caramel sauce that's not solidifying. Oh well.

Try cutting these. I dare you. Moderate heat is vague at best. Took forever to get to specified temperature and sugars crystallized. I suggest preparing the Hazelnut Caramels recipe and substituting the rum extract for the hazelnuts.
