Tried this pizza dough this weekend for the first time. For "no-knead" it was a lot more work than my usual recipe which I do in the stand mixer with the dough hook. I found the dough to be very sticky and only after adding another 2 cups of flour did it turn out to be a consistency I could stretch. Next time I will not just blindly add the 3 cups of water. We did love the taste, though - found it to be crispy and flavorful. Instead of baking it in the oven (just too hot in the midst of our summer here), we grilled the pizzas. Good recipe, just need to doctor it a bit.

Thought the dough was good, mine did not turn out bubbly. Maybe because I am at a high elevation, 8750. Or maybe because the air is a little cooler, and the rise at room temp is more like 60 degrees! Who knows? Anyone that can help me out?

I've experimented with a lot of different dough recipes, and this has yielded by far the best results (the first time I made it, I used the broiler, per the instructions). But best of all, I discovered last night that it's possible to make an excellent pizza using a stovetop grill pan. No more wasting energy (and making my kitchen unbearably hot) preheating an oven for an hour at 500 before I even start cooking. For methodology search the Serious Eats website for "grill pizza indoors" -- there's a slideshow that walks you through the whole process. Using this method, the no-knead crust turned out thin and crisp in the center, with a bubbled, chewy edge. I can't wait to make it again!

Have been meaning to try this (on the grill) for a while and just haven't gotten around to it, made with friends last night and it was terrific! Lightly sprayed the grill with Olive Oil 'Pam' and threw the crust right on there. When one side was cooked, flipped and then added toppings to each of the pizzas (did 1 white pizza, 2 red). So easy and fresh. Would also make great and fun appetizers cut into squares.

This is a very good pizza dough recipe and worth the wait.

The recipe reads,"add 3 cups water." What kind of water? Warm, like most yeast doughs? Cool tap water?

Best no knead dough I've tried so far. This is a real winner, couldn't be easier. I've made it with a pizza stone and, in a jam, on a baking sheet and the results were the same. I'll never buy pizza dough again!

Excellent recipe! My first time venturing to making my own pizza dough, and now I don't think I will ever try anything else at home! Very tasty, but slightly hard to handle...there was no throwing of this dough into the air, pizzeria style (ha ha!). My pizzas came out mis-shapened by quite delicious. Can't wait to try again!

This recipe worked perfectly, the first time, and produced a lovely, bubbly crisp crust. I was concerned about the timing factor. We let the dough rise about 20 hours (around 70-F) and did not have any issues with the dough being too soft. I did (and always do) weigh my bread ingredients using the metric measurements. A previous reviewer mentioned difficulty "rolling the dough." This is not the dough to roll, but rather to hand shape. We used it topped with garlic cream, fresh mozzarella and lightly steamed broccoli rabe. Delish!

Absolutely delicious! This dough is chewy on the inside, crispy on the outside and full of tasty little air bubbles. This is the kind of pizza that I always wished I knew how to make but couldn't quite figure out. It freezes well, too - I thawed it in the fridge overnight, then took it out to rest as directed - couldn't even tell it had been frozen. Mmmmm pizza.

This dough brings me joy. Unlike many, I find kneading tedious and no-knead bread delicious. This dough makes a fantastic pizza. We cut the recipe in half because we aren't feeding an army. So far, we've had the best results with heating the oven to 550, par baking each crust for 2.5 minutes, topping, then broiling until done. Looking forward to baking them on the grill. It would be great to hear how freezing the dough works out form those who try it.

It's fabulous as written. BUT the 2nd time I made it, I used 1/2 bread flour and divided into four pieces (instead of six) and made slightly larger, thicker pizzas to support more toppings. Just a personal prefernce!

Excellent dough recipe. Crust was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Totally worth the long fermentation time. I've got the leftovers in the freezer and am already planning the next pizza.

This makes a very delicious crust, but I had a hard time rolling it out thin enough without tearing the dough.

I let this rise 24 hours as my house is on the cool side. Worked out very well, topped with tomatoes & homemade mozzarella baked on a small slab of limestone from the garden in the convection toaster oven (it heats higher than the range oven). Tasty chewy crust.Froze the rest to see how it will work if I thaw it out & let it rest.

This will accompany my other go-to pizza dough recipe (I use olive oil and honey in that one)..The fermentation gives it a unique chew and taste and its even better stored in fridge up to a week then just shape and bake. I often pre-bake the crusts for 4-5 minutes, then freeze. Take out, top and bake for about 10 min..excellent!

I loved this pizza dough recipe! I've made other dough recipes before and it was a little weird trying to avoid kneading. But these were the best pizza crusts to ever come out of my oven. Just need to plan ahead (18-24 hour rise time), but so easy and so good!

This recipe was the best pizza dough I have ever eaten. It's very easy, jsut be prepared to make it into pizza 24 hours later. This will be my gold standard for pizza dough!

I'm willing to concede that I may have made errors in preparing the dough but this did not work for me. The amount of flour did not appear adequate for the liquid and I should have made the adjustments needed. The rise time seemed excessively long and it was difficult to coordinate with the time we wanted to prepare the pizza and the crust never cooked properly. Bon Appetit published a recipe by Giada several years ago that was much better with a short rise time and I have always had success with that recipe.
