I like my roasted garlic a little more firm to use in certain dishes as a standout flavor, such as in meatloaf, so if you want to do that here are my suggestions: 1) leave out the water, as that will steam your garlic into spreadability; 2) lower the temperature to 375; 3) watch it! Check the state of your garlic from time to time; my smaller cloves burned at the suggested time and temperature. If you follow these suggestions, though (especially the watching it part), you should end up with nice soft garlic cloves you can add to any dish as a boost, or just snack on 'em!

This is very easy to do, and it freezes well. But I would *never* turn on my oven for an hour just for this! If I'm using my oven for something else, I'll pop the garlic in with it, but usually, I make this in my smaller, more energy-efficient toaster oven.

Worked well- easy to do and came out nicely caramelized and creamy. Will try at a slightly lower temperature next time...

Bake at what degrees?

This was as easy as it was delicious. Use the good quality garlic though! This would be a great hors d'oeuvre spread on some bread. Will definely make again.
