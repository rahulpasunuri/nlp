Yum!! I recently discovered persimmons and really love texture and flavor. I made the recipe as directed and served over a bed of brown rice. The chutney mixed with the rice was delicious. Since I only needed two servings, I plan to mix the extra chutney with rice and use it as side for tomorrow's meal. My only comment is that the cook time for the lamb was off for me. I just purchased a new gas range and the lamb would have been overcooked had I used the times in the recipe. I will definitely make this again and also use the chutney recipe for other items. It would be delicious over cream cheese with crackers as an hor dourve. Bon appetite!

This recipe was okay. Perhaps one has to be a fan of persimmons. I'm no big fan, but was interested in trying something too. This one was too simple and the flavors of the persimmon and jalapeno did not blend well in my view. Perhaps a serrano or red chile would have been better.....something with a thai twist.

No persimmons at the market so I substituted mangoes, but did everything else as directed. This was the first time I've made lamp chops at home - not a huge lamb fan - but this was really tasty and the chutney really made it worthwhile. A keeper!

I haven't tried the dish yet, but gave it 4 forks because it sounds delicious and to keep the same average it has as of this date. I just wanted potential cooks to know that for Fuyu persimmons, firm-ripe is perfect. I just ate one today and it was wonderful! It's the "other", more pointy persimmon (I can't remember its name) that is acerbic if not eaten before it reaches the "mushy" state.

I too tried this recipe with pork & it was very good. The persimmons that I used were very ripe & worked wonderfully.

This works wonderfully with pork chops too! I didn't have sweet onions, so I used yellow onions and I left out the ginger. It was still delicious and was a great way to add a splash of color and flavor to dinner!

GREAT! Nice with pork chops too. The only addition I would note is that fully ripe persimmons are key--I'm not sure that 'firm-ripe' is necessarily best.

A simple, yet interesting, dish. The subtleness of the persimmon matched the flavor of the lamb well.
