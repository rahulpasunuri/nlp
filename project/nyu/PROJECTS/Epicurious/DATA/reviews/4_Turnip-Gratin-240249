I went against my better judgment and didn't peel the turnips. I'm sure this dish would have been good otherwise. It was too bitter and my turnips weren't over mature.

Almost Vegan version works too! Used non-hygrogenated margarine, soy creamer and we did use real parmesan. My Mom has high blood pressure so we need to be careful. It was absolutely delicious. There is a version of vegan parmesan if you want fully vegan using ground almonds.

I think this dish has good potential. I made the mistake of using salted butter. Together with the gruyere, it made the dish too salty. I also thought the gruyere made it more oily than it would have been with the drier cheese recommended. I did not find that the turnips were bitter at all, and thin slicing is the way to go (I just used a knife--the old fashioned way).

While some people have done the whole recipe in the oven, I ended up doing it all on the stove top and it also came out great. I had two "storage" turnips from my winter CSA, each over a pound, could barely tell that they were once white with a purple top. Considering their age and size I was concerned they would be bitter given what a few others have writtin, but in fact they were perfectly delicious in this dish and not at all bitter. Peeled and sliced turnips on a mandoline, hand grated some gruyere instead of parmesan (between the layers instead of putting it all on top as someone else suggested and far less than a full cup, which I think would overwhelm the turnip flavor), used 10-inch non-stick skillet and browned bottom uncovered (start checking after five minutes as it can brown quickly), then added the dairy, covered and cooked for less than 20 minutes (until liquid was absorbed). Forgot to turn on the oven, but I noticed that it was holding together like a potato galette, so I loosened it all the way around with my silicone spatula, inverted it onto a plate (tart tatin style), then slipped it off the plate and back into the pan so what was the top could brown as well. In ten minutes, I turned off the heat let it rest and slid it onto a serving plate. I stuck to the ingredients except for subbing less gruyere for all of the parmesan and using half milk and half heavy cream instead of all cream. Great combination of flavors--can't wait to make it again for friends.

This was so delicious and so easy. I used non fat evaporated milk instead of cream and skipped the cayenne. The turnips were very sweet and carmelized on the top. Yum!

This is a lovely way to use turnips...I made it as described, but without savory as I couldn't find fresh. I made it as a way to use turnips I had as part of our CSA - not a big turnip fan but this was very nice. I think it might work better with gruyere vice parmesan but in any case won't hesitate to make it again.

Delicious! Made a few modifications to the recipe - added layers of shredded carrot, used multiple kinds of turnips, substituted half-and-half for the heavy cream (it was still plenty rich) as others have suggested. Made these just like I would make potatoes au gratin, simply slice and add to a 13x9 glass pan in layers with the cheese and butter, and bake until nice and bubbly!

I love this dish, but two problems as written. You must be JUDICIOUS in your use of cayenne, or don't use it at all. It highlights the bitterness. I make it with a scant amount of cayenne on only one layer, and I think it would be delicious if one omitted the cayenne altogether. But the first time I made it I felt the cayenne destroyed the dish. Second, the initial cooking must be done uncovered to brown the bottom layer of turnips. I think it's a typo in the recipe to cook it covered before the cream is added.

I made some substitutions as well. The bottom layer were beets, followed by yellow/orange turnips, some potato and finally the white turnips. I received alot of complements. The juices from the beets rose up around my dish and made it very visually appealing. I also put mine in a 9 x 13 casserol dish (I had to increase the ingredients a bit). It was a hit.

Used another attachment for my food processor that sliced the turnips thinly in seconds flat. Like a previous reviewer, I also just stuck it in a glass dish and baked it and it came out delicious! Used half heavy cream and half milk. It was like potatoes au gratin, but with an onion-y sweet flavor that only turnips can bring.

Delish! Made a few modifications... used purple top turnips from my garden(peeled) and carrots, I don't have a mandoline so I just sliced them both as thin as I could; substituted dried oregano for the savory, used fresh thyme, light cream and only used about 1/2 cup cheese which was plenty - would definitely make again!

Ok, I know people get upset when users review modifications to the recipe, but the purists are going to have to get over it. Here's what happened. I had two LARGE turnips from my CSA box and wanted to use them. I misread the recipe and made this entirely in the oven in a le creuset enameled cast iron gratin dish. It turned out great. I also used half and half which turned out perfectly rich enough. And savory? Who has savory? I subbed fresh rosemary and dried oregano for this. The whole darn thing was delicious. I do think paperthin slices on the mandoline/v-slicer are CRITICAL to the success of the dish. This would not be as delicate or sublime with thicker slices.

I like veggies and this is a slam dunk four fork veggie side dish. I know others were concerned that their turnips were bitter. My dish was not bitter. I used a mixture of white turnips and scarlet turnips (from my CSA share). Made the dish almost exactly like it was written except that instead of heavy cream I used half & half and instead of savory I used dried marjoram. I would make this again in a heartbeat. I can't wait to eat the leftovers. The turnips tasted mild and sort of sweet and the parmesan on top added just the right touch.

For those who are worried about turnips being too bitter, try substituting carrots for about 1/3 of the turnips. (The added color is a bonus!)

Wow. The recipe was fine, but let me make a comment on turnips in case there's someone out there like me who's thinking about making this recipe to try turnips for the first time: Turnips are bitter! I couldn't even finish the portion I took. My wife finished hers, but the rest had to be thrown away.

Everyone loved this. I am growing turnips with a very strong flavor but the cream and cheese mellowed the flavor and everything married nicely. Thanks for this one.

oh my. i think i'm giving up on turnips for awhile after making this dish. i followed the recipe exactly, but found this to be overwhelmingly bitter.

I made this recipe pretty close to as instructed. I used fresh thyme and dried ground savory, in addition to the kosher salt and ground dried cayenne. Incase anyone is unsure about what kind of turnips to use, go with yellow - the smaller, purple top would be too mild. Also, I did NOT leave the skin on - I can't imagine not peeling turnips before eating them! Ideally I would like to rate this 2 1/2 forks instead of 3. I made this as a side dish on Thanksgiving. It was good as one side dish among many, but I'm not sure if it would stand alone well - not quite sure how I feel about the flavor combo in this dish. The combination of parmesan and turnips didn't immediately appeal to me, I decided to give it a try based on the high reviews. It was decent, but I did think my gut feeling was slightly right in that the combinatino of flavors was a bit odd/off. Honestly, none of my guests would have said this, however - people seemed to really like it, and helped themselves to seconds and thirds. It's possible I would make this again in the event of a big dinner like Thanksgiving. If I did, I'd probably try layering a little bit of cheese in the layers instead of all on top, or maybe even experiment with another kind of cheese, like a cheddar.

really great. didn't find savory...substituted fresh sage. the bottom did get quite burnt--i used a cast iron skillet and cooked for the maximum times in the recipe. so don't do that.

Nice change from potatoes, and spicyness went well with a honey-glazed pork loin. Couldn't find savory, so made mix of fresh sage & dried marjoram. Used 5% fleurette for lower fat content, and it was fine.

Definitely good, & a different take on the turnip. Although even shoe leather would probably taste good with all this cream and cheese! I served it with roasted salmon over a bed of lentils cooked with jalapeno, onion, & sun dried tomato, and did a slightly sweet orange vermouth sauce to drizzle over the salmon. The flavors were great together. If you have a well seasoned cast iron skillet, break it out for this gratin.

This is absolutely stunning. It has a hint of spicyness but one can still taste the sweetness of the turnips. Our kids loved it. Rich but worth the calorie splurge! We give it 10 forks, too!

Added in rhutabega with the turnips about half and half. Tasted absolutely amazing!

Peeled the turnips and followed the rest of the recipe exactly; was quite good but tasted better reheated.

This was also very good with celeriac in place of the turnips.

If I don't have a slicer, is it advisable to use a peeler to prepare the paper-thin parsnip?

I was also convinced that I hated turnips, but the picture in the October issue of Gourmet looked soooo good! I substituted sage for savory. It was what I had in the garden. Excellent. I think it would be great with a grilled rib eye.

Until I tried this recipe this past weekend I was convinced I hated turnips. I took a leap of faith and so glad I did. This is an excellent recipe and I give it 10 stars!

Nice change from the potato gratin, has a bit of a bite.
