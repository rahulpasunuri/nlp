I made a vegetarian version of the recipe as written using a veg stock. I thought it was really good--usually polenta recipes are a little bland for my taste, but this one delivered. Beware of oversalting it.

Great recipe. Followed the suggestions of Chef Dodson. BTW.....can we just boot yo-yo's from Epicurious, like Middlebourough, who completely change the recipe, and then say they don't like it? Aren't the forks supposed to be a reasonably FAIR review of a recipe, meaning that it was followed accurately the first time?? Lord, Have Mercy!!

Hello, I'm glad to hear some or most of you are enjoying this recipe! As the unnamed cook who worked under me stated the recipe did change over the course of years in the restaurant. Try this as your fix. 3/4 cup of polenta to every quart of cream (no stock) lighten up the gorg cheese and finish with fresh basil instead of rosemary. Keep cooking and enjoy!! Chef Dodson CCC

Yummy - pretty cheesy though!

I worked at the Blossom Deli under chef Bill Dodson. The recipe presented here is the originator for the restaurant but has changed. It includes equal amounts of liquid to cornmeal (polenta): heavy cream (no chicken stock), Chardonay or Chablis (depending on what is in stock), Blue or Stilton (not gorgonzola), and no rosemary. I have made both versions and both are good. This recipe is calling for the amount of gorgonzola equal to the restaurant's prep for 16 to 20 people. For best results, use about half the amount called for here. Oh, and dont forget to add the Salt and "White" pepper to taste DURING the final stages.

I could not readily find coarse corn meal, so I used the fine... I was careful to whisk in very slowly, but it was done instantly instead of having to thicken for 10 minutes! I also added about 1/2c more chicken broth, but that ended up being the remainder of the three cans I had to open anyway. Next time I will back off the garlic to one large clove. I thought it still needed a little something, so I added some cayenne pepper, delicious!

I like gorgonzola and think that it has its place in many recipes but perhaps not this one. I even cut back the amount called for (used 3/4) but even then the feedback was too rich, too strong. Def not a hit at my dinner table...

Someone needs to remove reviews like the one here, in which the cook changed so much about the recipe and *shockingly* didn't like it. how annoying

This was really good and pretty easy! I am a big fan of both gorgonzola and polenta so this made a fab dish with chicken. And a glass of white wine. mmm mm.

Instead of using gorgonzola in this recipe, I substituted parmesan (about 2/3 cup) and used heavy cream in place of whipping cream. It was creamy, filling and delicious! I would definitely make it again. Not only that, but after a night in the refrigerator it was great sauteed with a dash of olive oil to accompany soup.

This was not a success at my house, though I confess, I didn't follow recipe precisely, which is always a risk--used dried rosemary and cut in half, and reduced fat a bit, 1/2 & 1/2 and less of it. But I don't think that was a problem. Nobody liked the combination of strong cheese and herbs and corn. For me, plainer polenta has been more successful. I often make a polenta layered with cabbage, tomato, and sausage from feature on polenta in 3-00 Bon Appetit, which my whole family loves.

I served this as a side dish this past weekend to grilled steak. My guests liked it although they were first time polenta eaters. I loved the gorgonzola and rosemary combo and the leftovers were excellent as well. It was a nice change of pace to garlic mashed potatoes.
