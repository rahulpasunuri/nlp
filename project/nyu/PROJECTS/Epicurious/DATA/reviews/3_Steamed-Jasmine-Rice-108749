To the poster who thinks "Because it has ingredients, amounts & directions" something is a recipe, you are very wrong. An assemble it yourself piece of furniture from IKEA has all three of those as well, and it's not even edible, much less a recipe. I come to this esteemed(?) site for RECIPES. Not for back of box instructions. Any chance we can get an actual recipe for HOMEMADE jasmine rice?

I prefer the Temple of Thai recipe as it takes less time and tastes better.

Seriously- I did the math. How does rinse, bring to boil, cook 10-12 min, rest 5 equal 40 minutes. It took waaaay longer to cook than 12 minutes. When it was finally done it tasted good.

It was all right. Honestly, I omitted the salt and made it next time with an extra half cup of water, making it more like the sticky rice I love so much! I really love jasmine rice and this recipe is awesome with homemade, low fat, refried beans and a tomato mozzarella salad.

Ignore the bad reviews below. If you were looking for a main course, you would no sooner click on "Steamed Jasmine Rice" than you would order it in a restaurant as your entree. If you do, however, need to check the correct ratios, then you are as happy as I am that these basic hints are available here.

I agree with the other reviewers that it is helpful to know the exact rice and water measurement because I too have a bag of basmati rice (which I used instead of the jasmine)with no directions. I think the recipe actually calls for way too much salt, I would half the amount called for at least. That's why I only gave it 2 forks. I would make it again.

I agree with the others who commented that this is a worthy recipe to have on the site. I live in Tokyo and EVERY bag of rice is written in Japanese with no English. This recipe therefore, was a God-send as I would have had no other method to prepare my jasmine rice. So thanks heaps for including this. I will continue to return to this recipe.

Once you've washed the rice and soaked it for 15 minutes (this is critical to white rice), a reliable way to always get the correct ratio of water to rice is to lay your open hand on the surface of the rice in your pot, and add sufficient water to just cover the second knuckle of your middle finger. I was taught this by a prominent sushi chef while in Japan, and he said that this technique will always provide the correct proportion of water, no matter the amount of rice.

I found this recipe helpful as I had a huge bag of jasmine rice with no instructions. I was planning to make the rice my usual way but was glad I quickly looked up the recipe on this site as my rice turned out perfectly.

I think the other reviewers need to give this more credit. Yes, many bags of rice would say the exact same thing listed on them... But, for instance, I just bought a bag or rice from an asian market without a word of english on it. I couldn't remember the proportion of rice to water, so I found this helpful.

Are you kidding me?

How does this qualify as a recipe? Anyone who buys a package of jasmine rice will find these "cooking directions" on the box or bag. We expect more added value from Gourmet than something just a notch above "salted water for boiling."

Because it has ingredients, amounts & directions. Any more questions?
