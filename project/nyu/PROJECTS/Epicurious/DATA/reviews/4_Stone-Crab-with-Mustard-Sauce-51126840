The stone crab claws are cooked on the boat as soon as they are harvested. You can delicately steam them if you prefer your claws warm - the meat will come out easier if served chilled. These are locally available in Sarasota, FL - where we live and we enjoyed them yesterday for our Christmas dinner.

Hope the picture shown is not what the Chef calls Stone Crab, because in the state Fl. it is illegal to pass off Johna Crab (which those are) as Stone Crab.

Never cook stone crab, completely destroys the expensive meat. It is always sold cooked already. Steaming is how I believe it is done.

Any stone crab claws purchased retail, at a store or online, are cooked. Never cook the crab, completely trashes the not inexpensive meat.

Yes, the crab claws must be cooked first. Raw crab meat is yucky.
