OK, am I going crazy, I don't see the ingredients for the stuffing here anywhere except for the broth!?!

This was a big hit on Christmas Day. My whole family thought the stuffing was the best part - I only cooked a little bit in the pork and put the rest in a loaf pan, as directed. My husband says, "Any recipe for meat with a side of meat is okay by me!" I used Convection Roast and it got done over an hour earlier than called for. I just used a meat thermometer and it was perfect.

I forgot to say that it is essential to request that rib ends be frenched and ask the butcher if he's done one before. I spent an hour retying and frenching bones because I didn't choose the right butcher. I've done crown roast of pork many time with great success. So easy if butcher has done a good job.

Made this for 2006 Christmas dinner. Easy. Followed suggestions from another cook re: cooking on bed of apples - bad idea!!! The apples were burnt and no brown bits for the gravy. I used loose pork sausage (only 1 lb) and more bread (2 cups) to make it more stuffing consistency.

If it were possible to rate this recipe with fork buried in something unappetizing, I would!!! I have been an inveterate and enthusiastic subscriber of both Gourmet and Bon Appetit for years and years and was looking for something a little "different" for a holiday meal. This turned out to be NOT IT. What's with apple "stuffing?" This produces something like a loaf of very unappetizing "meatloaf" alongside a slab of pork. There wasn't even a way to make it look appealing ... whether scooped out from the center of the crown or from an inverted loaf pan and sliced! All in all, a very disappointing entree with nothing dazzling to redeem it. Sauce/gravy was very mundane and uninteresting. If crown roast was prepared by inexperienced butcher in back-water state, as was ours!, even more to grouse about. To bill this recipe with "stuffing" is a misnomer!!!! Yucko!!!!

This is a very easy recipe to make and very impressive to serve. Three things that are important: 1)Brine the pork for at least 12 hours. There is a recipe that someone else referred to that gave you great information about brining. It makes the meat juicy and luscious. 2) Cook the stuffing outside of the meat. You can better control temperature and texture of stuffing. 3)Cook port on a bed of sliced Granny Smith Apples. It helps to add flavor and adds more to the sauce at the end. I also poured Calvados on the pork and apples. All my guests loved this. And I ate leftover porkchops for days....YUM!

I made this for Christmas dinner and found it impossible to get the stuffing cooked without drying out the pork roast. We finally scooped the stuffing out into a separate dish so that the inside of the roast had a chance to cook. Despite these difficulties the end result was very tasty. I would make the stuffing again separately as a main dish.

We served this dish for Christmas Dinner and it was a big success. I did not use applejack brandy, but rather a budget brandy and the gravy was still lovely.

I have been making this recipe for 6 years and my family LOVES it, young & old. You can add or subtract from the stuffing but, the apples are great with the pork. The Cider gravy wraps it all up with a tasty bow. But, you should shop for the Applejack brandy early, the closer it gets to the holidays, the harder it is to get.

Rating: 3
What a hit! I pulled the roast out a bit earlier than noted - 145 degrees and it rose to temp during the resting stage with no trouble. Cider gravy was a smash hit for my family who is used to gravy made from powder in an envelope. I subbed another stuffing recipe (sausage, pecan, & cranberry stuffing recipe available on this site)and was thrilled with the result. Very showy at the table and bakes easily at the same temp as many of my other sides. Try it for a holiday meal!

This pork was excellent! By far the best recipe I have tried from this website to date. I made it for guests and everyone loved it. Only substitutions were sausage in the stuffing instead of groung pork, and packaged Arnold's stuffing flavored with sage as opposed to the breadcrumbs recommended. I also used almost a whole package of stuffing and had none left-over. All in all, a must try!

This recipe is fantastic. I made this for Christmas dinner one year to impress my future in-laws. Three generations of wife's family were WOW'd!!! The couldn't believe it wasn't professionally made. The stuffing is very rich, but I serve this with several sides, so the guests never mind. Very impressive, and absolutely delicious!!!

Made this for Easter dinner again(second time). I got rave reviews. The pork roast was not only elegant, but moist and delicious. The rub marinade is the key. The pork stuffing was very tasty and everyone enjoyed it. And the gravy made everything come together. This is a definite keeper, on the top of the list.

This is a fabulous recipe for entertaining. Made both pork & stuffing for my father's birthday. Didn't have time to marinade overnight - still fabulous. Either it was my oven or the roast, but it took around 40 minutes longer than expected to reach 155.....At suggested time, I removed the stuffing from the pork to make it cook faster & let it finish in another separate pan of stuffing. Wonderful!

Rating: 3
The top of the stuffing burned rather quickly. I think the next time that I make it, I'll cover the stuffing with foil for the first hour. I also like the idea of using real apples. Over all, it was a big hit on Christmass! My mother inlaw came back the morning after for leftovers to take home. This recipe made me a big hit! Thanks!

This is one of my husband's all-time favorite dishes. Whenever we decide to entertain, this is usually one of his first suggestions! A nice combination of textures and flavors, and the presentation is spectacular, too. The recipe is straight forward, and the meat is fairly forgiving, you can make it earlier in the day, and rewarm when ready, or serve at room temperature which make is a great choice for certain occasions such as a neighborhood "progressive dinner" which is what I am planning on using it for next weekend! A great classic recipe in my repetior. Enjoy!

Excellent. Everyone loved this recipe. I used a large loaf of bread and 4 apples. One cup of onions and 1 cup celery. I kept the rest of the ingredients the same. I moistened the bread with apple cider. I would definitely make this again.

Great recipe. Based on other reviews I skipped the dressing and made my own. But the pork and the cider gravy were outstanding! It is a keeper!

This was my first crown roast and I thought it made for an impressive presentation and was tasty- good and moist/tender. I skipped the stuffing part (made stovetop- gasp) so maybe this is the key to putting the dish over the top. Might try another recipe before doing this one again just to see if there's a big difference, but this one is good and worth making again.

I make this dish every year for Christmas. It is my all time favorite Bon Appetit Recipe.

Rating: 2
The stuffing is not stuffing; it is basically a meatloaf. It is a bit strange to eat pork with a side of pork meatloaf. Actually the recipe for the stuffing is more interesting than that for the pork, and either would probably best be served independently. Everyone liked it but it is not something I would serve together again, although some of the ideas for the stuffing would be useful to make a regular meatloaf (ie shallots, garlic and celery and the spices).

This has been in my recipe file for a long time and just made it for a dinner party. A make ahead tip: I roasted some inexpensive ribs early in the week and made a nice amount of gravy, stuck it in the freezer and did not have to mess with it before serving! The surprize was that the ribs were fab and we had them for dinner that night. All of my guests loved the roast, stuffing and gravy.

This is an incredible dish. Everyone LOVED it!! I made it exactly as written, with the apple cider gravy and the pork and apple stuffing. The stuffing could actualy be served as a main dish alone. I would definately make this again!

I made this for Christmas Dinner last year and it was a magnificent hit with the In-laws. Her grandparents were amazed, as were her parents, including her "nobody and nothing is good enough for my daughter" father. It is impressive without any further presentation, and was delicious with the stuffing and gravy. The chops alone were gone in a day after the neighbors heard about it and raided my refridgerator. This is in my top 3 special occasion recipes!!!

This was the highlight of our Christmas! I had dinner for 18 so I doubled everything and it was a visiual materpiece as well as delicious!! And it was very easy to prepare! Friends raved and there were no leftovers, these folks are high matinence eaters too! As I read those that did not like this recipe, I found that they altered it in the process, maybe that's why you didn't like it?

Everything about this PROJECT was worth it! The stuffing was a hit and if you side these wonderful flavors with nice fruit relishes (I made a curried peach chutney and a cranberry orange relish) you'll taste flavors in the meat that will tickle your palette. I garnished with crab apples and pears and fresh sage sprigs. Put the booties on the rib bones and voila! I guess I will have Christmas dinner at my house again next year...Everyone is expecting this Crown Roast again. Print it and save it and pass it on. It's a sure bet.

I LOVED this dish and so did all the guests for Christmas dinner this year. It looks fabulous coming to the table. The gravy was wonderful! The stuffing was great -- I mixed 1/2 and 1/2 pork sausage and ground pork and added half a bag of stuffing bread cubes instead of the bread crumbs to help lighten it a bit. I served this with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed breen beans and carrots. This is a keeper for special occasions.

Made this for New Year's Eve. Based on some of the previous comments about lack of taste, I added 2 tsp minced garlic and 1 tsp chopped rosemary to the rub. The roast came out perfectly. Made apple stuffing (from this site) instead of the one listed. It was delicious.

I made this for Christmas dinner. I did not use the stuffing recipe. ( I used an apple stuffing recipe that I found on this site.) I was disappointed with the result. The meat was very good but the gravy was not. I agree that it was too runny and in my haste to thicken it up I may have added too much corn starch which might have zapped the flavor from it. I will try the roast that goes with the apple stuffing next time.

A big hit for Christmas dinner. Gravy was a bit thin, added one more teaspoon of cornstarch then it was perfect!

A disappointing Christmas dish. Made the pork exactly as written, the meat was good, but the spice rub added nothing. I made the stuffing in a pie pan (not loaf pan as suggested) and cut it into wedges-I was turned off by the meat loaf like texture. Did not make the gravy. Overall, I thought the dish lacked a complexity of flavors. I don't know if the gravy would have helped. By the way, the family liked it, but I think they were being nice or I'm too much of a critic of my own cooking.

This is a truely amazing dish! My family said it was the best Pork Crown Roast they had ever had! They especially loved the Apple Cider Gravy! I altered the recipe to the Apple and Pork Stuffing though. I eliminated the eggs, and added a box of wild rice. I used 2 packages of sausage with sage, and cooked the sausage with the shallots and celery to make sure the sausage was totally cooked, and I did not stuff the roast. I cooked the stuffing on the side. I wanted to make sure the roast cooked thoroughly in the center as well. I also used 1 box of stuffing mix instead of one cup. It turned out light and fluffy, and was not as heavy and meatloaf like as other readers had reported. I served it with skillet-glazed baby carrots and snow peas and scalloped potatoes, other recipes from this site. I will make this roast again!

This is a wonderful dish. It is so easy even a beginner could do this and impress anyone. I made it last year(2000) for New Years Day. I just made it again for a dinnner party. Everyone raved. I love the stuffing and the gravy. This will be a fall staple of us.

I made this recipe Christmas Day, 2000 and it was such a hit that my family requested that I make it again this year...which I am. The meat came out perfect and was simple to prepare...(don't forget the rub). This year I'm making it with a wild rice stuffing. Mangia!

This Christmas was my first try at a crown roast. My butcher recommended not to stuff it but I decided to go with the recipe's recommendation to do so. I would make the stuffing separately next time; stuffing it prevents the inside of the crown from getting crispy, and the internal temp. of the stuffing takes longer to reach 160. This stuffing recipe is heavy on ground pork, which my family was not accustomed to - next time I would do a bread based stuffing with sausage, perhaps. Using a thermometer is key with this - it took only two hours in my oven to for the roast to reach 170. Even though it was not dry, it was probably fully cooked in an hour and 45 minutes.

I made this for a New Year's Eve Dinner Party for fourteen guests. It was wonderful! Of course, I used a larger roast. I also changed the dressing recipe. I used cooked, crumbled and drained Bob Evan's Sage Sausage in the dressing rather than the raw pork. Approximately an hour before the roast was done, I removed all but a little of the pan drippings, stuffed the roast and continued to bake until the dressing was cooked and the roast had reached temperature. I'll definitely make this again, particularly when feeding a large crowd -- it was trouble free and inexpensive.

I used the spice rub on a plain pork rib roast which was very good--watch the cooking time, though! I used a meat thermometer so didn't dry out the roast. Also substituted the sausage and chestnut stuffing from another crown pork roast recipe at Epicurious which was wonderful.

I made a different Crown Pork recipe from the FabulousFoods website. The 2 recipes were similar but I didn't like the ground pork in this one. As it turned out the 'other' stuffing recipe was too bland and next time I will try this one. I made the Cider Gravy recipe and really liked it. It definetly compliments the pork and is worth the effort. I served the roast with Potato, Celery Root, & Jerusalem Artichoke Puree and Green Beans with Roasted Onions both from this website.

I used a boneless pork loin. Because the stuffing does resemble meat loaf, I am going to try to butterfly the boneless loin next time and roll with the stuffing and see how that works. The stuffing is very tasty. I didn't have cider for the gravy so I used apple juice. I think it worked as a good substitution.

It was splendid and sooooo elegant and soooooo easy. I took the recommendation of another reviewer and made my own dressing recipe with prunes, apricots, dried cranberries and raisins and it was perfect. Served it with Endive, Pear and Stilton Salad, Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes, Sweet and Sour Red Cabbage and Fennel and Sweet Potato Soup -- all Epicurious Recipes. Topped it off with Vanilla Creme Brulee and the Harvest Tart -- even more Epicurious Recipes. Our guests were thrilled. Fabulous dinner.

We cooked for the entire clan for Christmas and this elegant dish received rave reviews from each family generation. While it is somewhat time-consuming and cumbersome to prepare, it is clearly a hands-down "winner" for that special occasion meal. Shopping for the ingredients is an added adventure. Coupled with an artful presentation and a full-bodied red wine, we may "institutionalize" this recipe as part of our standard Holiday regimen !

Absolutely delicious! I made the crown roast (first time for me) and red cabbage/fennel side dish for Christmas dinner with friends. It was the biggest holiday hit to date...Here's proof that holiday mishaps don't have to dampen spirits: Upon embarking on cooking on Christmas morn, I realized that I had forgotten to buy ground pork for the stuffing--a key ingredient. After foraging through the refrigerator and freezer, my husband and I decided to try substituting the wild boar sausage given to us as a gift by a game-hunter friend. It worked!!! The stuffing was devoured by all. We started the meal with a simple green salad and added mashed sweet potatoes with balsamic glaze (from Union Square Cafe cookbook). Home-made apple sauce would also have been a great addition.

I tried this recipe for Christmas, using a 22 rib roast (12.5 lbs.),figuring 2 ribs per person. Although a little skeptical about the 155 degrees recommended, I pushed it to 170 degrees, and it still turned out to be the most tender piece of pork I've ever had. I'll try it again for a smaller crowd, but I think I'll use real apples instead of the dried ones, as they were a bit rubbery. Awesome recipe, very easy, and a stunning display.

This tasty dish was quite simple to make and presented beautifully. When making the dressing, add the broth required a very small amount at a time - it took only a few tbsps. to adequately moisten the dressing for mine. Although the dressing cooked in the roast adds flavour, I put the bulk of mine in a pan and this was terrific as it sliced and served beautifully. Enjoy!

The pork itself was wonderful. I added more bread crumbs to the stuffing to reduce the "meaty-ness" of it. Unfortunately, even with the additional bread, the stuffing did NOT adequately feed 12 persons. I would make an extra side dish next time.

This was delicious! Easy to make, impressive to view. A few comments: 1) I substituted bread cubes for bread crumbs based on other reviews that said the stuffing tasted too much like meat loaf. It worked great. 2) My roast cooked in less than 2 hours (it had 16 ribs and I used an internal oven thermometer so it wasn't the oven temp). Fortunately I was keeping an eye on the meat thermometer and was able to take the roast out of the oven for 30 minutes and finished cooking it when I was ready to serve the main course. Would definately make this again.

loved this recipe, i agree with other comments and appreciate the input form others that the stuffing would have been too heavy. i lessened the ground pork and only used one egg. one comment thought, it seems that for an 8 lb roast the cooking time should be extended to 20-25 min per pound. wonderful recipe!!!!

I prepared this for Christmas. The taste to me was grandiose pork chops. The stuffing was very much like meatloaf.

However, it truly is a matter of personal taste, because my family loved it.

I'd never done a crown roast before either but it was easy, delicious, and made 10 people happy. Don't let the length of the ingredients list and recipe scare you. My butcher suggested pork loin instead of crown roast because he said it was as good a cut at about a third of the cost. Using a meat thermometer, it came out perfectly tender. Skin or at least fat on the outside is a real bonus.

I would definitely make the crown roast again. This was my first crown raost and it turned out beautifully. I was proud to serve this to my company -- and they aren't a crowd that's easy to please! I would not, however, make this stuffing again. It's more like a pork meatloaf than a true bread stuffing, and I found it to be too much meat for one meal. Also, the flavor of the stuffing was odd due to the combination of ingredients.

The approximate cooking times are way too short! This held up my family dinnerfor an hour and a half on Christmas Day. (And my roast was a 7.8 pound, 12-bone roast -- so it wasn't that my roast was too big.) The results were delicious, but this was a bad time to be led astray by a recipe.
