I have been making recipes from Epicurious for several years and have only now been moved to write a review. I just made this corn recipe tonight (along with a different Epicurious recipe for grilled pork tenderloin), and I think this creamed corn may be the best recipe I've ever made from Epicurious. It may be one of the best things I've ever made. Of course, it's corn season and the corn was fresh. I also only blanched the first batch of corn really quickly. But I was amazed at how good this creamed corn was. And my husband and son both agreed that it was fabulous, and gobbled it up. Highly recommend.

I was extremely disappointed with the overall recipe. The only reason I gave it 2 forks was because the pork itself was good with the mint-rosemary marinade. However the rest of the recipe was terrible. The Creamed Corn was bland and tasteless (it might have to do with the fact that it doesn't call for salt or pepper which I added trying to bring out some flavor), and I had to throw it away, and substituted with Wild Rice. The chutney was just OK. The vinegar was so strong I had to counter it with a half a can of Coke (it actually worked pretty well). There are much better recipes for apple chutney in epicurious. Conclusion: I will makethe pork with the marinade, bt will NOT make the Creamed Corn, and will use another chutney recipe in the future.

It came out a lot better than I expected. Marinated it for 2 days and it made a lot of differece. Added some fresh ginger to the mint/rosemary mariande, and it gave it an additional tangines. The vinegar and sugar reduction took forever as I had doubled the quantities to make more; doing it a couple of days ahead of time makes it taste a lot better. I'll make it again for sure.

used one pint half and half for 6C frozen corn and it was delicious and thick and creamy.

And, the chutney is delicious and such a great compliment to this dish! I used 2 apples (one green granny smith apple, one gala) and used 3/4C apple cider vinegar and 1/2C sugar. didn't quite get thick after boiling for at least 15 min so I went ahead and added the rest of the ingredients anyway. Simmered for a long time until all the juices were gone and it was superb.

Brine the pork first for at least an hour in a mixture of approx 1/2 C salt, 1/2 C sugar and 1 Quart water (can find a "proper" recipe on this website, if desired and yes, it is a lot of salt!). Rinse and pat dry and then follow recipe with the marinade. None of the flavors are overwhelming but rather, it cooks up all very nicely flavored. Great with the creamed corn and also with Cauliflower Puree (also on this website)

Amazing!!! The combination of the corn and the chutney with the pork was delicious. I do not like canned creamed corn at all but this home made version was yummy. It was rich so I might try lower fat cream next time. I also used less than half the sugar in the chutney and it was delicous and tart. The best part is you can make this all the day before and get the whole meal ready in a matter of minutes. The leftover pork is also to die for cold. This recipe is a keeper.

The entire thing was fantastic. The pork marinade had a great aroma and I could clearly pick up the flavors after roasting. The cream corn was to die for, though I added salt. So much better than canned. I made it the night before. The apple-raisin chutney was truly the star of the evening though. I made it the morning before. It was almost too hot by itself but when combined with bites of pork - devine! I made no changes to the recipe, though the pork cooked longer than directed to reach 145 (who cooks pork to 180 these days?). I will definitely make this again and have no plans to change it up.

I forgot to say--serve on warmed plates as the cream corn cools quickly. Also I cut the tenderloin into generous medaillons, either before marinating--if I remember or atleast before pan searing. Then into the 400f oven for 8-10 minutes. Perfect. The rosemary mint pork leftovers are excellent later, straight from the frig.

Viva Seabrook Island! I do use fat-free half+half--this makes Low Country cuisine in our every day low-fat range! If making the creamed corn to serve with a different entree give it a few grinds of pepper (and a bit of salt if using homemade no-salt broth.) Preparing this recipe ahead of time (right up to putting the tenderloin in the oven) and you can sit down to eat 20 minutes after walking in the door. oh, I also prefer the chutney with only half the sugar.

Delicious recipe. Appreciated the notes on cooking time for the pork. I substituted cranberries for the raisins and half a teaspoon of chili garlic sauce for the red pepper in the chutney. I also cut the whole recipe in half and only used half a cup of sugar, still plenty. My husband, the chef, loved it.

Fantastic combination. I brined the tenderloins (1/4 cup ea. salt and sugar in a quart of water for about an hour) and omitted salt from the marinade. It makes a big difference in the roasting time if the meat is room temp. to start. I used frozen corn (January) and didn't bother to cook the extra cup before adding it at the end. Everyone LOVED the corn and pork. The recipe makes a ton of chutney, seems like it would be easy to halve it. Takes way longer than 15 minutes to reduce to 1-1/2 cups. Really special combination of flavors, I'll happily make this again.

The pork was fantastic, tender and juicy. I used a little more garlic and marinated it from Friday (4:00 am )to Sunday eve (6:00pm). I cooked it for 20 minutes in a regular oven and rested it for 10 minutes. For the corn, I used 5 cups thawed frozen white corn and added some salt to the onions and again used extra garlic. I did not have enough heavy cream (only 1 cup) so I added 1/2 cup 1% milk and a couple of large spoonfuls of Trader Joe's crème fraîche. I used my KA stick blender to puree and then added the last cup of thawed frozen corn. I will make it using the crème fraîche again. I think it added nicely to the flavor. We reheated some in the microwave for seconds and it was just as good as the freshly made. I also made the chutney and wrote about that recipe there.

My husband and I both devoured this dish. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins in the chutney, which gave it a nice tang and a festive colour. I was glad I read the other reviews and knew that the pork would take longer than 10 minutes to roast - mine took about half an hour.

Excellent - with the following changes/suggestions-- I used fat free half and half and half the amount of the sugar in the chutney. Also, the pork cooking time was at least twice the amount suggested. A real winner!

This is WONDERFUL! I am not usually a fan of creamed corn, but this was delicious. The pork was exquisite. I marinated it for about 8 hours, and it roasted juicy and tender. The chutney I made a day ahead to let the flavors meld, and I'm glad I did. The only change I made to the recipes were to sub fat free half and half for the whipping cream in the creamed corn, and about 1/3 cup chopped onion for the shallots in the chutney, as I couldn't find any. Also, used a stick blender in the pot for the corn, rather than transferring it back and forth between pot and food processor - MUCH eaiser. I got a "Wow!" from my spouse, and that doesn't happen often. Our dinner guests were even more impressed. This is a keeper!

We made this dinner for my husband's parents and it was a knockout! The special thing about this dish is the homemade cream corn - absolutely delicious and worth the extra work. You'll likely have some left over but don't worry, it won't last long.

I only made the creamed corn. First, my gosh it made a ton. It was too rich for my blood - which is saying something if you noticed my username! Next time, I'll make the roast and the chutney and pair it with some nice root veggies!

I have made this recipe twice in the last 2 weeks and it's delicous! I marinated the pork 24 hrs each time and the flavor was amazing. I didn't reduce the sugar in the apple raisin chutney and didn't find it too sweet. I haven't made the creamed corn yet but I will try it next time. The pork is really tender and juicy from browning it in the pan. Fantastic recipe!

This turned out wonderfully well. Thanks to the advice from all of you, I cut the amount of sugar by 2/3 and it turned out just right. I made this for two people and cut every ingrediant in half.Now I wish I had made the chutney for four or more people. It was that good.

I love to cook pork tenderloin and this was one of the best recipes yet!

This recipe is a basic guideline that can be enhanced. The pork should be marinated atleast 4 hours if not longer. I follewed tha advice of another by roasting the pork for 10 mins and then broiling for the last 5 mins. remove from oven and place on a plate and let sit covered with foil for 7 mins, then slice. I did not make the apple raisin chutney as that i have a wonderful green tomato chutney I made instead, which complimented the flavors perfectly. The cream corn is great if made a day in advance and with the addition of salt and pepper, feel free to add more garlic or onion, I did. Overall, I would make again, good basic meal.

I agree with four forks. But I did use only 1/4 of the sugar. I used more fruit like sugar cranberries, grapes, apples, raisins, peaches and a onion. Next time I will use no sugar, and add a little splenda instead. The pork turned out fine. I did not take time for the cream corn. Next time.

Served this for Easter dinner-fabulous results. I used a 6 pound pork loin and rotissed on bbq for l hour 15 minutes, let sit for 15 minutes and sliced. The chutney was a great addition, I will cut down the sugar to l-l/2 cups next time. We had a housefull and raves were given to both pork and chutney. We didn't make the creamed corn. Can't wait to make this dish again.

I've only made this dish once, because it's a bit labor-intensive, but it was well worth the effort. The combination of flavors is well balanced, the pork comes out juicy and tender. There is the smooth sweetness of the corn, and the tartness of the chutney. A wonderful dish.

A wonderful combination of flavors and textures. The pork is tender and juicy from being pan seared and the fresh herbs provide not only a delectable aroma, but also a fresh, flavorful taste. The cream corn is better than anything you've ever had out of a can and the chutney is what makes this dish so delicious. I suggest doubling the chutney so that you have plenty of leftovers -- would be great on chicken or fish. This dish makes a very elegant presentation for guests.

I make this recipe all the time and I make it ahead by freezing tenderloin halves in the marinade. From the fridge, the tenderloins take about 20 minutes to roast. I don't make the corn but the chutney is great.

The recipe is very good, pork is cooked to perfection; don't overcook. I marinated the pork overnight and was perfect. The corn is a little bland, would add some salt and jalapeno to lift it up a little.

This is a great marinade recipe and a great creamed corn recipe, however when you put the 2 together a little bland for me. (My husband loved it.) Next time I will add something to the creamed corn, not sure what, but it needed something else.

Rating: 4
This recipes is great! The flavours are wonderful. The pork was cooked to perfection and the creamed corm and chutney were the perfect accents. I added a little salt and some pepper to the creamed corn and served some steamed Jasmine rice along side with some long green beans also steamed. My 4 year old devoured his plate which was an added bonus.

We loved the marinade. Cooked the pork on the grill on high to brown and then on low to finish, relying on the meat thermometer. We should have taken it out a tad before it reached 150 degrees as it did continue to cook; however it was very tasty. The creamed corn was not as special as I had hoped. I'd rather pour 2 cups of whipping cream into something more intresting. The chutney was good, but I added fresh ginger, used less sugar and more lemon.

Rave reviews for our Christmas dinner with this entree. I skipped the creamed corn altogether and I don't think we missed a thing. The pork was flavorful and tender. I had to roast for longer than the 10 minutes as suggested by other cooks, pulled the pork out of oven at 155 degrees, let it set 10 min-perfect.!

Rating: 3
The pork was absolutely to die for. I broiled it for 5 minutes...and then cooked it at 400 for the last 5 minutes and couldn't believe how well it turned out. The chutney seemed a little too acidic, even after I added the all of the sugar (which I was initially not intending to)...any suggestions on perfecting it? The pork was truly wonderful, I definitely recommend broiling for part of the time.

This is a favorite in our household. The other reviews are correct about the cooking time. We enjoy the apple chutney very much with this dish.

The pork and the creamed corn were delicious,and although good,the apple chutney reminded me of the mincemeat that you can buy in a jar.

This is a definite 10 on the Richter scale!!! My husband is still talking about it. I followed Florida's advise (roasted 20 min. to 150, rested 5-10 min.). I'd like to know where Adams, TN gets his canned corn...I thought this recipe was very easy and a major step up from runny canned stuff. Can't wait to try it again!

I made this with the addition of chili powder, and I used ground cumin. I followed the advise of putting oil on the meat before dredging it in the cornmeal, seared it, and it had a nice brownish crust. I made the chutney, and it was a hit as well. I plan to make it again, when the leftovers are gone.

As other posters have noted, no way will the internal temperature of the pork reach 180 degrees in 10 minutes. I generally roast for 20 minutes to reach 150-155 degrees, then let set for 5 minutes to raise the temp and re-distribute the juices.Perhaps because this is a restaurant recipe, the commercial oven makes the difference.

The flavor of the mint and rosemary is delicious. The proportions of this recipe seem to be off as the temperature and time it takes to cook. Half the apples, apple cider vinegar, and you'll be better off. Cook all the corn together and blend it less to have the bigger chunks. Save yourself the trouble. It tastes and looks the same. The apple and raisin combination is delicious. Try adding some rum too.

I have made this dish several times and it is now part of my regular repetoire. The pork is delicious although it will be overcooked if you wait until it reaches 180. I usually remove mine at 155 and let it sit covered for 10 minutes or so. I use frozen corn for the creamed corn. I do not precook a cup of corn. I simply hold out a cup and add it (defrosted) towards the end. This cuts the prep time and gives a nice crunch to all that creamy corn. A mid-week winner.

This was o.k but nithing special, I found the chutney too sweet and the corn, for all the work of removing the kernels etc was very similar to the canned vatiety of creamed corn..the pork itself was very tasty.

Warning! Cooking anything until it registers 180 degrees is a recipe for disaster. I would cook this pork until it registered 145-150 max.
