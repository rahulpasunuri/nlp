Outstanding! All six family members agreed it was the best lamb recipe they had ever had. Got the lamb chops from CostCo and they were very tender. But the taste was over the top. I hesitated to use spices so strong and in such large quantity but after the chops were grilled it did not overpower the meat or make it too spicy. In fact there was absolutely none of the muttony taste you often get. This will be my go-to recipe for chops from now on!

These were delicious chops! I cut up a french- cut rack of lamb into individual chops, rubbed each one and let it marinate for about 5 hours. The taste was great, but the texture was delicious. Perfectly cooked using this method on our charcoal grill.

We love this receipe. I've made it many times with slight variations to the mixture of the dry rub. I usually add rosemary as well and put mre sugar. dont even need to let it sit for so long after you put on the rub

My family and I were not crazy about this recipe. It was OK, but we much prefer plain old garlic salt on the chops prior to grilling.

I have tried this rub with different types of lamb from baby chops to a butterflied leg and even on a cheap shoulder cut. Every single time my husband was gushing over it. One of the best dry rubs I've ever had.

This rub is as efficacious on chops as on ribs. Medium-rare to rare is the best. The jelly is always forgotten, however rice or couscous works well as do grilled vegetables, drizzled with oil and "herbs du pantry". Those who do not normally eat lamb, have licked their fingers and taken seconds (& thirds) of this dish.

The rub is wonderful. I used loin chops instead of rib, just a matter of choice. I just realized that I forgot to serve the pepper jelly. Oh well there is always next time. Served with Baked Yams with Cinnamon-Chili Butter and a veggie. Try this one !

I used pasilla powder instead of chili and also used this for a leg of lamb. Grilled it on the Big Green Egg by searing both sides and then moving it to a cooler side on grill and cooking 10 minutes per pound. A keeper, for sure!

I used pasilla instead of chili powder and it was very tasty. Of course I was not going out on a limb by switching.I grilled it on the Big Green Egg by searing both sides and then moving it aside to a cooler spot and cooking it 10 minutes per pound. Definitely a keeper.

Wonderful recipe! I only had half an hour to marinate the lamb and it was still delicious. Perfect for a flavourful weeknight dinner with minimum effort. Definitely a keeper.

Fantastic! The flavors are complex and tantalizing. This is the recipe I have been looking for! I tried the rosemary garlic recipes on this site and was not impressed. My husband, son and I were licking our fingers. I did make two small changes - I substituted five spice powder for the allspice and added some red pepper flakes for extra spice. Delicious!

For those who like spicy lamb, this is a great recipe. Very easy to prepare--you just have to the spices and rub them in several hours ahead (or preferably, the night before). Great for company, as it is flavorful, and virtually no work--just throw it on the grill when its time to serve dinner!
