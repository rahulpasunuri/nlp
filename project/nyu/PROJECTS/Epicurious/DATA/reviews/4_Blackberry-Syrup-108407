I was looking for a syrup recipe that would be good over pancakes. This one was delicious but a little too runny. I added 2 tbsp of cornstarch and cooked for 45 minutes, to thicken it up a bit, and it turned out perfect.

This syrup was so rich and delicious, the color was beautiful and it was perfect on my white chocolate cheesecake!

Simple and special! It tastes like blackberry pie over vanilla ice cream. Our cooking club raved.
