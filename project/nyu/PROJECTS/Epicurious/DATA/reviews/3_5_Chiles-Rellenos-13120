I have recently discovered the gas grill for roasting the chiles. It does a very nice job because it gets really hot. Poblanos or Anchos create fewer problems with the chile tearing because they have a nice thick flesh. I like the flavor better too. For a salsa I recommend El Pato enchilada sauce. It has a nice deep flavor and is really cheap.

Made a half recipe tonight with the first poblanos of the season from our garden. I thought it w the recipe as written except i did take out the seeds (don't like that texture) and i used a Mexican cheese blend to stuff. Also used vegetable oil to fry. No cheese escaped, and these tasted great. My husband liked them, but suggested they need a little sauce. Maybe it is time for me to do a little research into authentic Mexican cooking to see what i can find. Good recipe, i liked it and would make these again.

I love chile rellenos so much that I order them pretty much every time I eat out at a Mexican restaurant. I felt like it was a lot of work to produce such flat, forgettable chiles, though--I think I'll keep making creative tacos at home and ordering rellenos out at restaurants. But I appreciate everyone's reviews and suggestions--huge help!

Delish! Beat the egg whites stiff, stir in the yokes. I used Anaheim Peppers, roasted over my gas range. Just put them in a paper bag until cool, then peel off skin. I used fresh Montery Jack cheese inside, then added a salsa fresca and a dab of sour cream after frying in oil. I did not use any kind of skewer. The egg coating was enough to hold the cheese in for the short time in the hot oil. Thank you for this great recipe, it is a keeper and I will make often!

This was a wonderful dish. I made this for my partner at work and she was amazed. I used a "Mexican cheese blend" instead of cheddar and it turned out great.

We used Anaheims and started following the directions exactly as written, but made the mistake of reading all of the reviews where people were freaking out about the chiles staying together. We panicked for a moment, but stayed resolute, used common sense, and it worked out perfectly. We DID NOT use any toothpicks, skewers, or freezing tricks. We simply didn't overstuff the chiles with cheese. Regarding whether to deseed, if you like it spicy, keep them in. If not, take them out (with the white stuff). As for the cheese, we used cheddar and it tasted great. Queso blanco probably would have been good, too, but let's face it, the cheddar and queso blanco people will use for this isn't that fancy. If the queso blanco isn't easy to get (if you live in Minnesota, for example), the cheddar is nice. In other words, it doesn't matter. Oh yeah, we used plain old vegetable oil instead of shortening and cooked over medium flame, ignoring the thermometer issue. I drank bottled Heineken with it and found the whole experience very enjoyable.

People are down on this recipe because of its inauthenticity, but I think the procedure is right-- the only thing wrong is the cheese. Instead of cheddar I used queso fresco. Also, I got this tip from a pro chef friend: After dredging in flour but before dipping in egg, freeze the stuffed chiles for at least 45 min. This makes them easy to fry without losing the stuffing or resorting to toothpicks.

the other reviews really helped, especially the one from the reviewer from new mexico. we used only queso fresco, added cumin to the flour for dredging, opened the chiles from the stem end (did not cut a slit), used toothpicks to keep them closed, and heated in the oven at 300 for a bit. they stayed closed and were tasty! we thought the recipe worked well given we were making chile rellenos for the first time...

To the cook from San Antonio Del Mar... the recipe says to keep the seeds in only during the roasting, then you discard the seeds.

Rating: 0
Better with jack cheese or mozzarela, also try mixing in mashed potatoes, cut cheese in strips, mashed potatoes will hold the chile together and you won't need toothpicks to try to hold it together. Also easier to cut the stem out and insert ingredients through there, better tasted if salsa is homemade, search for salsa de tomate, sauce should be thin, almost clear, but red.

I found that this recipe was very easy to prepare. I love this dish and now that I found this recipe I do not have to go out to eat them, I can prepare them at home. My husband really enjoyed them. I used the chedder cheese and liked it, I did use one of the other viewer's comment on placing them in the over at 300 degress for 10 minute and they stayed crisp and that is the way I like them. I also added my own flavor to them by cooking up hamburger meat with onions, mexican spices added it to a cheese sauce. I then placed it over the Chili Rellenos. It only added to the flavor.

I have always loved this dish and recently tried to replicate after I had an especially fantastic version at Bonita, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Like everyone else, I thought this recipe needed some adjustments. I also changed the cheese to mostly Queso Blanco. Since I too find it a bit salty, I used about 1/2 Queso Blanco, 1/4 mild cheddar and 1/4 Pepper Jack, which gives the filling a little kick. I stuffed the roasted, peeled and seedless pobalnos with the cheese mixture and closed them with skewers (I was out of toothpicks) and dredged them in seasoned flour (salt, pepper, dash of cumin gives it an inhertently Mexican flavor). I also created a seperate dunking batter of 1 egg beaten vigorously with about 1/2 cup of milk for every 2 peppers (we cut the recipe by 1/4, since there's only 2 of us.) I browned them in a pan (with 1 tbsp butter) gently, for about 5 minutes, but I also noticed that peppers would start to fall apart way before the cheese had melted. I have found the way around this is to stick the pan (as is) in the oven for 10 minutes at 300. It keeps the outside crisp and melts the cheese perfectly. I made an adobo/chipotle/tomato sauce to go over the peppers, which went perfectly with their smoky flavor. A couple spoons of it over each pepper, and served them over some long grain rice. I've made it twice in the last month and we're addicted.

As a hint to the cook that found queso fresco too salty: If possible, find another brand. It shouldn't be salty. Also, to keep the cheese from overpowering the entire dish, I often add sauteed mushrooms to the cheese, it gets raves from my Mexican friends. And I would go with firm peaks, not necessarily really stiff. Once you fold in the yolks, the batter should stick with no problem at all. Definitely close your chiles with something to keep the cheese from leaking out.

This is so far from authentic as to be ridiculous. Leave the SEEDS IN the chiles?? The author is on crack! Also, for rellenos, the egg whites need to be beaten to firm peaks, not just until frothy! Cheddar cheese is an abomination in this dish. If you can't find queso fresco, use Monterey Jack or fresh mozzarella. Also, rellenos are generally served in a tomato sauce, not just plain. Seal the cut edges of the chiles with toothpicks or skewers before dredging or you're going to have spitting oil all over your kitchen. Very poor recipe.

I have to disagree about this recipe being easy. I have tried it 3x now and each time it's disappointing. It tastes good, but the peppers always fall apart. I tried different peppers, maybe I just cooked them too long. I tried beating the egg whites until stiff as one reviewer suggested--didn't like it when I tried it because it was too hard to coat the peppers, but after trying the way described in the recipe, I think stiff is the way to go. I tried queso fresca -- way too salty. Just now, I used a combination of a brie-like soft cheese and a mild goat cheese from Spain -- that was really good. I blended them together in the food processor and that was good because I could roll the cheese into a tube and not worry about it falling out when the peppers ripped. I also tried the rice recommended by one reviewer. That was the best part. I love chile rellenos, but I might have to just settle for the restaurant ones. I may try one more time, but I am not hopeful.

I have to agree witht he cook from San Antonio del Mar, Mexico. That's EXACTLY how we make chiles rellenos in our home, except, after I fry the stuffed chiles that have been dipped in the batter, I set them aside, AND, IN THE SAME OIL I used for frying the peppers, I toss in about 1/2 c. sliced white onion, saute, then add the tomato sauce, let that cook through a bit, then add the chiles back in to heat them back up. I serve immediately with the sauce. It's important to use that same oil because it has already picked up the flavor of the chiles, and some of the egg batter will also be left over in the pan, which just adds to the sauce. In fact, a lady I know from Mexico City, adds FRIED EGG the tomato sauce before pouring it over the chiles. Try it!

I added shredded cooked chicken to this for a main dish. Substituted crumbled goat cheese for chedder. Served it on top of a chunky roasted tomato sauce. This dish was a big hit.

These are really wonderful...I added corn to the cheese and enhanced it a bit. Good idea to keep seed head in tact because otherwise the peppers lose their shape. I love the fluffiness of the batter. It might be interesting to try a baked version of these somehow.

I have tried many chile relleno recipes over the years. This is by FAR the best one. They were absolutely delicious! I did substitute queso blanco cheese for the cheddar. I'm planning on making this recipe for two more parties in the next week!

Sorry, the chiles are supposed to be seeded. You should also dredge the chiles in flour before battering and close your chiles with toothpicks to prevent leaking. The egg whites should be beaten until stiff, then the lightly beaten yolks stirred in, not folded in. The batter will hold for about 15 minutes tops, so combine the eggs just before frying. Cheese: more traditional tasting would be perhaps a goat cheese or FRESH mozarella. If you have a Mexican cheese section in your market, use Queso Fresco, Adobera, Queso Quesadilla or Oaxaca. Here I use fresco, panela or adobera, or a combination of the above. Also, salsa is not the traditional accompaniament, tomato sauce is. You can whip one up in 10 minutes using Muir Glen Fire Roasted Tomatoes, about 1/2 an onion, 2-3 cloves garlic, pinch of cumin, thyme, s&p, blended then fried in a tb of oil for 5 minutes. Thin with a bit of chicken stock if necessary, but I never do. NO chile in the sauce, it's redundant. If you like super spicy, pass the bottled hot sauce. I've never seen cheese melted on top of a chile relleno EVER in the 15 years I've lived and travelled all over Mexico. Where do people get these ideas?

Rating: 3
This dish was tasty, but is a little time consuming if you roast the chiles yourself. Next time I will probably try the canned chiles. I also used Jack cheese instead of cheddar, as cheddar doesn't seem very authentic. This is one of my favorite dishes to order in a good mexican restaurant, and this recipe is a good (not great, but good) substitute.

Prepared for Cinco de Mayo dinner and it was SO much easier than I anticipated! I admit, I did make easier by using Hatch canned peppers and la familia loved them without noticing the difference from my old recipe! I served them topped with enchilada sauce and more cheese. Accompanied with the Southwestern Pinto Bean Soup (epicurious excellent!), spanish rice (my own), various salsas, guacamole, chips, margaritas. What a feast for the Cinco de Mayo Celebration!

For the cook who wanted canned chilis. You don't need to go to a latin market. ORTEGA brand makes both diced and whole canned chilis. Alot of people use these instead. I use pasillas, my husband "roasts" them on the bbq, then bag em and the skins slide right off. I also use monterey jack. I've ordered many rellenos and never had them with cheddar.

I don't know if I used the right peppers. They were called "italian peppers" in a very hispanic grocery store. But they looked right. Can anyone clarify? I roasted them too long and they fell apart a bit when I took skin off (it's a pepper with thin flesh). Was worried that the oil would flood into the peppers during frying, but not a problem--the egg dip was thick and insulating. I expected a messy, greasy result, but they turned out to be terrific despite my mistakes! It's a sturdy, suprisingly easy recipe--hard to screw up. I didn't broil with cheese--didn't seem necessary.

Really great with a few changes: I used jack instead of cheddar, and next time will use chihuahua or oaxaca. I made my own sauce with diced tomatoes, garlic, cayenne, onions and green chiles. Cooked it for 10 min, pureed it, then cooked 10 more minutes. Put sauce on plates, then topped with the rellenos. Someone else told me they used canned chiles so they don't have to do the roasting/peeling step. Will try to find those in a Latino market. These are messy and to make, so next time they will be the main course served with rice and beans. (I made them as an appetizer and had to clean the entire kitchen before I could start on the rest of the meal!)

An easy & delicious recipe. I find that placing the peppers under the broiler, then putting them in a sealed paper bag for a few minutes to steam works best for removing the skins. I removed some of the seeds, then sealed the stuffed peppers w/ toothpicks prior to adding them to the batter. I used pepper jack cheese in place of the cheddar & served them with salsa & hot sauce. This is also a great accompaniment to eggs, (served with a wedge of avocado on the side) for a Mexican breakfast!

Great recipe! I started washing and slicing my roasted peppers before I looked at the recipe and cut off the stems. Oops! So I actually went through the whole process without stuffing the peppers with cheese. Then, after I fried them I rolled them around the cheese and put additional cheese on top. It worked out just fine and got me out of my stuffing predicament.

Rating: 3
I roasted the peppers too long apparently because the skin was burnt onto the meat of the chili. I salvaged what I could and had more than on slit in my chilies. But I stuffed them anyway (the best that I could) and decided to put them in the refrigerator for an hour before dredging them in the flour and the egg batter. Refrigerating help because the chilies didn't fall apart. They were excellent chili rellenos. I will definately make them again except I will be more careful when roasting the chilies. Once again an excellent recipe from Epicurious.

This is very tasty! I slit and cleaned the chiles before I broiled them and left the stem on. I found leaving the stem on helped to hold the cheese inside. It also makes for a nice presentation! Next time I will try pepper jack cheese :o) Yum Yum!

Excellent! I found it much easier to put the whipped egg mixture on a salad plate, place my chili on top, then cover the other side of the chili with the egg mixture. Simply slides right off the plate into the pan with the least disturbance to the stuffing.

This was easy to make. It looks and tastes fantastic. A definite show stopper. I would make this again and again.

These are awesome! My first try at making rellenos- very easy, just a little time consuming. I browned some ground round and stuffed the chiles with the meat and cheese mixture. Did not slit the chiles. Only cut the tops and then stuffed from there. They stayed together very well. Next time, I want to stuff with mashed potatoes and cheese like our favorite mexican restaurant does- YUM!!

This is a great recipe and definitely a keeper! The messy part with rellenos is always trying to keep the cheese inside the chile and after some experimenting I find that toothpicks (though far from perfect) work best for me. I have accepted that in order to eat rellenos I have to make some mess in my kitchen. Totally worth it!!

I just love this dish. I do have one suggestion. I used CHIHUAHUA cheese and it was SO MUCH BETTER. I went heavy with the cheese to. Umm...ummm..goood! Also I found that if I whipped the egg whites and then whipped in the egg yolks and quickly put the mixture in the freezer for about 10 minutes, it helped the eggs bind to the pepper better.

I found this recipe to be excellent, only thing I did different was to remove the seeds with a slit down the center so I can keep the steam in tact. This was a very tasty recipe, and now has a special spot in my recipe file box...

When I read this recipe, it seemed so simple! I read it out of my ancient copy of Gourmet. Unfortunately I didn't read the part about using 'Roasted' peppers, so I used fresh ones. The flour held on better than I expected, but the eggs were a bit sassy. Most of the batter fell off when I fried them, but I fried them until they roasted in the pan! I topped with shredded cheese(mixed white cheeses from the deli,on sale) and some of Ms. Renfro's Chipotle Corn salsa, and broiled...it was still delicious! I served it on a bed of fresh corn sauted in vege. broth, green onions, and a little cajun seasoning with chopped avocados added at the end. It was truely delicious and I cannot wait to make it again!

I'm from NM, where we eat LOTS of green chile, and several of our more authentic restaurants make their rellenos this way. We enjoyed them, although there was kind of mess to clean up. They make an excellent 'side' to any mexican meal. We used a 50-50 vegetable-olive oil blend to fry in and they were great!

recipe should have included instructions on how big of a slice to put in chile when stuffing with cheese. make sure the oil is hot as the recipe instructs. quick easy filling
