Certainly not the tastiest recipe for sweet potatos, but you can't beat the quick preparation or bake time for a great snack, or last minute side for dinner. I melted a little butter for the serving dish and gave one last sprinkle of the cin/sug mixture before serving.

This was a great side dish for Thanksgiving. It was simple, easy and very good. My sister, who doesn't like sweet potatoes enjoyed them and said "it tasted like French Toast". I have to admit there are tastier recipes out there but if you like sweet potatoes "as is" and you want to stick to simple recipes, this one is it!

My b/f made this for Thanksgiving, and it was gone in a matter of minutes. It's an easy recipe for a non-cook like him, though a bit labor intensive. We used yams instead of sweet potatoes, and they came out just right.

Not impressed. I used true sweet potatoes (pale skinned yellow flesh) and wondered if maybe this recipe really was calling for Jewel or Garnet yams. In either cased, 20 minutes does not cut it in cooking time! These potatoes really require more oil or butter or some kind of moisture in the cooking because they tend to be really dry. So, my end result was al dente and dry slices of sweet potatoe with crunchy cinnamon sugar on top. If this is what you're looking for, go for it!

Great recipe for the Holidays. My husband dislikes the traditional sweet potato puree recipes, so this was a nice addition to our holiday menu. Not only were the sweet potatoes soft and tasty, but you can't beat the ease of preparation.

This is so simple, easy and tasty that I'd encourage everyone to try it out. It's great when you want something different with a weeknight dinner that doesn't take much effort. It's great with pork.

I was looking for a simple easy sweet potato recipe and I intended to make this recipe for thanksgiving. However, when I realized that it needed to cook at 425 and everything else I was cooking needed to cook at 325 - 350 I dropped this from my menu
