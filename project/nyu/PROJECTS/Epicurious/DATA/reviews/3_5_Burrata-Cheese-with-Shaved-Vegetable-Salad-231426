We loved this. I made exactly as written with the addition of toasted pine nuts. Endive browning is a small challenge. Maybe lemon juice will help with that next time - which, BTW, I can't wait for!

Good but not great. The cheese makes it and does not need the drizzled oil.

Absolutely perfect as written. Incredibly fresh and elegant, and so easy. Be sure to shave the endive last, as it will turn brown very quickly. Go ahead and toss the shaved veggies with the lemon juice to prevent browning.

A friend brought this to a dinner party at my home this week-end, and it was fabulous. Very pretty, light and such a fresh taste. If you can't find burrata, you can substitute fresh mozzarella. She garnished it with a sprig of fresh dill. This is a real keeper!
