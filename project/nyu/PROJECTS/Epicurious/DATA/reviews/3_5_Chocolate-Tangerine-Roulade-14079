This was great; my husband said it was teh best dessert I ever made. Like others, I think that this could be made with other fruits and liquors for some variety. FYI, I thought the chocolate base was very stiff and I was concerned that I'd have trouble incorporating the egg whites; however, it wasn't a problem.

This is wonderful. It's become a standard dessert at our house. I usually just use canned mandarin oranges instead of the whole oranges, and it's still excellent.

Every time i made this, i served to really good friends who didn't mind how it looked, because it tasted great but it looked a little like a third grader's first attempt at a jelly roll.... It just didn't roll well, the cake was too thin, but let me tell you - it was delicious. I found another recipe in gourmet for chocolate roulade, and will try that recipe with this filling. Delicious, but takes practice.

This was very good. I made this for work and everyone raved. The only thing about it was that I had trouble keeping the whipping cream mixture in while I rolled it. Some of it ended up squeezing out as I rolled it. A friend suggested that I chill the cream so that it is not as liquidy. I will try that next time. It was my first time making a roulade and I thought that it turned out well, but quite time consuming. I don't mind spending the time, but be prepared for the time commitment.

I had never made a roulade before, so I was nervous but the recipe turned out beautifully. Very elegant, like a true european pastry, and basically easy. Even if the cake cracks when rolling it up, you can arrange so that one can't tell. I thought 1/2 cup sugar was too little and added a bit more, but in fact 1/2 cup would have been perfect. Decorate with plenty of sieved unsweetened cocoa, and dip ends of some extra orange slices in melted chocolate (cool on waxed paper) to garnish plate and cake. I also decorated with mint. Lovely.

I have to admit that I mad a complete variation of this dish which was delicious - I used store bought pound cake and dredged it in rum, oj and grand marnier then layered cake, cream mixture w/ a bit of sugar, tangerine slices and repeated. It was FANTASTIC - a new school tiramisu
