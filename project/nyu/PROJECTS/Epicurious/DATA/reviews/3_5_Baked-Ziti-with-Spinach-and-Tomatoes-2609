Hubby made this last night for dinner - super yummy with some alterations - homemade croutons for topping to add crunch; extra tomatoes and spinach for moistness (and nutrition) and homemade pesto (my contribution!) with lots of garlic! Can't wait to have leftovers for lunch!!! Definitely a keeper!!!

I made this last night for my family. I up the pasta to 1 pound and then increased the other items to scale. I would as others have done increase the tomatoes with a 14 oz can. I also added 1 cup ricotta for creaminess. By far my favorite basked pasta. I must be others also because with 7 adults there were zero leftovers.

I made this when the recipe first came out, but have not made it in years (trying to cut out breads/pasta), however made this for a dinner party about a month ago and it was fantastic! I think I used a little more pesto than the recipe called for and would NOT suggest that (while it was fantastic, it was a bit too rich). This is great for larger crowds, it's really quite simple and can be done ahead of time (I assemble the entire casserole and refrigerate until needed--I remove from refrigerator and try to bring to close to room temp so it doesn't go into the oven ice cold). AGain, great for do-ahead dish, and it is hearty and satisfying and guests gobble it up.

I made it when it first debuted in Bon Appetit in 1994 and it has become a family favorite. As many reviews note, it is SO adaptable. I often add mushrooms, green peppers, and top with fresh tomoato slices....and I always play with spices and fresh herbs in recipes. Literally a pot-luck that never fails to please!

Not only does this taste wonderful - I can usually make it without chopping a THING by using one of those vegetable dicers on the onions, store-bought minced garlic (usually comes in a small jar), and the type of mozzarella cheese that comes in smaller pieces.

Huge hit at family party. Everyone said it was the best baked ziti they ever had. Just added another can of tomatoes...we like it saucy. Didn't add onions. Would make again!

My sister originally sent me this recipe. The first time, I followed it to the letter with minor change in the sausage and type of pasta. I used sweet Italian sausage, and whole grain penne that works well. I also think the shredded Mozzarella works better than the cubes. This is one of my favorites that I've put in my recipe program.

Oh dear goodness, yum! This was a great take on baked ziti, and received rave reviews from my fiance. As other reviewers have suggested, I used a whole bag of penne (17 oz or so) and increased the sauce accordingly. I used proportionately more pesto and added a generous amount of heavy cream to the sauce, in addition to cayenne and fennel seed (which I sauteed with the onion and garlic). Oh, and I also used vegetarian Italian sausage and it worked fine! This is a definite keeper - a great, hearty dish to serve to a hungry crowd.

I LOVE this recipe. Made it several times, each time using a different type of meat (spicy sausage, turkey sausage, ground turkey, etc). The most recent time I tried a suggestion from another review and layered the noodles, the meat sauce, the spinach and the cheese. I don't recommend it! Mixing everything together helps the spinach & cheese distribute evenly and really taste better - so that's how I will do it from here on out.

Made this tonight for the first time and my husband went back for a second helping. He declared that I am to make this recipe for now on! I also used 1lb. of sausage from Trader Joe's 1 8oz ball of mozzarella cheese and 10 ounces or a whole bag of spinach. I also used 1 whole box of ziti noodles and upped the tomatoes to 1 28 once can and 1/2 of a 14 ounce can. Added a little more pesto and cheese to balance it out. Delicious!

Very simple, very good. The amount of spinach seems obscence when first added, but it cooks down well. A few mods--we used turkey sausage, homemade tomato sauce instead of the seasoned tomatoes and did not have the pesto. It was still fantastic.

I made this tonight in two small Emily Henry baking dishes. I did not have hot sausage so I used regular sausage and added red pepper flakes. Also added dried basil and oregano. Omitted the pesto.The one thing I did differently was to put the cooked pasta in the baking dish with a drizzle of olive oil and then spoon the meat sauce over it. Then I put a layer of fresh baby spinach on top of that. More sauce. And then the cheeses. Parm on the top. It did not dry the pasta out and had wonderfully crusty edges. Everyone loved it. Including my 1 year old Grandson. Definate keeper.

I made this last night and it was SO GOOD. I sort of used what I had on hand so I didn't follow the recipe to the letter - I used shredded mozzarella and I only had a 14 oz can of tomatoes so I made up for the rest by using some jarred pasta sauce. Also...did anyone else feel like 8 cups was way too much spinach? I used half of that, and it turned out great - 8 cups would have been ridiculous...or maybe I did something wrong...but it doesn't say anywhere you're supposed to cook them down first, so I assume you just throw them in fresh and uncooked. Anyways, it turned out fantastic. Would definitely, definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
My husband loved this!! I made my own spinach-arugula pesto (from epicurious), used five spicy turkey sausages and added a glass of red wine to the sauce. I also used about half the amount of parmesan cheese. Next time I will make the mozzarella cubes smaller and undercook the pasta. My cheese clumps were slightly too big and the pasta was a bit soft after baking. Next time I might try adding a bit of truffle oil, also. Regardless, this dish was a big hit and I will make it again!

I Trader Joe'd it with their pork sausage, frozen spinach, and pasta sauce starter (one carton of that, and one 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes). It was great, but I made the lazy mistake of not thawing and draining the spinach first. So it was a little cool after baking, and watery the next day. Next time I'll use the fresh spinach instead.

Fantastic. Easy. I rounded everything up to the standard size (1 lb. sausage, 1lb. box of whole wheat ziti, 10 oz. package frozen chopped spinach) added the 8 oz. can of tomato sauce mentioned by others ant topped with sliced mozarella. A total keeper.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent baked pasta dish. I've made this several times for company and it's always well received. I usually reduce the mozzarella to 3oz and reduce the spinach to 5-6 cups. Also, this can be assembled earlier in the day and baked just before serving. Make sure both pasta AND sauce are completely cooled before assembling.

Rating: 4
This is my very favorite baked ziti recipe. I make a few small changes: I up the portion of sausage to 1 pound and spinach to 10 ounces so that I can use the full package of both. I also use a whole package of mozzarella (the one I buy is 8 ounces) and make sure to make the cubes small because as it melts it makes little clumps of spinach/ziti around each cube. Finally, I don't mix the parmesan in; I cover the top with parmesan. Make sure to cover it for at least most of the cooking time so it doesn't dry out.

I've been making this dish for several years and it's always a hit. I actually don't cover it, although I may considering covering for half the time, as I find the contrast of the crispy and soft parts more interesting. Having made it often, I do undercook the pasta by about 3 minutes in order to keep the pasta from being overcooked with the extra bake time and let's it soak up some of the delicious sauce while baking.

The family loved this. I made it vegetarian. I didn't have diced tomatoes, so I chopped up some romas and then added tomato puree (I would also probably use more sauce in the bake). The pesto (I used homemade) was all the difference. I also covered the pan with foil to keep it from crisping too much.

I made this dish last night and it came out perfectly. To cut down on the fat, I used a Buffalo-style chicken sausage that had the right amount of "heat." I also used baby spinach and a can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce. I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer and covered the dish with foil during baking so the ziti wasn't dry or overcooked at all. BTW--I just got a text message from hubby thanking me for the ziti and saying it was DELICIOUS! I will definitely make this again!

This was so simple and very tasty! I substituted hot turkey sausage and used one 14 oz can of roasted tomatoes and one 14 oz can of tomatoes with italian seasonings.

I've made this twice. Once w/o meat, once w/meat and both time, it was a hit. The pesto is the secret weapon. It makes for just the right amount of interest in the midst of all that comfort...I used frozen spinach o make sure it broke apart well. Turned out great

Made for a potluck, and got many compliments. Easy, tasty, and the spinach adds a nice twist on a standard favorite. Adjusted ingredients upward for a full pound of ziti, but I'm guessing you can be off a little here and there and still be okay. This one goes in the keeper basket.

I made this exactly as listed but the result was a bit dry. I added some freshly roasted tomato sauce to moisten the ziti. It was OK but nothing great. It made quite a bit so I have a dish in the freezer for later. It definitely needs some adjustments to get to my taste.

Wow! So easy & delicious. I made this so quickly that even with a 21-month-old toddler demanding my attention, it came together easily and quickly. I used the spicy pork sausage from our local Whole Foods Market, which was tasty & quite spicy. Despite the heat from the sausage, my toddler pointed to her mouth and said, "Good! Yummy!" My husband said it's a keeper. I made it basically as written, only difference is that our Whole Foods isn't carrying fresh spinach at the moment due to the e. coli scare, so I used a whole 10 oz. package of frozen chopped spinach. Turned out great. We thought it had the right amount of moisture, the liquid from the tomatoes was absorbed by the pasta, so it was a moist casserole, not a saucy casserole. Note: It needs to be covered with foil right after it's done if you're waiting to serve it ... I didn't do that, and all the ziti that was exposed on top went very dry & hard to chew. Very flavorful the night I made it, extra tasty the next night as leftovers.

I haven't gotten this much praise for a dish from my family in a long time! As a previous review said, it has a nice lightness for a baked pasta. Used 8 oz. of mozzarella, and Trader Joe's ready to use frozen spinach. Didn't have pesto, so just added a teaspoon of dried oregano to the sauce. Since I assembled it the night before I poured a little water over the dish when I baked it, and covered it with foil for part of the time so it wouldn't dry out then put on the parm when I took the foil off. No leftovers!

I took a chance and made this recipe (doubled) for a birthday potluck. I wasn't sure how many the original recipe served, but with everything doubled I ended up with three sizeable trays (9" x 13")of delicious baked ziti. I too substituted frozen Boca Italian Sausages for the real meat (they were just as good and much healthier) and (to negate the positive health effects of the fake sausage) I added about a cup of whole fat ricotta to the mix. I also threw in a splash or two of leftover red wine, though I couldn't tell you what specific effect that had. The result: a real crowd-pleaser! Everyone who tried it really liked it, and I liked that it wasn't as heavy as some baked ziti can be. My boyfriend just polished off half a tray of it for lunch, so I will definitely add this to my dinner repertoire!

Rating: 3
I think Epicurious needs to add 1/2 forks. I would rate this 3.5, actually. My family LOVED this dish. I will definitely make it again. Because I read the review about the liquid in the sauce, I made the following changes: added 1/3 c red wine when I sauteed onions and garlic (which I did seperately from the sausage), added an 8 oz can of tomato sauce in addition to the tomatoes. I also tossed the pasta with about 1/2-3/4 c ricotta cheese before mixing it all together. My whole family thought it was super tasty and I will definitely make it again!

This is my husband's favorite pasta dish. Meat lovers, cover your eyes, but i actually use vegetarian "sausage" (I use Boca Italian) I have made this many, many times - sometimes with homeade pesto, sometimes bought - either adds great flavor to your basic baked ziti. I am still playing around to find the right balance of ziti and sauce so it does not come out dry - if anyone has the answer (cups of sauce to cups of COOKED pasta) that would be super helpful

I used low carb pasta (just shy of al dente), cooked the CHOPPED spinach and drained it, did NOT add extra tomatoes or liquid, added crushed red pepper and cayenne, added 3/4 cup ricotta and 2 ounces of feta to the pasta mixture (in addition to the mozzeralla). Very, very good.

Not usually a fan of baked ziti, but this was amazing. Added some red wine, and didn't reduce the sauce too much so as not to be dry.

I have made this dish many times and it is always a hit! I use turkey sausage instead of pork and fresh mozzarella. Don't use bottled sauce the one in the receipe is very easy you can make it while the penne is cooking. I mix some fresh bread crumbs with the parmesan cheese to give it a crunchy top! Yummy!

I was disappointed. I followed the recipe, except for adding about 1/2 cup cream due to warnings about "dryness." The flavors all seemed to "mush" together so that none really stood out. The tomatoes and suasage got lost in the pesto, the pesto and spinach got lost in the tomatoes, the cheese got lost in everything. SO liked a lot and asked for seconds. At lunch the second day I added in some leftover steamed broccoli that, for me, created the brightness of flavor and texture the original lacked. Oh well, win some, lose some.

I used frozen, uncooked spinach, about 1/2 as much sausage and tossed in some bottled marinara to extend the sauce as I had no wine on hand. Also, no parm. Instead, tossed the hot pasta with some fresh mozzarella and blue cheese. Then a little more mozzarella on top, which browned up nicely. Overall, delish.

Based on other reviews about this needing more liquid, I added some red wine, tomato paste and fresh sliced mushrooms to the sauce. I was also very lazy and did not feel like running to the store for fresh spinach. I had a 10oz pkg. of CREAMED SPINACH in the freezer, so thawed it and used in in place of the fresh. Also used some fontina cheese along with the mozarella and pecorino romano in place of the parm, as that is also what I had on hand. (I did add a little more cheese than called for) WOW! The creamed spinach along with the extra liquid in the sauce and extra cheese made this wonderfully moist and delicious! I'll be making this with the creamed spinach from now on!

This was very good. I needed to prepare it the day before I baked it, so I added an extra 14-1/2 ounce can of undrained diced tomatoes knowing the liquid would soak into the pasta overnight.

Very good and very nice to have as a "make ahead" dish when needed.

This is the best pasta dish ever and I don't care for Italian sausage and prefer spinach in a salad. I use whole wheat pasta and did add an extra 14oz can of tomatoes. The only drawback is that my family requests it weekly and I'm afraid we'll be tired of it soon!

This is the one of the best recipes I've ever gotten from Epicurious. It's particularly good for last minute dinner guests. Everyone always has seconds.

This recipe is my all-time favorite when I need something quick to make for company. Everyone also raves about it. I do add more tomatoes and pesto as it is too dry otherwise, and I use baby spinach and turkey sausage. I've even experimented with different kinds of pesto. Always a HUGE hit -- and even better the next day after the flavors have blended.

Good concept . . . needs work. Definitely needs more tomato liquid than the recipe calls for. We used 26 ounces of chopped tomatoes for a half recipe, and that was about right. Cook and drain the spinach in advance, or use frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed dry. The fresh, uncooked spinach makes the sauce watery. Needs something to bind the sauce to the pasta. We'll try tossing the pasta with some ricotta cheese next time.

I LOVE this recipe and I've made it at least 6 times now. I even enjoy it cold the next day because it reminds me of a pizza. I add more cheese than it calls for and I now also add black olives, sliced mushrooms & turkey pepperoni (placed on top so it gets slightly crispy).

This was very good. I made two trays of this pasta, one was served that same evening and the other was baked and served the next night for a different function. The one that sat overnight was far superior to the one that was served that same evening. Because I added an additional 14-1/2 oz. can of diced tomatoes, the pasta that sat overnight absorbed the additional liquid and overall flavors. Next time I will add sliced mushrooms, sliced olives and additional mozzarella cheese...and make it one day ahead.

Tony, eat your heart out. My HOT salsiccia (Viviano's, for all you St. Louisans) is grilling as I prepare to make this ultimate Italian casserole for the nth time. An all-season family favorite. Definitely slice the sausage, use more pesto (fresh is good), undercook the pasta to absorb the liquids. A party/potluck must-have.

Excellent dish, but be sure to get the hot italian sausage. I've made it with mild sausage (per request) and it really loses a lot of flavor. When made as instructed, it's absolutely phenomenal. I've also found that - due to variances in the "heat" of hot italian sausage - I like to tweak the flavor a bit by adding crushed red pepper and cayenne pepper to get the perfect flavor.

I was expecting a lasagna-like taste with less structure, but that's not what this dish turned out like. It has character of its own. It was very good, and great for lunch the next day too. The recipe could use a little "kick" in my opinion, maybe some red pepper flakes or something. All in all, I think this one has potential, and I look forward to making it again.

Made this dish for my crew at the fire station, as this was my last day on shift and it is tradition. I doubled the recipe to feed 11 hungry guys and also added sliced mushrooms and olives. Thought for sure it was to much food. They ate most of it and I even caught a couple of them snack'in on it later that night. It was so easy to make and they loved it. This is a winner.

Better than lasagne and much easier. The ingredients are pretty basic, but somehow the sum is more than its parts. Might chop the spinach next time. Used crushed tomatoes and extra pesto.

What a great recipe! I've made it few times now, it's always a big hit. The first time I've made it, I didn't have pesto so I've used fresh basil, it was so good I didn't try it with pesto.

So, needed a recipe for Soprano's night. They are always making Baked Ziti so I thought I would give it a whirl. There were 10 people, so I should have doubled the recipe, but it was fantastic. Healthy (I used "low-carb" pasta) and delicious! Give it a try......I'll be making it again.....soon!

I was looking for a potluck dish for a church dinner and thought I found it with this recipe. What a disaster! While I didn't end up with the "green nasty mess" it was nothing special at all. I drained the tomatoes like the reviewers suggested (Mistake #1). Pasta came out totally too dry. The mixture of ingredients didn't work -- the sausage was too hot, the tomatoes too bland, and there was too much garlic. I was embarrassed to bring it to the dinner.

I undercooked the ziti b/c I knew it would cook in the oven, used andouille sausage (because that is what I had) and crushed tomatoes (oops - grabbed the wrong can!) and it turned out great! A very easy weeknight meal to make. Next time, I'll make it with the correct ingredients.

I added more cheese, but I'm a cheese lover. Great meal and it's even good cold in the morning (if you like cold pizza). I can't wait to make this again!

This is the best "baked ziti" recipe. Vegetarian changes: substitute the sausage for 3/4 - 1 lb mushrooms and 1 T. olive oil, added 1/8 to 1/4 t. red pepper, depending on preference of heat. Will sometimes use purred tomatoes. Use 10 oz bag of spinach (we love spinach) and 8 oz mozzarella. Instead of using salt, added 1/2 c. chopped Kalamata olives. Covered it while baking and uncovered for last 5-10 minutes. Since our kids are gone, easy to halve or make 2 smaller dishes. Should be made once a month!

This recipe is wonderful. Full of flavor. The only thing I changed was I cooked the spinach for a few minutes first. The Italian sausage gave the dish tons of flavor. A definate keeper!

I've been making this recipe since I first saw it published. Along the way I made a few changes though. First I brown the sausage, then add large cut up onion and quite a bit of garlic and add then add my own spaghetti sauce (28 oz. can crushed tomatoes, 15 oz. can tomato sauce, 1/4 oz can tomato paste, 1 C water + whatever Italian spices I have on hand. Cook it down & add 1/2 jar of pesto sauce and cook for about 10 min. I use a mix of fontina and mozzarella - depends on what's on hand in addition to the parmesan. I use more mozzarella/fontina than called for because during the last 10 minutes of baking I put about a cup of the cheese over the top. If it isn't bubbling, I cook it a little longer. I also use a whole lb of ziti and a whole bag of baby spinach. It's basically the same recipe as originally written, but I've made it so many times that I can't help myself by changing it.

This is a cozy dish. Good for cols winter nights. Like most of the reviewers, I only used part of the tomato's liquid and found that it kept the dish from becomming runny.

This was very simple and extremely tasty. The results were very satisfying. My husband, even after he said he was full and wasn't going to eat any more, couldn't resist going back for thirds. I did drain the tomatoes like the other people did and that, I can see, was a help. I only had a 5oz. bag of spinach but that was plenty. I will definatly be making this in the future! The only thing is, there are just two of us so now I have a LOT of this dish left over. I would cut in half next time.

This ziti was delicious - a welcome change from my regular ziti recipe. I drained all of the juice from the tomatoes before adding them to the sauce, this made the sauce mixture less runny. I also added a bunch of mushrooms, but decreased the spinach because 8 cups was a lot for my family! Overall, it was a delicious comfort meal on a cold Canadian night. Would definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
My husband loved it, and he knows his Italian dishes. I would change a few things--would drain the tomatoes, like another cook did, and would undercook the ziti a little. The flavor was great, but the ziti fell apart in the oven, and there was excess juice under the casserole. I was lazy and put in a whole pound of sausage, and it was a little too much for me. Next time I'll halve the whole recipe--this was way too much for the 2 of us, and we can't eat that many leftovers.

This was so good! It's even better as leftovers two days later.

Baked ziti doesn't usually wow me, so I really was surprised at how wonderful this turned out to be. It's not tomato-heavy like a lot of baked pastas. I used a little extra sausage, more pasta than called for, and about 8 oz. cheese plus some shredded mozzarella on top. I left out the pesto, but used diced tomatoes with basil, so didn't miss it. Great leftovers too.

I loved this dish. It's fairly easy to make and very flavorful. I usually don't like baked ziti dishes cause I often find them bland, but this one was great! My boyfriend suggested putting a dash of red pepper flakes in with the garlic for some kick, so I guess I'll try that next time, but I thought it was already great the way it is.

Rating: 3
Delicious and easy. I used all the tomatoes and juice, omitted the pesto, and substituted goat cheese for mozarella (the cubed goat cheese was "planted" in the pasta once the mixture was in the baking dish, to keep the goat from melting during the tossing stage.) I will definitely make this again.

Sometimes something so simple tastes so good. I did not add the juices from tomatos as I thought it would be too runny and glad I didn't. Add more spinach and cheese. Used fresh spinach tortellini. Just execellent!

Wow!!! Fantastic!! I made the pesto using a recipe from this site b/c it is hard to find ingredients like that in green bay! I also left out the sausage because i wanted it to be a meatless dish. Instead of cubed mozzarella i used shredded and then sprinkled the remainder of the package on top before baking. My fiancee raved about how good it was! Hope the left overs are just as yummy!

Newly married and not a great cook, but my husband absolutly loved this one! Add mushrooms and make sure you get spicy sausages. Also, next time I'm not going to put as much juice from the tomatoes into the dish. It was a little runny. Makes a meal for an army, but great leftovers. Very filling and easy.

This dish smelled heavenly while we were preparing it, so I was a little surprised when the final product tasted a tad bland. This needs a sharper cheese--more parmesan, less mozarella. To prevent it from getting dry, I covered it with foil in the oven like I do when I bake lasagna. The dish was very moist & bubbly, as a result. I think we would have also preferred our sausage sliced, instead of broken up.

I really enjoy this without the sausage.

The pesto really makes this sauce different. The sauce did turn brown but I figure it's like paint. Try mixing red and green and you get a sludge color. Anyway I had left over pesto to use up and while I would never serve this to guests it's great comfort food. We will be taking it to work for lunches. I didn't have spinach so I used peas(my one alteration) I think the peas made it a bit prettier than spinach would have. I will make it again if I have leftover pesto.

Even my picky son loves this dish. I took other suggestions and added mushrooms, a few black olives and drizzled a little olive oil over the dish before cooking. I have made this dish twice-once using sweet and once using hot Italian sausages because its impossible to get good sausage in the south-we have it shipped from Providence-and we have to use whatever we have in freezer-both kinds work well.

The best thing about this recipe is that my teenagers raved about it! (They had no idea how much spinach was in it...)I think the pesto adds a wonderful depth of flavor that I wouldn't omit. I used a little less pasta, adding by sight so that it wouldn't be dry. Used spicy turkey sausage, chopped the spinach in a food processer to make it easier to deal with, and used a jar of Costco fresh marinara instead of canned tomatoes, because that's what I had. Also used a little more cheese as I wanted it to be really creamy. A great dish!

I made this dish for a group of twelve hungry skiiers and snowboarders. I used 28oz of penne pasta to make three variations. I used shredded mozzerella and asiago, spicy italian turkey sausage, a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes in puree, doubled the garlic, and added dried oregano and basil and a pinch of crushed red pepper along the way. The first version followed the recipe (with previous changes), the second substituted portebello mushrooms for the sausage, and the third had mushrooms and sausage but no onion. I served it with garlic bread and a large tossed salad. There was only a small amount left over and no complaints.

I made this using the full pound of pasta and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly. I used shredded mozzarella as that was what I had. Cubed cheese would be better I think. I did add extra tomatoes based on other reviews. I threw in a little extra garlic and pesto sauce because we like lots of flavor. Very easy and very good.

If Carmela would make this, maybe Tony would stay home more often :o) This was reeeally wonderful! It's even good cold. I added the extra tomatos as advised and a dollop more of the pesto. This makes a LOT--which is good because when I served it, nobody could stop eating it.

This is delicious (do double the tomatoes). We made it several times as written, and over the years it's evolved into our "clean out the vegetable bin" recipe - we throw in peppers, broccoli, zucchini, kale, or whatever else we have, and add jarred pasta sauce - still yummy! I'll admit with added sauce you can even omit the pesto and sausage, but I don't want to review a completely different recipe! This is a flexible and tasty dish - make extra and freeze a pan!

I had high hopes, but was disappointed. The spinach seemed like it would make a nice addition but it actually detracted from the presentation.

I made this for a large family dinner the day after Thanksgiving and it was perfect. The sauce can be prepared the night before and assembly is very easy, even in the midst of family madness.

ALMOST as good as my favorite Epicurious pasta recipe-- Penne in Cream Sauce with Sausage. This was really yummy, and I was fooled into thinking this dish was somewhat healthy thanks to the spinach. (Not likely.) I modified the recipe, based on previous reviewers' comments: added the garlic a few minutes late to avoid scorching it, doubled the amount of tomatoes (a must), and doubled the amount of pesto. I also used brocconcini, because my store was out of ziti. I would definitely recommend undercooking the pasta slightly, or it will be mushy after baking in a blanket of sauce and cheese for half an hour.

STICK TO THE WAY THE RECIPE IS WRITTEN!!I DID NOT change a thing and it was to die for! I took a chance and made it for the first time for some friends and they all raved. Made it again the following night because my husband and I couldn't get enough of it! Very tasty!!

I use 1/2 lb of sausage and 1/2 lb of pasta, in 11x7 dish, or 1 lb pasta (rigatoni) and the vegetarian version (1lb sliced baby bella mushrooms, 2 onions, lots more garlic, double the pesto, same amount of tomatoes, but an additional 8oz can tomato sauce) in a 13x9 dish. I don't think the sausage adds anything to this--stick with the veggie way. I used 8oz defrosted frozen chopped spinach, well-drained, and added it directly to the sauce instead of separately. Excellent--really nice blend of flavors. Great for a casual party/video night with friends.

This recipe deserves three and half forks. It's WONDERFUL! My husband has been bugging me to make baked ziti, and I found a winner with this recipe. I don't know what the cooks from New York or New Jersey are talking about. With only a quarter of a cup of pesto, I don't understand how it came out like a "green, nasty mess". The sauce was a lovely red w/flecks of green and was absolutely beautiful. The finished product is fantastic. I will definitely make this again. One change I did make: I added the extra can of tomato sauce like the other cooks suggested. Do yourself a favor: make this recipe!

An absolute winner! This is one of the best pasta dishes I've ever made or eaten. It is simple, but excellent. I served it to a group of six friends, and it was a hit. Like other reviewers, I added an additional 28 oz tomato sauce, and some extra diced tomatoes. I also tripled the garlic (can there EVER be too much garlic???) and tossed in a small pinch of crushed red pepper flakes and a little thyme which made it a little more interesting.

This was really great, and I had my doubts due to the fact that I wouldn't exactly call my family pesto lovers. They raved, and I even used more pesto than was called for! I will use more tomatoes next time as well.

I don't usually bake pasta, but this was delicious. I used one can of stewed and one can of diced tomatoes, also added a can of tomato sauce, and I used less cheese and thought it was cheesy enough. also covered and baked for less time. I thought it would last for days but my boyfriend and roommate finished almost all of it the first night! I'll try a veggie version next.

I made this dish a few weeks ago and it was quite tasty. It was much better the next day, and I would agree with previous reviewers that adding extra tomatoes would make this dish quite right. I wish I had used the extra tomatoes, as the dish was a bit dry, but the flavor was there!

I made this last night for dinner for my boyfriend and myself and it was delicious. I did make a couple of alterations to the recipe. I did a mixture of both hot and sweet italian sausage, added sliced mushrooms to the onion/sausage mixture and also added in a small can of tomato sauce.This gave it some added flavor. Classico now has a pesto that you can buy that is excellent for this recipe. Will definitely make again!!

I made this last night and it was great! It will definitely be added to our permanent rotation. Since there are only three in our family, I fudged the amounts for all the ingredient making roughly half a batch and put it in an 8x8 pan and it worked perfectly. I used baby spinach and the size of the leaves was perfect.

This is one of the BEST baked zitis I've ever had, and it's virtually tamper-proof...I've used eggplant instead of the sausage (lightly steam first) and added zucchini, among other things. This is the recipe that made me sign up and write a review!

This dish is easy, delish,and versatile. I used cremini mushrooms, quartered, fresh spinach, fresh basil, and lots of mozz & parm cheese. I took the advice of other reviewers & added extra tomatoes & garlic. I loved the addition of the pesto, which I used very generously, and think that some spicy sausage would have been an excellent addition. However, I'm currently in England & their sausage is not like the Italian type, so I opted to forgo it. Perhaps, hamburger would suffice. I'd still keep the mushrooms though. This is a rustic dish but tasty & comforting. A salad, some garlic bread, & ice cream sundaes sound like a fun family meal to me. My boyfriend has 3 friends coming to stay with us next weekend, all of whom are in their early twenties, and I plan on making this dish because of its simplicity & high likability factor. I love elegant dining, however, it's not always suitable. I don't think my young, male guests will be into salmon en croute. Rather, I think the safest best is a "stick to your ribs" dinner. This is it! Oh, & to the person who stated that this dish is, "...a big, red & green sloppy mess", I strongly disagree. This is comfort food that appeals to the masses. Anyway, aren't baked pasta dishes, such as lasagne, supposed to be ooey & gooey? That's part of their charm & I wouldn't have it any other way. This is a great buffet style dish too. Do try! Tried it again with sausage a week later, & my boyfriend loved it!

Yum! I did not have enough pesto sauce so I threw in some seasoned, green, Italian olives for extra depth -- they added great kick! I find regular mozzarella too bland and rubbery so I substituted smoked gruyere and it worked very well. I really don't see how anybody could turn this simple, tasty dish into a "red and green sloppy mess," unless they were exceptionally incompetent in the kitchen!

I would actually give this recipe 2 1/2 stars. While it wasn't the most delicious pasta dish, it was certainly easy to make, hearty, and can feed a big crowd! I substituted crimini mushrooms for the sausage (sauteed them first). Next time, I think I will saute the spinach first with a little olive oil, garlic, s & p and use more tomatoes and pesto, but otherwise this is a great group dish. The sauce was tasty and I would use that alone with spaghetti or some other pasta.

A great party recipe. I didn't have pesto on hand so I substituted a combination of basil, parsley, 2 T parmesan and 2 T bottled spaghetti sauce. It worked well.

Great dish. Took this to a party and it was a huge success. This was not the first time I made it so from the advice of others I have made a few changes. Double the tomato, I use two boxes of Pomi. And for simplicity a box of pasta and I go a little heavy on the pesto, garlic and cheeses. Last but not least cover the dish in the oven or some of the pasta will dry out.

Rating: 3
I love this recipe! I omitted the sausage and substituted 8 oz. sliced, fresh mushrooms and 1.75 oz. pine nuts (I sauteed the nuts along with the onions, etc.) I also used a bit more of the pesto sauce to taste. My entire family liked it, even my picky 9 year-old.

Made an excellent vegie dish by replacing the sausage with 2 cups sliced portabello mushrooms and using 8 cloves of garlic. Also added 15 oz tomato sauce and a teaspoon of tabasco for zing. -- great for casual get-togethers or whenever kids are a concern!

I served this rustic, comfort dish to my family the day before Christmas Eve. What a great, fast meal to pull together for an informal gathering. A smashing success!! Everyone asked for the recipe. We loved the combination on hot sausage, fresh spinach and gooey mozzarella. I added more garlic,mozzarella and tomatoes. This is a keeper!

This is very delicious and for certain would serve to guests! My family really enjoyed it and asked that I not lose the recipe. I prepared as written; however, I added an additional 14 oz. can of tomatoes -- the kind with basil and oregano in them -- and doubled the garlic.

I have made this dish time and time again. I ALWAYS get rave reviews. Everyone always asks for the recipe and I'm so embarassed to tell them how easy it is!! Two adjustments I make....I leave the sausage out and always add extra tomatoes.

Definitely a keeper. I added an additional 14.5 oz can of tomatoes for more sauce as was recommended by others. Also, I covered the dish with foil to avoid drying out the pasta. Very delicious, very easy and very forgiving.

Yummy ziti recipe -- I used two 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes. It worked well. My kids liked it two.

I will definately make this recipe again. I strongly disagree with the cook who said it was a nasty green mess. It was neither green nor nasty. Actually it was very colorful ( red with dark green disbursed throughout ) Make sure you drain the spinach. It definately needed more sauce. I took the suggestion of those who added a 15 oz. can of tomatoes. I would make it for company for an informal or spur of the moment dinner. Its not fancy.

I usually make this the weekend after Thanksgiving, when we're all tired of "beige food". It's colorful and tasty, and easy to prepare ahead of time. I also add extra spinach and tomato sauce, and top it with a combination of garlic breadcrumbs and Parmigiano Reggiano.

I made this dish with a couple of variations (upon the advice of an Italian friend I shredded the mozzarella and mixed it with 16 oz. of ricotta cheese and 1/2 cup of parmesan, then 'clumped it' onto the spinach at the time they added just the mozzarella cubes) I also added some mozzarella to the top before baking. It was delicious, made a TON (would easily serve 8 with bread/salad, and looked... well... a bit of a mess! Great "Snowed in Saturday" or after ski food, but I would only serve it to company who reallllly trusted my cooking. I'll definitely add it to my personal cookbook :) (Note: the taste may vary a bit depending on the spices in the sausage!)

My whole family liked this recipe very much. I will make this again. I would cover this dish with foil before baking. The top was a little dry. I would also reduce the cooking time to 20 minutes.

This is a very rustic pasta dish that goes together quite easily. I prepared then refrigerated the sauce and put the casserole together later. My only substitution was a can of pasta ready tomatoes for one of the cans of diced tomatoes because that is what I had in the pantry. This dish plus a green salad and garlic bread is a great weeknight or Saturday meal.

It was ok. Not enough sauce. I agree that I would never serve it to company;

Just goes to show, pasta and tomatoes with enough sausage and cheese will turn out great every time. As previous reveiwers have stated, this is a good "weeknight," "throw together," "kitchen sink," "bachelor cooking," "comfort food," type recipe. But what's all the hype? Could never serve it to company.

Well, I know you are all going to laugh but I am a 21 year old college student who when tries to make scrambled eggs...burns them. I made this ziti tonight for my boyfriend and he liked it but I almost fell over when I tasted it. I could not believe I made such a dish. Besides the fact that I actually managed to NOT burn it, it was easy and quick. I left out the sausage and still...MANIFIQUE!! Thanks epicurious!!!

Try this recipe with all fresh ingredients and you will be surprised at the increase in flavor. I have a vegetable garden with lots of fresh roma tomatoes, fresh basil to make the pesto, fresh spinach and I buy fresh California milk mozzarella(not as good as the Italian Buffalo ofcourse). A little more prep work, but a noticeable difference in flavor.

One word - YUMMY! I thought that this sounded good while reading the ingredients, but I was surprised with just how wonderful it was! I thought that the pesto was going to throw the flavors off, but it really complimented the dish. This is great to make for a large group or for just two (because the leftovers are just as tasty!). A+

This is very good! I used about a cup of homemade pesto (taken from a Bon Apetit June 1992 recipe), which is excellent in itself. If you only used 1/4 cup, you wouldn't be able to tell it's there. I used ground turkey, instead of sausage, and that was fine. I also used rotini as a variation. It's great how the cubed cheese melts on baking, making it gooy good!

I substituted 2 boxes of frozen chopped spinach for the fresh, fresh basil for the pesto, and just regular Italian sausage for the links and it turned out very good.

Great dish. A couple of suggestions after having made this dish numerous times: use 1 bag frozen spinach (I don't even thaw/drain it; I just dump it into the sauce); separate the mozzarella cubes with your fingers before adding them or they form a large glob; use about 3/4 bag ziti; and use 3 sausages. Good luck!

I tried this recipe after reading all these positive reviews. I must admit that I agree. This was a very easy and tasty dish that would be great for a gathering. Prepared pesto sauce can be quite expensive. Costo offers a good version at a much better price than the supermarkets. The only catch is that you have to buy a large container of it, though the leftovers freeze well.

It was tasty, but if the spinach leaves are large, I would recommend chopping them first. This was an easy, quick recipe and good for family eating. I made a mistake and got mild sausage instead of spicy - it was OK, but I will try spicy next time.
