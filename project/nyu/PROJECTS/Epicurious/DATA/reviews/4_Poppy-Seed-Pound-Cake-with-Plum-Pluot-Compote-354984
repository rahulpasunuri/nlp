Hey, Santa Fe---- Your cake fell NOT because of your addition of the right amount of sugar, but because you are at HIGH ALTITUDE! Don't be afraid of sugar, but always add a bit more flour to any recipe at high altitude! Please believe me, I am a pastry Chef in Angel Fire!! 505 forever!!!! :)

I made this for a picnic on Memorial Day. It was a huge success -- there wasn't any left to take home! I also used fat free half and half (forgot to buy the real stuff) and apricots and plums (couldn't find pluots). Grating the fresh nutmeg is key!

I used the full amount of sugar, which I normally don't do, so the loaf cake fell in the middle, but it certainly didn't harm the flavor. Lighter texture than the usual pound cake, I thought, and the plum compote was exceptional!

Too hot to bake, so used an angel food cake from whole foods. I have been searching for a nice compot recipe, and this one is easy, and fresh. Nice addition to any cake.

I have always wanted to try a pluot. Costco sold them by the box and I have now had a pluot. Pretty looking, tasty, worked well in this recipe but supposedly a plum and an apricot - how about 80% plum and maybe 20% apricot. My taste testor is 4 years old - loved both raw pluots and the compote so this is now a family recipe.
