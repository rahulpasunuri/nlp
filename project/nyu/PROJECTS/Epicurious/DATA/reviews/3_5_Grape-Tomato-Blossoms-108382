If you struggle with the tie, or are short on time, they hold together nicely without them. This is one of my favorite standbys for parties - few ingredients, quick to make, nice looking, and of course, yummers.

Made these for Christmas appetizer and everyone loved the presentation. Could not find Boursin cheese on Christmas eve so I substituted Vegetable cream cheese and no one knew the difference.

Everyone loved these! Wrapping the chive was much easier than I expected. Make sure the grape tomatoes are normal size-I used "miniature" grape tomatoes and they were too small. Cherry tomatoes are too big.

These were wonderful! Time consuming, but not once you got the hang of it. The key is to make sure you have very thinly sliced salami and the Boursin cheese is a MUST! I'm making these again for my next dinner party.

A bit of work to assemble these, but WELL worth it. These vanished quickly at my cocktail party, to rave reviews!

I have made this recipe several times. It is a "show- stopper" each time and is gone before any of the other appetizers. It's hard to find a pretty, fresh and tasty appetizer and this one fits the bill! Just pop one in your mouth for a sumptious suprise! If you can't find the "long" chives, I have tied two shorter ones together to make the tie.

another big hit... I didn't find them too difficult to make, quite easy actually, I used a bit more cheese in each, ic acted as kind of a glue to hold it together with the chive just as more of a decoration....

Does not worth the effort. Cheese was good though - will use it with crackers.

This was a great presentation. The trick here is having help. Someone else wrapping the chive makes all the difference. Great taste and worth the effort!!!
