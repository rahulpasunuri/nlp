Delicious and really easy. Definitely sautee the leeks until they're really tender, though, unless you like a little more texture. Very tasty!

Leeks needed more time but not a problem. Added more milk, which gave more smooth result. It's a nice alternative to the otherwise bland mash but not terribly exciting. Not impressed.

This is a great alternative to mashed potatoes. I had something like it at a restaurant and wanted to try it myself. I had never cooked leeks before, but this dish was easy and it was well, well worth the extra step. I really see this becoming a staple. I did use chicken broth instead of milk, but it was the leeks and potatoes that gave this such great flavor. If you have never had leeks and mashed potatoes before I really suggest you give it a try!

The potatoes were very good served as a side dish to filet mignon w/ merlot sauce. I made the mistake of not adding enough salt, but I'll correct that next time.
