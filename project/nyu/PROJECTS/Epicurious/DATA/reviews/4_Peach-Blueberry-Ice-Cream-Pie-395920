This was delightful! I used all natural ingredients, including Alden's Organic Peaches and Cream ice cream. The only modification I made was I substituted the fresh whipped cream for TruWhip (a lower fat, low-calorie, all-natural whipped topping (and healthier alternative to CoolWhip). I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious with pistachio ice cream as well. The ginger is a real added treat.
