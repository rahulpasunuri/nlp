This was great, though I did make it with some modifications. First, I highly recommend in place of the one garlic clove to roast several peeled garlic cloves in foil or parchment on the top rack of the oven while roasting the potatoes---chop those up and scatter over the top of the dish. It was fine with just plain ole mushrooms. I used spinach, with the drizzle of vinegrette, added the warm potatoes on top to wilt spinach a bit, mounded herbed mushrooms in center, scattered raosted garlic around, and served along side grilled steak. Next time, I'll try thyme as the herb. Hmm..and maybe just a small dollop of goat or slice of blue cheese! Oh..and I recommend more vinegrette, like 1.5 times the said amount.

Very, very good. A nice variation on serving potatos and a salad with a meal. Very easy to make. I would double the vinaigrette next time for those who want more. Otherwise... a real keeper!
