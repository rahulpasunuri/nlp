With a few modifications, this recipe turned out absolutely exquisite. Better, in fact, than the green curry I usually order at my favorite Thai restaurants. Here's what I did: In place of the red bell peppers, I would add green peppers and jalapeno (only for spice- lovers). I added some cayenne for more intensity (again, for those who can handle the spice) and toasted up a handful of cashews which were then added to the curry at the end. The natural sweetness of the cashews complimented the peas and sweet potato nicely. I should also note that I did not peel the potatoes, as I prefer to eat mine with the peel; besides, a lot of fiber and nutrients are lost when one discards the peel of such root vegetables. Finally, the curry needs to be salted properly to taste; the amount of salt needed was not indicated on the original recipe but in my case, I only used about 1/4 of a teaspoon. Not much but it made all the difference between bland and flavorful.

I used almost all the suggestions (fish sauce, more salt and pepper, carrots, that basil, green onions) and added some broccoli and some fresh corn that I got from the farmer's market. Delicious!

This recipe can be used well as a base, but it really must be spiced up. It's great if you add salt and spices to flavor. I agree with the cook from Palo Alto. There are many spices that one can use- ginger root, garam masala, cardomom all help, as does LIME. Basically, for those who are reading reviews and getting confused, both sides are right. It is bland, but easily spiced up with a little imagination, and worth it.

Nearly flavorless. Definitely nothing special, even with double the green curry and some extra garlic. Fish sauce may not be be vegetarian, but at least it would add some flavor!

Okay, so I haven't made this yet, but it does kind of bother me that so many people suggest adding fish sauce "like it ain't no thing" when this is clearly meant to be a vegetarian recipe. I appreciate the cook from Somerville's suggestions for vegetarian alterations to the recipe.

This recipe is a good outline, but it requires some tweaking. I substituted chicken broth for the water, and added some different veggies for more variation. Also when adding salt and pepper at the beginning, kinda go nuts, because it needs to be saltier than you'd think. Don't use low fat coconut milk, because it's just watered down coconut milk and will just make it too bland. I also added a little fish sauce, but I'm not sure if I could even taste it in there. Lastly, it's kinda picky, but next time I'm going to make it in a wok, because my frying pan was pretty full. By the end it wasn't quite as good as my local thai take-out place, and it definitely wasn't vegetarian anymore, but it was tasty.

I've made this dish for several friends who all loved it. One of them happens to be Indian and said that although this is a "Thai" curry, it's very like some of the dishes he had growing up. I add sliced carrots (they, like the sweet potatoes, balance the heat), asparagus, baby bella mushrooms that I sautee with the onion, and, yes, extra curry sauce along with the recommended veggies in the recipe. It IS very spicy but delicious. I like to serve with a chilled Gewurtraminer or Reisling which compliments, cools and balances.

I think this dish was AMAZING! I made it exactly as it says but added a little extra green curry paste (i like it spicy) and a tiny bit of ginger for an extra dimension to it. It was so esay and quick, and the ingredients are found at any store... Will absolutely make it again (many times!)

This dish is flat. It tastes like coconut milk and curry paste (go figure :o)

This is a good recipe for those who don't want to eat fish sauce or sugar. There's tons of Thai curries on this site that have those ingredients. Instead of making the modifications suggested by the other reviewers, try using fresh basil, ginger, and green onions. You can use any mix of vegetables and serve with jasmine rice or rice noodles

Loved this. Major hit with everyone. A great addition to my Thai cooking. I agree with previous cook though - added some fish sauce, brown sugar, and changed the cilantro to (any kind of) fresh chopped Basil. I also added some uncooked prawns. Careful on the amount of thai paste though - more than 2 TBS can make it quite hot. Yummy on a bed of sprouts.

First try was so-so. It was spicey hot using the given amount of curry paste, but the flavor was very single note. Next time I will try to round out the flavor using some of the suggestions here (fish sauce, thai basil, brown sugar).

This was easy and fast, and tasted really good. Like several below reviews, I added Thai basil, and increased the amount of green curry to make it a little bit stronger. The friend I made it for also loved it.

This is a wonderful recipe! Of course, after a few authentic alterations. I used prik khing curry paste, kaffir lime leaves and a stalk of lemongrass to the body of the recipe. before serving, I strongly recommend seasoning to taste with a dash of fish sauce, Thai basil and a splash of soy. Spooned a top a slaw of bean sprouts, cilantro and green onions with a side of brown basmati...yummy! I believe you have found a keeper! Bon Appetite!

This was fabulous! Didn't have sweet potatoes but added courgettes, aubergines, shitake mushrooms and prawns. Really nice and incredibly easy, will make again and again.

This was a very easy, tasty dish. I used green beans instead of snow peas, a mix of red and green bell peppers, and Thai basil instead of cilantro. I also added some thinly sliced tofu to make it more of a full meal. The curry paste made all the difference-- it gave it great spicy Thai kick. I'll probably make this often.

I made this recipe years ago when it first appeared in Gourmet. I've made it many times since. It's a staple for my husband and me during the colder months. It's hot , savory and nutritiuos. If you can't taste the curry, you've definitely done something wrong!

I have made a delicious green curry with vegetables that is not quite the same recipe. I use about 3tbsp thai virgin fish sauce, 1/4 cup fresh basil, 2tbsp brown sugar, coconut milk (i usually use lite) and Thai Kitchen green curry paste. I found that the best vegetables that go with it are broccoli, asparagus, green beans etc. My whole family loves it

I got a little carried away with the curry paste, so I'll be more careful next time ! This dish is not fantastic, but I'm always looking for interesting vegetable recipes, and my husband had seconds, so I will make again.

The quality of curry paste probably makes a big difference since that's the overwhelming taste. I used Thai Kitchen's; everything tasted great. Also, the final simmering took me at least 10 minutes, so plan accordingly. Yummy w/basmati rice.

it is not a terrible recipe; it just needs some tweaking. I found the flavours subtle to the point of non-existent. A nice Thai curry has two flavours e.g. sweet + hot.

awful, no taste. Needed salt but no matter how much I added it didn't pick up the taste. Will not make it again.

This was easy for a weeknight dinner. I thought it was tasty, but nothing to write home about.

Play with the vegetables...the snow peas at the market looked a little weak, so I substituted zuchinni. Also, start slow the the green curry paste; they vary in hotness from brand to brand, and with freshness. On the advice of another reviewed I loaded it up with the curry paste and it was almost too hot. Luckily my fellow diners like their taste-buds spanked!

This is a good recipe with a few adjustments. First you only need half the amount of coconut milk and at least double the amount of green curry. I tripled it for a little spicier taste. A good vegetarian dish.
