I made this dish last night and we truly enjoyed with one change. I had some white balsamic vinegar that I used instead of the sherry vinegar. I thought that the vinegar with the lemon made a refreshing change to this recipe. It was great for a hot summer night and we enjoyed grilling the onions as well. Very tasty!

I have made this salad time and time again, it's a classic and can be served fall through spring. I've substituted different types of vinegar in the dressing & it works well with most any kind.

the dressing was rather boring, but i enjoyed the grilled onions with the goat cheese. i also added cranberries, which made it much more interesting.

A delicious combination of cold and hot on the same salad plate. All the tastes worked perfectly together. Wil make this again soon.
