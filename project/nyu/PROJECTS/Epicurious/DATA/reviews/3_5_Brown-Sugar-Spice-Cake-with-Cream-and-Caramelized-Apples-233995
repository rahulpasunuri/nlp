Wonderful :) I also made this as an upside down cake. To do so I preped the pie dish with only non-stick parchment paper. I cooked the apples for only half the amount of time in the pan since they would also cook in the oven. After arranging the apples on the paper, I dropped the batter on top. Flipping this over was super easy due to using the paper. I warmed the apple carmel sauce and poured over the top of the whole cake before serving. It was really wonderful and an impressive presentation.

Delicious. I don't know what Grade B maple syrup is so I just used the syrup I had but only had 1/4 cup so added 1/4 of honey. Still wonderful. Makes way more whipped cream than you'll need though so cut that in half.

Wonderful flavor in the cake. Nice and moist. I used granny smith apples to combat the sweetness of the butter and sugar. Great combo - got rave reviews from the fam.

I found it to be a nice light dessert, the icing isn't very sweet and goes nicely with the cake. It was really good when it was fresh from the oven, it wasn't as moist the next day.

Oh wow... even without the apple topping, this was fabulous (I made the apples, but they didn't last beyond the first day, and the cake did, so...) A bit on the dry side, but still a great snacking cake, breakfast cake, or whenever the mood strikes cake.

Made this without the cream as an upside-down cake: caramelized apples in a greased, parchment-lined pan, topped with the batter. I tweaked the spices a little, adding some cinnamon and ginger and reducing the cloves to a pinch. I agree, watch the baking time on this one to avoid dryness.

Easy and forgiving cake, I think. I doubled the recipe and made it in one 8x8 and two loafs; they all came out fine. I used NC Jonagolds -- my current favorite eating and baking apple -- and they were very tasty. I didn't pour all the syrup back on the apples at reheat, for moderation's sake, and the whole thing was quite sweet enough. Guests loved it!

This cake has yummy flavor and was easy to make. Baked for about 25 minutes and it is lovely and moist. Will definitely use that portion of this recipe again. The caramel sauce was pretty greasy for my taste, so I will look for another recipe for that. I followed the recipe exactly when trying to make the apples, and cooking them for that amount of time resulted in burned apples permanently glued to the bottom of my pan - wasn't even able to try them. Just gave up on that! I just used regular whipped cream, and it was fine.

Just took this to a potluck picnic and people raved about it and several asked for the recipe. I also baked it for 25 minutes--perfect. And I mixed up the apples. Will probably go with Granny Smiths entirely next time. 30 minutes was too long for the apples, but I did get them nice and caramelized at about 20-25 minutes. When I reheated them, I added some water to refresh them.

I read a couple great reviews and one iffy review before I tried this dish, but whoa! Yow! It was great. I had some company over and they loved it as well. To answer the dry cake concern I would recommend not mixing the batter too much and I checked it at 25 minutes instead of 35 and it came out moist and VERY flavorful. Even if yours comes out dry, the apples and brown sugar syrup will take care of that. This one will satisfy.

Very, very nice! Moist cake and the apples were perfect--a combination of Gala and Granny Smith in a cast-iron skillet was great: no mushing and great color. The only thing we didn't love was the sour/sweet cream topping.

Enjoyed this recipe, which I found easy and straightforward. I used Jonagored apples (not sure what those are in other countries) and they turned out beautifully, though I also cooked them longer than called for in the recipe. Had no allspice so used cinnamon, but otherwise followed the recipe (though I made it in a round cakepan instead of a square one and baked the cake for just 20 minutes). It was just a tad dry but that was offset by the lovely apples and sour cream sauce. The cake itself had a rich, spicy taste and I got compliments all around. I'd definitely make it again.

I made this recipe as written and everyone loved it, including my picky 11 year old. I loved the fact that I could do this in stages and disperse the work throughout the day. My only slight dissapointment was that the cake was dryer than I had hoped. But the addition of the carmelized apples balanced it very nicely. I used Braeburns (only ones I had on hand) and though they took a little longer to cook, they held their shape at the serving stage. All in all a great "homey" spice cake with flair.

I have to completely agree with the first reviewer -- this bad boy is one nice recipe. It sort of brings to mind a cakey Tarte Tatin. Never one to resist the chance to use alcohol, I added a generous splash of Calvados toward the end of the apple carmelization and man, was it good! Used a mix of Gala and Granny Smith apples and was glad I did because my Galas completely disintergrated for some reason (maybe they were a little old?). My version wasn't as pretty as Gourmet's picture, but I'll wager it was every bit as tasty. A great dessert for any occasion. Do serve apples and cake warmed.

My sister, on seeing the picture in the magazine this afternoon, jokingly asked me to make it. As it turned out, we had everything on hand. So I did. Mother of god, this is a good cake. I can't rate it 4 forks, simply because it's not "beyond compare". But it will definitely impress anyone you make it for. I added cinnamon to both the cake and the apples. Also to the apples, at the end, I added a splash of brandy. Served warm, a la mode, it was really awesome.
