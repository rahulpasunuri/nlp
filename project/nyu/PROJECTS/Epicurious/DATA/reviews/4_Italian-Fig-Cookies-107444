I've had this recipe on file for quite some time and have finally tried it out. The cookies are wonderful! They will definitely be added to my holiday repertoire. I followed the recipe as written. The rolling of the dough is a bit touchy, but I kept my surface lightly floured as too with the rolling pin and it came out fine. I kept my finger tips floured to help with the pinching - by the time you get to the 4th strip the dough is soft. I used all the scraps and hence was able to use all the filling. I suggest making up the glaze when the first batch is in the oven, that way it will be ready when those are warm. There are too many cookies to wait till the end, especially if you do one sheet at a time. If you want a white glaze don't use the OJ.

These cookies are so good. I had never made them before but did so for a bake-off this past holiday season. They took one of the top prizes from a group of - ahem - judges who tend to go for chocolate. Will definitely make them again.

based on the reviews, i was so excited to make these. i subbed spiced rum for the brandy, and let the fruit and nut mixture sit in the fridge for about a week, otherwise made these exactly as written. they were good, but for all of the work involved, not great. i had never had a cookie like this before and i felt like it was a glorified fig newton. the flavor was very good, i did enjoy the filling, but the cookie itself was a bit doughy for my taste. i think this filling would be good in a thumbprint cookie or some kind of pinwheel. i won't go to the trouble of making these "newtons" again.

This is a very authentic recipe. Have made them several times exactly as written. I use my pasta machine to make the dough into strips. Makes the assembly process very fast, especially when I make 4 or 5 times the recipe. You will not be dissatisfied!

I am not a fig newton fan but I adore these cookies. They take extra work but they are worth it. I sometimes double the filling and then freeze half so when I get the taste for them I can just thaw out the filling and make up a batch. Rolling out the dough is sticky work but I use a mix of powdered sugar and flour to keep the dough from being as sticky. Either way the dough is quite forgiving, try opposite of pie dough.

These are completely delightful! The filling will keep in the fridge for quite awhile. This recipe is on the "I can't get enough of these" list...

Outstanding! The only change I made to the ingredients was to substitute half of the flour with whole-wheat flour. Aside from making these a bit more healthy, it gave a little more texture to the dough, which made the glaze and sprinkles even more attractive. I followed the directions to the letter, using a ruler to measure the pieces of dough and a measuring cup to measure the filling. As others have said, you end up with extra dough. I wouldn't reduce the amount of filling in the logs. Instead, next time I'm making 1 1/2 times the filling. I cut each log into 6 pieces (a little shorter than called for) and ended up with 60 cookies I used a pastry cloth, and I covered my rolling pin with a sock -- both rubbed thoroughly with flour. I had no problem at all with the dough sticking. I also didn't have any problem with the oozing that some cooks mentioned. I definitely concur with those who said to make these cookies over two days. They're not hard, but they are time-consuming

Forgot to add - filling recipe seems forgiving of substitutions. I was 1/4 c short on honey, so used some homemade quince jelly to make up the difference. I was also short on one of the spices, so I made adjustments there too, and used zests of one orange and one lemon respectively (1/2 to 1 tsp more of each zest than called for). They're a lot of work, but the taste is worth it to me.

Just made these again (3rd time) - observations: 1. the dough will stick, no matter what you try - lots of flour and an offset spatula are your friends. 2. twice, I have had to scrape a thin coating of dough from my pin once forming was done (and yes, I had floured it) - it could be something with the seasoning of the pin though. And on the bright side, the dough didn't stick to the pin at all once the coating formed. 3. For the glaze, forget 1-2 tbsp of juice, as that gives you paste. Try the juice of half an orange, and see how it goes from there. 4. I noted the trimmings, when rolled, rolled out smoother, but also the edges did not adhere quite as well. This might be why they caution to roll the trimmings only once. 5. I ended up with more dough than filling (minor quibble) 6. the glaze really manages to give the cookies a nicer appearance. I'd do it again in future. 7. yield is excellent - I got 78 cookies from my batch.

My Italian grandmother used to make a similar cookie. I've had a handwritten copy of her recipe for about 20 years (with some blanks, such as baking instructions, which lead me to this search when finally deciding to try it.) While the figs,raisins, almonds, walnuts and orange/lemon zest, cinnamon are similar -- Grandma Buonocore also added chocolate chips, allspice, pepper and candied fruit. She used maple syrup instead of honey and added a jar of black current jelly. Her instructions also call for preparing the filling 4 weeks in advance of baking. I mixed up the filling yesterday, and tasted in stages as the ingredient list grew. I have to say, the final product of fruit/nut mixture is excellent. Grandma omitted any alcohol, but I am going to divide the batch and try brandy in half/no alcohol in the other, then compare. The dough sounds very similar, including adding lots of baking powder and milk. Glad to find this reference to compare with and fill in blanks from my Grandmother's original. I'll be baking right before Christmas.

Unique, elegant, and delicious. I couldn't stop eating them. We like them with rum in place of the brandy. A bit of extra lemon and orange zest seems to intensify the filling flavor. The icing is a necessary finishing touch. If you want to dress them up a bit, sprinkle a little natural cane sugar on top.

4 enthusiastic forks. Honestly, not that much work, just a little time consuming. I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies are great. The only change was to throw a little freshly squeezed grapefruit juice in the icing (I had run out of orange juice). In the future I will make 1 1/2 of what the recipe calls for of the filling. I'm also curious how orange marmalade would taste in the filling based on the comments of a couple of reviewers and some other recipes I read. Not too many problems rolling out the dough, but I rolled it on parchment paper per other suggestions. These do not disappoint.

When I was young, my Sicilian piano teacher, who was an old friend of my parents, made these cookies. They were like heaven. My mother got the recipe from her years ago but never ended up making them herself. So when I started baking prolifically at Christmas, I asked Mom for the recipe. Among the usual things, it called for a jar of pickled watermelon rind. Now this lady (my piano teacher) made everything herself, so I decided that's what I needed to do. Besides, if you can even find pickled watermelon rind at a store, it always has lots of nasty preservatives in it. So four summers ago, I got a big seeded watermelon and saved all the rind. I went to my local Mexican grocery and bought a pound of calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) for a dollar to keep the rinds crisp after canning. (Believe me, that was really cheap. And now I have enough slaked lime to last me the rest of my life.) I pickled six jars of watermelon rind. I've still got two left. It gives these cookies a certain undefinable flavor. I sort of make up the filling as I go along. The dough in this Gourmet recipe, however, surpasses that of the piano teacher (Sorry, Nicki!). Make these cookies now. You won't regret it. Also, some posters here seem to have a problem with the filling oozing out. I always use scissors to snip two vents in the top of each cookie. I'm not sure if that's why mine don't ooze, because I never made them without snipping, but it's worth a try. I also like the way it looks.

I have made the filling several times and find it to be very versatile. I use it with a variety of pastry doughs such as:rugelah, phyllo and in miniature tartlets. I have also used the filling to stuff chicken breasts. Each time the results have been great. I have not used the icing as I find the filling sweet enough.

Sweet mericful YUM!! I am still chewing one as I type. I had never heard of this cookie before, but after reading the reviews and being a fig lover, I gave it a shot. Dang Y'all! They are some kinda good! Not difficult to make either, always a plus. I will say I had way more dough than filling though. Next time I will double the filling. However with all the left over dough, I rolled out and made sandwich cookies. One dozen filled with apple butter topped with a toasted almond and one dozen filled with cranberry relish, apple butter and cream cheese topped with a toasted walnut piece. As a little extra, I added a splash of apple brandy to the icing. And again I say YUM!!! Make these and enjoy your holiday!

I made exactly as directed (though I only iced half the batch). I did the filling first, and let it sit in the fridge for a week. I made the dough the day before I planned to bake. This is a very labour- intensive recipe - the dough really tended to stick, and I was left with a thin dough residue covering my rolling pin (scraped it off with the blunt edge of a knife). However, the flavour is rich, and as one reviewer put it, 'it tastes like Christmas' - the filling is like a very good panforte or mincemeat tart. I found the trimmings rolled like a dream in comparison to the initial roll. I lined my cookie sheets with parchment, and had no trouble with the cookies sticking to the pan. I also did not have any trouble with oozing filling. The yield was crazy - I ended up with almost nine dozen cookies. A lot of work, but very tasty, and hey - it's only once a year :-)

GREAT COOKIES!!!!!!! Will make again and again. Well worth all the work. I used only almonds, and no walnuts. The icing is better without the oj. Substituted orange marmalaid for the honey. Also used half dark and half white raisins.

I made these for the past 2 Christmas holidays and plan to make them again this year. Four years ago, I tried a different recipe and it was not nearly as good as these. I started making them as a gift for my hair stylist who spoke of his grandmother's fig cookies - my Sicilian family never made them. He hoards my gift from his family and now I have to double the recipe. Thank You!

These are traditional Sicillian Christmas cookies. This recipe is very good but I am Sicillian and we have always made them with 2 cups figs, 1/2 cup raisins, 1/2 cup honey, walnuts only, and the rind and juice of a small tangerine. The big thing that is missing here is 4 ounces of quality dark chocolate. I don't really enjoy them without it. Try it as a variation on this recipe, you'll love it.

I have been looking all over for a recipe like this since my husband's aunt moved away and no longer makes these for Christmas Eve. Our family is Italian and we love these cookies! I was SO surprised at how incredibly easy these were to make! They didn't take long at all -- especially since you have to chill the dough and filling first. This broke up the process for me and made it more enjoyable! I would definitely make these again -- my grandmother tried them and absoultely loved them! That's saying something! Thank you for the tradition that you have created in our family once again Epicurious!

The star of this show is the filling, not the dough. It reminds me of panforte with all the fruit and nuts. I doubled the recipe because everyone raved about this recipe. I followed it exactly, except for not having brandy, so I subbed orange juice and rum extract. Do yourself a favour and make the dough and filling in the food processor. You will save yourself so much time! Also, I let my filling and dough sit in the fridge for 3 days. It really seems like alot of work but it isn't if you make the dough ahead and bake another day. I also tried the thumbprints at first because I read of others doing that. I don't recommend it. You don't get an even amount of filling and dough in each bite and the dough just isn't that great on its own. Do the extra step and roll & cut it- it's not that hard! My dough and filling did not spread like others- I wouldn't add extra liquid. It should be a fairly dry mixture as the dried fruit absorbs the liquid. Also, brush on the icing a few minutes after they come out of the oven and use sprinkles! I didn't think it would need the sprinkles but it really does add something! I will definitely make these again but I can also see possibilities of this mixture in phyllo (a greek-inspired rendition)and/or puff pastry (for something a little more similar)!

There's a very good reason this recipe has gotten a four-forks rating rather consistently: it's divine! I, too, made these in thumbprint fashion the first time, since I could see how soft the dough was. I filled the thumbprints quite full of the marvelous fig filling, but still didn't use but about 1/3 of the filling, even though I used ALL the dough. So I'm going to try again with the rest of the filling, and will also probably make another batch or two of these this Christmas season. Several other reviewers said these cookies "taste like Christmas," and that is so right on! I changed nothing in this recipe -- nothing! -- and it's absolutely perfect as is. I feel so blessed to have found this amazing recipe. Merry Christmas to all!

I came across this recipe while searching for something new to make with fresh figs. Even though this called for dried AND is pretty much a Christmas cookie, I decided to go for it, and I'm glad I did. Yum! I used 8 oz of fresh figs instead of dried and was worried the filling would be watery, but it came out fine. I also realized too late that i was out of brandy, so I substituted a Tbls each of amaretto and dark rum, figuring I should cut the liquid back a little, anyway. I also took the shortcut of making thumbprint versions and they came out great. the dough made 6 dozen cookies and i have about 1/2 cup of filling left over. I put the icing in a ziploc bag and snipped the corner, then piped it over the cookies in a zigzag. they look and taste great!

These cookies are mind-blowing delicious. And not at all difficult if you spread the labor out over a few days. Our Xmas party is Sunday, and I wish I had time to make another batch. Word to the wise: the dough makes six dozen cookies, the filling is adequate for no more than five dozen cookies, and the icing can be stretched to four dozen cookies at most. Adjust your plans accordingly. Next year I'll know better.

I have to preface this by saying normally I hate cookie baking, particularly at Christmas. However, these little cookies are so good I can make them every year with out fussing. They are a bit involved, but they really are so worth it. The cookies are just sweet enough without being overly sweet. My only variation on the recipe is to add a pinch of cardomon in with the cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.

Oh. My Gosh. These are the most amazing cookies I have ever eaten!! The first time I made them, I knew there would be a repeat performance. They are a new Christmas tradition, they're that good!! All of the flavours are so wonderfully blended, that even one ingredient could alter these delicious little puppies. To the person who gave only two forks, tsk tsk - try them properly because changing the recipe definitely, well, changes the recipe!! Kudos to Epicurious!!! Keep up the great work. :-)

Wowwee-wow-wow-wow! I had an extra case of fresh figs and this is how I "got rid of them". Outragous. Robust, yet delicate. I have made new friends AND influenced people with this crowd pleaser. I did omit the walnut and did NOT substitue with additional almond. This did not compromise its viscosity. However, I did wait until the whole "log" cooled before cutting it. Beautiful, beautiful cookie. (As I multiplied the recipe by 10, I shoud be all set for Christmas preperation. Filling and dough frozen before assembling and baking, of course...)

I haven't made this particular recipe, but I have been eating this cookie at my grandmother's house my whole life. So yummy! This recipe is nearly identical to Lucy's. Her tip is to let the fig mixture to sit in the fridge (tightly sealed) for several weeks. You can always add more brandy if it gets dry.

My grandmother was in the local newspaper for her rendition on these cookies, so the competition was going to be steep. I was very surprised.I left the clove out and added some semi sweet chocolate chips. The dough was wonderful. I followed the instructions on filling and rolling and had just enough with no oozing of the filling.Delicious.Bravo! Grandmas recipe said to bake it whole and cut into individual cookies while hot. This was much easier.I made a few cookies with just the dough and they were yummy. I'm keeping this recipe for future reference.Just keep the dough chilled and it will be no problem rolling.

I just finished making these cookies. I made the dough and filling last night. I thought the process of assembling the cookies was messy, but not too difficult. After reading all of the reviews, I'm dissappointed to find that I really do not like these cookies. I wonder if I put in to much clove. It is really overpowering. I also ommitted the brandy and walnuts and used extra toasted almonds. The dough rolled out nicely, the filling didn't ooze. Should have been a perfect cookie! I will drizzle a bit of almond icing on top. Perhaps that will balance out the pow from the filling.

I recommend this recipe, as well as preparing the filling and dough 1-2 days before you assemble the cookies. It will not seem like such a daunting endeavor and may be the only way to do it with small kids in your kitchen! I found that my filling way too dry and crumbly and thus did not go far enough. I eventually added water (but orange juice would probably be good) to soften to more of a paste (maybe my figs were too dry to start?). I did not have any problems with the filling oozing and I thought the cookies looked great. The dough rolled out like a dream after 1.5 days--be sure to keep your rolling surface well floured, though. I used the suggestion of chocolate chips to extend the filling for my dough scraps and this too was great!

I loved the taste of the filling, but I had a lot of trouble rolling out the dough. It got really soft and stuck to the floured countertop. I took another lister's "easy way out" and made thumbprint cookies. Hopefully that will work out - they are in the oven right now. I may put the extra filling in a crostata dough.

I took the lazy way out and still had wonderful cookies and plenty of filling to go around!

I made the cookies as part of a tray for our Italian wedding.

I thought this was a great recipe! It was a lot of fun to put together. Instead of rolling out the dough, I found a better way, however. I made ropes out of about 1/2 cup of dough, then rolled them out and cut them into 3 1/2 inch strips. It was much easier to handle this way.

I couldn't have been more pleased with this recipe...it does truly taste like Christmas! The process is a bit lengthy but I made the filling the night before to let it marinate. The actual baking of the cookies didn't take long at all. I plan on making these again next year! Deelish!

These are much easier than the recipe may make them seem, and worth the effort. I do have some tips. One, use a SCANT 1/3 cup of filling for the cookies. I was left with nearly half the dough and no filling. Second, use parchament paper because a little filling will goo out as they bake. These are a sophisticated and yummy cookie, and they also offer some nutrition in the raisins, nuts, and figs. So have fun.

They are not pretty, but they pack a flavor punch. I used Nick Malgieri's filling recipe from his Italian Desserts cookbook with this dough, and they did not leak (he uses a smaller amount of jam instead of honey). The rolling and cutting instructions are great in this recipe, and I was able to cut them in 1-inch lengths to squeeze a greater yield out of it. I did, however, run out of icing using recipe as written.

What a fabulous blend of flavors but they fell a little short in the looks department. Was it me? I'm far from a good baker so I'm asking for advice. My cookies flattened out much more than I anticipated and the filling leaked a lot. Is this normal? They taste GREAT but how can I improve their appearance? I would love to perfect these gems. This recipe is a keeper!

Just made these today and they are FABULOUS! All the flavors in the filling meld together wonderfully.

Try this, you won't be sorry!

My husband calls it a "home run", and my 9-year old says it "tastes like Christmas". I followed the recipe exactly as written and found that it is very time consuming, but well worth the effort. The key is to use plenty of flour when working the dough. The cookies made from the scrap pieces of dough turned out looking the best, probably because the dough contained more flour. This recipe is a keeper and I will definitely make this again (and again)!
