We all loved this recipe. My husband ate it and he never eats the veggies. I think this would be good just as croutons or just broccoli. Great!

We have been making this recipe since it first appeared in Bon Appetit Magazine. It's our favorite way to make broccoli. The trick is to toast the bread cubes well and to go light with the water. If we don't have pan drippings, I use beef bouillon in a little water at the end. However, lucky us - today we're making this with prime rib, so we'll have plenty of drippings.

Delicious and easy--was a crowd pleaser for a casual Halloween dinner party!

We had this at a dinner party last year and I am making it again. We had 10 people and even non broccoli eaters liked it. If yours was soggy something went wrong,ours was delicious.

I thought this was a great side dish- something different than ordinary broccolli. Very flavorful & goes beautifully with the bacon wrapped beef tenderloin

Perfect accompaniment to tenderloin. We were sceptical when making it but we all loved it!

forget the bread and just steam your broccoli in the chilies and garlic. Most of the time, the broccoli never makes it to our plates. We eat it all right out of the pan. I split open the chilies after a while to make sure the spicy flavor really hits you.

This was a delicious dish. I used the arbol chilis, as is. The recipe did not say to soak them or chop them up, so I didn't. I couldn't tell how much flavor they added, but I am making it again for a dinner party, so I will pay a bit more attention.

I totally disagree w/ the other reviewers. I loved this recipe and had no problem fitting it in my large deep skillet. The bread did get a bit soggy but the flavor was amazing. I would try this again.

First of all, unless you have a gigantic skillet, 2 and 1/2 pounds of broccoli florets and 12 oz. of toasted bread will not fit. Had to move it to a stockpot in order to get the ingredients in. I enjoyed the spiciness of the chilies on the brocolli, but this dish just didn't do anything for us. No one wanted to eat it again. Save your tastebuds and server your broccoli and bread separately.

Hi, Just tested this and we're making it for a dinner party. Maybe the trick is really cooking the bread long enough, but ours turned out crispy and chewy. The broccoli was perfectly cooked and flavorful. Neat way to combine veggie and starch.

If you love bread pudding, you _might_ like this recipe. But let me paint a picture - A skillet full of wet, soggy bread, chilies, and broccoli. Oh.. wait.. maybe it will be better if I pour the reserves from the roast (which was awesome BTW)on toip of it... Nope! Just made it even more soggy. We even tried to eat, but after two bites I felt like I was eating a four day old salad with wet crotons... DISGUSTING!
