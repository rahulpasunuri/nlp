With added ginger and a bit of sour cream, this was excellent when made with boneless skinless chicken breasts, chicken broth and a can of roasted red pepper tomatoes. My husband said he could each this over and over.

Excellent. Used veggie broth for half water, added ginger, and halved cayenne since serving to kids - excellent!

This reminds me a lot of a dish an African student made when I was in college. I immediately added ginger with the garlic. I had plenty of room for veggies in the sauce, so skipped the step of removing the chicken. You can substitute lots of option (carrots, potatoes, etc). Remember to add salt along the way. I agree that chicken skin was not crispy, but simply removed it before serving. I don't eat the skin anyway. Will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe for the most part, but for the effort I was disappointed with the results. In stead of chicken pieces I cut up skinless, boneless chicken breasts (as that what I had handy). I used some of the suggestions from earlier reviewers, using chicken broth instead of water, adding more garlic, and substituting parsnips for turnips. As I did not have an oven-proof lid, and since the chicken was boneless, I did not put the pot in the oven, but simmered on top of the stove. I liked the sauce and the chicken (though slightly overdone), but the vegetables were so-so. Not sure if my changes contributed to the lest than stellar flavors, but I would not want to cook using the chicken skin. Like I said, lots of work for an average meal.

bland. tried adding salt, red pepper flakes and, finally, lime juice and nothing seemed to jumpstart it into flavor. maybe too much peanut butter? not going to bother trying it again, too many other tantalizing recipes to try.

whoever said this dish just misses greatness is so right on. It looks fantastic and like it should have a wonderfully complex flavor. However, the result, as written, is very one dimensional. If someone is going to spend this much time carefully crafting their dinner it should provide a wow to the mouth. Sadly, this dish falls short. A few reviewers have added ginger to remedy the problem, but I am considering playing with some curries. I realize curry will completely change the flavor profile, but unfortunately it is needed here. I give this 3 stars because I love the ingredients, it looks beautiful and has fabulous potential.

Everyone at the table loved this dish. Some took 3 servings! I did not like the way it looked and kept adding paprika and tabasco for color and flavor.

My family and I loved this dish. I sauted boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and then cut them up into bite sized portions. Definitely a winner!

Made it in the slow cooker and it turned out great. I even skipped the browning step, just threw everything except the spinach in the pot for seven hours on low. The house smelled great when I got home, especially the sweet potato! Then added spinach (I used frozen) for another hour. I'm sure it'd be even better with the browning step, but I didn't have time for it, and it's good to know it works without it. I'll definitely be making this again. It fit into a large slow cooker, though I should say that I only used 2.5 lbs of chicken - still plenty, but we're just not that big on meat.

Fabulous recipe - a great hit in my picky household. We don't have any pans that are oven worthy, so I simmered it on the stove-top with a lid on the pan. It worked very well, the chicken was even falling off the bone it was so tender!

These flavours don't really mix that well. It tastes what I imagine a lot of American cuisine tastes like. altered versions of better dishes to accommodate a sweeter tooth. bleh.

This was enjoyed immensely in our house! Hubby put it very high on the to-make-again list. Used Trader Joe's organic creamy peanut butter and chicken broth over water (as others suggested). Also used boneless breasts - the idea of the soggy skin (mentioned in other reviews) was not worth the risk (and extra fat) for me. Cooked in over for 35 minutes instead of the full time - will reduce the time even more next time as the chicken was inching toward dry. Also used carrots instead of of turnips. So, a lot of minor modifications - but the sauce (the essence of the recipe) is very, very tasty. Did the full amount of cayenne and it had a kick, but I would not describe it as overpoweringly spicy. Great way to get lots of veggies in - for the pickier husbands who think they don't like veggies :)

Just wondering if anyone has made this using a slow cooker? I'm going to make it for dinner and like the idea of just adding everything to one pot.

I used walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, pecans and peanut butter for the peanut mixture.(i think i will use just peanut butter next time) Didnt have turnips so i followed the cabbage suggestion(thank you). When adding the yam i also added some cut up avocado, and it compliements the nutty flavor of this dish.

Amazing dish...the aroma is intoxicating and it is great if you are on a budget. I used 1/2 water and 1/2 white wine and chicken broth. Also, doubled the garlic and spinach as well as adding 2 tbs. of leftover fresh basil from last night! For fun we raided the fridge and also added some asparagus...really good!

Wonderful dish. I used only 1 1/2 pounds of chicken breast and it turned out great. At the end I added two spicy chicken bouillon cubes to give the dish a little kick.

This was a surprisingly good meal, and very different. Easy to put together, great one pot stew. The only change I made was adding a bit of fresh ginger. Next time I would increase the heat with more cayenne. Highly recommended.

I make this all the time! It is a wonderful dish that my guests rave about. It is great for feeding a lot of people on a small budget (I bought the best chicken and still spent less than $40 to feed seven people with leftovers). I usually don't buy all five pounds. Three is usually enough though I go as high as four pounds when I have guests. The leftovers are great. I add the ginger and I double the spinach because everybody loves it. I even forgot the tomatoes once and it was still great. I accidentally picked up some rutabagas instead of turnips once and I think they taste much better. Give it a shot.

This was ok. My 13 year old son wanted to cook and this was a good choice, using everyday ingredients. Added the ginger as others suggested along with Kecap Manis( Indonesian sweet soya sauce). An ok family night meal- nothing to get too enthused about. Requires Sambal for adults!

I'm surprised that it didn't call for soy sauce because it needed it! Don't care for the turnip idea. Carrots and cabbage make a nice substitute.

I really wanted to like this recipe, and I almost did, but there was something missing. It's a little bland, kind of makes you think of baby food with the softened sweet potatoes. I added ginger as per others' suggestions. Maybe some lemon juice to liven it up? It comes so close to greatness that it's driving me nuts I couldn't drive it home. Anyway, I made it at the end of a long day and just didn't have the energy to fiddle with the seasoning any longer.

Delicious! I served this with the pinenut/green onion couscous from this website for a nice african themed meal, and all my guests went back for more. I used carrots and a can of drained chickpeas in place of the turnips, increased the peanut butter by 1/4 cup (as suggested previously) and removed the chicken from the bone for a nice stew.

Rating: 3
My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this stew. After reading the reviews, I used carrots and cabbage in place of the turnips and added a 1/4 cup extra peanut butter. I used chicken broth instead of water but I don't think that it added any additional flavor. After braising the chicken in the oven, I removed the meat from the bone, shredded it and put it back in the pot with the veggies -- very tender chicken and easier to eat that way! Next time, I will not reduce the sauce as it was pretty thick already. I loved the colors and the flavor of this dish.

Rating: 4
This was terrific! In order to intensify the flavor and decrease the simmering time, I doubled the amount of natural peanut butter and kept the same amount of water. The result is a GREAT consistency, and with a bowl of rice, it's absolutely satisfying. It could use more spice though.

Made this for a church potluck. Cooked the chicken and sauce day before and let it sit overnight. I think it helps with melding flavors. Also added the fresh ginger and substituted chickpeas for turnips. Lots of compliments!

This recipe is tasty and filling, but definitely needs more of a bite. I chopped up two canned chipotles adobo, but would add more next time. I also used a bag of prewashed and chopped mustard greens, which added a nice flavor.

Delicious! I almost passed this one up because the flavor/ingredient combination seemed so bizzare. Peanut butter and tomatoes? It really works, though. Made the whoe thing in under an hour on the stovetop. Cubed sauteed chicken breasts, diced veggies smaller, added 1T of fresh ginger, hot pepper flakes, tofu, duck broth instead of water. Colors and texures were perfect.

Rating: 4
The previous reviewer who recommended adding grated ginger was spot on--I'd say that's the missing link in the recipe. It balances the flavors and cuts the bland creaminess of the peanut butter. I used about a tablespoon (but I really love ginger). I substituted carrots for the turnips, and used pureed tomatoes instead of diced. I also had to add some sugar since my peanut butter was unsweetened. My sauce did not have to be reduced--the consistency was correct when the veggies were done. A local Senegalese restaurant makes this dish with tofu as well as chicken, so I'll be trying tofu next. yet another occasion for fabulous gluttony...

This took quite a bit more time than I anticipated and for how long it took, it was okay. My family liked it but... no one was crazy about it. I substituted garbanzo beans and peas for turnips. The dish was starchy and thick enough to not warrant rice. If I should make this again, I'd add brocolli and eliminate rice all together. Probably add ginger too.

Rating: 3
While I made a few changes, I think I can give a fair review since I think the changes were not hugely significant. I omitted the red pepper because my kids don't like it and since I had no turnips on hand, I substituted with a can of garbanzo beans, which my kids love. They really liked this dish and my two older ones (6 and 11) had seconds. I'm on a diet so didn't taste it, but from their reactions, I know it's definitely a keeper.

I didn't really like my version of this recipe, yet I gave it three forks because the basic idea is very good. Perhaps the fact that I used frozen spinach (and too much of it) caused it to be very slimy. And the peanut flavour was too bland, although I did use quite a lot. I also added loads of fresh parsley, which, rather surprisingly, went very well with the peanut flavour and the spinach. Maybe some chopped celery leaves will be nice as well. Anyway, I'm definitely going to try this one again.

This is a low 3. it is good and fililng, but with the reviews I was expecting more. IT makes a ton. I substituted Cabbage and carrotts for the turnips and added grated fresh ginger. it is very filling with the peanut butter. I liked the sweet potato in it as well. Enjoy

I made the peanut sauce separately, kind of following the recipe from Gourmet 1996 on this site. Used a "Quick Prep" mixer to blend flavors completely then just poured it in. Also added some curry powder and fresh ginger. Yum!!

This receipe is absolutely amazing. I shared some with my neighbors and they compared it to a high end restaurant dish. I've decided that this will be the dish that I will bring to my next potluck affair. It has a very lovely presentation as well because of the spinach.

Very very good. Boneless chicken breast is much easier to work with here. I used slightly less cayenne but when I make it again I'll use more. A great unusual recipe!

This was really good and easy! Using advice from below, I used four boneless breasts and cut them up before adding back to veggies. Braising time was a lot quicker too. Maybe 40 minutes max. I also used peanut butter and didn't need to reduce sauce at all. Reading about the cooking problems with turnips and sweet potatoes, I cubed them slightly smaller and all turned out perfect in 20 min. But remember to stir occasionally while simmering or your sauce can start to stick to bottom. From start to table, total time for us was about 1.5 hours.

This was really good. I left out the bell peppers since I really detest them. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and when I took them out of the braising liquid I cut them up into chunks and put them back in just before the spinach went in. I had no problem with messiness. Everyone but my daughter ate it and raved.

Very good and very different. Fans of Thai cuisine should love it. I hate turnips, so I left them out. I also used leftover chicken and washed baby spinach, which sped the process up considerably. I find this to be a very easy recipe to make as you can just put everything in the same pot. My wife loves it.

Nice flavor, but pretty time consuming. I agree with the previous reviewer - next time I will use boneless chicken for the convenience. Actually, this dish would be nice even without the chicken as a hearty vegetarian meal.

This is the kind of unusual recipe that is going to have lots of folks who love it and another camp that isn't all that impressed. I fall in the latter group, but I can see nonetheless how this dish would have its fans, mainly among those who love peanut butter. The taste and texture of the peanut butter utterly dominate here. There is none of the complex interplay of flavors and textures that to me is the mark of a standout recipe. This dish may fill a niche, however, as it might be just the thing for a buffet serving large numbers of hungry teenagers inexpensively. It is very filling, looks attractive, and would probably hold up well in a chafing dish. Otherwise, after reading about the problems that other cooks had with this burning the pan or making a real mess, I modified the technique slightly to good effect. I deglazed the pan with the water and got all the brown stuff scraped off the bottom of the pan before adding the peanut butter mixture, rather after, as called for in the recipe. It seemed to work because I had no problem with the pan. It probably helped that I used my trusty all clad brasier, as thin gauge cookware probably shouldn't be used for this recipe.

My husband was not sure about dinner when I told him that I was making an African chicken with peanut sauce for dinner. But, he quickly changed his mind when he tasted it. He asked me to make it again for company. That commet should rate this dish a "5 star". I found it to be very good, and easy to make. Definitely will make it again.

When I was in college back in 1982, I had a friend from Ghana, and he made this dish for me. I have always wanted to make it again, and this recipe provided great instructions. I cooked the chicken the first night, and then tried to skim off some of the fat before proceeding the next night. It was a little bit oily from the peanut butter. It is a wholesome and really satisfying meal. The spinach was the perfect compliment (very colorful), and the turnips/sweet potatoes were great. I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of cayenne, and found it to be barely spicy!

Rating: 4
I took the advice of a previous reviewer and used carrots and cabbage with the sweet potatoes. We loved it! I also cut down on the cayenne pepper and used only 3/4 tsp. and this was enough "kick" for us. The next times I make this dish, I will probably use boneless skinless breasts as picking through the bones seemed to detract from the meal. Just a note, we enjoyed a California chardonnay with this dinner and it was a very nice compliment to the meal.

Rating: 2
Pretty tasty, and very easy to make, although it's not quick. My husband liked it more than I did. Next time I'll remove the chicken's skin -- it got a little soggy sitting in all the sauce. We ate the leftovers for lunch the next day, and it was better. Used fresh peanuts. I halved the amount of chicken for the two of us, but kept the other quantities the same, with no problems.

My husband is from Senegal and this is his favorite dish. He could not tell me how to make it so I have been hunting around for it and finally found it. It is delicious! Instead of using turnips, I cook sweet potatoes, carrots and cabbage, which really compliments the flavor, believe it or not. Would recommend it to anyone who is not dealing with picky eaters. Enjoy!

This was a truly unusual recipe and I try new recipes all the time. We loved it. Turnips took longer than sweet potatoes so start about 5 minutes before. Perfect with those inexpensive leg quarters, fat removed. This is a rich dish so it goes far...leftovers are great! I don't think sauce needs to be reduced. The peanut flavor was nicely modified by chicken and braising and pepper. I cut cayenne to 3/4 teaspoon; next time I will try 1 tsp.

This was fabulous. And extra special because African recipes are a relative rarity. Did do the following: used chicken broth instead of water. Cooked it on stovetop rather than oven (faster). Did find the sweet potatoes cooked faster than the turnips, even though turnip pieces were smaller. Next time I will put in the turnips 7-8 minutes before the potatoes. Oh yes, used peanut butter. Much less work and the results were still delicious. And, of course, the leftovers were even better. Oh, and if you don't like your food too spicy, cut back on the cayenne.

Our family loved this dish. I halved the recipe and it worked out fine. I did find that I needed to add about 3/4 cup of chicken stock to thin the sauce.
