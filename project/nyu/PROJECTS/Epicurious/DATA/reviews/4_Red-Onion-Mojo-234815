Suprising and delicious! I made this as part of a full Carribean themed dinner, including coconut lime halibut and jerk chicken. It got many compliments. Was very simple to make too, best of all worlds!

I served it as a side dish to jerk chicken and mango chutney. It was a huge hit and an easy recipe to prepare after all the work that went into the jerk!

This is the the "condiment" to the Skirt Steak recipe...DO NOT SKIP THIS! It completes the dish. I followed the recipe exactly. I did make it approximately 3 hours before I served it and the flavors were amazing!
