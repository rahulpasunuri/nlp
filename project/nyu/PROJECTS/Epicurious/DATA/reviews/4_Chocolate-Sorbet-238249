The best chocolate sorbet I've ever had! I used Callebaut cocoa and Callebaut bittersweet callets (60.3%) for the chocolate and it was superb! Whatever you use, make sure it's top quality chocolate and a deep, rich cocoa powder; it'll make all the difference.

I had chocolate sorbet at CoCo Sala in DC and had to find a recipe. This was just what I was looking for and it is easy and fabulous. I like to serve in martini glasses with raspberries and a touch of whipped cream. A true treat!

Holy cow. After making this recipe last night, I immediately emailed everyone I knew, told them to buy an ice cream maker, make this, and never look back. I managed to not eat it all when I made it, and all day long today it was all I could think about. It's truly exceptional. Rich and creamy, shockingly like ice cream and not sorbet. I like chocolate but I'm not a chocoholic, but I will make this again and again and again.

User Heads Up: sorta exits the realm of sorbet when a recipe calls for two chocolate bars to be melted into it. Calorie-wise, the chocolate adds an additional 1,000 calories to what is typically a 500 calorie dessert. Lovely but still sorbet???

I am lactose intolerant, so this dessert was a fabulous surprise. I won't miss ice cream a bit.

I like chocolate like the next guy, but this was too over the top cloying...you can only eat a few bites and can't take much more. The only way I can compare it is the difference of what a cup of dark black expresso is to a regular cup of coffee. You need a lot less of it and it is very strong! I wanted something chocolately but refreshing, more like Italian ice. I would eliminate the choc. chips in this recipe altogether and cut back on the cocoa...I won't make this again.

This is SO simple to make and so good. Excellent with a squirt of whipped cream. My BF couldn't believe it was homemade.

WOWZA! This recipe is simple and absolutely delicious! I had to try after reading the rave reviews and it is definitely rich and creamy without the need for cream or eggs. I added crushed pecans which gave it a lovely crunchy texture. Definitely a new staple in my freezer

This is a wonderful recipe--rich, chocolatey, creamy... I do not like too sweet desserts so I increased the cocoa to 1 cup. Also, to deepen the chocolate flavor, I added a teaspoon of instant espresso powder and increased the vanilla to 1 tsp. I intend to make it again tomorrow and stir in some candied pecans.

The best chocolate sorbet recipe ever!! my guests were guessing the amounts of heavy cream and eggs in the dessert since the "mouth feel" was so creamy- there were some shocked foodies when they found out that it was no dairy/eggs at all and that it was so so simple- a new staple at my house!

Not only does this seem too rich to be sorbet, it is one of the richest chocolate dishes I have ever tasted. I used a mixture of 70% chocolates but next time I think I will cut back on the sugar a little bit. I also think it would be good with fresh cherries soaked in port mixed in during the freezing stage.

I never wrote a recipe review before, but had to give this recipe 4 forks. Follow the directions and you will be amazed. It is like a dark rich ice cream. I had a hard time convincing my guests that it was dairy and egg free. It is great by itself but even better combined with cherry (try Jenni's Cherry Lambic Sorbet Recipe) and/or raspberry sorbet.

this is an amazing sorbet and has become the new family favorite (especially for those going dairy- free). it is smooth, rich, amazingly "creamy". the boiling and blending are important so as not to have a powdery flavor. i had hersheys dutch cocoa and some 74% bittersweet chocolate. i'm sure with variety in the cocoa and chocolate it could be perfected further.as it was, a definite four forks! (oh yeah and if it makes it to the next day, the consistancy is even better!)

This sorbet is every chocoholic's dream. I used a large pot to bring the cocoa/water mixture to a boil. You can not use your normal sauce pan--the mixture will boil over. You have to use the blender in order to perfect the consistency. For chocolate I used Godiva's 72% dark and Scharffen Berger's unsweetened cocoa (which I found at Whole Foods). The result was a very lovely, mousse like frozen dessert. Fabulous!

Delicious! I'm amazed at the great consistency I got out of this. So smooth and rich I could tell people it's gelato and they wouldn't question it. I used regular old Baker's Bittersweet chocolate (that's what I had around) and Hershey's "Special Dark" cocoa powder which is a blend of dutch cocoas and significantly cheaper than the imported brands.

I am probably one of the worst chocolate snobs out there - this recipe is really really good - definitely deserves 4 forks! Am gong to serve it with the roasted almond semifreddo as suggested!

my wife has an expensive habit of getting cio bella chocolate sorbet which is $5/pint. she wont eat any other brand - nothing else comes close she says. i an effort to break her of this habit and save us some money i made a batch of this sorbet. suffice to say we havent had to buy cio bella again. i enjoy it too and i ususally am not interested in sorbets which ive never found to be as rich as ice cream.

I thought the flavor of this sorbet was unbelievable, so i gave it the 4 forks. But I had the same grittiness problem as a previous reviewer. I think it's because I didn't let it boil for 45 seconds. I thought it was going to boil over (didn't use a big enough pot) so I took it off the heat. I also didn't use the blender, so that may have been it as well. Just a heads up for those who want to make it, as good chocolate isn't cheap! Enjoy.

my husband and i LOVED this sorbet!! so smooth and rich. it hits the chocolate spot. decadent!! you wouldn't know it wasn't ice cream. saving all those calories is AWESOME! (speaking of which, does anyone have the nutritional analysis for this recipe?) so simple to make too. i plan to keep this in my freezer 24/7 and use it for an elegant dessert when entertaining, especially when i am short on time.

This stuff is dangerous. I made it with Droste dutch-process cocoa, and the chocolate I could scrounge up in my freezer: some ghiradelli 60% chips, some 70% that my mom brought back from France. I did make one addition: about a tablespoon of minced roasted Hatch Chile peppers (I won a recipe contest with them recently and won 75 pounds of roasted peppers so Im using them everywhere I can! The peppers give it a fabulous kick, but this is a recipe that doesn't need any adjustments, and yes, I did use my immersion blender to puree it while it was still in the saucepan. I especially needed that step because of the bits of pepper.

Oh my my my. This is like the frozen version of your favorite dark chocolate bar. Intense and wonderfully dark, this is a treat to savor slowly. It's very hard to have to share it.

Fabulous. I made this for a dinner party to rave reviews. It tasted more like a mousse than a sorbet. The next time I may add some frozen OJ and orange rind. I used 72% bittersweet chocolate.

very good. used valhrona 71% chocolate and a mixture of scharffen berger and ghiradelli cocoa powder. excuse the spelling...anyway totally delicious and almost better than ice cream because the chocolate flavor isn't muted at all by milk or cream. oh my delicious!

This is the most delicious chocolatey treat ever. It's so intesnsley chocolate and smooth and wonderful - it's practically gelato. I only had fructose so I made it with 3/4 cup fructose (fructose is sweeter than sugar) and I don't have an ice cream maker so I made the mixture, stuck it in the freezer over night, put it in the Quisinart, froze for a few more hours and voila! A desssert I could live on. And I thought going dairy-free would be painful...

I made this recipe using Vahlrona cocoa and Scharffenberger chocolate, both excellent products. My finished product however, was gritty and not smooth. The taste was very dense chocolate but I had a hard time getting around the consistency. My mistake was probably that I skipped the blender step, so if you make this, be sure to do that part of the recipe. No other recipe that I read needed that step, so I thought that I could get away with not doing it. Wrong!

This is some good stuff. It's almost like gelato -- from the texture, you'd have a hard time telling there's no extra dairy in it. It's very smooth and mousse-like. I used Callebaut cocoa powder and Guittard bittersweet chocolate, and a standard Cuisinart ice cream maker. Definitely recommend using the good stuff for this recipe. I bet this would be amazing with a little mint extract in it too...
