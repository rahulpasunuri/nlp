Ordinarily I hate the reviews that change everything about the original recipe, however, having said that...although this is outstanding on its own terms - my boyfriend said they were the best he's ever had - I made one minor adjustment: I added two sliced bananas to the pastry cream, after cooking it (I really like fruit with my crepes). The cream and passion fruit sauce were both extremely easy to make, and so delicious. I did have sauce left over, which I used in a tres leches cake (reduced the amount of milk liquid called for, and substituted about 3/4 cup of the passion fruit sauce, it was amazing!) Also, although I'm definitely planning on making the sauce and filling again, I'll probably stick with my plain crepe recipe - these were very light and fluffy, but they didn't get the crisp exterior that I love in the thin, traditional crepe.

This is an incredible recipe!! The texture of the puffy crepe was so delicate and light that it almost became one with the filling, except for the delightful crunch around the edges. I couldn't find passion fruit anywhere, so I resorted to mixed berries as well. The strawberries and blackberries held up fine, but the raspberries completely dissolved in the heat of the sauce. I can't wait to try this again, hopefully with passionfruit next time.

Amazing! Unbelievably rich. We halved the passion fruit sauce and it was the perfect amount for four crepes. I would also halve the crepe mixture for four people because the servings were large and no one could finish the whole thing. Perfect for brunch or tea but too rich for dessert.

This dish is easy and very tasty. I was not able to get any passion fruit so I used mixed berries and the fruit sauce turned out wonderfully. My husband was licking the pan. The crepe recipe is very good; I added vanilla for a little bit of flair to the crepes and they turned out perfect!

This dish is AMAZING! The passionfruit seed and the folded crepe plate wondefully, and the sauce is absolutely delicious. It is very haute, tasty and a great, light end to a meal. I would highly recommend this dish, and it's not that difficult.

This is an excellent recipe. Very tasty and chic. The passion fruit sauce, with the seeds included, gives the dessert a very interesting and unique flavor and texture. I will definitely make this again.
