Good, basic and easy, but nothing special. Could imagine serving it to kids because it's rather bland. To be fair though, I used boneless chicken thighs, so maybe that was the problem, less rich or something. It was lovely and moist though.

Quick and delicious week night meal.

Okay - put the name aside, it's not grilled, but that makes it easier to make year-round. I've made this chicken several times & consider it a delicious dish to rely on. Our family loves it. It uses ingredients I always have on hand & is simple to make. I have taken to making it with chicken thighs with the skin removed. I generally double the red pepper for more kick or use 1/2 dijon and 1/2 horseradish mustard (depending on what I have on hand). It's a great dish to experiment with. I like to add seasoning to the bread crumbs too. After reading the other reviews, I may try it with boneless chicken breasts next time.

Uugh??? Where's the grilled part of this dish?

Zest it up with a tablespoon or 2 of fresh thyme in the mustard mixture. Truly makes this recipe an absolute winner!

Sorry - thought the flavor was too bland. I suggest trying the Mustard chicken recipe on this site...much more flavorful http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=1862

This was ok, but nothing special. The mustard is VERY subtle. Too subtle for my tastes. I used Dijon and grainy hot mustard. It really just tastes like chicken baked with breadcrumbs. I may try some version of this again, since so there are so many raves.

These chicken legs were very tasty, however, if you are really a dijon lover, you will find the flavor very subtle. I agree that this recipe would also be excellent in the summer with salads. This dish is a keeper!

Wonderful! My husband, teenager & I loved it. I used boneless breasts, and substituted Maille's Provencal mustard for the Dijon, and 1/2 tsp chili paste for the red pepper. Followed the recipe otherwise, incl. cooling for 5 minutes on a rack. True, it wasn't crispy like fried chicken, or really spicy, but it was crispy enough & full of flavour. Served it with Rosemary Orzo & baby bok choy, both from this site. I will serve this again!

I'm looking for a grilled poultry recipe for our Bastille Day BBQ. Just wondering why this is called "Grilled Chicken" when it is baked in the oven. I'm disappointed.

I love this cookbook,any of her cookbooks are superb. Made this dish, it was alright. Not as crispy as hoped. Made the chix fricasse with two vinegars from this book, WONDERFUL. Even picky kids liked it. Please give any of her books a try - you will not be disappointed.

I followed the recipe exactly, plus read the tester's tips and found the chicken was not really crispy. I will try it again, but with boneless chicken breasts, as another reviewer recommends. Also, I think this is not a dish for fall, but better for summer, with potato salad and ripe tomatoes, e.g. I cannot imagine eating this with my fingers - too messy.

I made this dish with a few slight alterations, and it was delish! I used four boneless, skinless breasts. I rubbed them with my favorite speciality mustard, Nunda cracked peppercorn, with a little less red pepper. I really coated the breasts, then dipped in egg quickly, then dredged in fresh breadcrumbs. I baked about the same time, maybe a little less, with a bit more butter. I served it with rosemary roasted potatoes, and asparagus. We enjoyed this very much!
