I tried this recipe out of pure curiousity, because I love crab, I love blueberries and I love popcorn, and I wondered how it would all come together, given the description of how incredible it was despite how odd it sounded... My curiousity was satisfied, but not in a good way... We tasted it just before the meal, and then dumped it out. NYE dinner was short one dish. Sorry...
