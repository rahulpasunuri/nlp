I made the recipe exactly as is... with my fresh garden tomatoes and basil. It turned out unbelievably delicious -- too much for just my husband and I.

I used this recipe as a base and personalized it as follows - Since my bread was "grocery store" Italian (not very hearty) and only a day old, I did not soak the bread at all. The only water added was what had clung to the washed veges and herbs. I used grape tomatoes instead of Roma. I also added chopped seedless cukes, chopped fresh flat leaf parsley and about a 1/4 c shredded parmesan cheese. This is a nice alternative to a traditional tossed salad - be sure to use plenty of salt and pepper.

I also add cucumber to this recipe. It gives it a nice summer flavor. I only soak the bread if it's really stale--and even then, I just add a little bit of water (less than a cup) for a short time (about a minute).

This dish is perfect for the fresh summer tomatoes from the garden. I added chopped cucumber, didn't soak the bread in water and used part balsamic vinegar. I mixed up the salad and dressing and let it sit in the fridge for 4 hours--the liquids from the dressing and tomatoes soaked into the bread without making it too soggy.

Made this for a cookout-not much got eaten by a group of folks who are hearty eaters. I mean, soggy bread and tomatoes???? A better salad is using cukes instead of bread with this recipe.

I have made this several times with overripe tomatotes - it is a perfect simple summer supper main course. I do soak the bread, and it works just fine. I also use a LOT of coarse grind black pepper which gives it a nice zip!

I also only used a little water with the bread and only let it soak about 20 seconds. It wasn't too soggy and still soaked up the flavor of the vinegrette. I also added extra basil for more taste. I will definitely make this again - a nice alternative to the typical salad.

Delicious and easy! Skipped soaking and used only a cup of water to soften the 6 cups of bread. Used part balsamic and part red wine vinegar for the dressing. Added cucumbers and shredded romano cheese for an even better taste. Let sit in refrigerator for an hour or so before serving over a bed of mixed greens. YUM!

I just tear the bread into smallish chunks. Also skipped the wetting down of the bread. Wonderful!

This dish is soooo good primarily because of it's simplicity. You must use good tomatoes. I marinated the onions in the oil and vinegar for a few hours before it was served to mellow the taste. Also, toasted the bread so they were big croutons (don't like mushy bread) and it was fabulous!!!

Easy and with taste. What a wonderful way to use stale bread, in a world where store bread never stales. My wife loved it. I served it with Moroccan style Cornish Hens, and vegetable fried rice. Yes it was good!

Skip the soaking--use day-old bread and cut it bitesize, then toss it with the rest of ingredients 20 minutes before serving. I use nice kosher salt, part balsamic/part red wine vinegars, plus heirloom cherry tomatoes when I can get them. Great flavor--a handful of freshly chopped parsley at the end doesn't hurt. Tasty and different as a side with grilled steaks.

I agree with the reader who said it was not good leftover. I tasted it right after I made it and loved it but by the next day it had really lost something. If served fresh, however I think its great! By the way I used basalmic vinegar.

This was a great salad recipe for the summer, especially when entertaining. Everyone loved it and you can prepare it ahead of time.

For a similar but BETTER recipe, make the "Tomato Bread Salad with Herbs" on this site from August 1996 Gourmet. It's GREAT!

If you have leftovers you make italian bread soup.

this is always a great salad for a summer party, but the only bad thing is that it is gross by the next day. The bread gets all soggy and the tomatoes get acidic. Make only enough that you'll use--I wound up throwing out about 4 lbs. of it last night! Good taste, though. Goes great at a cookout!

I made this dish yesterday and really liked it. What a great way to use up stale bread or crusts of bread. Next time I might try cutting the bread into smaller pieces and adding it without soaking first.

I have made variations on this salad before, but never "soaked" the bread before hand. I tried it this way and the bread turned into a mushy mess. I would absolutely make this again but skip the soaking and put the bread right into the salad and let it stand for 30 min or so before serving.

I guess this is something you had to grow up on to like. I'm thinking of rinsing the bread off the tomatoes and onions and making more vinaigrette in order to salvage something for dinner. Not a keeper for me.

This brought me back to my childhood! We would make this salad and after we were done we would take crusty bread and dip it into the dressing that was left over. It is definately better with white bread - and it really must sit for several hours to let the flavors meld. Try adding chopped cucumbers to this - wonderful!!

This dish is so simple yet so delicious. I've already made it at least four times. Great olive oil is the key.
