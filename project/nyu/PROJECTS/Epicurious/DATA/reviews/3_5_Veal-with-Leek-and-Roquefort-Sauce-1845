This sauce is amazing. I will be making it again and again.

I halved the recipe as I was only cooking for two. There were no leftovers; need I say more!? The only change I made was to add a little white wine to the leeks and stock when I pureed them together as the mixture seemed a bit too thick. Yes, it's rich, but paired with a walnut risotto and roasted asparagus it was to die for.

This dish missed for me. I love veal, leaks and roquefort, but somewhere the combo didn't gel as I'd expected.

This was very good but rich and I didn't even use the butter at the end! The leeks are wonderful.

I have 2 Veal Chop recipies and this is my 2nd favorite (the first uses fresh morrel mushrooms which are more expensive than the chops). I follow this to the letter, the cheese is the defining element. If you love Roquefort you'll love this. Not a subtle taste - but very tasty.

Will make this again. I agree with Toronto, it's a shame not to have enough of the leek sauce per chop,espciallly for very thick cuts. But really...all this butter! We could easily halve it.

I made this receipe last night. The flavours were very nice together however, I did find it a tad too rich. To make a fraction lighter I would de-glaze the pan from which the veal was cooked with the brandy and then add cream followed by a little of the cheese and then whisk in a little cubed butter to gloss the sauce.

I took the word of the cook from Toronto and made all the sauce for half the veal. It was way TOO rich, if I make this again, I'll follow the recipe as written.

One of the outstanding ways of serving veal chops. I would use the sauce quantities for just 4 chops, 1 1/2" chops. I cannot imagine this volume being sufficient for 8. Must be VERY careful not to brown the leeks. I prefer using a cover for part of the meltdown process on the leeks. I agree that the butter is a bit excessive. Even if you decide to monter the sauce at the end, 3 T. is adequate.

It never occured to me to actually add all the butter this recipe called for--it's quite obscene and unnecessary; however, made with a minimum of butter (just for caramelizing the leeks) it's one of the most delicious dinners I have ever eaten and my husband would agree 400%!!!! The first time I made it, we loved the sauce so much we made it with egg noodles the next time--the combination of leek, roquefort, and broth flavored with the pan juices is so exquisite (yes, I did add the 1/4 cup cream) that it defies description. The leeks are so smooth and satiny that all that butter would be totally redundant anyway. This is one of the most subtle, yet flavorful recipes I've ever tasted from epicurious.com and I can't imagine how many times I will make it--worth every minute and every pot!!

I guess I am going against all the other reviewers and maybe it was just me tonight. I thought the sauce was way too rich and overpowered the taste of good veal chops. Also, it was too many pots and pans! The sauce was delicious though but RICH!!!!!

Excellent flavors! Easy prep! This is a definite keeper either for quick weekday, or more elegant company dinner. What more can you ask?

Awesome. We are big sauce people. So, when I prepare it again, I'll carmelize two cups of the leeks and double the other liquids. There will still be "more" than enough of the leeks left for garnishing.

I would give this one 5 forks. the flavors just explode in your mouth. I am a recipe changer but not here, it was perfect. I teamed it up with Emeril's truffle risotto. Very rich.

I made this for an 80th birthday celebration for a real lover of veal and he practically licked the Plate! A very well balanced sauce that although I was not real pleased with before it met up with the veal, once you had a bite of both - WOW!

I would make it again and again. However I changed it quite a bit. I used blu cheese in place of the roquefort. and baked it in the oven sealed in aluminiam foil for 1 1/2 hrs at a 325 oven
