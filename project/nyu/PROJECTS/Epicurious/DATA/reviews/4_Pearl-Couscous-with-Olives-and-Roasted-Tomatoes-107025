Excellent results. I used homemade chicken stock. I served it with Roast Chicken with Mustard Vinaigrette and roasted root vegetables.

Wow. Made this 2 weeks ago with mint, and loved it. Tonight, made it with basil. Double wow. The roasted tomatoes (and dressing) make this dish; the combo of olives, tomatoes add such a zip. The basil tops it off. Define keeper. I'm trying to figure out how to turn this into an appetizer for a boating trip saturday, as it's such a star dish, and I need to bring an appetizer! Shooters!

This dish is so tasty! And it always turns out well. One of my favorite ways to prepare pearl couscous.

This recipe was fantastic! My guests each took some home to savor. I loved the fact that I could make it ahead of time. I did revive the couscous by pouring hot water over it, through a strainer. Worked just fine. I definitely will use the recipe again.

This was excellent. It takes a little time but well worth the effort. I didn't use the whole amount of the dressing on this and next time would reduce the amount of water in the dressing.

I made this last night for the first time and loved it! To streamline the dish for a weeknight dinner I subbed canned roasted tomatoes, drained them, and put them in a 400 degree oven with the garlic cloves for about a half hour, while I chopped the herbs and olives. I used extra garlic because we both love it, and I didn't cool the couscous or tomatoes before continuing with the dish. I served it with the Yogurt-Marinated Chicken Kebabs with Aleppo Pepper from this site (which was awesome!), and I put this dish together and let it sit at room temperature while I grilled the chicken. I cut the recipe in half, which made two generous sides, and I have leftovers for lunch today. Other than the extra garlic I kept all the other ingredients and amounts just as the recipe calls for.

Made this for a dinner party for 8, and while it was time-consuming, it was also very well consumed by all my guests! They also took home plenty of it (since I had doubled the recipe). Nice, subtle flavors, and would likely make again.

Finally made this last night. Very very good, I will make this again. Takes awhile, so try to start it mid-afternoon or you'll be eating at 9:30 pm like we did. I only made a half recipe as a test. Used an immersion blender to make the dressing, worked great. The mint was a very interesting flavor, highly recommended you avoid the thought of substituting something else instead.

This was really good. I made it with Lebanese couscous instead of Israeli(slightly bigger pearls than Israeli), which meant that the whole thing took a bit longer and required more broth, but it was worth it. I used more lemon juice than the recipe called for, which gave it some much-needed zing, and I also threw in a bit of crumbled goat cheese and minced rind from half of a preserved meyer lemon (preserved lemons are SO easy to make, and they add a great depth of flavor to all kinds of things). I am planning to serve the leftovers with grilled salmon tomorrow.

Perfect dish for a August summer night! This would make a perfect vegetarian main dish or a great accompaniment to grilled fish or chicken. The only changes I made was to use vegetable instead of chicken broth and used plain couscous. I also think the mint

A great recipe!!!! My tomatoes cook in much less time than stated here. I usually take the warm couscous and mix immediately with remaining ingredients. Works great.

I made a large batch of this to go with chicken tagine, and it made a great combination. Nice combination of flavors.

Fantastic is the only word for this recipe--I've served it four times, to over 50 different people--and consistently pulled raves from all who tried it. One substitution--for vegetarian gatherings--in lieu of chicken broth--I've found Better Than Broth's vegetable base makes it vegan-friendly and actually adds a nice depth to the dish.

Even better the next day.

I made this dish for a dinner party and the guests loved it. The only tedious part was cutting each cherry tomato in half and lining a baking dish with a single layer of it. I roasted 4 cloves of garlic with the tomatoes in a 350 degree oven. I used regular couscous instead and skipped the cooling part of the recipe which requires you to pour it on a flat baking pan. I didn't bother cooling the tomatoes after taking it out of the oven and still everything turned out perfect. The dressing is tasty and mild enough to taste all the other ingredients in the dish. I've made it twice in one weekend already and will keep it in my cook book for future reference indeed!

I love the flavors in this recipe but I think that it takes too long to make. I cut down the preparation time by more than half the time in its original recipe by roasting the tomatoes with 3-4 cloves of minced garlic, olive oil, the thyme or oregano and salt and pepper. I put them in the oven for 30 minutes at 400 deg. F on a cookie sheet covered with parchment or aluminum foil paper. While that's roasting, I make the couscous and let it cool a bit. I really don't wait much for the tomatoes to cool down and just pureed them warm. The rest of the recipe I follow as is...

Loved this recipe. Didn't have parsley, thyme or mint, so used chopped arulgula instead. Served with butterflied leg of lamb.

I made this twice: once with regular couscous, once with Israeli couscous. The regular couscous was pretty flavorless, since it absorbed most of the dressing. I loved the Israeli couscous, though. This takes kind of a long time, and messes up a lot of kitchen equipment. But it is tasty!

I've made this with pearl couscous and regular couscous and each time it's turned out fantastic. The dressing mixture is the perfect consistancy and turns the couscous a nice light red color. Would definitely recommend this for a dinner party.

This is a great simple meal. I left out the mint and do not think it lacked. I love the creaminess of the Isreli couscous.

yum. halved the recipe, because we were serving it as a side for 2. worried that it looked like a lot of effort for something that could go either way -- so wrong. it wasn't much effort at all -- really 30 minutes of total work; and the results got rave reviews. a dinner party dish (esp. with any kind of fish), but easy enough for a weeknight.

This is a family favourite anytime of year. Very versatile, and the roasted tomatoes delight everytime (whether they are large or cherry). We love the pearl couscous!!! when we can find it.

This recipe is a bit labor intensive, but worth every minute of toil. The flavors blend beautifully and every forkful is delicious! If you are thinking of serving this for a party/picnic, allow it to stand at room temperature, as refrigerating it dulls the flavor quite a bit. A real hit...

Per other reviewers, I used regular couscous (whole wheat) one box per 3 cups of stock. Followed the rest of the recipe exactly and loved it! Made enough for 12 side servings.

I made this for a work holiday party and it was the first dish gone. I couldn't find pearl couscous but the regular was great. Loved the roasted tomatoes and garlic. Next time I might add more mint. Loved it overall.

Delicious and flavorful, it's really tomato and garlic flavored. I made a third and served grilled tuna with it. A definite repeat. I also used cilantro instead of parsley and put equal amounts of mint and cilantro in it. I omitted the thyme since I was out of it. A great side dish with little fat.

This recipe was simply delicious. I substituted whole wheat regular couscous for the Israeli to cut down on the carbs. Everyone (except my husband who really doesn't like mint) loved it - we all loved the freshness that the mint brought to the salad. Will make again, but next time will substitute basil for the mint - it will be delicious either way.

I've made this many times with rave reviews. I roast whole small tomatoes (grape or cherry) for a 1/2 hour on 400 degrees, then follow the recipe. I've also added feta cheese when I have some. Very good.

The ingredients, excepting the pearl couscous, are basic but perfectly suited for regular couscous or any pasta salad. Of six of us only one liked the pearl couscous (so very starchy) and I found for the expense and effort this is a recipe not worth repeating. Oven roasted cherry tomatoes can be used much more effectively than to puree them into a dressing. I would suggest making reg. couscous with chicken broth and just add chopped roasted (or sun-dried) tomatoes, any combo of basil, thyme or mint, olives, olive oil, lemon juice and some chopped green onion! takes only ten minutes and the flavour compares well to this recipe.

Is any dish 'beyond compare'? However this is mighty delicious and was devoured by my family.It went really well with salmon. Any small pasta or couscous would work, but the texture of the dish with the pearl(Israeli) couscous was wonderful and worth seeking out. My second choice would be orzo.Made the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing.

Fantastic recipe! Made this weekend for group of 10 (1 1/2x the recipe) and received rave results. Made everything ahead and combined at the end as directed. A little time consuming, but definitely worth it when you're looking for a dish with impact.

This is really good. I was not sure what to expect but it was really good. My husband loved it. I served it with salmon. Yummmy!! I used regular vine tomatoes and roasted for 40 minutes in 350 F., I added some roasted mushrooms too. Even without the "dressing" this is good.

Well! Based on the stellar reviews, I had to try this, although my husband hates couscous and has asked me to avoid it like the plague. HE LOVED IT! Where the recipe says to spread the cooked couscous on a sheet to cool, I didn't want to create another item to wash, so I just tossed the warm couscous with 2 TBS extra virgin and let it cool in the saucepan. No sticking when I added the rest of the ingredients a good while later.

I served this at a dinner with roast beef and mixed greens as suggested, and it was delicious. I had to use a mixture of pearl and regular couscous, and it worked fine. The leftovers were also excellent the following day.

This was delicious, but it really makes a ton. Israeli couscous is extremely filling. The cooking times provided were perfect...we wound up with fantastic al dente pasta. However, in the future, I might cook my tomatoes longer, or just at a slightly higher heat, to blacken them. This was a great accompaniment to any simple meat dish.

A bit labor-intensive (roasting the tomatoes for the dressing takes a while but it's worth it), this dish is probably best prepped the day before and then assembled at room temp as a quick side dish or picnic salad. I loved it and will definitely make again.

I found "toasted" pearl (Israeli) couscous at my local Safeway in the Kosher food section, among the matzo ball soup mix and the bottled gefilte fish. I made this a few days ago for a dinner and got NO response. Eveyone loved the soup I served and the dessert, but not this and there was a lot left over. I found the roasted tomatoes and the dressing interesting (I doubled the garlic) and might do something with that, but it got lost in all the pasta. Also, I think the olives detracted from this. There are many other recipes that are less labor-intensive and more reliably delicious.

Great with the Lemon-Oregano chicken. Even my husband ate this. More work than I anticipated but we have leftovers for tonight, so it's worth it. Will make for our supper clubs since it can be prepared a day ahead.

I thought this was a great side for my chilean seabass. A few things I did differently; first, instead of olives I added capers, I also added extra roasted garlic, as well as toasted pine nuts. The pine nuts were great for texture. Delicious even at room temperature.

An excellent recipe! For our holiday party, I made this as the accompaniment to the "fillet of beef with cornichon/tarragon sauce" to great acclaim. Better still, this dish does well served at room temperature, so it's a great make-ahead piece of a larger meal.

This was delicious and perfect for our bbq. I used orzo (an Italian pasta shaped like rice grains) as I couldn't find Israeli couscous and it was a good substitute (very similar to Israeli couscous). I substituted homemade vege stock instead of chicken, used a few more roasted tomatoes and added a drop of balsamic vinegar (about 2 tsp) instead of lemon as it perfectly compliments the sweet flavour of the tomatoes without being overwhelming.

This recipe is delicious. I served it with the spiced tenderloin and mezula salad for a 10 person dinner party. It was loved by all and allowed me time to be a guest at my own dinner.

I am the laziest cook you can imagine and had read complaints about how complicated it was: so I took a short-cut and sauteed the tomatoes with the garlic, and instead of putting some in the blender (I also hate dish-washing) I added some finely diced romas. It came out nicely.

I thought this was absolutely delicious. I wasn't able to find pearl couscous so I used regular, and it was still fabulous. A little time-consuming to prepare (perfect if you roast the tomatoes and make the dressing a day ahead) but worth it. And I found it to be good served warm the night I fixed it and straight from the fridge the next day.

I made this recipe, I thought it was not worth the effort, the directions were very confusing and time consuming. I used grape tomatoes and other than the pearl couscous I had all the other ingredients on hand. I thought it needed more garlic than the recipe called for.

Other than the time needed to slice and place cut side up all those little grape tomatoes (which ended up being a great way to include the kids in helping to cook dinner), this is a breeze and delicious. I couldn't find the pearl couscous and used regular, so I didn't need to boil and let it sit as long as stated in the recipe. I used vegetable broth to accommodate my vegeterian daughter. Everyone loved it and it will be a regular in our household.

Wow! Took this to a backyard barbeque with two caterers in attendance and had both raving about the taste. I used up some assorted olives in addition to the Kalamatas and used the juice of 1/2 lemon. This was a last-minute, rush deal, so with everything else I didn't have time to get all fresh herbs, so I (purists hate me all you will) used dried thyme - just cut down the amount to 1/4 tsp.

This is wonderful even with regular (little) couscous.(I can't find the larger "pearl"). I've also made it with Bulgur Wheat; equally successful. For me, roasted cherry tomatoes are a delightful surprise; I will use that sweet/acid flavor in lots of other ways as well.

Killer reciope! I used quinoa instead of couscous and added crumbled feta.

This was very good and I will certainly make it again. According to what I serve it with, I would think about spicing it up a bit. While I've used Israeli couscous before in a sort of "primavera" dish, and know that it is really a pasta, making this opened my eyes to its endless variety. As directed making it a day ahead, I kept the ingredients seperate - voila - a great, tasty, fast side dish. The next day at a left-over meal, it was just as good.

yummm!!! subbed vegie broth for the chicken. vegetarians should give it a go. i'm one and always wonder why the first option on a "vegetarian sounding" dish is always chicken broth. apart from that, i wouldn't change a thing.
