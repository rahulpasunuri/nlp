I really liked this recipe. I added a layer of potatoes on the bottom, and doubled the sauce. I made savory cupcakes out of them. The bechamel sauce looked like icing. It was fun to eat at my party!

It was good, but I've had better. My bf liked the dish a lot more than I did--maybe it will taste better after a day or so? I thought the cheese sauce tasted extremely flour-y. If I make it again I will definitely use less flour. I used 2 lbs of lamb mince rather than 1 1/4 lb. Each package was 1 lb. and I bought 2. I don't like lamb sitting around, even if it is frozen. Seems a waste to leave 3/4 lb. I used 3 eggplants and should have used 4. Didn't taste the eggplant enough. It's a time-consuming recipe, but most moussakas are. I just thought for the time and effort I put into it, it should have tasted better. The cheese sauce put me off. Everything else was ok, but go easy on the sauce. It's heavy and filling.
