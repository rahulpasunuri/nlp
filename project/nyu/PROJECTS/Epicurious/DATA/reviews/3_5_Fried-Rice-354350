Used coconut oil, opted for chopped red onion over scallions, doubled the eggs, replaced the soy sauce with Bragg's All Purpose. Oh, and about a teaspoon of pure maple syrup along with the water mix at the end. The bosses (children) were pleased. Great high protein, FAST meal.

Why the frozen vegetables? There's no real need to imitate your local Chinese restaurant at home, and I would think the moisture in the frozen veggies would make it hard to get a good sear on the rice. I like the recipe found here: http://www.nyfoodjournal.blogspot.com/2012/03/fried-rice.html

Very easy and really good. I appreciate the reviewer who said to use the Ready Rice...awesome idea! Just stuck it in the fridge for a while, and voila! I used peanut oil and 1 T. hot sesame oil, because I love spicy. I also let mine cook more than 5 minutes so the rice would get more crispy and I didn't thaw the veggies. Very good for a weeknight. Made with some ginger garlic marinated pork chops. Great side!

Excellent from beginning to the end... everyone cleaned their plates and asked for more. I didn't add any meat this time around but I plan on adding shrimp and chicken for the next batch. We don't have to order Chinese anymore - We can make our own!! ;0) Delicious

Not as good as at a Hibachi Grill, but it will do when you have a craving at home.

Great. Made without any meat and it was the best fried rice I've ever made.

Great use of leftovers. I halved the recipe for 2 adults and it was a nice amount of food. I cut up one boneless, skinless chicken breast and sauteed it in 2 T sesame (not canola) oil first. Removed the chicken and added fresh mushrooms, ginger, and a shallot. When those were soft, I added the egg, then frozen corn, frozen peas, and leftover white rice. Finished up with the soy/water mixture with a dash of fish sauce.

Quick, easy, and versatile. I used rice aged 2-3 days in the cooler, and it came out perfectly. The sesame oil gave it some added zest, so I recommend it over canola oil. Diced ham for the meat was a winner. I also added some fresh ginger to my wok prior to adding any other ingredients, and it gave the dish a little zest and zing without overwhelming the other flavors. I'll do this one again, but will continue to experiment with various meats, vegetables, and spices. A good, healthy meal that was more than worth the reasonable time I spent preparing it.

This was great. Used 1/2 the amount of long grain brown rice cooked in low sodium chicken broth. Used smoked Whole Foods turkey for the meat. Used frozen peas and raw chopped carrots. Used about 50% more vegies.

Great recipe, esp for any odds and ends you have in your fridge. I've made it a couple of times. I didn't have green onions the second time so I used shallots instead. I saute any raw veggies I have first instead of throwing them in later in the process (where it calls for the frozen veggies). Have used leftover white rice but have also used Uncle Ben's brown rice semi-cooked packets for this, and I think the texture is just as good. Added garlic and a bit of sesame oil, and used peanut oil as my base oil.

Easy and delicious. Perfect recipe for left over rice from take out. I followed the recipe almost exactly, no scallions laying around, and thought it was great! My 14 month old loves this meal too.

For how quick and easy, this is really good. Definitely a keeper for whenever I"m in a hurry. Highly recommend.

I use this recipe often adding different things. Lately, I have been adding the asian 5 spice powder when I add the soy sauce. The last time I made it, I used pork tenderloin from a grilled chipotle stuffed pork tenderloin -- so it was spicy -- together with the 5 spice powder. Really turned out well -- spicy with an ever so slight sweetness. Unusual and smells exotic.

This is my tried and true method of using up leftovers. I experimented with leftover edamame, and it was 10 times better than the peas and carrots.

This was excellent and so quick. I used a left over pork chop as the meat. I added garlic and ginger to the green onions at the beginning then I added corn and shredded cabbage to the veggies later. To finish it, I added a bit of sesame oil. It was great! My 4 and 6 year olds ate seconds and everything was gone from their plates. this is a winner for using up leftovers. Will make regularly.

I made this for the first time in my "kid's cooking" class at our school. While we didn't really wait for all the rice to get brown, the kids loved it. I thought it was quite tasty too, for a kid-friendly recipe!

Would strongly suggest using Sesame Oil instead of Canola for an added -amazingly delicious- flavor. Also, I used three eggs instead of two. I love this recipe, it's easy and turns out great each time!

I have never made fried rice and this turned out great. However, I did make some changes. I used 50% peanut oil, added 2 Tbsp. ginger to the scallions after a few minutes and added the garlic about one minute before the eggs. These items still got a touch charred for me. I will remove them next time and add them a couple of minutes before the soy sauce/H2O. I also added frozen, chopped broccoli with the rice. The cold Jasmine rice was the ticket; rest. quality tecture.

My son and husband loved this. Will become a staple at our house.

I didn't make this exactly - to add extra taste I first made brown rice with 2 TB of soy in the water while it cooked - that way it absorbed the flavor of the soy. I loved the crispy rice texture. I'll defintely use this with other vegetables. Caution - if you use peas, don't add them in until the end or else the pea taste is WAY too strong.

Really easy to make, but could have been better with a little garlic. I recommend adding more soy than the recipe states, was borderline bland without it.

Our family did not care for this fried rice recipe at all. It just did not have enough flavor for us

Its a miracle! On and off for 30 years I've tried to make fried rice and every effort was an abysmal failure. This one works beautifully! The secret must be using cold rice. I did add minced ginger and garlic at the start and a few mung sprouts at the end but other than that I followed the receipt exactly. I will make again but will try mixing soy with only 2Tbs water because it was a tad wet. I repeat, this recipe is a miracle -- I'm giddy with success!

Best fried rice I've ever made. I bought some BBQ pork from my local chinese restaurant and used that for the meat. Also added bean sprounts near the end so they would be a crisper. This will be my go-to recipe for fried rice. I may try putting a spin on this to make a new version of spanish rice!

Wow!... great Monday night dinner. So quick and easy with lots of taste. I added chicken,shrimp,and stir fry veggies. I also took the advise of one of the other members who said to add garlic and seasame seed oil. Very good. Will definitely keep this one in the recipe box.

This is way better than other fried rice recipes I've used. It helped to undercook the rice just a bit, with 1/4 cup less water than normal. Using cold rice definitely was the ticket! I used fresh basil cut in thin strips to add color and sliced anaheim pepper. Everyone in my family loved it!

Excellent recipe. I could never make good fried rice. Now I can. I added grated fresh ginger, shredded cabbage and used frozen stir fry veggies. I had leftover fried chicken which added a nice flavor also. Can't wait to make this again and again using whatever leftovers I have. Thank you for a wonderful dish.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I only used 3 cups of cooked rice, and also added about 1 cup of shredded cabbage with the other vegetables. I also removed the cooked eggs/scallions, and returned them to the skillet right before adding the soy sauce. I used leftover shredded pork, and thought there was plenty of flavor.

I'll omit the water and use sesame oil at the end next time. I'll use this with left over shrimp and fish too. Glad I tried it, because when I used warm rice in the past it never turned out.

This is a great recipe!!! I cook for two now so that this was a good for dinner and for a couple of lunches. I used frozen stir-fry veggies and cashue nuts (unsalted). I often have leftover pork or chicken so that will go well too, as you recommended! I am not a big fan of Soy Sauce so I used the Chicken Broth. But I do love this recipe very much. I also used Brown Long Grain Rice...very good!! Thanks so very much.

I found the flavor of this recipe to be excellent. I didn't use as much rice as the recipe called for, and I added more vegetables. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I do not have a wok or a large non-stick skillet though, and that is an essential item for the next time I make this.

This seems very close to my fried rice, although I do add chopped fresh gingerand green onion to the egg...whip it up with about a TBS of soy sauce, and then fry it in the wok like a big omelet..rolling it up and then slicing it into thin strips to be returned to the pan with the rice after the veggies are "fried"...I will also add a little heat in the way of red pepper flakes...yum!!!!

You need to add Garlic to increase the taste Diced of Onion At he end cooking just sparkling of Seasame oil and this will increase the taste

Yes, the secret to good fried rice is COLD rice! My father made the most wonderful fried rice while I was growing up, and the first time I went to make it I used fresh, hot rice and wondered why is turned into a sticky, clumpy mess. I've also found that the less you stir the rice, the better. High heat also helps--every grain of rice should sizzle! I also add a drizzle of sesame oil and cashews.

I sauted onions and bell peppers first then added everything as per recipe. I also added a bit of Oyster Sauce and some crushed red chili flakes. Yummmm... Pretty much anything goes with this recipe. You can put in anything you happen to have.

This is a very simple recipe every household should have. You can hide any type of veggie in it, use any type of leftover meat...or just eggs. I hate soy sauce, while my guys love it. We hit middle ground by cooking the rice in chicken soup base. I make a well in a large wok and add at least three eggs. When the whites are almost set I start stirring everything around. It insures there are bits of egg and every thing is going to fry up golden. More green onion at the end for color and a fresh bite...a very easy, tasty and cheap dish.

Not terrible, but the brown rice I used was sort of moist and clumpy, so when I put it into the wok, it WOULD NOT get crispy. Instead, it sort of turned into a rice porridge (a bit like congee). The egg also disappeared; it was in there, but you couldn't really perceive its presence. If I do this recipe again, I think I'll use half the recommended amount of rice, and definitely white rice, not brown. The flavor was also disappointing; it wasn't a strong Asian flavor. However, again, I'm hoping that if I halve the rice, the flavor of the soy sauce will be stronger.

This was fabulous. My kids gave it an A+, which is unheard of. I've also made it with quinoa instead of rice and it was equally delicious with more nutritional value. I have also substituted onion for scallion with great results.

Simple and flavorful as is. From what I have read, you should let the rice cool and dry for at least a day, preferably more. If you don't have the time, you can spread the rice out on a baking sheet and place it in your freezer for 30+ minutes to achieve a similar result.
