This was a muddy mess of slop. Never again.

Wow, this was not my favorite. Granted, I followed one of the alternate techniques (baking the fish, in my case tilapia, together with the sauce), and I did not include peas or saffron. I used wine rather than fish stock. I found the result to be uninteresting. I'm freezing most of it for some future emergency meal.

Amazing and refreshingly different recipe! Wish I'd had saffron and nice fresh peas, but even without those it was outstanding. Only change was that the sauce needed an extra few Tbl. of water to even out, and used fresh cherry tomatoes with skins and seeds still in--no problems. Made it with halibut. Yummy.

I baked this in the oven with a salmon and it was delicious!

This was strange. My boyfriend agreed. Maybe I should have tried it with the wine instead of stock...

This recipe was easy to make and delicious. I would definitely make it again.I recommend using a chardonnay instead of fish stock. Beautiful presentation as well.

Uggh. This was awful.

Very delicious. I made it with a small pinch of smoked paprika as well as the sweet paprika. Chopped the pine nuts with a chef's knife instead of grinding. Served it with saffron basmati rice.

The sauce had nice flavor... but IMHO there was too much sauce and it was too thick. Next time I'll reduce the breadcrumbs in half... and maybe reduce the entire sauce recipe in half. Otherwise, a good (and quick) mid-week dinner recipe.

I made this with cod, and for some reason the sauce came out bland and we could mostly taste the fish. My husband added had to add hot sauce, and then he liked it.

Made with tilapia - great! Don't over chop the pine nuts! Very tasty and I will be making this again.

Loved this dish. I warmed the saffron in warm water and then ground with mortar and pestle...in retrospect should have reversed that. Just a nice deviation. Thoroughly enjoyed.

I used slivered almonds instead of pine nuts. My family liked this very much served with Jasmine rice. The tomato sauce had great flavor. Soooooo easy.

We made this dish exact to the recipe and enjoyed it with a Rousanne/Marsanne blend that complimented it well. The taste of the pine nuts really makes the sauce (I would say it overpowers the saffron - my wife says to keep to saffron). The peas and parley add for texture and presentation. The taste will appeal to a wide range of guests. Also - easy with the grinding of pine nuts - too much pulsing and you have pine nut butter.

Loved it! Made with orange roughy and baked in the oven. Added peas directly to the sauce as I was using frozen. Didn't have saffron so I used corrainder, which turned out great. Served with green beans sauteed with chorizo. Wonderful meal!

Prepared as suggested, with sea bass. Excellent!
