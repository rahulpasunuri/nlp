I didn't bother timing, just watched the beans closely to make sure nothing burned, I'm guessing about 10 minutes at 450. Squeezed some fresh lemon juice on them out of the oven, which really brightened things up.

These beans are fantastic! I roasted them on the middle rack in the same oven with Paprika Roast Chicken with Sweet Onion (which was on that top rack) at 475 for about 40-45 minutes and stirred frequently. No charring! Just great tastiness!

I love this recipe. I took some hints from the other people that made it and turned my oven down. I did it at 400 for around 40 minutes and stirred it every 10 minutes. This worked well with no burning. I also added 3 cloves of chopped garlic. This was really yummy in there. I also added the blue cheese that someone else mentioned. YUM! I will be adding this to my recipe book!

I read the reviews and set my oven at 450 ddegrees instead of 500. I roasted everything but the cashews for 15 minutes (stirring often) and added the cashews for another 5 minutes (for a total of 20). It was good when hot but even better the next day cold with some blue cheese tossed in. Easy and worth making just for the leftovers.

After reading all the other reviews, I made this recipe using whole cashews, roasting at 450 degrees, and stirring frequently. Despite this, it burned badly and tasted pretty bad. I probably won't attempt this one again.

I made this recipe with raw cashews and organic green beans. No shallots, so used sweet onion, finely chopped. Tossed all in a bowl to coat with oil. Because of the burning concerns, I dropped temperature to 450 F, and stirred every 5 minutes for about 15 minutes using convection cook. Turned out fine. Added crumbled feta for some salt. Enjoyed it immensely, and it makes a great leftover to be microwaved at lunch - or served cold.

I read the reviews and heated the oven to 450 and then watched them closely. I also left the cashews whole and I think that kept the small pieces from burning. These are even better the next day. Served beside pasta and roasted tomatoes and roasted garlic. A great vegetarian meal.

I've tried this twice. There must be some mistake--even 15 minutes at 500 degrees yields overdone beans and charred cashews.

I confess: I love green beans, but get bored with the different ways of preparing them. The boyfriend hates green beans, and snarls at me when I bring them home. However, I think this recipe is going to be the go-to recipe for green beans from now on. The roasted cashews, with their buttery taste and slightly chewy, slightly crisp texture, add a whole new dimension to roasted green beans, and provides just the right amount of salt. The shallots contribute their own essence to the dish, but don't scream at you in any way. Now, I much prefer cashews to the typical almonds with my green beans, and the boyfriend deems them "an acceptable way to eat green beans." :-)

Holy smoke! When we opened the oven to stir after 15 minutes the whole thing was a black smoking mess and we had to throw it away. What's the deal?

This is a wonderful recipe and very easy. I made this exactly as written and I will make it many more times in the future. The nuts and the roasting give this dish great flavor. Roasting vegetables changes everything about them. So if you aren't a fan of a particular vegetable, try roasting it and see if that changes your opinion.

Delicious however had the same problem as most others with cashews burning. next time will probably add them halfway through or at the end. shallots got slightly burned as well.

Really like this, tho I think I chopped the cashews a bit much. Used a mini- food processor. The cashews were a nice addition.

We liked this recipe, but overall we think that our usual roasted green beans (toss with olive oil and salt, roast at 450 for 45 minutes) are easier and healthier.

A few observations about this recipe, which worked well for me (no subsitutions) and was a nice twist on regular 'ole grean beans. Though I had left them to drain in a sieve for about 15 minutes, the beans were still wet from being rinsed when I tossed all the ingredients together in the pan. This added extra moisture to the pan which had things steaming for the first 15 minutes or so, instead of roasting, which could be why my beans turned out well and didn't burn (and I also used a smaller-ish pan for the roasting). The presence/absence of this extra water could have impacted the results of the other reviewers (?). In an abundance of caution, I did dial the temp down about 10 degrees, but I ended up having to cook them for about 35 minutes. I did stick my hands in every 10 minutes to toss everything around the pan. Still, they were delicious.

This recipe should not even get one fork, it is obviously wrong. I followed instructions exactly, but nuts starting burning after 10 minutes. After 15 minutes I had to toss whole thing. There needs to be more careful editing of recipes.

Delicious, and so easy! I served this with the paprika roast chicken and some plain couscous for a great meal. My only problem is that the beans and some of the shallot pieces got blackened, maybe stirring them around during cooking would help.

Tasty combination, but the shallots and some of the cashews burned... I'll definitely make this one again, but maybe try a lower oven temp.

I wonder if the temperature of 500 F.and 25 minutes roasting time is correct. My green beans cooked in 10 minutes and the cashews were mostly burned. I like the combination, but the method needs adjusting

Wonderful, flavorful and easy preparation for green beans. It is hard to find something different to do with green beans. This one is great.
