This was a "project," but definitely worth the effort. I had some trouble with the buttercream, however. It came out curdled. I added a bit more butter and a tad of confectioners sugar, and it eventually homogenized. The crunch of the walnut brittle in the middle of the cake is what made this cake so good. I put some small maple leaf shortbread cookies around the edges of it for decoration. I served it with a warm bourbon caramel sauce that I had leftover from another dessert. OMG. It was fabulous, if I do say so myself! I would make this again in a heartbeat.

I found this recipe very complicated but I enjoyed the challenge. The outcome was beautiful but a little too rich for my taste. My best advice is to follow the directions and make the investment in a good candy thermometer. I wouldn't make this again as it took quite some time. But it was an interesting experience and if you have patience give it a try!

The taste of this dessert is fantastic, but for the time and effort I didn't think it was quite worth it.

This is a recipe for an experienced cook, who has mastered the art of meringue. Like all pastry the recipe must be followed precisely. I had excellent results. Please keep in mind Gourmet recipes are do not have "how to" directions, but are recipes for the accomplished cook.

I made this twice. The first time I had a lot of trouble with the brittle, it just would not come out right, so I found another recipe for that part. The rest came out great, I made it all in one day and had no trouble with the cake or frosting - all was delicious. The 2nd time, as the recipe indicated I could - I tried making the frosting the day before. This proved to be a big mistake. It was perfect when I made it, but by the next day when I went to assemble it, it had separated and gotten large lumps, pretty gross. I tried rescuing it with more beating, but that would not work, tried thickening with more butter - also would not work. In the end, it was edible but ugly, and I have no idea what happened! I think this is a finicky recipe, not for beginners, but if you get it right, it's great. Just don't trust the brittle recipe, I think the suggested heats were all off.

Upon visiting Epicurious to print this recipe out for my sister-in-law, who tasted it at my house on Christmas night, I was amazed to see any less than stellar reviews for this fabulous dessert and had to add my comments. This is an exquisite dessert that had my guests talking about it all evening! I found the cake flavorful and light; the buttercream was not the greasy glob I've seen other reviewers claim it to be: it was fluffy and full of flavor. There was an enormous amount that cloaked the whole roll - inside and out - with a decadently luscious frosting with a golden glow to it. It was Christmas, though, and I ran out of time to try the walnut brittle. This dessert really stood on its own without further decoration. One thing I do remember, which may have contributed to disappointing results for other people - you do have to put in your time with the electric mixer! It's a worthwhile investment, though.

I'm not an experienced cook, so maybe I blew it, but I had the opposite problem that others had. Buttercream: Great. Light, fluffy, and easy to spread into just the look I wanted. Cake: Not great. Too thin and course. Had a hard time peeling-off the wax paper. Brittle: Bad. I started to put the brittle on and realized that it looked, frankly, like barf.

Agree, the cake part was wonderful. But the buttercream "deflated" and was not thick enough to fill the rolled cake. I did it twice, then gave up and made the maple meringue and folded in whipped cream; this actually had a more maple-y flavour, and was nice and light, and our guests all went for seconds. I also found the brittle didn't spread thinly enough to make enough for the shards, but I didn't care for those as decorations anyway. I chopped the brittle into smaller pieces than shown in the magazine, and it was a little easier on the teeth.

I loved the crunch in the layers, and the cake itself was good and easy to form, but the buttercream that went with this recipe just turned me off. Also had problems with the shards of walnut brittle.

A light and delicious desert, refined taste of maple, not overpowering at all. I followed all the "tested" instructions and was impressed by the result: the brittle caused no problem at all. My only wish would be for the cream to be lighter - we found it too "buttery". You can always spread it very thinly on the base before rolling. Would half the butter still have the same effect? If anyone tries it, please let me know.

I will surely make this one again. One note: The recipe for the cake is right on the money, the butter cream is divine. The brittle however, is a terrible recipe. If you feel that you must follow the recipe, I might suggest that you take five dollars and set fire to it, as the end result is the same. I highly recommend Emily Luchetti's "Four Star Desserts" and the recipe for macadamia nut brittle. I used this, substituting walnuts, and the resulting brittle was perfect.

This was absolutely wonderful! I made it over the course of three days (cake one day, buttercream and brittle the next, then finally assembled). I decorated it with the brittle and some hand painted almond paste animals. The flavor was excellent and perfect for the holidays.

This is absolute decadence for maple and walnut lovers. The frosting is divine and the brittle adds a wonderful crunchyness to the filling. The cake itself was easy to make and I had no problems getting it to roll into the log form. I made two of these, one for an auction and one for a party and each cake did not fail to elicit numerous oohs and aahs.
