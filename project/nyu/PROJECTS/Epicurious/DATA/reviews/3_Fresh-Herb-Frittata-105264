I tried the baked version, and it was totally liquid after the recommended 15 minutes at 300. Thanks to a previous reviewer, I knew how much time to add, but the omelet came out "just ok". I would try this again, but in the pan only.

What a disappointment! I wanted to make the baked omelet version, and the dish was totally liquid after 30 minutes in a 300 oven, so I upped it to 325 and added 15 more minutes in 5 minute increments, until a tester came out clean, and it wound up rubbery and basically tasteless! This was for company and nobody commented on it out of kindness. Never again!

My parents are from Friuli and I grew up on fabulous food from the Friuli region. This is a yummy frittata. In Friuli, one would use finely chopped rosemary, basil, swiss chard, young green radicchio, and arugula. The cheese has to be Montasio or Friulano for an authentic flavour. Will definitely make this again, and again, and again. Mandi furlans.

This was my first fritata, and it luckily didn't end up on the floor. I served it at a brunch party and everyone loved it. I used aged asiago cheese because I couldn't find montasio.

parsley, sage, rosemary, thyme and...basil! This is wonderful. And Brooklyn, you've inspired me to grow herbs on my fire-escape in Manhattan!

We made our own smaller-scale version of this recipe on Sunday. Fresh herbs (basil, mint, thyme, parsley) and halved grape-tomatoes all from our fire-escape garden sauteed in a bit of butter. Add a few eggs beaten with milk and proceed as omelette, with some Irish white cheddar. Divine!

This was my first time making a frittata, and I found this receipe very easy. For herbs, I used kentucky colonel mint, sweet basil, cilantro, celery and beet leaves. I was unable to find the recommended cheese in my grocery store and substituted with gorgonzola. Delicious!
