This makes a GREAT broth. In fact you can double the broth and freeze it. This soup has so much flavor!! It seriously has no calories - OK it does the same as 9 Lifesavers or 5 Jelly Bellies. I'm not kidding. You can substitute different vegetables and it's great when you puree the 2 cups of vegetables from the stock too. You can leave the pasta out if you want. The garnish of basil and cheese make it look even yummier. I can't believe I made this after saving the recipe for 11 years. I was worried about the Light part. So glad I didn't miss out on this keeper.

This was just okay- not the flavorful veggie soup I was hoping for. I'll keep looking for a great recipe .

WOW! used whatever veggies I had left in the fridge pre shopping day. Followed the instructions to a T. Heeded the advice to add some pureed veggies. Best soup I have ever had.

This soup is really delicious. I replaced the peas with 1 cup kidney beans. Also, I pureed 1 of the cups of reserved broth vegetables before adding it to enhance the soup's texture. Even though the broth did take a long time to make, it wasn't difficult and it was definitely tasty.

If you are going to make double and freeze it, don't add the pasta until you divide it. It will be better to add the pasta when you reheat.

Oh my goodness was this awesome! We ate the whole pot and now I'm going to have to start all over. Its a heck of alot of prep to do this soup so you may want to double it and freeze the extra...if there is any extra. I thought this was the best minesrone soup ever. Just remember...NO SHORT CUTS

Really good soup - nice departure from traditional minestrone. Made a few vegetable substitutions, went heavy on the roasted garlic, and after reducing the stock, blended all the veggies and threw back in the pot.

I made this for a camping trip and it was delicious. I added the tomatoes first and blended it with a stick blender to smooth it out. Then I added the macaroni and veggies (which I sauteed quickly to give them a bit of colour and a little extra flavour), though I left out the peas as it had quite a lot of stuff in it already with the beans, pasta, green beans, zucchini and leftover veggies from the stock-making. It still looked chock-full of goodness. And very tasty with grilled cheese sandwiches.

I've been searching for a tasty vegetarian soup, and this one is terrific! I blended two cups of the extra stock veggies in the food processer and thickened up the soup a bit.

A delicious, comforting soup. I made it for my 5 roommates, and there weren't any leftovers! A good sign in my house. The stock was a bit time consuming, but worth it.

The Roasted Vegetable Broth is what makse this a standout; it is not optional.

Great recipe! Definitely take the extra time to make the vegetable broth -- FABULOUS addition!

The roasted vegetable broth was phenomenal! This was a very rich-tasting, yet light soup, with excellent flavor. The only drawback was that preparing the broth was very time consuming and labor intensive, with all the chopping and cutting...

Wonderful. I doubled the pasta which makes it more like a hearty stew and added corn. This is now one of my new favorites!

yum! this is so satisfying in winter. I used canned vegetable broth and added the tomatoes with their juice, also added the chard and a whole can white beans and onions and parsnips (since I didn't do the whole broth prep)

I made this based on everyone's rave reviews, but I have to say I wasn't bowled over (a little soup humor there!). It's a filling soup recipe, there is enough stuff in here and it makes plenty, but I didn't find it to be so great given the time and effort that goes in to making it.

Eating healthily doesn't get better than this. I substituted 1 cup of drained white beans for the peas and included half of the liquid from the tomatoes. A wonderful, satisfying meal.
