Everyone really liked this including my 8 year old granddaughter. The soup is really blah without the toppings and garnish. I let the soup simmer to thicken it as it was a little thin after 25 minutes. I sauteed some of the leeks and combined them with the cabbage garnish for serving. I bought presliced cabbage that I chopped up a little. I chopped the leeks (in the processor)and then rinsed them in cold water to get the dirt off.

Just finished making this soup to serve for Easter Brunch tomorrow. Its lovely and was easy, just loads of chopping. Made no changes but omitted the garlic as it competes with the delicate flavour of leeks. Honestly using garlic with leeks is just a waste of good leeks. Parmesan rind did add something as does the lemon creme fraiche. Mine is much more green than the picture which looks rather brown.

Have you ever noticed how much soup they eat in English period dramas? Well, it got to me, so I made this today in expectation of a cozy winter ahead. Made it exactly to the recipe and it was absolutely delicious! No need to thin out, which would depend on the starch content in the potatoes. Nice hunk of regiano rind and bay rounds out the flavour depth, and the lemon creme fraiche is just perfect. If this soup isn't all gone by tomorrow, I'll freeze in portion size serves for 'fast food' when required, and make the lemon creme fraiche again later. Yumm!!

Really delicious! Cooked it as written with no variations and loved it simply served with some good homemade bread. I think the idea of adding pancetta would be great too...a little salty-sweet crunch to go along.

Easy and delicious! I used beef stock instead of chicken and added grated parmesan cheese- tasted great!

Wonderful and delicate. I made it just as written except for a little less butter and the addition of one chopped carrot (and no chive - which are hard to find - for garnish). The lemon creme fraiche adds a lovely touch of richness and zing in an otherwise fairly light recipe. Instead of blenderizing, I used the immersion blender- it came out fine and it was much simpler. I would definitely make this again and serve it to company.

What a wonderful soup! I was looking for something low calorie before the days of feasting begin. Lemon creme fraiche is an absolute must. My daughter even liked it. I crisped up a bit of pancetta to add to the garnish. Will be making this numerous times over the winter!

Loved this soup and served it for company who requested it afterwards. I did add half an onion in with the leeks and some celery in with the cabbage. I used goats milk yogurt instead of Crete fraiche and everyone loved it!

I totally forgot the garlic--but other than that, made it as written with homemade very gelatinous chicken stock from roasted chicken bones. This is a pretty low fat recipe, given the amount of servings one gets out the whole recipe. Delicious!

Loved it and we had every ingredient in the garden so that's always a pleasure. Fascinating that someone felt the cabbage flavor was too strong. I thought that with six cups of cabbage, it would be overwhelmed with cabbage but actually none of us could taste the cabbage! We used chicken broth from one of our chickens that we slaughtered last week so that added a really nice and fresh flavor.

I thought his soup was very nice. The flavor is mild. Ate it with plain creme fraiche the the first time and made the lemon creme fraiche for it tonight. I loved the added lemon flavor. Don't skip it!

Make this if you like savory soup. I finished it with some cream. I also boiled the potatoes a bit before I added them to the rest of the ingredients. The first couple of taste test the raw potato was pretty noticable but after about 20 mins simmering that went away.

I made this soup last night, and was very, very happy with the results! I made it exactly as instructed, except for the bay leaf and chives, which I didn't have. It came out pretty thick, and I probably should have thinned it down a bit (though I ran out of vegetable broth), but in the end I kind of liked the chunky consistency. I used greek yogurt instead of creme fraiche and the flavors blended fantastically. I'll definitely make this again!

excellent soup can be made lighter by not adding cream .just by adding 1/4 cup skimmed milk

The only flavorful part this soup was when I spooned into where the lemon creme fraiche was swirled in. Otherwise,this was too much effort for a bland creation. If I closed my eyes, I would think it was possibly Vichyssoise....no discernable flavor except for potato. Maybe the ratios were off? Obviously I would not make this again.

Beh Meh---the soup was OK, but not worth the effort. I deleted it from my recipe box.

Delicious. I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and it turned out great.

The addition of cabbage and absence of milk make this tasty soup seem creamy...without any cream. In fact, I liked it best even without the creme fraiche and just a few chives. I added some whole wheat croutons, because I like that texture with a creamed soup, but it is perfect without it. We ate it hot, but I know it would be delicious cold.

OMG, this is the best soup ever, be sure to use the parmesan rind it gives another wonderful flavor to the soup. No need for any cream!

Made as directed, was too strong cabbagey taste, we ate it but didn't really like it, won't make again. If I'm gonna eat cabbage cooked, I'd rather have it tempered a bit (say stuffed cabbage w/tomato sauce) or else served proudly (unblended soup), not to mention in cole slaw...

This soup was great! The only extra thing I added was one tbsp of lemon pepper.

Really delicious soup, that was so simple to make. The lemon cream is key to add freshness. Will definitely make it again, especially since the entire family enjoyed it.

This was good...Not quite as good as the version my mom makes, but good nonetheless. I used FAGE Total 2% yogurt instead of creme fraiche or sour cream.
