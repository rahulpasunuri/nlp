The trick is to use Hudson Valley Camembert...it is unlike any in the world. Any other boxed, dried out, or greasy imposter wouldn't turn out right. If you didn't grow up near the Old Chatham Farm as I did, you can buy this cheese in specialty stores, and Whole Foods (or online from the farm).

Ugh! Talk about grease overload! The truffle essence idea is a good one...I think I'll try it with my regular fondue recipe. But I will never make this one again.
