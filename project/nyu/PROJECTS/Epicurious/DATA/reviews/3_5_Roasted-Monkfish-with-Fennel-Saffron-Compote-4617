Simply stunning. I only had access to supermarket bought goods, but the Monkfish was fresh (and on sale, bonus), and the dish was superb. One really needs to be generous with the saffron, both in the compote, and the marinade, and you get a gorgeous, delectable dish. If you skimp on the saffron, the colour and the flavour will both suffer, and you've wasted quite a bit of good money. I can't stress enough; it's worth spending that little bit more, and damn the torpedoes when using the saffron. 15 minutes yielded perfectly cooked fish, just flaking, moist, lovely!

The keys to making this dish work are really good monkfish and wild fennel, both of which I had on hand. Chopped wild fennel fronds give the dish more color and its seeds, ground or whole, have more punch than the supermarket variety.

Too bland, no color.

Love monkfish, love fennel, saffron but this was pretty icky. Color is important to me, & this dish was too beige. I thought it would taste clean and simple, but it was just bla. I will admit that I used frozen monfish, which was a terrible choice-fibrous and spongy. Fresh probably would have made a big difference. Sadly, we chucked the whole dish & had grilled cheese.

I didn't have fennel so I skipped the compote and served with sauteed kale - the fish was terrific and so easy

truly wonderful. i put the fennel and onions through a mandolin and then chopped it up to shorten the sauteeing time to 40 minutes. didn't have fennel seeds but it was still abolutely beautiful. also good with steamed broccoli and carrots. maripazb

Super recipe and great for a dinner party because of the do-ahead-ability. I had many compliments at a party for 11 where I substituted grouper for monkfish (based on what looked good at the fish counter). I cut down on olive oil and also served a mixed dish of rice, sauteed red pepper & spinach with garlic, golden raisins goat cheese. Also served 4 other dishes based on BA recipes. You've been at my parties for years!

An evocative reminder of the Mediterranean. Quite good as the recipe goes, but lacking in accents of color. The dish was improved by serving it surrounded by leafs of raddichio filled with mounds of spinach wilted with a nut of butter and a dash of olive oil, pinch of nutmeg and pepper.Reserve fronds of fennel to sprinkle on top of the fish slices. As a pleasant accompaniment, Farfalle tossed with olive oil, slivers of sun dried tomatoes and parsley, Parmesan, if you like. Definitely a keeper, elegant and unusual.
