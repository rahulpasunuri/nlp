This is a very rich and delicious chocolate ice cream BUT I didn't really taste the "malt". Because of that, I dispensed with the malted milk balls and tossed in some toasted almonds. Next time I make it, I'll definitely up the amount of malted milk powder.

All I can say is WOW. This is our favorite ice cream recipe now. I used half and half in place of the cream and 2 percent milk to replace the whole milk. I didn't have any powdered milk so omitted that. It was extremely rich as made so I can't imagine using cream and whole milk. I thought the malted milk balls could be omitted but my husband really liked the crunch they added. Almonds might be a good sub for the malted milk balls.

This ice cream was very creamy and chocolatey. I was almost like frozen chocolate pudding (a good one though not the Jello variety). I didn't even add the malted milk balls at the end as I had already eaten them:)
