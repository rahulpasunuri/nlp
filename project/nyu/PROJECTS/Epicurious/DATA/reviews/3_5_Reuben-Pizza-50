This sounds delicious & I want to try substituting some of the flour in my homemade pizza dough with rye flour and adding caraway seeds, but would that be too strange? Does anyone have suggestions on how to modify the crust to make it taste like rye bread?

Had our 5th annual neighborhood Oktoberfest this past weekend with about 100 people attending. This was the winning entry for our "Best German Side Dish" category (we also do Best Home Brew, and Best Desert, as well as bring your own sausages to grill). Two different neighbors baked and entered this same recipe without knowing the other had also cooked it. They ended up having to split the prize and share the crown. One of them created a version with a store-bought fresh dough and pre-cooked the dough prior to applying the mustard. That version was my personal favorite. A local beer bar owner (and Oktoberfest sponsor) is now going to add this to his Happy Hour Menu throughout October. Really great stuff!

I was worried that the sauerkraut would make the dough soggy, so I pressed the sauerkraut until it was dry -- a mistake, because the topping could have used more moisture. Will make this again when we have leftover corned beef, but will drain the sauerkraut without compressing it to death!

We loved this! Maybe we could rename it "Reuben flatbread" to avoid the incriminating fusion label. Don't you hate it when you order samosas and satay off a "tapas" menu?

I used a full size Boboli thin crust and substitued 1,000 island for the mustard. This was OUTSTANDING. I was so surprised.

This is wildly popular with my friends and I. Like everyone else, I smear Thousand Island dressing on the crust. But, I ALSO mix the sauerkraut with a bit of the Dijon mustard for extra flavour.

Absolutely wonderful. Make on a square crust and cut into bite-sized pieces for an unusual canape.

Made this tonight and used a pre-cooked 12" Mia pizza crust that weighed about 13-1/2 oz. (available at W/M). Used all of the required ingredients on the one pizza (did use deli corned beef). It turned out DELICIOUS!!! Had to bake it 18-20 minutes for it to get hot enough in the middle to make me happy. Next time I would use a wee bit less sauerkraut, as it was a little heavy on that flavor. I served it alone for dinner, and it definitely makes 6 servings, as it is VERY filling!!! Do try this Reuben on a pizza crust!!!

We made it with smoked turkey sausage instead of corned beef and it was excellent. Next time we will try it with the Thousand Island dressing.

Excellent recipe for reuben lovers. I agree on the Thousand Island dressing. I got my corned beef "chipped" and even cut it into small pieces from that just so it was easy to sprinkle over top. The recipe was very quick and easy to prepare. The caraway seeds do make it more "reuben-like". (I believe there may be some sauerkraut out there (Bavarian?) that may already contain the caraway seeds, so you may not need to purchase them.) Can also make one large pizza v. the mini personal pan pizzas. Preheating of the pans does make the crust crispier.

Good, easy. This is very filling and probably serves 6-8 people instead of 4.

I used 1000 Island instead of mustard - was really good. Just like a real Reuben Sandwich but much easier to fix for company than toasting the sandwiches. And my "bridge club girls" loved it!

Incredible! Also good with Thousand Island dressing!
