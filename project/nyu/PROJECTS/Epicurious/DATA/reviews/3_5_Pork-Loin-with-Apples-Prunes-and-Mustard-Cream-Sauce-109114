I reviewed this recipe in 2004 and have been making it ever since. This time, with my fancy new oven and probe, I cooked it to 150F rather than by time and guesstimating. I found it was not pink but thoroughly cooked and a bit dry. Will reduce probe temperature next time. Also, I never add the water to the sauce either. Like the idea of steeping prunes in the wine. Would like re-enabling the 1/2 fork rating system again as!!

Excellent sauce. Used a loin roast and it turned out very well. Guests loved it. Don't think I modified anything - as I usually do.

I made this tonight and was very pleased. Per others' suggestions, I steeped the prunes in the wine (I used marsala), slit the loin through the center and stuffed some of the prunes and apples into the roast, and did not add the water to the sauce because I only had half & half on hand instead of heavy cream. The meat was nicely flavored by the fruit. By leaving out the water, the sauce was a wonderful consistency. I was surprised to see what a gorgeous brown it turned once the drippings from the roasting pan were deglazed and stirred into the sauce. The roast began to smoke quite a bit so I turned the oven down to 350 about half way through cooking; another reason to use a probe thermometer instead of a clock when cooking large chunks of meat. I pulled the roast at 150 and it was perfectly done without a bit of dryness and a wonderful brown crust.

Yum! I cut the loin in half lengthwise and stuffed it with fresh thyme and some apple slices, otherwise cooked as directed. It was delicious. I could have taken it out sooner though -- at 40 minutes the temp was already above 160, so when I do it again I will take it out after 30 minutes.

Excellent!! The other reviews really helped in the making of this dish. I used shallots instead of onions and doubled the sauce. Everyone LOVED it. I did not reduce the size of the apples nor thicken the sauce with cornstarch (the sauce - I think - is thick enough). It looks beautiful on a platter served at the table with an extra bowl of the sauce.

This is more 3.5 forks... delicious as written, and really yummy with minor tweaks (I thickened the sauce at the end with about a TBS of cornstarch and sliced the apples a little finer than quarters as other reviewers suggested.) Excellent method for cooking pork loin.

I took the advice of others and substituted shallots for onions. I didn't have prunes so I used golden raisins and dried cranberries along with the apple. I had to thicken the sauce a bit as well. I used a rub of kosher salt, dried thyme (didn't have fresh) and cracked pepper for the pork loin. I enjoyed it.

This recipes contains a hidden gem... an awesome technique for pork lion roast. The roast technique yields the moistest and most edible pork loin roast I've made to date... it's even moist on reheat in the microwave. However the sauce here doesn't impress in the slightest. The flavors are rather lackluster. If I were to make it again, I'd replace the water with apple cider or juice for starters. In the end, I've made way better apple cream sauce for pork roast and now I've got an awesome roasting technique.

Made this exactly to the recipe. I am so tired of cooking pork as it turns out dry and tough. The sauce was okay and this is not a recipe that I would try again.

After reading all the reviews I made this recipe with twice the sauce, which was definitely the way to go. I made a slit in the meat before roasting it and stuffed it with fresh rosemary, shallots, and apples. I made brussel sprouts with toasted almonds and shallots as a side and some of the toasted almonds got into the meat sauce - the crunchiness was exactly what it needed. I will definitely sprinkle toasted almonds over the top when serving this dish next time!

I made this recipe last night with pork tenderloin for a very large dinner group. Instead of putting the prunes into the sauce, I marinated them in white wine and then made a slit throught the tenderloin and stuffed it with the prunes. It gave the meat great flavor. I added the left over marinade to the sauce. My only problem was the sauce was a little to thin, so I had to thicken it a little with cornstarch. I prepared the sauce ahead of time, so I just has to heat it when dinner was ready. This was a wonderful entree, was easy, looked good and tasted wonderful.

Made this for larger party, and everyone loved it! In the craziness of all our guests in our kitchen, I forgot to add the wine and mustard! It was still well received, and I will add those 2 ingredients next time I make it. I added more cream, and more chicken broth, in place of the water.

This was a wonderful entree, easily used for a special dinner. The only thing I would change is doubling or even tripling the sauce. It's that good!

Instead of onions, I used shallots for an earthier flavor. And I also used thyme on the loin itself while roasting. It was amazing.

Thiwas delicious and not too complicated. Since I am not trying to recreate the Scandi original, the one change I would make would be to addsome thyme to the sauce.

Yummy! I followed the suggestions to dredge and I added some cayenne to the flour. I just about licked my plate. My husband loved it as well.

Just great. Recipe worked like a charm.. although I would watch the cooking time of the pork.. with a smaller piece of meat, the temp rise on standing was higher than I expected. I like my pork shy of the 160 temperature mark.

We really enjoyed this dish. The mix of flavors was very complimentary. I didn't change anything, but next time would add some cayenne pepper, as just the mustard didn't quite add enough "oomph"

Great company dish. I just left the pork loin whole, tied it, browned on all sides, then roasted it according to the directions. I also dredged it in flour, salt, and pepper prior to browning it. Excellent dish for company--had the roast in the oven and the fruit and cream sauce done before the guests even arrived, pulled out the roast during the soup course, and finished it with pan juices just prior to serving. Beautiful and delicious!

This is one of the yummiest pork recipies I have ever tried!!! I made if for my family the night before Thanksgiving and they loved it so much they want me to make it again for Christmas dinner. I am not a fan of prunes, so I substituted port wine for the prunes and since this added additional liquid I let the sauce reduce a little more. It added a great flavor without the pieces of prune in the sauce. Another really important thing in making this is to ensure that you do not over cook the pork. Follow the instructions and let the pork cook only until it reaches 150 degrees on the meat thermometer. The pork finishes cooking itself while you finish the sauce. This ensures that the meat turns out juicy and moist!

I feel bad giving this 3 forks, since I accidentally used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream (they come in such similar containers around here!) so I don't think the mouth feel of the recipe was quite right. it was quite tasty as it was, but I'm looking forward to trying it with cream, the way it SHOULD be made, to pull all those yummy flavors together better.

This dish was so rich in flavor, even the kids loved it! I will do it again, only next time use a little less apple and thinly sliced rather than in wedges.

This sauce is tops even without the apples which I did not have on hand. A bit too much onion for my taste will cut down a bit next time.

I've served this at dinner parties three times in the past year. First time I made it, a guest went back for thirds! It's always a hit, loaded with flavor. Last night I had a vegetarian at the table. Made one pork tenderloin using this recipe, and in another pan prepared a vegetarian soy-protein "breakfast sausage" (in a "tube" that would ordinarily be cut into sausage patties). Flattened and elongated it a bit to match the size/shape of the tenderloin. Dredged in flour before browning it in a little olive oil stovetop while browning the tenderloin in another pan. Put the veg "sausage" in its own baking dish in the oven when I put the tenderloin in. Made the veg stove-top sauce with vegetable stock (store-bought). The browned bits from the flour dredging gave some depth to this sauce, as did the seasoning already in the faux sausage. Aside from it being a lot of different pans to maneuver, it was a wonderful way to meld the vegetarian main dish with the rest of the meal.

I made this without the prunes and apples and was quite happy. I should have used fresher mustard. The wine needn't have been the driest of dry (I used kabinett Riesling) and vidalia onions (presently in season). DO NOT, under any circumstances, miss the pan drippings sauce. Mine turned deep brown and was spectacular; I wish I had more of it. Use medium-low heat when adding the cream to avoid curdling.

I found this dish to be pretty bland as is. But with 12 people coming for dinner, I had to work with what I had. So I added some of my daughter's applesauce, some cinammon and some Dijon mustard, pureed the whole thing with a handheld blender and ended up with a creamy, tangy, sweet/savory concoction that the guests loved. Everyone was intrigued by what was in the sauce. The whole grain mustard gave it a nice appearance with the heavy grain. I used tenderloin that I roasted the day before, sliced it thin, added it to the sauce and reheated the whole thing the day of the dinner party. The sauce got even better tasting overnight and the pork was very tender from soaking and reheating in the sauce. Very easy for entertaining a large crowd as you can make the whole thing ahead of time. I'll definitely make this again, but with my own embelishments.

This was wonderful, I didn't have a problem with curdeling. Normally I play around with receipes, but this was perfect as it was. My husband loved it!!!

A hit with guests and relatively easy to make - mixing the cream in with the fruits made the cream curdle a bit, but it tasted fine. Low-maintenance hit for dinner party.

Very easy to make, and great flavor. Be careful with the mustard, as it can overpwoer the swettnss of the prunes and apples. I liquefied the sauce briefly on a blender and strained it to give it a gravy-like consistency, and came out great.

So wonderful! The perfect fall dish... very company worthy! Served w/ wild rice with pecans and cranberries, baked acorn squash, and pumpkin cheesecake. My father-in-law was in heaven! Highly recommend.

This was very good. I made it with individual double thick boneless pork loin chops from Niman Ranch. Cooking time was obviously much less.

I'm trying this tonight but I have one question. Why get a rolled roast, tied by the butcher, if you are going to cut it in halves? It would probably fall apart! I notice most people reviewing it used tenderloins anyway, but I am going to try it with an intact rolled loin roast, which will take longer to cook.

Made this for my boyfriend who claims not to care for pork.....We polished off the entire roast in 2 meals. I enjoyed making it as it was very simple considering the wonderful result..The roast was very moist and tender and the sauce was heaven.

This is pretty good. I made a half portion which was sufficient to serve my husband and myself and provide leftovers. Followed the recipe exactly except for using only a half-tablespoon of mustard (it's not one of my favourite conditments). Quite nice and mother-in-law worthy.

Shame on the cook from Conneticut for throwing this wonderful dish away--must be fussy eaters-stick to your bland tastes like celery then--This is a good recipe!

Rating: 1
I made this to the recipe----I have never literally thrown away a dinner before, but this one was chucked midway through. It was terrible, too bad, the meat was moist, but it was universally hated by my family. We opted for celery instead, it was that bad. This is the first bad recipe I have made from this site, so I am not taking it too personally!!

What a great dish for entertaining. A must make. For those of you concerned about the 1/2 cup of heavy cream, this recipe serves eight, do the math...that's ONE tablespoon of cream per person! Make it, eat it, enjoy it, and then go take a walk around the block! Please remember Julia's advice...everything in moderation.

Like other reviewers, I used pork tenderloin for this dish and used light cream in the sauce to cut down on the calories. Even with the light cream, the sauce was full of flavor -- the mustard and cream with fruit is a great combination -- and I will definitely make this again.

How could this not be delicious with all that cream? I made it tonight and the sauce was delish! I also made it with pork tenderloin. Real keeper, but maybe only for special occasions, since it is very rich.

Served this for a Valentines dinner party and it was a big hit. As suggested substituted pork tenderloin. Browned the tenderloin in advance and made the sauce ahead of time as well, keeping it warm on the back of the stove. Served the pork with the sage and white cheddar mashed potatoes - another recipe from this site - and haricots vert with toasted hazelnuts. This combo will definitely become one of my entertaining staples. Easy, elegant, and a surefire crowd pleaser.

I used pork tenderloin for this dish, and it turned out fantastic. The sweetness of the fruit cuts the sharp edge of the mustard, and the addition of cream mellows it all out. I did add a little more white wine near the end to thin it out, as it reduced almost too well. We really enjoyed this dish and will be making it again.

The whole family loved this dish, and it was easy to make. Used pork tenderloins, which worked very well and cut down on the cooking time. The broth and water looked like a lot of liquid when I added them, but cooked down nicely. Will definately make again.
