This tastes just like my favorite cake from childhood. Watch the baking time though; it didn't need the full time and dried out a little. Regardless, the flavor was exceptional.

Simply great! Thank you, Dora. This cake is easy to make and so tasty. Great with tea on a cold morning. Smells fabulous. Real estate agents should advise home sellers to pop this in the oven instead of all those silly ideas of perfuming the home with some homey scents to make the potential buyer feel at home :-)

Delicious cake for the morning. Double all the spices for more flavour.

I really liked this reciped and it got great reviews from everyone who ate it. I did make some substitutions as I did not have all the ingredients. I did'nt have enough regular flour so I used 1 cup regular flour and 1 cup stoned ground flour which gave it a wonderful texture. Also instead of cloves I used allspice. I didn't have raisins so I used dried apricots which I chopped up. It was great and I will make it again. Everyone wanted the recipe.

I was looking for a new recipe this year and found this one. It is just perfect. Not too sweet and very moist. Everyone loved it and it freezes well.

Excellent cake, more lovely & delicious than it sounds. I made into muffins to try myself first then made a loaf for a hostess gift at Christmas (it was very well received!). The crumb of this cake is dense but very very tender & velvety soft so it works better as a loaf than muffins. Beautiful with a flavored butter (whisky butter, orange butter) or honey. I can't wait to make this again for myself this time!

This is an extremely versatile recipe. I served this for dessert and then ate it again for breakfast the next morning. I used spelt flour instead of wheat and it came out fine. It tastes fabulous, especially with some honey or butter on top.

Wonderfully spiced cake! I baked it in a sunflower silicone cake pan and it came out beautifully. I did have to bake it for about 1.5 hours, but that may be the silicone or just my oven. Will definately make this again!

Made this for my grandma, she loved it and so did I!

a beautiful and delicate loaf/cake. Perfect with tea. However, I did NOT require the full baking time and advise fellow cooks to check it at 55 minutes...otherwise the top could wind up burned and bitter.

This bread smells really good in the oven and reminds me of my grandma's wonderful baking.I toasted a couple thin slices and put peanut butter and grape jelly on them to make one tasty sandwich. seriously, guys. try that.

Pretty good and simple. didn't have raisins but I guess it would add moisture. Perfect as an afternoon snack!

I changed the spices slightly to suit my taste and soaked the whole thing in bourbon and it turned out really well. Held up to the liquor nicely. I just left the rasins out since several of my friends don't care for them (made this for a party). Well received and will definitely make again.

The loaf grew on me as I kept eating it! Substituted nutmeg for ginger (had none) and accidentially added 1t. of baking powder. Baked at 350 degrees to get it done faster too. My bread is a little dry, not sure if it was the baking powder or the chng in temp.

A moist and delicious cake but does anyone know how to eliminate the raisins? I didn't think they were necessary. I also felt it needed a little more honey flavor - maybe I could drizzle some on individual slices.

I wasn't sure what to expect from this, based on the varied reviews, but I doubled the recipe and it turned out great! Very flavorful! I made it for a recent wine party and guests loved it. I served it with some soft cream cheese and the combination was perfect!

I must've done something wrong. Usually, results in my kitchen are in line with the previous reviews. I have a great oven, followed the recipe to the letter - almost - and mine came out totally underbaked. Toothpick came out clean, topped looked browned and mostly done, but I thought it didn't look quite set. I knew I was right when I went to 'turn it out' on rack (more like 'dump it out'). Instead of raisins I used dried cranberries. Could this be the reason for the goopy mess? It all sounded so good...and looked good on the outside. Maybe I'll give it another try.

I made this as a gift for my friend's birthday, who is a spice cake afficionado. she loved it and requested it again for her birthday this year.

I made this when I found myself with loads of honey. It is excellent. It's also very tasty when toasted for breakfast. I found that the raisins clumped together when just mixed in so I set aside some of the sugar and stirred it into the raisins which kept them separate. This recipes doubles well.

I would simply like to know if I can contact the author of this recepie from Guadalajara since I'm from Mexico City it would be interesting to share ideas about the site and recepies, etc in Spanish!

I haven't tried this recipe yet but I do want to let you know that the magazine says 2/3 cup honey and not 1/8 cup.
