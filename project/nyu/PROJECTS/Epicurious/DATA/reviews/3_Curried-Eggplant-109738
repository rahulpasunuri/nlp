Nice n' tasty. I took some of suggestions and added some spinach and served with yogurt. I also substitued chipotle pepper paste for jalapenos to get a bit more kick.

This dish is a good foundation for a great eggplant curry. However, I agree with most of the reviewers: It takes some jazzing up. I went the way of coconut milk and alot more spice... oh, and some spinach.

Boring. I thought as I was preparing it that there was not enough spice paste, and I was right. I added some soy sauce at the end just to give it a little flavor.

Wished the dish had some more protein or more...something was missing.

Loved this recipe! We're real eggplant fans and this was a new twist that we really enjoyed, even the picky 14 year old who had seconds and almost licked the plate. Really wouldn't change a thing (altho I did use regular globe eggplants because it was what I had).

Very good recipe. We increased the quantity of spice and omitted the sugar. Nice with a green thai chile substituted for the jalopeno.

We made this exactly as the recipe called; loved it; used leftovers with pita bread and yogurt for sandwiches the next day.

I couldn't get the small eggplants, so I used two globe eggplants cut into 3/4 inch cubes. This, I know, yielded a very different, but not unappealing, texture. I unrepentedly omitted the brown sugar. Following the advice of previous reviewers, I doubled the cumin and ginger . Even at that, the dish was underwhelming, but it has three-fork potential. It was better after two days in the refrigerator. It was also good at room temperature. The mustard seeds added a nice texture. The simple addition of a little more salt improved the dish as well. Next time I will go to the Farmer's Market to get the proper eggplants and will add more of all flavorings, especially the jalapenos.

hmmm, I actually thought that this recipe was really boring. I had to add a bunch of feta and sundried tomatoes and anything with flavor that I could find to spice it up..that worked well, but I do recommend adding something to this recipe..or you could fall asleep consuming it.

I love eggplant and this dish does it justice. However, I easily, easily doubled the cumin and mustard and next time will up the garlic and ginger a bit. It's a great dish for civilians (to curry and such), but needed some oomph. I also didn't care for the cilantro with it- distracted from the subtle and complex flavors of the eggplant. And normally I'll throw cilantro on anything!

A real family pleaser. My daughter can't wait to make it for a dinner party with her college friends this week. Go easy on the brown sugar. It is easy to get it too sweet.
