Good, but not the show stopper I was hoping for.

Whenever I want a really special dessert, I make this one. It's always a hit and easy to make as well. It's a family staple. Truly decadent!

Soooo Goooood. I have made this at least a dozen times. Do not change anything. Perfect just the way it is.

Made as per the recipe. We didn't trim the cake as it really wasn't for presentation and we like the crispy/chewy edges. I had no problem with it sweating and as this is a dense cake, we served only very small portions ... business card size. I would not change this recipe except to totally obscure the top of the cake with raspberries next time as I am much more about the raspberries than the cake. :0]

This dish was not bad, but I didn't love it. The cake was very good, moist and rich, but almost gave me a heart attack reading the ingredients (yes, I know, special occasion). I didn't see that the fudge topping did much to enhance the cake, except that it made the raspberries stick. It traveled very well because of that, although in ten minutes out of the fridge it started sweating. I think next time I would make the cake in a springform, and garnish with chambord whipped cream and fresh raspberries, and omit the frosting. Made it along side raspberry streusal bars from Cook's Illustrated, and those went faster.

absolutely delicious. the cake is super moist and fudgy, and the raspberries just sink in. 12 oz didn't seem like quite enough, so I used 18 oz of raspberries, and melted raspberry jam to drizzle on top for added flavor and sweetness.

I've been making these brownies for years, usually to rave reviews. A tip for increasing the raspberry flavor: pierce the bars all over with a knife or skewer and brush on raspberry-flavored liquor before putting the glaze on.

I took the suggestion of another reviewer and halved the cake recipe in an 8x8 pan, baked 35 minutes. I didn't bother removing them from the pan, cutting off the edge, or letting them cool-- they are fantastic warm and so easy.

These are so delicious! I took them to a Bible Study group last night and everyone just raved! They are so chocolatey and also so easy! I found that they do need to be baked for closer to an hour than 45 minutes. The presentation is so beautiful also!

This was sooo good. I was in a terrible hurry when I was baking the cake and I think I took it out too early; it sank in the middle. After pouring the glaze on it, I piled raspberries in the sinkhole and it looked fabulous (and tasted just as good).

This is divine! I didn't cut it into bars but served as a cake. I used Valrhona bittersweet chocolate and it was fabulous from the first bite. I didn't have seedless jam so I heated the seeded jam and pushed through a sieve. The raspberry flavor was subtle so next time I'll use a little more jam. I covered with raspberries and scattered more berries around the side. Next time I'll add a mint sprig for a prettier presentation.

Because of some reviewers' comments that these were too dense, I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 pan. I used roughly the same amount of sauce. They were perfect. Instead of chopping the chocolate, I used Ghirardelli semisweet baking bits, which were rated very highly by Cook's Illustrated.

I made these recently for a party I attended. I think the most entertaining thing about the party was watching the look of ecstasy that passed across the guests faces as they sank into these delectable treats! They are rich, so perhaps they are not for everyone, but they were heaven to me!

I have made these bars several times for different occasions. Everyone always loved them!

This recipe presents well, but I didn't love it. The thick, chewy torte was good, but I think the inclusion of raspberry preserves alters the flavor in a way that I didn't care for. I would prefer a straight chocolate torte with the fresh raspberries on top. It was relatively easy, however and everyone does oooh and ahhh at the presentation. Some of my guests found it way too rich, however. Serve it with coffee or champagne to diffuse/compliment the rich chocolate flavor.

It takes a little more time to make than others but WELL worth it! :-))

Followed reciupe exactly-could not taste the raspberry though. Made these for a gift and they loved it-I on the other hand thought they were just okay.

Chocoholics..this is for you! Would like to try bittersweet for the cake base next time. Covered the top with raspberries picked at a pick-it-yourself farm so I had lots to completely cover the top. Lots of berries adds another texture, temperure thing for your tongue!! Do not skimp. YUM!

I found it delicious, served it as a cake/torte and not as bars. It might be to dense and rich for some (too bad for them...) I might actually use bittersweet next time to make it less sweet.Very beautiful presentation

This is a definite keeper. It looks as good as it tastes. One of my neighbors said it is the richest thing she ever ate!

Like sex for the mouth! I served it as one cake instead of squares. Everyone wanted more!

These were quite good. I made these to put on a brownie platter with mint brownies (same issue of Bon Appetit) and white chocolate brownies. They present SO well. They're pretty to look at and taste great!

This was so yummy and incredibly easy to make. I left off the fresh raspberries as they are out of season this time of year, but I can't wait to make this when they are available. This would be a wonderful accompaniment for a BBQ.

I made this last night as a test, and it was unbelieveable good. I used semisweet chocolate, and was pleasantly surprised that even with the 1 c. of sugar in the batter, the bars were not too sweet. In the final product, the presentation was beautiful, and they resemble petite fours. Also, because of the small amount of flour (1/3 c.), the cake was very soft and melts in the mouth.

I've made this several times, both as a served dessert and as a gift, and it is wonderful!!! My neighbor informs me that I'll never have to give her any other kind of gift for her birthday.

I loved this recipe. I cut them into small squares and then glazed them and topped each with a raspberry. Beautiful!!!!!!!

This is a fabulous dessert for chocolate lovers. I have made it several times, it is so easy to prepare. I have never varied from the recipe-- it is perfect. Also, it looks like it came from a patisserie, the presentation is quite impressive.

The bars were delicious, not too sweet, yet it had the sweet taste in it. It's great with coffee! A must try.

Very good. But if you want better, try the Double Chocolate Cherry Brownies, Bon Appetit, July 1992.

Great with Blue bell Vanilla icecream!

Oh my! These were fabulous. I made them the day before and that seem to only make more dense and fudgy. Very decadent and perfect when you want to impress those who like their choclate!
