Same problem as all the others. My frosting did not hold up. Did not want to add more ps cause did not want it to taste like ps. Next time will chill the frosting before hand.However, the eyeball cupcakes came out perfect!

used all the food colors in the box, more red. Will make again, only will chill the buttercream first. Had tto take breaks as my body heat melted the "brains".

I've made this cupcake recipe for Halloween three years running. (Though I usually frost as eyeballs instead of brains.) It's great. And you can buy organic food coloring if you're worried about the amount.

I don't think all the reviewers here understand that a RED velvet cake is supposed to have lots of food coloring in it, and is not supposed to be very chocolaty.

Cupcakes tasted good and looked very spooky. Maybe the red food coloring was a excessive- will try less next time. Didn't overbake and they were very moist. Also- I made sure to make frosting very thick, then chilled before frosting the cupcakes. I think this allowed 'brain' pattern to hold up.

The cake recipe is unnecessarily complicated. I mixed the batter like a regular cake recipe and it came out fine-moist and not crumbly. But it didn't taste chocolaty enough. It also had way too much food coloring. The frosting recipe was standard but it wasn't easy piping the frosting to look like brains. My cupcakes looked more like worms. The payoff wasn't worth the effort.

The cupcakes were delicious, but the icing wasn't stiff enough to hold the 'brain' shape - I ended up frosting them smooth and making the Halloween Eyeball Cupcakes instead.
