This broth Is delicious and have now made it four times. I went a couple of steps further by adding sautéed wild mushroom and shaved Parmesan cheese just before serving? FYI...If you use the soaked porcinis make sure you rinse them well as there may be some soil/grit. I rinsed them in a strainer and patted them dry.

I took other reviewers suggestions and thought it was delicious. I let the porcini broth really seep, then added both chicken and beef broth and let that boil down for a few extra minutes. Added soy and the wines into the sautéed shallots and added the mushroom broth and cooked down even more. Id make this again.

Yeah idk....something was just wrong... I imagined it to be sort of a wonton-soup type deal. Meh. I wound up just eating the raviolis and then sipping the broth. I probably didn't make it perfectly but... eh. Now i'll have to make porcini risotto with the remaining mushrooms.

I felt like I was having pasta in a soup setting. In the end, the broth was a disappointing accompaniment. I would have preferred something saucier.

I did it last night for the first time and it came out really good. I had to make many many changes though. I used beef broth (more earthy) and only 2 1/2 cups instead of 4 1/2. I added more wine and Sherry. To enhance the porcini flavor I added one "Maggi" porcini cube. Towards the end, I added a splash of soy sauce and boiled the broth for a while so that it would reduce and thicken. I also found wild mushroom and truffle very fresh raviolis. My husband fell in love with the dish and so did I.

This was terrible....totally tasteless...I love all the ingredients but it was so bland. Will NOT make this again.

Very tasty. I let the broth reduce extra long as well (as some of the other reviewers advised), tasting as I went. I added thinly sliced lobster mushrooms and shard because I had them on had. The broth came out very flavourful although it did take quite awhile to get there.

This was so good for us so that we wanted to have it for our company this weekend. This time I am following the advice of the others who wrote about more pepper, sherry, and some thyme, but it wasn't necessary for us--just interesting to try. We do have access to amazing ravioli in Princeton here.

This is the second time I'm using this recipe--the first was the first course for our Christmas dinner. We all liked it then. I've added more sherry and pepper and some thyme, as recommended, but we were not disappointed the first time.

The broth for this was delicious. I used the left over porcini mushrooms to make my own ravioli and I added thyme, more sherry and more black pepper. I served it with an Oregon Willamette Valley Pinot Noir-2003. Fantastic Pairing. I served it third for a five course meal.

After reading the other review that said the broth was bland, I reduced it as well and added a bit more pepper, wine and garlic. It reduced a little less than half and was still plenty for broth... and it was delicious. We ended up dipping our bread in it throughout the meal.

The broth was so incredibly bland, I ended up reducing it by half and using it to make a porcini risotto instead. I don't quite understand why but I guess I have to say "skip this dish".
