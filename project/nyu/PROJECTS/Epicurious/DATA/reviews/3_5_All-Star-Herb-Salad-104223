To this recipe i have added Arugala and watercrest to give it a little of a bitter taste to my last gathering of a Passover Seder,(one of our plates is suppose to be a bitter herb) this salad was a hit.

Like the previous poster, I mixed this "salad" with other greens (in my case, baby spinach) and a couple of grape tomatoes. It was a big hit! I'll remember this as an easy way to dress up simple greens. The mix of herbs is wonderful.

This is an intense and unusual dish. It's not quite a salad, more like a condiment. I happend to have all the fresh herbs on hand in my fridge (i've been doing a lot of cooking lately) so I decided to try this out. If you bought the herbs just for this, it would be very expensive. I tried the salad on its own, as a side dish and found it to be be a bit overwhelming. What worked really well was to mix the herbs with salad greens (I used greenleaf and romaine lettuce mixed). It adds bursts of the herb's taste, while not overhwelming your tastebuds.
