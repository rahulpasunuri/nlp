Great for serving brunch to a group! I used one less cup of milk to prevent excess sogginess (thx reviewers!) and a shot of espresso instead of instant and no extra sugar on top, except for some powerdered sugar decoration.

The flavor of this is OK, a little too sweet, but there was WAY too much liquid. They came out very "mooshy" - the center was like undercooked oatmeal. We'll probably use the recipe for the custard again, but we'll use less (or no) sugar and decrease the amount significantly. Also, we probably would cook it on the stovetop instead of in the oven.

This has to be the furthest thing thing from french toast I have ever tasted. You know the french toast with a crisp brioche with a soft interior well this is not it. French toast is made from a brioche not baguette it is too crusty. It is also a bad recipe for Pain Perdu. It is in my opinion a waste of time!!!

We made this using strong drip brewed coffee, which did add a subtle depth of flavor. This recipe produced a very moist custard style french toast, which puffed dramatically when pulled from the oven. Sweet, creamy flavor and a very soft crumb. A satisfying meal with sauteed turnip greens, bacon, fruit salad, and of course a nice cafè au lait!

Made this twice, used 2% milk instead of whole, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Super easy to make. My husband & I loved it.

I actually made this recipe a while ago and never had a chance to write my review. While I can definitely see the appeal this may have with some people, it didn't do it for me. It was way too custard - y for my tastes. Taste was good, but texture didn't do it for me as a breakfast food. I prefer my french toast to be more american style.

Made this for a brunch get-together and it was a huge hit. Based on previous reviews, I drained off a bit of the custard mixture before baking.

If I had read the reviews before making it I would have realized that I needed to adjust the liquid to bread ratio. It was too moist, so texture was not Ok but taste was. I replaced the instant expresso for the real thing and it added great flavor. If using it this way, please note to adjust the milk amount by amount of expresso you add. I also raised the temperature to 425 for the last 5 minutes so it would get more golden and crispier.

Kind of a tiramisu for breakfast. We all loved it here. I let the bread soak in the milk and eggs for quite a while because the bread was leftover from dinner the night before and pretty dried out. Regardless, it alll worked and everyone was gushing about it. I was real happy with the results.

I was short on time and cooked these on a skillet instead of baking them. They were delicious, served with veggie sausages and maple syrup. The recipe definitely produces much too much custard for 12 inches of baguette to absorb, but I just threw it into the pan with the french toast. If you're concerned about it, you can just throw it in a ramekin and bake it along side the french toast for a nice little snack.

Did not work for me. Too much liquid for 12 inches of baguette to absorb. The remaining unabsorbed custard separated. Looked awful but tasted OK.

Isn't that just Bread and Butter Pudding using coffee instead of currants?
