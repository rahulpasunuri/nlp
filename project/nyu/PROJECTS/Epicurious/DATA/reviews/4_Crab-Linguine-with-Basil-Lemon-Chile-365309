Followed this nearly exactly but I did up the crab to 12 oz and heated the crab in the oil/lemon juice a minute before adding in the pasta. Delicious, delicious, delicious!

This is a delicious recipe! I used more basil (and thought that I would even more next time after having the dish), added Garlic, added some of the starch water from draining the pasta, used 12oz. of lump crab meat and replaced the red chilies with crushed red pepper flakes. I cooked the red pepper, lemon zest and garlic in a little olive oil for 2 minutes before adding the pasta and crab meat to the mix and I ladled in some starch water as I felt it needed to avoid the dish from being dry. This version received rave reviews from our dinner party!

Four stars for the great flavor with minimum of ingredients and effort. I used about 10 oz fresh crab meat, large red jalapeno pepper, fresh cilantro instead of basil plus chopped gr onions and small garlic clove minced. Used less pasta as it was only for two. This is definitely a recipe to keep and make again for family or for company.

Made this with fresh whole wheat Pappardelle, 1 1/2 Serrano peppers and meyer lemons. It was delicious!

This was excellent & surprisingly easy! It's simple to play with ingredients & make a lovely meal. Even the kids liked it but they couldn't admit it!

Absolutely delicious! I used two red jalapenos (would've used more, but they were a bit hot) and a pound of fresh Dungeness crab meat to one pound of fresh pasta. I'll definitely make this again.

Excellent for its simplicity. make sure you use more crab and other ingredients for the amount of pasta than the recipe calls for otherwise it will taste bland. I used about 8 oz crab for pasta for 2 people. and I could have used even more.

In response to zannie111, I did not actually rinse the pasta with boiling water although I do think that is exactly what the author intended. Was fine without that step.

This is wonderful -- simple, bright and delicious. The flavors really come together. I saute the crab briefly in the lemon oil before returning the pasta to the pan. It is sort of addictive. I've made it 3 times this past month and will definitely make it again (and again).

Rinse pasta with boiling water? Really? That seems like it must be a mis-print, doesn't it? I can't imagine having another pot of boiling water on just to rinse the cooked pasta, but I also would not suggest rinsing it in cold water either, since you're serving it immediately. Can anyone clarify the author's intentions here?
