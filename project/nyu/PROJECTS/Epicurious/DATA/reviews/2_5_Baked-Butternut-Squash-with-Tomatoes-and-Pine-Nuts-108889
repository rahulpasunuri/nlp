A versatile, tasty dish that I have made time after time.

Theingredients were fine, but the method was too time consuming for the result. I do a similar, simpler and tastier recipe where I just chop up the squash, add tomatoes, onion, oil and seasoning (I prefer cumin and cinammon) put the whole thing in a crockpot until soft (6-8 hours on low) When serving, top with the feta and pine nuts. Easy, inexpensive, delicious and nutritious.

I tried this dish because it looked like an interesting way to prepare squash. The tomato/onion mixture was good, but it just didn't seem to go with the squash. Would have been better over rice or couscous. Also, I found the oregano overwhelming. Very disappointing, especially given the work involved.
