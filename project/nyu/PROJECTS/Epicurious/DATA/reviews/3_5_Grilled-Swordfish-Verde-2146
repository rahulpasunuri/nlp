Fish was delicious. I made the avocado mayonnaise without adding mayonnaise and while it was good, not sure it really added much to the fish.

Used this marinade on redfish, leaving out the brown sugar. I had twice as much fish as my family usually eats, but there were no leftovers. Forgot to seed the jalapenos, so it was pretty spicy.

We recommend doing as written before improvising (if possible). Although we agree the marinated fish is great on its own (do not add anything) reviewers should not say the avocado side "is not necessary" if they didn't try it. We thought it was a great complement to the dish and when we make again, will not skip it. there IS enough for leftovers for sandwiches, as recommended.

I hesitate to say that I will make this again because I will likely change things around a bit. Would definitely not do the avocado mayonnaise side. Would much prefer a fruit salsa as an accompaniment. The swordfish is very rich and therefore does NOT benefit from a rich accompaniment, like the avocado mayo (which would be better used on a smoked turkey sandiwich with bacon and tomatoes). I DID enjoy the marinade, although I found an hour at room temperature to be more than enough time to marinate. I was concerned to read someone suggesting marinating overnight. Yikes! There's too much acid in the marinade and if you marinated the swordfish overnight, it would probably cook the fish right through. And with the price of swordfish, that w/b a tragedy. I did LOVE LOVE LOVE the hickory smoke on the fish and will definitely do that again! All in all, I think my plan next time will be to make a separate salsa verde, grill the swordfish (not marinated) with the hickory. Serve with a little of the salsa on top and a black bean salad and grilled tortillas on the side. Hey...cooking is all about "work in progress", isn't it!

We really enjoyed this dish. Even my nonfisheating 11 year old son wolfed down his fish. We served it with green poblano rice (from this website), and a salad with a mexican inspired salad dressing. Definite make again.

Great recipe and very easy. I added an extra splash of lime juice and made the Light Guacamole on this website (using yogurt) to go along with it. Awesome.

The fish was very moist, although not as flavorful as I expected. This recipe would make good fish tacos, using large pieces of the swordfish with the requisite cabbage, guacomole, and sauce made with mayo, lime juice, yogurt and mexican seasonings.

This recipe was AWESOME! I didn't change a thing and everyone loved it! I served it with rice, spicy black beans, homemade pico de gallo, and Pacifico. Thank you for the incredible recipe! I will definitely make it again.

This is very good. I marinated the swordfish for about 1-1/2 hours at room temperature and grilled on the barbecue. The Avocado-mayonnaise is a must with this recipe -- it's delicious. The mayonnaise is not only good with the swordfish, but would be great on turkey sandwiches as well!

This was terrific. I used sea bass, marinated about 2 hours and add some tequila to the marinade. I, too, skipped the avocada mayonnaise based on the other comments. However, I simply sauteed a sliced banana in some butter and light brown sugar and used as a garnish. The sweetness was a wonderful contrast to the fish. Plated fish atop a mound of rice and black beans. Wonderful. RH

I've been looking for a really good grilled swordfish recipe, since it's the only kind of fish my husband will eat. We prepared it last weekend for my parents (who eat ONLY fish) and it was fantastic - we all loved it! I didn't make the avocado mayonnaise, but the recipe doesn't really need it.

This is a quick and easy recipe that packs a flavorful punch. I too thined the marinade w/ tequila and let the swordfish marinate for a couple of hours. I cooked it on a grill w/out the smoked chips and it was great. The next time I make this, I will definately let the swordfish marinate overnight as 2 hrs. was just barely enough to appreciate the full flavor of the verde sauce. I also thought the avacodo mayonnaise was a good match with this dish, although I used equal portions of mayo and avacado.

very fresh tasting! I am watching the fat so cut the oil to 1 tbs. and added a couple of tb. of tequilla to thin out the marinade. A very bright and tasty marinade/sauce.

This is an excellent marinade and recipe. I did not make the avacado mayo. I served it with papaya salsa and it was fantastic!!

This was a great summertime meal (I made the carribean black beans and rice side dish as well)! I didn't have any fresh cilantro on hand so I used dried. I also didn't have the hickory chips. It turned out really subtle and wonderful though - a beautiful meal!

I made this recipe and loved it, as did the other couple we invited to dinner. I agree with most others, that the avocado mayo is good, but unnecessary, as the marinade gives the fish a good sauce on its own ( I think I'll take the hint above and add wine to the marinade, as it is kind of thick.) I also had the caribbean black bean and rice salad along with it and a seared pineapple/red pepper salsa (not from the Bon Appetit). For dessert I made tres leches and I thought it all went together well. Of course we also had crusty bread and wine with the meal. This weekend I am making bruschetta to go with this line-up as well. This makes the 3rd time I've made this. Enjoy!

I have to admit that I took great liberties with this recipe. The swordfish didn't look all that great at the market so I purchased (gasp!)Chilean Sea Bass and used the marinade and skipped the avocado mayo. I upped the jalepeno requirement (I love my food spicy!) as well as the lime juice and brown sugar to offset the heat just a tad for others. I don't normally grill my Chilean Sea Bass as it's a more tender fish, however, I used a fish basket to contain it and placed it directly over the hickory chips in an aluminum pan so that it didn't get any direct fire. It required a little more cooking time this way, but came out tender and delicious and didn't lose much of the marinade. It was fantastic!

Excellent marinade - though I needed more salt. The color is fantastic. I will use this as a base and perhaps add some chopped pistacios for a nutty dimension next time as suggested by my guest. Agree with others - the avo-mayo is completely unnecessary - not worth the cost, the fattiness, and the hassle. Skip it!

I loved the avocado mayonnaise. Unfortunately, it obliterated the wonderful flavor of the fish. I will make both of them again and again, just not together.

This is a great marinade! It made the swordfish moist and tender, and the blend of flavors was simply delicious! The only modification I made was to add a splash of white wine--I had cut the recipe down to one third of the quantity, as I was only cooking it for two people, and the marinade seemed to need a bit more liquid, so I added a tiny bit more lime juice and olive oil, plus a bit of wine. I was really happy with the results--it was easy to make, and very tasty, too! I did not make the avocado mayonnaise, as I was pressed for time, but I might consider giving it a try in the future.

I loved the swordfish! I did not like the avocado mayonnaise and the dish really didn't need it. I liked the idea of the avocado, but somehow, it tasted too acidic and clashed with the fish. Did anyone else try a modification?

This is an absolutely delightful recipe. I've made it several times and it is always a hit. Pairs wonderfully with a jicama slaw.

The only reason that I couldn't rate this a 4 is because I'm still trying to learn to love swordfish. The marinade is fabulous and I will use it again with a fish that I really enjoy. I think that it would be excellent on chilean sea bass. The accompanying recipe for the avocado mayonaise is nice, but not necessary since the marinade is so flavorful on it's own. The recipe can probably also be broiled, with good results. I prepared the Caribbean-style black bean and rice that is featured as part of the full menu and it was very enjoyable also.

This is one of my favorite marinades. It is delicious with chicken or fish. I normally have to omit the jalapeno since my husband can't take the heat, but the marinade is still very flavorful even without it. Excellent dish!
