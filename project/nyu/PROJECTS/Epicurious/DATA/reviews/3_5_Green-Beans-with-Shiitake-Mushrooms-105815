We really enjoyed this easy side dish. In future I'd try cutting down on the butter but it was a nice a beautiful change to steamed green beans. Will definitely make this again.

I served this with london broil. It was a huge hit. This was my second time making it. This time I substituted one pound of the green beans for one pound of kale, added a little more broth so it could cook longer, and it was fabulous!

These were a perfect accompaniment to a roast tenderloin with wine sauce. You can do part of this recipe ahead of time and then finish it at the last minute. I sauteed the shitake mushrooms a couple of hours in advance and set them aside. I also prepared the shallots, etc, ahead, then put the chicken stock and green beans in the pot and left them there --ready to go-- until my tenderloin was ready. While the tenderloin was resting, I turned on the stove and finished the dish. Easy. It was very well received at my dinner party -- but be sure to season it to taste.

The recipe is not very bold, but is nevertheless quite tasty as a mild accompaniment to roast chicken or another well-flavored protein.I had no shallots on hand so substituted with 1/2 yellow onion, which worked nicely.I would recommend slicing the garlic as opposed to mincing it as it imparts a subtler note to the dish.

I made this per the recipe except cut down on the number of servings although the amount of mushrooms in relation to green beans may have been higher. We thought this was excellent. The shitaki's added a a lot of flavor.

This dish is way too bland, so I added the rosemary and garlic sauce that came with my sliced shiitakes and it gave it more flavor.I would suggest at least adding some herbs.

My husband and I did not like this recipe. Very disappointing. We prefer steamed green beans wih a little garlic and olive oil.

Delicious! Used re-hydrated Chinese dried mushrooms and less than half the butter & olive oil. Substituted red onion for shallots.

This dish was full of flavor and definately a crowd pleaser. I added some (imitation) bacon bits which gave it an even more appetizing aroma. I will definately make this again.

An elegant side dish. I prepared the dish as written, except that I added sliced shallots, not chopped. I prefer the appearance of sliced onions as opposed to little bits.

I really like these green beans, but it is very important to use really good green beans (i use hericot verts or even baby green) definately add salt and pepper to taste. I love this recipe!

This dish make you want to eat your vegetables. I thought it was very tasty but I did add a little extra salt. Also, I would recommend using the shitake mushrooms as instructed. White mushrooms didn't give the same texture or flavor.

This one is definitely a keeper. I've made it twice. Once for Thanksgiving and once for my bookclub potluck. Both times, it was a hit: no leftovers! It's easy and delicious. Not sure why others have derided this dish as "bland". Perhaps a little salt and pepper would have helped them?

Prepared this side dish with the traditional Christmas turkey and no one touched this. Bland. Tried it cold the next day and ended up just tossing it out.

I made this during the holidays with beef tenderloins and roasted rosemary potatos. The bean dish was ok, but nothing special. The shiitaks are delicious but for the rest it's too bland. Maybe something simple like a sprinkle of parmesan would perk it up...

A disappointing dish that didn't have much flavor. I much prefer green beans steamed with slivers of raw onion added just before serving.

Not a big green bean fan, but my husband is, so I try to make them every week or so. Because of this, I'm always looking for interesting and different ways to make them. This was fine, but not particularly interesting. I loved the shiitakes though.

Excellent. The green beans were crisp and flavorful but not overcooked. I didn't change a thing about the recipe and they were devoured at our elegant dinner party. I paired them with filet mignon and mashed sweet potatoes.

Everyone loved this dish. I served it with Beef tenderloin and it was wonderful. The added bonus is how easy and fast it is to make when you are frantically trying to prepare a fantastic dinner that has all the trimmings.

I am not a big butter fan, so I substituted butter with olive oil. It was absolutely delicious!

Rating: 4
This has without a doubt become one of two favorite ways to prepare green beans. (The other is tossed with pesto, often together with boiled potatoes.) Many previous reviewers have recommended substituting at least part of the butter with olive oil; haven't tried that. The special flavor of shiitakes must make this dish! Absolutely a keeper!

Tried this as a side dish to go with Prime Rib for Christmas dinner. Wonderful, everybody loved it. I substituted Portabello mushrooms also. This is a "keeper" for this green bean and mushroom lover. Thanks a million.

I'd been looking for a good green bean recipe for a while, and this was great! Easy, delicious... next time I'll try it with nutmeg as someone else suggested.

Amazing that somethiong so simple could be so good. I changed the proportions slightly, for two servings using five ounces haricots verts, 3 ounces shiitakes, 1 shallot, skipped garlic, 1 teaspoon butter and 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil total, and the whole 2/3 cup low salt chicken broth. Because the haricots verts take so much less time to cook, I kept my medium skilllet uncovered and they were tender with the broth mostly gone in 4-5 minutes. Super good!

This was just ok-we love fresh vegetables and it was a little too garlicky-lost the nature flavor of the beans

I have been making this for a long time and add fresh ground nutmeg at the very end. This simple compliment is fabulous to an already fabulous dish. Served with roasted pork tenderloins and rosemary new potatoes...is always a hit.

I made this for a barbecue I hosted. Everyone raved about it. It was simple to prepare and had great flavor. I did however, substitute with Portabella mushrooms!

The chicken stock reduces into a nice sauce with the butter and shallots. I could make a meal out of this alone.

Great recipe for green beans. I sprinkled feta cheese on top just before I served it. Everyone loved it.

These were good but I didn't see how they could be unbeleivably great- it was the simple taste of buttery mushrooms with good green beans that made this a good dish I guess.

This is the best way to prepare green beans. I have made it several times and friends keep asking me to bring these to dinner parties! It definitely can be made with half the butter and they still taste delicious. I highly recommend this dish.

Excellent way to prepare green beans. Never really liked greenbeans until I prepared them this way. Even the kids loved them!

I used olive oil instead of butter and found that it tasted fine. The shiitake mushrooms at the market didn't look too great, so I substituted crimini mushrooms. It was a simple and tasty way to prepare green beans. Even my non-veggie eating husband ate them.

So delicious!! I've already made this 3 times this one week. I used canola oil instead of butter the second time and was just as good.

This is a delicious and satisfying recipe which is also easy to make. I would suggest using about half the butter though - it's a bit of a cholesterol explosion, as written. (Probably one reason it's so tasty.) Fresh shitake with butter are particularly rich and creamy tasting.

I thought this was a great green bean recipe. I used olive oil instead of butter and Italian brown mushrooms instead of shitake. I did need to simmer the green beans more than 10 minutes... more like 15 until they were tender. Will definitely make this again.

I made this on Thanksgiving, and it was a hit! I didn't expect everyone to keep raving about the veggies on a night when there are so many delicious dishes, but I was wrong! I added some slivered almonds for texture, and it worked wonderfully. Make this dish!

Amazing. I don't care for green beans, but loved this. It was easy to make too. I'm not a chef by any means. I used this magazine to walk me through cooking our first Thanksgiving dinner and I'm glad I did. Side note: If you don't know much about mushrooms, be careful. At least in our area, there aren't a lot of fresh shiitake mushrooms around. Keep in mind that the mushrooms shouldn't SMELL.

A very easy and delicious side dish. I look forward to making it again.

Delicious and very easy to get everything ready in advance and cook at last minute. The slender green beans (or haricot vert) are key. You can use the kentucky green beans but the slender beans are better with the shitakes.

The key to this recipe's intense flavor is the chicken broth. I have never found such a great way to cook string beans. Everyone raved about them at the Thanksgiving table. They just may be a new tradition to the holiday menu from now on.
