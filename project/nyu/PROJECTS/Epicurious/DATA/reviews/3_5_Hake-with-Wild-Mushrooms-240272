My only comment is that you have to know your stove; I tried the butter on the medium-high heat setting, and it was way too hot, and immediately blackened the garlic. I just started over, working at medium heat, and I also did not wait until the foam from the butter died down before adding the garlic, chased by the mushrooms. I sautéed them for 4 minutes on the timer, added the chicken broth and a little lemon peel from a microplaner. Sautéed again, this time for 3 minutes, while preparing and plating the rest of the simple meal. Broiled the fish exactly as directed for 8 minutes - no foil packets, no changes. The mushrooms are unbelievable, and the meal really satisfied. I served it with a simple side of buttered corn, and paired it with a cab since we didn't have any pinot noir. P.S. I skipped the parsley since we didn't have any, and we didn't miss it.

Made this for a small dinner party. We prepared the fish in foil packets with sliced lemon, onion, and whole sprigs of parsely, and put them on the grill after our guests arrived. Before folks showed up, I prepared the mushrooms through adding the broth and added a little extra. Kept them warm in the oven and finished the sauce when the fish came off the grill. Served with an apple, walnut, and blue cheese salad. Super easy and delicious.

Cooked this today; the hake was just fine, broiled perfectly. It was less expensive than most other fish (at Whole Foods). The sauce overwhelmed it somewhat; next time, less lemon, fewer mushrooms. Served with teeny potatoes and fresh asparagus tips.

Made this tonight & it came out beautifully. Cut down on the butter, left out the parsley, and used small portobellos. Will try it with a mix of wild mushrooms next time. Turned over the fillets halfway through and they stayed intact (I use Reynolds Release non-stick aluminum foil on the broiler).

This is a really delicious fish recipe. I am a single working woman, so I made a few adjustments to cut costs. First off, I just cooked for one, I bought a pound of hake for 8 dollars, and it's enough for one and a half meals (leftovers for lunch tomorrow). Second off, I didn't use chicken broth, and subbed white wine which I had already bought for dinner. Since I am cooking for one, I used less butter and olive oil than called for, but stuck to one whole clove of garlic. I didn't use parsely, because I think it's an easy cost to cut from the grocery store. I used extra lemon juice and lemon zest, and I think that's a key in this recipe. I love fish and am cooking it more often, and this is a great way to cook fish (not an expensive one to boot!), and the end result is tasty with a great restaurant-fish quality consistency.

I used hake & cremini mushrooms, & substituted white wine for the chicken broth. It was 'rustic', & not bad. I liked tossing the fish with the oil, zest, etc. and would do that again, but pairing with the 'shrooms didn't excite me.

i made this with Alaskan Cod. i didn't use broth or parsley, just mushrooms, butter, sage and lemon juice. i only used baby bella mushrooms. it was really easy and the flavor of the fish was divine.

great fall fish recipe, quick, easy and came out well. I used a mix of cremini and baby portobellos and served with new potatoes/parsley along with haricots verts. It is something to play around with and was thinking about somehow incorporating proscuitto with it--either with the mushrooms somehow or wrapped around the fish at the end. Will definitely go on regular weeknight dinner rotation.

This was elegant, easy and quick. Used grouper which worked fine. Bought box of mixed wild mushrooms which made it look a bit more interesting. Served with crushed, boiled new potatoes with olive oil and fresh mint and mixed steam veg. Very attractive.
