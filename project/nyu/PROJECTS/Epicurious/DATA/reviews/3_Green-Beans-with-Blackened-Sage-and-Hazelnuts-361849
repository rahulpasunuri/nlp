Love this! It was quick, easy and delicious.

This was fine but not too special--I agree with the person who would add more sage and at the end, as it didn't really come thru.

Dear Editor, There is no such word as 'infectionfighting'. Try putting in a hyphen. Sincerely, English teacher

This is how we like brussel sprouts...except with almonds instead of hazelnuts. A sprinkle of bacon is pretty good too. I don't think adding the word infection is good for any recipe/description. Ever.

This recipe was good, but fairly boring. The sage flavor did not come through very much, would add it at the end next next for brighter flavor.
