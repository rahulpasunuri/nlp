Have been making this since it came out in magazine..always good..good on all meats. For pork I add some hot chili flakes or chili paste for extra kick..just used on wild boar that I shot, brined shoulder for 2 days, then slow cooked with a rub (steven raichlan memphis rub)..then shredded and topped w/sauce..can add a slaw on top for sandwiches. I use shallots if I have them, if not tsp of red onion or can do without. Really need to carmelize the sugar to get full impact and depth of this sauce!

The sauce on its own is not remarkable. I almost was going to discard it. The true magic happens when a smoky dry rubbed rib is dipped in and flavors meet. I found myself inhaling ribs one after another. So my experience is limited to smoked ribs and would recommend without reservation.

Wow! Great bbq sauce! I would highly recommend caramelizing the sugar. As long as you keep an eye on it and make sure it doesn't burn, it's easy. However because the sugar gets so hot and steams up I would also recommend using a deeper pan than you normally might. I will definitely make this again and might even make an extra big batch so I can freeze some.

This is delicious! I used it as a marinade for chicken thighs. My kids (and I) ate it up! I admit, I took the easy route and just mixed the ingredients together - didn't caramelize the sugar first. And I don't like fish sauce, so I skipped it. Otherwise, it was great!

Made the recipe as directed and it was nothing short of amazing! Easy to make and a definite wow. Served it as one of two sauces with a brisket.

I didn't have several of the ingredients, so I don't want to put forks on this. Missing the fish sauce and five spice. Subbed onion for shallot and put in some cinnamon for five spice. Would like to try this again when I have all the true ingredients, but even with my trimmed down version I thought it went very well with the chicken I had smoked.

I found the result to have a bitter note. I either burned the caramel, or burned the garlic. Two suggestions to avoid my mistake.....one, once caramel is LIGHT golden (not deep), then add the hoisin mixture. Second, add the garlic after the mixture has cooled down enough to make sure it doesn't burn. I thought the mixture would benefit from adding lime juice (to taste) at the end to cut/balance out the sweetness a bit.

This one goes in the keeper file. It was very easy and full of flavor. I tried it first on a pork loin. Fantastic I must say. I had doubled the batch so a couple of days later I made meatballs. Definitely a versatile sauce and one I will make often. I would call this one a classic.

Am in the process of making a double batch of this seeing all the reviews sounded so good. Having all the neighbours over and decided to bbq with 2 lg pork loins. I am looking for some input from anyone out there with more bbq'ing experience than me! Should I bbq the pork loins whole or slice into thick slices? Do I put this sauce on as soon as I start bbq'ing or should I just drizzle over the cooked meat? This may sound silly, but I don't want to wreck the meal. Will edit my "fork" rating after dinner tomorrow.Thanks to anyone who responds.

This was AWESOME!! The difference to getting that gooey, sticky, rich flavor is the carmelization of the sugar. Makes all the difference. Wow! Used it with a pork shoulder.

This was relatively easy to make. I did substitute a couple items I didn't have and it was still delicious. I will definitely use this recipe again. I used it on a pork roast in the oven and it was great. I can't wait to try it on other meats and on the grill.

Absolutely fabulous. I decided to surprise my husband this BBQ sauce on thick-cut porkchops and I thought he was going to lick the plate clean. Wonderful!!!

The herbals are a must in this recipe. Very dark, very rich, very very sugary. It's especially tasty with pork and has a teriyaki-like consistency. I would never put it on fish as it would be overkill, in my opinion.

This is a great sauce, goes well with BBQ pork chops too. I also agree Lee Kum Kee Hoisin Sauce is the way to go (not related to the company in any shape or form). I sometimes add sweet Thai Chillie Sauce to it

Perfect! I used to make another hoisin barbecue style sauce, but I have to say this one beats it.

This is my "go-to" recipe when I need a quick, impressive sauce for salmon or chicken skewers. Everyone thinks it tastes fabulous, but I don't ever tell them how easy it is... let them think I'm a wonderful cook!

Outstanding!!! I make double batches and it keeps nicely for a week at least. It is usually gone before the week is up. I have used it with fish, chicken, lamb chops and pork medallions.

Fantastic! I took everyone's advice and served this with grilled salmon, and the plates were all but licked clean!

I felt like a real chef making this, especially when I added the hoisin mixture and watched it sizzle. I've used this on both BBQ chickend and salmon and it came out very nicely. Impressive on the grill for a party or anytime really.

Scrumptious!!!! This is one of the best and most versatile sauces out there....I have made it several times and tried it on a variety of meats....Always a hit!!!!

Delicious and very easy to whip up. I almost made the mistake of adding more than the recommended amount of five spice. I thought 1/8 of a teaspoon would be too scant to make a difference; luckilly, I gave the recipe a chance as written, because it was perfect. Any more would have overpowered. Served this on grilled salmon fillets, but waited to brush the fish with it at the last minute to avoid burning.

The best Asian BBQ sauce ever. I make the sauce in large batches, and I keep it in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. I serve it with roasted chicken, and with broiled salmon. Very tasty!
