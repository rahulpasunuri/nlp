The arepas came out crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. I could not find masarepa in my neighborhood and substituted masa harina. I let the corn meal soak in the hot broth for a few mintues before mixing the dough. The key is to wait for the dough to feel cool to the touch. Otherwise, the dough will stick to your hands when you try to shape them.

I couldn't find the masarepa but figured masa harina used to make tortillas should work. And indeed it worked! Flattening the dough into a roughly shaped tortilla that you fold in half over the filling made a thin, crunchy yet soft in the middle snack that was comfortingly REALLY good! I am looking forward to reheating the (very few) leftovers for breakfast and already thinking about the roasted pasilla peppers or crunchy jalapenos I could add to the stuffing next time...
