I didn't think I liked mashed potatoes before I made these! They're required for our Thanksgiving table, and always a big hit.

This recipe is a huge family favorite, and I make it every Christmas to serve with roast beef. They're not the kind of mashed potatoes that you'd serve with turkey and gravy, but are exceptional as a side dish with a roast. It wouldn't be Christmas without these! BTW, I omit the parsley root since it's not always available here and the taste is still fabulous.

I have made these mashed potatoes every time I have hosted Thanksgiving dinner. The texture is a little different than regular mashed potatoes because of the parsnips.

The flavor, while good, was not entirely what I expected. I would cut back on the parsnips next time; perhaps even never using them but then that wouldn't be this recipe, would it? My whipped potato purist husband liked them which surprsied me.I guess the just didn't fit the taste I was looking for. Also, I added white pepper since the parsnips were way too sweet.

These were the most delicious mashed potatoes we ever had. I used all the ingredients called for even the parsley root. They will be added to my holiday and regular recipe files.

Great dish for a cold day. Made this for Thanksgiving several years ago for a large gathering of family and friends, including a woman from Scotland who actually ate out of the bowl for seconds, thirds, etc. She said this dish reminded her one her mother made years ago. Lost the recipe, finally found it again. Will make it at my daughter's in Los Angeles this thanksgiving for old and new family and friends.

I've been making these for Thanksgiving dinner for a few years now - I think the little bit of garlic and the parsnips make ordinary mashed potatoes a little special - everyone always likes them when I make them.

Such an easy but delicious side dish, and a refreshing change from regular mashed potatoes. You can substitute low-fat milk for the whipping cream and it's still terrific. Why buy dehydrated potatoes in a box when you can savour this instead?
