I made this recipe as is except I added some sliced button mushrooms. I don't think that altered the taste much but made it a little more filling. Either way, this dish is delicious and extremely easy!

I followed the original recipe pretty closely, and that was a mistake. It was so BLAND. I can understand why so many reviewers doctored it because, as written, this recipe is a dud.

I also needed to get rid of some ham and clean out the larder. You can add anything in the fridge or cupboard and it will work. Super EASY! Took it to a potluck I was dreading and the serving dish was scraped clean. Good weeknight meal.

We loved this dish. So easy to make and delicious. My boyfriend is asking me to cook it again. I tried with pork sausage. Next time, I'd like to try with mushrooms and chicken like you guys did. On the other hand, I think we like the spicy sausage taste better. So, I'll try with turkey sausage next time.

This seems like a great basic recipe that can be dressed up or down with ease. I made it with slightly less herbed goat cheese than the recipe calls for, tossed in some grated parmesan, added thawed frozen petite peas, sauteed garlic, leeks and shallots because I had some I needed to use up. Also, cooked the pasta in a chicken broth/water combo. Very tasty, and easy even with the add-ins. Its good reheated for lunch.

YUCK. It wasn't the worst thing I've ever made, but no thanks. Really surprised after all of the great reviews. I added peas, carmelized onions, parmesan, etc. and still. Yuck. And now we have a ton leftover that we have to eat because we don't like to waste food... And we could have enjoyed that fresh goat cheese from the farmers' market in so many other ways! Definitely will not make it again.

I made this recipe again, only this time I added some lobster meat I had and I must say it was the best thing I could've done. The flavors of this dish go perfectly well with lobster and brings out the flavor beautifully. It has become a favorite of mine!

Loved this recipe! I needed to use leftover ham and this fit the bill.I always read the reviews before I use a recipe and for this one, I used several suggestions from other reviews (used less goat cheese; added in parmesan cheese; added sauteed sweet onion and minced garlic - ditched the scallions; added sweet frozen peas; used more ham and less orzo; cooked the orzo in part chicken broth and reserved one full cup of liquid). hmmm, is it still the same recipe??? Anyway served it with a green salad and my family gobbled it down(even my Meat & Potaotes Hubby)!

Anyone think this would freeze well before broiling? I've got a lot of leftover ham and am looking for ways to stock my freezer for busy work nights.

Really delish with a few modifications and so easy on the budget. Had left over ham and saw this recipe. Sauted a 1/2 c. sweet onions, added 2 minced garlic cloves and sauteed for another 30 seconds. Added the chopped ham and 1 c. frozen thawed peas. Added the cooked orzo to the saute pan, added 1/2 c. parmesean cheese, 4 oz goat cheese, the reserved water, 1/2 tsp black pepper, mixed well and put into the 9 x 9 baking dish (oiled) and broiled until golden brown. I will make this dish for both week nights and those other "fun" casual nights with friends or neighbors. So good and comforting!!! YUMMO!(if sodium is a concern, use low sodium ham) I did not add salt as the ham and parm. cheese are salty enough.

SO easy and SO good! Like others recommended, I added sundried tomatoes, pinenuts, and garlic, substituted goat cheese for herbed goat cheese, and cooked the orzo in half chicken broth, half water. Thinking about it now makes my mouth water!!

We served this dish as part of our wedding reception menu, and it was a HUGE hit. Very simple, but very delicious.

Only 4 ingredients, but this is a great dish. I used herbed goat cheese for a little extra flavor. Quick, easy, simple and soooo good.

I added a chicken buillon to the pasta water, used a mixture of turkey and honey ham which I sauteed with some onion and garlic and added the frozen peas along with some basil, oregano, parsley, and dill. I also used a little more than a cup of the liquid so it wouldn't dry out. The result came out pretty good, my family loved it. I'll probably add some artichokes or tomato next time. My father suggested preparing it with shrimp.

I have made this simple recipe many times. A few changes I recommend...cook the orzo in chicken broth (or half chicken broth and half water). Also toss in some sun dried tomato to perk up the flavor!

Added frz peas to the last few minutes of boiling the pasta. After draining dumped the hot pasta and peas over the ham, scallions and HERBED goat cheese. After stirring sprinkle with toasted pine nuts. No baking needed. Delicious

A bit boring, I think I'd rather spend the $ for the goat cheese for a different recipe. Extremely easy. Nicer as a side dish or would make a great potluck dish.

this dish was very good. My whole family liked it alot. I followed the advice of others and added crushed garlic, salt and chicken stock to the water. I also added peas to the dish and used herbed goat cheese. It was super easy and I will make again.

I decided to toast the orzo to see if it could add a little flavor, and it did! I sauteed garlic and sliced shallot in olive oil, then added a cup of orzo (I halved the recipe) and cooked that for about five minutes. Then I dumped the lot of it into some boiling water flavored with chicken boullion. I added a bit of creme fraiche along with the goat cheese, ham, parmesan, dried basil and oregano. Totally yummy. I meant to add mushrooms but forgot. Next time!

Wonderful recipe. As others suggested, I boiled the orzo in chicken broth with chopped garlic and scallions. Then added a can of artichoke hearts, about half a cup of parmesan, and a handful of pine nuts for a one course meal. Delicious! My fiance LOVED it, and I will definitely make it again. I only used 5 oz. of goat cheese, and it was very cheesy.

I think that this recipe is a bit unexciting and a little dry, but it is so quick and easy that I can't help but say I'd make it again. It only takes about 15 minutes start to finish, so it is perfect for a busy mid-week evening when you want a homecooked meal but don't have time to make one. Whip up a side salad and you're finished.

I really liked this recipe. I used an herbed goat cheese that I found at the grocery store, then added peas and some grilled sweet onions. It was fabulous! My fiancee really liked it as well- we couldn't stop eating! Other reviewers are correct in that it does dry out a bit when re-heating. I would suggest either cutting the recipe down so you don't have leftovers, or prepare to eat a lot! Or, maybe just add a little extra liquid. I think next time I may try it with a bread crumb topping and for sure still used the herbed goat cheese. It gave it so much flavor.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and cooked the orzo in water w/chicken boullion cubes, chopped garlic and a chopped shallot. Skipped the scallions because mine had gone bad, and added artichoke hearts, pine nuts and parmesan. The result was wonderful. My fiance raved about it, and I will definitely make this again.

I followed the other reviewers' advice and added roasted asparagus to the mix. It turned out delicious! I didn't have enough goat cheese, will add more next time. Quick and easy.

I liked this recipe a lot, but I did make a number of alterations- I boiled the orzo with some crushed garlic in chicken stock. I added some parmesan when the orzo was mixed with the goat cheese and ham, and I sprinkled on some italian herb mix I had (from Penzey's). It came out very nice and straight-forward, and was very quick and cheap to make.

How can so few ingredients make such a tasty and quick meal? I added a side of roasted asparagus for a complete meal. This is a real keeper.

An easy weeknight meal although the recipe as it stands is a little bland. We added chopped steamed asparagus and tomatoes to make it a one dish meal and that seemed to do the trick. The following night we added some leftover chicken and chopped bacon and it tasted even better. One final note: be careful when reheating this as it can get dry.

Comfort food kicked up! When I was shopping I thought it called for Gorgonzola not Goat cheese so that is what I picked up. Took many other suggestions and sauteed onion, celery and mushrooms in olive oil and deglazed with a bit of white wine and added some basil, thyme, savory and black pepper. What a creamy and flavorful dish. Actually halved the recipe as the full amount would have been too much but still had 3 ample servings.

Comfort food kicked up would be a good description for this dish. When I was shopping I thought it called for Gorgonzola not goat so that is what I picked up. Took many of the other suggestions and sauteed onion, celery and mushrooms in a bit of olive oil and white wine with some basil, thyme and fennel. Actually cut the recipe in half as a full batch would have been way too much but still had 3 ample servings. What a nice creamy texture and so flavorful.

Has anyone tried making this dish with chicken--such as leftover grilled chicken?

Fast and quite good, although I did change it a bit. I made the orzo using chicken broth instead of water to add a little flavor. Also instead of using the scallions, I sauteed onion and mushrooms in olive oil and added this to the dish. Nice.

Really good and so easy. To La Jolla - pasta freezes well - both in casseroles (like lasagna) and by itself. When we have leftover pasta, I spray it with a little olive oil and pack it in plastic bags.

Easy basic and delicious! We like it with chopped green onions and tomatoes, also....and for La Jolla, NO, pasta does not freeze well at all. This is so easy though, you don't need to freeze it.
