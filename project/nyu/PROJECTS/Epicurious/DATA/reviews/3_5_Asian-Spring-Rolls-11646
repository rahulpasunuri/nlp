To Faun and Pudgemo, you are not supposed to be using rice paper wrappers for this recipe. Rice paper is for summer rolls, not spring rolls. Use spring roll wrappers and your problems will be solved.

I made these for a small get together with my family and they loved them. I made a couple of small changes to suit my familys taste but the basic recipe rocked. I couldnt find fresh beans sprouts so I used a 14oz can of La Choy bean sprouts packed in water. I rinsed them in very cold water to freshen them up and they worked just fine. I also substituted 2 7 oz cans of Chicken of the Sea small shrimp. I rinsed these very thoroughly several times in very cold water to remove the canning juices and minced them. Lastly, I didnt cut the wrappers in half. I made 20 larger ones and I served them with a sweet and sour sauce I picked up in the International section of the market. These were really great and it was a lot of fun to make, since it was my first attempt at egg rolls. I am going to make them again and will experiment with other proteins such as Tuna as well.

I have the same issue. Whenever, including this recipe, I seem to end up with miracle rice paper adhesive! What's the trick?

Terrific idea, but how the HECK do you keep the rice wrappers from sticking? Every time I make them, the wrapper sticks to EVERYTHING-- the spatula, the pan, anything. If I make the oil deeper, they blow up-- like the water in the filling heats rapidly, turning into steam which blows a hole in the wrapper, causing it to blast around the pot like a motorboat. Much amusement for the kids, but not useful as food! Is the oil too cool, too hot....therm sez 350 -375 degrees. help!!

The pork filling was amazing. I made them with egg roll wrappers because that was all I could find and fried them in my mini-deep fryer. Next time I will fry them in a pan so that they fry more evenly. People raved about these and I loved the dipping sauce. It is essentially just soy sauce with a kick but I thought it was definitely worth making. Very easy and delicious.

Great and so easy! I didn't have the mushrooms, shallots or mint, so I left them out. I used one pound of shrimp, finely minced. I added a few red peppr flakes to the dipping sauce. Delicious. Will make again!

To kpnitrl from Seattle, WA: your oil is probably not hot enough if you're having that much trouble frying. If your oil isn't as hot as it should be, it'll just soak into the food like a sponge and will not brown. I thought these were great.

A little less ginger would make this even better!

OK... Maybe it's me. Let me take it from the top. I followed the directions to the tee. Problem: (1) The rolls come out off the oil extremely greasy. They stay greasy even after sitting on paper towels for 30 minutes or longer. (2) They don't turn golden brown even after increasing the cooking time to almost 8 minutes. (3)Did I mention, they are extremely greasy! I've tried the receipe twice, and still the same result. What gives??

best spring rolls I have ever had.

These were awesome. I only did a few things differently. I used ground pork that was flavored with fish sauce that I got from the asian market and I added salad shrimp. I used half of the called for mint and cilantro. I did not use soy sauce, but added fish sauce to taste. My sister, who just adores vietnamese spring rolls, said that these were the best!

I made this recipe for the Christmas holiday and it was terrific! My friends thought I was a real chef. I followed the intructions to a tee, and it came our great. However, I don't have a deep fat frier. I used a wok instead. Highly recommended.

I loved this recipe!! It was simple to make. I added thai basil and omitted the shittaki mushrooms(they smell like urine to me)and substituted straw mushrooms and blanched snow peas. I used tofu I julienned and baked with a marinade of soy sauce and brown sugar, ginger, and rice vinegar and omitted the pork. I also did not fry these rolls. They came out so good, YUM.

I followed the recipe exactly, and these came out sooo good. Incredibly successful dish.

Very good recipe, but altered it to make it healthier. Used lean ground turkey instead of pork, added green beans, and squeezed lime on them instead of using the dipping sauce. Definitely needs the coriander and mint for flavor.

the spring rolls were fabulous; as for the dipping sauce, i'd leave out the soy and substitute instead an equal amount of fish sauce. also, white vinegar can be substituted for the lime juice. a much better vietnamese-style sauce for these rolls!

Excellent! I have made this 3 times. I found using Lumpia Wrappers works the best.

This recipe is was a great success. I did have trouble finding spring roll wrappers and made them with egg roll wrappers. So it was a little thick but delicious! I can't wait to try this with spring roll warppers. YUM!

Fun to make with a friend or family member. (otherwise can be a lot of work for one person!) Shrimp would be a yummy add-in.

Be prepared for at least one+ hour of chopping. They fry up beautifully; be generous with the egg wash to keep the wraps together. I did not like the sauce. I tried a store-bought sweet and sour sauce, but that wasn't great either. Maybe the other cook's suggestion re nam pla is a good one.

I used Egg Roll wrappers, it was great. Very crispy, reheated very well at 350 for 15 min. Sub soy sauce with Nam pla (Viet Hong brand of Fish Sauce) use 2tbsp or more to taste. Add one grated carrot to sauce mixture. Omitted scallion brushes, used small dishes as dipping boats. Rave reviews, all guests wanted recipe.

Better than any restaurant. I servered them with mint, thai basil and cilantro sprigs and then guest wrapped the combo in a bibb lettuce leaf. Great do-ahead!

A Favorite for everyone! The dipping sauce is a must!

N.B. I couldn't find spring roll wrappers without going to China Town, so I substituted phyllo pastry sheets. Use only one sheet and cut into quarters. Tasted a bit flourey but still pretty good. This recipe would be great with additional vegs. and ingreds., I once had them with some type of lettuce, maybe bok choy or even romaine and with crushed peanuts in them. I would also like the sauce to be a bit hotter. But a great recipe with lots of potential variations
