I made this last Thanksgiving and plan to again this year. I'm NOT a pear fan, but this recipe has changed that. I made two, following the recipe exactly and they came out perfect! The cardamom made it! My crust was also perfect, used a food processor and handled it very little. The finished product was gorgeous even in its' simplicity! If there is a better crostata recipe, then please post what it is so I can give it a try!

I have been making Bon Appetit recipes since the 1980s and have rarely been disappointed. However, this recipe was just not BA worthy. The crust was delightful but the combo of pears and figs was an odd flavor match and the pears just aren't sturdy enough to carry a crostata especially when the crust is made with cornmeal. BA has published other absolutely delicious crostatas which I would recommind over this one.

I made this on short notice to take to a dinner party and it was easy and came out very well. The crust was rustic but rich-tasting and the filling had an interesting depth of flavor. The cardamom was an excellent complement to the pears and figs. I could not find very ripe pears, so I used the ripest ones I could find, which happened to be Bartletts rather than Anjous. I sliced them much thinner than the eighths called for in the recipe and mostly they softened up during the baking. The honey could be omitted in my opinion, if you are not a fan of honey. I served the crostata with low fat Greek vanilla yogurt and it was delicious and got rave reviews.

I haven't made this, but I wonder: since, I myself, am not a fan of cornmeal; and, it is - after all- essentially rustic.... what if you replace the said cornmeal with oats? Then, in the filling, use some sorghum. I feel like that might help reduce refined sugar & accent the figs...just a thought.. Again, I have not tried this-(just now read the recipe)- seemed like a good idea

My husband loved this dessert. The crust had a very yummy shortbread quality, the pear flavor was very apparent in the filling and the figs added a richness that was delicious. It was perfect with cream sherry!

I made this recipe exactly as written. The crust tasted good, but was very crumbly (even though I added more water) and much of the juice escaped. The filling was poor. The pears never softened. I cooked it longer in the hopes that they would. Consequently the figs became very dry and hard.

Very easy, especially if you use a pre-made crust, which I did, The flavor was OK but unremarkable. Maybe I just don't like pear desserts...
