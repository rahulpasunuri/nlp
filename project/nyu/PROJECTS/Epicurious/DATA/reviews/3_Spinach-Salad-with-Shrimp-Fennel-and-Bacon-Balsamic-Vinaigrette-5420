I've made this recipe several times and it is delicious. The fennel adds a mild flavor and texture to the salad and perks up the flavor of the shrimp, especially grilled. I too, reduce the amount of bacon fat.

After reading the other reviews, I couldn't let a day go by without correcting all the previous reviews. I am not a fan of fennel in any way, however, this recipe is AMAZING!! We have used this as is, and also as an appetizer preparing massive amounts of shrimp served over the spinach salad. Everytime I have served this recipe, I have received rave reviews!!

0 Forks! A lot of work for bland results. I didn't think the fennel added anything and the dressing was so so. Still a little irritated at the waste of ingredients and effort.

Very good salad. Cut back a little on the bacon fat in dressing and used cherry tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes.
