A delicious twist on a cobb salad, I also substituted real bacon. Another adjustment I made was trading the balsamic vinegar for grapefruit white balsamic vinegar and shallots for vidalia sweet onions. The onion and grapefruit vinegar added a sweetness to the dressing that was exceptional. Very delicious!

Delicious! If you use chicken cutlets rather than whole breasts then you don't need to pound out the breasts and since they cook faster you can just sauté them and skip having to add water and cover. Ok we also used real bacon (about half the amount) which we cooked before the chicken, that way we skipped oil in the pan entirely and went way light on the olive oil in the dressing. It turned out amazing!
