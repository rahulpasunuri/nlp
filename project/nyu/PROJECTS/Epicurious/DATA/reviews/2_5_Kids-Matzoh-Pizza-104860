A decent Passover lunch or light dinner. I would make it again.

Bad! The kids did not eat a single bite.

My kids didn't much like this. I wouldn't bother with it again. I think sauce and cheese on a plain matzoh would be better and far easier.

anyone who has a brain would know that if one is keeping pesach, there are eight days of eating without leaven to cook, especially for families with picky little kids. after the first few day when seder leftovers are finished, there are other meals to prepare. this is/would be a fine 'chol ha moed' lunch. i've made this and may again but i grew up on the single matzah pizza recipe.

Very bland, kids thought it was OK. BTW, not all Jews follow Kashrut. Do we really need to be snippy and make comments about "Passover Glazed Ham". Live and let live.

I agree with earlier posters. It's disrespectful to post recipes for a nonkosher seder. (A matza pizza is a fine thing for a dairy meal during Passover, of course.) The prohibition against eating milk with meat is as strong as that of eating chometz on Passover.

My picky-eater kids love it. Just use KforP soy cheese if you are not making a dairy meal...no big deal!

My kids love this; we have it every passover. As for mixing dairy and meat in a meal, there are many Jewish families (like ours, although we don't eat meat so I guess that we're kosher by default) that observe passover by simply not eating anything with levening. For families that don't keep kosher to begin with but observe passover by omitting bread and other foods, a menu mixing milk and meat might be acceptable.

Like the reviewer before me, I cannot understand how you can publish a Passover Seder menu that mixes dairy and meat! Perhaps next time, you might provide a recipe for Passover Glazed Ham!

Just a note that of all times Passover is a "Kosher" meal and one should not serve a dairy pizza at the same meal they are serving meat.

I find the easiet way to make a kids matzoh pizza is to grease a cookie sheet with a little olive oil, then make a single layer of matzohs on the sheet. Drizzle the matzohs with olive oil, and cover with chopped tomatoes (or tomato sauce) seasoned with oregano and basil. Top with cheese (and veggies if desired). Bake in a 350 oven about 10 minutes. My kids love this and it doesn't involve making a crust. They ask for it year round, not just at Passover!

Son-in-law enjoyed preparing it, and the whole family gobbled it up!
