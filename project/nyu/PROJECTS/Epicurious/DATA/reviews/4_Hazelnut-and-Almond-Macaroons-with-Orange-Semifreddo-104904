The macaroons are so delicious. The whole dessert was hit.

Highly recommend!!! I made several batches of macaroons. For the first one, I had the nuts stuck as well, but the next couple of batches were just perfect when I finely chopped hazelnuts and almonds. Also I didn't have ice-cream maker, so it took a while to freeze Orange Semifreddo in the freezer. This desert is light, tasty, easy to make. I loved combination of flavors of macaroons and oranges

Everything about this dish is delicious and it was the hit of the dinner party! I do not recommend making the entire thing in one day, though, and make sure you have parchment paper handy and your ice cream bowl frozen and ready to go! Also, chop the nuts fine enough so they won't get stuck in the tip of the pastry bag like mine did! :)

use potato flour for the potato starch

This is a great desert that's fairly easy to make. The best part is you can make it in advance. The orange sause has a really wonderful intense flavor that went over big!
