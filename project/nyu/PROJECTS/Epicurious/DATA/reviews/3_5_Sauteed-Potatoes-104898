This is a delicious potato dish and goes great with the spiced ham. It is so simple, but ends up tasting better than the sum of its parts.

I like that the potatoes are parboiled first...less time in the pan. I added garlic salt and tossed in finely chopped rosemary instead of the parsley. Great with steak.

So wonderful I don't even know what to say. Perfect. I serve this for guests frequently and everyone just loves it. You may be able to buy clarified butter at the supermarket - it's called "Ghee" and while some would say it's a bit different, it is very, very similar and reduces the effort of the recipe.

These potatoes are terrific. I concur on the use of clarified butter. The potatoes took a bit longer than specified but maybe that was because I am at high altitude or because I quadrupled the recipe to serve 6 families (43 people), although I cooked it in batches. They looked beautiful and were tender. Never thought of parboiling diced potatoes before.

I will never again use anything but clarified butter if that's what the recipe calls for. It makes a dramatic difference in the end product. Thanks, reviewers, for making that clear. The potatoes were picture perfect.

Very delicious. My first time using clarified butter and now I'm hooked. I made plenty so I could have leftovers. I'm looking forward to having sauteed potatoes with my breakfast in the morning.

I wanted a simple but delicious potato dish to compliment other food for Easter. This turned out nicely and was simple to make. Definitely use clarified butter. I usually clarify a pound of butter at a time, skim off the foam, pour off the middle and store. It makes a difference with this dish. Leftovers heat up well so make plenty.

This is a recipe for "sophistocated home fries." I didn't realize the difference using clarified butter would make, but it does. Dried parsely works ok, but fresh is better if you have it handy. Even the little ones ate this with no complaints, and no ketchup.
