I followed this recipe closely and I just don't like it...I personally don't like the combo of cinnamon/raisin unless it's a bagel. With those ingredients and the lemon, it's WAY too sweet for me. I was hoping for something a bit more savory...since I have like 2 pounds left over, I will use it to experiment with making it better...updates pending...

Very nice flavors and an easy recipe to construct variations. Used only 1 large onion, half the tomatoes, 3tsp dry roasted and ground cumin, 1 tsp cumin seeds in oil with onions, 3tsp ground coriander.

preserved lemon peel is the trick here. i also cooked the onions until they became a bit caramelized. like others, i used canned chick peas and simmered them for about 15 minutes with the cinnamon sticks and cumin. i didn't want the dish to become overly sweet so i removed 3/4 of the cinnamon sticks before i combined the chickpeas with the tomatoes. i also two cans of chickpeas instead of one can and was quite happy with the result. i served quinoa as the side dish. this will become a go to recipe for me.

Good flavor, though a little thin. more like a chunky soup. But wow, it makes so very much. I served 4 adults and 2 kids (over couscous) and barely made a dent in it.

No big deal, despite using fresh spices (and doubling them) and chick peas from scratch. The flavors were all there, but they didn't meld together. Will not make again.

Very good , hearty vegetarian entree. Like others have said, double the spices and add more preserved lemon.

I really enjoyed this. I used half the amount of tomato, canned chickpeas, half a lemon squeezed and thrown in as thin wedges, extra of the spices, and used V8 as the liquid. I also just threw everything (except the spinach, until the end) into a crockpot. I was really happy about how it came out. Great dish, and really easy that way.

I also used 1 can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed, instead of dried. I sauteed 2 onions til brown and then added the cumin, coriander and 1 tsp cinnamon and cooked that for about five minutes to let the spices bloom before adding the other ingredients. I used chard instead of spinach and a regular chopped lemon (whole lemon) instead of preserved lemon peel. And I used only one 28 oz can of diced tomatoes plus their juice and about a quarter can's worth of water. I cooked it covered for about an hour to let the liquid really combine with the raisins and chickpeas, and then uncovered at the end to thicken it. I served it with couscous. Delicious and made 5 servings even with my reductions. Did not need any salt--taste before adding it.

I used tinned chickpeas and dried mint instead of the spinach. I didn't have any preserved lemons, but added a little mild chilli powder for a bit of extra interest. All in all, this was a fantastic store-cupboard stew, which is just what I need when I've nothing fresh in but an old onion!

I don't know what all the fuss is about. I found this to be ok at best. With so many forks I thought it would be more flavorful, even after doubling the spices,using vegi stock to cook the chick peas in, & adding extra lemon juice. For the amount of cooking time I didn't think it was worth it.

This recipe is rich with flavour and very flexible! Very easy to make. Once, due to what I had (or didn't have) on hand, I halved the recipe, used canned chick peas - not dried, ground cinnamon - not the sticks, used fresh lemon juice and peel - not the preserved lemon, added one clove of garlic , chopped dried apricots - instead of raisins and then added 1 cubed and peeled yam. AND it still was DELICIOUS! My vegetarian guest loved it. This is a keeper!

I made this with canned chick peas but everything else was as listed and I served it with brown rice. My vegetarian dinner guests raved and it has become a staple in my repertoire

I made this with what I had on hand (ground cinnamon, fresh lemon, canned chick peas) and was surprised at how good it was. What a great pantry dinner! Ate it over rice, also good left over.

yum, yum, yum! I made this at the last minute in a hurry with what I had on hand and it was still fantastic. I used canned chickpeas and some canned black eyed peas, fresh lemon (added some juice), ground cumin only, no corriander. I can only imagine how good it would have been if I'd had the rest of the ingredients. I will definitely make this again, I will probably add more spinach.

Yum! I used chopped dried apricots instead of raisins, canned chickpeas instead of dry, and swiss chard instead of spinach. Also increased the spice amount. Lovely blend of flavors, and it made the house smell wonderful while it cooked.

Outstanding. For those who, like me, were wondering how much liquid you need if you are using drained canned chickpeas, here is what I did: 3 cups veg stock and 1 cup of the tomato liquid. Also I used only 3 14oz cans of tomatoes. It was plenty and I think lets the other flavors show through. This dish is now a staple in our house.

Very flavorful, easy. A really great vegetarian dish. Bonus point, it freezes remarkably well.

I have cooked this dish several times. I always make my own chick-peas from scratch, then double the spices and this time used dried sliced up apricots for a change in lieu of raisins. (Although, raisins are also good.)Reserve the canned tomato fluid as you may not need it - I didn't. I added several chopped up garlic cloves sauted with the onions. If you like spicy you can also add red pepper flakes. The whole stew must be cooked for a lot longer than it says, like a few hours, to get chick-peas soft enough. Should be made ahead for good flavor and can be frozen.

I made this exactly accoding to the recipe (except I omitted the tomatoes juices, as suggested by previous reviewers) - and it was wonderful! I served it with Couscous with Seven Vegetables and my dinner party was a hit! For those who thought the spices needed sharpening, I suggest using preserved lemons (they're easy to make, you just have to plan ahead or always keep a jar of them in the refrigerator. The lemons add a dimensonality that's hard to duplicate.

I don't know if Jaleo has something like this on the menu, but it'd be at home there--just exquisitely lively flavors. Their spinach and pine nuts dish has the same fresh sweetness, though it's less complex than this. Based on earlier comments, I doubled the spices but left everything else alone. Cooked it up (except for spinach and raisins) on the morning of a weeknight dinner party. People *demolished* it.

Does anyone know if this recipe is similar to the dish served at Jaleo in Washington DC?

I felt a little guilty when I served this as several-day-old leftovers to a house guest, but there just wasn't time to go out or cook something fresh. Happily, she loved it and even asked for the recipe! And really, this is one of those meals that only improves with each day as leftovers. The spinach and the raisins were what really made it great.

Rating: 4
This is my absolute standby. Delicious, quick (with canned chickpeas), festive = great vegan main course. It can sit on the stove forever, just be sure to add the raisins relatively late, otherwise they blow up to olive-size. Don't skimp on the spices, and add the spinach at the VERY end.

Rating: 3
This was very good, but next time i would try pureeing some of it in the food processor before adding the spinach, to make it a more even consistency. i served it over whole wheat couscous and my family didn't have any complaints.

I agree that this recipe is very good. It goes well with couscous. I used golden raisins, about half of what the recipe called for. The leftovers are fantastic, too, although I found that it got sweeter with time, so I'd use even less raisins next time. I will make this again.

I was intrigued by one reviewer's observation that this tasted "clean"--and I agree with her. I made some modfications--halved the amt. of tomato, added 4 lg. cloves of garlic, used frozen spinach, and fresh lemon (juice and peel!) and added leftover chicken. I like thick stews so I pureed about 2 cups of mixture and added it back to the mix. YUM. Great dish.

My body literally thanked me every time I ate this dish (had left overs). It left me feeling that I had eaten the most healthy meal available. A cleansing feeling in my belly. Although the ingredients are not all fresh, the dish tastes as if it were. I even cheated and used canned chick-peas!

Rating: 3
Excellent! Took the advice of other reviewers and did the following: halved everything except the spices, 1/4 cup of raisins, 1 can chick peas, 2cups diced tomatoes, added some chopped zucchini and 2 cups of vegetable stock, since I didn't have cooking liquid from the chick peas. Served over parsley mashed reg/sweet potatoes. A yummy, healthy week night treat.

This is really an excellent dish, appreciated by my vegetarian and meat-eating friends alike. The flavors are fresh, bright and distinctive, and last time I made it several people asked for the recipe. Easy to make and well worth it.

The combination of spinach and chickpeas is unusually delicious! I substituted freely; using canned chickpeas, frozen chopped spinach, fresh chopped tomatoes, lemon rind, a nectarine (it had a mealy texture and I didnt want it to go to waste) and dried currants that I wanted to use up. I added the cinnamon, lemon rind and coriander to the oil and then cooked the onions for a long time over very low heat. Then I added a clove of chopped garlic sauteing it for a minute.Then threw in the chick peas, tomatoes, currants and the chopped nectarine. Covered it keeping the heat on low, for 15 minutes,then added the frozen spinach and cooked until the spinach was cooked.

Can I ask; what kind of dried beans did everyone use?

Have cooked this recipe twice now - once with canned & once with freshly cooked chickpeas. Although delicious, for my taste it's a little too delicately spiced if the spices are cooked in with the chickpeas. I prefer to add them to the stew (upped in quantities from the recipe, plus garlic).

Rating: 3
Very nice recipe. I followed the advice of not adding reserve tomato liquid to the stew. I tasted the stew mid-way and found it was lacking in "something" so I grated some fresh cinnamon and added a bay leaf which enhanced the flavours. Looking forward to trying it tomorrow after all the flavours have melded. Great dish for those chilly October and November days.

Rating: 3
This is a superb and simple dish. I didn't have preserved lemon so i used fresh lemon rind which was nice. I also had to add a little sugar at the end to reduce the acidity od the tomatoes, and the next day it was a little too sweet, but the first night it was scrumptious.

Rating: 3
Yum! A fool-proof, indestructable recipe! I forgot the lemon, added too much cumin seed (so I skipped the powder) I used canned chick-peas because I was in a hurry and didn't add as much spinich because my guests were walking in the door. I even committed the cardinal sin of not testing a recipe before serving it to guests but I still prevailed! Leftovers do get sweeter, so next time I make this (and I WILL make it again) I will reduce the raisins to a half-cup - but the raisins are still good so don't cut them out. I might also add more chick-peas next time.

Rating: 3
3 forks only because I want to refine my own approach--the recipe is GREAT. I took the advice of an earlier review and made sure the chickpeas were fully cooked before mixing in the other ingredients. Also, another earlier review said 'too tomatoey,' so I reserved the tomato juice from the canned plum tomatoes until I had made up the stew, then tasted. Didn't need the extra tomato juice, either for flavor reasons or for liquid reasons. Next time: I will probably increase the proportion of chickpeas slightly, I may add some heat (hot peppers, though, not pepper sauce of any kind), and I will definitely make a larger batch! My husband and I loved it. An interesting feature of it left over: the sweetness of the cinnamon and coriander increases, so watch the proportions when preparing.

Very different and yummy, and good for dinner with my vegetarian sister. I used canned chick peas and fresh lemon, and added a little lemon juice right before serving. I halved the recipe, and still have ample leftovers -- it's very filling.

We all loved this! I used four cans of garbanzo beans instead of dried. I skipped the soaking part. I cooked the dish with the cinnamon sticks and removed just before serving. I omitted the raisins (I don't like them). I served this dish with curried couscous (with cranberries instead of raisins) and the entire meal was sublime!

Why didn't I love this dish like everyone else? I am puzzled as to why mine wasn't so great. The only change I made was to used tomatoes already diced...which may have been the problem since it tasted too tomatoey. Will try again, but unimpressed the first time.

I thought this was superb. I zested a lemon and added some lemon juice (couldn't find preserved lemons) and it was marvelous. I doubled the recipe, and it froze and subsequently microwaved well, too. Mmmmmmmmm.

This is a wonderful recipe - very easy to make, delicious, unusual, perfect if you're trying to accommodate vegans. The quantity is enormous - it serves 16 if there are other courses and accompanying dishes. I didn't have preserved lemon on hand, but (following instructions found online) thinly sliced a fresh lemon, salted the slices, and sauteed them in a little olive oil until soft. I chopped the cooked lemon slices and substituted that for the preserved lemon, which worked well.

This was a great dish: low-fat, easy to prepare and delicious. I used canned chick peas instead of dried and therefore skipped the entire soaking step and the first step of cooking the peas. I just cooked the onions with the cinnamon and cumin seeds then added all of the other ingredients and spices and cooked 45 minutes. I also added three cloves of garlic. Yum! In the future, I would use more cumin.

This is my idea of a near perfect recipe -- you can prep the various components ahead of time; it's not "fussy", it simply simmers slowly for a long time; it's delicious, filling and healthful, makes a lot of food, tastes even better leftover, and the house smells sensational while it's cooking! I added a lot more preserved lemon -- pulp and all -- than the recipe called for, probably twice as much, which made it taste very "Moroccan". The next time I make it, I'm going to try it without the raisins, which I found slightly disconcerting in a bean dish. But this is a definite keeper!

It's a keeper. Used my pressure cooker to pre-soak and cook beans, so I could make it all in one afternoon. Did not think it too sweet. Made a lot, so I'm thinking of making it for our next pot luck.

Wonderful flavor! I had heard that tomato acids slow or stop the cooking of the chick peas, and this seemed to be the case. I would add the tomatoes and juice only after the chickpeas reached the desired texture.
