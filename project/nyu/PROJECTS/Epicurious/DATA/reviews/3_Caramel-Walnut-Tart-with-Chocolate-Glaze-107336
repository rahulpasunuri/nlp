I wish I'd read the reviews first, I almost always do! I really wanted to love this recipe, but I was very disappointed. The crust smelled great while baking but 1) shrank so much that the filling didn't fit and 2) was shockingly bland and textureless for all those toasted nuts. I'm pretty good at caramel, but the filling was much too soft so as soon as I cut into the tart (which did look pretty when uncut, by the way) the filling ran out all over the tart form. Messy. And the caramel "filling" was *much* too sweet. Altogether a lot of effort for a pretty tart whose whole was much less than the sum of its parts!

This dessert is fabulous, but it is not very forgiving. If the caramel doesn't set (which has never happened to me), it would be a mess. But, when the caramel is toothsome and firm under a layer of smooth chocolate atop a crisp, sandy crust, it's darn near perfect. I serve very small pieces topped with barely sweetened whipped cream, and it always disappears.

I had problems with the caramel too. I cooked it as long as I was supposed to, plus quite a bit longer, and it never turned amber. I finally quit and what I had was more like the filling of pecan pie than caramel. I anticipated this would be very sweet, so I made mine in a rectangular tart pan and cut bite-sized pieces. Might make it again -- people liked it, runny filling and all.

This is one of my families favorites! My kids and hubby beg me to make this. I leave out the nuts in the caramel and sub pecans for the walnuts.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that this tart is just *way* too sweet. That says a lot coming from a person who prefers dessert to the main course. (!) The idea of this dessert is a good one, but there is just too much caramel for a pie like this. It's overwhelming. I suggest making just a fourth of the caramel in the recipe and making all of the chocolate glaze, so you get a better balance of the flavors. The crust also doesn't do much for this tart. Use a favorite pate sucree or short crust, or do as I did and make a cookie crumb crust. Make it thick to support the substantial fillings. I do suggest looking elsewhere for a better recipe. There are some on this site.

To anyone who liked the idea of this recipe but was disappointed with the result:try Aunt Sonia's Choc.Peanut butter Extravaganza from the Godiva Website. It's the best dessert I've ever made and is similar to this one,only better.

Not successful the first time. I have had a checkered record when it comes to making caramel in general- last time I cooked it too long and it turned rock hard, so this time the recipe said 8 minutes; I tried 10. It still didn't look amber, but I stopped anyway. The stuff set, but it only tasted very sweet, and of course not of caramel at all. How long did people have to cook it to get it to carmelize? I will try again. About serving sizes...I often find that this web site allows about 3 times as much as one person should eat for one serving portion of dessert. I almost always cut things much smaller than they suggest.

I also made this for thanksgiving dinner, and found I had the same experience as several of the other reviewers; It looked pretty but, was way too sweet (the candy bar analogy fits)so my guest only had a bite or two, and the carmel did not really set completely was firm enough to creat the pie shape and look nice, but once a piece was cut, all the slowly carmel oozed out of the middle(and I tried twice thinking I may have done something wrong the first time) would not make it again..

Excellent recipe, however a small slice will sufice even the largest sweet tooth. I found freezing the tart will harden the chocolate so that it doesn't run when cut.

HELP! I made this yesterday, and of course it tasted great...but the caramel never "set", so it ran all over the place. What could I have done wrong?

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit. Yes it is sweet but you don't need to eat a lot of it and if you serve it with fresh whipped cream which is very lightly sweetened it helps to cut the sweetness. It has a beautiful presentation and I have received many requests for the recipe. I will make it again.

Fabulous! I made this for two parties and everyone devoured it. It is rich and delicious, especially if you like chocolate and caramel.

Gave this two forks since the consensus on this was about split down the middle. Those who had a huge sweet tooth loved this, but it was way too sweet fot those who didn't. It's really like a candy-bar in a crust. My husband devoured this, but I probably won't make it again since there are so many other good dessert recipies out there that I know we'd both want to devour.

My guests loved this. It beat the pimpkin pie and the apple cake. Yes, it's WAY sweet, but the good thing about that it that the portions can be very small. It goes a long way.

My guests thought they had died and gone to chocolate heaven with this recipe. It beat out the pumpkin merangue pie by a landslide for Thanksgiving dinner. Looks like I've started a new tradition.

Thought this looked great, but made this for Thanksgiving and was really disappointed with the results. The crust did not have a good texture and very little taste, and the finished product was just horribly sweet (and I *love* sweets!). Everyone thought it looked beautiful, but barely any of it was actually eaten. Boo hiss!

This was a disappointment. The shortbread crust was so-so and didn't offer enough flavor or texture contrast with the caramel filling. A graham crust might have been better. The caramel in the finished tart was very runny and seeped through the crust in a few places. The tart looked great but that was it's best feature.

This is a definite never do again. I have a huge sweet tooth, but it was way too much for me. The caramel nut tart from November 1998 is so much better than this.

I just made this for Thanksgiving dinner. My husband and I found it to be too sweet. The caramel was exceptionally sweet. The chocolate glaze was very good. The crust was difficult to handle and did not lend much to the overall tart. In the end, I found it too much effort for too little result. This will not be added to my desert lists.

This tart was delicious. The crust and filling were wonderful. Everyone that tried it loved it. I had extra filling and crust so I made small individual tarts out of the leftovers. Tasted just as great. I would definetly make this recipe again, although it is a little time consuming.

The caramel and crust tastes great. The glaze was another story. It was runny; I would have preferred if it had congealed more.

Very delicious! It is VERY rich and very sweet. My husband compared it to eating candy in the shape of a pie. I would make it again, but save it for a special occasion.
