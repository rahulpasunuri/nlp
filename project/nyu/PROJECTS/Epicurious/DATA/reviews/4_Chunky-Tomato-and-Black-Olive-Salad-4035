For the few ingredients, this was amazingly tasty. We used a container of baby arugula, because that's what our local market had. We also mixed in a some spinach to use up what we had around. Other than what's mentioned above, I stayed true to the recipe (unusual for me, I tend to be a tinkerer :) We made 1&1/2 the amounts here and it made just the right amount for a side salad for a party of 8 adults . I recommend using high quality balsamic, as it makes a huge difference in flavor. I will definitely be serving this many more times!

Absolutely loved this. Although I often find arugula too strong, in this recipe it was perfectly balanced with the other ingredients.

Very good and simple. Use very ripe and fresh plum tomatoes/romas, they are in season as I write this where I live. I used less arugula than called for (well, how big is a bunch?) - about 1/3 cup in all. Nice, simple flavours served with lasagna. Used "Italian country vinegar" as did not have balsamic on hand...red wine vinegar could work too.

DELIGHTFUL! A simple, fabulous keeper of a recipe! Kept thinking should add pepper or something more but the secret is the simplicity. Put over spinach & arugula from bag as I was under time constraint. WONDERFUL!

My boyfreind and I love this salad. I make it as a side to homemade pizza, and it tastes just wonderful. I omit the arugula simply because I never have it. (Anything considered gourmet costs an arm and a leg in Arkansas, if you can find it at all.)

This salad was wonderful. Everyone loved it! You must use fresh tomatoes from your Farmer's Market!

This recipe also makes an excellent and easy pasta salad. I added 1/2 lb cooked penne; doubled the oil and vinegar and added some parmesan. Next time I'll try fresh goat cheese or feta. It all came together in less than 45 minutes and tasted great!

How can anything made of arugula not taste heavenly? OK, I'm a little biased. For a salad this simple, be sure to use the freshest ingredients. I used cherry tomatoes to simplify the prep and omitted the red onions because I hate them.

Wonderful side to lasagna! I couldn't recommend this more. The ingredients really taste great together. I used more tomatoes and balsamic vinegar.
