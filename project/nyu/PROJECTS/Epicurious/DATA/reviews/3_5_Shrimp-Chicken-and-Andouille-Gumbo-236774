First this recipe makes ALOT of food. I did half recipe and this is feeeding a family of five with grown boys for two days. Very easy to follow recipe and tasty, I used a full teaspoon of cayanne.

This was delicious & most of us loved it.(Which is what counts with us; you can't eat an certificate of authenticity.)Half a recipe was way too much for 5. Leftovers freeze well. My changes were: no okra (and I really don't care about your opinion on that!) cut chicken smaller, used butter for roux & cooked about 45 mins, less bell pepper, sub chicken broth for clam juice. My point is it's a very flexible recipe that you can tweak to suit YOUR taste. I put gumbo file and LA Hot Sauce on the table, and served it with rice, cornbread, and collards (Paula Dean's). It was a bit too spicy with the Thomas Ragin' Cajun Original andouille; I'll use medium next time. It's a lot of work, but a great make ahead for a crowd and a special occasion.

good, but not gumbo. a friend made this then pointed me to the recipe, letting me know the gumbo i made--which he adored--wasn't authentic. i'd left out the tomatoes and wine. growing up with cajun cookery, i will say that tomatoes are an absolute no-no in gumbo. you might find clams, but not clam juice; no white wine; green bells, not red. there are more authentic gumbo recipes out there, for sure. oh, and don't forget the filé ... really such an essential part.

This is a great recipe. It was a big hit at our holiday party. Love the fact that its better made ahead. Half the recipe was plenty. Seasoned and cooked chicken beforehand and made the roux over med-low heat (30-40 min) as suggested by others. I did substitute fish stock for clam juice (and separated some before adding shrimp) to accommodate a shellfish allergy. Its pretty easy if you do the prep work in advance and definitely worth the effort. I served it over brown rice with corn bread muffins. Will surely make it again.

definitely half the recipe and it will still feed 16. Make sure to use real andouille sausage, it spices the whole dish.

A good, solid recipe that held up to my tweaking based on ingredients on hand. I didn't have clam juice and discovered late that we were out of chicken stock, so I used an equivalent amount of water and it was still tasty. I halved the recipe, and it was PLENTY for our family of 4. I did not use the "make ahead" option, but I'm looking forward to the left-overs this week.

This was a big hit at a recent party. Great in terms of making ahead of time. It makes a HUGE amount of soup.

This is a wonderful recipe - easy, other than the prep work, but after everything is added, it simmers into a delicious soup. The only thing I added were some red pepper flakes and smoked paprika to spice it up a bit.

This is a fantastic recipe if you love veggies. If you are a fan of a less veggie-centric gumbo, this is probably not your recipe. I used fresh tomatoes from the garden instead of canned and skipped the clam juice (because I didn't have any on hand). I used smoked beef sausage instead of andouille. Add extra broth if you like it soupy. I made half of this recipe and had gumbo for weeks. Freezes and reheats very well, tastes even better as leftovers. Serve over good steamed rice. Overall, a very flavorful dish that is flexible and can (should!) be made ahead.

This recipe is a keeper. I agree it even tastes better on day 2, but day 1 is pretty darn good too.

Great recipe and really works well when you make the base the night before. All the other review are correct though: the "16 servings" fed our group of 20+ with plenty of leftovers. And my biggest stock pot was full to the brim!

Very good recipe. Like many others, I cut it in half, and am still amazed at how much I have. I'll be freezing most of it, as there are only two of us in the house, but that's okay because it will be nice to have in the winter. I also used fresh okra, because it's in season. I did leave out the shrimp for this serving, but may add it to the frozen portions when I reheat them. Very delicious, despite being a lot of work.

Im not the cook in the house but this struck a note with me so I went to work and after a fair amount of prep and worry, it turned out great. I halved the recipe, froze about 4 quarts in separate containers for lunch and dinners later in the month and they also were terrific!

I usually make a 1/4 recipe, but otherwise follow as written. Delicious. A big winter-time favourite in our house.

After reading some other reviews, I made half the recipe and it still made a lot. I can't imagine making the full recipe unless you are feeding a football team. Also, I used green bell peppers instead of red bell peppers. I can't imagine it affects the taste (maybe presentation), and red bell peppers are so much more expensive. Anyway, we thoroughly enjoyed this gumbo. It was much better the second day. If you are serving to guests or a football team, I would recommend making it a day or two in advance.

I made half the recipe and we served six and had leftovers. I made the recipe up to the okra and shrimp a day ahead and took it to the beach where we added fresh shrimp for the final touch. The okra was frozen and cut but worked out very well. Everyone raved. I think it took longer that 5 minutes to darken the roux.

It was delicious. I was having 25 people over for lunch. I measured very carefully and it yielded 15 quarts of food, certainly much more than the 16 servings indicated. In fact it probably served more like 30!

I liked the sound of this gumbo recipe. It contained the items I would want in a gumbo. Because the recipe made such a hugh amount, I cut it by 2/3rds. I wanted enough for 4 people with leftovers for lunch later in the week. It was a perfect thing to do. I did not use the clam juice but did increase the chicken stock. This worked very well. I added about 1/2 teaspoon old bay seasoning. Also I cooked the okra separate and rinsed it several times before adding it to the gumbo with the already cooked shrimp I bought frozen. This method keeped the gumbo from being slimy. We were very pleased with the outcome. Our guests loved it and so did we. I am glad I found this and will make it again. I wish I had a photo for you, it was beautiful.

I was inspired to make this gumbo after seeing The Princess and the Frog (which takes place in New Orleans and is very food-centric). I did not look closely enough at the recipe beforehand, so did not realize how much it makes! Needless to say I had a ton of leftovers, so I delivered some to various friends and family. Everyone loved it! They loved that AND and sausage (adds a lot of nuance to the flavor). They also said that it was very light compared with other gumbos, so you don't feel stuffed after a helping or two. I think this is because the roux only called for a cup of flour. I will definitely make this again, but will probably halve the recipe, just so we aren't eating it for a week straight.

This is a very nice gumbo recipe. It could easily be cut in half or perhaps a quarter. The 16 servings would be VERY large portions. My entire family enjoyed this gumbo for several days; we froze some for later enjoyment and I still threw some out. I used 1/2 chicken thighs and 1/2 chicken breasts. Next time I will add a bit more heat; our family likes it hot.

This is one of my favorite dinner party recipes. Well worth the prep work. Pay close attention to the rouille; it's the most important part of the flavor base.

I made this for Christmas lunch, and it was delicious. I have never made a roux before and found that it was easy but took a closer to a half an hour. I would advise prepping all vegetables in advance. I would have preferred it to be a little spicier, but I was serving a mix of adults and children so I did not want it to be too hot. I did add more garlic and a bit of sea salt at the end. I also roasted my chicken thighs (skin on) with sea salt and olive oil and then shredded the meat and added it to the gumbo as I prefer that to cubed meat. It is great to make a day ahead as the flavors develop. I added the shrimp and frozen okra as I was reheating to serve. Next time, I might kick it up a bit, but it was delicious all the same.

ummm, you don't put white wine in real gumbo, nor do you put bell peppers, tomatoes or clam juice. The andouille sausage is optional as is the okra in real gumbo. You use file/sassafras or a roux or okra, these are all thickening agents and you add shrimp, crab and sausage and chicken;This isn't REAL gumbo and you don't add parsley. This is more of a fancy soup with some "gumbo" ingredients. Sauce is supposed to be a little thick, not REAL thick, just a little thick, a little thicker than a traditional soup. I'll give it a try, but they need to rename this because this isn't REAL gumbo I know there are a lot of variations of Gumbo, both from the Cajuns (file) and Creole folks (Okra), I happen to have both in the fam, but this recipe to me is way off, especially with the White wine, bell peppers and parsley We use a roux in my house (that's the cajun side of us, lol). The darker the roux the deeper the flavor

I had this over at a friends and we all just loved it. Especially nice for those that don't want a spicy gumbo. OUr host skipped the flour for those of us that are gluten intolerant. Still, nicely thick.

This was pretty good we enjoyed it so I'm giving 3, but I agree with others it's a bit bland, I even added 1Tbs of Emeril's Essence but I think the missing ingredient might be salt. I also thought it should be thicker. I will probably keep looking for a stellar Gumbo recipe.

Gumbo without okra is wonderful-- dark roux, chicken or seafood stock, onion, celery, garlic, and whatever seafood/fowl you desire.

This is an excellent recipe. Cook it in a slow cooker for several hours, and it seems to blend all the flavors. I served it for Christmas Eve, and everyone loved it. J

This "gumbo" sucked. It has almost no taste which is shocking given all the ingredients. I have made tons of soups/stews from Bon Appetit and 99% are great. I always get raves for my cooking but not this time. My advice to anyone even thinking about trying this recipe is don't do it unless you're into bland, tastless stew.

Interesting recipe. However, this is not gumbo. This is a gourmet soup with Louisiana themed ingredients.

I made half the recipe and it could have fed 16 hungry people. My family thought it was bland made as is. I added Cajun seasonings and it tasted much better the next day. Oh yes, and it took a half an hour to get the roux to a dark reddish brown.

Excellent Recipe. I cut it in half, otherwise we'd be eating gumbo for weeks. I also used red pepper flakes rather than cayenne. Oh, and most importantly, I used butter rather than oil, it's the traditional way to may a roux.

Nice recipe. Not too spicy, so very democratic. Cut the recipe in half as we are only 2. Used fresh tomatoes and left out parsely & bay leaf - - all was well.

Recipe turned out great. It was spiced just right that the kids could eat it as well - I added hot sauce to my own. Cooking the sausage in the mixture adds quite a bit of fat that rises to the top and can be spooned off. I may try partially cooking the sausage and draining the fat ahead of time.

Awesome - I cut the recipe down to make "4 servings" which actually turned out to be enough for 6-8. Yummy and easy.

Wonderful! I halved the recipe and changed it a little by not using as much sausage (not my fave) and subsituting a small can of clams for the clam juice. It was wonderful and half a recipe was enough for 10 servings. Yum!

I thought this was great but after reading the reviews and a couple other sites about gumbo I made some changes. First, you have to make a roux and it is going to take 30- 45 mins. Second, add some sort of southern spice mixture to heat it up. Finally, I used extra hot sausage and tomatoes with hot pepper in them as well. It turned out really well. O...brown all the meat and throw it in at the last min. It will be better the next day.

Rating: 3
I didn't use the shrimp. I did use creole seasoning and it kicked it up a notch. The roux definitely takes some time. Allow at least 30 minutes of constant attention or you will scorch it. I used much less garlic and not as many red peppers cause they are very expensive here. Don't skimp on the tomatoes as they cut the slightly oily taste from the roux. Using a file powder at the end will correct a gumbo that is not thick enough! I also skipped the Okra and it was just fine! I made this for a monthly Soup night I host and it got rave reviews. Definitely make it the day before so the flavors meld, the taste from the sausage really expresses itself the next day.

I halved this recipe and it still made an enormous quantity. Overall an excellent dish, maybe not the most authentic gumbo in the world with the red peppers and tomatoes but it is great on its own merits. The only alteration I made was to add 1tsp of white pepper as I like a good amount of bite to my gumbo. This is one I would definitely made again.

I used green bell peppers rather than red. They are cheaper and little more authentic. WAY more than 16 servings. I will try to half, if i decide to make again.

Out of this world. Though I must say, my roux (first time ever) took almost 45 minutes. I made this for a group of hungry friends who got together to build a fence. It was consumed in no time with lots of compliments. I adhered to the recip exactly and while it was a bit on the mild side, I think this is good when cooking for a group. Put some hot sauce on the side! I'll make it again when we need a new roof! Great recipe.

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday and everyone loved it! I altered it a little. The roux took me 10 minutes, turned a beautiful dark chocolate color. I reduced the amount of onions a bit, and used a medley of red, green, yellow and orange peppers. I used boneless breasts rather than thighs and reduced the amount of thyme (all I had was dried) and added plenty of salt and pepper. I let it simmer on a very low flame for about 2 hours, and then added the seafood (I added bay scallops as well). Simply delicious and great on a cold, cold night with crusty bread. May not be an authentic NO Gumbo, but it was good!

I made this for a Christmas Eve dinner, my first attempt at gumbo, and it received rave reviews. It does make far more than 16 servings. I divided leftovers among my friends, and we all enjoyed a second meal later in the week. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great (it also freezes well). Granted the tomatoes are an unusual addition, but it works. . .

I don't know of a single soul between Baton Rouge and New Orleans who would put red bell peppers and tomatoes in a gumbo with andouille. Tomato-based gumbo is for seafood (sometimes cooked with chicken pieces for flavor more than for eating). Yours isn't awful, but neither is it traditional or an outstanding new take-off.

Rating: 3
This was excellent and all my guests loved - it both when first served but especially when reheated. I made it the day before so that it had a chance to 'stew' but this made way more than what 16 people could eat - more like 30 people if you served any sidedish - I served a green salad and crusty rolls.

This is a great make ahead buffet recipe. It makes far more than 16 servings. It could easily feed about 25 people. I made only two alterations to the recipe: (1) I cooked the roux over medium low heat for about 25 minutes until it was chocolate brown; and (2) I browned the chicken before adding it to the gumbo. Everyone enjoyed it greatly and it received many compliments.

We liked it. Used cooked shrimp and added them at the last minute.

The problem with the recipe is the roux. A good Louisiana roux should take 30-45 minutes. You never get the oil too hot. After you add the flour, you turn the heat down and stir continuously over low heat until the roux is dark brown, similar in color to a hershey bar. Done correctly, it makes a big difference in the finished product.

Too much thyme, not enough ooomph! The roux is not dark and cooked enough. Tasted much better the second bowl and second day. Ended up adding Worcestershire, Tony Chachere's seasoning and Tabasco to give it some oomph. Agree with the other guy about it otherwise a ggod base. Better as a base for a seafood gumbo with cod, shrimp, crabmeat, and oysters.

I think this is a wonderful base to a much better gumbo. I brown the chicken thighs before adding, used local hot conecuh county sausage, and cleaned and cut in half some local blue crabs (talk about adding layers of flavors). Thanks for the recipe. I will use this again and again.

I couldn't wait for this recipe to be posted so that I can get my review on the site. When I received my 12/06 magazine, I immediately tried this recipe. I cut the recipe in half and my grocery store did not carry Anduille sausage so I used hot italian sausage. This was so delicious!! We raved about it for days. I suggest everyone who is thinking about making a nice gumbo for the cold weather days to try this. You won't be disappointed.
