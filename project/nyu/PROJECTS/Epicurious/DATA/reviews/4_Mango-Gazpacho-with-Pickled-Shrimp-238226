I have made this soup twice now both to rave reviews from my guests. The first time I pickled the shrimp and the second time I just added cold shrimp. I can't really say that the pickling added that much to the overall taste of the soup, however, they were very tasty on their own. I leave some mango, cucumber and celery in small dice in the soup for added texture. I have ice beverage forms that I make and freeze in advance and use as the serving "bowl". The presentation is awesome and the soup is sensational. This will stay in my repertoire. Unusual flavors and refreshing without being sweet. Try this one, you won't be disappointed!

Very very spicy. I should have added 1/2 jalapeno and then tasted. I could not see eating a bowl of it this spicy. Doubled the ingredients except for the ginger and jalapeno and it was much more palatable. Fresh tasting soup.....didn't add the shrimp as it really is not needed.....wondering what else to serve with besides a salad to give a nice balance?

Did not do the shrimp. This was the starter for a Hawaiian themed lunch for 35. Served the Gazpacho in plastic wine glasses. Used Trader Joe's frozen mangoes. Delicious! Main course, Sam Choy's Kalua Pig sandwiches on Hawaiian buns!

Only made the gazpacho and for a large crowd served it in plastic stemmed glasses. Delicious!

I didn't make the pickled shrimp but the mango gazpacho was amazing. Would definitely make it again.

Fantastic!!! I used my immersion blender and food processor for this one. Rave reviews from my guests and they requested the recipe from me. I left the cucumbers chopped for texture and didn't pickle the shrimp. I will definitely make this one again. I served it before plank salmon and it was great. I can't say enough about this recipe!

An amazing recipe! Like several other reviewers, I wasn't sure about the combination of pickled seafood and sweet soup. I also knew that I wasn't all that fond of lemongrass or anise --- two of the central flavors in the pickling. So I used the ginger/orange/lemon spices from the Shellfish Watermelon Ceviche on this site. BINGO! The soup is great on its own, but the salty seafood adds another dimension. (PS; I used Costco faux crab)

I enjoyed the gazpacho and would certainly make it again, but I'll use a different pickled shrimp recipe next time. Or I may just serve the gazapcho with some ceviche on the side. The gazpacho is best made the evening before you eat it...it tastes better after the flavors have had a day or so to blend.

I made the gazpacho alone and found it just delicious. It was so refreshing with a wonderful variety of flavors! They didn't quite meld, which was probably for the best--each ingredient shone through in every spoonful. I found the soup as good after about 5 day as it was the first day.

I was a bit worried about the combination of sweet mango and pickled shrimp but took the plunge anyway. The gazpacho is not too sweet. Despite that most of the blender was filled with mango the flavors of the cucumber, celery and apple come through. The shrimp is not too pickled and the combination is a great cool summer dish. I think it would be nice before paella, summer risotto or even some grilled pork. A good recipe to make ahead for a party or picnic.

This a great recipe packed with flavor and NOOOO fat! I substituted crab since my husband is alergic to shrimp and it was even better.

I made this Gazpacho last Friday night for a very special dinner party for my in-laws. It was really wonderful. Very complex flavors. I will make it again. Even my husband loved it and he hates fresh fruits and vegetables. I will not pickle the shrimp next time I make it however. It seemed to me like gilding the Lilly. I think the soup itself is flavorful enough.

The gazpacho was phenominal -- and so easy to prepare. I used fresh crab meat as my husband is algergic to shrimp and I think it works better than shrimp -- the richness of the crab was counter balanced nicely with the sweet/hot flavor of the gazpacho.
