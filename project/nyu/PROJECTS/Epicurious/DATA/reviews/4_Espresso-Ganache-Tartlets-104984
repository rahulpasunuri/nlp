I've made this many times using the small (1 to 2 bite-sized) tartlet shells purchased from a gourmet store. Guests love them and the small size is perfect after a big meal. Pass around the fleur de sel and serve with a nice glass of port.

I made this and it came out perfect and beautiful. So why the two forks? It is not a crowd-please and takes 2 hours to make (don't forget the 70 minutes chill time for the dough). It is a decadent confection, but not a dessert for the holidays. The kids would not eat it because of the dark chocolate and espresso making it bitter, and the adults took 1/4 of a tartlet tops because it's so rich. Serve with ice-cream of whip cream!!! It is however pretty amazing for breakfast w/ a cup of coffee. I will use the crust/dough again for something, as that came out great. Like Albany, NY I've only seen 4" tartlet pans. I stretched the dough by adding 1/4 stick of butter and 1/2 cup of flour more and it just perfectly made 6 4" tartlets. I stretched the ganache but there was no need to, I had a ton left over. I also subbed the espresso powder with two freshly pulled double-shots (a little over 1/3cup) and it came out good.

PS: the sea salt was by far the best. everyone should try it with salt!!!!

Oh man... This is my new go to dessert! I am the world's worst baker, and I never have any clue how to finish my dinner parties. Made this for a crowd of very skilled and PICKY bakers, and it blew everyone's socks off. I bought my tartlet shells from a gourmet store (I'm not kidding about the baking thing), and half way through chilling garnished two with candied orange, two with honey that I froze then cracked and sprinkled on, and two with fancy flaked sea salt. So elegant, so refined. I'm SO happy!

Excellent recipe very easy to make. My 4 year old son loved it.

Very smooth ganache. Following the temperature directions are very important in this recipe. Despite not following the directions exactly, it still got rave reviews. I used cupcake tins instead of tart tins so the shortbread crust came out too thick and only half the amount of ganache fit. I ended up using the rest of the ganache as a frosting for brownies after it had cooled to room temperature. Next time if I have any left over, I will use it as a layer for a genoise cake and rapid cool it in the fridge or freezer to keep that smooth consistency.

This is a show-stopper of a dessert! I couldn't find 3-inch tartlet pans with removable bottoms, so I used 4 1/2 inch, and I made 5 tartlets instead of 6. Came out beautifully. Used a mixture of Michael Recchiutti 85% bittersweet and Ghiradelli bittersweet. It's a truffle filling in a pastry shell...even the non-chocoholics in the bunch were blown away! Next time I make this I'll experiment with an attractive garnish of some sort on the top of the tartlet...
