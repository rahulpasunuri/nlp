I enjoyed making this and using my cast iron skillet kept all the ingredients on the dough. I did use a homemade pizza dough from a recipe on this site and I think it was probably much better like that.

I thought this was really good and very easy. I will definatley make again. I made it in my cast iron skillet. The crust had a nice flavor because of the olive oil.

good, not great. one suggestion i'd make is to avoid the pizza dough in a tube (which is horrible) and opt for a frozen ball of dough--many supermarkets now carry these and they're much better than the tube junk.

Nice enough as a change of pace,

Ok, so I wanted a quick meal and used refrig. pizza dough. Never again! It was nothing compared to fresh dough. Besides that I used mozzarella cheese and more olives. The red onions were overpowering so I would use less next time. I think instead of dough,next time I would just split a loaf of Italian bread, pile on the toppings and pop it under the broiler.
