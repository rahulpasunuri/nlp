I'm not sure why nobody has yet rated or reviewed this recipe, but I tried it one day when I was looking for a way to use up some very indifferent frozen grapes I'd purchased at a bulk-supply chain (which will remain nameless) and found it delightful. Nutmeg and lime juice with grapes! Who'd have thought! It's a great cold-weather recipe that livens up frozen fruit no end. And use kitchen shears to cut up the dried apricots; much faster than a sticky knife.
