This was good, but looked to make a huge amount. I made a 1/3 and it was more than I needed, but I'll use the rest later this week. I like more pickle in my tartar sauce but enjoyed the addition of the capers and I think it needed a little lemon juice.

Yum. Just yum. I followed the directions exactly except I made my own mayonnaise, Alton Brown's recipe.

I have had this at the Pearl Oyster Bar. It is very similar to a recipe given to me by an elderly gourmet cook. She called it "Turtle Sauce" based on the mispronunciation of her little boy. Once you have this, every other "turtle sauce" is put to shame.

I LOVED this tartar sauce. I have been wanting to figure out how to make something like this for ages and I'm so happy to have found it. This will be my "go to" tartar sauce recipe from now on.

I made this Tartar Sauce as an element in a coleslaw dressing. This recipe makes a LOT of sauce. It kept well for a week, and I used it to make tuna salad (instead of straight mayo)and later served a dab of it with crab cakes. Its very rich and can only really be used in small amounts.
