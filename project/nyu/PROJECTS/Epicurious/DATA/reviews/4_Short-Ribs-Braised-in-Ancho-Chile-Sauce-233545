I made this recipe as written and the results were fabulous. I returned to this recipe when I needed to serve a group of hungry guys. I used pork shoulder rather than short ribs and it was fantastic. Great depth of flavor. Didn't have Ancho chiles so used Guajillos instead and served it with soft polenta. Received rave reviews.

OMG my neighbor made this and served this to us tonight. Can not say enough good things. Served this with -- goat cheese mashed potatoes of all things... to die for. :)

Excellent. Used 2-3 lbs of pork ribs and 1/2 the recipie for sauce. Cooked 2 hr 20 min- probably could have done less, maybe 1:45. Sauce almost all evaporated in the last hour, and I had to reconstitute with beef broth. Very tasty, will definately make this again. Easy, took 30 min to prep. Served with polenta and salad. Yum.

I love this recipe - the flavours blend so well that you cannot detect the use of coffee. My addition is a few drops of orange blossom water just before serving - gives a nice high note!

We've made these twice now in two weeks. The first time, we used a small number of ribs, and I didn't pay much attention to it while it was cooking. The liquid did get quite low, but the sauce was really rich. This time we got a larger quantity (not quite the 6lbs it called for - my dutch oven won't accommodate that amount) and I kept my eye on it. There was no problem with the sauce evaporating. Both times I've substituted amber beer for the ancho chili water, and made a day in advance so I could skim the fat. The whole time it's cooking our eyes are watering! Yet it's not spicy at all when it's done. Make sure you've got your kitchen fan on. Maybe open a door...

Super bland in my opinion. I made this for a dinner party of 15. I did it on mashed potatoes. I could just taste meat and heat out of the ribs so at the last minute I threw together a gorgonzola sauce and it saved the day but without that this would have been extremely disappointing.

This recipe turned out amazing. The only changes I made was instead of using the Dried Ancho Chile and the water, I used only the chipotles and substituted in a dark beer. YUM! Served it w/ creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. There were no left overs!

this came out great and we eat short ribs a lot. I made with only 2 lbs ribs and used 3 cloves of garlic and a medium onion. I did have to add more liquid after 90 mins and again an hour later. We served it on cruchy potatoes.

We made this for Passover Seder, and it got rave reviews from picky family members. The gravy is fantastic over potato kugel, and only bones came back to the kitchen. While mixing & cooking, the spice blend smelled quite strong, but all the chile mellowed. It was tangy and flavorful, but there wasn't any heat to scare away the delicate palates in the group. Variations as follows: Substituted ancho chile powder and beef broth, to save time. (Didn't really measure, but appx 1 Tbl per pound) Added some New Mexico Chile powder for fun. Added much more coffee to the liquid. Browned the ribs in a dry pan at 450 for 1 hour, instead of browning on the stove. Braised at 250 for 4 hours & refrigerated overnight. Skimmed off a ton of fat & reheated at 300 the following evening. An easy recipe. Would do this again.

I made this twice...first time following the recipe exactly including preparing a day in advance. I found the flavor good but wanting so I added a stick of cinnamon when I reheated it and the result was fabulous. The second time I made it with country style pork (no bone), this time adding some chuncks of orange zest upon reheating. The pork version was lighter and delicious.

I tripled the maple syrup and was glad I did; doubled the coffee and that was good too. I added half again more chipotle and I think it's a little too hot. I cooked it for 8 hours in a slow cooker on low and the meat is perfect. It's missing something, though, I think it's what the port/red wine adds in other short rib recipes. Next time I'll try sweet vermouth instead of the maple.

I was far from ancho chiles when I made this recipe and had to make it without the anchos, but with everything else. It was still so delicious I had to make it twice!

OK, I reviewed this once before, but I have to update. One day we were at our local cheap-o supermarket and they had chuck roast on sale. We bought a huge one (I think it was only $4 or something) and cooked it using this recipe. It's an *excellent* recipe to use for braising a chuck roast and much less expensive. Totally worth a try. We ended up with lots of extra sauce which we then used as a soup base for a sweet potato soup we're inventing, but that's a different story.

Fantastic! I have been looking for a rib recipe that would be easily made sugar-free, and this one is a real winner. I used only 4 lbs of ribs, added a couple of guajillo chiles and a pasilla chile for extra depth of flavor, and subbed a bit of splenda for the maple syrup to cut down the sugar. I made these a day early, and as other reviewers noted, they did get a little dry during the cooking process, so I added about 2 cups of beef stock. I refrigerated overnight and then removed the congealed fat (this step is a must), and added maybe another cup or so of stock to the pot before reheating, which gave me plenty of luscious sauce (the extra chiles helped bulk it up, no doubt - those who feel there is not enough sauce are probably using ancho powder instead of dried chiles). 3 of us ate ALL of the ribs in a sitting, but there was quite a bit of sauce leftover, so I used that on some pork ribs a few nights later - OMG, it was better than BBQ! Absolutely a winner!

We LOVE these short ribs - absolutely the best! The flavor is just perfect as is. Along with others, used powdered Ancho Chiles - about 3 Tbsp. Reading about the concern about drying out, I have always foiled the pan six ways to Sunday - never a problem - always plenty of sauce.

Made this twice, cuz the first time was SO delicious! However, the second time didn't turn out so well, so I had to dig through my brain cells to remember what I might have done differently. I seem to recall I had marinated in soy sauce, which added flavor to the meat, and added 3-5 guajillos to deepen the flavor.

Pretty good. I didn't have any issues with them drying out, but the sauce was just nice, not great. I'm not sure if I'll try this one again - most likely I'll try something else.

Made this exactly as written and served with Baked Cheese Grits. I made the ribs one day in advance to marry the flavors. Absolutely fantastic and a wonderful entree for a dinner party. Everyone scraped their plates.

This dish is spectacular. We make it with less meat than is called for, since short ribs are expensive. That works perfectly, though, because it generates extra sauce. We serve it with mashed potatoes, which work really well to soak up some of the sauce. Seriously, my mouth is watering just thinking about these right now!

This is an outstanding dish. I opted for the ancho chile powder rather than the dried chiles (couldn't locate) and used low sodium beef broth for the chile water. Cooked it a day ahead and removed all the congealed fat before reheating. Delish!

After skimming the fat, I like to thicken the sauce slightly with Wondra. Fantastic flavors. A definite favorite of my clients.

Amazing! Full of flavor -- rich, not overly spicy. Couldn't find dried chiles - used powdered ancho chiles (1 Tbsp per lb of meat), turned out just great. Can't wait to make this again!

These were delicious! I couldn't find chipotles in adobo sauce at my grocery store, so I substituted dried chipotles and stand alone adobo sauce (which they did have, go figure). I also followed the recommendations to add more liquid and to let them rest a night before eating. I thought the sauce had a wonderful balance of flavors. Next time I'm going to try it with beef cheeks and see how they come out.

Good but great as is. To be fair, I froze some of these for a few weeks and the flavor was better the next time. However, I made these as is, and found that I wanted more coffee flavor and more of the maple syrup. I will try again with these modifications. I think if you get this dish right it will be amazing.

Would give it 3.5 forks if that were possible. Very good. Used four pounds of ribs but the same amount of other ingredients in the sauce, and the ribs didn't dry out at all. They definitely taste better after a day or two and it's easy to remove all the congealed fat after they sit in the fridge.

Ribs were amazing! Used pasillos instead of anchos, and a red onion. Also, based on a lot of the comments, added some hot vegetable stock half way through.

Fantastic...ribs were perfect! To those of you where it was dried out, make sure the ribs are covered half way. I also added some vegeteble stock half way though the cooking time...great recipe!

Have now made this recipe 3 times without any results less than spectacular. For those who have trouble with drying out, how shallow is your roasting pan? You may need less surface area exposed.

Made this last night, following directions exactly, and had no problem with sauce and ribs drying out (I used a Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid). However, while the boneless short ribs were tender, I found the sauce to be utterly one-dimensional in flavor. It was spicy but flat tasting. When I reheated the leftovers tonight I added about 1/2 cup tomato-based chili sauce (in the catsup department) to the rib sauce and that provided the necessary sweetness (sugar) and acidity (vinegar) to fix the sauce and counteract the heat. The original amounts of lime juice and maple syrup were utterly lost in the sauce the first time -- no trace of sweetness or acidity was detectable. This revamped sauce made the ribs much more enjoyable. Tasty with sour cream mashed potatoes...

We loved the flavors in this recipe. Please note that for us, it was necessary to add water during the cooking to avoid drying out and burning.

Made this just as the recipe is written. Everyone loved it, even my young children. I would recommend making it a day ahead and chilling it in order to get rid of some of the fat. For the cook from San Francisco, did you make sure you covered it with a tight seal of aluminum foil?

Just made this two days ago and ate it last night--delicious! I used boneless short ribs (bought 4 lbs. instead of 6 at the suggestion of the meat counter). Reduced mess and much less fatty.

I've been looking back over this recipe to find out what I did wrong since everyone else seemed to love this. After two hours of baking in the oven at 350, the sauce was all dried up and the ribs were burnt. What happened?

Wow this is absolutely fantastic, the flavors just jump out and grab your tongue!

This was fantastic. The smoky flavor of the anchos and chipotles and the tenderness of the meat was amazing. I left out the maple syrup to avoid some of the sugar, but even without it, it had a deep and very good flavor. I served it with a green salad and broccoli.

These ribs are "good eats"! I made a combination of beef and pork ribs. The level of heat is just right. As suggested, I served them with soft polenta, broccoli slaw and a nice Cabernet. Next time I will make a double batch of the braising ingrediants and reduce to make a dipping sauce.
