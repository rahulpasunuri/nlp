This was amazing! I changed the recipe to make it healthier though. Instead of sugar I used 1 1/2 Tbsp agave syurp, and I used whole wheat flour. The salsa seemed like it would be bland, so I added the juice of 1 lime and some jalapeno slices. I also used rice vinegar, because that's what I have on hand. It was so good.

As one reviewer recommended, I added chili powder to the pineapple salsa and was very pleased with the results. Easy to make, but, as with many things that require dredging, it's a little heavy on the clean up.

Great recipe. Substituted brown sugar for sugar and added chili powder to the salsa, came out great. Garnished with shallots and red bell pepper(bell pepper really added a good flavor combo) for color contrast.

I loved this. I made it as is, with fresh pineapple. I thought the panko breading was nice & crunchy, leaving the pork moist, & then the pineapple salsa was a nice refreshing touch. The salsa wasn't too sweet. I thought it was a nice balance. It was easy to make & so good. There were a lot of breading ingredients leftover. The amount of panko & flour listed is more than plenty. I will definitely make this again!

I thought this was great. I added a little bit of chopped hot pepper to the salsa and it gave it a little bit of heat and a pretty color contrast (I used a red "fish" pepper.) This recipe was easy too! Oh yes, I used fresh pineapple - no problem.

i made my ginger/pineapple salsa with fresh pineapple. i added red onions, fresh ginger and a nectarine. i am not rating this recipe as mine is so different but i think those who used canned pineapple do not end up with a true salsa.

Like others, I used canned crushed in juice in place of fresh which was just too expensive this week. Perhaps it would be better with fresh pineapple. The salsa didn't do much for me but I thought the chops were great.

My kids and I just made it for dinner as a last minute meal. So easy to make and so good. We didn't do the pineapple and ginger salsa and my kids loved it.

Easy, tasty, and versatile recipe. I took a shortcut and used canned pineapple chunks (packed in their own juices, not in syrup), drained, and it worked great. I had a mango in the fridge, so I cubed it up as well and it played well with the pineapple. I may sub brown sugar next time just to play around with it. For a little extra color and a nice contrasting flavor, top the fruit with some chopped scallions.

I had this last night and was not at all impressed by it. It was not very flavorful. The pineapple just doesn't give it enough bam!

So Easy and So Good! Using canned, crushed pineapple works well. Use juice instead of water and cut sugar. The pinch of cayenne is a nice touch.

This turned out really fantastic. I actually used fresh, underriped pineapple which turned out to carmelize perfectly in the salsa. I also added mirin to the salsa but left out the sugar. And I think I threw some orange peel into the mix. I also used a mix of peanut and olive oil to cook this. It really turned out fantastic. Will make again and again.

This was quick and easy for a weeknight. We used canned pineapple as well and it worked fine - didn't add any extra water or sugar. We added some grape tomatoes for some extra colour and served over rice with carrots and snow peas

This is very good and extremely easy. I made the salsa using canned pineapple and I thought it was great. My husband and I agree that next time I should use crushed pineapple instead of chunks. I wil also use the juice instead of water and cut the sugar in half. I added a pinch of cayenne to the salsa and will do it again.

This was very good. The breading keeps the pork moist. The salsa is good but since we don't like sweet sauces with our meat, we did not really care for it. Next time I will just do the meat.

I used thin sliced pork chops and trimmed the fat. As usual, there was way too much breading leftover! Always happens when something is to be breaded. A very nice recipe. I admit that I was rushed and didn't make the actual salsa, but instead just dumped a can of pineapple tidbits in a saucepan with chopped cilantro, ground ginger (didn't have any fresh) and white vinegar. It did in a pinch, to give the nice flavor, but I'm sure the salsa would be much better.
