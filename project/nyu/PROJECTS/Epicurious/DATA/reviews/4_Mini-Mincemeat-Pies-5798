I used my own recipe mincemeat instead of purchased with this recipe and they were delicious. Great crust (even the batch where I forgot the egg yolk). Served with brandy butter, they were a hit.

My husband is from England, so we make Mincemeat pies every year. This is the first time that we have used this recipe. We will be using it again and again and again. I did add more mincemeat (1 cup total) because it did not fill all of the pies. I used a 12 muffin pan and it was just enough dough to fill it. I don't know how I could have gotten 18 as the recipe indicates. The crystallized ginger makes these pies GREAT!

Fabulous Crust...seriously! I rolled it thin & made tarts in 4" pans...it made enough for 4, plus cutting out stars to place on top. In fact, I made 2 additional tart shells with the leftovers and, after baking them, ended up eatting them without any filling...that good!! To the filling, I added brandy to taste and toasted, chopped pecans. I think the filling would have been a lot better if I had used a different brand of mincemeat..should have used the inexpensive 1 found in most supermarkets. As it was, it was too sweet for me.

Wow! These are the best mincemeat tarts I have ever had. The orange peel and juice in the crust put these over the top. Love the ginger in the mincemeat. I didn't put them in the mini muffin tins, just layed the rounds of dough on a cookie sheet, added the mincemeat to each one, dampened the edge of the pie crust and topped with another round. Crimped the edges and cut "x" in top. Perfect!

My sister loves these, but sometimes I put sharp cheddar cheese in the crust, then I love them.

Excellent recipe. Simple to prepare and I usually have these ingredients on hand (well mincemeat being the exception). Turned out perfectly! Making them again for a holiday dinner party tonight.

These were a huge hit at our Thanksgiving celebration. I made them exactly as directed and they were perfect. The ratio of crust to filling was perfect and they came out of the pan very easily.

I made these For Thanksgiving and were a HUGE hit. We used clemintines instead of orange and that added a sweet tartness that complemented the mince more than the orange did. I would also recomend throwing in a TINY amount of sugar to the mince.

Tarts came out just right. They're a bit smaller in size than I would have them, but that's easily remedied. They were delicious and quick to make.

fab fab fab! I love these - they are my new fave. (and of all who had them!) I added Cointreau to the fruit mince instead of brandy - just to continue the citrus feel. mmmmmm hard sauce is wonderful with them warm.

Yummy. I make these every year for my British husband and other fellow Brits. Was surprised last year when I took them to a party and Americans loved them too. With or without the extra orange and ginger in the mincemeat these are great and everyone wants more. You won't be able to make just one batch.

I have made these for 3 holidays in a row, and I'll make them again next year. I send them to friends and family who live far away, and they look forward to them receiving them every year. (I always hold a few back for myself to enjoy, too!)

Wonderful! Made these for my husband who is from England and he loved them. Next time I would probably not use as much orange peel as the recipe recommends - it was a bit too much.

Absolutely wonderful!
