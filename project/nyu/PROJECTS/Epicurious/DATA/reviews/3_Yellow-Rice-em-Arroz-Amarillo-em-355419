Salt is the flavor boost that is lacking. I also like garlic so i add in an extra few cloves. However i throw in whole not chopped, just smooshed with a quick pound from the flat part of knife. And another preference of mine, i'm not really a green pepper kind of girl, so i substitute in carrots. A delicious latin american rice dish. many countries do not like hot spices (colombia for one) so adding in hot chilis is a personal preference (as per one reviewer). But most importantly, it's the salt this recipe forgot to mention. Don't be scared of a little sodium people! It really enhances the flavor.

I used this recipe to accompany a fiery hot Jamaican style chicken. While I can see how it would be a little bland or underwhelming by itself it makes a great accompaniment to something hot. It has a mild, yet definitive flavor and I'll make it again.

I agree with the last reviewer, not enough flavor, especially given it's a Latin dish. Next time I'll add a hot chili and some pine nuts. BTW, Annatto is also known as achiote in Latin markets.

It was good, but not as good as I hoped. Lacked seasoning. My husband liked it, but also thought it could have been more flavorful.
