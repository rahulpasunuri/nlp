This a favorite with our family. Like many others, I don't actually make the mousse, but blend the peppers etc. and just and top each bowl with a tablespoon or so of the mixture. Usually use homemade chicken broth for all the liquid. Great recipe.

This was awesome. I used our jack o lantern pumpkin (only 1 day old, we were late this year), and made a few modifications based on what I had on hand. I didn't make the mousse because I didn't have heavy cream, but instead blended half and half with the called-for ingredients and added the creamy mixture to the soup at the end. I roasted my own red peppers and the pumpkin, which I think added great flavor. I also added a bit of red pepper flakes to the sauteed veg for a little kick. I didn't have sherry vinegar, so I just used apple cider, and finally, I used straight chicken broth instead of diluting it with water. I think I did up the spices bit to taste. Really yummy, makes me want to buy pumpkins more often!

Delicious! I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the spices and added a cinnamon stick, both great tips. Also, I omitted the water and only used the 5 cups of chicken broth. I made this ahead of time and froze it. When I reheated it, I added another 1/2 cup of chicken broth, to thin it slightly, and you could add more broth, as opposed to water, if you prefer it thinner. For the mousse, I also skipped the gelatin step. I made the mousse the day I served the soup, and it held up well in the refrigerator for leftovers the next day. All in all a very pretty, flavorful soup!

This was a hearty, tasty soup, with the following simplifications. I roasted my red peppers, omitted the gelatin, hot paprika and water from the mousse. I cut the carrots, onion and pumpkin into large pieces, stuck them all in the oven at the same time, when soft enough to pierce, I put them in a pot with the roasted the garlic and remaining ingredients, then pureed with a wand. Quite easy and it eliminates most of the stove top work.

This was excellent - the whole family enjoyed. I eliminated the water, used regular chicken boullion, doubled the spices and added a cinnamon stick. All in all the dish is subtle and elegant. I will serve it to guests.

Really good. Didn't use gelatin. Fantastic and easy. To give depth to the pumpkin soup I added a rind of parmasean the removed it before pureeing. Second time making this and it is once again a triumph!

I would recommend doubling the amount of spices added to this (at least), and I threw in a stick of cinnamon. Also, I am not sure about the water. I skipped that, and the amount of broth (the 5 cups of chicken stock) seemed appropriate. The mouse was also really great even without the gelatin (didn't have it on hand). I roasted the peppers myself as recommended by another reviewer. Also, I was almost scared off of this recipe, because of complaints of this being so complicated and flavorless. I didn't find it to be complicated or a lot of work at all (what did I miss?), and everyone loved it (with the doubled spices). I think it would have been pretty flavorless without the doubled spices and a nice sugar pumpkin in the fall/winter.

my partner left out the gelatin in the mousse and it still came out fluffy. soup and mousse were delicious.

Can you say complex, and complicated? This sounds devine, however you need a staff of 4 or at least 12 arms and hands to complete this process....there has to be a simpler way.

Not enough pumpkin flavour for me. I looked up another recipe which recomended roasting the pumkin prior which I think would kick it up a notch. Otherwise just so so. The red pepper mouse is great and helped out a lot.

I made this using a pie pumpkin, which was suprisingly hard to find in Seattle in the fall. Just in case, I also added a can of pumpkin to ensure I had enough flavour. I thought the mousse was great, though it was recieved by my guests with mixed responses. Some loved it and added more, others scooped it off. Either way, this was a fun recipe and I loved the colour and taste of it.

I forgot to add, this recipe took me longer than one hour. I think you should add an extra half hour at least for cutting up the pumpkin.

I made this and loved it, though my kids were not as big of fans. They prefer the Butternut Squash soup. I made the soup just as the recipe said - with real pumpkin. I really liked the flavor. I think you have to have the right pumpkin (I used a local organic smaller pumpkin that I was told was good for eating). The carrots balanced out the flavor well I thought, so the pumpkin taste was smooth and not too strong. The only thing I changed about the mousse was I roasted my own peppers. As another reviewer, I also do not like the taste of jarred ones. I think they have a funny aftertaste. I roasted two whole peppers in the oven (brushed with olive oil and put in for about 35 minutes at 375) and it tasted great. The mousse was not as red and bold as I had hoped. It looked kind of like a light red whipped cream, with inconsistent color, but maybe I didn't substitute in enough peppers? I might add another half next time to see. The mousse and soup kept very well in the fridge and the soup reheated well. I think you could make both ahead of time for company with no problems. Both lasted for leftovers 3 days in the fridge. I'd make it again!

I use the butternut squash that is called for and then add a can of pumpkin and have had raves.

I give this a 3.5 fork rating. I made this soup a few days ago, tweaked it a bit then served it a the first course for dinner last night. This was followed by potatoes gratinee, roasted green beans and shallots and 2 inch thick lamb chops with a Dijon mustard/herbes du Provence, fresh rosemary, garlic, dash of red wine and balsamic vinegar spread, then BBQ'd. The soup was a huge hit! However, like most I made a few changes: added about 4 cups of carrots, used canned pumpkin along with one roasted acorn squash and added about a 1/4 cup maple syrup as I found the soup needed a bit of sweetness. The maple syrup was the perfect addition. Loved the red pepper mousse, definitely added a dynamic flavour contrast. I served a slightly fruity Washington Stated Reisling with this soup, perfect match. I will definitely make this again and our dinner guests, who are total foodies like I am, asked for the recipe as well.

I served this to guests last night and they all loved it. The mousse was especially good. I didn't know what "hot smoked paprika" meant, maybe just the normal paprika in my spice rack? Anyway, I used McCormick ground Ancho Chili Pepper instead. As for the soup, the lady at the farmer's market saved me from buying the big orange jack-o-lantern pumpkin and sold me the traditional pie pumpkin instead -- it's tan colored, like a butternut, only bigger and more pumpkin-shaped. I'm told it has more flavor than Big Orange. The soup was real good!

I have just made this and have to agree with the reviewer from Paris.... I am also in Paris and used a native pumpkin type squash available here and not Butternut....it may be the reason for it lacking in flavor. I will try again with Butternut and hope for better results. I will try to spice it up and cook a little longer as one reviewer suggested.

This fall I've been trying all sorts of winter squashes and I tried this soup with some odd-shaped squash I bought. If turned out great and we all loved the taste of cumin in the soup. Must be served extremely hot... Enjoy!

I found this soupe to be extremely bland and had to raid the fridge to find things to put in it to spruce it up and give it some flavour. The colour is beautiful as is the red pepper mousse but the taste of tinned pepper really bugs me I will probably try next time with real peppers.

I added an extra onion, some broccoli, threw in a head of garlic - sprinkled some paprika on top. Fantastic. The mousse is key, the colors and tastes are very complementary.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving. The looks from the guests (it was very non- traditional) before they tasted it were anything but reassuring. Once they tried it they all thought it was great and they want it as the "new" tradition. The Mousse is the key to the dish and when I make it again I will make a double portion of the Mousse. It is one of the easiest soups to make and comes across

I used butternut squash and added more garlic and added thyme-thought it needed more savory flavor. The red pepper mousse was too much work-I just pureed a jar of the peppers and swirled some red pepper mixture and a teaspoon of cream on top of each bowl for flavor and color. I served the soup with a toasted parmesan crostini as an appetizer.

Relatively easy to prepare, and very tasty. Went over very well for Thanksgiving dinner!

This is GREAT soup. I used butternut squash. I served it as the first course of our Thanksgiving dinner, along with a spinach salad. The mousse adds just enough hotness to the sweetmess of the soup. And the presentation is fabulous. This is definately in my collection of recipes to make again, and again and again......

This was great. The mousse adds a nice flair. I used Hungarian paprika and added a couple of drops of Tabasco sauce. Used cream I'd already whipped with just a touch of honey in it -- nice addition but not at all obvious. Used butternut and acorn squash, fresh, and homemade chicken stock. Liked the fact that there was no cream in the soup -- served it for Thanksgiving; there's so much to eat as it is. Recipe provided 14 portions as a first course.

Absolutely fantastic soup. Was the shocker of thanksgiving dinner with how good it was an unexpected twist to an otherwise traditional dinner. Made for an amazing asthetic presentation as well served in black dishes. Prepared the night before and heated while finishing the dinner. Came out wonderfully and reheats beautifully as a leftover. I used butternut squash and it has a wonderful flavor!

The mousse did not really gel for me, and next time I don't think I'll even bother with the powdered gelatin. The soup was good, but the addition of red pepper puree made it really delicious. I also added chipotle pepper, about 1/8 tsp. instead of smokey paprika.

I made this for Thanksgiving and what rave reviews! I too used canned pumpkin. I added it after cooking the other veggies so the flavors would incorporate. I was in a serious time crunch and skipped the mousse, but I'm anxious to try it. One last thing: we had leftover peeled & cored granny smith apples -about 1 1/4 apples, so I added those, and it turned out wonderfully (apologies for "messing with" the recipe as given, but I'm like that!). Absolutely will make this again, with mousse. Want to try it with butternut squash.

This was very easy to make and it came out well. I used my hand blender to puree the squash, and the red peppers, which worked very well. Cutting up pumpkin is a bit labor intensive, so next time I may just do the canned pumpkin thing. Other that that, super soup!

Everyone loved the red pepper mousse. Very easy to make (I used butternut squash), very tasty and looked beautiful.

I made this soup for our Thanksgiving dinner and a new tradition has begun (it was such a hit). Dare I reveal a little secret that may offend the author of this beautiful recipe? I used canned pumpkin to expedite the preparation (so much to do, so many dishes), and it was still wonderful!! One change...I cooked the already processed soup on a low flame for a few hours before serving and it really brought the flavors together.

I very much enjoyed this soup. I also added a little cream to this to make it a little smoother. I made the mousse with mexi-bell peppers that I grew. They added a little heat and made this already wonderful soup jump to the next level!!!

Oh wow! This soup is delightful! I didnt bother to make the mousse (the gorgeous orange soup was perfect without it) just decorated with some cream for an amazing starter! I used a Hokkien squash (similar to a butternut) as that was all that was available.
