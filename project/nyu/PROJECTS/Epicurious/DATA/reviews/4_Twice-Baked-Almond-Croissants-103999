I adapted this recipe slightly with a few tweaks here and there, and made twice-baked chocolate and pistachio croissants using up croissants I had baked myself from scratch at home. They turned out absolutely delicious and I would thoroughly recommend them. Amazing! http://www.cupofteasolveseverything.com/2013/03/croissants-part-ii-pain-au-chocolat-aux.html

This is the first review I've written although I read them all the time! These were so yummy I had to write. One of my brunch guests said her "taste buds were dancing"! I made the vanilla syrup several days in advance, and left the split bean in it to steep the whole time, which really brought out the vanilla flavor. I added the orange juice just before using. This is WAY too much syrup for this recipe, so you could cut the amount down, but the leftover is good in other stuff. I used smaller cocktail sized croissants, and got 12 from this amount of filling. I assembled them completely 2 days before and stored them in the freezer. I thawed them for a few hours before my brunch guests arrived, then baked them to be still a little warm when served. One note, I didn't toast the sliced almonds in advance because I was afraid they would get too brown when baking. I covered the croissants for the first half of the baking, then uncovered to brown the almonds. They were perfect, golden brown and not dry, absolutely delish. Make these--you will WOW somebody! (Next time I will try substituting more almond paste for the ground almonds and sugar in the filling. You grind them into almond paste anyway, and it would be easier.)

I LOVE almond croissants and have had my share of Really good ones and really bad ones. This recipe makes a pretty good almond croissant, better than some bakeries. It's not very difficult to make but a little involved. I used trader joe's frozen mini croissants which I made a day before. I made the syrup and cream the day before and assembled/baked the next morning. They were crispy and delicious with great almond flavor. I would put more filling in each croissant though. It's a definite keeper and would be perfect to serve for guests since they look so nice.

These were delish!! I've had this pastry in several bakeries in town which use brioche instead of croissants calling it Bostock. So, I used brioche for this recipe and it tasted just as good as those in the bakeries. Such a quick and delicious breakfast - just make the syrup and almond cream the night before and in the morning, it'll only take you five minutes to assemble.

THis was really good! The filling was great. THe glaze really complimented the filling! I made them for brunch, served them warm. They were equally good at room temp.

Made these for my mom's surprise birthday tea party. They were delicious and fairly easy to make. Be generous with the syrup, i used less than half and the orange flavor was very faint. All in all these were wonderful.

These were great. Either my croissants weren't stale enough or I used too much syrup, because they were a little soggy in the center the first time I made them. Since I only made 5, I had filling left over and froze it. When I used it up, I dried out the croissants a bit in a warm oven first. Fantastic! The flavor is really wonderful and they are easy to make.

I loved these! They look great, taste wonderful and are really fun to make. Plus you feel like a real pastry chef serving them. Think I'll try with pure vanilla extract next time, rather than purchasing the expensive bean. A double batch of syrup and almond cream worked for 30 mini croissants (3 in) which made the perfect serving portion. Try them; you won't be disappointed! I did try these with pure vanilla extract rather than the bean............it might just have been in my head, but I didn't think they were quite as good. Will use the beans in the future.

Exceptional way to use day old croissants!!! I've also made the almond cream and topped my sweet bread rolls before baking and we can't get enough. I haven't met anyone who did not LOVE them.
