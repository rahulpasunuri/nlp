I've used this recipe twice for my pumpkin pies and I just use all butter for simplicity & convenience. The texture is delicate and VERY flaky on the edges, but the bottom holds up well to the filling after baking. I like that it's a recipe for one pie as I haven't yet needed to make 2 pies at a time. It's SOOO simple. But the tricky part is that the dough gets soft and difficult to handle after rolling out. So, I stick it back in the freezer (after it's rolled out flat) before I lay it out on the pie pan. This makes it easier for me to handle it to make the decorative edges.

Good crust recipe for a quick single crust. I added a teaspoon of cider vinegar. Fairly easy to roll out.

I have been making pie crusts for years, and this is far and away the best I have tried! My husband loved it.

Absolutely love this recipe. I don't use trans fatty acids (Crisco) so I just substituted butter for the vegetable shortening and it was wonderful. I use this in all my recipes for pies and omit the sugar for quiche recipes.

I think I just found the perfect pie crust recipe! I love to bake but have never been really happy with any of my crust recipes. This is so flaky and delicious you could eat it on its own. Wow. Definitely a winner!

Easy to prepare and roll out. Flaky, too. I had been using the prepared refrigerator pie crusts, but using this recipe, homemake is not a hassle.

I'm not a great pie maker but have made many pies throughout the years. I'm always searching for the perfect pie crust and I think I've found it! I used butter-flavored Crisco for the vegetable shortening, which I froze. I also froze the butter for a short time and made sure the water was very cold. I rolled the pie crust out on Saran Wrap, which I find easier to do than just rolling it out on the counter (this way transferring the pie crust to the pie plate is easy). I didn't add all the water called for and was afraid that I even added too much water, but the crust came out deliciously flavored and very flaky. Excellent recipe!

I made this crust with the "Pumpkin Spice Pie" on this website - I threw out the filling and just ate the crust. Good easy crust, and was nice and crunchy without having to blind-bake.

I love this crust! Flaky with just a touch of sweetness...goes great with any dessert pie.

I think using pastry flour would make this crust perfect.

I was very disappointed with this pie crust. It was difficult to roll out and wasn't as flaky as other crusts I've made. I doubled the recipe and didn't use a food processor.

A great basic pie crust. I try to avoid vegetable shortening as much as possible but an all butter crust is a little heavy. This one with just 2 T of shortening is perfect.

Easy to handle when rolling and very easy to make with a food processor. This crust is flaky and full of flavor. This one is truly a winner!

The easiest and best pie crust I've ever attempted.

Not bad. I usually use Martha Stewart's recipe for pie crust which actually works really well. I did make this crust and it was very flaky. I had a little bit of a hard time keeping it from breaking apart when rolling after I refrigerated it for a day. The ones that ate the crust said that it was better than Martha Stewart's so I will make it again. It's a keeper. Will use this recipe for crust till another one better comes along...

I followed the recipe exactly but do not feel like I had enough dough for a 9 inch pie plate. First time I have made a crust from scratch - very discouraging.

This is now my basic pie crust recipe. I usually make six crusts at a time and then freeze what I don't use. Also, you can definitely work with it better when it has been in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.

Just finished baking this crust for a lemon meringue pie. Rolling it out was a breeze, baked up beautifully. Will use this for my basic recipe from now on.

This is an excellent basic pie crust recipe. I used a pastry cutter, and it turned out fine.

This is absolutely the best recipe for a one-crust pie. I've made it again and again. It's wonderful for making a decorative fluting, leaf cut-outs, etc. And it couldn't be easier. Over the years I've tried many recipes for one-crust pies; this one, by far, is superior. Works well for double crust pies, too!

You need not look further in your quest for the perfect pie crust! I am delighted to report that my apple pie bakes as I type these words. This was my second attempt at pie crust and it was a pleasure to make, roll and taste. I just adore epicurious.com and hope you enjoy this recipe.

This year I switched to this recipe for my pies. It's excellent. Very flaky and buttery. I will use this one from now on......try it, you cant go wrong.

This was the best crust recipe ever. The amount of butter it calls for may seem like a lot but it makes it really good.

Could this get any easier??? I was initially daunted by this recipe after reading previous reviews and the problems they had with rolling out the pastry. Throw the pastry in the freezer for 15min and roll out between waxed paper (lightly floured).... it worked like a charm. Very flaky and flavourful.

This really is the best pastry crust I've ever made. It can be used for all types of pies, whether they're sweet or savory. This one will become a family tradition.

This really is the best pie crust recipe I've ever made! Using more butter than shortening is the key. When I bake pies at Thanksgiving, everyone insists on having seconds and thirds! Also, you don't need to use a food processor. Use a pastry cutter and fork and process by hand. It works!
