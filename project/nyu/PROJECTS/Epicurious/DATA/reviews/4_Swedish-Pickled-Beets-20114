These are excellent and so easy to prepare. I used small beets from the local farmers market, chopped off all but 1 inch of stem and root, washed them, and boiled the beets in a covered pan with salted water 35 to 50 minutes. When the beets are done and cooled a little, they just slip out of their skins. To minimize clean-up, I used the same pan to prepare the vinegar/water mixture to put on the beets. I've made these twice and love to keep a jar in the refrigerator to add to salads.

What is shelf life? Can they be canned in water bath?

Delicious and very simple to make. I used fresh beets from our Lancaster Dutch market. Did not get them started the night before, but made them in the morning and let them sit in the fridge until dinner time. Results were excellent.

Simple, perfect. I added thinly sliced onions to the already boiled and sliced beets. Delicious!

I keep a big jar in the frig nearly all the time, using 4 cans of canned beets, 2X other ingredients. Nice to have on hand for whenever ...
