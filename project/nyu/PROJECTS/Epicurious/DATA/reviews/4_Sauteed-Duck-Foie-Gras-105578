I make no apology for being born on top of the food chain. This was simple and delicious. Added a poached pear and paired with sauterne for him, ice wine for me. Yum!

NO ONE should be using foie gras in any recipes in a humane society. The force feeding of ducks and geese is unforgiveable abuse. It should never be encouraged or condoned.

Wow - really great. Be sure the foie gras is at room temperature. Mine wasn't and I was so worried that I'd overcook it, initially it was underdone. I also tossed it in a bit of flour (good idea). I added an equal amount of port wine to the balsamic and served w/brioche toast & saute'd pears. Really yummy

Oustanding! We served the foie with a mache salad, toasts and a single, fresh, ripe, and tiny Fiorelle pear. The presentation was outstanding! Guests were provided with a sharp knife to slice a bit of pear and to slather on the foie. yummy.

Simple and delicious preparation of foie gras with some minor adjustments as follows: I sauteed the foie gras in clarified butter rather than canola oil. I added 2 tbsp. port along with the balsamic vineger and finished the sauce by whisking in softened butter. I served the foie gras with sauteed pears as I like the combination of foie gras and fruit. I served this to teenage boys who had never tried foie gras and they devoured it!

We had never cooked foie gras before and this turned out beautifully! After we bought the foie gras, we decided to make it for Christmas Eve Dinner and Christmas Day lunch. By making it twice, we came to the conclusion that more flour is better (it does start to melt if you only do a light dusting of flour), and it browns better in a pan that isn't a non-stick. This was great fun, and anyone who likes foie gras (and how could one not?) will love it!

Incredibly simple and flavorful, and very impressive. A very good dish for a special event.

I'm not a chef, and I've always been intimidated by foie gras - so many things can go wrong. Nevertheless, I had no trouble following these directions. My wife and I agreed that this was the best foie gras we ever had.

We have always loved foie gras and have had difficulty in finding it when dining out. I took my chances with this recipe after reading all the positive reviews, I agree with them all! It's easy and fabulous! I served it on a bed of greens, with a sliced sauteed pear and enjoyed the flavors immensely!

Made this for New Year's Eve and it was fabulous. I also sauteed a ripe pear in a bit of butter & set it aside, then dusted the fois gras with flour & sauteed it in a well-heated pan. I drained off a bit of the grease (which is great saved & used for scrambled eggs, etc.) then added several Tbs. of tangerine/fig balsamic vinegar. I drizzled this over spring greens, the pear and the fois gras. It was a great first course!

The French have it right. The simplier the better and this recipe is a perfect example. I followed another cook's suggestion and lightly dusted the fois gras in flour before sauting it. A pear was carmelized before the fois gras and just as fois gras finished we placed the pear slices back in the pan to absorb the flavors of the fois gras. Afterwards the fois gras was arranged and served on top of the pears. This was decandent and wonderful.

I made this dish as an appetizer for Christmas Eve. It was to die for. I used a fig balsamic vinegar & a star shaped slice of beauregard sweet potatoe baked in orange juice & pure maple sugar. I then sauteed it briefly at the end & drizzled it too with the fig balsamic vinegar. I also had some apple slices seared in butter & flamed with a bit of apple brandy. I served a beautiful Sauternes with it. Simply put, it was a huge success! ALso paired it off with a brined pork tenderloin with fig & ginger marmelade, garlic/lemon rainbow chard & creamy cheesy grits. Outstanding.

I love Foie Gras. The simpler the better. Saute some pear along side. (Note to administrator: remove the comments by "cook" from Philadelphia.)

I used Goose Foie Gras.. and it was wonderful.. I spoke to the deli where I bought the fresh foie gras and he said very similar things... don't use butter or olive oil.. too strong in taste. Canola oil is perfect.. the slight sweetest of the balsamic vinegar is really great

First time was great but for New Year's Eve, am going over the top and placing this over a small Filet Mignon at the suggestion of our butcher. Should be just what we need prior to the annual diet!

In a time of culinary excess (vertical food, wasabi-coated skate in an ouzo/sake reduction ... you get the idea), it is wonderful to return to the delights of simple food. Foie gras is hardly peasant fare, but this recipe is easy, simple, and makes this dish a wonderful special treat for the holidays. Reviewer from Philly: stay home, and read Vegetarian Times. You don't deserve Gourmet.

This was an easy recipe! Foie gras seems so intimidating but this recipe erases that misunderstanding. I appreciate the London cook's suggestion of dusting lighting with flour. I must also say I DON'T appreciate the cook from Philadelphia's comment, as this forum is not the appropriate place to air your political views.

A question for anyone able to answer: would this recipe work with goose foies gras? I recently bought one in France and, frankly, haven't the foggiest idea of what to do with it.

Thanks so much to the skilled cook who suggested a dusting of flour. I think that really made a difference in color, and helped the foie gras hold its shape under fire. I'm not too sure about that balsamic vinegar sauce, it battles with the sauternes. Suggestion: go with a nice spatelese and save $10 on the wine. Next time, I'm going to try a pan reduction of chicken stock and the wine, just to get the sauce more in sync with the wine. Bless you, Hudson Valley for bringing us this great product.

Sauteed duck liver being my favorite dish, I have tried many recipes. I have made many mistakes and even though this recipe is good, I would suggest some changes from experience. Oil is absolutely not necessary as foie gras is already full fat almost like butter. You must dust lightly each pieces in flour, it will make the outside a bit crusty and will prevent the inside to spill and melt too fast. When done (30 sec each side) remove all fat and deglaze with balsamic vinegar. Have fun as this recipe is very easy to make.

Although I have eaten it, this is the first time that I have cooked foie gras. I was worried about it turning into a puddle of fat but found that it was a bit sturdier than I imagined. I used Sonoma Grade A. The first batch, I cut the slices a little wider than 1/2 inch and think that they were too thick. Although I changed the oil as suggested, next time I think I'll just keep going with the same oil. The oil seemed to absorb the salt and the foie gras required a little more after cooking. I really liked the balsamic sauce. Serve this with toasted baguette and a good Sauterne.
