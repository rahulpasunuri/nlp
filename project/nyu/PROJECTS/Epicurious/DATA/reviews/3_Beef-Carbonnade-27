This recipe needs some help. If you follow it as written you are not going to end up with the real deal. I worked in a Belgian restaurant for several years in another life and I had to do quite a bit of tinkering to get it to taste like I remembered. I used about 20 oz of Chimay Blue (you must use this beer or one very similar), added more thyme, an extra garlic clove, four bay leaves, and about 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar towards the end of cooking. I cooked it for 3 hours on high in a slow cooker and thickened it with flour - I'll cook it even longer next time to get the meat really tender. The biggest change is that you must caramelize the onions with brown sugar! I used about 4 tablespoons. So, extra thyme, extra garlic, extra beer, add brown sugar, add red wine vinegar, add bay leaves, and cook much longer!

I had Beef Carbonnade on a trip to Brussels on Sabena Airlines many years ago. It was plane food but delicious. I have been wanting to try it again. I used the recommendations from the reviewer from Kalamazoo and it was delicious. I made sure to use Belgian beer, two bottles. I also added in the fresh herbs and the vinegar. So very tasty!

The comments below on more herbs/spices are well-founded. I used fresh herbs in a sachet d'espice and seasoned to taste. You can use non-alcoholic dark beer with no discernable change in flavor. The tenderizing of the meat occurs because of the time cooked, not due to the alcohol's acidic effect. I recommend thoroughly drying the meat before flouring for two reasons, first, you won't have as much flour adhering to the meat, and you get a better browning effect, too. The more attention one pays to caramelizing the onions and the meat-browning step, the more flavorful this dish becomes.

This is a truely marve3lous party recipe. I have never had a less than favorable comment. It prepares well and keeps well. It is equally at home at a sit down or a buffet. I love the flavor and texture. This is a real keeper.

A Cook from Chicago is right. The whole flavor of this dish is determined by the beer you use. Using anything except a rich Belgian trippel for this is like making Boeuf Bourguignonne with water.

When this dish was finished, it had no flavor. By the time I was through with it (more garlic, thyme, beef base, pepper, even alittle ketchup) it bore no resemblance to the original recipe. Must be a better recipe out there. The meat came from Whole Foods, so was high in quality.

Great if a few changes are made. I also added the carmelized onions using brown sugar. I added an eights cup of Maggi beef seasoning and then slow cooked the meat after browing and scraping bits into sauce. If you have a slow cooker in the oven control, cook for 8 hours, or use a counter top slow cooker. The beef will be heavenly tender.

I made this, incorporating some of the changes suggested by earlier reviewers: I caramelized the onions in a dutch oven for about 25 minutes to a nice deep golden color (threw in the garlic for the last 5). I browned the meat in batches in another pan while doing this, then transferred it to the onion mixture (off heat) as I went. After the beef, I sauteed 4 slices of chopped bacon, drained and added that. I used about a tablespoon of chopped fresh thyme, a handful of chopped parsley, 2 bay leaves, and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. For the liquid, I deglazed the pot I cooked the onions in with a bottle of Sierra Nevada pale ale, and 2 cups of veal stock. I added three tablespoons of red wine vinegar toward the end (as well as salt and pepper). It took about 2.5 hours for the beef to get tender. I've never had the real thing in Belgium, so I have no basis for comparison, but everyone loved it.

I agree with the other reviews. Without the additional spices it would have been too bland. I added the red wine vinegar as suggested and Kosher Salt and Pepper.

Spare yourself on this recipe. It sucked. I made the mistake of making the original recipe and it was horrible. We ordered a pizza instead.

I would make it again , however I followed the kalamazoo lady's lead, since an authentic Belgian carbonnade always has brown sugar and vinegar and also bacon in it! I think the cook from Agoura CA may have used too good a cut of meat, this really requires a lesser cut that can stand the long cooking process. I used boneless chuck short ribs and left it in larger pieces. It also helps carmelize the onions if you throw some of the sugar in with them while they are cooking

No wonder y'all thought this was bland! Here's mine--it's foolproof, delicious. I have it in the oven right now. Trust me. Get 4 lb lean beef (English or arm roast), cubed & dredged in flour, 2 lbs onions sliced thick, crush 6-7 big cloves garlic, 3 tbsp brown sugar, 1/4 c. red wine vinegar, 1/2 c. parsley chopped, a big pinch of thyme, 2-3 bay leaves, 2 cans beef broth, and 2 bottles of beer. Brown the meat in oil. Put it in a Dutch oven. Brown the onions and garlic--brown them well. Put them in with the meat. Add the sugar, a few tsp of the vinegar, parsley, bay leaves, thyme, and broth. Stir and scrape to loosen fond. Add to Dutch oven and pour in the beers. Bake it 2 hours in a 325 oven. Let it set overnight in the fridge. Before serving add the rest of the vinegar & reheat. Serve over egg noodles. C'est bon.

I can't believe anyone thought this was bland! If you make sure the onions are really caramelized (not so much golden as nut brown) and (nothing against Guinness, I love it, but this is not an Irish recipe) use a Belgian Trappist or maybe Scotch ale, it has at least as much flavor as Boeuf Bourguignon.

This dish was bland, even though I doubled the thyme and used Guinness beer. The beef was mushy. There was way too much liquid for the amount of beef.

If I do this again, MORE THYME! Triple it! Cut down on the beef stock and add more dark beer.

i thought this was a pretty good dish, my boyfriend though loved it. i deglazed the pan that i browned the meat in and carmelized the onions in with the beef stock to get all of the yummy bits. i used stout and next time i'll probably just use a dark ale instead as i could taste a little of the bitterness. i crock potted it on high for about 5 hours and the meat was deliciously tender. Next time i will also serve it over steamed white rice, something needs to soak up the broth and the noodles didn't.

I made this pretty much as given, but braised it in the oven at 325F for about 3 hours. (I was using various cuts of beef from my freezer and some were not the tenderest.) I agree with other readers that this tastes best when allowed to sit overnight to let the flavours develop and is then reheated.

I am about to make this recipe for the second time, and I loved it the first time. I didn't add anything to the recipe, and actually I didn't even have thyme when I made it before. After reading the other reviews, I didn't eat any of it until it sat overnight, and the next day, it was fantastic. Also, I cooked it in a crock pot, and pretty much let it stew all day. Lots of time and Guinness beer made this dish great.

This has turned into one of my favorite stew recipes. Occasionally I will throw in some carrots for variety. I have kept it in the oven as long as 3 hours, and the flavors continue to deepen. I have found the sauce does need thickening or boiling down at the end, if you like your stew a little thicker.

I found a better recipe in the Dean & Deluca cookbook. It calls for more beer and prunes. It's absolutely delicious. I like to serve it with garlic mashed potatoes.

Wonderful! I served it with Colcannon. Great combination

I too made my ownn revisions to the recipe - I upped the thyme, added a little dark brown sugar, dijon mustard, a little sherry vinegar and cognac as well as substituted some tiny pearl onions for one of the sliced onions. I let it cook in a lsow oven for about 2 hours. Delicious.

I had to re-think my rating of this dish when my husband ate it and raved about it the second day. When we ate it the first night, it was quite marginal, even though I added more onions and garlic, garlic salt and even dumped in some Worcestershire sauce towards the end of the cooking because it was sooooo ordinary. I think this is one of those dishes that needs to sit and develop its flavour. Of course, unless you're making it to freeze, that's hard to do, as it does smell good in the cooking. It's actually very close to my favourite stew recipe, except I use red wine instead of beer - better, deeper flavour. And I'll try it with the herbed dumplings (also on this site) next time instead of egg noodles to soak up the sauce.

This was the best beef stew I've ever eaten. But I made quite a few additions to the basic recipe to take it from good to excellent. After using Guiness extra stout and sweet onions, I added about 20 dried prunes (they sweetened the stew and gave it a great richness), about 12 big shitake mushrooms, turnips, and a pinch of cinnamon. I also added 1 box of thawed frozen green snap about 5 min. before serving. Everyone LOVED this stew.

I agree with others - this was too bland. I followed someone else's suggestion and used Guinness beer, but it tastes like nothing. Needs something to pick it up - will experiment with spices etc tonight to try to improve it. The beef was very tender though

I wanted to make a stew without all of the vegetables (because I knew my kids wouldn't eat it). This was so good. I served it over puff pastry shells and everyone loved it. I was worried that the beer flavor would be strong, but it was just mellow and yummy!!

Delicious and easy!! My husband requests this dinner with mashed potatoes at least 3 times a month!

I was very surprised on how well this recipe turned out. Instead of using the increments on the recipe, I lessened it to 1LB of stew beef, 1 onion, 1-3/4 cup of beef broth and 1 cup of Guinness beer. I did use 3 cloves of garlic. Made this a day ahead and served it over egg noodles. It was fantastic! A definite crowd pleaser!

I thought this was very good. I made it this morning and transferred all ingredients plus 3 whole cloves of elephant garlic to a crock pot - let it simmer on low all day. The gravy was very flavorful. Serve with mashed potatoes.

this is very good and very easy to make. i simmered the stew longer than 1hr. 45min. to really soften the meat. also used guinness beer which worked real well.

I love this recipe. After I tried it, I was surprised that some said it was "bland"... the caramelized onions and beer (I used stout) gave it a lovely sweetness that worked well over egg noodles. Next time I'm going with mashed potatoes, though, the gravy was awesome!

Will make it again; too bland, needs seasoning

The weather outside was cold and rainy -- this seemed like the perfect warm-up dish. I had a bottle of Old Peculiar sitting in the fridge, increased the thyme just slightly, added about two teaspoons of dried green peppercorns, and served this with a mountain of creamy mashed potatoes and steamed baby carrots. The look of bliss on my husband's face after the first forkful convinced me that this dish will be making regular appearances on our table during the winter months! Accompany with a Merlot or Zinfandel (or more Old Peculiar) and life can't get a whole lot better!
