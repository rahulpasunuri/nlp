I guess I am just a traditionalist when it comes to meatloaf. The rye bread didn't do it for me and I prefer tomatoes or tomato products in the meatloaf on just on top.

Meat loaf is not one of my favorites, but this one is a winner. I did change a few things. I used 2 slices of seven grain bread and left out the water. I used cilantro and I did not use a full 8 ozs. of tomato sauce. I put some in the mixture and some on the top. I probably used about 3/4 a cup total. I also chnaged the Parmesan to Mozzarella which I put in the middle. It's a keeper. A good basic recipe.

This was GREAT! I didn't have the rye and white breads but I did have Italian style bread crumbs which worked nicely. I also used a Beef/Pork Mix. Next time I will try the exact recipe and I'm sure it will be as good if not better as I think the rye would be a nice flavor addition.

I made this for my wife and she loved it! I used fresh oregano instead of dried and put it on the top of the meat loaf. The house was filled with this incredible Italian aroma. I will be making this dish over and over again.

Sorry, I would not attempt this unless I delet the bread, eggs & water (I like 100% "meat" loaf - the rye bread is interesting). I press my mixture firm w/spatula. It's easy to add oregano, parsley, & Parmesan to equal "Italian". Consider adding 1 heaping tablespoon, diced very fine, CA sun-dried tomatoes soaked in virgin Olive oil; Diced Red, Green, Yellow Peppers; 1/2 teaspoon of minced Garlic; Use 2 Lbs Chuck/Sirloin w/4-8 Fennel seeds in a processor (or use ground & Fennel seeds seperate); dash of Worchestershire; dash of Red Pepper Sauce; Top w/Tomato Sauce; Top w/ Parmesan (or other like Cream Havarti or Mozzerella); Decorate w/Strips of all 3 peppers; cook as directed. Wait for smiles later... Cook as instructed - sandwiches are great on toasted Italian bread.

All in all, a nice meatloaf - though I modified slightly by leaving out the white bread. Rye does give it a nice flavor. Husband, however thought the dish could be tastier (wouldn't elaborate). Personally, I would make this again - on a night that he's not home for dinner.

I followed the recipe exactly, even though I thought 4 slices of bread to one pound of meat seemed excessive. I liked the flavor the rye bread imparted, but the whole meatloaf had a pasty, baby-food like texture that was totally unappealing. The loaf fell apart even after sitting for 10 minutes. I'll try re-working the recipe with less bread once I get rid of the bad texture memory left on my tongue!

Good basic Italian meatloaf. I spiced it up a bit.

This is a wonderful recipe and will change the minds of folks who don't think they like meatloaf. I soak the bread in red wine and mix the extra wine in with the sauce.

Hard to beat an Italian meatloaf! This is the 'basic' recipe...very very satisfying

Instead of just draining excess water, I'd squeeze the bread after soaking. The end result was a bit too wet. Otherwise, it was good!
