We serve this delicious appetizer with warm corn and flour tortillas. you scoop out some cheese, add a little picante sauce and WAHOO. The Mi Cocina in Dallas that I visited (where I became addicated to this) served it with tortillas. Not sure how it would work with chips?

This was filling, but delicious! My husband and I couldn't even eat our main course we cooked because we were so full. This tastes exactly like the queso con hongos appetizer at the Mi Cocina restaraunts in Dallas.

Definitely tasty, but only good for a few minutes. This recipe would be greatly improved if it began with a roux to make the queso a little more "saucy", in my opinion.

I made this recipe last Christmas for a party. It was a huge hit. I actually forgot about it, then remembered how everyone loved it when planning this years party....and once AGAIN I received rave reviews. I was asked for the recipe by everyone that tried it...trust me, I entertain alot!

Great casual party food-will definetely make this again! I added chorizo sausage (drained well) and shitake mushrooms (couldn't find crimini). It does get pretty stiff when it cools - use a spoon! Delicious!

I agree with the cook from Colchester, VT...don't make until guests have chip in hand. It did turn into a big glob-like mess that guests had to use their fingers to pull apart. If serving at a party I would suggest keeping over a low flame. It was really tasty for the first few guests!

This was a hit! I used regular mushrooms, chopped fine and followed the rest as stated. Anything with cheese is good but this queso was quick simple and delicious! The jalapenos on top gave it a nice kick too.

We went on our typical "car" camping trip, where we indulge in good wine, food and the great outdoors. We made this queso over the fire in our cast iron skillet and it was fabulous. I personally like homemade tortilla chips, I think they hold up better with this cheesy dish!

This is delicious but I substited porcini (cepes) mushrooms . You can use the reconstituted drys ones mixed in with regular white mushrooms (sliced) which you cook first in a skillet with butter and some diced white onion. Add it to the cheese after the cheese is melted. I kept mine in a chafing dish where it stayed hot and bubbly. It was the hit of my Mexican food buffet for 70 people. Needless to say I increased the quantity.

The flavor and ease of this dish are great. I have made it a few times and learned the hard way to NOT make it until your guests have tortilla chips in hand as it is a big rubbery glob if you try to reheat it. Houdini couldn't even make this dish travel...a serve at home (and quickly) dish only.
