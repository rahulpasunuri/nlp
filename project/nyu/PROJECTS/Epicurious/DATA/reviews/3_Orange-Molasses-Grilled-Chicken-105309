I have not yet found a good orange-based marinade recipe, and this is no exception. It's pretty much one-note and quite boring.

Easy, low-fat, and extrememly tasty. What more do you want from boneless chicken breasts? It was a big hit with everyone, even the under-10 set.

I agree with the cook from St. Louis. I thought the combination of ingredients was a bit unusual but they all blended together very nicely! I especially liked the tangy taste the orange offered. One thing I may try next time is to add another tsp of hot pepper sauce as my husband & I like things with a little more kick to it. But the recipe was still delicious as is! I'll definitely add this one to my recipe box, for sure!!

We enjoyed this recipe. With this marinade the chicken browns well on the grill, and it makes a nice presentation with the chicken sliced on a platter and the sauce drizzled over it. The flavors are unusual, which made it a welcome change for grilled chicken. I can't imagine how another reviewer found it bitter... maybe accidentally mismeasured something? We've all done that at some point. Give it a try if you're looking for something different.

While I agree the marinade was very pungent, in fact down right nauseating. I was very concerned when I had planned to make this for my meal on a week long family gathering last summer. However it turned out fabulous....any leftovers were quickly eaten the next afternoon. It was delicious served cold as well. I am planning on making this for a back yard BBQ next week.

I was looking for a low sodium, high potassium marinade and this recipe is just that, except for the high sodium hot sauce(s)! I just subsituted dried crushed red chile pepper (like you put on pizza)for the hot sauce. I have made this recipe twice. The first time I felt the orange zest brought a bitter element to the taste. It was still a pretty good recipe. The second time I omitted the orange zest and added a "stronger" orange juice by using just half of the required water when diluting the orange juice concentrate. I also usually make big batches of recipes so I tripled this recipe and soaked the chicken overnight in gallon size Ziplock freezer bags I buy in bulk from Sam's Club. For leftovers, I place each chicken breast in a small Glad sandwich bag, then put those individual portions in a gallon size Ziplock freezer bag and freeze. Then I have a convenient pre-cooked chicken portion when I need it! By the way, I also pre-cook and pre- portion rice and freeze it the sam way. We eat a lot of wild rice and it freezes well!

I picked this recipe because I had most of the ingredients on hand, and was pleasantly surprised at how such a simple dish turned out so well. With less than an hour to marinate, the chicken had a great flavor. My guests loved it.

This recipe was just bizarre. It tasted terrible. Because the ingredients seemed so strange when I first saw it, I thought maybe somebody was onto something I never would have considered. I should have stuck w/my gut feeling about this one. Yuck!

What can I say? This was awful. The rind made the sauce unbelievably bitter (I used my Microplane to zest, so I know I didn't get any pith). My husband and I took one bite of the chicken, and couldn't stomach another. There are much better things to do with expensive boneless skinless breasts.

I really was looking forward to this dish. It sounds like it should be wonderful, but... The marinade was too strong and the flavors seemed to conflict rather than compliment. It might be terrific with some tweaking, but I doubt that I'll be experimenting with it again.

Boring.

This is a simple and tasty dish, I'd recommend it to anyone who has time for advance preparation and wants to avoid last minute duties in the kitchen. I followed the recipe as written, but next time I'm going to toss a pork tenderloin into the marinade along with the chicken breasts -- seems it should work just as well with pork.

This was fabulous. I served it for a July 4th pre-fireworks dinner with grilled asparagus, and a grilled corn-tomato-basil salad. The flavors in the marinade are wonderful - my guests raved. I marinated it about 6 hrs and didn't change anything in the recipe.

I approached this recipe with a bit of trepidation, thinking it would probably turn out a bit too sweet for my taste, but made it anyhow, thinking it would please my children. It was outstanding, a fabulous blend of sweet and sharp flavors that in my opinion was just about perfect. I plan to make it often, with no changes to the recipe. (The only thing I did that wasn't in the recipe was add some sugar maple wood chips to my gas grill.) I made half the recipe, which was very easy to divide, and marinated the chicken the full 24 hours, which is probably important. By accident I slightly over-reduced the marinade in the initial reduction, winding up with 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup, which worked out fine. To zest the orange, I tried a new trick I had just heard of, using a vegetable peeler to remove the zest, then chopping it up with a sharp knife. I have always found the zesting process tedious and often skimped on the amount I used, but this new technique worked really well for me, and I easily got the necessary amount, which seems to be an essential component to the magic blend of flavors in this suberb recipe. Finally, my wine-loving husband paired this with a Gewurztraminer from Virginia's Wintergreen winery, which complemented it perfectly.
