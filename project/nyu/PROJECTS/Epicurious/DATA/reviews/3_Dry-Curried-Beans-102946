I was excited to find this recipe because it was just like a recipe an old friend of mine used to make in graduate school. She had written it out for me, but at some point I lost it. I made about 1/3 the amount. I did not have black mustard seeds, so I substituted black onion seeds. I did not have fresh curry leaves, and I used a dried red chili instead of a fresh one. As others have said, the dal is a seasoning--it just gives the dish some crunch. The end result was very good, but would have been better without the substitutions. In particular, the fresh chili would have made it spicier, and that would have been better. I had company over and got compliments on the dish. It goes great as a side to roast turkey, chicken or pork, as well with all-out Indian meals.

The small quantities of dal are added for seasoning only - this is typical in South Indian dishes. Fresh coconut is also traditionally used - never dessicated - and it tastes far, far better. The beans should be cooked until just tender - they should NOT be overcooked. Add the minimum amount of water possible. A tablespoon of finely chopped fresh cilantro can also be added with the coconut. Omit the coconut if you do not like it.

Come on, people, it's curried *beans*, not curried *dal*. The amounts of dals are fine. The only thing wrong with this recipe is too much coconut. I would only use a couple tablespoons.

The picture indicates that tsps of dal is right but that amount is miniscule in relation to the green beans. The recipe title is misleading.

The bean measurements here don't seem quite right... teaspoonsful of beans??! Correction, anybody?
