Sorry, but I really didn't think this recipe was all that great. There are many more delicious and flavorful recipes out there....The potatoes were pretty good, but they need to be seasoned with salt and pepper. The veal seemed pretty tasteless to me.

I made this with turkey breast scallops and it was great. The best part is the potatoes - WOW!! Yes, they take longer than the stated 8 minutes but the other reviewers alerted me to that; also, I used peppered bacon as one reviewer suggested and liked the results.

I added a splash of cream to the sauce, then let the scallops soak for about 10 minutes before serving - REALLY good!

This dish was quick & easy to prepare and delicious to boot. The only "change" I made was to wipe out some of the bacon grease from the skillet before cooking the potatoes. This recipe is a keeper.

This was great. I had never made veal before and it came out beautifully. There was extra bacon grease in my pan because I made more bacon for my vegetable dish (green beans), and I think that made the potatoes come out extra tasty - lightly crisped on the outsides and tender inside. Using peppered bacon gives both the potatoes and the veal an extra kick, and we like things a bit spicier. :) The vermouth adds a nice touch, and the gravy was fabulous. I added the juices from the veal platter into it and that was just the right amount/consistency of gravy for us.

This dish was O.K, took too long to make but it was not bad. I would probably make it again, when I have more time to spare, but not often.

I make veal on a regular basis because it is fast, light, and tastes great. I make this recipe when I want something a little heavier and filling (potatoes and bacon). The overall flavor of the dish is wonderful and presentation is nice - garnish with a few sprigs of thyme.

This dish was wonderful despite the fact my grocery store did not have veal and I substituted turkey cutlets. The potatoes did take longer to cook - approximately 12 minutes, they were terrific.

very good. potatoes were delicious - browned beautifully in the bacon fat. sauce was mild but potatoes made up for it!

This was very easy to make, but the sauce was a little bland, given the ingredients. The kids really liked it!

Both my husband and I enjoyed this; it was easy to make as well. But the title of the recipe is incorrect - it should read 'veal scallops with bacon and POTATOES'.

This is really good. The potatoes took a long time to cook. The next time I make it I'll boil them first.
