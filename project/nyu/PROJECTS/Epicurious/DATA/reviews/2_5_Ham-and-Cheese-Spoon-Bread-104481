Tasty and good texture. We enjoyed it more spiced up with the jalepenos.

This was too salty and not satisfying.

I'll admit that I've loved this ever since I saw it published and tried it the same lazy Sunday afternoon. It's become a staple of mine since I usually have all the ingredients on hand anyway and it's so good. I always futz with the recipe and add more ham and cayenne, and I've been using colby-jack for the cheddar. But it's still as good as the original.

I give this horrible dish a one only for the fact it at least caught my eye and attention. After that it stunk I'm with the Nevada City, CA review. Somethings wrong with the directions.

This is a great and tasty alternative side dish (instead of the standard boiled grits). I tried it...used all ingredients exactly as given...ate it with enjoyment...and shared the recipe with others.

You have to really love grits to enjoy this dish. My boyfriend is from the South, and he thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought it tasted a little bland.

I cannot rate this recipe since I think it contains an error. I made it, as per the recipe, with 1 cup instant grits and 1-1/4 cups water. That's about one-fourth the amount of moisture needed. It came out dry and inedible. The instant grits box calls for four cups liquid for one cup grits.
