Great recipe, added rosemary and it was amazing.

Followed the advice of other reviewers here and stuffed the cavity of the fish (trout) with a few green onions, Italian parsley, thyme and rosemary, and used chopped garlic instead of sliced. Had started off with a roasting pan (heated in the oven as it preheated to 400), and loaded it up with halved small red potatoes (cut side down so they would brown) and whole cloves of garlic. Later, added mushrooms and pieces of quartered zucchini. Yes, the fish is plain and simple, but with the vegetables, it's very cozy and satisfying. Just make sure not to overdo the veg! Put the zucchini and mushrooms in a bit too soon, and they were a little dark, as were the garlic cloves after that last twenty minutes of higher heat.

I added grated lemon and orange rind with a little of chopped fresh thyme. Delish, I will make this often.

I used a whole striped bass and followed the recipe exactly. It was the best fish I have ever eaten and was very easy to make.

A good idea, but, like previous cooks, I found that the garlic would have to be sliced extremely thin. I also felt that it lacked other seasoning. some thyme or rosemary and a great deal of salt and pepper. I might try this again, with major adjustments.

My own red snapper and it ate very well for my 4th of July and the day after.Served with buttered broccoli and brown rice with mushrooms. I seasoned with Lawry's and Lawry's Lemon Pepper. I chopped the garlic and had many more slits.It was terrific. Purchased 2 reds back some time ago and now can't wait to cook the other.

I used a red snapper and found the whole deal messy and though good enough, not great. And I wouldn't serve it at a party. The boning process was left to another, I'd enough of the fish.

Basic -- very basic -- but basic is a good thing. Sprinkle with oregano, too.

Very easy and tasty. Season well.

I cheated. I came on-line looking for a recipe for Tilapia because that's what I had at home. This recipe semed to fit so I prepared my filets according to this recipe. I tossed my variety pack of mushrooms with the garlic and olive oil and cooked them all together. I used Emerils Essence, Lawrey's Seasoning, lemon pepper and a blend of black and red pepper. The slivers of garlic placed into slits on the fish caused a wonderful explosion in my mouth. This is a spectular dish!!!!

Best fish I've made at home... One whole striped bass was just right for 2 people. I used about 6 garlic cloves and we loved the garlicky taste.

very good...be sure to chop the garlic very small (i used a garlic masher) so that it cooks completely and melts in your mouth. the garlic tends to have a spicy kick if it's still raw..

This worked very well for me as a good basic whole-fish recipe. I used red snapper and added fresh sprigs of rosemary inside the cavity. The three crosswise slits are great for the flavor, but they also made it fine to serve even on the bone (the heat in the slits makes each of the three sections plump up, so the meat's easy to find and eat). I served it with rice, broccoli, and sautéed shiitake mushrooms. My guests raved....

Delicious! I used a filet instead of a whole fish, but didn't change a thing. The infusion of garlic flavor was great, and it was very easy to make. Of course, cleaning the oven after the sizzle of the fish on the oil in the hot dish will be tedious, but it was worth the mess!

i thought this recipe was pretty good. i used only a striped bass fillet since it was my first time eating this type of bass. i was pleasantly surprised. next time i will add bunches more of slits and LOTS more garlic slivers. it was nice to have the garlic melt in your mouth with the fish. also, be sure to use a good amount of salt to enhance the olive oil flavor.

This dish satisfied my usual criteria: simple and delicious. The prep was really easy and I've never tasted fish so infused with the flavor of garlic. I don't know that I'd do anything differently next time as this dish was so satisfying.
