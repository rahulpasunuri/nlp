Absolutely delicious. Also used the Trader Joe's lentils to save time and used chicken sausage with rosemary and fennel. Used balsamic vinegar because I didn't have red wine, but you can even use lemon juice. The fennel and fennel seed makes the dish!!!

So easy, yet so delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I used a little less onion and and was a little heavy on the parsley. I also didn't have fennel seeds. I used a half a package of the Trader Joe's precooked lentils. We used a gluten-based veggie sausage on top and it was great. But the veggie base was really the star. With using precooked lentils, it only took me 10 minutes. A satisfying, healthy, delicious quick meal.

Wow, this was exceptional! I had never used fennel before, but the flavor worked so well with the lentils! I used spicy pork sausage, which added just the right amount of kick. I also omitted the carrots as I'm not a fan. Can't wait to make this again!

Easy and flavorful...like other reviewers I'm all about easy clean up. Too many pots in the recipe. I simmered the lentils in one sauce pan and cooked the sausage in a dutch oven. While the sausage finished I went ahead and added the fennel,onions, carrots and I added a few cloves of garlic to the mix. Took out the sausage, let cool and cut into large pieces. Added the lentils to the pot with about a cup of their simmering liquid, then put the sausage back in to the pot. Then added parsley, fronds, vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. Really nice mix of flavors - earthy and warm. Perfect for a crisp fall night. Served with crusty sourdough and a crisp Pinot Noir. Love this site - I've been a member since 2003 and have built a reputation as a great cook among friends and family thanks to these great recipes.

I'm a bit like Lister from Red Dwarf when it comes to spices (I "drink cold curry sauce for breakfast"), but I didn't think this dish was bland at all. I made it as written, though I did cook the sausages first, using the same pan for the veggies. Another great weeknight dinner--accurately tagged as quick and easy.

Thank Goodness that I used a spicy chorizo sausage. I also doubled the amount of sausage in the recipe. Even so, it needed herbs and salt. I can't imagine how terribly bland it would have been with sweet italian sausage.

Easy and flavorful. I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. Use French lentils if possible--they cook much more quickly than ordinary, easier-to-find lentils.

A delicious and easy week night dinner.The only adjustments I made were 2 cloves of minced garlic and 1 tsp dried thyme [added while sauteeing onion, carrot and fennel bulb]. Just a little hint: Serve the lentils at just warm or even room temperature - the flavors are more pronounced.

I liked this better than I thought I would. The fennel and the vinegar make the dish, surprisingly. It´s easy and quick to put together. This would be a good dish for a family with both vegetarians and non, as the sausage is cooked separately. In my case, since there are no vegetarians, maybe next time I´ll brown the sausage, cut it up and throw it in with the lentil/veg mixture to cook up there. This dish can be as healthy or unhealthy as you want it to be; just vary the amount of sausage you use.

OOPS! Wrong review! Was delicious! Didn't really get a fennel taste, but everyone enjoyed the dish!

Definitely roasting the squash, onions, carrots and garlic was the way to go! Made it very yummy! Everyone loved it!

Really tasty and easy to make. I added an extra tablespoon of vinegar at the end, plus more salt and pepper to taste. Used organic chicken Italian sausages, skipped adding the additional olive oil. Served with multigrain diner rolls for a prefect dinner. Would definitely recommend getting the french green lentils! I also think this recipe would be really great with sweet potato or acorn squash if you wanted to make it vegetarian. Plan to make it again and again.

This was part of my New Years Eve menu. We had sauerkraut with apples, brown butter winter greens, this dish and the orange brandy cake for dessert. Absolutely divine recipe! I even forgot to add the fresh parsley and red-wine vinegar at the end.

Used this recipe as a base with some invention - substituted red pepper for fennel ('cause it was what I had on hand) and tried to make more of a casserole (i.e. all ingredients together in one pot). Very good, interesting mix of flavours (in a good way), no fuss. Found the the instructions use too many different pans (one for the lentils, one for the veggies, one for the sausage) - will make it again and continue to try to find a way to reduce after-dinner clean-up.

Delicious and very flavorful! I used homemade vegetable broth for cooking the lentils. Will definitely make again!

Really delicious!! Wasn't expecting it to be as tasty as it was. I don't understand the reviewers who said this was lacking flavor!! Maybe the sausages weren't that good?? I used hot sausage, rather than sweet, but either way, this is a great and easy weeknight dinner.

Rating: 4
I thought this recipe was great and nice and quick to prepare. We didn't have dried lentils so used canned lentils that we drained and then used 1/4 cup of water. We did add an additional tablespoon of red wine vinegar! What a great weeknight meal!

I had to amend my previous review after having this for my lunch on the 2nd day. The fennel flavors really bloomed overnight and this recipe is now worthy of 4 forks. Proof that sublime meals can arise out of unexceptional ingredients, and a little effort. Season freely.

Rating: 3
I use fennel seeds infrequently but they were essential to this recipe. I made 1.5 x the lentils and doubled the veggies, red wine vinegar and added minced garlic. My carrots, and fennel were fresh from the farmers market and I purchased a quality Italian sausage from a European butcher shop. I don't understand the reviewers that thought this was bland. Taste and have the confidence to adjust the seasonings to taste. Using the fronds as an edible garnish was a great finishing touch. Easy to produce as a week-day dinner, economical, flavorful and hearty.

This recipe was just ok. I felt it was lacking in seasoning but I couldnt place how. I did forget the 1 T of red-wine vinegar but can't imagine it would make such a big impact. The dish was not bad, but it is not visually appealing and since it doesn't taste out of this world, I would likely skip it next time. Again, its not bad but probably not worth the effort again.

I immediately added this to my keepers file. I did not have much experience cooking with fennel and this recipe was pretty friendly.

So easy and hearty and the fennel makes it special. I would serve this as a casual dinner for guests. It's so quick to make though that it is an easy workday meal. I used Italian sausage made with chicken and first sauteed the sausage in the pan, took it out, and used the same pan for the veggies. Save washing the other pan and use the yummy sausages juices!

This is so tasty and so fast for dinner anytime. And pretty healthy too (with a little less olive oil and a lower fat sausage). We rarely make a recipe twice but have made this a few times and I plan to again tonight.

This was very good but like other reviewers, I just had to modify it. I boiled the lentils in vegetable broth with a bay leaf, added extra vinegar at the end, and added hot sauce for a bite. I used "mire poix" with the fennel and I also added thyme and celery salt to the lentil/vegetable mixture. I like to have a lot of flavor and it worked.

Pretty tasty, though not something I would want to eat every week. Probably would be very good sans sausage as well.

Great winter dish. My wife and I both thought it could use more lentil mixture for the amount of sausage made (we love lentils.) We used water like the recipe called for and don't think chicken broth is needed.

Rating: 0
I made this dish because my husband enjoys fennel, I'm not a huge fan but I have to say this was a hit. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used white beans instead of lentils because I had them on hand from another dish. I also grated the carrot which worked out fantastically and added fresh thyme instead of parsley. This dish was great, even the teenagers loved it!

If one is Italian, lentils should bring good luck for the New Year. The only good luck I had was pitching this. After two bites, my husband asked if we could order pizza in. Beyond bad.

Wonderfully flavored recipe. Next time I will only use about 1/2 pound of sausage (or make a double batch but only use 1 pound). Even my 2 year old had 2 helpings of lentils. A great way to use the fennel from my CSA box!

I loved this!! Easy to make and just so flavorful! I omitted the fennel seeds, added a little extra carrot, and used bulk Italian sausage, because that's what I had on hand. It is a rich dish, so I will cut the amount of sausage dramatically when I make this again. Thankfully, I made a double batch!!

I love this recipe. We've made this several times. Each time has been slightly different and always satisfying. Tonight we altered the recipe with bacon instead of sausage, added sage and rosemary with some white beans - wonderful.

Really good. Easy. I added a small onion, halved, a smashed clove of garlic and a bay leaf to the lentils while cooking. I saved a pan by sauteing sausages first then cooking rest of veggies in same pan. I added celery and garlic to the veggies.

I could not be more pleased with a recipe. In fact, this is the first recipe I've reviewed, I was so motivated by the results. The only recommedation I have is to make a double batch.

After reading the other reviews, I would strongly recommend cooking the lentils in chicken stock. I did this and the finished meal was excellent. I am definitely making this meal again!

I loved this dish! My husband also really enjoyed it but said "he got lentiled out". I boiled the lentils in chicken stock instead of water. I substituted italian chicken sausage for the pork sausage. After cooking and cutting the sausages, I threw them back in the pan to keep warm and continue to brown. I mixed the sausages with the lentils and veggies just before serving and sprinkled the fennel fronds on top.

So delicious - subtle, savory flavors! I used part low sodium chicken stock to cook the lentils - definitely didn't need 4 1/2 C. liquid to cook them. Also boiled the sausages and then browned them in a pan because the first time I made this recipe the sausages stuck to my pan and made a mess. Will be a family favorite for years to come!

This was my first experience cooking fennel, and it was so easy! I chopped everything in a food processor, omitted the fennel seeds and parsley, and just used a little bit of sausage. It was really easy and tasty, and I bet the leftovers will be even better.

This is a favorite weeknight dinner at our house. My husband originally picked this recipe to try and I'm glad he did. It exceeded my expectations. We have used all kinds of sausages with this - chicken sausage, turkey sausage, spicy, not spicy - just use whatever you like! I love the lentils without the sausage as a side dish too for a vegetarian option.

Rating: 4
Oh boy was this good! I took a cue from other reviewers and used the food processor to chop the vegetables: made it much easier. I also used kielbasa instead of the sausage, which added a welcome smoky flavor. The only other thing I changed was to brown the kielbasa in the same pan I then cooked the vegetables in, mostly to save on clean-up later (the recipe as written uses almost every pot or pan in my kitchen!). Overall, a great combination of flavors in a dish that comes together easily. Will definitely be making this again!

Quite delicious! I used a little more lentils than called for. Great for a cold evening. Will try lamb sausage for a change next time.

I never thought I liked Fennel. But this has changed that. It was really quite lovely. Very subtle really, but then I didn't put the fennel seeds in! I did however use lamb chops instead of sausages and added fresh chopped tomato into the vegie pot whilst it was cooking. This helped balance the colours.

Rating: 4
WOW! I was totally surprised by this. Super yummy - low effort- my favorite combination. I chopped all the veggies in a food processor since it wasn't necessary that they were uniform. I also used less olive oil to cook the veggies, browned them with the lid off, and then deglazed the pan with some of the lentil water. I used a combo of aged balsimic and white balsamic for the vinegr and used organic chicken sausage from wild oats. Outstanding! Get the French lentils if you can. My hubby described as elegant comfort food.

Better than expected. Loved the fennel/lentil flavor combo. We used chicken thighs instead of sausage as we had already had sausage once this week. Chicken worked fine, might try with fish or scallops also. Chopping goes much faster with those new vegetable chopper/dicers.

I can't believe I totally forgot about the carrots! Anyway it was still delicious. I used sweet Italian Chicken sausages. I love that this hearty dish that really makes you feel fed is also so healthy.

This was great but of course, I had to make a view changes/additions. I cooked the lentils in chicken broth, added 2 cloves of garlic and a 14 1/2 oz. can of diced tomatoes and grilled the sausage. Finished it with a drizzle of truffle oil. A satisfying alternative to meat and potatoes.

Good, hearty dish that matched well with a syrah. The flavors blended nicely, only thing I didn't like was the fine chopping required of the veggies. I've saved this recipe to my recipe box and will definitely make it again as my kids and picky boyfriend both ate it.

Try not to over cook the lentils or the whole thing will end up looking pretty unappetizing. Even then, it is delicious. I made this the first time with chicken (garlic and herb) sausage from trader joes and the flavors were perfect together with a little pinot noir. I leaned heavy on the vinegar and it does serve it well to brighten it up.

I had some difficulty making this dish for the first time. The sausage was difficult to brown due to the shape and I ended up splitting the sausage lengthwise to get it to brown evenly. I also overcooked the lentils. I forgot the parsley. In fact, it was starting to look like a disaster! Despite all, not only did I find it delicious, but so did my wife and kids (who are reasonably picky eaters). I was even skeptical based on the appearance before we sat down to eat. I found the presentation to be off-putting, but the taste won everybody over. I will definately make this again. The only reason I couldn't go with four forks was that it doesn't wow the eyes, but don't let that stop you!

Thought this was GREAT and will make it again, but I experienced something I hadn't before. When I first started boiling the lentils, the water began turning black. Not murkey... PITCH black! I dumped them in a strainer, rinsed them AGAIN, and then started over. Got a little murkey second time around, but not bad. Rest of the recipe went fine, and tasted great. Anyone ever seen that? I've cooked lentils many times but that was a new one on me. ??

This has become a weekly favorite. I just buy the precooked organic applewood farms sausage and stir it into the dish with the lentils, it's easy and delicious. I have used both the Italian sausage version as well as the andouille version - which adds a little kick. Both go really well.

Ever since I first tasted lentils in a salad at a small restaurant in Le Puy, France, I am always looking for new ways to use lentils. This recipe was fabulous! Instead of frying the sausage, I grilled them on the BBQ. I plated the lentils on a large platter, topped it with the sausage and garnished with fennel fronds & a splash of extra- virgin olive oil. I placed a basket of olive bread on the table and my family helped themselves!

what a wonderful dish! used hot italian sausages. unfortunately trader joe's sells trimmed fennel (so no fronds) but i was able to find some at a specialty market. happily, the healthiness of the lentils et al, offset (some of) my concerns about eating too much sausage.
