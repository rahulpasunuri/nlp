Excellent and quick to prepare, and I"m giving four forks simply because it's EASY and fast! I used plums from my own tree and went heavy on the cinnamon and added nutmeg. Only issue was it took a longer time to bake than I'd expected -- after a solid 70 minutes it still wasn't browned on top. Took it out of the oven at that time anyway & served it for breakfast the next morning -- delicious! No issues with runniness after letting it cool overnight.

Very delicious and easy. Added more spices like ginger and clove to the topping as suggested by others. Macerated plums with cherry brandy, (would not added cornstarch next time).

OMG...this was SO good, and easy too! I used Pulots, because that's what I had, so I added 1 TBS corn starch because they have more juice, and a TBS. lime juice to give it a little more acidity. I put 1/4 tsp. salt in the topping, used ginger, and apple pie spice in both the topping and the filling. Didn't have Brandy so I used Grand Mariner...YUMMM! This will be a keeper for sure! Served it to my "jaded" family and they LOVED it.

This was so understated and delicious. I used amaretto instead of brandy, added some almonds and raisins and added flax to the crumble (suggested in an earlier review). The recipe's not too sugary and calls for just the right amount of everything. Really divine! Terrific with cream or creme fraiche.

great recipe. very adjustable for whatever fruits you have in season. if you don't include port, it tastes a bit flat.

Normally I would use brown sugar for a crumble but the recipe just said sugar, did others use brown. Mine did not look very nice at all.

Note to anyone contemplating significantly cutting back on the butter to reduce the fat... I tried this using just 5 tablespoons of butter and the topping was very dry. You can get it to resemble a crumble, pieces hold together, but they do not come together as a cohesive topping as it bakes and it does not brown much. Not a complete disaster, but it would have been smarter to simply make a 3/4 batch of the topping. I agree with the suggestions to add salt (large pinch) and (at least) double the cinnamon. Our plums were more tart than sweet and using 1/3 + 1/3 cup sugar left us a very tart dish. That was ok for us, but wouldn't have suited many people's dessert taste.

This is my staple Summer entertaining dessert. I have made this a dozen times or more. Guests always ask for the recipe. When I make it, I usually double the topping and make sure that the plums I use aren't too juicy. The really juicy plums do make the dish too liquid. I also add blueberries on occasion, which add a little flavor and color. This is a very easy recipe to prepare. Enjoy!!

Particularly good with Italian prunes -- but, as usual, everybody's favorite part was the topping. I added extra cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and a little ginger to liven everything up. Also let the cut plums rest in a bowl with some brandy (I used Calvados because it was handy) and some sugar to draw out the juices. Very nice.

Not terribly exciting, and very runny. I'd advise tossing some cornstarch or flour with the plums as a thickener. the topping is OK, walnuts would improve it.

As we speak the crumble is in the oven. I doubled it as we have tons of plums in the sunny okanagan. Decided to use whole wheat flour added 3tblsp of flax meal, added the salt as suggested and more cinnamon but did'nt have brandy or port so I used prune juice and pure maple syrup. I hope it turns out if not I will make it the proper way, some times you just have to improvise. Starting to bake & bubble and smells wonderful can hardly wait to taste it. Absolutly Delish, would'nt change a thing untill the next time I make it and don't have all the ingredients. Gals gotta do what a gals gotta do!

I was looking for a recipe to make use of a surplus of plums and peaches that I had and this worked great! I mixed the plums and peaches together and it was delishious. I also quadrupled the cinnamon and added a little extra sugar because we are very fond of cinnamon. It was easy and very very yummy.

At last, something to use up our plums besides making jelly. Similar to my mother-in-law's recipe - both versions are great homey comfort food desserts (and breakfast, if you have make enough to have left-overs!). Watch the sugar and adjust for tart plums or sweet plums.

This was the best crumble/crisp type recipe I have ever made (and I've been making these dishes for 40 years). It came out perfectly and warm from the oven with Haagen Daz vanilla was sublime. Only suggestion: I added a pinch of salt to the topping. Do try this.

Easy, fast, homey, and delicious. And the color! I used black plums, which after baking turned an exquisite shade of fuschia.
