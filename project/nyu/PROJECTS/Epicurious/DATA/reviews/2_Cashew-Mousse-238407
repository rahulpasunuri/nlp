Exactly what you expect: rich, bold cashew flavor. I loved this recipe because it is simple and very quick to prepare, and can be made ahead; it was still good in my fridge three days later. Garnished with some chocolate shavings. I want to try this with other nuts (pistachio?). I actually didn't have salted cashews, so I used unsalted cashews and salted to taste at the very end of the recipe.

I did not make this recipe because of the gelatin, but thought I'd offer a simple and adaptable guideline for cashew mousse for the Cook who had trouble: soak raw cashews in cold water in the refrigerator for at least a couple of hours. Drain the water and process in a food processor - after the consistency thickens then pour in a little maple syrup (for sweetness) and almond/soy milk (creaminess). Mix to the right consistency and add vanilla - it is almost a pudding consistency. A blender works best for ultimate creaminess.

this is a very tastey sweet cashew soup. What did I do wrong? Lots of work to sieve the cashews & then went flat... it was not impressive.
