I did my own stuffing but the brine was very good, gave the turkey a nice brown once roasted. And the gravy, oh my word, best ever gravy I could eat it on it's own.

I only gave it 3 forks because I only used the brine recipe - which was Fantastic!!! It left the turkey moist and seasoned without too much saltiness. I will definitely use this brine again!

I've made this for years now and love it so much I'm honoring it's with my first ever Epicurious review. Our family, including my chef son, has adopted this brine as the ultimate way to brine Turkey and everything else that needs a good brine. We even use it as our fish smoking brine. It also adds a beautiful mahogany veneer causing one guest to ask if the turkey was fake. Above all the flavor is amazing. One proviso... even most salt lovers scale back it to 1 rounded cup.

Great recipe. Going on 5th or 6th Thanksgiving. I brine the turkey in a contractors bag (heavy plastic), sold at hardware stores. I sit the bag in a roasting pan that fits in the fridge. Add turkey, pour in brine -- it helps to have another set of hands to keep the bag open -- and then Just seal the bag tight, getting air out so brine covers turkey. Easier than it sounds. Works every time for me.

Love Love LOVE this recipe! Historically a true fan of Brining...so after perusing this I decided to give it a go. It will definately be used again. The gravy?? FANTASTIC! "Deeeeee- lish" as quoted by holiday dinner guests....I enjoyed the addition of gingersnap cookies!

Wondering how much fresh sage and thyme is in a "bunch." I expect that must be some standard grocery or farmers market amount, but we grow our own herbs, so I'm not familiar with bunches. I'm just putting the brine together - it sounds great and the reviews all seem very positive.

This is an outstanding brining turkey recipe. I have used it every year since first published and not only for Thanksgiving. I have branched out and tried a few others, southwest, simple brine, but this is by far the best! The browing of the bird is picture perfect as well!

I have used this recipe for the last 4 years. We raise our own turkeys, I cook 3 every year, 1 for my workplace, 2 for separate family dinners. My turkeys dress out at 40- 50 lbs (no kidding!)they are always juicy and delicious. I brine for 2 full days, I use a very large plastic bag inside of a storage tote. I don't always use the gingersnap gravy, but it is good. This is the best brined turkey recipe I have found.

This was awesome. Brining is the way to go. We had 3 turkeys at our dinner and mine was the first to go. Moist juicy delicious! I grilled the turkey per the 2009 instructions. It was very easy and an added bonus was that it freed up my oven.

Rating: 4
This has become my standard brine recipe for Thanksgiving - the combination of sweetness (molasses and brown sugar) and herbs (thyme and sage) balance each other nicely in the bird. Most importantly, the turkey comes out moist and succulent. I get rave reviews every year on my turkey and this recipe is my secret.

Rating: 4
You must give the Gingersnap Gravy a try! It is very unusual and adds another dimension to the gravy passed around your Thanksgiving dinner table. It thickens very quickly and I would suggest starting with 5 fewer cookies (15 instead of 20). Check the consistancy after that and see if you feel you need more. You may consider making this in addition to the regular TG gravy, though I gambled and just made this and it was loved by all. Including me! And I don't eat gravy.

Had 17 people over for Thanksgiving. Most said this was the most moist turkey they have ever had. They loved the gravy...thought it was scrumptious. I roasted a 20lb turkey at a higher temp (425)for about 3hr 45min. Very juicy! I also used the stock for baste and used only the pan juices for the gravy, saving some broth and skipping a step. Will probably try again next year.

I have used this brine recipe for the last 4 years. The only change I have made is to place the water, salt, sugar and molasses in a large stockpot on the stove. I heat the water just long enough to allow everything to dissolve. I then let it cool to room temp before using. It's a bit putzy but I think I get better results from the brine.

Big bowl problem solved: I have made this for years, and like most I don't bother with the gravy. Lots of reviewers noted how hard it is to find a bowl large enough. I always use an ice chest, usually styrofoam, instead of a bowl. A small one fits in your refrigerator if you take out a shelf. And if you live where it's very cold, you could just leave it sitting out in your garage. Happy thankgiving!

The brine was fabulous, the turkey came out great. The gravy was hugely disappointing. Sweet, almost cloyingly so, and with a strange flavor. Sorry to go against the grain here, but I'd use the brine recipe again... the gravy was reasonably nasty.

Rating: 4
The turkey was incredibly moist and flavorful with this recipe! My father said it was the best turkey he'd ever had. I accidentally left out 1/3 of the brown sugar, and it was still amazing. One logistical note: I couldn't find a big enough bowl, so just used a typical turkey roasing pan, and after about 12 hours of brining the liquid had escaped the trash bags and was close to leaking over the top of the pan. It's probably best to track down a big bowl.

I made this turkey for Christmas. It was great initially and kept its flavor for days of leftovers. One change I made was to roast the bird for the first hour with the breast side down. This is a Joy of Cooking idea that helped keep the thighs and legs cooked without overdoing the breast. Still a good recipe if you plan your time well. The gravy was especially good; watch out, it foams when you add the vinegar.

This dish is fantastic. The gravy is out of this world. The key I think is in the pouring of the chicken stock every half hour while cooking. Even my super (understated) picky mother in law actually asked for the recipe! I followed exactly and everything turned out as stated.

I don't normally post twice, but as I was reading the reviews, it sounds like the people who didn't like this dish did not brine correctly. Naturally, the gravy is a sweet one; however, the sweet can be balanced with salt and should taste more savory...

I've made this turkey two years in a row to rave reviews. The turkey is succulent and easy. I do recommend surprising people by not telling them about the gingersnap gravy until they taste it. People have said "gingersnap gravy?" with distaste until they try it. I also serve the piquant cranberry sauce with this for great contrast. Also, use a food grade cooking bag, and not a trash bag as indicated in the recipe. Lastly, I recommend cooking to 165/67 or so, not and not to 175. This is more than sufficent (as the USDA has currently noted, and produces a far juicier bird.

Rating: 3
I believe they are talking about the weight of the salt being 9 oz. So you would measure out 2 cups of salt but if you then weighed it, it would weigh 9 oz. The difference between weight and volume. Another example 1 cup shredded cheese (4 oz.) it would measure out to 1 cup but if you were to weigh it, it would be 4 oz. So that saying "a pint is a pound the world around" isn't really true!

Rating: 0
HELP! Recipe calls for 2 cups (about 9oz) of salt for brining. Well, 2 cups is 16 oz., so do I go for 9 or 16 oz.? I know there's a delicate balance of salt and water & this will be my second attempt at brining.

Third time I'm making this recipe. Amazing!

My first experience with brining, and it's almost a pity I tried this recipe first . . . I will make this EVERY holiday! Made almost exactly according to recipe (brined for 24 hours, stuffed with one onion and two garlic bulbs, cooked in a stone roaster with foil tent), this turkey was so fabulous that juice literally poured out of the white meat when sliced. My husband, who doesn't care much for turkey and only eats dark meat, asked for seconds on the white meat. Before the Thanksgiving leftovers were gone, he asked if we could have a Christmas party and brine another one! We didn't make gravy, as it didn't need any. The dark meat picks up more salt than the white, so pat that extra thoroughly before roasting (no need to rinse). Also, turn the garbage bag over after 12 hours to allow all sides to soak equally. Finally, the stock makes an amazing soup (esp. the Turkey Sage Chowder found on this site) with no need for additional seasoning.

Rating: 4
Excellent results and rave reviews with this turkey and gravy. I used two turkey breasts instead of the whole bird and placed the vegetables and herbs on the rack underneath each breast as it cooked. I also used boxed turkey broth enlieu of homemade stock.

Rating: 4
The turkey was delicious. I cooked the turkey breast down until the last hour. I improvised with the gravy so I can't rate it fairly. Didn't want a sweet gravy so cut back on ginger snaps & added powdered ginger. It wasn't extraordinary but it was good.

Rating: 4
Nice way of preparing the turkey. It doesn't taste salty or sweet, it had a noce brown color and it is certainly very juicy (although I injected it with the drippings every time i basted it). Everybody loved it and I think I would prepare it again. The gravy was nice but I think the number of gingersnaps could be reduced as it can become very thick, but the taste is certainly very good. We served it with pinot noir which certainly goes very well with the turkey.

Rating: 3
I would definitely make this again. The turkey was a HUGE hit -- the flavor from the brining and cooking was fabulous and penetrated every part of the bird. Loved the gravy, too, though I could see why traditionalists might not like it. The next time I may try using fewer gingersnaps but throwing in a little flour.

Rating: 2
Nothing spectacular for all the work of brining the turkey, you couldn't really taste any of the molasses or other flavorings. There are many other recipes on this website that do not require so much work and are much, much better. The gravy, however, was phenomenal - used a tablespoon worcestire sauce. Gravy looks horrible at first, but evens out when it thickens up and tastes great.

Rating: 4
Made this for Thanksgiving - first time brining and was skeptical. I double bagged a cooler with 10 gallon trash bags and and put the bird (15 lb)and poured the brine in. The bird was extremely moist - never needed to inject flavoring. It came out at a wonderful shade of brown (needed to foil tent) and smelled wonderful. Skipped the stock and gingersnap gravy and opted for the traditional version - the drippings are saltier so something to keep in mind when making the gravy. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 4
I have made this turkey at least 6 times-never straying from the original brine recipe, but alternating plain gravy with the gingersnap. Never fails to impress the guests.

Rating: 0
The salt does not make the food salty - it sets up a condition that makes water enter the cells of the turkey, thus making it moist. By cutting back on the salt compared to the amount of water, the correct ratio of salt solution to food will not be correct. Read more about brining. Also, brining works great with chicken and pork. We don't grill either without brining first.

Rating: 4
I made this turkey last year for Thanksgiving and received raving reviews. I am not a salt person so did not add as much salt as the recipe called for. Also when I made the gravy I forgot to make the stock so made the gravy without it and it still came out great. I usually prefer the side items instead of the turkey but this recipe was so good, I couldn't resist seconds. The gravy is a must, well worth the effort!

I made this gravy for my first time cooking Thanksgiving dinner. It was fantastic and very easy to make. (Crumble the snaps the night before) The gingersnaps give the gravy a nice spiciness and thicken it perfectly. (Much better than the flour/milk routine that seems to take forever) I thinned the gravy the next day with milk and added to my leftover turkey potpie. It was perfect there, too.

Made this for Thanksgiving, won't be making it again. I brined it in a cooler, and I think it got too cold because even after 6 hours the interior wasn't done. Finally ate it anyway. That part was probably my error, but the gravy was a very odd consistency (sludgy) and we didn't like the taste much--even gingersnap fans. Not a hit.

Made a capon as a test run for Christmas turkey. Could not get meat to cook all the way through. Tough bird (common around Nairobi this time of year) or a problem with the recipe or oven? Not sure. At any rate, gravy is too sweet and a weird consistency. Tried it for novelty factor, but will not try the gravy EVER again. The meat is OK, but there's got to be a way to make it taste better. Even as starved as I was, it only tasted OK.

Made this for Thanksgiving '04 and we loved it. Started with a fresh, farm-raised turkey and brined it the night before. It was worth the effort. I've had Cajun-fried turkey before and I liked it because it was moist, but this turkey was moister and more flavorful. The molasses also gives the skin a rich and dark color. My only complaint: not enough leftovers!

Wow this was good! My 16 pound turkey fit in a large aluminum stock pot (I put it inside a plastic garbage bag as recommended since I wasn't sure if the brine would react with the aluminum.) It was cold enough outside to just let it sit on the screened back porch for 20 hours so I didn't need to make room in the fridge. I didn't have time to make the giblet broth and used canned vegetable broth, but it turned out just fine. I also forgot to get fresh thyme, so used dried and it was fine. I probably could have used dried sage too, but happened to still have that growing in the garden. The brining gives the skin a deep golden color that is hard to replicate with traditional roasting without overcooking the meat. The most amazing part of this recipe is the gravy! It was even good without the onion (though I used a lot of garlic and some garlic powder before roasting so maybe that made up for it). I just removed the fat from the pan juices and added the crushed cookies, vinager, and worchestershire. The gravy thickened almost instantly and there was no messing with flour/water, plus crushing the cookies inside a heavy duty freezer bag gave the kids something to do! The gravy is a little sweet, but not overly, and complemented everything else. This recipe is just wonderful and I am making it again for Christmas.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic. I rinsed my 20 lb bird after soaking it in a cooler w/ the brine for 20 hours, but I think next time I won't - I will simply pat it dry as the recipe suggests. It was tender, juicy and browned very nicely. The GRAVY was amazing- my mom, who usually has an aversion to spice cookies or gingered desserts, LOVED it. We did too- very complimentary to all Thanksgiving dishes. Highly recommend. I added 18 cookies instead of 20. Best part is, the flour in the cookies thicken the gravy so no need to add any additional thickener. Fantastic.

Rating: 4
This was an excellent recipie. I'll always brine my turkeys from now on! Next time I would add more herbs, maybe put some under the skin. Also, the gravy was excellent, but a little too sweet, I recommend using about 1/2 the amount of gingersnaps and adding some flour to thicken

I will never make another turkey without brining it again! This was unbelievably juicy and moist. I think the herbs didn't add much flavor; next time I'll either leave them out or steep them in a little of the water first. I put the turkey and brine in 2 Reynold's oven roaster bags, then placed the bag in a cooler with ice outside (one of the few advantages of living in the midwest). The only problem was, the bags leaked. Next time, I'll use the extra large ziploc bags. The gravy was great.. not sweet, just a nice tangy flavor. Everyone loved it. And brining does not make the turkey salty at all. I didn't rinse the turkey, just patted it dry. Delicious.

The brined turkey was far superior to my usual one - tender and moist. However, I plan to cut the salt down to one cup, as I only used 1 1/2 cups and it was somewhat too salty. A keeper for my Thanksgiving bird. We weren't wild about the gingersnap gravy and will go back to a basic one.

This was my first time brineing a turkey and I am now convinced that this is the way to cook a turkey. I have never been a big fan of turkey because it is always dry. This was moist and delicious.

First time brining, and didn't know what to expect, but the results were very good, juicy and tender. My turkey usually is not dry since I am very careful not to overcook, so the difference was not dramatic, but I and all my guests were pleased. There was no noticeable difference in the flavor of the turkey meat, but the texture was improved. I will do this again. I made no changes to the brining recipe. I did not rinse the turkey before roasting as some suggested and the meat was not salty. The drippings were saltier than normal, but when added to unsalted turkey broth for the gravy, it added great flavor and color. Used sea salt and soaked the 23 lb turkey for 18 hours, and may soak longer next time to try to infuse more flavor into the turkey.

Made the turkey and the gravy. Both were delish--especially the turkey. My husband who's not a turkey fan even enjoyed this. I grilled the turkey on my gas grill and smoked it with mesquite chips. It came out moist, with deliciously crispy skin. I highly recommend grilling turkey to anyone. This was my first attempt and I had fabulous results--plus it frees up the oven for your side dishes. The only thing I did differently from the recipe (other than grilling) is that I smeared some of the oil/herb rub underneath the skin as well as over it. Don't worry about saltiness from the brine. I used the pan drippings for gravy and not a hint of saltiness. I did rinse the turkey when I took it out of the brine, but only a quick light rinsing to the outside. I won't bother rinsing next time ...

This recipe is "THE BEST". I was told to look no farther, this is the recipe we will use every Thanksgiving. With over 25 people at my Thanksgiving table it is hard to please everyone, but this recipe did. Even the people who don't like turkey raved about this one. Needless to say we had lots of ham for leftovers and my turkey is all gone. I didn't let anyone know what was in the gravy and even made a traditional gravy for backup. The traditional one only got used when we ran out of the gingersnap. It was great! Another plus(as if it needs one)is how easy this recipe is. You can't go wrong with this one.

I cooked this last year for 70 people using three 30lbs turkeys. I needed moisture and that's what i got. Even after reheating the two previously cook turkeys, all three were perfect on the inside. The gingersnap gravy is a snap and a wonderful change to the plain old. Worries about spiciness or sweetness can be allayed by cutting the crushed gingersnap with flour or crushed graham crackers. I'm making it again!!!

We chose to grill/smoke our brined turkey instead of baking it, which turned out extroidinarily well. Everyone raved about the turkey, which we are still enjoying days after thanksgiving. The gravy was absolutely delicious. The gingersnap cookies were a bit difficult to crumble but dissolved in the liquid well. Definately try this recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic! I used Alton Brown's method of cooking however, which starts out with a 500 degree oven for 1/2 hour and then reduces to 350 for the remainder of the cooking.

The gravy was really good--everyone raved about the amount of flavor and the "secret" incredient (gingersnaps....)

I then let it sit in the fridge a day - I heard this would make the skin crispy. I used regular molasses. For the rub I used peanut oil instead of olive oil (I had read somewhere that peanut oil browns better) and it was just beautiful! Anyone afraid to brine - this is a great recipe to try.

I was very nervous once I got the brine solution together...it really smelled pretty bad. I almost poured it out. It ended up adding more of a subtle undertone than being overt and was exceptionally good, keeping the bird very juicy. I did not make the gravy from the article, instead using the drippings for a more "traditional" sauce. I used a 15 gallon plastic garbage bag, sealed the bird/brine inside, and kept it in a cooler packed with ice for about 12-15 hours.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner this year. Everyone really loved it and it received lots of compliments. It really was tender and juicy and had a great flavor. I didn't try the gravy because of previous reviewers but after reading the most current reviews, I wish I would have tried it. Definitely a keeper.

So delicious, this will also become a tradition in our household. The gravy was divine, do not let the gingersnaps scare you - truly fabulous!!!!!!!!

This turkey was phenomenal! I did not baste it, nor did I make the gingersnap gravy. I just followed the brining recipe and covered the turkey in the luscious olive oil and herb paste, stuffed it with herbs and vegetables and closed the door until it was done (I did tent it with foil because it browned VERY fast). The meat was so moist, so juicy and so flavorful! The ultimate turkey!!!

Made this as the Thanksgiving Turkey for this year. I was a bit worried about the flavor being a bit too Molasses and salt with the brine but one could barely taste it after it cooked. The meat was perfectly moist and juicy. And the gravy!! Ooooo la la-everyone loved it. The gingersnap flavor did not overpower the taste, it was perfect and a very big hit with the family, including the kids who simply had "cookie gravy". This one went to the top of my Turkey recipes.

I add my praises to everyone else's. This recipe was amazing. My turkey was moist and delicious. The instructions were a bit unclear about using the turkey broth -- other than that, it was easy. Even the brining was a snap. Last year, I used a traditional brine and ended up with a salty turkey... not so with this recipe. The gravy was the best ever. I too was hesitant about the ginger snaps, but it gave the gravy a depth and flavor that was superb. This will be my new holiday standard!

This recipe was amazing. I was a bit skeptical about "Gingersnap Gravy" but thought I'd try it. Everyone raved over the gravy, and it was so easy! I was a bit frustrated over trying to keep the brine in the bags w/ the turkey as they kept leaking. I wound up putting the bird and brine in a med size cooler and stuck 1 and 2 liter bottles around the bird. I had previously filled them with water and frozen them (happend to have them on hand). They Kept Mr. Turkey cool and took up volume to keep the bird covered in brine. Don't be intimidated by cooking your bird breast down and flipping. It's not as hard as it sounds and the rewards are great.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and the family is still talking about it. It is the best turkey recipe I have found and will no doubt make it a Thanksgiving tradition.

Simply awesome! Moist meat, uncomparable to other Thanksgiving turkey recipes. Used regular molasses vs light...gravy was a bit too gingersnappy and a bit overpowering when used for stuffing and other side dishes.

My friend told me about this recipe, we had it at her house a while ago. It was the best turkey I ever tasted - so moist and juicy! No dry meat at all. I made it for Thanksgiving dinner this weekend and the whole family loved it! I will definitely use this recipe again.

I had to try my convection oven and this turkey recipe was scrumptious in it. However, my family wasn't thrilled with the gravy. I won't make the gravy ever again, but the turkey I will redo.

This has to be one of the best Turkey dinners I've ever made so far! The brine definitely made the turkey moist and juicy. The gingersnap gray was out of this world - everybody raved about it. I will surely use this recipe again.

Holy cow - this recipe made a believer out of me this Xmas. No more dried out breast. My family was impressed. Used only 1 cup of salt since I was brining a 11 lb. bird. Great gravy! For dessert a nother 4 forker: Pumpkin bread pudding with caramel sauce (added spiced rum) yum. Both are keepers!

One of the best recipiess for brined turkey I've ever used, my family loves it.

This is one kick a&$ recipe!! We made it for Thanksgiving and then again for a Christmas party with friends and everyone just raved about it. Brining is the best way to do a bird, as good as if not better than deep frying. Highly recommend it.

The turkey and had great flavour and was very moist. I don't even like white meat, but I ate this and it was delicious. I even tried brining a chicken, that was just as great.

I was very sceptical of the gingersnaps and the brining and almost used another recipe. I am glad I changed my mind, it was delicious. Despite the problems I was having my oven, the turkey was very tasty and the gravy was the best I had. The whole dish was a success.

Best turkey ever - moist and sweet and the gravy adds just teh right touch.

I would make this recipe again with a few changes. The turkey was very moist and tasty. The brining seemed to be the cause, plus I tend to hover over the bird for the last hour of baking and pull it from the oven the INSTANT it's done. The gravy was a disappointment. It was nice a brown and thick. But the flavor needed a boost. I added a big douse of dry sherry and after that some proclaimed it the best they'd had. I also found the directions a little vague (perhaps because I was cooking amid Thanksgiving chaos). I found that the stock that I'd poured over the turkey during baking was sufficient amount of liquid. I didn't need any additional stock.

The turkey was very moist, even the white meat was very tender and juicy. We made 12lb turkey, but we reduced the recipe only by a 1/4! Try it!! Well worth the time and effort!

This was the first time I had ever brined a turkey, and I would highly recommend this recipe! The turkey was so moist and all my guests were asking for the gravy recipe! This is a definate keeper!

Yes! The gingersnaps work! And the brining made the most moist and tender turkey I've ever roasted. I was very skeptical about the gingersnaps, but they add wonderful flavor - spicy, but not sweet, and thicken the gravy beautifully. No one would guess you'd crumbled cookies!

Gingersnap Gravy is incredible. I have been making it for over 10 years based on recipes of Paul Prudholme...this one is even better, with the addition of the brining. Try it...you will never go back to traditional gravy again. My guests have loved this...always a surprise, always come back for more

Ummm. Gingersnap gravy?? I have not made this recipe, but this sounds revolting. The ingredients and instructions for the gravy sounds more like an icing than anything else.
