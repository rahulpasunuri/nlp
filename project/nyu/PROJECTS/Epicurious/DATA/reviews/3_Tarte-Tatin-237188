Don't be put off by other reviewers. Follow the recipe and you can't go wrong. This is delicious. Had it with brown sugar ice cream but can't wait to try with chestnut.

Warning: do no try this at home. Gave it one fork only because you cannot give it zero. Bland caramel, lack of other flavors, made me want a cheap dessert at the local truck stop.

This did not work for me. The apples dissolved to mush. Was it my apple type? I used granny smith.

Simple and quick recipe. I love the addition of cider vinegar for extra tartness.

Nothing special about this recipe. Don't think I'll bother with it again.

Had something similar at 11 Madison Park over the holidays. Loved the apple bacon combo. Used a caramel ice cream intead.
