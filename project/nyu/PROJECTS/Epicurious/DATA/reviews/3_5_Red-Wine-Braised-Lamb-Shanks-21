We tend to like our lamb with a sweet red currant sauce, so I added some red currant sauce with port in addition to the wine. Two to three TBSP of it worked well with about a cup of wine for added volume for braising - I halved the recipe as we only needed 2 lamb shanks. It was very good - right balance of acidity from tomatoes and sweetness of currants.

I chose this recipe for it's simplicity and it sure was. The hubby really liked it, so I am glad. The children did not and they usually love my lamb. I am the lamb lover and thought it was boring. Mildly tasty.

Excellence and Ease...Pair it with Mashed Potatoes with Lemon and Chives and some Rice Pilaf and it makes for a sensational meal. Will definitely add it to my entertainment favorites!

Might make it again, probably not.

This dish was as simple as it was tasty and delicious. I had no marjoram, so I used a "sweet" mix of Herbes de Provence that included marjoram and lavender. I browned the meat as in the recipe and used my pressure cooker to cook it (20 mins instead of 2 hours) and it worked wonderfully. 20 more minutes to reduce the sauce and voila! I had it with piping hot polenta with porcini, and of course a glass of that wine.

This recipe represents the path of least resistance to lamby goodness. It isn't exciting to someone who enjoys creative cooking. I took the lamb out and warmed it up for an hour before I seared it. It took twenty to thirty minutes to develop a golden crust on the shanks. Your choice of wine is crucial to the success of this dish since it is about the only thing that carries it off. I chose to oven braise this covered in an 8 qt dutch oven for two hours at 325 degrees. The texture was perfect.

So easy to make, and so tasty (try fresh marjoram). Goes great with polenta.

This dish is very good. My friend who doesn't like shank very much thought it was very good as well.

This was really amazing. Very easy. I added 2 chopped eggplants for the last half of the cooking time. They shrunk down and made kind of a ratattouille (sp?). My friends loved it. Even I was impressed. Much easier than I thought it would be.

I never made lamb shanks before, so thanks a million to the cook who suggested Steven Raichlens' "fat removal method" for the shanks. It was faBULOUS. I also increased the amount of garlic and wine (a red cabernet) taking into account the size of the shanks. I used herbes de provence while braising, but added fresh chopped thyme before serving. The cooking time was about 21/2 hours. My guests raved, even those who were not crazy about lamb. I served w/tiny bolied potatoes and baby carrots. I will definately make again.

I made these last nite and my husband said this is now his favorite dish---I added about 2 handfuls of baby carrots and used Fresh thyme --and then finished baking in the oven at 325 - no need to thicken gravy it was perfect -- I made 2 lamb shanks for the two of us and used about 1/2 of the other ingredients ---absolutely delicious---I'm forwarding this recipe on to my daughter, she was at a fine restaurant last nite and her husband ordered lamb shanks and she was telling me how tender and delicious it was--could not be any better than this recipe.

Delicious! I added carrots, onions and potatoes to the broth the last 1/2 hour and served it as a stew. The next time I make this, I'll braise the lamb a day ahead to enhance the wonderful flavors.

Have never tried cooking lamb shanks before, just enjoyed them at good restaurants. Followed the recipe verbatim, but added a little more garlic (can never have too much!). Tried this recipe out last night before my dinner party next week and I'm now looking forward to knocking my guests' socks off!!

This was a delicious dish with a lot of promise, although I wish the author would have given a measurement for the salt instead of saying to "use it generously". It's possible that I didn't add enough salt at the beginning or maybe I didn't use a rich enough wine, but it somehow tasted a bit flat. Thanks a million to the cook who suggested Steven Raichlens' "fat removal method" for the shanks. It worked like a dream & the end result was a rich lamb dish w/o grease. I doubled the garlic and used a combo of lamb shanks & neck bones. Other than that, I followed the recipe "verbatim", a rarity for me. For those who said that this is a "labor intensive" recipe, I have to wonder HOW that's possible - I left it cooking on the stove for 4 hours - how easy is THAT?! Since we're on Atkins, I served this over cooked spaghetti squash, but I kept wanting a deeper flavor. Again, lack of salt could be the culprit. Perhaps the flavor will improve overnight.

My favorite dish! Keep cooking until lamb starts to fall off the bone, it's worth it! Could be 3 hours depending on size of shanks, so start early. Add more wine or liquid to keep meat from drying out. I keep this recipe on hand for very special occasions! Definately a treasure!

this was super but use steven Raichlens method to get rid of the fat...Put shanks in cold water and bring to boil and cook 3 min. rinse under cold water...cool..and I use akitchen shears to cut off the fat..then continue with the recipe

Absolutely delicious and easy to prepare. It's rather rich, so be prepared!

This was a fabulous recipe! I didn't have any dried marjoram handy so I used fresh oregano and basil from my garden. I served this to my boyfriend and company over mash potatoes and got raves! The lamb took more than 2 hours for the meat to fall off the bones but it was worth the wait!

I made this for my husband last night. He thought the sauce was wonderful. I cook it for just over 2 hours. It could have gone for a bit longer. Will heat up the leftovers for him tonight and cook for another 1/2hour. Served with cheesy polenta and couscous.

This is delicius! Easy to make. Few ingredients-fab flavor! Added carrots & quartered, unpeeled red potatoes the last half hour. Had some lo-fat sour cream from another dinner and served it on the side. Nice touch. Will deifnatly serve it for company.

I am easily intimidated by recipes in Bon Appetit. But I LOVE lamb shanks and wanted to give it a try. OH MY GOODNESS!!! It was Faaaabulous! A simple recipe with an incrediable ending. I totally recommend it. I used Burgandy Wine. I also added a little corn starch to thicken up the sauce. I used my husband as a guinee pig, and he was impressed and thinks I should make it again for company. I WILL!!!

This is one of my all-time faves. I use herbs de provence instead of marjoram, and put in up to a head of whole garlic cloves. I have never tasted a better lamb shank in a restaurant and I order it a lot! I often serve it with thymed orzo.

Tastier the second day after the ingredients have blended together. It seemed like more work than it was worth. The lamb shanks were pretty unattractive after cooking so I cut the meat off the bone. That was a bit time-consuming.

Ho-hum. I used the immersion blender to puree the sauce, leaving a few chunks, but thickening it more than it was after reducing. Nice if you like a slightly more up-scale version of mom's pot roast. Yawn...

First time doing lamb shanks. Cheaper and you get more meat than a chop.Wonderful recipe and easy. My husband loved it and he's not a lamb eater. The sauce was great. This ones a keeper.

This was one of the best meals I have ever made. It was reminiscent of the wonderful Greek food we used to get in Greek Town in Downtown Detroit! I left out the marjoram, add fresh thyme, basil and greek oregano to the simmer and pureed the sauce after cooking the shanks. I didn't need to reduce it any more. My husband LOVED it!

Oh mama! I was trying to recreate a dish prepared by my neighbor's mother, they are from Palestine. I subsituted ghee for the olive oil, omited the marjoram and added peas (plain ol' canned sweet peas) after reducing the sauce. Served over a rice pilaf (made by sauteeing vermicelli in ghee then adding rice)....yum. My grandmother loved it.....and she's suspicious of everyone's cooking (except her's of course).

Beautiful presentation. I omitted the marjoram and added fresh basil from my garden. It serves beautifully. I also used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Very tender and very good!

We love lamb shanks!!!!!!!!! If you have a built-in grill, brown the shanks well on the grill, allowing the fat to drain off. Go heavy on the garlic and add some cinnamon and bay leaves to the braise. "Braise" in a cooking bag. No Clean-up! Less fat. Great with noodles, mashed potatoes, or rice. If you make it with noodles or rice, (re-) cook the shanks in a casserole or pan with the starch so the starch will absorb the flavors of the lamb and jus. MM

This was great tasting. It took a little longer than two hours for the lamb to become falling-off-the-bone tender. I used thyme and oregano in place of the majoram because I like their flavors better and added extra garlic. The sauce cooked down to a very nice consistency. I served this with wedges of grilled polenta and steamed asparagus and it just disappeared. This will become my lamb shank standard recipe.

This dish was very simple - easy ingredients to buy and very labor intensive. So easy, but tasted fabulous. I definitely would make it again and even serve it to company. My husband loved it and would like me to make it for his parents.

Fantastic recipe, although my sauce never quite got to the consistency I wanted (though I simmered for 2 1/2 hours and boiled uncovered for 20 more minutes). No matter- it was absolutely delicious. Served with creamy risotto.

Excellent way to enjoy lamb shanks. I didn't alter a thing and it turned out super. Served this to a friend and he said it was exactly the way his Portuguese grandma used to make it. He has been trying to duplicate this for years. Served it with curry couscous and the flavors blended well.

This is a great recipe...especially since the ingredients are simple and easy to find. . .I served it for Thanksgiving. Of course, I always make slight alterations and in this case, strained all the tomatoes & herbs after 2 1/2 hours of simmering; then added a can of beef broth and a can of chicken broth and continued to reduce the sauce to half. . .it definitely enhanced the taste!

This is a great dish. I made it as is with no additions or substitutions, which I rarely do. It was very good and very easy to prepare. I served it with risotto and acorn squash. Delicious.

This was very delicious, but two cups of wine and a large can of tomatoes wouldn't fit in my large skillet with the lamb shanks. I had to transfer to a dutch oven. Came out fantastic!

This was delicious. I used 2 cups of Merlot for the red wine, but I think burgundy may have worked out better. I also added about a tsp. of fresh finely chopped rosemary along with the marjoram and served it with garlic mashed potatoes which was nice with all the extra sauce.

absolutly amazing! Soo easy, but it tastes like it was intricate. I took the advise of others and did 2 cups of red wine. I also used fresh marjoram instead of dried. I can't wait to have a dinner party -this is definitly the recipe!

When I try out a new recipe, there is one question on my mind...Would I serve this to company? The answer to that is YES! This is a wonderful dish that takes little time to prepare and cooks for 3 hours (I added 2 cups wine also). Served with a creamy risotto and steamed carrots, I look forward to making it again.

Nice, but lamb braised simply in port has more oomph. Some modifications: use a non-stick pan, if possible, or else add more olive oil. And if marjoram isn't available, oregano will do.

This inexpensive and easy recipe was a huge success! The lamb just falls right off the bone. Tips... use 2 cups of dry red wine (instead of 1 1/2 cups), simmer, covered, on very low heat for 2 1/2 to 3 hours (instead of just 2). Perfect served over plain couscous and accompanied with fresh asparagus!
