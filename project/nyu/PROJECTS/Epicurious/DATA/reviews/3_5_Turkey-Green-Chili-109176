This is a favorite chili recipe in our house. It is time consuming but well worth it because of the unique flavor. The roasted poblanos are key. I use boneless chicken thighs for the meat. Double the recipe and freeze some -- it is that good.

This has been my "go to" chili recipe for years, everyone loves it. I serve it mild or hot depending on my guests preferences. It is time consuming , but well worth it. I use ground turkey or pieces of cut up turkey that are not on the bone as it is easier to eat.

I used chicken thighs instead of turkey (and inadvertently left out the diced tomatoes), and it turned out very tasty! Very time consuming, though, due to charring and peeling the chilis and deboning the chicken (next time, I'd definitely use boneless chicken -- and maybe even canned chilis).

I don't know, this just wasn't as good as I expected. I did make it with chicken thighs. Maybe that had something to do with it. It just lacked something. Was kind of hard to finish.

I thought this dish was excellent. Having lived in New Mexico for awhile it reminded me of those days. Always a crowd pleaser, I always use extra poblanos.

Not horrible, but not the chili verde recipe I was hoping for either. Tomatoes didn't seem right to me but I used them anyway. That was the recipe breaker. Not a repeat for me.

I prepared this recipe according to the recipe using half the holiday turkey I received from my company. I prepared the dish in my slow cooker set on low for 8 hours. The dish was excellent. Everyone loved it. The mix of white and dark meat was perfect. It had great flavor. Roast turkey always becomes turkey salad or hash after the holiday; because, no one want to eat it. We celebrated with a pot-luck dinner the day before the holiday and relaxed together the day after. All the turkey green chili disappeared.

Delicious! The recipe fed 8 very healthy eaters with not much left over. A real crowd pleaser.

I prepared this dish for dinner with friends and it was VERY well recieved. I prepared mine with chicken as that was what I had on hand and it turned out great. I also added extra jalpenos and served with cheese alongside for those who like it that way. We'll be eating this again soon!
