This made a large batch of steamed rice more special for a group eating Indian food. Added thyme, parsley, and a little frest lime zest with the butter. Chopped it all up with the butter in a magic bullet. I'd add more next time for some more zing.

Really good, a nice idea instead of plain old rice. I have a picky family and never know what to make for starchy dishes, but this one satisfied everybody, even our one year-old, and is great sonce I can use any combination of fresh herbs from my garden. Chives, parsley, and thyme are an excellent combination and were delicious with glazed salmon with mustard-dill sauce.

This dish is hard to screw up, but the types of herbs you use make a big difference in overall flavor. Lemon thyme and chives are my favorite combination, but my lemon thyme died, so I've also used some lemon zest and regular thyme to try to replicate the flavor. Parsley also works well.

I made the herbed rice with dill as my main herb. Dill does wonders for rice. I didnt have Jasmine Rice and used long grain white rice instead. In addition, I added parsley and thyme. Unfortunately I added a bit more salted butter and added more salt to give it some flavour.

This recipe added some much-needed umph to my standard rice side dish. I cooked the rice in a steamer but followed the rest of the recipe. Thyme and chives worked well together, but I think I'll use less of the herbs next time to let the flavor of the rice come through more.
