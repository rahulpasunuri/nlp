My husband and I thought this was delicious. I made it as written with exception of adding some steamed green beans that need to be use up. Red and orange peppers. It looked beautiful. You must cook the onions and peppers until caramelized. A good feta is also important. In reading other reviews I made sure to add all of the reserved pasta water to make sure it was moist. The dill was in no way overpowering. Did people use a compacted 1/4 cup? I used a "loose" 1/4 cup.

Tastes like a pickle. Really nothing but dill. So yourself a favor and use something like basil instead. Also tried tossing some sopresatta in but it was lost in the ocean of dill like every other flavor.

I substituted miso for anchovy paste and used a yellow, an orange, and a red pepper instead of three red. The results were delicious (especially the next day) and I loved how quick and easy this was.

Loved it - but make sure you plate this up right away, the feta will get lost and the dish will be dry.

I was intrigued by this recipe as I sought a dish which would incorporate the many onions just harvested from our garden. Carmelization is crucial, as many have noted...a buttery base for the other yummy ingredients. Alas, no dill--but cilantro ably filled the bill--only low fat feta,& (14oz.)whole wheat (organic) pasta. Finally, I substituted veggie broth for the pasta water and added a quarter teaspoon red pepper flakes. Wow, creamy and delicious!!

Excellent. Do take the time to prepare onions and peppers as directed. A great one-dish dinner during the hectic work week.

This was delicious. I bought red bell peppers and dill just for this recipe. When I unpacked all the groceries, didn't find the dill. Undaunted, I used a combination of parsley and cilantro. I'll bet other fresh herbs could be substituted too. Used a tsp. mashed anchovies, which I had on hand, instead of paste. The initial sweating of the onions and peppers, followed by their braising, is imperative to develop the melting sweetness that blends so well with the salty sharpness of the feta. This was enough for a whole pound of rotini, by the way.

I knew right away just looking at the ingredients that this was going to be very good. It is not a typical "Italian" pasta recipe. The taste is a little unusual, but the texture and the taste are wonderful. If cooked properly, the mixture of onions, peppers, dill and feta melt together and taste just right. It is important to take the time to simmer the onions and peppers as described in the recipe. I will certainy make it again.

I really wanted to give this a ZERO. Yuck.
