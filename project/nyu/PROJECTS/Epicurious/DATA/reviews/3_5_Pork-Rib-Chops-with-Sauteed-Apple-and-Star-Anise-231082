This was a great dinner for rolling in late after skating at the beach and having my nails done! Quick, easy and delish!

Apparently I don't know how to melt butter or caramelize apples. I added the butter and brown sugar to a hot pan after I took out the pork chops and drained the drippings, and the butter and sugar started to burn before I could turn the pan heat on high to melt the butter. I added the apples anyways, and they got black and gooey. My kitchen got smoky. My 6 month old son started to scream. One fork for still knowing how to pan fry a pork chop.

I don't know, this was my first time carmelizing apples, but this recipe has you putting butter and brown sugar in an already heated pan, and turning it on high to melt the butter. I avoided turning the open on high, because immediately when I put the brown sugar and butter in, it burnt, and the apples splashed hot grease on my arms when i put them in the pan. They were caked with blackness, and the house got really smoky and my 6 month old started screaming. I was trying to impress my girlfriend by cooking with a recipe, to offer her something else besides the usual flavors. This recipe makes me want to stick to my mexican food.

WOW. From all the rave reviews, I expected to bring down the house. And that I did. It brought everyone down. My boyfriend even said the first bite "Took his breath away", and NOT in a good way. So I will definately not be making this again. Good thing I made back up Shake-N-Bake.

Wonderful dish! My husband is an excellent cook so I always try to impress him. This dish did the trick, and it was so easy! I used anise seed instead of star anise - and I substituted sweet white wine for the apple juice. It was just really really yummy.

We made the apple/star anise topping and used it on roasted pork loin. It was great -- traditional yet with a twist of something special. I would use this topping for all sorts of other things -- even on a coffeecake.

Very good...and also flexible. I didn't have the star anise, the apple cider, or the cider vinegar. So, I used a bit of allspice, white wine and balsamic vinegar, and it was very tasty. Served it over fennel mashed potatoes with snipped chives and with a side of steamed broccoli. Great rainy day comfort food!

This was excellent. And the first time I have truly enjoyed star anise in a dish! It worked perfectly in this combination.

This is a great simple dinner meal. Fast, flavorful, and best of all, you dont have to shop for a million ingredients. I didnt have the anise, but - it still tasted great! Would definately make again!

This is definately a keeper. Incredible flavor and very welcomed response from diners. Only thing I did different from original recipe is I used Calvados and cinnamon instead of vinegar and added a little garlic powder to seasoning on chops. Excellent! Highly recommend. Oh, and used thick Pork loin chops instead of rib chops.

I used some other types of apples, one was yellow delicious and I am not sure of the other. I had no apple juice so I substituted a white semi dry wine. the results were great. Good recipe that we will have again. Best part is that no shopping for ingredients was required.

I made this tonight and it was surprisingly good. I was a little aprehensive at first with the combination of apples and pork, but the sweet and tangy fruit complimented the meat very well! My pork chops were about an inch thick so it took about 10 minutes per side. I also used rice wine vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar and I'm considering using less butter next time. Great recipe, but I gave it 3 forks because it was a bit greasy. The dish went well with steamed jasmine rice and salad!

A seared thick pork chop on a bed of carmelized apples with a hint of star anise on a cool winter evening is such a soothing and pleasurable treat. It is a simple meal to make during the week, but one that is savory and full of flavor plus comfort. This got all forks up from my family (and all tails up from the dogs who got any left over scraps) and has been requested weekly since it was first introduced.

This is a wonderful way to serve pork. Perfect for any season, especially the fall. Very quick and easy to make and a nice harmony of flavors. I used pork loin (will try grilling it next time)instead of ribs and liked the apple/meat combination with each bite. Couldn't find star anise, but found in the McCormick section of the spice aisle a bottle of anise seed in which I only used 1/2 tsp.--any more would be overpowering, but it certainly made the dish. Was worth buying the bottle since I'll be making this again if only to just put the sauce over ice cream like someone suggested. Had a lot of leftover apple; will try just using 1 next time.

My family also loved this! I didn't have the star anise, but it was still delicious. I also used spiced apple cider instead of the juice, and used at least one cup. To save time, after the initial browning of the chops, I just added the cider and apples to the pan while the chops cooked. When they were done, I reduced the cider even further. Yum!

I made this on two occasions. The first was for my husband and he loved it! The second was with my mother for a holiday get together and everyone had great comments about it! The Star Anise gives a great flavor that isn't found in many dishes I have experienced. Make it and you will love it!!!

Excellent twist on pork chops with apples! Deglazed with white wine instead of apple juice, which was great with the apple cider vinegar.

I made this recipe without the star anise (because I didnt have any) and we still enjoyed it very much. I used a spiced apple cider instead of the apple juice which gave it a little more spice. If you just made the carmelized apples and put them over ice cream... yumm...

The recipe was easy to make and very tasty - I've put it in my recipe box. The star anise might be a bit hard to find so you may not want to wait till the last minute to shop for the ingrediants.
