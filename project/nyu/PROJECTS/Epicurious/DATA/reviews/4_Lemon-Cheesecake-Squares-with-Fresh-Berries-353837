Prepared these a day ahead for an Inauguration Day party. Cut them into one inch squares, plated them so I had about two dozen, adhered a raspberry on top of each square with a dab of sour cream. Absolutely so easy to make, quite tasty,and a terrific visual presentation! Might add another teaspoon of grated lemon peel next time. B.J. Harrick

Oh, and I doubled the filling too, even better.

This went over really well and there's not too much sugar in the recipe. I made a blackberry and sugar sauce for topping.

This was a very agreeable, easy, portable dessert to bring to a summer barbecue. I made the recipe as directed, except I used the Microplaned peel of the entire lemon, which was more than two tsp. I used a little sour cream to affix the raspberries to the bars.

Very good and easy to make. Disappeared quickly at a BBQ. My only complaint is the ratio of cheesecake:crust--they are almost 50/50. Next time I will reduce the amount of crust.

Made this is for Easter dinner. I too doubled the filling recipe and added additional lemon peel, as I love lemons! I used a gingersnap hazelnut crust that complimented the cheesecake very well. Served it with real whipped cream and raspberries. This is just a whole lot of yum!!

Easy and yummy when you don't want to go through the hassle and wait of making a full cheesecake. Recipe is fine without doubling, but if you want more cheesecake then double it.

This recipe is REALLY good, I gave it a 3 because it didn't quite have that lemony punch I was hoping for. Next time I might try subbing lemon extract for the vanilla and doubling the filling as someone else recommended because the crust was about as thick as the cheesecake. What I think would really make this recipe 4 forks would be to add a layer of tart lemon curd over the cheesecake. I will be making this one again - just with a few modifications!

These get rave reviews each time I make them. Delicious and easy.

About to bake these for the third time this summer. A beautiful and tasty party dessert. I put a small dot of whipped cream to hold the berries on - otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Great recipe! Perfect for picnics and other summer gatherings. Everyone loves these cheesecake squares. I also doubled the filling which was a good recommendation.

Nice and easy. It was a very simple recipe to make and pretty quick with all the prep time. I pressed down the crust with a flat bottomed glass before placing it in the oven to bake (from a cheesecake recipe I make). Added plenty strawberries and blueberries for a pre-Fourth of July party. Everyone enjoyed.

Not good, not great. Very easy, but just okay.

Simple and delicious. I made these with a ginger snap crust (instead of the graham cracker) and though the ginger-lemon combo was perfect. My baking time was a little less than stated, so watch these carefully.

This was my first time ever making cheesecake but with this recipe it will definitely not be the last!!! This was so smooth and creamy... When I went to pick up my ingredients I thought to myself... hmmm... if this can be done with lemon could you do it with LIME as well? YES, you can!!! I ended up making 2 - one with the lemon and the other with lime and they were both great!!

I love this recipe b/c it's fast, easy, can be made ahead and tastes wonderful. Made it following the recipe to the letter (very unusual for me). It serves up just like the photo - just be sure to keep rinsing/wiping your knife in hot water before slicing. I sliced them into 32 tiny squares, w/ 1 blackberry each, to serve on a dessert buffet. I don't think doubling the filling is necessary.

Wonderful! And so easy! I'd never made a cheesecake before, and this turned out perfectly.

HELP!!! I'm not sure if I'm reading this right? I have never cooked this kind of thing before and it says 9 whole graham crackers...does that just mean 9 regular squares because it doesn't seem like that many for the crust. I tried with 9 squares and the crust just barely covered the bottom of the pan.

Delicious and not very difficult to make. I made this recipe for a party and every last one was snapped up.

Very, very good. I doubled the recipe (both crust and filling) and baked it in a 9 x 13" pan for 40 minutes. I also topped it with a sour cream and sugar topping, which worked well with the fresh berries I put on top. Delicious--great blend of tart and sweet and crunchy. I recommend this recipe.

I made these for a Bridal Shower tea party - huge hit! Very easy and SO delicious. I added a little dollop of sour cream on top to hold the berries in place. A perfect finger-food dessert. I think I'll make them during the holidays for parties.

I doubled the amount of lemon juice to make the flavor more tart. I also used non-fat sour cream and light whipped cream cheese to make these healthier and they tasted great. Everyone loved them. I used two less graham crackers and more butter to bind them together and it was quite enough to fill the pan.

Very good. The lemon taste is excellent and I made them as mini cheesecakes with fresh blackberries and used some of the cream on top of the cooked cream cake and placed the berries on top. Everyone loved them. I did too. :)

If you are considering making this recipe - stop thinking about it and just give it a try. It is easy to make, the squares look very pretty on a colored platter with berries strewn across the top, and when I made them for a picnic, they were a huge hit with both adults and children. I think they would also be great with a raspberry coulis. I think the topping thickness is fine, it makes them more bar like than cake like, and thus finger food possible.

So yummy and so easy! A big hit - even for a non-baker like myself!

Excellent and extremely easy! I took these to a party and had to hide a few to make sure my husband got one. The recipe only yields 16 small squares, so be sure to make a lot if you're serving a large group.

Rating: 4
The filling definitely needs to be doubled! Otherwise, the squares look flat and skimpy when served. Delicious tasting dessert!

Was served this dessert with fresh raspberries at a potluck and they were simple, light and very tasty - the hit of the party! Perfect size and amount after a big meal.

We had a Birthday Bash at work, and instead of flocking toward the typical cake treat, I decided to give these squares a go and they were a definite hit! I added 2 1/2 tbsp. instead of 2 tbsp., simply because I love the zest of lemon in cheesecake, but otherwise, I followed the recipe word-for-word!

This is such a fantastically simple recipe, but it packs the best cheesecake punch for the buck! It was a smashing success at a recent BBQ party! They were gone in less than a minute! This will be one of my go-to recipes from now on. A perfect, simple dessert.

Light and fresh tasting. We're trying to stay away from desserts entirely, but couldn't resist this recipe. It has dramatically less sugar than a similar recipe I saw on Food Network. Not too sweet,absolutely delicious!

I made this twice now, just as the recipe is written. The first time I served with blackberries, and the second with blueberries and strawberries combined. It was a big hit both times. It's easy to make, can be made the day ahead, and everyone loves it! A great recipe.

delicious and simple. served with bluberries and strawberries and it was a hit with both adults and children. followed other reviewers suggestions and doubled the filling recipe. will definitely make again.

I like rhonda2too's idea of using a round cutter to resemble mini cheesecakes. a good way to make it a little chi-chi fancy. And it also means tons of leftover sections to snack on. :)

Quick, easy. Amount of filling adequate. Macerated strawberries with a bit of sugar and additional lemon zest for topping.

I made this with fresh strawberries and blueberries for the 4th of July. Everyone loved it! I thought the amount of filling was great, but sometime I might try making 1.5x the filling recipe... I forgot about the cheesecake in the oven so it cooked 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for, but it turned out perfectly.

Just got my new mag and need to take a simple desert to friends for dinner. I think I ate too many though. These are delicious especially on top of fresh strawberry season. Very easy, refreshing and sort of healthy with low fat cream cheese and low fat grahams. Just enough filling.

This recipe is easy! and tastes good! However, you must double the filling recipe!!!!!

So good and SO easy.. I didn't have any graham crackers, so I made a shortbread type crust from another bar recipe and it was great. The berries taste fabulous with this bar.

Rating: 3
Extremely simple recipe -- a plus! Crushed graham crackers in food processor to cut down on the mess. I would double the cheesecake portion of the recipe next time as the ratio of crust to filling seemed out of balance. Simple, easy, tasty, and elegant with the right berries. Cut out with a round cutter to resemble mini cheesecakes.
