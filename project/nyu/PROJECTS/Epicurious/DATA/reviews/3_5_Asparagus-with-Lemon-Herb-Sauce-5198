Family and friends raved over this sauce, which was made more or less to the recipe. I found it to be a fantastic way to serve asparagus, and the sauce is quite complementary, without overpowering the asparagus.

Made this side dish for supper club..alot of flavors going on.next time I'd simplify it....I did serve it hot so there was alot of last minute prep..but most enjoyed it.

Nice change from regular steamed asparagus. I liked it!

This was a good summer recipe. The only change that I would make would be to cut down on the amount of onions and shallots. I found that about half the amounts of both would suffice.

I've made this twice. The first time I thought it was just okay, last night we thought it was great. I reduced the recipe for 2 and didn't really have to reduce it down much. I left it on a small burner on very low and it was a perfect consistency when it was served. The red pepper adds a nice colorful touch.

Gotta agree with St Paul, MN (05-01-00) about the sauce. It was overwhelming -- and the sauteed green onions looked overcooked and drab. I suspect that with a little tinkering, this could be a good recipe, but not as it is now. I won't make it again.

A bit labor-intensive but my favorite holiday asparagus dish! All the prep can be done ahead of time. Whole family likes it, even those who "hate" asparagus. I serve the dish hot.

This is an excellent side dish for entertaining - it can be prepared in advance and assembled just before serving. It's been a hit each time I've served it.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and served it at room temperature as part of our buffet table. It was delicious and it went over very well with our guests. I personally prefer hot vegetables, but nobody else seemed to mind and I received many compliments on it. The lightness of this dish was a nice contrast to the other rich dishes that are traditionally served at Thanksgiving.

I made it for Thanksgiving. I had my doubts while it was cooking, but I served it at room temperature and it was good. Received many compliments.

Lovely dish presentation. I would serve it hot next time, as my company wasn't sure that it was an unchilled salad or tepid side dish. I had it leftover cold the next day and it was fabulous as a cold salad, too! Beautiful Easter dish!

This recipe is one of my favorites - we have it at Easter every year and it's enjoyed by all. The sauce is delicious over the asparagus. The only thing that I change is to serve both the asparagus and the sauce hot, not at room temperature. I make the sauce ahead of time and warm it in the microwave before serving.

Didn't like the fact that it was not hot. A bit labor intensive. Not all that great for all the effort.

Absolute heaven. Good warm or cold. Addictive if you are an asparagus fan--and even if you're not. Esp pretty for Christmas dinner with the red peppers on the green asparagus.

Served this with grilled salmon on Mothers Day - absoultely fantastic. My Mother and my Mother-in-law requested the recipe. I used only 1/2 the oil and added a little extra mustard. Looks great on a buffet!

Beautiful on the place -- just like the picture. Will definitely make again for summer buffets. Lots of chopping, but it was worth it.

This is a very bland but sour recipe. Most of your other asparagus recipes are much better

I thought this was a great side dish. The lemon and mustard in the sauce was nice with the asparagus.

Maybe it was because I didn't prepare everything in advance for the dinner, but I found all the chopping a bit time consuming. However, the flavor of this dish was excellent and next time I'll do all the chopping beforehand.

Very good! I made this for my Supper Club last year and got great comments. I presented it on a white serving platter just like on the cover of Bon Appetit magazine. It was as beautiful as it was tasty.

This is a great summer dish! I served it with the garlic and lime shrimp and it was excellent! This would be a great and easy side dish when serving a large group. I will make this again!! A+

I found the sauce to overwhelm the asparagus. A delicate lemon/butter sauce would have been better.

THis was a big surprise. I picked it out at the last minute. It was fabulous. I served Honey baked ham & scalloped potatoes with this dish for easter and surprising enough it didn't kill the wonderful Duckhorn pinot we served with it. And it it easy to do.

When this first was published, I served it at a baby shower brunch - one of my guests recognized it as your cover recipe. But, more importantly, everyone loved this dish. I make it every year when the Washington state asparagus is in season.

I made this for Easter 1998 when the recipe was first published and have made it many times since. Not only does it taste wonderful, but it can be prepared ahead of time and the presentation is beautiful. One of my favorites from Bon Appetit.

This was a perfect side to make with my main entree which was salmon with dill, capers,lemon, etc. Very complimentary to the fish and lemon taste.

I'm very surprised at that last review. I have been making this regularly since the magazine came out, and everyone loves it. The one varition that is best - cook the bell peppers with the sauce, leave out the green onion & lemon peel, add some pepper & serve hot. YUM. No leftovers ever.

i really didn't like this recipe. the sauce was bland and somewhat watery.

I omitted the oil and sauteed the vegetables in a non-stick pan with Pam, so it was virtually fat free. I concur with the other reviews: it was easy, delicious, and was one of the few things I've ever made that looked EXACTLY like the photo!

Excellent! It is a very tasty and easy side dish that can be prepared ahead. Looks great too. There were no negative comments and I have had several requests for a repeat, which I am doing this Easter.
