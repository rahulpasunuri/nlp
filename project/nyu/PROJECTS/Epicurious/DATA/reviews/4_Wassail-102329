We made this for a neighborhood holiday party omitting the eggs and it was the HIT of the party. Easy to drink but warn your guests that it is high octane. We were glad that guests could walk home.

OH HOLY NIGHT! This recipe will knock your socks off! I brought it to work for my Christmas party and I'd never seen my coworkers so merry. I left out the egg too. I tried a small batch with the egg and it really doesn't look very appealing.

We've made this at our holiday party for the past two years. Our guests love it---it's perfect for the holidays. We also omitted the eggs---it's great without it.

I made a big batch, bottled it, and gave it as stocking stuffers. People loved it.

High-octane holiday party beverage. My friends ask for this EVERY year - and it's always the first thing to go. I omit the eggs - I've made it both ways - the frothed up eggs don't help the presentation at all. Looks like pondscum. Definitely not a holiday drink for the lightweight - but VERY well received.
