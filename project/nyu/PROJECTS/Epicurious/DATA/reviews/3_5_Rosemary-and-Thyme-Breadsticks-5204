I prefer my bread sticks to be more bread-like so I kept checking on them. I pulled several batches out at different times between 15 minutes and 25 minutes into the baking cycle. Those that baked for about 18-20 minutes had hint of golden brown color on top and were soft and chewy with the familiar bread texture. Those that were baked for about 23-25 minutes were a darker gold with a hint of crispiness on the outside while still chewy and bread- like on the inside. Before baking I also sprayed the bread sticks with a bit of extra virgin olive oil for added texture and flavor. Since I was using dried spices, I increased the amoutns from 1 tsp to 1-1/2 tsp P.S. Don't mess with the salt content too much. The bread sticks start to get too salty at about 2 tsp and start lack flavor when the salt is reduced to less than 1-1/2 tsp.

I used dried rosemary and thyme and probably added more than a tablespoon. These breadsticks do turn out very crunchy, not what you would expect for a "dinner-type" breadstick, but they make the perfect snack and taste great, not to mention they smell delicious when baking!

My breadsticks turned out to be rather pencil-like and very crispy. I usually prefer my breadsticks softer and more breadlike. I don't know if I did something wrong or if the recipe was supposed to be this way. They tasted fine, though.

Great tasting and so easy!Just as good with 1 tsp each dried spices.
