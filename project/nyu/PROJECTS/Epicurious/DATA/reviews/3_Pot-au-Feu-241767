I like this recipe, having made it several times. However, I've decided to skip the browning in the future--I aesthetically prefer a clear beef broth vs. a darker one, which the browning gives. To the reviewer below--you want to discard the broth that was used to cook the marrow because it will be muddy and lumpy from the blood in the marrow bones, unless you soaked them first overnight, which I prefer. Overall, if you soak the roast in cold water overnight in the fridge, you will get a cleaner broth, and you won't have to do the skimming.

Other variations of this recipe are quite a bit simpler. The Beef not being browned, but poached along with all the ingredients from the start Also, the broth does not need to be discarded, According to tradition, it is served as a soup starter.

I haven't tried this one; I use one I got in a book written by Henri Toulouse-Lautrec who, in addition to doing nice drawings, was a killer cook. However, I'm revising tonight based on this read. I am with jfain on the topic of tough chuck: overbrowning (dry) or under braising would leave a tough product. To cut down fat (anathema to Toulouse Lautrec), I eliminate the ribs. This recipe is very interesting to me, in that it uses roasted vegetables. I don't understand the unpeeled onions; onion peels in food? Interesting, or maybe I read it wrong. This recipe has a powerfully earthy sense about it.

Just a question ... Why discard the broth after cooking the marrow bones? I mean, there's a full quart of slowly simmered, tasty broth there that, to my mind, would only be enhanced by stewing the marrow bones in it. Why not pour it back into the main pot just before serving?

To gordonpong from seattle, you scoop out the marrow and spread it on a slice of baguette. I used to know a guy who liked to butter his bread first, then spread it with marrow.

I haven't tried this yet, but it reminds me of a dish my parents use to make. We would make beef barley soup like this, but with just the marrow bones and veggies. I haven't had this in years, and I like this recipe. Just think of the choleseral levels.

i haven't made this recipe but it looks legit. probable mistakes that you might have made: didn't roast meat properly, adjusted cooking time incorrectly (cooked shorter amount of time, thinking that it's lighter instead of increasing because bones conduct heat), or bought cheap meat that wasn't aged properly. Cooking times for dishes like this vary wildly depending on humidity and elevation. Not cooking it enough will not allow the connective tissues in the meat to dissolve properly. Try it again. Good luck!

Hello cook from Los Osos. chuck would be tough if the meat got too dried out during cooking. Chuck wants a low slow method of cooking. It may be that your roast got too browned in the pan before you put it in the pot. I hope that helps.

You probably adjusted the cooking time down. Short ribs and chuck roast need a very long cooking time to tenderize, hence the 3 hour recommended cook time. If the meat is tough, keep on cooking.

I could use some help here from you more exerienced cooks. I followed the recipe exactly, the only exception being none of my local stores had a bone-in chuck roast so I had to use boneless. I tried to adjust the cooking time accordingly, but the meat came out tough. Is it the salt? Can someone help me? I was really disappointed with the result, but I'm hoping it was something I did wrong, not the recipe.
