This had a very fall flavor, almost more like cranberries than plums. If I were to make again I would use prune plums rather than the normal red/black plums. It was nice a creamy and it a perfect low fat dessert.

The active time on this recipe is probably closer to 40 minutes. It is amazing--great for a dinner party. But _not_ cheap.

VERY good. I omitted the wine and ended up with a half-batch, but it is very good. Also added some cinnamon past the cinnamon stick, and I added fresh blackberries right at the end. I guess this makes it less of a sorbet, but the extra fruit added a nice zing and was an all-around interesting addition. Highly recommend this recipe.

Substituted frozen cherries instead of plums. 1\2 cup sugar as suggested by reviewers. Absolutely decadent! Haagen Daas, lookout!

i actually omitted the red wine the second and third times i made this and it was absolute heaven. there is nothing better than rich, dark plums boiled until fallen apart and then frozen into this concoction. i crave it.

I had made plum wine that I don't care for at all, so decided to try and use some of it up in this recipe. What a great idea! It was delicious. I boiled the sugar, water, cinnamon (two 2" sticks), and peppercorns together. Then let it cool and stirred in the plum wine and lemon. Let it meld together overnight, then put it in the ice cream maker. If anything, the only thing I would change is to use less cinnamon. It wasn't too sweet for me, but my plum wine might be less sweet than straight plums.

I agree with both previous reviewers that only 1/2 cup sugar is needed. I made this for friends who loved it, and I found it tasty, but too sweet.

I, too, found this too sweet--much too sweet. Instead of tasting of fruit, it tasted primarily of sugar. I expect that reducing the sugar will make it less smooth, but when I make it again--it's worth making if only for the stunning color!--I will cut the sugar to 1/2 c. The peppercorns add an intriguing extra element to the sorbet.

This sorbet tasted like Christmas. I found it a little too sweet but my friends loved it. I made two plum sorbet recipes at the same time. The second plum sorbet recipe was also from this site, it was the one that had Kirsch in it. This was the one that I liked better even though the texture was granier. However the "Plum & Red Wine Sorbet" was the winner in our little taste test. I'll only make this again if someone specifically requests it.
