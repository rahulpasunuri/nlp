The makings of a memorable and relatively inexpensive meal. This is part of our regular rotation, but I still can't seem to make it enough to satisfy everyone. A crusty baguette is a must.

I add more garlic and lemon and omit the tomatoes. It is perfect every time - and a crowd pleaser, too!

Perfect as written (okay, I confess, I added more lemon and more garlic). Still, delicious. We have served this to guests a few times and always get rave reviews. Some people have literally sucked on the shells.

XNT! I did not have fennel on hand so I added a few shakes of curry powder and it was fabulous! Pinot Grigio was the recommended white wine from the wine store, FYI. I used a cheap one ($5.) and it was perfect.

This recipe was great! I changed the tomatoes out and used a can of roasted tomatoes, that I cooked with the onion and garlic for about 30 min extra. I also used a teaspoon of sirracha, sherry vinegar and some paprika. The group I served it to said hands down the best mussels they have had in ages. Served it with garlic texas toast to "sop". Sooooo yummy.

Delicious, but next time I would cut back on the fennel seed, husband isn't a fan and I have to agree it can be a little overpowering. At the end I tossed chopped fresh tomatoes into the broth for 30 seconds to stew before pouring over the mussels. Don't skimp on the fresh parsley or the lemon--really yummy. I think a variation with capers might be a possibility.

Awesome. Rave reviews from friends. Licking the bowl - amazing broth. I forgot the tomatoes but they weren't missed.

I wanted to find a recipe using white wine and this was perfect. I had all the ingredients on hand and it was yummy and easy.

I have always loved mussels and this was a first attempt at home, and was far better than many restaurant versions. The fennel seed is a must and made the dish. The perfect amount of spiciness combined with the red pepper. Added 2 extra cloves of garlic, because we love garlic, and the only mistake I made was not having enough bread to sop up the amazing broth. May consider reducing the sauce further throwing in a bit of butter to finish and serving over linguini.

delicious! used fresh fennel sprigs instead of the parsley and everyone loved it! Easy recipe - will definitely make again.

I used this recipe in my first attempt at making mussels and it turned out exceptionally. Even my dad, a big mussel eater, loved them! Like others hae said, no fennel or tomatoes, didn't miss them. Just don't add too much lemon if you don't love it because I added 3 slices at it could have been too much.

I like to add diced red bell peppers with the diced tomatoes.

delicious! no fennel seeds on hand...but still very tasty. used a whole onion, and next time will double the garlic, cannot be too much garlic! Also, a good squeeze of lemon is required to bring out the tang in the broth. can easily be made without the tomatoes.

This was incredibly easy and amazingly satisfying. The pot never made it to the table; my boyfriend and I simply stood at the stove with forks and chunks of bread. How bohemian! Didn't have tomatoes but didn't miss them either.

I did not have fennel seeds, but the recipe still came out absolutely delicious! Similar to some of the other reviewers, I traded the fresh tomatoes for paste (1 tsp) and threw in a couple of lobster tails a few minutes before adding the mussels. The end result was heavenly. Deliciously spicy, and not a mussel was left over. The three of us polished off 4 pounds, with a side of french fries. This one's definitely a keeper!

Delicious and easy! Made it exactly as written; next time I'll omit the tomatoes - they didn't really add anything for me. Make sure you have plenty of bread to sop up the sauce!

For a healthy improvement cut the oil in half. Add a cup of chopped mushrooms and/or carrots to liven up the broth.

This is my first review. This has been one of the few dishes that I feel compelled to share with the rest of the world. This is fabulous. Don't skimp on the fennel seeds; they make the dish. My only suggestion would be adding some chorizo for added yummy bonus to the broth.

This was my first time making mussels and this recipe was sooo good. I am a huge fan of mussels in delicious broth and this one is perfect. I did substitute shallots for onion and tarragon for parsley, which I would probably do again next time. We didn't quite use a pound of mussels since we accidentally suffocated some--whoops. Like I said, first time. I think the care of the mussels between seafood counter and steaming pot of broth is probably the hardest thing you'll have to deal with. Lesson learned!

This was so good, I could not focus on dinner conversation while I was eating it! I added shallots, more garlic, and about 1/4 c strained tomato sauce to the wine mixture. Before adding the mussels, I put in a couple lobster tails, cooked for about 3 minutes, then added the mussels.

Rating: 4
we made a number of small mistakes in the preparation and it was still delicious. next time, we would add more onion and garlic, saute a little longer, maybe add some slivered mushrooms. with the parsely, i would have added fresh basil from the garden. and i would have cooked the sauce down further. but regardless, it was fabulous, and we will make it again!

And the tomatoes are added when?

we forgot some ingredients at the store and had to make some omissions (water instead of chicken broth, just added a tiny bit extra wine) and it was still great... the fennel is a nice touch. I used the mayo recipe from the mussels and french fries menu to serve with fries instead of bread to accomodate a friend who can only eat gluten free.

i too left out the fennel seeds and added a little extra lemon. it was fantastic!!

I made some minor changes and this was still fantastic. Since my girlfriend was feeling under the weather, I wanted to have more broth so we could really enjoy the french bread I bought. I added a cup of chicken stock and cut down on the red pepper and it made for a soothing and tastey meal.

WOW! It is the second time I make this plate with 3 years between them... and both times has been exceptional! I really recommend it and it is easy to make... Good luck!

These mussels were delicious! I increased the lemon significantly (I love lemon), but otherwise stayed pretty true to the recipe. I made this for a dinner with friends and served it with a cheese plate, a light salad of mache, shallots, and grapefruit, lots of fresh bread, and white wine. It was a perfect summer meal and I will definitely make it again!

Heavenly. The best mussels I've ever had! I have and will continue to make this recipe often. We also enjoy it accompanied with flavored rice as a substitue for bread. The broth this recipe creates is just heavenly.

This was a wonderful dish. Everyone raved about it. I forgot to get parsley, but had some thyme in the garden so subbed that. It worked well. I think everyone loved the fennel and the pepper flavors the most.

We've made this recipe serveral times and still can't get over how wonderful it is. Everyone we have made this for raves about it and wants a copy of the recipe. We make it according to the recipe without any substitutions, the only thing to keep in mind is it takes more than 3 minutes to reduce the sauce down to 1 cup. Highly, highly, highly recommend this recipe to everyone.

Rating: 4
The reviews posted here are correct - this recipe is PHENOMENAL. We omitted the fennel and pumped up the lemon and red pepper, and swirled in a couple tablespoons of butter at the end. There is a good deal of sauce, and having a lot (12-15 big slices) of good crusty garlic bread on hand turns this from an appetizer into a meal for 2. We have resolved to eat this once a week.

recently worked with mussels for the first time and decided to try one of my favorite dishes that I've never made...This one was AWESOME!!!Planed on it being an appetizer but at 2 1/2 lbs for 2 people, it was dinner...So good and easy...At Carrabas (local Italian resturant) it's Cozze en Bianco, my fav...this was very close...I now have a new quick, easy, inexpensive dinner for two...Thanks

Wonderful! I added some fresh fennel as well, which I sauteed with the onions. Omitted the lemon. Red pepper flakes provided additional zing. Used as a tasty main course. Highly recommended!

WOW!!! This was the 1st recipe I've used from this site, and it was fabulous! This dish is as perfect for a romantic dinner for 2, as it is to serve as an appetizer at a cozy dinner party.

It was so delicious, we wish we had people over for dinner to enjoy it and also to impress! I don't what people are talking about removing the fennel seeds, they were the perfect seasoning. I did substitute the chopped tomatoes for a teaspoon of tomato paste, but that's because I've made dishes simliar to this where fresh tomatoes don't add enough flavor. Definately will make it again-- for a dinner party!

Just wanted everyone to know that this is a wonderful mussels recipe. My husband just raved about it. I did substitute leeks for the onion and I had about 3lb of mussels,so I added another cup of the white wine. It was good to the last drop of the savory broth. This is now my top recipe for mussels. Since mussels are easily available in Holland this time of year, I will be making this alot!

Just have to say this recipe was fabulous - we made it with a dark belgian beer rather than white wine (seemed more appropriate for a winter dinner) and it worked great! All in all it's unbelievably easy and the presentation is impressive.

Rave reviews from the crowd. Great presentation. Very tasty. However, i really like the mussel receipe that's done with leeks. equally as simple, yet the leeks impart a great flavour. Still, this is a fantastic variation and will make it again.

From PA 4 forks I never met a mussel I didn't like and this is no exception! I made 4 lbs. for 3 people- we ate every morsel. Thanks for all the helpful hints. I followed most of them but I used parsley since it was all I had and cut down on garlic and red pepper- we have sensitive eaters, but they loved it! It was great!

This recipe had all the elements of a star recipe: quick, simple, and delicious!! I took earlier advice and increased the lemon to a full lemon and left out the fennel. I also added shallots to the garlic...and finally I added a 1/2 tbl butter to the sauce after reducing. Ate this with a baguette and some brie and that was a saturday night dinner! Yum!

The first time we made this recipe, it came out delicious. We omitted the fennel and swapped out the parsley for cilantro becasue, oddly enough, I don't really like the taste of parsley. Anyway, it was great and we served it to my out-laws (still not married) and the four of us CHOWED on it. The second time we made it, it came out really bitter- I'm thinking we didn't cook the sauce long enough after adding wine, but the mussels were done cooking, so we served it. I tried to blame my fiance because he added some butter, but we know that butter isn't bitter, only fattening ;-)

Wonderful, fabulous, excellent! Loved this mussel recipe. Left out the fennel and added additional lemon as other cooks' suggested + put in the tomatoes at the same time as the mussels. Three of us managed to polish off 3 pounds + frites + a large french baguette. Will definitely make again soon. Easy + fast.

Just made this for an appetizer at a party last week-end, and people were licking their bowls! I did make changes though. Left out the fennel and added saffron. I also substituted chopped cilantro for the parsley, and doubled the amount of lemon slices. After removing the mussels from the pan, I swirled in a bit of better and added some cream. THE BEST mussels I've ever had...I've been asked to make them again next week for the gang and have nothing but mussels and french bread. Very easy, and yummmmy!

I have thrown away all of my other recipes for steamed mussels - this recipe is the best I've ever had. The sauce is wonderful and the only thing I add is more lemon.

Good but broth tasted too salty. I agree with other reviewers that fennel seeds are strange in this recipe. We love mussels, but next time, I will try a different recipe.

Contrary to others views on the fennel, I always keep this recipe just as it is, though I usually do use an entire lemon. I think the taste is wonderful and while I am not generally a big fan of spicy foods, the spice in this dish is appropriate. This is definitely my favorite mussel recipe and the one I always make for guests and after years of making this recipe over and over again I have only ever received rave reviews. Serve it with the garlic toasts and it is definitely a feast.

This is the recipe I always use now for steamed mussels. The only things I changed were leaving out the fennel and I add a bit of butter to the sauce at the end of cooking which makes it a bit richer. Very tasty.

This is a keeper. I used Mahogany clams, added the tomatoes along with the wine and lemon slices and cooked all for a few minutes before adding the clams. It was great!

The spices in this recipe overwhelm the delicate mussel taste. The broth and a slice of good bread is usually a feast unto itself, but the broth was rendered so hot from the fennel and red pepper that it became a punishment to eat.

Rating: 2
This was a good recipe. Simple and easy. Looked impressive in the bowl with the white pasta, red tomatoes, and black mussel shells. I used extra red pepper which gave it a nice kick. I think the reason I wasn't wow'd was in Texas we don't get the best mussels in the world. Mine were medium to small size and I think it detracted from the overall taste. I might use a combination of seafood (e.g., shrimp, scallops, etc.) next time for more flavor.

This was a wonderful dish. I also did not add fennel, used more lemon and substituted cilantro for the parsley.

I took Eric's advice and did not add the fennel sseds. I also added more lemon as he recommended - I used a whole lemon. Then I let the broth concoction cook on high heat for several minutes to blend the flavors. It really brought the lemon out. At the end, I added 2 tablespoons of softened butter. Yum yum yum.

Great recipe if you remove the fennel. The licorice taste of the fennel kills all. I replaced fennel with a generous pinch of saffron and this became the best mussel dish I've ever had. Later versions included doubling the lemon (a real improvement) and doubling the pepper (not for everyone - I'm a hothead).

I am a relatively new cook and made mussels for the first time. I don't think I could have found an easier or tastier recipe. My husband thinks I'm a genious in the kitchen. He absolutely loved the mussels--almost finished a loaf of bread soaking up the sauce since he didn't want it to go to waste!!!

Rating: 4
fantastic!!I've made several times and nobody can get enough. You can try different variations, add saffron and light cream and also toss with angel hair pasta. Little secret-at good meat/seafood markets you can buy the large green australian mussels (frozen cleaned and on 1/2 shell) I use nothing else and they are always on hand (1lb box $7.99)

This is a great recipe! I substitute cilantro (almost a cup of it) for the parsley, and add about a tablespoon or so of Dijon mustard.

Great with Prince Edward Island mussels !!! Would be OK to go a little light on fennel and red pepper. The broth is worth the effort, just so you can soak it up with some crusty bread.

Four forks from me too! I've never been a mussel fan but this morning my husband thought he'd like some. At the store they had fresh mussels so I bought a pound for him and 5 or 6 for me. I pulled up all the mussel recipes on Epicurious and he picked out this recipe. We just got finished eating it and I'm a mussel convert. This is definately a "keeper" and mussels have a new fan!

This dish takes no time to make, and looks/tastes amazing when it's finished. The fennel adds an especially nice flavor. My roommate and I polished off an entire batch in one sitting. A perfect meal w/wine and crusty bread.
