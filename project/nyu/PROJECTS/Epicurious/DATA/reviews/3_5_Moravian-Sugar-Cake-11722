The cake is greatly improved by adding 1/2 tsp nutmeg and the zest of one orange to the dough

As the Moravians were, like many of the Germanic sects that came to America in the 17th and 18th centuries, considered the "plain people," their food reflected their lives and customs - solid, no ostentation, but excellent in flavor and texture. When prepared properly and cooked (as the Moravians would have) in a wood-fired oven, this cake is extremely flavorful.

Please note there are two types of Moravians in the U.S. The Moravian Bretheren left Moravia (a part of the Czech Republic) in the 1600's for religious freedom. The setteled in Germany and eventually came to the US and settled in North Carolina and Pennsylvania. Moravia still exists and is part of the Czech Republic and was settled by Slavic tribes. Recent immigrants did settle (including my parents) in the Chicago area, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, New York and also Canada. The cake is okay but cannot rival my mom's amazing kolacky, bublanina and cookies.

Quite good. Especially warm. Not a fancy treat, but good comfort food.

My husband's mother's family is Moravian. When we first married, I wanted to find ways to add his traditions into our Christmas celebration. So, I found this recipe for sugar cake. He loves it! Says it reminds him of the ones he used to have as a child. It has become an annual tradition for us.

In around 1750 the Moravians settled in Salem, of Winston-Salem NC where sugar cake has been a local favorite forever! The large Moravian community there and in Bethlehem PA should have been mentioned in your description!
