Tastes so sophisticated, but really so easy. I used fresh basil, I didn't measure exactly, I used a random mix of strawberries + blueberries + blackberries, I needed it to wait in the fridge for 6 hours before serving, and it was excellent. It was even excellent leftover the next day. DH is trying to convince me to have it made and on hand all the time!

Just use the recipe for the cream. (and probably used less cream cheese-I never measured). Excellent. Use the cream on everything!

We used basil leaves isntead of geranium and it tasted wonderful!

Very easy and very nice. I used mint leaves.

WOULD ANYONE RECOMMEND USING ROSE PETALS?

Delicious with basil if geraniums can't be found. I had a problem once getting the cream to even remotely thicken, however, so I folded it into some whipped cream and it was just as good.

I was curious about this recipe, so I found the right geranium leaves and gave it a whirl. It was wonderful and worth the effort. Certainly get past the contraversy and try it.

It's a shame this recipe is ending up with a 1-fork rating just because all the idiots who gave this a poor rating merely because they got a bad link. It happens, folks. Just hit your back button and do a search for what your looking for. Don't get all bent out of shape because you have make a few extra key strokes. I made this dish and thought it was delightful.

I just happened to have the right geranium plants in the garden, crème de cassis I made last year, and black (sweet) and red (tart) currants in season right now. Delightful!

I have always been a big fan of using unusual herbs in dishes. Scented geraniums are fantastic! (And to other reviewers who gave this a thumbs down because it was not the right link, shame on you. You need to get a life!)

You would think that after a dozen "Where's the Blueberry Pudding Cake?" reviews, the folks at Epicurious would catch on and fix the bug.....

OK, not the recipe I clicked on, but a very good one as well. I love the combination of plain berries with the richiness of cream. Flavouring with green herbs is a surprising taste experience.

Other than the blueberries, this would appear to have nothing in common with the recipe I thought I was being linked to (which was a Blueberry Pudding Cake)
