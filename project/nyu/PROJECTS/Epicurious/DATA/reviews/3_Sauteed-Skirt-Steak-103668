Ok...heat up pan...put food in hot pan...cook food. I've been doing it wrong all these years. Now, if I can just figure out how to heat up the pan. Ah, that must be what the pre-heated oven is for! Genius!

Yo.....cook from Georgetown! Your sense of humor and way with words were certainly appreciated by me! You're very funny! By the way, on a serious note you at Epicurious seriously screwed up on this recipe just in case you didn't get the sarcasm of Georgetown.

An instant classic. The recipe demystifies what's always been a dish shrouded in secrecy, pan-sauteed steak, and does so in a way intelligible to the novice, but without condescending to the professional. Best of all is the secret twist: the preheated oven. It's an unusual technique, but a necessary one, as the heat from the preheated oven imparts a certain je ne sais qoi to the steak as it sautees. Marvelous!
