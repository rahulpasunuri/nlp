I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! My mom used to make these for us when we were young.

When I made these with left over pie dough my husband said - Oh you made 'dough dodgers'. When he was growing up his mom called them that as they were the pinwheels that dodged being pie dough! Too cute. So incredibly simply but tasty!

These are definitely popular amongst French-Canadians. They are called "pêtes de soeurs", meaning nun's farts! My mom made these with leftover pie dough when I was a kid, and she still makes a batch of them every year for Christmas. I made them last year for an office Christmas party in Toronto, and other French Canadian staff told me that their mom used to make them too (They were a hit with everyone... first desert plate to empty). They shine with a butter pie crust dough but any crust recipe will do. Spread a coating of soft butter on the crust, and generously sprinkle with brown sugar. Cinnamon is not traditional for us, but I love it and have started making my "pêtes de soeurs" with cinnamon too.

Must be a Canadian thing. I've been making these for years with left- over pastry dough as well. But I spread softened butter over the dough and sprinkle with brown sugar instead of cinnamon sugar. To the question below, yes you roll into a rectangle and the size doesn't really matter. I usually make the short side about 5- 6 inches because I like fairly small pinwheels and because I don't usually have that much dough left over.

I assume that the dough should be rolled out into a rectangle. Anybody know how large this should be? I definitely want to try these out!

I know this recipe may sound a little boring to some, but my mother and I have been making these for years with our leftover pastry dough at Christmas. We had to start making a full pastry recipe just for these cookies, as everyone devours them. Yum Yum!!
