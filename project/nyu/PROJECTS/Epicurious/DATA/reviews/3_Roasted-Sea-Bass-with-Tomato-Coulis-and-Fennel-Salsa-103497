I agree with other reviewers that the salsa and coulis should be at least at room temperature. My husband absolutely loved it! We think you could use any fish with this and are going to use up the leftover coulis and salsa with a salmon fillet tomorrow night. I made the coulis and salsa early in the day so putting it all together for a Sunday night dinner was a snap. I think it would also be a light and colorful entree for dinner guests without too much last minute muss or fuss. What I am really waiting for are the vine ripe tomatoes from the garden. I think using more intense flavored tomatoes will really make this zing!

Overall, it was just OK, nothing spectacular. The salsa is an interesting variation but was not thrilled about it. I would not make this recipe again.

Followed recipe, but heated up the coulis (in a double boiler, though a quick zap in the microwave would probably do just as well) and made sure the fennel salsa was at room temperature, not chilled. I can't imagine making it with the coulis and salsa cold, unless, as another reviewer noted, you grilled the fish and served it as a summer entree.

This recipe did not turn out as well as the other reviewers stated. I will chalk it up to my own error, and try again with some variation. I would agree that the sea bass seems to call for a warmer sauce, although tomatoes are a nice complement to the fish. Overall, I thought the recipe was time consuming and not worthwhile. I am still searching for a restaurant quality sea bass recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe. Great for summer. I served it with a couscous and sauteed spinach with pine nuts. An Austrailian Chardonnay is perfect with this dish. I will definitely make this again.

Tied this recipe for a bday dinner last night. Coulis and salsa are easy to make and delicious. IMO, however, as they're served cold, I think they'd be much better with a grilled fish. A summer bbq kind of thing. The roasted sea bass was good -- but seemed to ask for a warm sauce.

This was a wonderful, light and flavorful dish. The coulis could benefit from a little tabasco, but it is delicious as is. The fennel salsa added just the right accompaniment to finish off the fish. I removed the skin from the fish - the recipe was not specific on this. I'm certain to make this again.

Great, delicious dish. The fennel salsa was delicious, and relatively easy to make. Very good dish for entertaining, as you can make things ahead of time, and then roast the fish, while enjoying a first course. Made for a dinner party, and my guests absolutely raved about it. Yum yum

I made the dish for friends and everybody loved it. It's tasty, light and very colorful. I live in Cairo Egypt and could not find fennel, at this time, so I substituted seedless cucumber and dill, it was really nice. I' m going to do it again soon.

The dish is delicious. I loved the tomato coulis. I added a little creole seasoning and a dash of tabasco sauce. I will make this dish again and often.

I made this recipe for our gourmet dinner group. It was excellent. I broiled the fish for the last few minutes to give it some color and served it with homemade spinach gnocchi. I also added more tomatoes to the salsa and a little less fennel.

Would very much like to try this recipe - pehaps BBQ vice bake - but the details of the Fennel Salsa are missing. Can you help?

Please review this recipe and the recipe for the Tri-Tip --- both lack an important part of the recipe. Fortunately I have the June 2000 Bon Appetit and found the missing pieces!
