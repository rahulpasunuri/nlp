Wow, yum!! I tend to use the same spices and sometimes use them to an overwhelming extent when I'm cooking without a recipe. Everything ends up tasting the same, whether I'm making Ethiopian food or Indian food. I like to try a new recipe every now and then to change up the spices. I did double the spices like a lot of others in this recipe. Be careful not to overdo the salt, though. I used 1/2 vegetable broth and 1/2 water to cook the lentils and added 3 tsp of salt and it was way too salty. (I was in a hurry and not thinking straight!) I also added a diced onion and steamed sweet potato as suggested by others, and cooked the rice separately. So even though I made a ton of changes, I think the original might have been a little bland for us. With the alterations it was fantastic and everyone scarfed it down. We also served Indian Potatoes on the side, recipe from this site. Yummy and I bet the leftovers will be excellent too!

Unbelievably flavorful.

New cook here but I changed a few things and it turned out quite well. The boyfriend not only finished his plate but went back for seconds! I went ahead and cooked the lentils and rice beforehand save for the cooking time called for in the recipie. I also used brown rice instead of basmati(for the health benefits)and it went well. I doubled the amount of spices called for save for the salt which was a good call as it turned very flavorful without any extra salt. I am a fan of biriyani so I added a handful each of slivered almonds and golden raisins. I also steamed sweet potato cubes to fold in. I added these extras to the dish to simmer at the end. So, I guess I changed quite a few things but it turned out very flavorful and just the right consistency. Hope this helps!

fabulous for the health-obsessed chef (me). super nutritious and if you add huge quantities of the spices/seasonings and great sea salt, this is fantastic. ** dump all the ingredients into your rice maker** for a dish so easy it's a joke. my favorite trick. Recipes like this should be used as a skeleton and sensible chefs know to tinker with quantities according to personal taste. for me, that means huge quantities of anything that lends flavor. I used 1 1/2 c. brown rice and 1 c. green lentils, and 4 c. water and about 1 generous tablespoon sea salt. And added about 1/4 c. olive oil for health, fluffiness and clump prevention. Have fun with this!

Thank you so much for sharing. This is a great base recipe for leftover vegetables and, for some people, meats, but not necessary at all. I steamed sweet potato cubes to add with some nuts and golden raisins and it was incredible. If my mother had had this, Campbell's-mushroom- soup-casseroles would have been spared my generation of suburbanites! This will be a last-minute staple in my house without question. Thank you.

I was really dissapointed, the way every one was going on I was expecting this to be fabulous, as written its really quite bland and mushy, I ended up increasing the spices, adding chili sauce and greek yogurt to make it more interesting, but it is a good starter dish for any one who wants to make Indian food and is afraid of the strong flavors

I read 32 reviews and made notes. I cooked green lentils, but began them in a separate pot. After they had cooked to near tender, I then added them in where called for and followed the rest of the direction. I added onion, 4 cardamom pods, diced tomato, cayenne pepper, 4 cloves garlic, 4 whole cloves rather than 2, no sugar, and the 1/2 the water and 1/2 veg stock. I probably used more turmeric and cumin seeds than called for. It was very good! Simple, filling, comfort kind of food. Served with naan and it was a good meal.

Great recipe. I added a handful of chopped carrots and spinach and it turned out fabulous. I used brown rice so I cooked the rice separate from the lentils and decreased the total water used with the lentils.

Not very good. I used chicken broth instead of water and upped the ginger and reduced the salt as other reviewers suggested. It was still bland and had kind of a soapy flavor that we did not enjoy. Will not be making this one again.

I love this recipe, it is very healthy and makes great left-overs for lunch. Also make with brown rice and add carrots, celery and spinch for a vegetable version.

Read all the reviews ab=nd then decided to add rice first and cook for 5 mins. then added red lentils for 10 mins. Perfect! This is a family staple now.

This recipe was tasty. Based on the other reviews, I cooked the lentils per these directions and cooked the rice separately. I had to simmer the lentils for about an hour to get them to the level of tenderness that I like, but it was worth it in the end.

I following the recipe as written. It was good!

Unlike other reviewers, my rice was undercooked and the lentils a bit overcooked. The flavor was good. A great protein-rich dish that is easy and mildly flavored. I would say this is perfect for kids or others who are just beginning to appreciate the flavors of Indian food.

Easy and fast - just the way I like it. I made this with only french lentils (no rice) as a side dish. I substituted veg. broth for water and omitted the salt.

Rating: 2
I would make this dish again, but only with more alterations. I took the advice of other reviewers and used veg. broth in place of water, cut the salt, and added a diced chili. I also tried to cook the lentils longer before adding the rice, but the lentils still took forever to cook and I ended up with mush. When I make this again I will start the lentils first and add them, mostly cooked to the dish with the rice. I also plan to add an onion, 2 diced chilis, and some ancho chili powder to balance out the cinnamon.

This was so good and I only had to clean one pot. Perfect for a rainy winter day.

I made this dish twice because the basic recipe was easy and seemed to be very tasty. First time, no luck. Second time, I used french lentils, added more salt, replace the cummin seeds with mustard seeds and added some coriander seeds as well. Turned out great!

This turned out very well and tasty for me after having read several reviews that suggested increasing the spices. I started with recommended amount and added as I went along according to how it tasted. Also, I used half beef broth and half water, and added a pinch of red pepper flakes to give it a little added oomph. I used red lentils mainly for aesthetic reasons, and basmati rice which makes adds to the aromatic element. Nice dish overall.

This was tasty, but I highly reccomend using 1/2 vegetable broth 1/2 water as base. You can eliminate the salt from the recipe if you do this. Also, red lentils are much less bland than green,and I used extra ginger and lime juice. Next time I will add tomatoes and cauliflower..yummy.

Although the ingredients sounded like a delicious combination, I didn't enjoy the flavor. I followed the recipe, except I didn't have basmati rice and used long grain white rice. I ended up with undercooked lentils and overcooked rice. The salt was excessive, and my salt-loving family agreed. No one would eat it.

This tasted great, and I didn't have any of the problems mentioned, using green lentils; I added butter at the end, which helped bind the flavors. great combination of ginger, garlic, cinnamon, cloves, cumin and turmeric.

Quite a boring recipe, and it turned out mushy and rather tasteless. To improve this dish a couple things are needed. Firstly, lots more ginger, about two tablespoons. Secondly, about a tablespoon of curry powder to enhance flavour. Apart from that I believe one should always mention the type of lentils that are required. In this case I think red lentils taste best.

Little flavor.

Take other reviewers advice and decrease the salt. The flavors were just great. However, my dish (like another reviewers) was mushy - it took longer to cook the lentils, I estimated their completion time, added rice, but by the time lentils were done, my rice was mush.

Mmm...this was delicious. I'd been searching for recipes using lentils and short grain brown rice for health reasons...I substituted short grain brown rice for this recipe. We thought it was fabulous! I put the rice in first, cooked it for 30 minutes, and then put the lentils in...it took a total of 60 minutes to cook it through.

This dish tastes quite bland to me. I would make the dish again as it is easy and affordable but it needs a bit more chilli or something spicy to heat it up a bit.

This was a great weekday dinner meal. We used masoor dal (red lentil) as they cook the fastest. Added a finely chopped onion, cardamon pods, saffron threads. This would make an excellent side dish for lamb. Wonderful.

This dish was perfect! Thank you! I tried to make six Indian dishes over the course of a week and this was the only thing that was consistently great! I used Jasmine rice because I didn't have bastmati, but it worked out just right! The first time I forgot to use the tumeric, but it was fine nonetheless. I will make this forever. Thank you again.

Ooooohhhhh...this was absolutely delicious. The flavors were so rich and tasty. My husband used brown basmati rice with a little wild rice, and for some reason he ended up having to add two extra cups of water and cook it for an additional 45 minutes. It was worth the wait, though. It turned out creamy, almost like risotto. Delicious recipe!

I loved this recipe and have made it twice. I increased the spices added four cardamom pods and reduced the salt; also found that I needed to cook the lentils much longer than 8 minutes. Would recommend this to any cook intimidated by most Indian recipes. Served with plain yogurt, it tastes like a vegetarian biryani to me.

Rating: 3
Very good. I skipped the sugar, upped the spices and added cayenne. Also added a small bunch of fresh collard greens (chopped fine) with the lentils (I used red lentils) and added a chopped seeded ripe tomato with the rice. With all that, it becomes a tasty vegetarian main dish.

Awesome! Had to make some modifications-only had the spices in powder form, didn't use sugar (due to allergy) and added onions, pepper, zucchini-delicious! Always found indian food to be tricky to make-but this was a pleasant surprise!

USE 3 to 3 1/4 CUPS OF WATER and no more! I would add the rinsed rice/lentils to the spices/oil and saute for a while, then add the liquid. Cook for 20 minutes, and it comes out like perfect pilaf. A keeper once more spices are added.

I loved this recipe. I have made it twice now. I agree that it needs to cook an extra 5 minutes or so. Also, I reduced the salt and increased the ginger. Mmmm....

Tried others recommendations and added red pepper. Great. Other spices were the correct amount, but found the rice to be mushy. I did try cooking the lentils ahead and doing the rice closer to dinner. Would reduce rice cooking time and think this would be a winner. The problem with this receipe is the timing - some lentils take longer cooking than others.

I would definitely make this again. However, being at a high altitude the cooking time is longer. Simmering should take place for more like 20 minutes than the recommended 8. The spices were excellent!!

This was really good, but I am going to have to try this one again. By the time the water was absorbed, the dish was a bit mushy. I agree with Rox about the spices. Don't add more of what's listed, just add something to give it some heat, maybe red pepper flakes, curry paste, hot sauce, whatever.

I loved this dish. It is also excellent reheated in a nonstick pan until some of the kernels are slightly browned. The Indian herbs and spices are very good, and I added cauliflower to round out the nutrition and make it a one dish meal. HOWEVER the next time I make this I am definitely going to increase the spices. Without demeaning Bon Apetit which I like a lot, my suspicion is that it was kept a little bland to please the lowest common denominator. Get crazier with the spices and you may have something even more authentic.
