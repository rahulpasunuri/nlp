Very tasty and easy. I didn't have all the spices -- so I improvised: I steamed the potatoes and then tossed them with butter, a little salt and chopped fresh rosemary. Simple and tasty. Definitely a keeper!

We liked this, but the combination of butter and sour cream was a bit heavy. Next time I'd stick to one or the other.

Yummy, and easy. However, you can easily double the herbs. I used triple the amount, but we really like our fresh herbs! I used a little more parsley than mint (about five parts parsley to four parts mint). My mother, who was highly skeptical of putting mint on potatoes, especially loved it.

Different but delicious - the mix of parsely and mint is a fabulous addition to steamed potatoes. The only adeptations I made are to using more fresh herbs than asked for, which I took from my garden, and I also used new white potatoes rather than red. It is great either warm or cold - perfect for summer!
