LOVED these crunchy chick peas. I will make these often.

Now that I think about it, the taste is really similar to pumpkin seeds, so season as you would those.

Good, for a healthy snack. I dried thoroughly in dishtowels, and baked on CONVECTION ROAST at 400--they were perfectly crisp after just 20 minutes. I experimented with my own spice blends--I did one can with biryani seasoning and cayenne, and one can with cayenne, cinnamon, cumin, and corriander. Both were great for serving to health-conscious eaters.

These vanished in no time. I used two cans and dried them well, and used more spices. I roasted them until they were good and crunchy. Definitely a keeper.

Mine didn't taste very good. I'm not sure where I went wrong. It was kind like spices on crunchy cardboard, but maybe it' just not for me.

They are better fried. These do not last and must be eaten the same day too. I was bummed because i have had some fried and thought they were delicious.

I like it a lot, but without the spices...just salted. It is nice on an appetizer plate.

Yum! Yum! Yum! These are tasty little nuggets of yumminess. You'll want to eat the whole can's worth. Watch out!

I only made this once, but the result seems to be especially sensitive to relative quantities and to how long the chickpeas were roasted in the oven. I used 1.5 c dried chickpeas that had been cooked and frozen for a long time. I did not grind and cook the spices separately, but used dried powdered spices (to make it quick and easy). The resulting roasted peas were a good snack, but had an unusual texture that does not seem to go well on salad, etc. I suggest trying your own variations. Maybe oil with cinnamon and sugar would also work, or other spices. It was quick and easy, especially when spices were not separately cooked. I recommend trying it sometime when your oven is on for other purposes and you have time to monitor the chickpeas as they cook. I'll probably try making them again with a different spice combination someday, because they are nutritious and cheap.

I really didn't taste the spice in these. They weren't horrible, but not as great as I was expecting. Definitely agree, would make spiced nuts next time.

even though I dried the canned chickpeas as the recipe instructed, I still had to roast twice as long as the recipe indicated; even then, they weren't particularly crisp. Nuts or edamame would be a better choice.

I use it as a salad topper ... it's a nice change to nuts

Good. Not great, but not awful. I love chick peas, but prefer when they don't come out of a can, so maybe that was the problem. Overall, if you want to serve something like this, make some sort of spiced nuts instead.
