This was easy and so good. The only change was I added canola oil when browning the duck legs. I also only used dried cherries and prunes. I didn't reduce the broth because I really wanted to serve the leg in a bowl with plenty of broth. It is probably the best duck I have ever had and my boyfriend also said it was the best duck he has ever had. It takes a lot for me to say it is the best because I am use to eating at top restaurants. I highly recommend this recipe.

I wanted to serve this as part of my Bacchus dinner club French-themed dinner party for 12. I tried a half recipe in advance and found that it was dry and there was little sauce. Read what others had done, so tried 300 degrees for 1 1/2 hours and it was fantastic. Instead of the added dry fruit at the end, I soaked some nectarine slices in red wine, and laid them on top of each duck leg and poured the sauce over. Beautiful and so delicious. Served with gruyere scalloped potatoes, French green beans with lemon, and tomato concasse, and of course Chateauneuf du Pape (Chateau de Beaucastel 2007) Rave reviews from guests.

Delicious, though I think two hours is a bit long... the meat wasn't as juicy as I would have liked. I made a 1/3 batch, but all the liquid evaporated, so I didn't have much of a sauce... just added more wine to the little I had left. Next time I'll make closer to a full batch of sauce even for just two duck legs.

excellent! Did not add any fruit at the end but put the sauce through the Cuisinart. Served with pureed potato and turnips and a cucumber and avocado salad - YUM!

Another satisfied customer for this recipe. For two people (2 legs) I halved the other ingredients; made for sufficient coverage in the oven, and a bit of extra yummy sauce. Used prunes, raisins and figs (on hand) for the first half, and just a very ripe fresh nectarine (again on hand) for the second part, and was completely happy.

Excellent! I have made this dish many times and follow the recipe exactly (save the dried fruit - I don't use the cranberries). I always get rave reviews,even from those who swear they don't like duck.

This recipe is phenomenal. I made it last night for my husband's birthday dinner and he said it was one of the best meals I have ever cooked. I halved the sauce recipe and used four duck legs. I didn't have time to cook it for 2 hours and took it out after 30 minutes, and it was still delicious -- definitely not as tender as it would have been if I left it in for longer, but still flavorful and good. I served mashed yam potatoes on the side.

I agree with daniguinha that this is restaurant quality. Surprisingly easy for the impressive display. I cut the recipe in half and it worked very well. The sauce was a bit too syrupy, but I just watered it down a little bit.

This is restaurant quality. Delicious! Not difficult to make, but it takes a lot of steps. I followed the advice to keep liquid below the skin, and also,it really took only one and half hour. The only think I will skip next time is the sauce. I kept the "solids" and they were delicious, as opposed to firmer fruit in the sauce. Served with mascarpone polenta and bacon lentils.

Excellent, simple recipe that is bound to impress. But the proportions seemed off so I changed some of them. I had 4 leg/thighs, and 1/2 c red wine didn't seem like enough. I used about 3/4 c instead, and used a half c of dried cranberries. I also added about a cup of fresh blueberries, and then only between 1.5 and 2 cups of broth (otherwise the sauce would've covered the skin and made it soft). I just added some broth as it was cooking, but still only about 3 cups total. And I added extra wine during cooking (about another 1/2 cup total). Be sure to brown the legs very well (dark brown), and keep the crispy side up out of the sauce so it stays crispy. I didn't need to cook this for 2 hours, or at 350. I cooked the legs at about 300-325 for an hour, and then turned it up to 350 for another half hour, and they were definitely done, falling off the bone, and the skin was super crispy. Maybe because I used an iron skillet.

Nice recipe. De-boned legs and used these to start a stock along with chicken bones from another meal. Also added some fresh mint leaves to make the stock. Took the advice and cooked at 300 F for 2 1/2 hours, using dried apricots and raisins. Duck was tender and held together by its skin, which itself was delicious.

Excellent recipe and easy to make, plus it's nice to have it made ahead of time. I didn't make the sauce as directed, it just wasn't working so I made a basic red wine sauce which worked great.

This is a great recipe because: 1) it's delicious 2) the ingredients are inexpensive 3) duck registers as special 4) braised dishes are best when made in advance, so you have no last minute panicky cooking in front of guests. I'd change a few things next time: a) don't pay for fresh thyme because it gets strained out anyway; use dried b) don't use dried tart cherries because they're covered in sugar and the sugar just ends up in the sauce c) use less expensive dried fruit for the initial cooking (like raisins) because they get strained out anyway. use the more expensive ones in the second half of the instructions d) replace the 6 Pekin (read: small) duck legs called for here with 3-4 Moulard (read:big) duck legs. The portion here is too puny, un-generous. You can get the big ones from liberty farms or hudson valley foie gras (use google). The very most expensive sources are still only $3.99/lb.

This recipe is simple and delicious. If cooked properly, it produces succulent meat that falls off the bone. 350 seems a little high for braising for 2 hours so I usually drop it down to 325 or even 300 and leave it in longer, if necessary. Buttered noodles with a bit of salt and pepper (egg noodles, farfalle/bowtie, etc.) make a nice accompaniment.

If you don't have a metal baster (as I didn't), this is not a recipe for the faint of heart! Very splattery when browning the duck. At that point, I decided I wouldn't make it again. But after eating it -- I will. But I'm getting a baster first. Made this with only 2 duck legs, cooked for 1 1/2 hours, and almost all the liquid had simmered away. Taking another reviewer's suggstion, I blended the fruit and garlic with the rest of the liquid (and added some chix broth as well). Only had dried pears as my fruit, and they worked really well. Delicious! Would be good to have a salad on the side, as it's so rich.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Easy to make and comes out beautifully. I skinned half of the legs and left the skin on the other half (to cut down on grease and fat). It was all delicious but next time I'll just leave the skin on all of them as the meat was more tender. I also simmered it in the oven with the lid on and it lessened the cooking time. I think I cooked it for about 1.5 hours.

Lots of steps but relatively easy. I used dried sour cherries, raisins and dried cranberries for the fruit and it came out just the right side of not too sweet. Only problems I had were duck skin sticking to the bottom of my stainless stockpot in the first step (I managed to get it off with a spatula and put it on top of the duck before putting it in the oven) and the faf of degreasing the sauce. I served it with mashed potatoes and spinach salad. Our budgets don't run to Chateau Neuf du Pape but a good robust S African Shiraz went down a treat with it.

Very simple and really tasty. Found the cooking time rather too long and reduced it on second use. Have also tried skin-on duck breasts which needed far less cooking time but were equally successful. I served it with mashed sweet potatoes with garlic and green beans........mmmm!

It was good but didn't wow me. I got small breasts and they shrunk up to half. If you want a nice presentation get bigger pieces. I liked the taste of dried cranberry and raisin in the sauce.

A fantastic duck dish I look forward to serving often. It will impress our Foodie Friends! I used 1/2 cup dried currents and 1/2 cup mixed dried apricots, plums,pears and a good California Pinot Noir ( Hangtime) that had a hint of current in the nose. (We finished the bottle with escargot while the duck was braising in the oven.) We decided to eat the duck smothered in the red wine fruit sauce without any accompanying side dishes as we wanted to critique it without confusing our taste buds. Upon tasting, we decided it was deserving of a bigger wine, so we opened a 1989 Chateau Fortia -Chateauneuf du Pape, which by all means, was the best choice because this dish can stand up to a big wine. The fruit flavors complimented each other beautifully and the duck was so perfectly done it fell off the bones. Plus the skin was crispy and not fatty - a BIG PLUS with duck. My husband reviews wines for Sante' Magazine ( Restaurant trade publication) - and always pairs his selections with a food dish. I wish that I had tried this recipe before he completed his most recent review of Rhones - he would certainly have chosen it to pair with several of the wines. When I serve this meal again I will pair it with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed baby green beans. Yummmm - Delicious!

Made this recipe with 4 duck legs, half the chicken broth and all of the wine. Used about a cup total of prunes, apricots and currants. Braised for 2 hours, but would check after an hour and a half next time. Kept the crisp duck above the liquid and blended the softened fruit and garlic into the liquid when done. Served over garlic mashed red potatoes. So good our brains fell right out. Am making again tonight with turkey thighs. Would probably be good with chicken legs as well. A definite keeper!

Terrific. Succulent and savory. Used dried mangoes/figs/cranberries. I had plenty of sauce from the recipe. Accompanied it with orange lentils cooked in chicken stock to which I added some of the garlic cloves and braising liquid after it was cooked. Spooned in plate, set the duck leg on the edge and then added the sauce. As the lentils were almost porridge like, it spread and with the sauce spreading, it created a yin/yang effect. Really terrific. Made buttermilk biscuits with fresh thyme added to batter. This would make a great dinner party dish.

Fantastic!!! I followed the advice to keep the skin above the sauce, and am very glad I did. I used chopped prunes, apricots and cherries. I cannot say enough good things about this recipe! Probably one of the best I've made off this site (along with Daniel Boulud's braised short ribs).

Wonderful flavorful dish with tasty sauce of garlic, thyme and fruit. I used cherries, prunes and apricots. Served at wine tasting dinner party where everyone raved about its flavor. 1 leg per person is a nice portion. Served it with the butternut squash flan.

Oh my! Made this tonight and served with roasted sweet potatoes and haricots verts--it was a wonderful dinner. I used prunes and cherries in the sauce. Kept the crispy skin out of the braising liquid so it stayed that way.

OK, small alteration to this recipe, which may make this all more practical. Buy two whole fresh ducks and sharpen your boning knife. Ten minutes and sixteen pieces of duck later ( twenty, if you cut the breasts in half )you have the makings of a wonderful meal for four hungry couples on a cold winter Saturday night. The fruit thickens the sauce but don't overdo it because it will be overpowering. Roasted garlic mashed potatoes and roasted beets with whole garlic cloves for added sweetness and great colour and you have a winner.

Deliciousd!!! Next time, though, I will use less broth as suggested by other reviewers. My mix of cherries, apricots, raisins and prunes gave a wonderful flavor along with all that uymmy garlic.

This dish is fabulous!! One of the best duck dishes I've ever had. I read the comments about there not being enough braising liquid or sauce, but I didn't have any trouble. I cooked 4 "average" duck legs (compared to the "6 large" in the recipe) in a 1/2-recipe of the braising ingredients, in a pan that was just large enough for the duck legs. There was enough liquid to cover the duck legs by half or maybe a little more, and it was perfect. The duck skin was excellent -- crispy and very flavorful. I served the duck with "Potato and Celery Root Puree" and "Sauteed Watercress", both on Epicurious, and they were all delicious.

This was a beautiful dish. My duck legs were on the smallish side, so I made two for each guest. Make sure when you braise that some of the skin side from each leg is outside the liquid - it gets nice and crispy, while the meat is moist and tender. I served the legs on a bed of greens I had sauteed in some of the rendered duck fat. Delicious.

Absolutely wonderful! I agree with the person who said there wasn't enough juice so, I now cook 4 legs with the juice for 6. Too bad duck legs are hard for me to find!!!!!

I followed the recipe to the letter, with somewhat disappointing results. The meat came out rather tough and stringy and there wasn't enough sauce. I admired the deep flavor, however--just gorgeous with a rich Rhone red. If I make this again I'll attempt it stove-top, where I can monitor the simmer more closely and keep it gentler. And I'll braise in more liquid.

Yummy! Made this for a dinner party tonight, and it was fantastic. Made a couple of small revisions to the recipe, though. Virtually skinned the duck legs - and was glad I did, as it cut down on the fat and didn't affect the flavor at all. Used 1 cup wine and 4 cups stock (instead of 5 cups stock) to give it a richer flavor. Also added 1.5 oz. of poulet glace, a reduced chicken demi-glace I bought at Fresh Fields. Really enriched the sauce. Absolutely delicious, and a perfect make-ahead dish.

I made this recipe using chicken legs and thighs, which are such a bargain (I separated the pieces, but that's a personal preference). The results were wonderful, and I'll definitely make it again - a great recipe for a low-cost meat!

Easy and delicious, and not too greasy if you let the sauce sit overnight (instead of a few minutes) to skim of the grease.
