To the Cook from Oregon: When a fish - or in this case, shrimp - is marinated in salt and/or acid and served raw, the process is called 'cooking'. I think this is a very tasty recipe for aguachile and makes a nice summer appetizer.

As funny as it sound it is the real aguachile, its like ceviche, its "cooked" in lime juice. think of it like sushi, the fish is raw. It is a crowd pleaser in Mexico if you make it right. Ive had it and never gotten sick. This is an appetizer.

Are you kidding? RAW shrimp? The name of the recipe is Shrimp COOKED in Lime and Chile. How sloppy and unprofessional can you get?

What the what? Chilled raw shrimp drizzled with lime juice, chiles, olive oil, and water? A sure-fire crowd pleaser!
