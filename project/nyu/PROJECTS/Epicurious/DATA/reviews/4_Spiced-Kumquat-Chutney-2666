I used whole spices instead of ground and added chilli flakes as well. Very good with Indian food as an alternative to mango chutney. I have made three batches already. Great recipe!

Very Good. I made it the first time, and we loved it. The second time, I canned it 8 oz. jars and put them in a water bath. The neighbors loved it for Christmas gifts.

I agree with another reviewer that the kumquats are tedious to pit. This is an unusual chutney and is more akin to a spicy marmalade. It's tasty, though a bit too thick to serve as an accompaniment to roast meat (perhaps I boiled it too long?) I think it might be an interesting pairing with a sharp cheese and a crusty bread.

I really liked this! I added whole star anise too.It was a little tedious pitting the kumquats though... I would make it again for certain.

Have now made this 4 times with excellent results. Left out the shallot and used whole star anise. Very very good, sweet and peppery.

What to do with the fruits of the kumquat tree in your back yard: chutney. This is SO easy, and SO delicious - and it only took about 15 minutes to make. Give as a gift or hoard in your fridge - it's fabulous.

This recipe is awesome! It was part of a romantic picnic at the beach.... served with chicken breast stuffed with cranberry cheese, and your Cumin and Coriander Spiced Chick-Pea Salad... along with a candle, flowers, and a bottle of Jackson-Triggs chardonnay.... I have passed it on .... loved by all!
