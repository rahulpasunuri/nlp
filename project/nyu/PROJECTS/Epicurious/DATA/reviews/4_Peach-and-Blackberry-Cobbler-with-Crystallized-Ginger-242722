This is a wonderful recipe that I use as my go to dessert now. It holds up to the wonderful crates of peaches that I buy here in South Carolina every August and freeze. The peaches towards the end of the season are extremely sweet, so the ginger balances out nicely. I tend to put the dessert in individual ramekins and do one large biscuit or use a small biscuit cutter and layer them.

The biscuits had a bitter taste. I think 1 1/2 Tablespoons baking powder is so much.

This is absolutely delicious and sooooo simple to make. The crystallized ginger adds such a splendid zing. It will be a definite keeper to my recipe box.

Delicious!! I have made this twice. I used 1 pint of blueberries instead of blackberries because that is what I had. I would even use more fruit for this to get a greater ratio of filling. I added another 1/2 TBS of corn starch the second time to get a thicker juice in the filling. I also used milk in the biscuits instead of cream the second time, again because that is what I had, and they were fine. Note about the ginger. The second time processed the ginger for the filling with the sugar to make it finer so I didn't have chunks of ginger in the filling, which can be a bit pungent, especially for kids. Same for the biscuits, but I left small bits instead of grinding it completely fine.

The biscuit is wonderful. Brought to a party and it was a hit.

This was very good. When I make it next time, I think I'll chop the ginger finer because it was a little overpowering to bite into chopped sized pieces.

It has been amazing every time I have made this. I have even substituted blackberries with blueberries and/or raspberries, and if I didn't have enough peaches I have thrown in some nectarines. The biscuits are amazing with the hints of ginger...all around perfect combo of sweet and that bit of spice from the ginger.

A disappointment. Granted, it's hard to find excellent, fragrant peaches here in NYC, even at the best gourmet shops. The ones I did locate yielded a scant five cups of fruit. I ended up with way too much biscuit and not enough compote to balance this dish. As I feared, the peaches did not sing out in the final presentation. Nor did the biscuit part live up to its interesting technique and ingredients. Aesthetically, this recipe left something to be desired. When serving to a friend I noted how the biscuits looked like hockey pucks in the pan. Several hours later, my friend said they now resembled crab cakes. Crab cakes would likely be tastier and less time-consuming!

Fantastic! I will keep this recipe forever. My dad is diabetic and he prefers pie or cobbler for his birthday, so I used Splenda instead of sugar. It was great! He loved it too!

This was very yummy, and my kids loved it. We did not have any cream on hand, so I made it with whole milk and it came out perfect. I also used canned peaches and although they're not as good as fresh, it was still good. Great way to use up those blackberries that take over the yard. We had it without ice cream or whip cream. I will make this again.

Excellent(!) recipe. One of the best cobbler doughs I've seen. I used fresh peaches and frozen berries. Also excellent with rhubarb and strawberries.

Simple recipe, very nice. The ginger makes this dessert! When mixing the dough, I would not chop the ginger as fine as I did for the filling as it chops further when pulsed in the processor. Served it naked (no whipped or ice cream) as a mid morning treat to friends and they all raved.

Great! We warmed up the leftovers for breakfast.

The ginger was nice with the fruit, and awesome in the biscuits. I think I used less-than-ideal peaches, because the fruit ended up tasting a little watery. Maybe I should have baked it a little longer?

I've made this cobbler three times this year and everytime it has been a hit with guests. I just made it for the last time this season and can't wait until next summer to make it again!

I really love this recipe. When shopping for ingredients, I accidentally bought whole wheat, instead of white, pastry flour. I worried that the rustic texture of the wheat would ruin the biscuits and thought about putting off making the recipe for a few days until I could get back to the store. The siren song of my ripe peaches, though, made me go ahead. I was delighted with the results, which I think says a lot about the friendliness of this recipe. The biscuit is really more of a scone, and a delicious one at that. I may try adapting it for that purpose alone. In the meantime, this is one very lovely cobbler.

Fabu! I had blueberries on hand, so that's what I used; and was lazy so I made a quicky crisp topping using the ginger instead. Super yummy!!

This cobbler was the best I've made this year. The ginger in the fruit added an amazing depth of flavor. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Very tasty and came together fairly quickly. The ginger adds a nice subtle flavoring. Will definitely make again.
