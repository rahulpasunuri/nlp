I made this for the Holiday and it was awesome! I didn't make the crust because that just doesn't seem traditional. My guest wrapped it up and took the rest with him and said he was planning on eating it for breakfast. Great recipe! The rum makes it.

Like so many others, I just made the flan, which we served with a traditional New Mexico dinner. It was fantastic -- everyone agreed that it was the best flan ever. Smooth, creamy, altogether luscious. Be sure and strain the custard before pouring into the dish. It was a little hard to liquify the caramel for serving, but soaking the dish in hot water did the trick.

Delicious! Made this for family Christmas and everyone raved about it. It was a fair amount of work and you could probably skip the crust and whipping cream.

No forks! This recipe is a very weak entry. Eggnog tasted good when mixed up, but tasted very faint when baked. Crust did not go well with flan. It was heavy and dense. Definitely will not make again.

I was amazed at how successfully this flan turned out! I had never made a flan before and was quite worried that something would go wrong with this recipe. Much to my surprise, when we flipped the pan over the flan came out in one BEAUTIFUL piece. It tasted quite good too, I liked the addition of the crust, it had a nice flavor and texture. The recipe was not difficult to follow, though we had to let it bake for about half an hour longer than suggested. Anxious to try it, we only chilled the flan for about four hours, but it worked just perfectly!

Very good flan. It was a hit with the family at Xmas. I made it the week before to test the recipe and my and my husband agree that the crust overwhelms the delicate nature of the flan. For xmas, instead of making the crust, we added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the flan directly. That added the extra holiday flavor boost without overwhelming the flan. To be fair, my husband tends to be a "flan purist." The crust, should you choose to make it, is a very nice crust that held up nicely over the couple of days it took my husband to consume our "test" flan.

This recipe was DELICIOUS and a huge hit with Christmas guests. I followed the recipe exactly as written and had no issues, though part of the success I attribute to cooking with a relatively new, gas range which bakes extremely evenly. The spiced cookie crust was a nice addition to this very light, delicate flan. We did not serve it with whipped cream, as it was not needed with the rich caramel accompaniment. Though very time intensive, this recipe was not difficult and will definitely be revisited, sooner rather than later if my husband has any say in the matter.

I thought this dessert was not worth the calories. It was just ok. The cookie crust was a big disappointment. It was flavorless and it burned 1/2 way through the cooking time. I threw it out and substituted Ikea's almond cinnamon cookies which were a perfect compliment to the flan. I put the whipped cream on the side and stuck a cookie in the flan and sprinkled with a little fresh nutmeg.

A beautiful dessert and after tasting, we decided it was worth the time and effort. The crust was delicious, though my group decided the flan may have been even better without it.

Very good dessert! Also did not serve with the whipped cream (it was rich enough). Had a little trouble with the caramel - some of it hardened in the pan and didn't invert with the custard (couldn't loosen even soaking the pan in warm water)...in the end just chipped up the "candy" and the "crystals" on top looked very festive for Christmas dessert.

An absolutely great dessert! I did not serve with the whipped cream .. it's too good on it's own. Garnished with cape gooseberries! My company loved it.
