This was very tasty. I also cooked the onions and garlic first: after the lamb was browned I removed the lamb and deglazed the pan with a bit of marinade while the onions and garlic were still in the pan. Then I removed the vegetables to the Cuisinart and added the chick peas, which had been simmered. This gave the mash some of the flavor of the marinade. I put the lamb back in the skillet with the marinade and proceeded with the recipe. It was not a "pretty" dish", but the flavors were good.

Picked up a "lamb shank" at the market that was marked down to half price. It was actually a 2.2 lb leg of lamb. I boned and butterflied it for this recipe and it was perfect. Followed the recipe although I took some tips from previous reviewers. I used a food processor to puree the beans and added three chopped uncooked garlic cloves to the puree. I also reduced the marinade in the pan to thicken a little for topping the lamb on the puree. The recipe had very good flavors. The next time I make this I would do the onions and garlic in the pan first and add the marinated meat. I would also attempt to remove as much marinade as possible for the browing process and turn up the heat, while I continued to move the garlic and onions around within the pan. I did cook in the oven for 15 minutes, but would set timer for 10 minutes next time and check temperature. Mine was not as rare as the picture, which I would have preferred. Recipe is much better than some of the reviews indicated.

The lamb was a little bland and took a while longer to get to rare than stated. I added chopped carrots to the onion mix and glad I did. It gives the mashed chickpeas a great flavor. I would make the chickpeas again...the lamb needs a little something more.

The lamb didn't really impress me (made some minor mods in the execution, but don't think that was the problem). The mash was an interesting change, though. However, I did halve the amount of onions and garlic, as I didn't want my breath to be quite that lethal.

This was a fun recipe to make, with amazing aromas throughout preparation. I marinated the lamb for five hours - two at room temp, and the flavors and spices were perfect. The garbanzo mash, however, lacked pizzazz, despite incorporating the onions, garlic and juices from the lamb pan. The texture wasn't fabulous with the perfectly cooked meat (i cooked it medium rare)and if I made it again, I'd puree the chickpeas to a silkier texture with more olive oil, garlic, salt and lemon. The cilantro was perfect in the dish. My guests loved the meal, which included roasted beets with cumin and mint. Delicious!

I was really, really unimpressed with these two recipes. Mediocre results for a fair amount of work. The marinade for the lamb smelled AMAZING, but ended up rather tasteless. The mash was just okay. I won't make this again.

We found the marinade to be good, but very citrusy. It did give the meat an interesting flavor, as well as keeping it moist. Will try to make the garbanzos next time.

My bf and I were pretty excited as I was preparing this for dinner tonight - the marinade was wonderfully fragrant and smelled as though it would pefectly compliment the lamb. To our disappointment, though it looked and smelled fantastic, it was definitely missing something. The mash had a great flavor - hard to go wrong with a starch side cooked chicken broth, onions, & garlic, at least flavor-wise - but it, too, was not up to the high standards of the other recipes I've tried from this site. We both found the texture to be too mealy/grainy. *shrug* We chucked the rest of the mash, but I'm hoping some tzadziki sauce will liven up the leftover lamb on pita sandwiches.

This was very good and very interesting if you're looking to get out of a food rut. But I just felt it was missing something, even though my husband loved it. I might try it asgain on the grill.

This has an excellent flavor. Also, given that all the prep work is in the marinade and the garbanzos take very little work, this is a dish that you can finish without stress when company arrives.

This was excellent. I had made it thinking the chick pea mash would be a good healthy potato alternative, but I found it even more delicious than potatoes, which I love. The lamb was also very tasty.

I had trouble finding the right size piece of lamb, and next time I might use boneless Saratoga chops since there are only two of us. I'm not a fan of garbanzos, but this was great and I happened to have some chicken olive broth from another recipie so I used that in place of the chicken broth. Truly wonderful.
