I was really hoping for a heavier, more bread-y bread pudding. This is much more of a custard, which is okay, but not what I wanted. And it's not even a terrific custard, at that.

A basic bread pudding recipe, simple to prepare. I was out of currants and used 1 cup of raisins instead. I added vanilla and sprinkled extra cinnamon on top. This was definitely better served cold. My 17 year old daughter liked it a lot.
