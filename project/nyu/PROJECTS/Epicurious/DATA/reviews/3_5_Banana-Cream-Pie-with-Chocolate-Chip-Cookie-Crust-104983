Baking the crust as I type this review. I would just love to know how you baked the crust without the cookie dough sliding down the sides of the pie dish. All my dough is pretty much all down at the bottom.

The combination of textures - firm chocolate chip cookie crust and banana creamy center - is utterly decadent. This pie gets rave reviews every time I make it!

Used Pillsbury Peanut Butter Cookie dough for crust. Would be weird chocolate chip cookie crust with what is really an overly sweet basic custard with bananas thrown in. Just ok - will not make again.

We are all banana cream pie lovers, and my kids are in a chocolate chip cookie phase, so I was excited to find this recipe. The custard was easy and wonderful, but the crust was not very successful. No matter how thinly I spread the cookie dough on the bottom, it still puffed up too high. I kept removing some and putting it back in the oven. Then it was very difficult to slice. Then it was way too sweet. In short, I'll make the filling often, but I'll look for a different crust recipe.

I made this pie but used a cookie crumb crust made out of chocolate wafers - the ones you make a chocolate icebox cake with - Much easier and less sweet than the cookie dough crust. It was excellent and beautiful looking! I did replace the rum with more vanilla as I don't think the kids would have like the rum flavoring. The custard is amazing - not overly sweet. Very easy to make and everybody raved...

I made a variation of this (lower fat ingredients, except the butter) and with a meringue crust (with soda crackers crumbs folded in). The meringue crust helped lighten the recipe calories and went amazingly well with the pie. Just remember to make the crust really thick enough to hold up to the cream filling. Wonderful.

This recipe has now become a Christmas Eve tradtion. I made it for my husband's family last year, and they've requested it again this year. I omit the walnuts though, as I can't stand the things. Definitely take the time to read the reviews below. They give some awesome tips.

I definitely enjoyed this recipe! I think that the next time that I make it I am going to experiment with either the rum or the crust. My ideas are to use a coconut or pineapple rum, or a peanut butter cookie crust. I had no problems with the crust because I followed the advice of other reviewers before me, and I used a second pie plate to help the crust keep it's shape. Definitely something that I will make again!

I'm a big lover of Banana Cream Pie, but I thought this one fell a little short. I prefer a pastry shell to the sweet, purchased cookie-dough crust that this calls for. Also, if I were to make it again, I would probably leave out the rum. That said, the pie did receive rave reviews from everyone who tasted it, and it was very impressive looking.

Comments I got back were "rocked my world", "Oh, YEAH!" and "More." Especially since this was so easy to make, it's a great reward for not so much work. I forgot to prick the crust so I ended up with a very puffy crust but it settled down and ended up fine. Highly reccomend this one.

Very, very good. I also had the problem with the crust so mine probably wasn't as pretty as it good of been but the flavors were excellent.

I thought this was very yummy, and not hard at all. Agree that pushing "crust" up with back of spoon after initial baking does the trick. If you like this recipe you should definitely check out the COOKIE DOUGH DELIGHTS cookbook--cookies, pies, tarts, etc. using choc chip and sugar cookie dough. It's amazing.

I had no trouble with the crust sliding or being hard to cut... This pie is time consuming, but easy to make. And it's delicious. Next time I think I'll try pecans instead of walnuts, though.

This was indeed tasty but not particulary easy. I found it rather time consuming if you are planning an entire meal. The crust was hard to slice too.

I made this pie for a pot-luck at work and it was awesome! I esp. liked the not-too-sweet custard with the hint of Rum flavor. The crust did slide down like others said it might so I was prepared and just reshaped it a bit while still warm. I'm going to make it again this week for company.

This became a family favorite after making it for my brother's birthday (he doesn't like cake-go figure!). Now, he expects it for every birthday. I like to give it a light dusting of cocoa and a sprinkle of sliced almonds:)

First things first, this pie tasted great. However, the pie crust did slide down as some other reviews have said but my main problem was that the cookie crust REFUSED to come out of the pan. I greased well, I froze for 1 hour, I don't know what happened. I don't think I would make this again just for this reason. Try the black bottomed banana cream pie instead... it is one of my favorites!

FABULOUS. Tasty, impressive, and only moderate effort required. My guests and family have enjoyed this again and again. Clearly, the cook who rated this recipe only 1 fork didn't follow directions properly. You've got to try this pie!

This is the first time that I've not only made banana cream pie, but tasted it as well. Everyone was so impressed with the creative chocolate chip cookie crust too! Very good!

I'm not crazy about bananas but my husband is, so I made this. It was really delicious! I was concerned about how the crust would turn out based on other reviews. It was great. I used frozen Otis Spunkmeyer, thawed in microwave and then spread on glass pie plate. I did make sure to bring the crust all the way to the top to hopefully help it hold (it did). However, I baked at 325 degrees for about 25 minutes instead. I accidentally put 2 t. of vanilla in the custard and it was great! Even my kids who don't like bananas loved this dessert. (The crust was the best part for me, though!)

This is a great pie. It set up beautifully and looked just like the magazine picture. My husband makes the best chocolate chip cookies and made a fresh batch so I could use some dough for the crust. It did slide down, but it is easily fixed if you reshape it a few minutes before it is done baking. I will certainly make it again. Also, it was not at all soggy the next day. Perhaps a thicker, homemade crust would help with that problem.

I love this recipe. A great combination of flavors. Always a big hit when ever I make it. Takes a little bit of time but worth the effort. Always the first thing to go at a desert buffet around here.

Thought this was tasty. I cut 1 1/2 bananas and placed on top of the custard, then put some more custard on top to cover and then added the remaining 1 1/2 bananas with remaining custard to cover. Makes an attractive pie with the chocolate curls on top and I didn't mind the cookie crust one bit. I thought it complimented the pie.

Everything was great, except the crust. I overcooked it and it took my sister and I a variety of knives, elbow grease and much determination to cut it. However, once it was out, it was great. Will try again, but probably w/ another crust.

This pie is my husband's favorite!!! Whenever I make it for a special dinner with friends, he eyes the portions that are dished out to the guests, and jealously guards the leftovers! In other words, it is delicious and well worth the work.

I have made this three times and everybody loved it.The last time I used sweet chip dough and it was better yet.I guess the "Poop Family" didn't like it because you have to be smarter than the pot and screwed-up the recipe. You are what you eat.So what does the "Poop Family" look like?

This was easy to make, but time-consuming. It is well worth the effort and so delicious. I will definitely make it again.

I did something a little different with this - I made the custard part (which was wonderful!) and layered it with the bananas over broken Nilla wafer cookies in martini glasses. I then put a dollap of the whipped cream on top of each one (with a mint garnish) right before serving. It really gave the dessert a more elegant feel and I got to satisfy my craving for banana cream pie!

I'm not much of a cook, but it was easy to make and it tasted great. I didn't spread the crust out enough so it was very thick, but still very good

The pie was great and very rich. The kids really liked it lots. Plan to eat it the day you make it because the crust gets soggy. Start early to have enough time to chill it.

This is fantastic and easy to make! I left out the walnuts. This was the best banana cream pie I have ever tasted. My husband loved it and constantly asks me to make it every week!

This pie was a smash, it is a family favorite (and I am a big critic). I made it with a store bought graham cracker crust because I was under time constraints, however it turned out great. Note: The pie should be made the day you want to serve it, it doesn't keep well.

This pie is delicious!! big hit with everyone.However,if you have a sweet tooth add more sugar to it and if you want to make your own crust,try the one in the chocolate brownie tart,it´s great for this pie.

I used home made cookie dough, following (sort of)the recipe on the Golden Crisco box. The crust was very good and very easy to handle as well as eat. I used about three quarters of the batch which was a little too much and next time I will use about two thirds instead.

This pie was awesome, it reminded me of Ben & Jerry's Chunky Monkey Ice Cream! I will definently make it again!!

After reading the reviews, I reduced the time for the crust to bake thinking it would not harden as much but it still turned out crispy. Not a huge problem since the pie is so good, this didn't stop anyone from eating it. I also used parchment paper on the bottom instead of greasing the pie plate - this seemed to prevent the cookie from pooling at the bottom. My three year old loved the custard - this was her favorite part!

Rating: 3
Delicious and easy to make. I used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp banana extract for the filling and used the entire pound of cookie dough for the crust!!! Guests loved it and my husband actually asked that I make it again (he's such a picky eater) and yes, they ate the crust like a cookie! However, the next day I found it was a bit too soggy -- definitely needs to be eaten the day it's made.

This is really a great pie, I read the reviews and decided to use my own "shortbread" pie crust and put 1 cup miniture semi-sweet chocolate morsels into it while mixing it up. Turned out really great, guests all raved!

This pie was great. I used Betty Crocker crust mix after reading the other reviews. It was great. I don't do a look of cooking/baking but this is by far one of the best desserts I've made. Highly recommended.

I used the recommended amount of cookie dough and found that the crust was too thick for my liking. The pie itself was quite good, very quick and easy.Traditional graham cracker crust could be an alternative.

Rating: 3
Yum! I also followed the directions to the letter and found the dough slid down the pie plate and collected into a big cookie at the bottom. I don't think anyone noticed - they were busy devouring the pie! I'll definitely make this again and use the idea of the 2nd pie plate.

I didn't have the same problems with the crust as others. Maybe it is a function of the brand of cookie dough? I was sure to get the dough up and onto the lip of the pie plate (I used glass). I did bake the crust a little too long as I would have preferred it to be softer. (Bake as you would a choc. chip cookie.) The custard is easy to make and very delicious. It was a BIG hit at my Easter brunch.

I read the recipe in the magazine (pic looked good), and came here to see if any reviews. Not yet. So I made it. I had problems with the crust like the two reviews that are here now. This cookie dough has so much shortening that it is very hard to work with your hands, even well floured. Then it slid into the pan. I worked on it for about an hour, pushing it back up the sides, backing 10 mins, repeating. Everyone liked it, but the crust was too hard to cut with a fork. They ate the filling, then picked up the crust and ate like a cookie! What I would do next time is work in about a cup of flour so the dough is workable.

Rating: 3
Great quick and easy dessert, though, next time around, I would use a plain crust. The cookie crust was too rich for the Easter crowd. Additionally, when the cookie crust was baking, it slid into the bottom of the dish. In order to correct this, I placed another pie dish in the middle to keep the sides in place.

I liked this dessert and so did everyone else at Easter. It was very easy to make. The only think I would change next time is, I would make the crust thinner. I did not spread out the dough enough, but no one complained. The pie was the first thing to go at dessert.
