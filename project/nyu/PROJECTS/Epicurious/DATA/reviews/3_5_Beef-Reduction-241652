If this recipe had yielded only the reduction sauce, I would have been really annoyed to have invested the time it took to make it. It was good, but not phenomenal. DEFinitely not simmer stuff for a couple of hours good. A much better (and less time-consuming) reduction sauce is to be found with the Roast Beef Tenderloin with Port Sauce recipe here on epi. However, in addition to the beef reduction, (which I served alongside a standing rib roast, prepared a la Roast Beef with Wild Mushroom Sauce here on epi), the shanks and vegetables made for a really, really tasty stove-top pot roast. Frankly, I'll never use this as a stand-alone sauce again, but I foresee using this recipe over & over for a fantastic braised main course to serve with mashed potatoes & a green veg.

This tastes delicious! A few tips: I had trouble getting the shanks to brown - they were nowhere close at the 25 minute mark, so after another unsuccessful 5 - 10 mins, I took out the carrots and onion in case I'd crowded my pan too much, put the shanks back in for another 5 mins and they finally browned on their own. Conversely, the reduction took a lot less time than the recipe suggested, so keep a close eye on your pot. I measured my reduction after an hour and ten minutes and had exactly 2 deeply flavourful cups at that point. Can't wait to incorporate it into the beef tenderloin and wild mushroom dish tonight!

This is the perfect reduction. The only thing is to make sure you keep an eye on it and measure your lliquids constantly near the end because they disappear quickly.
