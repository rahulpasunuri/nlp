Made this for a southwestern-style pre-thanksgiving turkey dinner (featuring a smoked turkey from Greenberg Smoked Turkeys in Tyler TX, try one if you haven't!) and this was one of the hits of the night. Really one of the best stuffings I've ever had. Just the right amount of heat, and the spice goes so well with the smoke of the turkey. Pair with chipotle-cheddar mashed potatoes, smoked turkey gravy, pear-cranberry chutney, and some double smoked sausage ( we had some sent up from the Salt Lick in TX for this special occaision). Ridiculously good.

I spent hours looking online for a recipe that was different from what we normally have, had sausage, and wasn't too hot for certain family members. The only thing I can say is odd about this recipe is that it calls for a product the company he founded makes but not in a quantity they make it in. The Aidell Andouille Sausage only comes in 12oz packages and this calls for a pound. Regardless it was very good and something I'll be making again.

I was raised on cornbread stuffing - but adding the slighly spicey sausage brought it do a whole new level. This is my new "go to" recipe for stuffing! preped the day before just as directions state - cooked separately from turkey - just amazing.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving this year and will definitely make it again. May cut the andouille sausage in half - lots of sausage in this recipe. Also, the vegetables produced a lot of liquid. I ended up not using the chicken broth because I was concerend it'd be too watery. Used Jiffy cornbread mix, dried overnight. Love the sweet and spicy of this recipe.

After years of trying many different iterations of sausage stuffing, this is a WINNER. Moist and spicy. Absolutely delicious!!!

My family's favorite stuffing. I make it every year. I use cornbread and cut it into small cubes. Its crumbly, but works. I toast the cornbread cubes lightly first, to help hold them together. I find the bagged/prepared cornbread stuffing is always just a bag of crumbs. My local grocery store (Wegmans) has great pre made cornbread in the bakery, so it works perfectly. I never cook stuffing in the bird, we fry a turkey. Definitely need to pour broth over, I melt a little butter too, and mix with the broth when pouring over, to keep it moist, and get some fat in the broth, as it would if the stuffing were cooked inside the turkey.

This was amazing last year at Thanksgiving and I will be making it again this year. The only change I am going to make it to cut the amount of andouille in half. I didn't think it was possible, but this had almost too much sausage.

This is my 4th year for this stuffing and it is the BEST! Evveryone I have served it to is blown away. I do not stuff a turkey, I bake it and serve as a side. FABULOUS! It is a bit more "upscale" in presentation then regular stuffings and much tastier. I use bakery cornbread that is sweet in mine (crumble the night before and let it sit in an open bowl overnight to dry out)and extra pepper sauce to give it a surprising sweet and spicy kick.

I have been making this for a few years now and my family loves it. I do use packaged corn bread stuffing and am always happy with the results. Unlike many recipes, I do not tweek this one at all (with the exception of the premade stuffing mix of course).

This is the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner! I'm from New Orleans and my Louisiana family loves it as much as the folks in Chicago. To make it easier, I use Jiffy mix from the box, add jalapenos and let it dry out a little bit more. I also add chopped crawfish tails and the very end. It's fantastic.

I made this a couple of years ago and got a request to make it again this year. Everyone loved it. I made it with store-bought cornbread stuffing (don't remember what brand) and it was great. I may not have used the hot sauce -- I don't really remember. But even if I did it wasn't terrifically spicy. The sausage was fairly mild. Definitely reommend this one and go ahead with the packaged cornbread stuffing.

I want to make this for Thanksgiving but I don't want to use prepared cornbread from a package. How much cornbread should I make for this dish? Will an 8x8 pan be big enough or should a bake a 9x13? What does 12 oz dry cornbread mix equate to? Your suggestions would be much appreciated!

Rating: 4
This looks like a great recipe but I am really debating what to do. Some of the reviewers are using prepared corn bread in the recipe and some are using just the dry corn bread mix. That certainly sounds easier but I worry that it might make a very heavy stuffing. Any suggestions? If anyone has made it both ways, I'd love to know which turned out better.

I have been making this stuffing for years and it is a hit every time. My family starts requesting as soon as fall comes around and they don't stop until spring. I'll never make a different stuffing. I'm asked to bring it to every holiday and potluck we attend.

This is an absolutely fantastic stuffing recipe. Even people who have told me they are not stuffing fans love it. And when I ask my family what sides they want me to make for Thanksgiving or Christmas, this recipe is the first on the list by all of them. It's perfect as is.

Recipe looks good. Made a similar one this year, used chorizo, added dried cranberries but it was too soggy. Was it the cornbread? Did I not let the cornbread dry out enough? Used very little broth and no extra fat other than the sausage. Was nice & spicy from the chorizo! Will definitely try this one!

Rating: 4
This was the best dish on the Thanksgiving table, save the turkey. I had leftover corn muffins from another party in the freezer, which I crumbled and baked to dry out. Used just over a lb. of andouille and no breakfast sausage. Omitted green onions and hot pepper sauce, but added one large dried hot chile pepper (softened with boiling water and cut in slivers). Baked in the oven, as did not stuff bird on rotisserie grill, adding stock as needed. Excellent!

This is great-- the only changes I make with this one is that I use already made cornbread from the bakery, and I add about a cup of dried cherries for a little extra color and sweetness.

Hi GimmeSparks...use bagged cornbread, like Pepperidge Farm, rather than Stovetop.

This looks really good, but I have a question...when it asks for dry corn bread stuffing mix...it doesn't mean like Stovetop cornbread stuffing, right? Just regular dried cornbread in the bags?

I would have to say this recipe is horrible. ONLY because, I have to bring this to every family event. It went over so well, it has been requested at every family get together that we have. I have made this with the point of freezing it in small batches and having it for lunches. As everyone noted it is easy to make and the presentation is wonderful. Enjoy, and mark this one as a favorite!

For a particularly delicious variant on this or another corn-bread based stuffing, try using Epicurious' Cumin Quick Bread recipe in lieu of cornbread.

I had high hopes for this stuffing but ultimately found it a bit mediocre. For one, I think leaving the sausage grease to saute the vegetables was simply too much oil. I would recommend draining most of it and keeping only waht you need to saute the veggies. Secondly, I think the ratio of sausage to cornbread is too high... I'd rather see more cornbread stuffing, and I'd highly recommend using a bread made at home the day before. And finally, I wasn't a fan of the hot sauce in the dish... I'd rather use crushed red pepper in the hot oil/fat to spice things up and forego the flavor of the hot sauce. I will try this combination again with adjustments, because sausage and cornbread has to be a good combination, right?

Great recipe! I made this for a Thanksgiving potluck party and everyone really liked it (had several requests for the recipe!). I made it the night before and used dry stuffing mix which made it very easy and fast (great if you're running low on time)! Next time, I will use homemade cornbread as I think it will make it even better. I followed other's suggestion of adding toasted pecans - great idea! All in all, it was a very tasty and easy to prepare stuffing. I will definitely make it again!

Whenever I make this stuffing I have to make a double batch because my husband will complain if there aren't enough leftovers for him to eat. This is an outstanding stuffing recipe. If you have people who don't like food with a tinge of spice they may not like it. But, if you like flavor with your stuffing you'll love this recipe. I get requests for it every holiday.

A change from the usual stuffing recipes. I made cornbread from a Jiffy's package - and added ancho chiles to the mixture. And added store-bought cornbread to add another texture and variety. Also added toasted pecans as suggested by another reviewer. Substituted chicken sausage for pork sausage. Added jalepenos and cilantro as suggested by another reviewer. Let cornbread sit out for an evening. Mixed dry cornbread and wet mixture day before to allow cornbread to soften. Needed a lot of broth to soften even the day of before putting into oven to bake. I think doing this allowed flavors to come together and allowed for softened stuffing - otherwise it would be too hard. Also used a few dollops of butter when reheating. Overall, I got a lot of compliments, and no leftovers. The result was sweet, savory, tasty, with a bit of spiciness.

We have made this stuffing for the last three years at all family gatherings involving a turkey. Always to rave reviews. We have improvised and found we prefer using all fresh sausage versus using the smoked. Yes, this means we do not use the Andouille. This Christmas due to scheduling conflicts we were forced to use a combination of Jimmy Dean Italian, and Jimmy Dean regular with Sage, to outstanding results. This recipe is not difficult. And always has produced excellent results. As always please feel free to improvise with your favorite ingredients. Cooking is not rocket science.

I made this stuffing along with a traditional stuffing for Thanksgiving. No one even touched the traditional stuffing! The sausage and cornbread were a perfect combination.

This was awesome and very decadent. It was a bit labor intensive since I'm not an experienced chopper nor have a food processor. I definitley think I could've halved the recipe and still have more than enough for 6 people. The andouille sausage is the key to making this recipe one that I will make every year. I was lucky enough to find cajun seasoned andouille sausage that added a little extra kick that everyone loved!

Three forks. I'm still looking for THE stuffing recipe, but this is a good one. My guests liked it (that definitely counts for something). If you're serving 6 or less guests, half the recipe like I did and you'll be just fine. I substitued smoked brats for andouille sausage which would have been a hard find on short notice. I also added chopped granny smith apples and a few raisins. GREAT LOOKING!

This recipe sounded really good, but it was underwhelming. I felt like the taste was missing something. I eventually added cilantro and it truly made a difference.

I really enjoyed making this dish for Thanksgiving. However, I did not like it as much as I anticipated I would but that could be because I'm not used to cornbread dressing.

Had a deep-fried Cajun turkey for Thanksgiving and gave this recipe a try. Used smoked sausage instead of the andouille. I think what throws this recipe off a little is the sage that is called for. I will eliminate next time and use GROUND thyme as the only herb. Has great potential, though.

I made for Thanksgiving leaving out the bulk sausage. The andouille added just the right amount of flavor without overpowering the effect of a traditional cornbread dressing.
