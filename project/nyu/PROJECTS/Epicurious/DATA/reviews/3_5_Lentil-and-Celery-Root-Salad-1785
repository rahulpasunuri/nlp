Very tasty and robust. I did make some changes, of course. 1. I cut and peeled the celeriac BEFORE boiling it. I then boiled it with the lentils, thus reducing the cooking time to 20 minutes. It works great. 2. I used feta, white balsamic, and herbes de provence because that's what I had in the house. Even so, I can imagine what it would be like with the original recipe and think it would be lovely. I'll suggest that all blue cheeses are not made the same. This probably wants a drier, saltier blue than a softer, stinkier one. This is definitely a keeper.

This delicious salad is very earthy and very different. I reduce the olive oil by half and add extra vinegar for more moisture. Fresh herbs do make a difference here.

I liked the celery root and lentils together but thought the blue cheese was a really weird flavor with the other ingredients (and i love blue cheese). I might try this again with either no cheese or maybe goat cheese, but as it is, my husband wouldn't eat it at all. I ate a little of it and then threw the rest away.

We did substitute feta for the blue cheese and dried rosemary for fresh - and our lentils may have been a bit old (between 2 and 3 years) but this dish was bland and unremarkable. We've used celeriac before in a root vegetable puree and I think that we'll stick to that from now on. It was a dissapointment, especially given the reviews.

This is really good. A nice winter salad. Do use French lentils, the texture is really nice. I belong to a organic vegetable co-op, so whenever I get celeriac I never know what to do with it. This is a nice option!

This was delicious, although next time I think I'll reduce the olive oil to about 3 tablespoons b/c the lentils and celery root just didn't absorb any of the oil and they were drowning in it.

This salad is wonderful, flavorful, inexpensive and easy. What more could you ask for! I've made this on several occasions and always get rave reviews.

We have been making this salad since the May 1994 issue came out! It is fantastic, especially as part of a picnic with roasted chicken and a haricots vert salad as it originally appeared in the magazine. The flavors are nutty and earthy and the vinaigrette pulls it together. Be sure to try it with the fresh herbs, they are far better than dried in this dish. We were not especially familiar with lentils or celery root at the time, but this recipe inspired us to use these more often.
