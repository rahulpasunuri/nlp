Just the thing to cap off a leisurely dinner on a cold night. My challah loaf was too flat for me to be able to cut 3-inch rounds from the slices, so I just tore the bread, toasted it, and pressed it in. I thought 3/4 cup for each ramekin was too much custard - 1/2 cup plus a tablespoon seemed perfect. Don't skip the caramel sauce.

What a wonderful recipe! I used beautiful fresh bings instead of dried cherries and Portuguese Sweet Bread. Also instead of individual dishes I made it in a 1.5 qt souffle dish.The cooking time is right on. This is a great way to put a great focus on the ever too short cherry season

I made this - replacing the challah with croissants and omiting the rum and it was terrific! Rave reviews from my guests!

Made these for Christmas Eve. They were very tasty and the perfect ending to a cozy meal. Only thing I would do differently is use less bread (they were a little dry) and add more rum.

I was served this at a luncheon and thought it was delicious. The hostess did not add the rum, and it was still quite good. She made a caramel sauce that added a nice touch.
