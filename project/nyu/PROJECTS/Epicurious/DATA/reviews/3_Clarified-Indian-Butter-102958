No need for cheesecloth! Bring the butter to a full boil and reduce heat to lowest setting to avoid burning, continue to simmer, approx 30 min for 8 sticks, until most of the foam is gone, spooning off any remaining foam. Pour into glass or metal container, the solids will remain on the bottom of the pan while pouring.

I have another way, especially for people worried about burning the butter. If you have some time on your hands, preheat your oven to 300 F, then break up one pound of butter into a heavy bottomed pot or dutch oven. Place in the oven *uncovered* for 1 hour and a half to two hours. When you take it out of the oven, a thin brown crust will be on top, skim that off, and the clear golden liquid is your clarified butter. Also, run a skimmer through it to get rid of as many of the brown milk solids on the bottom of the pan, then strain into glass jars or plastic containers through cheesecloth. After it cools, cover and refrigerate, as it lasts longer this way. Perfect Ghee everytime. :)

Another way of making ghee is by collecting the cream of full cream milk,(milk that has been heated and cooled)...till a thick layer of cream forms on the surface.This cream can be collected and stored in the fridge for upto a week.At the end of the week, after one has a substantial amount of cream....boil it in a heavy pan till ghee separates and a dark brown residue is collected at the bottom of the pan(called khoya)We use this residue to make sweet cakes....tastes good.Anyway this is a true and tried way of making ghee if you bring home full cream milk.
