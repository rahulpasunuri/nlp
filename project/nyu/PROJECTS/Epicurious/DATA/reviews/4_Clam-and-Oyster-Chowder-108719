I made this chowder for a dinner party last night and everybody raved about it. I did substitute 51 oz. of canned clams (available at food service/restaurant supply), omitted the oysters and added fresh thyme. The leeks add a nice depth to this dish. This will definitely be my go-to clam chowder recipe!

An unusually complicated recipe for a chowder, but the results are unusually good! I served this to my Love for Valentine's dinner and cut the quantities by half, resulting in enough for 3 large bowls. He's a huge oyster stew and chowder lover and he thought this was outstanding. I did add a small dash of Worcestershire sauce in lieu of more salt at the final tasting. I love umami, the more the better...

This soup is exceptional, but it's more of a potato and leek soup with clams and oysters than it is a chowder. We used oysters that we had harvested ourselves, earlier that day on the Hood Canal. Chardonnay was the only white wine on hand, and it paired well with the sweet oysters. I would use it again.

I made this chowder without the bacon and old bay seasoning and it was still excellent. I also used nonfat half and half instead of heavy cream to cut down on the fat. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for a day after Thanksgiving gathering with friends. We baked pies all afternoon and this was our indulgent lunch. Everyone loved it. To make it easier, I cheated and used canned oysters and clams. Obviously is you have the time and a good source, fresh are better. But it was still incredible so I'd highly recommend this shortcut as well. I used one can each and added the brine as well as the meat, plus one bottle of clam juice. I also added dried thyme and think that was a nice touch. Phenomenal recipe.

My version had plenty of Manila Clams and fresh- shucked Pacific Oysters. Life just doesn't get much better than this...

We'd add a 5th fork to this one! We were able to use fresh oysters from the Oreg. coast, added Sherry and Worchester, and loved that fact we finally found a recipe that didn't have that cornstarch/flour pasty taste to it. Absolutely fantastic, willl make this again and again.

Wonderfully delicious. Some substitutions: chopped mussells for milder flavor, shallots/onions instead of leeks, fat free half and half, spicy olive oil instead of butter. Keeper for sure.

Every time I make clam chowder I try a new recipe because I am always looking for a better one... my search ended here! This is by far the best clam chowder I ever tasted. I didnt use the oysters because I dont like pacific oysters but I know I will try it with Wellfleets when I get back east for the holidays. Thank you so much for printing this keeper!

This is the best chowder recipe I've ever made! I didn't have any leeks, only onions and it was still wonderful. I didn't need to tweek anything. Absolutely the best. Give it a go!

This was an awesome chowder. I will definetly make this again. I forgot to buy the leeks, so increased the amount of onion and added 6 close of garlic.

This was amazingly good chowder--very rich and satisfying. I used "chowder clams" and chopped them up; otherwise, I made this as written. It's become my new standard for chowder.

This was fairly simple to make and my family loved it! It comes out a little darker than a regular clam chowder but the taste is great. We even got relatives that didn't like oysters to relish this dish. Great for a cold, wet day! Enjoy!
