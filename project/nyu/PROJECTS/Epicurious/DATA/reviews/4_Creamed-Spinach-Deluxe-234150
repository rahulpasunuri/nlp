this is a delicious recipe!! i microwaved frozen cut leaf spinach to sub for the fresh, that cut down on the work of this recipe considerably. i omitted the red pepper and bay leaf because the kids were eating it, otherwise made it as is. highly recommend!

Delicious, smooth, and creamy. My wife is a creamed spinach fan, and she loved it. I was improvising on the proportions as I was working with 2 pounds of spinach, and it ended up a little too saucy for me. Next time I'll add the sauce into the spinach for better control of the end product. The flavor was great. I didn't think it was too much work like some reviewers wrote. Definitely will be making again.

There was a definite bite to it. I used crushed red pepper and ground peppercorns as some reviewers suggested and left the onions in (i.e. didn't strain it). I made the bechamel sauce first because of timing of everything else I was making and it could almost be made ahead of time and assembled with the whipping cream and spinach later. Made it one day ahead of time and was very very good the next day. Paired it with Mashed Sweet Potatoes with Sage Butter to go with the turkey and stuffing. Really great combo.

I made this as a half-portion. It turned out fine and the bechemel strained just fine. That said, having made Rick Bayless moles, know that pretty much anything will strain if you've got some time and a silicone spatula. ;) Straining made the finished dish very smooth which I think adds to it. If you want a chunkier recipe, go ahead and chop the onions extra small, pulverize the peppercorns and flake the pepper. Three stars instead of four because it was a fair amount of work for only two people. As written or doubled it wouldn't take materially more work and is doubtless a four-star recipe. Additionally, next time I make this recipe I'll add more spinach per unit of cream.

I wish I made this the day BEFORE Thanksgiving instead of the day of. The flavor developed more on the second day and was very delicious. I tried straining the bechamel through a mesh sieve, but was unable to do so. I could only get about half to even go through the strainer and it seemed like a waste to me. I gave up and dumped the whole thing back in the pot. Needs salt and pepper to season.

Really delicious flavor. My only complaint is that there is no way that roux can be strained - it is way too thick. Next time I will use crushed pepper instead of peppercorns and just pick out the chile and bay leaves before serving. Delish!

I'm not going to rate this because of the major pathetic substitution I made, though despite that it still turned out well. First, I halved the recipe since it's just me and DH. Used a 12oz bag of frozen chopped spinach, nuked it a bit and drained/squeezed. Used crushed red instead of japones. Here's the fun part: come time to make the roux, I discover I'm out of flour. Neighbors not home. DH suggests bisquick. I throw up a little in my mouth, and proceed as suggested. The batter (let's just call a duck a duck, shall we?) didn't actually taste too heavily of leavening, and it all came together well. It's super yummy, and aside from making extra dishes, the whole straining part wasn't especially time-consuming at all. I'd love to try it again with a properly-stocked cabinet.

This is very good and not too much work if you use some common sense modifications. I see no reason to strain the bechamel, just use cracked pepper instead of the peppercorns and the chopped onion and chile are lost in the spinach anyway. I also see no reason to heat the cream, I just add it to the already hot bechamel sauce and it works fine. My only mods to the ingredients are a fresh, seeded jalapeno instead of a dried chile and about 3/4 cup of parmesan added to the sauce before adding the spinach. The result is a terrific spinach dish that is relatively easy to get together.

I had a bunch of spinach and no idea what to do with it. This turned out great. I added some chopped red pepper and left the onions and peppers in.

Great creamed spinach recipe as written. Addition of diced bacon (about 3 slices) and/or mushrooms (I use dried shitake) really makes it outstanding.

this recipe is a christmas tradition, to accompany our herbed rib roast (also on this site). we omit the bay leaf and chile for the kids, and add a 3 cloves of minced garlic. we use 20oz bags of frozen cut spinach, microwaved without water, to save some time. the key is to wring out the spinach in a clean dishcloth. rich and creamy, the BEST creamed spinach recipe!!!

I have never taken the time to write a review, but this recipe was so amazing that I am finally doing it! I skipped the bayleaf and red chilis and added a small pinch of cayenne as well as a dash of Louisiana Hot Sauce to the final step ... it was delicious! My guests raved, everyone had seconds. This is going to be a staple for our steak dinners.

I substituted cream with organic plain so milk (no sugar added) and it thickened perfectly and tasted excellent! I added nutmeg and garlic as well and eliminated the bay leaf. I also added a dash of cayenne pepper.

This was excellent - we made as a side dish for a steak-house style dinner and it was a huge hit. A little work, but worth it.

Easier way to make the same delicious dish -- Put baby spinach leaves in food processor. Saute the onion with the spices in 1 tab butter (honestly that is plenty). When it is translucent, add the chopped spinach. Cook for a few minutes. Add the flour, mix, then the milk, then 1/4 cup whipping cream. Delicious, and much easier and less fattening.

Excellent recipe. I found some frozen pureed spinach in the freezer and hoped it would enough. I used 1 percent milk, couldn't find my strainer, omitted the chile and it still turned out perfect. This will be a keeper.

This was excellent - I made it once as written to rave reviews, and I also recommended it to a friend who made it for her work party, and she also received great feedback. Last night I had some guests over and I decided to wrap the spinach in bacon and cook it in a skillet (about 4-5 minutes per side over medium-high heat), and everyone was amazed by how creamy, smoky, and well-flavored this hors d'oeuvres was. I highly recommend making it, either as is or wrapped in bacon as a fun starter!

Used chopped frozen spinach and doubled recipe. Used red pepper flakes in place of chiles. Really expelled the water from the spinach. Excellent side with grilled filet mignon and twice-baked potatoes.

The ultimate creamed spinach!!! I made this to try and replicate the creamed spinach I love at a local restaurant, and was pleased to note that this one was even better!!

This was the best creamed spinach that I have ever had. Amazing. I used 1/4 cup milk with 1/4 cup cream in the final step and it was still incredibly rich and creamy. I am freezing some as a side for Thanksgiving, and now wish that I would have made more :(

The BEST creamed recipe, ever! The straining of the bechemel and the adding of cream elevated this recipe. I have taken the creamed spinach recipe and explored it. I have found that there are the extra steps here which can take a very good creamed spinach into something exceptional. In this examination of this recipe, I would advise to not go the "quick" route, but let this recipe take its time , and the heat is sometimes very low and somewhat high, based on the steps. This is the best approach I have found, but it neglects the small amount of ground nutmeg which makes this recipe perfect. This is an exceptional recipe, very high, and yet i can speak from personal experience as having trying to find the very BEST cream spinach recipe: this is it!

Like many others, I substituted a healthy grinding of nutmeg and some freshly ground pepper for the bay, chile, and peppercorns, and I can safely say that this is easily the best creamed spinach I've ever had.

Prepared as written except used nonfat milk and added 1/2 to 3/4 cup fresh shredded parmesan. Topped with fresh ground nutmeg. Excellent taste and texture. Make sure to use fresh shredded parmesan and fresh ground nutmeg.

Good! I used non-fat milk and added Tillamook sharp cheddar cheese to replace the missing milk fat. I recommend a very fine sieve for straining the bechamel.

Did not realize that the "Towel/Steamed Spinach Dance" was noteworthy. Been doing it for years. (Same advice for "Washing workout clothes in hotel sink", but I guess that belongs on another site.) No bay leaf, added nutmeg and leftover creme fraiche. Used as the bottom layer for Eggs Florentine, but could stand alone.

I used fresh ground pepper & omitted the bay leaf, and instead of straining the bechamel sauce I pureed it which worked great, will definitely make this again

I made this as a side with the Roast Pork Loin and Potatoes recipe here on epicurious.com. The spinach was the best part of the meal. I followed other reviews and minced the onion, omitted the bay leaf, used chili powder in place of the raw chile, coarsely chopped the peppercorns and added some nutmeg. I also followed the advice about rolling the cooked spinach in a towel and dancing on it to get it dry. It worked great, but was somewhat tedious peeling the spinach back out of the towel. Cooked the spinach a day ahead and finished it right before serving. Excellent! This goes in my elegant recipe folder.

This was pretty good although I think I messed up a little with the ratio of sauce to spinach (i made less) ..definitely worth a try though.

This was exceptional! Make sure to dry the spinach VERY well after cooking. I rolled it in papertowels to ensure it was free of moisture. I also ommited the bay leaf and red chili, but DID add a touch of freshly ground nutmeg. I also would recommend coarsely chopping the black peppercorns and mince the onion. I wasn't thrilled with the texture of either, as I prefer a silky smooth creamed spinach. Was better than the best steakhouse and got a ton of raves, and often requested to make it again.

I had about 14 oz of fresh local spinach, so cut everything about in half. Rinse, and wilt the spinach with the water that clings to the leaves. No bay leaves in the roux, but a bit of chili powder and nutmeg. Half a cup of milk, and half a cup of light cream. Yummy with pan seared salmon and rice pilaf.

I hate creamed spinach, but made it because my husband adores this dish. I followed the other reviewers' advice and omitted the bay leafe and chile, added more milk, cream and flour. While I didn't touch it, this creamed spinach was gobbled up by everyone else at Christmas dinner.

Omitted the bay leaf, added red pepper flakes, and a handful shredded parmesan cheese. YUM. Also, did not strain the bechemel. very simple. will definitely make again.

In terms of creaminess and texture, this creamed spinach recipe is a winner. However, I was not wild about the flavor of the infused bechamel and I think it may have been the bay leaf that imparted a slightly strange taste. Next time (and I WILL make this again), I think I will omit the bay leaf and the pepper and add a little nutmeg, as one other reviewer suggested.

I substituted a little less than 1/2 tsp ground red chile de arbol instead of the dried. Outstanding!

Delicious! Hint: the best way to squeeze water from spinach is not to squeeze. Roll it all in a clean, large bath towel, place on the floor and do your favorite dance on it for awhile. Works like a champ!

Love the flavors, but needed to add more milk and cream to get the creamy texture I wanted

This dish was great, the only problem I had was the amount of water, 1/4 cup, was not enough, by the time it boiled it had evaporated. I used about 1/2 cup instead and was still able to squeeze all the excess water out and it be creamy. I'll definately make it again.

Great recipe, better than the high end steak houses I've been to. I don't take heat very well so I removed the chili from the recipe and put in some nutmeg for depth. It worked wonderfully.

this dish was SO amazing. super easy and absolutely delicious. it was gobbled right up at the thanksgiving table. i LOVE creamed spinach, have tasted it at all the best restaurants in LA with all the celebrity chefs. this recipe is in that caliber. i dont know who made this one up, but kudos! i put in extra garlic and onions and made a point to reallllllly squeeze out all the water. i ended up adding a little more milk and heavy cream (and a sprinkle more of flour) to make sure the cream was nice and thick. excellent! i will definitely make again.

My husband loves spinach, and it isn't my favorite, so I'm often trying new recipes to find something we both like: we both liked this. I used frozen spinach, very well drained, and skim milk and evaporated whole milk instead of the whole milk and whipping cream to lighten the recipe. It was still very creamy and tasted rich, even with the "light" modifications.

My husband loved this side. We decided it would be a great dish for company and it will keep for a short time over hot water (in a double boiler) much like a restaurant holds food in a bain marie. I did use crushed red pepper flakes instead of the whole chile with no problem.
