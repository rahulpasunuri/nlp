This is easy and tasty - I use thick baby carrots and it always comes out well.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving, and all of my carrot lovers, especially my sister-in-law loved them! It was nice to have a non-casserole veggie on the table. Next time, I might omit the butter since there was quite a bit of extra butter/olive oil mix on the baking sheet.

very simple - very delicious. I was roasting something anyway, so I was able to just pop this in alongside. I melted the butter and olive oil, mixed in the (dried) thyme, and then tossed the carrots in it. I thought I'd used enough salt, but I added a bit more after it was cooked and that really brought out the flavour. We gobbled up far more than I would have imagined, and I will definitely make this again.

Simple and tasty. I served these for St. Pats with corned beef and cabbage.

Normally, I don't serve carrots to company, but this has a nice flavour and colour and is so easy to make that I will. To simplify the preparation I melted the butter in the micro and mixed that with the olive oil rather than dotting on the butter. I would have preferred the carrots to have a bit more texture, mine were fairly soft by the time they had nice, brown edges. Might cut them larger or play with the heat next time. Made it with the wild rice and lentil dish from this menu and they complement each other nicely.

This was good, but then again why wouldn't it be, it has oil and butter on it. Almost anything with oil and butter is good. I'd make it again for something different to do with carrots.

very good flavor; however, carrots shrink dramatically so I recommend you add more carrots.
