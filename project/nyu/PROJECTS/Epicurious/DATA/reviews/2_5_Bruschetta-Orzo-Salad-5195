While this recipe is simple, it is not worth the effort. I found there was too much onion, and not enough flavour. I added salt and pepper without noticing this recipe doesn't call for it, it should. There was too much pasta for the amount of veggies, and the flavour was basic. I agree with other reviewers it needs feta, but why waste it on a mediocre recipe? Two forks for simplicity.

I enjoyed this salad. I fixed it as the recipe reads, with the exception I used a regular onion (not a red one - as I didn't have a red onion). Anyway, my husband and I both liked it. I think, however, that maybe a little bit of salt and pepper, and maybe instead of a red onion, use some green onion instead of a red onion, and add some olives. Also I think maybe some artichoke hearts would be good too.... :)

I've never made this recipe as printed, but I think it's a great place to start. First, I made about 3/4 of the perscribed quantity of orzo (the full quantity makes it too bland). I left out the zucchini and added Feta cheese, which added to the overall flavour. It keeps very well, and I love it for lunch during the week.

Why on earth is this called "Bruschetta" orzo salad??? According to the dictionary on this site, here's the definition: bruschetta [broo-SKEH-tah, broo-SHEH-tah] From the Italian bruscare meaning "to roast over coals," this traditional garlic bread is made by rubbing slices of toasted bread with garlic cloves, then drizzling the bread with extra-virgin olive oil. The bread is salted and peppered, then heated and served warm.

I left out the zucchini and added some extra red onion - about 20% more. I also added sliced Kalamata olives and feta cheese. With a few modifications, this salad turned out great.

A good place to start - agree with other reviewers, it needs some salt and pepper. I also tasted and then added some sliced greek olives and some chopped sun dried tomatoes. Next time I will add some feta cheese (after the pasta has cooled sufficiently.

Very boring, not worth the space.

I tried this recipe and was disappointed. It had too high a pasta/vegetable ratio, and it didn't have much zest to it. Perhaps it would improve with more vegetables and perhaps some feta cheese.

Nice dish for summer, but it definitely needed salt.

This dish was just ok. Typical pasta salad with balsamic vinaigrette, nothing special.

Wonderful flavors but I found that it needed some salt.
