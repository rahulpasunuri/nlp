Run, don't walk away from this recipe!! I doubled it, to play with the amounts of other ingredients. YUK! Dry, Boring, lack of every thing!...I tried garlic. I tried food prossessing all off the ingrediants! I added cheddar cheese. And finally I brushed the little suckers with egg wash and "goya ham flavor conentrate" Hungry diners ate them...but I did not get usual the accolades my cooking gets! "Pigs in a blanket" would have went over better!!! Some simple recipes (like this one I was hoping) work well...some are our standards. A crisp apple in fall with a nice cheddar cheese. Warm apple pie with a dallop of vanilla ice cream! This recipe is non of those!

I think the 1 Tbsp of baking flour should be 1 Tbsp. of baking powder. For a real southern treat, use a cured ham (preferably Smithfield) and replace the mustard/horseradish with a dab of apricot preserves. The salt of the ham with the sweet of the apricot all on a fluffy biscuit -- now that IS good eating!
