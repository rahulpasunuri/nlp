I love this butter. I left it melted and used as a dipping sauce for some steamed artichokes. There was plenty leftover so I served it over grilled chicken the following night. Can't wait to try it over steaks as the recipe recommends next time!

Love this butter! Served it with grilled filet mignons and guests were delighted. Used some of it today over last night's green beans. A versatile herbed butter.
