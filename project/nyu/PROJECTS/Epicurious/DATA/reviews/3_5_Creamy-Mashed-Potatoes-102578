Boring...I kept adding salt and pepper but this dish never got much better thsn ok. However, it's a great base so next time I'll use it and add to it.

Very satisfying, basic recipe. I used Yukon golds and heavy cream - thought about adding some fresh herbs or cheese, but they really are wonderful just simple like this. Next time I might throw in a little horseradish or white cheddar. I have to strongly agree with the others: a potato ricer is the ONLY way to make mashed potatoes.

This recipe is the ultimate comfort food. And it's so easy - i never used to make mashed potatoes before i found this winner. i just made these for dinner, and had 3 helpings. don't say i didn't warn you!

I'll never make mashed potatoes with an electric beater again! I bought a ricer for this recipe and the potatoes met my expectations of what mashed potatoes should be!

I have absolutely no culinary skills whatsoever, and yet I was successful with this recipe. My mashed potatoes turned out wonderfully fluffy (I only used a potato masher). My mom will be so proud when I make this for Thanksgiving!! I can't wait.

I don't usually have much luck with mashed potatoes - they're dry, tasteless, or both. These are the remedy. I don't have a ricer, so I used a potato masher and it worked beautifully. I'll use this as my standby recipe from now on.

Would never have thought to use baking potatoes - but will now never use anything else. Bought a potatoe rice - will never mash or whip again. Travel and reheat well.

To the people who used the immersion blenders: your potatoes will come out gummy if you use a mixer or blender. A food mill or potato ricer will give you very fluffy potatoes.

I usually avoid making mashed potatoes because they turn out lumpy. However, I used this recipe, along with a new handheld immersion blender, and the results were terrific. The blender was super easy to use (didn't have to transfer everything to another bowl to use a regular mixer), and I added enough cream so the potatoes weren't too starchy. Very good with the Steaks w/Rosemary Port Sauce, also on this site.

Very creamy, one thing I did that I think had a huge impact was that I used Yukon potatoes. Sort of gummy but very creamy, my mistake really. But everyone else loved them so I guess it worked out. Very easy with a hand held blender. Looking forward to doing them with Russets.

Made these for my boyfriend before a business trip, you know, comfort food. They really were awesome.

Great!! You don't need all that cream. I would use about 1/2 c. rather than 1c.

Finally, a mashed potato recipe that seems to be foolproof. I only ended up using about 1/3 cup of the half-and-half. Great, low-maintenance recipe for Thanksgiving!

These were great mashed potatoes. I will use this as my "standard".

You can't go wrong with this mashed potatoe recepie. But to spice it up a little, I like to add a turnip or two in with the potatoes to give it a little "umph". Try it. I think you will agree.

I like using sour cream instead of half n half. It gives such a good flavor.

Delicious. Very Creamy. Just a little fattening. Ha ha.

I used half/half instead of heavy cream. They were very creamy -- even with a hand-held mixer. OK, so there were a few minor lumps. They even taste good the next day. I served them with marmalade-glazed ham with spiced-orange tea sauce. Yummy!

Lesson learned: do NOT make this with unpeeled red potatoes (what I had on hand). The end effect is a teal blue mess that tasted great, but was not a feast for the eyes. (Thank goodness candlelight hides a thousand sins!)

I had neither a ricer or food mill, but they still came out extra creamy with my trusty hand-held mixer. This is now the only mashed potato recipe for me.

My husband had never tried these before. When I made them he feel in love with them. I also make regular mashed potatoes and instead of butter I use cream chese. I gives them a great flavor and lots of body.

I left the skin on and used the trusty kitchen aid to mash the potatoes, which left them just a tad lumpy, but that is what I wanted, they were a big hit, will definantly make them again.

Simple and delicious. I've used both a ricer and a hand masher and both are just as good. With a ricer you don't have to peel the potatoes at all. The skins come off in the ricer. I've varied the cream with whole milk and skim milk depending with what we have at home and again just as good. Really. And sometimes I add three cloves of pressed or minced garlic slowly cooked until soft in a tablespoon of olive oil. Yum!

These potatoes were a hit even though you peel them before boiling. In a similar NYT recipe, it says to peel after boiling, which keeps the potatoes dryer and preserves a nutty flavor. But try peeling hot potatoes -- you will scream and die. This is much easier.

This was a simple recipe. The mashed potatoes were awesome. I made it for Thanksgiving, it was a huge success. I plan on using this recipe whenever I cook mashed potatoes.
