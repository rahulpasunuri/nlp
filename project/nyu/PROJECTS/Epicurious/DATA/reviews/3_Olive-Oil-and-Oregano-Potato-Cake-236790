I thought this was a pretty good recipe. I added chopped shallots to the mix and instead of baking as a whole, I divided them into small pancakes and baked that way. Everyone loved these......they were served with a sweetened sour cream and cinnamon sauce.

This was pretty good. Better the first time I made it, and that was in a tin pan, not glass. It did require more time in the oven to crust up nicely, but was better eating. I have a feeling that the second batch was perhaps slightly under-boiled, prior to baking.

This was easy to make and a good alternative to frying latkes for Chanukah
