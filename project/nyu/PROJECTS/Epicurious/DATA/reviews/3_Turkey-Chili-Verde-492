I made this recipe as I am allergic to tomatoes. It was a hit! Everyone loved it1

It's a good weeknight meal. Not mindblowing, but certainly tasty and not fussy. I made it with ground turkey which I think works better in this recipe.

Chile verde doesn't just mean a green chile..it means that you use green chile salsa..this is a really bad interpretation. I wouldn't even attempt something this lame.

this recipe is a great base..add some garlic powder to the recipe when ading the cumin and jalapeno pepper powder...gives it a little extra...its very easy to make...and quick...would also go great withy a ready packet of spanish rice

I must acknowledge both my prejudices. One, for quick and easy meals. Two, against turkey, which I find tasteless. This dish, without doubt, was the easiest thing I have made in months. It was also almost tasteless, not just the turkey, but the whole melange. I can not think of how to improve it or I would as it was so easy that it is almost, almost irresistible.
