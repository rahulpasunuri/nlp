I might be obsessed with this sandwich. Try it with a drizzle of honey. And make sure you have at least 4 slices of bread. You'll want a seconds. Trust me.

A good friend of mine worked as a chef consultant for the Elvis Presley restaurant in Memphis before it opened. He had a chance to talk with Elvis' personal chef and this recipe is close but not quite. According to her, the sandwich needs to be fried in one full stick of butter, not two baby tablespoons. I know the recipe posted is less likely to make you have a massive heart attack but if you want the real deal, don't skimp.

First time I've experienced peanut butter and banana combo in any form, and it was definitely impressive. I added a bit of grated chocolate, and applied both slices with peanut butter. I definitely recommend frying it, it gives it's a nice crispy edge and ensures the filling is warm, gooey and delicious. Nice, easy snack.

unbelievably, melt- in-your-mouth delicious!! i love pb&banana, but didn't think the frying part was necessary. now i won't make anymore fat elvis jokes because i totally get it! used crunchy homemade pb and sliced bananas, because i prefer the texture. this is heaven on heavily buttered toast ;-)

This sandwich is frighteningly addictive! My baby brother loves his with a drizzle of honey...my sister with a few choc chips...my dad adds a dollop of grape jelly! mmmmmmm!

Elvis' cook would actually use an entire stick of butter so that the bread could soak it all up. mmm

I have to admit that at first I had some reservations about this one....but it DOES make one FANTASTIC sandwich.

good as is, but amazing if: you toast the bread first butter the outside of the sandwich pb on both slices slice banana, don't mash grill (on a goerge foreman or the like) dip in honey. not the healthiest, but the best comfort food of all time.

For years I have made open faced peanut butter with sliced bananas on a toasted English muffin. I thought Elvis's version would be even better, but instead it was quite disappointing. Just kind of blah. I'll stick with my usual.

This is a great sandwich.... brings out the "kid" in grown ups... It is a whimsical treat. My only comment is that is it truly an "Elvis" if it lacks bacon and isn't fried in bacon grease?

a slight variation of this makes a fabulous breakfast -- just mash one banana with a tablespoon of peanut butter then spread on wholemeal toast ... if you don't use butter it's quite a healthy start to the day!

I have been making this for years. Instead of mashing the banana, simply slice it. And I spread the butter (a lot less than two tablespoons!) on the bread, then grill it in my waffle iron/sandwich maker. Plus it's great with chocolate. Any combination of Nutella, peanut butter and banana is delicious!

Sometimes I throw a little chocolate into the PB&B sandwich!

OMG, I made this last night for 2 year old son and ended up eating the majority of it myself! It's so simple, basically like a grill cheese except with peanut butter & banana. Delicious!!!
