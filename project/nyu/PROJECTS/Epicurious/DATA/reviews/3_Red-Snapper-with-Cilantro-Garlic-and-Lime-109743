this was so simple and had great flavor! My snapper fillets were skinless so I dusted them with a bit of flour and pan fried them, adding fresh squeezed lime juice at the very end. I also sauteed the garlic with the 3 tablespoons of olive oil and then it to the cilantro and lime zest. Loved it and a new go-to recipe!

This was delicious! Simple, light, and easy. I heeded the advice of other reviewers and juiced the whole lime in the cilantro mixture. I also sauteed the garlic in olive oil and rubbed it on the fish for cooking-- avoids the raw garlic harshness but keeps the flavor on the fish. Will definitely do this again!

I made a few changes to this recipe and it was a delicious easy everyday meal. I pan seared the snapper and when I flipped it over I added the halved lime (the one I got the zest off of to the pan.) I removed the snapper from the pan and added the garlic, cilantro, zest, lime juice and 1 serrano chile to the pan and cooked for 1 minute. I served the snapper over Jasmine rice and it was delicious! (* beware only use 1/2 of serrano chile if you don't like things to spicy.)

I used lime juice, like some others have recommended, and it was delicious. My kids loved it too.

In addition to black pepper, I used crushed red pepper flakes. Yummy.

First of all, that picture is not a picture of THIS recipe, hmmm. This is wonderful and so simple. Don't cook the garlic as some suggested, just mince it very fine, and zest the lime on the finest grater. It is so light and fresh tasting. I served with roasted new potatoes. Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly and was disappointed with the finished product. It was hard to taste any ingredient other than the raw garlic. I may attempt it again, but only w/ many of the suggested tweaks from other reviewers.

I had expected much more from this recipe. Both my husband and I found it lacking in flavor. Perhaps adding some additional ingredients would help.

As a person who is learning how to cook N.Atlantic fish, this recipe was very easy! And very delicioso! A hit last nite.I served with tri-color pasta. Very good addition. Will do definitely again.

I thought the recipe needed some kick, so I threw in one thinly sliced jalapeno as well as one tablespoon of lime juice. I also had to pan-fry (my broiler is broken). I added the mixture to the pan in the last 2 minutes of cooking and served immediately. The result was very tasty.

Easy, easy, easy. I served it with couscous and everything was done in the time it took to broil the fish. I used lemon b/c that was what I had on hand and it was tasty.

I made this for myself so I had extra "topping" (I added some finely chopped jalapeno and the juice of the lime). I cooked some soy angel hair pasta with some petite pois and then tossed with the extra topping and served alongside the fish. I thought the raw garlic added a nice freshness to the dish and didn't need to be cooked.

I ended up pan frying the snapper as my oven was in use. While it was cooking, I added the cilantro, garlic, lime mixture to soften the garlic just a little (we weren't fond of the idea of eating raw garlic that night!). Not only was the aroma wonderful, but the meal turned out so well; easy, fresh and flavorful.

I thought this dish was very delicious. I served it with a asian-styled cucumber salad and basmati/wild rice. While the rice was cooking I chilled the the fish in the cooking pan with oil and some lime juice, which gave it a nice flavor. Great as a light refreshing meal on hot days.

Delicious! I served it to my family last night and they all thought it was light and flavorful. The lime zest and juice really make the dish.

It was easy enough and my husband seemed to appreciate it -- and that's why I gave it two stars. I did not think much of this recipe; it's just ok. I will not be making it again. There must be better recipes for red snapper.

Exsqueeze me? A Southeastern VARIATION of an ITALIAN dish? No offense, but someone needs to spend a little more time researching before writing. Analagous, maybe, but a borrowed rendition never. Let's get the cultural facts straight, please, least one comes off as an egocentric fool.Remember, where did pasta really originate from...

I wasn't sure how raw garlic would fare on the dish. So after I put the garlic/cilantro/lime zest mixture on the fish, I microwaved the fish for about 30 seconds. I think that brought out the aroma in the garnish. Extra lime juice also helps.

Um-This sounds like a decent recipe but are you sure you have the correct photo? Sure looks like grilled chicken breasts with a mint garnish to me!

Delicious and somewhat different from the usual quickie recipes. A nice, fresh-tasting, go-to recipe when time is short.

A light, tasty and quick entree! I made it with the "Lime Cilantro Sweet Potatoes", also from Gourmet, and corn-on-the-cob. I seasoned the snapper and let sit for 20 minutes prior to cooking. Also added extra lime juice. I will defintely make this again!
