Very good; I wouldn't boil the asparagus first next time as I like them only lightly cooked. The butter was amazing! http://noshesthoughtsreves.blogspot.com/2011/04/fast-and-easy-passover-cooking.html

This was excellent. I didn't have any lemon juice and it was still good without it. I roasted my asparagus and then put the topping on for the last few minutes.

Way too much butter!! It made the topping soggy, not crispy. I'll be going back to my regular way...Trim asparagus and place on baking sheet. Drizzle w/evoo and toss. Toss with 1-2 cloves minced garlic. Sprinkle w/kosher salt. Broil about 3 minutes. Sprinkle with parmesaen. Return to broiler until cheese has browned and garlic is crisp. Sooooo much better!

I posted a review in 2004, and I have to add to that. Still fabulous and loved by all, and apparently idiot-proof, too. I made it today for Easter, and I forgot to boil the asparagus first, so I just broiled it for a few minutes longer - - just as tasty, and less work, too. Doubles well and is almost no work. I make the parm butter in advance and bring it to room temperature when ready to use it. A great side for a big meal.

It smelled like a restaurant in my kitchen! We all loved this recipe, even my 8-year- old. I followed the recipe as written, using dried basil. Next time I will cut down the butter a bit. Don't overcook the asparagus it will cook further in the oven.

Delicious! Full of flavor, fast and easy dish to make. Made it for a dinner party as a side dish and my guests raved. They gobbled it all up. So easy to make I made it for myself again as a light snack the following week. Yummy!

This is outstanding! It's a family favorite. I have tried tossing the asparagus and spreading the mixture over the top/mostly on the tips. Our preference is to spread it because we love the crunchy topping, just a personal preference.

This recipe is awesome. I changed a bit and used half white asparagus and fresh grated parmesan-ramono (for that extra kick)and i also use a vegetable peeler to take a bit of the lower skin off the asparagus, will help if aparagus is tough. Before you put it in a broiler think of presentation...can be a homerun. Definately will make many more times

mmmm! This recipe was delicious and VERY easy to make. My normally non-vegetable eating brothers-in-law even ate this! I did as . previous reviewers suggested and tossed my asparagus (used yellow squash as well) with the butter/garlic/basil mixture first then sprinkled it with the freshly grated parmesan before putting it under the broiler. Will make again because it has great flavor and is so easy to make.

Out of this world! Included it as part of our Thanksgiving meal. Great way to add a vegetable without alot of fuss. Will make a fritata out of the leftovers tomorrow... although there aren't many.

I usually just steam asparagus but I had a bunch that was a few days old and looking a little wilted, so I wanted to add some other flavors. This recipe was a perfect way to dress them up and disguise any not-so-fresh taste :) delicious, VERY rich. easy to make but seemed very fancy when served.

Super recipe - and, the parm butter would be good on a number of different things (potatoes, zucchini, etc.) Definitely an easy, but tasty, recipe for weeknites or guests. Don't overcook the asparagus! Remember that it will go under the broiler again.

The recipe is great, but I prefer a more traditional au gratin. So I toss the asparagus in the melted basil butter, put them in the flameproof dish, and them cover them with the shredded parmesan. Then I put it beneath the boiler set on high for 3-4 minutes. That gives it a golden au gratin crust. The recipe also works with tarragon (but use less of it!).

The best part of my Valentine's Day meal. Grilled the asparagus, and didn't have basil so I used thyme instead. I also warmed the butter in a saucepan before broiling. Excellent!

Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe. The "clumpiness" is part of the appeal!

Rating: 4
I brought this dish to Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. I wanted more uniform butter/cheese coverage so I put the butter mixture in a double boiler just long enough so I could whisk it into a heavy syrup consistency (not completely melted) and then drizzle it on the asparagus. You don't want to start cooking the garlic, so heat it only until it softens to the correct thickness. I also put the asparagus in a big enough pan prior to broiling to have only one layer. This insured every piece had the browned butter/cheese on it. I also grated fresh parm over the spears prior to broiling. I love good Parmagiano Regiano, so the added work was a labor of love!

I got so used to just marinating and grilling asparagus - this was a terrific alternative. Attractive and delicious. As always, not overcooking the asparagus is key.

Hmm... tried the no-blob method. Maybe it's better "blobby"? It was alright. And there is such a thing as too much lemon juice. I used as much as the recipe said, but think I should have used less. Still good... just not 4 forks worth.

SO GOOD! We love asparagus and so I'm always looking for new recipes. This one is definitely a keeper! Very easy to make and really tasty. The browned parmesan butter on top is so delicious! Serve fresh from the oven to help with the "blob" problem but no one will care either way once they taste it...

Rating: 4
This is fantastic and will have those who swear they dont like asparagus eating their words along with all the asparagus! My guests loved this dish and I have learned to make 1 1/2 to double the recipe. The process leaves a nice crusty toasting of parmesan on your asparagus and the butter is on the bottom of the pan. SO SO TASTY!!

This is the best asparagus I have ever had. My guests raved about it!!!

Great flavor, poor presentation. The parmesan blobs melted under the broiler to flattened parmesan blobs. If you picked up a spear of asparagus, the blob came right with it. I expected it to melt to a sauce, but it was very solid. Maybe more butter-to-parmesan ratio?

Don't bother with the cooking in water first, just cook in oven at 425 for about 10-15 mins in the same pan you plan to broil in. Then add butter topping and broil. I cook asparagus in the oven all the time, just add a little olive oil roast for about 15-20 mins.

This was very tasty! I made the parmesan butter and steamed the asparagus and chilled it ahead of time, then assembled and grilled at teh last minute. Yummy!

This dish was so tasty. I had a dinner party and could not believe that there was hardly any left. Next time I may cut down on the butter topping and not spend extra money on fancy cheese. Be sure to watch it as it broils to prevent excess browning.

This is an incredibly easy dish to make and yet delicious. If I'm busy, I'll just lay slabs of butter on the asparagus and cover with parmesean. After broiling, I add the basil and lemon juice. I've made this dish often and it's always a hit. The quick browned cheese look and smell is very tantalizing to the senses.

I made this for Easter dinner- everyone was asking for the recipe! After having read the other suggestions, I made the butter mixture without cheese, spooned that over, then put the cheese over top of the entire dish. Definitely a good dish for people who haven't had asparagus before, too.

Good. I reduced the amount of butter to cut down on the greasiness. It's a good idea to melt the butter and pour over the asparagus, and then sprinkle the parmesan over to fix the clumping problem.
