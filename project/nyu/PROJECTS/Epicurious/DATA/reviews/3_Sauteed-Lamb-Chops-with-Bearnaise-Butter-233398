The bearnaise butter was not very easy to make and did not come out well for me. It was way too buttery and didn't have much more flavor. However, the lamb was very tasty and worked great with a mint jelly.

I read the recipe and thought 'how simple'! I love bearnaise sauce. So with that in mind this is the recipe for you. A quick, simple and good recipe. Maybe not a special occasion recipe but great for the hubby on a Friday night.

The dish was delicious because of the lamb itself, not because of the way it was prepared or the special butter. Although I did not pan fry it--I put it on the grill. The bernaise butter was not a "Wow", in fact most guests preferred the mint jelly that I also had available.

Easy and quick. Great for Christmas dinner and I could concentrate on other dishes and/or enjoying my guests. Made the compound butter, rolled it into a round cylinder and refrigerated wrapped in plastic until needed. Used a quarter-sized slice of butter on each chop and it was plenty; I grilled a rack of lamb, carved it when perfectly cooked, and arranged the chops/butter on a platter of greens and cranberries. Froze remainder of butter for use on steaks or lamb again. Lots of flavor for something so simple; use less butter and save some calories for dessert!

Such an easy dish to prepare & wonderful to eat on a lazy summer's day. Of course a delicious salad & a glass of red round it off.

This is really pretty simplistic, no? Fry some lamb chops in a pan and add flavored butter from another recipe? I would never fry my lambchops and I would never use any under 1-1/2" thick. Grilled would be my first preference for preparation (seared over direct heat 3 mins/side , finished over indirect 4 mins). In a pinch I'd broil them, but mind them carefully. Lamb fat loves to catch fire!
