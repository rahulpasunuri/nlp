Made these shortcakes last night for a dinner party of 6. There were two biscuits left over and some of the peach filling----but only for about 10 minutes. The guests really loved them. The orange sugar in the receipe makes this. I used polenta cornmeal instead of regular because I had just enough left for the receipe. For the filling I omitted the vanilla (put that in the whipped cream) and put in two shots of Grand Marnier. Yum!

I made the biscuit recipe exactly (okay, except I used skim instead of whole milk!), but instead of the filling and preparation, I mixed the peaches up with cornstarch and sugar and triple sec and poured it into a 9x9 glass dish. Then I just dolloped the biscuit topping all over, and baked for maybe 25 minutes. SO YUMMY! I love the biscuit topping!

One of the best desserts in the whole world!

This is a simple summer dessert, a nice alternative to strawberry shortcake. I loved the orange sugar, I will certainly make that again to top other desserts.

My family loved this, used fresh Colorado peaches and followed the recipe exactly. Will make again and again.

made this several times and it is always a hit. The crunchy corn-meal biscuits with the sweet peaches rocks!

Made recipe to a T (wish more reviewers would do that on epicurious!). Hmm! Delicious. Changes I'd consider next time: orange zest tastes bitter once baked so I will use a carrot peeler to make strips to press into the sugar and then discard stips once sugar is flavored. The biscuits didn't rise as much as I'd like despite rounding up the measure of powder. I also used coarse corn meal; nice crunch and texture but perhaps better to use 1/4 coarse meal and 1/4 fine meal. This will be doubley good in the summer months with fresh peaches! Looking forward to sharing this recipe with others.

Really delicious and easy to make. Everyone always seems to lick their plates when I make this!

VERY good, very easy and fast. I substituted lemon zest for the orange peel and added a splash of peach brandy....

This dessert was wonderful; the orange sugar was a great touch. The cornmeal biscuits really tasted great. Served out of the oven, they are divine, but be careful because they crumble more easily when they are cut while still warm.

Am making this recipe for the 3rd time this evening. Just burned a chocolate cake!!! Have to come up with something fast, which this is! Great summer dessert! Good alternative to strawberry shortcake. I added orange peel to the biscuit batter for more orange flavor. My family gobbled this up! Also grated more peel for the sugar mixture, spread on biscuit before baking. Reheated in microwave, drizzled w/honey for breakfast! Cornmeal gives a great texture.

Family and friends thought this was delicious. The biscuits were a bit crumbly, scone-like, but the cornmeal added a nice textural note. We just added more peaches and cream to the top. This is great for breakfast, too.

This recipe was wonderful..it was a little different with the cornmeal instead of flour and with the grated orange on top of the cornmeal bisuits...a great variation of a traditional strawberry shortcake! Use GEORGIA peaches for the BEST flavor!

We thought this recipe was good...but needs modification. Biscuits were a bit dry and bland. Perhaps a bit of gran marnier upon serving? Ginger in the cream? Not sure whether we would make this again...

These were delicious! I used canned whipped cream to save time. The orange-suger topping is a must. I served them with vanilla ice-cream.

These biscuits are the most exquisite things that just melt in your mouth. Do yourself a favor and make them. Can use canned peaches for year round deliciousness.

Delicious - my company loved it. I added the juice from the zested orange to the peaches. It tied in well with the orange sugar topping. The cornmeal provided an interesting and unexpected texture.

Incredible! This is my all-time favorite dessert. The orange sugar is a very nice touch.

I thought this recipe was delicious! Since many reviewers complained about the sugar being too much I reduced the zest to 1 tsp and then strained out the zest when I was through. It was perfect. I also like a sweeter biscuit so I added 1/3 cup sugar. I think this would also work well with strawberries. Will certainly make it again.

The biscuits were delicious-light and flaky, although mine didn't rise very much. Because of other reviews, I didn't bother with the orange topping, but I did sprinkle them with a little sugar. My peaches could have used more flavor. Next time, I might add more sugar and/or peach brandy and nutmeg or ginger.

It was good but skip the orange/sugar topping, it's far too overpowering. I liked that it was not too sweet. The corn and the peaches compliment each other well.

Easy and delicious if you have tasty peaches available. Toasted leftover biscuits for breakfast the next morning. Topping on the biscuit was the best part.

Fantastic dessert, big hit with our company! Will be making it again this weekend!

The result was quite tasty, although the orange-sugar mixture was a bit too much. Both children and a few adults didn't want the top slice of the shortcake
