Great recipe that I simplified as it is quite fussy. I brought it for 60 at Thanksgiving and now four others have the recipe, it is that good. If they all don't hijack it for next year, I'll make double in a roasting pan!

I love Brussel Sprouts simply steamed but needed to convince a veggie-skeptic. This dish did the trick! I followed other reviewers notes and made the following tweaks: 1) skipped blanching the veggies and just cooked the casserole dish 10minutes longer (before adding breadcrumbs). 2) caramelized the onions (I didn't have shallots on hand). 3) reduced the cream. 4) used real bread to make the breadcrumbs and added more 4) added additional sage to the topping, 5) reduce the pine nuts to 1/4 cup (saves $$ and just as tasty). Will be making this again and again!

I love this recipe! I brought this as my contribution to Thanksgiving last year. It was the first time I had ever made it, thus rendering everyone at the table a guinea pig...and it was a smashing success. I made it again at Christmas, but this time with only Brussels sprouts (I had been on a major Brussels sprouts kick), which I kind of liked even better. A few notes: 1) Make sure to reduce the cream enough. The first time I made it I didn't and then had to bake it longer than the recipe calls for in order for the cream to reduce (it turned out just fine). If this happens to you then... 2) ...make sure you wait to add the pine nut/crumb topping so it doesn't burn. 3) I used 4 lbs of Brussels sprouts the second time and ended up liking the consistency MUCH better. 4) I strongly suggest using good Parmesan 5) Make your own breadcrumbs (do NOT use seasoned crumbs from a stuffing mix). Stop at a decent bakery and buy a loaf of day-old bread, break it up and dry toast it in a skillet or the oven. Then crush in a ziploc bag. 6) COSTCO. If you want to make this, but are on a tight budget, you can save a lot on the Brussels sprouts, heavy cream (the extra can be used to make whipped cream!), good parmesan and pine nuts (or get these at a place where they're sold in bulk because they are VERY expensive). I'm so excited to make this again!!

This was very good and a perfect Thanksgiving side. I made a few tweaks the first time I made it: - Didn't blanch/shock veggies per so many review comments that this step was unneccessary. I agree, it is. Veggies cooked fine although I had to cook covered a bit longer than recipe called for to get them tender (but that may just be my oven) - Used pecans instead of pine nuts. I love pecans and think they pair so nicely with Brussels. Plus we're in the South so it's always pecans! :) - Didn't have fresh parsley so I omitted it. - Put some Parmesan in the topping because I think you taste it more there What I'd do differently next time: - For the cream mixture, I'd start by caramelizing the shallots, letting cool a bit, then adding to the cream mixture. I think it would be nice to get the richness and bit of sweetness from caramelizing them - Would add a touch of sage to the topping instead of/addition to parsley to really give it that Thanksgiving flavor (I didn't think the 1 tbsp called for was overpowering at all) - Make more topping than what was called for - that's one of the best parts, right?! - Season generously. The amount of fat in this dish needs to be cut through with an ample amount of salt and pepper. Overall I think this is a yummy dish - agree with others that it's rich, but at Thanksgiving I think it's a nice, indulgent side.

Instead: White sauce with sage and parmesan  2T butter, brown sage and shallot or onion, 2T flour, 1 cup milk: make white sauce. Add ½ cup parmesan. Stir in cauliflower. Certainly easier and quite good.

Rating: 4
Yum yum! After reading the reviews I decided to go light on the cream and cheese, plus I only had half the sprouts and I knew I could very well work my way through the entire dish if I wasn't careful. I used 1 C. cream and a scant cup of parmesan - the richness and flavors still came through but the result wasn't truly a "gratin". I omitted the nuts and breadcrumb topping altogether and just broiled (uncovered) for a few minutes at the end which was a nice finish. Also, I would only blanche the sprouts and cauliflower for 1-2 minutes next time. My husband, who doesn't like b. sprouts, deemed this "edible".

Rating: 4
This was just fabulous! I didn't blanch first and am glad I didn't because 50 minutes total was actually a bit too long for my taste....the sprouts were getting a little soft. Next time I will shave ten minutes off and it should be about perfect. This will go in my regular weekend rotation now since I'm in high fat/low carb mode after reading "Good Calories/Bad Calories." Awesome!

I agree with those who posted earlier there is no need to pre blanch the veggies. I made this for a Christmas Eve gathering and then for a New Years Eve party. First time I did blanch it next time I didn't and it didn't make a difference? This was very rich but a nice treat not something I would make all the time.

Last Thanksgiving this was hands down the most favored side (beating out stuffing AND mashed potatoes). I made it a bit lighter using half & half (thickened with a little flour or cornstarch) and omitted the sage and pine nuts- though walnuts might also be good. Sooo good. It is a much tastier option than that wretched green bean casserole thing my Mom makes (sorry Mom).

The only thing wrong with this recipe is that it will give the average person a coronary. I make it reducing both cheese and cream by at least 2/3 and it is still a favourite at Thanksgiving each year. The pine nuts are wonderful in this dish!

I was really excited for this recipe since I love cauliflower and brussels sprouts, but honestly after finishing I wish I'd just eaten them steamed with a little parmesan and pine nuts sprinkled on top. This recipe is just not worth the effort and VERY heavy. If you want something heavy just bite the bullet and make some mac and cheese.

This was quite rich, so of course my husband who does not care for either vegetable loved it! Me, not so much, thus the 3 fork rating. I did not blanch the vegetables and they were perfect. I will try it again next winter and recommend that you try this one and decide for yourself.

Rating: 4
Fantastic dish, everyone liked it. I cut back on the cream (one med carton, about 1.5 cups) because that's what I had, and on the Parmesan cheese - because it seemed like a lot. It came out great - maybe I had a bit less veg, because it fit perfectly in the 2 quart casserole dish I used, instead of the suggested rectangular pan. A nice winter veg dish with lots of great flavor and texture.

Having lots of left-over brussels sprouts and a head of cauliflower, I was very lucky to stumble across this recipe. I also stubbornly refused to buy additional ingredients, so I made lots of substitutions (only 1 C. of pecorino-romano, only 2 C. cream, onion for shallots, poultry seasoning for fresh sage, dried parsley for fresh Italian parsley, and cracker crumbs for bread). It wasn't quite the decadent dish I was expecting, and the sauce never came together, but it was absolutely delicious. My fiance insisted that I make it again when it was gone.

Wow-0-Wow! My friend made this as a Christmas Dinner side dish.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner. I thought it was a little too rich but, no one else seemed to think so. I am a lazy cook so, I didn't cut the pieces as small as the recipe states and wished that I would have.

This is soooo good! My mother made this for Thanksgiving last year and I make it as a treat every once in a while. Don't substitute the heavy cream, using 1/2 and 1/2 doesn't produce the same results. Splurge.

I liked the idea of this recipe, as I love brussel sprouts, but this gratin came out a bit too cheesy and rich for me. We used milk and a bit of flour instead of the cream, but followed the directions for the cheese. I'd suggest using 1 1/2 to 2 cups of the parmesan. Or maybe try something that melts down a bit easier... a mild cheddar? The pine nuts were a great addition and the fresh sage is a must. If I make this again it won't be a main dish (as it was this time).

My friend brought this for Thanksgiving last year and we all went crazy for it. She omitted the pine nuts because we have a friend with a nut allergy, so when I made it for Christmas, I did too. I didn't miss them at all. This is now a family staple at holiday meals for me!

Excellent, simple dish to prepare. I recommend doubling the breadcrumb mixture as a precaution. The pre-cooking/ice water bit was not necessary if time is short. Simply add an additional five or so minutes onto the oven cook time. Prepared this dish for a family Sunday dinner and there were raves all around the table. Definitely a keeper!

I made this with purple and orange cauliflower I picked up at the local farmers market (gave it a bit more color). Typically, cauliflower and brussel sprouts aren't vegetables we serve when entertaining, but this one was such a hit with the family, we'll fix it for our friends, too.

Truly the yummiest thing I have ever eaten. I love brussels sprouts and caulflower, and who doesn't love cream and cheese? I did not blanche the veggies and they were perfect. I cut the cream by about a cup, and used half and half for that matter. And I cut the parm to two cups. Amazing flavors, and without the blanching it's a really quick dish to prepare. Very rich, but I would make this with a roast on a weeknight, that's how yum it is.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was such a hit that it was called for an encore performance for Christmas dinner. There's something about breadcrumbs, cream and cheese that makes things extra tasty, and this is no exception. I'm making it again for a party next month. It might become my signature dish. I agree with previous reviewers - no need to blanche the veggies first, just drop them in raw, they'll do just fine.

We had to bring Brussels Sprout to an organized dinner and we live an hours drive away. THIS DISH WAS PERFECT! We did the first portion of baking, kept it hot in a thermal, covered dish, and asked the kitchen "crew" to put the topping on and do the final bake. We did not par-boil anything and also made it a day ahead. The only leftovers were a yummy, creamy drops! (And requests for this recipe!)

I've been asked many times for this recipe. Echo the recommendations to skip parboiling. It is also flexible in terms of time & temp.

It was as good as when I followed the directed temps & times.

Rich and decadent are appropriate descriptions for the killer cream sauce in this gratin. Thanks for the suggestion not to blanch or parboil the veg. Totally unneccessary.

Like others, I served this at Thanksgiving and it was the favorite side dish of many that were served. A few changes by necessity; not enough Parmesan so also used shredded guyere, the pine nuts seemed a little rancid so used chopped pecans, and finely chopped red onion instead of shallots. A little left over and reheated the next day was even better! I plan to make it for a Christmas potluck next week.

After all the great reviews I was a little disappointed with this dish. I took the recommendation of not blanching the vegetables first and they came out fine.

My family really liked it but I thought it was just ok.

Loved it -- made it low fat though -- I made a roux w/ 2 T butter, 2 T flour and then added 2.5 c skim milk in leau of the cream. And I cut the cheese down to 2 c instead of 3. I used a mixture of parmesan and romano. Even my 2 year old loved it!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and it turned out really well. However, I did not boil the veggies first (and I'm glad I didn't; I'm sure they would've been over-cooked otherwise) and I think next time I will only make 1/2 the amount of cream sauce. It's kind of overkill as written, in my opinion.

This was just as wonderful as others have said. Didn't read the reviews before cooking so I did cook the veggies--I liked the fact that they melted into the sauce, but I did cauliflower, kale and beet greens--so you really did have to cook the greens and get all the liquid out of them. I would recommend the greens--as much as i love brussels sprouts, the cabbagy tendencies of both the sprouts and the cauliflower might be too much--the kale just tasted so healthy and pungent. The only other change was pecans instead of pine nuts--great! And I of course hadn't read the recipe carefully enough and missed that it called for parsley--didn't need it. I had also thought that this is an ideal dish for veggies--you certainly wouldn't miss meat after eating this.

This gratin was the surprise star of my Thanksgiving table this year. I've tried a lot of different Brussels sprout side dishes as part of the menu in past years and this one will is leagues above the rest. On the advice of other reviews I didn't par-boil the veggies. I sliced the cauliflower 1/4 inch thick after quartering the head instead of making florets. I quartered the Brussels and cut a 'V' out of each piece to get rid of the stem. The end result was perfect; the cauliflower had a bit of crunch and the Brussels melted in your mouth. The cream mixture was amazing, don't skip the sage for flavor it really makes the dish. This is really an amazing side for any Holiday menu (even with picky eaters)!

I made this for this year's Thanksgiving and a couple of people thought it was the best dish of the whole meal. I ran out of parmesan and grated some piave. I used about a half a cup less cheese than called for since I ran out, but I think it could have used that extra half cup so don't skimp on the cheese! It was great leftover too.

In my house we call this kind of dish 'naughty good'. I made this for Thanksgiving. Everybody raved about it. Even those who originally grimaced at the thought of brussels sprouts ended up going back for seconds. It was the hands down hit of the meal. I followed the advice of others and added the vegies raw to the dish. They were cooked perfectly. I did two other things differently. First, I used asiago cheese instead of parmesan. It was fantastic. The other change was in how I cooked it. It had to travel about 45 minutes before it was to be served. So, I cooked it the 40 minutes covered, then took it with us. When we got there I added the topping and cooked it for 20 minutes at 375. Perfect. This is a very rich dish, worth every calorie, but it won't be on the weekly menu. It is perfect for special occasions.

I just made this for Thanksgiving; I'm a vegetarian and wanted to bring something I could eat. However, the family members I shared it with loved it as much as I did. I didn't have a problem with the vegetables being soggy, but might skip the blancing next time just because I do like vegetables to be crisp. It was a hassle to make, but well worth it. Best recipe for brussels sprouts I've ever eaten!

Having read all the reviews, I opted to skip the blanching step. However, my cauliflower could have been more uniform in size because some pieces were still a bit too soft. Also, I think that using all cream made it a bit too rich and next time I will probably use half & half. It was still a hit at my parents house and everyone has asked for the recipe.

I agree - no need to boil the vegetables. I had to add a bit more cream than was called for, but I think I reduced the cream mixture too far so that was my fault. I think it could be improved by adding horseradish and/or dijon mustard to the cream, but it's delicious as-is!

Take a moment to read that the reviewers that said they made the dish for Thanksgiving, are from Canada, where Thanksgiving is celebrated the 2nd Monday of October - and is a holiday to give thanks at the end of the harvest season. Nonetheless, I have already reviewed this dish, but would like to add that it does better reheated in the oven, rather than the microwave. I covered it with foil for a bit and then removed, allowing the topping to be a bit crispier. The microwave made it slightly soggy.
