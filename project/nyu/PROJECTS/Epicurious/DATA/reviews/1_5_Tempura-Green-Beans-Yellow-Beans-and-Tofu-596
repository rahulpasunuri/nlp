Recipe for batter is very easy compared to others. We sprinkled tofu with red pepper flakes and pressed them into the tofu strips before dipping in batter. We also made a dipping sauce of equal soy sauce, japanese wine vinegar. One adds a bit of sugar to his dipping bowl. Oil must be 350F or batter will be greasy. Keep warm at 325F oven on wire racks over jelly roll sheets. This is really a heat and serve dish. Does anybody know how the restaurants keep their tempura crisp and hot?

I haven't tried the dish yet, I just want to apoligize for the comments made by my fellow New Yorker. We are not all as mean spirited and shallow.

Blah, Blah Blah...hey cook from NH, did you try the recipe or what...who cares what you think. There are much better tofu recies than this one. Doesn't really hold up.

To Cook from 11/24: Foods cook more evenly if one starts closer to room temp. Good steaks and roasts (and many other foods) should always be brought out of fridge for a little while before cooking so that the inside is still not cold while the outside is cooked to death. As an aside (for a previous reviewer) I have been eating tofu daily for years, frequently at room temp and have never had a problem. It is a vegetable, not raw chicken. The important thing to remember is to change the water daily after purchase (per package instructions).

Why is it not a good idea to cook things straight from the fridge? is that a taste thing or a health thing?

I wish to respectfully disagree with reviewer "kensatake" from Vancouver, B.C. While it is certainly important to avoid cross-contamination of foods, I seriously doubt that leaving tofu at a moderate room temperature, covered with paper towels, for one hour, poses any health hazards. We in the Western hemisphere tend to forget that much of the world lacks refrigeration, and people are not dropping like flies from leaving food at room temperature for a sensible amount of time. We also tend to cook foods straight from the cold fridge - not a good idea. Note: I haven't made this recipe, nor do I intend to, but I just had to say my little piece.

I have read that tofu should be treated as meat: that is, it can breed salmonella and the like and SHOULD NOT be left standing (also be careful of cross-contamination of other ingredients)!! A safer way to "dry" tofu is to gently press the block between a cutting board and a cheese grater, allowing the excess moisture to be squeezed through the grater.

Rather disappointing. In my modest interpretation, the dish was edible but absolutely unremarkable (granted, I skipped the yellow beans, but then again I am sure that would not have helped it much). Much too oily in the end, and not even crispy as I had hoped.

I mixed up the dipping sauce, tasted it, and spilled it out, used another dipping sauce recipe. The batter had a nice flavor, but I was keeping the cooked tempura warm in a low oven (which has worked with other tempura recipes), and this came out all gluey, stuck together, and generally gross. If serving immediately from oil, this might work, but I was cooking for many people, and the original batch would have been cold before I was done. I will not try again.
