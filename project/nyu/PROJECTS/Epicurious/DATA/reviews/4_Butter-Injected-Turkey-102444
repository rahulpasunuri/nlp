I didn't make this turkey, but wanted to rate it just to counteract the bad rating given by Marcia Michaels from Boston, MA, who, for some reason, gave it one fork for not being HER recipe. What's up with that?

Injecting the butter can be tricky if you don't have a proper tool. But if you can manage this recepie never fails to yeild a moist and tasty turkey every time.

My 16 year old son wanted a butter turkey this year. This is the best recipe I found. The meat was incredible, very buttery and moist. It got rave reviews, add some fresh citrus fruit in the cavity of the bird. This gives a great flavor and helps keep it moist.

The turkey came out really juicy, I changed most of the ingrediants, but overall it was easy to make. Everyone loved it, and there was no leftovers the next day.

I have a question and wasn't sure where to post it. Is it possible to use this recipe, sans stuffing, with the other recipe on Epicurious, the Honey Brined Turkey? In other words, would it be okay to butter inject a honey brined turkey?

I wasn't sure about cooking the turkey at 500 degrees, but I gave it a shot anyway. Oh man! That was the most tender and moist bird that I've ever eaten. I wasn't the only one who thought so, because the leftovers were gone by the second day. I don't know if the stuffing recipe was any good since I used my own, but I will be cooking a turkey using this method for Christmas.

By putting the butter inside of the turkey it makes the turkey moist inside. When the butter comes out into your water it makes it good for basting, because it helps brown the skin on the outside. I also use poultry seasoning, putting some on the inside and out.

Since turkey has such a bland taste, I think it always requires some seasoning other than salt and pepper plus the one sprig of thyme. I learned from my mother to emulsify 1/2 lb. of unsalted, melted butter; 1 medium size onion, chopped; 2 large cloves of garlic, minced; 1 heaping tbsp. fresh thyme, chopped; 1 tbsp. Hungarian paprika; a pinch of sage; 1 tbsp. salt & freshly ground, black pepper to taste. Use blender at high speed. Smear inside and entire outside of dressed bird and transfer to roasting pan with rack, breast side down. Roast at 450 degrees in pre-heated oven for about 1/2 hour. Reduce oven temp. to 350 degrees. Roast for approximately half of entire cooking time and turn bird breast side up. Basting may or may not be required or desired. This method of roasting insures a tenderly moist and flavorful turkey without any need for bodily puncturing! The dressing is cooked separately.
