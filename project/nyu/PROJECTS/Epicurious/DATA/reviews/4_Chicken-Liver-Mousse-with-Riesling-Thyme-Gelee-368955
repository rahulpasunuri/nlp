This is just so delicious I'm making it again this Christmas. It is not for the calorie conscious by any means but what a treat. I definitely recommend the Riesling Gelee although it would be great with any good fig or fruit jam or gelee. Sure beats the nasty liverwurst I grew up with.

I join my voice to the choir. Just made this for a group of 10 very discriminating women, themselves excellent cooks, and they were all raving about it. I just doubled the shallots quantity and caramelized them with half an apple, peeled and finely diced, before sauteeing the livers. A winner and absolute keeper !

My Father in law says these are the best chicken livers he has ever eaten in his life. The light sweet taste of the Gelee' was a perfect compliment for the richness of the liver mousse.

Review is only for mousse as I did not have time to make Gelee. Mousse very nice, only strained once and consistency was fine. Next time would increase thyme and perhaps Calvados as I thought could use a bit more umph. Will try with suggestion of caramelizing shallots from another reviewer. Makes a fair amount which is nice for hostess gifts.

This recipe was met with raves, and I will definitely make it again. I only strained it once, and still found the texture perfectly smooth and delicious. The recipe makes plenty--I put it in glass crocks and brought it to parties as a hostess gift.

Made this recipe for Christmas Eve. Be forewarned that this recipe requires a significant time commitment albeit mostly inactive. My family really loved this recipe but I only really liked it. The Reisling gellee is what gives it 3 forks. It was a delicious touch and together with the thyme made for a lovely presntation. The double straining was a pain but it made for a silky (almost typed unctuous but that might be perceived as pejorative) texture which was great. The mousse needs a flavor boost as it was a bit mild for my palate. Possibly more reduced calvados or caramelize the shallots a wee bit before adding. The leftovers will make a heavenly Beef Wellington stuffing but the recipe requires too much time to make solely for that application. I am glad that I have left-overs.

Agree with WOW! So tasty and elegant and worth every calorie!!! Used it as part of a Christmas Eve appetizer buffet and then used the leftovers in Beef Wellington on Christmas day. Only thing I skipped was the 2nd straining step. I like the bit of texture left after the first and might consider skipping this step altogether and calling it paté. Agree that the gelée is not to be missed. I cut the mousse recipe in half but was afraid to mess with the gelée - but will give it a try next time.

Made this for my husband's holiday office party and all I can say is WOW! It was easy, delicious and a huge hit. The only change I made was that I used regular brandy because I didn't have Calvados. I would suggest putting this in a shallow dish so that you can use as much of the gelee as possible...it really makes the dish!
