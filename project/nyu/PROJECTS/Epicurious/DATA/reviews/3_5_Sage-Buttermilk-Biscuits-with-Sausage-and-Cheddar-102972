Made just the biscuits. Didn't have buttermilk, so I used plain yogurt. Increased shredded cheese to 1/3 cup. Amazingly delicious and light. Cooking time of 15 minutes was perfect. Maybe those who had trouble with that amount of time have an oven that runs hot.

Exceptional. Quote from husband, "This is perhaps the best thing to come out of this kitchen." (And I'm a very good cook.) We added some fresh dill to biscuit mixture. Then we cooked up three fresh figs and a splash of maple syrup into the sausage while it cooked. I'd give it five stars if I could. What I don't understand is how this could serve 8....

Could I make them beforehand, a day earlier (perhaps) and freeze any extra biscuits

This is a great breakfast that has become a staple of our weekend mornings. We always use pancetta instead of sausage and omit the cheese slices. Instead, we grate a little parmesan over everything once it's assembled and then broil it for a minute. Yum.

I did the same thing as the first reviewer -- swapped dried herbs (Herbs de Provence, in this case) for the fresh sage, and omitted the sausage. They couldn't have been better: light, flaky, buttery, sublime!

This review is for the biscuits alone, as I didn't make the sandwiches: I subbed the safe for thyme and rosemary, and used lowfat buttermilk by mistake. They were absolutely perfect.

The biscuits were very good- very light and the sage was a welcome addition. Can't speak to the rest, since I used vegan sausage patties, cheddar, and scrambled eggs as filler- which was very good, but obviously, not in line with the recipe as stated.

These turned out really well! Since I"m vegetarian I didn't use the sausage for the sandwich, and instead used eggs cooked w/ tomatoes and sharp white chedder. I agree with previous reviewers that 15 min baking time is too long. Mine were perfect at 11 min.

These biscuits were fantastic straight out of the oven, as is. I'm sure they would be even better with the sausage and extra cheese in the middle; I just didn't have the bulk sausage. Now, I've only made biscuits a few times, but is it usually the case that the biscuits get quite a bit drier once the cool off?

I had difficulties with the sausage. Moderate heat didn't brown them (and didn't really cook them through); medium high browned them but still didn't cook them through. I highly recommend using Italian breakfast sausage (the kind that comes in a roll) as the spice complements the sage nicely. I needed to up the buttermilk to 1 C--in August in California, it was just too dry with 3/4C. The biscuits are also delicious on their own!

These were good. I forgot the buttermilk and they were fine.

The biscuits are decently light even with the cheese added, and the flavors go very well with sausage. This is a winning brunch dish.

I made these because we have ALOT of sage in our garden (easy to grow and very hardy). They're easy and delicious. I agree that the cooking time is a bit much. They were nicely browned at about 17 minutes. I suggest checking at 15. Our oven is a bit whacky.

We "Loved" this recipe! The biscuits were light and fluffy and the sausage and sharp cheddar was a nice combination of flavors. There is only 2 of us so stuck the rest in the freezer and they nuke up very nicely. So long.....fast-food breadfast sandwiches. LOL

I made these a few months ago and they turned out incredibly!

Very yummy, but the recpie over states cooking times. The first baking of the biscuits should be a minute or so shorters. Also, when you reheat leave them in the oven for a few minutes, 10 minutues is way too long nad results in burned biscuits.
