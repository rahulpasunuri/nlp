I found this recipe to be incredibly bland, with the need to tweak the sauce a lot in order to make it tasty, ultimately throwing it out. If I am going to make and eat something rich, I want it to be good! Luckily, I tasted the sauce before adding the chicken, the chicken was great.

My family loves this dish. I sometimes add sliced mushrooms and always make extra sauce. The buttered egg noodles with chive add are great with it.

The sauce disappointed me. The chicken was fabulous before I put it in the sauce, though. It had a great, flavourful crispy crust.

Very yummy, quick and easy. My husband loves it.

SO easy. And really tasty; it garnered the proverbial rave reviews all around. Would be a great "date dinner" recipe, for its ease and "wow" factor. I served it with polenta and sauteed mushrooms. The sauce was a touch too sweet, so I tossed in a dash of vinegar for balance. The amount of butter + cream isn't too indulgent, if made per recipe. However, influenced by the comments below, I did double the sauce. This probably contributed to the clean plates and the happy diners but *was* rich. For a more reasonable "everyday" version, I'd stick to the prescribed proportions, and save the more ample amounts of sauce for special occasions.

Very good, easy, mildly hot but tasty.

Quick and easy. Next time, I would sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper.

This is the easy-to-make recipe that looks and taste like more effort went into it--that I have been searching for. Perfect dinner party recipe!

Quick- great on those busy nights Delicious- Nice consistency(well I added a lil wonderama), pleasing kick to it(I added a lil more paprika), would definitely make again.

I would make this recipe again. It was easy to do and delicious. I doubled the sauce since I read the other reviews before and was glad I did. Next time I will also add more onions. My husband loved it.

BORING...tried to spice it up with more paprika, garlic, and red pepper flakes all to no avail. There are much better chicken recipes.

This was the very first thing I have ever cooked, and I didn't burn anything! That just shows you how easy it is. We made it with rice, and make sure to double the sauce because that made a lot of difference.

I loved this recipe and so did my 17 year old daughter. I doubled the sauce and served it over rice. My husband was not too excited about this recipe but know that his favorite meal is sloppy joe's.

I enjoyed this recipe alot. It really depends on the quality of paprika you use. I used a combination of sweet and hot paprika and it came out great. It's easy to make and very tasty. Next time though, I will double the sauce.

It was OK, but nothing special. Used half-and-half and also spicy paprika and it just was fairly bland..

Fantastic recipe. It tastes great and is very simple and quick to make.

Next time i make this i will use hot paprika. The sauce was good, but i didn't feel the paprika i used lent enough flavor to it. The sauce is extremely rich even though i used half cream and half milk.

This is now one of our favourite chicken recipes. I've tried it with vermouth instead of wine, and I've added mushrooms as well. We liked both variations.

Delicious & easy to prepare. Used fat-free half & half to lighten and thought the sauce looked too thin at the end so I added a cornstarch slurry. Even the kid enjoyed this one.

This dish was super simple and delicious. It's easily doubled and makes enough sauce for potatoes or rice on the side. Will definitely make this recipe again.

I made this with 3 chicken breasts and doubled the sauce. I also used low fat sour cream. It was good, but didn't knock my socks off.

This was very good. Very rich, though. It's definately a keeper. My husband and I fought over the extra chicken breast (made 3 & doubled the sauce).

We loved this dish. I used half and half instead of cream to lighten it A BIT! It was flavorful and very good.

Definitely a keeper. Didn't have any wine, so I used some leftover champagne. Taste seemed a bit bland, so I sprinkled some chicken granules and that seemed to do it. I also used 1 very small onion, 1 small shallot and 2 cloves garlic instead of the one plain onion to add a bit more flavor. Turned out very well and will certainly make again.

This may be a simple dish but it's absolutely heavenly. I've made different versions of this dish and this one is my fave. I didn't have cream -but did have sour cream to substitute and it came out perfectly. The sauce is great! Cooking time was a bit longer but the chicken breasts I had were a bit larger than usual. I served it with egg noodles which was a perfect traditional sidedish.

Good simple dish. Tried it with sour cream, but I found that to be a bit overwhelming. Reduced the efectiveness of the paprika. If you are going to try this, consider using 1/2 cup portions for the sauce. Better too much than too little.

I liked this one, adds a little zip to the week. The sauce came out a little thin but I know for next time.

Great basic recipe---however to cut some of the fat, I've used low fat sour cream with great success--punches up the taste of the sauce quite well. Just don't boil it after you add the sour cream or it will curdle.

This is delicious and easy! My husband and I both loved it. Used 1/2 cup wine and cream as I wanted a little more sauce - this is a keeper!
