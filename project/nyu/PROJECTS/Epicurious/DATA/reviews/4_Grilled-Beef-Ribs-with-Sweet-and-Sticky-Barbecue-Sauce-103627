This is really a delicious receipe, meat fall off the bone & not greasy. I slow cooked ribs in the stock until all liquid evaporated, then I added the remaining vege. to the overall sauce for basting. I trashed any leftover sauce after my husband used for basting, next time I would save it & use it as pasta sauce. My kids loved it so much, and they wanted me to double it next time. Won't be long before cooking this one again.

First time I ever made a BBQ sauce.. came out GREAT!!!! With an added touch I soaked the 1 rack of ribs in 4 bottles of Corona Beer over night. Everyone loved them... they want another BBQ This weekend.

I followed the recipe to prepare the ribs (the boiling part) and used my own sauce. The main improvement I add to the recipe is smoking the ribs with hickory for about 1 1/2 -2 hours on indirect cooking. Now it's real BBQ and not just grilled meat with sauce. The boiling insures tenderness and saves a few hours of time on the grill.

This recipe would work well with any decent bbq sauce. I used a combo of Sweet Baby Ray's and some thai chile dipping sauce. After the ribs had simmered for an hour -- I agree onion, celery, etc. not necessary -- I let them sit in the braising liquid for a while, then let marinate in the sauce for about 20 minutes while I heated my gas grill. I turned off one of the burners and grilled on low indirect heat for about 20 min., turning a couple of times. MMMMmmmm. The beefy flavor really shines through.

I have never made or eaten beef ribs before and probably won't again. The meat was very tender but fatty and difficult to get the meat from the bones. The barbecue sauce was just okay - the ketchup really is the stand-out flavor:(. Not a repeat in our house.

An excellent recipe, and works equally well with pork ribs. Given the intensity of the barbeque and sauce flavors, I don't think the addition of the onion, peppercorn and celery to the boiling of the ribs adds anything discernable, however.

I won't rate as I didn't really follow the recipe other than to cook the ribs following the recipe and add some pineapple juice to our standard chili sauce/ketchup/lemon pork rib sauce. Good, but I'm definitely more of a fan of pork ribs. Beef ribs - even the back one's that my husband found on sale just have too much connective tissue for me. Even with the pre-cooking and grilling the substance near the bone was tough and chewy.

Have made it twice this month. The only thing changed was to substitute 8 oz of orange juice and a few drops of molasses instead of the pineapple. Fabulous.

hands down best rib recipe. family/friend favorite, make it every year! so easy and soooooooo good.

Rating: 3
This worked out great for me, as it was my very first attempt at BBQ ribs. I made some changes that I think are necessary to tell: I used short ribs instead of back ribs, browned on the stove top, then added water and veggies. After bringing the mixture to a boil, I transferred, covered, to a 325 degree oven and simmered for an hour. I grilled the next day with sauce and they were delicious and tender. I also used the sauce on a couple of chicken breasts for the non- beef-eaters.

Awesome recipe! I have never cooked ribs before, but this is now an entry in our family favorite recipes. I changed the sauce a little bit by adding some molasses and some different spices, I also added chopped garlic with the celery and carrots.

So good! I only had time to marinade chicken and flank steak for 3 hours and yet, the sauce permeated the meat. I didn't do the boiling, onion, celery and carrots part, just used the marinade. Again, everyone raved.

I have made this recipe many times over the years. The first time I made it I did not have enough ketchup so I used molasses to make up the difference and it was incredible. I now use about half ketchup and half molasses (sometimes more molasses than ketchup) and always get rave reviews!

I wasn't a big fan. Even my kid didn't like it. It was also a bit of work, after all. I think I'll stick to just simple marinades.

Very very very very very good! I made this for a bbq for some french friends, and they adored it. Served it with a potato salad and corn on the cob. I didn't use beef though, I used pork, and as I don't have a grill, I cooked it in the oven for about 45 minutes, and then broiled it on high for about 6 minutes. Turned out perfectly. Will definitely do it again.

I hardly ever give 4 forks but this dish deserves each one of 'em. I have made this now several times and each time it is superb. Yes, it makes a lot of sauce, but then you can use it for other things (it keeps a long time in the fridge, too!) We found boneless ribs (sounds like an oxymoron, no?) at Costco and although I was leary, I used them and WOW, they were so tender. And it's nice not to have to worry about the rib when you're eating from a plate on your lap. So, don't be afraid fo those boneless "ribs" they have at Costco. And make this dish - it's SO GOOD!

My husband loves beef back ribs and this recipe was delicious. I highly recommend it. Instead of using the BBQ, after boiling ribs for about 45 minutes we baked them in the oven at 500 degrees F for about 15 minutes on convection, then lowered the temperature to 375 degrees for another 20 minutes. Worked beautifully - the meat was moist and the sauce was sticky - carmalized, I'd say. Very nice alternative to rib roast or pork back ribs.

I substituted 3 bottles of chili sauce for 3 cups of ketchup. This has become one of the favorites of the summer.

Rating: 3
If I could I'd give this 3.5 forks. I made it and everyone enjoyed! I used OJ instead of pineapple and also added extra crushed red pepper for a little extra oompf. Next time I will use the crushed pineapple to give the sauce more body/thickness. I reccommend you don't "over-baste" with this sauce as a little goes a long way, also I don't really think using it as a dipping sauce post grill was that good. But it is DELISH cooked on the meat. This recipe yielded so much sauce I had a lot left over....so I tried it on pork(mmmmmm!) and chicken - it was delicious and versatile, if you 1/2'ved it you'd probably have enough for the amount of ribs the recipe calls for. I'm going to make this recipe again for my 4th of July cook out. Make sure to have plenty of napkins on hand because as the name implies -- it is sweet and sticky (and yummy!)

The sauce tasted like flavored ketchup, not all sweet or tangy. Not worth the effort. The Cherry Cola glazed ribs are much better and well worth the effort.

Rating: 4
This was very good. I reduced the sauce in half since I only had half the amount of ribs (4.5 lbs). I boiled the ribs for 1.5 hours, then marinated them in the sauce for a couple of hours before grilling. Worked great.

Rating: 4
These ribs were a delight. I made them several times with minor deviations from the recipe and they could have earned the blue ribbon in a cook off each time. However I suggest boiling them for a shorter period to prevent the meat from seperating and grilling a little longer.

I'm not "forking" this recipe, because I made so many changes to the sauce. I only had about 1/2 as much ketchup as I needed and so substituted 1/2 c "bbq sauce concentrate" (very strong stuff), and a cup or so of plain tomato sauce. Needed to about double the amount of pineapple to get the desired sweetness, but omigod, it was good. Even the boyfriend who lived in Texas for years, and is very difficult to impress with BBQ or chili, loved it. Next time I will try the recipe as written. Watch the grill for flareups, though; due to the amount of sugar in the sauce, a conflagration is bound to happen.

Well, we did this at the last minute and therefore had to make some substitutions. After reading other reviews, we subbed orange juice for pineapple since we were out and didn't want it too sweet. We also added fresh thyme from the garden, a bit of fresh rosemary and a bit of tarragon, as well as piling on the red pepper flakes. It was truly heaven and I don't usually care for ribs!!! Do not even think about skipping the 1 hr 10min boil!!!

I'd rate this a 3 1/2 forks. It wasnt the best I've ever had, but it was pretty darn tasty. Everyone loved it. The sauce was great. Next time I'll try it with the baby backs instead of the beef ribs. I will be making this again for the 4th of July weekend.

just one thing to add for this wonderful recipe for anyone who lives in a city and is deprived in not having a barbecue, this is definitely the way to cook ribs. just put the ribs under the broiler with lots of the sauce and turn a few times, and voila ... you'll think you we're in the country

I've made this twice now - the first time using spare ribs and the second time using baby back ribs and short beef ribs. The spare ribs were the best. Did it both times on a charcoal grill with some hickory. Had some of the sauce left over so I put it on some hamburgers I grilled - they were wonderful! I used 100% ground beef and only added salt and pepper - next time I may add some sauce inside the meat to add a little flavor and moisture. Definitely a great recipe! Loved what the vegetables and peppercorns did to the flavor of the meat also!

This was delicious. I didn't have quite enough catsup, so I used about a half-cup of bottled chili sauce and omitted the red pepper. The ribs were tender, and the barbecue sauce was out of this world.

This was wonderful and everyone loved it including the kids. I made it as written to keep the heat to a manageable level for young ones but I would LOVE to add more red pepper to the sauce and actually sprinkled it on after cooking to my own plate. My aunt said she does not normally like ribs because she doesn't care for the sauce but she LOVED these. I do too. I used spare ribs and boiled for over an hour the night before and it was very easy to throw it together at the last minute and grill them. Perfect!

This recipe is a keeper!I also boiled the ribs a little longer. Very tender. The sauce is wonderful. We like heat so I added a little more red pepper. We also use the sauce to marinate and top our pineapple hamburgers. Best of all its easy!

The sauce was better than any you can get in the stores. I made the sauce once and used it on two different tries with the ribs. You need good meaty ribs to make this a four fork meal. I boiled the ribes a little longer than it said to, witch made the ribs so tended. The ribe go good with corn and or bake beans. I will make it again and again...

I've made this twice and really like it. The sauce is sweet--which I like, and the ribs are tender. After my first attempt, I learned how imporant it is to tend these on the grill because this sauce wants to get charred if you don't turn them often.

The sauce was incredible! It was so good, I ate about 4 sizeable spoonfulls before I put it on the meat. I know a lot of people said that it didn't have enough kick, and normally I prefer a little zing too. But this sauce is going to be a staple in our condiment tray. MAKE THIS BARBECUE SAUCE!!!

I forgot - the name of the recipe is SWEET and sticky. That's what the sauce was! If you're looking for barbecue sauce with depth, spice and a little kick - don't try this recipe. Lots of honey, ketchup & pineapple - I should have know! At the last minute, I had to thrown in a bottle of spicy prepared sauce to kick it up. The crowd I serve to is tough! The boiling of the ribs - great - I'll do that part again.

these ribs were good...of course i deviated a bit by adding a few cloves of garlic..cumin and chili powder...and about 1/2 cup of my red wine vinegar which added lots of depth ...ummmummm is all I have to say about this recipe..this is a keeper

These ribs were very tasty. I added 2-3 times the recommended amount of crushed red pepper, as the sauce didn't seem to have enough spice. Even so, it wasn't too hot for my husband, who does not like spicy food. Until the sauce had cooked for awhile, it tasted quite ketchup-y, so if you taste the sauce early, do not dismay! If it helps, 3 1/2 cups ketchup is one 36 ounce bottle.

This was fabulous! I used 12lbs of ribs and fed 9 people (5 teenage boys and 2 bachelor friends)as well as my husband and myself. Didn't want to heat the kitchen up too much so I simmered one batch in a large lagostina roaster on the barbeque, they turned out great. The sauce is excellent! Serve with LARGE napkins and enjoy!

This Recipe is awesome, plain and simple. One note, once the water starts to boil with the ribs and other ingredients, then you should time them to cook an hour. So the total cooking time for the ribs will be roughly 1.5 hrs. If you're grilling on charcoal, use hickory woodchips to give it a nice, smokey flavor.

Despite boiling the meat and cooking the barbecue sauce, this was an easy recipe. The ingredients are readily available, and easy to prepare. I used individual short ribs rather than the racks, and I halved the recipe. The ribs were tender and delicious, and took very little time to grill. This would be an excellent make-ahead recipe for a cookout on the grill.
