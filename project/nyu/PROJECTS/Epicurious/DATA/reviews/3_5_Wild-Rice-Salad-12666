Served this salad last night and loved it. Made it with red rice, added cucumbers and subbed dried cherries for the raisins and toasted pine nuts for the almonds. Will definitely make this again as I loved having the leftovers for lunch.

Rather tasty. Definately halve the oil. I used flax seeds since I was out of nuts, but it definately needed the crunch of the nuts. I also added some salt. Would make it again.

This is my Potluck recipe! It is lots of chopping, lots of food, very pretty and yummy! I increase the balsamic or use a bit of apple cider vinegar, add some agave nectar (like honey, which will also work) and add OJ. I try to end up with about 2-3 times as much "dressing" as called for. I use dried cranberries instead of raisins and add fresh strawberries. Pinons are a good sub for almonds if you don't have them. I also, rarely have time to wait for the rice to cool, so I just mix everything as it is ready, with no problem. If you use some boxed wild rice mix that has a seasoning packet, I usually use two boxes and one spice packet. This recipe can totally handle personalizing and tweaking, and it is fun to make it unique each time.

I used to go to Vicki's all the time growing up for the chocolate chip cookies, the aram sandwiches and the WONDERFUL wild rice salad. I am so happy to have the recipe now that I live away from Boston! The dish I made tastes exactly like Vicki's - so flavorful and tasty! It is one of my favorite salads. And who knew you would have such great food to serve to vegan friends?

This salad did'nt impress my quests at all. It was o.k. nothing to rave about, it was blah. I won't make it again. Alot of work with not much taste.

Great tasting recipe! Using the suggestions of other reviewers, I used half the oil and used golden raisins. Made the dish the day before and let it sit in the fridge overnight to let flavors meld/develop. Came out beautifully.

Yum Yum Yum! Deleted tomatoes and carrots and forgot the raisins, also I think there's way too much oil--I used half what the recipe called for. With these modifications I would give the recipe four forks. My picky family ate this right up and the leftovers were terrific the next day.

Really pretty and colourful, but didn't taste like anything spectacular. A lot of prep work - too much for something that wasn't that stellar.

Easy and elegant make-ahead recipe. Good flavor and visual appeal. (Serve in a crystal bowl on your holiday buffet table!)

Outstanding recipe. Brought it to an outdoor barbeque and it held up beautifully and looked good, too. The combination of chewy, crunchy, sweet and tangy was great. By far the hit of the buffet which consisted mainly of the standard potato, macaroni and pasta salads with mayo based dressings.

Haven't fully prepared this dish but had a hand in helping with it. It is DELICIOUS!

The jalepeno was a bit much for some of my friends taste so a next try with it on the side for those that like it hot. but still a lovely side item

I was disappointed with this recipe. The veggies and raisins and almonds were a good combination, but they deserved a better dressing. The balsamic vinegar was overpowering and bland at the same time. I added different ingredients to try and spice it up, but no luck. I brought it on a camping trip. My sister made another wild rice salad which was much better and it had lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, and much more garlic.

A great summer salad. This morning I'm making it for the second time this month. Leftovers the next day or two are even better.

I used 1 box of Uncle Ben's Wild Rice & Seasonings, a cup of Sun Maid's Fruit Bits instead of raisins and added 2-3 cups chilled shrimp. YUM!

I have made this salad twice and it has received rave reviews both times. I used more celery and carrots, no tomatoes, and added green onions. Also I elimintated the peppers as a personal taste choice. Sounds like a lot of changes, but the end result is so good! The balsamic dressing is fabulous in this dish.

Absolutely wonderful! I doubled everything but the rice and the nuts, used golden raisins too. Served it at Thanksgiving - this salad was the hit of the meal! Unusual and delicous.

Great recipe with wonderful ingredients, plus it's made ahead so it's easy for entertaining. I added more of each of the vegies and used toasted pine nuts. Next time I will cut the vegetables up a little bigger and use less rice. This recipe easily makes enough for 12!

Wow. Confetti in a bowl is it. Not only is it beautiful, but it is delicious. Didn't change a thing. Everyone raved. Makes alot more than just for 6, but it disappeared anyway.

This recipe has such wonderful flavors. I made it for a dinner party and it was colorful, tastey, and it blew away the rest of the meal. I used golden raisins and added salt and pepper.

Nice side dish, flavorful and moist. Loved the taste of the dressing. The raisans and almonds and the wild rice with the dressing is a great taste treat!

This is a wonderful salad and if it gets better the next day, I can't even imagine!

What a great "different" side dish. I was hesitant to put the dressing on the rice too early - I was afraid the rice was going to absorb the liquid too much. BUT, as the days have gone by, I seem to be enjoying the leftovers better than round one - the rice is still very moist, and the flavor is even more enhanced.

Fantastic taste. A perfect summertime feast. I used grape tomatoes cut in half (instead of reg. tomatoes) and dried cranberries (instead of raisins). I believe making the salad the day before helped meld the flavors even more. We had some left so I put some fresh cooked corn in it and wow, even better. I will definitely make this for a large crowd.

I used toasted pecans and dried cherries-both were great in the salad. I also used red and yellow tomatoes. It does look pretty with all the colors and this is a great dish to take to amy pot-luck or serve to vegetarians. Everyone loves it.

I've made this dish several times for guests. It always receives compliments and is a great make-ahead dish- colorful and full of veggies. I omitted the raisins and nuts and it was delicious. Everyone always has seconds!

This is a great one - one of the best Wild Rice dishes I've ever had. I served it for a small gathering and it was a big hit. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. Nice touch.

We scaled this recipe up to make 150 servings for a friend's wedding. It was wonderful. The flavour was great and it looked like confetti in the bowl. It was a perfect addition to the buffet. (We omitted the raisins - at the request of the bride - and it was fine without them.)

I came across this recipe recently and when I saw the name of it I immediately had to try it. After moving to CA from MA I really missed Vicki Lee Boyajian's cafe and all of the wonderful confections that they create there. The salad met every expectation -- it is delicious.

I read the other reviews of this salad and made it for a luncheon on a hot day. It was a tremendous success - everyone loved it; even my husband who tends to turn up his nose when I try to use ingredients like wild rice, had seconds. It's easy, delicious and can be prepared in advance. I used golden raisins which gave it a little bit of sweetness that was good.

Everyone raves about this recipe every time I prepare it. I find so many dishes on Epicurious Food that our guests enjoy so much. I am retreiving this today b/c I am preparing it, yet again, for a party this weekend and I am also sending it to a girlfriend who is also entertaining this weekend.

This recipe was recommended to me by the other cook from Atlanta. I made it for a luncheon and six different people asked for the recipe. It makes a huge amount and it's so easy.

Great salad. Made it as far as 2 days in advance and it was great. Travels well. If you let it sit for a day or two you might want to cut back on the garlic, since it seems to intensify with time.
