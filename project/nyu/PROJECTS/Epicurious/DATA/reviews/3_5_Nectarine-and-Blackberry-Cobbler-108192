I was not impressed at all. The fruit was way too juicy and the dough was very bland. I have made a perfect bluberry and peach cobbler before but can't find the recipie. This one didn't compare at all. Does anyone have another recipie for peach cobbler with blueberries?

Great summer time dessert. My guests all loved it. Next time I'll try it with a different fruit combo.

My family loved it. I used peaches rather than nectarines and added a bit more cornstarch, as the peaches were quite juicy. Served it with vanilla bean ice cream. YUM!

Agree with others; triple berry mixture and at least double the crust for same size pan. Have made six times this summer with fresh picked blackberries and peaches or nectarines.

I made this for a friend's birthday party--everyone ignored the cake and ate this! I added minced crystallized ginger to the dry biscuit mixture as well as a dash of cloves and cinnamon. It really added some extra flavor. A major crowd pleaser overall!

I substituted golden syrup for sugar when heating the fruit, with excellent results. The topping is very fluffy, almost like biscuit dough; I was expecting something a bit more cake-y, but it worked out really well. Very yummy.

Quite tasty, used honey instead of sugar. Am not sure what to make of 'fl's' comment, perhaps he/she fell asleep, the head hit the keyboard and rolled around a bit?

I made a couple of adjustments....added 2 tbsp of sugar along with a sprinkle of cinnamon and nutmeg to the dough mixture. Also added heavy cream instead of whole milk. Used frozen peaches and blackberries. Serve with vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream. Wonderful! My family always asks me to make it during the holidays! This is by far the best peach cobbler I've ever had.

I thought this was a nice summer cobbler--a nice pairing of the fruit. I probably prefer a sweeter topping (see the excellent peach cobbler recipe on this site), but this topping was just right for the vanilla ice cream I served with it. I'm not sure why the recipe calls for buttering the pan--I skipped that step.

We really enjoyed this recipe. Nice use of summar fruit. Although others complained the dough was too bland, we found it to be just right. There's plenty of sweetness from the fruit blend that was balanced perfectly by the dough sprinkled with sugar.

I agree with the first two reviews; this is only a two forker. I wish I had sprinkled cinnamon sugar on my dough too-- it would've been a lot less bland.

I wasnt very impressed with this cobbler, though tasty iwould rather have a different type cobbler. It is a good taste treat with some orange sherbert.

A bit too juicy, but good anyway. Since the recipe didn't specify, I didn't bother to peel the nectarines and it was fine. I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the dough before baking.
