Made this recipe the first time for a dinner party and it turned out very well. Everyone said that it was delicious. I did not spray the loaf pan with the non-stick spray-- I didn't want the dessert to be greasy. I used a couple of layers of plastic wrap to line a non-stick loaf pan and that worked fine. There was plenty of praline left over and I just used some of that on the top of the dessert so I wouldn't have to spend the time cutting the peaches to put on the top right before serving. I also had some left-over peach puree which I drizzled over the slices. This is a great recipe to highlight fresh summer peaches.

The name sounds so inviting, but the actual consuming of this dessert is quite boring. There was nothing here that made my heart sing.
