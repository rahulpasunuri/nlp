Wow! I just made this Jam!!!!! It is fabulous! I through in an extra 1/2 lb of rhubard because I had it, added an extra tablespoon of crystallized ginger because I love it and cut the sugar to one heaping cup as some suggested. It's sweet, tangy and zippy all in one! I will make this again and again.

I made this over the weekend with about 2 lbs. of fresh rhubarb. I used about 1-1/2 times the amount of chopped crystallized ginger and cut the sugar back to about 3/4 cup. I also added a sploosh of ginger ale for liquid as recommended by another reviewer. I let it simmer for about an hour total and then chilled it before using it alongside some roasted pork. Absolutely wonderful! Glad it'll freeze well; I plan to make some more and give little gifts to family members.

This is REALLY good. I made it with fresh rhubarb but otherwise made no changes. I just had some for lunch mixed with vanilla yogurt and it was delicious!

I made this with fresh rhubarb (1 1/3 lb, chopped into slices about 3/4 inch long) and fresh ginger (peeled, chopped finely, 4 tablespoons). I reduced the proportion of sugar (used 1 heaping cup) and used a heaping teaspoon of lemon peel. I had to cook it a lot longer than 20 minutes to get the right consistency, probably more like an hour. It is absolutely delicious and flying out of the pot onto the toast!

This has become my go-to recipe for almost all of the rhubarb that comes from our garden, winning out even over my mother's rhubarb bread recipe. I used the orange zest recommended by another reviewer, and the result is invariably delicious.

As guests at the Reading House every year, we always reach for the rhubarb ginger jam. It's a favorite feature of the excellent breakfasts offered by Rita and Bill Newell, the B&B hosts. How wonderful of them to share this recipe with the world!

The combination of rhubarb and ginger is both traditional and great. I used orange zest vs. lemon, also traditional. I don't think the switch was the only factor behind the fact that the preserves seemed far too sweet to me. I added all the recommended sugar since I thought it was necessary, but I think I'd cut it down to half so that the tartness of rhubarb comes through. Keep in mind the amount of sugar on the crystallized ginger. Notice at least one other review offers the warning.

I will make this again for sure! Delicious. I also used fresh rhubarb, instead of frozen, and a couple exta pieces of crystal ginger. Yum!

I made this with a number of revisions so take my review with a grain of salt.... Fresh rhubarb, perhaps four cups, only 1/2 cup of sugar, plus half a cup of ginger ale (to make up for any liquids that might accompany frozen rhubarb), a mixture of fresh and candied ginger, plus a dash of cinnamon. Yummy and not too sweet, but sweet enough. I lay awake all night thinking about it on a slice of toast in the morning........

Absolutely delicious, and very easy to make. Not too tart, not too sweet, just the right amount of ginger. I made a double batch, it thickened in almost exactly 20 minutes. I will be making this again!

This is my favourite jam and I make it regularly using fresh rhubarb. The rhubarb-ginger combination is delicious and it is so easy to make.

A quick and easy way to use rhubarb as it comes in. I used fresh rhubarb and weighed it. Very flavorful, and would probably be a good sauce for vanilla ice cream. Even people who think they can't make jam (because of all that sterilizing etc.) should try this.

This is an easy and deliciuos recipe. I use fresh rhubarb, make a double or triple batch of the recipe, and keep the jam in jars that I store in the freezer. I don't worry about having an exact equivalent to a package of frozen rhubarb. When it's cooking, it's easy to tell when it gets to the right consistency. Since discovering this recipe a few years ago, I've made it every summer.
