Delicious cake with a great orange flavor. I did not think the cake needed icing - a little whipped cream or chocolate glaze was all that was needed, as suggested below. I had never made an angel food or chiffon cake before, but this one was easy and turned out perfectly. Next time I will use waxed paper on the bottom of the pan as suggested below.

This cake turned out perfectly. I didn't have cake flour on hand so instead I made my own by using 2 T of cornstarch and filling up the rest of the cup with all-purpose flour. I also did not have an angel food cake pan on hand so I just used regular cake pans. There was enough batter to fill 3. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Lovely cake, and quite easy. I had a gift jar of Scottish lemon curd, so I removed about 1/3 of the whipped cream for the topping and folded a half jar of the curd into it. I cut the cake in three, rather than half, as suggested, and spread the layers with the curd, then topped it with the remaining whipped cream. A huge hit at a birthday party!

This is a lovely chiffon cake, and I've made lots of different kinds. If you wish, for any reason, to forgo the whipped cream icing, chiffon cakes are great with just a chocolate glaze poured over the top and drizzled down the sides. I've tried this cake both ways, and both are good. To the cook from Trinidad, don't grease the pan when making a chiffon cake or it won't rise properly. It likes to cling to the side of the pan to really attain a good height. And it pulls away quite easily when done. Also, I always turn them upside down to cool; as the previous reviewer mentioned, if you don't you just don't get the height (and lightness). I use an angel food pan, and just rest one of the prongs on an upside down 1-cup dessert dish, or a 1-cup measuring cup - works great.

Lined my pan with parchment for easy removal - very light cake, went well with fresh strawberries and a lightly sweetened whipped cream.

Very nice cake. Served it at our Easter Luncheon and wanted a 'light' desert. This cake rose past the height of the pan and 'feet' of the tube pan. I'll make this one again!

Well this is the 10th time making this cake by demand for my family. It is absolutely the best chiffon cake recipe. Easy to make, always turns out perfect and very pretty. I'm sure I'll be making it again for Easter 2010!

This cake is delicious, one of the best I've ever made. I didn't realize that I didn't have the proper pan until I finished making the batter so I ended up making 2 smaller cakes and 3 muffins. They all turned out wonderfully and tasted delicious. I decorated with the cream and edible flowers. One change I will make next time is to include real orange chunks in the batter. A few snuck in this time since I wasn't too careful about squeezing the oranges for the orange juice but they add great texture and flavor to the cake.

I made this cake for an Easter lunch. The texture was soft and fluffy. The frosting was delicious. The orange flavor was light and refreshing and not overpowering.

this was somewhat disasterous...followed suggestion to cool cake with a cup underneath and the whole thing capsized and broke in 2. Well that was alright because 2 halves are much better than no cake BUT the cake was so icky sweet. I used lots of zest as suggested but still it tasted like a sweet orangey angel food cake - but with all the fat! I dont know...I just couldnt figure out the beauty of this one.

This is the perfect chiffon cake - light, tall, and citrusy. Although delicate in texture, it travels well - so it's great to bring to a gathering. A plus is the easier than usual technique for this "two bowl" recipe. The yolk/oil mixture can simply be whisked togther with the dry ingredients without the benefit of an electric mixer. The directions are clear and simple to execute. Of all the chiffon cakes I have ever made, this is the absolute best! I use the grated zest (colored part only) of two large oranges and 2 large lemons. For the orange juice, I use Minute Maid concentrate made with less water for a more pronounced orange flavor - and use a teaspoon each of pure lemon and orange extracts. I adorned the cake with a light lemon-orange glaze and trio of kumquats. As I also made a three berry fruit tart for Easter, I made a Creme Anglaise with Grand Mariner to accompany both desserts. Both were a hit!

An excellent chiffon cake. My one and only experience in greasing the pan for a chiffon cake was a disaster. Never, never grease or flour when making a chiffon cake. I usually make it in a 10 inch tube pan. To easily remove it from the pan cut waxed paper to the shape of the bottom and place it in the pan. When the cake has cooled run an ordinary kitchen knife around the side and the tube. Invert the cake onto a plate and give it a gentle tap. The cake will come out easily. Remove the waxed paper and turn the cake right side up onto another plate.

Made this cake for a Father's Day outdoor dinner. It was spectacular. The lightness and fruit taste was perfect for a nice summer evening. 55 minutes is dead-on.

Made this cake for Easter and my family loved it. The whipped cream frosting was delicious with the juice of half an orange and a capful of orange extract in place of the liqueur (one of my relatives can't have alcohol). I scattered candied orange peel over the top. Yum!

I also baked the cake for 55 minutes and it was perfect. Moist and very fluffy. I like the cream frosting but I think next time I will sprinkle it with powdered sugar and some dark chocolate shavings. It really does not need frosting. I made the cake for a party and it was a big hit. It wasn't easy but it was worth every delicious bite! I will definately make this cake again.

This cake was "ok". I think the frosting definitely needed at least another 1/4 cup of sugar as it was very bland, hardly sweet enough. I didn't think this cake was worth the trouble. I got responses of "it's alright" from my family.

Wonderful cake!!! I baked it for 55 minutes and it was perfect! Moist and tender! Great recipe!

This cake was unbelievably delicious, light yet satisfying. I didn't have orange-flower water, and will continue to seek it as I think it would enhance it. I also used a lot more zest than called for, and didn't regret it. I notice that this recipe is almost the same as Orange Glow Chiffon Cake, by the Cake Bible, also available on this website. I like some of the tips in the other recipe (such as cooling inverted on a bottle instead of a rack; my cake shape was squished using the rack), and recommend checking it before making the cake.

Omigod! This has got to be the BEST cake ever made!!! The icing was perfect and my husband and I are not icing lovers! This was perfect - light and airy and not sweet ! Will I make it again??? YOU BETCHA!

This was a delicious, light, flavorful and easy to make cake that awed my guests. It was so tall that I split it into three layers and doubled the recipe for the whipped cream icing. My first attempt resulted in too little orange flavor. I had not properly grated the orange zest, which resulted in bigger pieces. Grated it with a fine grater the second time and the flavor was perfect. If you have trouble finding the orange flavored water, I purchased a small bottle at Bristol Farms.

The cake was very good and very, every easy to make..I think the pan should be greased though..i'm making it again next week when my husband comes to visit..Just i tip try it with the cream cheese frosting...yum-yum...

Excellent cake: moist and delicious. As I was preparing it for only two people, it was an especially pleasant surprise to find that the leftovers held up extremely well in the refrigerator for the next couple of days. If, like me, you love whipped cream toppings, you may wish to increase the frosting by 25-50%.

This was ok, nothing special. I found it quite dry and should at least doubled the whip cream icing. For the orange-flower water, just go to your local middle-eastern store or in Canada, Super Store $1.99 for a big bottle. Now what am I going to do with this orange flower water?

Just wanted to add my rave review to the others. I brought this to my aunt's easter dinner, everyone loved it. I'm not a big fan of angel food cake and wasn't sure if this would be just as airy. It was simply perfect, like a light cake. It has a wonderful orange flavor. I can't wait to make it again.

My family loves chiffon cakes, so, I make one at least every a week. I've always used a lemon chiffon cake recipe that everyone enjoyed....that is, until they tasted this one! It has all others beat hands down. It's exceptionally moist and light with a wonderful orange flavor. Now the recipe is being passed from family member to family member with strict instuctions "you've got to try this one and you'll never go back"! I made the whipped cream and put it in a bowl to be served on the side. This way you can have the cake as a light dessert, without the cream, or go full out and add the whipped cream, using a pastry bag.

This recipe is just delicious! I brought it to an Easter dinner and and it was a hit! Someone else brought a dessert too, but it wasn't touched in favor of mine. I made the cake the night before and frosted before bringing it to the party. It held up beautifully!
