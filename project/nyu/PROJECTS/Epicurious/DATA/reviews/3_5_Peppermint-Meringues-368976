These were great, and ready sooner than the "sleeping" version that wants to go overnight in the oven. I skipped the food coloring, and instead sprinkled candy cane bits over them (I folded some in before piping, too). Pretty, delicious, refreshing! Don't overdo the peppermint extract. A little goes a long way!

Good-- the first batch turned out really goopy-- turns out my peppermint extract was oil based. Round 2 was much better. Crispy & light and nice addition to a cookie plate.

I have made these meringues for a cookie social and sale after a church Chirstmas concert for the last two years. Easy to make and taste light and good. I mix the food coloring in instead of trying to get swirls and I make a batch in red and one in green. Great recipe.

I think I may have figured out the mystery of why some people had gloppy gooey meringues and others didn't. I made a batch with peppermint flavor from Whole Foods and they were a gloppy mess. Still cooked them and they were OK, but weren't nice light meringues. Then I noticed the peppermint flavor was made with peppermint oil and safflower oil instead of an alcohol base. When I got some peppermint extract with an alcohol base, they were light and lovely and perfect.

These are very addictive! My nieces and nephews could not stop eating them over the Christmas holiday. Make sure they have plenty of time to dry out and cool, after coming out of the oven...they'll peel off the parchment paper easier. Worked great using ziploc bag and piping in a circular pattern as you work from bottom up.

When I made these yesterday everything went right ... color, texture, taste, but after cooling they got sticky ... I do live in FL is that why? It was sort of funny when people took one they got all of the ones it touched too!

Didn't really work out for me but I'm willing to try the recipe again! They look really festive.

These were easy and scrumptious! The whole family loved them. They easily dried out for me, but for those who live in a more humid climate, it will take a bit longer to cook. I use to live in Florida and meringues were not impossible, just required being spot on when whipping the egg whites and incorporating the sugar. Also, making the meringues smaller helps (and easier to eat in one bite).

I loved these and made them twice. They are so easy and turn out so adorable - they look really fancy. The first time I made them I just followed the directions in the recipe and wasn't crazy about the streaks of red from the food coloring. The second time I used the tip elsewhere in the magazine about tinting half the mixture light pink and the other half a darker pink - that gave them the look of the meringues on the cover - more subtle streaks and much more elegant-looking. My husband and I pretty much devoured them. I will make them again next year as gifts!

I thought these were great--easy to make and look much fancier! I used a ziploc bag that wouldn't produce the tidy rounds, so I piped the meringue into swirls, which added to the striping. Best of all: they're less than 10 calories apiece!

This was the first time I had ever made meringues. They were wonderful. Everyone loved them. The only thing I will add is that I would drag a spoon through after adding the food coloring maybe once or twice. My first dozen or so were half white and half red.

Meh. These weren't bad, but they weren't great, either. I've made meringue cookies dozens and dozens of times and have used a half dozen different recipes. These there the least appealing, hands down. The peppermint flavor is pleasant, but nothing to write home about. The swirl effect, which could have been pretty, was not; the white took on a burnt sugar color in baking. The piping was a messy process and did nothing to improve the appearance over dropping by the teaspoon. The texture was inoffensive enough. Next time I want meringues, I'll go back to the oven-off-overnight method and the recipe I've used with hazelnuts, not from this site.

These are wonderful little mouthfuls. I used green and red drops of food colouring on the top of the meringue before loading my piping bag. I used a star tip in my piping bag and made single rosettes. The meringues are reminiscent of striped candy canes. I had to make a second batch. The first got eaten within two days!

Made these as an extra treat on Christmas Day. So easy and they turned out really pretty. I would keep in mind that the the weather does affect candies like these and don't try to make them on a rainy/humid day.

My teenage daughter followed the recipe exactly as written, twice, and they turned out perfectly. They will definitely be a part of our family collection of favorite Holiday cookie recipes.

I was concerned based on other reviews...I didn't have kosher salt and I live on a tropical, humid climate. These came out gorgeous! The colour was beautiful, they had nice flavour and crunch and were a beautiful addition to my Christmas cookie platters. Next time I won't mix the colour is so much to hope for even more of a swirl effect.

I made these two times. Both times were good but I definitely learned some things the first time. What I learned: read every detail of the instructions, even if you are experienced with meringue, it is really important not to cheat with the eggs being room temperature. I tried to warm them in my hands the first time, but I think that made the consistency a little runny. I also found the pastry bag much easier to use the second time when I turned down the pastry bag before spooning in the meringue(as instructed in the Prep School section of the magazine). The food coloring effect worked great for me. I never got 60 cookies out of the recipe, but got at least 48. Both batches (even the practice trial) were very popular and people loved how unique they were! Important to store separately from other cookies as they absorbed moisture from other cookies that I stored together and softened.

Zero forks because I never got to taste them, and one of my very rare disappointments with BA. I live in the Caribbean, so as others said, maybe it's the humidity, but I tried two batches and they both turned to runny muck when I added the powdered sugar, having attained some peaks (but not a ton) prior to that. I bake a lot and have made meringue before, but have never had something like this happen. Big disappointment because they were supposed to be a feature of my cookie plates this year...

Like heathersil from chicago said humidity could be your problem even in Boston a rainy day is not a good day to make meringues either! Be sure your egg whites are at room temp and bowl is clean of any oils or residue. mine are in the oven we will see how they turn out so far so good! It is a mess getting them in the pastry bag may try the ziplock methold next time so I can just throw out!

Something went wrong. I used a carton of egg whites (from Trader Joe's) and followed the recipe exactly. My egg white/salt/sugar mixture never materialized into firm peaks. I tried this process twice, with the same disappointing results.

If I could give zero forks, I would. I've successfully made meringue before, but this recipe is horrible-- after nearly 20 minutes with the mixer at high speed I never got stiff peaks. I added cream of tartar after about 15 minutes and it stiffened up a bit, but because it had already been going so long I was afraid to beat it any longer. It was a total loss; we didn't even bake the cookies because the meringue was so wet and gummy. I accept the fact that I could have made a mistake somewhere along the line, but we'll never know if it was me or the recipe because I'm not trying this one again.

I am celiac and I love mint, so these were perfect for me. I did, however, leave out the food coloring (which I don't eat), and drizzled them with melted dark chocolate once they had cooled, and they were delicious!

I made these exactly as written in the recipe. I think the flavor, texture and appearance were excellent. I would prefer more peppermint flavor, though and will probably add 1/4 teaspoon peppermint extract next time. Also, I think I over-beat the egg whites. Next time I will beat for less time than specified in the recipe. Another thing I would do differently is instead of leaving the 12 drops of coloring on top, I'd slightly mix it into the meringue. The first several I piped had very little red streaks in them.

I followed the simple recipe exactly and these turned out perfectly. Peppermind Meringues are an instant family favorite. I might have to make a second batch before Christmas, because we can hardly keep our hands off of them!

What a great recipe! Made just like the recipe stated and they came out perfect. I loved the buttery mint flavor. To the reviewer previously w/ all the problems, I wonder if you live in an area w/ high humidity? That can make a big difference.

This is the worst recipe I have ever made. I do not bake that often, so maybe its me, but NOTHING went right with this recipe. They didn't harden even after 2 and a half hours of cooking, the cosistency was runny the first two times I tried to make the "dough". After the third time it fluffed up to meringue consistency, but even after that it was messy getting it into the bag, they looked pretty but after they cooled they were mushy, they taste good, and don't look to bad but when you touch them sticky and mushy. This is a big NO!

Super easy to make and impressive in the Holiday Gift Boxes. They don't take long to make, as one reviewer stated, they are rather simple in fact. But they do take a long time to bake.

Super easy to make, and definitely impress, although they do take a long time. I didn't have any peppermint extract, so I ground up some mints and added those instead with a dash of vanilla, still came out very good. I also put some sprinkles on top of a handful to make them even more festive - great!

These make beautiful desserts. They're great by themselves and a wonderful touch as a garnish for a holiday dessert. My only critique is that the mint flavor was a bit overpowering for my taste. The next time I make them I think I'll cut down the amount of extract to get a more subtle flavoring.

These cookies came out perfectly, beautifully pink striped with peaks just like the photo. But the taste was a bit papery or chalky, a rather unpalatable taste imparted by the powdered sugar. If not for the taste, a beautiful holiday cookie.

Question...I made these 3 times, the first were beautiful and shiny and delicious but the 2nd and 3rd times they were good but turned out a little lumpy not quite as shiny and pretty as the 1st. Any reason you can think of? Maybe I overbeat the mixture? I have no idea but am trying a 4th this evening. They really were easy and delicious and these are for gifts so I'm hoping they don't turn out lumpy as well.

Easy to make, beautiful and delicious! I'll make these agin this season - green and blue too.

I made these as a test to see how they came out before I got into really baking for Christmas and I didn't have kosher salt so I used regular instead, seeing if I could substitute that. They didn't poof like they are supposed to so I'm assuming you can't. But, they still taste great!

These were easy to make and tasty. Very pretty addition to a Christmas cookie platter.

These are so pretty in person! I made a batch today as a trial run for a cookie exchange I'm going to next week. These will totally make the cut. The only challenge I had was when I scooped the meringue into my pastry bag - I made an absolute mess trying to smoosh it all down into the bag - but that was my only problem. Great recipe!

Beautiful and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. Just minty enough and a nice small size. The color swirls were lovely.
