Yummy and easy. I served with Steamed Whole Fish with Ginger, Scallions and Soy (from this site). Loved it. I used regular cabbage instead of the broccoli because that's what I had on hand.

This is a must-try recipe! It has become a staple in our household. We make it at least once a week. I have never liked raw broccoli, but this recipe makes it craveable! I don't bother to measure the dressing ingredients, just guestimate, taste, and adjust accordingly. It's very forgiving. A few adjustments we make: Add a splash of sesame oil and a pinch of sugar to the dressing. To the slaw, we add toasted almond slivers and dried cranberries.

Probably my new favorite salad dressing recipe. I added some toasted almond slivers and sesame seeds. We couldn't stop eating this! Delicious!

Great! I didn't have Miso paste so I used Red Curry Paste (just 1 TBSP) and I left out the vegetable oil and put in 1 tsp of light mayo. I also mixed everything except slaw in mini cuisinart and poured over slaw. I stirred fried the left overs and had with Salmon! The fan loved it!

so interesting and easy!...Assembled salad before, prepared dressing and stored separately and tossed before serving. White Miso is now a new favorite in our pantry.

The dressing is simple but so delicious. I used yellow miso. We had two crowns of broccoli to use up, so I sliced and blanched them, plunged in cold water, drained and patted dry, and added shredded carrots. My vegetarian daughter sprinkled nuts on hers and ate it for her main course. No leftovers.

This is a great recipe. The first time we could only find brown liquid miso and it was okay. Then I found white miso paste at an asian market specialty store and it gave the taste a delicious pop. I added an extra 1/2 package of shredded carrots, more green onions, a little more vinegar and used half the oil. For convenience I use a small amount of fresh chopped ginger that comes in a tube. Nice change from our leafy salads.

Looks good!

Fantastic. I think it will be one of those craved-for foods. I cut the oil in half as another reviewer suggested. I assembled the dressing in my mini food processor, and was left with a very creamy dressing. I also sprinkled a Thai chili on top.

Very easy to make. I couldn't find broccoli slaw, so I used a bag of Asian slaw, and that worked well. I used brown Miso because that's what I had on hand. Next time I will reduce the oil a bit. Rice vinegar is so mild you can get away with using less oil. The cilantro was a really nice touch.

So Easy, So delish! This slaw makes a yummy side dish or a main meal if you mix in chicken. My entire family (that includes kids) loves this. I added Napa cabbage sliced up, extra julienned carrots (there are already some in the Broccoli Slaw mix, but I figured a few more couldn't hurt), extra green onion and extra cilantro, along with sesame seeds and red pepper flakes. I didn't change a thing about the dressing because it is perfect - tosses nicely and leaves the mix lightly coated. Definitly not sopping, but not too little. I have made this several times and it consistently is great. Perfect for taking to a pot luck, or Book Club with the ladies.

A tasty dish, ruined by the inedible woody bits in the storebought broccoli slaw. The miso dressing has a wonderful robust flavor. I would make this again with broccoli stems I have shredded myself. I added a little sugar after I mixed everything together, to make it a little sweeter, like a coleslaw. Next time I would add a teaspoon or two of honey to the dressing instead.

Don't think you get much of an emulsion goin with less oil --- so I would not decrease. I have made this with my Japanese dressing as well --- also with a Thai twist with either Tahini or Peanut Butter and some red chile flakes. I like grating extra carrot and also like a bit of Napa cabbage. I can eat this all day with roasted Pita and sweet red peppers. This recipe is a great beginning for experimentation. beginning

Cut the oil by at least half to get a bit of the glisten off and let the miso shine through.
