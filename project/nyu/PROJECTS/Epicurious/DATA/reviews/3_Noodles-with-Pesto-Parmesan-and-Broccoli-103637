I made a couple of changes to make it more appealing to our kids, which helped: definitely save more than a cup of pasta water, particularly if your eaters will add extra parm; roast a couple of chicken breasts in the oven, pull the chicken and add; skip the onion, add an extra clove or two of garlic--I think the onion fights with the pesto. I also skipped the red pepper, but I suppose it could be added on after for those who want more kick.

This was an awesome recipe. I admit I did make a few minor changes too it. Instead of using egg noodles, I used spaghetti and I only used a touch of red pepper. Had I used egg noodles and put in 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper I'm not sure my kids would have eaten ANY of it. Once they got over the 'eeeewww, there's broccoli in it!' it went down fairly well. LOVED IT! Tasted great and easy to make!

I can't understand all the bad reviews. Before even attempting it, I reduced the amount the onion and garlic and it was just fine. Meat or poultry could be added to make it a proper entree (I added Italian sausage). It's not a dish for entertaining, but for family it was great.

The mixed reviews concerned me but the ingredients were all on hand so I gave it a try. I liked it a lot as did my husband--and he is usually not so enthusiastic about vegetarian options. I prepared it as written except I scaled back by about half as there were only two of us. So some of my proportions may have been a little off--a whole onion, for example, and two cloves garlic--but I think this is a dish you can easily adjust to taste. I used Alessi brand pesto and a grocery- store block of parmesan, in other words, nothing out of the ordinary. I thought the flavors worked really well. We drank a beaujolais with it and had a bowl of berries for dessert. Pretty nice Monday night meal.

I love pesto, I love broccoli and I love egg noodles. But I agree with some of the other cooks, this wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. It was kind of dry, I think it needs a creamy pesto sauce instead of just the oily-pesto sauce. Maybe next time I will try this.

I have not made this recipie, I have however made others like it. The person who gave it 4 forks did so because they used asparagus. While brolloli and pesto may not mix well, asparagus is a perfect pairing in my kitchen.

This recipe is an insult to broccoli and a waste of precious pesto. The addition of more pesto ingredients is a bit mystifying. The broccoli is overpowered by the garlic, and wide egg noodles are not the best match for pesto. 'Tis a far, far better thing I do to save my broccoli for hollandaise, and my pesto for linguine. I fear I will never look at a Bon Appetit the same way again.

It's the reviews of dishes like this that make me wonder whether epicurious readers have read what the number of forks means. I can't see how anyone could rate this dish 4 forks -- or "A dish beyond compare". Come on! At any rate, this dish was OK, although I had to add more water to the "sauce" to make it saucy. I agree with the previous reviewer that broccoli and pesto combination is a bit odd. To each his own, I guess.

What did I do wrong? My boyfriend must have been polite when he said he enjoyed this. The mixture of broccoli and pesto created an odd and unappealing taste. I would rather spend the extra time and enjoy my meal. Sorry to the chef.

This was a simple and delicious way to use up my broccoli harvest that was all ready to pick at the same time. I only used half as many noodles with the same amount of sauce since a whole bag of pasta is just too much for us. It turned out really delicious.

Very easy and quick. I used less pasta only because it was for two, but didn't change the rest of it. We love spicy and tasty, and this dish sure was. Still have enough for tomorrow, and can't wait. Try it, you'll like it. Oh yes, I also used one more clove of garlic than it called for. YUMM!!!!! I used the leftovers tonitght. I first sauted mushrooms in garlic and olive oil (and a little bit more crushed red pepper but don't tell my husband) and then warmed up the left over pasta from last night. WOW!! We liked it better tonight..Economical, and easy and YUMMM!!! Okay....I couldn't figure it out. The above is two separate reviews (two nights in a row). Karol

Loved it. I added about a pound of cooked diced chicken to make it more of a meal. Excellent.

This is really a terrific recipe. When I first saw it in the magazine, I didn't try it, but then I was looking for recipes to use up some pesto and decided to try it. I wondered how the pesto would go with the broccoli, but it went terrificly. The flavors in this dish really do work together beautifully.

you must try this dish! the whole family loved it (all the way down to the 18-month old). i did add a pound of italian sausage. still, it fed 8 of us. 8 cups of broccoli - you can't beat that. and the flavor vies with any dish that might take hours to prepare. this will be one of those few recipes that i actually make more than once.
