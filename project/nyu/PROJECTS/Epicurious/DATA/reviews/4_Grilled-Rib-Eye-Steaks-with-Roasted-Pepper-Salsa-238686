The preparation for the steak was so simple but so good. I bought prime rib-eyes at Costco and I'm sure that made the difference. As for the salsa, after all the raves we thought it was just okay. The steak was so good and really didn't need the salsa anyway. I don't quite understand the raves since it was nothing more than a little spiced-up red peppers in oil and lemon juice. Not that they were bad just not with rib-eyes.

This was truly amazing! I can't believe that only 5 people have reviewed it. Made a saffron rice as a side... was perfect!

This is one of the best salsas I have ever had. The habanero warms the back of your throat long after supper is finished - in a good way. One comment....their suggestions for grilling the peppers are cumbersome. Lay a piece of foil on a cookie sheet, cut the peppers in half and lay them skin side up. Broil until blackened. Then close the foil to make a packet for them to steam in. When cool, peel etc....toss the foil and no cleaning on the cookie sheet.....

I must admit that I sighed when I read the instructions for this because roasting and skinning peppers always seems like such a pain -- boy, is it worth it. This recipe was amazing and the salsa was a perfect accompaniment. (In fact, because I was cooking for only two, we had left over salsa for another meal and this goes just as well with BBQ'd chicken!)

Amazing - the roasted red peppe salsa was a hit - I used 2 habanero peppers and it was a little too hot. Would only use one next time - what a great compliment to the grilled beef. Presentation was beautiful as well - fabulous for entertaining and so easy!

The salsa really complements the meat. Personally I think this recipe makes way too much for 4 steaks; I will probably halve the recipe next time.
