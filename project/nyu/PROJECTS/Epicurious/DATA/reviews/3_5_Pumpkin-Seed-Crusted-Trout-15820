I skipped the sauce as other reviewers suggest it overpowers the trout. I found the fish a little on the boring side -- nice crunch, healthy seeds but lacking oomph.

No leftovers here! I purchased three trout, had six fillets. The sauce could wasn't a necessity, everyone loved the fish as it was. A nice change from the pecan butter we generally use for trout.

I make this dish all the time. It's nice to have a fish recipe that's not breaded, but still has the crunch. I've never made the sauce.

My partner exclaimed, "Wow!" upon tasting the first bite! It was just perfect. Someone said it didn't need the sauce but I thought the sauce really made the dish. The lime and cilantro complemented the toasty pumpkin seeds just perfectly, and the fish (very fresh) glowed from within. I served it with steamed asparagus and drizzled the sauce over both that and the fish. Yum!

I followed this recipe to a tee and it turned out fantastic. What a wonderful twist on trout!

I don't bother with the sauce, but the fish is delicious. We've been eating this once a week!

The pumpkin seed crust is delicious, especially when panned in pumpkin seed oil, which presents a beautifully deep hued contrast when plated. The sauce however, seems misplaced in this dish. Although a delicious reserve, lime and cilantro overpower the distinct yet delicate trout. It would certainly be a better compliment to bass or swordfish. I'll try it next on calamari steak. I served this dish, sans sauce, on a bed of spinach fettucine with a pear tomato and baby spinach medley (--not wilted). Add designs of well aged balsamic with dots of additional pumpkin seed oil around the plate and a sprig or two of cilantro for aroma (also good in the fettucine medley) and it is definately one to enjoy. -V-
