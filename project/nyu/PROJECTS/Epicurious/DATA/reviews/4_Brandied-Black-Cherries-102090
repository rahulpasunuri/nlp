I haven't yet made this, but it looks good and I wanted to comment upon some of the reservations expressed about how safe this is. I've canned a lot of jams, fruit and preserves, and this isn't to different. The sugar acts as a preservative, just as with jam or peaches put up in syrup. Get your jars really hot, pour the syrup over and the jar lids will seal.

Good, yes. Very European, as the 1st couple of reviewers stated. Now with regards to proper preservation, I think some reviewers are very inexperienced. Acidic foods preserved with alcohol usually last 4- 5 months without any bacterial growth if stored in a cool dark place.

I have just prepared this recipe and am wondering if it needs to be vacuum sealed. Hate to wait four months and find I made a mistake.

I have some reservations about this recipe as written. I started it not knowing a thing about canning. Mid way thru I consulted with a knowlegeable friend who believed it was safer using standard techniques for food preservation which involved quite a bit more than the recipe indicated. What are the thoughts of others regarding technique?????

It is Cherry Picking season again. We have a large Stella tree and I canned some last year - July/02. I just opened a jar from last year and made Cherries Jubilee. It is better than any I have tasted and we have tried this recipe for many years. Out I go to get some from the tree to make many batches this year.

When I visited Alsace last year, I fell in love with several desserts that included cherries in Kirsch. Then when I found sour cherries at the farmer's market, I had to try to replicate them. The recipe doesn't say to, but I pitted the cherries first, and made them with Kirsch instead of regular brandy. A jar of these make a wonderful hostess gift or small Christmas present. The Black Forest cake I made for New Year's eve was wonderful, and may become a new tradition. Or serve over ice cream, either vanilla or chocolate. Yum!

Branied cherries are extremely popular in Germany, where I come from. They will "brandy" just about any fruit, but cherries are a favorite. This is a great recipe. I use them in Schwarzwaelderkirschtorte (Black Forest Cherry Cake). It's the classic south German/Swiss method for preparing the cake. These will last FOREVER to. Just put them in the pantry and forget about them until needed. The brandy preserves them and the older they get, the better they get
