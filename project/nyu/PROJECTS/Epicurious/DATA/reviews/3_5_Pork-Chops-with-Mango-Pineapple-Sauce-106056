Great recipe. I will say that to give more flavor to the pork chops I simmered them in the sauce for another 15-20 mins. Also to ensure they were done. They mango sauce just permeated the meat after that. Delicious.

This was great! I used agave instead of brown sugar, and used just a little bit. I also used fresh pineapple. I didn't have mango nectar so I used a little white wine and didn't worry about adding any more liquid.

I used 1 cup of cream of coconut instead of mango (not available in town) and the sauce came out delicious! Though I will not add any brown sugar since the coconut is already sweetened. I also used 2 cups of real pineapple. I served the porks chops with lemon-cilantro couscous and it's bitterness was a perfect pair for the pineapple sauce. Enjoy it, I will keep this recipe on my favorites.

The color of this dish was egregious. I would be embarrassed to put this in front of company. The sauce did not compliment the pork, it sunk it like a depth charge. Never again.

I used chicken instead of pork chops. The dish took a little bit of time, but nothing difficult. My husband loved it too.

My husband and I love this recipe. I cut down on prep time by subsituting a jar of mango pineapple salsa. I like the extra kick the salsa brings to the recipe. I also marinated the chops in a curry sauce which added an extra depth of flavor and went well with the fruityness of the mango/pineapple sauce.

This recipe is a keeper. Served with juicy pork cops and coconut rice, it's a delicious summer meal.I used a potato masher instead of a food processor to puree and it worked fine. I would advise using fresh, not canned fruit, if you want a less sweet flavor. I didn't have any light brown sugar, so I substituted regular sugar and added a touch of molasses. The sauce works well with firm fish and chicken, too.

Tried this because of some similarity to a favorite recipe. More annoying than the utterly gooey, smothering, blandness of it was the dirtying of 6 implements/pots to make it compared to my make-the-sauce-in-the-one-chop-pan recipe which is lively and piquant with red onion, jalapeno, chicken stock and apricot/pineapple jam, among other things. My recipe's finished in 15 minutes; this thing is a waste of time to say nothing of a good cut of meat.

This receipe has been one of my favorites for months. I do it just as stated with adjustments only for size and sauce.

The recipe was good. It is very sweet. You could try using less sugar.

The pork chops were great! For the sauce- I added some cilantro, papaya and an extra pepper. Overall, and sauce was a perfect compliment to the pork.

My boyfriend really liked the sauce. He wants me to make it served over small chunks of cooked pork, and then rice. I added cayenne pepper like some of the reviewers suggested, it helped, next time I'll add even more.

This is absolutely stunning! My fiancee and I really enjoyed this dish. Yummy. I also added a bit of cayenne, as one suggested. It added a nice spice to it (a little goes a long way). I served it with herbed couscous (added a little butter, garlic olive oil, salt, and then stirred in some more cilantro & chives at the end). This will become a regular at our house.

Very easy to make, but would try it next time with fresh papaya instead of canned pineapple.

Excellent Recipe. There was more than enough sauce to make 8 pork chops instead of 4, which is perfect as the leftovers taste delicious. Needed some kick to offset the sweetness, so I added 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper with great results.

This recipe is great, my whole family loved it. It was also fun to make. The cilantro gave it a very distinctive touch.

Was a fairly simple recipe. The pork chops tasted even better the next day.

I made the sauce, added chicken and served it over rice. It was easy and really quite good. I will be making it again. I added the cilantro and found that it gave the dish the zing it needed.

The sauce is flavorful, tangy and not too sweet, and it's what makes this dish stand out. Although the recipe called for fresh mango and canned pineapple, I couldn't get a decent fresh mango, so I used canned, and it was fine. It might be fun to try with fresh of both fruits in season, though. The sauce would also work very well with roasted loin (or tenderloin) of pork or with chicken, and it would be just the thing to zip up reheated turkey leftovers. I served it with basmati rice and omitted the cilantro.
