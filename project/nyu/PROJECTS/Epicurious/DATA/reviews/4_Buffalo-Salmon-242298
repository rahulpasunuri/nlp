Really excellent made with Wild Sockeye salmon from Alaska! I followed the recipe except I used some of the sauce to wet the panko instead of using the vegetable oil. I also threw some chopped parsley over it just before serving to give it a punch of green. (I baked it in a white ceramic baking dish; with the bright orange salmon and the vibrant parsley, it looked delicious!)

This is one of the best recipes I have for salmon! I agree that you don't need 5 TB butter; I typically use 3 TB. Otherwise I make it according to the recipe. My husband doesn't want salmon any other way anymore.

This is our family's favourite go to salmon recipe, it's so easy to make and always tastes good. The leftovers are really good in salad as well. I put the panko or bread crumbs on the salmon then put the hot sauce over the salmon and bake it all together, it works really well.

This is the "Crack" of salmon! I'm from good NW Norwegian stock and have eaten salmon in every way imaginable... this is by far my favorite.

This was a "restaurant worthy" dish, if ever there was. We loved it. I used 2 center cut Atlantic Salmon fillets that were 8 oz. each, and they were also skinless. I made the full amount of panko topping for the two fillets, cuz we loves us some crunch! We also enjoy fish on the more medium rare side, so these baked at 425 for 10-11 minutes. Frank's is such a flavorful hot sauce, and with the butter added?....well, it really belies the fact that this was merely a 2 ingredient sauce. Cheers all, Jeff

This is not haute cusine, but it's nutritious, popular with the family, and easy. I reduced butter to 3 TB. Agree that the preparation is adaptable to other sauces. I'd like to try an Asian sauce... maybe plum sauce or eel sauce?

I made this for my husband and I and it is fabulous! I got a really good piece of salmon about 1 pound (I had them remove the skin). I soaked it in salt water as I always do, then rinsed and patted dry. I made the full recipe of sauce but I would use less butter next time. Amazingly the sauce is not real spicy. The nice crunch of the panko makes the preparation very special and so simple. I only baked it for 15 minutes and it was perfect.

I have made this over and over. The very best!!!!! I did like another person and once tried with tilapia. Worked very well. I sometimes also add dried or fresh dill and/or parsley! My very favorite salmon recipe. Everyone LOVES it!!

Rating: 4
This is an awesome basic treatment for fish - instead of salmon we actually used tilapia loins. I made it for two so did 1T butter and 2T hot sauce, sprinkled panko over it and cooked per the recipe, it was just incredible! Right amount of flavor and spice without losing the quality of the fish. This will be a repeat performer especially because these are all pantry staples.

One word for this recipe, FABULOUS! I picked up some Sockeye Salmon (best salmon PERIOD) for this recipe. I recommend others do the same, you will not regret it. I also added some blue cheese crumbles to the panko, served it over sautéed baby spinach and garlic, and some blue cheese dressing on the side. My husband really doesn't care for salmon and he LOVED this dish as did my 10 year old son. I too agree on reducing the butter to your own preference.

This salmon dish was so easy, fast, and tasted great! I did halve the butter, 5 Tbs is unnecessary. Other than that, didn't change a thing. Served with a bed of fresh baby spinach with gorgonzola crumbles, roasted red peppers, and onion. Delicious!

This recipe is awesome, even haters love it. I half the butter though, totally doesn't need that much at all. I usually serve it with a spinach salad with blue cheese, or if I'm feeling naughty, creamy blue cheese dressing.

I did not love it. In fact, I did not even finish my piece of salmon. My bf thought it was ok. I won't be making it again.

O.K. I did modify the recipe because it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. Instead of the hot sauce, I marinated the fish in teriyaki sauce. I added chopped macadamia nuts to the panko and used chili oil instead of vegetable oil. I did everything else as directed and got rave reviews. I think serving the fish with some eel sauce as found in sushi bars would just make this a winning entre. I plan on serving it on Christmas dinner.

Wow, that was really good!!! I used Tapatio for the hot sauce, and followed the recipe.

My husband put it perfectly "if this was easy to make, go ahead and make it again, if not, probably don't bother." We eat a lot of fish, so I'm always looking for something easy and different, and it hit those points. But I wasn't in love with the buffalo sauce/salmon combo. I served with sauted spinach and then raw celery sticks with blue cheese dressing. All in all, ok but not great.

I love this recipe! It is super easy to make and wins raves everytime I make it, However, I couldn't help myself and I made a blue cheese sauce to go with it. I sauteed2 tablespoons chopped shallots then added 1 cup of gorgonzola crumbles and 3/4 cup cream heat in saucepan Yummy!

This is one of our go-to fish recipes when we want something a little different, but don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. It is so easy to make, and really quite flavorful. When I tell people what the sauce is (after they've eaten it), they're amazed that it's not "hot" like buffalo wings.

Rating: 1
I was hoping to love this. Texturally, salmon went quite nice with the panko, but thought the flavors were not complimentary. The Buffalo sauce was overwhelmed by the salmon flavor and was lost. Perhaps would be better with a different Buffalo sauce and/or a less flavorful fish like Cod.

Excellent recipe. The panko crumbs give it a nice crispy finish. I added a little more salt then the recipe called for. Would also be nice served over a mixed greens salad.

Made this for a dinner party and it got rave reviews. Used siracha and the sauce was HOT and really good. I served this with roasted asparagus topped with blue cheese to round out the 'buffalo sauce' theme. I do think you need more than 2 lbs of salmon for 6 people especially if there are several guys (or serve a lot of rice or bread!). It just didn't seem like enough.

The best thing about this recipe: You don't have to skin the salmon and it's still delicious. Honestly a 30-minute meal. It's a staple in our house.

this is delicious. this is a stand-by in our house. salmon comes out flavorful and moist and the panko lends the perfect crunch. we love it.

Yawn...boring. This combo did not work for us. There are plenty of other salmon recipes out there that are way better and just as simple. Glazed grilled salmon is still the best.

My family loved this! It's perfect the way the recipe is. As others have said, could be done with chicken as well.

Delicious and easy. The Panko breadcrumbs added such a nice crunch. I served this for book club last night and it was a pleasure b/c the salmon took about 5 minutes to prepare, from opening the fish to putting it in the oven, so I could enjoy my guests. It was not too spicy, and the guests could add more sauce if they wanted to. I LOVE this dish.

this was a big hit with my friends. i used sriracha and sauteed some fresh garlic in the butter as recommended and it came out great. good go-to salmon recipe!

Rating: 4
This was delicious! I did modify the recipe a bit based on some of the reviews. I blended equal parts Tobasco and Sriracha and set aside the reserved 1/4 cup. Out of the remaining amount, I brushed the salmon with a generous amount, the blended the rest with with Panko and vegetable oil, then pressed the moistened crumbs to the topside of the fish. If you have the option to bake using a convection setting, this will give the Panko a really nice, light crispiness.

I am usually pretty stingy as far as ratings go, but this dish deserves four forks- REALLY! I made the recipe as written (except I cut the butter in half) and it was a revelation. The hot tang of the sauce and the richness of the salmon were made for each other. This recipe goes in the keeper file.

I feel like I'm missing something here. We loe buffalo chicken and this buffalo sauce was very good. That said, I don't think it did much for the salmon. While we ate it and didn't hate it, I won't feel really called to make this again.

Rating: 3
Good stuff. I wouldn't have thought panko and salmon would work well, but it does. I used Sriracha as well, and tossed the salmon with the oil, panko and sauce in a bag before baking. The only reason I don't give 4 forks is that it feels like there must be some way to add another dimension to this, maybe with a more complex sauce?

Rating: 3
This turned out quite nicely. I'd have never thought to use panko with salmon. I used Sriracha as well, which has more of a garlicy Buffalo flavor that Franks I think. I tossed the sauce with the panko and oil in a bag, then put the salmon in the bag and mashed the coating to the fish.

I really like this recipe. I don't know if I really think that it tastes like buffalo chicken wings, but it is really good. I just used regular bread crumbs because I had them on hand. I also threw some garlic into the buffalo sauce. Everyone loved it.

My 6 and 7 year old sons loved it, had 3 servings each, but my husband said it was just "OK", and everyone would have liked it a little spicier. So, would use more hot sauce next time.

excellent! I omitted the oil and just pressed the panko on to the salmon. Otherwise, it was made exactly as written. Husband loved the heat but it wasn't so much heat that I couldn't enjoy it. My two year old enjoyed it as well!

3 forks = delicious. This was so SUPER simple for a weeknight dinner, and it was very, very good. No need to track down "Frank's Hot Sauce" - we used Sriracha (ubiquitous Asian spicy stuff used in Pho and other dishes). I served with white rice tossed with sesame oil and toasted pine nuts.

Had to tweak the recipe as I was cooking for one, still need to tweak some more but was good for a first effort. Would like it spicier than it was so will be increasing the amount of Frank's. Also plan to let the salmon soak in the sauce for 10 minutes or so before cooking. Skipped the oil in the panko and instead just sprinkled the panko on top. Did make for a beautiful display and crunchy texture

This has become my family's favorite way to eat salmon (and we eat it a lot)! Try using home made bread crumbs made from a hearty wheat bread for variety.

I made this last night with roasted asparagus and it was really great. Not too hot, but a good "bite" to it from the hot sauce. Next time I'll saute some garlic in the butter and then add hot sauce. Did not bother reserving sauce to serve on the side, just coated fish really well. Panko crumbs were delicate and crunchy. Also great is the ability to prepare ahead and pop in the oven for 20 minutes when you're ready. Will make again!

Excellent Recipe! I loved it! The only thing is that next time I will try and see if I can find a hot sauce that is milder. I used Melinda's brand and it was delicious but really HOT!

Salmon and buffalo sauce sounds like a strange combination, but this was good! The crispy panko and the spiciness it covered were a great contrast to the fish underneath. I doubled the sauce so that I could serve more with the meal, and added more of the panko mixture, because I didn't think the coating was thick enough. I also cut back a little on the butter in the sauce. My family doesn't like fish. I made this hoping that my Buffalo-wings-loving teeneager might eat this. He, his girlfriend and my husband liked it. A keeper! I think this would also be good with chicken.
