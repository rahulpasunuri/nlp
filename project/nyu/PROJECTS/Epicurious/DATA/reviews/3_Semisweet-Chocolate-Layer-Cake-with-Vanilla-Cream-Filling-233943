This cake isn't terrible, but since there are o many others options I won't make this again.

Hmm, very mixed reviews so far on this cake, it seems. I just made it this weekend for a friend's bday, and it turned out really well! They all said it was delicious. I did notice the cake layers were kind of flat, but I didn't have the high sides and caved middle problem. I have a couple suggestions to maybe help with the issues people seem to be having. For the cake: I had to spread the batter out when I put it into the pans (9" round), and when I did this, I made sure the middle was thicker than the sides, so in the end, they turned out pretty even. I let them cool in the pan for about 15min, then inverted out by placing a plate upside down directly on top of the cake and then flipping the pan + plate. I then sandwiched the cake between the plate and a rack and then flipped again to end up with the cake on the rack - no cracking =) For the cream: I originally started out using a hand mixer, but switched to using just a whisk and beating it by hand, which I prefer anyway. It firmed up much faster once I switched to whisking. I also let the gelatin-cream mix cool all the way down to room temp in the fridge, which took about 15min, not 5 like they say in the recipe. I then streamed it slowly into the already whipped cream, whisking constantly until I got stiff peaks. When assembling, I made sure to leave about a 1/2 inch border when I spread the cream on the cake, to give it room to squish without coming out the sides when I added the layer on top. I assembled and chilled the cake in a 9" springform pan, then removed the siding when I was ready to pour on the ganache. I agree that I would make more cream next time, but other than that, this recipe turned out great for me =)

Worst recipe ever. The cake doesn't have a strong chocolate flavor and doesn't have the color or rise nearly to the level in the picture. The cream filling totally failed with the gelatin-wouldn't hold it's shape, and the ganache was an-overly sweet but not over-choclatey mess.

I made this cake for my mother's birthday recently. It was simply the very best cake I have ever eaten in my entire life. The cake was rich, but not too rich. t could almost be described like a brownie! Amazing! The cake would be too rich if you don't follow the recipe for the cream filling. Its simplicity is fantastic. The cake doesn't have to be chilled for as long as the recipe recommends. Also, I used agave syrup in the ganache, and that worked really nicely. When putting ganache on the cake, I put on a thin layer, refrigerated, cleaned the kitchen for 5 minutes or so, applied another layer, and repeated a few more times. The cake was smooth and covered in the right amount of ganache. Also, I used partially semisweet and partially 72% cocoa chocolates, and used a little too much. It worked brilliantly! I'd recommended doing that. For the top, i cut some various sizes of hearts out of plain paper, and put little tabs of tape on top so i could lift them. Then i sifted cocoa powder over the top, which was light, but not a stark contrast. Very pretty! For the layers, I used 3 8-inch pans, which weren't exactly the same size, but very close. I had to cut a small amount of cake off the edges of one of the layers, but it worked fine.

I have one question to the person who published the recipe, especially for the cake part: Was this tested? I have a suspicion it was not the same recipe that was tested, or there has been a mistake in the amount of certain ingredient. The cake was extremely dry - each layer cracked easily when assembled. I will not make it again. On the other hand, the ganache turned out as well as the vanilla cream filling. So, again, who tested the cake recipe?

Wow, a lot of work but fabulous! Because whipped cream needs everything cold or it will be a runny mess, I made the cake Saturday night to be sure it was completely cool. Put the beaters and stainless steel bowl in the fridge before whipping the cream, then when the cream/gelatin mixture had no warmth at all to the touch (I put my finger in it), I streamed it into the already whipped cream while whipping more and it worked fine. The genache was great and there was enough left for me to put it in a glass jar and save it for next weekend when I'll make another of these! This is a holy cow good cake.

Haven't made the filling or ganache yet, but wanted to comment on the cake sag issue-- as I only have 2 pans of the correct size, I had to let 1/3 of the batter sit while I baked the first 2 layers. Then after the 10-minute rest, I popped out the layers, cleaned one of the pans, and baked the final 1/3 batter. While the first 2 layers had a slight sag in the middle, the final one, the batter for which had rested at room temp for about 30 minutes, rose completely evenly and came out looking beautiful. Wonder if this batter, much like pancake batter, benefits from resting before cooking? (It reminded me of pancake batter-- when I went to spread it in the pan, it had thickened even more after resting and was pretty spongey- I was skeptical about how it would cook and was surprised to find it did the best.)

Update on the cream and ganache--I am disturbed a ganache recipe incorporates corn syrup as it seems unnecessary. Frosting and then glazing surely makes for a beautiful cake, and the syrup adds a sheen and a stiffness to the ganache it wouldn't normally have, but I don't think I will make any more ganache recipes with the syrup. The cream was a big 'so what' for me--I would have preferred to fill my cake with a nice vanilla pudding or crème pâtisserie rather than the cream filling. It took quite a long time to chill and refused to whip up to stiff peaks though it did work fine once it set up in the fridge. Not worth the effort.

Okay, this recipe is deeply flawed. First of all, the cake this recipe makes is more akin to a gooey brownie, though you could make it on the chewy side if you ignore the arbitrary 23 minutes it suggests and cook it for much longer--I would say around 40 minutes if you have 3 layer pans in at once. The cake that this recipe makes is absolutely delicious, I am not denying that, but I would strongly advise you to bake it as a stand-alone dessert. Topped with a raspberry sauce or powdered sugar or crème anglaise, this would be a delicious and homey dessert. For a layer cake, it's far too delicate and the layers too flat to make anything other than a huge mess. I am baking a blackout cake and using the vanilla cream and ganache from this recipe and will repost to give my verdict on these other elements of the recipe.

I haven't actually tasted this yet, but I had the same problem with the whipped cream after the gelatin is added not whipping into peaks. I do wonder though, with all the problems of the cake, did you all use a typical round cake pan? They are usually 9" and that might explain some of the issues. I'll rereview once I've tried the finished product.

Had to try the whole cake, in spite of all the reviews.... It just sounds so good! Filling is excellent---although like akalish I didn't get the cream/gelatin mix to form stiff peaks, but it held together well once chilled and has great flavor. I will definitely make filling again. The cakes on the other hand were a disaster---in appearance only. Flavor was very good, but they completely caved in. I tried once as recipe was written and once with Bath, NY's suggestions and they still were nothing like the ones pictured. I would highly suggest using a chocolate cake from ANY other recipe. Everyone loved the flavor, but the appearance of the whole cake was comical.

I took one look at the picture and had to make the vanilla filling, so my rating is for just that. Seeing the mixed reviews of the cake, I decided to make the perfect cocoa cake from this site. I made it in the 9" springform and then just cut it in 3 layers. The two went very well together. I did have a difficult time getting the cream to go into peaks after adding the chilled gelatin-cream mixture. I'm not sure what the problem was. It did develop some body so it worked fine on the cake, but more lift would have been nice. Next time I'll add another 1/8 cup of sugar and another teaspoon of vanilla to enhance the flavor a bit. The gelatin made the cake hold together nicely. I really liked the texture as well. It was almost marshmallow fluff-like.

The cake and the ganache are delicious; great chocolate flavor and a moist cake!! I decided to skip the cream filling to layer between the cakes and used raspberry preserves instead. Yummy! Definitely a make again!

I think I figured this one out! The first time I made this it definitely collapsed in the center and I couldn't help noticing the shiny granular appearance. I thought that the one factor that could differ slighlty by user is the "packing" of the brown sugar. I just made this again using 1 -1/4 cups brown sugar, packed, and about 9 oz of chocolate instead of 6. I also used 1- 1/8 tsp of baking soda and a full tsp of baking powder. It's perfect!!!!

This cake is excellent, fudgy and good :) I used bittersweet chocolate chips instead of semisweet. The vanilla filling is excellent, light and not too sweet. The only issue I had is that the batter was clearly not enough for 3 cake pans, I just made two layers. If I were to make it again I would double the cake recipe and make 3 layers.

I have made many of the more difficult desserts from Bon Appetit over the years; however, something about this cake was very "off." I read all of the reviews but decided to tackle it anyway. The cake sunk in the middle and became very thin and crispy on the outside, which was what other readers said. The actual cake was delicious, but not the result I wanted for guests. I decided to use another 3-layer chocolate cake recipe and make the vanilla creme and ganache frosting....the results were fabulous. I recommend using the filling and ganache, but making your own cake. I was afraid that the filling wouldn't stand up with a denser cake, but it worked well. I bake often but think this recipe needs some tweaking. I agree that making a thinner ganache allows it to pour well and create a very smooth finish. Good luck! If you want a chocolate knockout dessert, try the bete noire from last year's issue.

I'm so relieved that other people had the same exact trouble with this cake as I did... I thought it was me. Ditto on: Not enough batter for three cakes; cake rose on the sides and hollowed in the middle (I turned the top layer upside down and it looked like a dome cake); sides of cake all crunchy and the middle, while brownie-like, wasn't satisfyingly chocolatey. I made seafoam frosting to go with it -- same marshmallow-y texture -- but I'd totally use another cake recipe next time and tackle the filling instead.

Ditto on all the cake disasters. I bake for a living and this recipe is flawed. Why go through making it again and again to get it right when you've followed the recipe? There are lots of great cake recipes on this site! This just isn't one of them!

The filling took me twice to make but it came out great the second time. It was also a time consuming recipe but great for entertaining!

Yum. Cake was delicious. No problems at all. Perhaps not quite as pretty as the picture, I would make it again. Ganache is thick, so if you're more into cake than frosting, half it and drizzle if over the layers.

what a disaster. the whip cream would not whip, the cake didn't rise, i gave up before reaching the ganache. yuck!!!!

Have made this cake twice and both times have ended up wonderfully. Have made it exactly as shown and also have made it in the shape of a football for the Superbowl and then put the white stitching on top with leftover filling. Yes, this cake is a bit difficult to make, but I believe if done right it's fantastic. Don't leave your gelatin mixture in the fridge too long (to where it's starting to gelatinize) or it won't whip up. Just leave it in the suggested 5 min. And make sure you pour on your ganache when still very hot to attain a smooth texture. You can even cut down on the amount of semi-sweet chocolate to attain a thiner ganache to pour. Keep trying and you'll get to where all the work is worth it!

VERY good!! To make layers more even try to use baking strips ( you dapen them with water, then wrap the outside of the pan with it) it helps to have it more ecen, some will still need to be trimmed (cooks treat :) )

This cake was not easy. I trimmed the layers so they were flat and the cream needs to be refrigerated for a while for it to set up. This cake is worth the trouble.

I've made this e times, and it's delicious, but a challenge. Yes, layers don't bake very nicely, they rise on the sides and are a bit flat. Also, adding the warm cream and gelatin mixture to your whipped cream turns it into soup -- leave it in the fridge until it just starts to solidify. Still, it's a fudgy cake and the cream is yummy. Even with its challenges, I'll make it again, and I'll figure out how to make the layers look like the picture (more flour or BP?)

I had the same problems as everyone else. The batter was weird and I had to spread it in the pans, cakes were flat but didn't fall, the filling wouldn't whip up for the second beating and I had to stick it in the frig to get it to firm up well enough to use. Also, not enough filling, too much frosting. It came out tasty in the end but not worth it. My family commented on its flat appearance as opposed to the pic!

I too had problems with the cake. Rose on sides but not in the middle. One layer fell apart coming out of pan. After cake cooled, had a texture like a brownie, but had a very low chocolate flavor. At that point was so dissapointed, abandonded project, and didn't even try cream filling or frosting.

I too had trouble with this recipe. The cake layers hollowed out while baking leaving the sides of the cake much thicker than its middle. The vanila cream also did not whip up as the recipe said it should. After putting it in the refridgerator, it resembled marshmallow fluff, which seemed to work to hold the layers together. It ended up tasting great, which was a relief as this was for my husband's birthday party. I would not recommend this recipe. It was much to stressful and looked nothing like the photo.

My cakes did not rise and 2 of the 3 cracked when I put them on the rack. I also had a problem with the cream filling, it wouldn't whip up enough. The ganache was good but there was almost too much of it. I won't make this again.

I have no idea what went wrong here... I bake cakes almost weekly and I followed the directions to a T. The batter was so thick that I had to smoosh it down into the pans just to fill them, and when they baked, the outside of the cake layers rose up in a ring and got almost crispy, while the inside stayed liquid well past the recommended cooking time. The layers wanted to crumble as I put them on the cooling racks. I didn't have any problems with the filling, although next time I would at least make 1 1/2 the recipe. Everything came out tasting really good, but nothing nearly as pretty as the photograph. Boy did I wish I had waited until others reviewed the recipe to attempt it! I'm so used to using epicurious reviews as a crutch! I have at least a dozen chocolate cake recipes that I would make again before this one.

I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day. Unfortunately it didn't turn out as expected. There wasn't enough batter to make 3 layers so I made 2, but I'm not sure why there wasn't enough batter. If I would've split it into 3 layers they would've been very thing. The cream filling was delicious. The ganache turned out very sweet. The whole thing was good but too sweet, which says a lot coming from a girl who loves her sweets. I put some raspberries on top of the cream fillng and I definitely recommend doing that. I'm not completely giving up on the recipe. I'm going to try to make it one more time.

I used the cake batter part of this recipe to make a birthday cake, lowering the brown sugar content to 1 1/2 cups. It was delicious. For the filling I used a layer of crushed, sweetened raspberries followed by a layer of whipped cream barely sweetened with light corn syrup. After assembling the layers, I frosted the cake with the remaining whipped cream and topped it with shavings of bittersweet chocolate. It was a hit! The layers were not flat as others have experienced. I'm going to make again this week for another birthday, using dulce de leche as the filling.

This was outstanding. I definitely recommend making at least 1 1/2 times the amount of cream. The layers were not as thick as the ones in the picture and it was difficult to cut, but it was absolutely beautiful and delicious. All of my guests asked to take home a piece.

I made this for my daughter's 17th birthday. I had a problem with the cake. Altough I followed the directions closely, it was very flat. Delicious though. We ate much of it while baking another cake. I had no problem with the filling and have never used gelatin with whipping cream. We thought the filling was great, not sugary-sweet like most fillings. The ganache was also a new experience and was delicious.

Same issue with cream filling...on second try I added little more gelatine...also put cream, bowl, beaters and vanilla in freezer and got gelatine cream very cold and longer than usual beating time...would suggest making at least 11/2 times recipe. Yet to do ganache...will do about double recipe, leave out the corn syrup and little more chocolate (my standard recipe)...has to go in refrigator for hour or two to be able to spread and perhaps add bit of corn syrup to reheated balance for glaze.

I am in the process of making this cake, and the cream filling doesn't appear to be nearly firm enough to support a three layer cake without squishing out the sides a bit-nothing like the gorgeous photo. I had the cream thoroughly chilled, but it would not whip to the necessary stiffness. I believe it will taste great, but the appearance will suffer. The ganache was simple and decadent (as usual) and the cake layers were not difficult. Did anyone have success with this?
