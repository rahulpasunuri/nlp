This pie crust is absolutely fabulous! I don't use any other recipe for my baking.

This recipe produces a wonderful savory pastry crust. Light and flakey, it holds its shape beautifully when cooked. An added bonus -- the crust cuts very cleanly, too, so presentation is just gorgeous.

This is the only crust that I have ever been able to work with. This is coming from someone who threw away five pie crusts at Thanksgiving before running to the store for refrigerated ones.
