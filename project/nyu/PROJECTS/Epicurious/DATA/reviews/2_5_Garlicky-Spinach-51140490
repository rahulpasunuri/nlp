This is the second rating, and we average One Fork, not three! Can't even believe there is a recipe for this standard way of making spinach. And I would never do it this way. Don't bother with the cooking. Saute shaved or chopped garlic in olive (or other) oil. Remove bits of garlic if you wish. Nuke the spinach 30 seconds, then toss it in the warm garlic-infused oil.

Giving it 1 Fork for the unnecessary bother of pre-cooking the spinach; a waste of time, water and cleanup effort. Just rinse the spinach so it has some water clinging to the leaves, then saute the garlic in a large lidded pan, add spinach, cover for a few minutes til wilted, proceed.

This is a healthy, tasty, quick and easy recipe. Those not so keen on garlic could substitute 2 lightly fried shallots or spring onions instead.

How can it have 2 1/2 forks if there are 0 reviews?
