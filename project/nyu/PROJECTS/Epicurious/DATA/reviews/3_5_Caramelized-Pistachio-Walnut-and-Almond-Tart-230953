Do not make this recipe! I made a heavy nut tart with several different nuts a few years ago. My family loved it, but I lost the recipe. I tried this one for Thanksgiving and had to throw it out. It was harder than peanut brittle. I couldn't cut it, and nobody could even bite into it. I made it according to the recipe. What a waste of time!

This tart is delicious and fits the bill perfectly for nut-lovers. I especially like the crust which is very tender from the powdered sugar, but an impressive punch of orange (though not overpowering!) that can be tasted in every bite of the tart. Plus, it is firm and sturdy for transporting, looks beautiful without any need for fussy garnishing, and still slices easily. I could not taste the rose water, and would probably add a tiny bit more next time, though I'm sure it added some complexity. I used a 9-in tart pan, so I had a bit extra crust left, but used all the filling, and added some cashews as well as the other three nuts listed.

An excellent tart. Easy enough to through together without a huge amount of effort, but elegant for a fancy dinner party. The honey gives the caramel an especially nice flavour. I have photos and more information about it on my blog here.

I've made this tart 3 times, each time it's a hit with my guests. It's a keeper.

I was expecting more from this dessert...baklava is SO MUCH better than this. This dessert is not sweet enough, and the crust is lacking. Will not make again. (However, the rosewater adds an essential complexity that makes the dish tolerable!)

Perfect ending to a fall/winter meal paired with a tawny port! Instant winner at a dinner with a Master Sommelier! Really nice done as small, individual tarts and freeze well.

I got good reviews of this, but I personally had problems with the fact that the nuts went soggy. I had to make this 2-3 days in advance, and by the time it was served...Anyone have any experience/advice about working with nuts in a filling like this? I did toast them first.

Loved it! This has become a Thanksgiving and special occasion "must have" dessert. Lots of interesting flavor. The rose water can be tricky to find but is worth the effort. Wonderful - my family can't wait for it. Next time I may make two!

Couldn't find the rose water but was so in love with this tart I made it twice in one week. A great holiday dessert and a nice change from pecan pie!

This was absolutely fantastic and everyone loved it. We accidentally used pecans instead of walnuts so that may be a helpful hint to those who thought the walnuts overwhelmed. Reduced rose water to 1 tsp but agree it is definitely a must have ingredient. We will definitely make this again.

This is probably my favorite pie now. Made exactly as written.

just awful! made recipe exactly and even got imported rose water. luckily I made a trial run before Thanksgiving. Pie was hard sticky flavorless. Save yourself a lot of grief and money and find a nice pecan pie recipe!

This is gorgeous and delicious!! I added more orange rind, and more rosewater. I would somehow cut down on the sweetness of the carmel on the nuts. My friends loved it, and could not believe I made it at home. I am middle eastern, and the flavor of the nuts was soooooooo perfect with the rosewater!

I have been SO deceived when I baked this tart. Roasted wallnuts and orange peel in the dough is all it tasted like. No pistachio flavour, no rose water taste although I bought genuine lebanese which has a strong flavour and although the filling tasted so delicious and refined before it was added into the crust. It is rather expensive (pistachios cost a fortune in Switzerland)not worth it for a wallnut tart, I shall not do it again.

haven't made it yet, but sounds like a"birds nest" or a giant baklava without the filo. i don't know of a single pie crust that can compete with flaky filo dough drizzled in honey. I do agree that you're wasting your time without the rose water. Roxanna

I work part time as a caterer, and this is one of the few recipes I've had to make again just for myself. If you can find the rose water, do add it. It adds this ethereal quality that is beyond compare.

This is sooooo good. I've already made it twice and will definitely be making it again. The only thing I left out was the rose water, and it still reminded me of baklava. And I love that it can be made 3 days in advance - perfect for entertaining.
