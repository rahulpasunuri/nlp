So many meats, so little time! Well, not really; it takes a lot of time, actually, so be prepared. A logistics change; the polpette were very nice, but why would you serve your appetizer 5 hours before your meal? No, don't bother with the vegetable oil, cook all your meats in olive oil, then top off the olive oil for your meatballs, then save THAT and do you polpette! Yum...they were crusted with all the goodness of the meal to come, which actually made a scrumptious appetizer. We did the polpette about an hour before the sauce was done simmering; it's nice to be friends with a sausage maker who made all of the sausages and supplied the various pork products for the meal and then let them be cooked at his house! This is the stuff of dreams, truly; oh, and to help really make the sharing go, we used tongs and took out all of the meats back onto a serving platter so that everyone could make sure they got a little something; the braciole stayed in with the sauce, but the bigger meats, especially the linked sausages were easier to cut and distribute this way. I paired this with the Spring Greens with Sherry Vinaigrette recipe that called for the pork drippings, so the wonderful pork flavors just went on and on! We finished with the Cantaloupe Semifreddo, which was a surprising recipe, and got great remarks, including the Italian restaurant I took the leftover portion to the next day. You can find both of those recipes on here; buon appetito!

Made it as written and received a wonderful compliment from an Italian friend. She told me she felt like she was eating in her grandmother's kitchen. High praise, indeed!

The braciole were the favorites among my family. This recipe is exceptionally time consuming, but fun to make and very tasty. You need a giant pot for this, I used my biggest dutch oven and it filled it to the very brim, so instead of simmering on the stovetop for hours, I put it in a low oven (200F), partially covered, with a sheet pan on the rack below to catch any incidental spillover.

I have made this several times. My entire family of fussy eaters loved it. Did add a piece of parm. cheese rind to sauce during cooking. Kept well for left-overs the next nights.

I make dinner for my friends every Sunday and this was a huge hit on my first try. I followed the recipe exactly as stated.

Watery. Made everything except the beef braciole. Even after 5 hours slowly simmering the pork did not soften as I expected it to. Definitely tasted delicious, but if I were to make this again I would NOT puree more than half of the tomatoes and would omit the pork. The polpette were devine.

It took all day, but it was so worth it. We omitted the pork shoulder but used all other meats including boneless pork ribs, which turned out to be the suprise darlings of the sauce. Great recipe, we had a lot of fun dedicating our day to this beautiful creation.

I'm going to rate and review this recipe without making it yet. I have been cooking for well over 50 years and have made meatballs, pot roasts with different meats, etc and without tasting it, I can say the Ragu is the BEST stew, or anything else you want to call it. So putting them all together can only be exquisitely sublime. GOOD JOB, GINA!

I made this for a Christmas meal and it was spectacular. Be sure not to overcook the meat so that it maintains it's shape and is recognizable. Everyone thought this was spectacular. I added a little crushed red pepper to the sauce.
