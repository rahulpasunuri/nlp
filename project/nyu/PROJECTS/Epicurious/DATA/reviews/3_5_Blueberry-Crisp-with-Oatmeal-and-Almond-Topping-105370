I used raspberries and blueberries with a pecan topping. Family enjoyed it a lot. Not a spectacular dessert but great for summer.

I love this - easy, flavorful and good for dieters! I made no adjustments the first time but can see adding lemon zest to the berries and/or mixing the blueberries with other fruits (cherries and peaches, for example). I didn't find it too sweet at all! Just perfect.

I thought this was very good. I did take another posters advice and used pecans instead of almonds and it came out great. It is sweet but I'm expecting it to be sweet, its not a sickly sweet however I guess it would depend on how tart your blueberries woudl be. Mine were on the tart side so it worked out wonderfully. Supper yum with a dollop of vanilla icecream while the crisp is still hot and it all melts together... heavenly!

I thought this was pretty good for an "everyday" kind of dish. First I had it for dessert with vanilla ice cream and it was WAY too sweet for me (and I only used about 2/3 of the sugar called for). But I ate the leftovers with unsweetened yogurt, and it was just right that way.

Loved this! Substituted pecans for almonds, reduced the sugar by 1/2, but did double the topping per some reviews. Someone complained about using non-quick oats which is all I had, so I took whole pecans and the long-cook oats in the food processor to break both down before adding the rest of the topping to blend. Very tasty!

I wasn't wild about this dish. There was quite a bit of "chew" to the topping, possibly because I didn't use quick oats, but regular old-fashioned oats (not steel cut). However, I think it was because of the almonds. This can be good or bad, depending on your tastes.

I forgot to mention that we baked and served these in individual gratin dishes. If you can, I would highly recommend doing it this way, as we think that it actually enhanced the flavor, and it was much more fun that way. With homemade vanilla ice cream, it was awesome.

This was awesome. I served it to company with rave reviews, yet it was a simple summery dish that I quickly threw together. I quadrupled the topping, but I think that I also had a lot more blueberries than the recipe called for. I hate it, by the way, when recipes call for quantities such as "3 1/2 pint baskets." What if I didn't buy the blueberries in a pint basket? What's wrong with measuring the blueberries by cups, or by weight? Anyway, I would highly recommend this recipe. It's nice with a little lemon zest mixed in with the blueberries.

I have made this recipe COUNTLESS times since it came out in Bon Appetit 2001, and it is always a huge hit. Only thing I do differently is make individual servings in ramekins. With vanilla ice cream melting on top - absolutely divine. The recipe is so easy to make, and freezes beautifully - I keep ramekins of this in the freezer and can pull them out at any time for a last minute, splendid dessert. Great to make when blueberries are cheap and in season!

Simple, tasty, relatively healthy, and super easy. I make this about once a week with various berries.

Easy & very good. Used wild blueberries, & 3/4 cup brown sugar. Almonds are a great touch.

Easy and delicious! Followed the recipe (plus added some raspberries) and found it came out a bit too sweet, so I'll cut back on the brown sugar the next time.

I used tart cherries and apples with amareto and cornstarch to bind it together. I also doubled the topping. Quick, easy and delicious.

It was a likable dessert. Good for everyday, but I wouldn't serve it for company as it was not so special. It goes well with ice cream to add enough sweetness to the fruit.

Easy, fast and delicious! Great way to use blueberries or any other berries. Ditto on doubling crunch topping. Lots of room to play and adapt to your specific taste.

God, talk about simple and delicious! I kinda followed the recipe as far as I could; I only had a pint of blueberries so I lined individual cups in a muffin pan with some Reynold's wrap, spooned in the prepared berries and sprinkled the topping on. It came out in perfect serving sizes for my three year old and he loved it with vanilla yogurt. I will definitely be making this recipe again since it was so easy and so versatile. Things I added: A little orange zest and juice to the berries and chopped, roasted pecans to the topping.

Not bad at all... maybe a tad too sweet for my taste but I will know to decrease the sugar next time. It gets extra points for being a super-easy dessert - whipped it up in minutes.

This was fantastic -- I did double the topping as well. Since so many reviewers noted scarfing hungry husbands, let me add I live in a collective of lesbian Marxists and we all loved this communally as well. It's a keeper!

So good, so easy! I added 2 more cups of berries & lemon zest. Also doubled the topping--so glad I heeded advice from others! No almonds, but roasted pecans were great!

I don't like blueberries that much, but they were on sale so I thought I'd give this a try. It was delicious! Did not use almonds, doubled the topping (don't add the salt if you use salted butter though- it was noticeable), and served with Breyer's vanilla bean icecream. Yum.

Excellent blend of flavors. I will double or triple the topping as others suggested, though. I also agree that it is kind of runny, so it doesn't really serve up as a pie would. I put it in small bowls like a cobbler.

Rating: 2
I thought this was good, but not great. Maybe I'm more of a cobbler person than a crisp person. It wasn't all that sweet, so it was a nice contrast to the frozen yogurt. I might have it for breakfast tomorrow with some regular vanilla yogurt.

This was a great use of my blueberries. I doubled the topping as others recomended. I loved the contrast of textures. I served with low fat ice cream instead of the yogurt. My additions may have raised the calorie count slightly but it was so worth it.

Very tasty recipe but the blueberries are too loose. Needs something to bind it and keep it from running all over the plate, possibly some flour or corn starch.

I still have the Bon Appetit issue with this recipe I liked it so much! It's easy and delicious. I did double the oats/flour "crisp" part though. Enjoy!

I made this for an anniversary party, but it was left in the fridge. My boyfriend and I ate it the next morning for breakfast instead. He's not a big fan of sweets, so next time I'm going to cut back on the sugar. Also, I doubled the topping like many reviewers suggested, but left out the almonds. Next time I think I'll triple the topping, because without nuts, there still isn't enough to completely cover the dish.

I'll probably make this dish again since it is so easy but I didn't think it was anything to write home about.

this is a great recipe for blueberries, not too sweet and the almonds keeps the topping crunchy even as leftovers. i'll definitely be making this again!

Really easy, fast, and good. I left out the almonds since I didn't have any. I plan to try the topping on apples next.

I didn't have a pie dish, so I used a square baking pan. I didn't think there was enough oatmeal and almond topping to complement the blueberries. I'll try it again and double the topping ingredients.

This was the perfect way to enjoy our mid-summer blueberries! Since I had three pints of berries I doubled the recipe and used chopped Pecans, which I had, in place of Almonds, which I did not. The whole thing was gone before nightfall. My family loved it.

this was so quick and easy, i didnt have blueberries so i used blackberries and nectarines, which worked very well. the frozen yogurt is a must.

Wonderful recipe. I used a low fat spread in place of butter, whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour, and walnuts in place of almonds. It was great !

Rating: 3
We wanted to do something a little "more" than our usual blueberries and cream but didn't want it to be heavy or overpowering. This was quick, easy and delicious. The topping complements the berries so nicely without "stealing the show". Having nearly perfect berries probably helped, but this is definitely a keeper!

Very easy and tastes great! I don't usually make desserts, but this looked good , so I tried it. Have made it a few times and have gotten rave reviews. I also used raspberries and strawberries mixed in with the blueberries and doubled the topping.

Very easy and very tasty. I used walnuts instead of almonds as that is what I had. I will definitely make this again.
