This was excellent - just the right cardamom flavor. Some tips that might help others: Following from other reviews I used 3 cardamom pods crushed well to try and crush the seeds inside the pod too, and left milk, cardamom, vanilla seeds and sugar to infuse for 10-15 mins before adding to the chocolate. During this time the milk cooled, and this caused the mix to curdle when I added milk and cream. I ended up heating it gently over a double boiler to melt the chocolate again and it came back together. Then after it cooled I put it in the fridge for a while before spinning as I usually do with my icecream mixes. This wasn't a good idea - it set up and meant that when I started spinning it was ready in 5 mins and not as creamy as if it was spinning for longer. Still great though, and as other reviewers said, very rich.

I agree with some of the earlier reviewers re: cardamom & vanilla. The 1st time I made this, I doubled cardamom and let it sit in the pan for 5 min, and still we could not taste it. This time around, I used half black and half fancy white cardamom (Penzey's) to see if that boosts the flavor. Also took the milk/cardamom/sugar/vanilla mix off heat and let it cool for a minute or 2, then put a lid on it to steep.

This is decadently rich, and came together quickly. Didn't have whole cardamom pods, so used 1/8 tsp ground. Couldn't taste it, so next time I'll try 1/4 tsp. I also steeped the infused milk, as nonnagina recommended. As we scraped the last bits from the ice cream maker, husband was already asking when I'll make it again. Soon!

This is a great recipe, but I made one amendment. The 1st batch I followed the recipe exactly and the result, while chocolate-y, had no taste of cardamom and vanilla. For the 2nd attempt,I added sugar, cardamom pods, vanilla seeds as well as the half vanilla bean pod to the pan of milk, and then covered the pan and left it to steep for 15 minutes. Then proceed as normal. If you're going to spend the money on the vanilla and cardamom, you should be able to taste them in the ice cream!

I made this with the raspberry spiked chocolate brownie recipe. Very intense chocolate. Would make again. A little goes a long way.
