This is fabulous! I made it to top a vanilla cheesecake and used Vanilla Royale liqueur instead of Frangelico - then made it again to serve as a dessert by itself. It got rave reviews from everyone.

Here's the problem you're having with the recipe...it is part of the recipe for the Frozen Chocolate Dacquoise and it is meant to be frozen, not served on it's own. Believe me, when it is frozen as the recipe states, it is perfect.

I have made this dish twice, and had excellent results both times. Because I also noted that it is thinner than a traditional mousse should be, I served it over fresh strawberries and raspberries...essentially a white chocolate whipped cream. I didn't have frangelico on hand, so I used just a few drops of pure almond extract, and had excellent results. This is overall a lovely compliment to fresh berries.

I made this mousse yesterday for company last night. I was concerned about it having enought time to firm so used the suggestion of adding a 1/4 package of Knox geletin. I mixed the geletin with a tablespoon of water and then heated it in the microwave for 40 seconds on high per the instructions on the geletin package. I added this to the mixture before adding the chocolate. I used amaretto for the liquor flavoring. My mousse came out very firm even though it was only in the frig about 6 hours. My only negative comment is the texture wasn't smooth like I expected it to be. It is a bit lumpy. I noticed other comments about the texture. I wonder if I over cooked it since it took about 10 minutes to reach the desired temperature for 3 minutes or possibly over beat the whipping cream. The texture isn't bad just not what I expected compared to restaurant mousses I have had. I served it with sliced strawberries and blueberies on top and a small sprig of mint for a little green color. My guests loved it and no one complained about the texture. Every last bite disappeared and the glasses were scraped clean!

I haven't made this recipe but noticed the comments on its consistency and would like to recommend a solution. You can sprinkle 1/4 pack of gelatin with cold water. Once it has absorbed the water, melt the gelatin with a small amount of alcohol in a pan. Add the melted gelatin to the mousse before you add the chocolate. Chill for a few hours and your mousse should set nicely.

I really liked this mousse. Following suggestions from another reviewer, I froze the mousse since it was not quite firm enough. Fantastic. I used fresh berries as a garnish, and everyone in my family loved it. I will definitly make this recipe again!

I loved this dessert, but here's the kicker...it was 10 times better 2 days later. The day I made it, I didn't leave enough time for it to set up. The texture was too soupy, as others have mentioned. Since I made a double batch, we had some left-over, and had it to dip fresh strawberries in...it was sublime. I would recommend making it at least a day in advance, and leave out the extra liquid (the liquor). Add it to your fresh berries, instead.

I did not care for the texture of this dessert. Like the last reviewer, I may have made it wrong because it was soupy. The flavors blended well and the presentation in a crystal goblet was attractive, however, the texture ruined the entire dessert. I was waiting for my guests to "drink" the mousse, which may have been easier than using a spoon!!!

I don't get it. Perhaps I made it wrong, but the consistency came out kind of goopy -- like weak whipped cream. The frangelico was too strong -- maybe it would taste better with the recipe it was paired with, but by itself, it was a disappointment

I make this mousse on a regular basis, substituting brandy for Frangelico. I've found that it's crucial to constantly stir the egg mixture and to allow plenty of time for the mousse to cool.

I made this for a birthday party, and it was a hit. I was dissapointed with the texture, though...although I loved the sabayon method for mousse, mine never got firm enough. So I froze it, and it was fantastic: it doesn't get super-hard in the freezer, just hard enough to hold its shape when spooned. Berries as a garnish really make the dish.

Delicious, but very rich. Serve with fresh berries to lighten it up. I substituted rum for Frangelico and will try Kahlua the next time for a different taste. This is a simple recipe that is great for company and never fails to impress.
