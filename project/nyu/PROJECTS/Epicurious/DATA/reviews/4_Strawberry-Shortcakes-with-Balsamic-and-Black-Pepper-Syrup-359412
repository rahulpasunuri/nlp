Every single person agreed that this was the best strawberry shortcake they'd ever had. Will unquestionably make this again!

Don't change a thing. This is hands down the best strawberry shortcake I have ever had. I was a little worried that my husband wouldn't like the balsamic vinegar and pepper, but after he was half a bowl into the dessert, I asked him whether he tasted anything "different." He didn't, and was very surprised when I told him about the vinegar and pepper. It adds something special without being obvious. I will be making this dessert all summer long!

HUGE hit at a dinner party last night, with 3 Southerners raving about the biscuits. Surprisingly easy to pull together - this is going to become a summer staple I suspect. Might add a touch more sugar to the strawberry filling to balance out the acidity of the vinegar.

Strawberry shortcake is my all time favorite dessert. This is the best recipe I've ever had. If you like real shortcake (not pound cake or angel food) you won't be disappointed. The shortcake is perfection, and the subtle additions of balsamic and black pepper raise the dish to a new level.

I doubled the recipe and served it as the dessert contribution to my daughter's Memorial Day picnic-potluck. It was the perfect ending for the meal, and we had multiple requests for a repeat performance. We made a scone variation for the shortcakes, very short & flaky. I resisted adding lemon zest so we could really savor the peppery balsamic syrup without any competing flavor - the first time, but I plan to add it for the ones we're taking to Fourth of July. This time we will have LOCAL berries rather than the 'imports' from California. Can't wait to enjoy this amazing recipe again!! Might add blueberries to really round out the patriotic theme.

This was incredible. I halved the recipe and there were too many strawberries for the amount of biscuits I have, but it wasn't a problem -- you could just eat the strawberries separately (and use the balsamic/strawberry sauce in a salad dressing), or do what I did, and use them in a cobbler the next night.

Absolutely the best strawberry shortcake recipe I have ever tried (I think I have tried them all!). Usually the 'shortcake' is too much like a biscuit... these are simply sublime--great crumble, very moist, absorbs the fruit syrup beautifully. I made a few minor adjustments, making the shortcakes bigger and adjusting baking time. Use very ripe strawberries--with the balsamic vinegar... perfect!

Strawberries in balsamic was exceptional. Easy to make and delicious. I would give them 5 stars/forks if I could. But I have to deduct for the shortcake. Mine came out flat, undercooked in the middle, and too heavy. Find another recipe and use it with the strawberries.

I give the strawberry portion of this recipe 4 forks, at least, but the biscuits were just OK. I will definately use the strawberry recipe again. The balsamic flavour was suble and really enhanced the first strawberries of the season.

I've done strawberries with balsamic before and loved it. The pepper is a great addition! We do prefer sponge cake instead of biscuits. This will be our go-to recipe from now on.

Don't change a thing. It is perfect. The best shortcake recipe I've ever tried. Use the biscuit with any other recipe for fruit. The syrup, likewise, is really delicious with strawberries and I plan to try it with blackberries as well.

Yumm! I've never made strawberry shortcake before this. I took it to a dinner party and it was loved by young (4 year old) and old . . . okay . . . middle aged.

This was quite good, and I will be making it again. The balsamic vinegar and black pepper make it a bit more complex. The shortcake was tasty (sweet, like I like it!) There's probably a recipe with a flakier or higher rise out there somewhere.
