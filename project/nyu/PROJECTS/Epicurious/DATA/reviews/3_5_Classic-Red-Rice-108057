Love this rice dish paired with a Mexican pork dish and jicama salad.

Definitely enjoyed the dish. I had left over plain rice and spiced it up with this recipe as the outline. I had 14 ounces of really ripe fresh tomatoes I pureed with the onion and garlic after I de-seeded the tomatoes. I put the serrano chile in with the puree. Then I mixed that with the already cooked rice along with some cumin seed. Turned out like red rice and was enjoyed by the group.

I really enjoyed this rice. I used heirloom tomatoes and onions fresh from the garden, put them into the food processor to make a puree instead of using a can of tomatoes. I used about half of the oil recommended to 'toast' the rice. I added a little bit of salt at the end and omitted the carrots because I didn't have any, but otherwise followed the directions exactly. Very yummy-husband said he loved it!

Actually mine came out good....I did use fresh tomatoes and I subsituted jalapeno's for the serannos....I also used scallions cause I had them and wanted to use them....I left the seeds in and it does have heat.....I think it's really good....

Well, I went to the trouble of making this, and ended up making another batch of my own devising, and didn't serve this one to my guests. My teenager called it "child rice" and that, indeed, is what it is: bland and looks like a toybox.

So simple to make, and turned out great! I even used frozen corn and peas, and it was just fine. Next time I will just add more chiles as it wasn't as spicy as I would have liked.

Well I don't know where I went wrong but maybe it's because I forgot to saute the rice in the oil and so I just immediately added it to the tomatoes and water (with bullion). It's brown rice. It's been cooking for an hour and I've added at least 2 more cups of water over the last 1/2 hour, but the rice is still crunchy. And I burned my lip tasting it. I'm not having a good time with this.

I've made this several times since my first review and it has really grown on me. Does work better if you use a blender, but definitely doable with ingredients chopped finely. This recipe is great for adding variations to, to your taste. With peas carrots, and corn or without any, or with just peas. Accomodates different chiles. The main thing is the garlic, tomato and onion mixture that really gives it the flavor. I added a bell pepper to the puree last time I made this and it turned out great too. I would definitely use pico de gallo, cayenne, or another spice to give some more flavor and add some heat.

This was a tasty rice dish which I will probably make again; not exactly what I was looking for - I really have just been trying to figure out how to make classic Mexican rice like you get at a taqueria... this did not taste that authentic to me, but great flavor nonetheless... I made modifications based on ingredients I had available. Used 1 serrano & 1 bell pepper, chopped fine to be eaten in the dish rather than discarded after cooking. Also chopped the cilantro and did not discard but ate it as part of the dish. Used fresh chopped tomatoes (3 or 4 romas), did not blend ingredients. Added generous helpings of pico de gallo seasoning and a pinch of salt. It took longer for all the liquid to absorb than the recipe said. But had a nice hearty flavor, great served with beans and tortillas for a simple dinner or as part of a more elaborate meal.

This fabulous and I generally have all the ingrediants, except for seranos and substitute jalapenos.

Absolutely love the rice! It is flavorful and tender. I did not have serrano, so I chopped up a jalapeno with the ribs and the seeds; did not drain the tomatoes as suggested by other reviewers; put in some diluted chicken stock instead of just water; and it came out smelling great and tasted great! I used it as a component for my bean and beef burrito (another recipe from epicurious), and it is fantastic!

Absolutely love the rice! It's flavorful and tender. As suggested by other reviewers, I did not drain the tomatoes and I have some chicken stock on hand, so I diluted it with water and used it as the liquid for the rice. Also, I did not have serrano, so I chopped up a piece of jalapeno with the ribs and seeds and put it in the rice. I made the rice as part of my components for the burrito, it was great with beef and beans from another recipe. Definitely make it again!

Need a standby rice dish for all your Mexican themed parties? This is it - but do add a bit more garlic and salt.

We enjoyed the rice. It was rather simple and easy to make. Changes I made are: (1) did not drain the tomatoes; (2) replaced the serrano. My parents do not like spicy food, so I replaced the serrano chiles with 1/2 a pablano. I sliced it up, added it to the tomatoes, onion and garlic to puree. I will definately make this again when I serve tacos.

Rating: 2
i loved the ingrediant combination, but the cooking instructions did not work for me. I followed others suggestions and did not drain the tomatoes, but I did crush them and still the rice needed more water to finish cooking. However, it worked well as a first layer in a casserole followed by leftover pinto beans covered with the leftover carnitas pork from May 2003 Bon Appetit mixed with salsa then crushed tortilla chips and grated cheese. Bake 30 -40 min. at 350 (oh, add the cheese for the last 5 - 10 min.

Awesome "fresh" taste. I was a bit leery as the liquid wasn't being absorbed. Don't panic, it will. I had to cook mine longer to get the right consistency. Since I was making it for kids, I just used corn (and lots of it) as the vegetable. I followed another person's advice to not drain the tomato juice. This is a keeper!

Restaurant versions pale in comparison to this easy-to-prepare tasty side dish. Because I was serving some spice wimps, I used only two serranos and scraped most of the seeds. I didn't miss the spice at all.

Used a Magic Bullet instead of a blender. Much easier.

This was very tasty! I only used one pepper and it was perfect - flavorful but not too spicy. I used petite-diced tomatoes and did not puree them (i was using the blender for something else) and we really liked the way it turned out, but I might try pureeing next time.

I did not drain or puree the tomato. Serrano chilis are pretty hot, close to a habenaro. Next time I will back off and use a milder chili, it was too hot for the kids.

I did this last night for a friends gathering and everybody loved it! It was very easy to make as written, but I think next time I'll try the diced tomatoes can and skip the pureeing step. A definite keeper!

I mince the onion and garlic, add them to an undrained can of diced roasted tomatoes and skip using the blender altogether. It's really good made without the other veggies, too.

I made this for a dinner party last night as a side dish for broiled jalapeno flank steak. It was terrific. As other reviewers recommended, I did not drain the canned tomatoes prior to pureeing. Also, I didn't add the cilantro because my mother can't stand the stuff (I love it and next time I'll use it). I used two serrano chiles and the medium-to-hot heat level was perfect. This one goes into my permanent repertoire!

I consider myself a pretty good cook but for some reason I have a real problem with rice. What is the purpose of cooking the rice in oil til golden? It seems like everytime I do this, the rice turns out crunchy in the middle. I wrecked this recipe like usual with rice, but it did have really good flavor.

Rating: 3
This recipe really is delicious!! I would rate it 3.5 forks. I agree with the previous review who suggested not to drain the tomatoes - better with the juice. I omitted the serranos and used 1 jalapeno pepper instead - was plenty spicy for me. I used arborio rice instead of a medium grain and it worked nicely. I also crumbled some feta cheese over the rice before serving. May not be the "authentic" way to serve it, but it looked beautiful and really added to the rice.

This is a delicious rice dish which I have made many times. A note of caution - do not touch the inside of a serano chile without gloves on. For some reason I decided this time to take seeds out of the chile before putting them into the pot - BIG mistake. Even tho' I washed my hands thoroughly afterward, when I touched my eye it KILLED - and it burned for the longest time. Even the next morning it still stung. YOWWIE! Also, you can substitute brown rice for the white in this recipe it just takes longer to absorb the water. Oh, one more thing, don't drain the tomatoes - it's better with the juice! YUM

Finally - a rice dish that tastes authentic and has a nice combo of flavours. I did use less oil, and plain forgot to add the carrot. Also, I'm not sure what kind of hot pepper I used, but it was good and spicy.

I thought this rice was great and will make it again. I followed several of the previous suggestions such as decreasing the oil and not draining the tomatoes. I also used a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (instead of the serranos) which I pureed with the tomatoes - this definitely spiced up the rice and gave it a nice smoky flavor. I used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes and chicken broth in place of the water/salt. Next time I might only use half a chipotle pepper to decrease the heat a little. A keeper for us!

I made this pretty much accordinging to the recipe, except added shredded chicken breast to make it a one-dish meal. It was easy and harmless but I found it a bit bland. If I made it again (which I might, given how quick and easy it was) I'd probably add more in the way of spice.

I didn't care for this recipe. Thought it was a bit bland. I'll be going back to my usual Spanish Rice recipe.

Had no fresh hot peppers, so I added a tbsp of cayenne and double the garlic in with the tomatoes, and rehydrated an ancho chile, which I added with the veggies; I used the rehydration water in with the 1c. Had no fresh coriander, so I used powdered. Extra chopped onions, celery and red pepper; omitted the corn. Would be better if it were a bit drier, but otherwise delicious.

This was a very easy recipe, and as it stands, I give it a 3 fork rating. The second time I made it, I used 1 can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos instead of the recommended can of tomatoes. I found that it gave it a slightly more rounded out flavor and was less "tomato-ey" than the original recipe. The binding of the cilantro is not required--- simply tear off a hank from the cilantro bundle, lay it on top, cook as directed, then before serving, swirl it with a fork and lift it out.

This is a good basic recipe. However, I added about a teaspoon of salt and a little extra water. I also increased the onion and garlic and ommitted the veggies. I use canned serrano chiles and added the marinated carrots to the rice.

Rating: 2
Really disappointing. Only change I made was to use brown rice instead of white, so maybe that was the problem. It was better the next day mixed with some spicy red beans, which is the only thing saving this recipe from a one-fork rating for me. Won't try this one again.

Rating: 3
Excellent and easy. I added more water than was called for, next time I won't even drain the tomatoes. You could use frozen mixed veggies (carrots, peas, corn)in a pinch. This was great with chili relleno casserole.

I hate spainish rice but love this recipe!!! I made it for my bunco group to go with the crispy pork carnitas and black beans, and was so surprised when I ate it! Easy, fresh tasting, and pretty. I too use a bit less oil, and I have chopped the cilantro with the same results.

Rating: 3
My husband and I loved this dish and I am not a big rice fan. Easy & quick. I would definitely cut back on the oil next time. I also used brown rice which I thought tasted great. Did not omit anything and thought it had enough spice and flavor. I think it is worthwhile to bundle the cilantro since by the end they are close to disintegrating into the rice and bundling it makes it easier to take out, especially if you have to cook it longer than expected in order to have all liquid absorbed.

Easy and fab! That's what I love - and my guests loved it too.

This is so much tastier than the "prefab" spanish rice. Plus it is not too difficult. I followed the recipe, except when it came to bundling the cilantro. I just threw in 6 sprigs with the long stem still attached to make it easy to remove before serving. I made the tomato puree well ahead of time and got all my vegies ready and refrigerated that until needed. Then when it was time to start the rice it went like a snap. I made the hand mashed pinto beans with cheese (very tasty), as well as the carnitas with avacado salsa, and tomato/serrano salsa all from the same issue of Bon Apetit. It was one of the best meals I have ever made, so authentic and it beat the heck out of the "gringo" Mexican meals I generally make with ground beef, cheddar cheese, Pace, canned beans, and packaged rice mix. So well worth the time.

Fantastic. Will definitly have this as part of my staple diet. Used much less oil than (1-2 T.), jalapeno pepper instead of the chile, no cilantro and 3x the garlic. Turned out awesome.

Great recipe! Simple to make and it made the house smell wonderfully delicious. I omitted the peas, added a bit more corn, just threw in some cilantro (who has time to bundle it and for what????). Also added 1/2 a can of green enchilada sauce (it was leftover from the other Mexican dish I was making and couldn't just throw it away). Took a bit longer to cook than recipe called for. So good, I made it a few days later (no extra enchilada sauce to toss in this time and I don't think it was as good as it was with it). Great "keeper" recipe.

Used only 1 tbs oil, sauteed garlic and onion for a a few minutes, added rice and sauteed for an additional 3-4 minutes. Mixed in some fresh tomatoes with the canned and processed them together with a jalapeño (I like things a little fiery:-) Also added a few more cilantro sprigs and dropped the carrot. Very tasty. I'm sure it would be even better if you roast the tomatoes, garlic and onion on the grill or under the broiler first.

Rating: 3
This smelled delicious as it was cooking! I used fresh vine-ripened tomatoes and all the veggies. I got busy preparing my other dishes and forgot to put the serrano chiles and cilantro in when described. I remembered when it was time to remove from the heat! I think this would have added a bit more zest for it to cook the entire time. Next time I will remember!

Rating: 4
This rice is awesome! I add a bit more peas and corn, (I use frozen peas and frozen white corn), and after you remove it from the heat I let it sit a lot longer than 5 minutes, more like 15 or more, until I have finished preparing the rest of the meal. I don't add any extra water. We make this every time we have a Mexican feast it is so authentic and very pretty.

Rating: 3
Good recipe. I didn't have serrano chiles so I used chipotle chilis in adobo sauce. Rather than add the chilies to the rice whole, I blended the chilis with the onions and garlic. The heat of the chilis permeated the rice and the chipotles gave it a nice smokey flavor. The carrots didn't seem to fit so I left them out and but did include the peas and corn. The corn added a nice sweetness. I substituted tomato sauce for the whole tomatoes and it turned out a bit thick. I will try the whole tomatoes next time. I served this at a party and the dish got rave reviews. I'll be making it again.

Rating: 2
This is a good foundation recipe but it needs work. I cut the oil in half and still ended up draining the sauteed rice on paper towels before adding the tomato puree - 1 tbsp of oil would be enough. I think the corn, peas, and carrots are superfluous and I will omit them next time. The chile and cilantro flavor did not come through. I will try thinly slicing one chile and and cooking it with the rice, then stirring chopped cilantro into the finished product.

Rating: 3
Based on previous reviews, I added a bit more liquid to the rice. I wish I hadn't done this since the rice was a little on the creamy side. I cooked my rice in a rice cooker, which is more efficient than stove-top, so I really didn't need the extra liquid. I used canned petite dice tomatoes with chilies and this worked well. I also sauteed the rice and onion together in the rice cooker before steaming. I didn't add any other vegetables, just the canned tomatoes and chicken broth (instead of water). The recipe would not have been easier, but perhaps drier would have been better.

I made this rice without the peas to accommodate my family. They loved it and so did I. Simple to make and tastes great.

Rating: 2
The first time I made the rice I used long grain, couldn't find medium grain rice. I liked how it turned out and thought it had a nice subtle flavor. The second time I made it I tripled the recipe and used medium grain rice, however the rice was too hard in the middle and I kept adding water to cook it further. Eventually I ended up with mushy rice (it looked more like risotto) and I threw it all out. Oh well.

If you like rice, this is a good recipe. I have made it twice now, the first time the rice itself was a little crunchy, so the second time I added an additional 1/2 cup water (1 1/2 cups total). Much better.
