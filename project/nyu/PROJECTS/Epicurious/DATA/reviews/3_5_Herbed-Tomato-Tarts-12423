I've made this several times. To correct the sogginess issue I salted and drained the tomatoes before hand.

I love this recipe - have made it without the anchovy paste, using parmesean on the crust while pre-cooking. I added mozzarella after the crust is golden and then topped with the tomatoes and garlic oil. My secret to avoiding soggy crust is to salt the tomatoes and set out on paper towels for 30 minutes before adding to tart. Delicious!

Great, but the tomatoes made it a little soggy. I may use 8oz. instead of 4 oz. of mozzarella the next time I make it.

We have been making this recipe since first seeing it in Gourmet it published in 1995. We make it for goup gatherings and have been asked for the recipe many times. If you don't think you like anchovy just cut is back a little - no one even knwos it's there and it really tastes good. This is really good with all those fresh home grown tor farmers market summer tomatoes.

This was excellent - disappeared quickly at the dinner party we brought it to. Next time we'll use real tart crust instead of puff pastry as the crust wasn't nearly substantial enough to hold the filling. The bottom was also bit soggy, and the tart just needed a little more starch to it. Omitted the anchovy paste (gross) - it was unnecessary anyway! Also, we used fontinella cheese instead of parmesan - so good! It was hard not to eat the ingredients while making this!

I also used pesto. I cut 1/2 in strips and used an egg wash to seal the edges. This is from the goat cheese and redonion tart (4 forks).

The puff pastry puffed up, sending the melting cheese, tomatoes, and herbs slipping over the edge of the tart and onto the baking sheet. Fortunately, I had lined the sheet with the new non-stick Release foil, so I was able to scoop up the goodies and put them back in the tart shell, after pricking it to make it stop puffing. Beware!

I think this is an excellent recipe, however, I have improvised in that I've omitted the onion and the anchovy paste - I brushed the top of the pastry dough with olive oil instead and used fresh, home made mozzerella instead of store bought. I've had great success every time I've made it and feel it's a real winner.

Huge hit at the party last night. Very tastey and not difficult to prepare. Both tarts were gone lickity-split! Next time I'll double the recipe for a party. I'm not into anchovies, so I used pesto. Great way to use up some garden tomatoes!

Made a traditional tart crust rather than the store bought dough and used pesto rather than anchovie paste. Had to bake it longer than recipe called for--but it was very tasty and I'm baking another to take for a dinner party tomorrow.

Nice summer tart! I had trouble rolling out the dough, too, but found plastic wrap between the pin and the dough to work pretty well. Made just one tart in a tart pan with removable bottom for a more traditional look. Had to bake a bit longer than receipe calls for, but still delicious. Try brushing anchovy paste on crust with a pastry brush. Will give great flavor but not overpowering.

This tastes great. I made it with olive paste instead of ths anchovy and I guess pesto will be good too. I baked it in a pie pan about 30 mins and it crispy.

How you're supposed to roll out the pastry to that size I have no idea. I rolled it out as far as I could and decided cutting it in half would make them too small. Big mistake. The center didn't cook and it was doughy and messy. the flavor was fine but was dissapointed in the overall outcome.

Made 2 and took one to the neighbor to thank her for the fresh tomatoes. So embarressed! Gross! The fish taste stayed with me all night.Neighbor never did comment on it! Might make again but NO anchovies!

Found this a little tricky to make. Needed more anchovy paste to cover the pastry and then the result was a little soggy. Delicious taste. No leftovers.

I've made this a couple of times - they disappear off the plate! On a couple of occasions, I brought the assembled, uncooked tart to a party and cooked it there with great results. I found it a bit tricky to roll out the pastry correctly, but it comes out fine anyway. Agree w/ previous reviewers about tomatoes (fewer) and anchovy paste (use it). Enjoy!

Delish. This was such an easy and very impressive appetizer. It took no time at all to prepare, but it looks like you spent hours ... ah the magic of puff pastry. One note on the amount of tomatoes it calls for though ..I only used three med. vine ripened tomatoes ... I don't know where they came up with 8? Three was more than enough.

This is a fabulous recipe ... utterly delicious and gorgeous to look at, too! I urge you to use a thin layer of the anchovy paste. It's not strong or overpowering at all, but definitely adds a special something to the flavor. Besides mozzerella, I've made this with whatever cheese I've had on hand -- cheddar, muenster, swiss or a combination of several kinds -- and it always tastes great.

The tomato tarts are terrific. If I hadn't added the thin layer of anchovy paste myself, I wouldn't have known it was there; but it certainly added something wonderful to the flavor. We loved them.

We don't like anchovies so we skipped the anchovy paste and it was delicious.

This recipe is simple, delicious, and versatile. Small servings can be a first course, or larger ones a main course for a luncheon or a light supper, accompanied by a cold soup or salad. I've made it twice, and plan to make it a summer stand-by.
