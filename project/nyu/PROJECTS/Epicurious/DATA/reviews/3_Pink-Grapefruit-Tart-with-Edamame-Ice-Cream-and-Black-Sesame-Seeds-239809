That offsets the twit that reviewed it twice.

Also, the pastry dough tasted a lot like Hamentaschen dough. And the marmalade was a bit sweet--next time I would use less sugar.

This was a HUGE hit. It was very attractive and not too heavy. I would recommend making the recipe in larger quantities. It takes a lot of work to make that dough, and then to only come out with six small tarts is really not worth it.

This recipe is high effort, but it was a big hit. The grapefruit never dried in the oven, although it still tasted great. Next time I will try using paper towels to get as much moisture out as possible.
