These turned out pretty good, but not fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly this time, but in the future, I would definitely follow other reviewers in using coconut milk instead of the shredded coconut. The shredded coconut really ruins the smooth texture that you want in a flan. I also agree that the rum flavor was too overpowering. The flans did not hold up when inverted out of the ramekins, I'm thinking that I needed to bake them a little longer than an hour.

Ok, I'm eating this flan for breakfast as I write because I couldn't wait until later today to have it again! I thought this was truly delicious! I used unsweetened coconut instead of sweetened and it was still plenty sweet and tasty. It did float to the top of the custard, but I didn't mind. I might have used a little less rum as well given the cautionary notes from other reviewers, but I think at least a little adds great flavor. I LOVE the blender method of preparation. This is the easiest flan I've ever made. Note: My boyfriend said he prefers his custard to be denser--this was fairly light. Perhaps an extra egg yolk?

Cooked it as one large flan for almost 2 hours. Never came together. Hot coconut mess. Not my first flan either.

I've never made flan before, but this recipe was easy and delicious. After a little research, I adjusted the recipe as follows: * replaced 14 oz. of the whole milk with 14 oz. of coconut milk * left the flaked coconut out of the recipe because I wanted a smooth texture * added 1/2 t. salt, 1/2 t. molasses, 1 t. vanilla and 3 T. gold rum * used 3 whole eggs and 2 egg yolks * toasted large flaked coconut to sprinkle on top after plating. Proceed as the recipe indicates, but be careful when caramelizing the sugar - it took me 3 times! Turn the burner off once it starts to turn golden brown; it will continue cooking for a little longer to achieve the amber color. In small ramekins, they were done within 45 min. Served to a discerning chef to rave reviews - delicious!

This was very yummy!! I made ir for my boyfriend who LOVES flan and my family, everyone enjoyed it but thought there was to much rum. I actually only put in 1 tablespoon, but next time wouldn't use any or just a capfull. Also when I was making the carmel it started looking like it was turning into candy so I stopped cooking it a little short of a dark amber color. When I poured it in the pan I was using it didn't really spread out very well but turned out fine after the water bath. Will be making this again soon!

Only about half of my family likes flan, but those of us that do loved this. My brother said it was the best flan he had ever had. I used 2% milk to try and cut out some fat and it was still fantastic. I can only imagine how good it would be with whole milk.

Instead of using coconut flakes I used coconut milk (13.5 oz can replaced same amount of whole milk) ... coconut flavor was much more intense.

This is a simple, elegant, absolutely delicious dessert. A beautiful creamy flan, I followed the directions exactly and got great results.

I didn't like the texture added by the pieces of coconut (despite blending) and the flavor of the rum was a little overpowering.

I made this recipe for a holiday dinner party. Very simple to make and the flavors are WONDERFUl. I like being able to make a dessert in advance, i toasted some coconut and sprinkled it around the glass plates I used -- a very pretty presentation.
