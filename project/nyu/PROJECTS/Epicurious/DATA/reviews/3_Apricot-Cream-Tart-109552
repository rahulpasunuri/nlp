No problems with the crust. But if you don't eat it right away, the topping seems to almost separate. But it was very good and rich.

This was terrific as written. We are still eating leftovers two days later, so I disagree that the crust gets soggy. The only changes were I made it in a 10 inch, not 9 inch pan, so I added more apricots but left the "cream" the same. I also used an Italian digestif rather than almond liquer.

This tart is actually very good. The name, I'll admit, is deceiving. Not at all creamy. However, the crust is fantastic and the flavor is delightful. I would recommend the recipe, not as is, but with a few changes it would be fantastic. I would personally leave the crust as is, macerate the apricots, and then make a mascarpone cheesecake type of filling with the juice from the fruit. Definitly worth trying and playing around with, for you adventurous types.

I made this to take to someone's home when we were invited for dinner last weekend. My husband thought it was quite good as is, as well as attractive. I thought it was flavorful, but I have some words of caution. The crust is very nice, but by the time we were having dessert, the bottom was a bit soggy. It came out of the oven around 2:00 and were were eating it about six hours later, so I would recommend serving it within a couple of hours. Also, from previous reviewers comments that the filling seemed more like a glaze rather than a cream, my finished product didn't match their experience. As it was being sliced, the host asked if it was a custard filling. I actually would have preferred a more clear, fruity glaze so might do the fruit maceration step and then thicken the sugar/juice/amaretto mixture with some cornstarch and eliminate the eggs, cream and preserves on another occasion. (Actually, the recipe for the Apricot tart with cornmeal crust may be more what I'm searching for.) And my last criticism is that when I tried to remove the bottom of my tart pan to place on a serving plate, the tart started to tear in different places, so I left the tart pan in place to avoid destroying the tart.

Where is the cream? Its more like a glaze. The apricots were good though.

First off, I'll admit that I only used puff pastry, so I can't say anything about the crust as written. Aside from that, I liked this, but felt that the title is sort of wrong - I didn't find it creamy at all. More like a glaze over the apricots. I loved the apricots themselves, and would definitely do them again - maybe over vanilla yogurt or ice cream or sour cream. But I was hoping for a cream under them (which would have been nice with their natural tartness), so I was somewhat disappointed. Still and all, if you don't mind that, this is simple to make and nice.

Very good. I didn't think the filling was too sweet - in fact, some of my apricots were pretty tart so it was a nice contrast. The crust was wonderful. And I thought this was quite easy. I baked the tart shell the day before but it would have been just as easy to assemble all at once given the time needed to macerate the apricots. I highly recommend this tart!

Yummy delicious! I made this for a Sunday night dinner with family and friends and they all loved it. It was very time consuming but well worth the effort. My only complaint is that the crust came out kind of salty so I may cut back a little next time. Otherwise, I would highly recommend making this!

Short on time, I substituted puffed party for the crust and prepared the apricot cream filling according to the recipe. Delicious and so easy to make.
