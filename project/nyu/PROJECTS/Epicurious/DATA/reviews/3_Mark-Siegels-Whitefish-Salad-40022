I halved this recipe and it made a ton. Instead of sour cream I used greek yogurt which tastes almost the same to me and has only a slightly different mouth-feel. I think in this case the mouth-feel of the sour cream would have made the difference between 2 and 3 forks. Unfortunately, I can't remove the rating since I realized that belatedly and already clicked on it! I'll make this again, but only for a holiday. Next time I'll stick with the sour cream.

I changed the amount of sour cream and substituted some whipped cream cheese. All my family raved about this recipe. I have already made it two more times.

Superior to "store bought" and very easy....I substituted reduced fat mayo and sour cream with success.
