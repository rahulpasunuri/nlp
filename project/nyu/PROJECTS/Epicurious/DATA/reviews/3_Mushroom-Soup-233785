After making some changes to the recipe based on my family's taste, I found this to be an extremely delicious and hearty soup. As one of the other cooks did, I used chicken stock in place of the water. I did not strain it at all and did not puree it. The texture of the soup is very nice and we like the larger pieces of mushroom.

This has great mushroom flavor but it tastes like something is missing and the broth is way to thin. I added a rue to try and thicken it up and that helped a bit. I will make the stock again but honestly will be looking for a better recipe with more flavor to use it with.

Nice mushroom flavor. One tip that I got was to take the dried porcini mushrooms and grind them to a fine powder and add them that way to the stock so the flavor is everywhere evenly. Also, I omitted the potatoes because I forgot to buy them, and the soup turned out amazingly well. Intense mushroom flavor - I may omit the potatoes all the time.

I made the recipe for Thanksgiving to use some of the dried porcini I bought in Italy. It was good, but I'm not sure it was worth all the time.

My husband and I make a LOT of soup, and this is one of our favorites! Have a cold glass of Chardonnay with it - heavenly! This will be our Thanksgiving soup this year.

Making this soup is time comsuming, but the recipe yields quite a lot of soup. Though the soup contains few ingredients, I did think it was elegant and flavourful. I would serve this at a dinner party. Simple, and nice!

This recipe is a little time consuming, but well worth the trouble...Instead of all water, I use Vegetable broth for some or all of the water...I think it gives it a better flavor.

To rokloglo from Frankfurt: Porcini are known as Steinpilze in German.

I have not tried the recipe. I just wanted to say that porcini mushrooms would be found in a delicatessen shop, not an average soupermarket. You can find them dried and soak them in warm water before you use them. If you can not get them, perhaps you should just make the soup with any two different types of mushroom.

Never mind my e-mail. It would help if I read the whole recipe from the top to the bottom first!!!! However, I still don't know what porcini mushrooms are. Is there another name for them so that I know what to look for here in Frankfurt?

I can't rate the recipe yet as I have still to make it. What is or what are porcini ???? Can somebody let me know? Thanks in advance. Ro from Frankfurt, Germany

We really liked this soup. It does take some time to make, though it is very easy. The only change we would make next time is to maybe reserve some of the mushrooms prior to puree & add them to the finished soup. Also, if you didn't have Madeira on hand, I think sherry could be substituted. Lovely.
