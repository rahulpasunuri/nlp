I've made this salad many times, it's super easy and really good. The lemon juice is fresh and delicious without being heavy like some of the creamier caesar dressings.

This Caesar rocks! The best I have ever had. Nothing compares...

This recipe was just plain boring. If you don't like a lot of flavor and zest in your caesar, this one is for you.

What's with 1 3/4 cups cheese for 4 servings????Yikes. I made it with way less and it was good. I increased the lemon and added a little worcestershire, dijon and mayo. For the croutons, I sauted some crushed garlic in butter then tossed the bread cubes with it in a ziplok (sort of like shake-n-bake!) then into the oven. YUMMY.

Great Caesar!I halved it for 2 but used extra garlic in the dressing and less parmesan in the salad. I made the croutons by sauteeing 3 garlic cloves in about 2-3 tablespoons olive oil, straining out the garlic, tossing the bread cubes in the garlic flavored oil and then putting them in the oven at 325 for about 12 minutes. Very good!

I love Caesar salad and this recipe. My husband and I make it all the time. Probably too often. The most I vary it is to add a little extra lemon.

I added a little Egg Beaters and a bit of dijon mustard. Have made it with anchovy paste and filets and both are great.

This was very good! I used freshly grated parmesan reggiano and only used 4 smashed anchovy fillets...and of course Ravida olive oil..it gave it deep pepper after bite...excellent. I cut up a grilled filet of chicken from the night before. I will make this again soon.

Very Good and a big hit with everyone I've ever made it for! I have made it a bunch of times but add some worstchier, a dab dijon mustard, a dap of mayo, and usually use anchovy paste instead of anchovies...either is great!

This is very good!!! I make it in the Quisinart, adding Worchestershire, some lemon juice, anchovy paste, Best Foods and the oil through the top last. I also have added Egg Beaters. The Best Foods and Egg Beaters makes it creamier. You can vary this to please yourself and it all works. Just don't leave out the garlic and the anchovy. Yum...

My fiance doesn't consider a meal complete without this version of the Caesar Salad. I suppose I've created a monster! The only substitution I make is anchovy paste for the filets.

This is very close to a recipe I make, except I don't put any anchovies, I add a lot more garlic (a whole head!), Worchester sauce, and a bit more oil. Oh, and a raw egg (or a tablespoon of mayo for the egg phobic lunatics!) It is so good, my mouth is watering here at the computer!

Easy and tasty.

The secret to Caesar salad is to make it fresh and add the dressing right before serving or it gets soggy. I also find that rather than using anchovy fillets which can be messy, I have successfully substituted greek taramasolata, a spread made of fish roe which is available at most greek delis and import stores. Also, you can adjust the amount of garlic to suit, because some people get the whoopsies from 3 cloves! This dish worked great at a party for 25 people, I just made it in batches and tossed it fresh each time.

This isn't "authentic" but it's quick, fresh, and tasty.
