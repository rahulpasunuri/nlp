This salad was delicious! I was surprised at the tastiness of this salad. I used agave syrup for the sweetener and only carrots because I couldn't find any daikon. I also didn't put any cilantro in it and added the scallion to the dressing in the saucepan after I had taken it off the heat, just to soften them a little bit. Tasty!

I made this recipe to accompany Five Spice Roast Chicken and Ma-Po Tofu and it worked together beautifully. The company dinner was a great success. I used the shredding tool of my food processor instead of a mandoline and added a package of Broccoli Slaw--washed and ready to use--that I bought at the market (for a little variety in the salad).

Very good, but be careful about salting the carrots & daikon. They are very salty afterwards; you should wash it under water briefly, then squeeze it to remove all water.
