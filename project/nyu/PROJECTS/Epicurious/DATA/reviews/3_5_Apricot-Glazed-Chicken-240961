I, too, found the chicken flavorless when I peeled the skin off. Surprised, after all that marinating time. I liked the marinade, which apparently didn't penetrate the skin, and may use it on skinless drumsticks, with every thing else identical. So many recipes are too hot spicy for my taste.

This is the perfect recipe to make ahead. I put it in the marinade for two days. As others mentioned, you should cut way back on the soy sauce. I didn't read the reviews ahead of time so I ended up adding extra apricot jam. I also added honey and siracha. The glaze worked out well.

Every time I cook this recipe it gets better. At first I tried making it with wing dings instead of drumsticks. I made it again last night and it was better than the last time. I realized that pouring enough of the marinade to cover the bottom of the pan worked well. Also, basting the drumsticks a few times helped to create the glaze.

Very yummy. I made this for the first time in 2010 but I've yet to make them again. While the flavor was very delicious, they weren't as "glazed" as I thought they would be. The glaze pretty much settled at the bottom of the pan and just slightly coated the meat because it was more liquid than glaze. However, I plan on making them again soon with the hopes I can get even just a tiny layer of glaze to stay on the chicken (maybe I'll reserve some of the marinade before adding it to the raw chicken to brush it while cooking in the oven).

Delicious and easy, a huge hit. I couldn't decide whether to go with the apricot or marmalade, and lucked out: I found an apricot-orange marmalade. It gave the chicken a great flavor.

Just delicious. I followed the recipe exactly marinating 24 hours but used a mixture of chicken drumsticks and thighs. Next time I will make it in the slow cooker as others mentioned and add breast pieces and make it skinless. It was really on the rich side and as we don't eat the skin, it will cut back on the fat content.

I am giving this recipe four stars because in the end it tasted amazing, HOWEVER, there comes a point when you are baking that it looks like it's not going to work and looks nothing like the picture. KEEP BAKING until the juices thicken at the bottom of the pan and turns into a thick sauce and the chicken looks crispy and black in parts. When it is done, you spoon the sauce over the chicken and alas, it looks just like the picture and tastes great!

Have made this several times. It is a great do a day ahead thing for a busy next day. I use a whole cut up chicken as that is our taste. I cut the breast in to halves and then half again so they cook quickly.

made it yesterday for a crowd of 32 people. everyone loved it just the way it is. we grilled the chicken since it was a nice day. Kids and adults both loved it.

I was shocked by how bland these were considering the flavorful marinade ingredients. Totally underwhelming & disappointing.

Rating: 4
Wow! This was made for three kids, ages 11 to 6, in addition to four adults. Major raves all-around! The great, Asian-infused marinade could be used on breasts, thighs, etc. I do think the trick is the overnight marinating - the longer the better.

This was very good! A nice balance of sweet, sour and savory flavors. Like other reviewers, I thought the one cup = 12 oz was a mistake in the recipe, but, lo and behold, 12 oz of apricot preserves measured at pretty close to one cup. Apparently, the preserves are denser than water! I was afraid the amount of soy sauce called for would add too much salt, but decided to follow the recipe exactly and added the S&P as specified. It turned out just right; not at all too salty. I didn't see the point in lining the roasting pan with foil, however, so omitted the foil. I used a stainless steel pan, and it worked perfectly. I will definitely make this again, but will probably use orange marmalade instead of the apricot preserves, to add a bit more citrus flavor, and might use thighs rather than drumsticks, or a combination, as others have suggested.

OMG!!!!! I must admit however, that I did tweak, partly due to reviewers comments/partly due to ingredients on hand @ the time. I have a peeve about tweaking, & always try to use exact ingredients, but I had some crystalized ginger in the pantry and subbed that for fresh - really don't like the overpowering strength of fresh @ times anyway. I think the crystalized form helped in thickening the marinade as well. I cut down the soy sauce [1/3 cup] via comments & used the whole jar [16oz] of apricot preserves I had on hand. This was a super good, lip smacking, "sticky good we need more napkins", delicious way to make chicken. We paired it with Eating Wells Baked Mac and Cheese of which I used pepperjack cheese. Scrumptious is the exact word and I think it would make a great friends over dish! We couldn't stop commenting to each other while eating it. BTW, I did have marinade left so I saved [refrigerated] it & will use again in a couple days.

Has anyone made this with skinless drumsticks or does the skin need to be on?

Don't like to eat meat off a bone? People, it is the bone that adds most of the flavor to any meat. Puhleeze.

Based on the reviews I will make this using less soy sauce, whole jar of preserves and boneless, skinless thighs. Can't wait to try.

I included this dish in my New Year's dinner, it was a huge success. Regarding the apricot amounts: I think there's a lot of wiggle room on the ingredients here; the store carried one brand, I used the whole jar, problem solved!

I like this recipe quite a bit. I like to add more apricot preserves, extra ginger, and crushed red pepper.

In just "thinking" about making this recipe using Cornish Game Hens for Hanukkah I'm reading the reviews and seeing this debate about 12 oz vs 1 cup of apricot preserves. I don't have a jar in my pantry at the moment but it would appear to me that the jar of preserves is WEIGHED in ounces and the cup is LIQUID measure. Therefore...most likely the 12 ounce jar of preserves when put in the liquid measuring cup equal 1 eight ounce cup.

This got rave reviews, overall a great recipe. Like others, I found the soy overpowering and followed advice adding an extra 1/2 cup of apricot preserve, which brings the total to 12oz anyway. I also added 1/3 cup brown sugar. I did not blend the sauce as my blender decided to give up the ghost that day. However it was still a perfectly good marinade.

Ok.I wrote a review earlier siting that the recipe calls for 1 cup (12 oz) but 12 0z is a cup and a half so I tried the recipe like that to see if this would help where others found this recipe with not enough apricot flavor. My drumsticks came out just ok but the sauce was good.I would say 2 1/2 stars but it was no big deal. I did use the cooked sauce over some asian vegetable though and that was very tasty. I will make this again but I will use a cut of meat off the bone. (maybe that was my problem)

I noticed that the recipe calls for 1 cup apricots preserves (12 ounces) but 12 ounces is a cup and a half and that may be the reason why some people found the soy overpowering. I am going to make it with 12oz and will write a review later

This recipe is a winner! I made it for Rosh Hashanah dinner and used all chicken parts. I used lots of extra fresh ginger, added dried apricots, and substituted orange marmalade instead of the apricot preserves (they didn't add anything first time I made it)and I got rave reviews. Cook it in all the marinade and its great over brown rice along side it.

This chicken is great. I make double batches of it and throw it in the freezer for an easy dinner, or for having company after work. Just take it (marinade and all) out of the freezer the night before, flip it in the morning and then cook when you get home.

Rating: 3
Good, but I agree with the reviewers who said they couldn't taste the apricot much. I expected "stickier" results, more of a glaze, but something wasn't right because the marinade was too watery to get a good sticky glaze. Next time, I'll try cherry preserves as it has more of a bite than apricot, or find a better more flavorful apricot than Smuckers. I'll also make sure to pat the chicken down with paper towels first because I think that might have been the problem with the excess moisture.

fantastic! i marinated overnight, used organic chicken and all-fruit preserves, cooked a little longer than the recipe said (perhaps because the drumsticks were big) and poured the marinade over the chicken in the pan. fantastic!

My family, especially my kids, love this recipe! I substituted onions for shallots because it was what I had on hand, and used boneless skinless chicken. Also, I did not sauté or purée anything. I just mixed the ingredients, placed them in a container with the chicken, let the whole lot sit over night turning the chicken occasionally, baked, then served sliced over brown rice topped with sauce. It was super easy! A great work night meal.

What a waste of time and ingredients. Don't bother with this recipe. There are many other better recipes on this site which produce better flavors. You will not taste any apricot, ginger or anything else besides soy with this one. What a disappointment.

chicken came out nice and moist, made it with legs for me, and boneless breasts for the hubby who doesn't like meat on the bone... will make again- the marinade would also be great on grilled fish, ribs, wings, etc. worth using shallots, and i used a little bit more ginger than called for.

I dislike eating meat on the bone, so I made this with chicken breasts. I was trying to be careful, but I overcooked a bit. Great marinade, though.

This was the best. I thought that it would be "too kid friendly" but I was wrong. I bought organic drumsticks and marinated the chicken overnight. The meat fell off the bone and it got over the top reviews. Everyone wanted the recipe. You will love it, and it's so simple too. It's our new best recipe.

I began my day by thinking how much I didn't want chicken for dinner, but since it was already what I had planned I picked some up anyway. I made this recipe almost as written, except for using a less sodium soy sauce for a guest who has high blood pressure. Oh, and I used a mixture of drumsticks and thighs. The combination was a little more substantial for guests. I forgot about the overnight marinade and only ended up letting it sit for two hours. I was a little nervous about my changes as well as the high cooking temperature, but WOW! This is one of the best chicken recipes I've ever come across--and my guests and hungry doorman agreed! It turned out exactly like the picture--parts of the bird slightly charred, and all of it with a deep, rich flavor. It reminded me of really good chinese food, so I served it with some steamed-to-crisp broccoli florets. I have guests again next week and I'm planning on making this for them.

I made this tonight as well and thought it was wonderful. The meat was fall off the bones tender and the glaze was yummy. I agree that it was hard to taste the apricot, but it sure was good. I did drumsticks and also cut up a whole chicken and it definitely did best with the drumsticks - did a better job of permeating the meat. Oh, which I only marinated for 4 hours, not overnight, but it was okay.

Chicken comes out very moist, but the glaze didn't have as much flavor as I expected. If I were to make it again, I would probably use less soy sauce and more preserves.
