I really like this salsa, although it had to grow on me. The only change I made was to not simmer the tomatillos in water; I thought it would make them too watery and bland. This salsa is very different from almost any salsa I have tried. The guajillos give it a bit of bitterness and the tomatillos balance that with their sweet tanginess. It is a good recipe. I don't think it would be everyone's bag of tea, but I like it. It was pretty easy to make, as well. Try it! It is out of the ordinary! :)
