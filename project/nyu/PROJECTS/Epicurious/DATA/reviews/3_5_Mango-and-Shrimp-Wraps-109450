I reviewed this recipe three years ago, and I have to say it has stood the test of time. A favourite school lunch (as predicted). I tried the peach yoghurt idea (skipped the mayo), and that proved very popular. I've changed the herbs depending on what I have (I'm famous for killing my basil plants, but the cilantro does okay). I've also found this to work well with leftover pork or chicken instead of shrimp.

The shrimp and mango is an excellent combination, and the watercress added a tasty bite.

I love this recipe! The only changes I made were: I used fresh spinach instead of watercress and I didn't add the mango to the recipe right away. Instead I sprinkled the mango inside before rolling the wraps. It keeps any leftovers from becoming watery from the mango.

Tripled this recipe and used 5 lbs of shrimp. Didn't change a thing and it got rave reviews. A keeper

I can never find watercress, so I had to omit it. I'm not sure what happened but the filling ended up very runny. As a result it did not want to stay in the tortilla. Nobody seemed to care, they were content to eat the filling out of the bowl with a spoon. The shrimp and the mango complemented one another beautifully.

Very easy and very good. I used cilantro, mint, chives and pineapple sage in the dressing. Skipped the watercress. I also used sun-dried tomato and basil tortilla wraps.

Yum! Loved them, very easy and flavorful. Didn't use the watercress, just fresh cilantro and mint, otherwise followed as written - definetely a keeper!

Absolutely fantastic. I agree that it didn't need as much dressing, but I like the ease of having it already mixed in. One of the best sandwiches I have ever had.

This was fantastic! If you are watching your fat intake (like I am), I recommend to do not mix the mango and the dressing, but assemble them separately in the tortilla. I did this and noticed that with very little dressing I could still get amazing flavor, without skimming on healthy mango. It took me longer to prepare than stated, but it may be because I am such a perfectionist and my mango cubes had to be perfect :) Also, I steamed the shrimp (easier for me) and then squeezed a little bit of lemon juice on top. Will definetely make this again and again!!!

I love this recipe, instead of mayo (don't like the taste), I used a peach yogurt container with fruit at the bottome, leaving the fruit out and just using the yogurt itelf

No one seems to have mentioned that this is a great kids' meal. My three-year old is crazy about mangoes and shrimp, and doesn't seem to mind the green stuff (I use spinach instead of cress) as long as it's chopped up and mixed in with the sour cream. Better yet, with pre-cooked shrimp, it can be made in minutes. This would probably make a fun school lunch, too.

I made half with shrimp left from shrimp in cilantro sauce, drained, and half with Tyson's grilled chicken strips, the smaller pieces. I also used fresh spinach for the green. Both versions were tasty.

I sauteed the shrimp for more flavor. Very tasty and easy

These were easy to make and extremely tasty. I think they would be wonderful appetizers (rolled and cut in smaller portions) since they are served at room temperature.

It was delicious and will definitely make it again. Next time I will add a little hot sauce for an extra kick. I did not have basil so I used dill and it worked really well. A little messy to eat but the color is fabulous.

Very light and fresh. The most important thing is to make sure the shrimp don't cook more than they should. Also, I spread the chive-basil mixture onto the tortilla, then laid the watercress down, then topped with mango and shrimp pieces. It seemed to not intermingle the flavors too much that way, so the shrimp didn't get subverted.

Made these for lunch on Christmas Eve. Very tasty and impressive looking! Even the kids liked them!

Great party appetizer. It can be made the day before. Everyone loved them

The local grocers only sell flour tortillas with hydrogenated fats, so I had to use corn tortillas. They were not flexible enough to be true wraps, but the flavor was fine.

Absolutely delicious...everyone loved the wraps. Next time I may try wrapping them in rice paper to make them like spring rolls.

im allergic to shrimp and my girlfriend is allergic to mangos so we made it with tilapia and peaches and it was absolutely delicious, we loved it and would definitely recommend making mango and shrimp wraps again

This was delightfully refreshing for a summer meal. My husband is allergic to mangos, so I used avocados we were very happy with the results. As others have mentioned, this recipe is quite adaptable to variations.

Gorgeous blend of flavors. Made this a few times, once for a picnic. Make a crunchy savory salad to offer a complementary flavor. Easy to transport filling in one container, watercress/greens in ziploc and then the wraps. Assemble on-site while enjoying wine and the jealous looks of passers-by. Not a bad idea to follow with chocolate-covered strawberries.

What a great way to use l/o shrimp!! I also replaced the watercress with cilantro and mint - wonderful combination.

These were just fantastic. I love any dish that does the sweet/salty/savory balance well, and this certainly does. I love cilantro, so I substituted that for the basil and it was so delicious and really beautiful as well. Next time I'll try it with yogurt to make it a little less of an indulgence...very good!

I made these for my very first paying catering gig and they were a huge success. Instead of just watercress, I mixed in a little cilantro and fresh sprigs of mint from our garden. Great, non-pretentious yet beautiful food. Recommended...

After reading other reviews I cooked the shrimp in old bay seasoning and used nonfat yogurt. Very tasty!

I grilled the shrimp with lemon, butter and pepper, which added some nice flavor. However, I think next time, I'll add some cajun seasoning or some sort of chili powder to the shrimp to add a spicy kick and counterbalance the sweetness of the dish.

This recipe is fast & great for summer. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream. I also used thawed, frozen mango. Using cooked shrimp would make this even easier.

This was very easy to make and nothing was lost by using low fat mayo and sour cream. I also used smaller tortillas to make tacos (vs. wraps). The watercress is a moderate pain and I would use cilantro next time. I added diced jalepeno to the "dressing" when I added the mango and shrimp for a slight kick. Try it! (Ever wonder what kind of sedatives L. Bush is on to maintain that ever so beatific visage?!?)

Very easy and satifying. I am planning to share this recipe with friends, family and neighbors.

I made this as a salad, served over lettuce, without the wrap, but will use the wrap next time for a luncheon. Also used already cooked shrimp that I had on hand. Did not have basil on hand but used coriander (cilantro). Very yummy flavors that work well together

I had to try this recipe as soon as I got home. I made it as written and loved it. The blend of flavors is wonderful. It's a perfect light, yet rich recipe that will be perfect for a summer meal.

I printed the recipe yesterday, made it last night for dinner and my husband and I loved it. We just chopped the herbs (used a little cilantro) and mixed with the sour cream and mayo instead of blending or processing. We didn't use the watercress and we lightly (30 seconds) fried the 10" flour tortillas and folded them over. Wonderfully light and the flavors blend so well.

I'm in a constant search for delicious, interesting as well as nutritious sea-oriented recipes. This fits with those essential needs quite well!

This recipe was quick to make and good. I used already cooked shrimp (41-50 count), chopped them up, and I used small amount of lime instead of lemon. I will add more lime next time but it turned out very good. I am having a wrap party and will make these for my party.

Thank you other readers. This combination of ingredients seems quite strange....especially all the mayo with tortillas and mango. I couldn't deal with it.

I had high hopes for this recipe. Each ingredient is flavorful on its own, but combined in this recipe, the essence of the shrimp and mango fall flat.

This was not very good as it's written. After trying it as written and throwing most of it in the trash, we made the following changes with good results: replaced basil and chives with cilantro and a tiny bit of habanero, replaced shrimp with chicken, replaced the watercress with spinach (only because the watercress at the store looked as if it had seen better days), and added red bell pepper and green onion. In other words, the only things we kept were the mango, tortilla, sour cream, and mayo. I guess the only good thing I can say is that it inspired us to make a better sandwich.
