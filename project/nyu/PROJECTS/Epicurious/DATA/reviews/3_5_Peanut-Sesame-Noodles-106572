Delicious and easy. I like to use asian noodles, especially the buckwheat ones. I've made this twice in a week.

The flavor of the dressing was just what I was looking for! It was easy and delicious. I used rice vinegar and added carrots and tofu. Next time I think I'll add some chili paste and more veggies. It did all get a bit mushy pretty fast and the dressing was a bit thick, so next time I might try using a little more water and not dressing all of the pasta at once unless we're eating it all at once.

My husband and I loved this! It will definitely enter our monthly rotation. I'm always happy to find an easy and healthy recipe. I used organic peanut butter, so the texture was a little thick/gummy, but still great. Next time I will triple the amount of red and yellow peppers, and double the amount of ginger.

the peanut dressing for this recipe was amazing. I want to bathe in it. I added some broccoli and mushrooms, yum!

Rating: 4
Very easy and good. I had made a different version years ago but misplaced that recipe and I think I prefer this one anyway. I made the dressing ahead and let it sit in the blender for a couple of hours, which did not affect the results. I cooked the noodles as directed, rinsed them and chilled them a bit before combining with the dressing at serving time. I had no red wine vinegar so I used white wine vinegar. I also used Asian noodles and tossed in a few peanuts right before serving when it said to add scallions, peppers & sesame seeds.

I haven't had sesame noodles in ages and thought this was delicious. My 15 year old loved it! After reading some reviews, I decreased the water a little bit and increased the honey a little bit. I made a pound of whole wheat linguine but did not add all the dressing. I will definitely make it again.

This is AWESOME!!! I didn't have fresh ginger and used 1/4 tsp ground ginger and couldn't really taste...but it wasn't that spicy at all, as a previous reviewer said. I used red pepper and it had the perfect level of spicy and I am very sensitive to spicy. It just had enough of a kick. I didn't have scallions, or peppers in the house. I sauted cut up chicken with 1/2 onion, steamed some broccoli and tossed it all with buckwheat soba noodles and the sauce. YUM!!! Oh and I also used almond butter instead of peanut butter. I just wish it wasn't so high in calories/fat....but so so good! Can't wait to make it for my husband!

I like that this is made in the blender. The peanut butter flavor I love just was not there for me, though. I think that less soy sauce and vinegar would improve the flavor.

very yummy! i added purple cabbage (sliced) and next time might add some cubed tofu too. i used some braggs amino acids instead of part of the soy sauce and a splash of sriracha sauce instead of the red pepper flakes. didn't have red wine vinegar so used white wine vinegar and didn't have sesame seeds or any ginger but it was still good! my husband and 3 year old daughter devoured it.

We really enjoyed this and love the flexibility of the recipe. Using whole wheat noodles, rice wine vinegar, and peanut oil (that's what we had) worked fine. Also added a handful of cilantro and steamed broccoli. What's not to love...fresh ginger and garlic?! Mm-mmm!

I took someone's recommendation added broccoli - tastes great and super easy!

excellent for an easy, no frills meal Changes: - added 2 shredded carrots - added two peeled and chopped cucumbers - added several handful of chopped baby spinach - added a good pinch of salt, because soy was low sodium, and peanut butter was unsalted - used more scallions and fresh ground pepper - used asian chili-garlic paste from jar instead of garlic - used 1 t. of ground ginger instead of fresh

This is DE-lish! I increased the chili a tiny bit. I didn't have the honey, so I'm sure it dropped the sweetness a little, but no matter. This is a keeper.

If you don't want to run to the store for fresh ginger and decide to use ground ginger, it will be too spicy. Use one tablespoon ground ginger, and half the red pepper flakes. Otherwise, easy and a welcome change from marinara sauce!

I was really disappointed in this. No complexity of flavor at all - just tasted like melted peanut butter. I did use natural peanut butter, which I'm sure was part of the problem, but still, I couldn't salvage this. Won't be making this again.

this recipe is great, super fast, and super easy. probably a good one to make with kids. i substituted agave for honey, and used chinese noodles instead of spaghetti, which was extra tasty. i also substituted powdered ginger, just use about 1 teaspoon.

Delicious - a nice, late heat that is wonderfully offset by the creaminess of the peanut butter. I substituted rice wine vinegar, which worked well. I also lightly sauteed some mushrooms and threw in the diced bell peppers at the end of the sautee process to take a bit of the bite out of the peppers. Great dish to make for lunch leftovers.

i thought it was pretty darn good, i made it in about 15 minutes. Next time I'll probably add more veggies, I only had a bell pepper and carrot on hand... but I thought the sauce was delicious! (Oh I used broth instead of water too)

Rating: 0
So I basically eyeballed the recipe using the existing recipe as my guideline for ratios. Didn't have any honey so used turbinado sugar; used rice wine vinegar in place of the red wine variety. Added a dash of rice wine and was fine without broth replacing water.Used chili and garlic sauce for a taste of heat with garlic. Maybe I'll try the broth next time. Found myself with a sauce that was not overly sweet or peanuty; just nicely balanced. Like others added sliced cucumbers, julienned carrots and fresh spinach for a complete meal. Children love this dish as well as adults.

Rating: 1
Unfortunately, the dressing was too heavy with peanut butter for me. Tasted just like a mild slightly savory peanut butter sauce. Not enough kick or complexity of flavor--this is even after I upped the garlic to three cloves and more red pepper. I used homemade chicken stock instead of water as another review mentioned which was a good addition. I believe reducing the peanut butter by half, which comes closer to the ratio of other peanut sesame recipes I've looked at, will help next time. But that means I'm pretty much following a different recipe.

Rating: 4
Easy recipe--I took the advice of other reviewers and used broth instead of water; I added sliced cucumbers, snap peas and cilantro. I loved this--it was nutty and smooth, spicy from the red pepper flakes and just slightly sweet, and the sauce was not as thick as I expected it to be, so it coated the noodles lightly. We had a friend over for dinner and he pronounced them the best sesame noodles he'd ever had.

Rating: 3
This recipe works for me as well. I make it easy for myself by combining the sauce ingredients in a large metal bowl with a large whisk. I'm willing to mince the ginger and garlic by hand, so this method saves food processor cleanup.

I have been a fan of this dish for years, but wanted to find an easy version recipe. This is it. However, I modified the sauce to better result. I used chicken broth instead of water; rice wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar; used 3 cloves of garlic instead of one; omitted sesame oil, and used 3/4 cup PB instead of 1/2. Also added 1 12 ounce bag of frozen broccoli to the pasta and water for the last 3 minutes of cooking time. I omitted the sesame seeds and peppers, and added some leftover cooked baby carrots and scallions to the final dish. Ate it hot. FABULOUS!!! Next time I am going to sub garlic chili sauce for the honey, garlic and hot red pepper flakes....

These noodles are delicious and easy. I would make some changes next time, however. I would use a full lb. of pasta instead of the 3/4 lb. called for because I thought there was tway oo much sauce for the amount of noodles in the recipe as written. It was over the top. I would also drain the pasta and add it to the sauce while still warm instead of rinsing it with cold water, which made the noodles watery. I think this would also allow the noodles to absorb more of the sauce. (I would serve it at room temp or chill in the fridge.) Finally, I would add more veggies and some protein, like shrimp or chicken.

I made this for my two step kids (6 and 5) who have never eaten a veggie before. I doubled the peanut butter and honey and left the veggies and red pepper out of the mix. I tossed the very thick sauce with penne, the only noodle they eat. While I don't think an adult could eat a whole bowl without gagging, they loved it. I would make it again for picky eaters.

This recipe is quick and delicious.

This turned out great! I've used other recipes similar to this, but I have to see I really like the thickness of the sauce. I used ground ginger and increased the soy sauce by 2 tablespoons. I like my food spicy, so I added more red pepper flakes and used rice vinegar with a dash of Port since I didn't have red-wine vinegar. I garnished with green oninons, julienne cucumbers, and the rest the recipe calls for.

I had to change so much but this was a good basis for a ROCKIN' seasame noodle recipe.

Yum! I've been craving good sesame noodles since I left NYC 4 years ago. I'll definitely make these again. At other cooks' suggestions I added carrots and blanched the bell pepper. Also, left out red pepper flakes since I didn't want it too spicy and it was still delicious.

This is now a staple in my culinary assault. My suggestion to jump it up is to use seasame chili oil, and warm black tea instead of water. Green peppers work very well for a less subdued flavor and carrots are a MUST.

The flavour here was really good, but I think it would be better warm. Next time I'm going to blanch or steam the veggies and not cool the noodles. I used soba noodles, red bell pepper, and carrots that I used a peeler to cut into ribbons. Really good combo.

This really didn't WOW me at all! I felt it was lacking something. I used rice vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar, but it was really still kind of bland. I then added some cilantro which helped, but there are other recipes which were much better in my opinion i.e. Thai Noodle Salad.

We loved this dish (and guess what? I LOATHE peanuts and peanut butter!) I have made it several times, changing the vegetables and adding different meats each time with smashing results on each attempt. We tried substituting rice noodles for the pasta; won't make that mistake again; the sauce is a little too heavy for the delicate noodles and we ended up with a glop (still tasted good though, just didn't look very good and was hard to toss the sauce and veggies in). Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 3
The reviews are all true - the sauce is absolutely delicious. My only change to it was to increase the crushed red pepper to 1T - so yummy. I also just used one red pepper and added 2 carrots and 1 seedless cucumber julienned with the green onions. This will definitely go into the weeknight rotation.

Rating: 3
At the recommendation of some of the other reviewers, I added poached shredded chicken and julienned carrot and cucumber. I also used multi-grain pasta, which I think stands up well to the peanut sauce, and I doubled the amount of scallion and added some sambal (chili sauce). My inital reaction was that it was still missing something, but I have to admit that I ate a big bowlful and enjoyed every bite! I'm going to play around with the proportions of the ingredients in the sauce - I think maybe more soy sauce or vinegar or both might be in order. I also liked the suggestion of cilantro, I just didn't have any on hand. But even without, it made a tasty summer meal.

Rating: 4
This was a great recipe! I made it a day ahead for a party and it was fine -- not as pretty as it would be had I served it immediately b/c the peanut butter kind of congeals onto the pasta but if you let it sit out and get to room temperature, it is fine. I also decided to skip the peppers and instead added some cilantro. It was quickly gobbled up by my guests and very easy.

I have been searching for the perfect blend of flavors to simulate good Chinese restaurant cold sesame noodles and this is the best I have found yet. Easy to make, I julienne diffent veggies to toss with the noodles and sometimes serve with grilled teryaki chicken. Everyone in my family loves these noodles. YUM.

If I could give this 5 forks I would have...but I did make a few changes. First I am not found of raw garlic so I combined the ingredients for the sauce gave them 30 seconds with the immersion blender and simmered them while I was doing the rest. I also upped the honey to 1/3 cup and used Sushi vinegar and I only threw in about two tablespoons of warm water. This produced a nice thick sauce. I did not add any oil to the sauce it as I sauted match stick carrots, seedless cucumber and broccoli in the oil. I added the cooked pasta to the veggies and then the green onion and cilantro and the sauce. Didn't use the sesame seeds nor the pepper because I didn't have any. My husband loved it....actually licked the pan.

Rating: 3
Gave this 3 forks, though I think the peanut sauce is a definite 4! We will have this again often. Some changes that I made/will make to the noodle salad: I will omit the bell pepper next time as we did not care for it in this recipe; I added cilantro as suggested by other reviewers and some poached chicken and edamame and will continue to do so--all enhanced the dish, we thought. Next time I may include some shredded carrot and maybe a bit of finely chopped napa cabbage to replace the bell pepper's crunch. Obviously, this is the kind of recipe one can tweak to personal tastes. We LOVED this!!!

I'd make it again, and already have! This is a great peanut noodle recipe, and I thought quite easy. I agree with many other reviewers, I've eaten the left overs (which have sat in the fridge a day or two), and it is fine! I almost prefer it to just made. My bro-in-law (who is a food snob), gave this 10 out of 10. Only revision, I cut the red pepper flakes in half, my boyfriend is not a big fan of extremely spicy foods, so just 1 teaspoon was enough. Definitely a nice alternative to "traditional" cold pasta recipes.

This was a bit of work, but really great! I took some suggestions from other reviewers and did the following: used #1 pound of pasta (and there was just enough sauce)..substituted some peeled carrot peelings for the yellow pepper.. chopped the red pepper instead of cutting into strips..added cilantro to the sauce before processing..added another 1t hot red pepper flakes to the dish..used one third C of peanut butter instead of one half.. used rice wine vinegar instead of red wine...yummy!..served it with the chipoltile lime chicken from this website, which was little work.

FIVE FORKS! This was fabulous. At the suggestion of previous reviewers, I reduced peanut butter to 1/3 cup and added chopped fresh cilantro, a slivered carrot and slices of grilled teriyaki chicken to all of the original ingredients to make this more of a main dish. Delightful! FYI -- You can ignore the warning to add dressing at the last minute -- the noodles tasted as great the next day as they did the first day. Maybe even better. This recipe is a real keeper.

I made the sauce directly as written and found it overwhelming in peanut butter. I tweaked it by increasing all of the other liquids. I also used Sriracha to increase the heat.

Made this recipe with noted substitutions others had submitted i.e. seasoned rice vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, H20 1/4C, honey increased to about 1/2 cup, exchanged bell peppers for shredded carrots, increased crushed red peppers tri-fold, and added chopped serranos (we like spicy around here!!)and tossed in chopped cilantro and used chunky PB I had on hand. I made this as a test run for family before quadrupling it for an upcoming party. Family raved! Made it 3 days in advance of party and found it's best served room temp. NOT COLD!! Would be great with chopped leftover steak, shrimp or chick. Great picnic dish, referigeration isn't such a huge concern (w/o meat added). A new signature dish for this foodie!

When I began to make this, I discovered I was out of honey. I substituted about a quarter cup of brown sugar, and it was divine! The fresh ginger is key. I also substituted cayenne pepper for flakes, and I got just the right amount of zing. So easy and delicious! A great summer dish.

This was a delicious, easy recipe, one I will definitely make again. I used soba noodles rather than italian-style pasta, and added julienned carrot and cucumber.

It was great the first day and as leftovers.

I thought this had WAY too much ginger in it - it really over-powered everything else. I would cut the ginger to less than 1/2 what was recommended or maybe leave it out entirely.

A good quick dish with some substitutions; I added quickly stir-fried pieces of pork cutlet and white onion, omitted the bell peppers (didn't have any on hand), and used dried and crystallized ginger (again, what I had to hand).

Fantastic recipe! Fast! Easy! YUMMY. I see what other reviewers mean about licking the bowl. The only thing I changed about the dressing was adding more garlic (about 1tsp = 2 cloves). For the salad, I used Chinese rice noodles (about 6 oz., since that's what was left in the bag), 3 scallions, a handful of slivered carrots, and 1 1/2 Tbsp sesame seeds. I used approximately 3/4 of the dressing on our noodles. The recipe comes together very quickly, and would pair well with a variety of other foods. We had pan-seared tilapia and steamed broccoli. Highly recommended!

This sauce should be illegal...it's way too good for its simplicity!!! I was literally licking the spatula. Made it in the food processor, not blender.

I love this recipe! I used Chinese egg noodles instead of any other type of pasta... Chinese vermicelli is also a great option too!

This is a wonderful recipe though I made quite a few substitutions: I used crunchy peanut butter and find that I works just as well as the creamy kind. I added snow peas and could add carrot, cucumbers etc. I used Tamari instead of soy sauce and rice wine vinegar instead of red wine. The raw garlic was a bit overwhelming though so I will omit that next time. All in all, a great recipe!

Delicious! I substituted some ingredients based on what I had on hand and added a few extras based on personal taste: equal amounts tamari and shoyu for the soy sauce; unseasoned rice vinegar for the red wine vinegar; omitted garlic and sesame seeds; added 2 t lime juice, 1 T ketchup, 1 t thai chili sauce, 1/4 cup coarsely chopped roasted peanuts and a few slices of fried tofu.

This is a great dish to add more veggies to, I added steamed green beans, broccili and baby corn cobs. Not as good as leftovers though, better to eat on the first night. Everyone really liked it.

I read all the reviews and modified it by increasing the honey to 1/3 cup, adding a minced jalapeno and chopped water chestnuts. I also changed the vinegar to rice wine vinegar. It seemed wrong to use red wine vinegar in an asian dish! To zip it up a little I would make more dressing next time and probably add more vinegar and ginger.

i served these noodles at a baby shower along with the chicken salad with walnuts and grapes from epicurious .com, and everyone couldn't get enough of them! i even e-mailed the recipe to a few of my guests!!if you are feeling extra spicy i added a jalapeno to the peanut sauce and it was delicious. i also added bean sprouts on top along with thin slices of english cucumber the way they serve them in nyc chinese rst.'s i will make this recipe for many meals to come!!!

I made this for a neighborhood cookout - and am now passing the recipe out to all who attended! I used more scallions and hot peppers than the recipe called for - I htink next time I would use only the one teaspoon of hot pepper flakes - I think I'll also use the full pound of pasta, since there seemed to be enough dressing to cover a full pound. I also saved some of the toasted sesame seeds to sprinkle on top - which looked super. Great recipe - very easy to make.

This was a fun, easy, and delicious recipe! I topped it off with some crushed peanuts. It's great as a cold dish, so make extra for leftovers! I will definitely make it again

Despite following most of the prior suggestions (I used half and half peanut butter and sesame tahini, subbed red pepper rice vinegar for the red wine vinegar, used more honey, used ramen noodles, and added carrots and broccoli), it's just not outstanding. I still didn't get that sweet/hot thing that previous reviewers mentioned (in fact, it wasn't very hot at all, even with the pepper vinegar!), and it was a bit overpowering in the peanut flavor. I'll keep looking for a better noodle salad recipe.

This dish was easy to prepare and very tasty! I cooked the spaghetti first, cut it with kitchen shears into smaller threads (about 4 inches in length, which makes tossing easier), then sealed the noodles in a Ziploc bag and kept them in the fridge until it was time to put everything together. * For the dressing, I followed the advice of the cook from San Diego regarding the amount of honey, but used 1/3c, thinking 1/2 c might be too much. I didn't have any fresh ginger, so I diced up some candied ginger as a substitute; that worked nicely. You can even use [Kikkoman] "lite" soy sauce without sacrificing flavor. * I liked the advice of the cooks who used bean sprouts: what a great texture to add! If you use canned sprouts, here's a tip I learned in a cooking class: drain the sprouts, then soak for ten minutes in ice water...drain again...now they'll have no "can taste." I also added carrot strips and lightly steamed (2 min - no more) broccoli florets. * Each of the three parts to this recipe - sauce, noodles, and veggies, can be prepared ahead of time, making those final minutes before dinner a breeze; just toss and serve! This dish is so good that I'm sure I'll make it often.

This tasted "restaurant good" when I made it--a big success. The trick is to use about 1/2 cup of honey instead of two teaspoons. This gives it that sweet Thai flavor that restaurant versions often boast. I also recommend adding snow peas, bean sprouts and crushed, roasted peanuts for the topping instead of the bell peppers. They work with the flavors better. From a practical standpoint, this recipe works well for busy cooks: make the sauce in the blender ahead of time and combine with the noodles just before you're ready to eat.

I wasn't going to make this recipe at first because of the ratings, but when I saw the reference to Chin Chins I knew I had to try it! I used only 4 tsp of water, added 1/2 a carrot (sliced 1/8" thin strips), 3 shredded chicken breasts, bean sprouts, and only used 1 bell pepper. Delicious! I will be making this much more in the future! Also, I slowly added the noodles at the end to see how much I wanted so there would be enough sauce on it. I ended up using a little less than the 3/4 lb. it asked for. I also prefer this dish cold! :)

This is one of the dishes i remember fondly from childhood. for a traditional, spicy "dan dan mien," try using sesame paste rather than peanut butter. or a mixture of both. some add ground pork - a matter of preference. it's a flexible recipe. I'm used to eating it at room temperature, or cold. also, despite being a big fan of chunky vs. smooth peanut butter, for this particular dish, i'd recomment smooth... but a sprinkling of crushed fresh peanuts and toasted sesame seeds on top might be nice. the scallions provide a refreshing crunch - don't leave them out! oh! and one last thing... try this sauce over ramen noodles!

Made this for a potluck at my daughter's high school. It worked well as a "make-ahead" recipe. I didn't use sesame seeds (since I had forgotten to get them), and I stirred the scallions in at the last minute so they would look fresh. The kids gobbled it up, and it was enjoyed by carnivores, vegetarians, and vegans.

I haven't tried this recipe but I saw this similiar recipe made on a cooking show and the chef added toasted sesame seeds to the noodles. I am going to try this also. Will let you know. She did not add any water and also used peanut sesame oil. Opps! Sorry saw the sesame seeds after. I apologize.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I saute the scallions and red pepper in a little sesame oil with some shrimp. And instead of linguine I use Asian ramen noodles.

This tastes almost as good as my favorite peanut noodles from Chin Chin. Next time, I will omit the water (agree that it's way too thin), and add some cornstarch to the sauce after blending to thicken and help it stick to the noodles. May also try with crunchy peanut butter or add some peanuts for more texture.

Outstanding -- this dish really hit the spot, perhaps better than what I've had in good Chinese restaurants. I added just a touch of water (about 1/8 cup) and got an excellent consistency; I'll also offer two other suggestions. First, use only 1 bell pepper, not two, and chop them instead of slicing them (otherwise, they're too big). Second, use about half as many scallions as are suggested -- 4 is way more than you need. This was one of the best Epicurious dishes I've made.

I think this dish would benefit from substituting rice vinegar for the red wine vinegar called for in the recipe.

Unfortunately, I followed some other's suggestions of omitting the water. While this recipe was tasty, I did find that the peanut sauce was too thick and rich for me and made my stomach a little uneasy. In true asian recipes, the sauce is a little thinner. Adding extra chili made it scrumptious, though, and I would make it again...with some alterations.

I happened to be making teriyaki salmon with scallions and needed a side dish. Because I had leftover linguini in the fridge, I decided to wing this. Didn't use the water and didn't measure the ingredients. I added fresh cilantro and shredded carrots. Easy to make and delicious to eat.

Followed other suggestions and didn't add water with great results. Didn't have bell peppers but did have shredded pork (from a carnitas recipe), frozen snow peas, and shredded carrots. Big hit!

Didn't have any trouble with the amount of water, maybe because I used a full pound of noodles instead of 3/4 lb. However, mine wasn't hot at all and I put in extra ginger. Flavor was very good. Very easy dish to make.

This has become an absolute mainstay for us. Double the heat if you're inclined, and I agree with the suggestion of reducing the water. Every time I make it, we inhale it. It's a decent guest dish too; it looks good and everyone seems to love the flavors. It actually works well for a potluck to blend the sauce in advance and heat up the noodles once you get there.

Definitely a keeper! Everyone that I have made this for has loved it. I also add honey roasted peanuts (and occasionally some soy sauce-marinated, stir-fried tofu cubes). Personally, I don't like the flavor of ginger, so I leave it out & it is still excellent.

I made this dish for an office potluck lunch. I made it a night before and the heat from the ginger got intensfied over night. I thought it was too hot and spicy but the people loved it.

i thought this dish was a little too runny and had too much peanut butter. it was okay, but i've had better in your other issues.

everyone i have made this for, including myself, fell in love instantly. i used a whole pound of pasta and had a perfect amount of sauce. the best part is, any of the ingredients can be altered to create a desired taste. it's definitely a keeper.

Maybe even a 3.5, but I did adjust the dish a bit. I made the sauce according to the recipe, and it was delicious--although a bit spicy (I may have added a bit too much crushed red pepper!). I served it over stir-fried veggies as well as some chinese noodles. It would also be good with chicken. It's a tasy and easy peanut sauce recipe.

This got really mixed reviews in my house. Ironically, my two children didn't like it at all, for the most part because they felt the combination of peanut butter and pasta just didn't work. My husband gobbled it up, but he'd eat pasta with just about anything, every meal of his life, if he could. I thought it was just so-so, and was disappointed by what to me was a somewhat gluey texture. We pitched the leftovers.

Everyone liked the pasta and it was very easy to prepare. Next time I make it, however, I won't add the 1/3 cup of water called for in the recipe as I thought the sauce was too runny.

Very good, very easy! My toddlers loved them! A great accompaniment to grilled meat!
