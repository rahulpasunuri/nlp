So, these were almost perfect. My only complaint would be that the oils from the peppers made them a bit too intense. Does anyone have a suggestion on how to tame that spiciness?

Best tool for deveining? The tip of most vegetable peelers. Baking did make the breading nice & crisp, but I needed 45 minutes @ 350 F. It left the poppers a bit dry, so I'll fry them next time to see the difference. It remains a great foundation recipe; the double breading is a key technique.

I made this recipe twice. The first time exactly as written, the second time with some modifications. The modifications were a definite improvement. The first change I made was to take other reviewers suggestions and add some cream cheese. I added 4oz cream cheese to 6 oz sharp cheddar. Not only did this taste great, but the cream cheese helped the jalapeños stay closed after they were stuffed, making the breading process easier. The second modification I made was to bake the poppers instead of frying them. They came out perfect and crunchy. I sprayed a non-stick baking sheet with pam and then sprayed the poppers lightly with Pam before putting them in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. I really can't recommend the baking method enough. I avoided the greasy mess and they were delicious.

These are excellent. My suggestion to make deseeding and deveining the peppers easier is to use a grapefruit spoon instead of a paring knife and kitchen shears. The thin, serrated point of a grapefruit spoon is ideal for scraping the inside of a chile!

Definitely tasty. Switched up the cheese filling a bit - some blue cheese dressing and cream cheese with cheddar and monteray jack. I tried using panko at first, and could not get the coating to stick at all. I happened to have regular breadcrumbs on hand, and they worked beautifully. I tried to travel with these, then reheat in an oven. I do not recommend, they lose the crunch and freshness.

This is really good despite the "heat" I'm fond of frozen JPs that's why I made this. The fresh ones are definitely better.

I made these last night thought they were pretty good, but I had a really hard time getting the breadcrumbs to stick. I used panko (because that's what I had on hand) but don't think that would have been my problem. Did other people have this problem? I'd love any tips, because I'm curious to try these out a second time!

I've substituted Velveeta, sprinkled with taco seasoning inside the cleaned out jalapeno pepper half. Follow the rest of the recipe for coating and cooking. Use sour cream and salsa or pico de gallo as a dip. Nice..........

Has anyone tried freezing these? Don't know if I should try freezing them before frying, then thaw before frying, or just cook and freeze them when cool. Any suggestions appreciated.

The double batter did help to keep the cheese in when cooking. I took another reviewers suggestion and added cream cheese and ranch dressing to my shredded cheddar. These were very good and a great basic recipe for my next attempts. I think you can play around with it a bit with different cheeses and I'm going to keep my eye out for the japanese bread crumbs. I haven't found them in the stores yet but I'm curious about how they can make a difference.

use japanese panko breading and you will be amazed at the difference

Make sure to use gloves! I didn't and my hands were burning for the rest of the night.

Following in my constant habit of never making a recipe exactly as written I used my instincts and ingredients on hand. My cheese filling was a blend of mozz, parm (both leftover from lasgana making last weekend) cheddar and cream cheese. I added a dash of Frank's Red Hot and about 1.5 tbsp of ranch dressing to get rid of a near empty bottle in the fridge. The filling was super delicious and I will make it the exact same way next time. However, I agree with the other viewers that the cooking time & temp did not pair well. Next time I will drop the temp by 100 degrees and cook them for the same amount of time at 225. Cooking at 325 for shorter time just left the peppers uncooked and too much on the spicy side. We love jalapenos and enjoy them right off the plant out back, but they definitely need time to cook slowly and thoroughly in this recipe. I will also give my hands a rinse halfway through the breading process as the egg & breadcrumb clumped up on the last few because my fingers were so caked. That extra breading made the coating too thick for our tastes. With that said, I plan to make them again this week with the basket full of peppers we picked before the frost.

I used to make my own poppers, but will trade them for this recipe! I had read the previous cook's comment about having a hard time getting the breadcrumbs to stick, so I used the usual "chile rellenos" technique for making the bread crumbs stick: sift some ordinary flour over the filled chiles, turning them once so that they will be coated with the flour (make sure you do this over a large dish,otherwise flour will go everywhere!). Beat an egg with a tbsp of water and dip the chiles one by one and then roll them in the cheese-bread mixture. Also, I used mozarella chunks as, on my first try, I had a hard time keeping the cheese-salsa mixture inside the chiles. I use fresh home-made salsa (not chunky) as a dip for the chiles.

I just made these and had a very hard time getting my breadcrumbs to stick. Any ideas?

I have been looking for a good recipe to try, I have found it! Instead of Monterey Jack I used Cream Cheese (about 2-2.5 Oz should be enough. I used 3 Oz and have plenty of left over. Also, I only cooked them for about 3 Min. in my deep fryer @ 325 degrees. I used fresh peppers out of my garden and with this recipe they still had a little kick while eating them. BUT VERY DELICIOUS! great recipe, Thanks.

made these right away. Had a crowd of well-traveled eaters for dinner, but no one ate more than one. The peppers can be really really hot. A previous reviewers suggestion of sour cream with lime is a good idea. The double breading was fabulous and crunchy - I used a mixture of panko and homemade dried french bread crumbs. All that said, these took a long time to make, but unfortunately were just ok.

This recipe was horrible! Not worth the trouble and pain, my hands burned for hours afterwards. The deep frying time of 5-6 minutes is way off, the breading burns quickly, turns brown in just a minute or two.

I enjoyed these- although next time I would reduce the amount of cheese- 1/2 cup each and increase the amount of hot sauce. And I used italian breadcrumbs because that is what I had on hand-

Good recipie and always a fave at the party but save yourself some trouble and use a sliver of your favorite flavor solid cheese slipped in through the top of the pepper, toothpick the top back in place, bread and fry. no muss no fuss

Good Recipe, Great party poppers

These were pretty good... ...but I prefer to to wrap the cheese (use cream cheese) filled jalapenos with bacon and cook them on the grill. They come out crispy and spicy and sans all that extra breading.

Tasty. Not sure what makes these "haute", as this is pretty much like any other recipe I've seen. Blanch the peppers briefly if you want to reduce some of the raw heat.

Easy and fresh. I think everyone at the party enjoyed them... and seemd disappointed when we ran out.

I also thought they really hot, but that's what I love. I would have liked more cheese in them, but they were pretty much busting full of cheese. I used a mixture of cheddar and queso fresco. I seasoned my breadcrumbs with some chili powder and cumin. They were very tasty!

I was concerned about cheese leaking but I think the double dip takes care of that and we had no trouble. We took out all ribs and seeds and they were still REALLY hot. We served with a bowl of sour cream seasoned with lime juice and salt. A delicious addition that helped tame the heat.

We seldom deep fry but a dozen jalapeno plants had me desperate to use up some peppers. The cleaning and stuffing was simple enough, although I may have left a few seeds. Yielded a crispy coating over a flavorful pepper.
