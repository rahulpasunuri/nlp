The spiderweb decoration is what makes the cake impressive and this can be done on any cake. I would have preferred buttercream icing. Or could have been chocolate icing with a spiderweb piped on with royal icing.

I didn't have any coco powder at home and was running out of time so I subbed low-fat nestle hot chocolate mix. I also couldn't find the rest of my baking pans so made it two layers instead of three. It turned out fabulous, looked really dense and heavy, but tasted light and delicious, totally melted in your mouth. For the meringue frosting I subbed the same hot chocolate mix for the coffee - lots of non-coffee people there - and really didn't give it enough of a whip to set up properly. It turned out surprisingly good though. Tasted like marshmallow whip, and kind of looked like it too. Didn't have time to do the web in chocolate so I drew it on in glaze; which, given the less than set frosting, dripped over the sides and was weirdly cool looking in the end. I actually liked it with the hot chocolate and would do it again. The frosting though, I might try it again with more time, but could do with something less sugary as well.

I love to make fancy desserts though usually don't go in for cake decorating. But this was a special birthday, so ... I had to make the chocolate web twice because the first one was too fine. Thicker spokes worked the second time - even using a plastic bag as the recipe suggests. Fun & delicious.

In bringing this to work for a pot luck, I omitted the chocolate spider and web. On my team, I have kept a practice of making some desert type item for the team to share on their break to celebrate team members' birthdays. One team member has decided this is what she wants for all her future birthdays.

This was a huge hit at my halloween party - simple to prepare (i followed the instructions almost exactly) and still delicious 5 days later.

I know the recipe specifically says semi-sweet chocolate only, but I would like to use white chocolate chips instead for a more striking presentation on the chocolate frosted cake. Before I try - has anyone already tried this and did it work?

This recipe was wonderful, the frosting in particular was delicious! Not too sweet, just a perfect complement to the cake. The spider web was very striking! I can't wait to make this again.

AMAZING! the cake turned out nice & moist and not too sweet, the icing was perfect...was worried about the web cracking but refrigerated overnite and peeled itself off the paper very easily...suggest using a dryer on low setting to quickly melt the web onto the cake and then in fridge for a few minutes to set...DEFINITELY a keeper that wowed everyone!!!

Very striking cake and very tasty. I think the seven minute frosting complements the cake, which a nice light cake. Like many layer cakes, it is at its best on the day it is made. This was the second or third time we have made this cake. My spider web didn't want to droop so we used very indirect heat from a hairdryer from a 3 ft. distance to soften the web after we placed it on the cake.

I used two 1oz squares of Baker's semi-sweet chocolate for the web and spider and it worked perfectly - you don't have to use chocolate chips. I didn't actually get to taste the cake myself, but my husband - who is a cake fanatic and normally very appreciative of anything homemade - said he thought the sponge was a bit rubbery. I tasted the icing and would have preferred a buttercream. Basically, the spider and web are the bits that make this cake different, but you could put them on your favourite cake, which I will do next time.

This cake and frosting was not overly sweet which was nice for Halloween's sweet filled evening. My kitchen must have been a bit cool as the spider did not droop as required. A few minutes on the counter next to a burner on low took care of that. I will up the powdered espresso by a teaspoon the next time for even more mocha oomph.

I've made this cake several times and it's delicious every time. It's also fun to make, with the spider and web. It's always a big hit at Hallowe'en parties.

I made this recipe (the whole menu) when it appeared in the October 1995 issue for a Halloween dinner party. This cake was soooooo good that my friends are still talking about it. The appearance and flavor were a feast for the eyes and palette!!!

An impressive cake just right for the month of October!
