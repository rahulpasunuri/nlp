Made it the night before-- tossed the cornbread, sausage and vegetable mixture together, covered and refrigerated. The next day just before baking, added the broth/egg mixture. Good flavors and a nice alternative to regular stuffing!

Too Dry. Maybe try using a smaller pan to retain the moisture.

I also added apples and celery and it was a hit.

can anyone tell me about how many cups of cornbread this takes? Also, is it an okay stuffing to use inside the turkey?

Excellent stuffing! Added one granny Smith apple and a handful of cranberries. Also substituted turkey italian sausage, which no doubt altered the taste a bit, but made it much less of diet-buster. Was really yummy.

This is a great Thanksgiving stuffing recipe! I added 3 apples, cubed, which added a nice sweetness. I also made the recipe gluten-free for my brother, by making wheat-free cornbread instead of purchasing it and using gluten-free broth. He asked that I make it again this Thanksgiving :)

Really good! OK so I "tweeked" the recipe with some of my favorate ingredients, but the basic palate was a solid base for improvisation. I added a cup of celery and a Granny Smith apple to the mix. A great Andouille from Whole Foods helped. The mild anise taste of the fennel surrived and was very pleasing.

Fabulous. Easy and delicious, with just the right amount of spice.

Made this with the grilled turkey from this month's magazine, good combination. DH had stated in past he didn't care for cornbread stuffing (too dry)so I was cautious abt keeping it moist. Made my own cornbread and added some leftover multi-grain bread. Loved the combination of sweet vegtables & spicy sausage; went well with remaining menu items.
