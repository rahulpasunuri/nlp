I used red onions like the previous reviewers had suggested and it turned out great! Went well with fish tacos. The next day, I added diced mangoes to the leftover salsa and served them with chips. The mint makes this salsa quite refreshing.

This recipe was an answer to "What am I going to do with all these Christmas pears from Harry & David?" I did not take the skin off of the pears, used a red onion for color (as one chef suggested), omitted the sugar and mint, used marinated jalepenos instead of fresh and added about 2 tsp of chili powder for more flavor and color. This made a LOT of salsa. Will probably have it over spinach tomorrow. A great use of pears! : )

This was wonderful. The combination of pears, onions, jalapenos, cilantro and mint with a little lime juice was great. Because my pears were very sweet, I skipped the sugar. I served it with grilled pork chops. My only complaint is that it is all green and white. It needs a third color. Next time I'll use a red chili or red onion to make it a little more visually appealing.

Easy to make and delicious. I omitted the mint and chile because I didn't have them on hand. Tastes better the second day!

very good; although some time-consuming chopping is required, it's a very versatile salsa: we served it with grilled salmon and a pork tenderloin. We made one change (because we had the ingredient): used Meyer lemon juice (and a bit of the rind) instead of the lime. EXCELLENT.

In looking for a use for the bounty of pears this season, this receipe came just in time! I made it with less fresh cilantro since I think cilantro can be overpowering. Got a boneless pork roast and had the butcher cut a pocket in it. I stuffed the pocket with this salsa, tied it with kitchen string, refrigerated it overnight and grilled it the next afternoon. YUM! Served it with some fresh salsa on side.

Made this salsa to top fresh halibut. It was a delicious combination! I almost omitted the mint, as I am not a huge mint fan, but am glad I didn't. The mint and cilantro complemented each other nicely & the mint added a 'cooling' contrast to the jalapeno.

I made this to go with the lobster tacos and it was great. I think it would also be great on other fish or maybe chicken. The only change I made was to use dried mint, since I couldn't find fresh. It was still delicious.
