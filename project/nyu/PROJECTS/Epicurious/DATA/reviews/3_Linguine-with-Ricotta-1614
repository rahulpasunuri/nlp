Super simple and super yummy. I cut back on the butter to 2 tbsp and added onion before adding the garlic. I also added peas as the other reviewer suggested. Everyone gobbled it up. We will definitely be having this again for dinner!

Nice, simple recipe for things you just happen to have in the fridge. I added some shallots to the garlic-butter mixture, and then added a little mascarpone, peas (and a bit of the pea water), and nutmeg to the stirred mixture. It was flavorsome and robust, while still being easy and simple. Definitely would repeat!

Delicious and easy! I used 2 T of butter and added peas. Also used fresh tagliatelle, which was a nice texture with the ricotta.

Pretty yummy. I added water instead of cream, as other reviewers suggested, and some diced ham. Next time, I may add a bit of spinach or tomatoes, or peas. It needs something. On the bright side, it's super easy.

On a cold,wet evening I wanted comfort food. I made this, with some modification, and loved it. I used only ~2 t. butter, used double or more the amount of fresh parsley, plus an equal amount of fresh basil, and seasoned it with an Italian sea salt with herbs. I skipped the cream, and mixed in hot pasta water until it made a creamy sauce, as other readers have suggested. I served it with a little grated Pecorino Romano on top. Wonderful.

We liked this well enough. It is an easy recipe and a change of pace. Instead of butter, I rendered two slices of bacon and used the grease. I chopped the bacon and folded in into the cheese right before serving. I also used the pasta water instead of cream. I might add a dash of nutmeg or red pepper flakes next time.

This is very reminiscent of a dish I had in Rome a number of years ago. Delicious. I cut the butter by half (no one needs 2 tablesspoons of butter per serving in one dish!) and used milk, not cream. Fabulous. This sauce is NOT about a creamy texture. It is supposed to be cheesy -- and "grainy" as an earlier reviewer wrote. Terrific.

This was a quick, filling meal. To make it more nutritious, I added frozen peas to pasta and boiling water just prior to draining and also added chucks of ham to the cheese.

I did not like the taste or texture of this sauce. The ricotta gives a grainy rather than creamy texture in this dish. While I thought it was edible if not very tasty, my son would not even touch it and my husband only took one bite.
