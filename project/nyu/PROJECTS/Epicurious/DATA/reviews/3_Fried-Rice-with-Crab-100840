yum and easy to make. in mine i added some white onion and green onion. also a bit of cilantro. then i added 2 spoons of yellow curry paste. you can use curry powder too. i also added 2 spoons of crab fat for extra texture. the curry adds a bit of spice.

Delicious. I also added mushrooms and would have added the onion a little earlier to get softer. I also added some five spice powder and oyster sauce and a little bit of thick soy sauce in addition to the regular. I left out the coriander.

I have made this a few times, although I always add extra veggies and have tried other meats as well. It is a good, basic Thai-style fried rice recipe. The flavors are definitely different from Chinese-style fried rice. A nice quick meal (though I up the portion size too).

Great for a quick dish. I would add more green onions.

This recipe was quick and easy. I added some fish sauce for extra Asian flavour. Its good to eat alone as a meal and great as a side dish to compliment other Seafood dishes.
