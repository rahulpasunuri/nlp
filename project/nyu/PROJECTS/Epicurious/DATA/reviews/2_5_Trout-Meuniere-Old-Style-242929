I just assumed the roux amounts were just a typo....but started w/the recipe anyway...and added to it to correct. Worked great, I made enough to freeze in small amounts to pull out and use when a spontaneous "nice" meal was needed. But for regular use, as mentioned in one of the reviews, adjust to 1/2 c. four, etc.

Totally agree with A Cook from DC. Made the mistake of following the recipe to the letter and ended up having to add over 4 cups of liquid to turn the roux into anything resembling a sauce. Try cutting flour back from 1.5 cups to .5 cup. It will make the dredge more spicy and fit the butter and stock proportions for the sauce. Can't Epicurious edit the recipe? Does Tom Fitzmorris even know? Another Cook from DC

There definitely is something off with this recipe. When I make a roux, it is one part flour to one part butter. My instinct tells me to use 3 Tablespoons of butter and 3 Tablespoons of spicy flour and add 1-1/2 cups of veal stock to make a nice sauce. The sauce was very good with the fish, but don't use the recipe as it stands. Also, for better tasting fish, I suggest you clarify the butter and fry the fish in it rather than oil.Good luck!

This is a lovely, traditional recipe. When saucing, you must use your eyes, nose, and tongue. Not just a recipe. If you found it becoming too thick, stop with the flour.

There was something off about this recipe, or at least my preparation of it. The sauce thickened up too much, indicating a lot more flour ended up in my sauce (more like a pudding) than was intended. I'd be careful about that step, taking caution that there wasn't too much left from coating the trout, were I to make it again. All in all, wasn't a pleasing use of my veal stock.
