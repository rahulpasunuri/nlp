followed advise of the many & for the sauce used white wine, clam juice & lemon juice...very good. The crepes could have used more tarragon(just a touch more). The crepes kept the fish moist and delicious...

Memorable New Year's eve dinner, sublime is right. Two changes: for crespelle, replaced tarragon with dill (excellent), for sauce, replaced water with combintion of white wine and lemon juice (so good). I had a bit of a problem with crespelle and was only able to get 4 good crêpes out of recipe, so will double next time, just in case... The lemon sauce was divine, though it might have not been quite enough for 6 servings. I made 4 servings with recipe and it was just perfect. Really very delicious.

Would give it 10 forks if I could. This has been our Christmas Eve dinner entree for several years. The combination of flavors is divine, can be assembled & refrigerated ahead of time, then into the oven to bake when you need it.

As one reviewer put it, this recipe is sublime. Truly the perfect word to describe it. Due to a time shortage, I did not make the pasta, but cooked some whole wheat fusilli (sp) I had on hand. The salmon, shallots, and some minced garlic were sautéed in olive oil in a separate pan. The sauce was made per the original recipe with the exception -I followed others suggestions and used lemon juice in place of water, and added about a tablespoon of dried tarragon. This sauce was like a Hollandaise on steroids....so delicious, so well-balanced...served up the noodles and chunked up salmon with garlic and shallots on plates, spooned sauce over top. Excellent! I have visions of the left-over sauce being enjoyed over eggs for breakfast :-) next time I will plan to make the crepes.

This was such an amazing dish that I can't wait to make it again. I would cut back on the butter some next time - especially inside the crespelle on the fish - it just wasn't needed. Served with Sauteed Radishes and Watercress (also on site). A lovely meal.

My my my my! As I began to prepare my palette of ingredients, I realized I was without large eggs! Typically I use chicken eggs, however they actually lay some of the smaller eggs used by culinary experts such as myself. I used ostrich eggs. They're large. I DO NOT recommend this recipe. It tasted weird.

Made this last night and it was really great. I made a major mistake though that was totally my fault: forgot to discard the salmon skin. The dough just stuck to it, unfortunately. I also followed everyone's advice and substituted the lemon juice. I think you can liberally add more fresh tarragon to the dish too. Next time I'm thinking I will add capers to the sauce. I also recommend making more dough than the recipe calls for. I didn't feel like there was enough! I will for sure improvise and make this with other proteins such as shrimp, chicken and even lobster. And finally, don't feel like you have to use tarragon; I'm sure this would be delicious with fresh dill or basil, not to mention a combo of fresh herbs.

I really loved the crepes and found them super easy to make as long as you get the pan hot enough. I did however majorly tweak the sauce. I added white wine, some lemon juice and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. I will make it again and again

This recipe is phenomenal! I've made it twice now. I was intimidated by making the pasta myself, but it was totally easy. The only thing I changed was to replace 1/3 of the water (for the sauce) with fresh lemon juice like so many others had recommended. It was perfect that way! This dish is just DELICIOUS!!

This is my show-stopper salmon recipe and when in doubt, make this! Double the shallot mixture, use lots of lemon zest, do not forget the clam juice, and absolutely use tarragon (dried or fresh). Everyone who has ever had a taste of this wants more.

I made this last night for a dinner party and it turned out well. I made the recipe exactly as written. All the flavors are really subtle and well balanced, however, for the next time I will add a bit more lemon to the sauce and add double the shallot mixture to the salmon.

I made this for Christmas dinner and got rave reviews. I must confess that my sister made it a few days prior and gave me a heads up that the sauce was bland and needed something. I doubled the recipe and first sautéed 2 cloves minced garlic and 1/2 large minced shallot in the butter. Then I added the 8 oz clam juice, 2/3 C water and 8 oz white wine for the liquids. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. I made the crepes two days prior and stacked them between sheets of waxed paper. I also assembled the dish a couple of hours prior to serving and had great results. Will definitely make again.

I don't think the thick roux-based sauce compliments the salmon. It blankets it and the salmon flavor gets lost. I won't use this one again.

This was fabulous. I cheated a little by using boughten crepes and then put the Tarragon in the sauce but it was still spectacular. The salmon with the sauce would be good even without the crespelle.

Per reviews, substituted some lemon juice and white wine for clam juice added salt to sauce, and added asparagus in assembly. Made crespelles smaller in 7" cast skillet, cut salmon in half to nicely fit. Served 2 crespelle/person garnished w/scallion, red and orange peppers. Prepared all in advance same day, covered and refrigerated and brought to room temp 2 hours before baking. Baked 15" and then broiled about 5" to crisp top. Excellent and nice presentation.

I have to admit, I was somewhat intimidated by this recipe (with the crepe-making and all), but it turned out to be super easy. I did follow all the other reviews and doubled the lemon and it just so happened that I only had dried tarragon - turned out just fine...

I hate writing a review when I've changed many things in a recipe, but I thought this was worth sharing. First, I agree with other reviewers, the sauce as is, is pretty bland, but nothing some Parmesan cheese and a pinch of salt won't help. My biggest change was that I had canned salmon at home and I was looking for a different way to use it (other than in a salad). So I used it here and it worked perfectly. I mixed it with some cream cheese just to make it creamier, the shallot and a splash of lemon juice. It was so yummy we wanted to lick our plates. A definite repeat... with or without the fresh salmon!

Delicious! Halved the recipe (full recipe of the sauce, and wasn't sorry) for our Christmas Eve dinner. Very easy to make, and we all loved it (my 6-year-old twins devoured it). Note that I made ths aauce in the same skillet used for the crepes (rather than in a separate saucepan, to save on dishes) and it worked just fine.

Did you use shallots or green onions in this recipe?

Rating: 4
This is a very tasty and easy recipe to make. Delicious flavors that are easily available. I didn't use the clam juice for religious reasons and substituted white wine. With the wine, it needed 1 tbsp lemon juice and one clove of garlic. While the dish tasted good, the plate appeal was a bit bland. Next time, I will save some of the chopped shallot tops to add after I plate up.

Rating: 4
My family was very impressed, and we all enjoyed this throughly. Personally, I will double the crespelle next time, as I am a carb freak! I also thought it could use more sauce, even though I increased this by 50%. Next time I will double. I, too, added lemon juice to the sauce, and can't imagine it without it. The tarragon is a MUST.

Rating: 4
I thought this was going to be more time-consuming; it came together in a half-hour. I tweaked the sauce a bit, adding lemon juice, wine and fresh tarragon. I think I would actually up the tarragon in the recipe. It adds so much flavor. The first crespelle came out a little funny because I had too much butter in the pan, but the rest were a snap. The recipe made 6, as promised. My husband raved about this dish.

I liked this recipe and only changed a few things. I don't use clam juice, I used white wine and lemon juice instead. I added one minced clove of garlic, a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of chopped fresh tarragon to the sauce. I also wrapped three asparagus spears in with the fish.

...adding more lemon juice and some garlic is a must in this dish's sauce....a little Tony Chachere's sprinkled on the Salmon doesn't hurt either. I am not a huge fan of Salmon, but this was delicious. .. a little chopped green onion sprinkled on after baking added a nice look to the presentation. I will definitely make this for company!

Rating: 3
This was really good. Quick and easy too. I used wine and lemon juice instead of water but still felt it could have used a bit more lemon in the sauce so make sure you test the flavor. I also used dill instead of tarragon and used the pale side as the outside presentation because it was prettier. Next time I will cut the salmon into chunks and mix with shrimp and bay scallops and possibly bind with a little of the sauce. Will definitely be making again.

OMG. My teenaged daughter loves sweet crepes, and it's taken me almost 15 years to convince her that "savory" are just as good. This recipe finally did it! She's now a convert to the savory side; and my husband and I got to reminisce about the crespelle we used to eat in northern Italy. A true winner of recipe. Delicate, formal, and tasty - but easy enough if you know how to make a crepe. The only changes I made where those that were suggested: a bit of lemon and wine to brighten the sauce; and seeing as my garden needs to be "put to bed" and it's a shame to waste fresh herbs, I used a combo of tarragon, dill, and parsley (in the crespelle and also as a garnish on top.) Cheers!

Wow! This was terrific! I followed others advice and added a little more tarragon to crepes, a little lemon juice to sauce in place of water (about 2T) and sprinkled Parmesan over the sauce. Definitely a keeper!!!!

A wonderful dish. Everyone loved it. I did make a few changes. I doubled the crespelle recipe. I tripled the sauce (you won't regret it). In the cannelloni part I doubled the butter, shallot, salt, and pepper. I also added a pound of smoked salmon. I cut the salmon (both types) into large chunks and mixed it in with the other ingredients before making the cannelloni. After baking, I sprinkled parmesan cheese on it and a pinch of cayenne on each cannelloni. Yummy...

This was a hit at my house, although the sauce did need a little perking up. Next time I will follow suggestions of other reviewers and add more lemon and a little white wine. I used 1 tsp dried tarragon, which didn't really work - next time I'll be sure to use fresh. I love the taste of tarragon, unlike a number of other reviewers. I will also cut the salmon filets to 3, rather than 5 oz - both my husband and I thought we would prefer a greater ratio of crespelle to salmon.

I made this for dinner last night and my husband said he could eat it everyday. The taste really exceeds the simplicity of the preparation. I did add lemon juice and a touch of salt to the sauce which brightened it considerably. It was tasting a bit heavy prior.

We literally inhaled this. It was simply outstanding!! The crepes are easy to make, and the lemon cream sauce really finishes the dish well. I cut the butter proportions for each step by half, and it came out great. I also used two tsp. of dried tarragon b/c I didn't have time to get fresh. Just before serving, we grated a little parmesan on top like the previous reviewer, and a good meal was had by all!

We enjoyed this. I took others advice and added some lemon juice to the sauce with a little white wine vinager I used dried dill instead of taragon as I had it on hand. My 1st try at crepes. They turned out ok, but didn't spread all that well, but were big enough. I also added some Romano to the sauce since others had used parmesian. I had some already grated. I wondered if using shrimp and crab instead of salmon would work as the sauce is not strong and would not overwhelm the crab and shrimp.

Rating: 3
This is a great dish for amazing guests. I was a little disappointed with the sauce however (substituted half the water with lemon juice as someone else said, but found it was too 'lemony'and not much of anything else). Will adapt it next time I make it (Christmas Eve - gotta be a special recipe for me to make it on that day!). The crespelles were easy to make, though I had to do another half recipe because I was a little too generous and was only able to make 4 (follow the instructions!). Added two blanched aspargus per cannellonni, ends sticking out. Looked nice in the dish and even better on the plate when you arrange the crespelles cut in half. Oh, and the '45 minute active time' was very much on 'in my dreams' (spent about 1h30 on this). As per all the reviews I read here, this is what I'll do next time: 1) definitely add garlic to the sauce; 2) add 1/3 cup of parmesan (don't do this if you have italian guests ;-) 3) use 2/3 water and 1/3 lemon juice, + the same quantity of white wine (I found the sauce too thick when I reheated it later to finish the dish); 4) a little more generous with the cream (but just a bit!); 5) keep the aspargus (really good); 6) add shrimps (I figure about 3 per roll); 7) add more tarragon to crespelles. Finally, to those who call this their favourite salmon dish, substite the tuna for salmon in this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Pan-Seared-Tuna-with-Ginger-Shiitake-Cream-Sauce-100670 and watch your guests shed a tear for being so well fed!

This was a fabulous recipe that lent itself of modifications and pre-preparation very well. I made this for several people and did the following things: Doubled the recipe, but more than doubled the crepselle mixture and made many extra. Cut the individual portions into half and gave them their own wrap (was served with many other foods), exchanged 1/2 of the sauce water for lemon juice as per another rater's suggestion (could even be a third if you wanted something more delicate, it was *very* lemony), increased the zest by a tablespoon per single recipe, replaced tarragon with increased dill for a lighter herb flavor, and then rolled the cannelloni so the pale side was on the outside because the green flecks showed through and made for a lovely appearance. I made the crepselles two days in advance, layering each between saran wrap and they kept perfectly, while I made the sauce one day in advance and it did quite well (formed a skin, however). Upon reheating I added a half-cup of white wine to thin it out a bit and make spreading easier without having to heat it too much, risking 'breaking' it. The crepselles and sauce allowed the fish to cook perfectly without drying out and was bubbly and deliciate with a puffy pasta wrapping. Delicious! I served with 'garlicked' caper topping, a chilled asparagus salad with toasted almonds and white wine reduction (butter, shallots, white wine, honey dijon, orange zest), and an old-world wild rice pilaf topped with sauteed portabellas. The entire meal was light yet satisfying, and perfect for summer.

delicious and very special recipe! I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday and am serving it again for my mother's birthday luncheon. I cut the water in the sauce by half and substituted with lemon juice. Next time I'll sprinkle with fresh parmesan before serving to give a little oomph.

Very good recipe. As many others recommended, I added 2 tsp lemon juice to add some extra flavour. I also added in some small shrimp in the canellonies. Wasn't crazy about the flavour from the tarragon, like other reviewers will substitute dill next time. Served with Asparagus with Lemon and Butter (http://www.epicurio us.com/recipes/food/ views/109325) - was a good combination.

We really like this way with salmon and make it rather frequently for parties. A little practice with the Cannelloni and I got it mastered. Good use for salmon that isn't butchered real pretty 'cause it doesn't matter what the fish looks like. I made a large pan of it some time ago for a party that was delayed, and delayed, and then postponed. The prepared sat, well covered with wrap, in my freezer for weeks and I worried. When I finally got to serve it, it was just fine, just as good as originally. The sauce and wraps protect the salmon from drying/burning. Now I have a last minute dinner for more than 30 people and will make this and use the tail ends of salmon that have accumulated in the freezer, at the end of winter and almost the beginning of salmon catching/freezing season.

I'll be making this for Christmas Eve having made it during the summer as well. Hearing what other reviewers said I increased the lemon flavor not only in the sauce but in the crepes (cannoli) as well- to the crepes I add some lemon zest and more tarragon; to the sauce I also added extra lemon juice. Lovely dish! and truly worthy!!!! The make ahead aspect makes it that much better.

The dish lacks a punch and having read all posts I did add 2tblsp of lemon juice in the sauce, but it wasn't really coming through. I'd think about playing with the sauce more if I make it again.

This is a great recipe. Neither I nor my husband are fans of rare fish (except Ahi Tuna). While I understand from my own tastings that "fully cooked" salmon loses some of its essence, I just don't like the texture of salmon that has not been fully cooked through. The wrapping in the crespelle and baking in the sauce allows the salmon to be cooked through without loosing its salmon essence or drying out. While the steps seemed complicated, they are easy to do in a home kitchen. There is also the great benefit that so much can be prepared ahead of time. You can lessen the bad fat and cholesteral a bit by substituting lite (not extra virgin) olive oil for brushing the pan for making the crespelle, and substituting it for the butter in making the sauce. This obviously will not taste as rich as the butter version, but I found it better for the lack of richness. I agree with some of the other comments, that I would like a slightly more lemony taste to the sauce, and will experiment with adding more lemon in the future. But the recipe as is makes a very well balanced dish that is a real treat. I have added this to our rotation. It is definately a winner.

This was delicious and easy to make. My only adjustments: (a) I didn't use clam juice (didn't have any handy) but substituted chicken broth and (b) I added the juice of half a lemon to the sauce (I doubled the recipe so you will probably need less juice). Overall, a huge hit with the gusts.

Superb, elegant, flavorful and different with the added bonus of being able to assemble the entire dish before guests arrive.In fact the flavors benefit from a short "marinating" period. I halved this recipe and used parsley, not tarragon, and my well-seasoned cast iron pan to make the crespelle. Also doubled the butter/shallot mixture for more flavor. All worked well. The salmon was moist[baked for 20 min.], the shallot mixture lovely, and the crespelle/sauce twist elicited ooh's and ah's. Coupled with sauteed spinach in olive oil/garlic and this was a meal to remember.Thank you Gourmet.

Cooking the salmon in the crespelle, gave the salmon a wonderfully buttery texture.

We tried this last night and it was declared by all to be a triumph. It will be put into our rotation. This is a fairly delicately- flavored sauce, so don't expect to be bowled over by lemon or tarragon. It was well-balanced. I served it with the Asparagus Gremolata from this web site- I was worried it would make dinner a rediculous salute to lemon, but they worked well together. This recipe was pretty easy to assemble- I took advantage of the do-aheads and made the sauce and the crespelle (surprisingly simple)in the morning and dinner was just a matter of assembly at that point.

This is fabulous: wonderfully subtle layers of flavors (shallot butter on the salmon, a creamy clam/lemon sauce over and around the salmon) that complimented rather than competed with the salmon flavor. Once I found my old crepe pan, the crespelles were simple to prepare and the dish deceptively easy for such a delicious entree.
