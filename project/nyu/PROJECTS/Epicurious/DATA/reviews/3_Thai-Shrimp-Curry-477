3-4 serving adaptation: for convenience, used about 2 T. of "Taste of Thai" green curry paste instead of making from scratch, and added another 1-2 tsp. bottled galangel (can subst. grated fresh ginger); also recommend adding about a Tbsp. of light brown sugar to the coconut milk. Used sliced white mushrooms instead of enoki; omitted snow peas but added half a thinly-sliced yellow onion and a medium red bell pepper, also thinly sliced.

Very bland and boring. Lots of work. Some tough to find ingredients. Wouldn't make it again.

This recipe looks good, but I think making a Thai risotto, with lemon grass is easier. I had been thinking of making it with shrimp, so this recipe has inspired me.

I am not clear as to why the recipe produces such a large amount of curry paste, but only requires 6tbsp in the recipe. I wasn't overly impressed with the resulting flavour of the curry - the proportions of the spices were off.

An excellent curry! Intense, complex flavours but pleasantly spicy rather than fiery hot, with very good contrast in colour and texture. Loved the idea of making curry paste from scratch and to listed ingredients I added the juice and zest from one lime, 2 small garlic cloves and 2 tsp. sesame oil. I scrapped the clam juice (vile taste!) in favour of home-made fish stock - a little more than 1 cup as I wanted the finished sauce to be a bit thicker. Used baby bok choy and sugar snap peas for their crunch. The enoki 'shrooms were a superb addition but be careful not to overcook the veggies/shrimp - I think the cooking times given are a little too long especially for the shrimp. Garnished with shredded Thai basil and toasted sesame seeds, served with lemon jasmine rice, steamed green beans and a Thai-style cucumber salad, with cooling green tea gelato for dessert. Twas an outstanding Asian dinner bursting with flavour. Think this recipe would work well with chicken too and since I have that yummy curry paste will give it a try soon. Enjoy and thanks, Epicurious, for another winner!

I just decided to make this recipie but have run into a problem . The instructions call for me to mix together the first nine ingredients and then deal with the clam juice and cocnut milk. as written I only count 8 ingredients??

I agree with A Cook from Washington, DC. While the curry paste was fun to make and smelled delicious it was overpowered by the clam juice. Let the shrimp, coconut milk, and curry paste speak for themselves. Lose the juice! Can the clams!

This dish was inedible. I think it would have been great if it weren't for the overpowering taste of clam juice. I would recommend omitting that ingredient completely.

I loved this dish! I always order shrimp curry when I eat Thai and I always wanted to be able to make it and eat it more often. I added more curry to make it a little more spicy :)

Very good, but it was far more work than indicated by "cinch to whip up after work"; plan a good hour or two to make this! Lots of leftover curry paste is a good thing!

This recipe is far more 'curry' than 'Thai.' I think the amount of shrimp was on the high side; I usually use only 1/4 to 1/3 lb per person. I really like the idea of reducing coconut milk and clam juice, and I will use that idea again in other dishes.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe! We used one pound of shrimp and decided to substitute the other for a pound of sea scallops. It turned out great! This is a dish I would make for dinner guests.

A very tasty and colorful dish. My husband and I love spicy foods so we added more curry paste and even added a red chili paste once it was on our plates. Delicious! Thai and Indian foods are our favorite.

This was a great Thai dish, but I think I overdid the curry! Be careful, its spicer than you think. We spend 20 mins cooling our burning mouths! But ill definately make it again, just with less curry paste. I made it with red peppers, mushrooms,onions. It was really pretty too.

I use less of the paste because of my unfortunate sensitivity to spicy foods. Just a wonderful taste sensation!!! Leftover curry paste is the greatest as marinade for chicken or steak.

This recipe requires considerable preparation time although it is not difficult to prepare. Curry powder was substituted for tumeric and cumin; enoki mushrooms were omitted (unable to obtain) and fish stock was substituted for clam juice (never even seen it at a supermarket Down Under). It was quite delicious as one of several contrasting curries for guests to choose at a buffet dinner. It is slightly bland to be served just on its own as a main course.
