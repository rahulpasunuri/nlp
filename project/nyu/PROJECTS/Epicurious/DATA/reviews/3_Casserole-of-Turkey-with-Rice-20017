This has been a staple in our leftover turkey repertoire for 30 years. Partially precook brown rice and you're good to go. No tweaking necessary. Just follow directions.

Well, it is a 1960's casserole recipe probably developed or adapted in response to a publication deadline (honestly, I don't think the dressing adds anything other than the ability to include it in a magazine with articles on Thanksgiving leftovers - ditto the ham). Using the recipe as a guideline, I made this twice (goofed the first time and didn't "bloom" the curry powder in the fat and didn't pay attention to the saute) and used brown rice (cover the pot and check it in an hour). It is really just a 'chicken and rice dish', and is pleasant uncomplicated comfort food for the week after Thanksgiving - nothing fancy.

I combined many of your suggestions, and my husband raved about the result: Additional ingredients: Cream of mushroom soup, Cream of celery soup, 1 celery stalk, chopped, 3/4 cup chopped carrots. Reduce onion to 1. Reduce curry powder to 2 tsp. Change rice to brown rice. Reduce broth to 1 cup (for casserole, not rice). Preparation Pre cook rice. Use chicken broth instead of water. Add curry to broth. Fry celery and carrots with onion/mushroom mixture. When mixing all ingredients together, add cream soups first and then broth to get desired consistency. Bake at 375 for 30 to 40 minutes. Add parmesan/ bread crumb/butter topping and bake an additional 10 minutes.

I used about 1 TBSP of olive oil, added a large minced clove of garlic, used brown rice, covered the casserole for the whole cooking time. After 45 minutes, added 1/4 cup water, casserole was ready to eat in 1 hour. A keeper. We loved it!

Sorry James Beard, this casserole just doesn't work. Good casseroles taste better than the sum of their individual parts, but this tasted lamely of all of the individual elements, which just didn't come together into anything that was worth eating. Also, in the amount of time needed to cook the rice (about 20 minutes), the already-cooked turkey becomes rubbery as it bubbles away in the broth. This ended up in trash and wasted a bunch of ingredients that could have been put to much better use. Next time I'll stick with my standby turkey enchiladas when I have some leftover bird to repurpose.

Very Yummy! Will make again. Followed recipe almost exactly - only added a handful of cauliflower and cabbage to onions/mushrooms. Wonder if previous reviewers, who had to cook for hours, forgot to cover their dish? I used long-grain brown rice (NOT instant or fast-cooking or pre-cooked) and only had to bake for about 50 minutes, covered, in a deep casserole. Needs to be stirred once or twice to keep top layer of rice moist.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but I found that it was a very good starting point for using up leftovers. I pre-cooked my rice, added some cabbage while I sauted the mushrooms, and combined everything in a skillet and didn't bake it. Good flavors.

I was looking for a recipe that would make a casserole out of some leftover breaded chicken-I used this as a base. I cooked the rice ahead of time in the chicken broth. I sauteed the onions, mushrooms added some sherry wine, chicken broth and then some cream (in place of canned soup) Mixed everything together (omitted the stuffing since the chicken was already breaded and the curry) added some broccoli-raw and some parmesan. It turned out great, it was rich but in a good way. I baked it for 25 minutes. Yum, Yum.

This is a fantastic dish to make with leftover turkey and ham after the holidays. Super easy. My family looks forward to this leftover creation every year. FYI - it takes 2 - 3 hours to cook, so plan accordingly. I don't pre-cook the rice as other reviews have recommeneded. Keep an eye on the liquid during the first two hours of cooking time and add 1/2 cup to 1 cup of a 50/50 chicken broth water mixture about every 30 minutes. I also add 1 TBS of tumeric and extra salt and pepper.

I didn't like the fact that it had a vague cooking time, either. I used 5 minute brown rice and it took about 45 minutes to cook and it was still a little watery, but fortunately we started dinner late and by the time we sat down, the casserole was perfect. My guests really liked it. I also used cornbread stuffing, which really gave the taste a kick.

Won't make this mistake again. Even with the helpful tips from reviewers, we weren't able to make this into something we'd like to dedicate good turkey leftovers to. I'd remove the recipe from the file, but then I'm afraid I might accidentally find it in the future and try it again.

Beware of the long cooking time!! I made the mistake of not pre-cooking the rice, and the dish was in the oven for an hour and 45 minutes before I finally just popped it in the microwave for 10 minutes. There wasn't much flavor due to the long cooking time... couldn't even taste the curry! But it was still good, and it'd be great if using pre-cooked rice. The prep was incredibly easy - chopped veggies (and turkey) in the food processor, and didn't bother to sautee them - still cooked through.

Yum! While browsing for something to do with leftover chicken, I came across this easy, delicious comfort dish. Didn't have the stuffing so threw in about a cup of toasted bread cubes with 1tsp each thyme and sage, 1 stalk of celery and about a cup of sliced mushrooms that I sauteed with the onion. Used prosciutto I had leftover in the fridge instead of ham. Then, god forbid, added 1/2 can cream of celery soup. Pre-cooked the rice, as recommended, and baked for about 20-25 minutes. My husband, the gourmet, and I each had 2 helpings. Really, really good.

Casserole of Turkey with Rice is a fantastic left-overs dish! I altered the recipe by adding only 1 medium-large onion, one celery stick and about 3/4 cup of carrots, all chopped in large pieces. I used two tables of butter to brown the rice. An additional two cups of liquid was required half way through the 2 hour cooking period. I used two cups of freshly made turkey stock and two cups of water. I didn't add any leftover stuffing. I had several friends drop by the night I was making this, and they enjoyed it so much they all had additional servings. A crowd pleasing, comfort-food, dish.

Haven't yet tried this. Searching for help w/too much leftover turkey. Am APPALLED that so many of your reviewers are using canned creamed soups. Don't they know they ALL have too much salt. There must be a better way. Nothing wrong with using fresh or dried mushrooms for flavor, and fresh celey to add crunch. I shall try the recipe as written and report back on the results.

I deviated from recipe a bit, using ideas from other readers, and it turned out delish! Pre cooked the rice in chicken broth, and added curry powder & some fresh rosemary, before assembling with other ingred. in casserole. Also, sauteed celery w/mushrooms & onions. Celery stayed a little crunchy, which was good. Mixed all ingredients and added 1 can cream of celery soup, cooked in open casserole dish for about 15 min, then topped with parmesan/bread crumb/melted butter combo. My husband, who HATES casseroles, really liked the flavor, and said he could eat it again. The rest of the family had 3rds and 4ths!

This was fine, though it seemed like a repeat of Thanksgiving dinner--just mixed in a casserole. It did help to solve the leftover problem, but--it tasted like leftovers. We found the turkey nachos, also on this website a much more welcome change of pace.

I used an extra onion and that was a nice addition. Perhaps using a hotter curry powder would add an extra zest; think I will try that next time. I did have some sliced garlic cloves which helped.

I think that this recipie is marvelous.....my family loved it. I made some changes though...I added two stalks of celery and fried it with my onions. I added one can of cream of celery soup and one can of cream of mushroom soup and cooked the rice before hand, cutting the broth in half. The curry is a marvelous addition!! I layered the bottom of the casserole dish with Chinese noodles...put the casserole mixture and baked covered for 40 minutes. Then I took the casserole out, added more noodles to the top and baked it for another 10 minutes uncovered. It was a smash hit.

My family loved this one. I skimped on the curry, added saffron and a can of cream of mushroom soup. I could have doubled it and it would have been gone! Betty Beck Gardnervlle, NV

I did like most everyone else: used chicken instead of turkey and reduced the curry.

I have a better recipe= chopped chicken and rice with 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of cream of celery soup and milk. So much better! I didn't like the turkey and there is too much of the other stuff! Mine is GREAT and this one, is not!!! (and I'm not picky and niether is my family.)

The amount of curry recommended in the recipe is a bit much, I would use less in the future. Good recipe for your leftovers.

This is a keeper. Although I played around with it a bit. I used leftover chicken. Since we are kosher I substituted diced beef salami for the ham. I didn't have leftover stuffing but did just happen to have fresh poultry herbs. So I used about 1 TB of mixed herbs (sage,thyme,marjoram) and 2 cups loosely shredded whole grain bread. I also substituted wild rice. Next time I would cut the curry in 1/2 (personal taste). I baked it uncovered but would try covering next time. The wild rice increased the need for increased cooking time.

Nothing special,but it does serve a purpose.(getting rid of leftover turkey)

I really enjoyed this dish; my husband thought it was just okay. I substituted left-over chicken instead of turkey and used diluted cream of mushroom soup because I did not have mushrooms or broth on hand. It did require more liquid but I was prepared from reading the other reviews. I will definitely make this again. Quick and easy.

This casserole is even better the next day! What I liked about it is there is no goo or cheese so it didn't seem so caloric. A good potluck dish. I gave it a stir after about 45 minutes to prevent the top from getting too dry.

Quite nice! Nobody said not to make it again so that says something in my house. I substituted orzo for the rice. It did need more liquid. Made nice left-over lunches for work.

I would make this dish again because, as casseroles go, it had zip! Watch it with the curry unless you know you love that flavor...I thought 1T. was just fine. I omitted the ham and added 2 celery stalks, sauteed with the onions/mushrooms. I covered the dish with foil while baking and stirred several times. It took 1 hour and required additional water, probably about 1/2 cup.

My sister is ultra-picky, so I made this for her when she had her baby. She said it was wonderful. Our only problem with the recipe is the curry and rice. The solution, I've found, is to cook the rice beforehand, adding the curry to the water. The rice wont be questionable and the curry tones down. I'll definitely be experimenting with this in the future!

I used only 1 tsp curry and it was just enough. Next time I will leave out the dressing and use some parboiled wild rice.

Not an excellent dish, but certainly servicable. My step-son, who is a picky eater even liked it, and actually ate leftovers! You can taste the curry,, but it's not overpowering. I left out the stuffing and it was still good.

Adding a can of oysters to this recipe is a lovely addition. It's a great dish for left-over turkey. My family loves it!

The ingredients in this recipe did not sound very EXCITING, but I had them all without a trip to the market. So, I threw it together. What a pleasant surprize. The curry powder was a real exciting twist on the turkey. A very nutty indian dish. A definate keeper. It took longer than expected to cook the rice, about 55 minutes.

If I make this again , I would delete the curry powder and put gravy on top instead. One tablespoon of curry powder is overwhelming in this recipe.
