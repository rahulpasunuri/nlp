I made this with the white balsamic vinegar and it was very tasty. I also took the above suggestions on whether to use a food processor or just chop up small. I used a food processor but only on pulse to save time and still get that chopped up affect. I would make it again for sure.

Found this recipe to be less than what I expected. The recipe on this same site from Bon Apetit is wonderful. Have used it many times and much better. Nochanges were needed.

I used to work in a restaurant that serves this and this recipe is very close to what they served. I think I'll scale back on the garlic (or get used to being by myself ;) ) next time or pick smaller cloves and I agree with the red wine vinegar comment. I'll definitely be making this again.

Delicious, but too hot. Next time I'll leave out the red pepper flakes.

Hello folks, while I don't hail from Argentina, I have had my fair share of Argentinian steak, etc. I searched for a chimichurri recipe for a long tine on the internet and I have to say that this is 98% of what I have come to expect. I didn't get to use wine vinegar (I read that E-mail too late) and I do agree on finely chopping the parsley (I used flat) rather than using a food proccesor. I would also add that the finished product should be a little loose and liquidy, not like a paste or thick sauce. As far as its use on fish, hmmmm, maybe a good tuna steak. However, I prefer it on beef and so do the many friends I have introduced it to. Try it, you'll like it!

I have searched for a recipe that compares with my mother's that was brought up from San Nicolas, Argentina. This was very close and I made a few minor changes and replicated hers exactly. Red Wine vinegar, no natural born Gaucho would use White vinegar. Flat and Curly parsley should be combined in a 3 to 1 ratio. Then add fresh Oregano, I use varigated and Mexican as a mix of about 1 tablespoon and finally salt and pepper. let it sit for 24 hours and go. Oh yea, don't use a food processor, finely chop by hand.

This was a fantastic sauce to serve with skirt steak. I think it should be prepared a few days before you want to use it so that the true flovors come out but it was great!

This was okay. I don't know if I'd make it again--the primary flavor seemed to be the vinegar. Also, it didn't really go with the fish, for which it was intended.

I used fresh parsley from the garden and a ittle bit of fresh tarragon. It's not traditional but it as delicious.

This sauce was too thick. As a true argentinian, I was embarrased to serve this at the table. This is not Argentinian Chimichurri, but it is close! I did used this sauce to marinate chicken breasts before grilling. They were DELICIOUS!

This was really great. There was some left over and we ate it right out of the bowl with spoons.

Added lime juice and 1/2 cup of cilantro leaves for a fabulous marinade, basting sause, or serving sauce with any meat, fowl, or fish.
