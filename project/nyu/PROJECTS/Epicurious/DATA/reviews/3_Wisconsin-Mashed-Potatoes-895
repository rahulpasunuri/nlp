Very good and simple recipe but not a standout.

Didn't like the sound of boiling shallots so I sauteed them in butter instead. Continued with recipe as written. Delicious!

Instead of shallots, I used Garlic! Very good!

I tried the recipe as soon as I saw it and it has been a welcome addition to the marinated steak, blue cheese salad and wine we have most Saturday nights. Most times, I have opted to shortcut it though. First, I use about 3/4 c. chopped shallots. After the potatoes and shallots are done, I drain them well through a fine strainer so I don't lose the shallots! Then I add the cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper right to the hot potatoes. I mash them using an electric mixer and add the cream as I need it. Usually only about 1/4 cup. I think this intensifies the flavor, not using so much cream. But all in all, this is a favorite and is has become a Saturday nite tradition for this family!

This is the best Mashed potato recipe we have ever had. Awesome flavor, great texture, they look nice, and well worth the time. We used real Californian Chedder cheese. Perhaps this was the difference.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. It sounded great, but turned out to be very bland. In addition to having very little flavor, the potatoes were a bit labor intensive and a waste of good Wisconsin Cheese.
