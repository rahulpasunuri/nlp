delicious salad. i found it a bit bitter when i didn't have the orange with the lettuce, but with everything together, it was excellent.

I thought this recipe sounded interesting and delicious. However, I found it to be way too oniony, and otherwise lacking in any taste at all. It was easy to make, but even so I wouldn't make it again.

I served this with spicy Cornish Hens and found it a wonderful, light complement. However, the lettuce quickly becomes soggy, so add right before serving. Also, I had a LOT more dressing than I needed.

This made a wonderful starter salad for a North African main course (cinnamon roasted chicken with harissa sauce, on this site). I splurged and used champagne as suggested. It looks as good as it tastes. Suggestion: a friend had given me some huge specialty Greek olives (the size of purple plums) which I used as a "garnish" around the plate. They went perfectly.
