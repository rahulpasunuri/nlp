I've been tinkering around with this recipe for some time and think I made the best batch so far (hopefully not compromising its healthy qualities too much): Two eggs with the yolk; brown sugar instead of white; three small bananas; added 1/2 t cinnamon + dash of nutmeg; 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour. No nuts for me. Sooooo good.

This is a very good basic muffin recipe. To make these muffins even healthier. I made a few modifications based on other reviews. Cut sugar down to 1/3 c and used Sun Crystals. Used 1/2 c flour 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup oat flour. Used oats instead of oat bran. Melted one tablespoon of butter in a 1/4 measuring cup then added canola oil to fill. Added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. Sprinkled a small amount of cinnamon sugar on the top of each muffin before baking. The muffins came out very good. The sweetness was perfect for me...I like baked goods less sweet.

Delicious muffins! I followed recipe for the main ingredients, then added cinnamon, frozen blueberries in place of the pecans, and sprinkled brown sugar on top. My sons loved them! Healthy and easy for breakfast and afternoon snack!

Made (and reviewed) just as written this is a perfectly serviceable recipe and a fine way to use those bananas past their prime, and I have made them repeatedly since coming across this recipe. They're tender, delicious, and homey... and quite customizable if you must. You can, if you wish, sub a whole egg for the whites, or rolled oats for oat bran (though you might consider giving them a buzz in the processor), or walnuts for pecans. If you have three shriveling bananas that aren't huge, put them all in. Use buttermilk instead of whole milk, and change the leavening to a tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder. First time round I forgot the butter - so didn't feel any guilt about buttering them warm as we were devouring them for breakfast with coffee. My suggestion to those who felt them to be a little bare on top: sprinkle them with a little cinnamon-sugar before putting into the oven. Oh, and use cupcake papers. Easy, mess-free, and delights the kid in everyone.

This is my go to recipe for over-ripe bananas now. I make many variations available to accommodate whatever I happen to have on hand at the time. The way the nuts toast on top is a very pleasant (and healthy!) surprise. I love it.

We made a few modifications - subbed whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and skipped the pecans. These are hearty muffins indeed, but quite enjoyable.

I really enjoyed this base recipe, but didn't follow it exactly. My additions included about 1/2 C plain lowfat yogurt for moisture, dash of cinnamon, craisins + dried apples + apricots, I subbed 1 egg (instead of 2 egg whites),and instead of the oat bran I subbed 1 C "Bob's Red Mill 7 Grain Hot Cereal" for extra crunch and fiber. I also made a loaf instead of muffins. I think it was absolutely delicious, though I did have to bake it a bit longer (after 20 min I reduced the heat to 200 and let it sit for another 10 or 15 minutes, I think the yogurt made it take longer).

I hadn't read any reviews before I made this recipe but I had almost all the ingredients. I used rolled oats instead of oat bran cause that's what was in the cupboard. I also omitted the nuts cause son is picky but both hubby and son raved at the results. Will definitely cook this one again!! A big bonus is the low level of cholesterol..no egg yolk and rolled oats is known to reduce cholesterol levels.

Delicious! I read the reviews before making so I followed the recipe - then added 1 cup blue berries, 1 tsp cinnamon, and then made the streusel topping that was recommended -- whole oats, brown sugar, pecans and butter. These were incredible!!

I substituted rolled oats which I pulsed in the blender for a few seconds instead of the oat bran, which worked very well. I also used one whole egg in place of two egg whites, added half a cup of flaked coconut and half a cup of chocolate chunks. Delicious and not too sweet.

Great tasting muffins. I also added 1 cup of fresh blueberries because I had them on hand. I made a streusel topping of pecans, oats, brown sugar & butter - I like a bit more crunch on top of the muffin!!! Very tasty!

At last! A successful muffin recipe! I've long been an avid baker, but through some strange quirk of baking personality have never had luck with muffins. They always turn out too dense, lumpy, dried out, crumbly, stuck to the wrapper, you name it. Very rarely edible unless very warm and fresh. This recipe worked, just as is. I added 3/4C fresh blueberries only because I had some left in the fridge that absolutely HAD to be used up since I couldn't remember when I bought them. (Don't worry, they weren't moldy...just getting too soft!). I second one of the reviewers on here who talked about altering recipes beyond recognition. There's a fine line between tweaking something to fit ingredients on hand (I've been known to switch nuts if I don't have a particular one called for), and completely changing the whole recipe in amounts and ingredients. Give me a break folks....don't rate a recipe unless you're making a reasonable representation of it.

Excellent tasting muffins. I made them by the recipe, except for replacing 1/2 cup all purpose flour with wheat flour. Will definitely make these again.

These muffins are really tasty and I think its a good breakfast muffin. Its a good healthier alternative than other muffin recipies out there!

I gave this recipe every chance to have some flavor. I added molasses,spices, substituted some wheat flour for half of the white, even added chocolate chips. But I still couldn't manage to get any flavor out of them. I will stick to one of the many more flavorful recipes on this site. I liked the idea of the chopped bananas so I could just switch those out for the figs in the fig and pecan bran muffin recipe on this site. I have had many many successes with using that one as a base recipe and substituting to my preference.

I've made these muffins twice. They are great. I didn't want to waste the yolks, so I used 1 whole egg instead of just whites. The oat bran gives the muffins a little more substance that is nice. I also like that the muffins are not too sweet.

Rating: 3
I love these muffins!! I love that the bran is not derived from wheat, and that the banana is chopped and not mashed. these are so yummy! We substituted 1/4c. maple syrup for the 1/2c. sugar. I ate 2 right out of the oven YUM.

Rating: 4
These were perfect! The kids drank the last of the milk for breakfast, so I substituted buttermilk in equal proportion and changed the baking powder amt. to 2 tsp and added 1 tsp baking soda. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and used brown sugar instead of white - just my preference. With the addition of Hershey's dark chocolate chips, this was the perfect mixture between sweet and wholesome.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe. I used 1/3 of a cup instead of 1/2 of sugar, and the muffins were plenty sweet. I also used a whole egg rather than two egg whites. I also added 1/4 of a cup of currants. It was easy to make, and the muffins are delicious. I will make this again.

These are good. In order to make these a little healthier I backed the white flour down to 3/4 C and added 1/2 cup wheat flour. Then I added 3/4 C chocolate chips.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe, I think there is too much moisture in it; the muffins' centers did not cook at all, leaving them with an undercooked gooey center as opposed to a moist, yet crumbly and textured one. I was also not pleased by the consistency, I was hoping for coarser, bran-y muffin and ended with floury ones.

These muffins are moist, quick, easy and naturally sweet. I cut sugar to 1/3 c, used 1 c. whole wheat flour, 1/4 c. all purpose and added 1 cup of frozen blueberries.

This recipe is great as written, but I thought it was improved by adding 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and about 1/4 cup of riccota cheese.

I made these with whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose -- I don't recommend it. It came out tasting *too* wheat-y.

Made these as written. Next time I will double the bananas (mine were small) and add 1 t. cinnamon and 1/2 t. nutmeg (it needed spice). I topped with candied pecans just to be fancy. With changes, I'd rate 4 forks.

Mmmm, this was amazing. I thought the banana and oat flavors were perfectly balanced.I used some coconut since my pantry is overlowing with that.

I thought these muffins were excellent. I used butter as called for, which I think is essential to the flavor, added a little nutmeg, and replaced the pecans with macadamia nuts (which enhanced the butteriness). I also underbaked them just a bit. They turned out very moist and flavorful. I'll use this recipe repeatedly.

Pretty good. I used mac nuts, as I had leftovers from a mac nut pie. Very good with the banana. Do agree with other comment that can be a little bland or dry for some tastes. I liked though. Worth trying out and fiddling with as so easy to make

Easy and delicious! I used one frozen banana from my freezer, and one fresh one, and mashed them together, instead of chopping. Not too sweet, great banana flavor. My picky husband loved them too.

This was a rather bland recipe with whole wheat flour. Could use some cinnamon or somthing to jazz it up.

Over time I have altered this recipe and it is definately the favourite in the house. I use whole wheat flour, substitute All Bran cereal for the oat bran (soaking it in 1/2 c milk), increase the milk overall to 1 cup, reduce sugar to just less than 1/3 cup, and use brown sugar, use 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips (rather than nuts), and due to daughter's allergy, use egg substitute to equal one egg. I make mini muffins and bake them for 15 minutes. These are delicious and I can make them, start to finish, in 1/2 an hour and they turn out perfectly each time. What more could you ask for. Oh, and yes, I did try the recipe as written (save for the egg substitute) and have fiddled with it enough to prefer the above changes.

Rating: 2
These are quick, easy, and adaptable. I sub'ed canola oil for butter (sacrificing some flavor, I'm sure). Next time, I'll try replacing the fat with apple sauce at least in part. I'll mash the bananas next time too, tho some might like the texture of small bits in the finished product. These go over well with everyone- even those who run from anything that tastes remotely "healthy".

These were to die for! I didn't have any pecans in the house so I used chopped walnuts and hazelnuts instead. The perfect thing to make when you've got a couple of overripe bananas in your fruit bowl.

Good recipe! Cut the sugar a bit and used wheat bran but it was still very good, moist, and chewy. Will try to add a few bits of mini chocolate morsels next time to make it a bit 'sinful'.

Not bad for a fat-free muffin (which is the way I made it). Of course I made lots of subs - fat free yogurt and applesauce for the butter, whole wheat flour, dried cranberries, maple syrup/brown sugar mix for the white sugar, etc. If you're interested, made this way they have 122 calories, 0 fat, 3g of fibre and 4 grams of protein.

Of course, changes had to be made: added 3/4 cup sugar b/c I like my muffins sweet, used oil instead of butter, and used 2 whole eggs instead of whites b/c I was not interested in a low-fat muffin. They were super moist and tasty.

I didn't have any regular flour so I used whole wheat, I didn't have any oat bran so I used chocolate chips, I didn't have any white sugar so I used dark brown, I didn't have any baking powder so I used soda, I didn't have any salt so I used pepper, I didn't have any milk so I used beer, I didn't have any butter so I used lard, I didn't have any eggs so I used mayo, I didn't have any vanilla so I used peppermint, I didn't have any bananas so I used apples I didn't have any pecans so I used a scoop of peanut butter. They didn't turn out at all. Do ya think I shoulda followed the recipe exactly like it was written?

This was one of the best banana muffin recipes I've ever made! I have tried many muffin recipes from blueberry to banana-nut to cranberry. My whole family enjoyed them even my daughter who does not like any type of muffin. It was not as sweet as most muffin recipes. The oat bran gave great texture and taste. Like others I agree it was very moist and soft. Definitely a keeper!!! (I did not have pecans so I substituted walnuts)

Also followed the recipe to a T and loved it. why completely change the recipe and then rate it? An added suggestion perhaps but a complete overhaul is not the same recipe!

I also made this recipe with whole wheat pastry flour and whole wheat all purpose flour. In addition, I substituted maple syrup for half of the sugar (great flavor), used nonfat yogurt in place of the milk, used applesauce in place of the butter and substituted raisins for the nuts. They turned out fabulous and no fat!

I totally love the fact that there are other cooks that loves to change recipes like I do. I used 3/4 cup of whole-wheat pastry flour along with a 1/2 cup of whole-wheat flour for the 1 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour. I used raisins instead of the nuts, along with 2 whole eggs, vanilla-flavor soy milk instead of the regular milk and brown sugar. I also added cinnamon for added flavor.

In searching for ways to add fiber to my diet I found this recipie and modified it slightly. Changed flour to 3/4c. and oat bran to 2c. Left everything else the same but whipped the egg whites to stiff peaks, stirring in 1/2 to lighten the batter and then folding in the rest. They came out surprisingly light textured for bran muffins and were quite yummy. Think next time I make them I will add another egg white to lighten them further. Also will try adding some different fruits for variety. Also agree with the poster who added cinnamon. Very good.

This recipe has butter, and salt in it.

Changed a bunch of things, some with intent, some to match what I had on hand, but the result was delicious. Used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat. Substituted uncooked oatmeal for oat bran. 1 whole egg instead of 2 egg whites. Canola oil instead of butter. Used very black, huge bananas and cut down on sugar. Left out pecans but sprinkled some walnuts on top. But the best thing I added was 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice (cinn., ginger, nutmeg, cloves, allspice). The result was a slightly spicey, moist, multi-grain muffin with banana chunks, Yum. Oh I also always use the bigger muffin tins (6 per tin) and let them cook a couple of minutes more.

These muffins have potential. I used self raising flour and substituted wheat bran for the oat bran. I also used 2 whole eggs and replaced sultanas for the pecans. Next time I make them I will use the pecans as I found the addition of sultanas made them quite sweet. I have yet to find a Muffin recipe which is better than my Apple Custard Muffins.

Rating: 3
I substituted apple sauce for the butter, used whole eggs, added blueberries instead of bananas, omitted the pecans and added some wheat germ. I made 8 large muffins by filling the cups fuller and baking 2 minutes longer. They just came out of the oven and look delicious. A little sample of the finished product proved to be quite tasty. The only problem is that their shape is a little unusual. The center of the muffins baked to a pointed crown. I'd really like them to be rounded on the top like bakery muffins.

These muffins were pretty good, but changed a few things the second time I made them... I used canola oil instead of butter, and I used 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup of white sugar. I also used 1/2 cup of wheat bran and 1 cup of flour instead of the 1-1/4 cup of flour. Oh, and I used two whole eggs, not just egg whites.

I was very impressed with this recipe. It was extremely simple to make, not at all time consuming, and produced big, moist muffins with a soft texture. All the other banana muffins I've made require you to mash them, and I really enjoyed the chunks of banana in the muffin instead. Outstanding.
