Delicious and easy, I halved the recipe for pork dumplings.

I added about 2 tbsp of grated ginger root and served this dipping sauce with grilled butterflied prawns. We really enjoyed it.

This was just exactly what I was hoping it would be - delicious! I only made a half-portion and it was more than enough for an army of hungry dim sum lovers, let alone for just me and my boyfriend. I would suggest making a quarter-portion for four or fewer people (4 tbsp soy sauce, 8 tsp water, 4.5 tsp rice vinegar, 1 tsp sugar, 1 tbsp scallions).

This sauce goes very well with the Pork & Jicama Dumplings. The dumplings were a hit.
