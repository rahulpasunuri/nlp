Pretty good recipe, but needs some clarifications/changes: The sauteing takes at LEAST twice as long as they say. I saw that other reviewers recommended adding some sage, so I tried it. I added the parsley, but I also added about 4 tbsp of fresh chopped sage. YUM!! Also, I went very light on the lemon juice (a few drops sprinkled over the whole dish). I have always cooked up my chanterelles with onion, but this recipe really works well, and they are great by themselves!

Good, but not amazing. I used a bit too much fresh lemon juice - be very judicious here so as to not overwhelm the chanterelles.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but since I come from Finland, where we use a lot of wild mushrooms, I would like to share some chanterelle tips: -Fresh cream or cottage cheese are great with these; don't ever boil chanterelles or use them raw, but fry them in butter; fresh herbs,pepper and onion along with bacon are also good ingredients.

Deliciously simple. Used portobellos, and since there's lots of sage in the garden now, I added some chopped leaves a couple of minutes before the end of cooking, as suggested by the previous reviewer. Definitely worth a try.

I have not made this recipe. I am browsing for a new/different chanterelle recipe idea because tomorrow I head out to my favorite hunting spot. I've been hunting/picking chanterelles for a number of years. Hands down (in my opinion) sage is the best compliment to any chanterelle based recipe.

Tried mixing chanterelles & portobellos, will change that if attempted again. The chanterelles got lost in the shuffle. Needs a bit of spice to zip it up..
