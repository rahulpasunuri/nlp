We had it this night and it was soo yummy and quickly gone! To make it easier to digest, I added 3 med. size very fresh carrots, cut in small pieces. To make it a bit more tasty I used 1 tbsp. crushed dried coriander, roasted it first w/o any oil, added 1 leaf bay laurel plus 1 whole clove and cooked it altogether.

I doubled the recipe and made this soup for Thanksgiving dinner. Oh my goodness, it was such a hit; a couple people said it was the best soup they had ever had! The flavor was delicate yet incredibly appealing. And it was super easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly except for two things: I used half and half instead of cream, which worked beautifully. It wasn't overly rich at all. Also, I didn't strain the soup through a sieve; by simply blending it, it was creamy enough (even without having the artichokes peeled) that I didn't think it needed to be strained.

Bought Jerusalem Artichokes at the Farmers' Market today and found this recipe online. SO glad I did! It was rich, creamy, thick and very flavorful. A little goes a long way. I think it's key to let the onion and garlic caramelize a bit as this adds a robust flavor. Next time, I'm going to add the leaves from a few sprigs of fresh thyme when I cook the onion and garlic for an herbal touch. I might try it with less cream or milk instead, next time, because it has plenty of richness, and this is coming from someone who never can get enough richness! It's a keeper.

can you use j. artichokes dug up in spring? I live in PA and was digging up garlic for the greens and up came some of the artichokes - they are firm and solid but small, it is ok to use these?

I thought this soup was just OK - the flavor was pleasant, but not at all complex - I was bored with it by the time I got halfway through the first bowl. Tastes like creamy potato soup with a slightly silkier texture. I would only make this recipe again if I had sunchokes (aka jerusalem artichokes) that need to be used up and I'm too lazy for a more complicated recipe. If I do make it again, I'll peel the sunchokes first - I think the flavor and texture of the soup would benefit.

Forgot to mention that I didn't use anywhere near a cup of cream -- just splashed some in and it was great.

Delicious, sweet and very easy to make. Made it in about 25 minutes for lunch. I chopped the artichokes very roughly, into half-inch pieces, and it worked fine.

To the cook who had a metallic taste to the soup: Sunchokes react badly to pans with aluminum in them. Perhaps that was the problem?

This is a fabulous, easy and dinner party quality recpie. I never use the cream and people are amazed at how great it is, AND it is healthy and fat free without the cream.

This was so good! If you can find Jerusalem artichokes(sunchokes), which I have been looking for for a year, you must make this! It is impressively smooth and rich without a speck of thickener, which is really great for people who watch their carbs.

mmm, did I miss an ingredient? This was a plain Jane version of potato soup. I ended up adding some chopped cooked bacon for flavor. Also did not puree mixture. Just mashed the potatoes and artichokes and left it an interesting chunky texture.

This soup was amazing. I'm always surprised when such a simple list of ingredients produces such lovely results. I made the soup with soymilk and it was perfect. It was just rich enough  I think using cream would almost take it over the top. This is a total keeper.

When I saw some good-looking (relative) Jerusalem artichokes at my produce store, a rarity, I knew I needed to give these critters another try. The soup was lovely and elegant tasting. Kind of a pain to puree, but necessary. However, the after effects (horrid flatulence) of this tuber just aren't worth it. I would never make this soup for unsuspecting company. Sorry but I can't recommend despite being a good-tasting soup.

What did I do wrong? The sunchokes were fresh, and I followed the recipe to a "T." It smelled bad, and tasted metallic. My husband and I took a few sips and threw the entire pot away! Dinner ended up as cheese and bread last night!

Made for New Year's Eve party. Next time I'll double or even triple the recipe. Everyone enjoyed!

Never having cooked or eaten Jerusalem artichokes, my family loved this soup! The subtle flavor was fantastic. Even making this with a mix of whole milk & rice milk (we can't use cream) it was thick enough to feel like you were eating something. Simple & elegant. Would definitely make this again. Even my 9 year old, the pickiest eater alive, liked it and ate half a bowl.

Absolutely delicious. Soup has a wonderful nutty flavor that is unlike anything I've tasted before. However it did take me some time locating the sunchokes. Vons and Ralphs didn't carry them. I asked the produce man. But then I found them at Gelsons. Worth the effort. My husband liked the soup so much he told me to add this recipe to the short list!

Excellent tasting, rich, thick and creamy soup. Would recommend and make again.

this is fanstastic! i made it for a dinner party and doubled the recipe for bigger first-course servings. I also use veggie stock as some of my guests are vegetarians. i topped it with sage oil and spicy pecan brittle shards.... the sage brought out the earthiness of the sunchokes and the spicy candy added depth the to the flavor. i rarely see sunchokes at my grocery store, and i was so happy that i found them to make this soup!

just a note: jerusalem artichokes are different from artichoke hearts. i plan to try this recipe soon, so i'm not rating it, but fyi....

Delicious and easy. Can used canned artichoke hearts. I also topped the soup with a little shredded romano chesse.
