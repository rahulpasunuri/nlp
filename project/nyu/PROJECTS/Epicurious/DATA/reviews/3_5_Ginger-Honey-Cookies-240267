I am not the best baker and these were easy and fantastic! 6 out of 6 people loved them (which is impressive for my baking skills)! I would definitely make them again.

This is an simple and excellent recipe that produces a chewy ginger cookie. I followed other readers' recommendations to add an additional 4 tbsp. flour, as well as cardamom (1 pod, ground), 1/4 tsp. cloves, and 1 tsp. ground cinnamon. I increased the candied ginger to 1/3 cup and used my food processor to grind it very finely (the idea of little chunks in the cookies didn't sound appealing). The result was a cookie with a lot of ginger and spice flavor. Next time I'll increase the ginger to 1/2 cup, the honey to 1/2 cup, and skip the brown sugar entirely, I may even add a pinch of black pepper.

I love the texture of these cookies-they come out the perfect softness! I followed everyone's advice and added 4 tbsp of flour. I found the flavor very mild, I think I would add more chopped ginger next time. I also would like to try them again using flavored honey.

After reading the other reviews, I went ahead and added 4 tbsps more flour, which brought the cookies to an excellent consistency. I also added more spices, namely cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. I also didn't have any crystallized ginger, so instead used a combination of fresh and powdered ginger, and used more than the recipe called for. The result was a crispy-on-the-outside, chewy-in-the-middle cookie with a nice spicy bite and melt in your mouth taste. I would definitely make it again.

yummy yummy yummy as far as the taste goes. They were a bit too soft, but I guess I will add some more flour next time. I did do some things differently though... I added some chopped almonds and hazelnuts on top and some cinnamon and cardamom inside. I will definitely bake these again.

After a week of testing ginger cookie recipes, I can say this is last in the four I tested. The taste was good, but they were actually kind of sticky; perhaps a little more flour would help. I added some spices (cinnamon, cloves, cardamon) and like the (local) honey taste. But texture wise, they were just very flat and sticky.

These were delicious! I used honey from the Benedictine Monastery of Hawaii; their honey is less sweet and has more of a rich, smokey, and spicy flavor. It combined beautifully with the ginger.

These are so good!! I would call them subtle and nuanced rather than bland. I used good-quality candied ginger which helped (Reed's Brand). The texture was perfect as others mentioned. To me they tasted like light, airy gingersnaps.

The texture of this cookie is perfect but I agree with former reviews that it was a tad bland, even with cardamom. I would double or triple the ginger and add a few more tbsps ginger next time.

The cookies turned out to be a bit on the softer side. I had to increase the amount of flour by about 4tbsp to get the consistency right. However, the taste was out of this world! Also, it helps to bake the cookies covered. That way, they won't burn, and you can bake them longer.

Not bad, but a bit on the bland side; I added some cardamom, and a tablespoon or so of peanut butter to liven it up. next time I will cut back on the sugar. The texture is indeed, a nice balance of crispy and chewy.

I'v had these cookies twice now. Once was made as written by a friend. They were very thin but very tasty. The second time I made them and added more flour. Still good but I prefer them as written, the more crispy the better!

This recipe is worth trying just for its ease and few ingredients. The texture always comes out fantastic, but the taste could use some tweaking. I don't mix the ginger into the batter, but instead add it to the individual dollops of dough, to make sure it's evenly distributed. I also add a pinch of nutmeg to the batter because the cookies can be kind of bland. Then, once baked but before cooled, I dust with powder sugar and add a hunk of candied ginger or a golden raisin for decoration.

I had no problems making this recipe. It was very quick and simple, and while the cookies DID spread out flat the consistency wasn't that much different from, say, chocolate chip cookies. I made one batch as an experiment and as soon as they cooled one tray was gone!

These have a nice taste but spread dramatically on the cooky sheets, running into each other. Definitely make smaller mounds spaced far apart.
