The only change I made to this recipe was to use dried herbes de provence instead of salad herbs/fines herbes. The omelet was very greasy, I would use much less butter and cook it at a lower heat. The flavors were good, but I wish there were something more...A side salad is necessary.

Very good. I used fresh parsley, chervil, and chives in about equal amounts, and eliminated the dried herbs. It had just a little too much cheese for my taste, but my guests loved it. Easy, simple, a nice light dinner for spring.

Fine - nothing amazing. I did have it with asparagus and roasted potatoes (which was a very nice matching). However, it was all a little dull.

This was great, except that I used the wrong spice-I didn't know what fine herbes was, so I used herbes de provence, and it was really strong. I added broccoli and it was a great combo. The parsley in the eggs is a nice touch.

This was a WONDERFUL recipe. It would be great with asparagus on the side. I am making it again this evening!

It´s a delicious recipe, my husbande loved it. I added some extra cheese, and I agree with the other reviews: I won´t do that again, I also thought I´ll cut the salt next time. It´s a very easy and delicious omelet

Had some leftover gruyere from a quiche, and made this quick & easy omelet. Now I'll always make sure to have gruyere on hand for this easy last minute dish. Agree with the previous review and warn not to exceed the amount of cheese - perfect as is.

Tried this for breakfast this morning, and I loved it. It was easy to make, and looked and tasted delicious. Next time I make it, I'm going to cut the salt to 1/8 tsp. and use less butter in the skillet. Added extra cheese to my omelet (I love cheese) and won't do that next time - even for a cheese lover, the extra was too much. Great recipe, I'll be making it again.

I made this recipe tonight for supper, french bread, mushroom and green salad and it was excellent. The gruyere cheese was perfect for this dish. I will not use any other kind of cheese again. Also used thyme and dill as the herbs. Fast and easy meal.
