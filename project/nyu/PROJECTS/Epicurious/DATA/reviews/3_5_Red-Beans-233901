Pretty tasty preparation but I had the same issue as other reviewers, I used dried beans and they took absolutely FOREVER to cook, despite nearly 24 hours of soaking, I'm talking 3 hours of cooking. Nice result, used only 1 tsp of salt, plus lardons + ham. Will see how the family likes it.

I follwed the recipe as directed, and unfortunately it didn't turn out the way I expected - the red beans I had in New Orleans over vacation were really creamy, mine were watery. I used dried red kidney beans, and soaked them for 8 hours. I smashed them when directed, but it never got very creamy - maybe there was too much water? I added the amount of salt directed, and it was way too much - the ham was salty too. My own opinion - there was too much meat. Next time I'll also half the amount of each. Worth trying again - hopefully I can get the Louisiana beans the other reviewers suggested.

I soaked the beans overnight and tried to make them in the crock pot. Weren't really cooking fast enough so moved them to the stove. When they were done, they were delicious. I moved them back to the crock pot to keep warm and they got dried out. Had to add lots more liquid. I cooked them with 2 smoked ham hocks, then removed the meat and added it back in with andouille sausage. If we had eaten them right away they would have been perfect!

Sorry, I forgot: I read jlfried's review here first and was cautious of the amount of salt added (just do it to taste). Also, for some reason our beans took 4EVER to cook! Not sure why (they were soaked), but delicious anyway!

Wonderful! Being vegetarian, we substituted these sausage patties, crumbled: http:// eatair.blogspot.com/2007/08/chickpea- sausage-patties.html They added a great smokey flavor, but the beans would be great on their own. We served over some brown rice and had leftovers for days between two of us (freezing 1/2 probably would have served us well). Really good, traditional recipe that brought back a taste I haven't had since childhood. Thanks!

Having struggled with many Red bean recipes that were too bland this one is an absolute hit!!! Usually i am looking for the Crystal sauce at the restaurant but this is perfect!! Thanks to Chase you done great!!

Let me start by saying this was a total disaster. The amount of salt called for in this recipe is way too much. I really like salt. I like salt a lot, but there is so much salt in this recipe that I couldn't taste anything else. I think this would probably be divine, if you cut the salt in half. I am trying to think of a way to save this, maybe turn it into a soup by adding more water? If that doesn't work, I'll probably throw the whole thing out. What a waste.

I make a weekly beans and rice meal for a big group of my neighbors and this recipe was a big hit. Because I work around several dietary restrictions, I made the following modifications: *Vegetarian - I made ~1 quart of a brown rice gravy and substituted it for the meat, oil, and water listed in the ingredients. *I only used half the salt and pepper listed in the recipe, and would recommend starting there and increasing to your taste. *I multiplied the recipe by 5 to feed ~30 people. It was creamy, delicious, and easy to make.

i agree, you should get Camellia brand beans. i fill my suitcase with them whenever i'm in louisiana! if you can't at least try to get lighter color beans--somehow using very dark red beans i can never get them soft enough. they need to be really creamy so that the smashed beans add to the thickness just like a sauce. i used some pink beans from india once and they worked okay too, better than the dark red kidney beans you sometimes find.

This is a tasty recipe. I served it for a Marde Gras party and it was well recieved by all. Smashing the beans made all of the difference in consistency. This is now my standard recipe for red beans.

This is the real deal. But, I never make just one pound. Double everything as this freezes very well. Sometimes I add the whole trinity (2 parts onion, 1 part each, celery and bell pepper). The smashing some of the beans against the side of the pot with a spoon gives that creamy result of New Orleans style red beans. If I'm feeding people who will tolerate it, I serve with brown rice. French bread, to sop up the gravy, is standard. Though I've only just read this recipe, being from N.O.I've been making this for more than 30 years and I know Leah Chase is a very highly respected restaurant owner/operator who really does everything in the kitchen. She's a living legend. This can be adapted to accomodate vegans, just drop the meats and bump up the vegies. Also, I always use Camellia brand beans as this must start with good beans, and not all are good.(keep in mind the older the dried beans the longer they take to cook.) Camellia can be purchased from www.thecajunconnection.com, they are delightful to do business with and the area could sure use the support. I do hope you'll try this New Orleans Monday staple. Now to quote the way the great Louis Armstrong signed his correspondence, "Red Beans and Ricely Yours", yb (now in Chicago)
