We made this for a gourmet dinner for 10. The prep was alittle time consuming but we had two large pans to saute the veal. We breaded them ahead of time and had all other ingredients ready to add. Once prepared, we kept them warm under foil in low oven while the side dishes of sauteed green beans and orzo pasta were readied and then all was served. We added alittle vodka to sauteed mixture with dill, capers and vermouth. It was delicious and was evident as all guests cleaned their plates!

This recipe was good, but didn't 'wow' any of my family members. Modifications I made were to add a teaspoon of lemon juice and (unfortunately) I had to use dried dill instead of fresh. The only reason I won't make this again is that we strongly prefer the veal with lemon and artichokes. (also very easy to make.)

This recipe was easy. I had a lemon so I added the zest and lemon juice.

Very Easy! I made this for mothers day and everyone loved it (even my dill-hating father). I like a little more sauce, so I trippled the vermouth and sauted some mushrooms along with it.

EZ! The market didn't have veal so I subbed Turkey Breast culets instead. Surprised about earlier review regarding too much butter - we felt there was only enough sauce for two, not the advertised yield of 4.

Loved the capers and dill with vermouth. Way to much butter and I love butter. Next time will use either more Vermouth or not add the remaining 3 T butter.

Very quick and easy. I used pork which I thought tasted great. The sauce definitely makes the recipe. Try the full menu that is available from this page. The asparagus tart was really good.

I made this with pork scallops and it was simply wonderful! Also very easy to prepare at the last minute. I definately recommend it.

How about all the vegetarians and meat-eating whiners stay away from the veal recipes? How do you think they raise and process your chickens? Unless you do more than whine here, shaddup.

I have served this to guests on numerous occasions - everyone loves it - the dill makes it different. I also make it with chicken
