I love this recipe... It's quick and easy however I did make a few changes. I browned my shallots in a roasted garlic oil and instead of Sherry Wine Vinegar I used White Wine Vinegar. Also, instead of Parm I toped my salad with Manchego cheese. It made the salad. I got thumbs up from all around the table. I've made this twice in a week...actually just ate it about 15 mins ago.

Loved this recipe! I took it to a family gathering and it was enjoyed by all. I added some red and yellow cherry tomatoes, which made for a nice color contrast with all the green. I did not measure the vinaigrette carefully but made it to taste. I forgot the cheese but we didn't miss it. Would be good with feta or goat cheese as well I think.

While I'm pretty sure I hit the proportions exactly, I'm going to have to agree with those who say the vinagrette is too tart. It's also very important to have thin asparagus; ours was perhaps a bit thick, and did not come through the roasting well. Disappointing.

This is an excellent salad. I loved the vinaigrette! I also roasted halved plum tomatoes along with the asparagus. I disagree that the dressing is too tart, I thought it was perfect!

This was phenomenal! I made it for Valentine's dinner and the hubby loved it as well. Aside from adding a pinch of sugar to the dressing, I followed this recipe exactly. The dressing was not too tart for me, but I like a bit of tartness. The texture and flavors were great, and I love a warm salad - it works best when the asparagus has just come out of the oven.

I have made this numerous times and it is a huge hit at dinner parties. I substitute Arugula with butter lettuce or bibb.

I had arugula and green beans in my garden so I made this with the green beans, not asparagus. They needed a little longer roasting, but made a delightful dish.

This was very good, but I did make a few modifications to the dressing. I thought it was too acidic after following the recipe to the letter. I added about a tsp of sugar and a little more oil to mellow it out. That, and some coarsely ground black pepper did the trick. Love the lemon and arugula flavors together.

Made this for my dinner club. Everyone wanted seconds. Most, including me, have made it again and again. Very popular. Our new Easter dinner tradition.

loved this recipe. i followed it except for several changes noted here. I did not toss the salad. i used garlic olive oil as an add'l drizzle before putting it in the oven as well. i also doubled the cheese and it was fantastic! I used both arugula and spinach for a beautiful presentation!

Wonderful! have made this several times. I never add the asparagus and toss, but serve the mixed arugula on plates and place the asparagus on top.

This was very good and very easy to make. I added a pinch of sugar to the vinaigrette because it was a little too sharp for my taste. I will be making this again for Easter.

This recipe was extremely acidic. It might be better without the vinegar.

Yummy! A favorite spring salad. Served with lamb chops and potatoes with rosemary and white cheddar cheese from this site.

It was good. We added Strawberries and red onions. I don't think it would have been as good without those.

This was awesome! Very unique - I served it with roasted chicken. Add a good bottle of wine and that's all you need for a wonderful summer supper!

Awesome salad. Have made this Salad 3 times in 2 weeks. I grilled the Asparagus on the BBQ instead of cooking it in the oven. Gives it more flavor. Immediately basted it with the dressing after they came off. They really absorbed the flavor nicely.

One of the best salads ever. Not a big salad fan, but ate the whole recipe. Cut the asparagus into 1.5" pieces before tossing.

Due to incredible demand, I've made this salad twice in the last two weeks. The flavor of the dressing is amazing, and goes perfectly with the asparagus and arugula (i actually cheat and use a bag of baby greens with arugula, but it still tastes delicious). Plus it's healthy! It's my new favorite early summer salad.

This salad has become a regular! Easy to prepare and delicious!!

This was really good. I had left over dressing even though I used a lot more arugula. I roasted some cherry tomatoes with the asparagus and that turned out delicous, I think I will roast some onion slices as well to add a little kick in the flavor.

Excellent way to use asparagus with fresh, complementary flavours. I have made it several times already! Complements abounded!

Very nice blend of flavors. Served with a simple Roasted Chicken.

I also used a dark green leafy salad mix, and baby spinach, as my family doesn't like arugula. They really liked it, and to my amazement, my 17yr old actually ate the asparagus! I thought the dressing was very tasty.

This salad was very disappointing. The roasted flavor of the asparagus overpowered everything and the vinaigrette was unremarkable. My guests simply took a few bites to be polite. Don't waste delicious spring asparagus on a recipe like this.

Yum! There were only 4 of us, so we had leftover dressing... it tastes great on any salad... We also can't get arugula right now... at the store where we shop, they said there's a problem with a lot of the salad crops from California and too much rain... so we used a dark green leafy salad mix, which was also very good!

I'm always cautious about reviews but this one is definitely a keeper: great flavors and a surefire crowd pleaser.

An excellent salad, had to give the recipe to every one of my guests the night I made it. Perfect except my shallots were a little too strong (perhaps they were old), next time I would use slightly less.

Similar to the previous reviewers, I made this for Easter dinner and served it with roasted peppers and tomatoes, as well as artichoke hearts and a slice of proscuitto. It was excellent - a great way to prepare asparagus.

This salad is great - I made it for Easter on sunday and have already made it again. I roasted red peppers too and also cherry tomatoes. the second time i made it with red onions instead of shallots and that worked well too. Also i skipped the chives and cheese.

The salad is delicious. We added thinnly sliced red peppers and roasted them with the asaparagus and we only had watercress and butter lettuce so substituted that for the arugula. We are making for Easter dinner for the crowd and are sure everyone will love it.

Very flavorful. We are trying to cut down on carbs and with this side dish, we didn't even miss the rice of potatoes.

A wonderful use of asparagus and entirely good. Unfortunately lately I haven't been able to get arugula in this area, so I had to substitute baby spinach and it was still good, but arugula would have been preferred.

Delicious! The roasted asparagus with the salad is a new way to serve asparagus. My family really liked it. Next time I have company it will be on my menu.

Delicious blend of flavors. Roasted asparagus has always been a favorite, but this recipe definitely "kicks it up a notch"!
