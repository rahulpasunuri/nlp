I have made this many times and it has become a household favorite! When I can't get sea bass, I use tilapia- it is firm and holds up well. I usually sprinkle a little red pepper on as well.

Definitely easy prep. I took other reviewers' recommendations and marinated in lemon juice (added lime juice and olive oil) for about an hour. The result is definitely acceptable, although not particularly "wow"ing.

I like to add a little dill and garlic to the mayo, and serve with grilled foil pouches of tiny potatoes seasoned with rosemary and olive oil. Think we'll have this tonight!

This was a perfect and simple way to prepare halibut. I served this with fresh mango salsa and rainbow chard.

The recipe was good as far as moist fish with a crust, but it had no real flavor. I used fresh halibut and grouper and neither tickled my fancy. I mixed lemon zest and a premade lemon pepper seasoning with the mayo. All in all, it cooked well, but I won't make it again. I'd rather have blackened salmon.

Very simple and delicious. Great recipe when you don't have a lot of time to cook/marinate.

I admit I was more than dubious--both about the simplicity of the recipe and the use of mayonaise here, thinking it might end up as some kind of riff on a fillet 'o' fish sandwich. Still, I took a chance on the recipe for my husband's birthday: he summered on Nantucket as a child, and I figured he'd appreciate the nostalgia if nothing else. Happily, we were both thrilled with the results--and I'm a very picky fish eater. Do consider o2binxs's suggested additions in the comment below mine: I thought they added a great deal to the already wonderful recipe. I served the marinated fish with shitake mushrooms, asparagas, and scallion potato cakes. Can't wait to make this meal again!

Wow...I finally figured out a way to BBQ fish to my liking! It was crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. Here are some techniques I added for a special Thanksgiving treat: I marinated halibut in lemon for an hour prior to coating with mayo and placing on an oiled grill. I sauteed mushooms in butter and when golden, I set them aside. Then I made a buerre blanc sauce by finely chopping shallots and bringing to a boil in white wine...which I reduced and then slowly whisked in pats of butter. I poured the sauce over the BBQ'ed fish and then topped with the mushrooms. Best halibut I've made yet!

Used Halibut. We all love this recipe. You can't taste the mayo at all, just a nice golden crisp on the outside and a wonderfully moist fish. I serve with store bought mango salsa and it's become a favorite in my house.

At first glance mayo on fish seemed odd (unless it's canned tuna) but we were very pleasantly surprised at how good this recipe is. We used swordfish steaks and they came oh-so tender with the slightest crunch on the outside. Yum!

This was good, although I lost a lot of the mayo coating while I was grilling it. I will try again and hopefully perfect my technique. I used swordfish steaks and this did keep them quite moist.

Were it not for a fantastic piece of fish, this dish would have been a total loss. I take partial blame for thinking something so simple would be anything but simple!.

I love this prep method because it turns heads the wrong way at first, but afterwards everyone is surprised and happy to be so. If you're worried about the fish coming apart on the grill, such as tuna steaks and other oily fish are bound to do, a fish basket helps (though most don't leave room for very many steaks at a time).

A simple preparation that tasted great even though I had to use the grill pan on the cooktop. Next time, hopefully, the weather will cooperate, and I can grill it outdoors.

This dish is unbelievable. We live in Florida and eat a lot of fish, and we're always looking for new and different receipes. We tripped over this one several times before trying it. The thought of putting mayo on fish gave us pause, but we finally tried it on fresh grouper. We added a little lemon zest to the mayo but otherwise followed the recipe. Bottom line: it was outstanding. The mayo kept the fish really moist, and somehow, it seemed to enhance the grilled taste. We'll definitely do this recipe again, and I'm looking forward to trying it with other tuna and other fish.

Simply delicious. I used half the amount of mayonnaise on yellowfin tuna and served the fish with roasted tomato couscous with olives, roasted tomatoes and garlic from this site. I served steamed asparagus with them. I loved the combination of good-for-you food that tasted good.

Its a very fast and tasty way to make fish..I just wonder any chance any of the fat of the mayo burns off or is it just wishful thinking!?

I used a wasabi mayonaise. The tuna was beautiful in color and tasty.

Fantastic, so easy and so good. I used miracle whip light to cut down on some calories and it worked perfectly on Tuna Steaks. At 4 minutes a side the Tuna was medium. Next time I will cut it back to 3 minutes a side to get a more medium rare result.

Ok, in case you aren't convinced yet, this is amazing! I am never going to cook swordfish any other way again. Quick, simple, moist, delicious!!!

Have made this for years but with the addition of some mustard (dijon or grainy) to the mayo. Usually broil it in the oven but will try it on the grill. Simple but yummy!!

So easy & delicious. You cannot taste the mayo- it just helps to seal in the juices to produce juicy, moist fish. Served with roasted potatoes, roasted asparagus, and spinach. The ulimate nutritious fast food- but so much better than anything that you can buy.....

I was a skeptic since I positively hate mayo, but I have to admit, it was the best piece of swordfish I've had in some time. I am going to try it on halibut tonight.

This is absolutely a fabulous way to grill fish! We had an unseasonably warm early spring evening and a beautiful filet of fresh fresh halibut. I read the reviews and thought why not? Well, all I can say is that I can't wait to try this with swordfish and more halibut. I do think steaks would work better to keep it together but our filets worked extremely well too. The fish was melt in your mouth tender with perfect seasoning. A little meyer lemon squeeze and you are in heaven. Try this dish if you are looking for something simple but oh so delish!

Moist and delicious. We started with a really nice piece of fish and crisped it up by starting it on high (gas grill). I also used some wood chips to enhance the flavor. Served with truffled mashed potatos (just regular with lots of truffle butter). Excellent.

HOLY FISH!! Too simple to be sooo good. Works for outdoor and indoor cooking. Threw some grouper in the oven with the Helman's and topped the filets with bread crumbs- it did outstanding.

I've used this simple recipe for years with Bluefish. It takes the oils and strong fishy flavor out. Great for cold water fishes.

Delicious, and so easy! Perfect for fresh tuna steaks cooked on the grill. I also added some spicy cajun seasoning and reduced cooking time so tuna was med-rare.

This was so great. I baked it instead of grilling it and it turned out excellent. I also added dried dill & capers. Making it again.

Fabulous! Don't hesitate to try this. I have also sprinkled seasonings on (e.g., cajun) after the mayo before grilling which is also spectacular.

Fantastic! I never buy swordfish because when it's served to me I generally find it dry and a even a little gamey. But took a chance on it with this recipe (cooked over charcoal, and I did reduce the cooking time a bit); it was moist and delicious. Also allows you to fuss a little with other courses, because it's so simple to prepare. And you don't have to look it up every time!

This recipe freaked me out at first. I mean, slathering good fish with mayo prior to grilling? Horrors! But, as the other reviews indicate, it turned out surprisingly good, especially with the squeeze of lemon. I used a fresh swordfish steak, which probably added some mercury to the mix, but what the heck...

I agree with the cook from Boston. This was wonderful and easy. My son had caught a beautiful albacore and I wanted to do it justice. This recipe kept the fish moist and let the true flavor come out. Hard to imagine something so simple could be so good.

This was absolutely delicious! I had just purchased a jar of lemon mayonnaise on a recent trip to Paris andh I used it for this recipe. (I have no doubt regular mayo would work just as well). I used halibut steaks and they came out perfectly cooked! I often find grilled fish a bit dry, but this recipe produced the thenderest, moistest grilled halibut I have ever tasted. It was unbelievably easy, and the delicious taste of the fish was not masked by an overwhelming sauce or fruit salsa. I intend to grill fish this way from now on. Try it!
