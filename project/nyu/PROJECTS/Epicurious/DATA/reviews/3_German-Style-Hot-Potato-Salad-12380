This recipe is so-so, but the best German Potato Recipe I've found is from (believe it or not) the Betty Crocker Cookbook! It uses bacon and celery seed, and I take it to every pot luck. There are never any leftovers, and it always gets raves and several requests for the recipe!

Out of the eight people it was served to, not one raved about it. It went nicely with the Kraut and Sausage dish, but on it's own wasn't anything special.

Fantastic!!! Easy and tastes like the stuff in the german resteraunt down the street. My family loved it.
