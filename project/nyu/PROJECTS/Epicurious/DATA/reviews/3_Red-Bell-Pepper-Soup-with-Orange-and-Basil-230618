We really like the orange peel touch, but especially appreciated the ease of which baking the veggies made this recipe. The final product is extraordinary with a nice little kick from the romas and black pepper that the orange peel perfectly compliments.

I love this recipe, I made it quite a few times this summer. (Once actually with water, because I didn't have any stock, and it was still great.) I love gazpacho, but all the raw veggies can be too acidic for me, this tastes really fresh even though its cooked.

I think this soup is very disappointing. I ate it warm, rather than cold, which might make a difference. In my opinion, the orange zest ruins the taste. Perhaps it would be good without the orange?
