I had high expectations for this. This is something that my husband would love and I saved it to make for him on Valentines Day. Such a waste of time and ingredients. Everything about it was dissapointing.

I spent much of a day preparing this tart for a dinner with friends. I was very disappointed with the results. I followed the directions almost exactly, with one exception--the crust baked much faster than noted, and I shortened the last 15 minutes of crust baking time to about 8 minutes.. The crust was dry and the bottom cracked. The finished tart was bland. Nothing special here. IF I am going to spend this much time and use these many dishes and equipment in the kitchen, I expect a fantastic result, and fantastic IT WAS NOT.

SUPER delicious butter pecan flavor, NOT cloying sweet like your usual pecan pie. Similar in flavor to the Zingerman's Bakery pecan pies here in Michigan, which are about $35-40 apiece. I lost about 1/4 cup of flour in the process of making the crust (food processor went haywire!), and ended up adding about 2 Tbsp water to the mix. Wrapped the dough loosely in plastic wrap and squeezed it into ball, then rolled into pancake form, chilled about 5 minutes and placed in tart pan. It didn't turn out dry at all, and had a nice buttery scone like final texture. If you go by the book, the recipe takes awhile due to cooling times, but I significantly shortened these and didn't seem to experience adverse results -- I just made sure the butterscotch was cool enough to not curdle the dairy/eggs, and the crust was cool enough to not soak up the butterscotch when poured in. Will definitely make again, likely for a holiday or special occasion (with all that butter/cream/sugar, it is, after all, a total diet buster--but worth it!!).

I also had to add more cream (4-5T)to bring the crust together. The filling ingredients sounded like it was a winner, but I found the tart rather bland. The spiked whip cream is a must.

Baker and Spice is one of the best bakeries in Portland so I had high expectations for this tart. I thought the recipe sounded wonderful, and I was excited to give it a try. It didn't impress me. The crust, as others have stated, was too dry and crumbly and even with additional moisture I ended up just pressing it into the tart pan. I had more filling than would fit in the pan so when it was fully baked, there was more dry crust than filling. I was so disappointed; the filling smelled wonderful before and after going in the oven, but I found it to be quite bland. I might try this recipe again, but only with some tweaking (like using my standard tart dough recipe). Also, the photo shows the tart with whole pecan halves, but the recipe states to coarsely chop. I think going even finer would be beneficial.

Made this for Christmas dinner and was well received by all. It's much lighter than a standard pecan pie/tart, and the caramel custard is a welcome change from a corn syrup base. Two comments on the recipe. One - you will need additional liquid to get the crust to come together. I think I added 3-4 tablespoons of water. Two - I would chop up the pecans next time. You don't see them when the topping sets, and the whole pecans are harder to cut through when serving.

Let me start off by saying that I was a little nervous about preparing this recipe because there were no reviews as of January 2. My husband and family said it was "awesome, awesome, awesome". It was very time consuming and required lots of bowls and steps, but I was up for the challenge and was able to complete it over two days (only because I had to go away). I rolled out the crust 5 times before I gave up and just put the crumbly pieces of the crust into the tart pan and wound up pressing it into position. 14" crust was to big for a 9" tart pan, so I had lots of fold-over at the rim. The egg yolk and flour mixture was very messy and unlike anything I've ever done before, but it worked. Finally, it looked just like the photo and would make an impressive dessert. Much better than a regular pecan pie with a more complex filling, crumbly cookie-like crust and overall impressive appearance.

I needed to add an extra 2 TB of whip cream to crust in order to gather into ball (maybe due to the dry Denver air). This recipe was good but took the better part of my day to prepare. I didn't feel the results were worth the time.
