Tripled the recipe and made it(along with a few other main course salads) for a party of fifty. It was one of the most delicious salads I've ever eaten.

Easy and Yummy. Great with chick peas - add s&p. Made it with tangerines.

Cumin is the wrong spice here. Some other spice or combination of herb is needed. I even used Cara Cara orange juice/zest (stronger than a navel orang) and the cumin completely overwhelmed the flavor.

I didn't use this on couscous, but on a salad. The cumin is an unusual but wonderful flavor with the orange. I'll be making this again. I used a seasoned spicey balsamic with this, and it gave even more flavor.

Only used about half of the zest due to a kitchen error, but loved it. Will definitely make again.

Liked it, but took a bit more time to prepare than I originally thought. I'd eat this a lot in the summer, my husband not so much! Oly cook.

I really liked this dressing although I modified it by putting in only 1 teaspoon of cumin instead of the tablespoon called for in the recipe. My father really loved this dressing and we are going to use it in our restaurant this summer! The blend of orange and balsamic was perfect and it is so easy to make!

Used this with mixed greens and then served a grilled hoisin salmon on top. Perfect

I used this dressing to use with the couscous salad and thought it was just awful. There was too much orange juice which made it taste very bland and overwhelmed the other ingrediants (I had used good red wine vinegar instead of balsamic). Rather than use it in the end, I just drizzled over some balsamic vinegar and olive oil which was fine.

See my review of the Chicken Couscous salad. The dressing is the secret.
