Our family loves this recipe! My 5 and 2 year old chooses this every Saturday for breakfast. This is a buttermilk pancake recipe-not a milk pancake recipe. I reduced the sugar to 2 Tablespoons and just skipped the last Tablespoon in the egg white. If your kids like the taste of real yogurt (the organic or greek kind) they will love the hint of tang that buttermilk brings to pancakes. Beware, put in a a measured amount of baking powder--in other words, level off with a knife

I made these the day after Thanksgiving for out of town guests, but all seven of us thought they were no better than something you'd get out of a box. I added blueberries to the remaining batter, hoping to save the taste, but was still unimpressed. This weekend I scrolled back to the recipe submitted by the Toronto cook that everyone seems to be talking about (8/1/2000) to give those a shot. Perfection! My husband is the self-proclaimed Pancake Expert and he adored them!

I've made this recipe three times, trying to vary it for better flavor, but it's just not a great recipe. Too much baking powder flavor. Try others.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe and they turned out great. However, my 4 y/o son complained that they were too "sour". So the second time I made them I substituted 1 cup of whole milk and 1 cup of buttermilk - instead of the 2 cups of buttermilk. I followed everything else and they still turned out great and fluffy. There were still some bits of the buttermilk tang, which was okay. My son loved them and the best part was that they were still light and fluffy even on the second day.

I made these pancakes today, the first I've ever made from scratch, and I was supremely disappointed. They tasted sour and in order to compensate, I added chocolate chips which slightly masked the "tangy" taste. I will not be making these again, ever!

Great for our picky toddlers! I made a seperate batch without eggs because we have a child who is allergic, and they were still fabulous and a great consistency. These pancakes are quick and easy. Great variations are using whole wheat flour and adding berries or - our personal favorite - mini chocolate chips!! These pancakes also freeze very well for a quick breakfast for your kids on hectic mornings!

I hate to do this, but I was planning to make this recipe and ended up making the Cook's Illustrated recipe provided by the Toronto reviewer in August 2000 just to see what the controversy was about. Here's my two cents: the Cook's recipe is quite good, but *nothing* compares with the Buttermilk Pancakes w/ Blueberry Compote recipe available on this site. They are life-alteringly good, and my family is spoiled forever for other pancakes. I only strayed from that recipe because I didn't have any sour cream on hand.

A tiny bit more work than from a box mix, but a million times more word it! These were delicious with fresh blueberries and sliced bananas added after initially pouring the batter. I froze the extras for quick mornings.

I've probably made these pancakes at least 40 times. With a few simple modifications, they've clearly become my family's favorite pancake recipe. First, I use 1 1/2 cups of flour and 1/2 cup of cornmeal instead of 2 cups of flour. This adds a subtle bit of texture and bite. I also add 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. Finally, powdered buttermilk keeps well in the refrigerator, and is a convenient substitute for the real thing.

I found these pancakes to be the oddest recipe I've ever encountered. They were too tangy, while at the same time, too sweet. I made them at the restaurant I own, and I don't think the customers were any more impressed than I was. I scrolled back (way back) to the review posted in August 2000 by the Toronto cook to see what the fuss was about and tried those pancakes next. They were just wonderful! We sold out.

a real crowd pleaser! We added fresh blueberries... Truly divine.

Rating: 3
i Loved it and will make it a regular..using the skim milk and vinegar. I think the key in this recipe is to understand how to whip the whites and then fold them into the batter without bashing out the air. Folding means folding, not stirring, and it doesn't have to be fully integrated at the cost of airiness. I let the batter stand for awhile before folding in the whites, and then prepare immediately.

I loved these pancakes-so tall and fluffy-but they're much more work than usual pancakes, what with the eggbeating and folding in and all. Also, the recipe requires planning ahead to have buttermilk in the fridge. But the texture is really great and luxurious, like a good restaurant pankake. And it's really rewarding to see them rise so high when I pur the batter onto the pan!

Among my family of five, only I thought these pancakes were okay-- everyone else tried to be nice, but I could tell they just didn't like them. They were very dense, and more cake-like than a pancake should be, and too sweet. I plan on trying the recipe submitted way back from the cook from Toronto-- everyone who tried them on this site seemed to love them. And if my family doesn't, well-- they can cook their own breakfast!! :)

This is a nice light, egg-y pancake. Almost as easy and whipping up some Jiffy box pancakes, but much more delicate in flavor. My batter for some reason was thin, so I had to add about a 1/2 cup flour. Cheers!

If I could rate this higher I would. The only pancakes I ever would eat were my Grams' any recipes i've made or was served were always compared to hers and would be pushed away. She tried to tell me her recipe but she'd never written it down it was always a tich' of this and a tich' of that. Many attempts on my part to copy hers was thrown out. My family loves either a pancake or waffle night for dinner, eggs, bacon and of course real maple syrup. As we sat down and started eating and I took my first bite I started to cry, the taste the texture, the fluffyness of it all, was my Gram making me pancakes. So for the moment alone of having the comfort of my Grams' pancakes after so long, I give it a 10!

I was looking for an easy recipe to make pancakes from scratch and this recipe exceeded my expectations. It was very easy to make and I was serving pancakes in about 30 minutes. Light and fluffy basic pancakes. For the buttermilk, you can make your own. To make 1 cup buttermilk, measure 1 Tablespoon white vinegar and then add enough milk to total 1 cup of liquid. Let stand for 5 minutes before use.

I used milk instead of buttermilk, they turned out fine, the children liked them. Someone mentioned about freezing them, yes you can, I froze the left overs.Put pieces of baking parchment between each pacake wrap in foil and freeze, to cook, remove parchment paper and wrap in foil and re-heat in warm oven for a while.

I used reduced fat buttermilk and thought these were pretty good, but not any better than a recipe I usually use that is a non-buttermilk recipe. Does anyone know . . . if you freeze leftover pancakes, what do you do to prepare them again. I'll check this site someday soon to see if there is a response as I have a batch of leftover pancakes in the freezer right now! : ) 1/15/04 I made the Cook's Illustrated pancakes and they were delicious! A much better recipe! The only problem I had with them was that they only make 6 or 7 small pancakes and I have 2 kids!! Does anyone know if it's ok to double this recipe or should I just make 2 batches?

I personally thought these were a little salty, but they were extra light and fluffy. My family absolutely adored them -- "these are worth getting stuffed on" was one comment. I will definitely make again, although with only 1/4tsp salt, and maybe milk, assuming I don't have buttermilk on hand (good likelihood). I'd be interested to hear if anyone's used milk, and how they came out.

Very good pancakes. Light, fluffy, with well-balanced buttermilk and vanilla flavoring. I made this recipe and the previously mentioned "Toronto" recipe on back-to-back days.

I made the Cook's Illustrated recipe from the review by the cook from Toronto on 08/01/00. Three words: Un-be-lievable! Best pancake recipe you'll ever try. To make them even better try putting a thin slice of Jarlsberg cheese in the middle of them - pour the pancake batter, then press the Jarlsberg into the pancake, then add a bit more batter on top to cover the cheese. I got this idea from a cafe in Nantucket.

I made these for a wedding party the morning of the big day. They were delicate and substantial. Everyone loved the vanilla flavor.

These really are great fluffy pancakes. You have to make sure that you FOLD in the egg whites, however, letting the batter retain the egg whites' fluffiness.

Made these while on vacation in Vermont, away from my trusty Betty Crocker Picture Cookbook (1950 edition, which has a terrific recipe for Delicate Fluffy Pancakes......in comparison, these were a terrific disappointment... similar to Hockey Pucks in texture and taste.

I did not have the best luck with these pancakes, but it was probably the fact that I didn't have eggs and used egg substitute instead.

This is one of those recipes that makes you a champion to your friends and family. I made this one sunday morning from my girl friend and it was so good she was eating the mix out of the bowl. They where absolutely wonderful, very light, incredibly fluffy. I strongly recommend your baking soda is fresh when you make this, it will be the difference between good and great pancakes.

I added chocolate chips to mine as I'm not a huge fan of plain pancakes and love chocolate chip pancakes as well as blueberry, banana-pecan, granola-blueberry. In the article that this recipe is from, the author said he or she (can't remember which) had the pancakes filled with blueberries and served with warm butter and warm pure maple syrup. That will make a basic pancake recipe memorable.

Though everyone seems to be talking about the Cook's Illustrated recipe, I think the one from Bon Appetit that we're supposed to be reviewing is very good. Very quick, simple and deliciously fluffy. As an aside, I personally got sick of Cook's Illustrated after a while. Sure they're obsessive about recipe testing, but honestly, who cares how many times they tried to make something? Who really cares how many things they varied? My eyelids start getting heavy reading paragraph after paragraph. Just GET TO THE RECIPE ALREADY! That's all we ultimately care about, isn't it? That said, some of their other non-recipe features are enjoyable, and I do like the fact that they carry no advertising.

The Cooks Illustrated recipe is awesome. Here in San Francisco there's a place that my husband and I like to go for breakfast and we think their buttermilk pancakes are the best we have ever tasted. Every recipe I had tried prior had fallen way short capturing the taste of our breakfast place until now. Even my very finicky 2-year old loves these pancakes. By the way, I haven't tried the BH recipe (I don't even have the cookbook) but what is the big deal about fluffy pancakes anyway? I think it's more important that they are tender and have good flavor. I've had plenty of light and fluffy pancakes that tasted awful (like they came from a box) and were tough. The Cooks Illustrated recipe is just perfect!

I run a bed and breakfast and regularily make buttermilk pancakes so I decided to try the cook from Toronto's recipe from Cooks illustrated.

Another heartfelt "THANKS" to Toronto! I made the Cook's Illustrated pancakes and they are, by far, the best ever. I've been intending to sign up for their web site for a long time and this has inspired me to do it a.s.a.p. All the recipes that they have ever printd in the magazine are on the web site and more.... To "the cook from Salem" check to make sure your baking powder and baking soda are fresh. If they are no longer active then the pancakes will not rise and could cause the end result to be custardy. Good luck!

To the cook from Salem: I'm so sorry the Cook's Illustrated recipe didn't work out! I just went back to my cookbook to reread the recipe, and I copied it verbatum. Whisk the egg WHITE into the milk mixture. Then mix yolk with melted butter, and stir that into milk mixture. Don't know if that's what you did, but I hope this helps. I've made this recipe lots of times, but have never had it turn out custardy-- I have no idea what the problem could be. By the way, this serves 3-4 people, making about 8 3-inch pancakes. I hope this helps you!

I'd like to chime in on the Cook's Illustrated debate. I also take it and Gourmet (sorry, Bon Appetit) and find them both great. They have very different missions. I think of Cook's Illustrated as the Consumer Reports of cooking because they do have the product reviews and also because they obsess on recipes, repeating them with the slightest of variations til they feel that it is perfect. (I remember when they did an article on tenderloin and cooked 12 to get 1 right) I've liked every thing I've tried from it -try the fresh margaritas recipe from this summer -incredible! But I've also cooked whole menus from Gourmet and had impressed and blissful guests. And I find the travel articles enchanting and also useful. For the reviewer who said she is bored with maple syrup, use Grade B. It's much richer and more intense than typical maple syrup, which is usually grade A (something I learned from Gourmet a few years back). It's available in my local health food store and it's all I would ever use now.

I have to agree that "Cook's Illustrated" is the best magazine for recipes. I'm ready to cancel "Gourmet" because of the massize amount of ads that clog each issue.

Thanks to the Cook from Toronto, I now have THE perfect pancake recipe! After one bite, my husband declared this morning that "these are the best pancakes you've ever made." Sorry Bon Appetit, but Cook's Illustrated has got you beat on this one. Although I didn't try Bon Appetit's recipe, I have tried many from-scratch recipes in the past with just so-so results. For those of you interested, Cook's Illustrated has a pretty good web site at, no surprise, www.cooksillustrated.com. I have an additional comment about the Cook's Illustrated recipe: I had no idea how many pancakes the recipe made, so I made the entire recipe. I used 1/3 cup batter per pancake, and I ended up with 6 rather small pancakes. We ate every pancake and wished there were a couple more, so keep that in mind when making that recipe. Next time (like tomorrow!) I'll increase the amounts by 50%.

I make pancakes from "scratch" all the time and these farr surpassed any other recipe that I have tried! Do yourself a favor and print it out for the future!

To Pat from New Jersey ...You can buy Cook's Illustrated magazine from good bookstores & many fine food stores too. Its not very exciting visually but if you're interested in learning to produce the 'best recipe' for any given dish, this is a great source. They painstakingly test & re-test every method & step involved & come up with the best way to make the dishes featured in each issue. They also test-drive gadgets, cookware & ingredients & come up with short-lists of those that they feel perform best. Its an invaluable source-book & I learn something every time I get a new issue. These people take cooking seriously & it is sufficiently different from Bon Appetit & Gourmet that one could happily use all 3 !

Interested in comments on Cook's Illustrated Magazine. Is there a webside, is it a magazine to be found in a local store?

I thought these cakes were pretty darn good, but I like the recipe for Buttermilk Pancakes with Blueberry Compote much better. I don't always have sour cream on hand, so I would make these again. What really made these flapjacks better was dousing them with blueberry syrup. I am bored with regular ol' maple. Thanks to you all for the tip on the "best" pancakes from Cook's Illustrated. Thanks for putting their recipe in your review! I will most certainly try theirs next.

Little tip for those that really like to cook: While Gourmet is a wonderful magazine to read, and Bon Apetite has tons of great recipes, "Cook's Illustrated" really does their homework on methodology. I trust them and recommend them completely.

Yes, I realize this is an Epicurious site, but I must put in my 2 cents worth and let the reviewer from Nashville know where to find the best recipe that I know of for pancakes. It's in the cookbook "The Best Recipe", and it's written by the people at Cook's Illustrated magazine. They are out of this world......... my apologies to Bon Appetit-- I think your magazine is faboulous too! OKAY CHARLESTON, HERE GOES: 1 cup all purpose flour, 2 teaspoons sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda, 3/4 cup buttermilk, 1/4 cup milk (add a tablespoon if batter is thick), 1 large egg, seperated, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted. Whisk all dry ingredients into bowl. Mix 2 milks in seperate bowl, and whisk egg white into milks. Mix yolk with melted butter, then stir into milk mixture. Dump wet ingredients into dry ingredients all at once, and whisk until just mixed. Proceed as you would normally with pancakes (i.e. about 1/4 cup of batter on the griddle per pancake) and enjoy! I do mine about 2 or 3 minutes for the first side, and 1 or 2 minutes for the next. Happy now??! :) Hope it's yummy for you.

Very fluffy and fast to make. We all enjoyed them.

OK Cooks- since some of us don't have the cookbook you all are talking about how about coughing up the recipe and just not let us wonder what the rest of you are finding so delicious. Thanx;-)

These pancakes were just okay. They truly were not worth the trouble--they were not light and fluffy as you would expect from beaten egg whites. Instead, they had a heavy cake texture. I make my children pancakes 2-3 times a week and I still have not found a recipe that compares to the reliable pancakes of Aunt Jemina Original box.
