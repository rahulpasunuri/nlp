Made the sauce from wild blackberries which have more taste than domesticated berries you buy in the store. Also added whole berries to the sauce after it had cooled. Used it with a homemade sour cream cheese cake and it was a hit. My husband, who gave the blood to pick the wild blackberries, loved it so it will be used again and again at our house.

Didn't give it a great flavor rating, but will still make it again, because: 1) it's attractive; 2) it's a cinch to make. Used it over cheesecake, and it added just the right color.

Made this to go over some good vanilla ice cream. It is a nice not-too-sweet sauce that we enjoyed.
