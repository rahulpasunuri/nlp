For the hundredth time, "empanada" is spelled with a regular "n", not an "ñ".

I changed some things. I get a farmers' basket every week from a farm co-op. I used regular cabbage instead of red. Also, I don't like oregano so I substituted dried basil, which worked out well. The blend of the cider vinegar, mustard, and chilis work great. This was easy to make skill wise, just time consuming. I think I spent 1 1/2 hrs total from start to finish. I would make this for a party for sure.

I probably shouldn't review this now since I made it six months ago, but whatever. :) I loved the filling, but the crust/dough seemed too heavy and pasty. Either I screwed it up or it needs a different kind of crust. I'd also serve it as an appetizer. Can't remember if I adjusted the other ingredients...

I made so many changes that I wouldn't want to rate it. Let's just say I used the recipe as "inspiration." I used frozen spinach rather than the red cabbage. I also used pre-made pie pastry. I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and cut the vinegar - using half balsamic and half red wine vinegar. They were very good and we gobbled 'em up pretty fast.

i didn't put as much vinegar (i actually used red wine vinegar) as the recipe says and put more cheese too. the filling is pretty good, but the dough was a real pain to work with, really crumbly and wouldm't stick together. i even had to make a second batch because i had so much filling left!!! next time i might just make the filling as a side dish.

as part of lent I often go meatless, and am always on the look-out for new and interesting vegetarian recipes. These are definitely different! I made them a while back using the original recipe and was rather underwhelmed. Like others, too much vinegar, not enough cheese, walnut etc. Well I made these again, w/ several changes! First of all, I sauteed cabbage and onion in olive oil, added all other ingredients and omitted the vinegar all together! Instead i put in a healthy drizzle of balsamic glaze (Trader Joes brand). Wow, these really turned out great this time! Served alongisde mango salsa.... excellent vegetarian meal.

Based on previous reviews I cut the amount of vinegar and increased the amount of walnuts and cheese. I also added in cilantro to the filling mixture and used my own dough recipe. I thought this was great but had lots of leftover stuffing. I'll probably make it again, but not too often given the time involved.

I'm making this for Thanksgiving. My friend just asked me if I can sub the blue cheese for something else? Does anyone have any suggestions? I think I will make half with and half without.... Somebody help!

These are phenomenal! The combination of flavors is perfect. I will definitely make these again.

We loved this recipe as a side dish. After reading other reviews, halving the vinegar and upping the cheese and walnuts really made this dish. I didn't even try to make the dough to use this as empanadas. This was a hugh hit with my husband and would serve this as a simple veggie meal or we thought it would be a good match with pork chops. Would definitely make this again.

I have a catering business, and have made this recipe several times, and have always been complimented. I must admit that I did change a few aspects of the original recipe. I listened to a previous poster and cut the "Cider Vinegar in half. I also added more "Blue Cheese" & "Walnuts". People making this recipe should also not worry about exact measurements. If you like more cinnamon add it, more or less mustard do it. It is really hard to mess this one up. I will say though, don't kill yourself making the dough. It is a major hassel to make work. I use my favorite pie dough recipe, I roll it out, I cut individual circles with a bisquit cutter, I brush the outer edges of the dough with water, then place an amount of filling that can be comfortably sealed in the empanada when folded in half. I then take a fork and crimp the edges, and place my completed empanadas on a cookie sheet covered with wax paper. Once I fill the sheet, I brush the empanadas with egg wash, place them in the freezer, and let them harden. Once hardend, they can be placed in a sealed freezer bag, and kept for up to a month. Then pulled out placed on a parchment lined cookie sheet and baked until browned. I use my own sauce, which consists of mixing sour cream with "El torrito" cilantro dressing found in many supermarkets, also at "Smart & Final" or "Cash & Carry". I will say again. I get requests for these empanadas over and over.

I followed the previous reviewers' recommendations to increase the amount of cheese and walnuts (about double for each). I thought the filling was both too sweet and too vinegary though. The dough was a total pain to work with. It was dry and crumbly. I had to work a few drops of water into each piece before rolling it out. Otherwise it just fell apart. I only got about 12 empanadas (two bites each) out of the dough and there is easily enough filling for 20 more. (I may try stuffing a pork tenderloin with it.) A big disappointment for all the work, but I won't make them again if they were totally easy.

I also thought that the cheese could have been increased in the filling, and that I'm not sure that the dish worked very well together. The filling was quite good, but if you are in a hurry you could probably substitute jarred red cabbage and add the walnuts and the cheese to that.

I have mixed feelings about this recipe. The individual components were good on their own but not that great together! The crust was interesting and easy to prepare and the filling is really good but the empanadas were so small that it was difficult to fill them. The recipe said to make 16 pieces. It would be better to have fewer of them and have them larger. I think the crust would be very good with another filling (perhaps some grilled or roasted vegetables). The leftover cabbage filling (there was a lot of it!) was really quite good and we had it the next night as a side dish with grilled pork chops. I will probably make the cabbage again for use as a side dish but I will not make these empanadas again.

I would make this recipe again, with some additional modifications. I cut the amount of vinegar in half and increased the amount of walnuts and cheese. The filling was great. However, the dough was virtually impossible to work with. It was incredibly fragile, and threatened to disintegrate when the egg wash was applied to the edges.

These were unusual, but good. I'm not sure I'll make them again. The vinegar flavor was a little strong in the finished product. I made mini-empanadas for appetizers. They were fairly labor intensive--I might make them again for a crowd if I started a day or two before. The amount of bleu cheese and walnuts also needs to be increased.
