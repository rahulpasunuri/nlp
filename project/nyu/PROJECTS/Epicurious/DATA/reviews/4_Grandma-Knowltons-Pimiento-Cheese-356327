This is very good as written but I did add some onion which I grated with a micro planer mainly for the onion juice, approx 1/8 teaspoons .For a spicey spread add some hot sauce or crushed red pepper flakes to taste . Makes great sandwitches or spread on crackers and or on grill bagels .(sliced the bagels into quarters ).

great recipe! i use 1/2 smoked gouda and 1/2 sharp white cheddar. i also substitute harris teeter's grilled peppers (in a jar next to the pimientos), chopped, to give it a little extra smokey flavor. and definitely duke's!!

I thought this was very good. It didn't go over as well as I thought it would when I brought it to a Pampered Chef sales pitch I was invited to. I'm hoping it was because the attendees were distracted and not because they aren't adventurous enough to try something new (we are from MI, you know). I'm going to give it another try for the next party I attend (no sales pitches, please) and put it in the food processor before adding the pimiento for a smoother texture.

Perfect! Scratched my husband's southern itch & it turns out I do like pimiento cheese...when it's this one. Used all mild cheddar as that's what hubs likes.

Many thanks for sharing this absolutely delicious recipe with us! It is perfect! I made it last week for the first time and I know it will always be in my refrigerator from now on.

Too amazingly good to be so easy! I will NEVER buy prepared pimiento cheese spread again. This was fabulous! I used higher end sharp cheddar yellow and white - the kind you want to eat with a good bottle of wine and a crusty bread. I bought the 4oz pimiento jar, after draining it was only slightly more than the 2.5 oz in recipe. The heat was perfect, just a touch in the background. I did add just a little salt but be careful, this will depend on the saltiness of your cheese and remember to think about the crackers you'll use, if they are salty you can go lighter on the spread. Grandma Knowlton is a genious!

I made this for my office holiday party as Andrew Knowlton suggested, and people loved it. It was extremely easy and quick to make - what could be better?

This is a good recipe for this great southern standard. If you add about 1/3 bar of softened cream cheese it makes it even smoother. Dukes Mayonnaise is the best with Hellman's a close second!

Made this yesterday-got rave reviews from all who sampled it. I did put it in a food processor for a little bit because I wanted it to be smoother. Great flavors.
