I'll make this again! It's the perfect thing to do when you have too much watermelon. I substituted italian orange soda in place of the wine and oj concentrate. I also added lemon juice in addition to the lime juice. I added a fresh mint sprig, 2 star anise and several allspice to the hot sugar mix until cool and then strained it before adding it to the watermelon puree. It gave a really nice spice essence to the ice. I used the pulp leftover from the straining for another quick dessert by blending it with a few tablespoons of vanilla ice cream and then refreezing it. It was also delicious and the spices really added to the flavor!

I found this recipe in Gourmet's Sweets cookbook and all the recipe called for was Watermelon, Sugar and Lime juice. The recipe was very easy and really tasty. My husband LOVES watermelon and has a fit if I try to "cook" with it. This he enjoyed and has asked me to make it again.

I don't know what is wrong with me, but that was one of the weirdest things I have ever tasted. Didn't like it so much. I may try again with the plain watermelon recipe

I've made this in the summertime, delicious! I found it again while looking for the "trio of grape sorbets" which by the way are outstanding....they seem to have been misplaced somewhere.

I've made this recipe a number times because it's so delicious and refreshing! I've added fresh or frozen blueberries to the mixture before I put it into the icecream machine. It's great!
