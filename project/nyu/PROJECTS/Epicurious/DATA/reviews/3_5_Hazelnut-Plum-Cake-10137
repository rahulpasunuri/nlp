This cake has never failed me; I often serve it at brunches to rave reviews. I always use hazelnuts. Sometimes I sprinkle the top with sugar crystals before baking. I used apriums last time; it was terrific.

Stunning! I used almonds and halved italian prune plums and it is amazing, particularly straight out of the oven.

This is an excellent European style cake and I'm looking forward to trying it again with pears instead of plums. It has a pleasing taste and texture and is quite easy to prepare.

My friend had me over for dinner and served this cake. It was so wonderful I had to try it myself. Wow! It is so easy to make - especially after I bought hazelnut meal from the health food store and didn't even need to grind up the nuts. I have recently begun substituting pears for the plums and sprinkling the top of the cake with cardamom and granulated sugar before baking. Pears and cardamom are a stellar combination and the variation keeps me from getting bored with the cake no matter how often I make it.

Very good cake -- we made it in December so we used Bosc pear slices instead of plums.

Easy, elegant and different. I *did* want something a little taller for a birthday group, so I simply made two of the cakes, slathered some warm jelly on one of them and placed the other cake right on top. It held together fine and didn't collapse. I also added a splash of peach brandy to the batter.

to the cook who liked the cake but not the presentation, try taking a red jelly/jam and heating it in the microwave for 30 seconds then brushing it over the warm cake...you'll have a truly beautiful gloss over the plums

I positively adored this cake. It wasn't heavy, the nuts complemented the plums perfectly. The confectioner's sugar made it look so professional. I think I'll eat the leftovers for breakfast. : )

I made this cake a few months ago and my friends still remember it.. they all asked for the recipe. This cake is easy and very good. It's not fancy looking (and it doesn't rise much) but it's pretty and good for a casual dinner party. I like it with whipped cream on the side.

I have made this cake several times, including a couple of times using sliced peaches or nectarines in place of the plums. It is easy and delicious - and since it uses only egg whites it's a great dessert when entertaining someone with cholesterol problems. It is a European style torte, as another reviewer noted, so don't expect a high layer cake!

If I knew this cake was going to be an inch high, I would have used my easy bake oven. I added 1tsp of baking powder the 2nd time and it was a little lighter. I would describe this cake as a flavorful sweet bread or torta.

This is a lovely dense, flavorful cake...very easy to make, and European in character. Terrific texture and makes use of all plum varieties you care to use. I used California black plums with great success.
