I used this recipe as a jumping off point. And I made a lot more. 32oz. chicken broth and 32oz. vegatable broth. I kept the wine the same because a previous review said it had a strong wine taste. I wanted a lot of vegatables and used asparagus-green and white. I used organic green beans chopped up instead of peas...baby bock choy and shitake mushrooms-chopped. And tiny size 'c' potatoes-whole. Also, what's a soup without onion and garlic-so I threw in both of those. For some pasta I added some gnocchi. Because I made so much I used three chicken breasts and shredded the meat and increased the herbs. Quite a diversion, but the results were excellent!

Next time I'll lighten up on the chicken and add some tiny squares of extra firm tofu and maybe some straw mushrooms for garnish. It is very nice and simple but with a strong wine taste.

A delicious simple soup. Very quick and easy. We used a can of Italian style chicken broth. This could easily serve 3 people--maybe 4.

A nice simple soup. I used sugar snap peas, so added them with the herbs and chives I used instead of green onions.
