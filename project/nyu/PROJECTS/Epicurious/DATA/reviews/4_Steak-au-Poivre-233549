Fantastic. I cooked the steak a little differently. I used the America's Test Kitchen family cookbook method and only peppered one side of the steak and pressed down while on the skillet with a large pot to apply even pressure. This cooked it to a perfect mid rare and evenly throughout. I served it up with some scalloped potato gratin with creme fraiche (also from epi). Going to try this with a fresh herb sauce next time and maybe some local mushrooms. Can't wait to do it again. (Plus now I have a bottle of brandy to drink/cook with!)

This dish has become our New Year's Eve tradition, along with goat cheese potato gratin and chocolate mousse (also on this site). The sauce is absolutely perfect. We made small plates for our daughter and her friend who spent the early part of their evening with us and the friend's comment was, "It's like eating in a restaurant!". High praise indeed. Thank you, Gourmet and Epicurious!

I have made this on a few occasions and I love, love, love it. I like to substitute a peppercorn blend sometimes instead of just black. Either way it is a must try.

YUM. although I was a little confused about how much to cook the steak, given that it was going to sit in the oven for 10 minutes while I made the sauce.

Made this last night for Valentines Day Dinner.... went with the flambe as suggested.... absolutely delicious!

Didn't have shallots so I used regular yellow onion. Didn't have brandy so I used Maker's Mark. Wasn't home, so I didn't have the cast iron skillet I'd usually use to make a dish like this and used a cheap stainless skillet instead. It was still terrific. This is obviously a very forgiving recipe.

I am not good at making steak, but this is delicious!

This is really good. Boyfriend made many 'mmmmmm' noises. I overcooked the steaks so next time I'll be sure I sear them at a higher heat, but luckily I like it that way. Made in combination with the gorgonzola polenta (which you should try regardless) and the sauce that accidentally mixed in with the polenta was a bonus.

This recipe can't be improved on, really! We thoroughly enjoyed our porterhouse steaks prepared exactly as the recipe called for-- I forgot the shallots and used the inner part of a sweet onion -- fabulous. Great recipe!

This was a huge hit! I can truly say that it was as nice as a high end bistro. I am by no means an experienced cook, but the accolades I got made me feel like I was.

We searched high and low for a great steak au poivre recipe after enjoying it at several restaurants. Once we found this, the search was over! Absolutely perfect as is, although we usually make it for two, using only two steaks, but the full sauce recipe. Now we order something else when we are out, because we know we can have a better version at home.

Awesome recipe! Delicious, simple, basic ingredients. Used filet mignon and forgot the salt. Hmmmm .... maybe it didn't need it.

I thought it to be a bit bland. I love steak au poivre and usually order it when I see it on the menu. I followed the recipe to a T. Expensive strip steak, the right peppercorns, veg oil and cast iron skillet. It just tasted bland. The sauce itself--spooned from the pan after dinner tasted great--but with the steak just so-so. I will try another recipe. Am I missing something?

This is a keeper! I couldn't locate our brandy or cognac, so used Pendleton Whisky, and it was great! Flamed up and everything. I'll do this one again.

extremely easy to make...but seems gourmet - would impress any diner. My children love it!

Super Fast to make, super tasty, too. I adjusted the amount of pepper for milder tastes, but was good. I used light cream instead of heavy cream and it resulted in a thinner sauce - still good,but noticably more runny. We will make this again!

I made this last night using fillet mignon instead of the strip steak. Otherwise, I followed the directions as written. My husband orders au poivre frequently when we eat out but felt this was as good or better than any he has had in fine restaurants. I'll definitely make it again. It was easy, didn't take a lot of unusual ingredients and was delicious.

Yum. We made this with vegetable broth instead of cognac because we have a 15 month-old. I have never seen the baby eat that fast and whine for more like that!

Great sauce. We do this frequently. Add a tablespoon of Dijon to give it some zip.

"Add Cognac (use caution; it may ignite)" But, but... steak flambé is always good! I made my first steak flambé in 6+ years tonight and I can't think of why I wasn't making any during those years. It's wonderful. Basically, when your steak is almost cooked to your taste, add the brandy/cognac, put a lit match near or in the sauce right away (with the fan turned off, you don't want *that* to catch fire) and once it's all burned off, add your cream, reduce a bit and serve.

I followed the recipe as written using a generic brandy for the sauce and thought it was very good as did my family. I think I will try Cognac or Gran Marnier next time for a hint of sweetness.

Rating: 4
Fantastic recipe. I made a variation using Grand Marnier instead of traditional brandy and a 3:1 ratio or so of black to pink peppercorns. The hint of orange was subtle and interesting and the pink peppercorns added some color.

OMG. The sauce was incredible. I served this over petit filets and thought my better half was going to actually lick his plate (he cleared the table so he may well have on the way to the kitchen!) I would make this sauce again and again. I'm going to try it next week over lamb as another reviewer suggested. Excellent meal really simple enough to do on a week night. Would make an impressive meal for company as well.

Simple and elegant, Summer, winter - works all year long. Additionally, I use THIS sauce recipe on the Epicurious Lamb Au Poivre recipe, as I find this to be simply the better sauce.

The steaks were wonderful, but I found the sauce to be quite bland. I'm not sure what I did wrong - perhaps it was because we'd cooked the steaks in a non-stick pan. I added some red wine to the sauce but it was still only so-so. Still, with the strength of the peppercorn flavor, the end result was quite good.

Quite tastey for a quick pan sauce. I thought it tasted good, my wife loved it, so its getting 3 forks.

I know it sounds crazy but I used a thick cut (1 1/4") of boneless pork chops instead of the beef and it was wonderful. I had to increase the cooking time, however, to make sure the pork was thoroughly cooked. Cognac definitely makes the sauce!!!!

this was incredible! my usual steak au poivre recipe uses a red wine reduction for the sauce but i much preferred this one. cooked perfectly and it was great for a weeknight meal. came together very quickly! yum yum yum!

The steak was excellent and the sauce was otherworldly. We had it with sauteed spinach and double fried french fries topped in sea salt. Perfect way to end 2006.

This was our Christmas dinner for my husband and I this year! I used two beef tenderloin steaks but didn't cut the sauce recipe in half, and I'm glad I didn't. In fact, I wish I'd doubled it and said to heck with cholesterol for one night. :-} This was fabulous, and truly restaurant quality. I served it with Asiago and Gruyere Risotto and Roasted Asparagus with Balsamic Browned Butter. Arteries are clogging as I type, but what a way to go. An outstanding recipe!

This was great! Used Crown Royal instead of Cognac in sauce, and bbq'd the steaks instead. Turned out really well.

We used high-quality peppercorns (Penzey's), and suspect that that makes a big difference. Couldn't afford Cognac, so we used leftover red wine which worked well. Easy to make, but tastes fancy.

made this last nite for a party(along with the chipolte shrimp!) and it disappeared. People cleaned their plates- licking the sauce up! Will absolutely make again.

This turned out perfectly and was surprisingly easy. I used grocery store peppercorns, but I also used about 10 times the amount the called for since we like ours extra peppery.
