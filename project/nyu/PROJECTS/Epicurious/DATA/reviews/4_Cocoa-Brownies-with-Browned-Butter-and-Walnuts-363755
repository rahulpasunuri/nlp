The best brownie recipe ever. Period.

Totally delicious! I've made these several times now. Yesterday I had to make them using gluten-free flour as my friend can't eat gluten, and they still turned out great. I notice they do take a few minutes longer to bake than stated in the recipe, so just be careful not to pull them out too early.

These are EVIL! So easy to make, with ingredients usually on hand, and they are delicious! I have probably made them half a dozen times already. Do not try them or you too will be hooked!

I've made this 6 or 8 times. Always awesome. I skip the walnuts but have sprinkled chopped pistachios on top to rave reviews.

Although it's all been said, I have to say it again!Absolutely scrumptious! Have made these at least 10 times- adult children request and love them. they are easy to make and chewy moist. I also had to bake them longer- about another 15 minutes. So worth the calories...but full of cocoa driven antioxidants!

I make these brownies all the time because everyone's crazy about them. I even forgot the flour once, and they were delicious as "flourless" brownies!

Brilliant recipe--of course I played with it a bit. I halved the recipe and made it in (dark nonstick) muffin cups, baked at 400F for 12 minutes for individual lava cakes. The half recipe made four. Perfect.

The are the best brownies by far! The shiny crisp top is a perfect complement to the gooey chocolate goodness inside.

Totally yummy! My old family brownie recipe is now replaced. I've made these several times over the last year for family and friends. The browned butter tastes gives a carmel undertone that is unexpected in a brownie. My teenage boys LOVE this brownie.

Just ridiculously good. I have been tinkering with brownie recipes since I was 9 years old. Age 36 now & the tinkering is over. (Although I admit to a backup recipe for when I'm out of cocoa, and I'm not above spiking these with a little Kahlua.)

Made these a few times now and they are fabulous and always get good reviews. Made exactly as recipe says as I'm not a baker and don't know how to mess with stuff that easily. Yummy, yummy in my tummy.

Awesome brownie recipe! I have a ton of cocoa powder and was looking for a good brownie recipe to use it in. I will look no further. The flavor and texture are both great. Although I'm not sure I really tasted the browned butter. The mixture gets very thick so don't use a wisk, or you'll break it like I did. :-) I'll use a spoon next time. Also, definitely wait until it's completely cooled before cutting. It will be much easier.

Fantastic. Browned butter flavor is subtle but carmel-ee delicious. I used 3/4c walnuts and 1/2c Scharfenberger semi-sweet. Awesome texture!

For some reason they are BEST EVER BROWNIES!! Lifelong recipe with 3 boys in the house!!

I was skeptical when I read the tagline for this recipe on the front of the magazine, and I have made a lot of brownies, with cocoa and with chocolate. I made a batch of these with the walnuts and a batch without, for my nut allergic friends on staff. Both batches were quick and easy to make, although I think I browned the butter a bit more on the plain batch. Both took well over 25 minutes to bake, probably more like 35, but I checked them every 5 minutes after 25 because I know how easy it is to overbake brownies. I cooled them for about an hour, then cut them. They were very easy to cut, and didn't crumble as some other reviewers have said. I thought I'd better taste one to make sure they were worthy of my staff potluck lunch, and they are truly the BEST brownies I have ever had! Chewy and crackly at the same time with a delicious deep dark fudgy flavour! Definitely a recipe that I will make time and time again - probably as soon as this weekend!

These brownies are ridiculously easy and have amazing texture and flavor. This is my go-to brownie recipe!

Awesome fresh out of the oven, BLEEPING AMAZING THE NEXT DAY. Seriously, leave at least some for the next day. We made a few changes (kahlua for water, added 1oz chopped unsweetened chocolate, topped with chopped hazelnuts instead of doing walnuts), but remained true to the basic brownie recipe. We will make these again. You should too!

Rating: 4
The perfect fudgy brownie, and my go-to since the recipe came out in the magazine. Even if you don't bother to brown the butter or toast the nuts, these have the perfect fudgy texture, though those steps are worth the effort. You also have to let them set up after they're done, but your patience will be rewarded!

I'm not a big sweets person, but I found myself craving these til they were gone. Have made them several times, and still love them. Made with Trader Joe's cocoa, and 10 min longer cooking. Sometime I'll try them with pecans, but the walnuts are good!

A recipe where they definitely improve with age! I'm not a nut person but I love the walnuts here, esp. with the browned butter. Incredibly dense, they really need time to set up properly before cutting/eating. Yum!!!

I just used good ol' Hershey cocoa (just bought instead of what's lasted through the winter) and my husband and I have just fallen in love with these. Really dark, deep chocolate taste. When I was making them, did not know when the butter would be done- it did not stop frothing like the recipe said- but turned out amazing!

Rating: 4
Made this using valrhona cocoa and they were amazing! I toasted the walnuts beforehand and placed thick slices of pear on top to make nutty pear brownies. These were fudgey dense brownies vs soft cake brownies in other recipes ... so were good as finger food for a party (I would choose a softer recipe to serve as a dessert).

I didn't think these were anything special. Not worth the extra work of browning the butter, and the batter is very stiff and difficult to work with.

This recipe is chocolate perfection. I made it twice--the first time they were so chewy, rich, and delicious. The second time I overbaked a little and it took away a lot of the great texture. Don't overbake!

The on-line recipe doesn't include the salt. The magazine version calls for 1/4 t but add 1/2 t kosher salt and it makes all the difference. Loved these but I had to bake them an extra 10 minutes.

Just tasted my first batch. Very good (but not better than Ina Garten's recipe). However, easier to make (a one pot wonder). I will make them again, but I think I will try lining pan with parchment paper as I had some sticking issues with the foil, even sprayed with cooking spray.

Rating: 0
Very easy and delicious. I love to cook but hate baking yet I've made this recipe 4 times in the last 2 months. I used Bob's all purpose gluten free flour, tossed in some cinnamon and cayanne to give them a kick and omitted the walnuts. I baked them in a mini-muffin pan and topped with a pecan half. Baked for 20 minutes and they were perfect. For half the batch with no cayanne, I topped with a drizzle of store bought caramel sauce and a sprinkle of sea salt once they cooled. Also very yummy.

I thought these were good. I made sure I browned the butter, my flecks were dark brown, and I had a strong taste in my brownies.

Having said that, three of us managed to eat this pan of brownies in less than a day.Even a less than perfect brownie is a wonderful thing!

These were delicious, though I'm not sure how much I taste browned butter in the final product. I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, but no nuts. Assuming you could double them for a 9x13 pan.

It's silly - they're so good and a snap to make. I needed 30 min. not 25, and I cut back the sugar to just 1 cup and it was plenty sweet - but why quibble. Double the recipe - you'll be glad you did.

I may have to replace my "one bowl" brownies with this recipe! The hardest part was browning the butter (which isn't hard!). I used my stand mixer, and just dumped the butter into the sugar/cocoa mixture in there, then added the rest as directed. I used a 9" round pan (same volume as 8" square), and just buttered it. No problems sticking at all. The flavor is really good, almost a hint of sweet salty, which is great. Super easy, and oh, so worth it!

I had my own brownie contest where I also pitted this against my old favorite, the Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee Brownies and two other recipes I had found. This came in pretty much neck and neck with the others, and with good reason. I loved the process of cooking the butter right to the point of burning...it was like a cool science experiment, followed by eating; what's not to love! And it has walnuts, another plus in its column. These are sort of the acme of brownies; you'd have to simply not like brownies to disagree with the assertions made here.

This is a fantastic recipe! I agree with the others that it actually has to cook for quite a bit longer than the recipe recommends. Also, ensure that you give the brownies plenty of time to cool before cutting them, otherwise they will crumble.

This is the best fudge brownie recipe I have ever made. Moist and chewy. My husband is allergic to nuts so I substituted dried cherries. 1 cup was a bit too much. Next time I'll try 1/2 to 3/4 cup. The cherries make these brownies very rich...Great with vanilla ice cream.

I made these today...and my house smelled heavenly! I too had to increase the baking time by about 10 minutes. At 25 minutes they were a soupy mess, but were perfect at 35 minutes. I had a friend who is a professional baker taste one and she asked for the recipe. You can't get a better recommendation than that!

Rating: 4
These are the best brownies I have ever made. They are dense and fudgy but not too sweet. I made them in a (foil-lined) glass 9x13 pan, and they were perfectly baked, so I would guess they'd need longer in an 8x8, as some have mentioned. The browned butter gives them a lovely caramel-y depth - next time I might try a little bit of sea salt sprinkled on top because I love that contrast. A winner!

Browning the butter adds a truly delicious dimension to the flavor of these brownies. I made sure to hand chop the walnuts so they're as chunky as they appear in the cover photo of February's 2011 Bon Appetit issue. I must, also, agree with other reviewers that baking time was up to 10 minutes longer than stated. I would bake them the 25 minutes and check for doneness, then at 5 minute intervals checking often until they're done as described or to your liking. I might suggest that the reviewer who found them chewy rather than fudgy may have baked them too long. It's kind of a judgement call but remember that the brownies continue to bake after removal from the oven. I will definitely make these again--maybe even RIGHT NOW!

These brownies are easy to make and you always have the ingredients on hand. I made them in a 9x9 pan (don't have an 8x8) and baked them for 24 min; excellent but thin. Next time I might do 1 1/2 recipe in the 9x9 pan for a thicker brownie...I'll let you know!

Wow. I just made these tonight and they are incredible. I have never tasted a brownie like this before. I followed the instructions verbatim (minus the walnuts, I prefer my chocolate untainted) and they came out perfectly. I only let them cool for about an hour; the 4 hour time estimate is a bit long in my opinion.

These are my new favorite brownies too. I've made them twice and both times needed an extra 10 or 15 minutes to cook. The first time I took them out a little too soon and they seemed too fudgy. So the second time I left them in till the tester came out almost clean and they were perfect. Doubled the recipe in a 9x13 pan with no problem. Took them to a ladies lunchen and everyone wanted the recipe. Enjoy!

These brownies were good. The ingredient list is short and the recipe easy. They were chewy and had a nice dense chocolate flavor. Not very sweet, which is fine with me. I toasted the walnuts and had bake them much longer than the 25 minutes. After testing doneness at 35 min. I turned the temp. down to 300 F and kept checking every 7 or so minutes. I can't recall how many times I did so, but I'm thinking it was around 50 minutes by the time I finally took them out. I would make them again for a brownie fix since they are so easy. Might sub Kahlua for the water next time.

Great brownies! My 11 year old made them with minimal supervision and a little muscle added for the mixing. Baked double recipe in 9x13 pan. Substituted Kahlua for the vanilla and water. Added 1 tsp espresso powder per single recipe. Had to bake them about 35 min as others reported. Also used Guittard Cocoa Rouge which is dutched with excellent results. Make sure to toast the nuts prior to adding them. Everyone loved these brownies!

I followed this recipe to the letter but still had to add about 20 minutes of extra cooking time - at 25 minutes the toothpick came out covered in raw batter. Even then I felt like they came out a bit gooey, but I'd rather that than overcooked. Plus side was that it's an easy, one-pot dessert.

I am not a brownie lover but I did like these. I didn't have a metal pan so used a glass one. I don't know if that is the reason it took much longer than 25 minutes to cook these. It was more like 50 minutes (we are at 3400 feet). The toothpick test was what I used and I kept getting raw batter up until the last 5 minutes. They are rich so I didn't feel cheated; got 16 nice sized brownies. Took them to a friend's house as dessert for dinner and they were a big hit. Used pecans instead of walnuts.

Rating: 2
These were good brownies, but I was disappointed after reading so many glowing reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, including the cooking time. They looked just like the picture and as described in the recipe comments, but I like a more intense chocolate flavor. As another reviewer already mentioned, I think Barefoot Contessa's Outrageous Brownies are much better.

Moist, nutty, delicious. Has a mix of regular and dutch process - will buy some non-Dutch and make again.

I will say I like the addition of the browned butter. It adds a layer of complexity to the brownies. I agree with the former posts that 25 minutes is too short. I added more time as well. I used toasted hazelnuts instead of walnuts, which I like--compliments the browned butter very well. Are they the best? No. I think for me it's a textural issue (a bit grainy) and a proportion issue (too much chocolate). I wish I knew what it was!

I come from a family of brownie snobs. Everyone has agreed that these are the best brownies I have made... even better than Barefoot Contessa brownies. They are super fudgy and easy to make!

These were still raw after 25 minutes, so I kept baking and checking every few minutes. Even after ten more minutes, they were still barely cooked. They're dense and flavorful, but so moist that they barely hold together. If I made them again, I might add a bit more flour to hold them together.

Loved these brownies. The butter really added an extra layer of flavor that was unusual and delicious. At only 25 minutes, they seem a little under-cooked. I added a couple of minutes the second time I made them and they were still undercooked. I will add 5 minutes the next time. They were really delicious, even slightly undercooked.

These were quite good. Best brownies ever? Maybe, but a little too much like fudge for me. Overall, these were very tasty and the browned butter is a wonderful addition.

These are great! *Very* similar to the "Best Cocoa Brownies" recipe from this site, but the browned butter's caramel undertones really do add depth- I think I might need to switch my allegiance! I chose to reduce the amount of walnuts slightly and add chocolate chips, as some others have done. I also iced with a very thin layer of ganache.

Made these for the Green Bay Packer NFC Championship game - brunch - my husband is very particular about brownies and these more than surpassed his approval - not too sweet, moist, chewy, no frosting in sight - the entire pan was gone by the time the Packers won - this will now be our go-to Brownie recipe.

Amazing... So easy to make and one of the best brownie recipes I have tried. Very fudgy! Added 1/3 cup semi sweet chocolate chips with the walnuts.

Alice Medrich has done it again!THIS IS A KEEPER!! I used Trader Joe's Tumaco Cocoa Powder, but I had to omit the nuts this time around-instead,I added 1 cup quality semi-sweet chocolate chips and they still turned out great.Next time,the nuts go in! The brownies are incredible:rich,pleasantly chewy and fudgy. I did have to cook them longer than 25 minutes,though. Next batch I may experiment with instant coffee granules or Kahlua instead of vanilla.

Brownies turned out thinner than I imagined. I used the 8x8 pan as instructed. Also, the cook time of 25min at 325 seemed too short. I cooked them an extra 5 minutes and they turned out ok. Probably should have stayed with the directions, but they didn't seem done according to the toothpick test.

OK. These really are the Best Brownies Ever! They were fast and easy to make and really good--nice and fudgy and chewy.

This recipe replaces the old tired and true one. Sent some home with my daughter in law and got a phone call from my son stating they were wonderful even with the nuts. Even after reading the footnote about not using Dutch cocoa I used Droste as that is what was in the pantry. Loved the texture and appearance. Mine were eaten before the 4 hours were up. No problem.Yum

The bar was set very high when I read that these were the best brownies the editors had ever tasted. So it might be that the fall from there was worse than if there were no expectations...they are quite good, but I think the Ghiradelli mix might be better! A few things to know in advance: Watch the butter closely! It gets the brown bits on the bottom quickly and can burn very quickly from there These come out rather thin, and the recipe makes about 10 brownies. There isn't enough for a crowd. Next time, I would double for a thicker and more substantial brownie For once, the prep time is actually close to the real prep time, they were in the oven in about 30 minutes, start to finish Watch the baking time closely--test at 20 minutes They cooled in one hour They cut perfectly! Which is not always the case with brownies and helps with presentation. I just sprayed the knife with Pam first anyway, and it cut like a dream They are chewy, and have the shiny and cracked top as promised, but if you like a richer, more chocolately brownie, I would add some chocolate chips or chunks as another reviewer mentioned
