Based on the other review, I switched to basic caramelized pearl onions instead of following the recipe and it was delicious and easy! I would definitely make it again.

The cocktail onions never lost their pungent acidity even after two long soakings in water. Tossed them and substituted a last-minute horseradish dip.
