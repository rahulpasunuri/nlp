The Mush makes it delicious, and the Monday tradition makes it interesting. Good way to use up an abundance of fresh corn ( cooked first before adding to the recipie ). This uses a *big* pot ( 2plbs of corn is a LOT ! ), and as a previous reviewer said, don't add water to the mush till you've added it to the beef. Mine was too wet so I just kept it on a low simmer to cook down a bit. Too much heat will burn/stick the mush to the bottom of the pot.

A caveat - it's 4 forks with the changes below. It gets highest marks for a delicious, unusual flavor, for being low fat and full of beans and vegetables, and for being relatively quick. I used 4 times as much salt and cilantro, broad beans instead of fava, and Yukon Gold potatoes instead of yuca (no yuca on hand). Be sure to wait until after adding the mush before you see if you need to add more water. Finally, the stew needed about 30 minutes more cooking before the beef was tender.
