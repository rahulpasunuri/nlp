On a recent trip to June Lake, we stopped for lunch at Whiskey Creek in Bishop where we had bowls of their soup of the day: smoked clam chowder. It was so delicious that I requested the recipe, which makes 15 gallons. Hmmm... I found this recipe here on Epi, which is nearly identical, but a manageable quantity, and very delicious!! Will be making this many times during winter.

We actually went to the Budd Bay Cafe and had this chowder last year and loved it. Then while researching through back issues for another recipe I stumbled upon the recipe and just had to try it at home. It was just as good as we remembered it but the Epicurious recipe leaves out one key ingredient that really makes this chowder exceptional. At the restaurant they come around with a bottle of cream sherry and ask if you would like a little on your chowder and if you do, they pour about a teaspoon onto the top of your chowder. Just before serving I stirred a couple of tablespoons of cream sherry into the chowder. Wow! What a difference in taste it made! Now I wouldn't dream of making this without adding the sherry at the end.

C'mon, kids... just melt a quarter pound of butter and suck it down. Getcha a can of SNOWS clam chowdah, a can of SNOWS chopped or minced clams, fresh ground peppah, half TBS of buttah, gahlick,and simmah, simmah, simmah. Parsley for gahnish. You'll nevah know the difference and it's cheapah...ay-yeh. (As told to me by a New England Yankee Cheapie.... he was right, too!) There's a depression on, ya know.

The flavor of this soup is not bad but using whipping cream as the base ruins it for me. To greasy. I would just use the spices in your favorite recipe. Also 6 jars of clam juice is very expensive at over $2.00 a bottle plus 4 cans of clams at over $2.00/can this soup turns out to be quite expensive for home made.

I wanted a healthy clam chowder, so I eliminated most of the saturated fat by substituting an equal amount of Smart Balance for the butter--and a combination of fat-free condensed milk, fat-free sour creme and powdered milk in lieu of the whipping cream and whole milk. Worked fine. Instead of just canned clams, I combined littleneck clams that I had smoked on my own. The fresh-cooked clams provide better taste and texture, and I will use them exclusively next time.

I've made this a few times, and it's always a big hit. I make the day before, and heat in a crock pot for a party. Great chowder!

Very good and easy. I was leary of the spices so I went light on them, next time I will add as the recipe suggests. I made the day before and served at a party it got great reviews! Also froze leftovers and found out it freezes well. If no liquid smoke is in cubard, bacon would do well.

Just made a pot of this! Different twist on the usual clam chowder. I added a little chopped bacon when sauteing the vegetables. Takes the chill off a cold day! Will make again!

Wonderful chowder plus it is quick & easy to make. A wonderful blend of spices & the liquid smoke is the clincher for this recipe!! Enjoy!!
