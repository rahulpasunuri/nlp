Will never make it again. Fiance ate couple morsles of squid and didn't touch it again. I guess he will be going to be hungry. I thought it was okay if maybe it was meat and not squid. - never again -sorry

Nice work,the flavours were clean and strong,I used U-5 tubes cleaver scored criss cross which added to the presentation,it's nice when they look like pine cones.

This dish was okay, but didnt cut the fishy flavor of the squid. I would probably throw in some lemon next time.
