My kids and I modified this to slice the potatoes thinly and made rosemary and thyme potato chips. They love it!

Simple and delicious. I used the coffee grinder to mince the thyme and rosemary so along with the garlic I put thru the press, it became like a pesto for the potatoes. Very quick prep.

I thought these were really tasty...I chopped them up and baked them on 450 for about 25-30 minutes, and then broiled them for about 5 minutes. They were perfectly crispy. They definitely could have used some salt and I could have used more thyme and rosemary, but overall they were tasty and easy to make!

Not bad for a quick side dish. If you want to use up any left over herbs, this is the recipe.

Excellent! I'm not a rosemary fan, so I used fresh sprigs of thyme and oregano. Halfway through I added baby carrots, sliced onion and chopped yellow bell pepper. I got rave reviews.

I made this recipe as a side with roast chicken, and I found it to be a great pairing. I used a mix of red and gold potatoes which made for a very pretty presentation and a mix of subtle flavors.

If you're going to have a grill on to cook the chops, put the potatoes in a roasting pan and roast them on the grill. That's how I've been roasting and they come out crunchy and caramelized. Yum.

The potatoes were nice and crunchy, but the herb flavor that I was looking for was not there. As a recipe idea, this is good. As a recipe itself - not so much. Amounts would have been better for this fledgling in the kitchen.

We've been roasting cut red-skinned potatoes this way for years. Vary the spices as you wish - herbs de provence are a nice change. Instead of a baking sheet, we place a 12" skillet in the oven to preheat, then add the potatoes so they'll sizzle and not stick to the pan.
