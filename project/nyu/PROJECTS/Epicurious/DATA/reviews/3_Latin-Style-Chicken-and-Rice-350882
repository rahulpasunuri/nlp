DROP DEAD DELISH! If I could give this more forks I would; this recipe is fabulous. I'm sorry that I didn't double this, because it's all gone. I took the advice of reviewers and subbed beans for peas, otherwise followed recipe.

This dish has a delicate, delicious flavor. The rice and chicken came out perfect. The rice had a buttery smoothness to it, and the chicken was tender. I took the skin off before cooking. I didn't use oil, just butter. I used white basmati rice.

I really like this recipe. I think it has great flavor, and it is a delicious, comforting dish. I found it online here, because I am not sure which magazine it was in and I wanted to make it again. I am not sure about the comments stating it has no flavor, etc. It is a mild dish, but has great layers of flavor.

This comes out as a rather nasty half cooked Risotto. I'd suggest others pass this one by.

It took me making it twice to realize what I didn't like about this recipe. It's name makes me think I'm going to get Arroz con Pollo but the ingredients are more like Paella (minus everything that makes Paella good). It isn't really that great a dish for kids, at least not for my kid. It lacks flavor, and my child doesn't like peas. To make this good for kids or adults, add chorizo, artichoke hearts, roasted peppers, some seafood, and make Paella. OR make a more Mexican Arroz con Pollo, with green chiles, etc. Probably better to just find a new, better recipe!

Good idea but needs work. For starters, you really do not need skin on chicken. In my opinion, it's pointless. You lose the crispness of the skin when you cover the dish to simmer. Plus chicken thighs are rich enough as it is... there's no need to add more fat. I pulled my out and took off the skin as soon as I realized that the skin was just going to get soggy and add nothing to the dish. I returned them back to the pot skinless and I'm much happier with the result than I would have been had I left them in with skin on. However, there IS an overwhelming need to add more *flavor*. This dish is really, really bland on it's own. So if you're making this for a household without kids please do yourself a favor and increase/add spices. I added cumin and coriander and more salt & pepper than called for and it still could have used a boost. Aside from that it's a pretty easy, comforting dish. I'll make it again but with additional adjustments in spice.

I'm just about to make the dish. Don't we need some roasted red bell peppers in this? Closer to paella. Way more garlic.

Thanks Gina for this recipe! I didn't have the saffron, but instead I used tomato and a bit of ground comino. My husband really enjoy the rice.

Very easy and delicious. Amped up the seasoning as others suggested with a little cumin and red pepper flakes. Only drawback, the serving temperature of the dish isn't hot. After removing from the heat,you add the frozen peas and wait 15 mins.. By then, the dish cools noticably. One thought for next time is to put in a low heat oven until ready to serve.

As I don't generally have saffron around I made this dish with packaged "yellow" rice. Still used the bay leaf and since i don't love peas I used frozen corn. Pretty awesome!

This was good. Full of fat but still good. It took me about an hour with chopping and stepping over children. I'll make this again but def not often.

This was exactly as stated--a simple kid friendly, quick dinner. I didn't have any saffron so I used about half a teaspoon of cumin (for a latin flavor). The little crunchy bits of rice on the bottom were addicting! I would definitely make this again for a week night dinner.

I liked this recipe. The rice with the onions and peas was really good. Other reviewers complained that the dish was bland. The author was trying for a dish that that appealed to kids as well as adults. That said, and not having children, I used much more garlic (as usual) that the recipe called for and I doubled the amount of saffron. And I can't stress this enough: please use thigh meat with skin and bones. The rendered fat from the skin will add flavor and the dark meat is naturally more flavor-filled than bland breast meat. This is easy to prepare and great for picnics and potlucks.

After reading the reviews, I decided to make this because I was looking for an easy midweek dinner. The reviews were right about the dish lacking in flavor, but if you're looking for a quick one pot meal, this is a good place to start. I used chicken breasts instead of thighs for a less fatty dish.

this receipe is just okay. my husband and i found it to be bland. if, i ever make it again, i'll add some heat to the chicken. i am a fan of peas and rice and that part of the dish is very good.

For some reason, this recipe was pretty good the first night, but really seemed to lose its kick overnight. Had to use lots of Sirancha sauce to make it worthwhile. Would recommend more spice.

This was really not very good. In fact, it tasted like camp food, the dehydrated dishes we cook over a camp stove while hiking. Okay, but for the time it took, there are a million better dishes. The only changes I made were I added a hot pepper to the cooking onion and a little sweet smoky paprika.

This recipe is nothing special. It is okay, the chicken turned out pretty good - very juicy. I'll probably toss most of the rice and save the chicken to use in enchiladas.

The previous review which suggested the addition of adobo was genius - it absolutely made the dish! I also doubled the amount of rice and liquid to have extra for leftovers.

I made this with a bit more garlic, a few more bay leaves, some adobo powder, 1.5# of boneless chicken breast and threw in a jalapeno and some carrots. I love this dish and just can't get enough. I pack it up and take it to work for lunch the next day.

This was wonderfully easy to make; the chicken was moist and tender. I considered the other reviewer's suggestions, but decided not to make any alterations. It wasn't flat or bland or boring, in my opinion - but it also wasn't terribly impressive. Great for a weeknight meal - but not something I would serve to guests.

We like our food with a bit of a kick, and I was afraid this recipe would be a little bland so I added more garlic and used a "hot and spicy" garlic olive oil which has some cayenne it in.

This is a pretty good basic recipe, but it needs something to make it a little more interesting. I added half a teaspoon of sweet smoked paprika, and it still was a little plain. Maybe some olives or roasted peppers?
