I had lots of tomatoes and lots of mint....this was perfect. I didn't include the onions, but the other ingredients came together nicely.

Completely simple but surprisingly delicious. Was not convinced about the mint and that the flavors would come together with layering and a drizzle of vinegar & olive oil. It worked really well and the mint was wonderful -- just gave it a fresh taste. Key was soaking the onion and letting the dish sit for a while at room temperature. The only change I made was adding a bit more olive oil & vinegar. Will definitely make again. (I'm not giving 4 stars only because I can't rate a layered tomato salad "beyond compare")

Loved the combination of flavors. I know people hate to hear "I loved it but I completely changed the recipe" ... in my case, I thought I had Red Wine Vinegar but did not. I used balsamic instead (works for Caprese). I know this would taste great with Red Wine Vinegar as well.

I used Heirloom Tomatoes instead of just reds and it added a whole new depth to this recipe. However when I went to get the Red Onion I found that my husband had abducted it for a recipe the night before. Red Onions add a great counterpoint of flavor to this recipe but it is still very enjoyable without them. Leftovers do not keep well so try to only make as much as will be used.
