TIP from Southern New Mexico - Northern New Mexican food is not even remotely close enough to compete with Southern New Mexican food, and Hatch green chile is a MUST! The comment "Squeeze them through your fingers, a handful at a time so that the chiles are crushed and stringy." WHAT? This is NOT traditional for New Mexico, nor does it make a darn bit of difference! If you really want New Mexican food the way it should be, stick to Southern New Mexian recipes! Also, any recipe that calls for surgar or fruit is NOT New Mexican traditional!

We really enjoyed this stew. We will definitely make it again. I didn't have access to New Mexico green chilies. but used roasted bell peppers and 1/4 tsp cayenne instead. I also browned the meat. At the end of cooking I thought it needed a little thickening, so I used 1/2 cup cornmeal mixed with 1/2 cup boiling water.

loved this... I was recently in santa fe and wanted to use the green chiles I brought back -- agreed with some of the othere that a few modifications need to be made... I browned the pork with the onions and garlic . I used Chicken stock instead of the water and hominy instead of the potatoes... yum!

Very tasty and easy recipe. My only suggestion is to add a bit more salt, otherwise it is lacking.

Tip from Northern NM: Don't chop the roasted, peeled and seeded chiles before you cook the stew. Squeeze them through your fingers, a handful at a time so that the chiles are crushed and stringy. It makes a big difference in the diffusion of the flavor. This is traditional in Northern NM.

I started with green enchilada sauce out of a can...before I get yelled at, let me explain that it was "clean out the pantry and fridge day," and I always challenge myself to use what I have on hand. Had potato, a frozen pork tenderloin, the green sauce...also had a lot of shallots, celery and red onion, which I chopped up with some great organic grean beens. Added toasted cumin, chili powder and allspice, plus another can of chopped green pepper. Cooked in a slow cooker for 8 hours. Result...less in the pantry and freezer and more wonderful food on the plate.

Ummm....Los Gatos,why would you bother making a traditional New Mexican dish like green chili stew without the green chilis??? That's like making fried chicken using pork... Anyway, I love green chili stew, but I use the Pink Adobe recipe, although I add potatoes to it. It's much better with fresh, roasted peeled and seeded peppers, and the potatoes help to thicken it. Also I think it tastes better with the meat browned first. Anyway, Reuel, think I'll take a page from your recipe book, and go make beef enchiladas with tofu and white bread!

Day 1: OK, I changed it, a lot. I used 3 lbs cubed pork shoulder, onion, shallots, garlic, smoked ham hock, 2 cans "lower sodium" beef broth and 4 chipotles in adobo. No potatoes, no green chilis. It's in the fridge. I'll defat it tomorrow and serve over rice. I sampled the meat and it is delicious. So many changes that it's only just related to the original, still worth writing about... Day 2: just served it over white jasmine rice and I am upgrading from 3 forks to 4. This is good!

Albuq. NM - worked in a working-man's restaurant(no tourists)as a cook while at U.N.M. We also used chicken stock vs.water, oregano, peeled & chopped RIPE tomatoes, chopped celery, water from ham hocks slow-cooked overnight-cover,ham base, and bacon drippings. Sold 3-4 hundred gallons daily!!!! -- We had huge take-out window traffic. I later spent many great years working as a professionally trained chef..

I did the typical thing and left the potatoes out and added posole corn. Much better flavor mix with the corn and green chilies, than the potatoe and green chilies. Make potatoe salad with potatoes, or mashed....green chilie goes better with corn products. Way to go. AZ/NM native

I made this recipe twice. The 1st time I followed the recipe and it was too bland for our taste. 2nd time I used just enough potatoes to thicken the stew (very few!) I also lightly tossed the pork in flour seasoned with Old Bay and browned the meat 1st over med-high heat before adding the rest of the ingredients. I also used chicken stock instead of water and added a large pinch of cumin, some thyme, coriander and pepper. 2nd time around we scooped up this stew with fresh homemade flour tortillas in place of so many potatoes. It was soooo much better the 2nd time around!
