I didn't have any white wine, so I used red. Also, didn't have any onions so I used a bag of frozen petite onions (next time I'll use 2 bags). Also, I used beef stock instead of water and added 1 T of flour with the herbs for a thicker sauce. It was delicious!

Made as suggested with one variation: after removing the roast, I allowed the fat to rise to the top of the onion sauce and removed most. Then used an immersion blender until sauce had a smooth consistancy. Reduced the resulting sauce to about 2/3 volume to thicken. Excellent flavors and still plenty of gravy left at the end.

Very good and very easy! I used beef stock instead of water for more flavor, and added a touch of demi glace as well. Especially good the next day, so if you can make ahead, all the better -- especially because you can get rid of the fat more easily after it's been in the fridge. Like another reviewer, I pureed the onion sauce for a smooth gravy. Had tons of sauce to spare and froze it for another use with beef. Next-day sandwiches were terrific.

I separated the meat and the sauce and then pureed the sauce. I added Parmesan cheese and basil to the puree and poured it over couscous. DELICIOUS! I used the cooked meat to make beef stroganoff.

This is delicious as written. Mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Perfection for a winter meal, but a cool rainy spring day calls for it too.

Delicious! I made this in the crockpot (didn't brown the meat before hand)... put the beef in the pot, seasoned it with salt and pepper (skipped the oil), smeared 1 small can of tomato paste over it, added 2 cups beef broth (no wine) & the thyme/rosemary/onions/garlic - and then cooked it on high until it was falling apart.

This is my new favorite pot roast recipe. By giving the onions some additional time to saute,they added a carmalized touch. The meat was super tender, and because it cooks in the oven instead of on the stove top, it's super easy. Loved it.

This wasn't too bad but different than what I really like for a pot roast. I think the left over roast will make a great sandwich. I served with a salad and mushroom risotto

I made this with moose meat last night and it was amazing! We had a 2ish pound rump roast and I followed the recipe almost exactly. I cut everything in half, except for the liquid and the garlic, which I kept the same. Plus we were out of tomato paste, so I used an organic ketchup! I cooked it the same amount of time too. Served over egg noodles with steamed kale, it was a fabulous dinner that even my 2.5 year old devoured!

Melt in your mouth tender! Will definitely make again. My chuck roast was just over 2.5 pounds so I adjusted seasonings a bit and cut back on time; cooked for just over 2 hours. Also, because I was making for my parents, who don't drink, I used 3/4 cup beef broth, 3/4 cup water, and only 1/2 cup red wine for my braising liquid. It was perfect.

An amazing winter meal.....

Rating: 4
The white wine separates this recipe from the pack; if sufficiently dry, the resulting flavors are tangy rather than the sweet flavors one usually gets from braising in red wine. I think this makes for a lighter and more unusual dish, suitable to spring and fall. Otherwise, this is a standard recipe, with nothing tricky about it; easy to make, and great for leftovers.

This is great for a Sunday dinner! I used an Imperial Stout beer instead of wine, and added potatoes and carrots. Next time I will add some flour or corn starch at the end to thicken the sauce.

I made this last week on the recommendation of a friend. I took suggestions from other reviews and used red wine instead of white. I used a little extra garlic, too. At the end, I added some water with cornstarch to thicken the sauce. This was fabulous and my husband loved it.

Very tender but not much taste. I used red wine instead of white. I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans. I can see where a noodle lover would love this over a pile of noodles. But it didn't stand up well on its own. Won't make again.

Easy and fills the room with a Sunday afternoon/cold winter night home aroma. Made it with red wine instead of the white wine and tomato paste. Sauteed red potatoes quartered with the onions and added them to the braising. Delicious and very easy and quick to make, as others have said.

Delicious. Simple to make. I love dishes like this that you can walk away from. I made this on a whim and it was fantastic. Very tender, very flavorful. Everyone loved it. I served it with mashed potatoes and roasted green beans for a nice, warming fall dinner. As for the reviewer from Massachusetts, perhaps you didn't understand the recipe. The meat was supposed to braise. If you cut down the cooking time, it never has a chance to break down and become tender. Never cook a braised recipe for less than the time allotted.

I did this in the crock pot on high for about six hours, and it was fantastic. I thought white wine sounded odd, but it's s Gourmet recipe, so I trusted it. I used La Bastarda and was very pleased with the results. I also ended up using rump roast because of the pricing and weight.

This recipe sucked. I had grass fed beef and everything organic, and when it was done, it was totally a waste of time and money. I don't know what the people who gave this thing a positive review were thinking. It was too oily, and I only used a tablespoon; the meat was also overdone and leathery, and I cooked it for less than the time alloted.

Rating: 4
It takes a little prep to get the roast into the oven, but once it's in there you're pretty much done for a couple hours. When it comes out, you'll get raves and it'll appear that you worked so much harder than you did. The results are truly amazing every time! My husband gives me a standing ovation for this one... it's a winner and perfect for company.

Great recipe. First time making pot roast and this came out better than my Grandmother's traditional dry recipe! The first step really seals in the juices, so I made sure to really get a nice crisp exterior. Used lots of wine instead of water. And used frozen chopped onions. Also, used a small can of v-8 instead of tomato paste. It turned out moist and juicy! I can see how this basic recipe could be used with some more easy variations. Yeah!

Delicious and super easy. This will definitely be my go-to recipe for pot roast. I only had 1.5 vidalia onions around and it seemed like plenty. Also used red wine instead of the white since I had a bottle already open. Can't wait to make this again!

really yummy, very simple to prepare. Used a smaller roast, just under 3 lbs. so shorter cooking time. Used full recipe for sauce, though, the kids ate it up without hesitation

Wonderfully popular roast. I made a few alterations. Doubled the liquids for more gravy. Used 'Better than Boulion-beef' with the water for a richer sauce. Used Hawaii sweet onions because I had no yellow onions. My roast was 2.2 kg so I cooked it longer too. About 5 hrs. I used 6 fresh sprigs of rosemary but in hindsight I should have wrapped them up in cheesecloth because the leaves all fell off the sprigs and were distributed through the sauce so rather than straining the onions and stuff I just pureed it with my hand blender. This made the sauce silky smooth and without the rosemary leaves as an annoyance. Great recipe.

Rating: 3
What I love most about this recipe is that almost every ingredient on the list can be found in your pantry! I pretty much followed to the "t" except for using beef broth rather than water. The roast was so tender and delish! Next time, I will double the liquids so I can get more sauce! A keeper for sure! Oh, why not 4 forks? This dish is very good, but not mind blowing, so I think 3 is fair! ;-)

I wouldn't change a thing with this recipe! The white wine gives this pot roast an exceptional flavor, lighter than that of red. I loved it!!

I made this recipe a few times but reduced the sauce and thickened it with beurre manie before serving taking care not to leave clumps and not to break apart the onions. Remove the meat and mix some of the liquid into the beurre manie until smooth and then mix into the pot. Return meat to pot to warm through. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Good for a chuck roast, 2.5 forks. I took suggestions and used beef broth and red wine as liquids with good results. I used fresh herbs, just putting branches of thyme in (stems may always be removed after braising), but snipping the rosemary. Added a fresh bay leaf as well. Served with buttered parsley'd broad egg noodles.

Rating: 2
The beef is good, but all the liquid in this recipe draws out a lot of the beef flavor into the resulting broth. I strained the broth and chilled it in the fridge overnight, then discarded the congealed fat layer. I saved the onions which I strained from the broth. After separating the fat from the broth, I combined the broth and onions again. This became a good "French Onion Soup". If not for this use of the broth & onions, I wouldn't make this again.

Rating: 3
This recipe was tender and full of flavor. Per the suggestions in the reviews, I was sure to sauté the onions until golden brown, almost caramelized. I substituted red wine. I didnt have any beef broth on hand, so I used a can of diced tomatoes. The left over juices made a slightly sweet and delicious sauce to pure over the meat.

I have made this recipe several times and it is nothing short of fabulous. The simplicity of the recipe is part of what makes the dish extraordinary. So few ingredients are used and yet, produce ultra luxurious flavors and textures that will melt in your mouth and leave you thinking about it for days. Actually, when the weather starts to get crisp and the last days of summer are behind us, I find myself looking excitedly at my Dutch oven and smile knowing that I will be cooking this incredible recipe again soon.

This recipe is superb! I read all the reviews and made a few more changes. Made the first time just as recipe states, but 2nd time made some changes. Doubled the sauce - it is fantastic. Used a dry red wine in place of white wine and substituted canned beef broth for the water. However did NOT double the onions and it was the most fantastic sauce over noodles. My family says that this is the ONLY pot roast recipe that they want from this day forward.

Here is the mistake I made . . . and corrected, that is the key element of this recipe. Take your time with the onions and uses good ones, the sweeter the better. If you just "sweat" them instead of getting a good brown carmelization, most of the flavor is lost. Red wine instead of white adds even more . . . Getting a good sear on the meat, even more!

Rating: 2
you know, i was a little nervous to make this after reading the reviews, but i can usually make a recipe turn out okay. this one, however, although not bad, was just not great. it was a little dry for my taste, and the gravy was nothing to write home about. take my advice and save yourself the time and the energy: this recipe is just not worth it for the true gourmand.

I think the reviewers who did not like this recipe didn't cook the onions long enough before adding the liquid. I have prepared this several times, always using white wine but substituting beef broth for water. The gravy was dark and luscious every time. I also doubled the herbs. It has become the most requested meal in our house.

Every pot roast I made prior to this has been awful, but this roast was delicious and perfect comfort food for a cold winter night. I did substitute red wine for the white wine, beef broth for water, doubled the fresh herbs and put it in a crock pot after browning the meat and cooking the onions. Yes, you read that correctly, a crock pot. Served it over wide egg noodles and I think I encouraged my guests to get reacquainted with their crock pots.

I'm a big fan of braising and slow cooking and so I was excited to make this recipe. I was skeptical that it was white wine and water to make the broth and I was right to be - this is the most bland recipe I've ever made. I also think the photo in Gourmet was extremely misleading - there is no way they got that dark sauce making the recipe as published.

This is delicious! After 3 hours of cooking, the meat was so tender, it just fell apart. (No need to cook the last time at 350.) Perfect for a cold, rainy night w/ mashed potatoes and steamed asparagus. Like others, we doubled all seasonings (tomato paste, garlic, fresh herbs) and substitued Cabernet and beef broth for white wine and water. This is better than my mother's roast -- and that's a real compliment!

Two forks because the recipe as-written needs a lot of punching up to address its blandness (but perhaps I am just used to more seasoned food) Doubled the seasonings, tomato paste, etc., used red wine and beef broth and still it was missing something. A little worcestershire sauce (couldn't think of anything else) helped make it more savory.

I too followed the suggestions from the previous reviews - and my family loved it! It is very similiar to a beef daube made with short ribs. The meat was very flavorful, if a little tough.

I mashed them with evoo instead of butter.

Even with the changes suggested by other reviewers, I wasn't that impressed with this recipe. It just didn't have the spark I expected (even though the beef was quite good). I pureed the sauce to make a gravy and served it with potatoes and yorkshire puddings, but you know, Joy of Cooking's Beef Daube coverted to a roast instead of a stew would be better.

I too didn't read the reviews before I made this last night. I doubled the garlic and upped the herbs and tomato paste; served with rice.

While not a show-stopper it is definately something I will serve again and again during winter months.

I brought the magazine in from the mailbox, saw the cover photo, read the recipe, ran to the store and prepared this very tasty dish for dinner that night. My only change was tripling the garlic.

After reading the only review of this dish, I doubled the onion, tripled the garlic, used 4T of fresh rosemary and 4 T of fresh thyme as well as 4 T of tomato paste, and instead of white wine I used a decent merlot with no water and deglazed the pan with cognac before sauteeing the onions. The dish turned out pretty tasty, but I made enough changes that it's very likely not the same recipe. I think it would have been extraordinarily bland as written. Haven't tried the salad yet, but I shall, with the leftovers.
