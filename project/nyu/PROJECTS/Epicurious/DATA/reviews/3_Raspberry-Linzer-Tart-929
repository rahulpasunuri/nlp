I didn't have a tart pan and so used a cake pan - BIG mistake. There was way too much dough, and it was too thick, with barely room for the filling. The raspberries basically roasted on top of the chocolate filling. But interestingly, it tasted alright. I thought the concept was fine, having made Linzer cookies all last winter. What's wrong with chocolate and cinnamon anyway? This was fine the first day, but leftovers are kind of bleh.

Linzer tarts with chocolate? And the patry should be made with white sugar, not brown sugar; also should be made with egg yolks to obtain that characteristic texture of a Linzer tart, not a whole egg! This recipe is so different from a traditional version that it should not be called a Linzer tart.

From the reviews that I read I thought this would be great. But, it was not at all. It was flat,dry and I kept re reading the recipe to be sure that it was made right. Very very disappointing. I gave it one fork but it really deserved a zero.

This dessert for us was not too sweet, which is nice. I did not like the combination of the cinnamon crust with the chocolate layer - this was the only disagreable part to taste. Made for wonderful presentation for the holidays!!!!

The tart was really nice, never set properly though. I made the crust with hazelnuts rather than almonds. Very rich and very sweet ... I think if I made it again I wouldn't use normal raspberry jam on top as it made it sickly sweet.

I made this last year to take to friend's house at Christmas. People went crazy! Everyone loved it and am making it tomorrow to take to a party. It is a great presentation. The filling didn't seem to set until firm, but it didn't matter once people tasted the tart. I'm going to bake it a little longer tomorrow. Will definitely make again.

My family have made the classic Linzertorte for years. This is a pretty good version of it, but I perfer it without the chocolate. I simply son't like th combination of a cinnamon crust and chocolate. Another variation we do is to follow the directions given except use an equal weight of white sugar instead of brown in the crust. Add 1-2 teaspoons lemon zest to the dough. Then instead of raspberries and raspberry jam, fill the torte with lemon curd (either home made or found with jams & jellies in the grocery store). Bake as directed and dusted with powder sugar.

I am a novice at making tarts and pies so I was more than a little nervous at making this tart. But it turned out perfectly! Well received by all! The only substitution I made was using one-inch cookie stars for the top (the recipe called for two-or three-inch stars)but the stars still helped make a dramatic presentation. I will make this recipe again.

Normally, I hate the pairing of fruit and chocolate-- but this was delicious, not to mention very attractive presentation-wise. I could not find seedless jam, and I don't think it mattered at all. I would not let this one sit out a while though-- I made it the night before and when we ate it the next day the crust was kind of hard. Oh well, still delicious, and easy.
