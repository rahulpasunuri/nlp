I was searching for an autumnal recipe for a potluck brunch - this is perfect. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice or ginger so used a mixture of cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. It is delicious though not a healthy dish - butter, oil, oy.

An outstanding side dish! This is quite easy to make (and if you prepare the potatoes and onions the night before, final prep is quick and easy). In addition to a Thanksgiving side, this also makes a delicious and crowd-pleasing brunch dish.

The dish was easy to make and very tasty. I used white onions and they gave the pleasant bite to offset the sweetness of the potatoes. We served this dish with ham for Christmas dinner.

I thought this was good and I will probably make it again since it's quick, easy, and made of ingredients I always have around. I used vegetable oil instead of butter and reduced the sugar. I agree with the previous reviewer that it would be better if the yams were roasted to caramelize them.

I had this dish as part of the complete Country Thanksgiving menu from the November issue. I like it. I didn't make it though, but I hear it was time consuming. I would say it is a keeper for a side dish, but not a legit replacement for mash potatoes at a T-day dinner

I'm not a fan of this recipe. I usually roast yams and let them carmelize on their own. For me, the addition of lots of sugar tasted unnatural and steaming/boiling didn't bring out the yams' natural sweetness. Theoretically it is a nice combination (at least to me). I will try it again, but probably with roasting cubed yams and then quickly sauteeing with the onions in some duck fat.
