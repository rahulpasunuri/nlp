I thought this was very good and it was very easy to prepare. I made the components in advance and assembled right before serving so that the pastry wouldn't get soggy. I think this would work with lots of other fruits, but the mango certainly was a treat!

So good that we cannot stop eating this. I made it recently for out of town guests and they thought it was spectacular. Having it for a family meal is perfect!!

Very delicious and quite easy. I made it a few hours before serving and it kept well in the refrigerator.

This dessert was unbelievably easy and delicious. I think the reviewer from Washington DC must have used phyllo dough, becaues puff pastry doesn't have layers and doesn't need anything other than an egg wash before baking. The cream cheese mixture was so good...it tasted like cheesecake! I will be making this tart again --- the base (dough and cheese mixture) are perfect for any combination of fruity flavors. I can't wait to try it out again!

HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! The crust was incredibly dry. If you are going to make this, you NEED to add butter between each layer of puff pastry, and on top. The middle layers of dough were RAW when I served it, and the dough was disgusting. Honestly, just serve the mango with the cheese topping, or use a pie crust.

Made this with my 14 year old daughter - a very easy, lovely and delicious presentation. 15 minutes was just right for me. I let the pastry cool for several hours before spreading the cream and did not have problem with a soggy base. I would prick the inner rectangle deeper so that it does not puff up after baking. This recipe is a keeper!

I don't know why everyone likes this so much. My guests and I thought it tasted horrible! I definitely will not be making this again

This rcipe was great especially with the addition of an extra tablespoon of cream cheese like an earlier eviewer suggested. When you score the puff pastry though, make it a little deep. Mine was shallow, and my poor puff pastry looked a little strange. Also, 15 minutes was too long for the oven. Mine became dark brown rather than golden. I'll have to watch it better next time.

This is simple, delicious, and has become my official mango-season dessert. It's so beautiful, people are almost reluctant to eat it. . .until they devour it! I modified the filling using soft, light cream cheese and 2 Tbl. plain lowfat yogurt instead of sour cream. My crust holds up, even when I make the tart several hours ahead and refrigerate until serving. It's hard to the zestlimes here, which have very tight skin, so I toss my mango with a teaspoon of lime juice instead. My kids enjoy folding the sliced mango.

This recipe is a fantastic way to use up mangoes that are on their last leg. I've made it probably 3 times now and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe. In order to bring down the calorie content, I substituted fat-free sour cream and cream cheese, and it was still excellent. I also used a bit more mango, and upped the cream cheese just a bit to provide a stiffer, less liquid base. This tart is great.

I have prepared this dessert about a dozen times. Its easy to prepare and is delicious and light. I find that a tablespoon more of cream cheese keeps the the tart from becoming soggy. Also, chilling the tart keeps it from becoming soggy.

This was a quick and easy dessert for a hot summer night. I thought it was rather good but my husband didn't care for the sauce at all. Definately recommend assembling at the last moment to prevent the crust from becoming soggy.

This recipe is superb if eaten as the recipe suggests, immediately. I took to a picnic, and while it tasted great, I thought that the filling was a little too moist for travel. I will definately make it again for home, however for on a picnic I would try adding more cheese.

I used two different kinds of phylo for this dish and both were wonderful, the lighter layered one (as opposed to the thicker pastry) presented really well. I did add raspberries and small Ontario wild blueberries for colour and interest and this was particularly tasteful and pretty. It is best to add the sauce and fruit just before serving to ensure that everything stays crisp and fresh.

Delicious and easy. Made this for a baby shower - presentation was lovely and very very delicious.
