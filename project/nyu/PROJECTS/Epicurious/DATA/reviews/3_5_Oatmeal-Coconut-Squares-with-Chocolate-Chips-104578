Super easy and darn tasty. I added a bit of dried currants and used Amaretto instead of vanilla. Nothing fancy but totally delicious. Making again soon!

Agree with previous reviews, needs some additions. Adjusted for high altitude, doubled the vanila,added zest of half a small lemon, 1/2 cup walnuts, switched to butterscotch chips, toasted the nuts & coconut, added cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. A good place to start

Boring. Needs lots more chocolate chips and coconut for flavor. Easy to make.

Easy and quite good. I added toasted almonds and "frosted" the squares with melted choco chips. Did not use foil - just sprayed the pan. I will definitely make again and maybe even add some dried cranberries next time.

Dry, crumbly, and bland. The old- fashioned oatmeal is too tough to chew. Maybe quick oats would be better.

I've made this recipe tons of times, and there are several modifications I like to make to make it slightly more "healthy" so I can eat it as a breakfast bar and not feel so bad! I sub buckwheat flour for all-purpose, add toasted walnuts, wheat bran, and flax seeds, and I sub canola oil for 1/2 the butter. And I always double the recipe and use a glass 9x13 pan lightly oiled. Undercook it a little at 25 min for the double batch - YUM!!

Great recipe. It is easy - in time, ingredients and effort - with delectable results. I used unsweetened coconuts, very finely ground (from whole foods)Fabulous!

Delicious but too hard.

This is a lunchbox staple at our house; kids love them. I always double the recipe and bake it in a 7x11 pyrex (as written the recipe makes a flat batch that are a little too crispy) and bake for about half an hour; they're perfect. I never bother with the foil, just use cooking spray. A kid can make these in a matter of minutes. Yum!

This was so easy and delicious. I followed a reviewer's suggestion and used a 8 X 8 greased pyrex pan (with no foil) and baked for 27 minutes. They were moist and chewy and easy to cut into bars. I might use half the sugar next time. This one's a keeper.

This is the easiest and quickest recipe I own. I always use it if I need something in a hurry (guest coming over, last minute gathering, etc). I always get many compliments when I make it. I've tried playing with the recipe and haven't found any improvements. It's perfect as it is...

These tasted fine, but were so crumbly that they completely fell apart. What I wound up with would make a great streusel topping, but that's about it.

These were very good, but I recommend using an 8x8 pan instead of a 9x9, especially if you prefer thicker, chewier cookies.

These are absolutely fabulous! I will use this recipe many times.

This has been a HUGE hit with my kids. I substituted whole wheat flour and used extra fibre oatmeal and left out the coconut (didn't up the other ingredients) and it was fabulous! The recipe also doubled really well.

Pretty good.I normally reduce the sugar amount in all recipes, but this one didn't need to. T'was the right sweetness based on oat-flour-sugar proportion. I'm generally not a big fan of coconut but somehow the coconut here doesn't bother me. It makes the squares chewier, so don't omit it. If you like this combination and want something more "sophisticated', I highly recommend Oatmeal Coconut Raspberry Bars from this site.

Yum--easy and good. I made for guests who were bringing their young son--he loved them. Perfect kid food and perfect for adults who want to indulge in kid-like food.

Excellent Squares, and so quick and easy to make. I'm going to try some substitutions next time - whole wheat flour, nuts, dried fruit, etc.

Wonderful! My kids and husband loved these. Made them two days in a row and they are gone. I left out the coconut as no one likes it and added a bit more oatmeal and some wheat germ instead. Even put in a bit of wheat flour and they were still great and not heavy at all. Walnuts would be good too.

Yummy I made some a little while ago they didnt even get a chance to cool and they are gone!! At my 5 ,8 and 9 yr old daughters incessant pleading I've started the 2nd batch and my hubby wants to know how soon they will be done!!! forget cookies these are great!!

I thought these were lovely and chewy and will definately make them again - in fact, they went so quickly I'm going to make more again tonight - I took them to the office as a morning treat. I think the only reason they would be hard would be in they'd been left in the oven too long. I had to give the recipe to others in the office as they enjoyed these bars so much!!

I didn't like these bars at all. I renamed them boring bars. They were hard and tasteless. One little girl said that they tasted like granola. There are much better recipes for this type of bar.

This was really easy to make! I substituted the coconut with butterscotch chips (made them for a school bake sale, so no nuts!) and added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar. They were great!!

These were very yummy (they disappear within an evening!!!) and extremely easy to make. I added pecans (chopped)to this recipe which makes it even more tempting.

Not gourmet fare, perhaps, but this recipe is still a keeper. Good, homey bars that are just sweet enough and have an nice texture. They go together in no time flat to keep kids and spouse happy. My husband is not a chocolate chip fan, but he likes to have these on hand for a quick snack at the office. Definitely worth a try!

These cookies were good and easy to make. Not overwhelmingly sweet. I will make them again.

This was extremely easy to make, and quite tasty. I used unsweetened coconut (from Trader Joe's) and increased the brown sugar a bit and it was good.
