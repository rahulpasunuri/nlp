Fabulous. Made a written and really wouldn't change a thing. My guest's commented on the wonderful juicy, flavorful sliders. Adding this to my recipe box!

Made this for a Margaritaville Pary (Cheeseburger in Paradise...) and had RAVE reviews from all the party guests. Very fun and not too messy for indoors.
