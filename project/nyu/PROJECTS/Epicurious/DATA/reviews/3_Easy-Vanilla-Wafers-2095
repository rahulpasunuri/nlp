These came out excellent, we did a little change up on them however, using granulated splenda, vanilla, 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 milled flax as those eating them are diabetic...they were delicious.

What a waste of a Madagascar vanilla bean! These had NO depth of flavor and weren't crunchy enough or short enough. Seriously, save your money and time and make another recipe. These taste like lady fingers that had been through the washer. Also, the method used for vanilla sugar leaves a lot to be desired. Better to take the time, split the bean and let it sit in the sugar a couple of days. No matter how long I left the sugar in the processor, the bits of vanilla bean were too big. All around, a disaster of a recipe.

Wow, what a great cookie. I've made it time and time again and its always a hit. The edges are crispy and the interior of the cookie is perfectly chewy. Its a great light tasting cookie and an extremely simple recipe.

I loved this recipe. Very easy. I used a different vanilla sugar recipe (2 cups sugar, 1 tsp vanilla bake at 200 for 10mins or until dry). They were a big hit among all my guests.
