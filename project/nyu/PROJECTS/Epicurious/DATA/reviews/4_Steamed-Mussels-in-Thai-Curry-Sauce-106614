P.S. I forgot to mention that all the mussels were open in about 3 1/2 minutes. I didn't spoil them by leaving them for the additional 30 seconds.

Absolutely delicious. I'm playing bachelor for a few weeks while my wife is in Tulsa taking care of our daughter, so I bought myself a pound of mussels for dinner last night. Since I'm trying to lose weight, I served them over Jasmine rice, sprinkling the tomatoes and cilantro over everything. What a great combination. The rice absorbed the juice, and the mussels were extremely plump and sweet. With the rice, I could have used a little more of the Thai Red Curry, which I'll do next time.

This recipe is amazing! I more than doubled the curry paste - like WAY more! Everyone raved! I also didn't use the lemongrass, just zest of lemon and lime and the lime juice.

Yummy!!! I used about twice the amount of mussels that the recipe called for and still had tons of broth left over at the end. I'm planning to use the broth for a thai soup tomorrow. In terms of substitutions and changs, I used the lime juice and the lemon zest instead of the Kaffir lime leaves and the lemon grass. I also used about 3-4 times the amount of curry paste. It was delicious. Loved every second.

It didn't seem I could "edit" my review after posting, but I also wanted to add that I paired this dish with an off-dry riesling which suited it perfectly.

At my "regular" grocery store, I was able to find everything but kafir lime leaves (and followed the recipe's substitution); they stock lemongrass in the summer months, but I had to used prepared at this time. If you can find it, it really adds depth of flavor. I did find "red curry sauce" at the store, but it must not have been the same as "thai red curry paste". I added several tsp's, but it didn't seem to have much heat, however, it did impart a nice curry flavor. Even with the adjustments, I plan to tinker and make this again (and again!).

Delicious - I sauted some asparagus in the pan before adding the mussels - making it a delicious one pot meal.

Oh Baby! If I could bathe in it, I would! I followed the recipe for the most part. I did double the curry paste and sauteed it first in a little oil as another reviewer suggested. I also added about 3 cloves of smashed garlic. The kicker for me was that I used last night's roasted chicken carcass to make my own broth. After a generous pinch of kosher salet, I also added a little cornstarch toward the end to thicken it up a little bit. Used mussels, steamer clams and prawns.... DELISH! Skipped the tomatoes and cilantro at the end because it was PERFECT!

Love this recipe! I did double the red curry because we like spicy - well it was but it was still very good. I made the broth ahead of time and let it cool with the ingredients in it then I strained them and prepared as instructed. Next time I will look for fresh lemon grass but today I was too lazy to travel a couple blocks away to get it lol I just used lemon zest and extra lime juice. I feel the person who said there was no flavor may have meant no flavors that stood out. All the flavors worked very well together and played off each other very nicely - it was a very well-balanced sauce. Nothing was prominent (well, except all the extra chili paste I put in mine but I will make it again that way) so what was trying to say is everything blended very well. We served with sourdough bread and Champagne. I call it a hands-down winner and keeper.

I have made this recipe numerous times, but have always used steamers instead of mussels. Even people who don't like seafood love this dish. I served fresh sourdough bread with it and people just dipped their bread in the broth they loved it so much.

This was OK but nothing special. Something seemed to be lacking and the flavours were not well balanced. For a truly fantastic recipe try the Spicy Thai Steamed Mussels (Gourmet Aug/99)also from this site. That one is a real winner!

Something made the cooking liquid taste a bit bitter - not sure if it was the basil or lime. The liquid tasted appropriately spicy, but I didn't feel like the mussels picked up that much flavor from the cooking liquid, which was probably ok in this case. In search of a better Asian mussel dish.....

I found this to be a very bland dish. I even added more of the curry paste to try to spice it up. This was lacking something - not sure what.

I have made this twice now - I could not find lemongrass either time. The first time I made it with lemon zest as suggested, and found the finished product to be too citrus-y and too acidic (in comparison to a T.O restaurant's awesome version). I cut back on both the zest and the lime juice, and used a bit more curry the second time, and it was perfect.

This really was SUPER. I did leave out the lemongrass and lemon as I didn't have them on hand and it was still wonderful.

A great take on the French classic! I found adding a couple teaspoons of brown sugar rounded out the flavor nicely and added complexity to the dish. I served mine with rice and sauteed bok choy as a meal.

THIS IS AN EXCELLENT RECEIPE FOR THE MIDDLE OF A COLD AND LOMNG WINTER. REALLY WARM AND QUITE DELICIOUS.

We LOVE mussles and this recipe is really good. Maybe my curry paste is mild because I doubled it and it still was not that spicy, but had good curry flavor. Easy to make too. This one is a keeper.

This was great. Made for valentines day with the Thai cucumber salad and thai pork dumplings, both from this site. All were good. Substituted basil for the cilantro in this recipe as we like it better. Served over rice.

This is a fantastic recipe!!! I forgot to add the chicken stock and it still turned out great. Give it a try!

This recipe was easy and wonderful. I made it as part of a tasting menu dinner and paired it with a Guerztraminer - it was phenomenal. The party exploded after this course.

Good recipe, this also works very well with large (raw) tiger prawns, cleaned and shelled leaving the tails on, and de-vein the prawns. Someone else on the reviews panel suggested using sesame oil as it is the oil of choice in oriental cooking - well this is not true nor correct. Sesame oil has a very distinct flavour/fragrance in itself and it does not do anything to the curry. I am an oriental and I use sesame oil for certain (oriental) dishes only (sesame oil compliments certain meats/vegetables and best for certain type of sauces only).

Delicious. I used only one can of cocanut milk and increased chicken broth (to reduce calories and fat). I also cut Curry Paste down to 3/4 tsp. Just right for us. We served the dish with french bread and a dry Gewertzmainer - WOW!

Spectacular! I made a few minor variations and wish I had made one more: I tasted the broth before the tomatoes and far preferred it that way. Something about the tomatoes evoked the flavor of Fruit Loops when I closed my eyes. My dinner guest felt the same way. I also increased the fish sauce and the curry paste to my liking, and I had to substitute a filtered olive oil for the peanut oil since I realized at the last minute that my peanut oil had started to turn. Olive oil worked just fine and I suspect actually contributed to more of a "fusion" flavor than a straight Thai flavor. I'd probably use the olive oil by default rather than by simple necessity as a result. Overall- a great recipe.

Actually, I made it with dungeoness crab in lieu of the mussels and it was absolutely incredible. I will try it with the mussels next. The corander and the sauce comingle into something well beyond what one might imagine.

A really good recipe. I make Thai dishes often and am surprised that this recipe left out such an important step. When buying curry paste at an oriental grocery it is imprtant to note that their are different brands with varying degrees of spiciness. Mae Ploy is the brand most often used but also the spiciest as well as least expensive. Whichever brand you choose it is important to heat the paste up in a couple of tablespoons of sesame oil (the recipe calls for peanut oil but sesame is the the oild of choice in oriental cooking). This warming process brings out the flavor in the spices of the paste much better than simply dissolving in the coconut milk. Also, be careful not to boil milk too long. Coconut milk is easily scalded.

Just made this and it was fantastic! I doubled the amount of curry paste and added extra Nam Pla. Additionally, I added one clove of chopped garlic. For an extra rich sauce you can take out a few mussels first and add them to the broth and purée them with a stick blender. I garnished with chopped fresh cilantro.
