This was pretty good -dredged in flour, egg and panko which gave it a nice crust. Gravy was awesome. I'd make that again in a heartbeat.

Excellent gravy, and if you don't have time to marinate, choose a better cut of meat... thin cut sirloin, for example. Also, be careful when turning the steak to keep the flour coating on it. Very delicious.

I really wanted to LOVE this recipe. I agree with the other cooks who said the meat was too tough and it needed overnight marinating. Next time I will buy my meat at Whole Foods. The gravy was good. Would make the gravy again to just have with biscuits on their own. I served this up with sauteed collard greens with fresh garlic, olive oil, butter and chili flakes. The greens were the best part of the dish. However, my boyfriend thought it was really good! He will be eating the leftovers! I would make it again for him...and just marinate and tenderize like crazy. I also doubled the gravy recipe, but I thought it came out a little too thick, so I would definitely add more liquids as I reduce next time. And extra pepper to the gravy!!

Delicious Meal! Definitely tenderize the meat. The gravy was the perfect accent. I served it with green beans and buttermilk biscuits. My whole family was impressed.

This was delicious, but next time I will tenderize and marinate the steak overnight for a better consistency. Served with steamed broccoli, fried breaded okra, and garlic toast this made a classic country meal into a gourmet masterpiece.

I was not expecting this recipe to be this delicious. The gravy really makes the whole thing come together. We couldn't find Skirt Steak so I subbed in a thin round steak. Served with corn on the cob and boiled, salted potatoes for an easy meal. I felt this recipe was good enough to serve for company.

The gravy was excellent and really yummy drizzled over baking soda biscuits. I felt that the recipe by Alton brown was a little better though.

This was delicious. I served it as recommended, with buttermilk biscuits and green beans and it was incredible. I think next time I might leave the steak in flour a bit longer to get more of a crust.

We enjoyed this recipe. The steak were wonderful. I would double the gravy. I don't think there was enough for the steaks. Now - if they had only provided a good buttermilk biscuit recipe!!

I couldnt find skirt steak but used flank instead since they were similar. I like the flavors but double dipping the flour before frying made it just too crusty. Next time I'll single dip the flour. The gravy was simple and wonderful. I made mash potatoes with it only I forgot to bake the biscuits. My husband loved it so it cant be too bad. After he ate he went straight to the couch and fell asleep with a smile on his face. THE END

Make sure you have your butcher tenderize your steaks. We just bought prepak skirt steak and cooked per recipe. Consistency of shoe-leather! Flavors good but won't repeat.
