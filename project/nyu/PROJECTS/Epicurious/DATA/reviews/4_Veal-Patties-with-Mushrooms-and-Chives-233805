mah. not bad. made as written, but subbed half-and-half for the cream... you know, it was still pretty darn rich. i s'pose the ease-to-payoff ratio is pretty high here.

Made on two occasions. 10 minutes is not adequate cooking time; that aside, made recipe as written save had to substitute supermarked mixed wild/cultivated mushrooms for cremini. Exceptional and easy. Love it!

The only item I changed on this recipe was the cremeni mushrooms to shiitake, which I had on hand. very good taste with easy and quick prep time.

This recipe is really tasty and quite refined as meatloaf goes. If you can't find ground veal, then meatloaf mix of veal pork and beef also works nicely. I make extras and freeze them prior to cooking for future meals. I rarely repeat recipes, but this one is worth it!

I've made this a bunch of times and I love it. The patties are light and have this addicting flavor. A couple of modifications I make for personal tates: I use onions instead of mushrooms on top. [Boyfriend is not a big mushroom fan.] and when I do so I omitt the extra butter when making the sauce. And I use chopped shallots instead of chives - not because I dislike chives, but more because I tend to never have them in my house.

Quick, easy, moist and flavorful. I added a little FF Half & Half to the mushrooms after sauteeing and it gave it a nice sauce.

Easy and tasty. A couple of nits with the recipe. Unless you make your patties really think, there's no way you are going to get 4 of them in a 12 inch skillet at the same time. I opted for thinner (think thick hamburger) patties and cooked them in 2 batches. The muchrooms take longer to brown than stated in the recipe. After 4-5 minutes, creminis are just giving up their water. In order to brown them you need to cooke them until all of the water has been cooked out. Only then will they brown. This takes closer to 10 minutes. I might try adding a little cream to the mushrooms at the end of cooking next time to make more a little sauce.

Easy and exceptionally good. Also exceptionally rich. Ten minutes was nowhere near long enough to get the patties to 148 degrees so anticipate slightly longer cooking time. Yummy!
