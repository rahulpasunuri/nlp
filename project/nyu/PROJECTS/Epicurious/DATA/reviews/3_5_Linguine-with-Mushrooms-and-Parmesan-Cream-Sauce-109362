Delicious, simple, easy, what more could you ask for! I halved the mushrooms, and used only a pinch of nutmeg. I had brie and roasted garlic ravioli that needed to be used, so i left out the parmesan cheese and deglazed the pan with white wine before adding the cream. I skipped the last step of adding the cheese and the cooking water, since the cheese is what thickens the sauce. Instead I added 8 - 10 pinches of flour and kept the sauce on low heat, stirring frequently, allowing the sauce to thicken. Mixed this and the parsely into the drained ravioli and served. Perfect!

This is a simple and tasty recipe. If you like creamy dishes, use the heavy whipping cream. I've tried it with 1/2 and 1/2 as well as heavy whipping cream and I prefer the richer flavor with the cream. I'd also recommend using about 1/2 of the cheese. Have substituted basil for parsley which worked out fine. Also deglazed pan with white wine.

I used 2% milk because that's what we had. I added a bit of maple syrup to the mushrooms, skipped the parsley and used a bag of frozen peas. I cooked fresh shrimp in butter and tossed it in with the pasta at the end. It was great! This might become a staple.

This is a quick and satisfying weeknight dish I have made several times. Like some other reviewers, I deglazed the pan with some wine, and used half and half instead of the whipping cream and only half the cheese. I used fresh basil instead of parsley because that's what I have in the garden.

This was delicious and so easy! Threw some baked chicken breasts coated w/ parmesan cheese on top and it was great. Also cut the parm. in half, cut the garlic in half, a dash of nutmeg and added peas, as others suggested. Used regular white mushrooms, since that was all I had on hand. Husband raved!

My family loved this dish, and I'll most likely make it again. I thought that it was a tiny bit heavy on the nutmeg, but my family didn't notice. Next time I'll use just the tiniest pinch. I was also thinking about sauteeing some onions with the mushrooms, but it probably doesn't need it. I would also consider deglazing the pan with the littlest bit of sherry before adding the cream. I used rotini for the pasta and liked it a lot. Also, I used a lot less chesse than the recipe called for, and I didn't think that the dish was too rich at all. I also liked one person's idea of adding peas to the dish. Overall, I think that this is a pleasant weeknight meal.

It was quite good. I replaced the mushrooms with vidalia onions and tried cinnamon instead of nutmeg (college kitchens=sparse)this gave it a slightly sweeter taste. My only complaint is the sauce wouldn't smooth out quite right. I'm considering using less cheese in the future. Enjoy =)

Very Good, I have made it three times so far, my family keeps asking for it. I just added some sliced black olives to it for extra taste.

Used fat-free half and half in lieu of the whipping cream and added about 2 cups of roasted chopped chicken. I'll have to say, unless you want the protien from the chicken, the recipe would be just as good without. Am not a big fan of nutmeg, but given the small amount, went ahead and included. Perfect flavor! I am usually trying to lighten up recipes, but did use most of the parmesan cheese.

Not bad, by any measure; but so many of the recipes on this site are fabulous. This is like a restaurant cream/cheese pasta: good comfort & family food, but I wouldn't make it again for guests.

I would make this again, but with significant alterations. We made a half portion of this last night and it made us both sick! It is tasty, but too rich.

Perfect sauce, but used a splash of white wine and let it evaporate before adding cream. Also added a tsp. of this great veal demi-glace concentrate I found at a gourmet grocery store (you can check it out at www.morethangourmet.com, it's all natural and it beats making it from scratch.) Half cup of cheese was enough.

Simple, fast and delicious, though I used only about 1/3 of the cheese the recipe calls for. This is a very heavy dish.

Wonderful flavor. I debated on using white mushrooms instead of crimini but the crimini gave it a much earthier taste. I reduced the amount of parsley to 1/4 cup -- fresh parsley goes a long way! This recipe is a definite keeper.

Very tasty-- Perfect for a Saturday night when we wanted something good but didn't want to do a lot cooking. used half-and-half and added some peas. Also garnished with some smoked salmon.

Very simple and easy. I substituted penne and half and half since that's what I had. Great recipe to use as a base and add onto. I'm thinking asparagus or peas for the next batch.

This recipe was delicious! It makes a ton of pasta and is incredibly rich, so a little goes a long way! I added sweet italian sausage to the recipe and it was so good! I will make again and again and this recipe seems like it would be good for endless variations!

This was a fantastic recipe, I made it for my fiancée and he went back for 2nds, 3rds, and 4ths. I loved that the sauce was not too heavy or rich, I added some sautéed chicken, but it would have been just as good without it. I am definitely going to make this again!
