The vegetable crust kept in the juices, making the meat flavorful and moist. Made it with 7-1/4 lb rib roast and omitted the celery. At 1 hr 50 min was spot on. Tasty!!

Made this again and everyone loved it. So easy, just follow the directions. I did have the butcher remove the bones and then tied them on the bottom.Makes for easier carving. Guests started talking about the diappointed prime rib they had while dining out.

This is an absolutely delicious recipe. I added about two teaspoons of fresh thyme to the puree; otherwise I followed the recommended ingredients. We had a large dinner party so I bought an 11 lb. rib roast from the small end. I roasted the meat at 450 for about 15 minutes then reduced the heat to 330 degrees. It cooked for 2 hours and 45 minutes and came out perfectly (medium rare) after letting it rest for 15 more minutes. We were at Lake Tahoe which is at 6,200' so I suspect it took a little longer than for those at sea level. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is absolutely incredible. Please note the correction to 1- 6 3/4 pound roast. Anyhow, I substituted shallots for the onions. It was amazing succulent, tender and I will definitely make it again and again. In fact I'm making it again tomorrow for Christmas dinner. And this time I'm making it on the rotisserie.

EASY AND FAST TO MAKE

I had never made a standing rib roast before, and this was fairly easy and a wonderful treat for a special occasion. I put the roast on a rack after it stood for an hour and wiped off excess vegetable crust from the bottom of the pan to prevent burning. I also found 125 to be too well done -- I cooked to 120 and it still was a little better done than medium rare after standing. Also -- beware if guests are on the Atkins or South Beach diets! You'll want to allow at least a pound per person, more if you want leftovers..

My oh my, I made this dish on Christmas Day, and it was out of this world. The taste of the crust blending with meat juices is mouth-watering. I've never enjoyed beef more, and think this will have to become an annual treat.

Excellent presentation. I couldn't find my meat thermometer, though, so simply followed these instructions for time and temperature. As a result, it was far too well done for my preference.

Somethings wrong here - this recipe calls for 1 3/4 lb roast? And that will sevrve 8?

Looks good, but they really shouldn't classify it as an Asian recipe ;-)

This will replace turkey in future Thanksgiving Dinners! I cooked a 17lb roast that was absolute perfection. Too good to be true coming from MY kitchen :)

This is now the official dinner meal at my house, the only difference is I use a larger roast.

This is an excellent recipe for a Dinner party!!! I have made it several times and will continue. Please note the typing error indicating roast size. The original recipe published in December 1999, page 38, specifies a roast size 1-6 3/4 lb. standing rib roast.

The poundage for the roast would not and could not feed that many people, so remember to increase it as other reviewers have stated. Although my instincts told me different, I did follow the temperature guide in the recipe, roasting it at 500 degrees and then turning it down to 375. The vegetable crust burned and made the pan drippings almost unusable. I did manage to make a wonderful gravy from the drippings, but again, the high heat made the drippings burn too much. I have dined at The Fort Restaurant before and it is a wonderful treat for the senses. When I saw this recipe I knew it would taste wonderful and decided to make it for my Christmas dinner. My guests were NOT disappointed and neither was I: It was both flavorful and tender. I would most definitely make this recipe again, altering the temperature. I accompanied my roast with the Garlicky Mashed Potatoes (from the recipe search) which I recommend as well.

I made this last Christmas ('99). I lost the recipe and started panicing today when I started looking for it for this year. Glad I found it on the web. It was delicious and got many rave reviews. It will become our Christmas tradition.

In the magazine, the recipe calls for a 6 3/4 pound standing rib roast.

This recipe was great except it was not the 8 person servings as described. Next time I will request a 6-8LBs roast!
