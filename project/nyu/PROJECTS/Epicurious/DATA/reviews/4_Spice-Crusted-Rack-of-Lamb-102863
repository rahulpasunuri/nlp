This recipe is really incredible! I decided to tried it on lamb shanks, and wow, we were just in heaven. For this dish, I used 50% more spices, and double sauce ingredients. I seared the 4 big shanks, and then proceed with the sauce. I added some chili powder, sugar, ketchup, cream, and sweet and hot sauce to taste. Let it cook (sauce and lamb) for 11/2-2 hours, until the meat is soft. Then puree the sauce with hand blender, strained, added some cornstarch to thicken. Wow, show stopper.

Wow, this dish deserves 5 stars! I was worry about the amount of certain spices, specially after spending $50 on lamb, but, to my amazement, it was fantastic. I up the garlic, used canned tomatoes, and 3 cups combo beef/chicken broth. Did not have the bones. I rubbed some olive oil on the racks, sauteed them in ghee, and then, after they were cooked, pour some of the lamb fat into the gravy. The lamb was cooked perfecly. I took it out after 20 minutes, and tented with foil for another 10. I saved the solids to eat with naan. Served with basmati rice, and paneer mushroom masala. Great Indian meal. I highly recommend this one.

I have had this recipe for several years and finally made it for the first time last night and it was fantastic! I was a little cautious when the sauce first started cooking, but by the time it had reduced to the final amount it was delicious. I didn't have the lamb bones, just used my home made chicken stock. Served it with dosas to sop up the sauce

This is a wonderful lamb recipe. for pwople who usually don't like lamb, I have served this with dish. without exception the comment is, "This can't be lamb. I don't like lamb and this is good!" I strongly encourage you to try this tasty dish. Balancing the coriander and cumin is important, so follow the rations of spices.

I served the whole Dinner menu for my in-laws from India. They revaved about the soup and the lamb. The veggie dish was somewhat bland for them.
