I have to agree with the cook from AB Canada, you need to use fresh, high-quality ingredients to achieve a superior result. Try browning your butter and before it is finished add some minced garlic...this adds a nutty flavour and ups the dish's taste factor. My children love this

I suppose this doesn't need a recipe, but for people raised by Southern cook's like me, I like to know an exact amount of butter/oil to put in a recipe as Southern cooks tend to be a little heavy handed in that area. This was quite delicious!! I will make it often!

Of course this is delicious. But for this you need a recipe? Puhlease.

With some freshly ground pepper it's a simple and delicious side dish. My children especially love it and are more likely to try a new main dish if something trusted is served alongside it.

Not only would I make it again, I make it fairly often as both a side dish and a quick and tasty weeknight meal with salad. I agree, it is really simple, but were you aware that it's also the original recipe for Fettucine Alfredo? The real recipe has nothing to do with heavy cream and everything to do with good quality European-style butter that has a higher fat content and much less water than what is typically available in North American dairy cases. It also benefits from high-quality freshly grated cheese, and of course, freshly ground pepper (nothing from a shaker, thank you).

Most people don't know that it has nothing to do with whipping cream, and everything to do with good quality European-style butter with a much higher fat content and less water than what is typically available in North American dairy cases.

Since when is noodles, butter and cheese a "recipe"? I don't doubt that it would be tasty, but we're in deep doo-doo if it takes a recipe to tell us to put these basics together!!
