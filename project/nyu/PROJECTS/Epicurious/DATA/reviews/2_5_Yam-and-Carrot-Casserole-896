I made this for a potluck yesterday. It was delicious and everyone there liked it a lot. It was fairly simple to make.

While my kids enjoyed the dish, both me and my husband were not pleased with the texture of the dish. The custard did not bind the shredded veggies well, and the top was crispy. I had hoped for a more carrot flavor, since I am experimenting with new veggie dishes to serve my family. I do not expect to make this dish again since we have other sweet potato dishes that we perfer more.

While the taste was pleasant enough (used 1/2 the sugar), it was like eating undercooked carrot cake. Not worth a second effort.

A nice alternative to traditional yam dishes. Just sweet enough.

This made a nice side dish for my Christmas dinner. The subtle array of colors - bright and pale orange and white - in the coarsely grated vegetables was very attractive. I used golden raisins to good effect altho recipe did not specify. Cut back on brown sugar, as another cook suggested. And I also think I might try some more aggressive (i.e. "hot") seasoning the next time. around. Just can't understand the vituperation of the cook from Charleston. This dish may not be non-pareil but it sho ain't "nasty"!

A great alternative to the sugary sweet potato casserole. Just sweet enough. Leave the mini-marshmallow covered sweet potato casserole to the kids and put this on the adult table. Yum!

Just a note in response to hairyj -- vegans wouldn't eat eggs or butter. You could sub margarine but I don't know how to get around the eggs.

A good alternative to the typical candied yams (which the taste of this recipe is very similsr). The kids liked the addition of raisins. I'm not really into sweet flavored dishes when it isn't some sinful dessert so...

If you like any kind of yam casserole, or yams alone, the sweetness of this dish won't surprise you. However, I found it on the sweet side and may reduce the amount of brown sugar at next try. I also added some cajun spice to one casserole dish and most of the crowd really liked the extra spicyness.

I have made this for the past two tears and my family asked me to make it every year! I am not a big sweet potato person but the carrots and potato really add to it! I have become a sweet potato fan!

My vegetarian husband said, and I quote, "This was unquestionably one of the nastiest dishes I've ever had in my life!" I won't be making this again. The texture was yucky, the taste was horrid. The only nice thing was the smell (and he didn't even like that either). If I could have given this recipe zero forks, I would have. Yuck!!

This is a great dish for a crowd of hungry vegans.Very colorful for thanksgiving with great aroma. My casserole was served room temperature - might be better hot.
