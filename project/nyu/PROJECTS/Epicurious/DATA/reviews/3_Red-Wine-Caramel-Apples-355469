I was able to get the consistency mostly right on my second try. I think I still fell a little bit short of dark amber (I took it off at around 300-315, should've left it on for a little longer), so my caramel was a little more chewy than hard. My red wine took a lot time to reduce, so by the time I got the caramel it was still only at half cup. I used half of that instead, and so the wine taste was not really strong. However, the caramel did not pool at the bottom of the apples at all. I think it may be because I let to go past 238 to around 255, so it hardened a little better. The taste was good though.

I think this was f un. I was really nervous about it, its new to me. However, it went well. We scrubbed apples for wax and simmered wine for 10-13 minutes and then made sure we got it to 240 degrees the dropped to 200 and swirled the apples for a while before i set them on wax paper.

I made this recipe last weekend and they were amazing! I used Royal Gala Apples that I am sure were waxed. I washed them well, but probably did not get the wax removed. I too had the issue with the taffy slowly pooling around the bottom of the apples. They were absolutely beautiful when I made them but with every passing hour the taffy puddle got bigger. They tasted fabulous. I just need to to master the taffy sticking to the apples. I will make these again in a couple of weeks for Thanksgiving.

Question: when it says, "Add cream and simmer until...." does this mean to turn the knob on my stove to Simmer, or leave the heat as is, until the temp on the candy thermometer reaches....?

Second time I have made this dish for our college students and staff and they love it. The suggestions in other reviews about wax on the fruit and heat are key, as is patience to let the wine thicken and reduce. There is a sludge factor, but i am not after the commercial caramel coating experience here. These are delicious, attractive, and fun to make.

Excellent results on first attempt and guests were very pleased. Must have a candy thermometer and dry waxless apples. I picked mine up at Whole Foods and scrubbed off the veggie wax with dish soap. Got mixture past 240 then started coating when it fell to 200. I held them upside down for a 20 sec count and my apples remained perfectly coated with ZERO puddles. Word to the wise, DO grease your wax paper.

Simmering doesn't make sense - it should be at a rolling boil. 238 degrees also doesn't make sense - take it up to 245 degrees. The higher temperature will make for a firmer coating that sticks.

I think the key is keeping caramel hot, hot, hot. I heated to about 245 F, let it cool to about 210 and the first batch came out well, retained color and stuck to the washed and wiped-dry apples. As the caramel cooled, the color faded and I had a puddles of caramel that was really too gooey to make it a pleasant eating experience. Great taste, though. Worth experimenting with. I saved the second batch by rolling the apples in nuts and placing in a paper muffin cup. I gave it three forks because of the wonderful flavor and the hope that I will get the temp right next time!

I tried this recipe twice in one night and the biggest tragedy is a whole bottle of wine is gone with not much to show for it. The first failure was my fault for not paying closer attention, but the second time I tried it I did everything perfectly, but the caramel never hardened. I let the apples set overnight and all I had in the morning was a gooey sticky mess. I wouldn't recommend.

Loved these apples. Bought apples from the farmer's market - no wax! I thought the red wine added a wonderful flavor and a gorgeous color to the apple. The caramel was a little runny but ... I have not made caramel apples before and am now intrigued to try different recipes.

The one fork is for taste - if I could figure out a better cooking method, it was a great change from the typical caramel - not as sweet with a nice hint of wine. What a mess! I am not afraid of making candy, caramel, etc. but this method just did not work. The texture was completely off, really gritty with chunks of sugar. When I finally did get it smooth it did not solidify enough to stick to the apples and kept dripping off. Glad I had good friends over to laugh it off!

If I could give this recipe 0 I would. I ended up consulting the Larousse Gastronomique for an appropriate caramel recipe for apples after trying to make this four times. One turned out okay, but as hard tack candy, so I have candied apples. The rest turned into sludge.

I haven't tried this recipe, but recall a tip for caramel apples that may help with the complaints listed. Since apples are often "waxed" when put in the stores, another recipe suggested dipping them first in very hot water to remove the wax. I've done it with other caramel apple recipes and had better luck with the caramel sticking. Only problem I found was some slight discoloration in the apple skin... though that's less of a problem if the caramel coating sticks.

The only reason I gave 1 fork is that giving zero is not an option. The sauce itself is good, but doesn't stick to the apples at all. Leaving you with apples with sticks stuck into them, and a pool of sauce under them. I would recommend using the sauce for dipping cut up apples. Way too time-consuming for coming out wrong (and I followed the directions as written).

The taste of the caramel was great, but the texture was off: most of the caramel slid off the apples into a pool on the waxed paper, and what remained on the apples had a somewhat gritty texture. I followed the cooking directions exactly, using a candy thermometer to get the precise temperatures. It's too bad they didn't come out together because the red wine and the caramel flavors together was divine.
