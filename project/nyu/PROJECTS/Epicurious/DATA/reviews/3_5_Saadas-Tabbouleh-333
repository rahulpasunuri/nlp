This was delicious! The only change I made was to cut the bulgur by 1/2C, based on other reviews. Every flavor comes through perfectly. Next time, I might add some chopped cucumber and/or make it with couscous. Oh, I mixed in the tomatoes, etc by hand. I don't think it's supposed to be done in the processor.

Good, needed more parsley and mint though. But very tasty.

I love this recipe, but I like 1 cup bulgur and kept everything else the same. I also added a touch of kosher salt and pepper. I think the cumin is a great addition, but kept it at 1/2 teaspoon with the smaller amount of bulgur. This salad is pure goodness with all the parsley and mint.

I know you all hate 4 forks from cooks that didn't follow the recipe exactly but too bad. I didn't want the mint in my tabbouleh so I left it out and I really loved this recipe. I over processed it in my food processor so it looked more like gruel than the beautiful salad I've purchased in specialty stores (but this didn't alter the great taste). I highly recommend this anyone trying to make a healthy side dish.

The tabbouleh benefits greatly from extra lemon juice, olive oil, and cumin. For an authentic Middle Eastern/Turkish flavor, don't skip the latter! Serving it with the Yogurt-Marinated Chicken Kebabs with Aleppo Pepper for dinner tonight.

Delicious with barbeque chicken and grilled corn.

I enjoy tabbouleh, but this recipe was lacking flavor. It requires more acidity: extra lemon and red wine vinegar, as well as ample mint. It offers a good place to start, in terms of proportions, though. Be warned: the recipe yields a quantity too great for any most mixing bowls.

Very nice, fresh dish! Served with Roast Beef, Red Pepper, Feta Sandwiches w/Tahini Dressing from this site, and baklava for dessert. Wonderful! I used couscous instead of bulgur (couldn't find it at my store) and it was great. I didn't purchase enough green onions or mint but it turned out good anyway, though if I make it again I would make sure I had the right amounts, especially the mint. I also added more tomatoes, but we are tomato lovers so it was to suit our personal tastes and worked out well!

Great tabbouleh, fresh and flavourful. Used cherry tomatoes and did not seed, a smaller quantity of medium bulgur, and I added freshly ground pepper.

I subsitute cous cous for the bulghur - since I always have it on hand. Very tasty recipe! Healthy and delicious.

So easy and really tasty! I added about 8 cloves of roasted garlic because I had them on hand, and it worked really well. I also purchased a really fine grain bulgur at an Indian/Middle Eastern grocery, which worked beautifully. After testing the recipe, I made it for a crowd of 200 and used cherry tomatoes to save the seeding and chopping time and it was perfect

Ooops! I meant to say on the last review that he didn't add cumin and added one diced and seeded cucumber. Sorry!

Great recipe! It is very very close to the tabbouleh that a lebanese friend of mine makes. The only difference is that he doesn't adds in a diced and seeded cucumber. A wonderfully refreshing dish for summer.

This is a delicious recipe. One thing that really makes this stand out compared to other tabbouleh recipes is the cumin. I do not add the entire amount listed above - I normally add a pinch and then season to taste.

i make this often. Don't use the cumin. Add tomatoes and green onions. make sure to mince everything very well. Great served cold with shrimp.

I modified this recipe by adding 2 teaspoons salt, one diced cucumber, and using 1/2 cup lemon juice and 1/2 cup olive oil instead of the recommnended amounts. The cumin adds a very nice zip to it. Delicious and refreshing salad that friends always ask for when we have potluck parties.

I used three bunches of parsley and 1/2 cup of bulgar. I also added extra meyer lemon juice and chopped cherry tomatoes that were seeded. Excellent recipe.

This is a terrific recipie. I used plums as recommended by another reader, and it was fantastic. Definitely needs more parsley, olive oil, and plenty of salt & pepper.

This still doesn't have the ratio of parsley to bulgar that I'm looking for, but it's close. Next time I think I'll just use 1.5 cups of grain, and maybe an even bigger bunch of parsley. Don't omit the cumin, though; it's not recognizable in the final salad but adds an extra zing.

I've made this recipe several times and really enjoy it. I add an extra T. of olive oil, and find 2 tsp. kosher salt is just right. I also toast the cumin in a dry skillet briefly anytime it goes into an uncooked dish. Be sure to get bulgur that is evenly ground--such as comes prepackaged in a Middle East market. Medium, or #2 grind works great. This salad definitely is at it's best when served at room temp.

You've got to try this! An absolutely incredible take on the basic tabbouleh receipe is to make the basic recipe like this one but instead of adding tomatoes or cucumbers or onions, add slightly crisp plums. The contrast in flavor between sweet and bitter along with the enhancement of fresh mint and parsley is phenomenal! Give it a try...you'll never think of tabbouleh the same way again.

I liked this recipe. I left out the mint and added a few cloves of garlic to the food processor with the parsley. So easy and looks pretty too.

Absolutely agree with Sulema's comments. Please use the finest bulgur you can find. Use only 1/2 cup of bulgur. Add another whole bunch of parsley. Omit the cumin. Serve with grilled meat or chicken.

Very authentic-- close to the tabbouleh my mother makes! However, we like to omit the green onion and cumin, and we add an entire bunch of mint. Either way, this is the perfect summer salad. Other times of year it is just as refreshing.

This was great! A little bland for me, so I doubled everything except the bulgar to give it extra zip. Easy to make a keeps for a week. I'm about to make it for a big party!

Very tasty, versitile dish. I warmed the dish and added thin slices of goat's feta cheese for an extra zip! Served on its own or with chicken - excellent!

Of all the recipes I have seen for tabbouleh, I think this one is the best. I have noticed that in the United States we seem to have an aversion to parsley as anything other than a garnish. In the Middle East, parsley (NOT cracked wheat) is the MAIN ingredient in tabbouleh. It is used just like lettuce. Although I have never eaten it seasoned with cumin, I found the proportions of cracked wheat to parsley in this recipe to be closer to the tabbouleh with which I am familiar.

Its the real thing baby. Srve it cold with Gyros at a picnic and they will remember you forever.
