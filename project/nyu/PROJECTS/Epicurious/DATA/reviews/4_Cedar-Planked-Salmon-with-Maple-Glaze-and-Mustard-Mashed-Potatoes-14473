Wow - this one is definitely in the rotation! I did amp up the lemon, ginger, garlic and soy in the glaze - was phenomenal. I double the batch as it keeps well in the fridge and is also great with veg, chicken, etc. Haven't tried the cedar plank yet and it's still great. Definitely use real maple syrup.

A go to meal for me! Excellent glaze - I make extra and keep on hand in the fridge (lasts quite a while) for quick veg/fish/chicken dinners. Flavours are lovely as is - use real maple syrup. Haven't yet tried the cedar plank yet and it's still a great recipe.

This is my all time favorite Salmon dinner - recipe - everyone loves it... sometimes with more ginger and garlic... and leftovers are great with scrambled eggs!... or on a salad... as some say ... try it - you'll like it... :)

but for waaaaaaaaay too much sweetness, this recipe was awesome. i used 100% (canadian!) maple syrup, and put the planked fish on the bbq instead of in the oven. next time (and there will be a next time) i will cut the maple syrup way back (down to maybe 1/4 cup) and throw in some vinegar as others have suggest.

I love this recipe! I usually skip the cedar plank and bake salmon filets on a cooling rack set in a edged baking sheet. Bake for about 10 min. on 400f then start glazing every 2 min (3x). I layer this dish for serving. For healthy high protein dish I use quinoa. I sauté red and yellow peppers and purple onions on very high heat, when dark spots are visible I remove from heat and toss a small amount of glaze over them. This is the second layer on each plate. I lay the samlon on the top and dizzle a little hot glaze over it all and OH my gosh, amazing. It is enjoyed by all.

Big thumbs up. Made this for a dinner party of 11 and it was a hit. Nervous about the comments like "cloyingly sweet" and the number of folks who substituted some balsamic vinegar. I opted to make it as presented and was glad I did. The bright spicy notes of the ginger and garlic made this very well balanced. So much so that I wondered if by some chance the folks who complained tried to use "Log Cabin" or "Aunt Jemima" (which is corn syrup and sugar) instead of pure maple syrup. My notes on cook time: I doubled the recipe which was a lot of fish to cook at once (three casserole dishes), which should have lengthened cook time. Used convection bake which would have shortened cook time. Cedar planks were a "cook time wild card," too. Recipe did not say whether to soak planks or not. I wet mine numerous times before using, but did not soak as extensively as I would have if using the grill. I did preheat the planks as the recipe specifies. I checked my fish at 30 minutes (5 minutes less than specified) and pulled it out immediately. 25 minutes would have been better. I'll make this again. It's my "second favorite" salmon recipe after the easy, always a huge hit (but made too often in my house) barbecue salmon (http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/barbecue-roasted-salmon-10000000521446/) served over basmati cooked with coconut milk instead of water.

This was no better than okay. I made it last night and actually measured the ingredients and followed the recipe exactly, something I do not normally do. If I hadn't done so, I would blame myself for the fact that the dish wasn't good... It was a total waste of my gorgeous line caught coho salmon. BUT the mashed potatoes were tasty.

Really good! Not fish fans and trying to eat more fish. This was great. I made 1/2 of the glaze since we had one filet for 2 people. Might add a touch more lemon juice - it's pretty sweet, but is a good complement to the salmon and did not overwhelm it. I did my salmon on the grill on a cedar plank over indirect heat. Be sure to soak the plank first. Grill is easier than the oven and gives better flavor - you get the smoke from the plank when it is on the grill. Must have with the Mustard Mashed Potatoes referenced in thie recipe - a PERFECT complement to the sweetness of the glaze. Not a mustard fan, but like many others, found these potatoes to be excellent. Will add both to the rotation.

Great taste, easy prep. Whole family enjoyed this meal./ The mustard mashed potatoes were a nice contrast to the salmon. A keeper.

This recipe is remarkably good. The best salmon recipe I've ever made--better than most restaurant salmon preparations I've made. Make it exactly as written, though usually make it with skinless salmon from Costco. As an alternative, to the mustard mashed potatoes (which are wonderful with it) for summer I also have served it with a potato and green bean salad with mustard vinagarette (also a recipe available on this site, though I use less oil in my salad).

Made without the cedar plank and served to 16 VIP dinner guests. They absolutely LOVED it. I got compliments galore including how it tasted better than restaurant fish. I portioned the fish before roasting it, used double the fish and found that a single recipe of glaze was sufficient. I also brushed extra glaze over the fish at about 15 minutes of cooking time and put it under the broiler for a few minutes to develop a nice crust. Served it with the remaining glaze as a sauce. I also served mashed yams with Mustard as in the accompanying recipe. I will DEFINITELY make this again, and again.

Amazing flavors! No alterations of the recipe needed, the maple glaze pairs equisitely with the mustard in the potatoes...divine!

Superb! Like some others I used 1/2C maple syrup and 1/2C Balsamic vinegar. It took 40 minutes to get the salmon to 140 degrees. Served with the mustard mashed potato pairing along with green beans. A Williams Selyem Allen Vineyard pinot noir was a perfect pairing. Will definitely serve this again!

I don't plank this but use the glaze in the oven or on the BBQ. I'm not that big on salmon as such, but as my husband is an angler I have a bit of it in the house and wanted to find a way to use it that I liked. This is great cooked and flaked on a salad lightly dressed with balsamic vinaigrette and garnished with a touch of freshly-squeezed lemon.

Rating: 4
The salmon is best on a gas grill unless you want your salmon to have a charoal flavor. I also omit the scallions because it can take away the flavor of the salmon and glaze. I have gotten nothing but rave reviews from family and friends on this recipe! When I went to Vermont last fall, I bought a whole gallon of Grade B maple syrup just for this recipe. I also prefer skinless salmon, it works better in my opinion since I am not using the scallions.

Rating: 4
I am not a fan of mustard but this recipe changed my mind! I was going to make the salmon with out the potatoes until I read the rave reviews about the mustard mashed potatoes and thought I had to give it a try. I doubled both recipes and served this for a dinner party of 12 and there wasn't a bite of anything left! The potatoes cooked faster than the recipe listed so watch that carefully. We cooked the salmon on the plank on the grill outside and that only cooked 20 minutes and it was ready. So note the cooking times vary. It also took me longer to cook the maple glaze, possibly because I had doubled the amounts. We had left over glaze and had to make the meal again just for ourselves two nights later because it was so good!

This recipe was amazing! I used a regular pan, not the cedar and it turned out great. I also cut the maple syrup in half and it was sweet enough. I also did not have scallions and I thinly sliced and onion and laid it at the bottom of the pan for the fish to sit on. Worked great and the onion tasted nice with the zesty sauce. I am definitely making this again!

Loved this recipe! It was a last minute choice, so I had to use what I had on hand in my pantry. I improvised and used candied ginger instead of fresh, baked it in the oven on the scallion nests(minus the cedar planks), and finished the sauce with a tablespoon of bourbon liqueur instead of lemon juice. Wow! One of the best salmon dishes I've ever made! Loved the mustard mashed as well.

This meal is absolutely delicious. I also used 1/2 cup of maple syrup, as suggested by others.I added about 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar.

Four forks for YUM -a real winner!

I used this recipe for a dinner party and I got raves...everyone loved it and my husband said this was a restaurant grade meal.

I will make it again also with no changes.

This recipe is simply amazing. I had never before prepared anything using a cedar plank and I must say, I think it was a huge success. My husband, who is always very squeamish about trying salmon, absolutely loved it. He even had a second serving, which he almost never does. I made it on the grill at about 400 degrees for approx 30 min. The cedar plank seemed to help retain moisture very well in the salmon and added a very mild smoky flavor. The glaze is simply delicious. I made the mashed potato recipe and WOW what an addition the mustard flavor makes. I will never make plain mashed potatoes again. I served steamed green beans which I drizzled a small amount of the mustard butter on. Also served a tossed salad with honey dijon dressing. I am certain you could not get a better salmon dish in any restaurant anywhere. This meal will definately go in the favorites file.

Rating: 4
I've made this a multiple times now and it's turned into a favorite in our house. This recipe imparts a wonderful flavor to salmon. The mashed potatoes are a good complement too. I've also served this salmon with mashed boniato or sweet potatoes because it complements the sweetness in the salmon glaze. I don't think the recipe needs any tweaking, but if you don't have fresh gingerroot on hand I've used ground ginger without sacrificing too much in flavor.

Rating: 0
Easy and lovely recipe. Substituted lemon for lime juice, and used more of it for the sauce, which made it tangy. Also added butter for the glaze, making it stickier and with a fuller body. Very nice indeed.

Rating: 4
Some of the best salmon I've ever had. Works great with grilling, although if using a covered grill 15 minutes should be more than enough. Rather than grate ginger and mince garlic, I just chopped them and then sieved them out of the glaze when done. I cut the sweetness of the sauce with some Sauvingnon Blanc.

I've made this twice - once in the oven and once on a grill - and I must say cooking it on the grill is much better. The sauce was a little sweet for me but hubby loved it. Used a little more scallions for flavor but this dish didn't need anything extra. Would make again.

this is sooo good ! I went to Lowes and bought a untreated 12 foot cedar board. My husband cuts it to size depending on how many we are serving. Dont be afraid to make this for friends. The fish is moist, the whole backyard smells like the cedar and the sauce is perfect

I just made this recipe over the weekend and it was spectacular! I didn't use the scallions though (because I forgot) but I think it came out just fine the way it was. I thoroughly enjoyed the sauce over the salmon and served it with steamed green beans and a salad for a low carb meal.

Excellent. I did it on charcole grill. Soaked plank for several hours in the lake first. Was worried about plank burning too much, but no problem at all. So simple, just put salmon on plank, plank on grill, cover and it was perfect in about 25 minutes. Sauce was amazing. Used half of the maple and added balsamic. Raves. Might make more sauce next time. Also served with the mustard potatoes which does pair well. Will do again soon this summer.

This is very delicious, although I have changed the way it is cooked. Instead of the oven, the fish is grilled on the plank on high for nearly 15 minutes, which lends a smokier flavor to the fish and it is served with chopped scallions on top. Very good!

Very good. I made it with the plank on the grill and it cooked really fast, but I just cooked it until it was 140 degrees and it turned out great with plenty of cedar flavor. I also added some butter (3 Tbs?) to the sauce which made it rich and delicious. If I make it again I'll reduce the glaze even more so that it will stick better to the salmon.

DELICIOUS!! I used fresh Alaskan Copper River red salmon (the ONLY salmon to eat in an Alaskan's book!) and cut the filet serving size pieces. It was just myself, my husband, and our son so we didn't need a whole filet. We'll save the othe half for the grill someday. But the cedar plank really gave a "woodsy" flavor and we definitely enjoyed it, especially with the mashed potatoes!

Rating: 3
Didn't have a cedar plank and I wanted something quick so I seared the salmon in a bit of oil and then used the same pan to make the sauce which I then poured over the salmon. YUMMY! Reminds me of a dish I had at a salmon bake while in Alaska.

Rating: 3
This was very good. Used a 2 lb piece of salmon. Soaked cedar plank for 15 minutes in water. Then placed in oven for 15 minutes, then oiled before placing scallions and salmon on the plank. Made only 1/2 of the glaze using all the ingredients. Boiled for about 5 minutes as I did not want it to become as thick as other reviewers had noted. Brushed on salmon twice before cooking. Could taste the cedar through the glaze but believe this is because my glaze was a lot thinner than intended-AND we loved it that way. Also, because the glaze was thinner, it did not make the salmon sickeningly sweet. Took about 40 minutes to cook on the plank. Was not messy and nothing dripped off the plank so it did not make a mess of my oven.

Rating: 4
Awesome presentation on the thanksgiving table, especially for a couple of "almost vegetarian" famiy members who don't eat most meats. It was even worth the maniacal last minute search for an untreated cedar plank the day before t-day. (we found ours at a woodworking specialty shop where we picked up an 18" piece for 6 bucks). The flavor is mild, the aroma is tantalizing, and just the look of it, with some parsley sprigs on the server...magnifico. Also, the leftovers made an absolutely awesome cold salmon salad the next day, with the scallions being an absolute necessity.

Rating: 4
I made the salmon for Easter dinner. It was a spectacular dish even for the non fish lover. The sauce was wonderful, the smell of the cedar was awesome and the presentation was fabulous. Be sure to cook the sauce slowly as it can become very sticky and unmanageable. It was very easy to do for a larger group and adaptable for an oven as well. It will become a regular recipe in my household!

I made this for my book club friends and it was a hit!! I followed the recipe except I grilled it (charcoal). I think that made the smoky cedar flavor come alive in the fish. I also grilled some vegtable skewers and put some of the sauce on those....mmmmmmm!! I didn't make the potatoes, make the orzo with feta and tomatoes and it was just perfect for these hot southern ohio days!!!

Have not made this recipe, but am a fan of planked salmon. To get a smoke flavor the plank needs to be soaked just before cooking with it. Put weights on it and submerge in water for at least an hour. 350 is the maximum temp that should be used with a plank.

After reading all the reviews, I decided to make this dish when wild salmon went on sale at my local market. I had a cedar plank from a trip to Seattle and only change to recipe was that I halved it for three of us. The glaze was incredible, but there was no cedar taste to the fish, in fact there was no taste period. Not sure what the problem was. I have a tried and true salmon recipe from the cookbook, "Specialities of the House" which is an awesome cookbook. Simply salmon in a reduced sauce of cream, shallots and dijon mustard and vermouth. Absolutely a winner every time. I don't think I try this recipe again. I love salmon and there are just too many other great ways to prepare it out there.

Rating: 4
I have done this recipe many times, and it has always been an easy but impressive dish. I have never had the opportunity to use the cedar plank, however, I always use a bed of chives and/or scallions to lay the salmon in. I add more garlic than the recipe calls for as my family loves garlic. This is one of my all time favourites.

We make planked salmon all the time, and found the maple glaze a great way to dress it up a bit. If you're not using the glaze as a sauce -- and we wouldn't when serving fresh wild salmon -- a quarter recipe for the glaze is plenty.

This is probably my all-time favorite recipe on this entire site. We have made this for guests again and again and everyone raves. Bought a handful of planks from Lowe's and made this several times. It is perfect with the mashed potatoes. The best salmon dish I've ever had.

I have made this dozens of times, both for family (because it's so easy) and for company. It has been one of my son's favorites since it was first printed in Gourmet and he was 8. I rarely use the scallions. I had a lumber yard cut a plank to fit my 13 x 9 backing sheet (with sides) and have never had a mess in the oven. I soak the board in water for about 15 minutes (while the sauce is reducing). And I only cook the salmon about 25 minutes, as we love our salmon medium rare. Always get rave reviews.

Just a quick note, used the leftover mas and salmon by combining both along with some breadcrumbs (to stiffen mixture)into small cakes and pan fried to serve alongside some saute potatoes and greens, pronounced excellent. May prepare the salmon and mash just for this purpose at some stage in the future.

Hi there, cooked this earlier this week for the Course leader (she eats salmon and chicken breast meat only)my wife had been working with over the weekend and got rave reviews from her and my family. Even my fish hating daughter ate an entire piece and gave it 5/10, that's impressive. As started the whole thing on the night found the glaze hadn't thickened as much as I wanted so simply cooked a minute or two longer on fan bake to set the glaze slightly. The potato mash is a must, I made extra after reading other reviews and will use in pan fried potato cakes tonight.

We felt this meal really was a little more like late 70's in it's taste so we hung a mirror ball in the kitchen while it cooked. The smoke from the plank had a really cool effect.

My husband and I aren't sure that the plank makes a difference in the oven, but the salmon was delicious. He agreed with the last reviewer that the sauce interferred with the salmon. However, we both agreed that the sauce worked well as a 'gravy' for the delicious mustard potatoes. A simple lettuce salad with cucumbers and tomatoes complimented the dish. We'll try the plank on the grill next time.

I must be very lucky here in the Twin Cities - planks were sitting on top of the refrigerator case holding the Salmon in the grocery store! Anyway, the plank is a must - it gives a nice flavor to the salmon. Originally I was going to make a simple Bernaise sauce for the salmon and I'm sorry I didn't go ahead with that plan - the problem in our household was the cloyingly sweet maple syrup glaze, we just felt it interfered with the wonderful taste of the salmon. Luckily we didn't pour it on the entire piece of fish and second servings were much better without it. We cooked this on the grill after soaking the plank in water for an hour (per the directions on the package)and it worked perfectly, the salmon was very moist after about 20 minutes cooking time (temperature of about 350 for about a pound of salmon). I served it with the Mustard Mashed Potatoes and my husband at first was a bit worried about that but loved them in the end, and fresh corn on the cob with the lime butter from another recipe on this website. I wouldn't serve the maple syrup sauce again but the technique for the salmon was very good.

I found 1/2C maple syrup ample for two sides of salmon. We cooked this on our barbecue in London for a party and people loved it. The cedar planks were a real talking point, as plank cooking is unknown here. The salmon melted in the mouth and was gone in a flash. We used leeks as a base and they all got eaten too! (We didn't attempt the mash, just served the salmon with a burgar wheat salad and roasted vegetable salad.)

The salmon was fantastic! I halved the glaze and reduced it a little too much so that it was a bit thick but the flavour was unreal! I made the mustard mashed potatoes and this brought the forks down from 4 to 3... although they tasted good I found the flavour too much competition for the salmon. I would make them to go with steak. I also made grilled asparagus tossed with dark sesame oil and soy sauce and this side dish was the perfect compliment.

I made this recipe tonight based on the rave reviews. I decided to submit a review as I have appreciated all the comments and suggestions from other reviewers. I have to say I was not as impressed as other reviewers. It was good but not great. I prefer classic mashed potatoes (on occasion), adding roasted garlic. I will not make the mustard mashed potatoes again but would consider the marindade (without simmering) on grilled or baked fish.

Rating: 4
Almost 3 yrs after finding this recipe, it remains one of our favorite planked salmon dishes. A few tips. I concur with another reviewer - skip the scallions. Cook the maple syrup glaze over low heat and it won't burn. Planks - don't worry about buying pre-made ones. Buy 3/4" thick untreated (it must be untreated) cedar at your local home center and have them cut it to about 12". Soak for 1 hour. If using inside, follow directions from the recipe, but place soaked plank inside of a pan in a 13" x 9" pan with about 1/4" of water on the bottom - this prevents smoking. Outside put the plank directly on your grill and cook for about 20 minutes. Baste throughout cooking. You'll find indoor and outdoor plank cooking is different, but both are delicious!

A couple of changes: I added some red pepper flakes to the sauce while it simmered (maybe 1/2 tsp.), and it had a nice spice to it. And, we grilled the salmon on the plank, instead of in the oven. It smelled wonderful while cooking on the grill. I served it with asian sesame noodles.

A unique presentation when you use the cedar plank to barbecue the salmon. Use just a bit of sauce so it doesn't drip into the BBQ, save the rest for passing, and do soak the board for 20 minutes in H2O prior to cooking outdoors. This recipe is so easy anyone can achieve rave reviews of their own!

Outstanding! Used the cedar planks in the oven with no problems, we plan on serving this at our next gourmet club dinner.

After reading all the rave reviews for this recipe, I am sorry to say I was underwhelmed. On top of that, because I used the cedar planks, which do not have sides on them, it made a mess of my oven. I will make this again, however. Next time I will bake it in a regular baking dish and I will consider broiling it briefly at the end to enhance the look of the finished product. The mustard mashed potatoes were indeed a good accompaniment. I peeled and cut them in wedges to boil them, then just mashed them the way I normally would with a mixer. I used Maille wholegrain dijon mustard and they were delicious.

I have made this recipe 4 times. It is excellent. Never used the plank - just a baking dish. The glaze stays in the freezer so I use it twice. Yummy is all I ever here. I'm making again this weekend!

My boyfriend made this for me for my birthday this past December. Every noise of pleasure you could possibly make was made while eating this dish. I felt like I was in a top-rated restaurant eating the Chef's specialty. Beyond superb!!!! I am making it this weekend for my mother's birthday.

Rating: 4
Easy and superb, both with and without the use of a cedar plank for baking; I used a rectangular pyrex dish as a substitute in the latter scenario. The amount of ginger and garlic specified for the glaze are perfect. For aesthetic reasons, I sieved the reduced glaze to remove the solids. I haven't had a problem with solidification of the reduced glaze as reported by other reviewers. I brushed ~ 1/4 C. of the glaze on the fish and used the rest as sauce. The Mustard Mashed Potatoes are the perfect accompaniment. If you can find and afford it, try the French mustard called Pommery in the mashed potato recipe.

I actually pan fried the salmon and served it over the mustard mashed potatoes with a slight drizzle of the glaze --it was such a hit at the dinner party. Will definitely make it again!

This is the best salmon ever. I have made it many times, and it always turns out wonderful. I have been told by others it is better than salmon they had at popular MN resturants. I make this with the ginger fried rice with shitake mushrooms, instead of the mashed potatoes, the ginger in the rice and in the maple glaze compliment each other wonderfully.

Wow. The sauce is amazing! I had a whole pink salmon and served it for a dinner party. Everyone loved it, though I think I over cooked the fish a bit. Served it with the mustard mashed potatoes and the parmesan asparagus recipe - it was a hit!

Living on the West Coast of Canada we have access to some of the finest fresh,fresh Sockeye salmon but believe it or not it can become rather boring. This recipe knocked my socks off, and my guests as well. I used the oven method with the dry plank as directed and the results were fantastic. I would only soak the plank when using the BBQ. I wish there was a higher number of forks than 4.

Rating: 4
WOW - incredible. I served this for a party of 6 - great friends - one of which was "A Cook From Hopewell Juntion, NY" - an excellent cook, I might add. A few notable tips. The glaze is very flavorful - you don't need a lot - I coted each as instructed prior to cooking and then brushed on another coating after 25 minutes of cooking - pouring more on after plating is just too much - there was no need to reserve half to the side - I wound up tossing it. 35 mintues in the oven was my cooking time but every oven is different - you'll see some lighter pinkish white substance starting to form - it's done. The mashed potatoes were an awesome complement - I included an 1/8 c cream with the milk and used 2 pitches of fine sea salt. I served with a slice lemon on the plate - great color, great flavor, and a tremendous meal. My guests brought some pretty awesome wines that accompanied the meal perfectly. The meal is much more impressive than it is difficult - it is a must make - just ask the "Cook from Hopewell" - she loved it and that means a lot.

It is amazing on the grill as well. Only use the cedar plank for about 15 minutes, keep the temp at 350 and cook for a total of 30 minutes. Adding more soy on the grill helps moisten the fish as well.

This is a keeper!!!! I've served just the salmon omitting the green onions and potatoes numerous times. One gals called and said she NEVER eats salmon, and thought this preparation was "to die for." The sauce/glaze is so incredible that I usually make 1 1/2 recipes so there's plenty of extra sauce for passing! Be sure to soak planks well and not over cook the salmon. Mine usually takes only 10-15 minutes.

Yes, certainly delicious, but I don't think I'll probably make it again. Being a real salmon lover, I felt the sweet maple syrup sauce hid the natural,wonderful flavor of the fish.

Oh my this was delicious! The mustard mashed potatoes were perfect with the salmon. The sauce was amazing. If you like spice use a lot of freshly ground black pepper. If your sauce hardens when it cools, reheat it slowly then add an ice cube to it before brushing on the fish.

We thought this dish was outstanding! This was my first time cooking salmon on a plank. The fish came out tender and moist and the glaze was delicious. Make sure you keep the remaining glaze warm otherwise it turns into a solid. Even my husband who is not a salmon lover really enjoyed it.

Excellent, really moist salmon when prepared on the plank. I simply bedded the salmon on some fresh rosemary and topped it with some coarse grained mustard. Much easier than pan searing & then roasting and far moister, try it!!

The first time I experienced "planked" salmon was at the Artist Point Restaurant at the Wilderness Lodge in Disney World. I was in love!

WOW!!!! This is a wonderful recipe! Unfortunatly I couldn't find a cedar plank so I used oak instead. Still the flavor is wonderfull. Just open your windows, it smokes a bit.

MAKE THIS!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was wonderful. The sauce did not harden in the pan, I wonder if those that had a problem with that cooked it at too high of temp? I also made the mustard mashed potatoes and it was perfect! I made this for friends who had never eaten salmon and they were thrilled with it!

This was excellent! I did use the plank and am convinced that the added smokey flavor was a big plus. Based on previous rating comments, I made only 1/2 recipe of sauce and reduced it for only about 5 minutes and was very pleased with the results. I Plan to produce this for my next meal for guests...and may just have to have it for dinner again TONIGHT! Yummy

Where we live we eat a lot of salmon and we usually prepare it fairly unadorned. But I had a piece of previously frozen King and I thought it might benefit from a sauce. This sauce was a little sweet for our taste. It had some interesting flavors and it wasn't that we didn't enjoy it, but I wouldn't put it on a piece of Copper River salmon or anything that was of excellent quality on its own. It was easy to prepare, though, and something different for us. I didn't use the plank as it was a last minute decision -- perhaps that was my downfall.

Rating: 4
OMG! This salmon dish is the best that I have ever had! I made this for my family and even the picky husband liked it! I would definitely cook on the cedar plank, it just gives it this wonderful flavor and the glaze it tops. I had lots of leftover glaze and did not add as much ginger after reading previous reviewer's comments. Didn't have the grain type mustard so made my own w/garlic, and such, but I think the mustard potatoes would be very complimentary. Also, I prefer steelhead to salmon. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM

Rating: 4
WOW! This is the most spectacular salmon I have ever made (or eaten, for the matter). I got my cedar plank at the local lumber yard (they gave it to me at no charge). The cedar aroma in the kitchen is soooooo woodsy - would be really nice for a winter dinner party. Also, I made two batches of glaze. I thought the ginger was too overpowering in the original recipe. Ended up using 1/4 to 1/2 of what it calls for and the ginger flavor still came through. I had a thick piece of salmon, it needed an extra 5-10 minutes of roasting. DELICIOUS!

Rating: 4
The salmon was excellent even though I did not use the cedar plank. The guests this was prepared for thought it was wonderful. Also prepared the mustard mashed potatoes with it. I used less than one cup of milk for the potatoes as we like them a little thicker. Would definitely make this again.

This was great! I made it for Christmas dinner on the grill. It got off to a rocky start when my husband set afire the plank I had been soaking all day. (He was making merry with the guests while I was making 50 things at once in the kitchen!!) We threw it on the ground and put out the fire with a garden hose! The top was only semi charred so we used it anyway. It was wonderful! I had no problems with the sauce. I think it is a perfect way to use a big piece of salmon! Can't wait to do it again!! (not the fire part!!)

This is beyond 4 forks. I've made it several times for small family gatherings (with & without plank). Also made for a large BBQ of 80 people. This weekend, will make for a wedding of 60-70. The plank does add a subtle flavor & aroma, but I've received great comments from just using the glaze. I don't reduce it all the way, I let the grill heat thicken it on the salmon. The scallions are a nice touch, but not necessary. Plank Cooking Rocks!

Oooh this recipe is just wonderful! I did not have the cedar plank, however, the salmon was still delicious! The glaze does tend to harden, however, I quickly put it into the microwave to warm it up--no problem. The glaze is a perfect compliment to the salmon. Instead of the recommended potato salad I used another delicious Epicurious recipe for Taragon Dill Potato Salad. This recipe will be added to my recipe box!

Rating: 3
Mmmmm mmmm! This was very, very good. Rather than cooking in the oven, I grilled it, and it was fantastic. Be sure to soak the plank in water for about 15 min if grilling, and shorten the cooking time to about 12-15 min per inch of thickness. I'd echo the sentiments of others regarding the glaze - really easy to overcook, and I did. Thinned it with water, lemon juice and soy, which was okay.

Didn't even follow the recipe to a "T" and still turned out pretty good. My husband and cousin LOVED it. Would have appreciated the cedar plank but didn't have one. Didn't have the time to reduce the syrup all that long either, so it was a bit runny (my fault). Very moist!!!

Rating: 1
I really wanted to love this dish, but I can't pretend I did. My first problem happened when I made the sauce. After preparing as directed, I allowed it to cool. By the time I came to use it, the glaze was so stiff it was almost impossible to dislogde the spoon I'd left in the saucepan! Needless to say, I pitched the glaze and just used remade it, sans the simmering step. And the plank made the fish taste okay, but salmon grilled straight on the barbecue is sooo much better, in my opinion. I'll never make this again, in case you couldn't have guessed.

Very good dish. Just make sure not to cook the maple syrup mixture too long, or it will get too thick to brush on the salmon. Williams-Sonoma sells cedar planks in sets of 4 for $12.95.

The glaze gave the fish a nice golden colour and a sweet tangy taste. However, I did not appreciate the bits of ginger and garlic that hardened on the fish. Next time, I think I'll strain the glaze to mellow out the flavours. Not a bad recipe overall.

I made this for friends and it recieved rave reviews. I would not change a thing in the recipe. When I brought the salmon in from the barbeque, the cedar plank was starting to burn and filled the house with that wonderful smell that you can only get from cedar. I served it with garlic mashed pototoes instead and aspargus for color. It was a great dinner.

This is a wonderful recipe. I halved the marinade as many others suggested and found the amount sufficient. I was not impressed with the potatoes, however.The recipe sounded better than they actually tasted. Too bland.

Rating: 4
Variation on a theme: I used the sauce (cut in half - it was plenty)and used it for super easy salmon, without the plank. I cubed two sweet potatoes, roasted them for 20" at 450, flipped them and roasted 10 more minutes, then pushed them to the side of the pan and added salmon topped with the sauce for an additional 10-15" (I use convection bake on my Jenn-Air.) Served with a side of spinach topped with lemon juice to contrast the sweet tastes. About 15" hands-on time and nice enough for a casual dinner party.

Rating: 4
This is a great dish and so easy. We made it Christmas Eve & didn't have to worry about it until we served. We bought a cheap cedar plank from Home Depot. I'd recommend using all of the sauce before cooking because it gets really hard once it starts to cool

I've made this about gazillion times, with the same cheap plank I got from a lumber yard. Periodically my husband scrapes the charred stuff off, and I soak it before heating it rather than oiling it. Last night, though, I made it for a dinner party with the mustard mashed potatoes, the cracked pepper biscuits, and the spinach salad (sans lentils) in the original menu. Omigod it was to die for. I make only half the maple sauce and pour it over the fish before cooking. The sauce added after cooking turns into hard maple candy on the fork and adds nothing.

Rating: 3
This is very good. I did a 2.6# fillet, and the time required was not nearly enough. It took an hour, and it was, by no means, dry. Like other reviewers, halved the sauce (plenty) and added pepper flakes (good idea). If you use a homemade plank (that doesn't have a grove for liquids), put a large sheet pan under the plank; put it in when you preheat the pan, and leave it. Really saves the oven.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent recipe and easy to do most everything ahead of time. Tried it on cedar planks purchased at a lumber yard (5 for $4!) I would use more scallions next time and not put them on as early as salmon because they got very soft and stringy. I wasn't sure what grill temp to use so mine took about 25 minutes on a slow grill. Sauce is excellent! Will add red pepper flakes or thai peppers next time for a little heat. Perfect with the mustard potatoes. Enjoyed with a cabernet and syrah blend wine.

Rating: 4
Like Carol, we made this on the Weber! We bought 8 ft of Cedar at the lumbar yard and cut it up as we need it. I have made this twice. As suggested by a couple of other reviewers, I halved the recipe and it made a generous marinade. It really isn't necessary to make a glaze with other half. I also added a tablespoon of dijon and a tablespoon of brown sugar as suggested by someone else. Finally, I put a generous amount of dill on the top of it. It was fantastic! Next time, I think I will cook on a bed of leeks. Enjoy! We certainly have!

This is a great recipe! I made this in our Weber grill and also added rosemary to the bed of onions.This perfumed the salmon perfectly...the left overs also made a dynamite smoky salmon fish spread. You must try this one!

Planking is it!! Try it on the BBQ grill. Heat that grill (gas or charcoal) nice and hot, soak the plank @ least 3 hrs., put the plank on to preheat 'til it pops, then the salmon. It comes off in a bit less than 20 min. & perfect! Try Tri Tip or steak on oak, or pork on maple and try different soaking liquids.

Loved it, the combination of flavors was perfect! It really is better on cedar. For those who in the city and are not near a lumber store, try www.surlatable.com. They sell a set of 8 7" x 15" planks for about $31 which includes shipping. Your extras make a nice simple gift when you include this recipe! They also sell a more decorative and larger plank, and offer a matching caddy if you want something a little fancier.

This is a great recipe -- I did it without the plank the 1st time and loved it. Last night I cooked the salmon on the plank with this glaze: 2 minced cloves garlic, 2 tbsp. brown sugar, 2 tbsp. dijon mustard, 1 tbsp. olive oil, salt and pepper. Easy and incredible, and a yummy smell of cedar through the house. I got my plank from Home Depot and didn't soak it -- no problem with smoke. I think lemon rice and asparagus would be perfect with this.

This was so good!! I went to a local lumberyard and purchased a 17" piece of clear red cedar. I washed it and soaked it in water for 3 hours. The salmon was delicious. I only made 1/2 the recipe for the sauce and it was plenty. By the way, the wood can be used again, it came clean and there wasno smoking as other noted. perhaps submerging it in cold water for 3 hours helped. I don't think I'll make salmon any other way!!!

I made this dish without the cedar plank(some people have an allergic reaction to cedar). I added instead a tiny bit of liquid smoke. I also used 5 lbs of fish and there was more than enough sauce, use a half recipe if you're cooking 2.5 lbs. The salmon turned out great, everyone loved it!

Made this for a dinner party of 12. I used about 3.5 lbs. salmon and had leftovers. I think you could reduce the sauce recipe by half if you are making the original amount of salmon. I bought a 2' x 12" untreated cedar board at the lumber yard, washed it and soaked it for two hours. It worked great! It only cost $3 versus $50 for ordering a board over the Net. Oh, yes, everyone loved the salmon and potatoes.

Perfect west coast dish! We soaked the cedar plank for about 1hr and did the fish on the BBQ, so no problem with the smoke in the house- just tempting the neighbours! I do not think that the plank could be used again as it was pretty charred. This salmon looks as fantastic as it tastes.

After reading so many rave reviews I had to try this recipe and I was not disappointed. It turned out delicious even though I cheated and used half the amount of maple syrup (at $32/litre) it was hard to justify using a whole cup and I have no idea where to find cedar planks. Despite that it still had a somewhat smoky taste. Next time I'm going to try it on the barbeque.

I'm not a big fan of salmon, but, this was really delicious. I didn't have a cedar plank or green onions, so I sliced a large vidalia onion and put the fish on top of that in a baking pan. Also, I added about 1/4 tsp. of red curry paste and a tablespoon of hoisin sauce to the glaze. I didn't bother to divide it, I just poured all of it over the fish and put it in the oven. It was very easy to make and my whole family loved it.

This recipe deserves "Dozens of Shooting Stars", not just 4 Forks!! My husband and I went to a lumber yard for the cedar planks. The owner said I could have several slabs if only I promise to FAX him the recipe. Just the description alone made him drool!! I coated the planks with olive oil lightly once a day for 3 days. I followed the recipe exactly and our 6 guests all said it was the best salmon they have ever eaten!! All of the guests have eaten at many fine restaurants, so I value their compliments. The cedar planks placed such a wonderfully rich flavor to the salmon. We had some exquisite Pinot Noirs and Zinfandels to accompany the Salmon. I did not do the mashed potatoes. To heavy, we are carbo avoiders. I roasted asparagus coated in olive oil, parsely, coarse salt and pepper. Served with a squeeze of lemon. Roast at 400. Place in a single layer baking pan covered with foil for 10 minutes , remove cover roast 10 more. Voila!! A wonderful side dish to a FABULOUS Salmon.

Really good and very easy. I went down to the lumber yard with _Gourmet_ magazine, and they made me a cedar plank just like the picture. My guests were impressed.

I've made this several times. Always gets rave reviews. I bake it in a glass baking dish as I don't have cedar planks lying around.
