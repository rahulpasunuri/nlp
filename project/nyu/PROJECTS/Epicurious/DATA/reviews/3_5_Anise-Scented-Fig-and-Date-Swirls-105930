These are my favorite Christmas cookie and I've made them every year since the recipe was printed in 2001. Of course, I've made a few of my own modifications. When I puree the figs and dates, I substitute for the water 1/4 c. orange juice and then bring it up to 1/3 by adding Sambuca or, even better, Pastis de Marseille. The added anise flavor in the filling is really superb. Also, the last few years I've developed an allergy to cow dairy. So I substitute goat butter for the regular butter and chevre for the cream cheese and I think it turns out even better that way.

I have made this recipe many times in many ways. One of my favorite variations is to pile on the filling and make a giant bear claw type pastry with slashes throughout for the filling to ooze through. It also works well for little sweet empanada type cookies. I also use the mortar and pestle and the flecks of anise are reminiscent of cookies from Jordan. These are a hit every time I make them.

I made these for an Xmas cookie exchange and they were very popular - I won 2nd place out of over 20 cookie entries! I don't have a food processor, so I used my Braun hand blender; it was a little tedious, but it worked. As suggested by other reviewers, I substituted a tablespoon of honey for the sugar that is mixed with the fruit. The only other change was I ground my anise in a mortar and pestle, since i don't have a spice grinder. The dough was therefore full of little specks of anise, but they didn't show once the cookies were baked. I used Sun-dried California mission figs and Amport whole pitted dates (i.e. nothing fancy)

I make these every year for my Christmas cookie boxes. They are a bit fussy, so I make mine over the course of a few days, allowing ample time for chilling. The dough rolls out easier when it's stone-cold, and they are easier to cut as well. I've also found that I only need about half of the filling for the dough, though no other reviewer mentioned this. It must be just me. The crunch of the sugar on the outside is delightfully paired with the soft cream cheese dough; don't omit this step. I kind of sigh when I start to make these (all those steps! and in December!) but when they come out of the oven and I taste them, I wonder all over again how good they are.

I thought my attempts to make this recipe were a lost cause when I added the entire 1/2 cup of sugar to the date/fig mixture... but I figured I'd keep going and just see how they turned out. Not too shabby! Of course, next time I will follow the recipe more closely to get a more delicate flavor. They were a little Fig Newton-y with all of that sugar added. I chilled the cookies in the freezer and baked them progressively over the course of a few days. Unlike my experience with most cookie recipes, these actually made the 3 dozen promised! These are definitely getting on the cookie roster again next Christmas.

Winner! Christmas Gift Cookie 2008! I made these along with two other cookies to square off on which I'd give as gifts. These were the most fun to make and came out the best. I substituted 1 Tb. of honey for the 2 Tb. of granulated sugar in the filling because though dates and figs are sweet enough, honey tastes better with them if anything at all. When you open a gift tin of these, the delicate aroma is a very pleasant introduction.

I especially liked the anise scented cookie, the flavour is perfectly balanced and the cream cheese makes the dough very rich and tasty. The only thing I would change it to ensure the filling is spread out thinly. Mine turned out thicker than in the picture, and I would prefer a smaller more delicate cookie. Otherwise this was very nice indeed.

As others have said, these were really superb. I'd definitely make again. They are really beautiful, too. Perfect for a party or the holidays. Mine came out much larger than I'd anticipated--I think I increased the cooking time by two minutes.

IF you like Anise and figs and dates, these are fabulous. Light and soft with a nice crunch, and visually interesting to boot. Next time, though, I'd keep some or all of the sugar out of the date/fig mixture -- they're quite sweet enough. I put them in the freezer for a little bit before slicing, and flipped them over after about 7 minutes of cooking, and gave them 5 minutes after that, which seemed about perfect.

I make these very often. They are so delicious! I do make a small change to the recipe though. I use the figs only. No sugar in the filling. I do add at least 1 tablespoon of orange zest and some orange juice to moisten the fig paste. Plus one or two tablespoon of Grand Marnier Liquor. Also, I add a teaspoon of Sambuca Anise Liquor to the dough. Really fastastic! My favorites!

It was all right, but nothing special. The filling got squeezed out when I rolled it. The cookie was nice and light, but not interesting.

I made these cookies for a big party and they vanished so quickly that people must have been stuffing them into their pockets AND mouths. They're fragrant, beautiful and all-around delightful. I followed the recipe to the letter, and didn't have any browning problems (used silpat.) I found it helpful to stick the assembled spiral logs in the freezer. Slicing and baking the dough frozen helps prevent you from getting D-shaped cookies, keeping the slices perfectly rounded.

After making these, how can anyone eat Fig Newtons again? These cookies have an excellent, fruity-yet-savory taste, and they're so fragrant that I'd make them just to have the house smell so good. I agree that browning is a concern--turning halfway through helped, and I will try using Silpat next time.

If you're accustomed to only ever eating Oreos and Pepperidge Farm cookies, then you might think these cookies have a "weird taste" and even that they "suck." Otherwise, you'll find that these are fantastic cookies. The dough itself smells so incredible, I almost couldn't wait to bake them before eating them! I made about 15 different kinds of Christmas cookies last year, and these are the ones that my husband loved and has asked me repeatedly to make again. They're surprisingly easy to make, although a bit time-consuming, so I can't make them as often as I'd like, but I will definitely make them again this year for the holidays.

I make these cookies very often. I find that using just half of the figs and dates is much better because the cookies keep better once they are in a jar. Lovely! for extra anise taste add one teaspoon of anise extract to the dough. Of course, I do not agree with the reviwer that says these cookies "suck". This person should take baking classes.

While this recipe takes patience, the end result is a flavorful beautiful cookie. Will make again this year at holiday time. I baked on a silpat mat which helped to prevent browning.

Very good, anise adds interesting flavor. I even added some extract to the dough. Be careful, because they brown easily, I turned my second batch over midway.

These have a peculiar taste that nobody liked, myself included. Most of them ended up inthe trash. One overheard comment: "Ew, these cookies suck".

These are indescribably good -- and gorgeous and lots of fun to make. I could've eaten them all. I will add these to my food gift list. Thanks, Epicurious, for this marvelous recipe.

I usually make notations in my cookbooks with Ex being the best I have rated. However, these cookies are beyond that and are rated "to die for" in my book.

These cookies are gorgeous! The raw sugar really does add a certain "holiday sparkle." My husband and his friends loved them, but I personally would go a little easier on the anise next time.

I just made these cookies tonight. They are delicious! I didn't expect to like them as much as I do, seeing that I am not all that enthusiastic about figs and dates. However, these cookies have a blend of crunchy and chewy that really works well. Plus, the dough is very buttery and just plain yummy. The raw sugar on the outside is a great touch--don't omit it. One piece of advice--flip the dough over (still in wax paper) after you roll it out. This way, you won't have to worry about wrinkles when making the log. By the way, I was impatient and made a few cookies right away, after only chilling the dough for an hour. It worked fine. I don't think you really need to chill for four hours. Still, I am going to leave the rest overnight just in case. I used figs and dates from the bulk foods section of Whole Foods. They worked perfectly.
