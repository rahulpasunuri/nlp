Delicious. Used Aidells all natural and organic chicken cajun sausage, 12 ounces of it was enough for 4 people. Some small variations: Blanched kale in pasta water for only 1 minute, just enough to soften it. Deglazed the pan with white wine after sautéing sausage. Added the kale, some roasted garlic (very nice addition I think), and did not really need the broth. I shaved parmesan instead of grating it and like it a lot like that.

I loved this recipe. I added three cloves of garlic, chopped onion and more kale as suggested by reviews and it came out light but flavorful.

I've made this quite a few times now, and keep changing it a little each time. I've cut the oil almost completely out, maybe half a Tbs, most of it is wasted. I deglazed with a 1/4 c white wine and at the same time added 2 cloves of minced garlic, then added the kale without blanching, the broth, etc. I found blanching the kale overcooked it, even when I cut the time in half. Not blanching at all it was a little underdone. So next time I will massage the raw kale with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkling of salt to tenderize it and then saute...I think this might be the happy medium.

This recipe is great! I added the garlic as suggested by others. I also added a can of canellini beans because I can't get enough of them. My husband said the beans made the dish, and was much more flavorful than he thought it would be. I'll definitely make again, only with more kale, and without blanching the kale.

Fast, easy, and yummy. For my first attempt cooking with kale, this was a winning recipe! To the cooked sausage and kale, I added diced baby portabella mushrooms sauteed in garlic, and a splash of white wine to loosen all the tasty brown bits from the bottom of the saute pan. Would do it the exact same way when cooking it again. Enjoy!

I like the ingredient list and the simplicity of this dish, but I didn't think the result was as good as other simple pasta recipes that I make. I used a good quality chicken and herb sausage from my local butcher, I increased the kale, and added sauteed onion and garlic. Perhaps using pork sausage would have been better. I'd say that this is worth a try because so many reviewers loved it, but I probably won't make it again.

This is a family favourite and I have made it many times...making it again tonight in fact! I was surprised how flavourful it was the first time I made it, considering how few ingredients are in it. I always add some garlic, and sometimes some hot pepper flakes, sometimes a splash of lemon to finish. Don't be shy with the kale, I usually add lots..it is so good for you!

Made this last night with our kale from CSA. Changes I made based on other review recommendations was adding 2 cloves of garlic prior to added kale to the pan, a pinch of kosher salt once I added the pasta and squeeze of lemon juice on each plate as it definitely needed acidity. Overall really yummy. My hubby and I enjoyed it!

This recipe is a WINNER!!! I make it several times a month in winter. It has become a family favorite: parents and daughter love the flavor; I love the ease of preparation and the fact that it's a totally healthy meal in one bowl. I do add extra kale, about twice as much as called for. If I'm using fresh kale from the garden, I don't pre-blanch it (just saute with the sausage) but old, tough grocery store stuff often benefits from the blanching process. I sometimes add red pepper flakes and/or garlic, especially if using mild sausage. My daughter commented that it can be a bit greasy (depending on what sausage you use- ours is from a local farmer and does tend to be fatty) so I've started draining a bit of the fat out of the sausage pan before mixing it all together. We use parmesan cheese.

Rating: 4
A family standby. I use whole-wheat rotini for the pasta, and chicken-apple sausage which gives a lovely flavour. I usually chop and sauté an onion and some garlic. The kale just gets steamed with the sausage and onions just before tossing with the pasta.

I created an epicurious account just so I could review this recipe! And it is, in one word, incredible!! These are the slight changes I made: I sauteed 4 cloves of garlic in the olive oil, then I added in and browned 1 lb of high-quality spicy chorizo. I used linguine instead of fettucine, regular chicken broth instead of low-sodium, and added some red pepper flakes and a shake of salt and ground pepper. I didn't end up using the additional 1/2 cup of cooking water. FANTASTIC!!! Thanks for the recipe! Also - I don't think it makes 4-6 main-course servings... I'd say it makes 4 max, maybe 3 large bowls.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic! I pretty much followed the recipe but used a combination of kale and chard freshly picked from my garden. One other change - I used chicken breast meat instead of sausage to make it a little more healthy. I will be making this again...soon!

To those who don't find this dish flavorful enough, try adding a bit of minced garlic and a few squirts of fresh lemon juice just before serving. Often simple pasta dishes like this get just the zing they need from a bit of lemon! If you like that, you may want to try adding a bit of lemon zest to the mix as well.

I'll be adding this to my list of easy, satisfying fall meals that are good for me, my kids, my houseguests...I used good quality pork bulk sausage, medium egg noodles, and beet greens (because that's what I had) and I added minced garlic.

This will become a favorite. I used a fennelly Italian sausage and a toothy fettuccine--12 ounces instead of 8. Wonderful flavor. The texture of the kale is great with the fettuccine.

Delicious. Made as written except used broccoli because the kale didn't look fresh in the grocery store. Next time I may try sauteeing some sliced mushrooms with the hot sausage, although the recipe is really tasty and abundant as it is. The 1/2 pound of fettuccine was enough for four large servings. Used imported Pecorino. Yum!

"Yum,yum,YUM!" said my boyfriend, who normally doesn't like pasta dishes unless they are in a saucy sauce. Glad I read some of the other reviews first though. Without using any broth, it was plenty salty from the sausage and cheese. In fact, I'm glad I served it with steamed unsalted veggies to dilute the saltiness. Just use the pasta water for all added liquid. Also, other reviewers said to use more kale. I didn't have more, but I did have some Swiss chard, so I added that along with the kale. It was perfect. I also added 2 smashed garlic cloves with the sausage. They added a great flavor to the dish.

This is the second time I've made this recipe in the last 3 weeks. It's easy and delicious. I used fusilli instead of fettucine. Used 1 lb of pasta, 2 bunches of purple kale and probably about 1.25 pounds of chicken sausage...both mild and hot (kept the hot separate since the kids don't like spicy food). It's crazy how the simple ingredients make such a delicious and light pasta dish.

Excellent, the only thing I can say is I found it too salty. I would probably use fresh, instead of frozen, sausages and to de-glaze less chicken stock and more of the boiling liquid. I would also use more kale as well (if you buy a bushel, you can easily use the whole thing for this recipe).

I made the dish according to the recipe except that I used multigrain penne which worked really well.

This was delicious --fast, easy and a great way to use up some kale we had on hand. We made some substitutions: organic chicken and turkey roasted red pepper sausage, and goat's milk feta cut into small cubes, since we were out of Pecorino Romano. We also reduced the blanching time for organic kale to three minutes, and only cooked it with the sausage for 2 minutes. It turned out perfect. We will definitely make this dish again.

How these few humble ingredients work together as they do I have no idea, but it was excellent! Modifications I used: added red pepper flakes, a couple cloves of garlic and some frozen roasted red peppers to balance out the only sausage I had on hand (natural, locally produced extra sage breakfast sausage). If this worked, I'm sure pretty much any sausage would. I look forward to trying it with soyrizo for a totally guilt free meal!

My husband who is a fussy eater LOVED it!

Truly delicious just the way it is!!! I wondered while making it if I shouldn't add some onions, garlic, etc but when it was complete I was glad I hadn't. We have fresh local kale from our winter organic CSA, used all-natural sweet italian sausage (added red pepper flakes to mom & dad's portions afterwards) and high- quality parmesan. I also used plain old dried pasta. DELICIOUS, a great one- dish meal. Don't omit the pasta water, it does help bind the "sauce" to the pasta.

Well, I started eating this dish 10 minutes ago...and I'm still eating. That's a good thing. I'm no culinary expert, but like many before me I made slight modifications. e.g., Bachelor that I am, I cut the portions in half. I added some diced red onions and a small amount (1 tsp.) of garlic paste at the start with the spicy sausage and olive oil. (Also, it was turkey sausage, which you should all try some day --healthy and tasty!) Rather than add the reserve water from the blanched kale pot, I subbed in the same amount of a white cooking chardonnay, along with the chicken broth, to the sausage/vegetable mix. Then, after a dash of red chili flakes, I cooked this a few minutes to thicken it just a bit, but still leaving it a nice liquid consistency. While tossing this with the fettucine, I crumbled gorgonzola instead of the pecorino. I just don't buy pecorino so often, and there's always some kind of blue cheese hanging around in my fridge. (it all is blue cheese if you LEAVE it hanging around for a while, really) WOW!! The cheese with the chili flakes on one bite, the sausage with the onion and kale on the next. I'm glad, since not all of my attempts from Epicurious recipes turn out well. Maybe it's because I often scrap the recipe and wing it. I made changes with this one, but the base ingredients and techniques stayed the same. I'll add this to my small pasta repertoire.

Rating: 3
Wonderful. A simple, spicy way to get our greens. Used 1 lb kale, and very hot Italian sausage and handmade linguine - both fresh from the market. I think these two factors really played a role in our enjoyment of the dish. I found the look of the sausage somewhat unappealing, so will attempt to slice it somehow instead of crumble it next time. Yes, there will definitely be a next time!

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorites! It taste great with rainbow swiss chard, but any greens will do. Very important to use high quality sausage and cheese. I disagree with those who dont think it is important to reserve the pasta water for the sauce. this is a must because the water has starch in it from boiling the noodles and helps that sauce cling to the pasta better.

Absolutely delicious. The kale I had was from a local CSA and it was young and tender (I nearly mistook it for lettuce when I first saw it), so no need to pre-blanch it as instructed. I also as other reviewers suggested started off with a saute of shallots and garlic with red pepper flakes, to infuse the oil which is the base for the sauce, and that really added a nice touch. I found spicy italian chicken sausage that worked extremely well in this. I also liked the rotini instead of fettucini, but I'm sure either would work. A definite keeper!

Rating: 3
I didn't follow the recipe exactly but the changes I made didn't affect the intended flavor, I don't think. I found that I had to cook the kale for quite a while to get it tender. That seems to be my experience with kale. Finally, I just added the noodles (I used egg noodles) into the pot of kale and cooked them both together. I also used only 1/2 lb. of sausage and threw in some sliced cremini mushrooms. A good dish to get my boyfriend to eat his veggies. (So that would be true with kids, too).

Rating: 3
I've made this several times, to the letter of the recipe and with adjustments, some of which were suggested by others. I'm all for making things easier in the kitchen, and in this instance, I see absolutely no reason to blanch the kale - like another reviewer said, just add it to the sausage and it'll cook down perfectly well. I also don't bother with the hassle of saving some of the pasta water - if I need additional liquid, which is rarely, I'll add in some of the rest of the can of chicken broth I've opened. This dish is definitely better with the shallot & garlic added, and rather than fettucini, I much prefer it with a shorter pasta that's better equipped to hold the flavor of the sauce - rotini is a favorite choice. I usually use hot italian sausage when making this, and agree that the quality of the sausage comes into play in this recipe. This recipe has become a regular staple in our house. Also very yummy as leftovers and it can't be beat for an office lunch the next day!

Rating: 4
This is one of our favorite weeknight dinners - delicious, quick and a great way to use that powerhouse veggie, kale. I double the kale, as 1/2 lb seemed too little the first time I made it. I've made it with both hot and sweet sausage, and it's delicious both ways. I think boiling the pasta in the water the kale has cooked in gives it a great flavor, and the cheese tossed with it doesn't hurt either!

This was great and easy too! As another reviewer mentioned I think the quality of the sausage is important. I used a good one. Changes: I added shallot and garlic to the sausage while browning. Only par-boiled the kale for 60 seconds (which was plenty), I forgot to save some of the pasta water so added a bit more chicken stock and about 1/4 cup of white wine to prevent dryness. Turned out great. What a terrific way to eat Kale and have it taste good too :)

We really liked this, but have tweaked the recipe for the next time: The sausage was overwhelming, so I decreased it to 1/2 lb. We're trying to eat more veggies, and I thought the kale kind of got lost, so I doubled it. I think I might try it with shorter pasta, too... But great combo of flavors, and don't leave out the cheese, it really added to the dish!

This is an outstanding recipe. I added finely minced shallot, garlic and diced red pepper and sauteed them along with the sausage, which was a fairly standard hot Italian. I also used chicken stock from a cube (sorry), because I had no fresh stock made, and it was still delicious. I reconstituted the cube with a little of the water from blanching the kale. The pasta itself was incredibly tasty - even though I couldn't see a sauce, it had taken on all of the mingled flavours. I'm going to have to stop myself making this over and over so that I don't get tired of it. Inspired and simple.

Rating: 3
Very good. I really like that the kale is cooked in the same water that the pasta will be cooked in; it's efficient and I feel like it must keep at least some of the nutrients from going down the drain. I did not have any problems with the finished dish being watery, but then again I almost always make pasta in a similar manner (i.e., with vegetables, olive oil, etc., and a bit of the pasta cooking water returned to the pot to form a sauce) so I have developed a feel for how much of the water to splash in. It's best to start with 1/4 cup; you can always add more if the pasta looks too dry.

Deeeelicious. Like the cook from Connecticut, I too have made a similar dish with broccoli rabe & orechiette. I think I'll try it with different greens - this has opened my mind to various interpretations of this dish! To the cook who said it was too liquidy - I suggest you maybe cook the liquid a bit to reduce it AND make sure to toss the pasta well - it should absorb the liquid and become oh so flavourful! (no I did not misspell "flavourful" - that's how we spell it in Canada.) Bon Appetit!

I made this last night for dinner and it's great! I always have greens on hand and when I have lots, I blanch them and freeze them in individual packages, that combined with a package of morningstar sausage crumbles made this dish a snap to put together and really healthful! I made this for one, but basically I added some chicken broth to a saute pan, added the frozen kale, brought this to a boil, reduced the heat, added a 1/2 cup of crumbles and when the fettuccine was al dente, drained it and added it to the saute pan to finish cooking. Quick, healthful and oh so good!

We didn't like the strong kale flavor, thought that the liquid made it runny and didn't add anything, and suspected that adding a whole lot more cheese would improve it, but then again that would make it another dish entirely.

My husband and I just finished eating this for dinner. It was SO good, we ate our meal in complete silence, save the sound of our munching. I added two cloves of garlic while I cooked the sausage (I made my own sausage), and used 2/3 cup of the pasta water mixed with 1T chicken/tomato boullion instead of 2/3 cup chicken broth. Otherwise everything was the same. We sat down to eat in less than thirty minutes. Fast, simple and delicious - can't wait to make it again!

Hey! This is one of my longtime quick-dinner standbys! I skip the step of blanching the kale. I just add it a few handfuls at a time to the browned sausage, along with a little liquid, and put a lid on it. The kale wilts and makes room to add more. It cooks perfectly fine this way. I suspect it picks up more of the flavor from the sausage, too. This is equally good with crumbled feta on top instead of the pecorino romano. Everyone at my house (two adults, three kids) eats this dish happily.
