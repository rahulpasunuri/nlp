A fabulous sandwich that is very filling. The dressing is the best part of this recipe. I found the preparation instructions were more helpful from a different Epicurious recipe - Reuben Sandwich by Arthur Schwartz. I followed those directions using these ingredients and I will DEFINITELY make this again. Yum.

This was excellent, especially the "Russuan" dressing.

Hubby stole my sandwich and I had to make another... the smell got to him. This is a great way to 'hide' turkey if you are burnt out. The sauce was yummy. Any type of a Reuben... how can you go wrong?!
