This recipe is a good reminder that any pureed carrot soup recipe can be served cold. However, a few critical oversights: brown the onions first, then add carrots, some lemon juice & white wine, the spices & the honey, & let sautee for a few minutes. Then add the water & the stock, & proceed with the recipe as written. The initial browning & sautee will give the soup some much-needed depth & flavor.

I like the soup but did make it modified. I omitted the lemon and added ginger. I also flopped the ratio of water and chicken broth. I am very excited about making it again as I feel it was easy and great way to get my family to eat its veggies. Will probably serve with sour cream of a swirl of cream.

The soup is in the fridge chilling now and it was incredibly easy to make. I added a few more seasonings to it but my sister, who does not like carrots, tried it and said it was okay. High praise from her. I liked that I could leave the soup to cook on its own while I took care of the rest of the meal. I will definately make this again.

This was easy, fast, and wonderful for a hot day. The spices were not too strong for the kids, but interesting enough for us.

Easy and not bad, but just not inspiring. Needs a fair amount of pepper as it is slightly sweet and mellow. Wife and I finished the batch I made cause we didn't want it to go to waste, but neither of us were excited for the second dose

The first time I made this used fresh carrots and found that too much of the liquid was absorbed by the time the carrots were soft enough to blend. Had to add lots more broth, then more honey and lemon. REsult was delicious and plentiful! The second time I used tiny frozen carrots and it was even better. Both times added a little curry powder. Like the idea of grated ginger and will try that next time. Added a dollop of yoghourt to the serving.

Didn't have enough carrots on hand but had parsnips so I used one carrot and 3 parsnips. Also, added a one-inch piece of fresh ginger that I peeled and minced to the ingredients. Delicious.

I had to add more carrots to get the proper consistency and even then it wasn't thick enough. Good flavors

So simple, so healthy, and so different. I'd never know it had no fat. Such a delightful taste of summer, and adds great color to any menu!

Easy recipe, especially if you have an immersion blender. The second time I made it, I used a high-end curry powder instead of the spices listed...very good.

Substituting creme fraiche for sour cream does wonders for this recipe.

This is an excellent easy summer soup. I was generous with the seasonings and added a dollop of low-fat sour cream to the top of each serving.
