The recipe was delicious! I will definitely make it again. Only in America would this yield six servings. I made four in large ramekins, and four more in small ramekins. The large ones, which equate to 1 serving, were more than any of us could finish. Fortunately, they store well in the freezer. In fact, we all felt it was better after a night in the freezer. Meringue and all!

so easy...so good...the kids had their faces in the dishes and their mouths full the whole time! they thought it was so cool that ice cream went in the oven. we used neopolitan ice cream and will probably let everyone pick their own flavor next time. the cake is VERY rich so i used slightly smaller pieces than recommended.

I gave this only 3 forks because the cake did not turn out. I am an experienced baker and the cake ended up hard on the outside, undercooked on the inside, even though I followed the recipe to the letter -- the cooking time was way off for some reason. I ended up using another chocolate torte recipe instead (after much time wasted). The rest of the recipe/instructions worked out perfectly. I followed a previous poster's advice and mixed fresh raspberries in with moderately priced vanilla ice cream and put them into my deep freeze overnight. The meringue worked well and I served it immediately after taking it out of the oven. I did not let the ice cream sit too long (about 7 mins) so no melting problems. The dessert was a hit with my guests -- even the non-dessert types cleaned their dishes! I would definitely make it again. It's wonderful for dinner parties.

I have made this many times now and I use each quest's favorite flavor of icecream. I even used pound cake and strawberry icecream for a non-chocolate person. I freeze the whole thing and then let them thaw a bit and bake them up and serve. Never fails.

Man, oh, man, is this dish GREAT!!! I made it as one big baked Alaska and cut it into slices. Like another reviewer, I couldn't find any raspberry ice cream, either, so I used strawberry and served the slices with strawberry coulis. HUGE HIT!!! Georgeous, too! Humorous trivia note: my chef husband, who is French, told me that the French call baked Alaska a Norwegian omelette.

I did not rate this recipe as I made so many changes that were disasterous. Let me tell you what NOT to do! Do not use the pre-separated pasteurized egg whites as they do not get stiff enough. Do not be fooled by the picture of lemon meringue pie on the box. Do not use Hagen Daaz stawberry ice cream or Ben & Jerrys Cherry Garcia ice cream as they do not get hard enough. I think they are too rich and soft. And last, I took another cook's advise and did not use individual containers for the cakes, I just arranged them on a baking sheet with parchment paper. The meringue and ice cream melted into one giant glop. When I tried to lift them out of the pan for serving, the parchment paper was so wet that it got on the plates. What a mess!! I made so many mistakes. But, the cakes were really good and everyone ate every bite of the Baked Alaska soup. It was hilarious, actually! The kids had a great time helping. I made a berry-cherry sauce and put it into two plastic squeeze bottles so the kids could decorate the plates. Problems notwithstanding, a good time was had by all.

I made this tonight for an anniversary party and everyone was deeply impressed. Because I couldn't find raspberry icecream and didn't own the proper gratin dishes, I made the following changes: I baked the cake mixture in oven safe ramekins. I then cooled the cakes and filled them with a mixture of premium vanilla icecream and pitted bing cherries. I froze everything overnight. Before dinner I placed the ramekins in my fridge so that the icecream and cherries could soften (they were rock hard!). An hour later I made the meringue (in 5 minutes flat) and popped them in the oven. It worked beautifully! Because all I had to do was make the meringue, it was a lot easier than most "assemble at the last minute" desserts. I can't wait to try this with other ice cream fillings. Finally, I have to agree, the cake recipe is sublime, I'm going to save it for Passover!

The cake base is just unbelievable! Fantastic! I made this for my Christmas brunch and got rave reviews. I didn't use the gratin dish, just cut out 3 inch rounds and froze them. I used vanilla icecream mixed with crunched up candy canes (a bit runny, will try something else next year) and prefroze those. When both elements were cold, I made the meringue, assembled them and froze that as well! So all I had to do was heat up the oven, bake and serve. Easy! I alsy tinted the meringue pink and sprinkled crushed candy canes on each plate. Just beautiful!

This recipe is gluten free and vegetarian-friendly - not an easy combination! I did not use the rapberry icecream recipe, but just melted vanilla icecream, mixed in some chopped frozen raspberries and a bit of sugar and refroze the icecream. The dessert was a bit too sweet - perhaps a blander icecream would be a good alternative. Or just use smaller dishes so the serves are not so intimidating! It was great to impress a ceoliac with a special dessert, as the often miss out.
