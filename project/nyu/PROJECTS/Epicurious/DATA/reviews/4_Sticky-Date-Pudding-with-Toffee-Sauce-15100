Actual cooking time is 60-75 minutes - test with a toothpick in center to make sure it comes out clean. Otherwise, this is probably THE most delicious dessert I've ever made. Been making it for years and never had anyone leave more than a crumb on their plates. I serve it with vanilla ice cream. It easily serves 9 if you cut the 8x8 cake 3x3, but you could easily stretch it to 12 if you cut it 3x4.

Well, I sure wish I had read the other reviews and I would have baked another 15-25 minutes. I added a few minutes, but we basically ate dough. Very sweet, but I imagine could be quite good with the proper time followed. I used an 8" round pan also, so it was even worse. At first I wasn't sure what the texture was supposed to be, but then when I re-read recipe and it said, "cut into squares," I knew that mine that mine was seriously flawed. Costly mistake, my bad. The sauce was great, and easy.

My brother's girlfriend made this for the holidays! It is one of the best things I have ever eaten! ~And I haven't ever said that about a dessert with no chocolate! Even the people that don't like dates loved it! It was great leftover as coffeecake for a few days! I don't think I will make this more than once a year, because I could easily eat the whole thing!

This recipe is a holiday favorite. Like several other posters, I have to cook it an extra 15 minutes or so to get the middle done (and that's even with the water boiling when I add it to the pan). The results are well worth the effort.

Nothing tastes more like Christmas than this recipe. It is amazing. It is also very sweet, which is fine with me on a special occasion! Very decadent and a special dessert for the holidays.I tried it a couple years ago and had same problem as others with center not cooking through. Works much better in individual ramekins(it made 8 for me).

The pudding itself was a touch bland but it was saved by the wonderful sauce. Next time, I will try using more spice in the batter.

I was sooo disappointed in this recipe! So many rave reviews and the date pudding had zero flavor. When remade with dark brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves it seemed right, especially in contrast with the very sweet Toffee Sauce. Also baked it in small fluted silicone molds which made for an attractive presentation.

Important variation: Pour the batter into cupcake tins -- the disposable, stand-on-their-own liners made by Reynolds. This guarantees that the batter will cook all the way through. To serve, just remove the cupcake from the liner and invert it in the serving dish. The flat top and fluted sides make it look more like a gourmet serving and not a cupcake. Then pour the sauce over the top and top with whipped cream. I've made this recipe many times for my wife, and it always brings us back to our 25-anniversary trip to Scotland, where we discovered this delightful dessert. The cake never came out right, though, until I switched to the cupcake method. And it makes for a much better presentation, too.

Excellent, with two comments: 1) As with others, the baking took a fair bit longer than the recipe specified. 2) I might cut back on the ginger a wee bit--it didn't seem like a lot, but it still tasted almost like gingerbread, which was not what I was looking for here.

Rating: 4
It was delicious and so easy! It did seem very underdone when I took it out after the recommended time, but drenched in sauce, this seemed to make no difference. I think I might skip the water bath next time and then maybe it will come out more cake-like, which I would prefer.

made this recipe about a dozen times already, and its a HUGE hit, just as stated if you follow the directions. slight variation would be to add a large pinch of cardamom if you like. i like to saturate the cake with the toffee, serving both quite warm.

I'm an Australian (living in Sweden) and grew up on this divine dessert, but for me this recipe was an utter disaster. It didn't cook through even after an hour and a half and ended up mushy and awful. Thought I'd try this baked version for a change, but I really believe that the best sticky date puddings are steamed in a pudding basin. A waste of wonderful fresh dates, though I see that the recipe has worked for some, so perhaps it was my mistake...

AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING. This has to be one of the most delicious desserts. I have used this recipe and made the pudding about five times now. It is divine! I wouldn't change a thing! Everyone who tries it, is in love. Please try it now!!! You will be surprised pleasantly.

Rating: 4
Truly one of the best desert I've had and made in my life. Everybody couldn't stop raving about it. My Australian roommate said it was just as good as the Australian version of her childhood. I cooked it the recommended time and it was perfect. I believe that since it's a pudding it shouldn't be baked completely like a cake, otherwise it will loose its moisture and spongelike consistency. I recommend small portions, served in chunks, since it's very fulling. Enjoy!

AMAZING....I fell in love with sticky toffee pudding when I purchased some from the Sticky Toffee Pudding Company. The sauce from this recipe was almost an exact match in my opinion. Together, the cake and sauce were sublime. My husband loved it and Im sure I will make it every fall/winter.

truly a keeper. i've made it 4 times thusfar for parties, and definitely a hit (now beats my red velvet cake, creme brulees, etc). i'll reiterate what i've encountered each time and others have said: - very sweet (subjective) - too much toffee sauce (subjective) - needs to cook longer, about 10min. - use boiling water to start the bath

Rating: 4
As a native of Australia, I grew up eating this, and it was perfect. The only modifcations were to leave it in another 10 mintes as the middle was still a litle raw. Also, traditionally, poke holes with a toothpick all over the top of the cake, then pour about 3/4 cup (eyeball it) of the sauce all over the top, and let it soak in. Then, cut, serve and top with more sauce. This was amazing and a keeper

Oh my Gosh! This recipe is top notch. I was skeptical of the whole date thing but it came out amazing! My friends all raved about it (especially the sauce). I did cook it an extra 10 minutes, and it was perfect. A definite repeat at dinner parties.

Update: after overnight refrigeration, the sauce had a layer of fat on top. I salvaged the sauce by skimming off the top and microwaving the remainder for about 2 minutes on medium power, stirring every 30 seconds. Consistency was then perfect.

I made this for my boyfriend, who loves puddings and dates but not cake. Id first had it in the Blue Mountains of Australia and I thought hed enjoy it. It was indeed really amazing. I used 12 oz organic Medjool dates from the health food store (was easy to pit them), fresh ginger grated with the microplane, substituted OJ for water as another review suggested, and halved the sugar for the pudding. Also made the water bath using boiling water (just put a kettle on the boil while I mixed the pudding). With these modifications, it took 50 minutes to cook. I had trouble with the saucea layer of fat separated out, maybe because the heat was too high or I cooked it too long. Anyway, I used the bottom layer, which tasted divine. Upon tasting it my boyfriend went into some kind of silent, blissful ecstasy. He said it was the best thing hed tasted in years!! To my taste it was too sweet (even cutting out half the sugar), but offset by some intense Arabic coffee with cardamom it was perfect. Also delicious for breakfast this morning with greek yogurt! This makes 12 servings for me, or 5 servings for him.

OK - this recipe was delicious ONCE IT WAS FULLY COOKED. 35-40 minutes was definitely not enough time. I took it out of the oven after 40 minutes because the tester was "clean", but I didn't notice it wasn't dry. Big mistake. Anyway, after putting it back in the oven again for another 20 minutes or so, it came out GREAT! And the sauce is amazing. Used the leftovers to dip apples.

This is truly Exceptional! My husband and I had this for the first time at Dalvay by the Sea. We shared it and devoured it in silence. It was an out of body experience!! It has been my experience that it needs more cooking time than stated in the recipe. Keep an eye on it. Left over pudding is just as good with a cup of tea the next day. Your guests will think they have died and gone to heaven!

So incredible! Made this for my husband because he loves toffee, but typically isn't a cake person. We both devoured it! It HAS to be served with ice cream or topping because it's extremely rich. The accompanying bellyache was worth it, though!

Replaced the ginger with freshly grated nutmeg, and chopped the dated very coarsely. Have made the recipe as printed and prefer it with the nutmeg. Exceptional with the sauce and ice cream. Makes a lot of sauce, could probably 1/2 the recipe.

I made this recipe to rave reviews. I agree with the poster who suggested that the cooking water be boiling rather than just hot - I took that advice and baked for 45 minutes and the cake was perfectly done.

This is a WINNER. Yumz. Everyone raves about it (here in London and in the USA) and asks me to make for dinner parties. It turns out perfectly every time -- occasionally needs 10 more minutes in the oven, but other than that, follow the recipe!

I made the pudding last night as a trial as I have never made a pudding from scatch. It turned out fantastic. Did have to add about fifteen minutes more to the mixture but worth the wait my father inlaw could have eaten more.

I also use DOUBLE thick cream which is different to just thickened cream in the sauce as this makes the sauce thicker and for people who think the pudding and sauce is to sweet just add some double cream instead of icecream alongside it as this makes it not as sweet yum!

This recipe has really annoyed me GREATLY I have tried making it 4 times in the last week and it has only worked once after adding another 45 minutes to the cooking time and turned the heat down to 150.c . The other times it came out looking the same way it did when going in except for being cooked on the out side. So I divided the batter in to two cake tins and cooked them for the 1 hour each, it was a lot better but still needed a little more time. So now i have gone to the trouble of converting the measurements into metric and I will see what happens as there is a difference between them. If this dose not work I will then try taking the cake tin out of the bassin of water like one of the other writters said they did. I've also tried in other ovens, but the same thing accured. PS would be nice if conversion were AVAILABLE for us, as i have wasted alot of time and money. Yours truthfully WONT GIVE UP!

I live in Berlin, Germany where we have access to huge soft Turkish dates in kilo boxes. Those are the dates I use with perfect results. The sauce has become one of my favorites. I also serve it on an apple cake (also from Epicurious) that I make with dates instead of the raisins it calls for. I do lots of dinner parties and everyone loves both combinations!

I stumbled upon this scrumptious dish at Dalvay by the Sea where the waitress convinced me to order it (I don't even like dates!) It is now my secret weapon at all formal affairs. Very frustrating to bake at altitude, I pull the pudding out of the pan of water for the last 20 minutes. It doesn't seem to affect the texture. Mmmmm...

I made this for an English themed dinner party. It was amazing. As other reviewers have previously said the sauce is fantastic. I am making it again right now. I will say that the baking time is a few minutes longer than stated but it was not 'soup' after forty minutes. I think the problem other cooks have had with undercooking is due to the temperature of the water they put in their water bath. You must use BOILING water to fill the pan. Hot tap water won't due - it has to come up to temperature before it starts cooking the pudding.

I have not made this entire recipe yet but I have made the sauce and actually made a dense apple and walnut cake with the same results. The first time I experienced sticky toffee pudding was in a pub I worked at in Scotland and I fell absolutley in love with it. I would often find myself dreaming of it and then would fall to my knees helplessly in my desire for more Sticky Toffee Pudding...So, needless to say I nearly fainted with great anticipation when I first saw the recipe in Gourmet. And that was printed in 1998 and I am still crazy..(for it.) It is as close as we are going to get here stateside. Thanks.

I'm just a college student and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to pull of this recipe in my terrible dorm kitchen - but I've been craving pudding so bad I just had to try! And it turned out WONDERFULLY! All my roommates loved it, and they want me to make it again for an upcoming Pot Luck. I agree with what's been said before about adding an extra 15 minutes or so to the cooking time, but other than that, I highly recommend this recipe.

We loved this recipe. Dessert is not my strong point and I made this for the British Inlaws. They raved!!! We all raved!!! When I pulled up this recipe to make it again I realized that I had not made a comment last year and had to take the time to tell you TO MAKE IT! Make it exactly as the recipe calls for and you will not be disappointed it does need a little more baking time. I am making it for my own family this year and they are saying, pudding...... dates..... wait till they try it they will be begging me to make it again.

My family and friends loved this dish! I don't know why one wouldn't buy pitted dates (reference previous review) and simply chop them in the food processor. Anyway, theonly chane I made was to serve it with vanilla whipped cream and the sauce instead of ice cream. I'll make this again for our annual Christmas Party and am expecting rave reviews again.

Rating: 1
This recipe was a huge dissappointment!! I always read the reviews before making anything and since this was rated so highly, made it. I spent 20 minutes pitting and dicing the dates and followed the recipe exactly except that the dates sat in the water/soda mix longer than it said. I baked it for an hour and it was still a gooey, undercooked mess when I cut it for serving. I did notice that others had that problem also...anybody know why?? Fortunately, had the caramel sauce to put over ice cream to save the day and that was really good, although thin.

Rating: 4
Wow, this dish is FABULOUS!!! I had never made or eaten anything like it but was looking for a dessert recipe with dates and tried this based on its glowing reviews. This is a British-style pudding, so the texture is about like American banana bread. And the sauce is so good you could pour it over old shoes and eat them happily. However, I agree with those who found the cooking time too brief. I made this in individual souflee dishes and it was almost an hour before they tested done.

I haven't actually made this desert but I just returned from Dalvay by the Sea where I fell in love with it. I'm not sure what possessed me to order it as I'm not a fan of dates but after the first mouthful I was certainly glad I had. Unfortunately we were only there for one night so I couldn't try it again but the first thing I did on returning home was look up the recipe!

Rating: 4
I made this twice. The first time was transcendental. The second, good, but not AS. My recommendation is stick to individual ramekins. The problem with my second try is that I attempted to make on LARGER pudding for a big dinner party. It turned dry (hence less flavorful) on the exposed part, while staying soupy on the bottom. I had to trim the soft-cooked part off the cake before serving, and tried to hide the dryness with extra toffee sauce, which was a bad move because more than two tablespoons is overwhelming to the delicate flavor of the pudding. Still, even the FIASCO version was very delicious, bringing mostly grunts of pleasure from full-mouthed dinner guests.

I have made this several times - everyone loves it! I don't bake it in a water bath, though. When I tried baking in the water bath, it didn't cook. It comes out fine if you just bake it in the oven and watch it a little more carefully. The only time consuming part is pitting the dates, but you could just as easily buy pre-pitted dates.

This recipe is amazing. I've made it many times and always get rave reviews - "the best dessert I've ever tasted" from someone recently. I just made it again for Christmas but couldn't find dates so made it with dried figs. It certainly changed the taste of the pudding but it was still great. Whenever I make this and don't eat it all in one sitting (I defy any group of 6 to eat this whole thing!) I cut the left over into servings of 2 and freeze them. So easy to microwave for a minute to defrost and heat and serve just with icecream or with some honey (if you don't have/can't be bothered making more caramel sauce). Yummy!

The first time I tried this recipe it came out undercooked -- very disappointing. However, I tried it again (adding a full 15 minutes to the baking time) and it was delicious. The sauce is a bit thin -- try the Toffee Sauce recipe on this site (Bon Appetit May 1998) for a thicker consistency.

As a chef i used to make this on a regular basis. I never could see why the soda was put into the date/water mix because you are losing it's aerating properties so i add it to the flour. At the Ivy in London where i used to work we would cook them in foil cups (you could use ramekins/darioles) then cut the tops (bottoms) off so they would stand up well on the plate then cut into 3 horizontally. Then put some toffee sauce in the bottom of the "cups" then add the 3 slices adding sauce in between (think jam on bread!) and over the bottom. Cover with tin -foil and put in a hotplate/low oven 40 minutes before eating. Goes well with a spoon of creme fraiche.

I took the tip from another reader and used half orange juice/half water to cook the dates in. Also stole from yet another recipe and added 3T cognac to the sauce. (would have used Armagnac had I had any.....but you know how that goes) Absolutely DIVINE. I also poked some holes in the cake while it was warm and poured about a half cup of the sauce over and let it sink in. Definitely a keeper.

One mouthful, soft, delectable, the sauce runs down your throat like a gentle liquid stream, the sponge like pudding, simply disolves on one's tastebuds. Served with cold icecream, this pudding is beyond compare, one could easily gain a compulsive eating disorder with this pudding, its hard to stop eating it once begun. Your guests will be drooling at the mouth once you make mention that you are making this dish for desert. Once eaten, never forgotten, a tasteful memory to be savoured at ones leisure.
