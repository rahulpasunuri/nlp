Used a 2.5+lb pork loin and roasted for 1hr at 325 with perfect results. I also substituted the arugula with spinach. I added my own roasted garlic and fresh chives to plain goat+cream cheese. The best part of the whole dish is the sauce! You'll want to lick the plate.

I used a deer roast instead of veal (much cheaper!) and subbed chopped roasted green chiles for the bell peppers. I didn't have arugula (I did this last-minute and had to use what we had on hand) so I subbed frozen chopped spinach, defrosted and very well-squeezed out before placing on the roast. I also did not defile the goat cheese with cream cheese, but I did mix in some chopped pinon nuts - yummy! I seared it for less than 10 minutes in a 12-inch cast iron skillet and cooked at 375 for 40 minutes. It was a tad overcooked, but with all the goodies inside, and the wonderful sauce on top - it was just fine. Definitely a keeper - because you can break up the steps it doesn't have to take all day. Served it with plain, whole wheat penne to help soak up the buttery, lemony, totally-not-on-my-diet sauce. Will definitely make again.

This was one of the best dishes I had ever made for friends in '95. I plan to make it again this Holiday time ( now as a caterer and client wants something different) and was delighted to find the recipe on the site! I am thankful for the microwave suggestions for the basil and arugula- that was such a pain! This is a lot of work but it was such a terrific dish.

We made this receipe 10 years ago for a gourmet dinner group we are in, it was a huge hit then. But this time we made it for speical friends for a pre- Christmas dinner. It was wonderful again it will not be 10 years before I make this one again. A hint, to shorten up on time, I rinsed the basil and arugula and laid the leaves out on a plate and microwaved them 45 seconds on high. Also make the sauce a day before or two and the meat can be prepared the day before. We have had friends use a pork loin instead of the veal and said it came out quite good. But I would stick with the veal, if price is a issue make sure and ask your butcher how much it was pricey BUT WORTH every penny and time to make

I was craving some sort of suffed meat dish and came upon this in my search. I modified it for two people by using a beef tenderloin, just under 1 lb. I sliced it lengthwise to within 1/2 inch and pounded it out to about 1/2 inch even thickness. I rolled it from the short end and it tied up nicely. I seared it per the recipe (less than 10 minutes) in an oven proof skillet, then let cool for about 8 minutes before draping with 3 slices of bacon. I roasted it at 375 for about 18 minutes for a perfect medium rare. It was fabulous. I'd love to try this with a larger tenderloin for company. I served it with creamy fontina polenta (from this site) and a mixed green salad with balsamic vinaigrette.

I made some changes cause I dont eat veal and didnt want the basil twist--I used a lean beef cut, shoulder london broil, which I thought would be tough but something about this recipe made it wonderfully tender. Butterflied it and rolled it but only to close, not to layer cause I forgot to pound it thin. Anyhow, I used a jar of roasted red peppers, and instead of basil used thyme. Also added chopped sundried tomatoes and a little white pepper. Skipped the cream cheese as I am restricting fat and the beef and goat cheese were plenty. Did the foil ends thing (great idea) and tied it up. Braised it then roasted it at 450 for about 25 minutes. OMG it was delicious, truly satisfying.

This recipe was wonderful and I was worried about seasoning until I realized the flavor of the cream cheese with the goat cheese would season the loin wonderfully. Its great for a dinner party, holiday, or an event where you want to show off your cooking skills but not kill yourself making the meal.

Great flavor combination. Would be great for a dinner party, just make sure guests like the taste of goat cheese, because it dominates.

This was delicious and easy to prepare. I had one guest who didn't eat veal so I used the same stuffing for a chicken breast which was equally good. Next time I think I will try all chicken breasts because the veal was very expensive.

what type of side dishes would you serve with this? it seems pretty rich so i'm guessing something simple/not rich to complement it might be good. any ideas from those who have made this before? thanks so much. i'm making this weekend

I've made this recipe several times and found it easier this last time. Maybe because I blanched the basil and arugula just 2 seconds so they didn't wilt as much. Anyway, like the other reviewers, I think this dish is superb. My butcher gave me the ribs and said to lay the stuffed roll on top of the ribs when roasting it. I did, and it really added wonderful flavor to an already excellent dish. You must serve to special people due to the expense of the veal, but it's well worth it!

I made this recipe for our gourmet super club, and it was a huge success. The tastes were incredible. I did not feel it was too terribly time consuming. I followed the recipe exactly and enjoyed every bite.

This recipe is so amazing. I've made it at least 6 times or so and the only problem is it calls for a veal loin in the title and a veal rib roast boned in the text. The veal loin is what was in the original picture because it's so easy to work with but very tough. The right cut of meat is the veal rib which is to say the prime rib of veal. I made it just like the recipe says except I substituted boursin cheese for the goat (wish I liked goat cheese)and I prefer orange to yellow bell peppers. Six years later I still have people asking if I'm making it again during the holidays! Meat must be ordered a week in advance and must be assembled the day before and tied into a log. Could seriously be made if $$ and labor in advance were not a problem for 100 people. Sauce has nothing to do with cooking the entree so it can be made completely in advance. You go to sleep knowing your entree is almost finished. Very beautiful presentation.

Wow, I guess I am the odd-woman out. I made it exactly as stated, with the exception of using pancetta instead of bacon. We were just not that impressed, given the time & expense of the dish. We both thought it was way too rich...the cheese and the buttery sauce overpowered the veal. It was not bad, just not great. Anyway, just my opinion. Most of the other folks loved it. Note: The hearty veal stew w/ red peppers and capers recently added to this website is wonderful!!

All the reviews are absolutely right. This is a lot of work but gives fabulous results. A delicious and attractive dish.

I've made this before from the Bon Appetite magazine. I've recently moved cross country and misplaced one of the boxes of saved Bon Appetite magazines, and this issue was among them. I'm so glad I found this on epicurious.com. It's is truly a great dish, especially for entertaining.

We made this for our gourmet dinner club and it was a hit. It was easy and I did most of the prep a day ahead. My only complaint is the expense. I also used a pork tender loin but the veal was far superior.

I have, as caterer for the day, had two men's cooking clubs prepare this from scratch with the greatest successes and kudos. A wonderful do it together dinner, served w/ sweet potatoe and carrot puree & sliced fresh tomatoes vinagrete !!

I have made this many times since first seeing it in the magazine, and it is always a big hit. I usually serve it with a creamy polenta. One guest I consider to have a "sophisticated palate" once said he thought it was the best meal he had ever had!

This is a lot of work but wonderful for a dinner party. Give yourself plenty of time, but it's worth it.

A bit of work, but a really great dish. Be sure the butcher knows you are rolling the veal, or it may come pounded too thin. (The veal is expensive, but worth it.) Impressive presentation when it's sliced.
