Haved made this every Christmas since 2001. My husband loves it and so do the dogs, I get a 3 rib roast and they get their own Christmas dinner!! Turns out perfect every year, I use a digital probe thermometer to insure perfect doneness.

Great meal for holidays. Guests rated as another 5 star recipe, with many raves over the veggies. Substituted pomegranate jelly for red currant and powdered beef stock for demi glace which my local store did not have. Saved to my recipe box for another special occasion.

This was fabulous - the whole family loved the gravy, which I doubled. Went great with the prime rib and yorkshire pudding. Would definitely make again.

My butcher told me to get the internal meat temperature up to 140° for medium rare and I'm glad I didn't listen to him. The 115° temp. climbing to 120° is perfect. I finally had a chance to use the demiglace I laboriously made a few months ago; diluted as others have suggested. A close friend of mine invited me to his vacation house at Lake Almanore and wanted me to make one of the meals. Even though this is a cold weather meal, it worked famously. I'd make it again in a heartbeat.

I doubled the volumes for gravy and sliced the mushrooms thin to keep with the gravy. I did not bother serving the vegetables. Gravy was very nice with the Yorkshire puddings!

This was a great variation to a traditional roast beef dinner. I might make a more standard gravy next time because this one makes for a different gravy taste, but for those who've had a lot of traditional gravy, this as I said will make a nice variation with different flavors. For those who mentioned the recipe calling for too much demiglace, I wonder if they were assuming 1 cup of demiglace meant one cup of demiglace paste. My demiglace said to add 4 parts water to one part demiglace. When I did that it wasn't too salty.

This has become my family's first choice for Christmas dinner. The surprise ingredient is the celery. Slice it not too thinly, on the diagonal. It is simply delicious. I use frozen pearl onions. They taste good and they save much time because they don't require peeling. Also: the recipe is ambigious in calling for 1 cup of demiglace. If one used that much, the sauce would be way too intense and salty. Most demiglace concentrate calls for diluting with hot water--several tablespoons of concentrate to one cup of water. That is what I use for this recipe and it's perfect. Don't skip the Yorkshire puddings. They are actually very easy to make, especially if you remember to heat the pan with the cooking fat in it first. You will get lots of points for courage, because this is one of those dishes that depends on something rising in the oven just before serving, like a souffle. These then collapse, of course, but they are beautiful and taste wonderful. By the way, I use a large non-stick muffin tin rather than the odd sized pans the recipe calls for.

Made this last night as part of an experimental dinner. The roast came out great. I used a ribeye instead of a standing rib. However, I did not love the gravy. I thought the amount of demiglaze made it too salty. Next time, I would start reducing twice the merlot earlier then add to the drippings once the roast was out. Then cut the demiglaze. Lastly I gave it 3 forks out of personal preference, everyone I served would give it a 4.

The gravy in this had me a little confused. I looked up demi-glace in the dictionary and it said brown sauce- I looked up brown sauce and it said demi-glace. I finally found a recipe for 'brown sauce' and it was espagnole sauce. (on this site) I started this recipe at 11 in the morning and we ate at 6 in the evening. I made the yorkshire puddings and followed the recipe exactly. I had never eaten YP before and this was not what I expected them to be. My husband being half english however loved it. I also was not sure of the taste of the gravy (a bit too canned beef broth maybe?) I would probably do the beef again but I'm not too sure of the merlot veggie gravy.

So,so good. I serve this for New Years Eve to rave reviews. This year I also parlayed it into a great breakfast: savory crepes from the leftover pudding batter thinned with brandy and water, stuffed with cheese (leftover brie) and topped with reduced merlot gravy. (Plus some sweetened ones dolled up with desert sauce leftovers.) YUM! Twice! (Diet later!)

Excellent, Excellent, Excellent. My roast although wonderful, didn't give me any pan juices to speak of, just fat for the puddings. Next time I would make up the gravy and vegetables ahead of time, and heat them at the last minute. I prefer being with my company over being in the kitchen. I might double the gravy next time too. It was extraordinary. I was doubtful of the vegetables in the gravy, but now I wouldn't do it any other way.

What a foolproof, delicious and easy recipe! The prime rib came out perfect, the gravy benefitted from a bit more horseradish but was delicious, and the Yorkshire puddings, what's not to like? I don't make prime rib often, but when I do, this is the recipe.

My husband said it was the best roast he's ever had. The sauce was just wonderful. There was a lot left over. Yorkshire pudding came out great. I want to make this for company next time.

I made this with a 3.5# rib roast, that I dry-aged(Cook's magazine, Nov-Dec 2003) for 4 days. Done at 30 minutes per pound, with temps, times and rest as recipe, created crisp exterior and perfect pink throughout. This was the best prime rib I've ever had. Also the gravy was exceptional.

This was sooo easy and sooo impressive! I served this with a Hartford Zinfandel, 1999 & 2001 - great pairing! A word of caution for those guests who want the meat more done than the chef prefers, or as directed in this recipe. Let the roast cook up to about 120 degrees instead of 115 and still let stand to over 125. This way you will have a less rare piece of meat. I love it rare but I had guests who did not! Also, i took the advice of another reveiwer, i used zinfandel for the gravy - excellent! thanks for the tip.

As instructed, I used a cup of demiglace (purchased from WS) and the sauce was way too salty for my taste. I would make it again, but will use only 1/2 cup of demiglace.

Made this for Christmas dinner was a huge hit with everyone. Added in some Morel mushrooms which worked well with the over all effect.

Well my friends I made this last night for dinner and it was so good and my husband loved it.I reduced the amount of demiglace by half(I felt a cup would be to salty) and used 1cup of beef broth. My husband bowed down to me after his second plate.(lol)The only reason I didn't give this 4forks is because the puddings were a bit bland next time I think I'll try the herbed yorkshire pudding, and I also think I used too much fat. I was so worried about the horseradich but oh my just the right amount of zing for the auce.

Great roast. Sweet and tart gravy was wonderful. I would have preferred a fruity Zin or a Cabernet to a Merlot as the base. Next time, more horseradish and fresh ground at that.

As I had never made Roast Beef before, I was a little apprenhensive...But this makes a brilliant meal that looks like much more work than it is. We loved it!
