To make this festive looking, I sometimes thinly slice 2 or 3 mini red or orange sweet peppers and soften for a couple of minutes in the hot oil before adding bok choy.

I make baby bok choy quite often...different variations of this recipe. This is one of the quickest of the recipes and it turned out to be just as delicious. The butter gives it a wonderful richness, but you can use less if you like. Before adding any salt, check to see if you need it, as the soy sauce and oyster sauce add a lot of saltiness. Warning: I made about 6 small bunches of the bok choy, doubled the sauce and my husband and I ate almost the whole thing! So make more than you think...it shrinks!

Had never had bok choy except in chinese dishes ( out or take out) I am now a Weight Watcher and was looking for different vegetables. This was absolutely delicious. Didn't have oyster sauce on hand so I used bean sauce, eliminated the butter, it wasn't necessary and the second time tried a smidge of cornstarch to slightly thicken the sauce. Great dish and I served it with fish.

My husband and our 2 1/2 year old son liked this. I'm always looking for new vegetable recipes. I will make this again.

Simple, satisfying. Except for the butter (an entire tablespoon?!) it's just as my dad would make it.

Besides adding a few cloves of crushed garlic, I also added a teaspoon or so of crushed ginger. I did not use the butter (we eat kosher-style and were having chicken for our main course) and substituted black bean sauce for the oyster sauce. My 11 year old couldn't get enough of it! The rest of the family really liked it, too. I'm definitely making it again.

I love bok choy. Simple recipe and yummy. Enjoyed this with Grilled halibut with lemon-basil vinaigrette.

My family loves Asian food and I made this exactly as written and to our palates it was tasteless. I was wondering how so little seasoning was going to dress up a head of bok choy and in our opinion it did not.

This recipe is so easy to make, and the oyster sauce gives it a wonderful taste, much better than just soy sauce alone.

Simple,quick and delicious. I substituted hoisin sauce for the oyster sauce and it tasted great!! Takes about 10 mins from start to finish.

A very quick and tasty recipe for a vegetable I would otherwise overlook. Would make a good accompaniment to any Asian meal that's just a bit short. My two-year-old liked munching on the stems!

It tasted like vegemite and bok choy. I don't know what I did but it didn't taste very nice to me. Sauce was too overpowering.

This recipe tastes great. I also improvised by adding several cloves of garlic. It has a wonderful taste and would indeed work well with other greens. Quick and simple. This is a keeper.

This is an excellent basic recipe for any type of greens. I added one clove crushed garlic and I have substituted Kale for the Bok Choy. Everyone I have served (with the exception of my 8-year old son, and I think that it's just a matter of time for him)loves this dish. It's a great way to get my family to eat greens.

This was so easy to make and quite delicious as well. It took just under ten minutes for everything. I used a garlic based stir fry sauce instead of the oyster sauce and it turned out fantastic!

Very simple, but has a nice flavor. The bok choy cooks down remarkably fast, so it is best to have the sauce prepared ahead of time and ready on hand when you stir-fry the vegetables. It went wonderfully with plain steamed rice, would definitely make again.

Excellent flavor, and very easy. Just get everything measured in advance, and this is a very fast side dish. I used white rice moulded in a round and put the bok choy in the middle. It was delicious. Will make again.
