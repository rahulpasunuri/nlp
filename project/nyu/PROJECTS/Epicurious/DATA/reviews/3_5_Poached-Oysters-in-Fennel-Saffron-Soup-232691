Loved it! Used 1/2 clam juice and 1/2 shrimp broth (from frozen shrimp shells). We both deemed it company worthy. No problems with the fennel puree - but I blended it for quite a while.

I had such high hopes for this recipe but it was a major disappointment. Even though I strained the fennel puree, it still gave the soup a grainy texture and the flavors just didn't work in my opinion.

This is an elegant soup. I used jarred Northwestern oysters and garnished the soup bowls with the fennel fronds- so pretty!

This was fabulous with fresh oysters right off the beach. I used vege broth instead of clam juice. Very tasty.

Delicious soup - barely cooked oysters made the dish. Make this soup!

This was outstanding!! I followed the recipe exactly, and used select oysters in the jar from Whole Foods. I strained the oysters and used some of the liquid, about 1/2 cup, avoiding the bottom of the bowl as that is where all the sand settled. I will use a cheesecloth, as suggested, next time. I used Sambuca as the anise flavoring, and if you don't like too much anise, go lighter than 3 TB. It is a very easy recipe-- it did not need to strain the fennel. Just make sure you cook until very tender and puree. This is really worth it!!

Great recipe ! One suggestion, to make the soup creamier (less strings from the fennel), I put the fennel purée through a strainer.

To answer the questions- Yes, the liquor means the juices, and If you cook the oysters past the "edges just beginning to ruffle" stage, theywill shrink to the size of peas and get tough.

This is an unusual flavored soup, but my quest thoroughly enjoyed it and encourage me to make it again.

This sounds delicious, but are the oysters not cooked? Or is "warming them through at the end" sufficient?

Sounds like a dish beyond compare! My suggestion would be that if you are using pre-shucked oysters from the market to add the juice last, making sure you don't add too much. Also whether using fresh or market bought oysters strain the juice through a cheese cloth to catch any little particles of shell or grit.

The liquier of the oysters is the juices from the shell. I wish I lived closer to the ocean in order to make this properly.

I used to work at Lilette years ago and the food there was always superb...I haven't made this yet, but I am looking forward to making it. However, I am wondering what the deal is with adding the oysters 'with their liqueur'; what does that mean? Their juices?
