Let's not flag the recipe as a 1 star not very good if we didn't make the recipe. The recipe is for a Kurobuta pork chop, not a regular pork chop, and with the spices called for not with what someone decided to substitute. Glad to know that you were inventive but you shouldn't judge the recipe unless you actually followed the recipe. And, yes there is Kurobuta pork in Rochester.

Also did regular chops, and used cayenne instead of aleppo. Very yummy! Definitely salty, though. I had pretty thick chops, and 10 min @ 400 did the trick.

This was easy to make and very delicious. I skipped the relish and served it with rapini.

I love this recipe! I cook it at least once every two months. It is quite spicy so be prepared. The aleppo pepper was a bit hard to find. I had to travel to a specialty store, but the trip was well worth it.

I found Aleppo pepper at Dean and Deluca (online) as well as a local Lebanese grocery store. A 10-12oz chop per person is a lot of meat. I had my butcher cut 8oz loin chops instead. After pan-searing, bake at 425 F for just 5-7 minutes to get 145 degrees. Be careful not to overcook! It's easy!

Excellent. I made some pepper substitutions using: fresh ground pepper. white pepper and of course Hungarian sweet paprika. Instead of sage, I used onion powder. It could use less salt for the rub.

I couldn't find Aleppo pepper, so used 1.5 t cayenne and 1.5 t sumac. This dish tasted great! Everyone we served it to loved it. One comment, I couldn't find any information on what temperature to bake the chops at. I did 375.

We really didn't like this: the cardamom was overpowering, and the braising made the bacon mushy. The pork chops were good, but on a little spicy on their own. We also used regular pork chops.

Made for Christmas Eve dinner. Absolutely delicious. Made it with regular chops however, no kurobuta here! Amazing.
