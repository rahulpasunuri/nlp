I made a half batch of these guys for a cocktail party with 20 people and I should have made those whole 110 meatballs! I made them earlier in the day, removed from sauce, and kept them covered in the oven for about an hour and a half before people came over. They did not dry out the least bit. I found doubling the egg amount to keep the meatballs to stay together really well. I reduced the liquidy tomato sauce and poured it over before serving. I'm going to make a double recipe next and freeze them. Way too good.

I was very pleased with the meatballs. I baked them at 350 for 30 minutes in a glass baking dish, as someone suggested. They were very tender and flavorful.... Probably because of the milk (I used whole milk) and the combination of beef and pork.

My recipe varies a little; I add italian sausage, fresh oregano... different each time. BUT, to save time and mess, I bake the meatballs in a little olive oil in my giant iron skillet (cassarole dish will do), @ 350 for about 30 min. I also use the food processor to mix onion, garlic, bell pepper, herbs, spices and a couple of raw eggs... mix THAT with meat and dry bread crumbs. The oil in the sausage keeps it moist enough, so I don't soak the bread.

Here's my recipe for authentic Italian meatballs: Ingredients 2 lbs. chopped beef (I get 93% lean) 1/2 loaf stale italian bread soaked in water until sponge-like 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese 2 eggs 1/2 cup pignoli (pine) nuts (optional) 1 T garlic powder 1 T ground nutmeg 1/4 cup chopped italian (flat leaf) parsley seasoned bread crumbs (we use 4C) salt/black pepper to taste (put more black pepper than you would normally!) Mix all ingredients (EXCEPT bread crumbs)very well in a bowl. Form the meatballs to about the size of a golf ball and coat them well with the seasoned bread crumbs. Fry them in about 3/4 inch of olive oil. Fry until golden brown all around (about 2-3 minutes). Drain on paper towel and enjoy!

Yes, these are time consuming but worth it. I thought they were excellent. I did add a little dried basil to the sauce.They were a great with the baked ziti as suggusted in the magazine.

The meatballs were great, but the sauce had no taste. The second time I made it I used chile sauce, grape jelly, and a little lemon juice. It's wonderful!! *Note* One batch of these meatballs does not serve 8-10 people. It serves more like 25.

While time-consuming, the flavor was wonderful, and a real crowd pleaser! I made it with the complementary casserole

Mom and Dad loved it. I only used ground beef since we needed to use some up and I always make my own sauce. Next time I'll use some crushed red pepper to spice it up and dried minced onion to make prep a little easier.

Excellent recipe that works everytime. On a buffet, for meatballs sandwiches, or over spagetti, it can't be beat. Follow the recipe exactly and use the best quality ingredients. Ground round is moist and flavorful, if the cook in LA thought this recipe was bland he must have used ground chuck.

To the cook from Staten Island--I'm very curious to try your meatball recipe! I no longer see it on the site, though. Could you post it again or email it to me? My boyfriend always talks about his grandmother's "authentic Italian" food, so I'm looking for new recipes to share with him!

I usually make these meatballs for a group of people and substitute venison instead of beef. I have only received overwhelming compliments on them. They are delicious!!!

I could tell by the lack of ingredients that the meatballs weren't going to be that flavorful, which they weren't. And I added a little oregano to the meatballs on my own but they were still rather ordinary.

The meatballs were too dense, not very flavorful. I have found much better recipes since.

I substituted ground veal for the ground pork. My family loved them!

Meatballs were super moist and delicious. Used my own recipe for spaghetti sauce to simmer the meatballs in though.

These meatballs were very moist and delicious. We served it with the Baked Ziti with Mushrooms, Peppers and Parmesan and it was most definitely a hit. The meatballs were even better left over the next day.
