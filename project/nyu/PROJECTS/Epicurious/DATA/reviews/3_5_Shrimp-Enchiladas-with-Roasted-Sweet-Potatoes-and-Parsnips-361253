The dish was good. I read the other reviews first and made some adjustments- parsnips, sour cream etc. Overall it was an okay dish but I probably wouldn't rush to make it again.

I had high hopes after reading the reviews... this was disappointing at best. The shining star was the salsa which I will make again for other dishes. The root veggies didn't pair well, in my opinion, with the light sauce, cheese and shrimp. I may attempt again using chicken and perhaps caramelized onions...

Due to availability of ingredients, I had to make some small changes - used combo of onion/shallot for red onion. Didn't have the can of green chilies (it was fine without it), didn't have green onions (used a shallot). I added a can of black beans to the filling (pureed half, kept half with the chopped shrimp for texture - worked great!). I didn't have crema mexicana (only sour cream), so I skipped the crema in the sauce and drizzled as it would have curdled. Served the end product with sour cream on the side. Also, I used flour tortillas, so I skipped the frying step. I used feta as well. So yes, I made a lot of small changes, but I think it stayed true to the idea and flavour of the original. THought the whole thing was fantastic. YUMMY.

One other thing - I did take the other reviewers suggestion to cut the parsnips in half. I agree - it would have been way too much!

What a different way to eat enchiladas! I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I definitely was sweet - My husband liked it but added Cholula hot sauce:/ I would make this again but add more onions and season with chili powder on the vegetables for my husband.

I gave 3 out of 4 because after reviewing other people's comments I reduced the amount of parsnips and the dish came out perfectly. I used an equal amount of parsnips and sweet potatoes. I loved the sweet with the heat. However, I can see how more parsnips would have been a bit overpowering.

The 1 lb. of parsnips in this recipe overwhelmed all of the other flavors. The parsnips were too sweet to be eaten with the salsa verde sauce. I think would have like this recipe had the parsnips been replaced by black beans. Also, it took about 2 hours for 2 people to make this.

Loved this recipe (as did the hubby). I am pretty new at cooking so getting out the food processor can be intimidating! I substituted the shrimp for seasoned Mahi from Trader Joes. Still delicious! ANd even with the food processor, it was not too hard to make.

Very, very good! If you have the time the cooking is not difficult and it is an intersting receipe. Like others I did not toast the cumin seeds. I used ground cumin. Also, I used extra shrimp, about a pound. It took two hours to make because I made my own salsa verde. Otherwise, I think it would have taken an hour and half. IMHO, homemade salsa verde tastes way better than the canned stuff. There are many recipes out there. The one that follows I have found to be the best because it is tasty and easy. It is from a friend who grew up in Jalicso, and follows for anyone that cares: For approx. three cups of salsa verde you need: 2 lbs. tomatillos; 3/4 c white onion; 3/4 plus cup cilantro leaves; 1 juice of 1 lime; 1/2 t sugar and 2 Jalapeno peppers seeded (I retain some seeds because I like it spicy). (These measurments are all approximate. Sometimes I add more cilantro or onion or whatever just because). Rince tomatillos well, cut in half. Place cut side down on a aluminum foil- lined baking sheet. Broil until the skin is lightly-medium blackened. Spoon broiled tomatillos into blender with the rest of the ingredients. Blend to desired consistency. Muy saborosa!

Delicious. Not really any more work than my usual enchilada recipe. Very fresh take.

I thought this was great. Roasted the vegetables the night before. Also made the green sauce the night before, as well. Used precooked prawns, to save time. Didn't oil fry the tortillas, just sprayed pan w/olive oil. Also, didn't have cumin seed, so just used powder. Was truly delightful. Served it with chopped Mexican salad from this website.

I had high hopes for this. Followed recipe exactly and served it to 6 friends. We agreed that it was just too sweet and perhaps black beans in place of parsnips would balance it out, but won't be making it again.

The sweetness of the roasted veggies with the shrimp was wonderful -- the sauce added just the right amount of spicy heat. I mistakenly used Cotija cheese instead of the queso fresco but I don't think it affected the overall flavor of the enchiladas. Prep work took a little bit of time, but most of the steps (roasting the veggies, cooking the shrimp, making the salsa) can be made a couple of hours in advance, including the actual assembly of the enchiladas themselves. Definitely will make these again.

Fabulous, unexpected dinner. Made as the recipe, except I increased the shrimp. For my portion, I added hominy instead of shrimp. Served with black beans and grilled chiles of all kinds. Started with a salad of romaine, grilled corn from the cob, tomatoes marinated with lime juice, salt and pepper, jicama and a creamy cilantro vinagrette. YUM THIS IS A KEEPER

Wow. Quite unexpected combo. Delicious. Seasonal Fall and Mexican together. I did forgo the parsnips but the recipe turned out just as well. Also I roasted the cumin seeds but did not grind them. I'll be making this again for sure!

This is a wonderful recipe. All of the flavors come together so well. I used 1# yams and the 1# parsnips, plus 12 oz. shrimp which I roasted with olive oil, salt and pepper at 400 for 5-6 min.

Great recipe though it made a lot more than what the recipe said, which was great because now I have leftovers. It took about 2hrs total but was really worth it.

Good recipe, a great way to tie simple mexican food into a fall oriented dish. I will definitely will do this again for another casual dinner. I was short on time so I didn't bother w/ the toasted cumin seeds and used sour cream instead of crema mexicana. I enjoyed the dish, very flavorful and it's surprisingly filling. Roasted corn may be a good addition to to the veggies after they have been blended.

This was an exceptional recipe. I made it as written except I reduced the calories by using La Tortilla garlic & herb tortillas (50 calories each), didn't fry the tortillas, only used 1 tablespoon of oil on the parsnips & sweet potatoes, used much less cheese and none of the oil in the sauce. Next time I will omit the parsnips & use all sweet potatoes instead. If you aren't a fan of shrimp this dish would work with chicken as well.

This was delicious. I doubled the shrimp and added a can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce instead of the can of chiles. My family loved it.

This dish had the perfect amount of heat, and the root veggies were surprisingly fantastic with the shrimp. Do seek out the queso fresco (it is in many supermarkets) as it was one of the most delicious parts of the dish.

This was excellent - but incredibly time consuming. I made it exactly as written except I couldn't find parsnips, so I added extra sweet potatoes. I will definitely make it again and probably add more shrimp. Delicious!

Wonderful and special! Made the recipe as directed. Not too spicy, flavorful, and healthy!
