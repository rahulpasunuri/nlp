I've made these several times and learned many of the good tips given here. Not overdoing with the puree is very important. Rather than leave a 1/2-inch border around the edge of the rounds (I sometimes do squares instead) when spreading on the puree, I leave almost an inch and then fold the edge just slightly up around the slices of tomatoes. It might be tempting to sprinkle with some Parm-Reg or something, but I'm glad I don't, so the intensely good tomato flavor can be appreciated. Also, sometimes I use all the garlic in the puree, and just before serving sprinkle the tartlets with chopped basil and drizzle with olive oil.

Quick note - these do not work well made in advance. Great right out of the oven or served shortly afterward, but I made early-afternoon for an evening party and they were soggy despite re-warming.

I have made this several times now and have never been disappointed. I've also varied the ingred when the mood strikes. Yellow toms with whole basil leaves, or I've checkerboarded red/yellow. I've also added goat cheese and black olives. I find it faster to roll our dough into rectangles. (2 per pkg) Use a pizza cutter to cut into strips or squares after cooked. A definate favorite in our house!

I sprayed cooking oil on the cookie sheet as suggested, but it was probably unnecessary and the bottoms burned after 13 minutes, so I probably won't do that again. I, too, used canned tomatoes in the puree (2 large cans equivalent)--worked just fine. The February 2002 rating from Mass. might have been better if the tomatoes were in season!!

Good, but nothing special. Once the sauce is ready, preparation is easy. I had no problem with puff pastry sticking. Don't use too mcuh sauce or pastry will be soggy.

The smell of the tomato puree simmering got everyone fired up about eating the final product. With five minutes of cooking time remaining, I added a dab of freshly grated parmesan to the top. Everyone loved this dish.

This was a hit at my dinner party - I made the tomato puree about 4 hrs ahead, cut the pastry into 3 inch rounds and baked for 15 min or so. I might use basil next time but they disppeared and I was happy!

Good recipe - well received. Would also agree with those who have tried to cut tartlets into smaller rectangles for a larger quantity. Strongly recommend cooking through the olive oil-basil-garlic mixture, so that the flavors of basil and garlic can permeate the oil before being drizzled on top of the tartlets. Also, remember to grease your pan / cooking sheet / foil before baking the tartlets because the pastry dough sticks! (Learned the hard way :-) ) Have to serve this hot for this recipe to work well, but the tomato puree can be made a bit in advance.

I was making small canapes for a cocktail party and needed to puree the sauce so that the onions and tomatoes would not be too large for the 1x1 inch squares of puff pastry. I garnished with marinated sun dried tomatoes instead of sliced plum tomatoes and the intensity of the flavor added to the canapes. These were the type of canape that you could not stop eating. Deceivingly simple!

Iwould only use the three inch cookie cutters. All of my guests raved about this one/

Very good. I used 3 inch biscuit cutters to make smaller ones that seem better sized for appetizers - better to use roma tomatoes in that case to have smaller slices. The 2 pastry sheets made 18 tartlets with no need to roll out, as was already the desired thickness. Found it took more like 45 minutes to simmer down the chopped tomato mixture to 1.5 cups. To save time, I used canned whole tomatoes in lieu of chopping fresh ones and left the seeds in. Also the baking sheet should be lightly oiled to reduce sticking. This recipe is even easier than it looks.

I was a bit zealous with the rosemary and garlic and my guests raved ... although I thought it was a bit rich. Definite do-over.

Very easy. I added some additonal garlic and spice to liven it a bit. Visually this can't be beaten - very impressive. It's nice to find a new, good tasting, good looking vegetable recipe.

I really wanted to give this 2.5 forks because I liked it a lot, but 'delicious' is a bit of a stretch. This is an easy, quick and very fresh (with the fresh tomatoes and herbs) tasting appetizer option. It was gobbled up quickly.
