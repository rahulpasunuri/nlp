This was yummy. I added a cored and sliced Thai chili to the sauce to give the sauce some real spice. However, I want to point out that a skillet with butter might not be the best way to cook a veal chops. Olive oil might be better since it takes a while to cook and butter just turned brown. Also, this recipe as written doesn't produce very much sauce. If you add it up there's only 2/3 of a cup liquid called for and you're supposed to reduce it by half so that's only a 1/3 cup of sauce. I'd recommend doubling the sauce if you really want a decent amount to eat with your rice.

I thought this was nasty. The meat turned out leathery, and the sauce was nothing special. Also it was too greasy

O, m'gosh! Sauce is to die for. Would be great for any meat. Maybe, even pasta. Like another reviewer, I used wine instead of apple juice. They're both fruit drinks right!!

I followed the recipe exactly as stated, and it was one of the worst dishes I've ever prepared. The meat was flavourless, the sauce was much too greasy (the leftovers solidified in my fridge), and the overall taste and appearance of this dish were pretty amateurish (a lump of flavourless meat swimming in a flavourless liquid).

Wow! This is definately a keeper. The sauce is excellent, better than I have had in most restaurants...and I entertain for business and have been to some great restaurants all over the country. I did use homemade chicken stock and added some coconut milk to give the sauce a little kick.

I have to concur with everyone else - this was wonderful! Easy to make too! I used a veal shoulder steak. Didn't have apple juice - used sparkling apple cider. Also used 2 lg shallots finely chopped instead of onion. I certainly would make this again. My husband loved it. We were both savoring every bite.

I used chicken instead and it turned out great! The sauce is something that would work with tofu or lamb. Highly recommended.

Great sauce! This recipe is very easy and quick. My chops were 1 inch thick, so I did cook longer than recommended. I doubled the sauce, we love a curry sauce in this house!

Tasty and easy to make. My veal chops were very thick so I had to cook them about 7 minutes per side. Sauce is delicious and the apple juice is necessary though doesn't taste "apple juicy".

Great, easy recipe. Cooked 5min/side instead and was just perfect. Served with saffron rice mixed with dried cranberries and french green beans. Elegant and from start to finish took 15 minutes!!
