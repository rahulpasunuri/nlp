Outstanding! Everyone wanted the recipe. There were 12 for dinner,so I made 1.5x recipe and used a 9 x 12 pan. I also froze it after adding the icing to the frozen dessert. It sat in the refrigerator (from the freezer) for about 1.5 hours while we had dinner. My only concern was the meringue as it didn't seem dry enough after baking when I peeled the parchment paper off. The meringue seemed to lift off the frozen curd as I peeled back the plastic wrap to take it out of the pan, so I sprinkled graham cracker crumbs on the top, after removing the plastic wrap from the top. I then placed a layer of parchment paper on top and turned it out on to a cookie sheet and then removed the remaining plastic wrap and frosted it. I was concerned that the somewhat soft meringue top (now the bottom) would stick to whatever I used for a serving plate. The graham cracker crumbs saved the day.I think the meringue was not completely baked because my cookie sheets are "air-bake" ones. I should have let it bake longer. Still turned out fantastic. Couldn't taste the Triple Sec I used in the whipped cream icing. Might try using lemonade concentrate next time (or lemoncello) in place of the Triple Sec.

This is a fabulous summer dessert, everyone raved about it and it is so easy. You have to love a make- ahead that is this good.

This is a wonderful cake. Super yummy lemon flavor. I put it in the freezer after adding frosting and served frozen. It was great that way. Very refreshing.

This was a great cake and not as difficult to make as it sounds. It held up even though it sat in the fridge for well over the 1.5 hours noted in the receipe.
