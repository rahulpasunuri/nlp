I made this many years ago when it first appeared in the magazine and have made it several times since, and I still think it's an elegant, easy appetizer. I've done it with black and red lumpfish for Valentine's Day too!

This is not only simple, but it's fabulous, too. I served it with a nice bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, and I used the creme fraiche.
