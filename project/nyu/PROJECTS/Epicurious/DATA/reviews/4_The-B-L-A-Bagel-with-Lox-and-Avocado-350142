These look awesome! I'm huge on breakfast sandwiches, and especially with avocado on them! It's a better flavor than butter and super healthy...plus it keeps you full all day :)

A fantastic snack/light dinner! I also halved the bagel in two to make it easier to eat. It is colorful, tasty, fulfilling and simple to make. I made the following variations: 1. used citrus & basil smoked salmon, added a leaf of lettuce on each half of the bagel and omitted the red onion slice as I felt it would clash with the distinct taste of the capers.

Great taste especially for hot summer days. Substituted large iceberg lettuce leaves for bread and added lemon pepper to taste. Now a permanent resident of my recipe box.

to the tampa chef....lox is smoked salmon....you might also like nova salmon which is a less salty salmon. this sandwich reminded me of alaskan rolls at the japanese restau. even without the avocado i always use the capers as it gives a nice tang. "what could be bad?" stated with a shrug is a yiddishism for delish!

This is a great idea and the 4T minced capers we added added a whole bunch of complements from our family and friends. Next time I may add freah lemon grass on the cream cheese side instead. A keeper.

Yay i'm the first :) love this healthy sandwich...i don't even know what lox are so i used smoked salmon which isn't always my favorite but in this sandwich, yum yum. i had prepared some guacamole yesterday for chips so just used that with tomatoes,red onion and capers on plain bagel, would be yummy on an onion...serve open, like 2 mini sandwiches, easier to eat that way...this is gona be a regular for me at work, although warning: you'll need a breath mint
