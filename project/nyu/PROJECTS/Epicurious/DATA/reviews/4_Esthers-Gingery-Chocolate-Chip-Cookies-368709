I love chocolate chip cookies and have experimented with several recipes over the years and several 'additions,' but this was an unexpected wow! The ginger addition...what do you call that...umami? The too-hard cookies can be avoided by following the recipe exactly: six minutes high, six minutes low, five minutes on the pan out of the oven to finish.

I must have done something terribly wrong. These cookies were exceedingly hard and I didn't overbake them. Any thoughts or suggestions would be welcome.

These are the most delicious chocolate chip cookies that I have ever had the pleasure of making! It has been my personal quest to find the best, chewiest, moist and yet crispy cookie. This is it. I think that it would make a great recipe without the ginger, but why omit it? The ginger gives it a whole new dimension!thank you for sharing, Esther.

Delicious! What a special treat to have the little sweet gingery bits. Would be delicious without the chocolate too.

In my opinion, this is the perfect cookie recipe. I have never had cookies turn out with such a perfect balance of crispy and chewy. I have made them twice, the first time following the recipe exactly, the second time doubling the ginger and adding orange zest. This was only due to a personal preference for a zestier flavor however; the recipe is great as is. I plan on using this recipe as my go to for chocolate chip cookies also, although the ginger really makes them so amazing that I don't know if I will ever want plain chocolate chip cookies!

I baked these cookies for a Christmas potluck lunch at work and wasn't disappointed. They were so exceptionally delicious that they'll be my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe going forward (and that's saying alot - I'm an avid baker!). If you make the cookies smaller than suggested, you'll get more than 3 dozen from a single recipe. Also, if you opt for smaller cookies, they only take 10 minutes to bake.
