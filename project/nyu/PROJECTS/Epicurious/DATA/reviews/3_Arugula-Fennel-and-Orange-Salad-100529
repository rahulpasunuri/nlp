Even better with black olives like kalamata.

This was a nice light salad between the first and main course on New Year's Eve. The fennel added a delicate flavor. Instead of oranges, I used mandarin oranges, which was a sweeter counterpoint to the red onions. I will definitely make this again.

Unexciting in every way.

Made it for New Year's 2007 and it was good with a grilled New York strip. Used less arugula to the same amount of fennel and orange and it was very flavorful, although the dressing could have been more substantial.

I did not like the taste of the dressing, it lacked punch of flavor. I made it for a pot luck and no one liked it.

I will definitely make this again. By soaking the red onions in ice water 15 minutes or so, gives the onions a crisp , refreshing taste and eliminates the bitterness. I also agree that the juice from one large orange is sufficient.

This recipe resembles a favorite made with Spinach. However, we only use the red onion, seperate the oranges from their membranes and add the juice of one orange to the dressing. In the past, we added almod slivers, or coarsly chopped walnuts. I will make this salad, but, I will jettison the Shallots.

This makes a perky, refreshing salad that works well with any assertive greens. I used baby mustard greens that I had on hand, and I cut the orange sections free from their membranes right over the salad bowl, so the o.j. went directly onto the greens. My spouse, who doesn't like vinagrette-type dressings, lapped this up.

This salad didn't do it for me. The oranges didn't provide enough sweetness and there was too much onion flavor. If I liked it a bit more I would try it again and omit one of the two onion types.

Maybe all the reviews boosted my expectations too high. I made this once as above and really disliked it, mostly because of the overpowering onion flavor. The second time, I left out the red onions and shallots, and decreased the arugula to 5 cups to balance it with the fennel and orange better. But I still didn't like this salad.

Served this at a dinner party last night, very well recieved. I did use only about one half of the recommended fennel, as it is a flavor that can be overpowering. Also added more lemon juice to the dressing. Very, very good.

Although this may seem strange to some, it is a fantastic combination of flavors, even without the fennel. Also excellent with a Raspberry vinegrette.
