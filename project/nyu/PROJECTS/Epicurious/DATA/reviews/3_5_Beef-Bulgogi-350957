I just found this very average, nothing special - to be fair I did'nt have kimchi so maybe that would have made the dish. I found the sauce flavor overwhelmed everything else. Don't think I'll make again.

This was very good! I didn't have kiwi or an Asian pear but it didn't make a difference as the meat was sliced so thinly. I didn't put it together with lettuce cups and the like. I put a layer of rice, a layer of wilted spinach with nutmeg and then the meat with the sauce. This is sin on a plate. Very good and I'll make it again and again and again.

Delicious and easy to make.

I would recommend marinating the beef for much longer than an hour. I have tried cooking this after 1 hour of marination and a day of marinating, and the longer time makes all the difference. Still, we weren't terribly impressed with the results.

This recipe was great! I didn't have any mirin, so left it out and it wasn't missed. I also used kiwi instead of the Asian pear as someone else suggested, and it worked well. Instead of serving with the kimchi, mushrooms, and bean paste, I took the leftover marinade, cooked it down a bit and served it on top of the beef. It was great!

This is a traditional home cooking style of Bulgogi. I have been cooking this recipe for 20 years. Marinate the meat(shortrib or sirloin, 600g, very thinly sliced in the marinade(grated asian pear, 5Tbsp, sliced 1/2onion, scallion(chopped, 3Tbsp), brown sugar(3Tbsp), soy sauce(3Tbsp, i recommend to use a Korean or Japanese brand. Kikkoman wouldn't do it), Mirin(or other Korean rice cooking wine, 1Tbsp), sesame oil(1Tbsp, I prefer very flavorful brands in Korean market), minced garlic(1Tbsp), crushed and toasted sesame seeds, freshly ground black pepper. You can either saute in a frying pan in high heat or grill. Traditionally you wrap this meat in lettuce leaves with spicy soybean sauce. Enjoy!

I have made this several times and don't need to change a thing. It is god with or without the ginger. My Panamanian boyfriend had never had Korean food before and he devoured it!

As a Korean myself, I would suggest not including ginger. In all Korean cooking, ginger is only used for white meats (chicken and pork). The recipe will be MUCH tastier if ginger is left out!!

As is, this recipe is fantastically delicious. My carnivorous friend was a little suspect as we typically grill filet mignons and he's not a huge fan of ethnic foods. But he squawked the loudest about the wonderful flavors of the meat. I made a couple changes. My market had some great looking flat iron steak for SO cheap I couldn't resist. It was perfect. I didn't slice the meat so thin, but in long strips similar to how we might slice a skirt steak. Also, we thought we had more shoyu than we did & substituted tamari with no problems. Next time: bulgogi translates directly as "fire meat", and while this was savory/sweet deliciousness it was not spicy. Next time I will add red chile pepper flakes & a little sriracha to get some heat. It was a crowd pleaser, so I will be making it again later this summer.

This was amazing. I only marinated the beef for 45 minutes total, and it still came out extremely flavorful. I substituted the sugar for Splenda brown sugar blend (and thus reduced the amount to 1 T) and added another garlic clove. I served this with sticky rice, garlic and ginger stir fried snow peas, and an Asian cucumber salad.

My Korean friend Mrs. Lee will use kiwi fruit to tenderize if she doesnt have korean pear.This is a very authentic and delicious recipe

This is so yummy, I've made it 4 times now and really enjoy it!! Instead of cooking on a skillet, I grill the meat instead and it comes out perfect. In place of mushrooms, I marinate peeled cucumbers with sesame oil and vinegar, it really goes great with the meat.

A quick note about the addition of Pear: It is not as essential in this recipe as the Beef is sliced thinly. However, many Korean Short-Rib recipes call for using chopped Pears, and the added sweetness is secondary: Pears have an enzyme that helps break down the meat, making it tender. Korean Short-Ribs are cooked quickly, unlike the recipes we usually associate with this cut, and they need every bit of help tenderizing that they can get. Tommy Tommyskitchen.com

This is a pretty good rendition of Korean Bulgogi. This is one of my family's favorites. Just a couple of notes- the lettuce cups, the mushrooms, the bean paste and the kimchee are unnecessary to enjoy this. In my version, we don't use the pears, we really increase the garlic (at least double to 4-5 cloves), we use brown sugar, and we add spring onions, chopped or scallions to the marinate. The longer you marinate this the better- even overnight. My mom, who is Korean, says that you should put the sesame oil in last- right before cooking, as it has a tendency to coat the meat and not allow the different flavors to fully permeate the meat. But, this recipe is right on in that you have to use TOASTED sesame oil and TOASTED sesame seeds. Otherwise, you will not get the full benefit of the sesame flavor- not even close. You can also use this marinate for chicken, chicken wings, or pork tenderloin. I often kebab it and grill it. You won't be disappointed. Just serve with rice and another vegetable. Cook until the pan juices are absorbed- that's where alot of the flavor is. :)

Very nice. The note about putting the meat in the freezer to help slice it really helped. We didn't do the kimche or bean paste thing... we ended up wrapping the meat in lettuce leaves and eating it with a wasabi mayo dipping sauce. Awesome if not quite as intended in the recipe.

Very nice. The note about breifly putting the meat in the freezer is important to get the meat thin enough. We didn't do the kimche or bean paste I'm afriad... instead we wrapped the meat slices in lettuce leaves and used a wasabi mayo dipping sauce. Awesome if perhaps not quite as intended.
