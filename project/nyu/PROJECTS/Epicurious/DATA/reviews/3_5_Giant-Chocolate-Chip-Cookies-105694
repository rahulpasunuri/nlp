I made these for my class because we all had to bring in something. I chose cookies. They loved them! They were soft and I loved eating them right after they came out of the oven. Delicious. Can't wait to make them again!

Giant is the way all cookies should be!!! These cookies are delicious and are lots of fun to eat. I made mine a little bigger by using 1/2 cup of dough and increasing the baking time to 15 min. I then decorated them with colorful royal icing and gave them as gifts to my friends.

This recipe is very similar to a bakery in Colorado. There is not enough flour in this recipe. To perfect this recipe use all butter, use 2 1/2 cups flour, 2 teaspoons of vanilla, and only 1 1/2 cups chips.

Yummy chewy cookies! The only change I made was to double the vanilla, as recommended by other reviewers. My husband loves these!

Basically this is a "flat/crispy" chocolate chip cookie recipe that instead of spooning it out by the "rounded tablespoon/teaspoon"(depending on the effect you are going for), you dish this out by 1/4 cup full. The result it a ridiculously big blob of crunchy chocolate chip cookie, requiring 2 spatulas to remove it from the pan. Granted that my 9 year old son and his friend thought it was the best thing in the world. I think I'll stick with my old recipe.

This is the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe and the only one I use now. I never could get the cookies chewy until I found this recipe. I do follow the suggestions of a previous reviewer and sub some of the flour for oats and whole wheat flour. It's a little healthier and the kids love it.

These were very tasty cookies. I only used 12oz of chocolate chips, and they were still quite chocolately. My cooking time was 13 mins, and they were a golden brown colour. Would make again as did not take long.

I have been on a hunt for the best choc chip cookies and so far, this recipe is my favorite - a lightly crisp edge with a soft center that still tastes great the next day. After the first batch came out of the oven, I did reduce the size of the cookies to "large" instead of "giant". I reduced the baking time to 12-13 minutes for the giant cookies and 10-11 for the large size. I sandwiched some of them with vanilla ice-cream, and after a couple of days in the frezzer, they were delicious! (good the first day, but the cookies were hard. After soaking with the ice-cream, they got soft, just like i remember chip'wiches being...) The only change I made other than the baking time was to substitute whipping cream for the sour cream, as I had none in the house, and I don't think it made any difference.

Rating: 4
These cookies were fabulous! I did add an extra 1/4 cup of flour and added about 50% more vanilla. Also, I found that flattening the cookies slightly in the middle with the bottom of a measuring cupped made sure the cookies were thick and even. Bake for 13 minutes and you will have perfection!

I was psyched when I tried this recipe- I am THE biggest chocolate chip cookie addict and have made over 20 different kinds. This recipe was mediocre at best. I added the extra vanilla, and if I ever made these again, which I won't, I would add extra salt.

This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe that I have ever made, with two changes. The vanilla needs to be doubled, plus a little extra, and a cup and a half of walnuts are perfect. I'm throwing away all my other chocolate chip cookie recipes.

You can change this recipe up a little by adding cocoa powder and putting peppermint extract instead of vanilla. In the end, you wind up with fantastic mint chocolate chocolate chip cookies.

I have long been looking for a basic chocolate chip cookie recipe that offered the perfect blend of crispy edges and soft, chewe centers.This recipe offers all that, and will be my standard from now on. I followed another user and just scooped out 1/4 cup measures without bothering to flatten them out - perfect! They were inhaled by a band of kids right out of the oven.

best chocolate chip cookies - ever!! i only use 2 cups flour and add 1/2 cup of oatmeal. i also use 1 bag of hershey's special dark chocolate chips, and then chop about 3 ounces of callebaut dark chocolate and add that too. i usually use light sour cream. just the right balance of crunchy and chewy. they never last in this house!!!

This is the perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe. Big, soft cookies with a great flavor. I packed the dough into a ¼ cup measure (mines a little over 2 wide and about an inch deep) and shook loose onto the baking sheet  did not bother to flatten. Cookies came out perfect  thick and soft, a little crispier around the edges. I left them very slightly under-baked (13 minutes instead of 14), and the texture was perfect, even when fully cooled. This will be my new standard chocolate chip cookie recipe!

I couldn't leave it alone.... these cookies are perfect as is, but... this time I used 1 c. whole wheat flour, 1 c. all-purpose flour, and 1/2 c. oatmeal. Also subbed 1 T. lowfat vanilla yogurt for the sour cream, as I'm out of sour cream. Used all butter instead of half. They didn't spread too much (which often happens w/ all butter), a little more texture with the oatmeal... delic.

These cookies came out perfectly! Adding the tbsp of sour cream really made the difference. I substituted in 6oz of chopped bittersweet Scharfen Berger chocolate, which made the cookies look even better -- round and chopped chips -- as well as a deeper flavor. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I am in search of the best chocolate chip cookie recipe and so far this is the winner! (and we've made a lot of cookies in this house!) HOWEVER, the recipe was perfect as is in Colorado....not as good in Wisconsin....just to prove that it's not always the cook but sometimes the equipment and environment.

This is the recipe for me. I've tried numerous choc chip cookie recipes, and this is the one I'll stick with. I make them normal size, not giant, and bake at 375 for 12 minutes. The recipe is the pretty much the same as the Toll House recipe, plus 1T of sour cream which makes the difference between a hard v. soft cookie.

These cookies were so good! The best ones I've ever made or had. Was worried that they may run together on the pan but they turned out perfect. Used a slightly rounded 1/4 cup measure and a double recipe made twenty perfect cookies. Prepared exactly as written (but doubled it) and used a bag of Chip-its chocolate covered caramel balls and about a cup of chocolate chips. This is the first time I've tried the caramel balls and they are yummy, made them extra special. Used butter and butter flavoured Crisco shortening. May add some toasted pecans next time. Definitely going to add these to the menu in our Bistro, I know they'll be a big hit!

Fantastically delicious. I used all brown sugar and the Crisco shortening with 0 grams of trans-fats. Bottoms of cookies turn out wonderfully on silpat.

I really was skeptical at first when I saw the way they were baking in the oven, but they were delicious! I even used plain yogurt in place of sour cream, because I didn't have any. Definitely will make again. Thanks!

These turned out great with one notable addition: oatmeal. The first batch of ten cookies were flatter than pancakes (a nice, big cookie but way too flat). The next batch of 7, to which I added about 1/2 c. of oatmeal and baked on a Silpat mat, turned out perfect; they had a bit more character and were less smushey-looking. I used these for individual ice-cream sandwiches and they were great.

Rating: 2
This was an ok cookie recipe - the texture was wonderful, but the taste was overly sweet and bland. Perhaps it was due to the organic non-hydrogenated shortening I used. It might be better with butter-flavoured shortening (without sacrificing the great texture) but I hate to add the transfats. It might be worth making again to see if I can keep the chewy/crisp bake-shop texture and improve the taste. I used a small ice cream scoop, baked for 13 minutes in my rather slow oven. Got about 30 cookies this way.

Rating: 4
They were perfect! I added two cups of walnuts to the recipe and used a butter flavored shortening. The texture was crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle. I made them for a friend, but they were liked so much by my family that they never left the house!

This is my new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe! They look gorgeous, and the texture is perfect - crisp yet still slightly chewy in the center. I might try it with all butter next time, but made the recipe as written and they were fantastic. These are my new favorite cookies to give as gifts because they look so perfect.

Yummy! Next time I will try adding nuts, but as these were for my daughter's class, she thought it better to play it safe and go nutless. I replaced the vegetable shortening with margarine (I ran out of Crisco!) but otherwise followed the recipe precisely.

These were great cookies. I have found that baking cookies with my step daughter is a great way of bonding. So we try cookies recipes together frequently. These were a big hit. Chocolate chip cookies are not cookies you find in Holland, nor is it custom to bake cookies at home for the most part. So the introduction of these cookies on my step kids and dutch husband was a winner. I do have to haul bags of chocolate chips over from the US on every trip, but it is well worth the effort. We followed the recipe exactly as stated and deleted the nuts. (one of the kids is allergic) We will definitely make this recipe again together! Happy Bonding!

So these are basically toll-house cookies, just bigger. Recipe is pretty much identical in the basic proportions of fat, eggs, sugar, flour, leavening. One little-spoken of effect is that baking cookies greatly varies on the temperature of the dough, and very importantly the weather. Sometimes mine come out nice and flat, sometimes like huge lumps. Both taste good though.

Rating: 4
Yummy!! I made ice cream sandwiches out of this recipe! I chilled the cookies in the freezer, let a carton of vanilla bean ice cream sit out, then smothered the ice cream on one cookie and squished another on top. I then re-froze them for another 15 minutes or so and enjoyed them with my husband. Simple!

YUM! I'm always trying to find ways to liven up the tried-and-true chocolate chip cookie, and this is a great one! They're super fast & easy, and the size makes them a big hit! I brought them to a gathering and they were literally gone in minutes. I followed the cook from Maywood's advice on the baking soda, and I also added an entire bag of Heath baking bits (toffee covered in chocolate) to the batter along with the chocolate the recipe calls for. One tip- you may want to refrigerate each batch as it's waiting to go into the oven; I did, as I was afraid these would spread all over the place due to their size, and I didn't have any issues. I also used parchment- especially with toffee, it makes cleanup infinitely easier. I am definitely going to make this again!

I really enjoyed this recipe... a delicious cookie indeed! I checked the back of a bag of Nestle Semi-Sweet Morsels to compare this to the original Toll House recipe (my gold standard), and found them to be pretty close. This recipe substitutes 1/2 C. of shortning for butter, increases the vanilla extract by 1/2 tsp. and the chocolate by 4 oz., adds the sour cream, and looses the 1 cup of nuts. For an even MORE intense chocolate experience, the cook from Gilroy, CA (click more reviews below) may wish to further increase the amount of chocolate to 454 grams! ;)

Rating: 3
I have made these cookies several times and have found that the following changes helped immensely. 1) These cookies can easily spread too much. Instead of adding flour or cocoa (cookies are already pretty dense), consider substituting baking powder for the baking soda and eliminating 1-2 teaspoons of the white granulated sugar. 2) The nuts, listed as optional, are a must. I use pecans.

Rating: 3
Oh baby! These were to die for and only about 327 calories per cookie....well I'll just skip my next two meals. I didn't have light brown sugar, so I used dark and also used light sour cream (surprise) and 21/2 cups choc. chips. Baked for 11 min. as per past rec. and what emerged was beyond compare. So much for the New Years resolution.

I gave this 2 forks because my husband said it's the best cookie he's ever had, but I didn't care for it at all. It was too dry for me. Not enough chocolate chips, I would use 16 oz. next time.

After reading several of the reviews of this recipe, I decided instead of adding an extra 1/4 cup of flour or cocoa to just skip sifting the flour. This seemed to work out fine. I also followed the suggestions of a little bit smaller cookies and less baking time I tried 11 minutes, but since my oven bakes hot 9 minutes was perfect. I personally didn't find any thing extra special about the taste to this cookie. I think I prefer the recipe that I got out of "Ladies Home Journal" a couple of years ago better. I will probably try this recipe again and make ice cream sandwich cookies out of them.

This was the best cookie recipe ever! Also very versatile. I made two batches: the first one just as the recipe called for. It made a flatter, more spread out cookie -excellent! The second I added almost 1/4 c of baking cocoa as suggested by many reviewers. This made a fuller, more cake-like cookie also delicious! In both batches I added 1 bag and a quarter of semi-sweet chocolate chunks instead of chips. Important with this very large cookie. Next time I'll add semi-sweet and bittersweet chunks to the cocoa-chocolate chip cookies. Each batch only yeilded about 15 cookies (using less than 1/4 cup per cookie) instead of 20. That happens with every cookie recipe that I use. Mmmmmmm....

This is an excellent chocolate chip cookie recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except I use dark chocolate chips. It's better than the Toll House recipe that I have been using.

These cookies were amazing! I used a mix of milk chocolate and semi-sweet chips and also used light sour cream because that was all I had. They are really big cookies. Even after I tried putting less dough in each one, they still spread out quite a bit. Also, I cooked them for about 12 minutes and they were really soft and chewy.

I make these all the time and they go fast! My husband loves them and eats one after another. I don't make them as large as this recipe calls for (more like 1/8c size) and they come out perfect. I also cook these longer than suggested because I don't like doughy soft cookies. Try 1/8c size dropped on cookie sheet and bake for 16 minutes. MMMMMMM!!!! These are wonderful and very easy.

Loved these cookies! I have been loyal to the Tollhouse recipe since I have been making chocolate chip cookies, but from now on will be using this one.

This is a great alternative to the tried and true Tollhouse recipe. I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour as the dough seemed to wet and I don't like crisp cookies. Also added Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips and a dash a cinnamin, and let the dough rest in the fridge between baking, it gets soft really fast.
