This soup was lovely and refreshing on the hot day when I made it. Today a strong wind blew in and the temperature dropped. I sprinkled Parmesan cheese on a bowl of the soup and popped it in the microwave. Wow! It was just what I wanted: something comforting and delicious!

This is a delicious soup. The only thing I added was a few dashes of cayenne and a few pinches of sugar. Like one of the other reviewers, I pureed the entire batch. Everyone loved it!

I made this for my family on Saturday night and it was a big hit. My husband asked me to make it again Sunday night for our friends! Using the fresh tomatoes is so great, and since they're in season I used vidalia onions too. I have not been chopping the thyme, but instead but a bunch of sprigs in and then fish them out before I blend the soup. I've also blended all of the soup, not half, because my husband doesn't chunks of tomato. I think it actually would be as good with half of it blended. I also have been lazy and have NOT grilled the croutons, but have done them in the oven. I'm sure grilled they would be outstanding!

I am not a fan of cold soups but decided to make this for a summer dinner party. I must tell you, this is one of those dishes that when everyone takes a taste they rave. I did add a little more salt than was called for. Used homemade garlic croutons instead of what the recipe called for and it was great. This is a keeper!

I served this in the "Dizzy" cocktail glasses from Crate & Barrel as an appetizer for a dinner party and it was amazing!! Since we are not quite in tomato season here in New Jersey I also used whole San Marzano tomatoes in the large can. I added the tomatoes at the same time I added my fresh tomatoes, and I squeezed them in my hand before adding them to the pot. About 5 minutes after I added the broth and thyme, I added the juice from the can. Also, I used an immersion blender to get a great consistency. I kept the croutons simple...used day old sourdough, cut into 1 inch cubes, melted butter over top, added salt and pepper, mixed in a large bowl. Put them in the toasted oven at 275, and tossed them often to get them to brown on all sides. Delicious!!

This is elegant yet filling. For a picnic, we served it in plastic wine glasses. Used store bought croutons.

Served this with grilled chicken sandwiches for a "soup/sand" summer dinner party. Awesome and met with rave reviewed.

Par for the course, I can not follow instructions, just ask my manager. I used heirloom tomatoes, sweet Maui onion and SHS (Seven Hour Stock). Can you say yum? Sure you can!

Great, easy recipe. I added about 1T sugar, which I thought was just right. Good soup for a hot summer day.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. It is easy and tasty! The kitchen smells FABULOUS during and after. Use fresh thyme and fresh tomatoes from your farmer's market. YUMMY!!!
