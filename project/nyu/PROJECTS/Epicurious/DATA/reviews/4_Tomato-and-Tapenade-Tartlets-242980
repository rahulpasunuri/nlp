This was good, but we could have achieved the same flavors with oven roasted tomatoes and cheese over bread or pasta. To me, it just wasn't worth the extra effort and calories with the puff pastry.

So easy and delicious... A great make-ahead app. I have never used puff pastry this way; what a great surprise!

This is a delicious, different side dish with grilled meat or fish. It's a staple in our house in the summer; it's good even in very hot weather. I cook the puff pastry for less time than the recipe calls for. Maybe I'm rolling it too much, but if I bake it for more than about 12 minutes total, until just golden, it's too brown and tastes burnt.

This is a summer staple for my husband and me. It's a different, delicious side dish that dresses up grilled meat, fish, etc. and is great even in the hottest weather.

I spent $65 on ingredients for this recipe for a party app - including black truffle infused olive oil - and it came out ghastly. A soggy, oily, disgusting mess. Maybe my tapenade was too oily? This recipe had a four-fork rating when I tried it, and this is the first time a four-fork rated recipe has turned out bad for me.

I made the tapenade and prepped tomato and mozz, quickly cooked pastry, assembledm and fresh out of the oven just as the guests were arriving. I used individual frozen shells and I liked that this was easy to make and also pretty substantial. Will definitely make again and will experiment with pesto, sun dried tomatoes and goats cheese and other pairings.

This is the perfect appie to have waiting when guests arrive. Great at room temp so holds if they are late. A drizzle of truffle oil and wow, over the top.

Fantastic. I made one big tart instead of individual tartlets.

This is delicious. Use pre-made frozen tart shells to save time.
