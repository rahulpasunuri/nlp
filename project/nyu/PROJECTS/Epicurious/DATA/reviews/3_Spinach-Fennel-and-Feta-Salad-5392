This is one of my favorite side salad recipes! It's great with grilled fish or steak. I often use baby arugula instead of spinach. And french sheep feta is really good.

I was intrigued by the ingredients, but put off by the fact that they were served raw. So we braised the fennel in wine for ten or fifteen minutes, then wilted the spinach in the same pan. Topped off with toasted pine nuts and feta cheese. That made a very good side dish.

I took a chance that the very different types of flavor in these ingredients would come together to create something interesting but, alas, they didn't. It wasn't bad but I wouldn't serve it again.
