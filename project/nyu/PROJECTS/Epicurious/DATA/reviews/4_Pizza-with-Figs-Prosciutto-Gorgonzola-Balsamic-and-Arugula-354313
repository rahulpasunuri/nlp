This is my favourite pizza,just wish I could find fresh figs more often.

Opted for the cheap and lazy version of this (Boboli crust and bacon), and it was still delicious! As per the other reviewers recommendations, I scaled back a bit on the amount of each topping, thus the flavors were exceptionally well balanced and not at all overwhelming. Easy and tasty! I'll undoubtedly make this every summer when my neighbor gives me fresh figs from her back yard!

I recommend using half the amount of Gorgonzola and using the fig jam that another reviewer suggested. I couldn't find any at the store but that would really bring out the fig flavor. I also used six cups of arugula and it was more than enough.

Yes. Yes. Yes. That's all I have to say. Oh, and award winning. Couple things: Trader Joe's has very decent pizza dough - pre-made - and I NEVER buy pre-made dough. I do the whole wheat, but both taste homemade. That makes this pizza a snap. Also from Trader Joe's, I buy fig butter, but is more like a jam. Very spreadable and makes the entire thing more flavorful. Sometimes I sprinkle pine nuts on the top.

The Pizza was definitely enjoyable. I made it for my boyfriend who immediately thought he wouldn't like it because of the arugula. He loved it. But I felt the pizza was missing a little something. I would suggest adding some caramelized onions as the first layer perhaps.

A wallop to the tastebuds... Don't make this unless you like strong flavors. Made as directed except using watercress for arugula and a balsamic reduction.

Yum. Couldn't find figs so I used fresh apricots, which were phenomenal. Forgot about the vinegar and just used regular flour rather than cornmeal but it turned out oh so good.

This was so good that it caused me to actually rate and write a review for the very first time on this site. And I've cooked some great things from here. After eating this, we thought "hmmm, maybe we should open a pizza restaurant". This is slam dunk! One tip - we made two pizzas with about the same amount of toppings just spread out more thinly so it didn't overwhelm and I think it was a really good ratio. You must try this!

Great with pears if figs are out of season.

Made this last night for an appetizer and it was soooo delish! Could have just skipped dinner and gone straight to dessert! We adapted the method a bit for our grill. In addition, we cut the prosciutto into strips and interspersed it with the figs. Seemed to be easier to eat that way. Will definitely be on the menu again at our house! We paired with a Spanish verdejo, but would also go well with a pinot noir.

This was the BEST pizza I have ever made! Although I couldn't find any figs, I did have some nice looking peaches! I diced the peaches and used very little of the gorgonzola- just enough to taste and smell it. We used a premade thin crust (it was a wednesday gimme a break) and slathered olive oil all over it to make it nice a crispy. To my surprise it held up realy well. Also I made a balsamic reduction with red pepper flakes and drizzled it over the top. I cut the prosciutto into ribbons so it would be easier to manage. Absolutely AWESOME!

Used the pizza crust my husband has perfected, and about 4c arugula. Next time, will do the same crust, but will use the full 8c arugula. It wilts and is just the perfect contrast to the sweet/crunchy/salty of the other ingredients. (I used all Gorgonzola and it was definitely worth it.) A perfectly gourmet pizza, worthy of serving to anyone!

Mmmm, so good. I had some leftover figs, prosciutto, and blue cheese, thought this would be a great way to use them up. I also had leftover kale, so I topped the pizza with the crispy kale recipe from this site rather than arugula - loved the crunnch it gave to the pizza! Like other reviewers, I used a mixture of blue cheese, parmesan and mozzarella (didn't have enough blue cheese leftover) and regular balsamic to soak the figs... I'm sure it would have been excellent as written, since it was terrific even with my modified leftovers!

I loved this recipe, but made the following modifications based on what I had available: Used some flat bread that I already had (what I typically use for making pizzas); used a combination of gorgonzola, goat, and mozzerella cheeses, again because it's what I had; cut down initial baking time since the crust didn't need to bake through; used serrano ham instead of prosciutto. Really enjoyed this, my husband did too.

Wow! This is easy and really delicious. I didn't have prosciutto, so I subbed bacon. Also, I like gorgonzola but 2 cups sounded like a lot for such a strong favor. I cut it by about 1/2 and then used goat cheese and fresh mozzarella for the rest. Divine!

Made this for a family gathering where all we served were a variety of unique homemade pizzas. This one was simply delicious! The flavors all complemented one another nicely. I happened to have fig balsamic in my pantry and it was a wonderful addition, but aged balsamic or a even a balsamic reduction would probably work great as well. To those who felt the blue cheese was overpowering, there are a wide range of blue cheeses and their flavor and sharpness vary widely. Though I prefer the sharpness and creaminess of a French Roquefort, some may do better with some of the more subtle domestic blues (talk to the person manning your cheese counter to help you choose one that is mild). A sweet Italian Gorgonzola Dolce might also work, although it will make the dish sweeter.

This is a delicious combination of flavors. I made my own pizza dough, which made the pizza even better and I cut out the prosciutto altogether. Still great!

This caught my eye one summer night and I absolutely had to make it. I cheated and bought dough from our local pizzeria, used all Gorgonzola (was fine for our palate), San Daniele prosciutto and aged balsamic. Grilled it outside- quick, easy and YUMMY! I had to fight my husband for the leftover piece the next day!

I didnt have enough gorgonzola so I added some goat cheese and mozzarella. The traditionalist boyfriend and our picky gal pal flipped over it. The only pizza we have made where no leftover remained- too bad really!

I agree. That amount of Gorgonzola was just a bad idea. The concept is great, the flavors should mix well, but with a quarter of that amount of Gorgonzola. Next time I am substituting the rest with a nice mozz or something more delicate. Figs on pizza though, not bad.

i went to a cheese shop in the market and got a creamy and mild gorgonzola, and then tempered it with some young mozzarella. for some reason i couldnt get figs (when they are in season), but instead used sliced white peaches, putting them on from the start of the cooking time -- with the balsamic they were beautiful...almost caramelized.

Great flavors, but I also agree that the gorgonzola is a bit overpowering to the figs. Next time I'll mix half gorgonzola with guyere or another milder cheese. I used Trader Joe's pizza dough which was great, much better than I was expecting. I originally thought that there would be too much arugula, however, it wilted wonderfully from the heat of the pizza. I didn't have fig balsamic and used regular, I think it still tasted great.

nice flavors except the Gorgonzola cheese kind of overwhelms the other ingredients a bit, might try it with another cheese. super easy and tasty though.
