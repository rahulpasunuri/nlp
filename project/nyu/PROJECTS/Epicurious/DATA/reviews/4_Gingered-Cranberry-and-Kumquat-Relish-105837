Really liked the look of this but couldn't find kumquats this year. With a fair amount of trepidation, I used mandarin oranges (with a bit of the peel de-pithed). It was a bit gingery, but everyone LOVED it. Definite keeper!

Why have I been cooking cranberries all of these years? This is the best and easiest recipe ever!! Literally, my guests were fighting over the last spoonful at Thanksgiving. Next year, and every year, I will make two batches. Even people who don't like cranberry sauce will love this relish.

I fixed this cranberry dish when it was published in '01. I have a grandson that couldn't get enough of it and he usually didn't like cranberry sauce or relish of any kind.

My family has made a cranberry-orange relish for about 20 years. Last year I "updated" with this recipe and it was TERRIFIC! The ginger and kumquat really add an interesting flavor kick and textural element. As long as I'm in charge, we're not going back.

WOW! Been making this for Thanksgiving for 5-6 yrs now!! Everyone loves it! I don't use as much sugar & alternate oranges/tangerines as the my kumquats aren't in full spendor by Thanksgiving!!

This will be the seventh Thanksgiving in a row that I've made this by request from family members. It is very good and very simple.

the easiest cranberry sauce ever, and so delicious. I've made this for the past two thanksgivings and people flip over it. I think it is a bit heavy on the sugar, but otherwise fantastic.

Absolutely delicious. I was a little concerned about a no cook recipe, but it was the perfect blend of sweet and tart. The kumquat and ginger added extra zip. It is so easy to make. My only complaint was that there wasn't any leftover for the next day. Everyone had great compliments for this recipe.
