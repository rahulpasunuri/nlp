Surprisingly delicious! I say surprising because of how simple this is. The minimalist recipe really just highlights the flavors and textures of the ingredients. I'll make it again!

Made this as a vegetarian dinner for two by serving with couscous, and upping the vinegar. Also added some green garlic to spice it up a bit. Served it with a little balsamic vinagrette to add a little "sauce". It was very good.

These were perfect! Super easy, delicious, and ready in a flash. I did stir-fry slightly longer than 3 minutes, but I kept taste testing as I went and waited until they were just al dente, slightly crunchy. I prepared as per the recipe, no alterations. Great with ham, cheesy potatoes, and salad.

I made this dish awhile ago and it has since become a staple on our dinner table. It simply can't be beat in terms of ease and cooking time. So simple and yet the finished product is colorful, tasty, and makes a lovely addition to any plate!

I might make again but I would probably blanch the sugar snaps first as they stayed VERY crisp. It looks pretty and has a nice fresh taste, but I wasn't overly impressed. Maybe add a little garlic? That seems to improve almost any dish!

Quick. Easy. Colorful. Try toasting some pine nuts and tossing them in for variation. I also like using balsamic vinegar - but be careful not to use too much.

Very nice. A change from the usual vegetables. I added a little more vinegar and some salt & pepper. Would definitely make again for a change of pace.

This is very good. Actually, I guess I didn't follow the recipe. I added a yellow squash and used a combo of garlic and red onion since I didn't have shallots. I also used red wine vinegar and it was great. I think this is a recipe you could adapt using many different veggies. Great, quick, healthy side.

I doubled the recipe and cut the chicken into 3 inch pieces and cooked the dish on a ribbed stove-top griddle. It was very good!

I have made this recipe many times,as my family loves it. It is so colorful on the plate and has a great crunchy texture Best of all though is it's ease of preparation. From stove to table in less than five minutes. You can't beat that if you are pressed for time and you want to serve your family a veggie they will eat. Try starting out serving this dish with half the vinegar for the picky eaters.

This made a beautiful presentation, and such a nice change of pace! My husband, who was doubtful about the tomatoes, actually ate everything on his plate and was amazed at how the cooking took the acidity out of the tomatoes. He loved them! I used grape tomatoes instead of cherry, and they are little flavor bombs even before cooking. Simply delicious when stir-fried. The 3-minute cooking time is perfect to make the peas crispy tender. Yum! Will definitely keep this in my repertoire for side vegetable dishes. Would be gorgeous for entertaining.

I've made this recipe several times. It looks very pretty on the plate and tastes nice and fresh. The tomatoes are particularly tasty, so I usually use more tomatoes. I've skipped the shallots and haven't really missed them.

Great basic recipe for very fresh peas. (More important to have fresh off-the-vine peas than off-the-vine tomatoes. since it is unlikely that both will be ripe in the garden at the same time. Watch the amount of oil.

Nice colour and texture. Will do this recipe again.
