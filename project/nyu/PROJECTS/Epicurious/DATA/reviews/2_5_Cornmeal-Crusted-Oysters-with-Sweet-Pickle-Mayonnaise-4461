They certainly aren't fried, but a nice alternative. Omit salt as oysters are briny enough on their own. Also used a dash of Old Bay in addition to the cayenne and served with cole slaw rather than the mayo dip. Used parchment brushed with oil for easy clean-up.

Used my pampered chef pizza stone- nice crust /no mess. Subbed 1 T Old Bay for cayenne. Nice alternative to greasy fried oysters

Maybe I did something wrong, but this was like eating sawdust and it trashed my baking sheet as well.

Much easier to handle with children around than setting up a deep fryer. But I do tend to like the deep fried oystersd best. I guess it's the cajun in me coming out.
