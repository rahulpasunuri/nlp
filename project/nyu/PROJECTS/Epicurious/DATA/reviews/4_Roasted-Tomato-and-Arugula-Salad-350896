Delicious! I roasted cherry tomatoes (that is what I had) with red pepper flakes, garlic, kosher salt and Italian seasonings. Made the dressing for the arugula exactly as recipe states and found it's a bit too much dressing but it did taste great. Tossed the arugula in the bowl with the dressing, put it in a plate with tomatoes on top and sprinkled with Feta. Fantastic! Great for lunch with Italian Bread - to soak up the extra dressing!

How can this be a 4 fork recipe with no reviews? Hmm....
