I have some sugestions a chef friend gave to me: add some flour to the shrimp, and also chicken boullion powder (instead of salt) and then, some white wine. The flour will help sauce to thicken. Parsley helps to avoid the garlicky aftertaste because it is astringent.

Don't they mean roast a HEAD of garlic, as opposed to just one glove? One glove would be pretty skimpy.
