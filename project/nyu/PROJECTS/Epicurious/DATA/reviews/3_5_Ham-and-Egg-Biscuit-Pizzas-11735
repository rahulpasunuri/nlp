OUTSTANDING BRUNCH DISH

Rating: 3
I tried this recipe on my "breakfast club" and it was delicious! To save time I used Pillsbury biscuit dough, and it worked just fine. Tonight, I'm making it for my family, using the actual biscuit recipe. It is very simple to make, and a good way to use up my Easter ham!

I made the recipe as given, except used feta cheese. It was great--making the biscuit dough was fairly simple and so yummy! I sauteed the peppers and onions the night before, and put the "pizzas" in the oven right when my guests arrived. Count on 1 to 1-1/2 per person!

This was a very easy and delicious dish. I also cheated and used pre-made biscuit dough. My guests gobbled these up and there were no leftovers. A couple of suggestions. If you like spicy food, try using pepper jack cheese, or try blending tabasco or a little green pepper sauce into the pepper/onion mixture. The recipe didn't indicate what kind of baking dish to use. I used a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. It made clean-up a breeze.

This is a really great brunch item - it has wonderful presentation, and is especially easy if you use refrigerated biscuit dough readily available in any supermarket.
