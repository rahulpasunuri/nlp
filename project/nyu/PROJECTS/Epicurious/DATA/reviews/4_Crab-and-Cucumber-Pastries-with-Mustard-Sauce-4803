I agree that this is superb. It is a show stopper appetizer. I thought the chutney sounded ludicrous but it totally works! You can also use a square of puff pastry instead of phyllo.

Absolutely one of the best appetizers for a cocktail party ever! Every component works well. I didn't change a thing other than purchasing the phyllo dough cups that were prepared. Perfect!

Incredible recipe! So easy and such a refreshingly good appetizer. I used the phyllo sheets (which I hate working with) and placed them in mini muffin tins like others suggested. Next time I'll buy the phyllo cups. Very elegant and delicious. Made them for a Christmas Dinner Party.

This was a really tasty, easy recipe, and looks like it took a lot of work. I misread the recipe and stuffed the phyllo before baking, and I had to bake it for a little longer, but it turned out great. I used honey dijon mustard and it was very mild and flavorful. I will definately make it again for cocktail or dinner parties.

Doubled this recipe for a dinner party for eight on Saturday night. It was fantastic and fairly easy to do!!! I prepared everything the day before. There was really no need to double the mustard sauce component of the recipe.

Sounds like a strange combination of flavors, but they all work well together. This is a GREAT appetizer! I thought the recipe sounded like alot of pastry, so I just cut each sheet of phyllo into 16 squares, placed them on a cookie sheet on Silpat or parchment, and baked them at 400 for 12-14 minutes. After they cooled, I carefully hand split each square, filled with a generous tablespoon of crab, a few cucumber matchsticks, and a little dollop of chutney. Then I replaced the top and drizzled on some mustard sauce. It presented beautifully. As I made this recipe, I got about 30-32 pieces. This is AWESOME served with a VERY dry champagne!! YUM!!

I liked this recipe but I used white canned crabmeat - next time I'll buy lump crab from the fish market as the canned isn't as flavorful or rich. I also didn't have mango chutney but I liked the mustard sauce (I'd put a touch less dijon in than what was called for next time). The little cuke sticks really pretty and freshen the dish up. Think I'll also try it with a little cubed fresh mango in the future to make it even more summerry.

This is the most perfect appetizer. So delicious and yet light and not too filling. I also used mini muffin tins for the phyllo to serve individually and everyone raved. They are beautiful to look at and look very impressive. For the 4 sheets of phyllo I only needed half of the filling and mustard sauce. I followed the recipe to the letter and would not make any changes. Fabulous, can't wait to make it again.

I did as one reviewer suggested and make the phyllo into cups by putting them in mini muffin tins. I then put the crab mixture, the cucumber mixture and topped with the chutney and cream mixture. It was wonderful. I used it as an appetizer for a News Years Party. It tasted great but will not keep for long. Next time I would use it for a sitdown dinner or for an appetizer at a dinner party. That way it is served and eaten immediately. Definately a Keeper

This is just fantastic! The crab mixture and the dilled cucumbers were exceptional, and in serving I used both the mustard sauce and the mango chutney-a wonderful combination of flavors. Since it was a first course, I downsized the portions, but still an elegant presentation. I love the fact that much of this can be made ahead.

I modified the recipe for a party. I doubled the crabmeat mixture and pressed it into star-shaped cookie cutters. I arranged the "stars" on the platter then garnished with the mustard sauce. I served with croissant triangles- everyone was able to take as much crabmeat and mustard to suit thier tastes. A big hit.

A very impressive starter for an elegant dinner. It was a little time consuming but it got rave reviews by my picky friends and family. I did the phyllo pastry as directed but i think the effect would have turned out better if i cut the phyllo into squares first and then coat brush it with the melted butter and leave a little space around the edges unbuttered so that after it bakes, the edges don't 'seal' together and create a pocket shape (even more time consuming i know, but i figure if you're going to take the time to make this anyway...) Also, my mustard sauce was a little too thick to 'drizzle' which didn't look so good on the plate and my friend says it wasn't necessary to begin with. I think next time i might forego the mango chutney and put some topiko with some long chive stems on top as a pretty garnish.

By using the suggestion to make little cups out of the phyllo dough, this recipe is easily converted to bite size finger food. I presented each cup pre-filled with the crab mixture and filled small bowls with the mustard sauce, cucumbers and chutney allowing each guest to garnish according to their own taste. The chutney is a must!

Exquisite!Superb blend of flavors. Substitute a croissant in three layers filled as directed, and KEEP the mango chutney. Easier than phyllo and just as richly delicious. Company fare in summer.

In fact, I'm just getting ready to make it again. This dish is simple, fast, and all the separate portions can be prepared the day in advance and just assembled when you're ready. I did modify it somewhat, is it was not for a sit down dinner. I used mini muffin tins to make phyllo cups (4 squares, in a star pattern, folded out at the edges), then just added the crab, cuke, and mustard sauce dobbed on top. I did without the mango cutney completely. It was a stunner, and the first dish to go!
