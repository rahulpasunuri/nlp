Good, but not great. Easy to make. Made it in a small pyrex, which worked fine. It was very liquid when pouring it into the pan, but set fine.

Fast, easy any very good. I baked it in a tart pan. Start to finish, 50 minutes

I made this again for my French class, and it got great reviews! However, I wanted to mention that this time instead of whisking the ingredients, I briefly buzzed them in the blender. I think this resulted in a puffier product, which made it more attractive.

Easy and delicious. I did not have any problem with the batter leaking out of the spring form pan. Nevertheless, I think the recipe would work just as well in a pie pan. Because we have a cherry tree, I used sour cherries. I coated them in a bit of sugar and heated them in a small sauce pan just until the sugar dissolved. Drained and put in the cake pan. I made half the recipe and baked in a 7" spring form pan for about 30 minutes. I'm eager to make it again while we sil have fresh cherries on our tree.

Great dessert and so quickly made with frozen cherries. I took it to a get-together last week that was attended by "foodies", and was told that it was the best dessert there. So I made it again the next day for family, where it also received rave reviews. I did not make it in a springform pan for fear of it dripping out, and it worked just fine in an oval dish the first time, a square one the next. However, it probably would look prettier in a pan where it could be unmolded. It is a delicious, but homey dessert. I should mention that I only cooked it for about 40 minutes, and that was ample time.

I made this last night and it was good but not great. It turned out way too sweet for me, I used the 1/2 cup of sugar and bing cherries, so perhaps a tart cherry would have been better. Others loved it, though, so it could just be my palate that balked at the sweetness.

I've made this three times and my husband loves it. He even made it by himself (this from someone whose mother shooed him from the kitchen when he was a boy). I know what you mean about the springform pan. I have to wrap aluminum foil around the bottom or put the pan on a pizza pan. I've tried it with strawberries but the cherry is better. Also, it's better the first or second day; it seems to lose something after that.

I made this in a spring form--it dripped profusely until it baked a few minutes. I recommend using a pie or cake pan (as all other clafouti recipes do). Everyone loved it, although its much more custardy than other clafoutis I've baked and prefer.

These are delicious! I made these in ramekins and also cut down on the time I baked them - 20 minutes. I used honey instead of sugar too. The cherry, vanilla and lemon were a lovely mix of flavors and this was a very easy dish to make. Thoroughly enjoyed it and it was a hit with my husband and three year old.

I don't know if I made this right...followed the directions to the T...but it came out the consistency of crepes. Very strange. The only redeeming quality was the lemon zest.

Cut the recipe in half and made 4 ramekin custard cups. It came out very well and was easy to make. Bake time was much shorter - about 20 minutes - perhaps because of the size of the ramekins. Good use of fresh cherries.
