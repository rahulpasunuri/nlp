Good, but not the best veggie dish I've ever made. Used only basil and thyme instead of the herbs in the recipe and left out the lemon zest. Used ciabatta bread, which worked well.

Very good but not great. I added 3 cloves of garlic and doubled the cheese which made this even tangier. It also begged for basil which I'll add if I make this again.

I thought I would love this recipe. I sliced my tomatoes, salted, and drained on paper towels then presses excess moisture. Then pretty much followed the recipe. It wasn't watery, but I thought it was bland, as did my guests. I make a great tomato pie--I'll stick to that instead.

Very good and very versatile. Add a small eggplant if you like, add fresh basil, add more cheese etc. It's delicious and simple any way you cut it. Also an impressive display for veggies!

Great recipe. I cooked it on the grill in tin foil for about 20 min on low heat. It was delicious. I also used yellow and orange peppers, large red tomatoes and orange cherry tomatoes. I didn't have the herbs so I used fresh basil and chives from the garden.

Made this for a potluck, not a crumb left. Will be making for a birthday dinner this week, easy and pretty and ever so tasty.

Delicious and well worth the effort. A little watery, but perhaps that had to do with my being eager to taste it and therefore not letting it cool completely. Next time, I'll try making it with plum tomatoes and see if this results in less liquid.

fairly time consuming, but tasted very good. not your traditional gratin... it was very watery-juicy, without the traditional crumbly-cheesy crusted top, which I like.

This sounds yummy! I plan to make this tonight - thanks for the tips. I usually cut a tomatoe in half and gently squeeze out the extra liquid before using it unless I am making soup or a sauce and want the extra liquid.

I DID like it. I am actually making it again tonight... With a few variations, though: 1. I do not use heirloom, but regular cooking tomatoes (Roma). They release less water. 2. No baguette (it will turn into mush), but a heartier, very crusty, one-day-old bread. 3. I add the top layer of bread toward the end (last 10-15 minutes, so it won't burn) Yes, I agree there will be some of water, but if the pan is not covered, quite a bit will evaporate and the middle layer of bread will absorb the rest.

Very VERY watery. Swimming in water. Wasted $13 worth of heirlooms. Next time I will try purging the tomatoes first -- scoop out the innards with a grapefruit spoon, sprinkle liberally with kosher salt, and drain upside down on a rack for an hour. Rinse salt off and use. Good flavor, but an ocean of water. The middle layer of bread is wasted.

I was surprised at how much water the tomatoes let out in the cooking process - my gratin was drowning! so the bread in the middle layer became very soggy. Maybe I did something wrong, but I wouldn't make this recipe again even though the flavor was nice - it was a gratin soup!

I made this recipe last night, and while the results are quite tasty, I'm perplexed by the whole gratin genre. I've made variations on scalloped potatoes before but never a gratin like this. I expected the various components to meld into a cohesive dish (like a lasagne), but instead they seemed to stay quite separate, almost like a baked bread salad (as strange as that sounds). Also, I didn't have room in the pan for the top layer of bread, so I omitted it. Again, it was good, but a very unfamiliar format to me.

This is amazing!! I did make a few changes: I had fewer peppers on hand than the recipe calls for, and i might have doubled the amount of oil in the end because the bread didn't seem to be getting uniformly coated with the 5 T called for (I'm sure excessive oil contributed to making it so tasty.)I also added more rosemary and thyme, and sprinkled more cheese on the layers (okay, so cooking light is not my style). But it's excellent! Delicious! You won't be sorry!
