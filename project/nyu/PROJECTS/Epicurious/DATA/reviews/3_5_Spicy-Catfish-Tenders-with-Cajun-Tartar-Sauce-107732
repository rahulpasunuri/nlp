Made the dish for dinner, my husband has Louisiana roots and is always looking for cajun dinners. as an addition i tossed them in a honey and tobasco sauce mixture my dad swears by and we didn't even need the tartar. great dinner:)

I made this for a New Orleans themed party, and was going to serve them as part of dinner. On an impulse I had a friend pass them around as an appetizer, and the three pounds of catfish I sliced and deep fried in a fryer (much easier than a skillet, I'm sure) were gone in a matter of minutes! And my guests couldn't say enough about them!! And they still ate the dinner! A rousing success...I will definitely try these again.

Tartar sauce is great. Perfect as written. Used Louisiana hot sauce and homemade Emeril's Essence Cajun Seasoning (recipe available on FoodNetwork or his website). The tartar recipe does make a lot, even cut in 1/2, but I don't see why it wouldn't keep in the frig a while. Maybe I'll check that out...

Great family dinner! Although the tarter sauce was yummy, the recipe made too much and we threw out a lot. I will cut it in half next time. I will also add more hot sauce to the fish. We baked our fish in the oven @ 500* oiled the pan and cooked each side for 5-7 min. and they turned out lovely.

@ kimchi29 I also found that most store bought cajun spice mixes are to salty so I now make my own and I highly recommend it since most of the items are pantry staples

Made the Tatar Only!! I like the flavor a lot, but it's was a bit too salty. I added some extra lemon and some fresh chopped parsley (abt 1 T) that seemed to helped. Next time maybe try it with a salt free Cajun seasoning.

This tartar sauce was GREAT - and I don't even like tartar sauce. I also oven fried the catfish (at 450), and it was a great meal. I'll will absolutely be making this again!

My family and I loved this recipe! I did make a couple of changes though. After mixing the egg and hot sauce together I also added enough buttermilk to cover the fish. Then I let it soak in the hot sauce for 30 minutes. I also used my own fry mix with the Cajun seasoning. The tartar sauce was TERRIFIC I would definitely make it again!

I followed the recipe to the letter and found it a little bland. Next time, I'll put the cajun seasoning directly on the fish vs. in the breading mixture. Or sprinkle directly on after the fish is cooked. The tartar sauce, however, was fantastic. It took longer than a minute or two for the fish to become golden, but it presented beautifully piled on a bed of baby salad greens. We ate it with a crusty boule. To the other cooks: frying is not inherently a bad thing. If your oil is sufficiently hot, the food won't be greasy. Moderation is key; just don't fry too often.

This is really good stuff. I love tartar sauce and this is a really good one. I think it could possibly make frozen fish finger palatable.

I made the recipe for the sauce as written, and served it with the oven fried catfish recipe from this site. I added Cajun seasoning , lemon zest, and grated Parmesan cheese to the breading for that recipe and it was outstanding!

Followed other cooks suggestions. Followed the recipie exactly then baked the fish (cut into large diagonal chunks). The sauce made the dish. YUM!

Rating: 3
Yum, yum, YUM! The tartar sauce is out of this world, and I'm not a tartar sauce fan. I omit the lemon, as I think it makes it too tangy, but follow the rest of the recipe faithfully. I oven "fried" the catfish at 400 degrees, but it took about 20 minutes to get it crispy enough for my taste. Worth the effort, though - spouse raved, and he doesn't, often. A definite keeper.

I made this with "catfish nuggets" (cheap!) on sale at the market. I have enough tartar sauce left over for at least one more meal. It was very good, but seemed to take a long time, maybe because my little nuggets were smaller than slices of fillet... Then again, I rarely accomplish a recipe in anything like the time suggested. By the way, I used Paul Prudhomme's Seafood Magic for the cajun spice. Good stuff!

I followed the suggestion of the cook from Philly and baked the fish. The tenders were crunchy and tasty without the grease. As noted by others, the tartar sauce made the recipe.

I usually don't rate recipes because I alter them too much to give a fair review(I altered the catfish in this recipe as well), but I followed the recipe for the tartar sauce almost excactly(little more horseradish) and it was OUTSTANDING! My boyfriend commented that it was weird to even notice the tartar sauce, usually it all tastes the same, but this was incredably good! I'll be using this sauce every time I need tartar.

This tartar sauce is the best I've ever tasted. I didn't use one of the spice brands suggested. I used a really cheap brand I picked up at the $ store and I still got great results both times I've made this dish (from my dad and my boyfriend).

This dish was so yummy!! It not only tasted good, but was easy too! My boyfriend who had just taken a trip to Memphis had some fried catfish tenders and tartar sauce and said it was his favorite dish but said these were a even better, and the tartar sauce was soo good!! I'll be making this dish again and again!

Delicious! Actually, only made the catfish, but in a lower fat version. Followed the recipe exactly, but kept the fish in fillets and baked in 450 degree oven on greased baking sheet for 12 minutes. Surprisingly moist, crispy and flavorful! Did not need any sauce at all. Try it - you won't be disappointed!

We were having a "cajun" dinner night with some friends and I made this dish. It was excellent. The catfish was great and I think this is the best homemade tartar sauce I have ever had. It got rave reviews from my husband and our friends. I will definitely use this recipe regularly for catfish and the tartar sauce is now my staple homemade recipe.

The tartar sauce is exceptionally good for those who like spicy food. "It's hot," my husband commented. The horseradish raises ordinary tartar sauce to a new level. Beware, though. The tartar sauce recipe makes a huge amount. I made half of it and still had lots left over. I'd suggest making a fourth. I served the catfish as an entree and agree the recipe serves 2 persons as an entree if they have big appetites. Otherwise it would serve 3. I took another cook's advice and tossed the catfish in hot sauce rather than putting it in the egg mixture. I used 2 egg whites instead of a whole egg (good way to use stray egg whites) and cooked in a cast iron skillet with just enough oil to cover the fish when the tenders were dropped in. I served it with a tossed salad, Lynn's Paradise Cafe Old-Fashioned Macaroni and Cheese from the Louisville Courier-Journal website (a wonderful rendition) and brussel sprouts. Not low carb or lowfat but Yum! Yum!

For those who said it took too long, or you spent too much time on the fish... what were you doing? Took me 3 min to slice the fillets and put them in the egg mixture.I have to admit, I like mine VERY spicy so I soaked the fish in tobasco first, then proceeded with the recipe as written. I've eaten a lot of catfish in my time (southern born, southern raised, southern live) and this was very good.

Very tasty indeed. For a lower-fat version I dredged the catfish in panko crumbs and baked them- they were crispy, like fried, with fewer calories. But corn meal and catfish are inseparable allies, so I served it with polenta and greens. Don't waste your money on store bought "Cajun spice." Blend your own- lots of good recipes out there. I'll gladly email you my recipe if you need one. Mostly they are just cayenne, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and sugar.

Actually, I only made the sause. I had it with a crab puff recipie ( http://food.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=100928 ) and it worked out perfectly.

I made this for myself and very picky family, substituting boneless skinless breast strips for some of the catfish (for those who don't like fish). The fish was amazing, the chicken came out really good, and I was really glad I had cut the sauce recipe in half (we still had lots left). This dish is really flexible (you can make it as hot or mild as you like), and I've already made it again.

My Dad is from the south - I grew up on catfish. This is a great recipe and the best tartar sauce ever. I panfried the catfish too - it's a southern thing.

I was worried about homemade tarter sauce, but it was amazing. My friends raved about it (one said he had never tasted good tarter sauce before that). The fish was excellent, but next time I will have to make it just a bit spicier. Overall, a wonderful dish.

Forget the catfish, this is a great tartar sauce recipe. And everyone is right, cut the recipe in half. For those that don't, try freezing the leftover sauce. Sometimes it works. :>

This took me way longer than 30 minutes to make! It was very good though and my fiance loved it. I didn't have any horseradish for the tartar sauce, I think it would've made a huge difference. I pan fried the catfish strips.... I'd make this again and next time try a different fish just for variety.

This is a delicious recipe if you enjoy spicy foods. You can, of course, control the degree of heat by the amount of pepper sauce, cajun spice, and horseradish you use. But the amounts recommended for a very tasty dish. I used flounder fillets as they are easier to find fresh in New Hampshire than catfish. I also kept them whole and pan fried them. I used Penzey's Northwoods Fire as my spice powder. The recipe results in a lot of tartar sauce but it is delicious as a dip for crackers or snack sticks.

Delicious and easy! I agree that the tartar sauce could be halved and still be fine. I also pan-fried mine to save on the oil and had no problems with it.

This tarter sauce is not for the faint of heart, but is outstanding. You can easily 1/2 the recipe and it will be plenty for the fish. I pan fried the fish as I hate the waste of all that oil and it was delicious. Will definetly make this again.

This is the best tartar sauce I've had. I made half the recipe as written, but then used about 1 tablespoon less sweet pickle relish than called for. I didn't make fish fingers, but breaded and fried the fillets (2 large ones) in the usual fashion. The leftover tartar sauce should be very good as a dip for steamed shrimp.

Great recipe, right down my sons taste buds. I will be making it for him when he and his wife come home the next time to see us. Also I agree, it is important to support the ads because they are the ones who give us the free recipes, and to me it is just as easy to send for a product than to buy all the other spices just to make my own spice, I buy from only those who I can trust and rely on.

Very good, in fact, delicious!! I used red snapper, a mild fish that works well with this recipe. By the way, I tried the pop-upstopper.com, but the site comes up without any way of stopping the pop-ups. Any suggestions? I, too, HATE those miserable things. Guess I'll just go eat some more cajun fish....

I cheated a little to cut the prep time down. I didn't use the flour-cornmeal mixture. I had my own seafood breading that can only be purchased in the southern states, and added the cajun seasoning. I also used fresh catfish nuggets. I cut back on the frying oil -- it seemed too much for only 1.25 lbs of fish. I will definetly make this again and again.

You can get rid of "pop-ups" (they seem to happed every where these days), by installing a program called "pop-up Stopper". I believe you can download it free fron the net.
