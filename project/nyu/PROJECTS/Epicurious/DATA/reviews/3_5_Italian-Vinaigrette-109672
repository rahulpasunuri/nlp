Simple, tasty, but nothing SPECTACULAR. Make sure to use good quality extra-virgin olive oil. It is definitely going into my repertoire for times when I need to dash off a vinaigrette for a side salad. This gets 4 forks because the proportions of each ingredient are perfect.

Very easy recipe. For a change, add 1 T Dijon mustard.

This is a very correct, traditional Italian vinaigrette. I lost the recipe that my Italian friend gave me years ago, and this is it. It's fresh, simple and perfect for a basic green salad.

Fresh-tasting, just the right amount of flavor for delicate greens, and so-o-o easy! I can have this made almost by the time I open a bottle.
