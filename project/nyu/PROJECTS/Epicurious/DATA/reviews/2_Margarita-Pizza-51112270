What I don't understand is why, if you have your grill already on, and up to heat, you would finish cooking this in the oven? Pizza is made very easily on the grill and tastes delicious, no need to turn on the oven at all.

In the recipe there is a link to a recipe for pizza dough. And the sauce contains garlic.

Cooked tomato sauce, on a pizza? Blasphemy!

So the remarks are a good dough and a good sauce, but you don't offer the recipe for those. Also Jeff below is right if you are going to make it original at least spell the name right.

And it ain't Italian without garlic!

This is my favorite pizza. I'm sure this version is delicious and am not hung up on Italian pizza societies, but you have to get the name right. Pizza Margherita was named after the queen of Savoy. A Margarita is a Mexican tequila drink.

There is actually an Italian pizza society that sets official standards for the Margharita pizza. They insist on a stretched crust (though rolling actually produces a better and more consistent result- it's tradition), but I don't think this rather odd cooking method would make the cut. That's too much tomato sauce- I suppose that's why the odd cooking method and added olive oil. To me, it ain't pizza without tomatoes.
