love this recipe; it's been on our Passover table for several years now. if i could rate it with the changes i've made, i'd have given it 4 stars! instead of white sugar, i use agave syrup. i substitute cayenne for the black pepper and add cumin and powdered ginger. delicious!

i am sooo glad i held out for the beautiful baby carrots from whole foods. presumably the bagged pre-cut ones would have worked, but presentation-wise, the real ones are the way to go. this is a very simple recipe with surprisingly tasty and attractive results.

This was an easily made flavorful side dish. The light sweet and sour sauce complimented the flavor of the fresh baby carrots well by not masking their natural essence. I could see this recipe working well with other veggies especially brussel sprouts.

SUPER YUMMY! Very simple recipe. I made some modifications that I think others will enjoy. I followed another reviewers advice for Balsamic... awsome! I also added 1/2 tsp. of Ginger and Garlic paste to the vinegar glaze. This can be the star side dish to ANY meal... especially a roast.

When I saw the time involved, I took a shortcut. I steamed the carrots for approx. 20 min, then stirfryed them in the olive oil 'til they showed slight signs of browning. I then added the vinegar and sugar on lower heat and finished them. They turned out great and it only took 30 min or so.

I used balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar & the dish was wooonderful. Even my vegetable hating husband liked it. I think the trick is to roast at 425 and use the shorter second roasting time. Carrots were caramelized, sweet, tender but retained some texture. The vinegar gave it some bite.

I just bought some fresh, baby carrots from the farmers' market and made this dish last night. I loved it. Though had fewer carrots than the recipe called for, I made and added all the vinegar. Roasting brings out the natural sweetness of the carrots and the vinegar and pepper a wonderful contrasting tartness. Based on the prior comments, if I make the recipe for more than 1 person, I'll double the sauce. Definately will make it for company this summer.

This recipe was simple yet totally blah. Roasting the carrots in salt, pepper, & olive oil was simple enough but go for a tastier, glaze.

I gave these a shot (guessed 350 for the oven temperature, which as we now know from the previous reviewer as well as my overly crunchy carrots was definitely wrong), and they were basically just okay. The flavor wouldn't have changed if they had been cooked properly - only the texture - and I'm sure they would still be unremarkable. I may or may not try them again now that I have the correct temperature, because they do make for an extremely easy side dish, but I'm sure no one who had them the first time is holding their breath for them. I'm certainly not.
