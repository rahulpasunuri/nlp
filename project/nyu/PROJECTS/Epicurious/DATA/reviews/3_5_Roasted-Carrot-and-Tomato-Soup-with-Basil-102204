This soup is very easy to make and so healthy. I liked it better when I didn't puree too much. Also, like others I added more garlic and salt. It's better if you add less milk too. About 1 1/2 C should be fine.

Roasted all the tomatoes I had, cherry and roma, some red onion, lots of carrots, and half a red pepper. Increased garlic to 5 cloves. You need to watch that the garlic doesn't roast too long, it can get dried out. Peeled the pepper after it cooled off some.Blended really well in food processor. Because we are eating healthier, no dairy was added. Turned out so good.

If you add 2 cubes of chicken stock this one would be a winner. LOVE the slow roasted veggies. I don't like the taste of tomatoes and I LOVE this soup!

This recipe was a terrific foundation for just the soup I was craving. This was my first foray into making tomato soup. The carrots give it such a hearty and delicious consistency. I, Like some other reviewers, tweaked it to my taste. I decided not to add any water (it was watery enough from roasting the veggies). I added the basil before I pureed the roasted veggies as well. I also added 2 cubes of chicken boullion and heavy cream instead of milk. Just what the doctor ordered on a snowed-in day!! I'm thrilled with how it turned out!

I made a few adjustments, largely using this as a starting point. Used three carrots, one yellow and one orange bell pepper, a red onion and six cloves of garlic. Roasted about 40 minutes in a 400 degree oven, then pureed in the blender with 2 cups of chicken stock. In the meantime, sauteed a little garlic in olive oil and dumped in a can of whole tomatoes with liquid and cooked it down for about a half hour. Pureed this as well, and combined everything in the large soup pot. Yummy, and didn't need a single herb or spice so far--just stirred in some half and half and let it sit so that the flavors could meld. Not a gourmet meal, but a nice fall soup. I'll take it!

This is probably my favorite tomato soup I've ever made! I used additional garlic and tomatoes, all of which were fresh from a friend's organic garden, and I added half of a red bell pepper I roasted along with the rest of the veggies. I also blended the basil with the veggies to give a more consistent texture. I am vegan, so I used soy milk creamer instead of the milk, and I skipped the water to keep the soup thick and hearty. I'll probably use more roasted red bell pepper next time, but otherwise I'd do everything the same.

We made this for a dinner party recently and were thoroughly unimpressed. The flavour really lacked depth - even after some additions post-simmer. Won't be a repeat for me

This was delicious. I did roast the veggies, because I like the roasted flavor, and I doubled the garlic.

Love this recipe. Of course, it is a soup. . .so I made some easy changes. I roasted the tomatoes and carrots and toward the end of the roasting I added SUNDRIED TOMATOES and SCALLIONS. To the soup mixture, I added SOUR CREAM, a spash of BALSALMIC VINEGAR and some HEAVY CREAM. It tasted devine!

After reading the reviews I made some changes to the recipe and it's a real winner - and quicker, too. 1. instead of roasting the veggies, saute the onions in the soup pot. I doubled the garlic and sauteed it with the onions. Simultaneously, saute the chopped carrots on high heat until scorched slightly. Add to onions. 2. I used two 32 oz cans of Muir Glen fire roasted chopped tomatoes (drained, but that was probably unneccesary) 3. Instead of water or stock, I used carrot juice (actually, I accidentally bought carrot-orange juice, but it was still great). 4. Instead of adding milk and basil, I made the basil cream that the Westport, CT cook suggested (from ASPARAGUS SOUP WITH BASIL CREAM recipe). When serving, I drizzled the cream sauce on top. HUGE hit at the party. Will definitely make it again, double the recipe and keep some in the freezer. Hearty, deep flavor and healthy too.

"ounces" in recipes always makes it difficult for me. I guessed on a lot of measurements. One carrot, twice as many tomatoes, something like that. My oven is gross and I didn't want to put something I'd be eating dircetly on there , so I fried all. It was a good soup, but I had added lots of other vegetables...

This soup wasn't spectacular, but was nice and very easy. I used canned diced tomatoes as well, and soy milk and I will make it again.

This recipe seemed very promising so I decided to make it despite the fact that several reviewers said it was nothing special and even bland. I am a vegetarian and love cooking with fresh produce, so this recipe really appealed to me. In the end, I did like the soup, but found that I had to make some alterations to give it more flavor and depth. At the recommendation of numerous others, I used vegetable broth instead of water. I also doubled the garlic and the basil. I had to used canned tomatoes (Muir Glen fire roasted diced) as the winter tomatoes are awful in NYC. When I was finished I gave the soup a generous dose of freshly ground black pepper, and added 2 T. fresh dill along with 2 T. balsamic vinegar. The changes greatly improved upon the recipe and left me with a delicious soup. In addition to the above alterations, I would finely chop the fresh basil next time...as is, it ends up clumping up in the soup and interfering with the texture, which is lovely otherwise.

This soup is really good. I took the advice of the other reviews and used vegetable broth (Minor's) and a little extra garlic. Also, at the moment plumb tomatos are $4 a pound in NY and they're awful so I used a good 28oz can and let it cook for about 30 minutes. It came out fine.

i was encouraged to try this soup because of the review given by the woman from germany. and while it is good, somewhere in the archives of gourmet magazine from the 1990's is a SPECTACULAR recipe for tomato ZUPPEN that was in an article about a small town in germany. to my horror i have LOST it. it was a simple recipe and some ingredients were of course tomato canned actually , bacon, and the surprise ingredient ketchup. it was THE BEST. oh if i could ever have THAT recipe again i would be so happy

This receipe was very easy to make. It was delicious and even finicky eaters in my family liked it. The natural sweetness of the vegetables along with the robust flavor from roasting and seasonings make this a full bodied soup. It easily makes a meal.

For a much better soup (five forks!), try the Barley and Roasted Vegetable soup from Bon Appetit, Feb 2003. Just leave out the barley. This soup is also better for the lactost intolerant.

I would agree with other raters that as listed this recipe is a little bland. I agree that using chicken broth and garlic help with the taste. One other technique that helped was to brown the carrots, onions and garlic in a saute pan before roasting in the oven. This adds some depth to the flavor and keeps the tomatoes from being overcooked when you roast the vegatables.

Well, for some reason I thought this was going to be really great; I guess because i love roasted veggies and i love soup... but overall, I'd have to say ehhhh. It was ok but not great. However, I do think it's worth tweaking because - as I said - I like the idea of it. So I think I'll play around with it and see what happens. Needs some snap or something. We'll see. Give it a try, by all means and post it if you come up with something better!

We really enjoyed this soup. I used non-fat milk which worked well. The leftovers were eaten the next day and tasted even better. Will definitely make again.

I thought this soup was pretty good. I used low-sodium chicken broth (cannned) instead of water and I used 7 cloves of garlic. I used 2% milk to thin it out. I also pureed the basil with the veggies, as a previous reviewer suggested. Will definately make again.

Make this a four fork dish by putting the basil in a cream sauce (see ASPARAGUS SOUP WITH BASIL CREAM) and drizzling on top just before serving. Fun colors, dynamite flavor!

This soup is absolutely delicious! We made these modifications: olive oil for roasting veggies, 8-10 cloves garlic (why not?), veggie stock, and heavy whipping cream. We would puree the basil with the veggies next time around. The basil strips interferred with the smooth, creamy texture.

I really liked this soup! Went with a few of the suggestions below, and feel like I've found a favorite new autumn recipe. The balance of tasty and healthy is perfect.

This is the basis of a very good soup, but needs some modifications. Brush vegetables with oil rather than non-stick spray...add a bit more garlic and use chicken stock rather than water. Also a chiffonade of basil as a garnish is critical.

This soup was very tasty. I used a large sweet onion, 4 cloves garlic instead of 2, and substituted a combination of garlic broth (recipe on this site), chicken broth and beef broth for the water. I also used half and half and low fat evaporated milk instead of the low-fat milk. It was impossible to roast so many vegetables in a single layer so I mixed them all up. The smell of them roasting was heavenly. The soup was tasty, but missing that special something. The basil I bought was pretty bland, so maybe that was it. In any case, the soup itself is definitely not bland.

I modified it by using only 1 carrot and substituting parsnips for the remainder. It was great with chicken broth and two cups parve whipping cream.

We substituted 1/2 and 1/2 for the milk and used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. It was delicious and a perfect lunch for a blustery autumn day. We would increase the garlic and basil next time.

I made this twice. The second time,to increase the flavour I roasted the tomatoes separate from the other ingredients,this allowed them to reduce their liquid content and the soup was much more full bodies. i added half a cup of low fat evaporated milk and this made the soup creamy without adding fat.

Waddaya mean, "disgusting"? Learn to cook, once! This soup was very good, but of course with a few changes . . . I did use chicken stock instead of water, and upped the pepper (a very good suggestion). I didn't add any dairy at all, but I think it would have made it richer and more delicious . . . I'm watching the fat. I love it cold, too!

Definitely add broth instead of water (thanks for that tip!) and garlic. I didn't add milk or half and half since it was a wonderful texture already. I added ALOT of pepper, which really made all the difference.

I loved this recipe! I made it with veggie stock instead of the water and "upped" the tomatoes to 2 1/2 lbs. and the carrots to 1 1/2 lbs. - I also added more garlic and a yellow bell pepper. It made this soup outstanding! Definely would make it again!

Of course it's bland, sillies. Someone left out all the fat! Substitute some of that yucky low-fat milk for a healthy (ok, unhealty) dose of light cream. The flavor really IS in the fat.

We agree, it was bland the first time (two forks). So the second time we used chicken broth, some red wine, and dried basil instead of fresh and it the soup had much more depth. Both times we used 1% milk. Cheers!

Loved this, but after seeing the review that stated it was bland, I knew it had potential! So instead of adding water to puree and pan, I used chicken broth. I also added a hearty dash of Lemon Pepper for some zip. I actually used skim milk and it turned out great!!!

This is one of those recipes that sound a lot better than they taste! As shown, there was little to no flavor. Even after "doctoring it up", it stll was only so so.
