My new favorite soup after juicing it up a bit. I added 3 chicken boullion cubes, tripled the curry powder and used 9 ounces of spinach instead of 4 and it's probably the best soup I've ever made. Very comforting on a cold evening. I even ate it for breakfast! I also used full-fat homemade yogurt.

i agree with the other reviewers. substitute chicken broth for water, use at least 2.5 tsps of high quality curry powder. also, i only used one cup of milk instead of 2. next time i think i'll use 1/2 or 3/4 cup of half and half.

I'm not rating this, because I tinkered with it extensively. As per the suggestions in the reviews, I used chicken broth instead of water, tripled the curry powder, and added garam masala. I also added a clove of garlic, some fresh diced ginger, and the juice of a lime. The biggest change I made was the addition of some firm tofu, cubed and drained, after I pureed the soup. The result was very good -- like a lower-calorie, more liquid version of saag paneer, with an appealing bright, sprightly flavor. If the recipe had been written with the changes I made, I'd be giving it four forks. Also it is very good for you.

Easy to make. I followed some suggestions from other cooks and added more curry powder, some cayenne and some coriander. After I blended - the spices really came out! A bit too much for me but everyone else liked it. (Or at least said they did!)

I found this recipe to be a bit tasteless. I used chicken broth so I can only imagine how it would have been if done with water. Not something I will make again.

A 4 with several modifications. I used a fresh chicken broth to which I added some fresh ginger and the greens of my leaks (well washed). I added some chili powder and garam masala when simmering the final product...Then I garnished with the no fat yogurt, some chopped ciantro, some more garam masala...and a squeeze of fresh lime. That's how it became a 4!!!

I chose this recipe because it was so healthy, but was pleasantly surprised to find it very tasty as well. I used nonfat milk (1 cup) and a splash of fat free half and half - didn't have 2% on hand.

I found this soup to be watery, bland, and lacking in dimension. It needed alot of doctoring, such as the addition of chicken broth, ALOT more curry, and some onion powder. To be fair, my husband and brother liked it and had seconds. It might be better prepared with chicken broth instead of water.

Delicious, and a definite repeat. Keeps well too. Minor adjustments - instead of 2 1/2 cups of water I used 1 cup of water and 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth, 2% milk worked fine and so did a Yukon gold potato.

I'd use a little less salt

I served this at a dinner party and everyone asked for the recipe. I did make a few changes though. I added 1 vegetable boullion cube to the water, used 2% milk, and added some cayenne pepper and a little more fresh ground black pepper. I also used the entire 6 oz bag of spinach and it was very good.

I found I could be very liberal with the curry powder - recipe lists a minimal amount. Also, be careful not to over-blend. I pureed mine too much and it had a very watery consistency.

This soup is very easy to make and was so good that everyone who had it asked for more AND asked for the recipe. My one comment is that I thought it lacked a little zip (perhaps my curry was a touch old.) I added a little Cayenne Pepper and some tumeric to spice it up a touch. Also salt and lots of fresh ground black pepper.
