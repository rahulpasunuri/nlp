Great recipe. I'm not a huge peanut butter fan, but the family wanted a Christmas cookie option besides our traditional butter & sugar cookies. Cookies were really easy to make (we had a hand mixer, not a stand mixer & dough turned out fine). They tasted great--not too sweet and really nice balance in the peanut butter & other ingredients. I'm adding this to my recipe box for future cookie making adventures. Yum!

Love this recipe! Using it as my peanut butter cookie recipe now. Even though I prefer natural peanut butter, I used JIFF for this recipe based on others saying to avoid natural peanut butter. Served them at a party and got many complements on them specifically. Can't say enough!

I made these exactly as the recipe says - they are delicious. I put mini Reeses cups instead of the kisses and they melted just enough to make the cookies even more divine!

Delicious, super easy recipe! I have made these cookies several time and they could not be easier! My friends love them and they seem to disappear immediately. I did not have kisses so I made them using dark chocolate chips, came out amazing.

These cookies were quite good. I liked the addition of almond extract. They were best right from the oven when soft with the kisses all melty. The only reason I didn't give the recipe four forks is because they were quite crispy when cool (as most butter based cookies are) and I prefer the softer texture of the traditional recipe.

very good. they ended up a bit flatter than i expected, but the flavor was perfect. these were very popular in the cookie tin.

Finally, the recipe I've been looking for! Other recipes were too dense and greasy, this one is crispy and light, just enough peanut butter flavor! Didn't change a thing.

A really delicious cookie, but too subtle of a peanut butter flavor. Next time I will add more Peanut butter and that is the only reason I didn't give it 4 stars. We like ours slightly chewy (aka a bit underdone...LOL) and this recipe allowed that to work beautifully.

Made these last night. I'm usually not a big fan of peanut butter cookies, but these are amazing.Sooo yummy! They're even better with dark chocolate kisses on them!

The best peanut butter kiss cookie recipe I have found. I like to substitute the kisses for small Reese's peanut butter cups!!

I make this type of cookie annually but wanted something other than the usual Crisco base. I tried this one and the improvement is amazing. I will stick to this recipe from now on.

I just made these cookies, after hesitating for a moment since there were so few reviews. I followed the directions exactly, but rolled them into 110 bite-size cookies instead! They baked for 6:45, and are going to make adorable gifts tomorrow. Thanks so much!

Made these as part of this years Christmas Cookie-a-thon and they were fabulous! Easy to make, they look like they'll be too wet to roll into balls, but it worked out fine. They are easy, quick and taste great! Good chew and peanut butter flavor, without being overpowering and the crunchy outside adds just the right touch. I used brachs milk chocolate stars in place of kisses.
