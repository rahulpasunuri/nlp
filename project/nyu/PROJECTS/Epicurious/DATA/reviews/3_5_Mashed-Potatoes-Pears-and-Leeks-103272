Planning on making this tomorrow but wanted to comment on the criticisms of margarine versus butter, and that it needed milk/cream--this was published as part of a Passover menu that included meat, and so avoided dairy in order to be kosher. Hope it turns out great!

This recipe was recommended to me by a friend several years ago. We love it so much it has become a regular on our Thanksgiving menu.

I thought this was going to be out of this world, and it was just so-so. It ended up tasting like slightly sweeter mashed potatoes, with a bit of greenery thrown in. OK, but certainly nothing to brag about.

Absolutely Delicious. I boiled the potatoes and pears instead of steaming them - quicker and easier. Otherwise I didn't change a thing and they were a big hit. Will definitely make again

The flavors in this recipe were delicate and even, perfect for a side dish. I used D'Anjou pears, which gave a slight grit to the texture, and I also added milk. The result was fantastic and very well received by my guests.

I loved the combination of potatoes, pears, and leeks! This dish was a nice diversion from normal mashed potatoes and leeks always add a nice flavor.

I'm surprised at the low ratings for this dish. I cam across it in one of my Bon Appetit cookbooks last winter...my husband and I both love it. I do agree it is easier to simmer potatoes and pears instead of steaming, that is a bit of work. Be sure to do separately though, as they have different cooking times...

I 'd give this a 2 1/2 forks. This was tasty, but there are better mashed potato recipes. It is a little too bland for the effort.If you do make it, heed an earlier suggestion, and cut down on the amount of butter.

This is simply a variation on a very old German classic called Himmel und Erde (Heaven and Earth - potatoes from the Earth, apples from the sky). The method of steaming the potatoes is way too complicated - simply simmer them and the fruit together until tender. I did not like it with pears and wouldn't make it this way again - it was too sweat with pears. Also I've never heard of it being a main course. It's a side dish like mashed potatoes. Instead of pears, use cooking apples, such as a granny smith. I would NEVER use margarine, only REAL butter. Add a little cream if the mashed mixture is too stiff. Sometime diced & fried bacon is added at the last moment, the leaks are also optional, and it's usually served with fried sausages, such as Bockwurst, Blutwurst or Knackwurst, or fried meats such as veal or pork chops. It's eaten like we eat plain old mashed potatoes - butter (or gravy) a little salt & pepper to taste.

The pears may sound odd in a potato dish but the combination is fantastic. Very easy to prepare. I like that this recipe can be made ahead. I also did not use all of the margarine called for - it wasn't necessary as the potatoes were creamy enough. I seved this with stuffed veal chops! The glass baking dish is for the potatoes after they are mashed.

A question. What do you do with the glass baking dish? I don't see any instruction as to what to do with this dish after brushing it with the margarine.

This recipe, while somewhat time consuming,is well worth the effort. As written, it yields a ton of mashed potatoes that are so very rich and because I substituted a smaller amt of marg., much lower in fat!! A wonderful compliment to roasted leg of lamb. Wonderful.
