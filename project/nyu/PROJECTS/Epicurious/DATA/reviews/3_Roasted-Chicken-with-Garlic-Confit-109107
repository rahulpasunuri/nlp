YUMMY...very delicious and moist! This has become one of my "go to" dishes. This a fairly simple yet elegant dish, especially when served with parmesan & black pepper polenta side dish that was part of the original magazine recipe. It's great for easy & economical entertaining, as well as a quick anytime meal.

This was pretty good and very easy. I agree with earlier comments that it needs a little garlic spread under the skin. I used all dark meat pieces and they came out nice and crispy.

Great roasted garlic flavor. Chicken was moist and the skin was crisp. Make it, it's worth the effort.

If you like garlic, and do not want to spend an arm and a leg on a dinner that is good enough for company, try this. Absolutely delicious. It is easy enough to make on a weeknight. The secret to this recipe, is the heat. You can not be afraid to turn up your oven, meat cooks thorougly and does not dry out!

I thought it was a lot of work for not much flavor. It's a lot easier and tastier to just do the 40 cloves of garlic method. We were not impressed.

I agree with the cook from Australia, it needed something under the skin. However, am willing to try again. I do like having the garlic oil around, comes in handy.

Easy recipe ... a change I would make next time would be to put a clove of garlic under each chicken piece as it cooked ... the recipe meant all the flavour was just on the top of the skin, not through the chicken. Nice, easy, weeknight meal ... not something to impress!
