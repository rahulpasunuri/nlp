I can only review the farro risotto, which was great. I cooked it in less time and with less liquid than recipe calls for, and it was nutty with a good bite - which is how farro should be cooked, imo. I also added mushrooms. It was delicious, and a hearty meal on its own.

Why would you cook the farro twice? It should be al dente, not runny and mushy...I would simply finish it in the pan with a bit of stock and the cooked onions, not proceed to cook it for another 20 minutes.

I found this recipe quite complicated, especially the confit. I would make it again but quite differently and simplified. It pared very well with Cotie Rotie.

We loved it! After the first time preparing this dish, I started to play around with it. I start on a Friday evening for a Saturday dinner party. I now use the Port-Garlic Sauce in another epicurious duck recipe and cook the confit for closer to three hours. I make a roasted garlic risotto to accompany. The garlic in both the sauce and risotto is mild, so the flavor is not overwhelming. I started out making this for special occasions, but have found after making it a few times, it is not at all difficult, just time consuming. Time spent is well worth it when you see the look on your guests faces. I am asked for the recipe every time I make it. The next time I make this dish, I am going to try cooking the legs in a crock-pot and see how that works.

Yep, this is a great dish. Not for beginners though. We made it twice, once for practice and again for real. The first time we overcooked the breast. Shoot for medium rare, just like a steak (which it resembles). Our New Year's Eve guests were amazed by the dish. Highly recommended, if you have the experience and the time.

This recipe was by far the best duck breast recipe I have tried. My fiance refuses to order duck whenever we go out because this is his all-time favourite. The confit, however, I found was a bit underdone given the allotted cooking time. I would definitely leave it in about 1/2hr longer. It was quite pink still when I removed it and the meat was not tender enough to "fall off the bone". I have never liked risotto and like the others I've tried, this one also disappointed. Could just be that I don't like that type of dish. Give it a try, especially the breast and you won't be disappointed.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner and I must admit - it is complicated in several spots and the recipe needs to be made more clear. The outcome was wonderful and everyone loved it. We substituted a standard risotto (Ferraro) that turned out quite well. I would strongly suggest that you try this once to work out the details before trying it with company!

Since I don't get to Le Cirque too often :) I thought I'd give this a try. Allow me to preface my review with my own credentials as an experienced cook who takes great pleasure in serving multiple courses to up to 24 people at my table(s). I have received boatloads of kind compliments on my dinners over the years. However, I was unprepared for the reaction of my guests to this recipe. I have to tell you, they were swooning and melting, falling out of their chairs, moaning with pleasure, uttering prayers of thanks to the food gods over this one. After reading over the recipe several times, I realized it could be broken down into simple stages, beginning two days ahead (a feature I always seek when planning big dinners). In my opinion, this is the greatest recipe I've ever prepared, owing to its do-aheadability as well as its impact as the best entree we've ever eaten, bar none, including meals at fine restaurants. So don't be daunted by the instructions. Divide and conquer. And try not to bump your head on the table during your swoon.
