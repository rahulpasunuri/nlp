I followed this recipe but did not have time for the freezing, so I used the delicious lemon cream to top my homemade cake and then spooned the blackberry syrup I had made on top of the cream. Got raves from my guests!

Simple and refreshing. A unique alternative when you are looking for something other than chocolate. I agree with other reviewers that 180ºF is way too high. Four to five minutes over the hot water bath is sufficient. I have made this with both meyer and regular lemons, and I have used up to double the amount of whipping cream with great success. I think oranges would be fun to try, too--it would be something like a dreamsicle! I substitute whatever berries I have on hand.

I made this for my book group luncheon, and even the people on the South Beach Diet came back for seconds! 3 changes that make this recipe simpler and 1/2 the fat: 1. take the egg whites from the yolks you use and beat them until they stand up in peaks. Cut the cream in half. Fold the egg whites in with the cream, followed by the custard mixture. 2. DO NOT cook the custard attempting to get it to 180. This made it too thick and curdled, as others have commented. Cook it until it's thickened, more like the texture of whipped cream. More like 6 minutes, and it cools very fast once put into the ice water. 3. For the sauce, I bought one package of fresh blackberries, pureed half of them with sugar, added the other half and pulsed it so there were chunks of berries. Then I stirred in several tablespoons of raspberry jam. Doubled the sauce and made it just the right sweetness. Next time I'm going to try adding pomegranate molasses.

Wonderful flavor, just the right balance of sweet and tart. I love lemon and blackberries, so this was perfect for me! Not too heavy after a big meal. I did use Meyer lemons, and had no trouble finding them--I think this is the right time of year for them. They added a floral character to the flavor that was interesting. My only complaint is that it took a lot longer than 3 minutes for my yolk mixture to be thick and fluffy and 180 degrees, almost 15 minutes.

Would definitely make this again. My only comment would be to decrease the sugar just a bit, as I found it too sweet. Great choice after a rich meal!

This was good, but could not find meyer lemons. Used half lemon juice and half tangerine juice instead. Careful with making the custard. 180 degrees is too warm, as it all globbed together. Next time I make this, I will pretend I am making ice cream.

Sadly, I could not find any Meyer lemons despite trying a bunch of shops. I ended up making this with blood oranges instead. I decreased the sugar just a tad although I basically forgot about doing that until after I had dumped most of it in. This turned out great. It was super easy (I didn't use the thermometer, just waited until it was thick and fluffy as described. I cannot wait to find Meyer lemons and try it again!

Made this wonderful dessert for a dinner party. It turned out more like a semifreddo, not quite frozen even after 8 hours. I added a little more sugar to the whipped cream and also added some black currant syrup to the berries. Everyone raved over it. Great dessert for a warm evening...

Wonderfully tart dessert and easy to make. We'll definitely make this again.
