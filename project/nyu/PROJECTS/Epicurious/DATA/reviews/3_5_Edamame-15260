Now, this doesn't really qualify as a recipe, does it? At any rate, you might enjoy these edamame with the sauce from "GRILLED ARTICHOKES WITH SESAME DIPPING SAUCE", or "TEA-MARBLED EGGS WITH SOY BALSAMIC MAYONNAISE".

I eat these as a snack at work. Just put some (still frozen, if that's how you buy them) in a heat-resistant glass container with a lid. When you feel like eating them, fill the container with boiling water from a kettle. Let them sit for a couple of minutes , drain them, salt them and eat them. I keep a bag of coarse salt in my desk just for that purpose.

I do eat a whole bag of these by myself (instead of, not in addition to dinner) without any guilt. They are delicious. And the coarse sea salt is perfect! I used to open them to eat, but that's too much work. If you use your teeth beginning at the bottom of the little bean and just rake up, voila. No work, and you don't even have to pay attention. Perfect for when you are alone and reading a good book.

Delicous and nutritious, low-carb snack. I can eat an entire bag of these myself as a meal. I buy mine frozen at Trader Joe's and keep two bags in my freezer at all times. I agree with a previous reviewer, they are addicting -- not that there is anything wrong with that! :)

Unbelievably easy, and a great nutritious snack. These are so addictive, my husband and I can easily go through half a bag ourselves as an appetizer, and it's so much cheaper to fix it yourself than pay restaurant prices for a small bowl. I also don't bother dunking the edamame in ice water after cooking, because I like them warm.

I love these. Looking for a good source to buy the beans in bulk... Any mail order/internet sources?

I prefer to steam the pods or microwave them, that way you cook away less of the nutrients. I don't ever put them in cold water before serving. My kids LOVE these. I brought them to our kindergarten class during nutrition week and out of 19 kids only 2 didn't like it, the rest kept asking for more 'till it was gone! And I consider kindergarteners picky eaters! If they like it, it must be good, right?

Something you have to watch with edamame is overcooking them. After experimentation, cooking the frozen ones just requires bringing them to a boil and then submerging in ice water. Otherwise, I found that they popped out of the pods and were too well done. Great as a snack too - and much better for you than potato chips.

This is the best snack food in the world!! I have to make at least a batch or two of these a week and still can't keep up with the demand. Not only do adults love these, but kids do as well! My 10 year old daughter and her (sometimes very picky) friends can finish off a batch in no time! I certainly don't bother trimming the ends after cooking. They are so simple to just pop the peas out of the pods into your mouth anyway. I've tried the "pre-shelled" edamame, but don't like those nearly as much. Guess the shelling of these delightful little treats are just part of the fun!!

Tastes great and good for you. This is a staple in our home.

This was one of my favorite foods in Japan! I love the recipe. My dog loves it, too. She and I were sharing the beans.

I have found my new snack food. Edamame is loaded with protein and fiber, and this is surprisingly good. It's quite addictive. (Falls under the "Try It; You'll Like It" category. A great starter to any Japanese menu.
