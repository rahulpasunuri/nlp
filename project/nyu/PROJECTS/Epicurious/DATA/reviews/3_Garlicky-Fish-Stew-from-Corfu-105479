Loved this! Added some leafy greens to up the nutritional value and enjoyed it even more the next day.

I think the point of this dish is its simplicity, and having seen it prepared on Rick Stein's cooking show by a local Corfu-an, I decided not to "improve" it by adding a bunch of new ingredients. I stuck to the recipe and the result was a delicious, simple Greek fish stew! Will be making it again.

I did a modified half recipe: 3 tbls butter, 1 tbls olive oil, 1 onion and 4 garlic cloves. I used 1 potato AND 2 cups of bok choy chopped. I added the wine, about 1 cup and used 1 pound of cod. Did the juice of whole lemon and about 4 tbls of chopped fresh parsley. It was very good and I would make it again. Not bland like the exact recipe reviews mentioned - but I'm never good at following a recipe exactly.

My gluten free, dairy free version was something like this: olive oil; 2 dried chili peppers; 3 large garlic cloves; 1 leek; 1/2 onion; 3/4 lb wild salmon; 1 1/2 red bell pepper; water to cover; 1 lb shrimp with shells. Added the shrimp at the end. Seasoned with salt and pepper. Garnished with flat leafed parsley.

Ok, My changes are as follows: I added leeks to the onions and garlic. Used two types of potatoes, russet and yukon gold. To the potatoes sauté mix after adding the water/wine mixture, I added a spice packet of bay leaf, 1 teaspoon fine herbs and 1 teaspoon savory. I then dropped in two dried long peppercorns. Once the potatoes where half done I use three types of fish salmon, red snapper and a fish I found in an Asian market. Once the fish was almost done I took out about 1/2 cup of the broth added three tablespoons of white rice flour. I really wanted to keep this soup white even though one of the types of fish I used was salmon. Once the soup thickened up I added a tablespoon of dried garlic and the lemon juice. I know some of the responders added saffron although it would have added the additional taste it would also make the soup yellow.

I also added saffron and thyme, as well as a leek. Excellent basic fish stew.

A few changes in preparation will improve the dish substantially: 1.together with the potatoes, add a spoonful of cored & cubed green olives plus some previously soaked saffron threads and enough water to cover the potatoes by app. two thirds. 2. After cleaning the fish, put some salt and lemon juice inside plus a sprig of thyme or laurel leaf. 3. Put fish on top of potatoes after 10 minutes and let them get steamed by the evaporating water. At once a frugal and refined dinner.

This was very easy and quick to make and it was delicious. I used chicken broth instead of water, and for the fish I used tilapia. Someone thought the lemon did not go with this, so I left it out. It is on the plain side, but not bland. I really liked the basic fish stew that it is. I will add this to my regular week-day meal rotation.

i found that fish stock and white wine add that extra something, when used instead of water. enjoyable and easy

Previous reviewers are right--this recipe needs a little something. I found that for me adding a few strands of saafron works. Also, could substitute some parsnips for half the potatoes.

This needed something more.. not sure what. there was something unpleasant about the lemon with this fish. Whiting tastes better in the New England Fish cakes recipe.

I made this recipe using a mixture of fish I purchased at my fishmonger's. I also made it to serve two. A nice taste of garlic, but not much else. Simple to make, I added 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes to liven it up a bit. It needs something more, not sure what.

This is a simple tasty fish stew which is very easy to make. It's so simple that I almost want to add something else to it, and will probably experiment a little to see what might work well. Make sure you have some good bread to go with this as I didn't and maybe why I wanted to look for something else to add. I love when a simple combination of ingredients makes a nice meal, and this recipe fits the bill. Not a smashing success, but good enough to want to make again.

I was at the beach looking for a relatively simple recipe to feed the crowd. I couldn't find either mullet or whiting and ended up trying stiped bass (excellent), grouper (very good) and flounder (dries out too quickly for this recipe.) Everyone loved it. My only quibble is that it's got more potatoes than most Americans want.

Very tasty indeed ( if you like garlic) My husband demanded a trip to Corfu to try the way the locals cook it!. Don't overcook the fish!

This was absolutely disgusting! It had no taste and I had to throw it away.
