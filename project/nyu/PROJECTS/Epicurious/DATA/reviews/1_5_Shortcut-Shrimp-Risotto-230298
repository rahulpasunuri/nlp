very exceptional. i didn't take the shrimp out of the package and it added a nice plasticy texture.

What is this doing on Epicurious' web site?

I can't believe the site I rely on for wonderful recipes and inspiration would post a recipe of this type. Leave this sort of idiocy to the "Box Queen" on that tv food show. Very disappointing.

Wow, Epicurious, this is hardly a recipe. It belongs on a page with Hamburger Helper tips and Kraft Kitchen ideas. Not what I expect to see on your website.
