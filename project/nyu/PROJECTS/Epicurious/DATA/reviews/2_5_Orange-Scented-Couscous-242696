I followed the recipe as written, then tasted, and modified. It was very, very bland to begin with. I added wayyy more orange juice, parsley, salt and pine nuts. This made it a fine, if not overly memorable side dish for mediterranean-inspired main courses.

For me there is one word to describe this couscous version: AWFUL. We found it dry and tasteless. I didn't halve the recipe like I usually do for just the two of us, and I'm really sorry. I'm going to try to salvage the leftovers by adding hot chicken broth, some currents, and whatever else I can come up with. I hate to throw good food out.

Worked well with my Moroccan chicken dish which has a nice spicy sauce

This is a simple recipe but one that is strikingly good. I used an overly ripe orange and just squished it over the couscous so all the juicy pieces fell out. I agree with the previous review that the couscous did end up a little dry, however, typically when served with a gravy dish it works well to soak up the sauce.

This is a very good recipe and worked well with Chicken, Mushroom, and Bok Choy Kebabs. It required more orange juice at the end for both flavor and moisture. Couscous has a tendency to be too dry.
