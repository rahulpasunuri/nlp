This is a mediocre recipe at best; perhaps good for hiding vegetables if you have children... it would be better to just saute shallots with asparagus and top with parmesian

I "cheated" and used a Boboli crust for a quick weeknight supper. Put the cheese/garlic spread on top rather than in the middle. Added truffle oil at the end. Savory, and ready in just a few minutes!
