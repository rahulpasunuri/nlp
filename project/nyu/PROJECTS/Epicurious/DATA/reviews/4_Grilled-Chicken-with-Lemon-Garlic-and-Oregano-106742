Delicious, and so easy! I have a garden full of herbs, and oregano will be abundant this summer, so I will certainly make this again when I don't have to spend a small fortune for the fresh herb (the way I did yesterday)! As for analogplanet's comment about being the only one to notice that there are no directions for using the "marinade"--it's NOT a marinade! You dip the chicken in it after cooking, and that is clearly stated in the recipe. I did change the recipe to the extent of cooking the garlic in some of the olive oil first, then adding the rest of the ingredients, and served it warm as a bit of sauce. We love lemon chicken, and this was an excellent addition!

This is incredibly easy, fast and very, very good! A keeper. I used dried oregano because we didn't have fresh and it was still terrific. I think this would be good with pork or even fish too.

Excellent - all remarked on how fresh tasting it was. Really allowed the fresh lemon and herbs to shine. My only change: the dressing is very potent, so we used a basting brush to apply it to the chicken and tossed the rest with pasta. An easy meal - we'll definitely make it again!

Am I the only person to notice that nowhere in this recipe does it actually direct you to pour the marinade on the chicken? I think that's a ridiculous omission. Nor does it say for how long you should marinate the chicken before grilling.

I made the recipe with a whole butterflied chicken on the grill, but was surprised by the amount of salt in the vinaigrette. I used 1/2 the salt and thought it was a lot. Next time I will use more lemon and zest with less salt. It was nice with a cold sancerre.

absolute keeper for recipe. easy and very quick to do, espec if you have oregano in the backyard. if you grill it on higher heat to very slightly char the skin, it becomes crispy and the chicken has an excellent grilled flavor. it's a stand-by for my family whenever we have friends over b/c it's so easy and inexpensive.

Unbelievable! Why have I been marinating all of these years when a quick dunk after grilling leaves chicken with incredible flavor while staying moist and tender? I also tried it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts grilled on stove and they were fantastic. Cold leftovers just as good in a salad/wrap.

Dear friends, you must make this and do it simply as written. I imbellish recipes often, however due to reviews, followed as written. I did have to keep checking back to make sure I wasn't missing a step it was so easy, and different than how I normally "do" chicken. First, make the sauce, but DON'T use it as a marinade, just as a finish. Second, grill for specific time, in covered grill, turning only once. Picky chicken eaters, who always grab bbq sauce, complain about dry/undercooked or the like, and prefer their side dish over the main dish - ate all the chicken, skipped the side dish and never once thought about bbq sauce....WINNER!

We made this over spring break and my friends and I loved it! We used Italian parsley instead of oregano since the store didn't have that herb. I can't and don't want to imagine it with anything else but the parsley! This was amazing and easy. I loved not having to brine the chicken first. It was nice to relax and have fun on vacation and leave everything else to the last minute and still have a fabulous meal!

Rating: 4
WONDERFUL and easy! I've marinated chicken in something similiar, but citrus marinades often toughen the meat and it seems like you never taste the freshness of citrus. This recipe solves that! A simple dunk in the dressing adds tons of flavor and brightness. We passed extra dressing on the side. I served with grilled vegi's and found we liked the dressing drizzled over those too! I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts & dried oregano because this was a last minute weeknight family meal and I only had this on hand. I also didn't grill the lemon slices, but I can tell it would be an excellent garnishment and will add this step when I serve for company.

Outstanding! I grilled skinless/boneless breasts, sliced them, arranged on a platter and poured the sauce over. Everyone raved! Fresh oregano and lemon juice are both essential ingredients, IMHO. Don't forget that the S&P measurements are split between separate steps in the recipe.

I highly recommend this recipe, we made it with skin-on chicken legs - if you don't marinate them before the skin turns out so wonderfully tasty. All it needs is the roll-around in the sauce. My fiance LOVED it. I reduced the salt in the sauce and added some honey and siracha to taste, everything else we did per the recipe. We'll definitely make this for company - inexpensive with the legs yet completely impressive looking. Worth grilling lemons just for the garnish aspect - gorgeous.

Rating: 4
DELICIOUS! My entire family loved it including my 1 and 6 year olds. I did not have fresh oregano so I used fresh rosemary and tarragon. I cut the recipe in half and used skinless boneless chicken breasts in addition to using about 1/8 to 1/4 of the salt and it was perfect.

I made this tonight just as written. I am not the best griller but the directions were spot on. I have a gas grill. I didn't grill the lemons. It was 95 degrees but and I didn't want to spend any additional time outside than necessary. I am looking forward to the leftovers and will make this again.

Great recipe!! I made it ezactly as written except that I used chicken thighs. The sauce is outstandingly good and I will definitely make this again; it is exceedingly easy to make. One suggestion: I left the skin on to grill, but then I pulled it off before I dipped the chicken in the sauce. If you leave it on, the yummy sauce can't get down into the chicken. This is a real winner!!!

Rating: 4
This is a perfect recipe: a blend of acid and salt along with the umami of the chicken (WITH skin on!) This is a perfect recipe for a simple yet really delicious meal. It's been raved by guests over and over, so it's become my go-to recipe when we are expecting visitors. Follow the recipe as written, but you can easily lessen salt by 25% and still be salty. Otherwise, it's really just perfect. No tweaking necessary. Other reviewers who've rated this anything less than 4 forks but changed the ingredients, are short-changing the original flavor...and rating.

This was incredible. I didn't really prepare it the way it called for, but the vinaigrette was great on the chicken. It's December here, and a bit too cold to grill today. I pan seared chicken tenderloins and then tossed them in the sauce. I served the chicken on a bed of middle eastern rice with a little more sauce poured over.

I added some paprika to the chicken before grilling. I tried to coat the chicken in the vinaigrette like the recipe suggested but I didn't really like the taste so I dipped the chicken in the sauce and put them back on the grill.It tasted much better! My husband liked it! It was good not delicious but good

This was good but not as spectacular as I had hoped :(. I served it with a side of Israeli Couscous w/garlic and olive oil. I only used bone-in chicken breasts. The best thing about the recipe was that it was easy.

Rating: 3
Great recipe. Easy to make, but a little hard if you're not using the full amount and trying to halve it. I dunked the chicken breasts in the sauce first, then seasoned with salt and pepper, right before putting on the grill. Add a lot of lemon flavor to the chicken. Also squeezed fresh lemon juice on the chicken as it grilled. Served with pene in garlic, olive oil, and parmesean. The pasta picked up some lemon sauce while on the plate with the chicken uniting the plate well.

I thought the oregano might be a little overpowering but I was delightfully surprised with the nice blend of flavors! I confess I did not grill the lemons, and wish I would have. I did use some of the dressing as a marinade for a couple of hours. I enjoyed the charred flavors of it on the grill. My husband is not as impressed with the lemon flavors as I was, but it was a nice and simple change up for the usual grilled chicken. I have oregano growing in the yard and lemons available on my walks through the neighborhood, so it is a simple with readily available ingredients. A Greek salad would round out a nice summer meal with similar flavors. I'll definitely make this again.

I was'nt expecting much from this recipe, but was really surprised. I used boneless, skinless breasts, and used a little of the sauce while grilling, and put more on before serving. My husband even liked it, and he doesn't really like chicken. The sauce would be good over grilled vegetables too.

Rating: 4
Wow - this was great but I did change things a wee bit. I used a whole organic (BC) chicken with the back bone removed. Before cooking, I marinated the chicken in the lemon, garlic and fresh rosemary (all I had) marinade for about an hour and then cooked it in the oven at 500 degrees for 40 minutes. My boyfriend (who likes to eat) said this was the best chicken he has ever eaten. I grilled the lemons which were a great compliment. Served it with ceasar salad and corn on the cob - a great summer evening meal!

I really enjoyed this! It was a great dish off the grill for the summer. I served it w/grilled eggplant and tomatoes. I didn't marinate the chicken first except w/oo s&p. Then I tossed the cooked chicken into the sauce and it was fabulous. Next time I will grill parboiled red potatoes and toss into the sauce as well - it should be delicious!

Great recipe. Make it as it states except not so much salt. I did not have enough fresh garlic so I tried minced garlic from a jar. I made the sauce and tried it. It was terrible. I went back to the store and bought fresh garlic. What a difference. Give it a try. It is wonderful.

Excellent recipe, but as usual, it's best to use it as a guide. As others said, we found it good with some honey added. The salt is very heavy and added too much to the top of the taste, even though I only used half of the suggested amount. Next time, I will use only just under a third. I substituted white pepper for the black and got a better look to my sauce, which can be placed on the table for guests to add more to taste. This works well served with Rapini because of the Italian flavors in the chicken.

I love this recipe! I have made it both on the grill and in the oven and both times it turned out incredibly well.

I was impressed that you can grill chicken with having only seasoned it with kosher salt and pepper then afterwards coating it with the mixture and serving immediately. Great taste !! I was surprised after browning the chicken how well it continued to cook on the perimeter of the grill without the aid of briquets underneath. I now have learned a lesson.

What a wonderful recipe. I just made this for a girls gathering and paired it with a simple green salad; Orzo with Feta, Tomatoes and Dill (also from Epicurious.com); and White Wine and Peach Sangria (also from this site). It was a wonderful menu. I grilled about 20 boneless organic chicken breasts and doubled the dressing. I simply placed the cooked chicken breasts in two large casserole dishes, covered with the dressing and let sit for an hour or so. I then sliced the chicken onto platters and placed the lemon slices on top. Served it all room temp. VERY EASY and delicious. My husband is loving the leftovers.

Took an average of others' opinions/changes: 1/8 cup lemon juice, 1/8 cup lime juice, extra garlic, sauteed in oo first (unless you want to eat chicken tossed in raw garlic at the end), boneless, skinless chicken breasts, a little siracha (chile garlic sauce) for a kick (teaspoon?) a little honey (teaspoon?) grill without all the complicated/confusing info end result: ahhhh-mayzing (and would make any day again) and yes, you should make extra sauce

Great summertime recipe! I doubled the sauce, used 1/2 of it to marinade the chicken. Served the chicken on top of orzo and drizzled remaining sauce over the top. So good! If you like sauce triple the recipe.

Rating: 3
Easy. I didn't follow the directions for the actual gas grill cooking. Sounds like a crazy person was giving those directions. I lit both burners on medium high, started the drumsticks first and cooked for 35 minutes. I started the breasts 10 minutes after I started the drumsticks and cooked for a total of 45 minutes. (I moved the drumsticks to the top rack when I added the breasts.) I wish I had doubled the sauce recipe...there wasn't enough and since this isn't a marinade, there definitely needs to be enough sauce to flavor the chicken.

Excellent recipe. Simple yet complex flavors. Be sure to use fresh oregano and good olive oil!! Grill just a few lemon slices (takes a few seconds on hot grill) for presentation.

When we made it we didn't have time to roast or grill this chicken so we sauteed it and it ended up being very good. All we did was make the sauce (we halved it) and then covered the chicken in a little flour, and put a little olive oil in the pan and sauteed it. After it was done sauteing we poured the mixture over it. It was really good!

I made this for friends last night and it was delish. I made an error when prepping the sauce, and used 4 TBSP of black pepper in the sauce instead of the 1/2 TBSP. I panicked for a bit, but let the suace sit so the flavors could meld and then did my best to scoop out a good bit of the pepper. no complaints, so I must have done alright. I also brined the chicken overnight to lend a little xtra flavor to the meat. Very good, would make again.

Rating: 4
Very easy to make. Very easy to scale for a crowd. Very good reviews from our guests! Suggestions for next time: 1) Brine the chicken first for 45 minutes - extra insurance for tender and juicy. 2) No need to marinate, just brush on a lot of the sauce before grilling. 3) make three times the recipe for the sauce and use it for a dipping sauce. 4)Mince the garlic -very- finely, or use a garlic press. The fresh garlic in this is powerful, so keep it in very very small pieces. So easy! We will make this at barbecues for years to come.

This was a great way to grill chicken another way. Followed the directions here, there is NO NEED to marinate the chicken ahead of time. Just don't burn it--use your regular grilling technique rather than these convoluted instructions--and toss in the dressing. That's what makes this a success. I served with grilled asparagus and roasted potatoes for an easy, repeatable meal good enough for guests for a laid back bbq! The teens and husband all loved it.

I made this again using just 1 tsp. coarse salt in the sauce. Much better! I also marinated the chicken for about an hour in a plastic bag w/ about 1/3 the sauce, some extra fresh pepper and about 2 Tbsp of light soy sauce, skipping the sprinkling w/ the extra salt. The chicken was much more flavorful this time!

I made this for company for the first time. I used a gas grill and followed the directions exactly, except for the indirect cooking method. Since I had very plump chicken breasts, I thought this would take forever. Instead I grilled over med-low heat and then tossed in the dressing. Everyone declared it succulant and very juicy! No need to marinate.

I'm reviewing this as a marinade only--I made the sauce as directed, then used it for two pounds of boneless, skinless chicken thighs. I let them marinate for about an hour, then grilled the chicken. (Didn't season the chicken with any more salt or pepper than was in the marinade, and I thought it was fine like that.) Very flavorful, nice match with the dark-meat chicken. Would definitely make this again as a marinade.

Rating: 2
I used boneless breasts and did did not marinate prior to gas grilling. Used fresh oregano and a meyer lemon & lime combo + the 1/2 T salt called for. I found that even this amount in the dressing was a bit too much (and I didn't overseason the chicken before grilling), and while I otherwise loved the flavors of the dressing, the chicken was too bland and tasted like bland chicken with assertive sauce on it, but not infused in it. I missed the taste of chicken that's been infused with the taste of the marinade and next time may double the sauce so that I can marinate it before grilling. If I used a charcoal grill or boned chicken, there could have been more flavor in the bird but I did not like this method with plain breasts .

I made this last night for a bunch of friends. I chose boneless chicken breasts with skin. It was quite wonderful. In the custom of this site, here are the changes I made to the recipe. I used limes, as my 99 cent store offered a giant bag this week. Other than that, I followed as directed. For those that had some trouble with too much salt, I think it's because you're supposed to only use half in the sauce and use half to season the raw chicken. If you put it all into the sauce, it would be too salty. Reading the reviews I noticed a lot of people calling the sauce/dressing a "marinade". No where in the recipe does it say to "marinade" the chicken. But I chose to use half the dressing as a marinade for about 2 hours (I was afraid the citrus would turn the poultry mushy if I went any longer). Then I grilled and drizzled the pieces with the remaining sauce. Very wonderful.

Made this for a family BBQ and everyone loved it. Tripled the sauce and there wasn't a speck left. Used a mixture of lemon thyme, English thyme, tarragon, and oregano (all fresh), garlic cloves and shallots as another reviewer suggested. Kept the salt to about 1 1/2 tablespoons even though I tripled the lemon juice and oil. Roasted the chicken in three pans in a convection oven for 30 miinutes (switching pans as suggested halfway through), then covered it with foil and kept it in the oven on warm for almost two hours and it was still very moist. Served it with grilled eggplant and zucchini, and tomato fennel orzo (also from epi). I don't usually cook for this many people, but this was easy and delicious! Thought I would have enough for leftovers, but there was only 1 breast left. Will definitely make again.

When my boyfriend opened the fridge and saw the chicken marinating he said "oh no, is that dinner?" Luckily this recipe tastes MUCH better than it looks! I used lime juice instead of lemon juice, thanks to a reviewer's suggestion. I don't think I'd make this for guests, but as a mid-week dinner, it's quick, easy, and tastes like you made more of an effort than you actually did.

My family loves this recipe. The first time I made it, I followed other's advice to use lime juice and it was excellent.

We butterflied a large whole chicken (8LB) and grilled it on the charcoal grill with indirect heat for 30 minutes per side and it was perfectly done. We poured the sauce over the carved bird and even though we didn't marinate at all in advance the chicken was delicious and the flavors were impressive. Served with a salad of orzo, spinach, kalamata olives, feta and some of the lemon dressing. Was a huge hit -- between our two guests and two kids plus us we devoured every last morsel.

Super easy and delicious. I used a whole chicken cut up into 8 pieces and made the full amount of sauce. Used half as marinade and half over the top after cooking. cooked in the oven at 500 degrees and the chicken came out perfectly juicy. The sauce is strong, but chicken needs a lot of flavor, since it is so bland on its own. I also made the sauce in the processor to avoid all the chopping, and it turned out great.

This is such a great dish! I substituted fresh thyme for the oregano, as suggested by another reviewer, and doubled the marinade ingredients, except for the salt and pepper, because the amount of marinade seemed a little slim. Half was reserved as marinade and the other half to toss the grilled chicken in when finished. Although the intention was to marinate for 1/2 hour, it ended up in the mixture for an hour to no ill effect. Moist and delicious, it was enjoyed by all, finicky kids included! All of the ingredients were on hand (except for the fresh thyme because fresh oregano was not available, although I'm sure a tablespoon or so of dried would suffice). Never again an excuse for boring chicken!

I really liked this chicken. Made it as part of a bbq buffet, and the chicken was moist and very flavorful.

This has an amazing flavor that went way beyond my expectations based on the list of ingredients. I used the full amount of sauce for just 4 large chicken breasts and it was just enough. I marinated the chicken for one hour in half the sauce, grilled it, then rolled it in the remaining sauce before serving. We eagerly sopped up every drop of the extra sauce with our vegetables. This is company worthy, but easy enough for everyday. Only change I would make is cut back the salt to 1 tablespoon next time.

We loved this! Based on prior reviews, made a few adjustments...I made the amount of sauce specified, but just threw all the ingredients in the blender. The sauce was wonderful. I used about a third of it to marinate just over a pound of boneless chicken breasts (marinated for 1 hour). Grilled on the BBQ, poured the remaining sauce over the top. Skipped the grilled lemon thang. YUMMY.

Fantastic. Skip all of the grilling instructions (complicated enough to make one go out for dinner). I made 3x the sauce: some for marinade, some for basting, some for passing as dip. Fried garlic cloves in olive oil, added lemon rind, orange juice, pinch of sugar to blender. Fresh oregano a must. Biggest hit was the extra sauce, used for dipping chicken and baguette slices.

Great grilled chicken recipe. I simplified it a lot...No marinating (the sauce is strong enough!), and I just grilled chicken breasts with salt and pepper. I combined all the sauce ingredients in a blender. I don't like raw garlic, so I sauteed it lightly first. As a note, I made this recipe once with dried oregano and it was not very tasty; I made it again a couple of weeks later with fresh oregano and it was wonderful. The sauce is best for dunking, so if you're cooking for a crowd, make enough to give everyone their own little ramekin.

Took a slightly different approach and used the lemon juice etc. mixture as a marinade for a whole chicken (several hours)and grilled it on the rotisserie of our gas Weber. I used only half of the salt, but it could have used the entire amount. I didn't make additional sauce, but next time I will as the flavors were good but I think the additional boost f fresh to dip in or pour over would be great. Made a quick side dish by quartering some baking potatoes, sprinkling with a little olive oil, kosher salt and fresh chopped garlic and baking at 350° in a pan lined with parchment paper (easy clean up). The garlic got a bit too brown for my liking before the potatoes were completely done, so would add it a bit later another time.

This is an excellent recipe! I brined boneless, skinless thighs and skinned legs for two hours before grilling. Having brined the chicken, I did not season with salt before grilling. The dressing was delicious -- the fresh oregano is key here. All in all, the best grilled chicken recipe I've made in a long time.

I disagree that this recipe is time consuming. It just looks like it because of the very specific grilling instructions. Just grill the chicken the way you like it and dunk it in the sauce. I like it better this way than marinating in the sauce and grilling because there are fewer flare-ups caused by the dripping marinade. I love this recipe.

This sounds like a great recipe, although incredibly time consuming! I do the same recipe often and much quicker. Mix the lemon juice, oregano, fresh garlic and olive oil together and let the chicken (I usually use just breasts) marinate a while then grill until done. Same result, succulent, delicious chicken!

Excellent recipe, extremely fragrant and tasty way to grill chicken, also great with lime juice and a little balsamic vinegar.

If you think its good hot, its even better the next day cold! I doubled the marinade and marinated the chicken in the first batch and used the second for the coating. It was sooo good! I had to vary the cooking with my grill but the taste is so lovely. The lemons and garlic together are quite lovely. This is a great change from "traditional" chicken bbq.

I only used this for 6 chicken breasts. Thirty minutes was a bit too long for the gas grill on the breasts, but was still fairly moist. The sauce was AMAZING. My husband and I got to where we would cut a piece off, and dip it directly into a bowl of leftover sauce. A kick in the head on the first bite, but amazing once you adjusted to the lemon. LOVED how the garlic marinated. Also, will try marinating it in the sauce a bit before grilling next time.

My 10 year old thought this recipe might beat out his other favorite chicken meal-a Mario Batali dish. My husband and I agreed it was a winner. I used Mexican oregano and chopped it finely.

Delicious. I made half the recipe but made 100% of the sauce; used half of it to marinade for a day and the other half for coating at the end. Will be a family staple.

16 servings! This is really large, not messing with that much food.

I thought this was really delicious! I marinated just chicken breasts in the vinaigrette for a couple of hours, then grilled on a gas grill outside. Once cooked, I drizzled more of the vinaigrette on top and let sit under foil for about 5 minutes. I sliced up all the breasts and served on a platter of arugula, along with more dressing I made while the chicken was resting. Didn't bother with grilling the lemons but will next time. This was FANTASTIC! We ate everything on the platter and wished for more!

This was great! As another reviewer suggested, I let the chicken marinate overnight ~ the flavors came together beautifully. Since it's winter and we couldn't grill outside I used my grill pan on the stovetop with boneless/skinless breasts.

I wasn't able to grill the chicken as recommended, so I can only imagine how much better that would have tasted. I followed the baking instructions and the chicken was tender and juicy, though I would baste with the juices and extra lemon juice next time. Pure Yum!

This dish was excellent! Super easy to make, and a nice change from the everyday dinner. I used the sauce as a marinade, and the flavor was really intense. Next time I won't add as much salt, but everything else was delicious! I definitely will make it again.

This is your basic Greek roasted chicken that I have been making for years, but w/o the salt. Cook on the grill if at all possible. I baste with sauce during cooking instead of cooking and then placing in the sauce. When you take the chicken off the grill, just squeeze some additional lemon juice on the bird and you'll be happy.

Excellent, moist, and tender, I let it marinade over night, everyone loved it, any leftover were cut up for a salad the next day.

I made this chicken for a barbecue and my friends raved about it. Very moist and flavourful. Good the next day too. Will definitely make again.

This chicken was fantastic. It really held the flavour from the marinade. I did make one major modification and it transformed it from great to heavenly!! I substituted the garlic with bottled minced garlic, ginger and chili. It gave the chicken a nice colour and a little bit of heat but not too much!! I made this with 6 skinless chicken legs so I had to cut down the recipe quite abit. It seems to me that it calls for alot of salt. I cut that back. My husband loved this. We make barbequed chicken legs a couple of times per week and these were the best we've had in ages!!

Served this last night at a dinner party and we all savored the chicken for so long there was little conversation.We had never tasted anything so interesting AND delicious. A truly elegant and magical blend of flavors and textures. Beautiful presentation. This is def going on my short list of dinner party entrees.

This is a great recipe, especially for those three-legged chickens. All fowl humor aside, the idea of using the dressing on the cooked chicken, rather than as a marinade before cooking, is brilliant! I cut the recipe down to feed four, using one quite ordinary two-legged chicken, cut up. I simplified it a bit too by searing legs and breasts at the same time, cooking both over the indirect heat together, and taking the breasts off about five minutes earlier than the legs.

I cooked it in my oven at 500 degrees, and it was DONE after 20 minutes. SOmeone whould revise the main recipe, which indicates 40 mins. for doneness in the oven at 500. It was fa-bu - moist and flavorfull, juicy and yummy. We could live on this.

Chicken was great! I used boneless & skinless chicken breast which cut some fat and cooking time off the recipe. I also as Emeril would say kicked it up a notch with some Cayenne.

Very quick and easy recipe if you use the gas grill. The cooking time was actually shorter, especially if you use skinless breasts. Cooking time was about 25 minutes total cooking time. My 9 year old son loved it. Definitely will make this again.

We followed recipe exactly and found that the grilling method was cumbersome (a combination of direct and indirect cooking). However the sauce was great, and using it at the end worked very well.

This was very good. Even my college-age son liked it. On my grill the chicken was done in 20 minutes.
