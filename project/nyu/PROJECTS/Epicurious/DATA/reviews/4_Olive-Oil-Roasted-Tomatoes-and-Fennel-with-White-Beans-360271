This is a family favorite. There is some kind of magic that happens between the olive oil, garlic and tomatoes that makes us all want to lick our plates. Love this! I do not cook it a long as it calls for -- 30 minutes at 425 is just too darned long.

Just made this for dinner tonight and it was terrific and so easy to make. I added just enough oil to the pan to cook the fennel, then after adding the tomatoes and other ingredients I drizzled more oil over the top to coat. The results were not at all greasy and when the cherry tomatoes popped it made a delicious sauce.

Wow! Delicious! This is an amazing side dish with a nice kick from the crushed red peppers. Fresh cherry tomatoes from the garden were perfect.

I guess you have to love fennel and mushy tomatoes. We love most epi recipes but this one not so much!

Super easy, delicious recipe. It is really good over arugula as well.

Oh, wow. I love this! I will make this forever and ever and ever. So simple and so wonderful. This is the perfect kind of thing to do with not-so-ripe or rather mealy tomatoes of any sort. The grape tomatoes are particularly good, though. I love the wonderful oiliness of everything and all of the flavors meld nicely. I had some for dinner last night, for lunch today and I'm sure I'll have some again for dinner! Excellent when dipping with a crusty piece of bread. I think it would also be wonderful over fresh greens or with pasta. Or just out of the bowl.

Easy and delicious. The combination of flavors was perfect. It's rather heavy on the oil, but if you have crusty bread on the side, you can soak it up!

This is exceptionally good, and great cold on a picnic, hiking or camping in warm weather.

Oh my--what a wonderful combination of flavors. I followed the instructions, but cut the recipe in half. I made it early in the afternoon and served it at room temperature for dinner. I broiled a piece of salmon, flaked it and put it over the dish. Each mouthful was followed by many mmmmms. Fennel is a new veggie for me but with recipes like this, it will soon become a favorite. It is important to stir the mixture while roasting--also, there might be a few dry beans after the final 5 minutes but a few stirs and oil coating will restore the moisture.

One of the best , easiest vegan dishes ever. The oil is all soaked up if the dish sits and cools down before eating. I used the best extra virgin oil I had. I'd love to try it as a pizza topping if there was ever any leftover!

Very good. I put it on top of lightly dressed romaine. So good!

I'm enjoying the leftovers of this right now! It's very good, and super easy. I went up to the pt of adding the beans the night before, then heated everything up with the beans before serving on Easter. It's nice to have a tasty, substantial vegan option held back!

I have no idea how this got four forks! Really, this not the best use of these ingedients. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was boring.

I'm surprised people were cutting back on the oil... Mine dried out and began to burn in the oven. I found this somewhat bland and uninteresting.

I made this and LOVED it! I made it for a side dish at a baby shower. Great warm or room temp.

Wonderfully delicious! I had this as a main course and it was definitely satisfying. My friend whose definition of a meal revolves around meat even enjoyed it. I will absolutely be making this again. Though next time i will lessen the oil.

Oh gosh, I hate to be the odd one out, but I felt this was way too greasy and while baking some of the garlic burned giving the dish a bitter taste. The fennel was delicious though.

I made this exactly per the recipe except I wasn't able to buy fresh oregano so I used dried. My husband and I loved it. It made a wonderful vegetarian lunch. It would also be great as a side dish with meat. Yummy!

Fantastic flavors, perfect for entertaining, and so healthy! I followed other reviewers' recommendations and only used 1/3 c oil, which was perfect. I also served it bruschetta-style on toasted french bread. This has become one of my new, top 5 veggie side-dishes.

This was so tasty and very light. I added fingerling potatoes and highly recommend that.

My husband loved this dish. It's a very satisfying side dish. Leftovers keep well and taste just as good if not better the second day. Good for Poultry and meat as the main course but is probably too heavy for a fish main.

Good, hearty side dish especially with fish. Too salty though (and I like salt). I'll make it again but I'd cut the salt by 25-50% and add more to taste next time.

This was unbelievable! All the other reviewers have pretty much covered it, but I'd just like to add that I made it as printed except I used rosemary sprigs instead of oregano and it was FANTASTIC! I agree that it is too much oil and will cut back next time. Best new side dish in a while!

This salad was amazing! Loved the roasted flavors. I also cut the olive oil back and used fresh white beans rather than canned. I think next time I will omit the chopped frond as garnish, and just use the roasted fennel.

I'm updating my review. So I made this again last night with less then 1/2 the oil and only put in oven for 15 minutes before the tomatoes were soft and it was DELICIOUS. One of my new favorites.

Delicious and healthy! Halved the recipe and also as many others have, reduced the olive oil -- the recipe just seemed like way too much for the number of servings and I really don't need the extra calories. Fabulous for lunch the next day. A real keeper.

Delicious. Would make for company for a late summer meal. Cut oil, used large tomatoes, and served over polenta with parmesan. Would be better with fresh beans instead of canned.

I loved this recipe. Even better the 2nd day on toast. I used about 1/4 to 1/3 cup olive oil. Flavors were fantastic.

I usually like to try recipes as-is for the first time. FOR SURE next time I will reduce the olive oil a bit and cut the cooking time. I left in for the 30 minutes and my tomatoes were just a huge mess, nothing left inside of them. But still very delicious!

This was just dynamite. I used navy beans instead of cannellini (bought the wrong can) and larger tomatoes, but it still turned out delicious. So flavorful.

Rating: 4
great vegetarian meal. i have made it several times and last time exchanged garbanzos for the cannelini and it worked quite well. also prefer to sub dill for the fennel fronds. as to the oil amount controversy. the most i ever used was 1/2 c. but 1/3 works just as well.

Made this last night with whole tomatoes that i cored and seeded. Also used pinto beans because that's what I had. Delicious. Mine was plenty spicy -- I was generous with the seasonings -- and I look forward to trying it for lunch. Btw, I served it at room temperature but think it would be better hotter.

I added quartered vidalia onions to this recipe and started it by searing the fennel and onions on the grill. Once I had some nice grill marks, I transferred them to the baking sheet, added the tomatoes and baked them off. Delicious and convenient as this is an easy make-ahead for a dinner party. A really nice accompaniment for pork or chicken.

Rating: 4
Freaking delicious! Used seeded roma tomatoes and about 1/2 c olive oil. I made it in the morning and let sit at room temperature all day then slightly warmed in oven before serving. If you have a flavor problem add more everything! oregano, red pepper, garlic. Its amazing!

I made this recipe as written and thought it was excellent. I like the suggestion of serving this over polenta but it is just so satisfying on its own.

This is beautiful, earthy, and delicious! I used a combination of red, yellow and chocolate tomatoes and sliced the fennel into thinner wedges than pictured. Served it with fresh grilled polish sausage and a large green salad. I agree that it would be great as a vegetarian dish over polenta.

I tried 1/2 the recipe (with a little less olive oil)- but instead of cooking in the oven,I used my cast-iron skillet on the barbecue - the extra heat made the fennel carmelize really nicely. I had it as a one-dish vegetarian dinner, no meat required.

Rating: 4
My family LOVED this recipe! What a great way to enjoy fennel. I took other reviewers' suggestions and reduced the olive oil to 1/3 cup. I happened to have a large shallot on hand so I thinly sliced it and added it to the fennel midway though browning. Will definitely be doing this one again!

Rating: 4
Loved it! Followed others' advice and used less olive oil; and only one can of beans which I rinsed carefully. A little fresh basil with the beans and it was extraordinary. My vegetarian friend could not stop raving about it.

Love when people change the recipe and then critique it! It is NOT too much olive oil. Olive oil is healthy and delicious. Love this dish.

Such simple ingredients create a very rustic, complex-tasting dish here. To me, this embodies what late summer/early fall flavors in this area are all about. I cut the recipe in half (just two of us) and it was plenty. Only about 1/3 of the time in the oven was needed before the cherry tomatoes burst. I didn't have oregano sprigs, so I used a very small amt (1/8 tsp?) of herbes de provence. Served with grilled chicken breasts, cucumber salad, and pinot noir. What a great dinner.

This was delicious. I substituted fresh lima beans for the cannelini and topped it with shrimp sauteed in garlic. Made a really good one-dish meal.

I will definitely make this one again. I found the mellow fennel and roasted tomatoes made a very comforting dish. I love interesting vegetable side dishes, and this is one of the better bon appetit receipes I have tried. I used 1/2 cup oil, but I think I could get away with less next time.

Rating: 4
I had all the ingredients available, however I substituted 4 small fresh tomatoes from our garden, (which I quartered) and halved the recipe. I used about a 1/3 c olive oil, and while it had probably more than we needed, I rather liked it that way. This recipe is spectacular, and very easy to prepare. I added basil, as others recommended. Another keeper, my husband said.

I am always looking for interesting side dishes. This is yummy - very flavorful. I will make this again and again. It is full of protein and delicious flavor. I did not use the fronds. I wasn't sure I would like the texture. I also substituted dry oregano for the fresh springs. If you like the individual ingredients of this dish, you will love the combination.

i really, really like this dish & have made it 3 times in as many weeks. twice i served it over pasta and once on its own. i only made a half recipe and it served 4 people with pasta. like other reviewers, i used less oil than called for.

Made this for a potluck, and everyone loved it. Made with less oil, about 1/3, as per everyone's advice, and added slivers of basil, and several more sprigs of oregano. Very tasty, and nothing left to see if it improves in flavor overnight!

Awesome! I loved the flavor of the roasted tomatoes and roasting the fennel mellowed out the licorice taste. I followed the suggestions of the other reviewers and used more tomatoes and less oil. 3-4 Tablespoons is perfect. Yummy! I will definitely make again.

Very Good. Some slight changes on the actual recipe. I also reduced the olive oil and I also substituted skinned and seeded plum tomatoes for the cherry tomatoes. ALSO...as for the leftovers, I pureed them along with a few sun dried tomatoes and the result was actually better than the original recipe. You can serve this instead of hummus....just as good. Will make again for sure!

I made this to bring to a pot luck. Like others, 1/3 c of oil was more than enough. Next time I would add more fennel and more tomatoes. It was a personal taste thing- I'd rather have a higher veggie to bean ratio. I'll be making this for a BBQ next weekend.

Thought this was delicious served with toasted ciabatta. You really don't need 3/4 cup olive oil. I used about 1/3 cup, and that was just about right. The caramelized fennel and tomatoes make the dish taste rich.

Like the previous reviewer, I cut waaaay back on the oil, using approx. 3-4 tbsp instead of the recommended 3/4 cup. The resulting dish wasn't oily but it was a bit bland. I would consider making it again as the combination of caramelized fennel and roasted tomatoes was delicious but I would increase the amount of tomatoes and herbs in the dish.

I made this tonight as a vegetarian entree and really enjoyed it. I used a bit more than 2 tablespoons of oil in the entire dish and it was perfect; any more, my husband and I agreed, and it would have been far too oily. A sprinkling of Parmesan chese at the table was a nice addition.
