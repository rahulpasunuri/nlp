Although the flavor is very nice there is too much liquid even after reducing the vegetables and letting the dish rest for 30 mins. I recommend adding some cream to the simmering veggies to hopefully bring the dish together a bit.

I made this with prime rib, yorkshire pudding etc. for Christmas. It definitely was the highlight. Very rich. I added a few porcini mushrooms which gave it a more rich, earthy flavour. Would be great with almost any meat. I made it a couple hours ahead and then put it in the oven when the guests arrived. Worked out great.

I didn't have leeks the first time I made this and added sauteed fresh wild mushrooms, as well. I used my mandolin to make VERY thin sliced potatoes, for more layering, cut back on some of the butter and added parmesan cheese. I am requested to bring this dish to dinner too many times! It is so tasty, I can't wait to eat it again! I'm bringing it to dinner (again) on Sunday with friends.

Fantastic! Served twice, once with roast goose & once with beef en croute with cilantro & walnut stuffing. Used porcinis both times & it's a perfect savory accompaniment. Also simple & quick to prepare. Christmas & New Year's Eve guests loved it. This will be a staple for many hearty winter meals to come!
