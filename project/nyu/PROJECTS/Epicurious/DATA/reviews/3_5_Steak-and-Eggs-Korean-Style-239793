I am experimenting with making my own kimchi, but in the mean time I use 1 quart of home made saurkraut (rinsed) with a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and a table spoon of Basalmic vinegar, 2 to 4 cups of leftover rice and a quarter cup of water and 2 to 4 tablespoons hot sauce with the minced onion and garlic. I also do not waste the marinade. This is one of our favorite winter dishes...so instead of grilling i pan fry the steaks in the marinade and spoon the reduction on the egg before serving.

actually, gochujang is a fermented product, being a mixture of red chile powder, glutenous rice powder and powdered fermented soybeans with salt. so while it's definitely not a mix of soybean paste (dwenjang) and red chiles, which the recipe never posits, it is a fermented product... and absolutely essential in korean cuisine.

Gochujang is not fermented soybean paste (denjang) and red pepper paste mixed together. That is called samjang and is not spicy at all. Gochujang is just the red pepper paste and is very spicy. You will end up with very different flavors depending on which one you use. I would go for the gochujang as most people are not used to the flavor of denjang.

This recipe is a hit at our house. The flavors blend wonderfully. I like to add a little bit more Kimchi for extra punch, but the recipe is delicious just as written.
