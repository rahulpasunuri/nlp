To save some money I used cream cheese instead of mascarpone. I made mini tart shells, filled them with the flavored and sweetened cheese then set a bowl of sweetened sectioned grapefruit on the side so folks could top their tart with as much as they wanted. It was a big hit and got everyone talking about the novelty of grapefruit tarts. (Although many people thought the ginger was candied lemon peel).

The mascarpone cheese mixture curdled, even though I made sure everything was room temperature. There should be more in the recipe about preventing the mixture from turning into a curdled mess.

I made this dessert for my mother-in-law's birthday to try and dazzle her with my high class cookering. It certainly worked. I did peal and de-membrane the grapefruit about 5 hours ahead of time, and they still looked gorgeous when assembled. I also made the filling several hours ahead. This made assembling it at the party easy and kept the shell crispy.

This is a light and unusual tart that can serve both as a dessert or accompaniment to seafood dish. I highly recommend it!

I made this for a party, and everyone loved it. I would make one comment though. I had some difficulty peeling my grapefruit sections so they were whole and looked nice, as in the picture. I was, however, in somewhat of a hurry. I just arranged my fruit over the top as best I could, and everyone said it tasted great. If I were doing it again, I would be sure to set aside enough time for that step.

Light, delicious. Worth the effort to section the grapefruit. Three large grapefruit were sufficient. The crust did NOT get soggy when the finished tart was held; even leftovers next day had crunch.

Very light dessert. Not too sweet for a tart. The only problem I had was that the cheese mixture looked a little lumpy when mixed.

Beautiful! I melted about 3 ounces of white chocolate chips with 1/2 tsp. shortening and spread in the bottom of the tart crust before adding the mascarpone filling. It was very nice. I think this tart would be fine without the white chocolate addition, too, but I needed to hold my tart for a while after filling before I could serve it, and I wanted to keep my crust from getting soggy. I dislike sectioning citrus fruit, but this tart was worth it. I bet it would be good with blood oranges, too. Very impressive-looking dessert and very feminine and summery, somehow.

My husband does not normally eat deserts, but this one he loved. It was light, refreshing and not sweet. I coated the crust with chocolate after it cooled and then put in the filling. This allowed the tart to last for a few days in the fridge. This also allowed the ginger to infuse the cream. It was better the next day!

A wonderfully refreshing dessert. It is very easy to prepare - only the tart crust is baked
