I could be wrong, but I hold that there is a typo in this recipe. It calls for two and a half pounds of kale. I think it really means two and a half CUPS. (Otherwise, how do you expect to fit all that in a single pot, with the remains of the potato water? Other than that, it tasted pretty good.

This recipe did double duty for us this past week. I made it nearly exactly as the recipe states except I used nicely browned Trader Joe's chicken apple sausage instead of the Polish sausage. I used a hand-crank food mill instead of a ricer, which was a pain but it was all I had in my MIL's kitchen. I also sauteed the onions in butter until they were just barely carmelized before putting them in the casserole. It was quite good first time around, and tonight I took a portion of about 2 cups, added half a quart of home-canned rich chicken stock, and made soup. That also was very good. My MIL did not like the casserole because she said the sausage was too sweet, but the vinegar toned it down for us. I would definitely make this again, perhaps using sharp cheddar with the chicken apple sausage.

I made exactly as written, with the exception of leaving the skin on the potatoes and adding a can of red kidney beans to the potato mixture. Next time I will just rough mash the potatoes instead of bothering with the ricer; unless you particularly enjoy the silkiness of riced potatoes, it's not worth the effort.

I followed the recipe exactly and I'm not sure where we went wrong, but this recipe did NOT turn out for us. We found the Kale to be too coarse a green and it overwhelmed the dish. My husband asked me not to make this again and despite my polish background, I have to agree. I'll just stick with pan seared sausage and boiled potatoes from now on!

Boy was this good! I sauteed onions, sausage, kale and some cabbage in stages in the same skillet,adding the more tender kale last, which I did chop. Mashed potatoes separately. Used chedder and at least 1/4 cider vinegar. Yum!

this was a little more work that at first glance but it was delicious! I made it as shown but wouldn't miss the kielbasa to make it vegetarian or to pair with corned beef or something...very good and nice winter meal

The Czech/Polish side of my family can be stern critics when it comes to kielbasa dishes and this one left them quite impressed. It is a perfect day-after-Thanksgiving dish when one has un-used potatoes, onions, and greens lying around. Also it is nice to see a recipe that utilizes the creamy and underexposed Muenster variety of cheese. I did find it called for too much kale (1 1/2 lbs. to 2 is plenty). Furthermore, I would reduce the amount of broth going into the potatoes as it made them watery.

Great alternative to traditional casseroles. I double the kale to make it feel healthier. Good dish for groups and makes fantastic leftovers.

I made this for after a cold Winter Solstice parade and everyone loved it - kids and all. My husband's family said it reminded them of something their Dutch mother made. I made it again and my husband bought the munster at a fancy cheese shop, it was much too stinky. It was real French munster instead of the mild North American version. So either don't bother with the expensive stuff or use less of it.

This is perfect for football nite with a house full of men! Plenty of vinegar (I used a quarter cup in all b/c I sauteed my chard (not kale) in it to get it puckery) makes all the difference. I used a ton of greens and also used cheddar because that is what I had and men love cheddar! It fed 4 big men (minus the cup I had).

This casserole will not win any beauty contests. Truly, it looks like a pan full of Canadian goose droppings. Having said that, it is beyond tasty.. it is mouth- wateringly delicious. My husband claimed it was one of those most delectable dishes I've ever made! The cider vinegsr gives it a real tang and all the flavours together make for a real palate- pleaser. I made it according the recipe and would not change a thing. Fabulous, will make again and again.. I just wish it wasn't so visually unappealling as I would love to make it for guests!

Loved this recipe. But, I didn't add the cider vinegar, and I used Cheddar instead of Munster. Kale is the perfect food and very underrated. Prep took the longest of anything.

Rating: 3
This made an excellent all in one meal. My husband, who hates vegetables, said he didn't even mind having kale this way. I used about half the kale than the recipe called for per previous suggestions, and there was still plenty. Next time I think I will carmelize the onions more.

Okay, one fork is supposed to mean "ok" but this recipe is the pits and not okay at all! I think it's the munster and cider mix - not good. We threw it out.

This was just not good at all. I was surprised since it got such a high rating. We threw out the leftovers and we never do that - I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

Great comfort food and recipe works perfectly as-is or is really easy to substitute, especially for lower calorie kielbasa and cheese/s. Great for leftovers but definitely does not freeze well. Vinegar really makes a difference. I forgot it once and none of us liked it as much.

Rating: 4
Recipe was great comfort food. Used less Kale as others suggested. I do agree to prep the potatoes and sausage at the same time, prep time was extensive. Very unhealthy, but great. Used only 2T of butter and maybe a little more cider vinegar. Leftovers for days...yummy!

Prep is a little time consuming but well worth it. Comfort food that hits the spot!

I made this dish last night and my family loved it. As the others suggest, cut back on the kale and caramelize the onions. To save time, get the potatoes going at the same time as the sausage if you want to cook the onions in the sausage grease. I used spicy italian sausage links instead of kielbasa and it was wonderful.

This is a favorite in our house. I do all kinds of modifications, but always use the vinegar in the potatoes because the zip is perfect. I also always substitute leeks for onions because my partner doesn't do onions (hahaha fooled her!). I also add fresh garlic, and dried basil and sage to the leek mixture. Last time I mixed two cans of salmon into the sauteed leeks, garlic and herbs. When this came off the heat I added lemon juice and 1/2 of the 2 cups of cheddar cheese I substituted for the munster. I layered this between three layers of the potato mixture, put the remaining cup of cheese on top, and served steamed broccoli with it. It turned out GREAT!!

Being of Dutch heritage, I was excited to try this recipe, and it was wonderful! Reminds me of a dish my grandmother used to make with bacon, mashed potatoes, sauteed lettuce/onion, and sliced hard-boiled eggs. I substituted turkey sausage, cut down on the kale a bit, and added some more vinegar while the onions were cooking. Leftovers were great, too!!!

Excellent cold-weather comfort food. Like another reviewer said, it works well with all kinds of substitutions. Spinach instead of kale, leeks instead of onions, etc.

Rating: 2
I felt that this casserole was just ok. I chose this recipe for the combination of flavors, but I found that I wasn't at all crazy about the texture of the mashed potatoes mixed with the kale. I feel that an improvement would be to layer sliced potatoes with the cheese, then the sausage, onions & cheese on top (as directed). The kale should be served as a side dish.

Wow -- this defines the word "hearty." But really, who needs to up their fat intake by using that much butter and cheese? 2 TBSP butter, 1/2 cup cheese, and a turkey kielbasa with casing removed worked perfectly.

A fantastic dish that is "a keeper" for us. A delicious way to use up lots of kale. It takes a little work to prepare but worth the time.

Great recipe which can also handle a lot of substitutions as others have mentioned. I would definitely CHOP the kale so it gets more evenly distributed and you don't have to deal with trying to cut it. I used turnips instead of potatoes, turkey sausage instead of kielbasa Also added a little extra cheese.

Really really good comfort food. My husband and his mother absolutely loved it and so did I. I used about half the amount of kale suggested in the recipe.

Couldn't give this any forks b/c I altered it to such an extent. Used yukon potatoes and brocolli rabe. Instead of so much butter used about two tablespoons and a little (about 2 tbsp) of whipping cream that I had in the fridge. Topped with chicken apple sausage and used gruyere cheese that I had on hand. Some sprinkling of nutmeg on top. But I did follow the basic idea of this recipe and it ended up very nice. Would definitely make again.

My "Hollander" mother-in-law used to make something very similar to this and I have been trying to duplicate ever since. She had a Dutch Baker who supplied her with real Dutch sausage amongst other goodies and that made quite a difference. A helpful tip is to wash and freeze the kale before hand. When ready to use it is very easy to break the frozen kale off the stems. I understand that the Dutch adopted this recipe from the Spanish who invaded and occupied Holland for a while in the 15th or 16th century.

Great confort food. Made this for lunch on a Saturday. Put a little Cognac and vinegar in the kale. I used Hot Portugese sausage and one pkg. of fresh kale.

My friend Ann and I had casserole and brownie night the other day. I wanted prepare something warm, comforting and hearty for those harsh, cold southern California winter nights. I choose this delectible dish. It was easy to prepare and a cinch make/bake. The only criticizm we had was about that vegetable that beings with a "k" and ends in an "e". Aside from smelling like burning tires when boiling it, there was just too darn much of it! I think bring it down to a bunch and a half or 1¼ lbs would be better. We did have a fun time pointing and laughing at each other with kale in our teeth. Perhaps a bit more Munster approximately ¼cup more would be great. Her chocolate brownies and Haggen Daz were a wonderful compliment to this spiced sausage and kale meal. Thank you epicurious!

Although I haven't tried this recipie, this Dutch traditional meal is a staple in our household. we have it at least once a week in the winter. We use frozen kale from the garden and boil it in the same pot as the sausage coil (Dutch Smoked sausage tastes best). We boil the potatoes separately. We mash the potatoes, adding milk, butter, salt, and pepper to taste and then add the kale and chopped sausage. It is a very simple dish with few ingredients. Sometimes we serve it with gravy and other times we subsitute the Kale for sourkrout. A very simple, hearty, and tastey meal.

Very good. Nice potato dish for a cold day (about 3 degrees today!) I used a bit less kale, otherwise stuck to the recipe.

I had a boyfriend from Amsterdam who made a version of this recipe for me. He boiled the potato's, then added torn/chopped Kale at a certain stage, then added the sausage at the next stage. He knew at exactly what stage to add each item, at the point that he drained the cooking liquid, he removed and cut the sausage into bite size pieces. Before adding the sausage back to the vegetables, he added margarine, salt and pepper. It eas family comfort food that he loved and I really enjoyed it. I have not made this version, but I think I'll try it.

The "cook everything separately, then cook it all together" can get a little tiring; I tend to make this on a weekend and then use it for leftovers all week. I agree with the cook who uses spinach instead of kale; the kale can make it hard to slice. It's a nice interesting combination.

Rating: 3
This is a great dish. I didn't have kielbasa so I subbed Italian sauage. Didn't have Munster, either, and subbed old cheddar with a few dashes of cayenne and nutmeg in the potatoes. I only cooking the Kale for 10 minutes and that seemed to be enough. I sprinkled a few chopped walnuts on top before cooking and they added flavour and texture. I roughly mashed the potatoes with their skins on for additional texture. My 14-year-old liked it!

Rating: 3
We found this a wonderful dish and would definitely make it again. I did make some changes. I cooked the potatoes, with 4 peeled whole cloves of garlic, in just enough water to cook them. I then mashed them thoroughly. Instead of kale, I used a small head of cabbage, which I smothered New Orleans style, rather than boiled. And I used Jarlsburg cheese. A little more work, but worth it.

Rating: 3
Very tasty, and we'd definitely make it again - but 2 1/2lbs of kale is a lot of leafy greens! I think a pound or less would do nicely. I might also add some corn next time. One very nice feature of this recipe is that you can use the same pot for all of your stove-top cooking. Looking forward to the leftovers . . .

This dish IS Dutch cooking, very similar to my great grandmother's bourracoule from Rotterdam. Great combination of tastes and textures. I saw no need for the potato ricer (who even has one?) so I just mashed the potatoes. I also substituted monterey jack cheese and used a little less than was called for. Went over great. Will become a regular in my "culinary rotation!"

A friend made this for us one night, and it has since become a family favorite. I have made several variations of it: add garlic w/ the onions, use almost any kind of cheese or sausage, and tonight we made it with spinach instead of kale. It is simple and fun to make, and it is absolutely delicious!!

definately a yummy addition to my hearty cold weather dishes. it's a great dish to use comparable items you have in the freezer or on-hand. i used garlic-basil sausage removed from the casings, frozen collard greens, garlic and a bit of cognac when the onions were almost carmelized, and a sharp white irish cheddar. my roommates loved it... and the leftovers were great as well!

Memories of my dutch childhood with a bit of a twist!!! Everyone loved it! Will definitley make this again using homemade turkey sausages and a different low fat cheese perhaps. My father used to boil the sausages and then prick with a fork to remove any excess fat, this does not scimp on flavour and yeilds a nice juicy sausage!

Great recipie and jumping off point for other ideas... Going to use the idea again using italian sausage for one and ham for another...Allso great with leftover mashed potatoes

Excellent dish to satisfy Ukrainiane food cravings in a land devoid of such foods. I used cabbage as a substitute as Kale isn't available anywhere and it worked well. I would also recommend 1/4 cup less broth.

My boyfriend called this a Polish shepards pie. It is really good and hearty but definitely not remotely healthy. Instead of using a 13x9 pan, I used two 9x9 pans and put one in the freezer for later.

My Husband loved it, and so did I. I thought the mashed potatoes came out a little bit too wet, though, kind of soupy. Next time I'll cut back a little on the broth.

Way to much kale, just one good size bunch is plenty. I also just used cheese I had in the fridge, munster is very strong. My two kids ate it and whenever I get kale I will make this.

My husband loved this recipe. I thought it was flavorful but a bit dry. I think it could use more than a 1:3 ratio of kielbasa to potatoes next time.
