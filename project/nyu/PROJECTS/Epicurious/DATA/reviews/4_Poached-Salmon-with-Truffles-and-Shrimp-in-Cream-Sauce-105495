I was so disappointed with this recipe! After reading all the positive reviews, I was expecting something very special. Instead, it was a lot of work for nothing. I used preserved truffles, and they did not add any discernible taste to the dish. The shrimp sauce on the salmon was okay, but nothing that great. I found it to be a terrible waste of good salmon.

As both a seafood and truffle lover, I had to try this recipe. Amazing! I wasn't so sure about the shrimp shells. However, they added such a depth of flavor and richness, that when coupled with the shaved truffle, my husband and I were in heaven. I added a bit of crab at the end as some other reviewers suggested and was oh so happy that I did. Can not wait to have my next dinner party. I know what I am making.

I made this for christmas dinner and liked it a lot. I got preserved truffles and have to say (sheepishly) that i am not sure they added much. I'd skip those next time. Also, i didnt do that business with the sauteed/pureed/strained shrimp shells. Too much work and the the sauce was incredible with out it. As someone noted below - i would eat that sauce with a soup spoon if i could.... it is that good. Oh, I also added some crab meat to the shrimp. It was a good addition

Made this for a dinner party last night. It was yummy and a very nice presentation. No truffles available outside of the holidays at my Whole Paycheck, so had to skip that part but subbed some minced baby bellas sauted in truffle oil in the sauce. Would be interesting to see how different it tastes with the truffles.

I used organic white truffle butter and it worked out beautifully. Served as a main course over cauliflower puree and the people nearly licked the plates clean. Great recipe and well worth the effort.

The sauce was awesome! I didn't have any truffles but rubbed the salmon w/ truffle oil which seemed to be nice. I used 1 &1/2 lb salmon and that made 4 "discs" so it was more of a main course. I also used 1 lb jumbo shrimp but didn't change the quantities of other ingredients, worked well. Def make this again, sauce would be great alone, next time I will play around w/ it, such a GREAT base.

wow...followed the recipe exactly and when I tasted the sauce I was just floored. Amazing! I can't wait to make this again. I served the salmon and the sauce on a bed of sauteed spinach with some garlic bread on the side. Next time I think I will try a parmisan risotto.

This recipe is going straight to the top of my favorites list!!! The sauce was rich and silky, wouldn't change a thing there. I didn't use truffle either, but I can't imagine it would have made this recipe any better! We sopped up every bit of the sauce with some crusty french bread~ amazing!!

I love this recipe. I made the sauce using morel mushrooms and served it over halibut because I had no salmon. The shrimp sauce is outstanding. Next time though I'm going to serve the sauce as a pasta dish, or poured over a fresh biscuit eggs Benedict.

Served this on a bed of sauteed spinach. Recipe is extremely rich and begs an acidic accompaniment. Totally worth the effort to make the shrimp butter.

I didn't use truffles or cognac, still turned out pretty darn tasty. I will use both next time.

Skipped the salmon and made the shrimp with the sauce. It was fantastic! Everyone was sopping up the sauce with bread to get every last drop.

just to clarify for the Brampton cook, there are no organic shrimp in the US as the USDA has not yet agreed on a set of organic standards, until then you cannot call it organic. That is not the case in Canada and other countries (EU) were certification for organic shrimp is available, albeit by NGO's with no unified code of standards. There is however "natural" shrimp that is produced without the use of antibiotics or chemicals.

Just made it. It was fantastic. I used organic ingredients, including organic shrimp. I also added Organic Mussles to the poached salmon and the salmon was not even close to dry. I didn't use the truffles as it was not a special occassion. I put it on top of farafalle pasta and everyone in my family loved it. I would make it again at the drop of a hat!

I tried this last night. The sauce is divine. The Salmon dried out on me but that was completely my fault since I never poached before. I think the Shrimp butter has lots of potential to be used alone or in a different recipe. Also I found the sauce a little bit on the heavy side. All in all a nice recipe.

Merchant told me truffles were $100 an oz so i went with dried wild mushrooms. I thought it was great

Do NOT make the sauce with 'olive oil, whole milk and flour'. If you can't live a little, this recipe is probably not for you.

This is the second time I made this recipe. I could not find black truffles, so I omitted it. I found I did not have to reduce the sauce much once the whipping cream was added to the wine/shallot reduction. The best way to poach the fish is to bring a pot of water to boil and perfume with lemon slices and wine etc. Have the filets in a glass baking dish. Pour over , cover with foil and place in a 300 degree oven for 10 minutes. Take out. Let stand for 10 more minutes. Remove foil. Pefect everytime. The sauce is so darn good you do not want to ruin this dish with overcooked salmon. Excellent and decadent dish.

I made this dish for a dinner party of 12 and served it over wild rice with edamame and seared red pepper. I found the tying of the fillets not that much extra work considering the pay off in presentation. You can easily stuff and tie the fillets ahead of time. Am I the only one who splurged and used the truffles? It makes a HUGE difference, as I have made it both with and without. (Without for the practice round :) If you're going to go the extra mile to impress, I would follow the recipe and include them. The shrimp butter is amazing, and definitely makes the sauce. My guests all raved about this dish. Now how am I going to come up with something equally as spectacular next time?

This sauce works well with Sole

My company really raved about it. While I liked it and will make it again, I'm going to try using olive oil, whole milk, and flour the next time around, rather than heavy cream & butter. (I left the truffles out)

Despite the fact that I didn't have any truffles and I skipped the salmon altogether, I think this recipe is wonderful! I made this as an entre with just the shrimp over angel hair pasta with sauted summer squash, spinach, and french string beans and I have to say my company was very impressed! The sauce is wonderful, light, slightly sweet and very delicate, perfect over pasta. I doubled the shrimp and sauce recipe and there was plenty for 6 to go around! It is worth the little effort of time and dirty pans. Will make it again easily!

Despite the number of pans to wash, this was a big hit. I served it over toasted nine-grain bread; the pretty rounds of salmon are worth the little bit of effort.

If you appreciate the joy of cooking, you won't think this dish is too labor intensive. Very good results and a hit . I made these with salmon filets and skipped the string tying method. I placed the truffles in the sauce. Wonderful sauce.

This dish is labour intensive but so worth the effort. The shrimp sauce is to die for - even if the method seems a little bizarre.

this dish was incredible and i didn't use the salmon or the truffles...replaced the cognac by ordinary brandy and served the shrimp and sauce over pasta...couldn't see my way around deveining the shrimp with the shells on so i sauteed the shrimp peeled and the shells next...easy...served it with fresh grated parmesan and the pepper mill to rave reviews all round

I made this twice so far. A very impressive company meal. My mother made it for her gourmet club and they all loved it. Left out the truffles...couldn't find any, but I can't imagine it could taste any better. Also used salmon fillets, so I avoided the salmon prep steps. Used a pound of shrimp, but it didn't really need it. Even my 13 year old told me it was one of his new favorites.

My husand and I have devoted Saturday nights to trying new recipes and cooking together. We made this recipe just this past weekend. Because there were two of us cooking, we didn't find it time consuming as some had. My suggesting, bring in your partner, pour two glasses of wine.... and enjoy your time preparing as you will most certainly enjoy the results of this recipe. Delicious!

WOW! This sauce was out of this world! I skiped the truffles all together. Don't skip the shrimp butter, it really makes the sauce great. I made this for my boyfriend who is a chef, he said I would get an "A" in his sauce class!

This dish has a wonderfully exquisite flavor and makes for an incredibly tender salmon. It can be much easier to make by skipping some of the steps. I left out the truffles and didn't blend in the shrimp shells either. I bought shrimp that was already deveined and used toothpicks to hold the salmon together not having any string on hand.

This was really delicious but ALOT of work for the result. Wish it could be a tad less fattening though...

Truly spectacular! Time consuming but many steps easily done ahead of time. I omitted the truffles all together and still loved this tasty and well-presented dish. (With no truffles, I sprinkled fresh chives on top before serving!)

Heavenly, lush, scrumptious are a few terms to describe this dish. We adapted it for an entree for four. We did find that you need one whole bottle of wine for the sauce. We used truffle oil in place of expensive truffles.

While this dish was time consuming, it was very much worth it. The reaction on my guests faces was incredible. You could just tell they loved it.
