I've done this twice now. Once with canned pineapple and once with fresh pineapple. I believe the canned pineapple was better as it was more sweet. I also found that peaches worked slighly better than papaya. All in all a great recipe and complement to the chops

I made this last weekend to accompany the Teryaki Crilled Park Chops. This relish is simply OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! We all loved it. And I used CANNED pineapple! Can't wait to try it with fresh!!!I doubled it, thank goodness, but also doubled the garlic (4 cloves for double recipe), and it was perfect. Didn't measure anything...just winged it. I am making it again this weekend to accompany grilled bean burgers and hot dogs, and intend to add fresh cilantro. Oh, I did not wear rubber gloves...didn't even notice that until now! I did make it the day before, and I highly recommend that if you can, because it gets better with time!

I served this salsa with smoked pork and smoked turkey. Everyone agreed it was better with the pork than with the turkey. It would probably also be good with fish. I added some mango and used cilantro instead of mint. Very good!

So delicious! My friend had a backyard smoker, and smoked a turkey in it. When I showed up with the relish, everyone snarfed it down with the turkey. I think just about any meat could benefit from this heavenly relish.

Very good over grilled salmon, everyone(we made it for a staff party 100+ people) loved it.

try some chopped jicama ..about1/4cup and squeeze 1/2 lemon in this. I also like chopped cilantro added for color & flavor. This is good with many grilled meats. enjoy.
