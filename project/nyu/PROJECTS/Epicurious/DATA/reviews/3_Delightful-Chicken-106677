A good idea bit a bit bland. I've tried 2 alternatives that really make it pop. 1) Double the dressing. Marinate the chicken in half for several hours in the refrigerator. Season and grill the chicken instead of braising it. 2) Add a couple tablespoons of fresh herbs to the dressing. Use your best extra virgin olive oil. Emulsify in a blender with a bit of the cheese before assembly. Both work well and add a great deal of flavor.
