I have made this so many times I have lost count. It is tasty, a crowd pleaser and easy to make. What more can you ask for. If I could I would give it 5 forks!

Great weeknight (especially summer) dinner! Mayo has lots of flavor. I grilled the chicken breasts.

These are quick and wonderful! I pounded the chicken thin between wax paper, marinated for an hour in lime juice and olive oil, then cooked on the grill! The mayo was the best - make extra for use on steak sandwiches, burgers, etc.! My husband, who is NOT a mayonnaise fan, couldn't get enough of it.

i have made this twice now and love how easy it is to make... not to mention the picky eaters in the family like the spread too...

I made this recipe twice, once as is and again with changes...I prefered the changes. I used blanched asparagus instead of the tomatoes...the tomatoes were too messy, sliding out..the asaragus gave a wonderful crunch and flavour, as well as colour. Instead of the heavy bread I used wraps. I also cheated with the chicken and purhased a roasted chicken from the grocery store deli. Fast Easy and Delicious.

This was easy and delicious! I was really lazy and used packaged Louis Rich grilled chicken slices and jarred roasted peppers. This would be even better doing own peppers however. I will definately experiment more with this recipe!

Easy & just yummy. I've made it several times now - I rub chicken breasts with lime juice & olive oil then grill. This last time I also grilled some baby portabellas & stuck them in there too. YUM.

I enjoyed this sandwich and thought it had just the right kick to it. I did the peppers the day before along with the sauce. Will make it again.

Terrific. Used jalapeno because I could not find chipotle chilies. Chili Manonnaise was just great. I would use lettuce rather than the mixed baby greens - too many flavors were getting mixed in.

I used grilled garlic bread. The mayo-chilies dressing is what makes this great.

I made this for 16 people on Mother's Day. Everyone loved it since then I have made this 2 other times and given the recipe out to many people. We are going on vacation and I was asked to make this! Just remember to tell people the mayo has peppers in it... my father in law thought it was thousand island dressing! He got quite a shock when he dug into his salad!!

Great! I wasn't expecting it to look as beautiful as it did and the flavors are just great. I used all arugula instead of mixed baby lettuce. My chicken was very pink after 10 min so I would just adjust the cooking time in the future.

BRAVO! The best sandwich I've ever had. Even my finicky children liked it. For three of us, I cut the recipe by 2/3 and used a smoked Ancho chili instead of the chipolte. Vine ripened tomatoes were a perfect compliment, although we ate them on the side (sandwich was too big).

This was wonderfull. I grilled the bread to lightly toast it. Spicy and very tasty!

This was wonderful! I used smoked tofu instead of chicken, and the results were excellent. It was easy to make, and my guests said that I rock!

Very good sandwich - I used jalapeno sourdough bread and plain Monterey Jack cheese. My husband thought I was crazy when I was charring the peppers over the gas flame on the stove, but he loved the sandwich!

I made this for a summer luncheon when the recipe first came out and everyone loved it. A great make-ahead if you cook the chicken and then reheat it in the oven or grill to melt the cheese. I did notice the serving sizes were huge, so next time I'll cut the recipe down by 1/3. I'll also used jarred roasted red peppers and save some time.

Grill the chicken instead of broiling, then slice and place on tin foil to melt the cheese on the grill.

I have made these sandwiches numerous times but have always made them on croissants. I have also used jarred roasted red peppers in a pinch. Skip the soda - pour a nice chardonnay!
