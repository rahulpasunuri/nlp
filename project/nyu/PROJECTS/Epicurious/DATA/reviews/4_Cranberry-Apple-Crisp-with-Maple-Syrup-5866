I have made this for Christmas dinner several times. It is easy and a very colorful desert that everyone loved.

Per some of the other suggestions, I tweaked the topping- 1/3 c. flour, 1 c. oats,1/2 c. chopped toasted pecans, and 1/2 c. sugar (I don't like my desserts too sweet), along with the remaining topping ingredients. I kept the filling as written. It got rave reviews! And it is soooo simple to prepare!

Excellent bright flavors- great fall dessert! I am not a big fan of regular apple pie- it is just too sweet for me. BUT the addition of cranberries moves it to the top of my list. Just made this and it got rave reviews. I followed some suggestions for the topping- 1/2 cup each of flour and oatmeal. I also decreased the brown sugar in the topping to 1/2 cup. Super simple with great flavors...and pretty, too!

This was all right but not exceptional. I used the whole 12 oz. pack of cranberries, minus the ones that had gone off, and upped the sugar and syrup a bit. The result was still too tart, but I think it probably would have been better if I'd had fresher cranberries to work with.

Great recipe. A very sweet-tart dessert. Big hit at the dinner party.

After doctoring the topping to make it more crumbly/crisp, this was fantastic (reduced flour to 1/2 c. and increased oats to 1 1/4 c). I used whatever apples I had on hand from our apple-picking outing and increased the maple syrup to 1/2 c. Yum!

Very nice. I have been making apple crisp for many years, but the cranberries are a great new addition. To prevent the topping from getting too dry, I would recommend only about 2/3 cup flour. And I used macintosh apples and canola oil rather than butter, but no substitutions on the pure maple syrup (especially here in Vermont)!

This was very easy to make. I used Empire apples and doubled up on the topping and it came out absolutely delicious.

This review is for the filling only... and it was FANTASTIC! Beautiful and tasty with the lemon zest and cranberries. This was a great way to use up leftover cranberries lingering in my freezer.I think this would even be good served without a crust topping, as a compote/ applesauce kind of affair. Will definitely make again. My 3 yr old loved it.

I took my fellow New Englander's advice and used a topping from the other apple cran recipe. It had less flour and more oats, which I like better. I omitted the cranberries and added more apples. All I had was sugar free maple syrup so I used that and added some maple extract and doubled the brown sugar in the filling. It turned out fantastic! My husband can't get enough of it. Next time I will use REAL maple syrup and that will bump it up to 4 forks.

As a life long New Englander, (and lover of anything apple, cran, or maple) I have to say that this apple crisp was a real dissapointment. Admittedly, the apple/cran/maple filling was a good balance of sweet and tart like the other reviewers said, but the topping was much too dry and floury. Certainly not crispy, more like crumbs. The topping from the other cran/apple crisp on this site is MUCH better. Blech, won't make again.

Delicious recipe! I eliminated cranberries(didn't have any) and baked in an 8" square dish. I love crisp topping, but a stick of butter felt too sinful, so I used only half a stick and reduced the dry ingredients just a bit. It was still awesome and I served with vanilla ice cream.

Oh mama this is good. When I first read the recipe, I thought "eh" looks easy, probably will be just okay. It's really really good, however! The maple adds a buttery-licous-ness to the apples and cranberries that is dee-lightful. Next time, only thing I would change is to add some toasted pecans to the topping and to make MORE.

Delicious! I was fresh out of cranberries, so added more apples. Also added 1/3 cup chopped toasted almonds to the topping.

The grin on my husband's face gave this a big thumbs up. Since he's from Minnesota, I wanted a very basic apple crisp and since we live in Hawaii and don't have cranberries, I didn't include them. Excellent for a basic apple crisp recipe. The fake maple syrup did just fine - there's so little of it I don't see how using real would improve it - although if I had real I'd try it to see. But even with the cheap store brand syrup the taste is a knockout. Thanks again, Epicurious. (And thanks to Firefox for deleting all the darn popups).

Second time I've baked this crisp and doubled the recipe this time = after 24 hours, there was nothing left! I made a whipped cream with real vanilla beans, simply amazing! And as for maple syrup, you really need to get the real deal, table syrup won't do it..

One of the better crisp recipes I've tried. This one actually came out with a 'crisp' top. The cranberries add a nice tartness.

I live in an area where there is an abundant supply of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, cranberries, etc., and I am always looking for another good crisp. This was comfort food at its best....simple but elegant enough to serve to company. I did not have enough apple, so I added some frozen blueberries. The ice cream was a perfect companion. If you think the cranberry is too tart, just add a bit more brown sugar. As for using "fake" maple syrup....I have to disagree (strongly). I was born and raised in Quebec and when you have grown up with the "real" thing, the fake stuff doesn't even compare, by a long shot! If you can afford it....use it!!!!

This deserves more than two forks, but not quite three. I thought it was fine, but perhaps my preference is for a less tangy crisp. I also ate this without the vanilla ice cream, so I had nothing to "tone" it down. I'm going to try another crisp, one without the cranberries.

Made this for our 34th Anniversary last night, and it was excellent. Served it with a high quality vanilla ice cream. This time of the year I am always looking for ways to use our bounty of Winesap apples. So, since they are more tart than Granny Smith's, I increased the brown sugar to 3 Tbs. in the filling. Accidentally used a scant 1/2 tsp. salt in the topping, but it didn't seem to matter. Did sub 1/4 cup of chopped, toasted walnuts for 1/4 cup of the flour in the topping. (Also, I used "fake maple syrup" for the real thing. The recipe for Maple Syrup is on the box of McCormick's Imitation Maple Flavoring. My husband and I have taste tested (side-by-side) both the real McCoy and the Imitation in recipes, and we both think that the fake stuff is better tasting! If you package the hot cooked fake stuff in a SUPER CLEAN glass jar with a tight fitting lid, it will last almost forever on the shelf.) This is a VERY YUMMY CRISP!!!

Really yummy. Used cranberries that I'd had frozen (leftover from the holidays), and they worked fine. I didn't have Granny's so substituted Macs, and it was still fabulouse. Served with vanilla ice cream, and there was none left!

Very delicious! I would give it a 3 1/2 fork. Good combination of sweet and tart.

Really delicious, just the right balance between fruit and crisp topping, tart and sweet. Great with vanilla ice cream. Will make many times again, I'm sure.

This crisp was a great end to a meal and delicious as leftovers, either hot or cold. The tartness of the cranberries is balanced by the maple syrup; they absorb moisture and then pop pleasantly in your mouth when you eat them. The lemon zest also adds a lot.

I missed the fresh cranberries by one month, so I substituted a half package of frozen pitted cherries.which I had thawed. I took it to a dinner party and everyone loved it! It was very easy. I'll definitely make it again with either the cranberries or the cherries.

Home Run! I don't think I'll ever resort to making plain apple crisp. Who knew the cranberries could be such a great addition, and maple syrup ... but of course! Especially delicious served warm with Vanilla ice cream. Microwave it the next day - if there are left overs.

This yummy dessert is easy to make the day before you need it and can be popped into the oven just before sitting down to dinner. Frozen Vanilla Yo-gurt or homemade vanilla ice cream add the perfect touch to this tangy-sweet delicacy.

Made it especially for my husband, who absolutely loved it served with vanilla-flavored whipped cream. Definitely comfort food, great on a snowy night.

I made this as a warm side dish for part of a brunch. The flavors all blend so well - and the tang is delightful. Don't save this just for dessert! I used freshly sliced pears for half of the apples. Warm from the oven was great, but I reheated what little was left the next day, and that was great too - so it qualifies for a "do-ahead" dish!

Just the perfect way to end off a meal! This dessert is easy to make, and tastes great. Great combination of flavors and textures. I've made it many times, and everyone loves it. Best served warm with vanilla ice cream. Try it and enjoy it!

The combination of tart cranberries and slightly sweetened apples was perfect. Using real maple syrup avoided the oversweet taste inherent in many apple crisps. This is going to be a classic for me to be repeated often.

I love apple crisp and this is the best I've ever had. It's tart because of the Granny Smith apples and cranberries with the topping as a perfect sweet complement. It's also quite easy to make. I plan to make this again and again.

Wonderful. At first I thought there was way too much topping and I wasn't going to use it all, but I'm glad I did because once the apples cook down some more, it is just the right amount. You MUST serve this warm with vanilla ice cream. I served it to my in-laws and they loved it - my MIL even asked for the recipe! A keeper.

It is a great dessert for any occasion. It tastes great and has that special kind of zing to it. It is so easy to make, and does not take to much time at all.

This is the best apple crisp ever! I took this to a friend's dinner party one Friday, and it was so well received that I made it again for another friend the next night! The first time I made it I accidently used 1/2 STICK of butter instead of 1/2 cup, but it turned out great anyway. I also omitted the cranberries and substituted lemon juice for the lemon peel. It turned out perfectly. It's especially good served a little warm w/ some vanilla ice cream.

Delish filling, I wasn't too crazy about the topping, because I didn't find it crunchy enough. The second time I made it I used more oatmeal and replaced the flour with oatbran. It was perfect.
