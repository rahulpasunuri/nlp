I make these potatoes all the time and they always taste great. I use Yukon Gold potatoes as they have the best texture for roasting. To keep the potatoes from sticking, I spray a little Pam on the bottom of the pan before putting the potatoes in. It really keeps the potatoes from sticking and it does not alter the flavour. The rosemary butter at the end is a must, in my opinion.

Until this point, I haven't had much success with any of epicurious' non-mashed, smashed, or pureed potato recipes. The recipes involving roasting or frying potatoes have always turned to big piles of mush. Not this one. At first, I thought the 500 degrees would be too high, but it was perfect. I ate them reheated, and though they lost their crispiness (as is expected), the flavor was wonderful. Additionally, check the heat rating of your parchment paper before using in this recipe: mine was only rated to 400 degrees, so I lines the pan with foil, rinsed and dried the potatoes, and used a liberal amound of oil. Not one of them stuck. :-)

First I wrap the potatoes in plastic film andf put them 8 minites in microwave 8 minutes. I then cut the wedges, cover generously with my preferred herb and small butter pieces.Then to the oven.

The key to not having the potatoes stick is to use parchment paper. I loved the potatoes and served them with a rack of lamb. Wonderful

Here's a trick to keep the potatoes from sticking to the pan (besides adding more oil, of course): once cut, rinse potatoes in cold water. This removes the outer starchy layer that causes the sticking.

i love this recipe. i added cheddar cheese after pouring the rosemary butter over the potatoes. it's great!

The flavor was wonderful. However, even with the olive oil, the potatoes will stick, leaving presentation lacking. Further, it is too labor intensive while you will obviously be working on an entree. I would look elsewhere.

Tasty potato wedges! In my opinion, they needed quite a bit more salt after they came out of the oven. I used russet and red wedges, and they both tasted great!

really really enjoyed this recipe and for an amateur like me, i love how simple it was to make. i would recommend greasing your roasting pan A LOT cause the potatoes stick and become hard to flip. also, i tried both russet and red potatoes and the latter came out a lot tastier. i didn't feel the butter added much flavor, so i think it's fine to cut the butter out and just use the rosemary with the salt, pepper, and olive oil.

Taste really good and look very attractive when the rosemary butter is poured over!

Quite good. Nothing terribly unusual, but quite good. I'm sure I'll make it again.

Easy and excellent. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but then added extra rosemary and some caramelized onions at the end. Delicious!

This is a quick and easy dish that will make everyone happy. It has a lot of flavor but can still be considered mild for picky eaters. Be sure to use fresh Rosemary, it makes all the difference.

I used red skinned potatoes, because that was all I had. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Delicious!

Many people have included their rave reviews about these potatoes in their comments about the recipe for filet mignon with orange fennel crust, but I am happy to start the compliments directly on this page. These potatoes are a perfect side dish! They're delicious and simple. Perfect texture, with the crunchy exterior and creamy interior, and the drizzle of rosemary butter at the end is a wonderful accent!
