Full Disclosure: I changed this recipe quite a bit to fit what I had on hand: 1 3/4 pounds of regular white baking potatoes rather than new potatoes 1/3 cup of chopped shallots instead of green onions 4T sour cream instead of yogurt 1 tsp herbes de Provence instead of caraway 1 tsp prepared horseradish + 1 tsp coarse grain mustard instead of 4 tsp horseradish (which would have been WAY too much for me, but I'm not a huge horseradish fan) Used turkey kiebasa, and sauteed the rounds in cooking spray for about 5 minutes to brown them 1 oz Gruyere + 1 oz Parmesan, grated over warm potatoes, rather than 5 oz diced Gruyere mixed into the dressing. Okay. That's everything. That said, this recipe was super delicious. The reason I'm not giving it 4 forks is because I feel that the potato-kielbasa ratio (or at least size) was a little off. Sliced potatoes break into chunks in potato salad, so the kielbasa should have been cut to approximately the same size as said potato chunks. Instead, the rounds were bigger and didn't mix in well. Also, as other reviewers have said, it definitely needed more vinegar. I thought sour cream instead of yogurt would take care of the acid, but it wasn't enough. Overall, though, I'd say it's a great summer meal, with fresh crusty bread, as suggested.

This is a good alternative to typical Kielbasa recipes. However, I am not going to make it again. It is a good summer dish. It was easy to make, so I am not going to really complain about it.

A great twist on any old standard. The only change I made was to brown, drain, and cool the kielbasa before adding it to the potato mixture. I think this enhances the flavor of the sausage.

This is a fantastic summer meal! The only change I made was to use baby Yukon Gold potatoes. I did not peel them. Too hot in the summer to bother with that! Otherwise, I made it exactly as listed. I let it sit in the refrigerator overnight. I loved the dressing. I am thinking of what else I can use the dressing for in other recipes. This is one of the best potato salad recipes. Plain old potato salad just isn't good any more after eating this.

Great the next day, although I was not nuts about it on day one. I used fennel seed, celery salt, and cavender's seasoning instead of the caraway, and a good bit more vinegar than was called for.

Excellent !! But I used more vinegar, horseradish and green onions, used sour cream instead of yogurt and grated the Gruyere so it "melted" into the dressing.
