Made these exactly to the recipe with yams and they were fantistic, colorful, and hearty.

These potatoes were very good! I used small red-skinned potatoes (quartered) since that's what I had in the house. Will make again.

This is a great recipe. The potatoes come out crispy, delicious and a beautiful color. Just have to watch out that they don't get too dry.

It was good but nothing ground breaking. I might make it again but I am more likely to try other seasonings

Followed the recipe exactly - and apart from a bad burn on my arm pulling them out of the oven - they were fantastic! My guests raved over them. I tripled the recipe, split amongst two pans (hence the burn) thinking I'd be able to use leftovers for hash browns the next morning - there were no leftovers.

these were delicious and easy - they disappeared - I added whole garlic cloves

Wonderful, roasted potatoes with either Yukon or Russets. I add a little rosemary and garlic to the seasoning, plus increase the balsamic about 1 tablespoon. Really the perfect steak fries.

I used baby yellow potatoes with great success. Make sure the potatoes all get coated with the balsamic vinegar or else they are bland.

I used russet potatoes instead of the yukon gold and they tasted delicious! I will add more balsamic vinegar next time since I didn't really taste it (although my husband said he could).

Alabama cook: Someone has to say it-you must not be a very good cook. I don't know what you are doing wrong. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED these potatoes! I used Yukon Golds and cut them into 1/2"-3/4" wedges. They were CRISPY and yummy.

I tried this recipe twice and both times it came out absolutly horrible. First I cooked it exactly as the recipe stated, and they came out mushy and almost like a baked potato. So I tried it a second time, and this time at the end I moved the rack to the middle and turned on the broiler, trying to crisp them up a little. But again they turned out mushy in the middle with a thin layer of papery like skin. My family and I love balsamic vinegar, we use it when ever we can, and on this I feel that it should have been used as a condiment rather than in the cooking. As it is we have been burnt on it and I won't put my family through this again. Sorry, I hate giving bad reveiws, but somebody's got to admit it.

I did this as my contributon at our family Christmas Eve dinner (with stuffed veal chops) and had to provide the recipe to everybody. Now they've requested it for Easter dinner as well. Easy and tasty. Goes well with steak or roast.

Delicious and easy. Good choice for any balsamic vinegar fan. When serving I drizzled a bit more vinegar on the potatoes. Yummy! You must use the Yukon Gold potatoes. The buttery flavor is a must.

A nice variation, will make again. Once I added the balsamic I turned the broiler on to crisp up the fries again.

Great recipe, and genuinely easy. The balsamic gives it a caramely taste that makes it seem more fattening than it actually is. (I've found you can reduce the amount of oil here as well).

As a vegetarian, I added onions, carrots and cheese and used this as a main dish. The dish is reminescient of simple french food. A marvelous gratin-roasted and crisp on the outside-melt in your mouth delicious on the inside. We love this dish!!!

This was a solid potato dish. Couldn't be simpler. The balsamic gives it a slight twist that grew on us. I might prefer potatoes with rosemary but that wouldn't stop me from doing this again, maybe with a different type of potato next time.

Super quick and easy. Great change from standard (but good) garlic/rosemary/etc. style wedges.

Rating: 4
Never thought I could make wedges but hey they came out fabulous! At one point I was worried that they wouldn't be cooked through because of the short baking time and then I was worried that I wouldn't be able to take them off the tray cos they were stuck. Finally, they were cooked to perfection and taking them off the tray was a game.

I liked this recipe. Simple and tasty. I added a few slices of fresh red bell peppers and they roasted up nicely with the potatoes..and looked pretty too. A bit of chopped parsley before serving and that was that.

We usually roast potatoes in wedges like this with rosemary and/or thyme and/or parmesan and I did not like this as well. The vinegar took away the crispness we prefer.

Rating: 3
This went over well - I left them in for an extra 5 mins before adding the vinegar, and an extra 15 after adding the vinegar to get them crispy. Very easy, tasty, different. I would definitely make this again.

Sorry, I guess I just don't get this recipe. It was okay and I make potatoes similarly (without the vinegar, with thyme and fresh parmesan), but not something I'll add to my collection.

We make roasted potatoes in a well-seasoned cast iron skillet...with or without the peel. They come out extra crispy and delish. I think, though, that I prefer adding vinegar afterwards.

I thought this was a good side dish for a weekday meal. It was simple, taking very little prep time, and tasted good with our hamburgers that we cooked up on the BBQ.

The balsamic is a nice addition to the standard roasted potatoes that I usually make. This recipe works well with sweet potatoes, carrots, parsnips, etc

Rating: 3
My whole family enjoyed these potatoes. I cut them into eighths instead of fourths and baked them a little longer than suggested after adding the vinegar. Be sure to toss them well both before the original baking and again after adding the vinegar to distribute the flavors. I might also cut back on the salt next time.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I forgot to sprinkle again with the balsamic but the roasted in flavor was delicous. I roast yukon golds all the time in just olive oil and salt - I enjoyed the twist

Rating: 2
This was only OK, but some of that was my fault. I baked these at a decreased temp., as I was also baking an oven fried chicken dish at the same time. Even though they didn't crisp up properly, they were too heavy on the balsamic vinegar and salt. Next time I would bake them at the high temp., decrease the salt by 3/4, and decrease the vinegar by 1/2.

This is a delicious way of fixing the omni-present potato. It was subtle and unexpected; my guests commented on it, but didn't know exactly what gave it that slightly sweet/sour taste. I think it's an excellent addition to the family cookbook.

These were great, even my 8 year old son ate them without being prompted. (Potatoes are not his favorite) Served with salmon. The vinegar on them were great.

"Sprinkle" and "shake pan" doesn't do such a great job of distributing the vinegar evenly. Taste of just OK.

This was excellent! A great finger food for football parties. Try it with sweet potatoes - that is also delish and healthier too!

I've made this several times, with and without the balsamic - I could eat myself silly on these. They are so easy and go with just about anything! And McDonalds? Please. This site is for people who eat real food.

These were soooo good! And easier that falling off a log. The balsamic added and roasted at the end makes all the difference.

This is the only way I cook potatoes anymore, and is popular with both kids (crunchy outside)& adults (reasonably healthy). It works nicely with redskin potatoes, too.

After reading all the reviews I figured I had to give it a go myself. It was just ok. I don't think I'll be tempted to make it again - ah well.

personally, for me a good recipe for potatoes is more than welcome, I am always looking for new ways to make a french fry that is better healthwise for the body that those fast food fries. I agree with the fact that you can use another vinegar you don't have to use balsmaic, but I do not agree with the brown sugar, that made it too sweet.

OK. I made this because I was upset with the prior reviewer, and I thought it sounded good and easy. It was pretty easy, but just mediocre! I love my chips with malt vinegar, but this just didn't do it.

Hm, have not eaten at McDonald's in years (I prefer "Grown-up" food) but I don't remember their fries being this good! Served this with roasted chicken and vegetables and it was well received by my family and guests.

Big deal, can go to Macdonalds and pourEnglish malt vinager on the fries. My favorite. Much easier and same result without the hard labor. If you do not have Balsamic vinager, use a bit of brown sugar in the recipe. Use any vinager at hand.
