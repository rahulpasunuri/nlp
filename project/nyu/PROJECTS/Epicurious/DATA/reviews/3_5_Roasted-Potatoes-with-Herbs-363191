These were delicious! My herbs burnt, but after had a crispy texture that was still interesting. When I make these again, I may turn my oven a few degrees lower. Yum!!

These are delicious and easy. I was looking for a simple roasted potato recipe to accompany the Bootlegger's Beef from this site (amazing, by the way!!) and these were exceptionally good! When you first mix it up, it looks like it will be way too herb-y (I was regretting not keeping some plain potatoes aside for my kids) but they roast up beautifully and it ends up being just right! Be sure to use a generous amount of the coarse salt - delicious!

Super simple, super yummy. Key is using awesome heirloom fingerlings - I used a trio, including purples, that were divine. I did not need as much time for roasting either - check often to make sure you do not over cook. Gets an A- for flavor, a B+ for texture (could use some crunch), an A for inexpesiveness, an A for ease of preparation, and a B+ for presentation (when using the tri color potatoes). That gives the recipe an overall grade of A-. Wonderful!

At the last minute, as I frequently do, I looked up a recipe for roasted potatoes. I didn't have the fresh herbs so used dried. I didn't have fingerling potatoes so used a mixture of red, purple and yukon gold new potatoes. I quartered them and they baked in about 30 minutes, were nice and crispy, and a great side dish to grilled chicken. Next time I'll plan ahead so I have the fresh herbs on hand, but it's good to know that dried herbs worked just fine.

Tasty recipe that I've made more than once. While I make less than the 3 lbs of potatoes called for in the recipe, they definitely didn't need to cook for more than ~30-40 minutes (and were well-browned).

Made this for dinner last night and my husband loved it! I only used 1lb of potatoes and baked for about 35 min.

These were so simple they practically made themselves. I went a little heavier on the garlic & rosemary. They were perfect with the roasted chicken I made. I think next time I'll make these with red bliss potatoes.

Yum! It's kind of hard to go wrong with garlic, fresh herbs and potatoes. This was really tasty. As usual, when making something for the first time, we followed the recipe exactly. When remaking the next time, we would probably decrease the oven temp just a bit, the herbs got a bit burnt or charred. We served this with the Pork Tenderloin with Roasted Apples and Onions recipe at this site... which was just okay.
