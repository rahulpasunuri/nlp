Nothing special & cooking the fruit beforehand is more complicated than a standard cobbler recipe. I'll use my cobbler recipe & add some cornmeal to the dough.

This was simple, quick and delicious. Made it for a family barbecue with a side of vanilla ice cream/ cool wip and got raves. Even the kids gobbled it up. Nice that it can be made ahead. I too used prepared pie crust and it was great. Will make it again.

Anyone who makes this will be a rock star! My mother and I made this on a Saturday evening to take to a family picnic the following day. The shared experience of making it with her in her kitchen was partly why I enjoyed this dish so much, but I also made it my own and impressed even my incredulous aunt, who couldn't believe that I made it myself from scratch. First, I upped the amount of fruit a bit to 4 pounds or so (7 medium to large peaches which we peeled, 3 large pluots, and a cup of blueberries) so I used 1/3 cup of flour and a cup of sugar because of the extra fruit and I know my family likes it sweet. I for one liked the additional flavor from the almond extract, and I also added zest from a single lemon. Second, instead of cream I used lowfat vanilla yogurt because Mom didn't have any plain; I also did an egg wash since I didn't use any cream. Because I'm also comfortable making my bisuits in the food processor, I did so here as well. When the dough came together, I stopped the machine tapped it out by hand and used a small fluted biscuit cutter that yielded 24 mini biscuits, which was perfect because I was cooking for a crowd. This smelled so delicious baking and when it came out of the oven I almost cut into it right then. I loved it, my family loved it, and I've already volunteered to make it for my co-workers while peaches are still in season! I think next time I won't bother pre-cooking the fruit on its own though as I just don't think it's necessary in a 400 degree oven. But kudos on this one!

I only had peaches on hand and didn't think peeling was necessary. I also omitted the almond extract as I'm allergic. This was really good and made the kitchen smell good too. So easy and fast to make. I took the leftovers to work today and it was gone in 10 minutes.

easy to prepare and everyone liked it...didn't have time to roll the dough, so just divided into eight pieces and shaped by hand.

prepared this with an assortment of stone fruit picked up at the farmer's market this morning - plums, pluouts, and a couple varieties of nectarines. Omitted the almond extract. The fragrance while it was cooking was incredible, and the flavor was great. I think my fruit was a little too ripe, though, so it softened considerably during cooking. Probably best with not quite ripe fruit.

well i tried something a little different, i used frozen fruits like peaches, blueberries and raspberries, i let them thaw and then mixed in all the filling stuff, and instead of making my own crust i bought a package of flaky butter buiscuits and used that as the topping, taste great, oh and i also omitted the almond extract

Super easy recipe. I used nectarines and plums. I omitted the almond extract - it didn't sound good and I didn't want to detract from the flavor of the fruit. I used unripe, very hard fruit which kept the texture perfect after baking and the flavor nice and tart. I also reduced the sugar by 1/2.

very easy and delicious. I used peaches (did not bother to peel them and it was still fine) and plums. I don't like things too sweet so cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. Next time I will omit the almond extract as I found it detracted from the pure fruit flavors that I love. I like the crispness of the biscuits- they really hold up to the fruit without getting soggy. Overall, a great summer dish that lets the fruit shine through. When my guests saw it, they wanted to skip dinner and go right to dessert.

This a good way to use ripe cherries, plums and nectarines in one dish. The cornmeal scone like biscuit is so good. I added 1/8 cup sugar to the topping mixture.
