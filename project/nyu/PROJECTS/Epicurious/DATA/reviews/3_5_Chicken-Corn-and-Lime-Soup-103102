No forks given since I did not follow the recipe exactly. I used less garlic, a fresh tomato sitting in the fridge, fresh corn (yum!), & rotisserie chicken. A nice, quick rainy-day meal good w/ rice or bread. I did not have cilantro or lime, but I'm sure those with some sour cream would have elevated the dish.

I thought it was great- worst part was cutting up the chicken but - get over it nanc! Didn't use any chili's because we don't like spicy and it still turned out plenty tasty!

The liquid portion of the soup was too runny. I'd suggest a dash of corn flower to thicken the soup. Other than that, it tasted great!

Great soup, however it doesn't taste as good the next day... probably because the lime loses its kick by then. I'd make it again, but a smaller portion.

My new favorite chicken soup recipe! I made it for a quick lunch for houseguests and it was gobbled up. I substituted bouillion cubes instead of the canned broth.

Good soup. The lime really pulls it together. Add lots of black pepper.

really good, esp if you have fresh, ripe tomatoes and fresh corn. I used serrano chilies and part of an annaheim.

A delicious recipe. By a happy accident, i was out of ground cumin, but i had some whole cumin seeds which i toasted in a small cast iron skillet and ground in a morter. I added about twice what the recipe called for and it delivered a smokey and dark soup which I'm still enjoying days later. Yum!

Yum! I made this tonight to feature some fresh corn that I needed to use. I added some diced carrots and potatoes, since I had them, and a little ancho chili. It was hearty, healthy, and delicious. Can't wait to taste the left-overs

I was out of cumin, but this stilled turned out flavorful. I took the advice of other reviewers and sauted the corn and chilis in olive oil. I also used chicken breast because my family doesn't like dark meat. Next time I will try the bacon fat tip provided by the other reviewer.

It was easy and flavorful. Does not take too much time to prepare the ingredients, and even less time to cook. Unfortunately I forgot the cilantro which I'm sure would have made the dish absolutely perfect.

Yummy and wonderful - even when low fat. I made it even LOWER fat by throwing it all in the crock pot, with fat free chicken broth. AND I still loved it! I used a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce isntead of jalapeno which gave it a wonderful smoky flavour.

This dish is bland to some people because the amount of fat is too low. 1.5 tsp of veg. oil isn't going to flavor anything. I eyeballed enough fat to saute the onions, but it must have been at least 3x as much as called for. I used a mix of butter and bacon fat. Wonderful. As others did, I sauteed the chiles and the (fresh) corn before adding the stock, and used more chiles. A huge hit.

I love this soup! This is what I always make when anyone is sick. One bite and I feel healthier. I do spice it up by adding lots of fresh chilies and chipotles. It has tons of vitamins and good for the sinuses too!

This soup was so quick and easy to make. It's also very low in fat. However, the flavor is not outstanding.

I made this recipe two weeks ago and brought some of the left overs to work for my lunch the next day. My co-workers all tried it (I did not get any of it that day) and they have begged me to make it again for our luncheon tomorrow. This soup has amazing flavor and is easy to make. Certainly a winner in my book!

This is a really yummy and easy soup. I used fresh corn instead of frozen and homemade stock and it was FABULOUS! Just a hint on the technique of adding the cumin and jalapenos. When the onion is almost done sauteing, reduce the heat and add the chilies and the cumin - allow them to saute a few minutes before adding the tomatoes and corn - the flavors become much more pronounced! YUM!

This is a nice twist to traditional chicken soup. I used 3 skinless boneless chicken breasts. Quick and easy for a weeknight and great the next day for lunch!

I added some peas for color and extra cumin, salt, pepper, and chopped serrano peppers for kick. The recipe was easy and the soup was perfect for a cold rainy evening!

This soup really hit the spot last night. It's perfect for someone who is dieting - like me. I slicd up 2 chicken breasts instead of the chicken thighs. I usually increase the amount of lime and peppers that any recipe calls for, this time I didn't and it came out perfect!

Yummy! I've made this twice. I use homemade broth and add bay leaf, a little dried oregano, extra cumin & plenty of salt. I also use pickled jalepenos. The flavor is great. I break up ready-made corn tostada shells into the soup. They hold up in the liquid & add nice texture. This recipe is a keeper!

An easy soup to make but just so-so. There are others that are better and just as easy. I added brown rice to make it a heartier meal.

Substituted the (un-Mexican) chili powder and added dried chile arbols and canned anaheims (fresh peppers would work, too) and used only half a lime, which was plenty. Good, easy soup.

Yummy. I used a concentrated chicken stock, not canned, and simmered with the lid off to intensify the flavor. A really flavorful (and spicy!) soup.

Excellent and easy!! Great work day dinner! Used baked corn taco chips crushed over top. Lime flavor very distinctive - a great twist!

I agree that the soup was a little bland. My husband thought it was very good, however. I have been thinking about making it again, but adding some prepared salsa.

My family of 5 gave this dinner 4 forks. We all absolutely loved it, even the kids (ages 3,7 and 10). I did make a few changes since my kids were going to be eating it too. I left out the jalapenos, added another bag of corn and used tomato puree instead of tomato strips. I also served it with rice. It was a big hit!

I found this soup to be tasty. However, I added a bit more lime juice and cilantro, which helped bring out the flavors in the soup.

It was pretty bland for my tastes but my husband and father-in-law loved it. Next time, maybe more jalapeno ...

You've got to love how healthy this soup is--too bad it tastes so bland. If you add the tortilla chips it does have a nice flavor, but then you've lost the low-fat, low calorie appeal. But without the chips, it's pretty bland--which was a surprise considering the jalapenos and cumin.
