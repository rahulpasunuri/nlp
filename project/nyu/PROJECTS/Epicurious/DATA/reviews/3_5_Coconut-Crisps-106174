Even my coconut hater liked these. I sprinkled unsweetened coconut on each unbaked crisp then a drizzle of honey over that, turned out great.

Quick, easy recipe that is a massive crowd pleaser. I have made a diabetic version using spenda and aside from the gas, it was a winner! Also, for those that don't like coconut,slivered almonds are delicious as well. Highly recommend.

Following the previous comment about the crisps not being 'substantial' enough, I layered 4 phyllo sheets and was liberal with the sugar. My friends enjoyed the lightness and crispiness of it all.

I took the coconut crisps to a dinner party and one woman there just loved them. The rest of us were sort of ho-hum about them. Their flavor was okay, there just wasn't enough to them.

These are really great and very easy to make. We purposely left a few uneaten because I wanted to see how they would store in a can if I made them for Christmas cookies. All I can say is that they lasted fine for one day in the can. We ate them, and the experiment ended. I guess I'll just have to make some more.
