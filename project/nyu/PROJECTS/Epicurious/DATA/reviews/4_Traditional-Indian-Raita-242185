It was so good, but I used mint instead of cilantro. Very cooling very good.

I usually grate the cucumber and let it drain in a collander before using. I prefer to use finely chopped mint instead of cilantro. Refreshing as a dip for some grilled naan as well as a condiment for lamb kebobs.

This is the perfect Raita! It's very easy to make and is delicious. I make mine with fat-free Greek yogurt and chop my cucumbers very fine.

Delicious and goes very nicely with the ground coriander/cilantro flatbreads. Unfortunately had to use dried cilantro as it was all I had on hand at the last minute. I also threw it into the mini-processor to make it a finer consistency. Make more than you think you need as this is addictive...

This was a big hit at a party I hosted and so simple to make. I chose to use greek yogurt for some extra tang and thinned it out with a little regular plain yogurt. Delicious.

really nice with the coriander and cilantro flatbread. I may finely dice my cucumber next time as it was too big to stay on the flatbread without falling off.

Simple and very good. Choice of yogurt definitely matters, I would avoid low-fat or fat-free yogurt for this recipe.
