My husband made these this week and they were amazing! I think some of the folks who were worried about the crumbly top didn't see that you were supposed to glaze them upside down. Very attractive and very rich tasting-- would make a great dessert to serve to guests with some fresh raspberries or shaved white chocolate on top. Another reviewer mentioned serving them in a bed of blackberry cream-- which sounds like a fabulous idea to me.

Excellent rich, fudgey, flourless, gluten free mini choc cakes. Used ghiradelli bittersweet choc chips and added in slow stream with mixer on low. Used regualar sized, ungreased foil cupcake liners in muffin pan and turned them upside down while cooling. Delicious glaze covers natural cracking/falling of this cupcake after cooling for a pretty presentation. Foil peels right off. Large group of teenagers loved them. Made them again to try (usually never serve 1st time without having sampled) and my daughter, husband, and myself thoroughly enjoyed them. Yielded 24 cakes in regular muffin tin using about 1/4 cup batter per foiled tin.

I make these easy cupcakes with my mini cupcake maker often. Each time I am even more impressed with the outcome.

These cupcakes were fantastic! They were so easy to make and had such an incredible chocolate flavor. Very rich! Easy to make. They do form a crust which rises up and then falls. You have to take your time removing from the pan, but it was not difficult.

These are super easy to make and really chocolaty. I used ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips rather than chocolate bars (much less expensive) and they came out great. Instead of the glaze, topped with cream cheese frosting. Since I used convection bake, only baked for 9 minutes.

I made exactly as directed, but I had a problem no one else seems to have had; the tops had a thin cracked "crust" on them. It was like there was a crust, a pocket of air, and then the cupcake. The crust just cracked right off. They were not pretty. I used half bittersweet chocolate and half semisweet. While I normally like bittersweet desserts, even using half semisweet, this was too bitter for me. A disappointment!

Easy to make. My two year old cracked the eggs (but didn't separate) and worked the mixer. They are delicious. Our addition was to substitute 1/4 cup of powdered sugar for regular sugar. We are trying with raspberry jam for a glaze and fresh raspberries in my toddler's classroom. Used Caillbaut chocolate. On overfilled cups they were a little gooey at 12 minutes, but with correct filling amount, perfect. The slight goo was actually wonderful when warm. Really delicious AND a wheat- and dairy-free desert!

These were easy to make for someone who doesn't bake very often and they were delicious. I brought them to two separate parties and everyone loved them. I used Bittersweet Chocolate from Trader Joe's.

This recipe might benefit from a little bit of flour because although the cupcakes were very rich, the consistency was almost pudding-like. I had to put them in the fridge for three hours to firm up.

I'm a big fan of flourless anything and this is no exception. I axed the chocolate glaze and topped my cupcakes with a Swiss meringue that I took a torch to. It was almost like eating a s'more cupcake.

This is a great recipe. It is rich and chocolatey. It is quick and easy to whip up. The best part is it is gluten free!!

Easy and very moist. I added chocolate shavings to the cupcakes after I dipped them into the glaze. (milk chocolate, bittersweet chocolate and white chocolate)

I made these for my wife's birthday; used Giradelli bittersweet chips; everyone loved them. I recommend serving with vanilla ice cream; we love Starbuck's "Mocha Chip" ice cream and this was a great accompaniment as well. Will definitely make again; very easy.

these were great, and so easy. I made the batter before dinner and popped them in the over just after, so they hit the table warm. I made a raspberry sauce (frozen raspberry, sugar, lemon juice) instead of the cream topping.

These are super-rich, decadent mini-cakes that goes great with a nice cup of coffee for dessert. I would also add some fruit (raspberries or strawberries) for color since they're not much to look at otherwise. True chocolate lovers will really enjoy.

Rich, dark, and fantastic. They were more like individual cakes than cupcakes, and they were perfect. Very sophisticated look and taste,very dark chocolate and yummy glaze as well. Since I made these I have also made many variations of the glaze (different kinds of chocolate, a little peppermint extract added) and put it on everything from cakes to fresh strawberries. I've memorized the recipe!

This recipe was great, but my family had a hard time with them because they were so rich. I added 1/4 cup of sugar to the glaze mix to sweeten it. I also pureed blackberries, rasberries, and a 1/2 tsp. lemon juice with 3/4 cup sugar, and then strained the seeds. I placed a puddle of this under the cupcakes on each plate and placed a few white chocolate swirls on top of the glaze. It looked wonderful. If I make this desset again, I will add more sugar to the original recipe and less chocolate in the glaze. The berries complimented wonderfully!

These tasted like really good brownies. I did overbake them though in error. At 12 minutes they were not done, and the extra 5 minutes I gave them was too much- making them very difficult to remove from the muffin pans. This, of course, destroyed the whole presentation as they were now a huge mess on the plate. I skipped making the sauce and we just enjoyed these very chocolatey brownies. There are much better recipes out there for flourless chocolate cake.

I didn't have enough muffin pans so I used ramekins for the remaining batter. The ramekins stayed soft-centered and tasted fantastic without the glaze. All were eagerly devoured.

I have made this recipe many times. I always use Scharffen Bergen chocolate. I also have made it in square cupcake pans and it looks great!

I've made this recipe several times and each time all of those who've tasted it have enjoyed it very much. In addition to the chocolate sauce, I usually serve it with good vanilla ice cream. I think it's pretty easy too!

Admittedly some of my guests really like this recipe, but I thought it was too dense. In my view, it didn't work well to have no butter in the actual cake recipe.

I absolutely adored this recipe! I made it for my family (4 people) and by the end of the day, they were gone. I recommend this recipe to any chocolate fan!

I made these cupcakes for a little dinner party and everyone loved them. Made them a couple hours ahead of time and then I whipped up the sauce/topping at the last minute. I used Valhrona bittersweet chocolate - I think that using the best chocolate is crucial to making the cupcakes amazing and not just "brownies."

The recipe title is soooo deceiving! This is a fabulous dessert. I served it on a bed of blackberry cream and topped w/ shaved white chocolate and a fresh berry...I got RAVE REVIEWS! (I made a little extra of the ganache,and used every bit of it)

Very much a basic rich brownie recipe put into a smaller space
