I made this for a summer baby shower and it was a HIT with all the ladies! I omitted the shrimp and shallots because I ran out of time, but added shredded carrots and sliced bell peppers. The chopped peanuts were on the side.

Great Recipe! I used only the Chicken and added red pepper strips. It was easy to follow and was a refreshing lunch. Plenty left over to bring to work for lunch tomorrow. I will make it again!

Terrific. This recipe just needed a little tweaking to be fantastic. We added chopped garlic to the dressing, cut the noodles and used thin rice noodles instead, increased the proteins and bean sprouts, finely chopped both jalepenos and serrano chilis. We'll make again for company and plan to do a Thai coconut or sweet and sour soup to start with a mango rice pudding for dessert!

We really enjoyed this salad, I made it with left over beer can chicken and fresh herbs from the garden. I recommend letting this sit for an afternoon to allow the flavors to "marry" I also used fresh homegrown tomatoes that I sliced and seeded. Fresh ingredients make the difference!

Absolutely crap. Waste of good ingredients. That's my final verdict. I chucked the lot.

Bland. I'm going to see if left-overs (a mountain of them) taste better and get back to you!

This is such a quick, easy recipe. If you have time to run to the grocery store, then you have time to make this. Shopping + chopping = less than 1 hour. It's new and delicious and healthy. I use much less noodles and more chicken than recommended, but it's a pretty flexible recipe.

I wrote the review below, but now feel compelled to update it and add another fork for one reason: This salad is much, much better the next day. After refrigerating overnight, the flavors really came together and made for great left-overs. However, next time I'll omit the shrimp (don't think they were necessary) and jalapenos, and instead add some hot sauce.

I was so looking forward to this, and it just wasn't as good as I expected. There were too many noodles, or not enough dressing... I'm not sure what the problem was, but it was bland. My go-to Thai take-out place does much better.

Basil and Cilantro..two of the most absolutely disgusting things in a recipe, and not good combined. Yuk.

Wonderful combination, lots of flavour.

Delicious! I double the sauce and use the extra to saute the shrimp in.

add a little chopped garlic to the dressing, cukes can be left out as well as sprouts if unavailable. Chopped tomatoes work just fine.

Very good! I had no trouble with the bean threads at all-I suspect it was the brand the last reviewer used, rather than the recipe. I did rinse the noodles-I always rinse rice and bean thread noodles after draining.

Rating: 2
The flavor of this recipe is deserving of 4 forks, but the bean thread noodles were a gelatinous mess (and I left them in the water even less time) than recommended. Will try again with thin rice noodles or angel hair.

Great for a light dinner or heavy if you go big on the meats. I only changed the amount of sause.

This was easy and sumptous! I omitted tomatoes, shrimp and used a sugar substitute to makeit diet-friendly and it was still fantastic!

I have made this recipe several times and love it! I do not add the chicken and I saute the shrimp in olive oil and crushed garlic first. The fish sauce (nam pla) is the source of sodium for this recipe so if it tastes "boring" you can always add more. I usually make 1 1/2 times the amount of sauce.

The best sweet chili sauce is from Thailand and Mae Ploy brand is a good one.

This is some great food for summer. It helps to sautee the shrimp in vegi oil with a touch of seasame oil, salt and pepper. If you don't like this recipe, I say you're a coward.

Fresh mint and basil really make this recipe. I doubled the ingredients to feed 4 people. The dressing isn't potent enough, so be prepared to add extra Thai sweet chili sauce at serving time. You don't need the jalepeno if you're using more chili sauce.

This recipe is awesome! I could not find sweet chile sauce the day I was shopping, and used hot chili sauce....definitely jacks up the heat factor! I would omit the jalepeno if you try it this way.

I agree with the review below that the shrimp could have more flavor and i too will saute my own next time. ...however, i do not agree that it was "boring". THis is a great summer salad and has many layers fo flavors...goes great with a chrispy Chard

. . . Note prior review - I meant to say that HALVING the amount of fish sauce would work just as well, particularly for anyone not accustomed to the aroma/flavor. . .

I've made this twice now, with simple rice noodles, and it's been magnificent both times. I like fish sauce (nuoc mam is what I used) but I found that doubling the amount serves just as well (actually I double the rest of teh sauce ingredients. I've also found that this recipe takes variation well. The second time I couldn't get my hands on basil but the cilantro and mint was still great. I've also added fresh assorted mushrooms. The cucumber gives it a great crunch and I haven't even bothered with the peanuts. I like really spicy foods so i've chopped 3 whole jalapenos into it and flavored it to taste with sriracha sauce (the one with the rooster). This is a great recipe that you can play around with. Extra lime juice also worked well.

This recipe was lackluster, bordering on BORING. It needs the 4 flavors- salt, sweet, hot and sour to make it work. If I were to make this recipe again I'd definitely stir fry the shrimp in a hot/sweet sauce to give it some pop and more lime!

Though it took a bit of prep work I found this to be delicious. The dressing was wonderful and the entire was so refreshing. I used rice noodles since they were what I could find and they worked well. I ate over half of it myself. Will make it for company next time.
