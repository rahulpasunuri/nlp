I'm a breadophile and a huge fan of eating pizza crust, but this recipe's ratio of crust : toppings was WAY too high. Hence, extremely dry. I agree with A Cook From Atlanta that the salmon and dill sauce would be much better on Wheat Thins.

Easy and delicious! Used dried dill, light sour cream, and added some capers to the dill cream to give it some zing. Paired with a salad for an almost effortless weekday supper.

The dill cream was fresh and delicious. I think I would actually make this again and skip the pizza dough. Just serve the smoked salmon with the dill cream on crackers or toast points as an hors d'ouvre.

I loved the dill cream. This is also a nice appetizer when cut in small squares and served cold.

The pizza is decent, but not all that exciting. I think adding parmesan to the crust makes it a little more interesting.

Really fabulous as written

Disclaimer: I was never a big fan of smoked salmon prior to making this. Actually, the only time I would eat salmon was when I ate sushi - I just didn't like the taste of cooked salmon. This recipe has totally changed my thinking on smoked salmon, it was that good. But to be fair, I'd probably have to chalk up a big part of its appeal to the quality of the salmon, but the dill cream was a perfect accompaniment. Highly recommended for lunch.

Yummy, quick and super easy. I used wheat pizza dough which came out pretty nice as well as crumbled goat cheese instead of dill cream. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious. I used light sour cream and dried dill (1 1/2 t) for the Dill Cream and it was very good. I prefer to put slices of salmon over the pizza instead of covering it.

This is so easy and absolutely delicious. I have made it several times and everyone loves it. I add capers, chopped cucumbers and tomatoes to make it a fun breakfast pizza.

The crowd went wild...this one was easy & excellent, light and every last bit disappeared. Would be a unique appetizer.
