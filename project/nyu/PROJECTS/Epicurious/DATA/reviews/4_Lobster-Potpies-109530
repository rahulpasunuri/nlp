This is time consuming, but it is worth it. Light and delicious.

this recipe came up in a search for tomato and bean recipes. I am sorry to say, it is not what I was looking for. I do not know what has gone wrong with the site's search engine. Apologies to readers wishing feedback on this dish (I assume the "review" will not be seen.})

"Slow-cooking" a lobster (i.e. steaming them or placing them in water that is brought to a boil) is inhumane, period, even if they've been in a refrigerator or placed in a freezer for a short period of time prior to cooking. I don't care if they have a primitive nervous system; the point is, they HAVE one, and should be cooked and consumed with humanity and respect. There are two humane ways to cook a lobster: one involves a meat cleaver and is not for the faint of heart. The head of a live lobster is decapitated, its body split open, and then cooking is commenced. The other way is to plunge a live lobster into water that is at a fast boil. The lobster is braindead in two seconds and completely dead within five more. There is no scrabbling around in the pot, and the whistling sound that is sometimes emitted after submersion in boiling water is NOT a lobster screaming in pain. It's the sound of air escaping the gills. I am not a vegetarian, and I'm not a member of PETA - I eat meat, poultry, fish, and seafood; but I'm completely enraged by misinformed (and sometimes cruel) individuals who espouse cooking or slaughter methods that are essentially torturous to an animal.

Concerned about the lobster? Lobsters are believed, by many scientists, not to feel pain, due to their primitive nervous system. An hour before cooking, keep the lobsters in refrigerator. They will be in a deep state of sleep. Remove them from the refrigerator just before cooking. This is also good cause their tails don't twitch when cooking. I heard you can hypnotize them too?! Experiments at the University of Maine determined that: - Boiling in the traditional manner causes a lobster to begin activity in 5-10 seconds and continue for 1 - 1 1/2 minutes. - Hypnotizing the lobster by holding its head down and rubbing it nearly doubles the length of time it moves. - Slow heating in salt water from room temperature results in increased activity when the water reaches a temperature of around 30°C/86°F. This activity lasts 2-3 minutes and then subsides. - Pot steaming seems to reduce the activity of lobsters. However, lobsters at the top of the steam rack may still be alive after 20 minutes when large numbers of lobsters are being cooked at once unless the steam is retained in the pot. - Chilling/icing before cooking, by placing the lobster on ice or in a freezer (but not freezing it) delays the onset of activity about 30 seconds and reduces the duration of movement to about 20 seconds. - Visit for more details at http://www.lobster.um.maine.edu/index.php?page=22 Visit seafood recipes at http://knapkins.com/dishes?cat=seafood

This is a lot of work and appropriate only for a special ocassion, but is truly DELICIOUS! Some changes I made to make it a little easier: puff pastry (purchased) instead of the potato rolettes, two live lobsters to make the broth with some good quality fish-stock purchased at Whole Foods; steamed lobster tails to provide the rest of the meat (I doubled it for 9 people). Baked at 350 in a convection oven for 40 minutes and it was simply divine. This can be made the day before and topped with the puff pastry, refrigerated (covered) and baked when guests arrive. I truly loved this.
