Deliciously light flavor. Go easy on the dijon if limes aren't in season, as the flavor can overwhelm the lime. I also went a little easy on the evoo, only adding about 3 tablespoons. I added avocado and sliced red bell pepper and everyone raved about the salad. Definitely a keeper in my house!

This is an excellent dressing, but it needs more lime juice (2 T), and is best with light olive oil, not extra virgin. I also added diced jicama and tomatoes to the salad, and it was a huge hit!

I made it with fat free mayo and a little less oil, a little more garlic. It is very refreshing, and with my modifications, very low in fat, yet decadent like a ceasar. I also add toasted sliced almonds, green apple and avocado. Yum! Can't wait to make it again tonight.

we have served this recipe several times this year, in several combinations. regardless of season, the lime was refreshing and made the salad seem light, and was most joyfully received in cold weather.
