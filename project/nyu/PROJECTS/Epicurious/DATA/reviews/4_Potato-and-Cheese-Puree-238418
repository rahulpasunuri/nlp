Had these at a dinner party over the weekend. They were amazing! Highly recommend them!

Ridiculously decadent and tasty. Pouring the cream on top and broiling seemed strange as the cream was just liquid on top. Next time I will incorporate the cream with the potatoes and broil for a nice brown so everything cooks together.

We love this recipe!!! I made it from the magazine once, then panicked because I couldn't find it again, am so glad I did. We just mash the potatoes, don't have a ricer, and make in a glass or any old pan, and still everything is exceptional every single time. YUM!

OK...the picture does not do the dish justice. Well&and putting whipped cream on mashed potatoes seemed wrong too, BUT...DO IT! I had to boil the spuds early in the morning, they cooled more than recommended while son was as basketball, riced them and reheated, mixed in the cheese then put into casserole dish and put in fridge till afternoon. I pulled them out and put them in 300 degree oven to reheat while I prepped another side dish. Took both to a party and again put in warm oven to hold before topping with the whipped cream/horseradish mixture. It started to melt right away and it browned nicely. Still not a beauty, but gosh it sure tasted awesome and got rave reviews! Make this one.
