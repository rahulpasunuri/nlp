What an intense flavor the sauce has! It is perfect with the oranges. This dessert is awesome and the simplest preparation ever. A crisp cookie would be a nice accompaniment.

This is an "omigod." I've made other orange salads inspired by middle-eastern cooking (as I presume is the case for the this recipe)-- including one where the primary flavoring is orange-blossom water, and one where it is rose water. I like them all, but the pomegranate molasses and honey combination adds a deep note above which the orange soars. Superb! --I would love it if the reviewer below who mentioned the NYT recipe would clarify: does the recipe referred to use pomegranate molasses PLUS orange blossom water?

I have made this recipe a number of times, always with fabulous reviews. I use blood oranges in season as they aren't as acidic and the color is gorgeous. It is a perfect ending to a heavy meal.

While I've come across this as a result of searching for uses of pomegranate molasses and lamb, I am definitely going to use this dish again & again and not just as a dessert - it sounds entirely like an explosion of flavours! I will use the agave nectar on hand in place of tupelo honey . . . its simplicity will be perfect for so many dinners. A small mint stem as garnish will be added sometimes, too.

I have been making this for years - recipe from NYTimes Magazine is better Use 12 blood oranges,( or cara cara and regular oranges mixed) instead of cinnamon and salt use one Tblspoon orange blossom water, also sprinkle with some chopped pistachios and chopped mint
