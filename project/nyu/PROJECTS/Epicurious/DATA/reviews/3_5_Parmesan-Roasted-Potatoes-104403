This recipe has been a staple of mine since the late 1980's. I keep the potato chunks about an inch or so square (to absorb as much yummyness as possible), put the parmesan in with the flour and seasoning mixture and toss together, put into a baking dish with any remaining flour mixture sprinkled over the top, then dot small pieces of butter over the whole thing. About 4 Tablespons. Maybe 5. 1 stick of butter for 8 potatoes is obscene! Stir the potatoes a couple of times during cooking, but not towards the last part of cooking or they'll break. You're also going to need a lot more salt than a teaspoon for all those potatoes. The seasonings used are limited only by your imagination.

Very tasty, but too much butter. I greased the dish with olive oil instead and only used half a stick of butter, otherwise the potatoes swim in it.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe. I printed out Shana's suggestion for the directions, and even amended those a little bit to make it even easier. Here's exactly what I did: Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Scrub and dice the potatoes (I like to leave the skins on), and toss them in a large ziploc bag with the melted butter until they're well coated. In a bowl, mix the parmesan, flour, salt, and pepper. Pour the mixture into the bag with the buttered potatoes. Shake really, really well, for at least a minute or two, until it's all very thoroughly coated. Dump it all onto a cookie sheet covered in parchment, and spread out so it's only one layer. Bake for one hour.

I served this dish for Christmas and it came out very well, it ended up being my personal favorite dish of the day. It also continues to be delicious as a leftover, especially if you add some fresh parmesan cheese when you reheat it.

Good recipe.I parboiled whole potatoes 3 mins, cross-hatched surfaces with salad fork, dipped potatoes in cold water, then proceeded with recipe .. turned out perfect.

I took Shana's advice and did the shake and bake thing with the zip locks. Everything stuck and roasted nicely. The flavors were nice, but I think I will seek out another roasted potato recipe next time.

This has the potential to be a great dish. The ingredients are almost spot on, but the instructions are off. Do yourself a favor. Melt the butter in a bowl. Dice the potatoes (smaller is better!) and toss them into a ziplock baggie with the butter. Shake it up. Toss the other ingredients into another ziploc. In small batches, take the buttery potatoes and shake them around in the seasonings. Then, bake on a cookie sheet covered in parchment. ALOT more cheesy stuff sticks this way. If you have leftover cheesy stuff, just sprinkle it over the potatoes before baking.

I think the key here is getting the breading to stick to the potatoes, as other reviewers mentioned. I tossed them lightly in olive oil and tried to press as much cheese mixture onto each piece before placing it into the pan. It was a little time consuming, but it worked and my family loved them. Also, be sure to turn the potatoes at least once during cooking so they will brown on all sides. I will definitely make these again. I'm just glad there was no calorie and fat information included. It would spoil all the fun, I'm sure!

Great recipe. I think the potatoes need to be turned occasionally. I did cook them at a higher temp (400) based on others' suggestions. Served this with Roast Pork Tenderloins with Cranberry-Port Sauce (recipe on this site - also excellent), so I added sage & thyme to the potatoes to bring the flavors together.

Marvelous! I made sure the potatoes remained damp so that the parmesan mixture would stick (and it did). Used Yukon Gold potates. My guests raved!

Hate to be the spoiler here but this recipe just didn't work for me. The potatoes ended up dry and all the yummy parmesan stuff didn't stick to the potatoes and was left at the bottom of the pan. I was thinking it might be better if the potatoes were tossed with the butter (or olive oil) before coating them with the flour and cheese. Don't know.

This is a terrific recipe. I served it with the beef tenderloin with cranberry and port sauce with gorgonzola also on this site. Amazing and simple!!

It's great with tenderloin easy to make ahead of time. Love it

These potatoes were terrific. I didn't allow enough time to air dry the cheese for the full hour. I dried them for perhaps a half hour. These were very good anyhow! Nice and brown and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

This was easy and delicious. The potatoes were very crispy and brown on the outside and tender on the inside. I even used plain old packaged parmesan cheese instead of fresh grated because I was in a hurry. I would recommend sprinkling some of the leftover cheese mixture over top of the potatoes before baking if you find it didn't stick really well. Not low fat - but that's why they taste so good!

This recipe was simple but very good. It cooked perfectly according to instructions and I even had it sit in the oven for 20 extra min. w/ the temp down and was still fine! I used salted butter and I thought it still needed a little more salt and a little more parmesan cheese. I also added fresh parsely. We had it as a side dish for Mother's Day dinner and all had good things to say about it , 1 person even asked for the recipe. I would definately make it again.

good and simple potatoe dish. Very easy. I added some extra butter on top. I used peeled red potatoes and they came out very cruncy and browned on the bottom. I would make them again.

A definite keeper. Used unpeeled Yukon Golds, dried the cheese for several hours, and they were brown, crispy outside and soft inside - terrific. Guests loved them. I sprinkled the excess cheese mixture over the potatoes in the pan and potatoes picked it up as I turned them.

These potatoes were very well received. I did not have the time (or organization skills) to air dry the cheese, so I dried them in the oven. Drying the cheese is a necessary step.

Made this recipe with Yukon Golds and left the skins on.....terrific! Will definitely make again...probably tonight!

My wife, who is not wild about potatoes, thought these were the greatest, and I liked them too. I ground fresh Reggiano, and it needed all of an hour in this dry New Mexico air to dry out enough to stick. A couple of hours might be even better if you have the time. I served the potatoes right away, but imagine they would hold fairly well.

I liked this recipe because the potatoes had a nice cheesy taste without alot of cheese on them. The dish was also very easy to prepare. I thought the dish was too buttery, so when I make again, I will reduce the butter by about half, and possibly try to coat all the potatoes with the butter before baking, rather than having it all sit on the bottom as the recipe states.

Yummm!

These potatoes were very tastey and so easy to make. I cut the potatoes into rounds and left the skin on, which made them a bit more elegant. I also added a pinch of garlic and sprinled parsley on top before serving, which added to the presentation.

Yummy!I loved these potaoes.I thought they would be really greasy because of all the butter they were cooking in but they weren't at all!They were crispy & delicious.Will be making these a regular for dinner at our house!Guests were impressed too.I made them with Grilled pork chops with classic bbq sauce(also from this site)& some steamed broccoli & carrots.The whole meal was a hit!

Very good, indeed ... and so easy to make! I used Yukon Gold potatoes and didn't bother to peel them, since I like the skin. Everyone liked them very much, and I served them with a pork tenderloin. I don't think I'd make them for a formal or holiday dinner, unless there were some kids coming.

An excellent family dish, my kids love this one. The first time I made it, I didn't dry the cheese and so it didn't stick well. The second time it was perfect. Served with a roasted chicken and steamed veggies, this recipe was yummy.

My husband loves potatoes and these became his new favorite, but I wouldn't make them for Christmas they go better with something like meatloaf or swedish meatballs

I used Pecorino Romano cheese instead of Parmesan and it was wonderful. I will be making this again.

I lost track of time and cooked these a little too long, in my opinion. My husband and guests loved them. I thought they were too crispy, like hash browns. I will try them again.

I agree with the the Hawaii gals response. Good, but nothing to rave about. I too made it for Christmas and it was like fries. Maybe good for a regular dinner but not for Christmas.

This recipe was ok, but not fantastic. I made it for Christmas dinner and basically it was like thick french fries to me. It was really easy and the cheese was nice, but something was missing for me. It think it needs some kind of spice...not sure what, though. Any ideas?? Aloha from Maui.

Oh my gosh! These are delicious. Everyone at my dinner party remarked that there was never a reason to ever eat regular roasted potatoes again. And I didn't peel the potatoes, so they were super easy to make.

This is an easy and tasty side dish which is good served with roasted meats and is an excellent substitute for fries.
