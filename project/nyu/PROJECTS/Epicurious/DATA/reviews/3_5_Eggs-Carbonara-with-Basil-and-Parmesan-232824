Interesting Mixed Reviews. I tripled this recipe for a large group, though I cooked it in 3 separate pans. I thought it was so-so. Some people raved about it. I'd make it again and add more garlic and basil, and perhaps use low fat soy milk.

Nothing special. When all is said and done, it's just scrambled eggs.

My husband and I both love this dish. For the two of us I just cut everything in half and often use plain soy milk instead of the heavy cram. Also fresh basil is so much better than substituting dried.

These eggs were great. I forgot to add the minced garlic and decided to substitue a pinch of sprinkled garlic powder on finished eggs and ended up being fantastic. The basil was wonderful with this dish. I grated a fresh block of parmasian to make sure it was soft and did not deter from the consistency of the eggs per comments from last reviewer. I would make this dish again!

I thought it was nothing special. I felt the cheese gave it a heavy texture rather than light and fluffy as I think scrambled eggs should be. There are better egg dishes out there.

just had to mention..."carbonara" is actually in reference to the pepper. 'carbone' being italian for coal. it's what the italian coal miners used to eat, hence the black specks!

The dish is great just how it has been written. Better than a quiche. And by the way, "carbonara" means the addition of bacon, not having spaghetti in it nor the way it was traditionally cooked.

I made this 'exactly' to the recipe and it was delicious. Can only suspect that the reviewer who didn't like it used different ingredients or just doesn't like eggs. I plan to make this for our Christmas morning breakfast with sourdough toast.

I feel bad for this recipe. Thanks to most of the previous reviewers, it's taken a bad rap. This is actually quite delicious with a pretty presentation. Excellent choice for guests. I had some straggling, end of the year basil that needed to be used up, and this recipe was perfect. Use freshly grated parm for all the difference. Good stuff-and easy!

Really didn't like this. Very unsatisfactory.

To the SF bay cook: "alla carbonara" (over the coals) refers to the way it was traditionally cooked. The classic creamy sauce includes eggs and bacon. Sounds delicious!

Where's the pasta??? I thought carbonara had spaghetti in it.
