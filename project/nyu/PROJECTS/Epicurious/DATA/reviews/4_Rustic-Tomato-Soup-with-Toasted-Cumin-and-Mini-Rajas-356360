I made this for friends and it is very good, they liked it a lot. Simple to make and a nice presentation with the rajas.

This was good for a quick tomato soup. This recipe does make quite a lot of soup! I'm thinking I can freeze half of it and use it later, maybe as a base to add other ingredients. Hmm...

Great soup. I used a rich veal stock and a seeded ghost chili for more heat, but otherwise didn't alter it. For those with ingredient issues...Amazon has EVERY spice, pepper, etc.

"Rajas" are chile strips, fried tortilla strips are called "totopos."

I really liked this soup. It has a nice smokey flavor (the achiote paste? the guajillo chili?) with a kick. Perfect for a cold winters night.

"Achiote paste," a.k.a. recado rojo, can be made at home. There are as many recipes for it as Central American cooks. Here's one: Toast 1 chipotle pepper (smoked jalapeno) until dry, cut in half with scissors, remove stem, cut up into tiny pieces. In a cleaned coffee mill or spice grinder, grind 2 tablespoons annatto seeds, then the chipotle pieces, to a powder. Combine with 1 teaspoon cumin powder, 1 teaspoon allspice, and a pinch of nutmeg. Store as a dry powder, or mix w/water to form a putty and freeze in tablespoon-sized portions. I often use it as a meat marinade, by mixing 1 tablespoon with 1 crushed garlic clove, 4 tablespoons Seville orange juice (or 1:1 orange juice and lime juice). But I also use it as a wonderful twist on classic North American winter recipes, as it is used here.

This is delicious - a different twist on the normal tomato soup. I made my own achiote paste with a recipe from thespicehouse.com because my grocery store didn't carry it. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.

This sounds super. That is, I imagine it would as written. However I cannot get either of the * ingredients. What can I substitute that would be taste alikes? I can get Jalepano, Banana pepper, sweet Bell peppers and Scotch Bonnet here. Also of course cayenne, ancho and chipotle in powder. I have no idea what the seed is. Thanks Ma_am northern Canada

It is a nice alternative to your everyday tomato soup and quite easy to make.

This soup turned out quite well and was a wonderful hot and spicy soup for a winter evening. We didn't have the achiote paste so it was substituted with a little adobo sauce from some leftover chipotles. Also, I accidentally misread the ingredients and doubles the amount of guajillo chile, which was perfect for a hothead like me, almost too much for my girlfriend. Either way, this is probably going to end up a staple at our house. Went really well with a few homemade corn tortillas I rolled out earlier in the day.
