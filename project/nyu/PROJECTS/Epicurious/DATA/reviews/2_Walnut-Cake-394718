I don't understand all the negative reviews. We loved this! It was a huge hit. Super moist -- almost custardy. Given the richness, it doesn't need any garnish. The raw sugar on top adds a lovely crunch.

We loved this! I served it to a group of moms at a morning meeting. A bit of Greek yogurt on top was great. I made per instructions except I ground up all of the walnuts into a powder. It is not like a traditional cake.

This "cake" reminds me of the filling of a Swiss nusstorte. If you are anticipating a Costco birthday cake type product, you will be disappointed; if you enjoy a very rich, European-style nut delicacy, you will not be disappointed. Very easy to make; too easy to eat.

I too was very disappointed by this cake - my hopes were high because the accompanying article makes it sound like a sure fire winner. I followed the recipe, except that I toasted the walnuts and used low-fat yogurt. The result: well, it was moist and not particularly greasy but it was completely uninteresting otherwise. The end result is so much less than the sum of its (delicious) parts. Part of the problem was the lack of sugar (sprinkling sugar on it afterwards didn't help) but I could have lived with that if the flavour had been good. The walnut really needs something else (cinnamon? orange?) as others have commented on. The vanilla and almond are completely overwhelmed by the walnut. Either the Danish palate is very different from mine (British) or something got lost in translation in this one.

I made this cake because our family loves walnuts, and the ingredients looked promising. The cake baked beautifully and looked just as pictured. I agree with the other readers that the end product was lackluster. For my taste it was bland, heavy, and too expensive to repeat.

I am going to go with the others who said this cake was too expensive for being so lackluster. Mine came out incredibly dense and moist, almost like a custard. It was so rich that I could barely eat a one inch square. I had thought that toasting the walnuts or adding some maple flavoring might help, but it just doesn't seem worth the expense to try and make it again.

Made this with hazelnuts as I had lots of ground hazelnuts on hand. It is a different cake than most of us are used to. I agree that it is really nice with coffee or tea. And I think it picked up flavor over time. Skipped vanilla bean and just used extract and some Frangelico. Substituted ground hazelnuts for almond flour and for 5 of 7 cups of ground nuts.

I make a lot of recipes from this site. This is the first one that has compelled me to write a review. It was not moist, had no flavor and was costly. Two thumbs down from my walnut loving husband.

Was excited to find a protein rich cake and since we are walnut lovers I could hardly wait to make it. followed recipe exactly. Found it heavy, bland and lacking flavour. Maybe it should have had some lemon or orange zest in it. I flavoured the whipped cream topping with grand marnier-our guests were gracious enough to say they liked it. No body asked for seconds and I sure wasn't tempted to eat the left overs. Expensive to make, not worth it. Not a cake, not a loaf, not a square- so what is it?

Despite all of the very expensive ingredients this cake was very, very bland - almost tasteless:(

I have made this cake twice now and everyone I share it with gives it rave reviews. It isn't super sweet, which makes it a nice breakfast with coffee as well as a dessert with whip cream. It is quite dense with a great nutty texture and the raw sugar on top and bottom give a sweet crunch. I didn't find this cake to be at all greasy nor did I find the instructions unclear in any way. I totally recommend it!

I was extremely disappointed with this very greasy creation.

The recipe says to coarsely chop all 7 cups of walnuts, then set aside 2 cups of the coarsely chopped nuts. Add the flour to the remaining 5 cups of coarsely chopped walnuts and grind that mixture to a powder. Sorry, no review--I don't have a food processor so I can't make this.

@ Angelheart2, First you chop all 7 cups of walnuts. When chopped, you add the flour and then process until they are ground. It states that in the directions.

it does not say how much of the 7 cups of walnuts is to be ground up and how much is to be chopped.
