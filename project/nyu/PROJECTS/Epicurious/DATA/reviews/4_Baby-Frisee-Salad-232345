This was a very good salad, and my family enjoyed it as a first course for Christmas. I have a few critiques, though. The beets are roasted in a liquid (jam), and this makes them sort of wet like canned beets instead of that hearty roasted winter vegetable type of roasted beet. The dressing is a bit too sweet for me, and way too oniony from the shallot. Also, the shallot made the dressing very chunky even though I diced it very tiny in the cuisinart. I liked the salad, but next time I think I will roast the beets with just some oil and reduce the honey and shallots in the dressing by half.

my family loved this, even the skeptical college age kids finished every single bite. This was their first experience with beets and the beets were a hit. Easy to make. I used baby arugula because I had it on hand. And it is good with any beets.

I have made this superb salad twice since my review below. This last time I used organic dandelion greens instead of frisee, and their tangy bitterness was the perfect foil for the sweet beets. Also used pepper-crusted goat cheese and rather than pecans, I sprinkled with toasted pine nuts (love their rich/creamy texture) and they were an outstanding accent for the other ingredients. This salad is such an amazing composition of opposite flavours/colours/textures that enhance each other to create harmony on the plate and palate. Can't say enough about this superior recipe, one of the best on this site!

I decided to try this dish only because someone gave me a bunch of beets, and I had almost all the rest of the ingredients on hand. It is really wonderful! I used fig preserves, and I used what I think are called candy-stripe beets because that's what I had. The only ingredient I lacked was the right cheese, so I substituted some shaves of white Irish cheese. Also, rather than combine all the ingredients in a bowl, I plated the frisee, then topped it with the beets and drizzled on the dressing before adding the pecans (didn't want them to get soggy). It is delicious and beautiful, with a great interplay of sweet and spice. And I wasn't sure I even liked beets!

Delicious, delicious, delicious! Very eye appealing and a lovely melange of complementary flavours and colours. Rather than fig jam, I used Stonewall Kitchen (Maine) Vidalia Onion and Fig Sauce which contributed outstanding flavour. Instead of dicing the beets, I halved and sliced them, and used only red beets as golden not available. Also, I did not combine/mix the salad - individually plated the frisee then topped with beets, pecans, cheese and drizzled the dressing over. I think if one tossed the salad as directed, it would have a very unattractive/muddled appearance and everything would be stained by the beets. An excellent vinaigrette with good bite/zip from the mustard seeds, which I toasted to intensify the flavour. Think the beets alone would also make an excellent side dish. A great starter salad and a blue ribbon recipe in every way!
