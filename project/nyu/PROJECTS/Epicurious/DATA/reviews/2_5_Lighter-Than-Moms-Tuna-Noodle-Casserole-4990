This recipe is a great place to start. For my family, I added garlic, celery seed, and oregano. Next time, I'm going to try chopped celery, onions, and a red bell pepper. Not sure I'm going to use as much thyme. Even with the garlic it seemed a little pronounced. I think, I'll halve thyme and increase the liquid next time. Cheers!

I totally agree with the reviewer who said this is a great base. This is a good "what-i-already-have-in-the-house" recipe. I coulda done without the potatoe chips on top... made it TASTE low fat (bad). Added lemon juice. Should have added a little more thyme. Garlic (powdered/fresh) would've been a good addition. Used more like a 1/4 cup of neufchatel. Didn't have milk, but used a splash of 1/2 and 1/2 and the rest water with chicken Better than Bouillion. Overbaked a little at around 30 minutes (spaced out when the timer went off) and the peas started going grey. Definitely season well after adding the pasta; it does get a little diluted. I think I liked the flavor better before I baked it. I'd leave off the chips, skip the baking, and serve after a quick reheat after the frozen peas and pasta go in.

This is my go-to for tuna casserole (as a starting point). It would be (clearly) very bland as written, so I add celery, carrots, onions with S&P and a little garlic powder. It does need those additions to perk it up, but as a base...with a little creativity, it's a mighty tasty lighter version of a classic.

Exactly what I was hoping for. Tuna casserole as a kid was always something I dreaded. Canned soup and yuckiness. This recipe was light and tasty. I did use less thyme than the recipe calls for as I already know that I find thyme very powerful. The wine is a light background flavor and if you do not season the sauce with salt and pepper before mixing it with the noodles it will taste bland. My two year old loves it!

Lots of negative reviews for this recipe surprises me. Perhaps "season to taste" is lost of some people. For those people, that means add salt. Its a great recipe. Not very liquidy and yes its lower fat too. Recommended modifications... more veggies (carrots and celery). Also used veggie broth cubes which are tasty. my two year old ate and ate. very nice to see.

I have not made this dish, but it is a big pet peeve of mine that recipes calling for a mere 1/2 pound of pasta say it serves six. Not unless you are serving people who don't want to eat!

Ugh. I never grew-up with tuna noodle casserole but my boyfriend did. I thought this would be a nice healthy alternative to some of the other recipes out there. Beware: this particular recipe is healthy but it is not very good. Not very good at all.

Great as a jumping-off point for healthier mac- n-cheese. I was not looking for something spectacular for adults at a dinner party, but to improve the kids' standby, and this worked. I like to use whole wheat noodles, of just about any variety. Neufchatel is both inexpensive, and provides a good nutritional profile: lower-fat than boxed mac-n-cheese, but with good protein ratio. (The organic version is also readily available in stores near me.) Another traditional mac-n-cheese flavoring is nutmeg - just a tiny bit -it helps considerably. I add it with the wine. I really like the taste & texture of tuna in the dish, but ayurvedic wisdom cautions against serving cheese and fish in the same dish, and I have to admit my experience agrees with ayurveda here, as much as I wish it weren't true. If you want more protein, try edamame, soybeans (OUT of the pod!) instead of green peas. Much improved by a sprinkle of bread- crumbs (or crumbled up stale bunny-crackers!) and a quick browning under the broiler. I like to make a big quantity of this, divide it into the portion sizes I want in ramekins, with the peas in a layer in the middle so they don't get burned under the broiler. Then top with waxed paper, stack them up, and refrigerate or freeze for later. Thaw & heat in the microwave, great and quick for kids. I skip the veg. oil spray and can make the whole kit & caboodle organic. Better than the boxed kind.

This was a satisfying, interesting twist on the traditional tuna casserole. Next time I will use only the light chunk tuna since I would have preferred the tuna more dispersed throughout the dish.

Pretty good. My personal take on it was to double all except the pasta. Instead of potato chips, reduced fat Ritz crackers are good. Asparagus is another good substitution for the peas and tarragon for the thyme.

Unburdened by childhood memories of tuna casserole, I came to this recipe fresh with a desire to copy a Central Market chef-prepared salmon-penne-artichoke casserole that I love, with gouda, dill, & chives. But theirs is too salty & quite decadent. My real question was how this "light" sauce would compare. I ADORED the results, and so did my 2-yr-old and husband. I poached a pound of wild coho salmon so it wouldn't be too dry. I prepared the sauce with 1/2 dried thyme, 1/2 dried tarragon (wow did this make the house smell good). Copying the other dish, I added capers, artichoke hearts, dill, and Italian 4-cheeses grated as a thin layer on top. Instead of potato chips, I used 1/2 cup bread crumbs mixed with 1/2 cup parmesan. I only had skim milk, so I added a Tblsp butter with the flour for the bechamel-type sauce. This light sauce was so satisfying and delicious, I didn't at all miss the usual amount of fat. I will definitely be making this again. I can't in good conscience give it 4 forks since I altered it too much, but thought others might enjoy considering the alterations.

Tuna casserole is meant to be a simple dish, not a light one. You may wish to try these modifications. Forget the broth and cream cheese. Use two cans of Campbell's Golden Cream of Mushroom soup and thin with just enough whole milk so it is still fairly thick. The "golden" version is important because it contains beef broth and contributes to a richer flavor. Alternate in several layers: the tuna of your choice (two large cans), a package of partially-cooked egg noodles, the contents of a bag of frozen mixed vegetables (yes, you read that right), 6-8 ounces of grated extra-sharp cheddar (yellow is best for color), and the soup mixture. End with cheese and top with bread crumbs, preferably whole wheat. Do NOT add salt as the soup has plenty. Bake at 350 until it bubbles.

I gave this recipe 3 forks because even though it's not amazing, it's perfect for what it is. An easy, LO FAT/CAL, comfort food. Not a common combination. This is the kind of meal that pleases everyone in the family and doesn't make you feel like you've eaten a million calories before bed. Plus, you can put this casserole together (and whatever else you want to toss into it) really quickly after a long day at work. If you want delicious and rich, don't look for "light". This recipe, however, is a keeper for what it is.

I just made this for my boyfriend and I and we devoured the whole pan! To make this delicious, saute some green onions in butter, then mix your flour (preferrably Wondra)in the butter. Whilk into a rue. Stir an milk and let thicken. Add broth and wine with powdered garlic and dash Worstershire. Add peas with carrots for more color. Sprinkle with Parmesean. Still farily light, but the butter makes a huge difference.

The family liked it, but I wish I had added something else to kick it up a little, like the reviews suggested. Also, it took much longer than 4 minutes for the broth and thyme. As an inexperienced cook, I thought I was doing something wrong, but I just turned up the heat and it eventually reached the right consistency.

I don't understand why people disliked this recipe so much. As written it reads/tastes pretty bland. But I used it as a foundation on which to personalize and give it more "zing". So folks, use recipes as jumping off points, and if it reads/tastes wrong, use your imagination! I added: A bunch of chopped green onions, lots of fresh parsley,two ribs of celery all chopped up, chopped red bell pepper, and topped it with french fried onions rather than potato chips. No need for salt or pepper!

Since when is light mayo and light sour cream a reasonable subsitute for cream cheese? These idiots change major ingredients then ask themselves why a recipe doesn't come out right. Sad.

Rating: 2
Well, it was alright. I did not use cream cheese and substituted light sour cream and light mayonnaise instead which made it less dry. Also, I did not put thyme in but put onions and other spices. When we had it for leftovers, I put some ranch dressing into it and it was much better.

I use unthawed frozen peas all the time. No need to cook them. Just add to what ever & they thaw out on their own. They are a brighter green & a much fresher taste. Which is why I prefer them to canned peas. :)

Do you notice that not only is this recipe low fat, but also very low sodium? If you want flavor, you have to add it to the recipe. Thanks to other suggestions, mine was a success. Try the sauted onions in butter/margarine before dumping in the flour and cook the flour in the butter before adding the milk. That takes away any yeasty taste. I also recommend using Albacore if you don't like strong, fishy taste. Using a variety of spices, herbs, salt and pepper will give back the flavor so many people missed in this recepie. I've never been a fan of tuna noodle, but my husband is and he gave thumbs up for this try. He also thought that using French fried onions was a geat idea for topping.

I didn't follow this particular recipe, but based on the reviewer's comments, I think it needs a little more spice. I usually saute onions and celery in the butter when making the sauce. Then add poultry seasoning or celery seed, a very small amount of fresh grated nutmeg,a dash of worchester sauce or even a little cayenne for zip.

Hey, it's tuna casserole, so don't have great expectations. This recipe is fine. I went easy on the milk and blended some sour cream into the mixture to add thickness and taste. I also went easy on the tyme, and topped it with french fried onions to add some more flavor. It was good.

It may be lighter than Mom's, but it tastes just like I remember from childhood (a good memory). Nothing special and not worth the trouble. I thought the flavor of thyme was predominant and would suggest reducing the quantity added.
