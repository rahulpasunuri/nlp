I've made this recipe multiple times, and am never disappointed. When I can't find arugula, I usually substitute spinach, I like the mild flavor of that as much or more than the arugula. It's also quick and easy, so it's a nice weeknight dinner.

just ok. add too much pasta water and you will find it hard to taste the goat cheese. the arugula and mushrooms don't really meld. would have been better with just the mushrooms. my arugula was bitter. perhaps it would be better in the early spring when the arugula always tastes sweeter.

Also, I found the arugula a little bitter, but I think if I had cut it in smaller pieces that would have been better. Watercress or basil would be good options too.

I made this in haste, and didn't put enough garlic & salt. I agree, shallots would help. Tasty, but a little bland. I think that was just from my carelessness. I'll make it again with revisions.

This is a great healthy weeknight meal - even better with whole wheat spaghetti!

I really enjoyed this dish... light and healthy. Had to make a few changes though. I could not find arugula at the store so substituted watercress. Added more garlic and shallots as another cook suggested. I also used only baby portabella mushrooms because my boyfriend and I are currently addicted to them. Next time I'll top it off with pine nuts.

Forgot to add to my previous review: I used campanelle pasta, not spaghetti. I think a shape like that--farfalle, penne, rotini--works much better than spaghetti.

Quick, easy, tasty . . . what more can you ask for? I added a little more garlic and one shallot (chopped) to the mushroom saute, and used 2 oz. more goat cheese, plus probably used a little more than 1/2 cup of the pasta water. Would definitely make again.

it tasted good but i found this recipe a disappointment. ingredients do not blend well together physically.

The flavors in this dish were amazing. I used half wild mushrooms(Hen of the Woods) and half baby portabellas. The pasta was a little dry though - not creamy even after adding all the pasta water. Next time I would add several tablespoons of butter to round out the dish. Otherwise fabulous!
