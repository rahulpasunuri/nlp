This salad was absolutely delicious! We made it to go with a grilled Asian salmon and the combination was terrific. I substituted avocado instead of corn as another member suggested and it really added a lot to the taste. Toasting the barley also added flavor. The texture of the salad was perfect. In the summer, I might go back to using farm fresh sweet corn. Some heat from a jalapeno pepper would also work as the lime juice and cilantro would cool it off a bit.

I've made this salad a couple of times for big groups of people and everyone has always loved it. This time I'll make it for my sister in law's birthday party!!!!!

So good. This is yet another great recipe that allows for alteration depending on what's in the pantry. I ommitted the poblano and subbed lemon for lime and added a bit of zest, too. I wound up actually baking the portabello caps whole and then basically serving the salad heaped into and on the mushroom caps as a side for pan sauteed salmon patties. So easy and delicious. I added some fresh basil, too.

Oh, yum! Made it as written, except decreased the olive oil by 1 tblspoon and used green bell instead of poblano. Contrary to many other reviewers, I really liked adding the portobello mushrooms. As a vegetarian, it added a little extra "oomph" to make it a whole meal.

Wonderful recipe! I chopped the mushrooms, substituted diced avocado for corn to make it more low carb, and added sliced almond to give it more crunch. This one is definitely going in my recipe box.

I just made this (minus the portobellos) and it is utterly delicious.

Made this last week and was expecting a big ewww from my husband who is less than adventurous when trying anything new. He loved it! And I am so glad, since I am a huge fan of barley and will most definitely make this again. I did eliminate the corn since neither of us are big fans and substituted very finely chopped cucumber...about 1/4-1/3 cup. This is one that you can play around with to suit most tastes!

Easy to prepare, healthy and delicious. Perfect for any time of year and a great dish to bring for lunch at work.

My husband has been asking me to include more vegetarian dishes in my weekly menus, so I've been experimenting. I haven't found many recipes that have wowed me, but this one is fantastic. I absolutely agree that the portobellos are out of place in this dish. I happened to have a couple that needed to be used, so I diced them into the salad, since I don't much like them on their own. I won't do that again. I used only 1 1/2 tablespoons of lime juice, and that was enough. I mixed in a couple handfuls of baby arugula, because I didn't have spinach, and it tasted great. Next time, I'm going to try adding more corn and some toasted spiced pecans.

This was excellent and my whole family loved it, even my 6 year old, who requested it for lunch the next day. Per other reviewers, I didn't use the mushrooms, but used chicken to make it a main dish salad for dinner. Also, decreased the green onions, but that is my preference. I also used anaheim peppers in place of the poblanos, because I was concerned about how spicy it might be for my daughter. Next time, I will double the recipe. This is a REALLY good recipe and I will definitely make it again.

this is delicious - the last reviewer shoudl actually make the dish without adding or subtracting incredients, and then, perhaps, review it. very healthy as well. an excellent side and or main course. highly recommend to those who like to eat healthy AND interesting food.

This recipe was very good, but not breathtaking. I would add less lime next time, as the tartness seemed to overtake the hearty grain contribution. I put it over spinach, and thought the pairing was delicious (but skipped portabellos b/c of cost and time). I love cilantro, so this was a real treat for me. Added black beans to it this morning and sent it off with the husband for lunch. Try it on yourself before you feed it to a crowd to adjust the ratios as you see fit.

This dish is simply fabulous. So easy, too. We omitted the mushrooms and added black beans. Grilled chicken to put on top. Chilled leftovers were great the next day, too. Definitely a keeper.

My husband can't get enough of this dish. It is also great served warm under just about any type of fish. I chop the portabellos and mix with the other ingredients, add a roasted, diced jalapeno, and a little extra lime juice and cilantro. Perfect by tossing in a little bit of white truffle oil before serving!

Well, neither of those ingredients do have to do with lactose. I think she needed a lactose-free dish AND she made it without mushrooms and spinach. Frankly, I'm not surprised that it wasn't that good-- you'd need to make a substitution if you took out two of the most flavorful ingredients.

hi all...not a review, but a question...Amy Bowen needed a lactose-free dish so she omitted the mushrooms and spinach...what do either of those ingredients have to do with lactose, a milk sugar...i'm puzzeled...also, i didn't see any 'lactose' ingreds in the recipe...am i missing something?...

I needed a lactose-free dish to round out a vegetarian meal so I made this without the mushrooms and spinach. It was good, but I didn't think it was spectacular. My guests enjoyed the black bean/avacado tostadas that I made much more, apparently, and I didn't get any recipe requests for this. It's a nice barley dish but I'll have to cast my vote as "pretty good, not great."

First experience dry toasting barley. It was wonderful. As did others, served without mushrooms and spinach. I was totally surprised how much I enjoyed this recipe. I will certainly be making this again.

Have made this several times, and am always surprised at how much I love it. I have also left out the mushrooms and the spinach, and haven't missed them; I am a mushroom freak, though, so I usually include the portobellos. Goes well with grilled flank steak, and stands up to pungent marinades and full-bodied red wines.

As with other readers, I left out the mushrooms and spinach--was a HUGE hit, w/everyone asking for the recipe.

Not many recipes make my repeat list - this is delicious. The mushrooms (which I love) are out of place in this dish, and I will omit them in the future. Fresh spinach does add a great dimension.

I served this with sliced avocado and corn chips for lunch on a day hike in the Sierras. It traveled very well in a daypack and was the perfect temperature by the time noon rolled around. Colorful and crunchy. Also nice and light on the fat. I used frozen corn and parsley (I was out of cilantro). This would be better made with the cilantro instead of the parsley, but no one complained. I also intend to use the poblano chili next time, although the green bell was very nice. The mushrooms and decorative spinach were not missed. I'll be making this again soon!

I just made this recipe for the umpteenth time last night, and it never fails to please! It has such a wonderful combination of flavors! I agree with the comments about skipping the mushrooms and/or spinach--I usually just put in more of the other veggies to make a more substantial main course. The mushrooms and spinach are good for variety, and to make it a more well-rounded meal, but they are not really necessary, and are certainly not the best part of the recipe. This salad is especially terrific in the summertime, made in the morning and left to chill for several hours. This has the advantage of allowing the flavors to blend. As a shortcut, I use canned corn (a trick I picked up in France)--it's less trouble than using corn on the cob, and the result is still tasty, if you use a good quality brand.

This was very tasty. I sauteed the corn with the green onions and added cumin and hot pepper flakes and it was just right.

I used 10 min. barley, and it turned out great (according to the 10 min. recipe, with the rest of the ingredients added accordingly). The mushrooms (which are my favorite food) did not add anything to the recipe. I suggest the recipe without the mush's, definitely.

This is a super summer salad with fresh tomatoes from my garden. I used a little extra jalapeno to heat it up some and have served it as a side dish without the mushrooms.

We love this recipe. It's easy, light, refreshing! I generally make it without the mushrooms - I'm sure it would be great, I'm just trimming the time back a bit.

This is a great recipe. I have made it numerous times. I prefer to coarsely chop the mushrooms and add to the salad when served as a side dish.
