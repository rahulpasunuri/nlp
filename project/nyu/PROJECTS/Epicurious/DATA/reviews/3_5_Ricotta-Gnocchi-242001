These were soooo good. I admit, we were concerned that they'd be bland or disintegrate at any stage of cooking. But all was perfect. Details - for some reason, our grocery store only sells 15 ounce tubs of ricotta, but that wasn't a problem. We drained it as others suggested but used the listed quantities of everything else. It was incredibly wet. Piping it may work, but I just patted in into messy logs on flour-lined parchment and then chilled till it was firm enough to cut (we used a knife and it was no problem). We cooked half right away and froze the other half. We bruised the rosemary leaves before browning it with the butter and added a couple of garlic cloves. We only drained the gnocchi for a minute in the colander before tossing it with the butter and rosemary and garlic. Don't forget the salt, pepper and parmesan. Perfect.

Damn those are good! I served them at a fellow student's birthday dinner and everyone was begging for more! The rosemary butter really adds something to them.

I made this recipe last night (halved the recipe with no problem). As others suggested, I drained the ricotta and put the cut gnocchi in the freezer for a bit before boiling them. No problems with sticky dough. Served them with a tomato and cream sauce. Delightful. A good recipe.

So... I forgot the eggs in the recipe. But it was still good. :) I was in a hurry and to cool them put them in the freezer (too long) and froze the dough bits (on accident), but it worked great. I don't know how this will work with egg in it. This dish (with heaviness of the butter) was a bit heavy and my husband and I could only eat a small portion, but it was good, all accidents included. Next time I'm considering replacing 1/4c flour with 1/4c wheat flour for an earth-er taste. Hopefully with egg this time.

I had half a large container (about 15 oz) skim ricotta waiting to be used and settled on this recipe. I added about 2T more flour, but otherwise kept to the recipe. My family loved it!

The key to great gnocchi is the ratio of ricotta to flour and this one works perfectly. I used 00 flour. Also added 2 tablespoons of heavy cream since I was using homemade ricotta that I had drained pretty well.

DELICIOUS!! I don't have a ton of cooking experience, but I easily made this for a dinner with my boyfriend. We made it with roasted broccoli and asparagus, and it was really great. Definitely recommended!

This was so easy to prepare and soooo much better than packaged potato gnocchi that I don't think I'll every buy those desicated things ever again. These gnocchi were fluffy and flavorful - I can't wait to experiment with additional flavors. I love spinach but the dear hub does not. Cooling in the fridge is the key to not having to use too much flour. This one is a winner!

This came together pretty quickly and was very tasty. I used homemade ricotta that was not very wet, so I decreased the flour a bit to about a cup. I made a brown butter sage sauce which was just okay - I found that the butter made the dish a bit too heavy. Next time I would make it with a tomato based sauce. Overall a nice, relatively quick meal.

I made these tonight and they were wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly. Chilled for 20 or 30 minutes after shaping them and they cooked up just right. We just got back from Italy and my husband said these were even better then any we had there. YUMMMMY!

I made these last night and they came out really well. Not too many ingredients and a pretty simple preparation (next time I will probably make them a day or so ahead of time and freeze them, though). Swapped sage for rosemary as others did and personally think that it is a better flavor with the butter sauce. They are really great gnocchi although to say that they're "light" is a bit ridiculous...my husband and I could each only eat about 8 of them before feeling incredibly full. This recipe could easily serve 6 people.

I made this for Valentine's Day last night and it was great! I halved the recipe and the amount was perfect for two people (though no leftovers). I used store-bought ricotta and let them sit for a good 45 minutes before boiling, and this gave me a great consistency - not too tough, not too soft. Had to improvise the sauce because there was no rosemary at the store, so did a shallots, white wine & sage one instead which tasted delicious. Will make again!

The real italian experience of gnocchi is the family in the kitchen making the dumplings. Sorry to see the rolling of the pillows into little boats to cradle the starring sauce is omitted. It does take more flour in the dough, but they cook more evenly and will puff up into fluffy morsels of delight. This is an ART adn takes a good bit of time and practice. Freezing before boiling is something my papa's zia taught when she passed down the recipe. No parm, no garlic in the dough - maybe that was because she grew up too poor (this is a peasant dish, after all) or because as he got older, salt was taken out of zio's diet. I never missed it -- her sauce, also peasant and simple, was simply to die for. This is a tasty recipe, and a nice alternative. But for me the "soul" of this dish is keeping it simple. Ricotta, eggs, enough flour (and if you're PO'd at your family, add enough flour to make them bind up for a week.... hehehe! Italian nonas and their evil hexes). Roll, boil and serve with a sauce that's been simmering on the stove for hours.

I made this for friends as a thank you for letting them stay with them in new york city only to realize later that I was serving pasta to a true blooded new york italiano!! but he LOVED it as so did I. I ended up serving it with fresh basil and garlic since the store was out of fresh rosemary. I've made potato gnocchi before and found it to be a simple but time consuming process and the gnocchi ends up delicious but carb central. This gnocchi was light and fluffy, and I snagged a couple pieces with out any sauce at all and just about died of delish! and on top of that so much easier to make AND higher in protein and lower in carbs! for people having trouble rolling it out, flour a cutting board and your hands before handling the dough... and have a little flour (like a 1/4 cup) set aside for extra dusting or to firm the dough up a little bit if needed. over all: simple and DELISH!

Everyone in the family liked this recipe a lot, and they all want it again. It was fantastically quick and easy... my type of recipe. It mixes up in a flash. Hard to shape into uniform "ropes" but who cares. At the rope stage, I threw them into the frig until ready to proceed. I didn´t boil them; I fried them in olive oil, butter and herbs as suggested. I thought this gave them an attractive color and texture and would do this again as opposed to boiling them. The ricotta makes the nice texture but it is a very delicate flavor. I was glad for the nutmeg, and for the herbs I used in the butter-oil. Next time, I would do the same as well as adding herbs to the ricotta mix. Maybe some spinach? Served with a simple tomato sauce.

Fabulous. Used the pastry bag as another recommended and put them in the freezer on parchment before boiling. Turned out great! Even made extra and kept them in the freezer for a quick weeknight meal. Did not use the sauce here but a vegetable ragout from another site. Very good.

I made a half batch. The dough was too sticky to roll, but I shaped it into ropes and cut off pieces with a fork. When boiling, gnocchi are done when they float to the surface. They were very light and fluffy with a delicate ricotta flavor. I served them with a buffalo ragu, but I think there's a better accompaniment out there.

Delicious! Used home made ricotta which was much drier than commercial and the dough was easy to handle. The gnocchi were delicate but held together well when cooked. Can't wait to make it again.

Oh my God, I just made this and it was a disaster! I would have given it minus forks if I could! I turned out an inedible blob! I was embarassed to even serve it to my husband. What saved the day was my chicken thighs stuffed with prosciutto, smoked gouda, and asparagus. I would usually comment on possible mistakes I could have made, but this is very unlikely to be tested ever again.

i didn't find the dough troublesome to work with, unlike others, but did follow the directions to refrigerate it before cooking. following another online recipe i opted to fry the gnocchi in a pan with some olive oil and butter over medium heat. i flipped them once they appeared to be getting brown on one side and then browned the other side. i personally thought this change in cooking really improved upon the recipe - no risk of gooey gnocchi...they were caramelized on the outside and soft on the inside. yum! i also decided to not use the brown butter sauce and went with a marinara. that said, the marinara was still too bland. think of these as a platform for some really tasty sauce - the trick is to find that sauce!

Really, really great recipe - so simple (and economical! with just a few ingredients). I have made another ricotta gnocchi recipe from epi and it was just not as simple and delish and this. One of my toddlers helped cut the 'snakes' into 'pillows'. FYI - I doubled the recipe and had no problems with the dough, however; I wasn't precise in my measurements. Both my toddlers gobbled it up - me too :). As for the sauce - it is what it is - I did 1/2 brown butter and then did the other half with Love Sauce Marinara and they were both great. I froze the remainder and hope they do well later. Make this recipe!!

These were pretty easy to make and the results were impressive. I think I might experiment with ways to get more flavor into them next time, though. Maybe really good parm instead of the mass produced variety?? I served them with fresh favas and a mushroom bacon sautee with fresh parsley rather then the rosemary butter to make it a square meal.

I have fond memories of ricotta gnocchi from our first trip to Italy. These were good but not as good. I put the ricotta in a strainer to let some of the liquid drain out before making the gnocchi. I did not have to add too much flour. I did roll & cut them then put them into the fridge on parchment paper to let them set until our company arrived. They were tender and easy to make. I doubled the recipe for 4 but have some leftovers for a lunch for two.

I really liked this. The dough is annoying, but I didn't use extra flour. I put it in the freezer after I rolled it for like 15 minutes like other suggested. Also, I used cinnamon bc I couldn't easily find nutmeg to grate. I thought the flavor was great. I used the butter sauce. My husband used tomato basil. Pretty darn easy too.

Rating: 3
I doubled the recipe and like others I had to use much more flour than the recipe called for to make the dough workable. I cut all the gnocchi, laid them out on cookie sheets, froze them for a few hours then stored them in a freezer bag. Now I can just pour out howerver much I need for the meal without them being in one big clump. As to the flavor - they are a little less flavorful than the traditional potato gnocchi so you definitely need to spice the sauce up a bit but they are very tasty. My 20 month old downed an entire adult serving and wanted more.

I love gnocchi and have been generally intimidated by the very thought of making them. This recipe is easy and delicious. I followed previous reviewers' recommendations to refrigerate prior to cooking. And since many suggested the rosemary butter was a bit unexciting, might I suggest pairing this with the "Sauteed Red Snapper with Creamed Fennel and Onion". I doubled the sauce for that recipe and extended it over the fish and gnocchi. Yummy.

Rating: 4
thanks to the other reviewers, I took their suggestions to put the gnocchi in the fridge prior to boiling and to have the butter/rosemary ready so that when the gnocchi finished cooking I could put them right into the butter. I also felt like the butter and rosemary was a bit dull--i think that these would be great with a hearty pink vodka sauce OR I would sautee onions in butter until they were very crisp and then toss them with those. The gnocchi themselves were divine. Light but not gooey. Just perfect! And I had never done gnocchi before. I will make this again, for sure! They really beat the potato gnocchi hands down.

Great recipe, and fast too - only about 20 mins! Some modifications: (1) Used 1% ricotta; (2) Making ropes on parchment and cutting them up over boiling water is way too complicated - I rolled the dough like meatballs and placed them directly on a cutting board. I popped the board into the freezer for about 10 minutes to make them a little more sturdy in the boiling water; (4) Doubled the nutmeg; (5) Substituted fresh sage for rosemary; (6) Sauteed garlic in olive oil before adding the butter and sage - much more flavorful; (7) I did make them in 2 batches, but next time would not. I'd definitely make this dish again - a quick and tasty meal!

I thought these were really tasty and easy. I tossed mine with a marinara sauce and some turkey sausage. I think people need to realize that ricotta gnocchi dough is never going to be as firm as potato gnocchi dough. I just pipe the dough onto a baking sheet and pop it in the freezer for fifteen minutes before cutting in order to make it easier to form the gnocchis. Adding extra flour to this recipe is only going to make them bland and gummy.

This recipe was delicious and very simple. I made this for two people and had plenty left over. Matter of fact I froze half of the batch before cooking. I did refridgerate the batch I did cook before cutting into pieces. It was much easier to deal with. The sauce just needs a little something.....add whatever you like to jazz it up. We added some garlic!! I will definitely make this again!

Exceptional for gnocchi--very light and tender. Made as written, though we doubled the batch to serve 6 (with leftovers), and was sure to include enough salt and pepper. Also, used sage instead of rosemary in the butter. I can easily imagine using this as a base for all sorts of vegetable sautes. For ease of cooking, I rolled the dough into shortish rolls and put them on a cutting board, held the cutting board above the boiling water, and cut/scraped off pieces right into the water. Didn't need any extra flour making it this way, though perhaps not as neat and pretty as in the photo.

I cooked this dish for some friends and everybody LOVED it. But I had to use more flour than was recommended in the recipe. Also, instead of making the sauce with rosemary I used sage; and instead of parmeggiano I used romano cheese. I would absolutely make this again.

Good, light gnocchi. However, the sauce included is pretty much unflavored. Terrible, even. I added some of my own sauce to make it taste a bit better.

This gnocchi recipe is by far the best I've ever made. Much lighter than the traditional potato gnocchi. Don't let the cooked gnocchi sit too long in the colander as they will end up sticking together. I just poured hot water over them to loosen them up, but this could be alleviated by having the butter sauce ready right away. Definitely a recipe worth saving!

I've tried many gnocchi recipes in the past, and had always been put off by the leaden results. This recipe however was easy to follow and yielded the best gnocchi I've ever eaten - cloudlike pillows that floated on the palate. I'd be tempted to try them with a sage brown butter next time!

Delicious! Such an easy gnocchi recipe. They are so light and smooth - the flavor is phenominal. I halved the recipe & it was still more than enough for my boyfriend & me. We both agreed it would be the perfect dish to serve to company. I skipped the sauce that comes with the recipe & used the one that comes with the Food Network recipe (sorry!) "Potato Gnocchi with Peas, Prosciutto & Ricotta" Was a perfect, light, very flavorful accompaniment to this fantastic basic.

My gnocchi's sort of fell apart when I cooked them and then when I added them to the butter with the cheese they clumped together. I guess my ricotta might have been too wet. They tasted great despite the mushiness. Oh, and you don't need that much butter! I also froze half of the gnocchi so hopefully that will help when I go to cook them again.

These are delicious! I had some trouble incorporating all the flour and rolling out the dough, but they boiled up really nicely, and soaked up the rosemary-brown-butter wonderfully. They didn't stick together, either, although that could be because I took them directly from the pot to the pan with the brown butter.

This gnocchi is delicious! Rolling the dough into "ropes" and then cutting it was a little tough, though. The dough was kind of goopy and was really hard to shape, so my gnocchi came out in all different sizes and shapes. The post-boiling texture was perfect, though. Yummy!

I made this recipe last night and it was delicious. I inadvertently bought part skim ricotta cheese and it still turned out great.

I haven't made this particular recipe but I just wanted to put down some notes regarding ricotta gnocchi. I'm sorry for commenting even though I haven't made it, but the other comments were kind of annoying me. 1) this ricotta gnocchi does not need to be scored - all you're doing is tossing it with a flavored oil. 2) if it's hard to work with, try squeezing some of the water out of the ricotta - if you google other ricotta gnocchi recipes, you'll see this is the norm. 3) ricotta gnocchi is generally very mild in taste which is why I like it.

Rating: 1
Absolutely terrible! Added an extra 1/4 cup of flour to make the dough 'workable', without luck. Needed another 1/2 cup of flour to get the dough off of the cutting board during the rolling process. The gnocchi came out of the boiling water OK, but as soon as the brown butter was added,the dumpings immediately glued themselves to each other. The recipe sounded wonderful, but don't be fooled.

Easier to make than expected. I don't agree that it was bland, but I did serve it with the "braised lamb shanks with tomatoes and fresh herbs" from this site. The sauce for the shanks is strong and very tasty. They are, however, ugly and I would recommend finding a site that has tips on making gnocchi. Specifically, a technique to score them.

Rating: 2
A snap to make and the texture was nice and pillowy, but the flavor was quite bland, even with all that cheese. Would be fine with a strong sauce, but I wanted something that would stand up on its own with just some butter and a little cheese (as the recipe recommends) Some of the other gnocchi recipes on this site are much better, in my opinion.
