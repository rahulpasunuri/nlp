I have made this countless times and it's always a hit, even with non-grit eaters. I prepare the grits according to directions on the box, feeling the 1/2 & 1/2 is just too rich. The caper cream sauce is excellent. I also bake the salmon according to directions on the bag they come in...from Costco, frozen.

Reading the ingredients of the recipe will tip you off-this is very rich meal. This is also a very delicious meal worth trying. My husband and I love to make this the flavors are wonderful. Watch portion size and serve with green beans or asparagus.

While we love the grits, they can be a bit heavy with all of the cream. We've shortened the recipe a little and even our 11 year old daughter begs for salmon now. We make the cream sauce only, sometimes a double recipe, and use it on the salmon and some steamed broccili. There's never a bit of anything left. Leftover cream sauce has also been discovered to be excellent on tomorrow morning's scrambled eggs! Would I make it again? We make it regularly.

I, too, went to UGA and just finished there and the thing I miss the most is the salmon and grits at Last Resort. I used to order it to go at least once a week and eat it at home in my pjs. Of all my Athens and UGA experiences, that meal is the thing I miss the most. I never ever ordered anything else when dining at the restaurant in 4 years of eating there!

I always add a splash of lemon juice to the sauce at the end, to counteract all the creaminess. With the lemon, it really completes the dish and it's not bland at all! I probably should cut down on the half-and-half in the grits -- but we never do, and it's divine. Always a hit with the whole family: toddlers and adult dinner party guests alike.

The Last Resort was my favorite resturant when we lived in Athens. I am so glad to have this recipe! I lighten the grits with water and/or evaporated skim milk. I also like to vary the cheeses. Fresh lemon squeezed over the salmon is a nice touch. Overall, this is an easy and impressive dish for guests. The only reason I did not give it "4 forks rating" is because it is VERY rich and needs to be lightened a little.

very nice and actually easy recipe. The cream sauce is yummy, but may be overkill. Next time I won't use all the cream, maybe use some chicken broth.

While dining at the Last Resort in Athens GA over the weekend with my Bulldog daughter and friend, I wished I had ordered this dish. Upon returning home, I hoped to find a comparable recipe and was very fortunate to find THE recipe! I didn't change a thing - the instant grits made with the half & half and the shredded Monterey Jack cheese made a whole new kind of grit! I served the dish with sides of fresh green beans and broiled parmesan tomatoes for color. My family had seconds and I swore my husband wanted to lick his plate clean. The caper sauce was delicious!

I have prepared this many times, very good and always gets rave reviews. I use Old Fashioned Grits, do try them, they are worth the extra cooking time. Recently to cut the fat, as you must use the whipping cream in the sinfully delicious sauce, I started using a can of fat free evaporated milk with water to make the 2 1/2 cups liquid to cook the grits, just as creamy. Use sharp white cheddar YUM! I cook the salmon in my grill pan to get "grill" marks. Last, fun thing I do for the holidays to the sauce add 1 (one) peeled, seeded and diced plum tomato at the end of the cooking time. The red tomato pieces with the green capers looks beautiful and festive. Enjoy!

This actually proved to be more an "inspirational" recipe than a straightforward good recipe. I substituted a wild mushroom polenta recipe for the grits, while keeping the caper- cream sauce for topping the salmon and polenta. The polenta I made in my rice cooker. How? I first measured the standard polenta / water ratio into the cooker, stirred, and then clicked the button. I then sauteed in olive oil, garlic and onions until translucent, adding the mushrooms and some sage. I also zapped the mix with some dry sherry to add some extra flavor. When the rice cooker stopped cooking (button clicks off), I added in the mushroom saute and mixed the mush around and clicked the cooker back on for one last go. When the cooker finished, I stirred the polenta one last time and left it to rest while I prepared the salmon. Of course, I made the caper sauce first. Serve this with a half-way decent Pinot Noir. Cheers!

I only made the grits since this was a meal for just myself and my husband. The whole thing together seemed too rich. The grits were delicious! I will definately make them this way again. I topped it with blackened salmon and a side of green beans.

I too thought the dish was a bit rich, but definitely impressed our dinner guests. I appreciated the comments on the saltiness of the sauce; I gave the capers a quick rinse and didn't add any salt to the sauce. It turned out well. I added scallions to the grits and used polenta instead of intant grits. I think the polenta held up better to the cream and cheese. My husband has already requested I make the dish again.

I also substituted cheddar, my husband loved it! He ate all of his and took some of mine. We will be making this again.

"The Last Resort" in Athens, Ga serves the most wonderful food and the recipe is EXACTLY like the dish in the restaurant. I do recommend cutting the half and half with water. You sacrfice none of the taste but eliminate some of the heaviness associated with this meal. Serve with sauteed summer veggies or steamed asparagus. DELICIOUS!!! One of my all time favorite dishes especially for entertaining!!!

The Last Resort (and Mia Madonna, which is across the street and --I think-- is its sister restaurant) is a fabulous place, and this recipe is as close to you can get at home to what they serve there. I have made this several times since happening upon the recipe, with great success each time. The capers are wonderful in this, but neither they nor the sauce take the attention away from the salmon, which is really allowed to shine. Try this -- you won't be disappointed!!

We loved the sauce for this recipe! I have eaten at The Last Resort in Athens and thought I remembered this dish. We thought that it was a little bit "creamy overload," but that could be solved by reducing the proportions of half and half to water in the grits recipe. All in all, a memorable meal!

Very simple recipe, but it seemed an odd combination of flavors. Maybe a different fish would be better. I used real, stone-ground grits instead of instant and they turned out quite well. Very, very rich.

As I love salmon, I'm always looking for new interesting ways to prepare it. I've made this dish several times for numerous people, and I've always received compliments. The best part-it doesn't take much to fill you up!

Thought it was terrific. The sauce was great (added a little lemon juice for some bite) and the grits perfect. Pan-seared the salmon instead and it was great. My guests raved!

This recipe has an odd combination of flavors. My family thought I was making Chicken Piccata with the capers and white wine, and were disappointed when I set the salmon and grits before them. I love shrimp and grits, and will stick with that in the future!

I made this salmon atop roasted garlic mashed potatoes for my husband for valentines day. it was delicious- rich beyond words... so tasty and simple. wonderful for special occaisons.

We just love this recipe. It has become our favorite way to fix salmon. We usually serve with baked asparagus and a white wine.

First bite was extraordinary, then it got bland very quickly. Probably because of the enormous amount of cream and butter in it. Very high in fat, and not worth it.

This has become one of my favorite ways to prepare salmon. It is also great with sauteed shrimp (w/ garlic, lemon, and basil) as a substitute for the fish. My only problem with this dish is that it seems impossible for me to make it w/out boiling over the milk mixture for the grits! I gotta make myself stand right over it. :-)

I had my swanky New York City friends over for a Southern Dinner (my dad's from Tennesee). We started with Deviled Eggs (six varieties), and then this dish with a salad of mustard greens on the plate. We all loved it. To give it a deeper southern twist, I introduced a touch of jalapeno to the cream sauce. Also, I chopped up scallions and a little diced red pepper for the grits to give them a little more color. As is, or dressed up, it's a favorite of ours now, even if it is a little out of place up here north of the mason dixon line! :)

My husband loves capers and salmon so I knew this would be a hit. We love the subtle sauce and the grits - they make a lovely pair for the fish to top off.

Great salmon dish and pretty easy to make. I agree with an earlier reivew that the sauce was a bit salty. The grits on the side was the best part -- lighter version of mashed potatoes.

The grits are fabulous & elegant. Who knew?! It's such a lovely change for how to serve salmon. Our whole family liked it. It's now a keeper. Surprisingly easy to throw together.

My husband and I thought that the flavors of the grits, cream sauce and salmon blended together TOO much. About 3 bites into the meal, it got really boring. Not sure what happened, since everyone else seemed to love it. I also had trouble getting the sauce to thicken.

I loved this recipe! The sauce thickened beautifully and was perfect with the salmon! The grits were a big hit with my boyfriend. The only thing I suggest is to soak the capers in water to reduce the saltiness of the sauce! I was the only one though that thought it was too salty!

We found this a delicious preparation. It may well become one of our most often-used salmon recipes.

I made this dish w/o the grits for a low carb diet. It was delish, my sis said it was the best salmon dish she ever had very high praise!

The sauce is absolutely delicious and a nice complement to the salmon, although I did not get mine to thicken as much as I would have liked. Grits were VERY rich but still a nice combo with the fish. I served them on the side so everyone could combine them with the salmon as they wished.
