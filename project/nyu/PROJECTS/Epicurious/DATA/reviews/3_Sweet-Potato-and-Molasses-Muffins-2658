I made this recipe Gluten Free. It turned out great. I used gluten free all purpose flour, substituted milk with equal parts soymilk and plain low-fat yogurt. Opted for maple syrup instead of molasses. Added a few drops of vanilla extract, a splash of agave, a handful of palm, sugar and about a cup of shredded carrots. They came out delicious, slightly spongy though. Not sure if thats the baking powder or the gluten free flour. I'll definitely make these again.

I combined several other reviewers' suggestions: maple syrup instead of molasses, doubled the spices and added nutmeg, substituted vanilla yogurt for the milk, and added a large handful of ground flaxseed. These were absolutely delicious--slightly sweet, with a subtle maple flavor, and very moist. Three 5 year olds devoured almost an entire batch in one sitting! Next time I will add slightly more of the spices.

I would call this recipe a good starting point for a moist, pumpkin-pie-like muffin... don't be afraid to taste the batter and adjust! I sub'd pumpkin for sweet potato, orange juice for the milk, doubled the spices and added 1/2 cup sugar & a dash of cloves. All I can say is YUM.

Made as written but used 1 c. unbleached flour, 1/2 c. oat bran and 3 tbs. flaxseed meal. Also added some cardamom and cloves and freshly grated ginger to add more fragrance. Topped with leftover gingersnap cookies crumbs. Baked for less than 20 min. DELICIOUS.

I used only 1/4 c. blackstrap molasses; 1/4 c. milk plus 1/4 c. plain yogurt; 1 tsp. baking powder and 1 Tbsp. baking soda; 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. salt and a little fresh-ground nutmeg, since I had no ginger; otherwise I stuck to the recipe. Muffins were very moist and light, with a recognizable but not overpowering molasses flavor: wonderful! I might add some sunflower seeds or rolled oats for texture next time.

I really like these, but I happen not to like overly sweet muffins/quickbreads and like other reviewers enjoy making healthy baked treats like this for my one year old. I actually reduced the molasses to 1/4 cup and subbed 1/4 cup of naturally sweetened apple butter (to add sweetness w/o extra sugar) and upped the ginger. These are a great use for leftover sweet potatoes (squash, pumpkin, etc.) but don't exactly taste like sweet potatoes. next time I will try dried fruit as one reviewer recommended, and perhaps a little crystallized ginger to compliment the molasses. If you hate molasses, maple syrup or brown rice syrup might be nice subs...

I started making these for my son when he was 10months old. I took a tip from another reviewer here and made mini-muffins. There a hit and perfect for him to hold onto. I feel good knowing he's getting his vitamin A, iron from the molasses and I've put off his intro to sugar just a bit longer...

I wish I had paid more attention to the reviews before I made this but it was exactly what I was looking for. Even if you could improve the taste, the texture is like cardboard. Yuck!

I made this recipie for my 2 year old son, as a way to sneak some vegetables into his body. He loves them, and so do I. They are rich and moist and easy to make. My husband is not a fan of them--the molasses taste turned him off. These are not the type of muffins most people would want to go with their morning coffee. They would be great as an alternitive to dinner rolls or as just a healthy snack.

I doubled the spices, increased the wheat flour and decreased the white flour and added chopped pecans. THIS IS NOT A SWEET MUFFIN,but a decent savory one- good with turkey and all the fixin's.

I just could not believe that this was a lousey recipe, but it is! I even made changes - I reduced the amount of molasses, added <1/4 cup sugar, added nuts and the new "orange cranraisins" on the market. IF I make this again, which I doubt, I would double the spices and throw in some more. My whole family thought this was just absolutely boring.

On the good side, these are very moist. But the molasses taste is overwhelming.

Tasty. I found that the muffins stick to the paper and prefer to use cooking spray instead. Next time I make these I will add a little Orange peel to the batter and brush the warm tops with orange juice.

Our toddlers in our Mom's group loved these! And the ingredients are healthy too. Very easy to make and I made them in mini-muffin tins for little hands. This recipe made about 46 mini muffins. Used the microwave to cook the potato- very easy!

This recipe is great for my 18 month old daughter who is such a picky eater. She won't eat vegetables or meat but she loves these muffins which contain lots of beta-carotine, fibre and iron.

This is the first recipe from this site that I have to give a negative review to. My husband loves sweet potatoes in any form and these disgusted him.

I LOVE these muffins! Sometimes I substitute canned pumpkin puree in place of the sweet potatoes. I also add white or dark raisins and chopped walnuts or almonds.
