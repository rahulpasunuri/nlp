I have made this 3 times now, following the recipe and it is outstanding. It has been highly complimented by our guests. It doesn't seem to matter if you finish the oysters and the topping under the broiler for 12 minutes or do them on the grill as the recipe suggests,but grill the vegetables on the grill as the recipe describes. I serve these with oysters rockerfeller and oysters bienville for a nice combination.

I haven't tries this yet but it certainly does seem well balanced. Here on the east coast we certainly love our seafood and we definitely like it spicy. I will try this recipe next week when I can get some fresh oysters. Gracias Rafael.
