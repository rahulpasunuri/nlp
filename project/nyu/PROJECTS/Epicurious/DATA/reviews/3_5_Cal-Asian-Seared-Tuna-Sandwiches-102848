Added wasabi to the mayo mix...can't comment fairly on the sandwich because my husband grilled the tuna, and i felt the tuna was overcooked...so it kinda ruined the sandwich for me.

This truly was an exceptional sandwich! I can assure you that this will become a regular addition to my "go to" meals. Healthy, tasty, and interesting. Loved the combination of flavors and textures. Excellent!

I tried the mayo on steamed artichokes because it was so good- yummy!

Wow - amazing and I would put the mayo on cardboard! Light mayo and yellow onions were fine. I used portuguese rolls instead of bread and would use them again since the sandwich is a little messy. I also used a Teriyaki marinade and grilled the tuna for flavor. Definitely a repeat!

I thought this was pretty good, although based on the reviews I guess I expected it to be amazing. We still enjoyed it though and would make again if looking for tuna burgers with an asian flavor.

Kinda like a maki sandwich with the bread acting as the rice.

Huh? The mayo combination would taste good on card board? Sounds like a good testimonial to me! I have an asian dressing that my grandson (who won't eat salad) says it would be good on shoe leather. This is excellent!

(about review below: give the RECIPE a shot...not the mayo and cardboard...) I would also recommend previewing your reviews.

HUGE favorite in my house for a couple years now. I have made this in every incarnation imaginable (as an entree, as a sandwich, as an appetizer, dinner for 2, party fair for 20...etc.) It's all about that ginger-sesame-soy-mayo. You could probably spread that on cardboard and it would rock. You should give it a shot.

I love this recipe! I think this would even be good made into sliders for a party....yum!

the flavored mayonnaise is fantastic. I recommend either halving the mayonnaise or doubling the flavoring ingredients to make for a more intense flavor. The second time I made this I added one minced serrano chili. wasabi powder would also make a great addition.

Great sandwich! Not a big radish fan, but they definitely gave it a little asian "kick". A little wasabi would be good as well. We served them on whole wheat sourdough. Easy to make, and some different flavors. Will make this again.

I used frozen albacore tuna burgers from trader joes on sesame seed buns. This was a very tasty sauce and garnish. I didn't use radishes, but the cucumber and avocado were really nice.

Simple and tasty. I added a little wasabi powder to the mayo and increased the ginger. Also squeezed a lime wedge over the tuna after cooking.

A great tasting, light, summer-time dinner. I used non-fat mayo,increased the onions and ginger, and grilled the tuna. I served the sandwich without any accompaniments because it had so many vegies. Easy! Quick!

Your recipe was great yes I'll make it again but this time I'llput toasted sesame seeds on top of the tuna .
