I used this recipe for a base in trying to recreate a pasta with mushrooms and truffles I had in Croatia. I added sauted white mushrooms and at the end added a drizzle of truffle oil. I replaced bowties for the tortelini.

I made this recipe last night. My wife loved it, as did my 17 month old daughter. Using dried porcini mushrooms is important, since much of the flavor in the sauce comes from the liquid the mushrooms soaked in. One of the previous reviewers mentioned grit in the liquid, but that is easily handled by straining the liquid through a coffee filter or paper towel. I did not have fresh thyme on hand, so I used one tsp of dried thyme, which was plenty. I served it accompanied by a tomato salad. Overall, an easy, relatively quick and delicious meal.

This is an easy recipe as advertised and a time saver. Good, just won't blow you away.

This was only so-so. I love tortellini, I love porcini mushrooms and have some high-quality dried ones I got from a friend who goes to Italy often - but there was something just 'off' about this recipe. Perhaps too much thyme, perhaps ...I don't know. It wasn't what I expected. I might make it again but I think I'd need to change something - not sure what.

I used farfalle instead of tortellini, sauteed leeks before adding the shallots, substituted dill havarti for the parmesan, and added thinly sliced roasted red peppers and fresh parsley to the final mix. So my version was clearly a departure from (and prettier than) the original, but maybe not yummier. It was a decent meal for my boyfriend & I on a random night, but I would have to figure out additional tweaks before I served it to a group.

The amount of tyme in the recipe overpowers the flavor of the mushrooms. If I ever make this again, i will cut it at least in half. I followed the recipe, but I also agree with the other reviews, it needs garlic.

I give this four forks, but my boyfriend gives it three - though we both thought it was delicious and will make it again. Definitely use the dried porcini mushrooms - the flavor really comes through. We agree with another reviewer that it's important to use the 'top' part of the mushroom liquid - too much sand collects at the bottom. We used heavy cream, but the dish didn't taste creamy or heavy at all. A lot of 'salt to taste' is needed. I lived in Milan, and this definitely tastes very Italian! Delicious.

I used fresh instead of dried mushrooms. I think this made the flavor a little milder than the recipe, but very good nonetheless. Would try again with dried mushrooms. The sauce is creamy, but not heavy; very nice flavor. Also extremely easy and quick.

My husband cooked this for the kids on Valentine's Day while I worked on our dinner. The recipe was simple enough that he was able to pull it all together no sweat even though he seldom cooks. I purchased whole wheat tortellini and aside from that modification, he followed the recipe to a T. He and I were both duly impressed and the kids loved it!

If you like mushrooms, you'll love this recipe. My guests wanted to lick their plates (an elegant crew); I regret I had no crispy bread handy for this. I increased the mushroom water a little to geneate more sauce. Easy and delicious.

Dried porcini mushrooms are quite expensive, so I bought a few fresh mushrooms and sauteed them, then followed the rest of the recipe and the sauce was amazing, great flavor. Creamy, but not heavy.

This dish is the perfect combination of simple and delicious. Plus it passed the most critical test - our vegetarian, mushroom-hating son loves it!

Used fresh store-bought tortellini so this recipe was pretty easy for me. Pretty much followed the recipe as is, except I added a bunch of garlic to the shallots and I think that really made the dish! It was a good contrast to the strong mushroomy flavor of the porcini.

Made this for my Father's 78th birthday party for 12. Everyone loved it! I didn't bother with dried porcini mushrooms but bought crimini by mistake at Trader Joes. Used low salt chicken broth instead of cooking broth from mushrooms and still tasted delicious. Also cheated and used dried thyme. I'm sure fresh is better (as usual) but if you're in a pinch - no need to pass on receipe if you only have dried thyme. Tonite will be the 3rd time I'm preparing this dish since August. Will try adding garlic as others have recommended.

This is a very good quick pasta dish. I added fresh mushrooms and minced garlic when I sauteed the shallots and I think it really enhanced the dish. I would absolutely make this again.

This is a real winner and a recipe that I will enjoy this winter with family and friends

I liked the sauce, hated the dried tortellini. I would make it again, but would definitely use fresh. I couldn't even face the leftovers, only because of the pasta. Definitely easy for a weeknight.

I made this as given, and absolutely loved it. I am a mushroom fanatic, however. A few small changes could reduce the "damages" for this recipe: olive oil instead of butter, some other kind of (non- filled) sauce catching pasta shape, half and half, rather than cream. I'll try that one of these days and report back.

I made this for my family last night to mixed reviews. My 15 and 12 year old children have amazingly sophisticated palates for their ages and they absolutely did not like it. My husband thought it was "okay" and I thought it was pretty good though quite heavy. Two forks is about the most generous I can be - what a shame!

hmmm.... sounds tasty but incredibly heavy!! How could something with so many carbs and so much butter and heavy cream not taste good??? I'm sure 4 forks are in order. I will be salivating, but cannot justify making it :o(

This recipe was OK. It was easy to make, which was a plus, but the mushroom flavor completely drowned out the other flavors in the dish. It is definitely not one of the better recipes I've found on this site.

Perfect for a busy weeknight dinner. It's so simple and yet so delicious. I made as per recipe-no changes.

I'm lucky to have porcini growing in the yard. I dry them and use in various recipes. When I saw this one, I had to try it. The fresh thyme is a must. Do not substitute anything for it.

Really delicious, made exactly as written. Very easy. Not too heavy despite the cream.

Really yummy. Next time I'll use a little more cream and a little less mushroom liquid to make it creamier. Be careful when you use liquid from porcini mushrooms, usually there's some sand that settles at the bottom so you don't want to pour it all into your dish.

This is really fast and easy. I cut the recipe in half and used fresh tortellini for my husband and myself. My husband raved that this was as good as anything we have had at any Italian restaurant.
