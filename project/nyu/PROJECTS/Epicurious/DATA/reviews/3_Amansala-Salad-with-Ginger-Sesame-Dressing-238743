I feel similarly regarding wasting food... but the recipe is for 1 person. It's very easy to double (or more), and there you have it, the whole avocado used!

I think this sounds really good but what do I do with the rest of the avocado. I can't stand recipes that call for less than the whole avocado. Doesn't anyone know they don't keep? And I hate being wasteful.

I can't really say this was appealing visually or in taste. I think there are many other recipes that are worth the effort when you want a low fat,diet type diet salad. The dressing saved it, but I won't be making it again.
