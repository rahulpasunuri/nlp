This recipe is a great starting point. I doubled the cumin and cilantro. Added some mixed whole spices I had from another curry and used 1&1/2 cans of coconut milk to get a spice level and consistency that I like in my curries. It's a great recipe to keep in mind while shopping at the local farmer's market.

Great stock recipe (not something I'd make for a special event). Also try coconut milk instead of skim for a more authentic flavor.

I agree with others about adding more spices. 2x worked for us. I also added cubed butternut squash which added interesting flavor and depth to the taste. I left out the broccoli but included raisins and slivered almonds. Basmati rice made for a perfect pairing!

Good, filling, wintery meal. I used a can of coconut milk instead of evaporated milk; added more of all three spices (1 or 1.5 T curry, 2 t cumin, 1 t crushed red pepper); and didn't use potatoes, but I bet they would've been good. I just didn't have any. Overall, an eas,y tasty recipe, but not outstanding.

Adding fish sauce to this recipe gives it more flavor.

I thought this recipe was very good, but I ended up doubling the evaporated milk and seasonings to create more curry sauce. I also added a little bit of sugar to the sauce to give it a slightly sweet curry flavor. It worked out nicely with the red pepper for a little heat. This is definitely the type of dish that tastes even better the 2nd day after the seasoning and flavors have had time to marry into one harmonious and complex overarching flavor profile.

Great dish! I used double the spice based on others reviews, but it was REALLY spicy after that. I would use less spices next time. The other issue was the evaporated milk. I added it 1/3 of a cup at a time to allow all the veggies to absorb the liquid and it turned out beautifully creamy!! My guest loved it!!

This recipe definately needed a little TLC. I took some advice and used a can of coconut milk and doubled the spices as well as adding a generous pinch of both ground ginger and cinnamon (sugar too). I omitted the broccoli and cauliflower and used zucchini and extra tomatoes instead. Toward the end of cooking, which took longer than stated, I added a handful of golden raisins and topped the finished product with tosted slivered almonds. All in all, I think it worked out quite well. I will definately make this one again!

After upping the spices (including adding cayenne), I'd also recommend adding a generous dollop of garlic- ginger paste (from the Indian market) at the end of the cooking time for the onions. Also, since any veggies can be used, try it with green beans and/or asparagus in season! And to make it less healthy (you only live once, right? it's also great made with a can of coconut milk instead of the evaporated skim milk, and you can suatee the onions in ghee instead of oil. Since I'm not a vegetarian, I've also had good results adding either chicken (sauteeing with or after the onions) or shrimp, but it's just as good without any meat. Great leftover - AND if you serve it with yummy plain yogurt on the side, it's divine.

Absolutely increase the spices on this one, but otherwise it's a tasty curry.

I agree with the other reviewers - this recipe needs tons more spices added. Also putting all the vegetables in before the milk helps them absorb the flavoring better. I added a vegetable boullion cube for added flavor, and used zucchini, red pepper and mushrooms in addition to the vegetables listed in the recipe. I also used brown basmati rice. Delicious recipe, but it definitely needs some doctoring!

first time around, this recipe was pretty blandsville. second time, I of course added more curry and decided to actually cook the vegetables in the pan and let them take in all the spices before adding the milk (which was coconut) and letting it simmer down a bit. now that's delicious!

This is much better the second day. I'm in agreement about the milk - too thin and mine seemed to curdle. Next time I'll try coconut milk or I'll just omit it. Definitely needs more spice - I used cumin and hot curry paste which was nice and spicy. I also added red peppers, zucchini and sweet potato instead of carrots, broccoli and white potato. And of course, brown basmati rice instead of white rice.... yes, I know, hardly the same recipe at all - this is a good start.. :)

But I did change it a bit. I didn't have potato, so I used peeled and cubed acorn squash. I used drained canned diced tomato, and I didn't have caulifower. This seems like such a good idea that you can use what you have as long as you have a starch to absorb the evaporated skim milk and spices. Well, I did make it again, this time with half and half. It was just as good.

Found this recipe very disappointing. Sauce was much too thn to stand up to the vegetables also needed much more oomph in terms of spicing. I ended up scrapping it and creating my own.

Making this recipe with homemade Indian curry spice paste, makes all the difference in the world! I rarely use curry powder for much more than salads, appitizers, etc. Since this curry lends itself to more southern India, tropical, I used chopped peanuts, and added them towards the end of the cooking process. This was quite good. I did use coconut milk however, and it made it very rich and quite tasty! I also used an authentic tomato chutney that I was making at the same time. It made this curry a fantastic dinner! If anyone would like the recipe for this authentic Indian Tomato chutney recipe, e-mail me, I will be more than happy to send it along. Bon Appetit!

I added lots of garlic to the onions, and quadrupled the curry powder and cumin. I also added snow peas, used canned tomatoes and deleted the potatoes. The dish was easy to make, fast and delicious!

I made this with some of the substitutions suggested and doubling the spices. It was a hit at my house full of picky eaters! Even the one who hates vegetables loved it (though he did pick out the broccoli). My housemates have even asked me to make it again! Tips: using condensed milk gave the sauce a nice depth and creaminess, and I'll used canned tomatoes next time--the skins of the plum tomatoes separated from the tomato meat and formed unappetizing, chewy red blobs. I added the milk late, as suggested by another reviewer, and had no problems with curdling.

This recipe was a lot of work for something that was just so-so. I used coconut milk because I had it, and did double the spices as recommended. I won't add it to my favorites list.

I didn't have the previous reviewers' comments while I was preparing this dish, but I would definitely agree with adding more spices. It wasn't un-delicious, but I just got the sense that all the wonderful spices were somehow smothered and lost.

I love curries and am always looking for new versions. I fixed this tonight, with a few alterations... used 2% milk, ¼ cup sour cream, can diced tomatoes, added FAR more spices than calls for, and spinach. Didn't have cauliflower, though. Everyone loved it! I had never used regular milk in a curry, so was good to try. I prefer having more sauce, so added extra milk (½ cup or so) half-way through cooking, plus about ½ cup vegetable broth - made perfect amount of sauce. I will definately make this again, and try other vegetables as suggested.

I would recommend you treble the quantities of spices - a bit too bland with just the teaspoon quantities. A couple of crushed birds eye chillies added with the spices just gives it that little extra kick. Wasn't sure about the evaporated milk, but in fact it was very tasty. I will definitely make this again.

I substituted coconut milk for evap. milk and used yellow squash, red peppers and potatoes for the vegies. A half cup of chicken broth added depth to the sauce. With these changes the recipe was great.

I made this recipe but with a little tweak; I increased the curry, decreased the red pepper and when I sauteed the onions I deglazed the pan with dry sake and let it reduce slightly. Instead of milk, I used 1 can of coconut milk (Goya) and about 1/2 cup more of dry sake. At the end I added peas, golden raisins & grated, toasted coconut... Served with lentils and brown basmati. The fresh cilantro is great - and don't forget to salt!!! Delicious!

I have made this three times. The first time the evap. milk curdled and the end result looked unattractive although it tasted very good. The second time, I put the full amount of tomatoes in the pan and added a cup of water. When the vegetables were all cooked through, I reduced the heat and stirred in the milk which doesn't curdle if the temp. is lower and the cooking time shorter. The result was perfect. The third time I left out the milk altogether for a very low-fat version which is also very good. In all versions I used a different vegetable (pumpkin, turnip, cauliflower)in place of the broccoli which overcooks too easily and doesn't stand up well as a leftover. This is now a favourite recipe.

condensed full milk tastes a lot richer!

Coconut milk rather than evap. skim milk makes a deeper, more satisfying curry. Buy light coconut milk if you don't want the fat.

I had high hopes for this dish, but it was very so-so. The sauce lacked any depth whatsoever - I would have preferred a little butter, salt and pepper over the veggies than this concoction! I also had a problem with the evap. skim milk separating because it was cooked for so long, leaving the dish looking pretty terrible as well. I ended up making a yogurt based curry sauce to finish the dish to give it some creaminess. The broccoli cooked faster than the cauliflower & carrots and looked a bit worse for wear. IF I ever made this dish again, I would steam the veggies ahead of time and fold the sauce into them a few minutes in advance.

Easy to prepare, and the results were warm and satisfying. I added a little boneless cubed en breast and a few pieces of shrimp. Delicious.

This is a really tasty dinner. I make it all the time!
