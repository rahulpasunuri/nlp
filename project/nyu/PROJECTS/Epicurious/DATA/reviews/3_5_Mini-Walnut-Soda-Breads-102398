I make these every St. Patrick's Day. Everyone loves them. They are hearty, dense, and slightly sweet. Delicious!

These breads are delicious and versatile. I made them plain the first time, and then added dates, raisins, and prumes in addition to the walnuts. Also delicious.

This recipe is foolproof -- marvelous soda bread every time. People always ask for the recipe. I throw in 3T of caraway seeds -- and sometimes raisins. Try this recipe... you won't be disappointed! It is excellent for breakfast!

I made this recipe for a St. Patrick's Day dinner. Everyone loved it. I made smaller rounds, ending up with 12 rolls.

These baked in 25" and we enjoyed them with cheese fondue. Delicious, but since I like to try new recipes I won't repeat this one.

Made these as directed and they were divine--a friend and I ate them warm out of the oven with herbed camembert cheese. They have a nice, slightly crispy crust, and a beautifully soft inside. Will definitely make them again--maybe with some dried cranberries added.

I LOVED THESE! They were easy to make, tasted wonderful (subtly sweet) and were great with cheese, jam, or anything else I ended up putting on them. They even lasted for days (I cook for just me). I'm a big fan.

I made the bread, used pistachios instead of walnut(didn't have any) I really like this soda bread, but I like soda bread. My husband didn't. He felt it wasn't real bread or muffin. No real personality. So lesson, I think you need to a fan of soda breads to like this. PS I made 2 loaves cooked for abouyt 50 minutes, turn out great

I made this for a St Patrick's Day Tea. I opted to make one large loaf and then sliced it. The baking time increased to nearly an hour but the results were wonderful. Very dense and flavorful.

I've made this quite a few times and have given it also to friends and relatives. They have all loved it.
