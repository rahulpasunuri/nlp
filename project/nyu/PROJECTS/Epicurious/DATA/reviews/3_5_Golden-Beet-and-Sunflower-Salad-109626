I've never made this for anyone who didn't love it. It's also flexible - tonight, because of winter availability, I'm making it with red beets, arugula instead of the sprouts, and feta instead of sunflower seeds.

This is yummy! The golden beets have a wonderful, mild but sweet flavor. Didn't think the sunflower seeds added much-- you could substitute pine nuts or something else for crunch. Will definitely make again.

I used this recipe as a jumping off place for a wonderful salad. Basically, I used the dressing on a mix of golden and red beets (Cook and store separately so the red ones don't bleed on the golden ones.), large diced avocado, & quinoa. I served it on a large lettuce leaf with a 'nest' of mizuna The next day I added diced chicken to the leftovers for a main course salad. Rave reviews.

This was excellent and very easy! We roasted the beets and dressed them a full day before the party, and the beets came out fabulous. We used both golden and purple beets (I kept them separated overnight while marinating) and arranged them on the serving plate in beautiful bands of color. Very popular!!

Would like to try this, but notice that though we're asked to reserve the greens, they don't seem to be used in the salad. (I could, of course, prepare them in another way for another meal, but can I replace the sprouts with the blanched greens? ) Please advise.

We use this as a wonderful light meal. Also great with other dishes.

Yum! I used a premade mixture of broccoli, clover and mustard sprouts instead of the sunflower, and some minced white onion in place of the shallots. But as I said earlier... yum!

This delicious salad was a hit in summer and is a hit in autumn!

A dinner party comprised of at least 50% beet haters all gave this a thumbs up.
