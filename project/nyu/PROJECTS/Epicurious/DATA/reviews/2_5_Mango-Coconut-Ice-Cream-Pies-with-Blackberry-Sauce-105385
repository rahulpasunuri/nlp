I couldn't find blackberries, so I used frozen raspberries instead. The sauce was wonderful, however I found the coconut in the recipe too much, and I even cut back on it. Maybe if the coconut was chopped finely it would have been better, otherwise it was too chewy.

I live amongst sorbet freaks, and they rated this recipe four forks. I'm not as great a fan, but still thought the pies tasted good. Fairly easy to invert, and a snap to put together. Note: I couldn't find frozen blackberries either, so I had to use a bag of frozen mixed berries. I think it worked out fine. Also used just plain old brandy in the sauce.

Anyone in the Toronto area know where the heck I can buy frozen blackberries?

I have made this dish several times and people keep talking about it. One time, I accidentally bought Mango ice cream and not the sorbet. Still tasted great!!

To Nowhere: You can use canned coconut milk to make coconut ice cream. For kicks, add some rum ! Add toasted coconut as well.

To Nowhere: This sounds good and when I make it I am planning to use Haagen Daaz which makes a great Mango Sorbet as well as Coconut.

To Nowhere; if they don't sell fresh mangoes in your neck of the woods, buy canned. If your store doesn't carry either, tell them to get some for you. (They don't charge extra for the service because they want you to be a happy customer.) Then just puree in the blender and freeze. Add sugar as necessary. Turn vanilla ice cream into coconut ice cream by adding toasted coconut and some coconut flavoring (should be available with the other flavorings at your store; if not, ask for it). Don't give up, improvise and create something delicious! Good luck!
