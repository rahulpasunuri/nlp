The concept is fun. Though I think it looks a little awkward. Perhaps, if the ganache running down the sides were thicker. Like if it were poured a little colder, or a little more of it were used. I like to see the cake and the contrast of vanilla, though. So I like the idea of exposing the cake. This looks like a fantastic cake for home. I think if I were using it in a bake shop I'd torte the layers differently.

I must say this looks very good! I wasn't impress with the taste what so ever. Everybody liked it, I did too but there is so many other cake that are better. If I do it again, I'll use another chocolate cake recipe this one wasn't my favorite at all! the buttercream and frosting are good.

This is a great cake. Told my little nephew about this 'Mile High' cake and he really wanted to try it out. I made it for his 9th birthday and had him over to help me ice it. Great cake - everyone loved it.

This is the first time I've written a review for an Epicurious recipe. That's saying a lot because I use this website almost daily! I like Epicurious because I can rely on the reviews, so I don't waste time making recipes that don't taste good, or that I can follow other users' suggestions and tweak the recipes to make them better. That said, this recipe, and the reviews, were completely off the mark. This cake looked awesome in the picture. And it tasted awesome, which is one reason why I'm giving it 2 stars. The other reason why it deserves 2 stars is that the directions are very precise. The authors tell you exactly how much batter (2 3/4 cups) to put into each cake pan, as well as what to do if your butter-cream is curdling. That was really helpful. However, I followed the instructions to a t and 2 of my layers fell apart. One of them was not salvageable. So my 6 layer cake became a 4 layer cake, and the middle layers were very crumbly. It made the cake look awful. I thought I may have over-baked the first round, so I baked the second round exactly to the directions (took it out at 50 minutes) and it still crumbled! I was really let down. I wouldn't make this cake again, even though the flavors were definitely there.

This is an awesome cake and much easier to make than it looks. My daughter and I made it for Father's Day and everyone loved it! We spread a raspberry jam over each layer before the butter cream, and we used fresh raspberries to decorate the top of the cake after applying the ganache. My husband asked us to make it again for his birthday!

I made this cake TWICE. Everyone in the dinner party say it is the most delicious cake ever! This cake has not finish look because of the ganache but after anyone taste this cake wouldn't mind the look of this cake. One of my layer broke in a half but I patched with buttercream. It was my first time to make a buttercream so had a difficult time to come out right. Other than that, it is a most amazing cake!

This is an amazing cake. My new son-in-law is a chocoholic so I'll make it for him. It wasn't as hard as I expected and froze the layers too so I could slice them. Just terrific.

Made it for Father's Day. My husband has a sweet tooth and even he thought it was rich. I could not eat it. He told me this one was a keeper. One of my layers crumbled but after freezing it, I was able to cut it and piece it into one of the middle layers. No one could tell it was broken. Did I mention he was going in for a stress test the next day. I never thought he would pass!!

Delicious! To sadash: have you tried the Spectrum brand organic palm oil shortening? Palm oil is solid at room temperature and works amazingly well in place of Crisco or lard for things like tamales, pie crust, and for this recipe. It's also very tasty. Great for people who are lactose intolerant and can't have butter in baked goods.

Matt Lewis and Renato Poliafito own an incredible bakery (Baked) near where I live. I adore the entire cookbook, including this recipe (even if you have to use shortening).

Excellent cake!! I followed the recipe and it turned out great!! Had little bit of difficulty to cut the cake, because it was so big!

This cake was easy to prepare for a 6 layer cake... instead of hot water I used french roast coffee and I painted a Godiva choc. simple syrup on each layer. I am surprised and happy to say I needed NO support dowels to keep this wonderfully show-stopping cake steady. Enjoy!
