My whole family loved it. I added some sprouts which worked well, and fewer peppers, though it was still quite spicey. Will definitely make not only again, but probably often!

Loved the shrimp and the kick. I served this over jasmine rice and sauteed the lemongrass, shallots and scallions in peanut oil before mixing it with the chilies. Yummy!

Heyt, forgot to mention. I served this over rice rather than over lettuce as a salad.

I made this the other night and have been dreaming about it ever since. I didn't have the fresh chilies, so I used the red chili paste..srichaca or whatever it is. I peeled and deveined the shrimp, but otherwise followed the recipe..except I don't use fresh lemongrass. I love the lemongrass that comes in a tube (can also get cilantro and basil in the tube). They taste great and I always have that ingredient on hand. I used extra lemongrass. Everybody loved it including my picky kids. My husband thought it tasted "very Thai".

Friends of ours made this for us last night and it was fairly easy and absolutely delicious. The shrimp were grilled without the shrimp shells.

I boiled 4lb. tiger shrimp then cooled in ice water. I peeled the shrimp leaving the tails on.I only doubled the rest of the recipe due to no shells. then let marinate for 3 or 4 hours.Used thai basil for mint and some cannola oil to make things stick. Brought to wine dinner and it disappeared.Verygood.

The sauce was delicious, but after removing the shells from the shrimp, most of the flavors were lost. The meal was also tedious to eat having to remove the shells from the shrimp while trying to eat. It tasted ok, but was not enough to fill two 30ish adults.

Delicious, easy, and healthy! The chillies make quite a spicy sauce, but don't worry - once the shrimp are shelled, it's not too hot. Also, I added fresh pineapple chunks to the salad bed which added a nice fresh balance to the spice. I prefer the pineapple to tomato. Serves 2 as a wonderful light summer meal.

Excellent recipe. I searched through many Thai cookbooks for a spicy squid salad recipe that tasted like a good restaurants, with no luck, but here it is. I've made it with grilled squid, shrimp and scallops. All excellent

Loved this recipe! I admit I did cut back on the amount of peppers called for because, although my husband and I both love spicy food, I was afraid the amt. called for in this recipe might make it too hot to eat! Anyway, the entire dish with the lettuce, tomatoes and onions topped with the grilled shrimp made not only a beautiful dinner but a delicious one!
