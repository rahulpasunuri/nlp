I meant dessert!

I have not yet made this recipe. I can't recall ever seeing a recipe for streusel that used granulated sugar. Usually streusel is made with brown sugar. Could this be the reason people found the desert too sweet?

As many others have said, be suer to cut the sugar in half as it's sweet enough. I did't have enough pears so added 2 apples. Also didn't have dried cherries or cranberries so used dried apricots which turned out great. Everyone loved it and I'll definitely make it again!

My aunt made this for a dinner over the weekend and it was a hit with everyone there. Fabulous.

great recipe. The filling is scrumptious. I didn't want to use nuts, so I used a cup of oats + 1/4c flax seed meal. I cut back on the sugar.

Yummmmm. I halved the recipe, and mixed in an apple because I didn't have enough pears and also used less sugar and it was great. Will definitely be making this again.

Loved this recipe. It was easy to make and very flavorful. I agree, though, that the sugar should be halved. It was VERY sweet...too sweet, in my opinion.

Nice twist on the traditional fruit crisp. The filling was thick so I thinned it out with brandy and then cooked it a little longer. My husband loved it and said it was company worthy. Recipe was easily halved and baked in individual ramakins for less time. YUM!

We made this to try a recipe with nutmeg as the only spice (not the only flavoring, but the only spice!)--and it's great! Half the amount of sugar in the streusel and half the amount of sugar in the fruit is the way to go.

This is a delicious crisp. I did not have enough ripe pears, so mixed in two apples with the pears. This worked fine. The tang of the cherries and orange zest help off-set the sweetness, but it is still a very sweet dessert. I might cut back on the sugar a bit when making it again. I chopped the walnuts very coursely and the big chunks looked and tasted great in the streusal. Best when served fresh and warm with vanilla ice cream. My husband said "This stuff is dynamite!" High praise coming from him.:)

This was a very tasty crisp but I did make some changes to it. I cut back on the amount of nutmeg as I was afraid it would be overpowering. I added some cinnamon instead and it was just right. I also did not have cherries but craisins worked just as well. I did find the crisp a little too sweet though and next time I would definitly cut back on the sugar that is added to the fruit. Overall it was great though and I would definitely make it again.
