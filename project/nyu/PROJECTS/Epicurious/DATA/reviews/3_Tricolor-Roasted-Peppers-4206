This was a very versitile recipe. We put the roasted peppers on sandwiches and also used it as a side dish for dinner with a roast we cooked. I was pleased with the outcome and would make this again.

These are WONDERFUL and I've been making them and giving as gifts since this recipe first appeared. I wouldn't change a thing! I have 36 pounds of peppers coming in tomorrow morning and can't wait to start canning!! Enjoy!

Excellent! Important to bring dish up to room temp, as olive oil tends to congeal in fridge. Used yellow and red peppers, since green ones represent supreme challenge to our gastro-intestinal tracts. Roasted peppers on outdoor gas grill, which worked well, but with constant attention.Great on salads and sandwiches.
