These are the best! My daughter doesn't eat dairy so I substitute a stick of Earth Balance, and since we like a smaller, thicker cookies, I use a full cup of flour. I don't move the pans around, either, smaller cookies only take 11-12 minutes, and I prep the cookie sheets by lining them with parchment paper But my favorite thing is that any substitution of nuts and dried fruits work'. I've used cherries and craisins instead of apricots, almonds, pecans and hazelnuts in lieu of pistachios. Wonderful!

I had mixed results with this, but I did vary the recipe. Butter was salted, used 1/4c brown sugar and 1/4c stevia, no added salt, 1 tsp. cinnamon. Taste: to die for. Texture/appearance: not so hot. None of the cookies flattened out, despite moving the pans as directed. That may be a function of the reduced sugar, and next time I'll put them on "convection" and won't go through the hassle of switching racks, and may add some applesauce to make them more chewy, less dense.

without a doubt the worst cookie recipe ever, and I am not a novice. Can't think what I could have done to get such a different result as the praisers of this recipe. The dough spread out into an uneven pancake - ugly shape and color, and the apricot lends a flavor suggesting soap. (I like apricots - maybe it was the combination of flavors that produced this?) I made these for my bridge group this afternoon. Fortunately I have time to go out and buy replacements.

These are great! They look very Christmasy with the green and orange of the pistachios and the apricots. I didn't change a thing, and they came out perfectly. These are going on my list of Christmas cookies.

Using apricots and pistachios was unique and tasty, but would reduce sugar. Baking was a pain. A shiny baking sheet would not release cookies; had to bust 'em off. Silpat with cooking spray worked better but cookies spread wide and into one another. Texture of finished cookies improves on the second or third day in sealed container. Will evict this one from my recipe box.

not bad! I substituted with whole wheat flour, to try to make them a little healthier. I have a feeling the kids will not be crazy about them. Glad I only made one batch.

I loved these! Even though I baked one batch of them for a little too long, they were as delicious crunchy as they were chewy. I added some chocolate chips in there, too, which tasted great. I would definitely recommend them.

I loooved this recipe. Firm on the outside and nice and moist/chewy on the inside. A very comforting flavour (not too overwhelming) and nutritious too! I would highly recommend it.

Simple cookie for when you're not in the mood for chocolate chip. Will definitely use different nut/dried fruit combinations in the future.

I loved this! Omitted Pistachios, as there weren't any on hand, but, to add another ingredient, sprinkled Unhulled Sesame seeds over each cookie before baking. Good study food for late night paper-writing!

These are very good cookies. I made them as written, but used a heaping 2 t. scoop to measure dough. I baked them about 14-15 minutes on parchment paper. Next time, I'll probably add a few more apricots.

These were great; maybe I'd cut down on the sugar a bit. I must have made this smaller because the quantity turned out to be about 30.

I would DOUBLE this recipe if I were you! It only makes about 16 cookies and that's just not enough for me. This is the second time I have made this recipe and they are gone in a flash. I doubled the pistachios this last time because I love the rich nutty flavor they bring and add just a touch more vanilla.

Considering the ease and speed of preparation, these are very good cookies. Like others, I substituted different types of dried fruit and nuts for the apricots and pistachios, using what I had on hand at the time: golden raisins and pecans. It's a very versatile recipe that will tolerate all sorts of abuse! I didn't make my cookies as large as called for and got 24 from the batter. Will definitely make these again, maybe even with the correct ingredients!

I increased the pistachios and apricots because they are two of my favorite flavors, but the cookies were still a little bland. I would follow the advice of another reviewer and keep the recipe, but play around with the kind of nuts and fruit you use.

These are some of the best cookies my husband and I have ever eaten. Really yummy deluxe. Very crisp with a bit of chewiness from the apricots.

to make the cookies rise higher and have more air pockets, bake them on parchment paper; to make them flatter, crispier and brown around the edges, bake them on metal.

The almond-like quality of the pistacchios the slight bitterness of the apricots and the quantity of sugar combine to make these cookies a really amazing stand-in for Amaretti (Italian for "little bitters"), my favorite cookie.

what happens if you use quick-cooking oats instead of old-fashioned as the recipe calls for? does it totally ruin the cookies?

They were ok, - a good flavour and really nice when they'd just come out of the oven, but a day later they had turned into rocks!

These were okay. I made them twice over the holidays. I followed the directions exactly, but the bottom of my 1st batch got too brown. So I reduced the baking time on the second try and also added more pistachios and apricots. Much better!

Great oatmeal cookie recipe. I am not a huge fan of neither apricots or pistachios, so I instead added dried cranberries and raw walnuts (chopped) that I bought from Trader Joe's --the same amount as indicated for both the apricot and pistachio on the original recipe. I underbaked them a bit, and the exterior was still a little crispy, the inside of the cookie a little chewy, just the way I like it. Wonderful recipe. Second recipe I've had great success with from Epicurious!

I used golden raisins instead of apricuts and they turned out delicious. A very light, unusual cookie. Definitely a "keeper."

Simply wonderful cookies! However, I did substitue brazil nuts chopped into medium to large sized chunks -- because they are my favourite. The flavour mixed well with the apricots. This is very much a keeper!

Nice and easy little cookies. I substituted crystallized ginger for the apricots, as I had none in the house and dislike raisins in cookies. It worked well, even with the cinnamon (which seems like an odd combination in hindsight). I reduced the size of the cookie and cooked them about 11 minutes. A little crispier than I normally like oatmeal cookies, but it works for this cookie.

The best oatmeal cookies I've ever eaten. Did substitute raisins for the apricots. The pistacios were an excellent touch. Took them to a church gathering where they were a bit hit. Oh, made smaller cookies--rounded teaspoons. Worked great.

These cookies were fun to make, but even more fun to eat! They also looked quite impressive, and elicited "oohs" and "aahs" when I put them on the dessert table.

These cookies have a very nice taste- I only baked them for 9 minutes. Apricots are a nice change from the traditional rasins. I thought the cookies tasted best the 2nd and 3rd day rather than right out of the oven.

For someone who isn't used to baking cookies this is an incredibley easy recipe with delicious results. I used pecans instead of pistachios which worked really well, but then again this recipe is very easy to play with.

everyone loved these cookies. i do think they had a lot of butter. i also had to use golden raisins in place of the apricots since i didn't want to make a trip to the store. i will make them again and with the apricots.

Loved by all. Added extra nuts and apricots.

These cookies were delicious. I'll definitely make them again. Instead of making really big cookies I used a heaping teaspoonfull (instead of a tablespoonfull)and reduced baking time by a few minutes. Also, next time I will add a bit more apricots because I love the taste.

These cookies are delicious. Moist, chewy and good flavor combo of apricots and pistachio. I added more apricots than called for. Made them for my family and they are asking for them again.
