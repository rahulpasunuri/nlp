This is still the best ribs.

My family thought ribs should be ordered out, not made at home...until I made these. I apply the rub at least 30 minutes prior to cooking. I bake them covered & in basting sauce for about 2 hours in a 350* oven, flipping them every 30 minutes. At that point, they can be frozen. Prior to serving, we grill them for about 5 minutes per side. The meat falls off the bones. Fabulous!!!

I'm not going to rate this recipe as my friends and I made a few changes based on the comments made by other users. That being said, this is such a good recipe for ribs! First, we doubled the recipe and didn't have room for all four racks on our charcoal grill, so we used packets of wood chips in our much larger gas grill. We set the temperature for 250 degrees and basted and turned every 30 minutes. We put a new packet of apple wood chips in every hour. The ribs were tender and had a yummy smoky flavor. In the rub, I used 2/3 sweet Hungarian paprika and 1/3 smoked paprika and brown sugar instead of white. In the basting sauce I used cider vinegar instead of white. We rubbed the ribs the night before cooking. After coming off the grill, we covered them tightly with foil and let them rest for 30 minutes before carving. They were a hit with everyone at our Superbowl party, even the kids!

Made this on our Big Green Egg. Spicy and delicious!!! It took 4 hours on the Egg with time to rest. Substitutions I made include: brown sugar instead of white, combinations of different types of paprika, less salt, cider vinegar instead of white, and I used applewood chips instead of hickory. I also let the ribs sit for an hour before smoking/grilling. Outstanding!

Making these again for the 4th of July. It is my master recipe! These are great cooked in the oven (250 degrees), gas grill or charcoal. Just read through the reviews for the different techniques. The "reviews" are worth the read. A little extra work and time, but the results are outstanding!

Husband loved this. As he doesn't like too much salt and to make it less spicy for the kids, I omitted the chili powder, cut way back on the black pepper, 1 tsp for salt. As per other reviewer, cooked in oven for 2 hours at 350 and then finished off on gas grill. Worked out great although there was significant flaming on grill. Did not bother with basting sauce and we did not feel it needed it. Also, with lack of time, I put the rub on and cooked right away.

i too rub, cover and refer overnight. however i smoke and cook in weber gas grill - i use a cast iron smoke pan,6x9 inches, in bottom of grill filled with 8 - 10 hardwood brickets that are white hot and ready, covered with mesquite chips soaked in water - i only have one of 3 gas burners on. i place no ribs over lite burner - i baste every 20 - 30 min rotating ribs for an even cook adding a couple of bricks and more chips as needed to maintain the smoke - this results in a 240 degree temp or so for me - i turn up temp at end to brown off if needed - a little tuffer method than when i had a charcoal weber was but it works. seems to take about 3 hours or so to get to desired doneness depending on the ribs you be cooking. yes let im sit for 30 minutes before cutting and eating .

We just use the rub along with the Clark's recipe for baking the ribs and the combination of the 2 recipes is deeeeeelicious or finger lickin good! We used to think we had to barbecue them outside, but this slow cooking method using Clark's on this site is wonderful, and tender and no fuss with the barbeque. I get a disposable pan and throw it in the garbage with the bones!

This recipe just can't be beat. Delectable, finger-lickin' good ribs. A few tips: apply the rub a half hour ahead of time and allow to stand at room temperature. Also, allow the ribs to rest for 30 minutes before serving for maximum tenderness--I wrap my ribs in aluminum foil and and then place them inside a large paper bag, which I close up tightly. The hard part is waiting--the aroma will drive you crazy. But pork benefits from resting after cooking--allows the juices to resettle. My family loves this recipe--definitely give this a try.

Based on the rave reviews, I went for this. Admittedly, didn't use a smoker. Don't have one. Didn't use hickory chips, didn't have any. But still, I figured it would be tasty, cooked on my covered gas grill. Wrong. Totally blah. Very little taste from the rub or the marinade, even with all that Tabasco and pepper.

I'm joining the crowd. These ARE the best ribs I've ever cooked and possibly eaten. I used country spare ribs since they are meatier. The slow-cooking over wood plus occasional basting with a vingegar basting sauce made the ribs succulent and tender. My husband cooked them in a smoker for four hours, and I basted them three times. Usually I half recipes I try for the first time, but since the cooking process on these was so long, I made the whole amount and was not sorry. The taste of the rub and the smokiness of the meat make rubbing on barbecue sauce optional. Following the recipe exactly, I did not think these were hot at all, just pleasantly spicy and sweet. This is a keeper.

This is the one! Ever since we went to Hoggy's in Columbus I've been searching, and this is as close as I've come to their super-duper ribs!!! I used sea salt, cider vinegar, and instead of tabasco I used Thai Garlic Chili Pepper Sauce. I don't have a smoker, so I put each rack of rubbed ribs in separate shallow cooking pans, split the basting sauce between the 2 pans by pouring it over each rack, covered the pans and stuck them in a 350 oven for 2+ hours, turning the ribs every 30 minutes. Before serving, I put them on a hot grill - 5 minutes on each side. I put the leftover basting sauce from the baking pans in small dishes for sopping. Yummmmmmmmmmy!

Folks, this is how real barbeque is done! I've made this recipe at least a dozen times now, and my family goes into a frenzy every time. I cut the salt in half, as other reviewers suggested, and use a few pieces of wood from an apple tree for the smoke. I cannot imagine doing this on a gas grill; you need adequate smoke to get that quarter inch of red smoked meat on the outside, and I have only ever been able to do this with a real grill. Also, if you put the rub on the ribs and let it sit for an hour before tossing them on the grill, the spices will adhere better.

Made these tonight on the barbecue (don't have a gas grill) and they were tender and tasted great. I used boneless pork ribs and didn't precook them -- just used the spice rub, grilled them for 12 minutes on each side and basted them. They turned out perfectly. I'll definitely make these again!

Oh my, these were very yummy. I have always used baby backs on a gas grill but decided to venture out and try the smoker with spareribs. I did not find them salty at all (always use kosher or sea salt to prevent saltiness.) I did finish them on the gas grill as I did want to add a chipotle bbq sauce (last 10 min of cooking.) All my guests were thrilled with the results

will make again, but do cut back on the salt. My husband felt that the ribs were too salty. Made on a gas grill using baby back ribs. Did not take 4 hours, only needed 3 hours to cook the baby back ribs.

Definitely use a smoker. If you don't, is not barbecue, it is just another recipe for baked ribs!

BBQ Restaurant quality! Delicious. My family fell in love with these and so did a friend that dropped in that evening. Very, Very tender. I baked them in a 350'F oven for 2 hours with the rub and used the baste without the Tabasco (we are not lovers of tabasco and the ribs were spicy enough with the chili powder). Then I put them on the grill, using charcoal with some wood chips, with some Kansas City BBQ sauce. I cooked them till the sauce was baked to the meat, and nice and sticky. Everyone was licking their fingers! In fishing terms, this is definitely a Keeper!

DID NOT USE THE SMOKER ON THIS.Use the rub and wrap ribs up in aluminum foil and bake in oven at 350 for 1 1/2 hours. Get grill hot and cook ribs for a few minutes on each side to brown. Reduce heat and coat with ur BBQ sauce and close lid for a few minutes. AWESOME. ^^THE BUMPKIN GOURMET^^.

This recipe is very good and easy. I also cut down on the tabasco and it is delicious!! I followed the receipe using the chips/kettle grill and found it just as good using a gas grill which took less time. YUMMY!!

Great Flavor, I am a beginner, but I have learn a lot about Pork Ribs from this recipe. I strongly recommend to spend the time on the grill. You will understand why it has its popularity.

I've made this recipe a few times and just love it. I used baby-back ribs on one occasion, and them turned out great also (and took less time to cook). I totally agree with the reviewer who loves charcoal. I do too. Did the gas grill thing, electric grill thing, nothing compares to a good hardwood fire.

I have made this twice now using country style pork ribs. The meat turns out tender and juicy and the crust is a real taste treat. For those with less tolerance for spicy hot dishes, I recommend reducing the tabasco by half. Use coarse-ground black pepper for the best effect. I also used a smoker rather than a kettle grill. The first time I used hickory chips, the second, apple chips. The apple chips gave it a softer smoke flavor. I'll use this one over and over. Next time, maybe a beef brisket.

Fantastic recipie, made it for the 4th of July and everyone loved it. Ribs were tender and flavorful. I made 8 1/2 lbs of ribs and they were all gone. I used my Webber gas grill (Off, Off, High) with wood chips in the smoker box and Foil Package full of woodchips with holes poked in the top over the rear burner and kept the temp at 250F for 4 hours and it worked great. FYI: I picked up this tip: to remove the tough skin from the back of the ribs all you have to do is make a small cut under it with a knife about half an inch to get a flap going and then grab it with a paper towel. If you dont us a paper towel you can't pull it off with your fingers but with the towel it comes off easily. I highly recomend that you remove this skin/fat/whatever from the back of you ribs it makes for a better finished product.

I will never be convinced that a gas grill can perform nearly as well as a coal kettle. You simply cannot get the great, authentic open-flame flavor that defines true barbeque. Use real hardwood coal and soaked chips for better smoking. Also a drip pan filled with chicken stock and spices. Coal or gas, a vertical rib rack allows space for six or more racks at a time. Gas is great for a lot of grilling chores but for this recipe is literally nothing more than an outdoor oven. Of course pro chefs with cooking shows endorse gas. I would too if the company gave me a $10,000 outdoor kitchen free of charge.

These ribs were fantastic! Unfortunately, I only barbecued 1 rack. The rub worked well and was easy to prepare. The basting sauce was also easy to prepare. I used a taragon white wine vinegar and I found the salt to be a bit much so I did not add to the basting sauce. I will definitely make this again. I used a kettle BBQ with coals.

I really liked it...my wife thought it was to hot. I cooked it on a gas grill on the side with no fire at about 250 degrees. I tried it after four hours and it was not fully cooked. I ended up cooking it for almost five hours.

Your time will be approimately the same. The beauty of the gas grill is that when you learn where 250° is on your dial settings you can always attain that themperature every time and when you set it there it will maintain that temperature throughout the cooking cycle. Also,you don't have to add anything to the fire every 20 minutes. I am a firm believer in the gas grill because of its consistency and dependability. The only secret is to make sure you always have gas on hand. Running out gas halfway through the meal can be embarassing. There are gauges avialable to let you know the level of the gas in each tank you have (invest in one.) Another tip I have and this applies to gas or charcoal grills. Be watchful when using a basting sauce that contains sugar. Sugar will burn even at very low temperatures. My personal preference is cook the ribs with the just the rub until about the last 20 to 30 minutes. Then use the basting sauce for the last 20 to 30 minutes. Don't leave the ribs alone durning that last few minutes as sugar can burn in a minute. Bon Apetit!

A question: Has anyone made these using a gas grill? If so, is the cooking time different? Thanks!

My husband and I have been searching for an easy dry rub recipe for grilling - and we found it here! Although we have not used the basting sauce mentioned in the recipe, we have used the rub when grilling chicken quarters and baby-back ribs. The flavor of the rub is not too hot, nor too sweet. Best of all, it only requires five ingredients, all of which are staples in my pantry :o)

I didn't actually cook these myself, but I sure did eat them! Yum, and deliciously different from sticky-sweet barbecue ribs. My friend said they were a cinch to make - I hope next time she makes double as they were gone in a flash. Try them - you'll be hooked!
