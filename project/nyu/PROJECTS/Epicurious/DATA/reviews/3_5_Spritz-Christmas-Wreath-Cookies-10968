Ok,I can't in good conscience give a recipe which requires significant alterations 3 stars, although I am tempted. I wish I could give it two and a half stars. I do come back to this recipe over and over. It works fine, so long as you use only 3 cups of flour. Also - and I can't stress this enough - your butter must be at room temperature. Starting cold and just creaming it more will not get you that lovely, pressable consistency.

A great recipe. The amount of flour was slightly too heavy for the wreath disc in my cookie press, but perfect for the larger designs (tree, flower, candy cane, snowman). I added a bit of almond extract, too. The cookies are delicious and I did note the aftertaste that some other reviewers mentioned. I think it's the salt. I used kosher, and next time would cut the amount and use a finer grain like sea salt. Cooking time varied depending on type of pan in my convection oven. 9 minutes was perfect for one pan, and it was closer to 11 for another. Will definitely make again with the salt adjustment, maybe slightly less flour, and a touch more vanilla/almond.

I did not have trouble with this dough pushing through my press. It's a delicious recipe, very buttery!

I tried making this dough two times. Both times it resembled slightly yellowed flour stuck together with butter. I tried pressing it through my cookie press with absolutely no luck. I added milk and it gained a doughy consistency. I then tried to press it through - worked just fine, but it wouldn't stick to the tray. Too much frustration for a christmas cookie.

I, too, have found the dough to be quite stiff and unable to get through my cookie press. This time I added only 3 cups of flour, an extra tsp of vanilla, and 3Tbsp. of milk. Perfect!

The recipe absolutely did not work in my cookie press. It was too dry and too thick, and I ended up having to toss the dough. I would never make it again!

This is one of the best spritz cookie recipes I have ever made. I added a bit of almond extract as well and the cookies turned out light and melt in your mouth delicious.

I really can't understand the high forks rating on this recipe, it was downright terrible. Firstly, 3 3/4 cups flour is entirely too much flour. I used 3 cups and the dough was still too firm to push through a press. I had to add water to get it to come together. It also didn't taste particularly good. The cookies are pretty bland and taste mostly of flour. I'll keep looking for a recipe like mom's, but this definitely was not it.

This was the best spritz cookie I've made. Because of the other comments about the amount of flour, I stopped at 3 cups and found that it was just about right. The dough was a little sticky but it feed through the cookie press just fine. I also added a teaspoon of almond extract in addition to the teaspoon of vanilla and the flavor was excellent!

Very buttery but more flavor than some other spritz recipes I've tried. Came out of the press easier after sitting for a while. More shortbread-like than most spritz.

I agree that this recipe is much easier to press through the cookie press. I definately will make it again and will keep to recommend to others.

Tried this recipe instead of my old standby. I think I have a new standby. The dough 'spritzes' easier than my usual and I like the flavor better too. Decorated with tiny candy cane sprinkles from Williams Sonoma, a very pretty addition to my cookie trays.

This was my first time making spritz cookies. The recipe is perfect just as is. They turned out wonderful. Just like the ones I had growing up in Germany.

I doubt I'd make this again as there are many other Spritz recipes that are far better. It's not too bad, but WAY too much flour!! And I cut it down to 3 1/4 cups. Maybe 3 or as the other reviewer said, 2.5 cups. It probably could be a good recipe with less flour. Also add double the vanilla - that really enhances the buttery taste.

This was a good Spritz cookie. I followed the advice below and reduced the amount of flour and ended up with cookies too sticky to release from the press - stuck it back in the mixer with the remaining flour and it was just right. I recommend using the recipe as-is. I also divided the dough in half and to one half added green food coloring and a good dash of peppermint extract - YUMMY!

I followed the advice of others and used only 2.5 cups of flour. I didn't have any candied cherries, so I just made them straight. Yum! Buttery and delicious. My toddler and I ate them up!

I doubled the recipe and used only 6 cups of flour. They turned out delicious! Obviously the recipe needs to have the flour cut back.

I hadn't made Xmas cookies in years and these used to be my favorite. But when I made them, the dough was dry, stiff and crumbly. QUESTION: when making cookies do you "sift" the flour??? Besides reading the "reviews" first, is that what I should have done?? What a disaster!

I think these cookies are just little wreaths of love.They are so buttery and full of flavor. I would definitely make them again for friends and family. The people i love.

Even 3 cups is too much flour, I ended up on the phone with my Swedish uncle asking him why my dough was so crumbly. He told me to add butter. (So I ended up with 4 sticks butter to 3 cups flour, do the ratio for less flour, less butter). Also, he passed on the trick to making the dough stick to the cookie sheet: freeze the cookie sheet first!! it works like magic!

Made spritz cookies for the first time ever - turned out great! Added only three cups of flour, as per suggestions. Would perhaps add more vanilla or some almond extract, for more pronounced flavor. Fun to make with my little ones!

The flavor of these cookies was wonderful. However, I followed the recipe exactly and found the dough too stiff to put through the cookie press and ended up rolling it like sugar cookies. The kids ended up liking that better; we used a snowman cutter and used the candied cherries as buttons. A hit!

Fantastic! I took the advice of the cook from Washington and used less flour.

This makes a delicious, delicate cookie. Even given my temperamental cookie press which refused to squeeze out uniform cookies, the final product looked very nice in my gift boxes.

If you use 3 3/4 cups of flour, this dough will be too stiff to go through the cookie press. I recommend 3 cups maximum.

Very great! Tasty and good! Great for Christmas cookies, and and other holidays, and I WILL do this one again!
