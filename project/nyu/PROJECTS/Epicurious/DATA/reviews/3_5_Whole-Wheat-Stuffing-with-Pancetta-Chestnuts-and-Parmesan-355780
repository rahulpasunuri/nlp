Moist dressing that everyone loved.

Agree - this had great flavor. We tried it in addition to our traditional stuffing, and everyone liked it. I also agree that it could use more liquid - but that would make it more bread pudding- like. I think if the uncovered baking time were reduced, it would help. Just remove the foil for the last 10 min to crisp the top. We all thought it would be a really nice side with beef and are planning to add it to the Christmas menus.

This stuffing had great flavor; the whole wheat bread really added a nice note. Unfortunately, we had to omit the chestnuts due to a guest with a nut allergy. I agree with the previous reviewer; it was too dry for my taste. We took her suggestion and added one extra egg and extra broth. The result was delicious! The recipe says that it serves 6-8. We were serving 9 and worried we wouldn't have enough so made a bit more. I think in the end the original recipe would have served 8 easily.

Overall, a good-tasting dish. I would definitely add more thyme than stated (use a couple teaspoons dried thyme, which has more intense flavor than fresh thyme). This recipe yields a stuffing on the drier end of the stuffing spectrum; as I prefer mine a little softer and moister, but still love a crusty top, next time I'd add 1-2 extra eggs and bake in a smaller but deeper baking dish. http://apricosa.blogspot.com
