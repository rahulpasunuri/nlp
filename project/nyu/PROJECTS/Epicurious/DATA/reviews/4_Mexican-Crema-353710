I make my crema with real mayo. I'm guessing that sour cream is more authentic. Does sour cream vs. mayo really make a difference? Any comments?

Just perfect with the fish tacos.

YUM! Previously I only used regular sour cream with Mexican food, but this is the real deal, and worth finding at the supermarket even if you don't spruce it up with lime. Brings the authenticity level way up.

This was an excellent addition to fish tacos and vegetarian burritos! Fresh and easy.

This is easy to make and so flavorful - I served this with the Baja Fish Tacos, as well as grilled chicken and Pibil-Style Pork for a large crowd. My guests put this on everything - they loved it - glad I made extra.
