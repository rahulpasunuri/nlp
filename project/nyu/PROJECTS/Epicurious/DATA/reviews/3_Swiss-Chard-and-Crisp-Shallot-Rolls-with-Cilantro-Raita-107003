I subbed chives in the raita, and it was delicious. I also used sauteed chard stems and oyster mushrooms in the stuffing to "fill it out" a bit more. Swiss chard just BEGS to be stuffed! It was great! Will make again!

The sweetness of the fried shallots balanced well with the bitterness of the swiss chard. A great variation on swiss chard, if you happen to find yourself with a lot

I took the spirit of this recipe, and mixed it with the spirit of other chard recipes on the site-- stuffed them with quinoa (nice texture, good protein), the chard stems (sauteed in olive oil), goat cheese, raisins (soaked), toasted pecans and s/p). As such they made a good light entree. An easy version of stuffed grape leaves, esp if you have an abundance of swiss chard in the garden

Made this for Mom on mothers day, she loved it , said it the raita was wonderful.. the combination of flavors was excellent, like a very good Restaurant memorable. If you make it as you prepare the rest of the dishes it is not that time consuming, because is is easy.

Like the United States, England has its share of unappealing dishes and poor cooks. However, the country has outgrown its reputation for stodgy, bland food especially now that London has so many excellent restaurants. I realize that I am being a hypocrite in a message that begins this way, but it would be wonderful if readers could reserve negative comments for recipes that really did not prove successful. Please be polite and kind to one another.

Actually, I haven't tried it yet but wanted to tell the person who was concerned about cilantro- try flat-leafed Italian parsley, or if you want more flavor, any variety of fresh basil leaves.

We found this recipe very time-consuming. The swiss chard leaves did not roll easily (perhaps they were overcooked- I would cook less and cool more quickly next time). The raita, however, was WONDERFUL, easy, and we will dfinitely make it again.

This is the type of recipe I would want to serve; however, I have some friends who hate cilantro. What can I use instead? I want to make this for a dinner in October, so I need options soon.

This was an excellent recipie. It's too bad the cook from England decided to pass judgement before even trying it. Of course, England is such a culinary wonderland.

Great appetizer. Anyone who likes stuffed grape leaves should give this a try. (and i'm sorry about the comments from London too; my opinion of that review is much similar to his/her opinion of the recipe :-p)

Not unlike the Greek appetizer, this is very tasty and easy to make. It makes a nice presentation and everyone loved it. I'm sorry about the comments from London. Too bad he didn't try it first! Be creative with the spices you use. This raita can accomodate to any of your faves.

Actually, unlike previous review, I like this recipe. I add a bit of cumin to the shallots as they are cooling.

is anyone actually going to make this? it has to be one of the stupidest most frivolous recipies i have ever seen on this service. please, save the swiss chard for a more noble cause.
