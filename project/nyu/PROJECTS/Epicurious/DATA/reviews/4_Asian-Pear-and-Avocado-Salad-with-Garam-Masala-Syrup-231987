The syrup took considerably longer to reduce than the recipe suggests. I made the night before we wanted the salad. I'm glad I did. It took about an hour for the liquid to reduce. I then let it steep for another hour. It was flavorful without being overly spicy. I would reduce the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup if I make this again. The sweetness of the syrup was well matched with the bright crispness of the pears and the earthy crunch of the pumpkin seeds. Though we thought this was good, I wouldn't consider it a main dish. When you get down to it, there's not much here. It's tasty, but a bit of work for the results.

The dressing for this salad sounded more like a syrup, but it was quite successful and quite a hit at the dinner party.

Fantastic mix of flavours, and easy to make - great for entertaining. Has become a firm favourite at our house.

This salad is AMAZING! Even picky eaters would like it. It's a sweet salad, but not too sweet. And the syrup is incredibly fragrant! My husband (who is a steak and potatoes sort of guy - not too into interesting flavors) actually said, "I want everything I eat to have this sauce on it!"

Sweet, Spicy and Superb! I followed the recipe almost to the T but used Black Cardamom since that is all I had on hand. I don't really know what else to say but please do not hesitate to make this recipe folks, it may very well be the best salad you have ever had :)

Very good. Its not often that one encounters a salad without vinegar or oil in the dressing and walks away impressed. Specific comments: a.) Make your own garam masala. The dressing is a key flavor component, and the premade mix has long lost its luster b.) I would suggest substituting pinenuts for the pumpkin seeds. c.) The use of microgreens and Asian pears provides for a nice presentation, but one could easily cut these costs for a weeknight meal. Baby greens (or even simply "greens") would suffice, and while the Asian pears provide a unique flavor, Bosc would be fine for a fraction of the price.

This was great - I took a shortcut and used pre-made garam masala mixed into a simple syrup. Great flavors, and easy. Calling it a salad is cheating though - you could almost serve it as a desert over ice cream.

Friends served to us and it was wonderful. Very refreshing and different in a good way. I look forward to making it myself.

A friend of mine called it SPA salad. I used regular pears instead of Asian Pears, and the Graam Masala Syrup took a LONG time to cook down. I also did it as a tossed salad. EVERYONE LOVED it. I've made it twice now and will do it again and again.

Admittedly, I simplified it: used pre-roasted pumpkin seeds, premix garam (good brand though) and used Serrano pepper sauce instead of red pepper flakes. I also substituted lime for lemon and used romaine. It was wonderful.

play with the red pepper flake thing. garam masala is a very flexible thing.in India every villiage has its own recipe for this. you can 'americanize' or 'mexicanize' or 'arabize' or 'indianize' this dish by playing with the red pepper, mostly. this author knows her stuff, and has a really good recipe for it. this is a really good and grand introduction to garam if someone needs it. beautiful, really. garam is an essential foundation. to say that sushi is a set of variations on the taste of wasabi is true. to say that cajun coooking is a set of variations on salt and rue and sassafras is true. to say that a key to India cooking may be a set of variations on garam is true, also. in the south of India, they add more fennogreek. in the north, they add more raw cardamom. they 'play' with it. one must ask himself, 'am i confident enough to play with this?' whenever doing the recipes at epic. i still believe that no one should review a recipe here until they have done it as written first. there are so many BS reviews here, which was the intention of my humor here. epic is a variation on cooking without humor. let us call it 'dry', or 'controlled'. the monitors will never let me(after being censored by the snoots) say wonderful things about this recipe and more....

by the by, i think this recipe is what epic is truly about. or should be. something different for those of us who are truly in the kitchen an who need to prepare a meal in the 'now'. epic does a great job of this. i want to let you know that epic is still almost the best place to do your recipe search. they just won't let you add humor and such to the reviews. not too much, at least, which is what i did. um... ok. i did this recipe fully as the author said. it was wonderful. later, as a competent cook, i changed a few things to my liking. so sue me. i liked mine better. but that is the way things are here at epic, right? you have rights to everything, here. except a sense of humor. get rid of that spice if you have it in your rack.

yes, this recipe is fabulous! but, i changed it a good deal. i think epic reviewers ought to say this up front. they seldom do. anyways, this is my goodbye to epicurious. oh, yeh! do this recipe, for yourself and for your friends. it's good, and good for you. but you will never see me again. i have had so much trouble with epic about my reviews. i won't say much about them. they were funny. people laughed. most folks laughed. a few snooty and powerful folks didn't laugh. the snoots won. i will be gone after this post. just to let you know, the snoots run this website. it's good, and i enjoyed it. but i'm moving on to the recipes for engineers website. they like my recipes and like my humor. they laugh when it feels like laughing. they get serious about cooking when they are hungry. i like that about them. at epic, they laugh almost never. there are 'monitors' that check. they get serious about cooking when they want to impress someone. bye.
