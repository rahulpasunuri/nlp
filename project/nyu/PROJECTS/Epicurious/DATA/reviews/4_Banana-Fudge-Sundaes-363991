Easy and delicious. I was surprised at the banana flavor from just fruit (no liquer or extract). I didn't have half and half so I used 2/3 two percent milk + 1/3 heavy cream. Next time I will chill the mixture before I put it in the ice cream maker. With room temperature bananas and canned milk the mixture takes awhile to chill enough to start "setting up" in the i.c. maker. Or, I may just use frozen bananas since i always have those in my freezer. Anyway, this is a keeper.

Excellent and easy ice cream recipe. Pureed all ingredients in my vitamix and added a pinch of fresh ground nutmeg. Did not make chocolate sauce.. wasn't needed!
