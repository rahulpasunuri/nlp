I only make the Streusel pie when plums are in season but we love the lemon-lime ice milk all year. It's not too heavy and has such a bright fresh taste from the juices. I am always searching for dessert recipes that are not cloyingly sweet and both the ice milk and the plum pie are great

This is a wonderful pie! Great flavor combination with the sweet-tart ice milk.
