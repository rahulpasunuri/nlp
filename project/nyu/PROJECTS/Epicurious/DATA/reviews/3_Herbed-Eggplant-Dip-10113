I followed this to a "T", however I did puree half of it to smooth out the consistancy. Everyone LOVED it!! I loved it, I will make it again and add galic too!! I served it with garlic pita chips & veggies.

This came out pretty tasty, made a few changes to work with what I had. Used garlic oil, because I love it and followed another reviewers suggestion of cooking it all together with the red pepper. Added herbs, salt and lemon juice last. Had it with bagel crisps, nice little snack for the family.

This was a very delicious dip...however I made a few changes. I added 1 roasted red pepper, chopped to the onion and eggplant while they were cooking. I also threw the chopped tomatoes into the eggplant while cooking. After mixing everything together I pureed the mixture. The roasted red pepper gave it great color and flavor. I suggest serving it with toasted pita chips brushed with olive oil and salt and pepper.

I added the garlic as the last review suggested and it was delicious. I didn't dice the eggplant and tomato as smal as suggested so it became more of a salad, than a dip. The flavor is very satisfying. I will make this again. I'm so happy to find a good eggplant recipe.

This was ok. did not look very appealling, but it tasted good. I think the appearance through people off at my christmas party, it was barely touched.

I really liked this recipe. It is very easy to make, looks good, and has great flavor. I found that it tasted better the second and third day. Next time I will make it a couple of days before the event and let the flavors develop a little better.

I added a few ingredients to this recipe: 1 diced grn. bell pepper; 2 fresh garlic cloves; I omitted the fresh tomatoes and added a can of tomato paste and sauted a while longer than the recipe suggested. I brought the dip to a party and it literally disappeared before I could get back for seconds.

yuck! what a disappointment after reading previous reviews. There are so many better eggplant dip recipes (baba ganouj, etc). I tried spicing up this bland recipe with more basil & roasted garlic. It was still quite boring.

Quick and impressive recipe. My husband is not the biggest fan of eggplant but he loved this as did our guests. Four of us ate almost all of it.

Simple to make and tasty. If you like eggplant, you'll love this. Now, going to warm it up and try the leftover dip with pasta.
