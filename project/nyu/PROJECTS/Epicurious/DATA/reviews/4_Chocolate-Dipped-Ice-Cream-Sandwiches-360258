not much to write home about and the cookie cracked when i tried to cut the final versions which made for only a few viable sandwiches. not worth the time.

These are awesome. A little temperamental to work with but the end result was a big hit.

These ice cream sandwiches are so delicious! I used dulce de leche ice cream, which tasted great with the brown-butter cookie. I had no trouble making the cookie - the soft, pliable dough was easy to work with. Perfect for summer entertaining!

I've made these twice now and everyone has loved them. I made a slight modification the second time around, which cut down the prep time. Instead of simply rolling the cookie dough into a rectangle and having to cut the cookies and the sandwiches, I pressed out the dough and used a measuring cup to cut round cookie shapes. I baked those, filled them with ice cream and froze and dipped per the instructions. I could not find good dulce de leche ice cream so used caramel toffee crunch instead.

My 5 year old loved these. We made our own ice cream as well. The cookie hame out a little to thick, though. Next time I'll roll the dough out.

These were the yummiest ice cream sandwiches. The cookie dough was really easy to make - two bowls and a wooden spoon. I filled the sandwiches with dulce delece gelato. My guests LOVED them - even my friend who never eats deserts.
