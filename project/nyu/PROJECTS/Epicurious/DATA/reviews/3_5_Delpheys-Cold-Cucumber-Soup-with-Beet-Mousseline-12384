Just wondering how you seed a seedless cucumber.

Did not love this. To me, the chicken broth overwhelmed the cucumber, and the whole thing was just bland as could be. Although I do like the beet mousseline just fine. But I have lots of cucumbers, so I may try again with a good vegetable broth.

Very, very fine soup and the beet mousseline makes it elegant and a treat for the eyes. Splurge and use whole fat sour cream -- the soup deserves it.

Light, refreshing and not too heavy like some soups with sour cream, cream. I would most likely skip the whipping of the cream for the beet Mousseline. After doing it, it did not seem necessary and. A great summer soup!

Exquisite color and taste combination. I live in France where they sell cooked fresh beets at the market. That saved a lot of time. I just put surgical gloves on and peeled them. The balsamic vinegar made the beet mousseline quite intense, and I thought the soup was not at all bland but a perfect compliment to the tanginess of the beet. That said, I did increase the amount of dill, lemon and seasonings to my taste. My guests were floored.

our family loves this soup! We add an extra diced cucumber just before chilling to give it extra texture. Yum!

Oh I forgot to say, I agree the sieve part is totally not necessary!

I skipped the cream in the beet mousseline, since the soup already has that sour cream in it. Pretty excellent I think.

My husband loved this soup, but next time I'll add more lemon. I mixed the lowfat sour cream with lowfat yogurt, which gave a little more tang to the soup. Also, I didn't bother to force the soup through a sieve. I sprinkled a little cayenne over the soup before adding the mousseline. Yum

I thought this was a fantastic soup, and I'm not a big fan of chilled soup OR cucumbers. I think it's that tasty. I didn't find it to be overly messy or time consuming to make, but I'm pretty efficient in the kitchen, so I'm sure it depends on your own work flow. Don't skip the beet accompaniment, I did the first time, but made it the second. The second time around was stellar, and I will always make the two in tandem from now on.

First of all, excellent soup. Second, to A Cook from Boston, this is a cooking website for people who enjoy cooking. If you're looking for something fast and easy that doesn't take a lot of fuss, try Rachel Ray. Like they say, if you can't take the heat (or the dishes), get out of the kitchen.

To: A Cook From Boston; That is what happens when you cook. I totally know what you mean, make the people who didn't cook do the cleaning :)

Don't get me wrong--this is a delicious soup. But it also took 2 days to make and dirtied up everything in my kitchen including a blender, food processor(for the beets) hand mixer, two stockpots, spoons, chef's knives, wire whips and bowls. If you love washing dishes this recipe is for you, but I won't be making it again, sorry.

This is one of my favorite summer soups -- I could eat the whole pot!!! It does take a little extra salt & pepper once it's cool, and in my opinion you can never have too much dill. :) Not bland at all!

This was wonderful and fresh! The lemon juice gives the cukes a bright flavor. I did make a few changes, though . . . I added two ribs of celery, and used water rather than chicken stock. I don't like using protein stocks in cold soups because I think it feels weird on the palate. Typically, I replace with fresh homemade veg stock but didn't have time on this occasion. If I did use a veg stock, I would make it with onion, leek, celery, fennel, garlic, bay leave, thyme, parsley. However, it was great just as I did it. I wonder if "A Cook" thought it was bland because he or she seasoned the soup when it was warm and didn't check seasoning again once chilled. Often soups need a little extra seasoning once cold. Perhaps the addition of a little more S/P or lemon or dill may have helped.

I thought this was very bland and the yield was not even close to 6 cups....ended up throwing it out .

What a great use of my garden's cucumbers. Canned beets were an easy substitute and made and excellent presentation. My partner, who likes cukes "a little at a time" LOVED this recipe and even told people at work how good it was. Hey - if I lived in Florida, the green and red would make for a fun Christmas starter! LOL!

This is an eligant and easy soup. The first time I made it with home made veal stock, the 2nd with home made chicken stock. The veal stock was much better. If I did not have veal stock, I'd use diluted beef broth.I use full fat sour cream.

Perfectly Divine! Five Star Restaurant taste and presentation!

This was excellent. Several asked for the recipe! I did add diced cucumber to the soup after straining it to give it a little crunch and extra cucumber flavor. I would do this again.

From reading the reviews I was a little hesitant to make this soup. I did not find this soup bland at all. Everyone absolutely enjoyed it. We found it very refreshing. The beet mousseline added just the right taste.

Easy to make, and looks beautiful when served. Friends asked for recipe. Canned beets worked well too. Tested four cucumber soup recipes and this won, hands down.

I didn't make it, but was served this at a dinner party. I thought it was delicious, but sometimes things taste better if you don't cook them yourself! With the beet mousseline, it was very pretty and was a great summer soup.

The Beet Mousseline was wonderful, but the soup was a little bland. Next time, I will probably combine the Beet Mousseline with another cucumber soup recipe.
