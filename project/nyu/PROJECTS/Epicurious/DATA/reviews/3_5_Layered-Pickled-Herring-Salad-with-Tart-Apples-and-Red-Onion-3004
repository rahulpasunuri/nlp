Made this for New Year's Day brunch buffet, and it turned out nicely. It's a little time-consuming, but I'll definitely make it again. There are a few things I'll change next time: I marinated the cucumbers for too long (about 20 hours) and they got soggy, so I'll give them just a few hours next time. Also, I'll use more herring as the fish got kind of lost in the salad. Last, I'll try cutting the apples into a different shape; I think larger, thinner pieces might work better with other ingredients.

We made this salad for fast break after yom kippur and everyone loved it. I used fresh marinated herring as I couldn´t find the one recommended in the supermarket in Brasil. It will be part of our six-week menu from now on!

Could't find spiced herring; substituted a splash of tabasco sauce. Five people cleaned the bowl Very, very good!

Who would have thought you could get excited over a herring dish! This is fabulous! My husband, who won't eat herring, had several helpings and my guests took the copies of the recipe home..What better recommendation!

I have been making this wonderful salad since 1996. My family always requests this twice during the holidays - Christmas Eve and New Years.

This is the same recipe that my German Grandmother Scimeca used to make for us at New Year. I love this!! Excellent!!
