Very good, but deceptive when they tell you it will take 45 minutes. Roasting peppers, boiling garlic to make the sauce, it all takes much more time and is a production. In the end, very good vegetarian dish. Vegan without cheese good too, just had to add a great deal of ground pepper.

a bit garlicky, will use only one head of garlic nexttime

When I saw all the garlic on my cutting board I got a little intimidated, but the result was very tasty and the garlic wasn't overwhelming. I forgot to add the balsamic, but I can see how it would be very good in this. We added red pepper flakes at the table and it really made a difference. I also think some Italian sausage would be good in this, or it would be good as a side to a hearty meat like steak. I'll definitely make this again but will add more thyme and possibly puree some of the peppers with the garlic. The only downside to this is the lengthy and involved preparation. From beginning to end it took a little over an hour of near non-stop cooking, so make it on a day when you feel like being in the kitchen for a while.

I cooked this recipe for friends last night, and everyone loved it. I made a few adjustments - more vinegar, wilted the spinach in the pasta cooking water, added dried thyme to the garlic puree (since I didn't have fresh), and added red pepper flakes and extra olive oil to the sauce. The roasting and peeling of the peppers was a bit messy, and I might just purchase roasted peppers next time. We really enjoyed the final result, and I will certainly make this recipe again.

This dish had a lot of garlic flavor and was rather messy to make. A lot of little steps before making the sauce.

If you like garlic, this is a delicious dish. Garlic is definitely present in all forms. The balsamic vinegar and fresh Parmagiano really made the difference.

We really liked this recipe and it can modified so easily. I replaced the spinach with a head of broccoli florets, reduced the amount of pasta to 200g so we got more veg and beans per portion ( 2 peop). I also garnished with feta, cracked pepper and a drizzle of good EVOO. I thought the result was a satisfying light dinner.

Very good. Added red pepper flakes during cooking. Didn't add the raw garlic at the end b/c I thought it was gralicky enough without it. Shoudl have used more beans -- the young girls at my table ate them all up! Next time I'll add toasted pine nuts. This would be excellent with grilled chicken.

The garlic taste is very strong, and delicious. It was fun to make and has a suprisingly good taste. Particularly surprising because the look of the dish is rather dull. Could do with some red!

We've made this several times and absolutely LOVE it - a little bit of work, but worth it. I cheat and use already roasted peppers - cuts down on a lot of the prep time. My husband is a meat and potatos kind of guy but he was very impressed with this and a salad for dinner.

This wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped. I roasted my own peppers (I always do...it is not that much work). Then I also roasted a bulb of garlic, sauteed three cloves, and then used what I had left in simmering veggie broth. I used extra spinach as suggested. I ended up adding a lot of crushed red pepper flakes as I ate to give it some flavor. Probably wouldn't make it again.

This turned out to be a lot of work and was extremely disappointing - starchy and tasteless.

Had a vegetarian friend coming over for dinner the other night and made this. What a hit! Everyone loved it and it was fairly easy to make (made the sauce and mixed the spinach/salt/thyme before hand, so all I had to do was reheat the sauce--with a little extra pasta water because it had thickened a little--cook the pasta and throw it all together once the company arrived).

I used vegtable broth inplace of the water to simmer the garlic .. i think this adds alot of extra flavor... also i eliminated the cheese to reduce the fat content and added more spinach since i think spinach really makes this recipe...

In general, I find that beans and pasta don't mix well, and this recipe confirmed it. Too pasty, too bland, even with the unexpected addition of balsamic. If I did make it again, I would omit the beans and add smoked sausage or grilled chicken instead. And saute the garlic for stronger flavour instead of simmering it.

The recipe sounded way too complex, so I just used the same ingredients (except peppers which I hate) because they sounded good together. I sauted a head of garlic slowly in butter til brown but not burnt, added the white beans, thyme, spinach, balsamic vinegar, some cherry tomatoes, mixed in the cooked pasta and parmesan. It would've been good except the beans tasted horribly fishy. I think with cannellini beans it would be much improved. Would not make it again otherwise, but am curious about different beans. The garlic was AWESOME. The garlic, spinach and tomatoes were all homegrown.

This was a tasy, filling meal in itself. I took the suggestion of another & added kielbasa. It was delicious. The kielbasa added a great smoky flavor. I would suggest even more spinach.

This recipe is SO convoluted and time consuming, it is definitely NOT worth it.

Tasty! Like another of the reviewers, I added turkey kielbasa...what a great-tasting, one dish supper! Also used jarred red peppers and saved out the garlic water... only other thing I would do differently is add more fresh thyme. Went right into my "A List" recipe book!

A little garlicky for my taste and I like garlic. Next time I would roast garlic. I used jarred red peppers because of time. The dish has a nice combination of ingredients. I served as a main dish, but it would also pair nicely with any roasted meat.

This is really good and garlic!Save the garlic liquid...all of it! Add a little boullion, vege or chicken to it to add back at the end for that sauciness that you are looking for :)

It seemed like the dish was missing something. I think I may make it as a side dish again but not as a main course.

Just okay recipe. My husband did not like at all. Not sure why. He reminded me, however, that I had not made one of his favorite dishes (sorry, not from this website). It is Martha Stewart's "Three Garlic Pasta." It can be retrieved by doing a recipe search on her site. It has roasted garlic, fried garlic and sauteed minced garlic in a sauce of olive oil, parsley, white wine and fresh parsley. Yum...

I roasted the peppers early in the day, and just left them in a brown paper bag until dinner. Then I rinsed them and chopped. I did use red ones, as the store had no organic orange (peppers are the second most hazardous veggie to purchase non-organic). I also did all the garlic early (thanks to the suggestion to mash with a fork! I did think the blender was overkill) Other than these two items, it was a very easy recipe. I used mini penne, as that's what I had in the house. Everyone, including kids, ate it up, and the leftovers were just as good. I'll definitely repeat, perhaps with the jarred peppers in a pinch. One last thing: I only made half the recipe, and ended up with a huge amount of pasta (fed our family of four, with leftover for another dinner!)

Too much effort for the result. Just an okay meal, kids didn't like it.

This was very good. I served it to a group of friends on Grammy night. Everyone liked it a lot. Instead of using all orange peppers ($$$) I used one each of orange, red, green, and yellow. It was very pretty and tated pretty good. My hubby liked it a lot the next day for lunch.

Per the suggestion of the other reviewers, I used jar roasted red peppers. It was delicious! Before trying it, my boyfriend admitted that he was a bit concerned if he was going to like it, but HE HAD THREE HELPINGS!

2.5 actually. This is good, not sure it is worth the effort. I had laughed at the three-ring circus comment, then took a look at my kitchen after dinner! It is all a matter of personal preference, but I like the ORECCHIETTE WITH BROCCOLI RABE AND FRIED CHICKPEAS much better. A tip, though, you can skip the blender to puree the cooked garlic and liquid, just mash the garlic thoroughly with a fork and whisk in the liquid. You may have some small pieces of garlic, but if you don't like garlic, surely you aren't making this recipe!

Sorry to all the vegetarians out there, but I added sliced Italian sausage to this, and it came out WONDERFULLY!

I detest the process of roasting and cleaning peppers but for this dish it was (almost) worth it. I think the next time I will buy prepared roasted peppers at my local Italian deli and save myself the trouble, and mess, of cooking them myself. By the way, this is a delicious and nourishing Lenten meal for those who eschew meat during the forty days and nights.

This got solid raves from the four people it served. It is a lot of prep, though, and I would try using jarred red peppers instead to save time. Very pleasing to the eye and a satisfying main course.

Why not reserve more of the garlic cooking liquid so that it could be used in the final product rather than the starchy pasta cooking liquid. The following is a comment re the overall format for printing your recipes. Is there not a way in which the copy could be prepared so that it could fit onto one sheet of paper. For instance, in this recipe, under ingredients, why not say 3 orange bell peppers, roasted and cut into 3/4-inch pieces instead of going into how they should be roasted. VA

I haven't made this either but I have a tip for roasted peppers. I roast them by the dozen in the fall when sweet red peppers are plentiful and affordable. Fire up the grill, char until blackend and toss into a brown paper bag to loosen the skins. Seed, peel and freeze individually on a cookie sheet. Toss into a zip top bag to be used at a later date. Tastes great every time!

I really liked this meal. After reading all the reviews, I decided to use mushrooms instead of peppers. It was quite delisious! Next time I make it I'll use a little less salt! The garlic doesn't need all that "enhancing"

Made it for my husband and kids everyone loved it. I added a little salt on pasta when tossing and agree that large bowl is needed.

This was good, but seemed to take way too much work, too many steps. I would definitely use jarred roasted peppers if I made it again -- just to cut down on the prep time. Also, my huge glass bowl was just barely lg enough to toss everything together. I'm hoping the leftovers are still good. I did love all the colors, tho'!

I have not made this recipe, but I thought about substituting chicken instead of using beans.

Here is the skinny on my experience with this recipe: Beautiful persentation, not too garlicky (considering all the garlic that it calls for), serves more than 8, and my kids liked it. But as with most low fat recipes, you have to really work hard to enhance the flavor. My kitchen looks like a three-ring circus! Next time I will use roasted peppers in a jar instead. Getting everything done was a lot of work! I used regular spinach (can't get the baby spinach in my town) and it did not wilt as much as I would have liked. If you try this recipe use a really, really big bowl to toss it.
