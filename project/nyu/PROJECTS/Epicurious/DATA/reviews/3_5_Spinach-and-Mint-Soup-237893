I'd give this barely one fork, this is the worst recipe ever from epicurious. Maybe it was the frozen spinach as others have said, maybe it was that I didn't use fresh mint. I used mint we grew in the herb garden, but it was dried as you use for tea...maybe that's why it's inedible...this soup was gross.

Like a watery spinach puree; perhaps it's better made with fresh spinach. If I made this again, I'd double the potato and halve the spinach, and maybe add some chopped jalapeno, as one reviewer suggested. I topped each serving with smoked paprika (no oil) and a blob of whole milk yogurt, which improved it some. There's a lot left over, so maybe I'll cook and puree another potato and see if that helps.

I have made a lot of Epicurious recipes, and I have to say, this is one of the best! I followed the instructions with the following exceptions: left out cilantro and potato (forgot to buy them at the store), used fresh chopped spinach instead of frozen as my last experience with frozen spinach in another recipe left me grimacing.

This soup is quite delicious; it reminds me of a portuguese bread soup with which I am veritably obsessed at a local restaurant here. However, when it says "season with salt and pepper," it means it. I admit I have a penchant for salt, but I would recommend going for the full sodium chicken broth and adding a healthy dose of kosher salt. Also, the bread soup I love so much has poached egg in it, and I suspect it would be equally delightful in this recipe.

Yum! We had this last night and everyone loved it. I made it with fresh spinach, a bit more mint, and an extra clove of garlic. This will become a summer staple.

really enjoyed this subtle soup. crack some pepper into it for a little more kick. i like the idea of using the greek yogurt though haven't tried it that way yet myself. the paprika oil makes it feel special.

A light, healthy soup. I used 1 tbsp oil, skipped the potato, and added 1/4 cup of sour greek yogurt in after turning off the heat. The herbs really shine through.

If one fork equals "O.K." than that's being generous. I followed the recipe exactly but doubled it to allow for 40 oz. of fresh spinach. Nothing could save this. With guest coming a 6 p.m. I made a mad dash to the grocery store for a quick substitute. P.S. The paprika oil was a sad waste of very good olive oil I'm afraid.

Just had a bowl. Loved it! Only change I made was that I used turmeric instead of the chili powder... The oil came out orange instead of red, but it tasted great...

I made it according to the recipe (except I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth), and it was a bit too subtle for my taste. Although you might want to add some paprika to the recipe, the oil on top looked a bit gross, especially against the green. It needed a little kick as well, so I added a few drops of habanero sauce and ground black pepper to my individual bowl of soup, and then it was just right. The addition of a jalapeno pepper is a good idea (from the other reviewer). Otherwise, habanero does the trick. Not bad, but not hugely memorable either.

I made this tonight using 1 bag of fresh baby spinach (all I had on hand) and 4 cups of sugar snap peas added with the potato and garlic. I loved it; my husband liked but didn't love it (I suspect it was the mint). I agree that the paprika oil is a must. It adds so much depth to the flavors and really makes the presentation special. To the calorie-conscious: you can always cut the oil used for cooking to 1 tbsp. and use a small potato, but DON'T SKIP THE PAPRIKA OIL! Also, don't use frozen spinach when fresh is available year round.

Great recipe, I used a little more mint and cilantro than called for, but the flavors really came through, I didn't have any problem with consistency at all, but since I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, that may be the difference.

Excellent. Needs bread. Very hearty.

This soup is fantastic. I use a touch of jalepeno in addition to the onion to give it more zest. I also add a bit more mint than it calls for as I really like the interesting addition mint gives to the spinach

This soup has a really interesting flavor and has impressed every guest I have served it to. The spinach and mint do blend into a combination all their own, but that is not a bad thing. In my opinion, the paprika oil is a must. It makes the soup. Last time I made it, I was out of paprika but had smoked paprika. I used it instead and it was just as fantastic, maybe even better. I know it sounds a little cheesy, but I served this for a christmas dinner and the red and green were beautiful.

I will say that the color was great but once I had thinned the soup to a consistency I liked and seasoned it, I could no longer taste any spinach flavor. In fact, my husband said "this is good, what is it?" The next day I added more spinach and mint. It was too thick but it was better. I wouldn't make it again.

I love this soup & make it often. I've always skipped the oil in all my soups including this one and I don't think you'll notice the difference.
