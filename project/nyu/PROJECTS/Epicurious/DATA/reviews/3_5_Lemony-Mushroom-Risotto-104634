Tasted wonderful! I added a little sage though. But everyone loved it.

Even though I forgot to add the lemon zest it was delicious. I served it with an Italian Porcetta roast and a salad. The meal received rave reviews.

This wasn't bad. The texture was perfect, but I found that the lemon zest gave the dish an overly strong citrus aftertaste. Next time I will stick with a more traditional mushroom risotto.

Wonderful!! So creamy and delicious - I loved this. I skipped the dried porcini and subbed shiitake along with the cremini mushrooms. We ate this as our main with a light soup beforehand. This was fun to make (not so time-consuming as it sounds) and a definite keeper!

I made this recipe for my family on new years eve and it was a huge hit. It was a little labor intensive but it was worth every second.

I have had this one saved in my box for some time now and just today decided it would go nicely with the pork tenderloin I intended to grill. The flavor was wonderful. I upped the mushroomness by substituting Pacific Natural Foods Organic Mushroom Broth for the chicken broth and used a combination of Porcini and Shitake mushrooms. Got rave reviews from the family including my "chef in training" son who is my toughest critic ;-).

Wow and wow - really exceptional. Omitted the white wine and use the equivalent amt of chicken broth. Surprisingly, the parsley made a difference; clean taste against the richness of the dish. Served with "roasted cod served on large garlic croutons" (subbed halibut) found on this site, and simple steamed asparagus. Lovely!

YUM! Used veggie broth instead of chicken.

This was a very tasty risotto. I served it with a broiled sea trout and asparagus, and it was perfect. I normally hate it when people offer their ideas on replacing ingredients, but it's a risotto--it's meant to be flexible. I made it without the cheese, and with shiitakes. It was great.

Very tasty indeed - the lemon (as in a mushroom soup from Robert Carrier I make regularly) really brings out the mushroominess and the combination of flavours is excellent. I made it as a side dish to go with leftover roast chicken with which it went perfectly. Like other reviewers, I didn't have the exact mushrooms called for so used dried chanterelles in place of the porcini and field mushrooms instead of the crimini. the combination worked just fine - looking forward to trying out different mushroom combinations though!

I did not have porcini mushrooms so I mostly left that step out. Might have missed something. But I had cremini on hand and they were so delicious in the recipe... the lemon was perfect!! I knew not to add all the broth at one time to save time, but someone else may not. It will be like lumpy glue if you add it all at once. It's a little messy to make I thought, time consuming as you have to stir quite a bit while the liquid absorbs. The dish was actually better left over the next day for lunch!!!

The quantities were just right. I served this with an Epicurious recipe for lemon pesto red snapper baked in foil, and they went together perfectly. I used dried chanterelles instead of porcini, and vegetable stock instead of chicken, and it turned out fine.

I served this recipe as a side with veal piccata. It was the perfect complement with just a hint of lemon to bring the dishes together. My guest all loved it and asked for the recipe. I would definitely make this again!

I really liked this recipe, and will definitely be making it again. I used regular mushrooms and dried portabellas instead of the creminis and the porcinis, just because that was what I had in my fridge. I found the lemon to be a nice addition without overpowering the dish. The parsley contributed just the right note and the recipe is much less work than you would think.

As vegetarians and good food lovers, we liked this version of risotto. I added lemon zest plus a small amount of lemon juice and it didn't overpower the mushrooms at all. I served this with a roasted tomato and green bean salad from this site which was a fabulous combo. Nothing left of either dish offered.

I have made this dish many times and it always receives raves. To make the dish more elegant for special occasions, I add a pound of raw jumbo shrimp right near the end, stirring until they are cooked through. Fantastic!

The risotto part was fine but the lemon ruined it. It added a weird rancid taste. Though its wasn't inedible (my boyfriend ate 2-3 plates of it) the lemon was so out of place in the dish that all I could think of was lemon, and I add such a tiny amount. I had assumed the lemon would enhance the mushroom flavor but it just detracted from it.

This was truly one of the best risotto dishes I've ever had. It was really creamy and delicious! I probably could have gotten away with following the recipe exactly as is, but I decided to add another 4oz. of mushrooms to really taste the mushroom flavor. I am using the remaing 1/2 cup of broth that I have left for when I reheat the leftover risotto.

This was restaurant quality risotto. It took a bit of time, but was so fabulous!

This is a great recipe.....the zest, versus using lemon juice ensures that lemon does not dominate the flavors. It is absolutely "mushroomy" since you use the two different mushrooms, as well as the juice that results from hydrating the porcinis. I even doubled the zest (2 tsp, instead of 1) and it still did not overpower the dish, just added a subtlety to complement the mushrooms. Well worth the effort and it's so easy.

This dish was great. I used shittake mushrooms and regular white mushrooms instead and the flavour still turned out very nicely. Would definitely make again.

This recipe is the reason I now keep a stock of dried porcinis in my pantry. I love this recipe, and make it as often as I can convince my husband to eat it. I don't find that the lemon overpowers the mushrooms; it's just one more robust flavor that stands up to the porcinis, the Parmigiano, etc. It requires some attention, but isn't really all that labor-intensive. This one goes in the permanent collection of "comfort food."

This was another great variation of risotto. Will make it again!

I was amazed that the lemon did NOT overpower this dish. The whole time I was cooking I thought the lemon would be too strong. In the end, it was perfect! I served it with pan-roasted pork chops. Great combination.

You have to love the taste of lemon in rice to love this dish. It overpowers even the robust porcini flavor. The mushrooms give the dish some substance but otherwise is almost undetectable. The receipe is otherwise fine and we rated this "2 spoons" only because we found it to be a one note dish and thus unenjoyable...

This is the perfect recipe when you want something hearty but but not fatty. I think the proportions are just right, just the right amount of lemon to lift any heaviness that the mushrooms might add. I highly suggest using creminis. They add much more flavor than button mushrooms.

Rating: 4
We really enjoyed this recipe. Fairly quick and easy to make. I used regular button mushrooms instead of wild mushrooms, and just before serving I stirred in a 1/2 tablespoon of lemon juice. However, the instructions about stock and water are misleading. Couldn't tell whether to combine these two before adding to the rizotto, so I added about 3/4 of the water to the stock, and then added it 1/2 cup at a time. Definately would make again.

Alot of work but unusual and delicious.

Risottos are a lot of work, but this is a wonderful tasting recipe. I loved the combination of the lemon and mushrooms. We ate this as our main course with a salad and a good rustic bread.
