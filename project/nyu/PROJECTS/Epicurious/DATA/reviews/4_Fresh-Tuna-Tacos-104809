These are wonderful. Served with cabbage, salsa, and also made a rub of ancho chile powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper. Rubbed in with evoo. Yum. Side dish of black bean, corn and jicama salad was perfect.

We loved it! Easy to make and great flavor. We made a sauce with mayo, orange juice, and chipolte peppers that we drizzles on the fish. Will definitely make again.

These tacos were amazing. A few notes: Instead of taco seasoning I used some cumin, garlic powder, and chili powder and instead of boring old sour cream I used crema. I also served some fresh jalapeno with them and served them on homemade tortillas. (If you've never made tortillas you should start they're easy and way better than anything you can buy at the store.) I'm already looking forward to the next time I make these.

Everyone loved this. The other reviewers are right, you need to double the recipe in order to feed four people. I used tillapia instead of tuna, and I made my own taco seasoning. Watch out for the chipotle chiles -- they can permanently stain your cutting board. Loved the dish, though -- am making it again tonight.

Delicious, but you really need more than 8 oz. of tuna! I used small whole wheat tortillas instead of hard shells, and they tasted great.

Rating: 4
Easy and really delicious. Just be mindful of the serving size. The recipe says that it serves 4 but as far as I'm concerned it serves 2, 2 tacos each.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! I used frozen fish, so I didn't precut it, instead cook until flakey, brake apart, season and finish cooking until done. I seasoned the fish myself rather than use taco seasoning. I used olive oil instead of vegetable. I don't see how this recipe yields 4 servings. I tripled the sour cream, red onion and chilies and used 4-8oz ahi tuna steaks and served 7 with no leftovers (we are all active-built). I served on corn tostadas (taco shells are so annoying!) with lettuce, avocado, mango-lime salsa and more sour cream! Everyone loved it.

I used tilapia, because that is what I had on hand. I am sure this would work with any fish you chose. It is SO easy and incredibly tasty. I might try it with low fat sour cream and/or with less sour cream in the pan and maybe some lowfat yogurt at the end once it is out of the pan.

LOVED it! Even my picky fiance said this one was a keeper. I substituted mahi mahi for tuna because it was fresher at the store - I think any fresh fish would be delicious in this recipe.

These were easy and oh so good! I added shredded green cabbage, some guacamole, and some store bough mango and papaya salsa and I used organic flour tortillas. Amazing! They were also great for left overs cold the next day!

I agree with the last reviewer - the best quick recipe ever! Double it - it's not enough to feed 4 (only 2, really). We used pan heated flour tortillas. I can't believe a recipe in Bon Appetit would recommend those shells. I served these with the Black Bean, Corn and Tomato salad (with all the adjustments) on the site. This is a fantastic and healthy dinner. HIghly recommended!

this may be the best 10-minute recipe i have ever made, and it can compete with ones that take ten times as long! change nothing, except saving some sour cream to top with, as a previous reviewer suggested.

Rating: 3
Both my husband and I really liked this dish, which is amazing because my husband doesn't even like fish that much. I tripled the sour cream mixture(PS-- I added some extra chipotle powder and 2 small small cloves of garlic to the sour cream--A must!) When putting the sauce with the fish reserve about 1/3 cup of the sour cream mixture and keep cold in your fridge, use this instead of regular sour cream on the tacos, you will love it, it really makes the meal.

I forgot the avocados and black olives, so we added copy-cat "Chipotle" rice (for which we had the cilantro and lime). Based on reviews, we also bought soft tacos which were better than crunchy.

This was quick and easy and yummy- but spicy- maybe I used more than a teaspoon on the chipotle! I used cubed swordfish and served with extra sour cream, shredded lettuce and halved cherry tomatoes to cut the heat.

This dish is delicious. I added extra chipotle peppers for more kick. Also, much better in flour tortillas...strongly recommend them over hard shell. My husband can be hard to please and he LOVED IT!

I make this dish all of the time. My family prefers it with salmon instead of tuna. Tonight I used tilapia....all I could find fresh...it too was great though the fish didn't stand up to the sause as well as the tuna and salmon. The tilapia was a little more what one thinks of when they think of traditional fish tacos.

This is a fabulous, easy recipe that we absolutely loved! I doubled the chipotle and used fresh corn tortillas instead. I will definitely make this one again.

Great recipe for fish tacos. I make mexican dishes A LOT and this is one of the better ones. Consider a little cayenne with the sauce or maybe some low-vinegar hot sauce like Franks or Cholula if you like it spicier. Don't overcook the tuna, easy to do. Goes great with the Black Bean, Jicama, and Grilled Corn Salad.

The sauce is what makes this dish so good! This was quick and easy. I made no changes to the recipe- which is pretty rare for me. Terrific, as is!

This is just OK. If you do not eat a lot of dishes made cilantro and/or chipotles and topped with avocado, this may be a good one for you to try, as these are delicious ingredients. However, we eat various types of tacos at least twice a week in my house, and we were disappointed with this particular recipe. The tuna didn't carry the flavor very well. Perhaps I will try the sour cream sauce with something else.

This dish makes you want to lick your plate! We used extra chipolte to add more kick. Baked chiken also works just as well. A great meal to surprise even the "experts" of mexican cuisine.

This was a great use of tuna pieces (i.e. the left overs after you clean and trim the whole fish). Didn't have chipoltes so I used pickled jalapenos and subbed sweet onion for red. Sear the tuna but don't add the sour cream mixture to the cooked tuna; top the tacos w/ the mix. The contrast of the cool crunchy sour cream mix w/ the warm seasoned tuna is heaven. Heat fresh corn tortillas over open flame, fill w/ fixings and you have one great taco.

Great and easy recipe. I made this for friends using flour tortillas and traditional toppings (tomato, lettuce, shredded jack cheese) so everyone could make his own. We all loved them. Served with lots of sangria and grilled veggies. Great summer evening on the deck!

My husband loves fish tacos but there aren't many places in Chicago that make them. I'm so happy to finally find a great fish taco recipe that is quick and easy. This is easily makes our top 10 recipe list. As other readers suggested, I also used Trader Joe's frozen Ahi tuna, added more than double of the chipotle - it definitely gives it some good kick. Love this recipe!!!

Delicious! What a simple recipe! The flavoring on the tuna is a wonderful contrast to the avocado. definitely only cook the tuna for a minute on each side. it was PERFECT. I can't wait to make this again!

This recipe was wonderful~ I doubled the chipotles as suggested and it was nice and spicy, very flavorful. My husband was hiccuping but wanted seconds and thirds of this! Only thing I added was some salt and pepper, otherwise as written. Also used the frozen Ahi fillets. Will be making it again soon!

Served this buffet style. For those who opted not for the sour cream mixture, I also served a mango - avocado salsa with this. This dish was so incredibly easy to make I'd do it again in a heart beat!

I used the frozen ahi tuna steaks you can buy at Trader Joe's (if you have Trader Joe's). This was super easy and fast. I used just about double the chipotle it called for because my husband and I like spicy food. I also topped the taco's with a little Jalapeno white sauce. Even my non-fish eating children loved it! I will make this again and again.

My girlfriend and I made this when I had a hankering for fish tacos; the sauce is delicious, in a snack-food/taco bell kind of way. We also use flour tortillas (prefer them), and make a little guacamole to add. Double the ingredients, and this is a great and fun recipe for a casual dinner party (have the guests assemble their own tacos, to taste).

Rating: 3
This came out wonderful. However, I agree with the reviewer who said packaged taco seasoning is a waste with fresh tuna. It takes about 30 seconds to make your own taco seasoning (there are plenty of recipes on the web) and use that.

These were quick and easy, not to mention very tasty. I used twice as much tuna. I don't know maybe we're big eaters. The cabbage was another great idea.

Yum yum! I'd recommend doubling the amount of chipotle peppers. Also, I used napa shredded cabbage (as opposed to lettuce) as a garnish for a little more cripness and a little more flair. Will definitely make again!

I have made this several times - though I must admit to changing it a bit. The sauce is PERFECT - don't change a thing. I skip the taco seasoning and just grill the tuna w/ salt & pepper, cut it up and put the sauce on it. Also, we use flour tortillas (just prefer them) and Muenster cheese is a really nice topping.

I make these tacos at least twice a month -- they're so easy to make and always come out super tasty. I prefer soft tortillas over hard shells, and I use New Mexican chipotle chili powder instead of the canned chipotles (I find it gives a richer flavor and is easy to store away). Also goes really well with spicy jack cheese and mango salsa. Yum!

This was a great dish - full of flavor - easy to make - fun to eat. I did go easy on the chiles, but next time will add a little more for heat.

I made this while my mom was visiting at Christmas. I lightened up on the chipotles and cilantro for her benefit. We all thought it was terrific, but next time I will make it 'full strength' for my husband and myself. We all agreed this was better than any chicken tacos we've attempted. I used yellowfin, since that is what my store usually carries. As tuna is such a healthy alternative to and perfect substitute for meat, I don't feel that this treatment is a 'waste' of tuna, unless you are paying premium prices. I would try the sauce with chicken, too.

I made this recipe using Albacore instead of Ahi (the Ahi's just too expensive in the off-season), and my wife & I both thought it turned out quite well, so I'm a little surprised at the negative reviews here. I also used flour tortillas rather than taco shells (which are just too messy, in my opinion).

I agree with Cook from New York -- a waste of fresh tuna. Way too weird putting packaged taco seasoning mix on fresh fish -- it took all the beauty of fresh fish away. Make the swordfish taco receipe on Epicurious instead. That's a keeper!

I was really disappointed in this, after all the great reviews. My boyfriend LOVES Mexican food, and said this is the only thing I've ever made that he found disappointing. The sauce was quite good, but it was a total waste of a good tuna steak. I could see doing this sauce over chicken, but I'd never make it this way again. I love fish tacos, but not these fish tacos.

Rating: 4
This is such a great twist on fish tacos. Fish haters love this recipe. My husband brings home 50-100 pounds two to three times per year and I have to get creative with how to cook up that much albacore. This recipe has been a lifesaver. I am amazed that my children 9 and 10 years old love these tacos! I made 15 pounds of this taco meat and then froze it in smaller containers. It has been great just to pull out a frozen container of this wonderful meat and warm it in the microwave and whala the family is singing the praises of my meal!! Thank you for this one!!! A couple of tips on this recipe as I have made it about 5 times now - 1) you can precook the meat in boiling water with a 1/2 cup of apple juice to get rid of the fishy smell and then flake the meat and add it to your oil and taco seasoning which makes the meat cook very quickly. 2) When adding the Chipoltle Chiles taste as you go - as they add lots of heat - and it's easy to overdo. 3) Cilantro - stems have lots of flavor so don't discard - cut them into small pieces and add to your mixture.

I served them as soft tacos with a large fruit salad ....

Delicious! I left out the cilantro (personal preference) but the tuna was SO GOOD and the chipotle in adobo is some great stuff. I served the tuna in soft flour tortilla with tomatoes and guacamole.

Simply excellent! Served with the basics for a large group of us who were away for the weekend. I multiplied the recipe by 4 for four big guys and 4 small women. There was nothing left. If the chipotles are too hot remove the seeds. Chipotles are just smoked jalapenos.

This is to DIE for! Definitely does not make enough, though. I bought a 3/4 pound steak, which was just enough for my husband and myself, with beans and rice on the side! In my opinion, corn tortillas are the only way to go with fish tacos. SO YUMMY!!!

This was great and easy, too. I made it once with Habaneros and once with chipotle chilis. Chipotles in adobo sauce adds a lot more flavor to the dish. Both times I happily doubled the spice in the sauce. I used soft corn tortillas. The tacos work best as a main course along with additional sides. Garlic Mashed Potatoes (found on Epicurious) and cooked vegetables made it more of a real meal.

I marinated the tuna in the taco seasoning with lime juice, then tossed it on the grill--wonderful!

What a great and easy dish.

The sauce is fabulous, but I changed it a bit. Never have packaged taco seasoning in pantry. Used some "fajita seasoning" (the kind in a spice jar),cumin, and some of Emeril's essence. We had swordfish instead of tuna. Outrageous! Family loved it. Served a mango salsa on the side.

Rating: 3
This was very, very good, if a bit messy. I recommend buying the largest taco shells available to allow room for toppings (I used cheese, olives, tomatoes, and avocado). I served this with a salad of black beans, hearts of palm, and corn (another Epicurious recipe). Also good.

I thought that these were great. I did not have any taco seasoning so I used a little chili seasoning. I served these "buffet" style letting everyone build their own.

easy to modify-- I blend avocado into the sour cream mixture. I recommend not using taco seasoning, finely ground ancho chile worked well. Substitute a pineapple of mango salsa for the sour cream mixture for two dishes in no time flat. Soft corn tortillas are not as messy.
