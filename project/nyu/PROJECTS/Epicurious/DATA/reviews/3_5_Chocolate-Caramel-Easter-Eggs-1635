My friends have been annoyed with me lately when I would say, "Oh, that was simple to make..." Well, I finally met my match with this recipe. Here is a link I wish I had known about before I set about this massive project: http://shine.yahoo.com/channel/food/show-up-the-easter-bunny-diy-chocolate-caramel-easter-eggs-1229644/ This shows the recipe picture from the magazine as well as illustrations of the various steps which really make things clearer. Don't be misled like I was; this is an all-day affair, and shouldn't be started at 10:00 at night like I did. I did both white and dark chocolate and ended up having all four burners going on my stove at once with caramel and ganache. I scorched my white chocolate (I used El Rey from Venezuela) a bit which added some discoloration, but the shells ended up perfect in terms of the snap when they were bitten into. I think the recipe calls for too much of the caramel, unless you don't mind not using most of your ganache, which in my case was a very expensive waste indeed. But I was so sick of tasting chocolate I couldn't even think of saving it for later. Still, all in all these were amazing; I gave them away so that I didn't die a second death from chocolate, but I did have two lovely desserts of the small white chocolate eggs which were heavenly, and I'm not even a huge white chocolate fan! Good luck; the chocolate molds I found at a cake decorating store, but I think Michael's and Hobby Lobby carry them as well.

I really want to make this recipe, but I don't know where to find the molds? Could someone please suggest a place?

The caramel was way too sticky and the chocolate made me have to wash my hands

it is good but for first timers you should have a picture of it on the page so they know what it looks like.

These Easter eggs are labor-intensive, but worth it. I make them every year and my friends talk about them for months. The chocolate and caramel fillings are superb

I liked it because my kids liked it, but they were hard to make. they were worth it, though!
