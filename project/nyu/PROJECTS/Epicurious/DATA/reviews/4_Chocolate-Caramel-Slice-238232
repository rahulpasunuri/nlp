I should have read the reviews 1st. I made it in a 1/2 sheet pan (11x17) and it was way too thin. I should have used a much smaller pan to doubled the recipe. Still good though. Love the sea salt with chocolate.

These are fabulous! I agree, cutting them into small pieces is best since they are very rich.

These are definitely sweet, but fabulous! Takes much longer to get to 225 degrees than 6 mintutes. I kept the recipe the same and used an 8x8 pan and they were perfect! Definitely would make again.

These were great! I packed some up for a friend who was traveling, who called to tell me he ate them all within a day and how good they were (we both love caramel though). I only had a jelly roll pan, so I made 1.5x the recipe (for the egg, I weight 2 yolks, and took half of that). I'm craving these again, so will probably make another batch tonight!

I make this recipe regularly - in particular, for events where one needs to bring a dessert. It's easy, and delicious, albeit in small squares. For me, it's pure childhood...and the version my mother made in NZ was MUCH sweeter than this version: the bittersweet chocolate really helps to cut the sweetness of the caramel layer. At any rate, I've never met a kid who didn't think it was f-a-n-t-a-s-t-i-c

These are outstanding. I found the Lyle's golden syrup at our Cost Plus- World Market.

One of our all-time favorite desserts. Absolutely fabulous. Don't skip on the sea salt - it's essential.

i tried this three times without any corn syrup (and then i tried it once with some corn syrup i did manage to find). it came out great, slightly less gooey and keeps its shape longer. i think i will omit the corn syrup altogether the next time i make this. great recipe!

Good, easy, but too, too rich for me. Could easily make 48 servings, as 24 makes too big a bar, and a little goes a long way. I used a 9x9 pan (81 sq in vs 77 sq in for a 11x7 pan)

does anyone know of anything i could use instead of dark corn syrup? i looked everywhere around town and couldn't find any. Will honey do? :)

These were delicious! I took them to work and everyone loved them, well worth the calories. They are very rich, smaller slices are good. To make cutting easier I lined the pan with foil so that I could just take out the whole slab and slice on a board. Yummy!

If you like really sweet desserts, this is the one for you. Not worth the calories in my book. My neighbor took the leftovers home to her kids, otherwise, I would have tossed it.

This is a very good recipe. When I served it the kids seemed to like it more than the adults. I followed the suggestion of the cook from Greensboro, NC and doubled the recipe and used a 10 x 15 inch jellyroll pan.. I was concerned that the 1 inch high sides would be a problem but the pan was just right. I also found that it was easier to cut when well chilled and used a metal bench scraper to make cleaner cuts. The bars also freeze very nicely and taste very nice when only partially thawed. I will definitely make these bars again.

Made this exactly to the recipe...well, okay, I didn't have any Maldon sea salt. It turned out perfectly & everybody that tried it loved it & asked me to make it again. A little goes a long way with this one...I cut it into 1 inch squares 'cuz it is so rich.MMM,MMM,MMM

Holy crap these were OUTSTANDING!! Easy, and ridiculously delicious. I was unsure how much salt to use, so I went light, glad I did, as I could see how it could easily over power the chocolate.

WONDERFUL! Very rich and impressive flavor. My guests loved it! This is not a low calorie dessert...............

These are fabulous. Even better... they are really easy. I forgot to sprinle them with salt - so now I have a reason to make them again.

These are delicious. My family loved them, and they are not lovers of caramel. My daughter stopped by and had one when I was out and called me to rave about them. She said it was more like butterscotch than caramel. I used the dark corn syrup because I couldn't find the golden syrup. Mmmmm.

This is an old and well loved favorite. Since I needed a large quantity for a party and didn't have an 11x7x2" baking pan, I doubled the recipe and put it into a 10x15" jelly roll pan. I found that it took quite a bit of effort to spread and pat the dough into the pan but it eventually covered the whole pan. I also found that it took much longer than 6 minutes for the caramel to reach 225 degrees even though I used a new candy thermometer. The finished product needs to be kept refrigerated until serving time otherwise it's too gooey. Having grown up in Scotland and finding these cookies in every tea shop and bakery, I take issue with the author as to this being an Australian dessert. We call them "Millionaire's Shortbread" in Scotland. The end result is delicious however, and worth the effort.

This was out of this world...loved them. Great recipe, easy, yummy, pretty and impressive! I did add 2 tablespoons of butter to the chocolate topping to make a little richer? Yum
