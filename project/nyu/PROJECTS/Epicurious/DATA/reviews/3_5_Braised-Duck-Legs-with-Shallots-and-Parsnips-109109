Very easy to make and very flavorful. I cut it down to serve two - no problem. I cooked it at 325 for two hours. At the higher temperature, I think the duck would have dried out.

Tried it with chicken and it was good, but not fantastic. the veggies were great, will have to try with duck!

This is a fair amount of work, but none of it is difficult. I cooked mine for 2 hours and that was definitely too long - the duck was a little tough. But it was very tasty.

Very delicious and impressive -- I agree with the other excellent reviews. Went nicely with a simple potatos dauphinois. Tip: Make sure your knife is extra sharp for the scoring of the duck skin!

Best duck recipe I've found online. I made this dish last thanksgiving to counter the in-laws overly dry turkey. It was a great succes resulting in lots of left over turkey... I served it with some onion chutney on a bed of greens with a banyuls vinegar/orange marmalade dressing, delicious...

Wow...great for a dinner party. I reduced and served for a party of 6. I replaced the duck legs with duck breasts (will use legs next time or maybe even chicken) I served this with asparagus soup with parmasan custards, foie fras with greens, wilted chard and finished it off with Breyers Ice cream drizzled with Starbucks Pumkin Spice syrup...it was a hit and it was easy.

This dish was delicious. I had homemade duck stock in the freezer and used a good french white bordeaux. Will add more veggies suggested by other reviewers. I allowed 2 legs per serving as I used muscovy duck which is smaller. Very good!

I made this for a dinner party of 10. It was excellent. Did all the work Friday night; not much left to do on Saturday. I added some golden beets to the mix of veggies. Served it with sauteed chard (couldn't find mustard greens) and it was a huge hit.

Mmm....just the right dish for this time of year. I roast duck often during the cold winter months. I made this last night, cut the portions down for a family of 3 and it came out so good. The duck was perfectly cooked, nice and crisp on top, juicey on the bottom. I love roasted veggies so this was especially good. I added a few sweet potatoes and carrots to the veggie mix.
