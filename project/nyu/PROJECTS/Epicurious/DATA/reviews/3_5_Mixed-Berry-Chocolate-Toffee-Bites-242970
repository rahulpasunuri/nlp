I tried these on foil, mini muffin tins and both were fine. Don't have them but those flexible silicone mini muffin cups or pans would be perfect because you could peel the chocolates off of them easily. I tried the 3 berries recommended and thought the rasperries were by far the best. Made these when hubby was out of town so I got to see how they were on day 2, 3, and 4 and I swear they just kept getting better. I kept them in the fridge. Delicious. Couldn't be easier and they look amazing unlike the picture here.

these were simple to make and a big hit at a family gathering -- left them on the tin foil and everyone gobbled them up....would definately make again and again and again....had several requests for the recipe.

Simple, yummy, let chocolate cool a little before dropping.

Was nervous to try these for an office potluck because of comments about the chocolate spreading too much. But I let the chocolate cool a bit and that helped. They spread more than in the picture but they still looked fine. I'd make these again for sure. Very fast and yummy. Use the best chocolate you can find for a delicious taste.

Instead of using grated orange peel, I used orange flavored chocolate bars by Paul Newman - our guests loved them. Plus with a 1 week old child, they were quick & easy!

Used mini-muffin pans and mini paper liners - held everything together. Some blueberries mixed in and a couple on top, semisweet chocolate, orange zest from the freezer and Skor toffee bits. Yum!

Didn't have toffee...used a few crushed almonds/walnuts instead. Very easy to make...will definately make again...very pretty dessert!

I agree with Wimeezer. Let the chocolate cool a bit. Also I will put my tray in the frezzer first,then when the chocolate hit the cold surface it will set up a base. Can't wait to try it. Off to the store now to buy my supplies. ;-)

The recipe compared to the photo doesn't match. Obviously there is a berry inside of the chocolate and not just on top like the recipe suggests. One reason why it's got puffiness. I think after the chocolate cools for a bit, I will stir berries into the mixture (without breaking them) before I use a spoon to drop them onto a sheet. Can't wait to make these, but I will have to adapt the recipe.

I wonder if allowing the chocolate to cool a bit before dropping would give you the puffed appearance in the photo?

So easy to make!

If you love toffee (which we do) you'll love this. Quick and easy. Even quicker if you stick them in the freezer. I put raspberries on top but I do agree with first review, chocolate spreads so they weren't as 'plump'. Perhaps put them in a little mold or something to look like that? Love the touch of orange too. MM good.

Very yummy, but chocolate naturally spread so they weren't as nice looking as the photo. I used white rasberries with semi-sweet and blackberries with the bittersweet.
