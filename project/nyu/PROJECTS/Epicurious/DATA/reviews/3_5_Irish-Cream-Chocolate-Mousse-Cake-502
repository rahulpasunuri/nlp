After carefully reading this recipe and pouring over all of the reviews, I tackled this recipe for my dinner club. I made the mousse the night before and cooked the eggs to 140 deg. like a reader suggested and that part came out perfectly. The next day I tackled the cake. I took much care in following this recipe to a T and my cake came out deflated. I ended up not making the layered cake, but turning this into individual trifles. I soaked the cake in the whiskey syrup for several hours, then cut it up into small pieces. I took pretty juice glasses and layered them w/ mousse on the bottom, the cake pieces, then mousse on top w/ the chocolate curls as a garnish. Definitely not an easy recipe, but fun to try! My dinner club gals raved over the taste AND the idea of individual trifles.

Also, using a tip from another reviewer, the cake rises much more successfully if the batter is beaten over hot water in a double boiler.

I've made this cake quite a few times. The cake is much more successful if the batter is divided and then baked in 3 9 inch pans. Of course, the baking time has to be adjusted, but the layers rise nicely. I've tried baking it in a deep springform pan but always get a crater in the middle.

The mousse was absolutely outstanding. To avoid chocolate "flecking", i just put it back in the stand mixer for a few spins- when it was incorporated into the whipped cream, it was still very light and had great texture. The cake was a complete failure. I wonder if there isn't a missing ingredient, such as baking powder or cream of tartar, but USE A DIFFERENT CAKE!!! I disregarded other reviews and ended up with a rubbery block and back in the kitchen on christmas eve trying to make another cake (from another recipe). Overall: the chocolate mousse is the best i've ever made. The cake isn't worth considering.

Wonderful Cake! I've made this cake many times for friends and family. I've generally followed the recipe, but have friends who don't like alcohol (even baked out). The mousse is quite good substituting Irish Cream Coffee Creamer for the Liqueur, and the Whiskey Syrup can be omitted.

LOVE AT FIRST BITE!!!! I made it with a boxed cake mix 13 x 9 pan and then added the mousse on top after it cooled like a thick frosting. I've made it now 3 times and everyone that has had it loves it!!!

**MOUSSE ONLY** ~ didn't bother with the cake as i was looking for a simpler dessert for st paddy's day. the mousse from this recipe fit the bill perfectly. if mixed properly, the texture is very smooth rather than grainy. very easy to make and delicious. i'll probably never bother with the cake based on the reviews.

As everyone says, the mousse itself is delicious, but as others also commented, mine was grainy with bits of chocolate. The flecks are actually kind of pretty, but not really what I had in mind. Once the mousse is in the cake, and surrounded by the chocolate curls and band, it comes across as smooth so it didn't end up being a problem, but I still think the mousse should be completely silky, and it wasn't. Therefore, I would definitely not serve it except as a component to a dessert with multiple textures. The cake itself didn't give me any trouble, although I did reduce the whisky to 4 tbsp from 5 so it wouldn't be quite as strong, and that seemed to be just the right amount. The presentation was truly stunning, and much easier to achieve than I'd expected. I was worried the bands would give me trouble, or the mousse woulnd't firm up, and everything wsa spectacular for a gorgeous finale. I recommended measuring your paper strips though - 14 1/2 inches was too short for my cake. You can't measure from the pan itself, because how thick your mousse on the sides will increase how long the circumference is. I liked that although this has a lot of rich ingredients, the overall impression of the dessert ends up being quite light.

I'm not very experienced making cakes from scratch, so after two 1-inch high cakes, I gave up and bought a dark chocolate cake mix from the store. Everything else turned out excellent. The mousse and the chocolate bands were both super- easy. It has received rave reviews, and I'm planning on making it again next month for a bridal shower.

This is an excellent dessert. It is absolutely decadent and a "once a year" type of treat. Beware that it is time consuming and you must be meticiulous with your work. But, it is well worth the effort. Our guests were amazed and we plan to make it again for this St. Pat's day feast.

This was my birthday cake, and for people that like Bailey's and chocolate it was a total hit. For the cake batter, I whisked the ingredients over a double boiler to 140F. They beat up quickly and the cake turned out wonderfully. Be careful not to let the mousse cool too much and get grainy. Letting the whole assembled cake sit for a couple days really enhanced the flavor. Just take the effort and care. You can make a total winner.

Excellent cake, flavourful but not too sweet. The espresso sponge is a fabulous combination with the creamy mousse.

I made this cake last week as a trial for a dinner parrty dessert for today (St. Paddy's Day.) The cake rose nicely, but fell quite a bit when it cooled. It was a mistake to try to cut into 3 layers, but I did. The mousse was the best! All in all the whole thing was too rich, and I don't make that statement too often. The outside "shell" also cracked when the cake was cut and lost some of it's charm. Fast forward to today when I've decided some minor modifications will make the cake more pleasing. I was going to cut only 2 layers, use 1/2 the mousse in the middle and cover the whole thing with a ganache. The cake turned out like a piece of rubber. Same ingredients, mixer, pan, oven. I'll never go to this much trouble again for the cake. I'm making blondies for tonight. But the mousse is a keeper.

Unless you have an expensive stand mixer no amount of mixing with your average hand mixer will get the cake batter to thicken.

Cake was a lot of work, but received raves at the office. Cooking the eggs over hot water left a lot to be desired, not sure I got them right. The spounge cake was dry and flat. But, with a little rework of the recipe and having been thru it once, I think the next time will be better.

This was not worth the effort. The mousse was good, but the cake was dry and flat. I don't know what all the rave reviews were about. Usually this site's reviews are very accurate and helpful. Very Disappointing Dessert.

I use Godiva chocolate liquor instead of Irish Cream and it's fantastic. People actually don't believe that it isn't from a pastry shop...most recently the looks of disbelief were on the faces of my grandmother's friends at her 85th birthday party! Only drawback is the time it takes to make it...my dad calls it the 3-day cake because when pressed for time I've made the bands/syrup on one day, mousse the next and finally baked and assembled on the third!

I've made this cake several times and found that 9 - 10 ounces of expensive chocolate is enough for the mousse and actually better than using 12 ounces of cheap chocolate. To address the problem of flecks in the mousse, you can blend the melted chocolate into the egg mixture thoroughly before adding the whipped cream. Don't be afraid that the slightly warm chocolate will deflate the egg mixture. Just drizzle it over the top while beating with the mixer on high speed. Once the chocolate is totally blended in, then you can fold in the cream by hand using care not to overmix. I use semi-sweet chocolate for the mousse, milk chocolate for the bands and dark chocolate for the curls. Only attempt this recipe if you have a couple of hours and are not in a hurry.

The only serious problem that I had was the presence of chocolate flecks in the mousse. If anyone knows how to avoid that, let me know. I think I let the melted chocolate cool off too much before blending with it the egg mixture and the whipped cream mixture. By the way, it took me forever (15 to 18 minutes) to get the egg mixture to thicken up and I am not sure that I reached the "very thick" stage described in the recipe. Still the mouse was delicious.The cake came out just fine, very light, very spongy, but fine. Working with the chocolate band was very, very messy and frankly I didn't think that the chocolate bands really added that much to the cake, since the mouse was so very rich on its own. I will make this again, I am looking for a real showstoper, signature dessert and this might be it. Maybe next time I'll use Kahlua or Amaretto.

Outstand recipe but quite an undertaking. Take it step by step and divide the work over a few days. You'll love the results. A few thoughts on execution ... 1) The syrup that is to be brushed over each cake layer was a bit overpowering. I'll use a lighter hand with it next time. 2) I was a bit intimidated by the chocolate band but shouldn't have been. An off-set frosting spatula is the perfect tool for the task. I made this cake in the dead of winter and think that a cold kitchen was really the key for working with the chocolate decorations. The hassle factor for this work probably triples in the summer months. 3) Use the inside of the springform pan as a gauge for the length of the chocolate band and add about 1/4". I actually let the edges overlap about 3/4" and found that with the dramatic piling of the chocolate curls the overlap was barely noticable. 4) As far as the chocolate curls go, forget about using the microwave to warm the chocolate (it was a disaster). I put a 60 watt light bulb in a desk lamp and positioned about 12-inches above the chocolate. About 45 seconds of warming yielded the perfect temperture for shaving the chocolate.

This was a colossal pita. I had to make the cake over since I didn't fold the flour quite well enough, and the cake came out with chunks of uncooked flour in it. I also overcooked the custard for the mousse, and it was grainy, so I redid that. The chocolate curls were messy as he__ to make. Having said that, it was absolutely beautiful, and everyone who saw it was impressed. It tasted good, but not as good as I was hoping. Soooo much effort. I'd make it again to impress someone special, but if I just need a chocolate cake, this won't be it. Too much involved.

This is my son's favorite cake. He has a late July birthday, and the hot and humid Washington, DC summer makes it a real challenge. I have been up in the early early morning many years to ensure the chocolat is easier to work with, but some years I ask him to postpone his cake until fall!

I thought the cake was kind of a pain to make. It looks really pretty when done but the cake was dry and tasteless. However, the mousse was wonderful tasting. I also had a hard time with the curl thing instead I used a syringe to squirt a fine stream of chocolate all over the top. Very pretty.

The MOUSSE was excellent -- the best I have ever made (and I have experimented with perhaps 5 or 6 other choc. mousse recipes. I would make that again and serve it alone. It will be fun to experiment with other liquers too (I think it would be even better with Kahua or Grand Marnier.) The overall combination of cake, syrup & mousse, however, left us a bit unimpressed. I didn't really care for the cake, and the whiskey syrup overpowered the other flavors, even though I only used half of it. My cake was quite dry -- I probably overbeat it in an attempt to ensure that it would rise enough. I think the cake would have been better with some melted butter added (See. for example, similar recipe for "milk and dark chocolate mousse cake", which I also considered when looking for a recipe.) The chocolate bands/curls were fun to try but very hard to work with -- especially in the heat & humidity of a Florida summer. I'd like to try the same type of presentation again, but will use a different cake recipe.

I didn't get to taste the cake until three days after it was made but it was still delicious. The friend I made it for already has requested it for her husband's birthday. I lost the bottom of my springform pan so I baked it in two 9 inch cake pans and the cake turned out fine.

Living in Denver, I believe the altitude here made the cake flop - it had a huge crater in the center. However all was not lost, I soaked the cake in the brandy syrup, cut it up, placed in a bowl and topped it with Bird's Custard. Voila - I now had Irish Whisky Trifle. My guest loved the trifle - many had seconds! So if your cake doesn't turn out, don't toss it! The mousse is also divine on a chocolate cake from a mix.

Absolutely fabulous. This cake does take some time, and the choc curls nearly killed me, but I will DEFINITELY be making this again. Presentation is gorgeous and v. good flavor. The mousse by itself could be a dessert.

This cake was delicious, my husband is begging me not to make it again, since he can't stop eating it! 2 things: you either have to heat the egg mixture for the cake or beat it forever...also the description for making the chocolate curls wasn't the best, if you add a tbsp of solid shortening and then pour the chocolate onto a cookie sheet and spread, chill for about 2 minutes, (frig not freezer) you should have no problem. I use a 1" putty knife to create the curls, works perfectly! One of the prettiest presentations, this will remain in my cake file.

This cake was delicious, but I have a few more comments. When making the cake, I believe the eggs should at least triple in volume and be very airy. That's why warming the eggs is crucial. Getting the chocolate bands to meet seamlessly was a problem for me too. I think they need to be slightly longer than 14 1/2". I ended up squeezing them together by putting my 9" springform sides around it, but the seams still didn't quite meet. My biggest problem was the chocolate curls. Microwaving was a disaster and I ended up using shavings instead, which wasn't nearly as pretty.

Thanks Petersborough for the encouraging words! I have finally assembled this cake and it does look beautiful. A few notes: I made a second cake since I forgot to parchment the first pan and it stuck. Yes, it took a full 25 minutes to get the batter to ribbon. The suggestion about warming up the eggs makes a lot of sense now! I ended up straining my mousse (tedious!) because I guess I'm just too nitpicky. I had to make more to get the full 28 oz. needed and I used an old Jacques Pepin recipe which basically calls for melted chocolate folded together with whipped cream. Much easier and just as tasty...no eggs to cook! Email me if you want the recipe. Incidentally, I discovered that folding the cold whipped Bailey's/Cream s-l-o-w-l-y into the chocolate (1/4 of the cream at a time) made the mousse smooth, and not flecked with chocolate bits. Big difference. How did everybody get the 2 chocolate bands to join seamlessly on the cake? they really don't press together too easily and if you handle it too much it gets messy. Any ideas? I know, I know, it'll still taste great but if I'm going to spend this much time on the project I'd like it to look perfect!

I have made this cake at least four times since the issue first came out because the first one was such a hit. People keep asking for it again! The key is texture-each step must be given enough attention. I learned that after my first cake came out about the height and texture of a silver dollar.

Very good. Baked it for my annual all you can eat chocolate open house. Was very popular with the guests, although rich enough for people to ask "where's the milk?". The chocolate bands took longer to firm up than specified in recipe. The microwave time for chocolate curls was way too long.

This cake is lovely and delicious, but it is a production. (The chocolate collar is actually the easiest part.) I would suggest starting the mousse and the cake the night before assembly. A previous reviewer's suggestion to whip the mousse before spreading was right on the money. A word to the wise: the cake must be beaten at HIGH speed. The batter is ready when it is about doubled in volume, the color of cafe au lait and has a velvety texture. I found this out the hard way. I did beat the batter for 8 minutes, but my speed was too low to incorporate enough air into the batter. The result? A cake the height and texture of a leather bar stool seat. I put it in the freezer to throw at a burgular if anyone ever breaks into my house. My second attempt, beaten at a high speed, came out right. My book club devoured it!

I made this cake to bring to my parents' house via subway, ferry and train (two hours travel time) so I omitted the chocolate collar and curls and didn't frost the sides, just the top and between the layers. I put the cake back in the springform pan and froze the whole thing, well wrapped, overnight so the mousse wouldn't be warm and runny by the time I arrived. Even without being as pretty as it could have, it was utterly scrumptious and a huge hit -- luscious, moist and rich. I agree with an earlier reviewer that you must beat the batter for as long as instructed. I did and my cake came out very light and high ... plenty thick enough to cut into three nice layers. I can't wait to try this recipe again with the chocolate collar and curls this time!

Your search has ended. This is the BEST cake I have ever found. WOW!!! I made this for a Birthday party and the complements were never-ending. Very rich. I let the Mousse chill over-night and found it to be easier to spread when mixing it for a momment. I used Kahlua instead of Irish cream. Complaments the coffee in the Cake very nicely. The overall look of this cake is very impressive.

Every time I make this recipe, I receive the most astonished looks and amazed compliments. It is extremely important that you don't skimp on the amount of beating required or your cake will come out flat. Although the chocolate bands may sound complicated, they really are quite easy; give them a try! Make sure your cake is completely cool or the bands will have trouble hardening (I put the cake in the freezer).Don't try to peel the wax paper off if there are a few sections that are still a little gooey; put it back in the frig a little longer. Like a previous reviewer suggested, I used white and dark chocolate for the curls which made the presentation even better.

I have made this dessert numerous times and have always received raves. It's quite simple and looks very elegant. You can play with the recipe and use other liquers for different tastes. Amaretto works quite well. I have also decorated the chocolate bands with milk and white choclate swirls to give it a different look. I wish I had a slice of it right now!
