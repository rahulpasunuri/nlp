Roma tomatoes worked better for me thinly sliced. I did not use the broiler as I did not have one but obtained a similar result by 'venting' a lid occasionally. It was not golden brown in the end, but was cooked.

Great taste. I followed the recipe closely, except for taking advice of some reviewers and did not set the items aside after cooking - I just did potatoes first, added the garlic, then added the tomatoes. I shaved a minute off the cooking time for potatoes so they wouldn't be overdone.

This is a great recipe. I think it involves more steps than necessary, though. I just sauteed the potatoes half wayish, then added tomatoes and finished with the garlic. Otherwise, you're adding oil upon oil w/each step and unnecessarily transferring things out of the skillet. Also, broil in the actual oven vs. the underneath broiling area (in cheapy ovens like I have). Can easily burn otherwise.

My family including me love fritattas and Spanish tortillas but none of us liked the cherry tomatoes with the other favors.

I actually made this as dinner which was a decision I am very happy about. My family and I tend to eat a lot, but having this frittata, with 8 oz. of mushroom slices added in, and a side salad made dinner simple, delicious, healthy, and lite. We were satiated afterwards without feeling like we overate at all. Like curry, this dish is an excellent one to throw in whatever vegetables or leftover ingredients from other recipes that happen to be in the refrigerator. Very family friendly for all ages to enjoy.

My family really enjoyed this dish for Sunday brunch. I followed the recipe fairly closely, but made 2 simplifications. Instead of sauteing the potatoes, I diced them and microwaved them for 3 minutes. Instead of beating the eggs and pouring over the potato/tomato mixture, I simply broke the whole egg over the dish and poached them on top of the potatoes. There was enough liquid from the tomatoes to make this work. I plan to repeat the dish with variations (How about with spinach/feta/oregano?) for inexpensive week night dinners.

This was a great, healthy breakfast alternative. For more flavor, I added a red onion and cooked with the potatoes. Also used a pound of potatoes and added in a few more tomatoes b/c I had so many. This resulted in throwing in 2 more eggs, as well. But it was a hearty egg dish, perfect for a brunch!

Great recipe.Next time would use less basil and more tomatoes. I like basil but this was too overpowering.

This was a pretty tasty veggie frittata. I added extra cheese and threw in mushrooms just to make sure it would be flavourful. I threw in a splash of milk for good measure. I did not have an oven-proof skillet or broiler-proof baking dish so I poured the mix into a deep circular baking dish and baked it at 350F for about 20 minutes.

I agree that this is a good basic recipe, which could lend itself to many variations. Served bacon on the side, but would also be great in the frittata. It took me a little longer in terms of prep time than I expected, and a little less cooking time. I used an iron skillet, but will use a nonstick pan next time. If you are swamped with cherry tomatoes and basil like we are, this is a good use for them.

This was OK. Not too interesting, next time may add pancetta or bacon...but makes for a good breakfast.

This is a great base to go off of. I added salami, and shredded mozzarella to the egg mixture and I didn't cook the tomatoes with the potatoes. I prepared the night before with so I could enjoy my holiday brunch out of the kitchen. Great with watercress salad on the side. I love that you can just throw in whatever you have in the fridge, perfect for getting rid of left-overs!

I added Smoked Paprika to the egg mix, and diced Chanterelle mushrooms which I cooked with the potatoes, just to experiment (it was delicious). Also, I didn't have the right sized pan that would safely go in the broiler so before I added the egg mix, I put the ingredients into three individual stainless steel cooking circles (i don't know the proper name for them is). I continued the preparation as described on the stovetop, then carefully put the circles into a baking pan and into the broiler. I used a little less broiler time--had to watch the cheese so it didn't overcook. It make for a nice individual portions.

Excellent breakfast for weekend guests. Fresh basil & tomatoes from the garden help a lot! We would recommend not skimping on the olive oil (which we did) to avoid sticking in the pan.

This is one of those dishes with which you can definitely experiment (i.e., great as is but variation tolerant). I used less olive oil and more cheese. I also added artichoke hearts (yum). Also makes great leftovers.

Very good, but only 2 forks as is. Next time I'll add a little crisp bacon or panchetta and play with the cheese mixture (maybe some feta or goat in addition to the parm. Will also let the last addition of parmesan just melt rather than brown in the broiler as it became a little dry. Good as leftovers for lunch - so will definitely make again as a light dinner or brunch dish

As other reviewers have said, this recipe can stand up to experimentation. I HATE eggs, can't stand them at all, but, incongruously, I like spanish tortilla. So this was the first time I'd ever cooked an egg, and with the help of my roommate, I discovered how easy they are. I threw in spinach, mushrooms and thin sliced the potatoes. Next time (there will be a next time) I'll play around even more - maybe some eggplant or zucchini.

Very flavorful with fresh basil and lots of parmesan reggiano. I used sunburst cherry tomatoes. My only problem was the egg didn't get to the bottom of the pan enough. The veggies were layered on the bottom and the egg topped it. I feel that is just a technique I need to practice. Overall, was delicious and I will make it again.

I really think this recipe requires a non-stick pan. I used a regular pan, so the potatoes and tomatoes created a residue on the bottom that burned in the oven. If someone doesn't have a non-stick pan and wants to make this, consider removing the vegetables, cleaning the pan, putting them back in and then adding the egg.

Great basic recepe. I doubled the potatos and sliced them thin and added smoked paprika and spinich. Once I also added blanched asparagus and sauteed morel mushrooms for unbeleiveble frittata employing a classic french flavor pairing. Do not be afraid to inovate but remember that you need to precook most additions in order to get the water out so that the frittata will cook properly. Think of your favorite flavor combinations and get to work. Dish is great at room temp the next day.

Great frittata recipe and easy to make. One hint - dry off the cherry tomatoes before adding them to the already heated oil. The water tends to spatter when added to the hot pan.

A fairly simple but very tasty recipe. I followed it pretty much to the letter, but cut out a little bit of oil and skipped the last 1/4 cup of parmesian cheese on top. It was a big hit. Served it for dinner with salad and bread.

This was good, but nothing spectacular. The flavours worked well together, but it was missing something. I think it would taste very good with more of the parmesan cheese mixed in as well.

This dish was so easy and such a nice change for a summer afternoon. I added a little mozzarella cheese because I love tomato,basil and mozz. I also sliced my potato into thin slices instead of dice. I took leftovers for lunch the next day and it nuked beautifully.

I made this for brunch and my guests loved it. It was really good. I agree with someone else's comments that the potatoes tend to stick unless you use a non-stick frying pan.

Wanted to make a change for husband for breakfast, so I looked at this recipe.....I saw something similar on Martha Stewart yesterday so I figured it was a sign! lol Didn't have tomatoes, so drained out some garden salsa, didn't have whole garlic so used minced garlic in the jar, also used red potatoes and dried basil, and it still was excellent! Nice change for breakfast!

This is easy and very tasty. The only problem I had was with the potatoes sticking while I sauteed them. Next time I'll add a little extra oil at that stage rather than with the tomatoes.

I really love the flavors in this recipe. I added Spinache and used swiss cheese and used some salsa for a little extra bite. I'm sure my family will love it.

I made this for Boss' Day which is today. My coworkers and I did a brunch for our supervisor is a great person. This was the center of attraction. The only thing I did different was I used roasted garlic and topped it with Borden 4 Mexican Cheeses, I used parmesean in the egg mixture. I baked it in the oven in a large baking dish since I used 12 eggs and it turned out wonderful.

This was delicious and simple. I used Yukon Gold unpeeled potatoes in a small dice. After sauteeing them I finished them off in the microwave. I used 8 eggs, rather than the extra egg whites. Mine was served in small squares at room temperature at a buffet style "Tuscan" dinnerand passed for authenticity.

Just wonderful! I made several modifications to make preparation easier. I used leftover hashbrowns (cubed) for potatoes. Reheated them a bit, added garlic, then tomatoes, then egg mixture. Didn't worry with removing things from pan, etc - just layered it all in. I used 5 whole eggs. Didn't include egg whites. Served with salad. Flavors were just great.

Easy and Delicious. I used diced garden tomatoes and boiled the potatoes for 10 minutes to shorten the cooking time. I added 1/2c. mozzarella on top instead of the parm. because that is all I had. I baked it in a glass pie dish for about 10 minutes on 350. I also left out one of the yolk and used eggbeaters to cut out some of the cholesterol.

This was delicious! I made it with a dozen eggs and did the whole thing on top of the stove - covered and then flipped it to cook the top side. Fed 8 people at the cabin for an easy and wonderful breakfast with sausage and toast.

I made a variation of this dish last weekend, and although I changed a few things, I wasn't too impressed with the whole idea. I made the Frittata pretty much as written, less the tomatoes. It puffed up beautifully under the broiler, than collapsed when removed and looked a little flat when served. Tasted a little flat too despite the using both fresh basil and fresh oregano. I used two pints of "grape" tomatoes to make a little relish/salsa, adding green onion, cilantro, red wine vinegar and olive oil. Served this along side to brighten things up. Good thing i did.

This is definitely one of the best frittata recipes I've used. Simple ingredients, accurate directions, and a rich, delicious result. Use the best cherry tomatoes you can find for a summery burst of flavor. And it looks beautiful too.

I thought this recipe was bland and dry..i sauteed the poatatoes until brown and maybe this was not the right thing to do.

WOW! Great recipe. Easy, light summer fare. I didn't fuss and used diced tomatoes and unpeeled potatoes...didn't affect the outcome. I will gladly make this dish again.

I loved this recipe! We made it twice, but never found the grape tomatoes. The first time I used small pear toms and the second time tiny cherry toms. YUM!
