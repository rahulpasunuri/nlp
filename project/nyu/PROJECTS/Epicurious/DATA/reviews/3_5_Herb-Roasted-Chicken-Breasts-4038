This was a quick easy weeknight meal that was big on flavor, and even my 2yo gobbled it up. I started with room temperature chicken and cooked it according to the recipe. it came out perfect - juicy and just cooked through.

Very tasty, moist, and simple to prepare. I made a double batch, served with roasted mixed winter vegetables and a salad, which made an excellent dinner for a two- family, casual dinner party. Everyone loved it. Prep was quick, and I appreciated not needing to do anything right before serving. I used Empire brand kosher chicken breasts, which always taste best, mixed the oil with the herbs and garlic, and spread the mixture all over the chicken. I cooked the chicken at 450 degrees, which helped crisp the skin without needing to broil it, and from several other recipes I have used, find that the high heat keeps the chicken moister than a more moderate temperature.

Easy and delicious. I added an equal amount of sage but followed a previous recommendation to use the suggested amount for less than half of the chicken for flavorful gravy. I threw in onions, carrots and potatoes to roast with the chicken. This is now in regular rotation!

I love this recipe! I used 4 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken breasts (6 large breast), 6 cloves of garlic and about 2-3 Tbsp chopped rosemary, salt and pepper. I drizzled with olive oil and used a Sauvignon Blanc. I baked these for about 35-37 minutes, turned the oven off and left the pan in the oven to rest. I sliced them up and poured some of the sauce over top. This is great for a party and it's equally as good at room temp. It was a big hit at my party yesterday.

This was great, especially for a dish rated "low cal"! Very easy, tasty, and aromatic. I added the oil to the garlic-spice mixture, and used the full amount for only 3 breasts. I coated the breasts with the mixture 1 1/2 hours ahead of time. They were really good for a week night meal.

Simple to make and very tasty! It's not a fancy dish, but it was still nice enough to serve to guests.

Fabulous and way easy to make recipe!!! I made it for Christmas dinner... I really wanted to make a roasted chicken but thought this was easier. I also put the garlic and herbs inside the chicken's skin as suggested by other reviews. My guests liked it so much, that they stole the recipe and made it for New Years eve!!!!

I too am always on the lookout for dishes I can prep beforehand, and then anyone can put them in the oven, so dinner is ready when the rest of us get home. It's true, the house smelled great - I could smell it outside! I inadvertently mixed the oil in with the garlic and seasonings. I don't think it affected the outcome. I made the garlic mix for 6 breasts, and only roasted 2, so we had something in the pan to pour over them. And the chicken cooked for 55 minutes, and was moist and browned on top. I didn't need the broiler step.

I've rated this 4 forks because it is easy, good, makes the house smell great & is fridge friendly. Great week night comfort food meal. Chicken is juicy, can add any vegies, seasonings. It's not so much this recipe, but the procedure. Dump everything onto a cookie sheet. Drizzle with olive oil. Add seasonings your family likes. Vegies your family likes. Tonight I had red peppers, parsnips, carrots, onions & potatoes. Seasoned with coarse salt & fresh ground pepper, thyme & oregano. Just because it's what I had. And! Ta! Da! In 1 hour is supper with little or no work. House smells sooo good! Husband said it was a great meal. Easy clean up. Yup! It's a four!

This was a great recipe to do for a large party! I rubbed chicken with all ingredants the night before - come party time, I simply stuck them in the oven and then everyone's meal was done at the same delicable time. The house smelled incredible and drew everyone into the house. I did have to cook chicken for about 40 minutes.

This is a great recipe, and very easy to make anytime! The chicken is juicy, and the outside is crispy, just the way we like it! I needed to cook it a bit more, however, approximately 50 minutes.

This is a great, easy recipe. Other reviews have noted that it is nothing special, but here's the trick--rub them with olive oil in the morning and let them sit in the fridge all day. The flavor really soaks in and I think it makes a huge difference.

We liked this recipe and would definitely make it again. I did cook it longer than instructed, however, and it came out great.

I thought this recipe was great! It took me no time at all and the chicken was juicy, flavorful and skin perfectly crispy. I run a business where I cook for clients and deliver food to their homes. This one goes out tomorrow, but we had it tonight. I think it will get rave reviews from my clients.

Hey, take it easy, with such simple ingredients did you really expect a gormet dish? I made this using only three chicken breasts but thought the amount of garlic/herbs/oil looked skimpy, so I didn't halve any of that. Came out juicy and delicious. An easy weeknight recipe.

Very tasty, but too basic so I placed chicken on a bed of spinach, cut a ripe garden tomato in rounds and placed on top of spinach, put chicken breasts on top, rubbed with the oil and herbs, salt and pepper and sprinkled with parmasean cheese. I placed the wine in the bottom to start the spinach cooking. It was quite good. Feta cheese would work well too.

With a convection oven, roast at 325 for 22 minutes...to increase flavour marinate in herb/garlic/oil mixture for several hours...delicious

It was quick and easy, but didn't have as much distinctive flavor as I expected.
