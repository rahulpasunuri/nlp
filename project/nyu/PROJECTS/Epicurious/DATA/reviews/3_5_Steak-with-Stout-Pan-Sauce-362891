Made this and threw it out. Didn't have a good flavor, wouldn't have added anything to the steak... Also, I did not spread the mustard on the steak. I was worried about it burning on the high heat of the pan. Glad I didn't. This was very disappointing.

This is a quick dish to make and the unexpected flavour of the guinness pan sauce made it a big hit. The sauce is delicious and a nice change from the usual accompaniments of peppercorn, bearnaise, etc. I followed the recipe exactly and would not make any changes. I will absolutely make it again as it is a crowd pleaser.

This rich and flavorful sauce is an excellent alternative to bottled steak sauce. I skipped the mustard on the steaks and kept it simple with salt and pepper. Tempura onion rings are delish dipped in the sauce.

I made this tonight and we liked it. Next time I would simply salt and pepper the meat( I used filets); the mustard burned during the sauté step. The sauce was good, maybe had a bit too much mustard....might reduce it next time. I agree with the previous reviewer that some chopped parsley might add some color, or even a little chopped rosemary (I love rosemary with beef). The sauce really has a nice color. I would make this again.

Good but nothing out of this world! Interesting discussion about stout!! Plenty of good U.S. equivalents, but Guinness (from Ireland) is still the gold standard!!

I made sauce for burgers and it was easy and delicious!

This recipe was excellent. I made it virtually per instructions but I cut it in half because I only had a little bit of steak. Okay, I used Worcestershire because I didn't have soy. Okay and I used an Amstel Light because that's all I had. This was really delicious. I polled the family and this is going into the repertoire.

This is an easy to make robust steak. I cooked the steak per the directions, but they needed a bit more time. Next time I may grill the steaks as it is not necessary to make the sauce in the same pan in which you cook the steak. Goes well with french fries and a full bodied red wine.

I enjoyed this dish. The Guinness sauce was a nice accompaniment to the steak. Nothing incredible, but easy to make.

my family really enjoyed this. i used a pale ale honey mustard instead of dijon. i agree with the reviewer that said it was a bit too thick; i ended up using 2 cups of beef broth to thin it a bit. although i understand that geography is important, would love reviews about the recipe in addition.

Stout is a beer from the British Isles, with Guinness being specific to Ireland. Ireland is NOT part of Great Britain or the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland is part of the UK, but Ireland is a separate country.

My bad, Ireland is part of UK not GB. Woops. haha.

First of all...Ireland is part of Great Britain so Guinness is technically British beer...so there...haha. Anyways, I wasn't to impressed with this recipe. It lacks some brightness or something. It seemed too heavy and one dimensional. It needs something to lighten it up maybe just something as simple as a little fresh parsley to finish it off. My gf liked it but she likes anything with beef.

Guinness is Irish beer, not British.

This was so easy to make, perfect for an impromptu dinner party. It got rave review from my friends. I used the suggestion of the previous review and used low sodium beef broth and it turned out perfectly. I think next time I'll try making sauce for grilled steaks.

This recipe was absolutely delicious, fast, simple and satisfying. The flavors were delicious, however next time I would make a couple minor changes. I would cut the butter/flour mixture in half (or omit the flour) the sauce became a bit too think. I used regular beef broth but low sodium is necessary as it was a bit too salty. The recipe is absolutely delicious, I cant wait to make it again!
