This is an incredibly fresh and easy way to add a little something extra to normal berries and cream type of dessert. I served it at a luncheon over vanilla frozen yogurt - very popular.

This was exceptionnally good when properly done. I made it twice. The first time it was the best dessert I have ever had and the second time, it was bitter. To avoid bitterness, though, you need to make sure of 2 things: 1. be extra careful not to peel white pulp when zesting the orange, use a wide zester, not a microplane and 2. keep the caramel a light tea colour. Alcohol is not what would make this dish bitter. It is a fantasmagoric dessert when done properly! Give it a try! Dominique, from Vancouver, BC.

Overall I thought this was a good recipe. However It was a little too much orange liquor, which made it a little too bitter. Also it is very important that the strawberries are put in the pan before the heat is turned off, otherwise the sauce becomes sticky and bitter and very hard to eat without leaving most of it in your teeth.
