This is a yummy, filling soup! I used all locally grown veggies so the result was incredibly flavorful and fresh. Substituted leeks for onions -- figured they're a natural pairing with potatoes and thought they would add more flavor. Pureeing with an immersion blender is much easier than transferring to food processor, imho. After incorporating several handfuls of spinach, I decided that was enough -- not sure how much I used but the flavor balance was good. The soup was thick so added a bit more chicken broth during pureeing. Cilantro is not popular in my home so used fresh basil and oregano from my garden. Suggest serving with some freshly grated Parm Reggiano on top. Herbed croutons work as well.

This is an absolute winner, even my kids love it. The cilantro gives it a very exotic taste. It has become a family recipe

I think the only way this could be bland enough to need strong spices such as curry is if you don't really enjoy the tastes of spinach and zucchini. It does need a bit extra to it so I added 1/2 cup heavy cream and about the juice of one lemon, and cut the cilantro used in half. This gave more richness but didn't take away from the fantastic flavors already there.

Man, I liked this soup. But have to admit I did add red pepper flakes at the onion saute phase. My advice: Use the recipe as a guide, but take responsibility for your own spices. (Also, don't cover the soup while it's simmering, I accidentally did this and the result was a little watery.)

As previously suggested, I added several cloves of garlic that I sauteed with the onions, then cumin and some hot pepper flakes before pureeing, also I compromised with about 1/2 cup of cilantro. I thought the taste was excellent but I'm simply not a fan of smooth soups. next time I will definitely keep at least 1/2 of the vegies intact to add the kind of texture I like. My DH loved it.

As other reviewers suggested, I added garlic, curry powder and lime juice, and cut back the cilantro a bit. No matter. This has little flavor and I wouldn't make it again.

This soup was fantastic!! And so much fun to play with, we wanted a chunky soup so we didn't puree the veggies, added chicken pieces, asparagus, mushrooms, garlic... oh yeah, left out the cilantro, but used some for garnish as well as some monteray jack cheese. oh, the soup gods were watching my kitchen last night! We renamed in Swamp Soup because of the bright color!

If you follow the recipe precisely, you may be disappointed. Take the reader's advice and give it a little zing. I would take another stab at this soup with maybe less cilantro and more seasoning.

I followed the directions exactly and wonder why it is called zucchini and spinach soup. All I could taste was cilantro. I'm glad the ingredients were cheap and it was not time concuming since it ended in the garbage.

I made this tonight with only a few alterations. I added a few stems of asparagus, some Baby Bella and white mushrooms, and about four or five cloves of roasted garlic. I also only had one onion, so I used a shallot to substitute the missing onion. I think that if the cilantro had not been so overpowering, I would have died and gone to heaven. However, all I could taste was cilantro! I used whipping cream instead of water to thin it out, even though I was happy with the consistency (I was hoping the cream would mellow it out). I also added some parmesan. After this, the flavor improved somewhat, although the cilantro was still the prevalent flavor. I did love the approach to this vegetable base cream, and plan on using it forevermore as my base for a "everything but the kitchen sink" approach to veggie soup. I just need to experiment with the cilantro! It was sooooo easy too- since everything is going to be blended, no need to uniformly chop, and it needs very little supervision!

A really good soup. The color is so vibrant when i was done cooking it that I felt like I was eating pure health. I tried the soup as-is and is was good but I went for a squeeze of lime and found that I liked it better that way. My husband added a little curry to his bowl and it was equally delicious. My impression is that the lime gave the soup a more spring/summer flavor and the curry gave the soup a full autumn/winter flavor.

This was a perfect way to use my summer garden zucchinis. I added garlic & some curry, but I also added some cayenne for more kick.

Thanks to the helpful tips of other reviewers, I ended up with some delicious soup. I sauteed garlic with the onions and added curry powder and a bit of pepper when the soup was cooking. I served it chilled, with yogurt (a lot), fresh lime juice, and salt.

This soup was satisfying, but we found that it lacked a bit of a kick, so we added the juice of one lime and about a teaspoon of curry powder to give it a little zing.

Great last minute recipe that hits the spot on a cold winter night. I had to modify the recipe somewhat. Did not have cilantro on hand but put some leeks in with the onion and small amount of crushed red pepper flakes. Also did not have fresh spinach so used frozen and a little less than the recipe called for ( 4 oz). Did not add any extra seasonings beyond herbamare and fresh pepper. Pureed until really smooth made all the difference. Also would like to comment on some of the reviews that said it lacked taste and to add cumin. I think it is important to have a good density of vegees to broth/water and the saute is what kicks the flavour off. I did not want to disturb the delicate flavour of zucchini/potato with a strong seasoning such as cumin - although I am sure it works.

Reading previous reviews..DUH..of course it is FRESH CILANTRO. I made this with vegetable broth as my children are VEGAN. Served it as written the first night,with mixed reviews (mostly too bland)so the next night I added salt, pepper and curry. Didn't think garlic was called for (and we LOVE garlic). If not for the Vegans I would have garnished with sour cream. Using an immersion blender made this a very simple and delicious soup.Next time a squeeze of fresh lemon sounds great.

Very, very tasty, although it definitely needs garlic -- I used about four or five cloves (we dig garlic). I agree with others... don't be shy with the cilantro! This recipe might sound kind of weird at first (we had our doubts) but it turned out amazing.. and so green, just in time for St Patrick's day!

Gentle Readers, Do not be afraid of the herb that goes by either cilantro or coriander. Typo or no, be generous with this green. I used one bunch of it in this recipe and the taste was amazing--neither too cilantro-y nor not cilantro-y enough. Also, used Swiss chard in lieu of spinach as, once again, my CSA dumped a mass of that slimy green on me. Sauteed half the chard with the onions and then pureed the rest fresh in the cilantro step. I followed previous reviewers advice and added lemon, cumin, and curry powder. The resulting soup is very flavorful and complex and tastes even better the next day (and days following that). Totally surprised that a zucchini soup could taste this good.

healthy and tastes like it! pretty good soup, DEFINITELY be careful about the crazy coriander measurement which is 1 1/2 TABLESPOONS not cups. Toasted cumin seeds ground are important for a bit more complex flavor and then a dallop of yogurt on top. MUST eat chocolate cake for dessert or just too healthy!

This soup is wonderful, and for those of you with gardens and zucchini the size of baseball bats, here's a recipe for you! We even got a 6 year old to eat and enjoy it. I also put other fresh crunch veggies in here sometime too. Fresh corn is quite nice I think.

I read the reviews of this recipe before I tried it. I added only a pinch of cilantro, fearing the amount called for was a typo. I also added cumin, as one reviewer suggested, the second day I added curry powder and served it cold. The soup is now excellent.

Realising that there is more cilantro than spinach called for, I reasoned early on that it was a typo. This is a lovely and brilliant green soup that tastes delicious chilled as a prelude to a light summer supper.

Rating: 3
Definitely a typo here - the cilantro should be 1 1/2 tablespoons not 1 1/2 cups. The only time you should use 1 1/2 cups of cilantro is in a vat of pico de gallo! Really folks, this is a really easy to make soup with a gorgeous color and yummy taste. An excellent first course for fish.

If I can save you from wasting time and ingrediants, do NOT do this recipe. This was a tasteless, bright green pot of warm cilantro. I read the mixed reviews beforehand and attempted it anyway, much to my dismay. As a precaution I even put extra salt and a whole bouillon cube to try to avoid the comments I read about lack of zest but must agree with the fellow who said only the cilantro flavor came through. There is way to much of it and it overpowers any other flavor.

I made this last night and really liked it. It's not astounding, but I thought it was really nice for a light dinner, and it's very healthy. Plus it turns out the gorgeous bright green. I will definitely make it again. One thing, I did have to add a lot of salt to it to make it flavorful enough. Next time I might add a few other ingredients, maybe some garlic.

I was looking for a quick easy soup to compliment a weekday dinner. The reviews on this one looked good, I had the ingreddients, I tried it. I wasted nice fresh vegetables. The only taste that came through was the cilantro. The rest was just green goop whose had no redeeming quality and no taste. Maybe homegrown zucchini from the garden might produce a different result but this one was plain awful.

This tastes like a rich cream soup and is beautiful as well as delicious. A definite hit in my house.

Made this the day before. Added some cumin to give it some zing, though I think when the flavors melded overnight it was 1) excellent with the cumin, but 2) would have been just fine without as well. Served with a Tbsp of yogurt mixed with lemon. I did notice that the beautiful bright green soup became more pea green after being reheated in a hard-anondized pot. Was that the soup or the pot changing the color?

It was a great yummy soup I made for Easter dinner. It tastes very fresh because the spinach and cilantro are pureed while fresh. It looked very nice with some heavy cream drizzled over the surface for presentation, although sour cream would probably work better...everyone liked it.
