I made only the icing (to to pair with a plain white cake with white chocolate mousse filling). I suppose I'm not a fan of buttercream; I find this type of frosting melts in your mouth and leaves nothing behind. Soooo, I added extra lemon juice for some kick and added about half a cup of powered sugar, plus some lemon zest. Turned out nice. Note: you MUST keep whipping at high speed, even though it looks scary and separated for awhile.

Very difficult cake & icing with not enough yield for the icing. Dryish cake. I don't mind labor intensive recipes, and I enjoy learning some new skills, such as how to make a Swiss meringue, but it freaked me out how it separated midway through the process. I learned, after making the recipe, that it helps if the butter is at the same temperature as the meringue. I think it might help to have the butter "well" softened instead of "slightly" softened. After all that preparation, it doesn't yield enough icing. I would double the recipe to have enough to cover a cake enough so the cake doesn't show. I would also add at least a half stick more butter to the cake batter to make it moister. I might even pour some orange liqueur into the finished cakes to make them moister and more flavorful. I think it could use even more orange and lemon flavor, so I might use more zest and juice or enhance the natural ingredients with a bit of lemon and/or orange extract.

A lovely, delicate and moist cake, but the icing was a disaster. My icing separated as soon as I added the liqueur and lemon juice (maybe a little too much?) and would not re-gel, no matter how much I whipped it. DRAT, because the flavor was exquisite. Thus, I recommend measuring that lemon juice carefully! One hint for simpler cake baking, if you don't own a stand mixer is to throw the softened butter, sugar and zest into the food processor and let it whoosh for 10 minutes. Your wrist will appreciate the break from the hand mixer.

My sister ( a culinary trained chef ) and I made this cake for my daughters First Communion. Directions were followed to a T. We read the other poor reviews but decided to try it because it sounded great with the citrus. It was NOT a good cake. The cake was not moist at all. Even fresh it seemed to be stale. I'm not sure if I would have liked the frosting on another cake, but I certainly didn't think it was anything special.

This frosting was great, even though I omitted the liqueur and added a bit more lemon juice. When I added the juice it changed consistency and seemed to seperate, but after beating 10 minutes it spread and piped beautifully. I'll try the cake recipe next time.

To be very honest, I didn't like this cake at all. The cake was heavy and the flavor wasn't enough to make up for it. The frosting was a lot of work and I expected something better.

Lots of work for an ok outcome. My cake was dry and thick, but the icing was great.

The icing has a wonderful flavor and texture. I made this cake for Mother's Day and opted for a different middle layer--dark chocolate orange cake. It was fabulous! Everyone loved the cake and especially the icing. I would make this cake again.

The icing for this cake is a keeper, but the cake itself did not impress me. Mine turned out sad and heavy, and only about 4 in. tall altogether! Not a very good presentation for my mother's 60th b-day! I had to bake another cake. The orange chiffon cake is wonderful!

I made this cake for a relative's birthday recently. I can't understand why anyone would like this cake. It was dry and tasted like baking powder. Very disappointing.....it ended up in the garbage.

This buttercream was the icing I have been looking for all my life. Sure it took an hour to make and made my wrist ache, I'm going to make it every time I make a cake. I'll omit the orange and add flavor to match, kaluah, chambord, powdered cocoa, what ever, my friends will think I'm a genuis. Cake is cake, this icing is transcendent.

The cake in this recipe was incredible!! I have always been a chocolate lover, but this cake hit the spot. I opten not to make the buttercream frosting and instead whipped up a lemon flavored cream cheese frosting. Delish!! Definetly will add to my list of "must make again" desserts.

My thanks to those who reviewed this recipe ahead of me. With your input, I had no problem at all with the frosting. I set the timer for 10 min. and left the room -- I also added a bit of food coloring to give it an orange look. I only had 9" cake pans (instead of 8"), so I took the cake out 10 min. early -- and that worked well. I made this for my husband's birthday and it was a big hit!

I was so glad to hear that my experience was similiar to others'! I made this for my sister's birthday and was so disappointed when I made the icing. Now that I know this, I will definately try it again because the cake was very delicious, nonetheless.

Exquisite cake and yes, the frosting does seem like a real disaster in the making but just set your timer and after 10 minutes it takes shape and is divine. I used a thin layer of orange curd between the layers--along with the frosting to give it a bit of color. I used orange muscat dessert wine (Essencia) in the icing and served it with the cake. A very pleased crowd indeed.

I made this cake for a b-day. The b-day girl loved it. If you enjoy lemony, orangey desserts, this one's for you. By the way, follow the icing instructions. I thought I had a mess, but it ended up turning out beautifully.
