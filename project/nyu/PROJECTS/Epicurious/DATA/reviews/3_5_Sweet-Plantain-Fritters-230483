Wow! I've made many other plantain recipes but these are, by far, the best! I omitted the sugar roll after frying and they were still sweet and delicious. Another dish to eat straight out of the pan!

Oh man, these are absolute heaven. The only way they could be better is if there was some kind of dipping sauce (caramel? chocolate?).

I thought it was GREAT. I added a tablespoon of freshly grated ginger which gave them a little bit of a kick.

Delicious! My roommate and I loved these. Definitely best if you can serve them right away, though.

I made this on a whim at a dinner party. It was a hit! I had dreams about it for days afterward. I thought about it during the day at work. My production level went down for a couple days. It's heaven wrapped in fried dough sprinkled with sugar.

Unless you have plantains that you have to use up it is not worth it. The batter fried WIHOUT the fruit is actually better.

This dish is similar to a Cuban one my mother made for me as a child. I like the addition of the cinimon and sugar...I will make it again.

I don't particularly like ripe plantains. I'd repeat it using what we call in Venezuela "Pinton" (Yello but firm - almost ripe) Plantains. FYI My wife and daughters LOVE! this recipe as published.

Very good and easy to prepare... This snack is called "maruya" in the Philippines.
