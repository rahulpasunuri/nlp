Cake had nice flavors. The frosting was awful. I cut the sugar to 2 cups based on the other reviewer's suggestion and it was still TOOOOO SWEET.

Ill probably make thsi again to try a change. I actually didn't care for hte frosting. The cake was super moist, not a bit dry. I made for a party of 8 and everyone really like it. The brittle was awesome and really pretty. I only put on the top, since you could break a tooth if you bit down and didn't see it in the middle. the presentation was gorgeous. I think there is too much butter in the frosting. I did limit it to 3 1/2 cups powder sugar put in fridge to let firm up and re-whip. texture was fine, but taste was like eatting butter. next time I'll just do a 1/2 cup

The frosting and brittle were excellent, but the cake was somewhat dry and the almond extract overpowering.

Made this for a discriminating party of 12 and not a crumb was left over. I see some reviewers found the icing too sweet. Hint: Use no more than 4 cups of the confectioner's sugar (the recipe calls for as much as 6). If you keep beating the icing, it should firm up after using between 3 1/2 to 4 cups of the sugar. The crunchy brittle is a great texture contrast to the cake. A big hit!

This cake has a real wow factor and an interesting combination of flavors. It was a big hit with everyone. I had no problem making the pecan brittle - nailed it on my 1st attempt. Just watch when the sugar starts to change color because it cooks very quickly from that point on. Take it off the heat a little before it gets deep amber because it continues to cook when off the heat. I followed the advice of other reviews and reduced the amount of icing sugar in the frosting to 4 1/2 cups. I also added a fair bit of vanilla to give it more flavor. I didn't find the cake dry - just crumbly. Next time I might follow the cake mix directions on the box (leave out the sour cream and extra egg) and just add the grated chocolate. The texture might be better.

I have made this recipe 4 times now and still get requests to make it again. I have one friend who will only let me make this cake for him. It was a big, big hit. The frosting is great and the brittle adds a fantastic touch. It does take more time and is still very much worth it.

This was one of the worst cakes I have ever made. The presentation was beautiful and the pecan brittle is a good idea, but the cake was artificial-tasting and dry and the frosting was quite simply, repulsive.

I loved this cake. I agree that it took some time to make it but it was well worth it. I loved the frosting. The presentation was wonderful. It was so good that my dog decided to lick half the frosting off while I wasn't looking (we just threw out that part). I would absolutely make this one again.

this cake was amazing. the use of a packaged mix saves a lot of time, but it looked very special anyway because of the pecan brittle (which was VERY easy to make, no annoying candy thermometer.) i broke the brittle into smaller pieces than the recipe suggested since it was so crunchy. i forgot to put the whipping cream in the frosting and it was STILL good. yum!

We enjoyed the cake. The cake itself was a little dry, but the frosting was so delicious that it didn't matter. I only used about 4 1/2 cups of the powdered sugar, so the frosting didn't become overly sweet. Like some of the other reviewers, I found that the pecan brittle cooked very quickly in well under the recommended 9 minutes.

I've made this recipe twice and it was a big hit both times. The icing is a bit sweet, but everyone loved it.

I was extremely disappointed in this recipe. For the first time, I didn't check the rating before I put the time and effort into making the cake. "Compressed sawdust layered with sweetened cement" would have been a more apt title. But on a positive note, this is the first disaster I've had since Bon Appetit has been in existence; I love the magazine.

I am in love with this cake. I make labor-intensive cakes quite often, and this is a vacation for me. It is so simple, and the presentation is dramatic. I do think it is key to BEAT, BEAT, BEAT that buttercream before and after the caramel addition. You don't have to add as much powdered sugar as a result. I have a professional KitchenAid, and I still beat FOREVER! It is worth it, though. The results-BRAVO!

This recipe was a hit with company - they were amazed that I made the pecan brittle, which actually was very easy the third time! Watch this and don't let it go anywhere near nine minutes - I burned it twice before having success. I didn't use the frosting, given the reviews, but a whipped topping/vanilla pudding blend I found on another site, and it was very good. The cake was a little dry, but since I served it with vanilla ice cream, it didn't matter.

I thought this was so time consuming. Maybe I shouldn't have tried to tackle this while making the short ribs at the same time. It was very good (yes the icing was very swee) and I did like it, but I've made desserts that were just as good with less effort.

I was very hesitant about making this cake after reading the various negative reviews. However, I am so glad I did because it turned out delicious. My guests loved it and couldn't praise it enough. The pecan brittle was such a surprise filling which you don't find in cakes very often. The only advise I listened to was regarding the frosting. I only used 4 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and it was perfect, sweet but not too sweet. It's definately one of the best cakes I ever made and I can't wait to make it again.

I agree, the icing is way to sweet!!! I would also make again with a whipped cream frosting. BA Dec 01 Cinnamon-spiced Caramel Cake frosting is nice.

I made this cake for a birthday party and not a crumb left. Very good and I will use this recipe again!

I love this cake! I've made it twice - both times were for parties. It's received rave reviews from the party-goers and I end up with a clean plate at the end of the evening. I'm making it again this weekend for guests.

I made some substitutions that made this cake yummy! I substituted 1/4 t. of baking soda for the cream of tartar because it made the taste less tinny. I also substituted macadamia nuts in the brittle and milk for the cream in the frosting! All the teachers at work loved it!

I would make the cake again - but not the frosting or brittle. The cake was really good. But like everyone else has said the frosting is way too sweet!!!

I tried this recipe as I am always looking to add something different to things I make for friends. I was very disappointed in this recipe. The frosting was way to sweet. I had my wife take it to work to get rid of it. I will try the cake part again but without the brittle and instead of your icing I will try a whip cream variant.

My son in law made this cake first - told me about it. It is wonderful! Of course it is sweet - you can't eat the whole thing (lol). A wonderful cake for company!

For such a beautiful looking cake and sounded great we were all very disappointed. The icing was too sweet and the cake was very disappointing. The only way I would make it again would be for a centerpiece only with a sign "DO NOT EAT".

The recipe sounded wonderful but was disappointing. The frosting overpowered the cake.

As I was preparing this recipe, it seemed as if I was headed for disaster. I almost burned the pecan brittle, and the texture of the frosting was all wrong and it tasted horrible. But after tasting the finished product, I was pleasantly surprised. I brought this cake to a dinner party and the guests seemed put off by the shards of pecan brittle. I will not make this again.

The pecan brittle was quite easy to make and delicious. It looked very impressive on top of the cake and I would definitely make that again. The cake was quite good - but the general comment from everyone who had some was that the icing was just a little too sweet.
