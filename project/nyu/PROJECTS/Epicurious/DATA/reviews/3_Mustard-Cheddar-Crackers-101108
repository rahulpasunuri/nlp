These are terrific. My wretched kids who will not eat mustard, gobbled them. The seeds add a lot. Just like any other cheese straws I've ever made, they are very tender and brittle. I give frozen logs of these as gifts rather than the finished product.

I made this for a halloween party along with 3 other types of crackers and thses were the first to go. This is an easy recipe to double for a good sized crowd. I decided to omit the mustard seeds as well, and I'm glad i did because the mustard flavour is already very pronounced without them.

The crackers tasted great. I coated the outside of the logs with cracked pepper and left out the mustard seeds. Unfortunatly they were too delicate and crumbled too easily. I tried under/ over baking and slicing thin and thick and nothing did the trick. Any hints anyone?

The crackers themselves were good. They reminded me of the cheesestraws my dad makes. I really didn't like the mustard seeds, though. The taste of the seeds was overwhelming, the textrue was a little disconcerting. If I made these crackers again, I might add poppy seeds if I felt the crackers needed some color. Otherwise, I'd make them without any seeds at all.
