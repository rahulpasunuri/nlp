A medium-dry sherry is almost identical to real Shaozing and better than the Shaozing sold in most Chinese grocery stores, which is loaded with salt.

I live in the country, with limited access to gourmet or exotic ingredients. Would like to try this, though. Can anyone suggest an acceptable substitute for Shaozing wine? Also, what ingredient makes the pork red around the edges, like it comes from the Chinese restaurants?
