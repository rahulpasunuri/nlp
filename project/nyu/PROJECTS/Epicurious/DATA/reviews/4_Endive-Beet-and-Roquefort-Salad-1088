Also cut the oil to under 1/2 cup. Had an avocado that needed to be used and it added to the salad. Thought it would also be great to add some toasted nuts next time. Keeper and nice salad rotation.

I thought this was very good, as did our guests. And it's a beautiful presentation. But I did think that 3/4 cup olive oil was waaaay too excessive. I reduced it to 1/2 cup and also added more lemon juice than called for. The extra lemon juice added a nice freshness and helped cut the oil. Will make again.

This is a great salad. My husband can take or leave beets but he really hates goat cheese, so this is the first salad with beets I've made where he actually had seconds. Delicious!

We made this salad and ate it for four nights straight. It keeps very well & was delicious. We added toasted & salted pepitas for a little crunch.

Great dressing. I used a mix of golden and red beets and the presentation was very nice.
