I love this side dish, have been making it for years. A really refreshing way to lighten up your mashed potatoes. I usually also use the time saving method of peeling the potatoes before boiling, and peel off half of the zucchini skins in stripes. However, it really does come out better if you take the time to boil the potatoes in their skins.

This was great. I peeled the zucchini to help it blend. I also added garlic, cracked pepper, and freshly grated parmesan for extra flavor.

We took this dish to a friend's for dinner and it was a hit for everyone. Excellent! I also added Beau Monde and a dash of "DASH" for more flavor.

Great use of excess zucchini. I've found that a time saving short cut is to peel and large-dice the potatoes before boiling them.

At zucchini glut time I could hardly believe that I found a recipe for which I had ALL the ingredients (lemon thyme makes a great ground cover!)- have now made it twice and we really like it. Tonight it went really well with meat loaf!

Easy to make and the a great way to use all the fresh zucchini from the garden. I could not find fresh lemon thyme, so I used the fresh thyme that was available. I certainly will make it again.

This dish is a tasty and healthful alternative to traditional mashed potatoes, since the addition of zucchini eliminated the cream and cut down on the butter. A hit with all of my dinner party guests!
