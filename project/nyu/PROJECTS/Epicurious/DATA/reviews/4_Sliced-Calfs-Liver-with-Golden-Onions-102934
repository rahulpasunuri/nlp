As a foodie, I can't believe it has taken me this long to try to cook liver. My Mom made it the old fashioned way with onions and gravy - but my experiment came out way better! I sauteed thinly sliced brussel sprouts AND onions together in unsalted butter. Then added a gourmet mix of mushroons. for more umami, I added a few squirts of Braggs Aminos for salt. After abut 10-15 mins, i added the slices of liver. As it cooked, the mix of juices released from the liver thickened and I added a few splashes of white wine from my glass. Another 5 minutes and I was sitting down to the most amazing dinner. I must say I paid a but more for grass-fed,free range beef liver. Perhaps thats why the flavor was more 'shroomy and oniony and not so livery. YUM!!!

This is really, really good. I haven't had beef liver in years and made this for my 80+ year old parents one night. What a great trip down culinary Memory Lane!! Deglazed the pan with white wine as well and served with roasted new potatoes. Yum - a "must" for any liver lover!!

My local butcher (Leeds Market) has a series of amazing deals on 'Meat Bags'. The £5 bag is made up of chicken legs, beef mince, steak, ribs and ... calves liver. I, like many, have horrible childhood memories of being called in from playing to eat smelly, tough and unpalatable liver (sorry mum). I was then vegetarian for 10 years (no relation - I think). Coming out of the other side I have 2 experiences of liver in its non-pate form. First, from my partner's Indian father who cooks lamb liver in a beautiful and delicate way (need to get this recipe), which did wonders to expel my prejudice against this cut of meat. This lead to the second experience, my first attempt at cooking liver. As a student the price of liver appealed to my pocket moths. I attempted to recreate my father in law's dish - it ended in utter failure. So, I had mixed feelings about reentering the world of offal. I used this recipe and it was a great success. Although, I still prefer other cuts of meat, the textures and flavours of this dish were delightful and enjoyed by my partner (against the culinary competition against his father) and myself. I deglazed with red wine to great success, I also simply added the liver to the cooked onions, without the two step process. I served with green beans mixed with bacon and rosemary foccacia and served with red wine. Tasty, I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I sometimes get a craving for old-fashioned liver and onions, and this fits the bill. I serve over rice...but mashed potatoes would also be good. Comfort food all the way!

Excellent! I also deglaze with wine and you must serve it with mashed potatoes!!!

I made this recipe as sort of a theme dish, mostly as a joke. We were watching the movie 'Hannibal' and I made it, because of Lecter's comment in Silence that he 'Ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti'. Som I served this with some fava beans and a nice chianti, and it was simply incredible. I also substituted a dry white wine instead of water.

Ths was very good and easy to make. I served with a rice pilaf. It made an unusual Sunday night supper but we really enjoyed it. It only took about 25 minutes to make.

I agree about the white wine to deglaze.

This recipe is actually an old time favorite revisited. My children loved it. Because the liver is so thin and quickly cooked, it is very tender and not overwhelming for young palates. Enjoy!

Fabulous receipe. One of our favorites. For a better taste, you can replace water by dry white wine.
