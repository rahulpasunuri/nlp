A nice side, very good. I used heirloom tomatoes and didn't use wood chips. It's pretty hard to turn the tomatoes because they get mushy fast. The aioli goes nicely with the tomatoes.

I think this is one of the most delicious things I've ever made.. I'm really surprised at the marginal review by Annapolis cook. It's rich, almost too rich to eat with something like steak because it tastes like steak to me. It's just fabulous.. surely better on really good tomatoes but the aioli is so good I think it would be good on about anything.

I thought this was a bit bland. I love the idea of grilling tomatoes, but I think I would marinate them first. Also, the aioli wasn't special...

This is absolutely delicious. It's quick & specially great with home grown tomatoes.
