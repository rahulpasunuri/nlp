Delicious dipped in chocolate. Will try forming large ones over the back of a bowl diping in chocolate and using as bowls for ice cream.

These came together easily and I didn't have any trouble removing them from the Silpat. I just can't decide how I would serve them. Probably as a garnish with a saucy chicken dish. They might even be good dipped in some chocolate and served with ice cream. I'd be curious to hear from others how you would serve them.
