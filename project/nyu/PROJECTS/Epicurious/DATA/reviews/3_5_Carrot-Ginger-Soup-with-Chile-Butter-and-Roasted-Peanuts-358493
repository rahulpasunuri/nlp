The butter makes the soup.

This is fabulous - I ignored the potato, since I couldn't figure out what it would contribute, so reduced the broth to 4 cups so it wouldn't be too thin. Terrific. I didn't feel like bothering with chili butter (who needs more fat?) so I put a dab of unflavored low fat yoghurt on top with some corn nuts and - WOW!

I doubled the recipe for a dinner party, and used 9c chicken broth and about 1c heavy whipping cream. Yes, I know that defeats the purpose of low fat, but it sure does make a great soup. It's still good (but only good) without the cream. I agree with the others who say that the butter with scallions and the peanuts make it special. I used only the amount of ginger called for, and unlike other reviewers, I thought that was more than plenty. The soup had a bit more bite to it than I'd prefer (and I do like ginger). With the cream, I'll definitely make this again.

I made a quadruple batch of this for a soup contest at work and won first place! The only changes I made were I roasted about half the carrots at 375 until soft enough to blend and I added a smidge of nutmeg. Also, I strain all my blended soups to make finer texture. If you dont mind a chunkier texture, use an immersion blender for ease, it worked well for the initial blending, I made it two nights ahead and wanted the flavors to meld, then I re-blended when cold. I have to say the Chili butter makes it, though! Its good without, but the butter pushes it over the top. People kept commenting on it, dont make it without, its SUPER easy! After I mixed the butter I squeezed it through my pastry bag to make the butter into cute little dollops. Big hit, easy to make and so good for you!

I really enjoy this soup, it's the first carrot soup I've ever tried to make. Honestly, though, I wouldn't bother with the chili butter. I added a bit of cayenne to spice it up and I think it would be much better with some plain greek yoghurt stirred in instead of the butter. The peanuts were good, though, and also I upped the ginger too and was glad I did.

Amazing! I used a sweet potato and added cilantro and soy milk. The chile butter really adds a great touch.

We will be making this again. Skipped topping with the peanuts and used gr onion and butter in the butter. Husband like the texture and flavor. Made a batch with sweet potatoes that was even better later that evening as we used it for a little late night snack. The sitting gave the soup time to develop deeper smoother flavors.

Easy to make, but it turned out a bit bland, so i added some honey (about 2 tablespoons), for sweetness, and pureed the soup with about 1 cup of milk and 2 tabs of butter. Peanuts add a nice touch! I think i'll make this again, but add more ginger than required and see how it goes.

I made this soup on the note that it was going to be my own variation. It turned out more like a chunky stew which was my intention. I did add quite a bit of chili powder and curry powder for my own taste; I would almost recommend it this way and double the ginger amount. As for the butter, I would omit and just use the green onions and chili. Other than that I found it very pleasant and filling (I'm still full).

i have a question...why is it chile butter? i would have thought chile powder or cumin etc. i use yogurt instead of butter garnish which adds some acidity in contrast to the sweetness of the carrots. i will not fork rate as i haven't made this exact recipe just a similar ginger- carrot soup sans nuts.

I was very excited to try this soup based on all of the amazing reviews but I really can't say that it was anything more than just "okay". I've had much better carrot soups than this. The roasted peanuts and the chile butter were nice touches, but it still seemed to be missing something. It wasn't awful, just very forgettable.

Amazing! Because a dinner guest had allergies, I omitted the peanuts from half the batch and both versions were delicious! It refrigerated very well for a few days.

Delicious soup! I simmered the vegetables (covered) for a little over an hour-- it took that long to soften the carrots. I also used 1 cup less broth and did not think the soup needed to be thinned at all. The chile butter is outstanding. It adds a really nice flavor and creaminess as it melts into the soup.

Very good! My husband is not a big fan of cooked carrots, but he loved this soup.

Delicious! I made it with farmer's market carrots, bought the same day. Upped the ginger a tad, which filled the house with a lovely aroma. I used a very high-quality butter for the topping, which I don't believe added a ton of flavor or texture. Agree with the other reviewers that yogurt would do just as well, since part of the effect is visual. But be sure to include the green onions and peppers. It would be just as good without peanuts, for those with allergies.

This soup was tasty and easy to prepare. I was making it in a bit of a hurry, so the texture might have been improved if I had simmered it a bit longer. This had a nice clean flavor. The butter was fine, but I might have preferred a swirl of flavored oil or yogurt instead--the butter wasn't really as flavorful as I was hoping for. Will experiment with this recipe and definitely make again.

This soup is excellent. I am always looking for healthy, veggie recipes that are bursting with flavor and now I have added this to my permanent recipe rotation. For my personal taste, I upped the ginger a bit, and added a few more dashes of cayenne pepper. Instead of making the butter garnish, I used 2% Greek yogurt that is still very thick. I added cayenne and green onion to the yogurt and it was perfect.
