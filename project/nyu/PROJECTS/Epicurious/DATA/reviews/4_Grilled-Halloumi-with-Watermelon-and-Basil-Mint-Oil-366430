This was one of the best recipes I have made in a long time. The basil mint oil ties all the flavors together. I have been dreaming about this since I last made it!

I was just reminded of this recipe - made it a few times last summer. Wonderful! Going to take to summer bbq on Saturday - we're responsible for apps ...

I cannot actually review this recipe yet, I have just finished making the oil, and dinner is 5 hours and 40 miles away. My note is about the ever popular expression: "Do the math!" The math here clearly is delving into areas which when I was in school (old math) were called imaginary number; things such as the square root of minus one. It purports to be a recipe serving four people and when you see that the brick of cheese is sliced into eight pieces there is no cognitive dissonance, that is, until you arrive at the six (count them, yes six) triangles of watermelon. How does that work? Well a careful examination of the provided art work offers little or no help, as the photograph shows six pieces of cheese piled upon five triangles of watermelon with one triangle supporting a pair of cheese. Is this recipe to the base seven or is calculus required to make it come out.

This salad was delicious, great flavour combination and the basil/mint oil was superb. We used raclette instead of halloumi which turned out to be a great substitute.

Perfect for a hot summer night.... I used grape tomatoes and put them in a grill pan instead of directly onto the grill.

My husband and I tried this recipe with some trepidation and loved it! We grilled the watermelon as well until it had grill marks and was warm through. We sliced the cheese to between 1/8 and 1/4 inch. The tastes were completely unexpected and delicious. My husband doesn't really care for watermelon or tomatoes but loved this.
