I have been making this pie since it came out in 1991. I can't attend my sister-in-law's birthday party without it. It is wonderful. I follow the recipe exactly, but I have always used the Nellie & Joe's key lime juice that is available at most grocery stores. I also use the grated lime peel. It is definitely a family favorite. Enjoy!

This heavy pie has a lovely flavor, just be careful not to over-toast the nuts, as that can make the crust a bit burnt-tasting. I found that ten regular limes supplied this amount of juice and a little more which I used to finish the tortilla soup recipie found here. All in all, it makes a nice cooling end to a spicy dinner.

YUMMY!! I have to say that it takes exactly 29 key limes to make this delicious dessert. It is so good and easy- AND a crowd pleaser- if you have company that cannot tolerate eggs- check out a recipe called- Chilled Lime-Coconut Pie with Macadamia-Cocnut Crust- it is similar- sans oeufs

My husband is a key-lime pie lover who has ordered it about everywhere offered in the US, and he reports that this is the best he has ever eaten. I used regular limes from the tree in my yard and they were fresh squeezed just before going into the pie. I also like the idea that the eggs are cooked so as not to worry about salmonella.
