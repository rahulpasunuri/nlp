This is a wonderful soup and one of my family's favorites. In addition to it being kosher, it also serves well for the lactose intolerant. I was surprised by the stringiness comments as I was taught to always snap off the ends of the asparagus spears. My son, the chef, might peel the asparagus, but I just snap off the ends.

I agree with the other reviewers that suggested you let this sit. I made it first thing in the morning and then reheated (gently) for dinner. I think the nuts are really not necessary and kind of take away from the individual crunch of the asparagus tips. I had no parsley, so I substituted some wilted tarragon that was going to be pitched if not used. I thought it a bit risky to combine the medicinal flavors of the saffron and tarragon, but they worked. Also, I pureed the veggies, then I worked them through my food mill and was able to eliminate quite a bit of stringy stuff. This is such a pretty soup, and since it's a "cream" soup without any cream - not a bad addition to any light summer meal. I'll definitely make it again!

This is a great recipe for entertaining. It's delicious, can be made in advance and rather easy. I agree that you need to peel the asparagus or at least break off the ends. I broke off the ends and simmered them in the broth to give it an even richer asparagus flavor. Strain the broth and continue with the recipe as written.

Fortunately, I read Brooklyn's comments and made this a day ahead. It was delicious and I didn't panic when it tasted only so-so on the first day!

I followed the recipe exactly, the night before I needed it, and was not impressed with the flavor at all. However, after chilling overnight (uncovered at first, as another reader gad suggested, so it didn't lose color), it mellowed nicely for Easter brunch. All the guests liked it. (I also snapped the ends and had no stringiness.)

This is a delicious dish which tastes like fresh asparagus and has a great texture.By snapping off the fibrous stems of the stalks before cooking we avoided all the "stringy mess" issues. We added the touch of cream and the three condiments which made a beautiful presentation. The saffron flavor was not noticeable. Given the number of steps involved I don't think I'll make it very often.

I made this for my "unculinary inclined" Mum and she practically fell out of her chair! She asked for the recipe after one slurp to send to all her friends. I didn't have saffron so I used a tad of curry pwd and fresh lemon juice.. I also added 1/2 a leek and used baby red potatoes instead.. to die for!

i've made this soup several times & it's one of my favorites, aside from the fact that it uses up all the pots and pans i own. well worth it, though.

Wow! Someone from Rome tried it?! That inspires me to give it a whirl--I will next week for my husband's birthday.

I haven't made this recipe yet, however, I have an idea about what might be contributing to stringiness in some cases. The directions say to trim the asparagus. I do this by bending each stalk until it snaps in two and then discarding the fiberous end. You lose about one third of the asparagus, but you get rid of the really fiberous part.

La rifarei ma con qualche variazione, sono italiana e amo i sapori ben armonici.

I've made this soup several times and have always gotten raves from guests. Other reviewers mention stringiness as a problem. I have found that young, very tender asparagus produce a fine result right in an upright Hamilton Beach blender. Other tougher stalks require a turn through the food mill. -- Either way, the end result is superb. The soup can be made a day in advance, leave it uncovered in your fridge until cold to protect the color. Flavor suffers after more than a day.

Soup was great & everyone loved it! Will make again.

I'd make it again, BUT I would peel the asparagus (or maybe use a food mill as the last reviewer suggested). After using an immersion blender AND a food processor, the soup was still unbearably stringy. Finally I pressed it through the large holes of a colander with a spatula and that removed the numerous strings. Delicious flavor though.

Although it was good - it wasn't great. I felt it missed cream - so for presentation I swirled heavy cream on the top (which looked quite nice, actually). Also, I first put the soup through a food mill and then a food processor as I felt it would be too string otherwise. Judging by the fibre in the food mill I'm glad I did and the texture was excellent.

I had a craving for asparagus, and made this soup for a dinner party. The thick, velvety green soup sprinkled with pistachios and parsley made a lovely presentation, and my guests raved about it. Asparagus never tasted so good. I will definitely make this again.

THIS SOUP IS SO ELEGANT AND DELICICOUS THAT I MADE IT SEVERAL TIMES LAST YEAR DURING ASPARAGUS SEASON. THE SOUP GARNERS RAVE REVIEWS AND IS SIMPLE TO PREPARE.

I made this recipe last year for the first time. It was part of a recipe listing of Italian Passover dishes. We had a number of guests for a Passover seder and we served this dish as a first course instead of traditional matzoh ball and chicken soup. From the moment the first spoonfuls hit everyone's palates, the raves started coming. One guest said he would expect something like this soup to be served in a five star gourmet restaurant. Others could not believe how delightfully tasty and elegant the dish was. Although, there is no milk or cream in the recipe (I even used unsalted parve (non-dairy)margirine), the potato when pureed in the blender, provides a silky smooth, creamy texture. This recipe is a perfect alternative to a traditional Passover soup that is not only eye-appealing, but delicious as well.
