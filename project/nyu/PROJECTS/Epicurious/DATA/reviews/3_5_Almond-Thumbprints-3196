These are pretty good. They were very crumbly, but nice, like sandies. I used 5 oz of almond meal instead of grinding my own almonds, so maybe that is why. I made them 1 1/4 inch, so they ended up huge; if I did it again I might make them a bit less than an inch. They were a bit of a pain, so 3 forks.

I kept this recipe for some reason, I should have thrown it away a while ago. This morning, I tried it again, not remembering the last time I made these cookies. Overall, they were a disappointment for sure. They baked flat and spread out. I didn't like the fact that you had to imprint them, and then dig it out again after the first bake-which was another annoyance: doing more than one timely baking per batch. They also didn't hold as much filling as other thumbprint recipes do. For these reasons, I'm tossing the recipe-gave it at least two shots. There are better thumbprint recipes out there for sure.

Loved these! If you're worried about dryness, throw a tablespoon of walnut or peanut oil in the mixer. I filled with Nutella - yeah! To scoop dough and to make indentations, I used a melon baller.

These were perfect! Just what I'd hoped for. Followed the recipe exactly, and the dough was soft and easy to work with (not crumbly), cookies did not spread but remained thick and tender (NOT at all like biscotti). Not sure why other reviewers had problems - this was easy and they came out just as described. It even made almost exactly the number of cookies indicated - I got 37 instead of 35. Perfect jam/almond combo - will definitely be making these many times in the future!

I tried them with hazelnuts instead of almonds and filled them with nutella for my chocoholic family. Great!

Will definitely make again. So much different than the usual chocolate chip fare, and so much prettier. I made these for my family with homemade plum jam from my neighbor, and they were wildly popular. I did not have crumbly dough problems like some reviewers did.

These turned out well. They are tender with a light texture and wonderful almond flavor. The one issue I had was that one of the jams I used overflowed from a few of my cookies. The jam I had touble with was Smuckers blackberry Simply Fruit. I put slightly less of it in each cookie in my second batch and the jam did not overflow. I also used apricot preserves which gave me no problem and the flavor of the apricot goes really well with the almond.

These cookies were rich, but very good.

This is an easy and delicious cookie. The dough molds easily when rolled into individual balls.Made these for Christmas with raspberry preserves for the filling & everyone loved them. I didn't have almond extract on hand so substituted imitation rum extract which seemed to add to the flavor. Will be making these again.

The dough was very hard to work with - it was extremely crumbly, even more so after refrigerating it as the recipe indicates, so, I added an additional whole egg and it made it a bit smoother. I got a lot of compliments on these cookies. They were delicate and had a nice flavour. I *may* make them again, however, I'm more likely to go back to my family's traditional favourite jam thumbprint recipe. The dough is easier, and they're rolled into egg whites then crushed walnuts rather than having the nuts inside the dough. They are a bit more delicious than these, but I'll still give this recipe 3 forks.

This is the best thumbprint cookie recipe I've tried. It's so easy -- I have used almonds and walnuts -- I've used different types of jelly for the centers as well as milk chocolate chips -- everyone in the family loves these cookies.

I can still remember my mom making a version of these, dipping her thimbled finger into a saucer of flour then making a dent with it in the little dough ball. She called these cookies, appropriately, "thimble cookies." However, hers didn't spread all over the place like mine always do from this recipe. I chill the dough, even re-chill the dented (raw)cookies on the cookie sheet - still they spread. Does anyone have any advice on this? I will keep making them anyway. They are just melt-in-the-mouth delicious!

Delish; very simple and fun to make; both raspberry and apricot are delicious and pretty fillers! The nicest thumbprint cookie I've come across in years!

I was dissapointed in this recipe. The cookies were hard, nothing like the crumbling, light thumbprints my mom made growing up. But if you like tough, bicotti-like cookies, you might like these.

Wonderful!!! The best cookies I've had in years. I definitely recommend these.

These are delicious - well worth the effort! I piped the jam out of a baggie with the corner cut out and found it to be clean and precise.
