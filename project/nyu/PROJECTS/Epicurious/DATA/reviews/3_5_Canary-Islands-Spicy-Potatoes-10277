This is a really scrumptious potato side dish or add some chicken and you have a light luncheon dish. It really has pizazz and will tantalize your taste buds!

Hi... I'm from Gran Canaria, Canary Islands...I'm sorry but those are not the typical canary "Papas arrugadas com mojo" You put too much vinegar or you need more oil, you choose...and the paprika ....preferably Hungarian??? I don't think so! sorry again! please try to ask someone before post the recipes...

Way to vinegary for my taste. I did find, however, that I preferred them cold, and finished them off that way - kinda like potato salad. They do have plenty of flavor, but overall, don't think they'll become part of the repitoire.

It was a hit! The recipe was delicious and shall be integrated into our culinary canon.

These are great! I've never been to the Canary Islands, but something about the spicey-vinegary flavour of these potatoes took me right back to the Carribean. We had them with the grilled chicken and gaspacho salsa recipe on this site... a really nice summer meal.

Something was a little off ... maybe too much vinegar? It was edible, but there are better spicy potato recipes out there. Thanks for the idea, though, Epicurious! We loved making these for a change.

I went to the Canary Islands, and this was by far the absolute best thing we ate! It is hard to find native fare there, as most the food is German. I have been searching for a recipe that properly captured the flavor of the Mojo sauce, and this has come closest. I still can't get the potatos "salted in their jackets" just right, but I am still working on it. This recipe should not be overlooked! YUM!
