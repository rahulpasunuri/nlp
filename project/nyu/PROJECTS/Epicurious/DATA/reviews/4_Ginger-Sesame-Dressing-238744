This is the dressing, along with a regular balsamic, that I mix up and keep in my fridge. I just guesstimate the ginger and throw that in the Cuisinart with the garlic, puree, add the other ingredients (minus the water), and there is a fantastic dressing we all love. I also double it and halve the honey though I keep the sesame oil the same. SO good!

This was definitely a tasty dressing, however it tasted more like balsamic vinegar than ginger or sesame. I really wanted those flavors, so I added around a tbsp more ginger and also more sesame oil to taste. To be fair, I eat a lot of ginger, and I was using Japanese sesame oil (what I had on hand) and it is weaker in flavor than other sesame oil. If I make it again, I might just use less balsamic since it does really overpower everything else.

This was super-easy to make. I did not add the water; I liked it just the way it was out of the blender. I put it on a thrown-together slaw of cabbage, mango, carrots, and red onion. If I had to change anything I might add a bit more soy and brown sugar to oomph up the flavor on strongly-flavored veggies, and make twice as much dressing (one recipe didn't quite work for an entire head of cabbage). But my husband and I both liked it a lot and the slaw got better the next day.

This was delish!! Does anybody know the fat or calorie content offhand, I hate the whole serving myself yikes! I love finding interesting ways to change up chicken and salads because they get so boring. This is a crowd favorite :)

Yum! Per the previous reviewer, i used a bit less sesame oil and about half the honey. We loved it!

Excellent sauce, first time i whipped this up i had used a bit more than a tsp of toasted sesame oil, the dressing was a bit overpowered. Every time after that i go just under a tsp sesame and throw honey in to taste. i use this stuff on salads, great dip for eggrolls, marinate chicken skewers; very versatile and delicious. its now my go-to dressing.
