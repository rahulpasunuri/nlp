i'm not a squash person, and i had hoped that this recipe might jazz up a butternut squash i had around. nope. i found it hopelessly bland -- and even after adding more crumbled bacon, juice of another lime, and more tobasco, the taste was still: spicy salty tanginess! -- instantly dulled by the sweet starchy mush of squash.but if you like the taste of squash, this might be a good recipe.

A wonderful unusual use for a vegetable that is normally prepared so blandly. This dish is quite tangy indeed, and it might easily overpower a milder main course so be cafeful what you serve it with. Should work with almost any squash variety.
