Thanks for all the modifications. I used buttermilk (from the powdered stuff), 1 c. whole wheat and 1.25 c. all purpose flours, one stick of butter. As whole wheat is drier, I added the juice of half a small meyer lemon. I baked them in a 10" diameter 2" deep cake pan. Before baking, I used a bench scraper to "cut" the wedges by indenting the dough. They were good but slightly undercooked perhaps. Would bake them for 20 min given that they were in one big pan. My boyfriend loved them. I prefer drier, more traditional scones but with blueberry jam these were awesome for a Sunday morning breakfast!

I used buttermilk instead of whipping cream because that's all I had, and it was DELICIOUS. Also, my food processor is broken so I cut the butter into tiny pieces by hand...about 1/4 inch cubes. It took a while, but I think it actually came out better this way. I just added the tiny pieces to the flour mixture in batches a little at a time as I was cutting, and stirred lightly to coat each time I added some. Then I made the well in the center and added my buttermilk. The texture and flavor are amazing. I followed the rest of the recipe except I added about two teaspoons of lemon peel because I love lemon so much, and also I sprinkled some sugar on top after brushing them with some buttermilk, right before putting them in the over. SO SO good. I would definitely make these again, the exact same way. Would be impressive for company.

I made these with only 7 Tablespoons of butter and they were great! I had made the other ginger scone recipe on this site and it was so heavy and oily, so I tried them both with 7 tablespoons of butter and extra ginger and they are very, very special.

This is a superb recipe. I alter it slightly as I like more lemon, but without the lemon and ginger, it is a perfect "basic" recipe to incorporate other flavors. I use almond extract and dried cherries, or dried blueberries. Do not use fresh or frozen fruit as the extra moisture will ruin the texture.

Made these today for a brunch I'm catering. They are lovely. I cut them into small rounds, sprinkled raw sugar on top before baking and a little tiny bit of chopped candied ginger. They are not too sweet/not too rich. Just perfect!

Just made these for a guy who wanted ginger scones...they passed the test.There is another ginger scone recipe on this site, claiming to be Nancy Silverton's from La Brea ...the only difference being 11 vs 12 tbsp butter and regular whipping cream vs heavy whipping cream. My favorite scone is the cranberry- orange scone on this site. Heaven. Mix with hands rather than cood processor. Larger lumps of butter make for a lighter more tender scone.

Perfect, as good as the one from my favorite store. The dough is surprisingly easy to work with, stays together. Use the same base to make chocolate scones , with 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and some vanilla. Next time I will try with orange flavor.

these scones are delicious. i used 10 tbsp. of butter and found that to be more than sufficient. next time, i would also use less sugar; i prefer more savory scones with sweet highlights, provided in this case by the ginger. as it is, the recipe yields scones that are better suited for dessert than breakfast. also, using a bit more lemon peel and 1/2 tsp. ground ginger adds a lot of depth and a little spicyness. if you prefer orange to lemon or just want to try a variation, substituting orange peel and a little orange flower water gives fantasatic results.

These are probably my favorite scones, although I use milk instead of whipping cream to cut down on the richness. They've been a favorite at my church's annual Christmas Tea for several years now.

These scones always get rave reviews! I have given out this recipe every time I make them for someone new. It should have 5 forks.

These scones are indeed delightful. I also balked at the quantity of butter, and instead used 8 tablespoons, and even then they are very rich. The lemon zest is very nice, I think next time I may use more.

These are remarkable. I wanted to find a ginger scone recipe after getting wonderful ginger-apricot scones at a farmer's market. These lived up to my hopes and surpised my family with just how good they were. There have been a few requests for more!

My cooking sense is not unlike my fashion sense: scary. Feeling under the weather, I thought I had every ingredient for this marvelous dish. My Trader Joe's Crystallized Ginger was 5 years old and I had no cream, only Vitamite (non-dairy drink). So I improvised and found out a couple of things. Grating the lemon rind left a lot on the grater and very little in with the flour. I ran some hot-for-tea water over the grater to clear the rind into a cup and added the very dry diced ginger to the lemon rind water, mixing every so often. I measured too much Vitamite and came up with a sticky dough, so kneaded it in the bowl and dropped handsful of dough onto my lightly buttered silpat atop the jelly roll pan. I shaped the two rounds as well as I could then brushed with left over Vitamite. The misshapen scones were spiky from where the dough stuck. Insight one: with cleaned hands, I smoothed and shaped the rounds which no longer stuck after being brushed with Vitamite! After being in the oven for two minutes I realized I had not cut the scones (duh). Insight two: I popped them out, cut the slushy puffing cakes and separated slices very slightly, which was enough to allow them to cook through in the allotted time + 3 minutes for the extra Vitamite and hot lemon water I added. Still light, flavorful, crunchy brown and needed no additional butter for our tastes! So you fellow inept or distracted cooks, take heart! This recipe is a truly delicious and resilient!

These are outstanding, but like other reviewers, I cringe at the quantity of butter. As a result, I have baked them with one stick of butter (8oz instead of 11 oz) and they were still great, but didn't leave greasy prints on my napkin.

I would make a significant adjustment in the amount of butter -- there's just way too much. They taste fine, but they're really quite greasy. You could easily reduce the amount of butter by 1/3. Mine were also a little flat. I also cooked them about 5 minutes longer (I checked my oven temp, and it was right on target), as they were a bit underdone initially.

I agree with Chicago. I baked them in the center of a preheated oven for over 30 minutes. Eventually they browned, but it took almost twice the time specified. That said, the texture and flavor were great and my guests agreed they were worth the wait.

A bakery near me makes the most fabulous raspberry ginger scones, and I wanted to try my hand at copying them. I used this recipe and added half a cup of raspberries (frozen - all I could find) -- PERFECT! I also added a light lemon icing to a few of them, which was a nice touch. This recipe is definitely a keeper! (Although I may try someone else's suggestion of using less butter next time. Tastewise, I like the butter, but calorie-wise, it kills me to even think about!)

This turned good and my husband liked them a lot. the ginger (got at trader joes) mellowed when cooked.

These were excellent scones. Please note that my guests would all give it 4 forks, but I thought they were a bit rich for the highest rating. (I did use heavy whipping cream though, not just heavy cream or whipping cream). I also baked them the night before and reheated them the next morning as suggested. There was no difference in taste or texture. I will definitely add these to my breakfast repetoire (also try the Chocolate Chip and Dried Cherry Heart Shaped Scones - Bon Appetit).

What did I do wrong? I baked for the stated time at 400 in the center of the oven on a baking sheet with no side edges. Clearly not done. Baked for an additional 6 minutes and still came out very underdone in the center. Also, they look lop-sided. Any suggestions? Thanks

One word: incredible! Used zest of one, whole lemon; and, without a food processor, used more hand power.

Delicious & different! Have made them twice, first using a bottle of McCormick's candied ginger,chopped up, which is less than the recipe calls for. The second time I used the Kame candied ginger, a little stronger. We preferred the McCormick's, even though it is more expensive.We will have these often!

Lovely scone recipe. The addition of ginger to this light, buttery scone is heavenly. Before baking, I sprinkle the top with granulated raw sugar. By the way, I note that Nancy Silverton uses heavy cream in the version in her cook book.

So very, very good. A ginger fanatic, I've tried another recipe for ginger scones; it was not nearly as good. I think a lot has to do with the quality of the ginger, too: this time I got a great bag of baby ginger from Trader Joe's - it has the most wonderful soft texture. The only thing is I missed the presence of salt a little bit - probably just a personal preference.

These scones are the best. I mix the butter and dry ingredients in my food processor. I don't use quite as much ginger, but put it through the food processor for a couple of pulses. It is very quick and easy this way. I also use half&half instead of cream with great results.

Absolutely yummy. Best while still warm. I used a more generous amount of lemon peel. I have had many requests for the recipe. I brought them to a brunch yesterday and the plate was empty in minutes.

A very simple, yet unique scone that has sweet as well as spicy nuances. I did use 1% lowfat milk, and it still came out with a great texture - flaky and still moist. I will definately make it again.

Very tasty. I used semiskimmed milk instead of the whipping cream because I didn't have any in the refrigerator. Nice and crisp outside and tender crumb inside. Six (including myself) thought the recipe excellent and it's definitely on the repeat list.

These are the best scones I've ever tasted! Be sure you like ginger, as the flavor is intense. I made a batch of these for Sunday breakfast, and they didn't last long. Most scones tend to be dry and crumbly; these are very moist and not too sweet. A very definite keeper. I'll try the same base recipe with other additions, too.

I was eager to make this interesting scone, but was disappointed. Too dry and fell apart too easily when handling the finished product. Also found when I followed the recipe exactly, the dough was still too dry and had to add more cream in order for it to hold together. Not a keeper.
