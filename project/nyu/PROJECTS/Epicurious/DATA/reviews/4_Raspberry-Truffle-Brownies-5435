Delicious! I did alter it a bit after recommendations from other users I used brandy and reduced the sugar I also made a colis from fresh raspberries and added that to replace the jam. SUCH A DIFFERENCE. Sliced. Dusted with powdered sugar served with chantilly cream and fresh raspberry colis brushed on the plate. Adding this to my recipe binder. 4 forks for sure!

I have made this recipe (exactly as written) so many times over the years and it never lets me down. Perfect thing to bring to any potluck...fancy enough for an upscale dinner, casual enough for a low key picnic. If you can, do microwave a slice for ten seconds or so...you won't be sorry.

As the recipe stands, I don't believe it's a showstopper. I wanted to make my bf an amazing brownie for his Bday and I thought this would be it. I felt like the raspberry flavoring was lost, and every person that tried it didn't realize there even was raspberry in it until I told them. I also feel the cooking time is too long, my brownie came out too baked for my taste and i took it out even 5 minutes before.

These were wonderful brownies, so moist and chocolately! As advised, I used one cup of sugar instead of two. I also added 1 1/2 tsp of almond essence and used mixed dark and milk chocolate (chopped) instead of choc chips.I topped the mixture with fresh raspberries before baking which added a wonderful tart edge.

FANTASTIC! A real crowd pleaser! I used 9-inch cake pan greased, lined with parchment paper, then greased again. I cut them into whatever shape I wanted and served them as bite-sized desserts on buffet. Nice, sturdy brownies that hold up well. Use quality ingredients for best results!

NOTES FROM LOGAN UTAH-why they took them out...glad I saved them! 2 cups all purpose flour 2 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger 2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground cloves 3/4 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup chopped crystallized ginger 1 cup (packed) dark brown sugar 1/2 cup vegetable shortening, room temperature 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature 1 large egg 1/4 cup mild-flavored (light) molasses Sugar Nonstick vegetable oil spray 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate, chopped 3 large eggs 2 cups sugar 1/3 cup raspberry jam 3 tablespoons black raspberry liqueur (such as Chambord) or other berry liqueur 1 cup all purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips Powdered sugar Modifications: reduce sugar to 1¼ cups as suggested by another reviewer; replace jam with 1C dried cranberries soaked in 6T Chambord (for a week!  most of the Chambord was soaked up and we did not drain them); 2T additional Chambord instead of 3T; replace semi-sweet chips with small-chopped bittersweet chocolate. Bake at 350 for 30 minutes (test for doneness) in a 9x13 metal pan lined with foil and coated with cake release or cooking spray (also used baking strips around the pan for even baking). Cool completely in the pan then lift out the brownie, remove foil, wrap tightly and chill overnight or until very cold. Cut into heart shapes and drizzle with bittersweet Chambord glaze (we used 8 oz. chocolate, ~ 6T butter, 1T light corn syrup, and 2-3T Chambord). We made three sizes including a tiny 1-inch heart that looked like a petit four  lovely! Instead of drizzling the tiny hearts, we dipped them and they were gorgeous! The batch won first prize in the Brownie division of the Chocolate Festival and sold at auction for $175. We called them Weapons of Mass Seduction

Big disappointment. Looked great in the springform. used buttered parchment paper and they were done at 38 minutes. No problem removing from pan. But taste? so ordinary. Try the brownies from Gourmet 2000 on this site for a knock your socks off experience

Can someone repost what Logan Utah said? The original comment's been removed. Without those apparently wonderful suggestions, I made this as per the recipe and it came out fine. Rich, fudgy brownies but with only a hint of raspberry flavor. Would love to hear what Logan did to jazz them up! A good recipe as it stands, though. Thanks.

Followed Logan Utah's suggestions and these were OUTSTANDING! Made with & without the icing; I also dipped all 4 sides in more Chambord- FABULOUS-will definitely make again.

These are fabulous and I must say that I am excited at the thought of making them again as a torte as suggested by abgrover from NY. Thanks for the idea!

Rating: 4
I made these as a torte this time around. I used a round glass pan (I recommend glass pans over metal pans regardless of how you prepare this recipe so they bake consistently). If you spray the pan well with a baking spray you won't need tin foil or a springform pan. I made a simple raspberry sauce found on this site (fresh raspberries, sugar, lemon juice - pureed then strained) and will be making a Chambord whipped cream to serve as well for a new year's eve dinner party.

I make this to bring to parties all the time, people rave over them. Definitely cut the sugar to 1 cup or less. 2 cups is teeth-curlingly sweet.

This recipe was amazing. The best one I have made off of this site so far! I followed the recipe exactly, only adding about a half tablespoon more of the Chambord for a bit more of that raspberry taste. Very quick and easy recipe, delicious, and decadent. A huge hit, and I plan on making them again tonight! Very rich.

Rating: 4
These were absolutely fabulous. I used excellent quality chocolate, it makes all the difference. Instead of semi-sweet chips I used bittersweet. Added a more dark and dense chocolate flavor..not a kiddie brownie!

Rating: 1
I reduced the sugar and still found it too sweet. I also found that the raspberry flavour was almost non-existent, despite the fact that I added extra jam. This was too fudgey/sweet/boring for me and those who tried it, and I was a little embarrassed to have given some of them as a gift - not my best work. The extras ended up being composted - not worth the time and the cost of the ingredients. Not rancid, but not worth making and certainly not worth making again.

Rating: 3
This was decadent and fudgy, with a chocolate double-punch. However, although I heeded the advice of prior reviewers and reduced the sugar to 1 1/3 cups, the brownies were still much too sweet! Next time (and there will be a next time), I will try 3/4 cups of sugar. I also baked the brownies in a 6'' by 8'' pan for 25 minutes and they were perfect.

Rating: 4
These were incredibly decadent - especially when served with fresh raspberries, ice cream and fresh mint. I lined the pan with prepped aluminum foil and had no difficulty removing the brownie.

Rating: 4
Terrific, very rich, so goes much farther than stated. I used less sugar as previously suggested, and cooked them in a 9 x 12 greased pan (so the foil would come out), lined with foil, and foil sprayed with pam, refrigerated overnight, and had no trouble getting the brownies out of the pan. I only cooked them for about 25 minutes, and they were perfect all around. I cut into small pieces, they really are rich, and drizzled the icing recipe Logan Utah suggested over them. (and what a great name for your variation, Logan Utah!). These are so easy and the results are amazing.

Rating: 4
Wonderful, decadent brownies! Reading everyone's reviews before I made them was extremely helpful--I am sure I would not have liked them nearly as much had I made them exactly as the recipe calls for. I also recommend playing with the amount of jam, liquor, and sugar to your taste. I added an entire cup of jam and substituted 6 tablespoons of Grenadine to get the intensity of berry flavor I was hoping for. I added chopped dark chocolate instead of the semi sweet to send them over the edge and give them an extra depth of flavor. I also baked them in a cake pan and had no trouble whatsoever.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe so many times - it has always turned out unbelievably great, especially with the changes that other reviewers have suggested. This time, however, I tried to lighten the recipe by using Earth Balance buttery sticks and Eggbeaters. I also only had seeded reduced-sugar jam (which was also kind of old...) and some ScharffenBerger chocolate that was well past its prime. Blech, blech, blech! It was so noxious - my kids gave it a clear thumbs down. Lessons learned: Use FRESH ingredients. Use REAL ingredients.

Rating: 2
I did not like the texture of these with the jam added. Also, after tasting these, I realize that I prefer my brownies to be just chocolate with no added flavors.

Rating: 4
So easy yet awesome! Followed it almost to a T, but used a cup of crushed 70% Lindt dark chocolate pieces instead of semisweet chips, and it was delicious. Definitely use the Chambord and seedless raspberry jam, it's a wonderful combination with the chocolate. Also, it was still tasty over a week after I made it.

Rating: 3
This recipe got great reviews at the party I brought it to but I am conflicted. Despite my use of buttered parchment paper, I ended up with a hard, blackened crust around the edge of the pan (and yes, I used the prescribed size springform pan). I cut off the edges. Interestingly, two guys proceeded to devour the discarded edges and pronounced them very tasty (we called it brownie biscotti). The brownies themselves are very fudgy - which many people loved but which felt undercooked to me. If asked, I would make this again. If it was left up to me, probably not.

Rating: 4
I have made these brownies 3 times, and always get compliments from the people I bring them to. This time around I switched the jam to seedless raspberry All-Fruit. It is still a bit too sweet (but tastes awesome anyway) so I will cut the sugar next time. I am still having problems with the center being too gooey when the outsides are almost overcooked. Perhaps I will try using a glass pan instead.

Rating: 4
Wow I made these for my family on Chirstmas and they were sooooo yummy. When I first served them, everyone thought they were a strange type of raspberry fudge! Since they were very rich I might suggest maybe making or buying some sort of whipping cream to serve with them to balance out the sweet. These "brownies" are so rich a decadent you'll be sure to impress any chocolate lover with them.

DECADENT!!! I AM NOT WORTHY!!! This is a sumptuous treat. I would say this makes 18, not 12 since these are so immediately satisfying to the wants of your chocolate bone.

Add a little more jam and liquer. I just got a grand Champion at my fair!

I thought these were very good and I will make them again. I just wanted to share my changes. Since it was mentioned that the raspberry flavor was not very prominent I upped the jam to 1/2 cup. The jam flavor was definitely recognizable without being overwhelming. Since a number of people had mentioned reducing the sugar I added 1 1/3 cups of sugar. I thought the changes were right on.

Rating: 3
The only changes I made were to reduce the sugar by 1/3 cup, then I baked them in a parchment-lined 9x12 pan for 30 minutes. Fabulous treats with perfectly subtle raspberry flavor. I suspect that replacing some of the sugar with light brown sugar will make them a bit fudgier, and I may try that next time, although they really need no improvement.

Rating: 3
These were quite nice. I used Valrhona 70% chocolate and cut way down on the sugar. Also used chopped same chocolate instead of the chips, and Framboise liqueur. I thought the raspberry flavor came through nicely. Also, the brownie was slightly overbaked after the stated time in the oven...next time I'll leave it in less.

Rating: 4
Absolutely fabulous. These taste like the brownies you pay $4 each for at a restaurant or "boutique" bakery. Could not stop eating them! My modifications: used only 1.5c sugar, 72% dark chocolate instead of semisweet chips, and Godiva liqueur (it's all I had) instead of raspberry liqueur. My only complaint (if you could call it that) is that the raspberry flavor was too subtle, perhaps due to my lack of the liqueur called for. These are pure decadence.

These were like buttah!!! Absolutely decadent and extremely easy to make. I made them following the recipe and no gripes from me.

Let me just say that the cook from Logan Utah knows what she is doing. I followed her suggestion to cut the brownies out and use the chocolate chambord glaze and they were fabulous. I used seedless jam, which I would think would be a given. I mean who wants seeds in their brownies? I didn't reduce the sugar and I thought they were great. I shipped them overnight, though the courier screwed up and he missed the delivery. He did not get them for 5 days, but when he did, he called me up and professed that I "had skills" and that they were "to die for". He also said they looked great too. (I dipped the small hearts in chocolate and drizzled chocolate on the bigger ones.) I will make these brownies again come valentines day I'm sure......assuming we're still dating and deserves them! - LOL

These were a huge hit at our boating party last night with men and women alike. Thanks to others for the hint about seedless jam. I didn't have the 9-inch size springform pan, so used a 9-inch cake pan sprayed and lined with parchment paper and it worked just fine.

Rating: 3
I read all the reviews before making this recipe. I used seedless raspberry jam as suggested by others. I only had Creme de Cassis (black currant liquor) on hand so that's what I used. I cut down the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and the next time I think I'll cut it down to 1 cup. Otherwise, a delicious brownie!

I know a few reviewers mentioned this in their previous comments, but I would _definitely_ recommend using seedless jam. I would have enjoyed these brownies so much more if the seeds were not present (and I always eat jam with seeds in it, I guess I don't like seeds in my brownies) Other than that I thought they were fantastic.

Yum and so easy. I made these with a friend who had never baked before (different culture and hadn't discovered chocolate cookery ... now I've introduced her I don't think I'll be able to stop her!). The raspberry flavour was so subtle, we used baileys as the liqueur which also was very subtle and it all went together so easily. We did reduce the sugar by a bit and it was fine, it did stick to the foil and was tricky to remove.

These are absolutely divine. I had some issues with cooking time - the edges were done faster than the middle - so I will adjust that next time. I cut up the "brownie" (I'd consider this a torte!) in small squares to get rid of the slightly-overdone edges, and served with powdered sugar, raspberries, a mint leaf, and a scoop of Haagen-Dasz Raspberry White Chocolate ice cream. They are rich and heavenly and got rave reviews - they were devoured by 6 people!!

OHMIGOD! I have only made brownies once before (Parker Brownies from this site whic are only so-so) and I couldn't keep my hands off these! BEWARE - there is way too much sugar in this recipe. I used 1 1/4 cups which was plenty. I also used Kahlua as the liqeuer since that's what I had. They weren't as cooked in the middle but that made them nice and fudgey. Very rich - makes way more than is indicated, since I cut them quite small due to their decadence.

The first time I made these, I used a regular 8 inch cake pan (parchment on the bottom and they practically slid out) and followed the recipe to the letter - absolute dream! My mother, who has given up chocolate, couldn't keep out of it! The second time I didn't have unsweetened chocolate and subbed bittersweet,lowered the amt of sugar and used a slightly bigger pan (I had to bake the 1st one consideribly longer). What a dissapointment. I often do small changes in recipes freely but never again with this one! It's perfect like it is!

Rating: 4
Oh MY! I had a half-pint of raspberries to use up and subbed them for the jam. HEAVEN! The batch didn't last until it was cool, even the next-door neighbor had to come over and find out what smelled so good. We'll be making these until berry season is over.

Rating: 4
Shockingly easy and very popular! I found that the brownies did not easily let go of the bottom of the springform, meaning that when I cut my (very small) slices I'd almost have to scrape the soft brownies on to plates....but nobody complained. Very rich!! And to the person who mentioned heating it for a few seconds in the microwave --- genius!!

I modified the recipe a bit which I'm sure changed the result - reduced butter to 1 stick and reduced sugar because I didnt use unsweetened chocolate and used strawberry liquor because I couldnt find raspberry. End result I thought was OK but didnt get as excited as other reviewers. Topped with raspberry sauce, whipped cream and a raspberry which seemed to impress the guests. The raspberry sauce was awesome - will use it on a different brownie recipe.

This recipe was delicious, I would give it 3 1/2 stars! Brought them to work and they were gobbled up in no time, although they are so rich I think they were too much for a few people. I also used the Ghiradelli Double Chocolate chips, which worked out wonderfully! Would definitly make again!

3.5 forks :-) I've made this three times--it's so rich that I can usually only manage to eat a tiny sliver, but I always get a ton of compliments on it. My officemates can't quite fathom that I can whip this up in an hour (Nobody believes that it's as easy as I promise it is...) P.S. I think it can easily serve 18--I usually cut it into 20-24 slices and there are no complaints about portion size.

This recipe was easy and absolutely wonderful. Very Rich!!! A chocolate lovers dream. Served this with a wonderful port wine and everyone at the table raved about the wonderful flavor.

I will add this to the list of favorites!!

Very impressive dessert. I didn't have unsweetened chocolate so I used bittersweet and only 3/4 c. sugar. Also substituted with blackberry jam, and blackberry brandy. Went a step furthur and covered with a ganache topping. Served atop a pool of blackberry coulis with a quenelle of freshly whipped cream, a sprig of mint, and light dusting of powdered sugar. Next time will reduce chocolate chips to 3/4 c. So rich and decadent!

I made this recipe-- really a cake-- in an 8 1/2 inch springform pan and just added 7 1/2 minutes to the cooking time. It came out perfectly. Don't worry if the edges are more done than the center--that's what gives this cake its gooey, truffle-like texture. Seedless jam is a must. After sprinkling the cake with confectioner's sugar, I mounded fresh raspberries garnished with mint leaves in the center, and it was beautiful. This cake is delicious and elegant enough for the most sophisticated party, and as easy to make as whipping up a batch of brownies. A definite keeper.

These brownies were very rich and delicious. I would have liked an even more pronounced raspberry flavor.
