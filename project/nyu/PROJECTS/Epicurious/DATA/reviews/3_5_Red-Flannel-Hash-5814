I love this at Rick & Ann's and I loved it at home. I left out the cream and used a combination of left over corned beef from St. Patty's Day and some uncured turkey bacon from TJ's. Excellent.

This is a good recipe for hash because it means everything is cooked before it's mixed together, which makes even browning easier. I just made a delicious hash starting with raw steak mince (ground sirloin) since I had no leftover beef. Mince was sauteed, stirring constantly, in goose fat with finely chopped onion until onion done and mince no longer pink. Then put in mixing bowl. Then added finely diced cooked beetroot, 1 cooked parsnip and 1 small cooked celeriac and 2 medium cooked potatoes. I made a thick gravy/bechamel in the pan used for cooking the meat, using more goose fat and flour and beef stock. I mixed this with the meat and veg. and added a bit more salt and a good slosh of worcester sauce. Also a bit of light cream though probably could have left this out. I should have heated a bit more goose fat in a nonstick pan and fried the mix in batches to get a good brown crust. Instead I tried to cook all at once in a big stainless steel saute pan. Mistake. Still delicious but stuck like billy-o.

i'm going to try roasting the beets instead of steaming. i think that would add a bit of flavor to the whole thing. a local restaraunt has a version...i'll ask them how they do it.

I've made this many times, I love the addition of beets. Tonight I made it again, and substituted some filet mignon that I had instead of the bacon, not bad, and I served with eggs, but I think I like some bacon in it too for the added flavor.

I hate to go against the grain, but this was just ok. The beets didn't seem to blend with the other potatoes. Maybe I picked out bad beets. I followed this recipe to the letter and my guests were not impressed.

What a wonderful recipe. As a vegan I made a couple of changes and it still turned out great. Instead of bacon I substituted 8 strips of tempeh marinated in dijon mustard, maple syrup, and soy sauce and seasoned with a bbq spice rub. The marinade carmelized beautifully when fried. I also substituted unsweetend soy milk for the whipping cream and no richness was lost. I left out the parsley as well because, well I don't like it. Goes perfectly with tofu scramble, sauteed collards, and dilled tofu sour cream.

This is so colorful. I wish Epicurious would show the picture. I thought this was yummy and in spite of the bacon and eggs it's not very high in calories. I would make this for house guests by following the suggestion to steam the vegetables and cook the bacon the night before.

The natural sweetness of the beets and sweet potatoes makes this quite delicious. To save time, I grated the potatoes in my food processor and skipped the steaming. I omitted the bacon and substituted light cream for whipping cream, and crumbled some blue cheese on top for flavor (as suggested in another recipe). The result was a little heavy, so next time I think I'll skip the cream altogether and go easy on the cheese, if I use it at all. I'm looking forward to experimenting with some other root vegetables in this recipe for variety.

I have had this hash at Rick & Ann's restaurant in Berkeley and thought it was outstanding. Am so happy to find the recipe.

The addition of beets and sweet potato really makes this hash outstanding. I precooked the veggies the night before to cut down on prep time in the morning. The beets will bleed but hey, it all goes down the same...
