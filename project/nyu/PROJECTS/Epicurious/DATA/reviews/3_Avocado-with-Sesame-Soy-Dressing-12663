This is one of the recipes I used last summer to lose 20 pounds. It is so delicious and satisfying. I used Stevia or Splenda instead of sugar although the recipe doesn't really call for much sugar. I didn't put the avocado on a "bed" of lettuce (how 50's is that?,) I mixed it all together, and if I was really hungry and hadn't had time to eat much else all day, I used two avocados. Shocking! Avocados are so good for us and so satisfying--if you overdo it, do it with veggies or fruits. Eat all the fruits and veggies you want, no matter what the fat or carb content. Veggie fat and veggie carbs are good for us. This recipe is superb.

So I sort of screwed up the recipe and ended up mashing the avocado with everything. It looked a little bland so I added some chopped cilantro. Served with pita chips to absolute raves! The richness of the avocado goes well with the sesame for sort of an East-meets-West guacamole.

Very tasty, simple dressing that compliments the avocado quite well. Yummy!

Made this with a large, delicious FL avocado, which are so plentiful right now. Also added a handful of halved grape tomatoes. Loved all the flavors of the dressing, for which I specifically chose this recipe! Do try and enjoy! KIMBER

I thought this recipe outstanding -- delicious and simple. I added peeled, seeded, and chopped tomatoes to the dressing. It reminded me of an avocado and tomato dish I had at an Asian restaurant in Chatham on Cape Cod. I plan to make this recipe often.

For simplicity and a refreshing change of pace you can't beat this dressing. I did not have Jicama (never tried it) but it was wonderful on avocado. In fact it is pretty good on any kind of salad. If you like sesame you will like this. If you don't like sesame - you won't.

Great with sliced cherry tomatoes added.

While this dressing was easy to make, it overpowered the avocado slices with a strong sesame flavor.

I made this recipe with a fresh Maui avocado and it was simple and delicious. It was a little salty and I would probably put a little less soy sauce. The texture was wonderful.
