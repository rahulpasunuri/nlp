Excellent recipe, and versatile. Using what I had in stock, my version included roasted chicken breasts, toasted pine nuts (instead of almonds), basil (instead of cilantro). Replaced half the celery with a gravenstein apple. I doubled the dressing, since it didn't seem moist enough, but will try the amount stated next time, although it was delicious, and didn't seem too dressed. Also added feta cheese. Served on a bed of mesclun. For some reason, I've never made chicken salad before, and lucked out with an amazing recipe.

Wonderful -- light and fresh. A great alternative to mayonnaise-based chicken salad. I added some lime zest and crumbled goat cheese, however, and that really made it special. Goat cheese goes so nicely with lime. The second time I made it, I substituted finely diced green apple for half the celery, keeping the crunch but adding a little more sweet-tart flavors. IMO, that (with the goat cheese) put it over the top and made it exceptional. I've stuffed it into pita pockets and endive cups, wrapped in lettuce leaves, and laid it on a simple bed of greens. Beautiful.

Just made this because I had leftover roast chicken. Added chopped green onions and a can of chopped up mandarin oranges. Doubled the recipe. Used two limes and also zested them and added the zest. Wonderful....light and refreshing. Great use of leftovers.

So EZ and tasty! Followed the recipe almost to a T, only substituted store-bought rotisserie chicken for the smoked. I made the recipe X5 for 20 Red Hatters and bunco. Rave reviews. Made everything up the day before, added the dressing and nuts just before serving over fresh arugula. Made fresh baked Parker House Rolls to go with. a KEEPER!

Surprisingly delicious - used lightly toasted pine nuts instead of almonds and parsley instead of cilantro since I had them on hand and it was fantastic. Served on mesclun greens with clementine slices and grape tomatoes with a splash of fig balsamic vinegar. Everything got lapped up in record time.

Used oven roasted sliced almonds and skipped the roasting step, did not rehydrate the craisins, just coarsely chopped, and used two baked chicken breasts in place of the smoked chicken. Also added a chopped green onion and subbed 1 Tb of the oil with fat free chicken broth. I thought it seemed too simple to be very tasty but it was wonderful, moist and flavorful and perfect for a hot summer day.

Tasty, light, easy to make. We stuff inside a pita pocket- perfect for bringing on picnics or potlucks. Everybody who's eaten this loves it.

Delicious, light salad which was a hit with my guests. I used extra almonds and cranberries, and also a roasted chicken and the result was perfect.

Incredibly easy to make and tastes fantastic. I usually use a roasted chicken from the market and shred it. The simplicity of preparation is a definite plus. It's my potluck go-to. I also consider this to be a low-fat recipe, because one can adjust how much olive oil and dressing to use. And, despite being "low- fat," it never fails to receive compliments every time I make it. Great color. Great flavors. No worries about anything spoiling as it sits on the table.

I really enjoyed this recipe, I changed it slightly, but kept the basic flavors of almonds and cranberries. I used a whole roasted chicken (shredded)and home-made basil parmesan mayo. I left out the cilantro so as not to contradict the flavors, and served it in a pita pocket with roasted peppers. It was a hit! I will definitly make it again, and soon!

This is a great chicken salad- particularly for a luncheon. It is light, healthy, pretty and, thanks to the cilantro, smells terrific! Thanks to the user who suggested grilling the chicken on the Foreman grill- that's just what I did and it worked out great. Some other things to try: I added golden raisins to this recipe and it was just the right touch for color and taste. Also, instead of getting into toasting the almonds, I bought the Sunkist Almond Accents (produce section) in the oven roasted flavor- they were perfect and totally easy. Do go the extra mile and use fresh limes for lime juice- it makes all the difference. Also- forget soaking the cranberries- totally unnecessary. Buy Craisins, chop them quickly and you're all set. For a group larger than 3 or 4, I suggest doubling the recipe; you'll need it, and it's great the second day anyway. Serve with a simple spinach salad and some crusty French bread and you have a great, easy meal for your next luncheon!

Yummy. Simple. I grilled 2 chicken breasts on the Foreman grill to use in this. Fast.

I made this with poached chicken breast. A refreshing, light salad. The cranberries combine well with the lime juice.
