Man! This was great! I was skeptical all the way to the first bite, at which point I became an instant convert. The anchovies were pretty, er, fragrant, until a few minutes of sauteing softened them up and diminished the scent. Then deliciousness happened. I added a whole chopped tomato, and finished with the juice of half of a lemon right before serving. I think the lemon is key. Thanks for the recipe!

I prefer not to blanch my greens and instead just sauté them. I like the bite that way, and I think this recipe (minus the blanching) is really quite nice. I wouldn't have thought to use anchovies, but they work very well and are really just a background element complementing the bitterness of the greens. A little salt and pepper at the end, and I served them with hot Italian turkey sausages. A keeper.

I doubled the amount of anchovies, and did not pat them down. Rather tipped a bit of anchovie juice/oil in the pan. The anchovies really mellow when they are cooked, and anyone should let go of the notion that the final dish will taste like salted fish. A very simple dish that went wonderfully with a pork/bean and rice stew.

I used the Collards Miniera method (recipe on this site), replacing the bacon with anchovies. (Salted ones, well rinsed and filleted.) Mashed into a paste in the hot oil, then quick sauteed finely sliced collard. Fast, tasty.
