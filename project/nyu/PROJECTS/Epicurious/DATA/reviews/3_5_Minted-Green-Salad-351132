I was on and off the fence on this one. In the end, I think I would rather mince the mint and blend it with the olive oil and vinegar before tossing with the salad. It was very delicious for the most part, though. Adding radishes would be a nice idea! Too much green. More color.

Yum - and the kids liked it because it had cucumbers in it - next time I would reduce the olive oil - I used Bibb lettuce, and add radishes for a little extra color and crunch.

I thought I already reviewed this. OK here we go again. I love the ingredrients in this salad, however, I found that some fresh garlic, some dijon mustard, and some finely chopped jalapeno, or any hot pepper really makes the mint pop.

while I love the ingredients in this salad,I found it much more interesting with a little garlic and some dijon mustard in the dressing. Just a little. Also, just a tiny bit of finely chopped jalepeno makes the mint pop.
