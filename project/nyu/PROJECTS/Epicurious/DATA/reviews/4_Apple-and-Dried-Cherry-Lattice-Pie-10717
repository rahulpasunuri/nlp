Delicious pie! Used the Easy Pastry Dough recipe and it was perfect with this filling. I prefer this pie to the Apple and Tart Cherry Pie recipe also on epi., this one seems to have a better balance of sweet to tartness.

wow. It looks as amazing as it tastes! I covered the whole thing, didn't do the lattice and used Martha's basic pie crust recipe instead. I also omitted the dried fruit b'cuz I didn't have it so I used a lg handfull of frozen, unsweetened cranberries...YUM. I will definately make this again!

I made this pie 5 years ago for Thanksgiving, and my family will not let me miss a year ever again. It is the best apple pie I've ever had. The sour cherries are terrific (plump them in a little hot water if they're too dried out), and the contrast between the tart apples and caramel layer is awesome. If you want to make the lattice (spectacular, but more fussing) you should use the shortening crust, but an all butter one works fine for a simple double crust. I get asked for the recipe anytime I bring it anywhere.

This pie was AMAZING. I'm so glad I made two. One for the house and one to take to Easter Dinner!! Even better than my old Gourmet recipe. I didn't bother with the cherries, and did a 50:50 mix of Braeburns and Granny Smiths. I also threw in a little bit of nutmeg with the filling. I used Whole Foods prepared pie crusts since I was in a rush. It was served with French vanilla ice cream and it was phenomenal. I had four requests for the recipe before we even left that night.

Oh boy this pie was delicious! I used the Joy of Cooking deluxe butter pastry recipe which is great. The filling was oozing butter and a little sweet for me, so I will cut down on the brown sugar/butter mixture next time. But it was so yummy, a big hit for Christmas dinner!

The pie was fabulous and even impressed my foodie family. The crust was a disappointment, but a quickie trip to the supermarket saved our thanksgiving.

Excellent pie. Made it exactly as recipe directed, it was done in the time given to the minute. We used half Granny Smiths and half Braeburns as suggested by two reviewers (Thanks!!), was a perfect combination. The brown sugar layer just gives it something extra and is a wonderful contrast with the tang of the apples. I liked the 350 baking temperature, crust didn't need to be covered and filling didn't overflow. I don't have much luck with recipes that get you to start at a hotter temperature and then turn it down. I'm much more pleased with the method in this recipe. Will be making this pie again.

I've been making this pie since it appeared in Gourmet magazine. It is always a hit and family and friends ask for it throughout the year. The crust is difficult to work with and can get chewy so I use the Gourmet's pate brisee recipe and it is awesome! The sour cherries balance the sweet apple mixture.

After reading the previous reviewer's comments, I had to try this pie for my thanksgiving feast. After having made the pie, I think it should be called the "HOLY COW-PIE" pie. I followed the recipe to the "t" and found the pie crust to be chewy and salty; the filling was pleasant, but nothing to rave about. I give it a 2, and would never bother to make it again.

HOLY COW! I was shocked when I tasted this pie. Normally I'm not a huge fan of apple pies but this was super-delish. I used orange flavored dried cranberries, half braeburn and half granny smith. It was SO amazingly good, this is going to be the only apple pie recipe I'll ever use. YUM.

This recipe is a family favorite! Try a mixed berry and cherry combo for the fruit- it is delicious. I too found that the crust was difficult to work with, so I tried placing the crust and the rolling pin in the fridge for about ten minutes and it is MUCH more manageable.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone seemed to like it. I've never made a pie crust with shortening before and perhaps I did something wrong, but it was a disaster to work with. I thought it would be worth the effort but I found the crust to be mealy and not flaky. The pie was very good, but next time would just make it with mt standard butter crust.

i love this pie - the only reason i didn't give 4 forks is that i think it really needs to be served with vanilla bean ice cream and not whipped cream. also, i do think a mix of granny smith and braeburn apples would rock! i'm going to try again with the apple mix.

Gobbling down a slice as I write this! Tested this pie for Thanksgiving and it's incredible. Substituted a premade crust (though it was made with butter and tastes just like home-made). I was out of ice cream, so served egg nog with the pie- I'd think that egg nog ice cream would taste great with this pie. Also, I put the brown sugar mixture in a pastry bag and piped it in after I put on the lattice top. That way it got down into the apples and was a heavenly addition to the pie!

This is a great apple pie. I hate to admit it, but it's replaced the old family recipe. To save time, I don't bother with the lattice top and it tastes just as good.

An outstanding pie. The detailed instructions on lattice topping made this the prettiest pie I've ever served. Great crust. I used dried cherries, but prefer dried cranberries.

I used a frozen crust, accidently left out the lemon, didn't have dough for the lattice, burned the top of the pie and it was still fabulous. I can't wait to try it again to find out how great it should be!

This was absolutely fantastic. I've never used tart apples in a pie before, and I was a bit nervous about how it would come ut, but the combination of the apples, dried cranberries and caramel were out of this world. I made it for dinner with friends and they RAVED about it.

I had great luck with this recipe. The pie was delicious, and it turned out beautifully. I used an extra strip or two that I had cut for the lattice to make a sort of collar for the edges, and it looked fine. EXCELLENT with vanilla bean ice-cream :-)

This is my standard applie pie now. I never make it without people begging me for the recipe. My son's favorite! One thing...the crust is difficult to work with, (but delicious)resulting in a the edges being impossible to make pretty. No big deal though cuz the pie is suberb!

Fabulous! Not too sweet, not too sour. The cinnamon and apples make it more appropriate for a winter recipe, and the cherries are nicely plump and moist. The caramel is marvelous! It's a bit messy to make, but the outcome is WELL worth the effort! Do yourself a favor and try it!
