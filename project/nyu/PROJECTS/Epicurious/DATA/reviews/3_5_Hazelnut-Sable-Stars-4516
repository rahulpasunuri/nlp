I just made these for the first time. Since I was trying to recreate cookies from my favorite bakery, I made some (excellent) modifications. I used fine sugar instead of powdered, I halved the insane amount of vanilla, and, most important, I used two cups of whole hazelnuts, toasted and skinned. I then froze my dough in logs overnight(I wrapped the logs in waxed paper and then squeezed them into empty paper towel rolls to keep them round). I and sliced them while frozen with a very sharp knife, and baked them for about 15 minutes, turning them in the middle. They came out perfectly.

I've been making these cookies since finding the recipe in Bon Appetit in 1997 and they're always a big hit. Although it makes them a bit harder to roll out, I process or chop the nuts so that some of the pieces are still big enough to be recognizable (about 1/4 cm. in size or so). This makes for a more interesting texture and more obvious nutty flavor. Also, don't skip the chocolate drizzle: it adds a lot to both the flavor and appearance of the cookies. Enjoy!

I reverted to this old recipe this year (from a hazelnut/almond cookie I usually do at Christmas) -- and I got raves from all who sampled them or received them as gifts. I leave off the chocolate as I find it is easier to package and store them.

Terrible. The powdered sugar makes these cookies crumble in an unpleasant way, whether you're biting in to them or just trying to move them.

Eureka! As a big hazelnut fan, this was exactly what I was looking for in a cookie! The powdered sugar makes the sweetness as subtle as Russian/Mexican tea cakes. I toasted the hazelnuts at 400 degrees for a good 20 plus minutes until toasty brown (taking skins off). Used mini-food processor to chop/grind them finely. I'm a busy mom of 1-year-old, haven't made cookies in years, and needed a recipe exciting enough for a cookie exchange party. This may be my favorite cookie recipe ever.

I'm sure there's an excellent chocolate-hazelnut cookie out there somewhere, but this isn't it. These cookies were ok, but not knock-your-socks-off Wow! I found them to be dry and not buttery enough- and despite all the hazelnuts (and I did toast them) the hazelnut flavor wasn't as pronounced as I like. They mostly reminded me of dry, insipid shortbread with chocolate on. Next time, I'll start with a real shortbread recipe and go from there- maybe add some Frangelico to up the hazelnut taste. A dissapointment, given the rave reviews.

Delicious but a bit time consuming. Also, make sure to chop the hazelnuts extremely fine- otherwise it's difficult to roll the dough. Great for gift giving!

Pretty cookies and delicious, although my family wasn't as wild about them as I was. The chocolate worked well: I grouped all the cookies together and did a zig-zag pattern over all of them at once: done in an instant!

This cookie has become a favorite in our household. Buttery flavor, hazelnuts and chocolate-- how can you go wrong? This recipe is now a permanent fixture for our Christmas cookie repetoire.

Everybody loved the cookies, even kids. They were a delicious addition to the holiday dessert spread. Easy to make, too.
