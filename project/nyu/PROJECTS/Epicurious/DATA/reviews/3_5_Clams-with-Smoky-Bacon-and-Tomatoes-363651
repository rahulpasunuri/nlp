Loved the fact that it is simply a few ingredients and 275 calories a serving, 5 grams of fat. You can substitute turkey bacon or uncured bacon for a healthier option. I agree that there was too much sauce and like the idea of adding the tomatoes and adding the juice afterwards. I also added fresh tomatoes to the sauté and a little white wine cooked down. Husband loved the smell as he walked through the door.

This is a very simple recipe that turns out well. I reduced the overall portion to make it for one person and substituted mussels and shrimp for some of the clams. I was very pleased with the results.

Loved the smokiness of the bacon with the clams and the speed it went together. We added some crushed red pepper with the garlic for a little kick. Next time I make it I will drain the tomatoes and add the liquid in gradually as there was a lot of broth. Almost too much for the crusty bread.

This is a very good quick & easy weeknight recipe. My only change was to substitute dried herbes de provence for the parsley as I had no fresh parsley on hand. I can imagine it being even better with fresh tomatoes & fresh basil from my garden this summer. I made soup out of the leftovers -- pureed the broth & added a little half & half, chopped the clams & added them at the last minute. Yummmm!

Why is a recipe with bacon in the "Healthy" section?

I love clams and bacon, but this was not good. I found the sauce overpowering for the clams. Much prefer something like mussels puttenesca. I missed having some olive oil and/or butter. I like a lot of sauce for dipping the bread, but this was about twice the amount I needed.

Loved it! Pretty much made it as written. Make sure you have a nice loaf of crusty bread to sop up the delicious broth.
