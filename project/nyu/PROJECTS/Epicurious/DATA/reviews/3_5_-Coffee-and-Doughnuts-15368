I have made this twice, in half-batches each time. These doughnuts are so terrific, I love them. So does everyone else who tries them, even when they're "day old". My only "hiccup" is that this not the identical recipe from Keller's "French Laundry Cookbook"... This one appears to be a multiplied batch of his, but still, I'm curious. Today's venture into doughnut-land will be to make the one from the book (as we only have 6 guests, not 12). I'm excited. If you don't have the book, still, make these. You will be so happy you did. And you'll have earned your Patience badge for the month.

I guess if waiting for dough to rise is "too involved," then that's their loss, but the ACTIVE prep time was quick and easy, and the results are worth the effort for two delicious desserts in one! I guess Keller and his pastry chefs know what they're doing. ;)

This was my first attempt at doughnuts and turned out great (nice texture and flavor). The semifreddo is a very good alternative to ice cream that doesn't require a machine. I froze the extra, uncooked doughnuts, per the recipe, and they thawed and cooked as well as the fresh dough.

I did make this as a half-batch with no problems. Also left some of the doughnut dough cut into shapes in the fridge overnight (as opposed to the half hour in the recipe) to no ill effect. Everyone devoured it. This is a great recipe.

This recipe is does take a bit of time but I will make this again and again. It is well worth the effort.. they are WONDERFUL!! I do a great deal of bread making and found this recipe to be one of my favorites!! Fill them with strawberry preserves for a great treat!

This was my first attempt at Doughnut making and I must say it went well. I was a little worried about the ratio of flour to liquid, last night it was really hard to "knead the dough" because it was just dry flakes, I had to add more water just to get it into one heavy cannonball lump. Today went much better :) I have about three dozen wonderful doughnuts. I had to fry them in a electric fry pan as I do not have a deepe fat fryer. Each doughnut cooked fro about 1 min per side. Yummy, yummy

I don't know why people complain so much about this recipe. I'm a rookie baker with limited kitchen space, and frankly, I had fun making these. And boy, were the results worth the work(albeit a bit misshapen--I used a flower-shaped cookie cutter to cut out the doughnuts and I packed them just a leetle bit too close together on the tray while they rose). Fluffy and soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. And best of all, I have enough doughnuts to feed me and my household for the next three days. Definitely a success, especially for a person who'd never made any kind of bread before. Next time I'm going all out and making a glaze for it, as well as filling them with raspberry jam. Mmmmmmmmmm.

Oh, BOO-hoo to those who said this was "too involved" - what the hell do you want from probably the top restaurant in America!? Why do you think they have a 2-month wait-list? I've made several of his recipes (LATimes.com has his fantastic column every now and then) - the short ribs are to DIE for - and all are "involved" but WELL worth the effort. Want something easy - make Hamburger Helper. Want to be a cook? Try this! ;-)

I had this dessert at the French Laundry and it was sensational. It is one of their signature desserts. Very whimsical and very good. Like many of the recipes in their cookbook, the preparation is extremely involved but the results are great. It's nice to know how it is made even if it is not that realistic to make. The best thing to do is go to the French Laundry and have them there. (You need to call three months ahead to get a reservation, and even then you might not be able to get one. We were lucky.)

Way too complicated! My mother had a simple, easy 'farmhouse' recipe for doughnuts that were delicious.

They were a bit lengthy to make, but they turned out delicious!
