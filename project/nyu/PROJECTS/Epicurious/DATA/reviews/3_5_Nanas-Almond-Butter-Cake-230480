Had only marzipan and not almond paste, so ground sliced almonds with some icing sugar, almond extract, a bit of orange blossom water (3/4 tsp - not enough to taste in the end) and the specified amount of water. Briefly froze the dough for the top and worked very quickly so the lattice worked out fine. Disappointed in the same-day taste, but much better the day after.

I loved the way this cake (more like a torte) turned out, but I thought I should mention how strange it seemed the whole time. The "batter" was more like a very sticky cookie dough, and the filling seems like it can't possibly be right. The dough is VERY difficult to work with for the lattice (I ended up rolling it out and popping it into the freezer for 15mn), and then when it comes out of the oven it is only about an inch high. BUT. The end result is amazing, so keep going, because it's worth it!

It was great with a cup of tea! I found that the top strips were hard to handle and ended up crumbling the rest of the dough on top, sprinkled some sliced almonds on top with a bit of sugar before baking.

I made this cake for Easter and everyone LOVED it. It has such a great texture and flavor. Great the second day as well. I also made sticky toffee pudding and everyone favored the butter cake. It looks gorgeous too.

I loved this cake. It was easy and fun to make. It looked beautiful. It tasted great and had a wonderful texture. Not too sweet. Perfect with a cup of tea. I was hoping for more almond flavor, so I'll probably cut back on the cinnamon next time.

I made this cake at Thanksgiving. It was different then the usual overly sweet cakes. It is firmer and perfect with a cup of tea or a glass of wine.
