I pureed 3/4 of the corn, onions, and jalapeno and didn't feel the need to strain the vegetables. My husband and I liked the "corny" taste and feel of the soup--somewhat chowder-like. Outside of the bacon (and maybe even with it), the entire thing could easily be accomplished outdoors on a gas grill with a side burner, which makes it a good idea for a light summer supper or a first course for a special meal. I did sugar and pepper the water in which I cooked the corn (1/2 t ea.) Lovely, simple and light flavors--not too hot despite a whole jalapeno. Just a nice warm mouthbuzz.

I followed this recipe exactly. I was surprised that the color was not as bright as I had expected (sort of a dull yellow), and the texture was, well, corny. Pureeing the corn mixture did not make it creamy at all, as I could still feel the fibers of the corn kernels in my mouth. I decided to puree all of it, and then strain it, which yielded a something I would describe as a corn broth, great for poaching fish in or serving in shot glasses with some crispy shallots or scallops right on top.
