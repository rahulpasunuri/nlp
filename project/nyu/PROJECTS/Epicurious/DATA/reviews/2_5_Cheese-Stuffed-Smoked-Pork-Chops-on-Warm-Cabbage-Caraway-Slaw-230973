Tasty week night meal. Used all ingredients as written but will try balsamic vinegar as suggested by the previous reviewer next time. Served with baked sweet potatoes.

Quick, tasty and easy, this recipe is sure to please. The slaw, which I made with a few substitutions (white balsamic vinegar for cider; celery seeds for caraway), was so good raw we ate it that way, and had only two servings from a half cabbage. The smoked pork chops are hammy in flavor and their cooking time was literally 7 minutes. I think this recipe might lend itself to a number of cheeses; the Jarlberg onhand in the fridge melded smoothly with rose baises pepper. This recipe is Atkins and carb free diet friendly. I used Bush's baked beans to round out the main course.

Easy, quick and delicious... I made everything in 15 minutes or so. After assembling the slaw in a few short minutes, I found it good raw and left it that way for the anti-oxidant kick. Because my cupboard was inadequately stocked, I substituted white balsamic vinegar in place of cider and celery seed in place of caraway. I will definitely make this again year round. The chops were great with the Jarlsberg I had on hand and cooked up perfectly in 7 minutes flat.
