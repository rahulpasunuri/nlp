The next time I make this master recipe for the shortbread crust I would like to substitute Nutella for the preserves and use the cream cheese topping. Has anyone tried this?

This is a wonderful, easy recipe! I had a jar of blueberry preserves that were too runny for my liking so it was a perfect way to use them up. I've also make this recipe with fresh blueberries simmered and thickened with cornstarch, sugar and water (like you would make for a cheesecake topping).

Have made this so many times, but just had to come back to add a couple of things. I really think these are best after they've been chilled overnight. I also think they taste best cold. I like these because you can do small bites for a cocktail party (1"x1" squares) or sometimes I'll do this in 3" x 3" squares and top each square with a berry and a sprig of mint.

I used the recipe for the shortbread base and a jar of strawberry-rhubarb preserves. It wasn't enough so I had to fill in with blackberry preserves. It tasted delicious though. I also tried putting the shortbread in the bottom of mini cupcake cups and it worked too. Simple and easy recipe. Will definitely make again.

I cut this recipe in half, used strawberry preserves, and baked in a 9 inch pie plate. YUM. If you like cheesecake, but cant stand the guilt of a huge slab, this is a great alternative. Definitely warm preserves for 30 seconds in the microwave before spreading over crust as another reviewer suggested. Next time I will try with double the preserves.

Rating: 4
Quick to make, there was plenty of time to make the cheesecake topping while the shortbread was cooking. Using an offset spatula makes spreading over the hot shortbread easy. The shortbread seemed too dry at first - but it came out perfectly. Good cheesecake flavor!

Made these for the TN-Bama football game. Everybody loved them. I did make a few changes, like lining the pans with Release aluminum foil which makes it super-easy to cut these bars. Also, heat the preserves for 30 seconds in the microwave or it tears up the shortbread base.

I've made this before and always have had primo results. This time I went pumpkin! I used one 10 oz. jar of Trader Joe's pumpkin butter in place of the preserves, and it was fantastic. It was a little light on pumpkin flavor, so next time I'd do a jar & 1/2.

This was an amazing dessert. I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup in the shortbread base, because the preserves were pretty sweet already. Substituted blackberry preserves for blueberry -- spectacular! I will definitely keep this recipe to make again.

Really enjoyed this one. I used about 11 ounces of preserves over the shortbread and might even use a little more next time. I did think that the cheesecake layer was much too plain looking, so I used about an ounce of the preserves to swirl through the top. The presentation was much nicer that way.

I made this for a friend who was having a party and he said everyone raved about it. In fact he just called to ask me to make it again for him. Very easy to prepare. I will definitely make it again.

This was okay. It's easy to make and uses ingredients that most people have in the frig or pantry. Kind of bland though - even though I added whole blue berries in the topping. If I make it again I will mix the preserves and cream cheese mixture together. Like others I did have a hard time the bars out of the pan.

I made these for my sister's birthday, but since I didn't have a food processor, and wasn't sure how to work cold butter into the flour without it, I decided to do another version of shortbread (cream softened butter with sugar and then add the two cups of flour) which turned out delicious. I followed the rest of the recipe very thoroughly, because I had never made actual cheesecake before, and then left it in the fridge overnight before the party. Everybody liked it so much that they asked me to make it again for them soon (which is funny, considering I didn't even try the cheesecake since I hate the stuff).

Great! I made these for a party. I usually don't like cheesecake but I had to restrain myself from eating them all before the guests got there. :-p I think I used raspberry preserves instead of blueberry b/c that's what I had on hand.

Rating: 3
Very easy and delicious but too sweet for my taste. I used mixed berry jam in place of the blueberry jam and baked the crust for 16 minutes. It was a bit messy to cut into bars, even though it was cold by the time I did it.

This is the best! I use fresh blueberries, as many as I can pile on in a single layer.

Rating: 4
This is an outstanding recipe! I have made it for years. I never double the crust...just use as written. If I am serving it as THE dessert (versus part of a dessert buffet), I cut them into 3"x3" square and top w/ a whole raspberry (if I sub rasp. jam) and a sprig of mint. Beautiful and delicious! I have found that these are significatnly better if they are chilled overnight before eating. That takes them from 3 forks to four!

Rating: 4
I like to have a bit more crust too; and tried the 1/2 (not more than that) increase more than twice and unlike the other reviewer who didn't like it, the 1/2 increased crust works very well every single time for me, tender never soggy; always a favourite at functions. Simple yet delicious.

This recipe was excellent as written. I also liked the shortbread base as written, but I'm sure the recipe would lend itself to other shortbread recipes.

Do not listen to the person who said to increase the crust by 1/2.... for a 13X9 pan it is waaaayyy too much. I gave it a whirl and it messed up the whole recipe. I'm very disappointed! It made a really thick crust that barely cooked and was gloopy in the middle even after forty minutes. I'm sure it is OK if you follow the recipe exactly, though i found the cream cheese mixture to be kind of thick, which impeded spreading. but what the heck anyway; by then i tossed the whole thing.

You can't beat these bar recipes for taste & speed. I've made all(except lemon,because I really love my other lemon bar recipe). I usually add fresh blueberries. The pecan & macaroon bars are even better.

EXCELLENT & EASY. The crust is simple and good and I've made ALL their suggestions and each one was a hit. I made these cheesecake bars using "parve" cream cheese, tofutti, and everyone thought they were really dairy. Gets better the next day.

Rating: 4
A firm favourite amongst families and friends. I always make 1/2 more shortbread crust (be sure not to overbake or it gets a bit dry), spread enough raspberry jam to cover the baked shortbread and reduce sugar to about 1/2 cup and used parchment paper. This is meant as bars, not a 'proper' cheesecake (fave recipe from here also) , so enjoy the simplicity of this and have your 'bars'. Good one.

Have made this recipe, as written, several times, and it is always a great success.

Rating: 2
I've made every bar that goes with the shortbread base recipe and I have to say that this recipe's crust came out very thin and not too flaky like the others. I think it has something to do with the dough getting mushy due to the blueberry preserves. I would make the others again for sure but not this one.

Rating: 4
I had a few early problems--the shortbread base was cracked after the initial baking, and the cheesecake mixture was full of tiny lumps--but it all worked itself out by the end! These were delicious, though next time I'll increase the amount of jam to 1&1/4 cups. I'd like to find a way to pretty them up a little, but their plain looks didn't keep anyone from trying them--and finishing them! It was hard to cut through the base, but I had no problem with them sticking to my untreated nonstick pan.

Rating: 1
I made the mistake of substituing real blueberries for the preserves - turned the filling into a sloppy mess that didn't set no matter how long I cooked it for. I think it would have turned out OK if I had used less blueberries (I used 1 cup). Regardless, I had tried the shortbread base for another recipe, hoping it would be better this time but it still came out very dry and crumbly.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful recipe and very easy to make. Next time I will add more blueberries, or maybe a different kind of fruit. I would recommend this to anyone who likes cheesecake.

Rating: 4
This was delicious. I baked it for a party and everyone loved it. Very versatile you can substitute any kind of fruit if you din't like blueberries. Only one tip when making the shortbread don't line with aluminum foil, it gets annoying to take off,just use parchment paper instead.

Rating: 4
This is consistently my favorite dessert to make when asked to bring a dessert. I have made it several times with different fillings. I think my favorite was lemon curd. Very nice mix. You can also do half the baking sheet one flavor jam and the other half another. Just a suggestion! Enjoy!

Delicious! I doubled the filling and added fresh blueberries. I swirled the blueberry coloring across the top. Also, I used apricot jam on 1/5 and it was so good too.

Truly delicious !! I used more blueberry preserves than it called for - also sprinkled fresh whole blueberries over the preserves. It just baked so pretty and the whole blueberries came popping through the cream cheese !! Next time, I'll sprinkle the blueberries over top of the cream cheese mixture ! It was a perfect amount of filling !! These are very good cheesecake bars !!!

Excellent basic recipe. The topping can be easily adjusted. I heeded the warning of others who said the filling was not enough. Since blueberries were in season, I made a topping using 1 1/2 quarts of fresh blueberries. I simmered 1/2 of the blueberries on low with a teaspoon of sugar for about 10 minutes. I removed the warm berries (soft but still in berry form) from heat, and then stirred in the uncooked berries. I added the berry mixture to the top of the baked cheesecake (I did not use any fruit spread, but it would probably work just as well to place the berry mixture on top of the baked fruit spread). I took it to a Fourth of July party and it was the first thing to go. Everyone raved!

Very boring. I followed the recipe exactly. The proportion of crust to filling is off (not enough filling.) I made these to take to a family reunion but tossed them out and brought my standard brownies instead.

First time and I made a double batch: I should have thought to blend the cream cheese mixture when it didn't combine on its own, but I didn't, and the blueberry bars were lumpy. Guests still raved about them, but I was disappointed. For the second batch, I used raspberry jam (which tasted even better), and blended the cream cheese mixture until it was perfectly smooth and creamy. Absolutely fabulous! Now that I know what to do, I'm sure I'll make it again.

This recipe was amazingly easy. It is very tasty too. I used red rasberry jelly and the tartness of the jelly went well with the sweetness of the shortbread and cream cheese mixture. It was really light. I will also use the shortbread base to make other things too! I would say that 24 of these are not possible. It is too good to make that small!! I think I got about 10 out of it!!! :-) Very good!!!! Anyone can make this recipe!! Don't miss out!!

I served this dessert at a dinner party so I wanted to present it as a cheesecake. I used a spring-form pan and baked the crust as instructed. Since I couldn't find blueberry preserves I used canned blueberries in simple syrup. I pureed the blueberries, added a little cornstarch and then simmered to thicken a little. I put the cream cheese filling in the crust first and poured some of the blueberry mixture on top sporadically. I then used a knife to make a swirling paisley design.

I loved this recipe!! I used a frozen pie crust instead of the shortbread and topped with thinly sliced mangoes and whole bananas. I sprayed on plenty of non-dairy aerosol whipped topping and heaps of chocolate jimmies. I then flambeed the entire concoction using 151 rum and a Bic lighter. Superdooper!!

I made these for a dessert buffet for an art gallery opening as one of several items, using raspberry and apricot. They were very easy and tasted quite good. I did have some trouble cutting them and getting them out of the pan even after chilling - particularly with the raspberry. I will lightly grease pans next time.

These are delicious (and easy too, a requirement for a young mom)!! I made only a minor change and added more blueberry jam to the middle (following the earlier suggestions). After pouring on the "cheesecake", the top looked a little, um, white, so I dolloped blueberry jam on top and swirled it in for a very attractive top. Cooked the same amount of time. All in all I probably doubled the blueberry jam. Deeee-licious! Will definitely make again and again.

Boy, looks like most of the other reviewers didn't make this recipe, but something totally NOT this recipe. I don't know how you can review a recipe when you are completely changing it. For anyone who wants to know if THIS recipe is good, here's what I thought: I tried it twice, once with raspberry and once with strawberry preserves. I didn't change anything else at all. It was great both times. Now maybe you'll know whether you'd like to try it or not.

This recipe was delicious -- I made it with a puff pastry crust. I used an egg custard instead of the cream cheese mixture and topped it with cinnamon apples. YUMMY!

Rating: 3
Like another reviewer, I omitted the eggs/sugar/vanill and beat the jam right into the cream cheese. I topped with chopped walnuts before baking. Very good--the topping (whose flavor clearly rests on the jam you use) mixes well with the base, and by beating the cheese and jam together you have a slightly out-of-the-ordinary cheesecake topping.

I topped this with prepared blueberry filling, use the whole can (more than 3/4 cup) and I also made a graham cracker crust, double the recipe found on packaged graham cracker crumbs-YUMMY!

I used "Oregon" brand boysenberry fruit preserves, drained most of the juice out, and blended the fruit with the softened cream cheese. I was in such a hurry I completely forgot the eggs, sugar and vanilla... but no one even noticed!!! With the sweet, flaky shortbread crust the cream cheese mixture didn't need any extra sweeting. It was one of the best (and the easiest recipes) I have ever had. My family went crazy for it. The couldn't believe something so simple could be so good. It tasted and looked like I spent hours on it. A REAL winner.

Wow! These were outstanding! I made them for a pary and cut them into one inch squares. Everyone raved. I made the shortbread crust and the chessecake mixture in the food processor. It was very easy.

I made these with homemade raspberry jam, and they came out beautifully. My husband loves them; he claims they're his new favorite. I think they're better after they've chilled for a few hours--it helps them taste less like custard.

Made this twice now, once blueberry and once stawberry, both hits. Suggestion though - Cut vanilla to 1/2 tsp. and add 1 tbsp. lemon juice. As one reviewer said, this will cut down on the custard-y taste and make it more tangy like regular cheesecake.
