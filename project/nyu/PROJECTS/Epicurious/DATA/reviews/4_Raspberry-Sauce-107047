I made this sauce using kirsch and served over a lemon chiffon cake,fresh raspberries and whipped cream. It was superb.

Too sweet for me, & I thought the Kirsch too strong--it distracted from the raspberry flavor. Instead, I strained frozen raspberries (thawed, from last summer's garden) so I had about 1.5 cups raspberry "syrup," (no seeds) and pureed this with 1/2 cup granulated sugar and the juice of a small lemon. This made a thin, somewhat tart not too sweet sauce--good to serve over a simple cake or ice cream.

I did change several this recipe so I don't know about the fork rating. I used frozen raspberries which I boiled with 1/2 the sugar and Chambord I strained the misture and added the lemon juice. It was delicious, smooth and not too sweet.

Blackberries worked great. Used Chambord raspberry liquor. Served on vanilla Haagen Dazs....wicked good!

Very easy to make and delicious. I used chambord instead of kirsch or framboise and it worked very well.

This recipe was so easy! I used Chambord in place of the Kirch, and it was delicious! Keep in mind - to make straining go faster/easier, slightly warm the raspberries before pureeing them (or at least do it at room temperature).

I doubled the recipe for a dinner party of 10, served it over Haagan Dazs Vanilla with shaved dark chocolate on top. Served in crystal glasses it was beautiful and delicious! Everyone loved it!!!! This recipe is easy and delicious.... a keeper!

Delicious sauce. The frambois really brings out the flavor. I made this sauce to accompany a chocolate torte.
