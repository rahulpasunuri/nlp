It's a regular meal for me. Tips I have learned- I cook the shrimp then take them out to keep them from overcooking, and I add a pinch of red pepper flakes. Yum!

First time making this recipe. I was skeptical that adding canned tomatoes to the sauce a minute before plating would result in a rich sauce that didn't taste like...well, canned tomatoes. Instead, I sautéed two small shallots, added the garlic and chili flakes, then the vermouth, diced tomatoes, oregano, salt, and pepper and let simmer for 30 or so minutes. I then fried the shrimp separately and added to the sauce at the end along with the cream and lemon juice. The final product had great flavor, but as it is basically pasta and shrimp, was a little bland in terms of texture. I would definitely make again, but next time might add some sun-dried tomatoes or red bell peppers, too.

Substituted white wine for the vermouth and only used a tad of half and half. Used dried Italian seasoning in place of the oregano. Husband (picky!) and I both thought it was very tasty.

I forgot to reserve the pasta water, and this still turned out well. I did not have lemon, therefore substituted a splash of balsamic. Also great! A fantastic weeknight meal!

What a spectacular dish for so little effort! I agree the dish needs a bit of zip, as another reviewer mentioned, but that is easily accomplished with a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes. I finished my pasta in the sauce and, for color only, added a bit of chopped parsley.

More than the sum of its parts -- just what I look for in a recipe. Coconut milk instead of cream worked great for my non-dairy friends. Don't over-reduce the sauce -- the angel hair pasta absorbs more than you might expect.

Rating: 4
This sauce is perfect - so delicious! The only changes I made were to add a little extra garlic, and use unsweetened coconut milk in place of the heavy cream (I have a dairy allergy). I also added just about a tablespoon of flour near the end, as the sauce wasn't thickening up as much as I wanted it to. I will definitely make this again, possibly with chicken or another seafood next time. Yum!

The recipe is very good. The vermouth gives a unique flavor to it and makes it taste of high end restaurant quality. My sauce didn't thicken a lot but I'm sure if you add cornstarch (a tad) it would help the sauce not to be so runny.

I've made this recipe multiple times basically as is (extra garlic, chiles, always tomato paste) and enjoy it. When I cook for just one (I hate leftovers), I ditch the canned tomatoes and use fresh and add tomato paste. The flavors are the same. Great recipe for one

I love this recipe! It has become one of my regulars and can really feed a crowd. I tweeked it just a bit and I've had them coming back for more every time. I used a smoked olive oil instead of regular olive oil. I added italian seasonings instead of just oregano. I take my shrimp out of the pan when they were almost done and put them aside while I made the sauce. Nobody likes rubbery shrimp. My family prefers it on the spicy side, so I add crushed red pepper flakes, 1/2 to 1 1/2 tsp with the tomatoes. I add the shrimp at the last minute and let them soak up some flavor before plating everything up. I love easy, tasty recipes!!!

It is a recipe so easy, that I never would have iamgined that the result would be SO DELICIOUS!!! All my guests love it.

This was a very good recipe but not 4 forks in our book. I made the full recipe of sauce and half the shrimp and pasta for the 2 of us. The only change that I made was to use half and half instead of cream but overall it needed a little zip or intensity. I made the sauce and then added/cooked the shrimp last so as not to overcook them. That worked our perfectly.

Rating: 4
Oh my! Brilliant, and kudos to all the *very* useful suggestions (pinch of crushed chilis, more garlic). Many of you suggested removing the shrimp after browning, then adding them to the sauce at the end. My solution? I sauteed the garlic and oregano (plus one good tbsp of double concentrate tomato paste) and added all remaining ingredients. When desired consistency was achieved, I simply "poached" the shrimp in the sauce until just pink. Definite keeper and dead simple.

Rating: 4
This was so delicious and very easy to make. It went great with a simple spinach salad with a vinaigrette and a pinot grigio. The only change I made was to take the shrimp out of the sauce early while it thickened so they wouldn't overcook.

I made this for a last minute dinner (very last minute): Fast and super easy! I did omit the half and half (I was out) and thickened some 2% milk (all I had). Also, I added the crushed red pepper to taste- really did the trick if you ask me! I will make this again soon!

This was/is really good. I have a similar recipe that takes 1.5 hours to complete. This is much quicker and my wife likes the results better. Took the advice of others and added 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper. Also, partially cooked the shrimp then removed them from the pan to finish the sauce. Did not have an issue with it getting thick enough, but I did extend the time to around 10 minutes. Wonderful. She said, "Make it again."

This was delicious and so easy to make! I sauteed the shrimp in olive oil with salt, pepper, oregano, old bay seasoning, minced garlic, and crushed red pepper then removed the shrimp to a separate bowl. I made the sauce in the same pan as described simmering longer for 15 minutes, thickened the sauce with a tsp of flour, added back the cooked shrimp, and poured the entire mixture over capellini. Yum!

Rating: 4
This recipe is wonderful, with some adjustments. Like many, I added crushed red pepper. Also, to thicken the sauce it needs to simmer WAY longer than stated. But if you take the time to do it, you won't need to add anything to thicken it. I would add more tomatos next time. And also agree not to overcook the shrimp...cooked them at the last minute after marinating them in EVOO, salt, pepper, and some other seasonings. Delicious and easy!

Loved the basics of this recipe. Sauteed chopped leeks til soft first then added shrimp and canned tomatoes already seasoned with roasted garlic. Also added red pepper flakes and a little cayenne for spice! So yummy. Skipped the oregano since I didn't have any but added lots of snipped chives for color. Really delicious!

Rating: 3
Problem with this recipe is that it takes longer than one minute for sauce to thicken to the proper consistency. Therefore, in order for it to work you have to prepare the shrimp separately (otherwise shrimp will become incredibly overcooked) and then toss in at the last minute to heat through. Agree that this needs a shot of crushed red pepper. I have found that two generous tablespoons of tomato paste does the trick creating a thick and creamy sauce.

I love this dish- it always impresses people. I made several changes: added small chunks of zucchini and thinly sliced leeks at the beginning (because this crowded the skillet somewhat I sauteed the shrimp separately then added it along w/ the vermouth), also fresh parsley, paprika, plenty of crushed red pepper, lemon juice, and some parmesan cheese. Because this is a real calorie bomb, I always use either half & half or a combination of it w/milk, then stir in a little flour at the end to thicken it. It is still really rich without the cream- delicious and quick!

Great base recipe! Be sure to have the water boiling for your pasta before making the shrimp and sauce because this recipe comes together really fast. I followed others advice and added red pepper flakes to the sauce and sauteed the shrimp with alittle white wine and bay seasoning. Added some minced garlic, shallots and oregano to the sauce along with the juice from half a lemon to help thicken it up alittle faster. It was a real hit and so so easy to make. Definitely going to make this more!

Really yummy! I did fettucine instead of capellini but I don't think that it matters what type of pasta you use. I think all kinds would have the same great taste! The only real change I made was to add some red chile flakes.

Rating: 4
Tasty, fast, easy, and calls for ingredients I usually have in the pantry and freezer. I added some red chile flakes to punch it up a little, and next time I make it I'll try creme fraiche instead of heavy cream, to thicken it up a little. Dolin Vermouth Rouge - killer in a Manhattan, also excellent in this sauce!

Rating: 4
This was a wonderful recipe that I will serve to company in the future. The vermouth is the key to the flavor in the sauce. My preteen children tolerated it but my teen loved it. I did add some red pepper flakes as recommended by previous reviewers and served it over linguine rather than capellini.

Very good, but as other readers suggested, needs a little "kick". A healthy dash of crushed red peppers and topping it with feta or fresh parm gave it the extra flavor it needed to put it over the top.

Took this up a couple notches by adding 1/2 - 3/4 teaspoon of crushed red paper and substituted white rice for capellini (with madras curry sprinkled and mixed in for some added color). F-A-B-U-L-O-U- S if you are looking to give it some kick.

I REALLY wanted to love this dish but there was no real wow factor for me. My husband, on the other hand, loved it so I will keep it in my repertoire and play around with the recipe a little bit the next time I make it. Did anyone have any trouble thickening the sauce? That was my main complaint.

So easy to make, its perfect for weekday cooking. I used the called- for sweet vermouth and used linguini instead of capellini. As Ironsidek recommended, I added red pepper flakes and took the shrimp out after cooking them and added them in just as I was serving. Would do quite well, I think, served meatless or with chicken instead of shrimp. Both my husband and I quite liked this unexpected and flavorful dish.

Rating: 0
I, like my partner, was skeptical of the sweet vermouth but it really made this meal so do not leave it out or substitute it! I halved the recipe and made a few small changes: fettucine instead of capellini; I added red pepper flakes; I used the immersion blender on the tomatoes (just one pulse); and I used four garlic cloves. I also took the shrimp out after cooking them and added them at the end to toss, so that they did not get overcooked. I'll be making this again.

Rating: 4
This recipe is fantastic and is on the roster to be a "go to". It's delicious as is, or a great base for modification: Throwing in some spinach or swapping out the shrimp for chicken, are both great options. Also, frozen peeled shrimp from Trader Joes works great in this. **As for the recipe itself** the only major modification I'd do has been mentioned before: anticipate longer cooking time for the sauce by pulling out the shrimp while the sauce is made. Admittedly, I haven't gotten the sauce consistency perfect quite yet, but that should only take one more try. The first time I made it, it was incredibly runny; the second time a tad too thick. So, I recommend holding on to some of the pasta water so you've got something to work with if you over-cook it. Two other points, with regard to the sauce consistency: Adding the lemon juice thickens it a bit, so don't skimp. Letting it sit for a couple minutes does as well. Beyond that, my only modifications are to give each plate an extra squirt of lemon and a bit of chopped fresh parsley before serving. Store leftover pasta and sauce together; the pasta will sop up the sauce, and everything will taste twice as good the next day.

This is a delicious sauce that takes so little time to prepare. The vermouth ingredient is key to making the taste very special. You don't need to add shrimp; add anything you want, or nothing! It's great just simply over pasta with a sprinkle of cheese and fresh ground pepper. It makes a great first course with capellini or thin spaghetti.

This gets four forks for being as quick as the recipe says while tasting great. Like other reviewers I went heavy with the garlic. I had only sherry and will need to get vermouth to try next. This was very tasty and popular with the family.

This was a nice, quick dinner. If I was to make it again, though, I would probably double the tomatoes and maybe add some tomato paste. Maybe even a drop of sundried tomato paste. We doubled the garlic, which was good, and we added parsley, which I would definitely recommend. We also found that we needed about half of the heavy cream. I might also use wine or sherry instead of vermouth.

I really enjoy this recipe and agree that if you don't use the vermouth, you should not review this. There is nothing that tastes the same as the vermouth and you shouldn't misdirect other cooks. That being said, this is a super quick and easy recipe. I usually cook my shrimp at the very end because I can't stand overcooked shrimp, but other than that I pretty much follow the directions. I am intrigued by the thought of adding basil and may do that when I make it this weekend.

I was looking for an easy recipe for my pound of shrimp and this did the trick. The flavors really come together nicely. As usual, I loaded up on garlic. Per another reviewer, I removed the cooked shrimp to further reduce the sauce and put it back in about 2-3 minutes later. Very yummy!

Good, quick dinner for family. Like others I did a little variation from recipe. I used Sherry since I did not have vermouth (next time). Did quick saute of green peppers and onions, then took them out and did shrimp and removed it before making sauce. Added peppers/onions and shrimp back in right before serving. Since I was in a hurry I made a little roux with flour and the garlic/olive oil before adding liquids. This way I did not have to wait for boiling down. Used whole milk which worked fine and added a little red pepper flakes and tomoato paste. Family loved it and it was fast.

I think this recipe has great potential, but as soon as I added the cream, the sauce curdled. Anyone know what I'm doing wrong? I ended up straining out the sauce, adding the shrimp and tomatoes back in with a little pasta water, and it was okay - nice flavor. But I'd like to know what I'm doing wrong!

I don't know about Paul Grimes's superkitchen but I couldn't reduce 1/2 cup vermouth and 3/4 of a cup of heavy cream in 3 mins... I am using gas burners and it took much longer. I thought this recipe was just ok. A bit too sweet for my taste and lacking in zip.

Very quick and easy to make! And it tastes wonderful too! I made this with sweet sherry instead of vermouth, lime instead of lemon and without the shrimp (bf hates shrimp... unfortunately).

As others have stated this is a lovely and easy dish to prepare. I totally agree that cayenne pepper be added and less vermouth. I used 1/4 cup of vermouth and that was plenty.

This was VERY simple and pretty good. Used medium frozen shrimp from Costco. Added a bit of red pepper flakes and extra garlic to give a little more zing.

Would probably add additional veggies next time though.

I made this pretty much as the recipe says, except I had time to let it reduce for a while--about an hour while I made the rest of the meal.

It may have been the sweet vermouth I had on hand (which I admit was not the best), but the flavor in this dish was not especially balanced. The alcohol over-powered the tomatoes, and it tasted odd with the cream. I think the recipe is good in theory, but I also think it would be a lot better with a can of crushed tomatoes which would make it a little saucier.

I followed the recipe as written. It smelled divine, but, as others have noted, the flavor was a bit bland and the sauce quite thin (in spite of reducing it far longer than the recipe suggests.) It is definitely good enough to make again, but I'll add some red pepper flakes or Old Bay, more thoroughly drain the tomatoes, and substitute half & half to cut the fat. I'll also probably use a more substantial pasta, or serve in bowls without pasta along with good, crusty bread to sop with.

I've tried a ton of recipes and this is one of the best. It is very versatile. Because I like "spice" I used blackened seasoning on the shrimp. I removed the shrimp once it was almost cooked through then continued to add the sauce ingredients (add the shrimp back just before serving to be sure it's cooked through). I added a small can of sliced black olives, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes. I was cooking for a crowd so I doubled the recipe. I used 1.5 lbs of shrimp, 2 lbs of chix breast (cooked separately also w/ blackened seasoning) and 1 lb of mini bowtie pasta. It was awesome...not a drop left! Served with a mixed green salad w/ fresh strawberries and Italian bread!

There is no reason to add cream to this recipe. I prefer ricotta mixed into the sauce and throughly combined. You get the same lactic mouth feel and can control the fat by controlling the ricotta from skin to full fat.

This was delicious! The vermouth definitely adds a unique flavor. You can't beat this for a tasty and quick weeknight dinner. I did add red pepper flakes and fresh basil and gave the shrimp a good coating with Old Bay, as another reviewer recommended. I left the shrimp in, but they weren't overdone because I got jumbo Gulf shrimp, so they take a bit longer to cook.

This was great -- and so quick and easy. I doubled the recipe because a 1/2 lb of pasta doesn't go far in my house. I only used about 3/4 c of the vermouth, however, because I chickened out and was afraid it would be too sweet. It still had the hint of sweetness but I don't think the full cup would have ruined it. I also used San Marzano tomatoes and next time I will probably add another can -- delicious. No need to reserve the water in my case. Sauce was quite thin enough.

Added the vermouth, tomatoes, and cream to pan and simmered for about 5-8 min, then added salt, lemon juice and about 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese. simmered a bit more. Sauce lightly covered all the noodles and the shrimp added some kick. Very tasty.

We loved this recipe. The sauce was a bit thin and could use reducing but be careful not to over cook the shrimp. I think that the red pepper mentioned by others could be a nice addition and give it a bit of a kick. I used Italian diced tomatoes and drained well. I think that it would also be nice sauce with chicken and basil.

I would agree with those who say this is a little bland. I added 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes and it still needed something. Maybe fresh basil? I've had better with less fat.

I made this recipe this week and it was a hi with my family. The only change I made was to remove the shrimp after sauteing and added them back with the cream to avoid over-cooking the shrimp.

Delicious. Marinated the shrimp in olive oil, garlic a little sea salt and a squeeze of lemon for about 15 minutes. Added red pepper flakes to the sauce and topped with chopped Italian parsley.

Great taste for such an easy, quick recipe. Not sure why other reviewers described this as bland. I will say, however, that it tasted better on the second day. I chose to buy pre-cooked shrimp and let them marinate in the garlic, oil, oregano mix then added them right before serving. I also spent an extra 10 minutes reducing the sauce because otherwise it is a bit too watery. Overall, a tasty recipe I will certainly make again.

The sauce was thin, even though I added some thickening flour, the overall taste was rather bland. Pepper flakes would have been a good addition per another viewers suggestion. I don't think I would cook this again.....

I just made this dish and found it to be quite good. The sauce was a little too thin. Next time I will add a tablespoon of flour with the shrimp. Should make it perfect!

Perfection!!! I added some pancetta and a dash of pepper flakes also, fresh Italian parsley at the end. Delicious!

To enhance the flavor, I heated the cream with 1/2 cup of Pecorino grated cheese before adding it to the tomato sauce.

Fabulous!! I made it last night using tilapia because we were out of shrimp. The vermouth was the deal-sealer. The flavors were well- nuanced. Very easy too.
