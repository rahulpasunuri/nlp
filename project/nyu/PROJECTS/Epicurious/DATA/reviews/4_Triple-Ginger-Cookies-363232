Nice & chewy. Ginger-y, but not overpoweringly so. I wonder if it's really worth using 3 forms of ginger, though, as the cookies really just taste like good ginger cookies. The crystallized ginger doesn't really come through.

Fantastic, surprisingly light cookie. Everyone loved them.

Well, I have to eat my words here. My family LOVED these cookies and could not stop eating them. They were light and crunchy with zingy ginger flavor.

This is a rehash of a B.A. recipe I had in my recipe box from several years ago (as I discovered AFTER I made them). Mine, which had butter and brown sugar in it, with lots more crystallized ginger, was superior to this one. These are very good, but not over the top. Using a level teaspoonful for each cookie, this recipe makes at least 8 dozen cookies. And if you do use a teaspoonful per cookie, bake for only 11 minutes or the cookies will be burned.
