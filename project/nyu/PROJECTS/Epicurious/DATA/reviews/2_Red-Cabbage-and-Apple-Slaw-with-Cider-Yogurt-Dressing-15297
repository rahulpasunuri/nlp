After tasting the salad, my husband added some sugar as he too thought it wasn't sweet enough. That made a big improvement. I think using sweeter apples next time would also help. Was great the next day in a grilled panini with some chicken.

Yuck. Too much effort for what it was...

It was very good, but lacked something. Needs more sweetness, but overall a great recipe. Turns very purple over a couple of days!

I found this recipe so-so, but my guests adored it. The yoghurt overwhelmed the apple-cider flavor, so I added about 1 1/2 tsp. of apple cider vinegar to the dressing before combining it. It was better the next day, actually, and the color of the apples was not affected by time. On the third day, I stirred a little sour cream into my portion, which I think I ought to have done from the first! It made it wonderfully creamy, and the flavors bonded better.
