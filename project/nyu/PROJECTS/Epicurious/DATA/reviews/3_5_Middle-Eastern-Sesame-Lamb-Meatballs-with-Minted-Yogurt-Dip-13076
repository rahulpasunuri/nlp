Nearly tasteless. Did my test meatball and good thing I had what I needed. I doubled the allspice + 1/2 tsp cumin and coriander coriander(ground today)+black and cayenne pepper, garlic and onion powders, marjoram+cilantro leaves (dislike mint w/meat) Test #2--SCORE! Plan to serve with tzatziki sauce. I love it my way!

The meatballs were perfect. I did not roll in sesame seeds and they were still delicious. The mint dip was bland. Next time I will find an alternate dip to use. I served the meatballs alongside egg noodles and it made the perfect meal!

These were teriffic! Used at a party last night with wooden small forks in them "lollipop" style - big hit! I will omit the rolling in sesame seeds next time - it is too many seeds for one bite. May sprinkle a few on top, but the half I did without seeds were much better than the half with. Sauce is great also - used chopped raisins instead of currants and doubled the spices as several recommend.

Wow, what a knockout! These were fantastic. My minor substitutions: I used dried whole wheat bread crumbs, and I couldn't find currants, so I used raisins that I diced up. I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of allspice and cinnamon. I used tzatziki sauce from trader joes instead of making the sauce, but I enjoyed them a lot without any sauce. The depth of flavors was awesome, without any one flavor being too overpowering. The taste was exotic without being too "out there" for mainstream palettes. I love the idea to mix black and white sesame seeds together.

have been looking forward to making these for a long time, and they were wonderful and easy. made them as the recipie said, and yes, everyone was right(reviewers) up the spices. i did use only white sesame seeds, and i did lightly toast them, but not enough, that was my only dissapointment. anyway, a fun fun recipie !!!

Nice twist on lamb meatballs. I doubled the spices as others recommended and substituted 1/2 cup oatmeal for the breadcrumbs as one of my friends can't eat wheat. I ground the oats in the food processor and soaked them in milk to cover for 10 minutes before proceeding with the recipe. Everyone in the group loved them. The yoghurt/mint sauce is great! Save time and use Greek yoghurt--no need to drain.

Loved these - the spices were great. I listened to the reviews & went up in all spices but next time I would add even more salt. I did only white sesame seeds and they were fine, but don't forget to toast them, I did unfortunately. I also soaked the bread crumbs in milk so they were super moist.

Rating: 4
Both the meatballs and yogurt sauce were delicious!! Based on other reviews I slightly increased the amount of spices and decreased the amount of bread crumbs. I liked the sesame seeds - they added flavor and made the meatballs look more attractive. I'll definitely be making this again for dinner.

I did not use sesame seeds, allspice or currants, and substituted curry powder - the recipe was a HIT, especially with our young children. All the kids gobbled them up.

I served these meatballs at a cocktail party over the weekend and people really seemed to like them. As another reviewer suggested, I mixed white and black seeds instead of having some meatballs all-white or all-black. I agree that the seasonings in the meat mixture need to be increased, and that the amount of breadcrumbs should be reduced. I also agree with the reviewer who suggested baking the meatballs on a rack: it lets the fat run off and encourages even browning.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful recipe, however, the spices need to be at least doubled. I also add fresh garlic to the minted yogurt dip.

i honestly can't say enough good things about these - they are phenomenal. i usually skip the sesame seed coating, so, fyi, they are even terrific without.

These were pretty good. I doubled the cinnamon and allspice, but will follow the recipe next time, maybe using even less spices than called for. I also added toasted ground coriander, but couldn't taste it over the cinnamon. The yogurt dip really saved it!

very good. moist and flavorful. I added in roasted coriander too which added a nice depth.

I love this recipe! Only I make it way simpler. I leave out the currants and the sesame seeds. It is super quick and easy. I serve it with some rice pilaf and hummus. It is an easy family pleaser.

Rating: 4
again, reviewed several comments prior to trying... agree that spices underestimated. tried doubling them for first attempt, not bad, but will definitely triple next time. Will not bother with black sesame in this instance, and will be sparing with the whites, which MUST BE TOASTED. The yogurt sauce is a must. Allow the full 3 + hours for separating whey. Makes a difference. Still a fave that will definitely become a family staple. :)

I love all kinds of meatballs, and these are no exception. The recipe serves 4 people generously. I used fresh mint instead of dried and omitted the currants. The appearance of meatballs with some rolled in black sesame seeds and the others rolled in white sesame seeds was attractive, but the ones in white sesame seeds tasted better in my view.

Rating: 4
We make this recipe all the time & we love it. You can sub only white sesame seeds or chopped pine nuts or pistachios. We serve with 'fatoosh salad' & rice pilaf made w/ vermicelli, which is great with the yogurt sauce. Don't skimp on the salt in the sauce & add EVOO to it. It also makes terrific burgers (grilled with a square of feta tucked inside or goat cheese on top) on pita or buns. Can also make smaller as apps! Never tire of this one.

Rating: 3
Lots of promise. I upped the spice level and it still needed some oompf. Next time I would definately add significantly more spice and let the mix sit overnight first. The sesame seeds seemed superfluous.

Rating: 4
the meatballs also work well with a pomegranate sauce and yogurt

A little too dry if you follow the recipe exactly, so I would add another egg or some water, or maybe fewer breadcrumbs the next time. I also subbed golden raisins for currants because that's what I had and it was delicious.

Very easy, quick recipe, which you can make ahead.( The yoghurt sauce is a must!) Guests were fighting over the last meatballs. I added Cinnamon, nutmeg and a bit of tomato concentrate.

This recipe is okay. As one reviewer suggested, I doubled the spices. If I make it again I would triple them. The yogurt sauce needed more zip too. I would add harissa.

Rating: 0
Wow - is this a great recipe! Easy to make and everybody loves it. The meatballs are really moist and light. I made them exactly as written (a rarity for me) and I feel no need to alter anything in the meatballs for the future. I love tzizki though, so I used that rather than the yogurt dip listed here.

Rating: 4
Made these as written including the dip. They were delish as is but I can see that you could make some of the changes others have suggested and still be great. I wouldn't skip the dip though. I made them once and served with a tzaziki sauce and the sauce overpowered the meatballs. The yogurt dip is a good match for these.

These meatballs have become one of my specialties. They are delicious and easy. The sesame seeds really arent' necessary. Try some with and without. I also tried them with poppy seeds once, which was interesting.

As others have said, forget the sesame seeds - they don't contribute anything and my guests spent the evening with toothpicks as everyone had them stuck in their teeth. Definintely double all the spices. Will make again, but this these variations.

We loved these as a main course, served with a middle eastern rice pilaf. I just sprinkled a few white sesame seeds on top, and they worked out just fine. I used cilantro rather than mint in the yogurt sauce--tasty.

Rating: 4
This recipe was fantastic - and much easier than it seems at first glance. We made it from start to finish with our company over (with 5 kids under 5 running around). The minted yogurt dip can be used for days afterward on lots of things (eggs, mashed potatoes).We will definitely make this recipe again.

I just finished making these for a Christmas cocktail party and am worried about how they will be received. The black sesame seeds look like the meatballs have been burned-and the overall lamb taste is VERY strong. Perhaps I used the"wrong" ground lamb. I would definitely NOT use the black sesame seeds if I made this again-though I think the white add a nice crunch contrast with the meat--if your like lamb. As they say in the movies, "kind of a mixed bag."

Rating: 3
I used beef, I am sure lamb will be better. I made the meatballs bigger and cooked them longer. I used half the white sesame seeds and mixed them in. I used half the panko crumbs, and then I lightly rolled the meatballs in the panko crumbs. The rack worked well. The yogurt sauce was a nice contrast.

Rating: 4
I was hesitant to make these for a recent party because I wasn't sure how much people really liked lamb. Well...they were a huge hit and I even received complaints when they were all gone. I put two small (appetizer sized) meatballs on a 6 inch skewer. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but next time I will try to add more spices, currants, etc. I also mixed the black and white sesame seeds which was pretty, but I agree, not very necessary to the recipe. I would definitely make these again!

Rating: 4
I love these epicurious recipes where everyone has their own take and almost everyone loved it. I'm not different. I used chopped walnuts and craisins (couldn't find currants). One tip: put the meatballs on a wire rack over a sheet pan: they brown all over and don't stick!

Rating: 3
Yummy and easy. As usual, the reviewers on this site are right on. We doubled the amount of mint, allspice, cinnamon, garlic and currants; skipped the sesame seeds; used half the amount of bread crumbs; mixed a quarter cup of pine nuts in with the meat mixture; added some chopped green onions, garlic and chopped dill to the yogurt.

These were delicious and just like Kofta from Egypt and the Middle East. I made them with the sesame seeds but they really aren't necessary. Served them with plain (good) yogurt - will try adding mint and garlic to the yogurt next time.

My friends loved these meatballs. I made them a week ahead of time and baked them and froze them. Next time I will make ahead of time and not bake them till right before serving them. To the yogurt sauce I add about 2T. dill, lemon, 2 cloves garlic and chopped green onion let it sit overnight it was great everyone used it with the balls!

I only made the meatballs not the minted yogurt dip. The meatballs were delicious. I love lamb and I'm always looking for new things to do with it. I will definately make this again next time with the yogurt dip.

INCREDIBLE! Made these for a party and was worried as I never have served lamb on a buffet table. I had tidbits of everything left EXCEPT the lamb balls! People kept asking for more. They were a hit! An easy recipe and great presentation with the different colored seeds!

I skipped the sesame seeds and baked them for almost 20 minutes (I turned them once so they were golden brown on two sides). Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. They were super easy and were gone within minutes at a neighborhood potluck so I'll definitely make them again.

delicious! i made these lamb meatballs using twice the amount of garlic, added in some pounded birds-eye chillies, no sesame, used fresh chopped mint, and err... i FRIED them. they came out charred and crunchy outside and meltingly smooth on the inside ooh. served these with the yogurt dip (averagy), tomato chutney and homemade chapati (an indian type of bread). i followed the advice of reviewers and added extra raisins plus some minced garlic into the dip. both were good calls! will definitely do these fantastic meatballs again (in fact i have some extra meatballs shivering in my fridge as we speak and i will EAT them as soon as i'm done with this review).

Delicious!! I use Labne, which is middle eastern strained yogurt, and is sold at Whole Foods. And, instead of sesame seeds, try pine nuts! The left-overs are great.

We really liked this combination. It was easy to make and relatively quick. We had it as part of a middle eastern dinner and I made the meatballs a little bigger.Making them little, they would make a great appetizer for a party also. We'll do this one again soon.

These were a hit for my cocktail party, but the yogurt dip was untouched. Would suggest another dip or serving the meatballs alone.

Great change from regular meatballs. Brought it to a dinner party and everyone loved it. Sauce is OK, might try suggestion of more garlic next time. Meatballs are excellent just the way suggested.

I thought the sauce for this was ok, not great. I too added garlic, but felt it still lacked.

i love this recipe! honestly restaurant quality. the only changes i made, after my second time preparing these, was using half the amount of breadcrumbs (too crumbly the first time) and adding one large garlic clove, minced, to the yogurt dip.

I brought these to a dinner party and got more credit than I deserved. Recipe is quite easy and the product was great. I didn't have currants and subbed dates. They were still great. I am not a sesame seed fan so only did half with seeds. Most people prefered no sesame. Dip was too easy to be that good!

Everybody loves meatballs. These meatballs looked like they wished they were breads! The sesame seeds were not successful with meat I thought. For lamb dishes may be "less is more".

Rating: 3
I made this dish for a Middle-Eastern themed dinner and it was a hit. People thought the mint yogurt was so amazing with the meatballs and it couldn't have been easier. The only thing I noticed is that ground lamb tends to be fatty and I would suggest draining it a little.

Rating: 4
Have made this several times for large gatherings and always have received rave reviews. I have only used white sesame seeds and have blended them in with the meat rather that rolling them-less work! The last time, the store didn't have enough lamb, so I ended up using about 1/3 beef with 2/3 lamb, and was still great!

This dish was easy to make and tasty. The only thing i would do different is to add more of the allspice and cinnamon, and more currents to make sure there is some in every meatball.
