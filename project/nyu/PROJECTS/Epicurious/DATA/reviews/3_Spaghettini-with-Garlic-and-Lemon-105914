This was delicious with a serious kick from the red pepper flakes. We used fresh pasta and added cherry tomatoes, which were a nice sweet/tart counterbalance to the spiciness.

This was nice (with grilled shrimp and broccolini which I sauteed in the sauce), but reminded me so much of spaghettini with clams that I was kicking myself for not adding clam juice to give it an extra zing. I'll make it again doing just that.

simple, exceptionally easy, and delicious. wonderful after a long day at work when time is tight. fresh ingredients (no bottled lemon juice or dried parsley!) are the key to this. drained white beans added at the end add extra fiber.

This is one of my favourite meals for a busy day-- it's quick, easy, and I almost always have the necessary ingredients. I tend to add another tablespoon of lemon juice and another two or three garlic cloves.

My family really enjoys this pasta. To make it more kid friendly, I skip the red pepper and it is still good. I do add more garlic than called for....more like 6 large cloves.

I thought this was a wonderful side dish. For those that think it is too bland you might want to serve it with a main entree that is very flavorful. I made it with Parmesan Chicken and the whole meal was ready in 15 minutes so it is my new "too tired to cook after a hard day at the office" meal.

I would make this again, but with modifications. It was a light and refreshing pasta dish - but lacked flavor. Our kids ate it. We added parmesan cheese which helped. Next time I will consider adding feta, spinach and maybe some canellini beans.

it was alright, not great. i thought it was a little bland and i must have gone nuts with the pepper flakes because it was SPICY! my mouth was numb! i don't think i'll make this one anymore.

This was alright, not incredible. Very lemony. I reduced the oil by a lot though so maybe that was my problem.

Perfect comfort food. This is now in my list of emergency dinners par excellence! It's almost even better cold the next day, so make plenty.

Amazing. My company loved this and my kids beg me to make it over and over. The hot pepper is a bit too much, so I would definitely add just a bit and then taste before adding more. You absolutely must use fresh lemon zest. It adds great flavor.

We made this dish along with Baked Flounder w/ Tomato and Caper Sauce and it was yummy. If you want, just add 2 cans of artichokes to the sauce while it's simmering and grated parmesan right before serving.

Well, after all the whining about lemon, and oil, and pepper et al, I really was beginning to wonder about this dish but I made it tonight and we loved it. I added small baby eggplants which I sautéed in the oil and garlic and they were delicious.

i agree with other reviewers who suggest omitting the salt and adding a little parmesan at the end. otherwise a fine dish to make when simplicity is key.

Rating: 3
Thought this dish was fab as a side dish (although not quite right for what I paired it with...two strong flavors competing) and would definitely make it again. Very tasty (lot of complaints about too lemony, don't make it if you don't like lots of lemon) and easy and healthy. I will try cilantro instead of parsley next time, and a bit more hot pepper. Yum!!

This was DELICIOUS. I divided this recipe in half to serve two. Used 3/8 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes and increased the garlic to 3 cloves. Also decreased the oil for sautéing and omitted any salt in the sauce. Added 1/2 lb. of pre-cooked shrimp and grated Parmesan cheese. The mixture needed a good 1 cup of chicky broth/pasta cooking liquid to thin it. Next time I would add more lemon juice. This turned out a bit hot, but we have learned to like that since moving here from Northern Illinois. Overall, a mildly flavored, but very good dish.

Recipe turned out well. Made one minor change by using the dill I had on hand in place of the parsley. Next time I'll use a bit more lemon juice. Would be great with grilled shrimp or salmon. And best of all it is easy easy easy.

I sauteed a finely diced onion, then added twice as much garlic. This is a great recipe for those days when the cupboard is nearly bare!

My whole family loves this. We also make it with bowtie pasta and serve it cold as a salad.

I actually made this recipe twice. I followed it to the letter both times, except the second time I made it I omitted the the salt. The first time I made it I thought it was good, but WOW way too much salt! Since I already salt the water to cook the pasta and I also put Parmesan cheese, (which has a lot of salt) on the finished product, putting anymore in the recipe was just over the top. The results were much better the second time around.

This is a great recipe with one exception, too much olive oil. I substituted the olive oil with butter--also tried 1/8 C butter and 1/8 C olive oil. Extra Virgin goes a long way.

This was so easy and quick! To cut the lemon flavor a little(which I love but my hubby is tepid on)I swirled in 1-2 TBS butter and a little more water. I also added a little shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano at the end. I think that some sliced fresh mushrooms would go well with this, too. Will definitely make again.

We also found it to be much too heavy on the lemon. I suppose you could cut the amount of lemon back, but I'd probably just go with a different recipe altogether.

I liked this recipe real well with the substitutions and changes I made. Instead of parsley, I used basil. Where it said to use finely grated zest, I used coarse.

My son and I made this recipe, we were not impressed. After it was completed we tryed it and found it tasted to much of lemon. I even added some heavy cream I had to try to improve the taste, to no avail.

Nice, simple 'dressing' for the spaghetti. We served it with braised chicken with olives (also from this website).

This pasta did have an odd taste. Five minutes is a long time to saute garlic, I overdid it, and it turned a little brown. This may have affected the finished product. I see almost everyone who liked it made significant changes. Next time I would make a classic oil and garlic recipe instead.

Rating: 3
I've made this recipe twice and really enjoyed it both times. I used angel hair pasta in lieu of the spaghettini and added about 1 lb. of small shrimp sauteed with the garlic (5 cloves) and red pepper. I didn't use nearly as much oil as the recipe calls for--I used about a tablespoon to saute the garlic, pepper and shrimp. I also tossed everything with fresh grated Parmesan which added a great touch to the meal.

Rating: 1
This recipe was awful! One of my dinner guests dubbed it "painful pasta". This was because it was very bland but because of the red pepper flakes it had a spicy, burning aftertaste. Do not make this recipe, spare yourself.

We are lovers of all types of pasta in my house, but I have to say that this particular dish was deemed as "tasting like lemon Pledge smells". It was not well received, therefore I can't imagine ever forcing my daughter to choke it down again. Have you other people TASTED this dish? Perhaps applying the pasta to my furniture would have been more helpful. My "one fork" rating was only because "no forks" wasn't an option. sorry.

So quick and easy - AND most of the ingredients are already in your pantry! Simple and delicious - I threw some shrimp in and served with a salad...prefect. Adding it to my recipe box right now.

I simply loved this recipe! Granted, I added extra hot pepper, garlic and lemon zest and it was delicious! My whole family enjoyed it, including my picky 7 yr. old, and I served it with the Parmesan Chicken from this site too. Will definitely make again.

This was fantastic. I would never have imagined that simply adding lemon juice and peel to the traditional "pasta with garlic and pepper" would result in something this extraordinary. I served it with the Braised Chicken with Tomatoes and Olives as recommended and it even raised that recipe's mediocrity to acceptable company fare level. This simple pasta dish will now be part of my favoured culinary repertoire exactly "as is". No tinkering required.

I was passed this recipe from a friend of mine. She is a very good cook and I worried that the dish would be difficult and not accepted at my house. I was wrong. My husband asks me to make this all the time.

I have made this recipe several times and it gets two thumbs up from the critics in my household. I disagree that it is not lemony enough. No. 1 chop chop!

I used fresh jalepenos but this lacked the punch it needed. I felt this was not lemony enough. Not a keeper.

I thought this was a very good dish as a main dish. I used a little bit more red pepper flakes than the recipe called for, which gave it a nice little kick. It was very good with a salad for a light dinner.

This didn't have enough flavor to stand up on its own, but made a good side dish for chicken with a flavorful sauce. I used spinach fettucini, and substituted crushed aleppo pepper for the red pepper flakes. I used plenty of lemon and didn't find it too strong at all.

Simple and delicious! Who would have thought you can make spaghetti so sexy? Like the previous review, I used a microplane for the lemon and am sure it enhances the overall dish. Also had it with the Swordfish with Salmoriglio Sauce. Superb pairing.

My husband and I loved this dish. It's easy, spicy, and lemony. I even added a little extra lemon. I used an imported pasta and a microplane grater for the lemon rind, which both make a big diference in the outcome.

This had great potential, garlic, lemons, how can you go wrong? I do not have a clue why it did not work, I could not taste the lemon, and my child, who loves pasta of any kind including a boiled noodle, complained that it had too much lemon. Interestingly enough, I was using a bottled salad dressing for a salad, Creamy Parmesan Pepper, my husband poured it over his pasta as well and suggested we do the same, it was fantastic! I guess that is a simple statement that this recipe needs something more.

Rating: 3
I didn't think this was boring. It's a great side dish exactly as written. I served it with Swordfish with Salmoriglio Sauce on this website - Yum. I'm sure it would be good with shrimp or other additions, but it's a good dish as is.

Rating: 2
Quite disappointing. Note that everyone who liked it added something, like shrimp. As written, it seems to be missing "something". Maybe some sun-dried tomatoes, chicken, or parmesan? It has potential, but as it is here, it's pretty boring.

Rating: 3
Couldn't resist adding a few anchovy filets and a palmful of chopped capers to the mix. Both melt into the sauce beautifully. Also, a glug of good quality olive oil over the top, just before serving, adds a wonderful moistness and fragrance.

Made this with prawns. Very fast, very good and it had a light feel to it which is a nice change from the heavier cream sauces I lean towards in winter.

This is the best recipe I have gotten from this site so far! Easy, delicious, and great as is or with additions. I used one third cup instead of a half cup of olive oil, and also added shrimp. The recipe was equally good as a side dish or with chicken.

This dish made our Saturday night! I substituted chicken broth for the pasta water (I accidentally drained it all away), used linguine for the spaghetti and added 1/2 pound of shrimp. I just wish I would have had some fresh bread to soak up the left over sauce.

Quick easy and delicious! We added shrimp to the oil, garlic and hot pepper flakes and cooked them just until the tails curled. Used more garlic and more hot pepper and black pepper. Only used two Tbsp. lemon juice and may use less oil next time, the noodles seemed pretty oily. Definately a keeper!

This was good. I added some pine nuts and parm. cheese. Next time I will try the goat cheese and maybe some veggies to make it more of a main dish.

Interesting flavours, if a bit too lemony for me... I also upped the amount of garlic--one can never have too much garlic. I served it with the Parmesan Chicken (also in this issue of the mag), and thought it went superbly.

Simple and delicious! This takes no time and effort, but tastes like it does. And the person who suggested the goat cheese was so, so right. This makes is quite rich, but the lemon sort-of balances that. This is going to beome a standard dish for me.

So simple, quick and easy. I used a lot less lemon zest and juice. Would have been too lemony for my taste. I also used butter in addition to the olive oil for a buttery richness. A sprinkling of Parmesan made it the perfect pasta dish. Would be great with grilled chicken or fish.

I omitted the water, and there was too much lemon flavor. Would probably omit the lemon altogther.

Very, very easy. Would've been great with shrimp. I added some mushrooms to give it some add'l "meat." Also eased off the lemon as well -- didn't need any more than 1 lemon's worth of zest.

Have made this again and again, it's easy, it's a great starting place to grow a meal out of. Goat cheese is our favorite. Learn to cook, learn to eat and you'll learn to love life.

This is the template for one of my favorite meals. I use basil instead of parsley and throw in other stuff when I have it, like sundried tomatoes or roasted red peppers. For a side dish, though, I would keep it simple. I like to skimp on the oil a bit so it's nice and dry and starchy. For a main dish, toss it with goat cheese--then it is really orgasmic.

This recipe is very similar to Spaghetti Limoncello(Gourmet 11/97)which is delicious. That recipe also includes anchovies, a nice addition, and less olive oil. The dish is easy and delicious, and makes a great side dish for Chilean sea bass. Highly recommended.

Since my wife is allergic to wheat products I decided to use spaghetti squash in lieu of the pasta. It turned out great! Microwaved a small spaghetti squash and cut the remaining ingredients by half. Was sensational with the Chicken w/ tomatoes and olives. Also condusive to preparing ahead of time and reheating right before serving. I'll do it again.
