I fixed 1 acorn, 2 tbsp of oil, 1 tbsp honey and 2 tbsp of balsamic, sprinkled red pepper flakes My wife and I thought it was great! We will definitely have it again. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was a disappointment. I much prefer the old simple version of: bake, add butter, brown sugar and nutmeg.The sweet,tangy and pepper combination seemed like a good idea but the balance was all wrong.

This is a great and easy recipe. I didn't have peperoncini and used red chili flakes as others suggested. Will try to come up with something really special for the leftover.

Did not think the flavors came together at all.

Yum. I love this because of the lack of sweetness.

3 forks for a great idea, but I did tweak it. I used grapeseed oil b/c its lighter taste doesn't detract from the others. I quartered the squash, rubbed them with oil & gave a very light sprinkle with kosher salt. I modified the glaze with chili oil vs. flakes and added a bit of fresh lime juice. I glazed every 10-15 minutes to keep the squash soft. After letting it cool a bit I scraped the flesh from the skin and mashed it with a fork. This makes a terrific warm dip on its own but I have also served it side-by-side with fresh or aged goat cheese and a hearty cracker or blue tortilla chips. Favorite fresh goat cheese is from Harley Farms in Pescadero, CA or the aged one from Humboldt Fog. wow...

Very very good! I added additional chili peppers and it was phenomenal!

I made this recipe tonight for 2 very picky eaters. One of them said that he doesn't like squash ordinarily but he LOVED it cooked this way. I did not have pepperocini so used about 1/4 tsp of chili flakes and this worked well. I precooked the squash early in the day and while my roast was setting I reheated them as the recipe outlines. I will definitely be making this again.

I wouldn't make it the same way, but I modified it: Crush a garlic clove into some a small amount of olive oil and let sit for a few minutes, then brush the squash lightly with the oil, dust with salt and pepper, and bake. While it's baking make the sauce but use maple syrup not honey, and boil it on the stove top to reduce it to about half to 2/3 the original volume. Strain to remove the pepper and thyme 'bits', and pour over the baked squash just before serving. It's delicious this way!

This is an excellent simple recipe. It is perfect comfort food in the winter with little preparation. The squash will cook if you wait long enough.

I didn't care for the combination of flavors and prefer my standby mixture of cumin, orange and pecan butter.

I liked this squash recipe and enjoyed the bit of heat added from the pepper.

I have made this twice now, and find it quite simple. I had many compliments for Thanksgiving on this dish. I baked early in the morning for 45 minutes and re-heated for 20 minutes. Very tender squash, and awesome flavors.

The squash did not cook as tender as I had anticipated. I personally did not like the combination of the vinegar and squash.

We served this for Thanksgiving to an "audience" that both loves squash and also agrodolce flavors. While the agrodolce flavor of the glaze were good, we found that the squash didn't cook particularly well and we weren's sure that we liked the pepperocini with this as much as some other kind of hot pepper. Mario Batali's recipe for squash agrodolce is far better, in our opinion.

Great dish -- however, I made it with butternut squash and it was great. Tasted alot like sweet potatoes with a great glaze and not as sweet as candied sweet potatoes. Served it with stuffed pork chops and everyone loved it.

I thought this was fabulous. The drippings of the glaze into the pan carmelized the skin of the squash. Very nice bite to the glaze. Really yummy!

I was a little skeptical about this recipe due to the pepperoncini. But the result was really quite nice..a hardy recipe that is sweet from the balsamic vineger and honey, with just the right "bite" coming from the chilis. I did, however cut the squash in sixths. Acorn squash are very filling to begin with and the ones I had bought were huge. The smaller size was just right, and still very satisfying.

i'm rating this a three fork recipe because the marinade is fabulous. i will definitely use this for vegetables i roast in the oven. i had never fixed this kind of squash before -- and probably won't again. it didn't go over great with my family. but the sauce is great.
