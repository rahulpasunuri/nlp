This was decent. Decided to use Portuguese sweet bread and dried peaches instead of what the recipe called for. I agree with the other reviewers in the fact that the fruit ratio wasn't enough, added more for my liking. Would make again, but will experiment a little more

This was OK, but pretty blah. The amount of coconut and fruit in the recipe seemed like too little for the amount of bread, and the custard was only pretty good, not great by any means.

One way to cut the too-sweet problem is to use regular coconut milk (not lite) instead of the pre-sweetened coconut cream the recipe calls for. We probably used more sweetened coconut flakes than the recipe suggests, but we really liked the result. It's 3 not 4 forks because I'm still looking for that drop-dead-good bread pudding recipe, but this was very popular with my family (and makes quite a generous amount of dessert!)

We loved this! I substituted bananas for the dried aprictos and it worked perefectly in terms of both flavor and texture - very moist. Based on previous comments, I ommitted the sugar entirely (wanted a strong coconut flavor so didn't want to cut down on the cream of coconut). It was still quite sweet - but not too sweet.

No rating, because of all the changes, but....... I used my leftover coconut bread (see Epicurious recipe) after having the incredible island tenderloin salad. Topped the cubes of that with well drained crushed pineapple. Used canned coconut milk in place of the cream of coconut, and used 1/2 pineapple juice (saved when draining) and 1/2 1% milk for the custard. Kept the 1/2 cup sugar and 6 eggs, but used 2 T vanilla and 1 T dark rum. It was fantastic!

I used twice as many apricots as called for, sliced very thin, and twice as much coconut. Next time I would use less sugar, but I think I was headed in the right direction. Sprinkle some coconut on top, and it toasts during baking for a very attractive presentation.

Tasty, but not that special. I'm starting to learn that anything made with cream of coconut is automatically too sweet and artificial-tasting. I used only one 15-oz can and made up the difference with milk, and I reduced the sugar to 1/3-cup as suggested, but that still wasn't sufficient. Next time I'd use plain unsweetened coconut milk, and figure out how much sugar to add myself. I doubled the apricots, which worked well, and slightly increased the shredded coconut. I think I'd like to sprinkle some extra on the top to toast it, instead of having the occasional coconut bit embedded in the pudding.

I'm a big bread pudding fan and have numerous bread pudding recipes, but this is definitely one of my favorite. I too used a little less cream of coconut (a little too sweet if you use as much as it calls for)and a little more milk instead. I made up for the diminished sweetness by using dried mango instead of apricots. They added a little more sweetness and intensified the tropical taste of the pudding.

This is always hit and very easy. I use only one can of Coco Lopez, one and a half times the amount of apricots and 1% milk. It is too sweet if you follow the recipe.

this is such an easy dessert to make and it's such a hit! i'm always looking for adventurous recipes, and this one is a fresh take on an old favourite.

My whole family really liked this pudding. The only change I would make would be to use 1/3 cup (instead of 1/2) of sugar and 2 cups of coconut cream instead of 2 1/2. (just adding a bit more milk in its place). I would do this because it was a bit to sweet. Otherwise this is a great ending to the meal!

I had this wonderful bread pudding for the first time at the Rainforest Cafe. When I went searching for bread pudding recipes, I thought I would have to "cut and paste" to get something similiar. I was thrilled to find it. It's easy to make, always a favorite at parties and cookouts, and is just wonderful. Hope the Rainforest did not take it off the menu permanently as was rumored.

I substituted lite coconut milk for the cream of coconut, then increased the sugar to 3/4 cup. I think it must be less sweet this way... and was very delicious...in fact, for a bread pudding lover, this was the best I've had!

Great dessert. Not too sweet, but for coconut lovers only. Consider using less cream of coconut, more shredded coconut in the mid-layer and more apricots.

I love coconut so I was very happy with this dish - even my Father who is not a coconut fan requests this dessert when visiting.

i made this but skipped the shredded coconut; was my first attempt at bread pudding and actually turned out very good -- wasn't at all hard to make

Spectacular dessert, a little too sweet. I am trying it again using only one can of coconut cream and adding a fresh raspberry sauce. Another variation I'm toying with would sub crushed pineapple for the apricots, and use a rum sauce: Pina Colada Bread Pudding!
