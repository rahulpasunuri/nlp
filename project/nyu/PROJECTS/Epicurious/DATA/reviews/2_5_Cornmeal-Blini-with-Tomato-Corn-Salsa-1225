The flavors in this are great. However, I had some problems with the blini mixture -- the batter was so soft that when I tried to flip them, they squished and lost their round shape. I made the blinis a little bigger (one T is very small) and used more oil, which helped a little. Don't make this for company unless you try it out first -- but otherwise, this would make a tasty appetizer.
