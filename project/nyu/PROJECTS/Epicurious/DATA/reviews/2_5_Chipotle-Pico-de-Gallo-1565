This one's a bit heavy on the garlic. I would use 1/4 the amount listed here - especially if it's made a day ahead. Also, check your cilantro before using this much - you might find that it add's a very bitter edge to it using this much. This is supposed to be a fresh, light addition with no overpoweringly strong flavors and I used 2 T cilantro and 1/3 C sweet onion and a teaspoon of minced garlic and 1/2 again more tomato than called for. Use sea salt if you can and add it after the other flavors have married for a couple of hours and right before serving.

Great tasting recipe. I'd add more spice with some added minced jalepeno or other pepper, and 1 or 2 more minced cloves. Also, it's much better the second day.

A nonthreatening recipe. Its not going to scare anyone, but It won't really excite them either.
