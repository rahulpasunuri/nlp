This "cake" came out more like thin pudding, could not unmold it at all - was just a puddle. Is there an ingredient missing or a misprint of the time in oven? Tamarind anglaise, while interesting, was too heavy on the tamarind. Proportions for the caramel also off in my opinion, came out very thin - not enough sugar? VERY disappointing...

Not worth the effort. The cooking times are completely inaccurate.

I'm not rating as I used a different recipe, but have some thoughts to share. After careful review of this recipe and the comments of previous cooks, I'm thinking that the transcription error here is not in the cooking time but in the oven temperature. This is essentially a variant of a molten chocolate cake or lava cake, and other recipes on site have similar cooking times but at MUCH higher oven temperatures - they range from 400 to 450 deg. F. I took one of those recipes and tweaked it by adding the chilies and spices with outstanding results; I would definitely make this again. We make ice creams year round and I have a cherry ice cream already worked out that I used. The orange caramel is more aptly described as burnt orange caramel and is a great counterpoint - not at all too sweet; the caramelization of the sugar alters the perception of sweetness quite a bit. Add a dash of salt to the orange caramel to bring the flavor up. I love the exotic taste of tamarind so I liked the anglaise, although with the cakes, ice cream, and caramel sauce if I had to eliminate something this would be it. Look for tamarind paste in Asian markets and be prepared for large seeds - even in packages that say seedless. Go figure. They're easy enough to get out - heat a little of your cream and stir it into the tamarind paste, then press through a sieve.

After reading this through very thoroughly and reading others' difficulties, I'm thinking that the transcription error is not in the baking time but in the oven temperature. This is very like the Molten Chocolate or Lava Cakes elsewhere on site with similar cooking times - but at 400 to 450 deg. F oven temperatures. I'm not rating, as I've made too many personal tweaks - used a different recipe, in other words, for the cake, by adding the chilies and cinnamon to another molten chocolate cake recipe, with outstanding, phenomenal, swoon-worthy results. The orange caramel is, in my opinion, a keeper - more accurately described as burnt orange caramel. Loved the tamarind anglaise too. Look for tamarind paste in Asian markets and be prepared for seeds - even if it says seedless. They're big seeds and easy enough to remove.

This was a hit, though I did leave out the orange caramel (thought it would be too sweet) and bought cherry ice cream. As for the bake time, I experimented at 20 min. 30 min. and 40 min. - 40 min. seemed to work out the best. I probably could of gone longer. I would eyeball it, when the cake is firm to the touch, it's done.

I agree that the flavors are exceptional, and this is worth the extra effort. I would change a couple of things next time, starting with the "cake" (a previous reviewer is correct to call it pudding cake). I cooked it to 160 degrees -- much longer than the recipe calls for. The 12-14 minute time brought the contents up to 110 - - that's not high enough to kill bacteria. In future, I would rely on a different cake recipe, but add the cinnamon and chile. As for the caramel sauce, I made it as written and didn't have any problems. Also -- This recipe is not up to the standards of the magazine recipes -- it's okay, just not as well-written.

I made the entire recipe and the flavors were great. I did have a few problems though. I agree with the other cooks, it was impossible to get the cakes out of the ramekins. I haven't figured out how I will do it next time, but it is certainly worth the effort of making again. I would reduce the water in the orange caramel sauce next time as well, it took FOREVER to reduce to a sauce consistency but it had great flavor. The only other problem was entirely my own - I didn't expect the custard base of the icecream to come up to temperature so quickly and it curdled a little. Just enough to make the icecream a little grainy. My guests didn't notice but I did. There isn't a store bought icecream that tastes anything like this.

This was a big hit with all my gourmet friends. It was worth the effort, especially if you enjoy tackling a cooking project. I even made the ice cream and it was absolutely delicious - a great dessert all by itself. The next time I make this I will do a couple of the steps a day ahead and the remaining steps the day of the party. There seems to be an error in the recipe for the orange caramel, however. The first time I tried it as the recipe stated and the caramel was very watery (runny). I tried again using a tablespoon of water instead of a cup of water. A cup of water does not allow one to make caramelized sugar, but a tablespoon of water with one half cup of sugar allows the sugar to be caramalized before adding the orange juice. I would also start the 20 minute countdown once the caramel begins to simmer. With those adjustments, it turned out perfectly. I had a tough time finding tamarind paste. I live in a large city and tried several latin markets but ended up finding it at an oriental market. I might also suggest filling the ramekins only half full so that each "cake" (more like pudding) is half the size - it is very rich. The puddings came out of the ramekins quite easily once they had been refrigerated for a while.

A more accurate description of this recipe should be Chocolate mole pudding-cake. (The cake was actually more akin to a pudding in texture.) The cake was nearly impossible to release from the ramekins without butchering it, but the flavor combination of the chiles, cinnamon, & chocolate was heavenly. I loved the tart orange caramel sauce and the (purchased) cherry vanilla ice cream provided a palate cooler between the spices. However, I didn't care for the tamarind anglaise. I liked the initial flavor, but then it left a sharply bitter taste in the back of my throat. I found myself trying to eat around it.

I LOVED this recipe. In place of the "mole" part, I substituted it with this awesome new product called Tono & Beto's granualated moles which have all the ingredients in it all ready. They have a variety of flavored powedered moles that allows you to use as much as you want. I used their Pipian flavored one that has ancho chiles in it. It made this super easy and it was a massive hit!!! Soooooooo gooooood!

The dish went over well with my guests, however; I do not feel it was worth the time and trouble - and I even bought the ice cream. The cooking time is not correct, and I even went up to 20 minutes and it still needed to be microwaved before serving. The orange caramel took an extremely long time to thicken (not indicated on recipe).

I haven't tried this yet, but it comes the closest to an ancho chile chocolate torte I got at a bake sale that was absolutely to die for. The bite of the chiles came through at the end of the mouthful and the pepper taste really complimented the complex chocolate taste. I would love any recipes that might be out there. My torte was simplerthan this recipe, which sounds great, with a dusting of powdered sugar on top.

This was lovely and different. I thought the tamarind anglaise was especially delicious. Did not make the ice cream. I used an 8" cake pan rather than individual ramekins and baked it in a water bath at 325 degrees for 40 minutes.

Okay, chiles in chocolate cake? You bet! I've been wanting to try this recipe for a long time, and finally get the time to do (most of) it. The flavors are sublime. The chiles just enhance, and the whole thing is memorable. I do believe, however, the cooking time is way off. I did the water bath for 14 minutes, and after an hour in the fridge, it was liquid. Instead of panicking, I put the ramekins in the microwave for a minute, and although I'm sure it would have been even better in the oven, it was super tasty. Ran out of time for the home made ice cream and bought Hagen-Daaz cherry vanilla instead. The cherry goes great with the warm cake. Orange caramel was nice touch. Didn't make the anglaise. Someone needs to figure out what the correct cooking time should be, without hesitation, try it!
