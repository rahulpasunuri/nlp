I added coffee grinds to the rub and used it on a pork roast. (I brushed the grinds off before I grilled the meat.) It made a great rub. I served the meat with the Coffee Bourbon Barbecue Sauce I found on Epicurious. Amazing.

I have tried doing these ribs twice using the 400 degrees for 1.5 - 2 hrs. The meat isn't as tender as when I slow cook at 275 for 2.5 hrs. Wondering if others feel the same.

Awesome - have made theses several times and are always a hit for flavorful, fall-off-the bone ribs. I usually add cinnamon to the rub but otherwise make as is.

Ridiculously delicious ribs. So incredibly tender they fall off the bone, and the bbq sauce is scrumptious. This recipe is spicy and the beer really flavors the meat well. I've made it twice already and everyone who tried it absolutely loved it. I cant wait to make it again!

In response to using St. Louis Ribs. I actually slow cook them in the oven at 250 for about 3 hours and sometimes put them in the fridge for another day. Then they just need to be put on a grill to heat up and cook with the BBQ sauce.

Rating: 4
These are the very best. I have done them many times with Baby Backs, which are tender. However, I want to try them with St. Louis ribs which I find meatier and have the most flavor. My question is I know St. Louis Ribs cook longer than Baby Backs, does anyone know how long I should cook St. Louis ribs?

My third time making these. One guest liked them so much she not only take the recipe but planned a back yard party around them! I didn't boil the beer; after 1.5 hours, the beer at the bottom of the pan was almost gone. Also, last night's batch could have been a little hotter (temperature hot, not spicy hot). Even with ribs at room temperature (I had baked them the night before), they should have stayed on the grill a bit longer.

Really simple and easy. Lots of possibility to play around with the base ingredients. Try it with a good chili powder to tone down the heat for those with more "tender" taste buds.

This is our go-to recipe any time we make ribs. It always gets raves, and it's so simple. I substitute chili powder for the hot Mexican powder called for since none us like it super spicy. Excellent ribs!

for those who do not want the extra kick of spicy, i have used a good quality chili powder in lieu of the hot mexican powder. just the perfect amount of spice without putting anyone off.

Rating: 4
Super easy super delicious. I've made these twice now to rave reviews ("restaurant quality"), the key to having them spicy or not - some have stated they are too spicy for them - is how long you let the ribs sit with the rub on them before cooking. If you let the ribs sit overnight in the rub it penetrates more for a spicier rib. If you just let them sit room temp for an hour you will just have a hint of the flavors. Both ways yummy so really just about preference. I use Brooklyn lager for the beer and also use rum as a sub for the some of the water in the sauce with excellent results.

Rating: 4
This is truly the easiest and best way to do indoor/outdoor ribs. With the rub alone they are four fork worthy. The sauce puts them over the top. Have stuck with this recipe since publication.

Excellent and easy. Tried slow cooking at 265 for 2.5 hours with saran wrap to seal in beer as suggested by other review... was excellent. But do not use saran wrap when cooking for 1.5 hrs at 400!! It melts... Curious to hear if others have tried the recipe as is vs. slow cooking and which they prefer...

So easy. I made these for a large group watching the hockey play-offs and everyone loved them. I didn't reduce the beer and the meat fell off the bone.

I'm looking forward to trying this just for a different flavour. But if you want meltingly tender ribs it's simple. I sprinkle mine with a little salt and garlic powder, squeeze some fresh orange juice over, put a few thin slices of orange on, wrap tightly in foil, put in a roasting pan with a lid and slow cook at 250 to 300 for about 3 hours. They absolutely fall apart and are ready for your sauce to cook on in a 400 degree oven. Easy....

This was FANTASTIC. Probably the best rib recipe I've ever made. The ribs out of the oven were so moist, tender and falling off the bone. The BBQ sauce is good and necessary but that is not the rave. I used rich dark instant coffee but the espresso might add more depth.

Rating: 3
I thought this was really quite good. I would suggest making sure the rub isnt too spicy, because it definitely had a kick. I used dinosaur barbeque sauce and added an extra tsp of espresso powder. People generally loved them, but for those that didnt, it was because it was too spicy. I will make this again, but tone down the rub. Make sure you cook the ribs long enough, for me, to get the "meat falling off the bone" kind of ribs, "fork tender" means it should go through the meat with hardly ANY pressure.

Rating: 0
Recipe is great but I think the rub is a bit overwhelming. I would use half the rub at the most. I also find that adding crushed garlic to the sauce gives it a nice kick.

I made this for July 4th and it was a huge hit. I used chipotle chile pepper seasoning in the rub. I cut it in half and it was hot enough for us. I did not follow the changes to the barbecue sauce but instead combined store bought vinegar and tomatoe based sauces. The ribs were very tender and as my guests raved, I said you're too kind but yes they are perfect.

I agree this is a tremendous way to fix ribs, possibly the best ever. Had to make our own bbq sauce due to the fact that processed sauces have way too much corn syrup but other than that we stayed right on tract. Can't wait to impress some more people.

Fabulous! When serving ribs to friends in Texas the bar is set vey high - and this recipe delivers! Easy, tasty and absolutely now a "go to" recipe for our family. Only change I made was to replace the water with bourbon in the BBQ sauce. No idea why some reviewers complained of grittiness as we experienced none of this. Used Shiner Black Lager beer and Central Market BBQ sauce. Looking forward to making again - soon!

I have to agree with others that this was by far the best rib recipe I've ever made and quite possibly the best ribs I've had anywhere ever. I had a friend with me who doesn't like eating ribs (he's bone-phobic) and once he took one bite he lost all the phobia and pigged out on an entire slab. Can't say enough about how good these are.

Since I didn't make the sauce, I won't comment. The ribs themselves were pretty good, but the rub was terrible - very one- dimensional and gritty. I also didn't see the point of reducing the beer before cooking, but did it anyway. I wish I hadn't. There wasn't enough liquid to keep my roasting pan from getting carbonized, and the ribs weren't quite as tender as others have said. The only reason I even gave this a 2 was because it gave me a new way to do baby backs that keeps them fairly moist.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! Instead of espresso powder, I used ground up coffee beans, and had to leave out the paprika, cumin, and salt. For religious reasons, I don't keep beer around the house, so I used grapefruit juice instead. And since ribs are expensive, I replaced them with some chicken breasts. Best chicken ribs I've ever had!

Rating: 4
Absolutely Amazing!!! And a Snap to Make!!! I usually make BBQ sauce, but using Expresso Powder kicks-up the flavor of any good store bought brand quite a few notches!!! The baby backs were difficult to pick- up at times, because the meat was soooooo tender!!!

It is one of my families favorites! I use about half the amount of cumin though since I'm not a big fan of that spice.

Don't slow roast. I've tried both methods, and the 1.5hr high temp yields the better meat texture. The flavor, on the other hand, is just o.k. I keep experimenting w/ different rubs and I found that you can obtain the same texture by just covering the ribs w/ foil and omitting the beer. Finished on the grill w/ some good sauce and flavor was perfect w/o the beer.

I could not find espresso powder and substituted triple strong coffee in its place. I think I will try apple juice instead of the beer next time as well but overall the ribs were the best I have ever made! I can't wait to make a double batch and serve them at the next get together.

I've been making these ribs since 2003 and they are, without a doubt, the BEST rib recipe! Although I try to make a variety of dishes for my annual new year's eve party, this rib recipe is a staple (because everyone requests it!). Because we like our ribs a bit hotter, I've experimented a bit and I now add to the rub 1 Tbsp of any (or all) of the hotter spices I have on hand (cayenne, chipotle, habenero and ancho powder). Like some others who make these ribs, I also use 2 bottles of beer. This is a "don't miss" recipe for sure!!!

Will definitely make again.

These are the best ribs I have ever made. I have made them several times, with different brands of BBQ sauce, but the Sweet Baby Rays is especially good. I omit the brown sugar, and use instant coffee rather than espresso, and it adds a nice subtle flavor to the sauce. I bake the ribs at 275 for 2 hours, using just plain light beer (I find they are just as good with a cheap beer as they are with a dark import), and they are always falling off the bone tender. These are so good, I almost don't want to share the recipe with anyone! But, I do.

Rating: 3
The sauce is amazingly good. I used the new Budweiser bbq sauce and made exactly as the recipe is written. I would make the ribs again, but definitely not the greatest thing ever. I think some people are overrating the way the meat itself comes out. I slow roasted according to one reviewer, but I think I just prefer smoked. These can't touch the Southern style ribs I've tasted since moving to MS. Sonny's in Jackson or Corky's out of Memphis are the best dang ribs on the planet.

I read all of the reviews with great anticipation. These ribs were marginal, at best. I have a recipe I've made for years that's much easier and way better. Just put the slabs in a roasting pan, arranged so they're not stacked on top of one another, but they will overlap. Cover them tightly with foil and bake at 300 degrees for two hours. For the sauce, dice one medium onion and mince 2 or 3 garlic cloves. Saute them in a deep pot with 2 Tbsp butter until clear. Stir in 1 cup of ketchup, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 heaping Tbsp chili powder, 1 teaspoon dried basil, and 1 Tbsp lemon juice. Heat thoroughly, about 10 minutes. Put the ribs on a BBQ grill to finish them, basting with the sauce. The time depends upon the heat of the grill, they will be very tender so they may not need to cook for long. Serve the ribs, passing more of the sauce. This will get RAVE reviews and has much greater flavor and is much less trouble than this recipe. Have fun!

Absolutely fabulous! I wanted to try the slow cook method recommended by previous reviewers, but didn't have extra time, so I cooked as directed and they were fall-off-the-bone tender. I used Bass Ale with Sweet Baby Rays Hickory Brown Sugar sauce (omitted the additional brown sugar), regular chili powder with 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.I also used regular instant coffee and it tasted great. I have tried multiple cooking techniques (pre-boiling, slow-grilling)to create tender ribs and this, by far, was the BEST!

This was absolutely wonderful! We didn't even make the sauce - just warmed up some Sweet Baby Ray's and sat it on the table - but the rub was so good my husband didn't even WANT sauce! And this is a man who puts sauces on EVERYTHING! I can't wait to have company - this is going to be my new favorite rib recipe for a long time.

This was VERY easy and VERY good. I have always feared that ribs would be tough unless you knew what you were doing so I had never made ribs before. but this process takes the mystery out of tender ribs. I used the slow cook as other mentioned - 2.5 hours at 265 they turned out perfectly tender - the rub made them extra delicious! If you need a ribs recipe look no further!

These are sensational! The best ribs I have ever had, homemade or restaurant. I served them with garlic mashed potates (also from this site) and sauteed carrots. I used the jus from the ribs for gravy, (reserved some water from the garlic mashed, mixed with some flour - out of this world, deeply flavorful gravy). I can't wait to make this again for another group of friends.

My first attempt at ribs, and a raging success. Very tender. I used spare ribs and the excess fat "melted" right off in the braising process which was great. The coffee-spiked BBQ sauce didn't appeal to all my guests, so I may leave it out or use less next time if I have non-coffee people or finiky eaters. Overall, great!

These were the best ribs I have ever had. I used apple juice instead of beer and it worked just fine. I finely diced a sweet onion and cooked until clear in a little olive oil, then followed the advice of another cook and used Kahulua because I didn't have espresso powder. Added the bbq sauce (used Emeril's spicy) the brown sugar and a little more apple juice. Simmered the sauce about and hour. YUMMMY!

Without question these were some of the best ribs I've ever had anywhere. Simplest recipe I can imagine and utterly perfect, tender and delicious results.

Wonderful.

Unbelievably good for a summer BBQ. I reduced the amount of black pepper, figuring that two tablespoons of cayenne would more than suffice for spice, and used Guinness as my dark beer. Phenomenal. I've never seen ribs disappear so fast.

I've made this recipe many times and it's always been a major hit. You can tone down the heat by using regular Chili Powder instead of the Hot Mexican style, adding between 1/8 & 1/2 tsp of Cayenne Pepper to taste, and picking a mild BBQ sauce (I find Stubb's mild works great). I also use Bass Ale for the braising, mostly because it also goes great with the ribs while devouring them. Mmmm...a cooler full of cold beer & a few racks of juicy, flavorful ribs...I'm getting hungry already!

I have made these ribs probably a dozen times since I discovered the recipe a few months ago. It's one of the few on this site I would give more forks if I could. The first time I made them I followed the recipe to a "t". Ribs are outstanding! I make these using the same cooking method now, but use my favorite rub (Cajun Foreplay from Dinosaur BBQ)and my favorite bottled sauce. I have never had problems with liquid evaporating - I just invert ribs on heavy duty foil, make a pocket that is well sealed, pour in liquid, seal the reamining end and pop it on a cookie sheet. Works like a charm and no clean-up either. Awesome recipe.

I've made this receipe twice now, and it came out great both times. Generally I steam ribs gently in a pot on the stive and then grill them on a Weber gas grill. But I'm starting to become a fan of the beer-steaming-in-the-oven procedure used in this recipe. The ribs come out wonderfully moist and literally fall off the bone. The expresso BBQ sauce is a nice change-of-pace, too. I'd give this receipe 3.5 forks.

I've made these four times in the past two months. Everyone loves them. I use a large can of Guiness and close the foil seal tight. I've never had issues with evaporation. Once I left them in the oven too long and they got so tender they fell off the bone and I couldn't put them on the BBQ, but it didn't really matter. Everyone still loved them! I use less cummin and less chili powder and took the advice of combining the Bull's Eye Hickory flavored BBQ sauce with a third of a bottle of a sweeter sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's original sauce). So good!

This is my standby recipe for ribs -- I think I've probably made it at least a dozen times since it was published!! It's excellent! But, since I joined WeightWatchers recently (because I've eaten too many of these damned ribs!!), I am looking for leaner versions of my old favorites. Tonight I used this same dry rub for pork tenderloin; I put it on the pork at about 9:00 this morning. Then I roasted the pork at 425 for 30 minutes, and I used KC Masterpiece sauce because I ran out of time. Didn't use the beer step either. Anyway, it was GREAT. My son said, "mom, this tastes just like ribs!!" Don't get me wrong, I will definitely make the ribs again, but if you want a good variation, you can use pork tenderloin and save huge calories.

I've made them twice now and both times everyone loved them. I've doubled the recipe both times and was still easy. They are fall-off-the-bone-good!

WOW...these were so yummy. Made them last night and they were so tender, probably the best ribs I've ever had.

Also, had several boneless, skinless chicken thighs which I did on the grill with the rub and the sauce...equally as good.

Similar experience to everyone else - great recipe, compliments all around, easy to do the day before and then just heat up either on the grill or, if you don't have one, broil or use a stove-top grill pan.

After reading all the great reviews of this recipe I just had to try it. Like many others, I have had little luck with slow-cooking or pre-boiling ribs. I've never managed to get the fall-off-the-bone tenderness. With this recipe, I've finally made it. These were SO GOOD that my husband and I devoured two enormous racks of back ribs, and wished we had more the following night. Best ribs I've ever tasted, and I looooooove ribs! I used two cans of beer, and mixed some sweeter BBQ sauces in with a smoky one since I don't use brown sugar. Used regular finely ground coffee and cooked the sauce well to blend the flavors. Next time I will use instant, the ground was a bit strong, though it didn't ruin the ribs at all. Try this one, folks, it's a winner!

I halved the recipe, but used the amount of beer called for in the full recipe. Used a shallow wok-like skillet with a well-fitted lid, and had no burning problems. The beer was fully absorbed in 1.5 hours, though. Rather than grilling, I just did the last step in the same skillet on the stove. Overall, very, very good.

Outstanding ribs! However, perhaps other cooks could help me with a problem. All of the liquid (beer) evaporated and the ribs began to burn with 20 minutes left in cooking time. I even started with 2 bottles of Guiness instead of 1 based on other reviews. My pan was covered tightly with foil. Any ideas? Would it work to cook the ribs on a rack just above the beer, or do they need to be IN the liquid. Help please?????

The espresso definitely added a unique and tasty layer of flavor to the ribs. Can't wait to have more company to make these "fall off the bone" treats.

I always like a rib rub then sauce. Although I didn't follow it exactly, the results were fabulous. My rub was spicier, and my sauce was sans espresso, nevertheless, yum.

This is the best rib recipe I have ever tasted. Everyone who eats the ribs wants the recipe. I even take it with me when we travel to Hawaii so we can enjoy it on the BBQ there.

I've made these several times, always to rave reviews. Despite the praise, I've always felt they lacked a little zip. To remedy I started adding about 1/4 cup red wine vinegar to the dry spice rub so that it becomes a thick paste. IMHO it really improves the flavor. Also, when I have the time, I finish the ribs in a smoker with indirect heat using hickory chips- just another layer of flavor

Fabulous and easy! One of the better rib rubs and sauces I've tried. Can't wait to make these for company.

Once again, this one was a showstopper at my bbq...people were lining up at the grill for more. I lightened up on the amount of rub this year though - instead of coating as much as would stick, I put just enough to season all surfaces, and I found it to be better, not quite so overpowering. Enjoy!

Tried this for the first time this week and the ribs came out great (yeah, it's cheatin' ribs, but it's a darn good recipe with tender moist ribs :-) I had no problems w/ the beer evaporating; the foil is supposed to cover the roasting pan *tightly* to prevent this and it does. Only problem I had was that I had to stack the ribs on top of each other. The ribs that were in the beer were more moist and tender than the ones stacked on top which weren't on the beer. No need to use baby back ribs either. I used regular pork ribs and they came out great. The sauce also has a slightly bitter aftertaste, but it's a very full bodied taste. I think it's from the expresso, so I might cut it back next time or add more sugar. I did replace half the water in the sauce recipe w/ bourbon to add more flavor to it. I used the Bulleye Hickory sauce as the base since America's Test Kitchen said it was the best sauce. I also used Guiness Extra Stout for the beer since that's less bitter than most dark beers.

Terrific way to make ribs. Cooked 25 lbs of ribs for a party and by baking them in batches the day before it was very manageable. They were tender and tasty. Only change I made was to sub boubon for 1/2 the water in the sauce. Next time will try baking them in bourbon instead of beer and also will cut back some on the cumin.

Delicious!!! Made this dish for the 1st time for 6 of my friends. They loved every rib! My husband keeps asking me to make it again soon. I did add one extra bottle of beer as many people suggested.I also added a little more expresso coffee and replaced the 1/2 cup water with beer for the sauce.The sauce is most wonderful. I made the ribs & sauce the day before so I could enjoy the dinner party. This is such an easy recipe,but your friends & family will think you must have been in the kitchen for days.

Definitely a keeper. The preparation in combination with the rub sets these ribs apart from other recipies. The expresso addition to bottled sauce steps up the flavor component.

Rating: 3
This method of making ribs is just fantastic. I made the recipe as is with a few extra spices. I also used instant coffee instead of the expresso. It did add a nice depth of flavour to my normal sauce. However, I was wondering if you could use something besides beer for the braising. I don't particularily like beer and was looking for a subsitution if anyone can recommend one. Would stock work?

I made this with the SPICY CHUTNEY BARBECUE SAUCE also on this site.

Absolutley fantastic. One of these days I'll get around to trying the espresso BBQ sauce. This method for precooking the ribs is the best I've ever tried.

Myself and my husband plus company thought this an outstanding recipe. I have it in the oven right now! I left Espresso powder out because I couldn't find any....was great anyhow! I used Bull's Eye Barbecue Sauce, rated the #1 sauce by Cook's Magazine, who test everything in the way of food! It is hot, but a hot that doesn't cover up the taste. Not hard to make either!

I've been making this recipe since I saw it in the June issue. Everytime I serve it for guests, they have asked me for a copy of the recipe. The only change I made is to wrap the ribs in foil & chill before putting on the barbeque & I reheated on the grill first then added the sauce in the last 10 min (5 mins a side).

This was a HUGE hit. I thought it was little too spicy, but everyone thought I was crazy. They ate it up! They even thought it was better than Lucille's BBQ Restaurant. 1. I used Folgers instant coffee crystals, and it was fine. 2. I thought it was a little heavy on the Paprika. I don't like to bite into a paprika taste. I think it should be subtle. I'll cut back a little next time.

REALLY wonderful! I also smoked the ribs on my smoker for about an hour and then followed the recipe exactly. My husband said, "Stop trying other rib recipes. This is the one!" I have just gotten back from Dallas and bought some Qsauce from Sonny Bryan's, so used that. Absolutely fabulous! The coffee adds a depth and richness to the sauce.

This is a FABULOUS rib recipe!! I have made twice now with raves from guests. I had boiled my ribs in the past before I tried this method and cannot believe the difference! Juicy, tender and fall off the bone! Never boil again. I cannot find espresso powder anywhere so I used 2 tsp instant coffee. Must try!

For those of us who don't have easy access to baby back ribs I made the following changes to the recipe. I substituted about 3 pounds, or two large, pork tenderloins for the ribs. I rubbed them with the spice mixture, marinating overnight in the fridge. I made the barbecue sauce (with the Stubbs brand) using the dark beer instead of the water. I then added a little ketchup to soften the flavor. I cooked the pork on the barbecue for about 30 minutes, basting with the sauce, and it was a huge hit.

I generally do my ribs in the smoker at 200-225 with dry rub and a mop but I made this recipe over the weekend for a party and they were devoured in minutes. The meat absolutely falls off the bone and the sauce is great. Followed the advice from the cook from Pensacola and did a brief smoking first. Phenomenal!!

Rating: 3
My husband has always been the grill master and he does a several hour smoke over wood & coals for his ribs. They are extremely tasty but a bit chewy. I was looking for a more "fall off of the bone" recipe and this one is certainly that! I bought a full rack of baby-back ribs and split them in two. For the first attempt, I followed this recipe exactly. And they were very tender but a bit greasy. The major taste missing to us though was the smoke. For the second try (in the same week!), I let my hubby smoke them for about half an hour first, then followed this recipe again for the baking & quick grilling. That was the perfect combo! The ribs had that wonderful smoke flavor, were much less greasy & still fell from the bone. This will be our standard from now on! Much to our 4-year-olds delight who ate more ribs than I did!!

I have to say - I thought my ribs with a hoisin sauce were the best until I tried these - some of the most flavorful and tender I've ever had. Used Best's West BBQ sauce, brushed it on the ribs when they came out of the oven, then let them sit for a bit while I got everything else ready. Brushed them again, on to the grill, and proceeded into a rib feeding frenzy. Yummy!

I always thought ribs were too involved to make often but after trying this recipe twice in one week I've been convinced otherwise. These ribs are simply fantastic. The sauce is outstanding made with KC Masterpiece hickory style. This has been the best thing I've eaten so far this summer. Give them a try!!!

Rating: 4
To the cook from Vernon, CT., I quadrupled the recipe and had to double up on the amount of ribs per roaster and it still came out perfect. Next time I make it however, I will decrease the sauce by half. I made this for an informal, outdoor wedding reception and was able to do all the prep work ahead of time. They needed very little time on the grill before serving.

Rating: 4
When it comes to ribs, I'm usually a traditionalist, either slow cooking in the oven for 4 hours at very low temp or slow smoking indirect on the BBQ. I tried this recipe and my family and I loved it. The meat was tender, falling off the bones, but still firm and chewy. I uses a New Mexico chili powder in the rub and I reduced the BBQ sauce by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 "Hot" BBQ sauce for a litte more fire. I've made them twice and will make them again.

I was very worried about this recipe as it baked - S.O complained that it smelled like the carpet at a frat house (stale beer and smelly feet (cumin)) - But the end result was excellent, even he agreed. I would use a sweeter, sunnier BBQ base next time, I used something pretty dark and Texan - it was good, but I think a bit higher fruity/acid notes would be even better.

This is a very good base recipe-- that becomes great if you use a great bbq sauce. I've made it twice-- once with a friend who insisted on using a supermarket brand (I think it was Bullseye) and it was...okay. Sweet. Then I made it again using half Rudy's Sause (a TX/NM local-- yes, that's how it's spelled) and 1/2 Dinosaur Wango Tango, and it was AWESOME! I also used NM chile in the rub, which I think makes a big difference.

I give this recipe 4 forks for its simplicity, as well as its flavor. Made these for guests throwing in extra, expecting leftovers - no such luck! Prepared the ribs and sauce the previous evening, just grilled them for a few minutes the following night with heated sauce. Yum! I used country style ribs rahter than the baby back (less expensive and more tasty in my opinion), and baked them in pale ale rather than dark beer (all we had in the house). For the sauce, I started with a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's honey barbecue sauce and added instant coffee as instant expresso seems to be non-existent in the stors I have searched. Will definitely make again soon!

I've never made ribs before. Found this recipe and thought I would try it out for a friend's potluck birthday party. That's tomorrow. My husband and I have eaten half a rack. Looks like I'm taking less to the party than I thought. Used my oval roasting pan with cover - worked great. Thought I may have ruined them by not using foil as instructed. Slurp...Slurp...definitely not ruined. To the one fork cook from New York below...interesting review. You should have stuck to the recipe!

Very tasty, especially given how easy it is! My husband loved it, and said it was better than our favorite rib joint's ribs: more tender.To me, it was the rub/sauce taste and the "look" that made it. Just for "grins", I made 2 versions of sauce: 1 sweet (Gates Sweet and Mild) and the other spicy(Stubbs). Both were terrific, and tasted quite different.So easy to do, and recommend it if you're cooking for people with different tastes. Actually made this for a 4th of July lunch and went to visit friends for 4th of July dinner. She also served ribs (different recipe, but involved baking and a last minute grill). There was no comparison: this was much, much better.

Dee-li-cious! I left the rub on for 24hrs, halved the BBQ sauce because I only had 2 1/2lbs. of side ribs. I think it was even better the next night when we reheated the ribs wrapped in foil on the BBQ for 5 min, the finished off with the sauce for a few minutes. Definitely a keeper.

These were really good. I made these at my boyfriend's apt and therefore had only one small roasting pan (typical bachelor :), so had to cook in two batches. They were very good, very tender, and very tasty. I used hungarian hot paprika, and the spice mixture was incredibly good. Did not have espresso powder and used instant coffee instead, courtesy of the bachelor pad, and feel therefore that I may have missed out on even more deliciousness, but they were def quite good :)

Hmmmm... What can I say about this recipe that EVERYONE ELSE hasn't already said?? It's magnificent!! I used Stubb's BBQ Sauce for the "high quality BBQ sauce" suggested in the recipe, and it was so good dressed up with espresso and brown sugar.These ribs fell off the bone and were so delicious that my husband and I couldn't even stop to comment on them until we had both eaten several. I highly recommend this. Plus, it's relatively quick and super-easy! I e-mailed the recipe to my mother, and she made them-- she agrees that they're the best!One other thing-- for those people who choose to write "non-review" comments, please realize that if you don't give the recipe any forks and if you don't specify whether you'd make it again or not, it skews the recipe's ratings. I think that of the actual reviews listed here, 100% of the reviewers would make this again, but the ratings state that 89% would. I have seen this happen with too many good recipes. Maybe epicurious.com should give "reviewers" the option to write comments without contributing to the overall ratings of the recipes. Just wanted to put in my two cents!

FABULOUS RECIPE! I served these with the Mashed Potatoes with Cheddar Cheese and Poblano Chilies on this website, and grilled corn on the cob. For someone who wants delicious, quality ribs in a short time, look no further. It was great to throw them in the oven and forget them. I used Annie's BBQ sauce (original recipe) and loved the addition of the espresso powder and brown sugar. Your guests will rave!!!

Hard to believe these are as good as the reviews indicate...they are. Best ribs I have ever made. Almost didn't do the baking at 400 degrees because it is contrary to everything I have read before.

Served these with Deborah Roberts Perry, GA Potato Salad and Barefoot Contessa Fresh Corn Salad, both recipes on TV Food Network.

Boy, that's tough, Franklin TN. Coming from a family that respects individual food preferences, my inclination would still be to grill some chicken or flip an omelet for the one who doesn't eat pork and go for the good ribs for everyone else. Beef ribs are just not the same and have to be cooked differently. (IMHO)

Okay, I'd really love to try these ribs. The problem? Someone in my family doesn't eat pork. So, if I use beef ribs, does anyone know how the cooking times might change, or what I should be aware of? I've never actually cooked ribs before, but this technique seems perfect for those of us who don't have hours to stand over a grill. Thanks in advance!

Since my oven does not get as hot as it's supposed to I left them in for 2 hours instead of 1 1/2. They were so tender we almost didn't get them off the grill with the bone still in so maybe two hours is too long. They were so good I am making them for a crowd on the 4th of July and making copies of the recipe for the guests. They are fantastic and I'm from Texas (which is full of barbecue snobs among other things).

Having read the great reviews, I made this recipe and found that the ribs did not fall off the bone, as many reviewers said. The ribs were tasty but not amazing. Being an Epicurious fan and having made many other recipes successfully, I tried it again, even doubling the beer during the baking. Again, the ribs were not "fall off the bone" tender. What am I doing wrong? With the second batch, I figured I had nothing to lose after the disappointing results so I boiled the already-cooked ribs in a reduced beer/marinade mix, and that made them much more tender.

OH MY GOSH! They wouldn't shut up about how good the ribs were. Even my picky mother-in-law did not have a comment on how to make them better.

This recipe prompted me write my first review. In a word, EXCELLENT! I will be bringing these ribs to the family 4th of July picnic and I'm sure they'll get raves. I used Kraft Brown Sugar BBQ sauce and even with the additional 2 Tabs. of brown sugar the recipe calls for, the instant coffee powder (I didn't have espresso powder) mellowed out the sweetness and added a richness to the flavor that is wonderful.

As other reviewers have noted, it's great that you can make this ahead. I loved the flavor and the tenderness, and appreciated the fact that it happened in the oven, in an hour and a half, without my having to think about it. Good hack to make store-bought BBQ sauce taste better, too.

I STAND CORRECTED AND I'M BACK TO FIX MY RATING. My previous review started "Illinois is right on the money..." and I proceded to bash this recipe for not being authentic BBQ; a reaction to a previous reviewers similar sentiment. Upon reading subsequent reviews I learned this is not even presented as BBQ, authentic or 'cheatin' style. So, I'm back with four forks and a "yes" with a couple of tweaks: 1. ADD FIRE! Slap on some surgical gloves and add some julienne habanero to the pan before baking. Habanero...if you like heat, perhaps the finest vegetable ever grown. 2. Forget the baby back ribs...get the full size rack; more meat (and sublime pork fat) for your buck. Oink.

Rating: 4
Truly AWESOME, fall-off-the-bone, melt-in-your-mouth ribs!! (And we've done more than our fair share of rib-recipe experimentation). Definitely use more beer, as 1 cup reduced evaporated quickly. For the BBQ sauce, we used a combination of Sweet Baby Ray's Hot, and Honey BBQ. We'll definitely be making this one again...and again....and again..!

Rating: 3
What I loved about this recipe was it's make-ahead-ability (yes, pre-baking was a definite plus)! Only, I misread the instructions and instead of adding the dark beer to the ribs, it got added to the sauce (which wrecked it), so I added regular Molson's instead and used my own sauce for the basting. The results were very yummy and my guests were thrilled. I can't wait to try it again with the dark beer.

Rating: 4
We made these for company a couple of weeks back. I love the baking step because it made for super tender ribs, as well as allowed me extra time to do the salad, potatoes, etc. The rub is awesome. I didn't bother with the espresso sauce at the end (just used regular purchased sauce -- now I can picture some of you foodies rolling your eyes at me) mainly because we had all had several margaritas at that point and didn't feel the need to do extra futzing in the kitchen. Anyway, these are awesome and I will absolutely make them again!

I haven't tried this recipe but wanted to help the fellow from England prepare his rib rub. The best rubs as far as I'm concerned contain Paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, brown sugar, black pepper and salt. Cumin can be added if you like the flavor. I'd start with 2X paprika versus the other ingredients and salt and pepper to taste.

The sauce was interesting. But I have a favorite I will stick to. I did not dislike it, just have a better. To add my 2 cents, I boil ribs first in dark beer, molasses and spices for about an hour. Reduce liquid which becomes base for the sauce. Then grill with apple chips, basting with beer and molasses based sauce (with other ingredients added).

Actually, the previous reviewer is totally WRONG! Barbecue refers to hot smoking of meat at low temperatures with various rubs, marinades and sauces. Grilling refers to cooking or finishing meats and/or vegetables at higher temperature. This obviously a baked dish finished on the grill. So who cares? I am truly confused about the fuss, as the recipe does not even claim to be barbecue, it is merely finished with barbecue sauce. Bid deal. It looks good to me!

HELLO?!?!? BBQ is a term used both as the sauce going on the meat, and a method (i.e. on the grill). In this case, BBQ means the sauce. And by the way, baking ribs, in my opinion, makes the most succulent ribs in the world.

I made these using instant coffee because I didn't have any other kind of coffee at hand and the ribs still turned out wonderful.

These are cheatin' ribs. A proper rib is done on a 200-250 degree grill for 3 hours or more wearing nothing but a dry rub. Purists use a kettle, but my wife gets it "dropping off the bone" on a 3 burner Weber gas grill. Nobody eats ribs with a fork, so fork tender is beside the point. A little sauce thinned with vinegar and brushed on near the end is optional. If I got this in a restaurant and it claimed to be real barbeque, I would send it back.

The method perscribed here makes for succulent, fall off the bone ribs. I've tried boiling them and other methods, this beats them all. The sauce was great, although you could use any favorite that you may have with the rub. The second time I made these, I added some cayenne and granulated garlic to the rub. VERY GOOD!

I've made these ribs twice in the last month and they are excellent! The meat is very tender & falls right off of the bone. If you are going to make the espresso bbq sauce, I would recommend using a sweeter sauce as the base. I tried the espresso with a spicier & sweeter sauce and it was much more flavorful with a sweeter bbq sauce. Also I used 2 bottles of Shiner Bock beer (reduced) instead of one. One cup of reduced beer is not enough.

I decided to make my own BBQ sauce and then just add instant coffee and some extra sugar. I couldn't find instant espresso so I just used any dark roast coffee I could find. It tasted so-so but once I put it over the pork - mixed with the cumin rub - it tasted great. I will definately make this again.
