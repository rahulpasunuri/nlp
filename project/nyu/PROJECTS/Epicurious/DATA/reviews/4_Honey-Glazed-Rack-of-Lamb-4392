Delicious! I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day. It was part of the "Dinner for Couples" menu and I couldn't be happier that I chose this menu. I made extra sauce because there never seems to be enough. Much to my amazement, there was a TON of extra left at the end so there was no need to make extra. The sauce went PERFECTLY with the lamb. My husband, who prefers trying new things rather than repeating recipes, is looking forward to when I make this again!

I made this for dinner a few weeks ago, and hubby made it for my birthday dinner. Truly a fantastic recipe. The honey, soy sauce, and dijon mustard make for a beautiful coating.

Been making this dish since the recipe came out (back when I still actually subscribed to Bon Appetit in magazine form!) - one of the two best lamb recipes I've used in the last decade! My small suggestion for improvement is: the sauce isn't really that necessary, and it's way too much sauce if you cook according to recipe. I glaze the lamb more often than is called for in the recipe, and it keeps the lamb tender & juicy. Take the drip from the glaze after the lamb is done, dilute a tiny bit with broth, whisk together & pour the already-thickened sauce back on the rack of lamb (after you cut & lay them out for serving) and no one even pours on extra sauce. The taste is more elegant & there's no "external" sauce to distract from the depth of the glaze. (You can also control the sweetness & the thickness of the glaze on the lamb that way.) A much-loved and frequently requested dish!!

Great recipe. Contrary to many of the reviews I found that the glaze didn't come through as much as I expected and the sauce was fantastic. I pureed half the sauce with the veggies and added it to the strained sauce. it was good that way but I think it weakened the flavor a little. I made the menu noted (Dinner for Couples) and it was way too much food.

made this for easter using a leg of lamb instead of a rack....scored the fat and rubbed the glaze all over a couple hours prior, then roasted in rack for 30min @ 450 and 1hr @ 350, with scattered potatoes, carrots, brussels sprouts and shallots all in the bottom. drizzled leftover glaze on veggies and served with sauce. PERFECT.

This was delicious!! A nice change for rack of lamb- odd combo of ingredients but really nice. Made with steamed asparagus and baby fingerling potatoes. Put on 450 for 20 min then let sit for ten- turns out nicely.

Thanks to all the reviews, I cut down on the stock going into the sauce and added the pan drippings. Even though I didn't reduce the cooking time quite enough for my convection oven and the lamb got to 160 degrees inside, it was done perfectly for my taste and my medium-rare loving guests still remarked at how juicy and flavorful it was. I will make this again!

Wow, this is simply divine and it's a keeper. In future, I will use beef or pork spare ribs instead (as my younger son doesn't like lamb and also lamb is way too costly). I will also half the sauce which would be sufficient. Overall, both marinate and sauce are supper yummy.

I made this dish for Passover and now my daughter claims that she keeps dreaming about it. She wants me to make it again for her when she has her baby in a few weeks. Delicious!

This was great and relatively easy to make. Served it with swiss chard and mash yams with apples! A keeper for sure.

My husband and I thought this was absolutely delicious! Not hard at all. I did some things different... I reduced the initial sauce by half and didn't have any onions or carrots on hand at the time. ( didn't have to strain it... yay!) I also cooked the lamb to 140 F. I have a continuous thermometer, so I pulled it out at 135 F. The lamb was wonderful at medium- medium- rare to medium- rare, which my husband prefers. I will prepare this again... next time for a group!

Loved this recipe - it was easy and quick, and the sauce was fantastic both on the lamb and the mashed potatoes on the side!

Rating: 4
divine! marinated the lamb in the honey glaze on the baking sheet for a couple hours before roasting, and only roasted for about 28 min before hitting 130F, but otherwise made exactly according to recipe (a real rarity for me). one note: there is NO way this recipe makes 4 cups of sauce -- once you boil it down for 15-20 minutes, there is far less sauce there than what you started with. and believe me, you will want every last drop of it.

Rating: 2
The rack of ribs was good, but there was a couple of things about the recipe that put me off! The sauce makes up roughly 4 cups of sauce and the colour was not very appealing. I like sauce, but not a cup of sauce per person!! You could barely taste the marinade. I also found the cooking time was off. Instead of getting medium rare ribs, I got medium well. With so many good recipes out there, I probably won't make this again

My fiance decided at the last minute on Valentine's Day that I should make rack of lamb. I searched my city for lamb, and found that it could only be ordered, so I substituted a lean pork rack. It was outstanding! The sauce, especially, was out of this world!

Rating: 3
Really spectacular dish. Easy to prepare, including sauce (total prep time of 45 mins or so). Sauce really made the dish, so would not skip that even though am sure the lamb would taste good without it. Served with rosemary mashed potatoes.

My spouse and I thought that the sauce was superfulous. The glaze was wonderful and we would certainly make the rack of lamb again without the glaze. It's a nice chance of the tradational breadcrumb and dijon must method.

I only made the honey/soy glaze, and used it to marinate the meat for a few hours. It was very easy and gave a nice flavor to the lamb. I would definately make this recipe again.

My husband and I have a rating system, 1 to 5 stars. One is awful, 5 is omigod! Very few dishes get the omigod star. This definitely did! We paired it with creamy mashed potatoes, sauteed garlic spinach, and a California Zinfandel. Very impressive presentation!

I served the lamb and the sauce at a sit-down dinner for 12. Followed the suggestion to marinate the racks overnight. Also served the sauce, which I made a day ahead. "Best lamb chops I ever had" was one comment. Very well received.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I halved the recipe as it was meant for two persons and it turned out great. I did not change a thing. Yum..

This is an excellent recipe. I am not a huge lamb fan, and made this as a special request for my boyfriend. I ate every bite with gusto! The only thing I changed was I used loin chops, rather than the rack of lamb. Racks were unavailable. Came out beautifully! I will be making this again very soon!

I marinated the lamb for a few hours before cooking. The lamb & sauce turned out perfect. It is a great recipe. I will be cooking it again.

My wife loved it; said it was best rack lamb recipe she has had (I make it as often as possible) I thought it was just good, not great because I think I prefer herb-like crusts on my lamb. Next time I will pan sear it before roasting it to get a nice brown outer crust. FYI - For a perfect med-rare, i only roasted for 25 minutes and rested 5 minutes.

I marinaded lamb in the glaze overnight, then braised it in a skillet on all sides and only then baked it. It was fabulous! Even my picky mother-in-law said that never ate lamb better than that and was telling her family about it on the phone, how GOOD it was! I did make the sauce and added garlic like other reviewers suggested. The rack of lamb was SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOD by itself that the sauce was not needed, even though the sauce was very good too. Next time I won't make the sauce unless I'm making dinner for picky friends I'm trying to impress, so it looks like i have the sauce to go with it, otherwise, DON'T BOTHER AND ENJOY YOUR LAMB!

I have been trying to get the "perfect" sauce for lamb. This is it!

Would rate 10+ if had that choice. This was the best rack of lamb we ever ate, bar none! Resisted my urge to add garlic (we love the stuff) but made the fatal mistake of cutting sauce in half for the one rack we were cooking....too bad...had to make a full complement of sauce the next day for the leftover rack and to freeze for our next red meat day. The lamb was perfect, the sauce was perfect and this will be our next company dish. Served with a roasted red potatoe/feta cheese/artichoke dish one night and garlic mashed the next. Both were good accompaniments as was the asparagus done in a variety of ways. Loved it!!

On a cold night in February, this lamb embodied my love for my sweetheart. Smooth, soft on the tongue, subtly building a pleasing balance of flavor in the rare combination of sweet and savory. Pair with a Cabernet up to the challenge of aging beautifully.

This recipe was easy and delicious! I agree with the reviewer who suggested foil on the pan. The lamb was just the best we've had when cooked this way. Will absolutely make this again. Fantastic and easy!

This lamb was delicious but too sweet for my own personal taste. I prefer my lamb with a strong garlic, rosemary flavor. This is a great recipe for those that might not be great fans of lamb. My daughter and husband loved it and they don't care for lamb very much.

I made this using the exact recipe - it was the best rack of lamb I've ever had. The only change I would make is to line the pan with foil to make clean-up easier.

Absolutely scrumptious! Both the glaze and sauce were wonderful. Will not be making mint jelly when eating lamb again!

This recipe a sure saver. I used only one rack of Canadian lamb (for 2) but the whole recipe for the sauce. I will use the leftovers to make a soup. I marinated the lamb in the glaze for about 2 hours prior to cooking. Flavour was great. Served with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes. My girlfriend had never eaten lamb before and loved it.

Rating: 3
Quick and easy. Enjoyed the sweetness of the glaze. Will try with other meats (I'm still not quite sure if I truly like the taste of lamb - the thought of it is usually better than the reality). Like another reader, served with rice with a 'twist' (3/4 c. orzo browned in 1 T. butter, 3/4 c. long-grain rice plus 3 cups low-salt chicken broth). Try this side dish - easy and tasty.

Rating: 4
Yum Yum! Very nice and subtle, really lets the lamb flavor come through. The sauce was delicious! We plated the lamb over rice to soak it up. I cut the recipe in 1/2 for 2 of us, but could have easily given up our side dishes and eaten the 2 racks of lamb, it was so delicious!

This was terrific!! I am incapable of leaving a recipe as is, I 've just got to tweak it a bit, so I added a little fresh rosemary and balsamic vinegar to the marinade, and I grilled it, rather than roasting in the oven. The sauce was just exceptional, and I'll use it again for beef. Again, I added a bit of balsamic and shallots, didn't use the chicken stock, and and used consomme instead of beef broth. Yummy, can't wait to make it for company! A definate keeper!!!

This was delicious. The sauce makes this dish, though, so don't pass it up. It's a simple gravy that my guests raved about. It's would be great with any hearty dish and was perfect with parmesan mashed potatoes. Wonderful.

This is a fabulous recipe! The lamb with the glaze was tender and delicious, and the sauce is out of this world! I'd make the sauce by itself for other meat dishes. We served this at Easter with roasted potatoes and sauteed mushrooms.

Wow! My husband, six-year-old, and I were licking our fingers and wishing we had two more racks . . . and I didn't even make the sauce! It is fantastic with just the glaze, but I will make the sauce next time. I would recommend "choice" grade lamb from the U.S. (vs. Australia/New Zealand) for its milder taste, but this is just my preference.

Made this tonight with both the glaze and the sauce. Would give it five forks if able to do so---and I'm a harsh critic of my own cooking. This was sublime. Halved the recipe for just the two of us, and we devoured the entire rack (from Costco). The sauce is sublime---and, luckily, there's some left over. Will freeze it and use it again---perhaps with beef tenderloin steaks. An extra plus is that the sauce can be made ahead of time (did so this weekend), so it made for a very special weekday meal. Will definitely go in the file for company meals. Don't hesitate to make this. It's wondeful.

I've served this several times and my company won't stop until they have sauce on both ears. I don't understand why some folks think the sauce needs something, I simply use fresh ingredients, merlot wine and double the mustard/honey addition to the sauce and 'viola'.

Help! When I made this, the glaze for the lamb esentially kept dripping off onto the baking dish and eventually the glaze began to burn. How can I prevent this? When all was said and done, my fiancee said the lamb was "okay" but not as good as the lamb with shallot and thyme crust.

I made this with four racks of lamb for a large group and everyone (including me) raved about it. The sauce quantity was too generous when doubled, which wasn't too much of a problem as we used the remainder just about every night for the next week-and-a-half.
