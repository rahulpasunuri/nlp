I made this for thanksgiving and all meat eaters were wowed with presentation. It was a delightful departure from the ordinary. Such a unique combination of tastes and smells. I enjoyed every aspect of this stuffing. I was so excited when it was done, and was so happy with the result!

I've made this dressing for multiple Thanksgiving meals. I have skipped stuffing it in the pumpkin, due to lack of space in the oven. However, it was amazing by itself. While some reviewers were not fond of the apricots and prunes, I found the flavor profile to be interesting, and complimented other traditional Thanksgiving dishes well. Well worth the effort.

This is easily the most impressive thing on the table and my FAVORITE thing to do for Thanksgiving. It's also now my favorite reason to go pumpkin picking - the one important thing to consider is the right size & shaped pumpkin for the pot you will be using to steam it. I've found that if you are feeding a large crowd, you will need a fairly large stockpot, and preferably WIDER to accomodate getting the pumpkin in and out of the pot. This can be challenging, especially once steamed, as the pot, water and pumpkin are VERY hot. You don't want to leave the pumpkin in the pot until everything is completely cooled, however, b/c it will begin to collapse in on itself and your presentation will suffer. (That was a sad discovery one year.) Also important to note - I never cook it with the top on (especially if you are using a bigger pumpkin). There's no way the heat will transmit all the way through in order to get the stuffing cooked to the right temp and safe to eat. Instead, once stuffed, I loosely cover the opening with foil (shiny side pointing inward toward the stuffing) and insert a few [COMPLETELY] stainless steel knives poked down thru the foil with about one inch still sticking up visibly. This way, there is heat conducivity all the way thru to the middle and you don't have to worry about a cold center. Hope all of this helps - ENJOY!

I haven't tried this yet, but it looks good. I might switch out the bread for mixed grains with sauteed onions and I think the other suggestion of the dried cranberries sounds good too.

The more fruit the better - serving in the pumpkin is just a great idea - I also serve chili or soup in one on Halloween - this was great.

I made this stuffing without the pumpkin, as there are no vegetarians in my household, and I couldn't figure out how to fit a pumpkin in beside the turkey. I added a whole bag of walnuts to mine, and a hefty bundle of finely chopped fresh parsley, which was nice, but I forgot to add the tamari. I topped it with a few pats of butter, packed tightly into a glass baking pan, and after 40 minutes, it was fine. If I was to make this again, I would be more heavy handed with the salt and pepper, and add some garlic and mushrooms, along with maybe some diced apple, but it was ok. The stuffing by itself was sort of "eh"-- not bad, but just a little boring-- but I do plan on making a stuffed pumpkin next time I have veggie people over, as I love the creativity of it. (And to the cook who condemned the notion of prines and apricots in stuffing, you're missing out. Try it, and add some dried cranberries, raisins, and apples too!)

Blech! I just don't think prunes and apricots belong in Thanksgiving stuffing. I brought this in to work (where they will eat anything) and no one else like it either. I'm going back to my old, stand by, vegeterian stuffing recipe.

Good stuff, good presentation. I did prep cooking and chopping on Sunday and was able to cook it on a week day. It had to cook a lot longer than noted and my pumpkin was evidently way smaller than anticipoated because I used about 40% of the stuffing.

I made this for thanksgiving. It was much easier than I expected (stuffing a pumpkin sounded a little intimidating), and was a great hit. I couldn't find pickapeppa, so I rubbed garam masala and maple syrup on the inside of the pumkin before stuffing it. I also saved some of the pumkin meat, sauteed it with garam masala, and added it to the stuffing. The end result was gorgeous and delicious.

I made this last year, and I'm back again for another go around. This time I'm thinking of trying a large heirloom winter squash instead of the pumpkin for more flavor. I love the dried fruit in the stuffing--although I'm going to use ready made bread crumbs this year as I'm making it at my mother in law's house--she is much less patient with cooking than I am. I have a feeling this is going to become an ireplacable tradition in our halfway vegetarian home. (the in-laws have a bird)
