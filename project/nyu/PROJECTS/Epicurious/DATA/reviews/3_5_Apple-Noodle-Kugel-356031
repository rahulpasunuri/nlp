Good recipe. Everyone loved it. I made a couple of changes however. First off, I used my food processor with the grating blade and it worked just fine. Second, I replaced the nutmeg with half nutmeg/half cinammon. I also strongly recommend mixing the dry stuff first, or you may end up with clumps of cinammon or nutmeg. Finally, I made a double-order and baked in in a 13x9x2 pan, requiring an additional 10-15 minutes.

The recipe was delicious, Great non dairy kugel. I doubled the recipe and made a few changes.Added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and raisins. Also added cornflake/brown sugar and cinnamon topping. Would definitely make it again

I loved this recipe as is. I accidentally left out the nutmeg, and it was fine without, but I'll probably add it next time. I also used medium-sized egg noodles, because that's what I could find. This kugel is a new holiday staple for me.

I add raisins as well as the apples. since I am not fond of nutmed, I used cinnamon. YUMMO

This recipe looks good. I'm always looking for new and easy noodle kugel recipes. As a kosher cook I would probably not want this to be dairy so I would substitute margarine for the butter and skip the accompaniment. If anyone's looking for great kosher substitutions, it's worth checking out www.gourmetkoshercooking.com

I really liked this recipe. It wasn't the greatest Kugel I've ever had, but it's a great starting point (especially since I've never made Kugel before). Next time I'll probably use a bit less sugar, and maybe add some raisins for tartness. I'll also probably use the wide egg noodles rather than the fine, but that's just a personal preference based on texture. All in all, a very tasty meal.

I liked this dish, and it had a nice apple flavor, but it didn't have the traditional kugel texture and was a bit too sweet. The shredded apple prevented the custard from being creamy. I will definitely try to work with this recipe, maybe using fewer or more finely shredded apples and reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup plus extra for the topping. Very tasty, but not don't expect it to be like grandma used to make.
