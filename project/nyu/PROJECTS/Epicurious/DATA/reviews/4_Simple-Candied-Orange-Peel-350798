I used same sugar to water ratio but doubled the amount of orange peels. After the first three blanchings, I scrapped off as much of the white pith as I could off of the softened peels. After fishing out the peels, I added cranberries and a bit of Gran Marnier to make a quick, simple, "recycled" cranberry sauce!

So good and so easy, but I was surprised the recipe said to drain the final syrup product. After removing the orange peels for sugaring/drying, I continue to boil the syrup down, and it becomes this wonderful orange liquid gold. So delicious. Just used some this morning on my oatmeal, but also great on pancakes or in recipes where a little liquid sweetener won't mess up proportions (or that you can compensate for).

I made a few variations of this--candied orange & grapefruit peel, half dipped in sugar, and half dipped in dark chocolate. I used 4 oranges and 3 grapefruit and still was able to make it all fit in the pot with the simple syrup. The chocolate & orange dipped were the best! I melted 2 Chocolove 65% bars.

I make this every christmas and instead of tossing in sugar (during the last step), I drain the excess syrup and allow the peel to dry on a sheet of wax paper for a few days. Then I dip them in dark chocolate and allow to harden. Its a favorite with everyone!

The beautiful fragrance that fills your home while preparing these will make your mouth water. These turned out perfect!

Just as good with lemon peel. Used 3 lemons in place of 2 oranges. Also, used the leftover simple sugar with (orange or lemon) oil in baking other goods, then decorated with the peel. Delicious!

I think it's great. And it's just like my mom did grapefruit peel. I have an old gas stove with pilot lights so the oven stays very warm. I dried mine on parchment there and it was great! I'm making tons to sell at the church bazaar. Just testing for now.

I've just finished making this recipe which I followed exactly with no changes and, voila, pretty and delicious candied orange peel. I'll be using some in a recipe for Cassata from a Sicilian cook book and using the rest for garnish, snacking, etc. Many thanks Epicurious.

These are delicious but I would like to add two comments. I think they would be better using a super-fine sugar rather than regular granulated. Also, it might not be necessary to simmer for so long. My peels got so tender that when I coated them (very gently!!) in sugar, some of them just fell apart. Didn't spoil the taste, though. I will make again using my own suggestions.

Very easy and great results. I used 3 oranges and still had plenty of syrup left over. I dried them in the oven on low for about 30-40 minutes and then finished drying them in the open air over night. I will definitely make this again, but will use 4-5 oranges next time. Excellent.

I agree that this is a very good recipe, with one caveat. I found out what happened with the 1st reviewer, whose orange peel turned into a burnt haystack looking mess. I almost got there. I have a commercial stove, and the flame is hotter than on regular home stoves. I set my timer and walked away, checking only a couple minutes before the timer went off. The sugar syrup had caramelized so the orange peel was caramelized too. Another couple of minutes, and it would have been burned. Didn't look so good but tastes fine. The point to remember is not to trust timing instructions. Check in until the peel is very soft. If it starts to caramelize, take it out before it burns!

took other reader's advice and baked them in the oven for about 15 min to speed up the drying process

So easy to make. The orange peels look like little gems right when they're ready to be coated in sugar. They taste amazing. I stuck them in the oven at the lowest temperature the oven permitted (170 F) and checked them every five minutes. They were done in about fifteen minutes. They taste... wonderful!

Some recipes say that if you are using navel oranges you do not need to boil the peel drain, rinse, etc. Not true. Even navel oranges must be boiled first. I've also used another recipe that heated the peel in a sauce pan with grand marnier. Very tasty. I've used it with clementines and lemons - all resulted in tasty candied peels.

Easy and delicious! From now on, when I'm juicing oranges, I know what to do with all those leftover peels.

I served this orange peel with chocolates at a family gathering. It was a huge hit! To speed the process, I spread my peel over parchment on baking sheets and dried it in the oven on very low heat.

Worked like a charm. I was able to do 3 oranges worth without increasing any of the other ingredients. I added a bit of orange oil to the leftover poaching water and am wondering what sort of fabulous thing i can make with it. also considering putting the finished products in a low oven to dry them out quicker. not sure.

Easy and perfect results. My mom's favorite. Also good with half the strip dipped in chocolate after the candy has set a couple days.

Very very easy recipe to complete with tasty results. The leftover syrup from the final curing process can also be saved and used as espresso syrup; a great way to make small but tasty gifts for friends and family.

Hmm. Somehow during the sugar-water-simmer-for-45-minutes part I turned this into a burnt, smoking mess of what looks like molasses with hay in it.
