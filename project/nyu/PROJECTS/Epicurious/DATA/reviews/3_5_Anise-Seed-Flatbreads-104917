Delicious, and my 3 guests ate a couple dozen of these with the carrot and orange soup with tarragon and brandy. However, when I make them again I might leave some oats whole for more texture (perhaps I ground them too finely) and reduce the salt on top. As easy as making pie crust and certainly worth repeating.

What a find! You can't buy such delicious crackers anywhere. I sprinkle with coarse sea salt before baking. The oats make for a great texture. Easy to make.

I found it quick to make, and quite versatile. I substituted caraway and fresh thyme on half of it with excellent results. A wonderful minimum fuss snack.

Time consuming to make but result is a thin crisp cracker that complemented the shrimp bisque with pernod (also delicious), and should be good with cheese as a snack.
