We make this recipe all the time- it's one of our faves! By itself, great for lunch. If we want something heartier, we'll have a bowl of soup with it. We'll often add zucc, cheese, sesame seeds, etc. Guac is a great substitute for mayo!

I did not measure my lime juice, but I'm quite sure I used more than was necessary and I loved it. The whole sandwich is one I will be making variations of for years to come. I agree with the reviewer just before this one who said don't skip the onions. I skipped the cilantro the first time, used it the second time, and can safely say don't skip the cilantro either. I can already think of so many substitutions to keep the sandwich interesting: radishes, sprouts, water chestnuts, hummus. Despite what other reviewers are suggesting, one thing I would never add is cheese. To me, cheese too often overpowers the fresh natural taste of vegetables. In short, this is a rockin' good sandwich.

very good recipe, the onions really make it, don't skip those.

To my taste, as it stands it is three forks. I put it on a really fresh and thick whole wheat bread, with seeds, added some Monteray Jack, and cut down on the lime. I also put some fresh radish sprouts in there. It's delicious and very filling. Yum!

Cut down on the garlic and lime juice. Added salt to the guacamole; would have added tabasco if I had it. Delicious sandwiches! Made for a quick but very satisfying dinner.

My sister & I used whole wheat wraps instead of whole wheat bread. It makes a great lunch, it is not to heavy. We variet them however and added into some slices grilled chicken pieces. We will definitly make this again.

I loved this recipe and it was very popular with friends. I added the onion and cilantro to the avocado and mixed it in. I also adjusted the lime juice, I used a little less, but I loved this sandwich and will definitely make it again for a picnic or light lunch.

My mother and I made this after going shopping and realizing that we had all the ingredients. It is a nice refreshing sandwich that would be perfect for vegitarians, brunch parties, or just a way to use up leftover guacamole. I know my husband wouldn't be too crazy about it, but I enjoyed it and will be making it again.

This is actually probably somewhere between 2 and 3 forks. I ended up substituting Monterey Jack cheese for the cucumber, since I'm not a fan of the latter. The resulting sandwich was quite good (though I couldn't really taste the guacamole), but needed some lettuce for texture. Also, I could barely taste anything but the lime juice in the guacamole.
