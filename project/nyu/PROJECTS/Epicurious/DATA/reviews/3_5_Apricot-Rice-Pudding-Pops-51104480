As popsicles these are a little weird. I wanted them to be a little weird in a good way, but as it turns out, they're just mildly strange. BUT, I couldn't fit all the filling in my popsicles mold, and had some the next day. This is the worlds most perfect rice pudding. Really amazing. Contrary to what I might have thought, a mere three tablespoons of rice, sets up when chilled to the perfect consistency.
