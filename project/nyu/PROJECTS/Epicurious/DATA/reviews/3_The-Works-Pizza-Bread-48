I altered the filling somewhat (I didn't like the idea of the purchased caponata, and yes, it is an expensive filling as written) so my comments and rating only relate to the general idea here. I liked the "pizza-bread" concept, but it was very hard to cut into serving pieces. Surprisingly, it reheated pretty well: wrapped in foil in a very hot oven, then opened up the foil for a few more minutes to let it crisp up.

This makes a large pizza, but with all the ingredients, it is expensive to make . I found the taste to be off somehow. Maybe if I would have made my own eggplant instead of purchasing the caponata, it would have been more authentic.
