Made this recipte as is and it was just what I wanted. Certainly tastes better than Vigo and not much more time.

UGH. Ugh and ew. I followed the suggestion of the reviewer who said increase the peppers and onion to 1/4 cup and double the garlic [I quadrupled], in addition to the recommendations to apply a liberal dose of salt and it was *still* flavorless, dull, boring, bland and a serious embarrassment to the rest of the food at the table. This is a dish that wouldn't pass the authenticity muster at a Taco Bell in Oslo, much less anywhere that anyone currently possesses taste buds. DO NOT MAKE THIS RICE.

This was my first time making a sofrito and I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't measure the ingredients exactly but I probably doubled them. Next time I will triple them. I used orange bell peppers and it looked beautiful on the plate. The turmeric gave it a subtle earthy flavor. I served it with the orange braised chicken thighs with green olives and the combination of the rice and sauce was outstanding! It made enough to serve me and my husband with leftovers. I will definitely make this dish again; in fact I'm going to add it to my recipe box right now!

I gave this 4 forks because for what it is, a simple yellow rice recipe, it is exceptionally good in flavor, easy to make and is consistently good each time. I agree with other reviewers who say that the recipe is best with the sofrito increased and that the ratio of 1 cup rice to 2 cups water serves four nicely.

If you season this enough with salt it ends up tasting amazing - I also used more sofrito than what was called for - probably double the amount. I served it with the Orange Braised Chicken Thighs with Olives from this site and the combo of the sauce from that dish with this rice was super.

Not a fan of bell peppers so I used pablano's. Double the amount of peppers and garlic. Served this with some dark meat of chicken to present a great meal.

This was great. I did follow advice of other reviewers and used more of the sofrito ingredients. Also used 1 cup rice and 2 cups water. Much better that a packaged rice, in my opinion. Served with Pork Chops marinated in Mojo and quick-braised asparagus. A picture perfect plate.

For a family of 6 - use 2 cups rice, 3 cups water, 2 tsp salt, and triple to quadruple everything else. A complement to my "Saucy Chicken".

One cup of rice with two cups of water and double the rest. Just right for the four of us.

Very good.Just right.

This is a great, easy standby side dish. An easy way to pump up the flavor is to double or triple the soffrito ingredients. Then, if you really feel like cheating, use a packaged yellow rice mix (like vigo or goya). Vary the sofrito ingredients to coordinate with the type of cuisine you are making, middle eastern, asian, latin, etc. and you may find yourself making impromptu versions of this dish quite regularly.

Ignore the proportions for the onion, bell pepper, coriander, and garlic. Use at least 1/4 cup for each and just double the garlic. It turned out very flavorful. A real keeper!

We really liked this recipe a lot, although I did add more cilantro (coriander) and red bell pepper than called for (actually, I added a bit more of all seasonings!) It went quite well with the Orange Braised Chicken Thighs With Green Olives as suggested in the chicken recipe. My husband insisted I add this to my recipe file so looks like I'll be making it again!!

It's true - it's not a spectacular tasting dish, but my is it pretty! The green and red flecks of pepper against the yellow, tumeric-flavoured rice. It's very appealing to the eye and dresses up the plate. Just don't make it your star dish.

This dish smelled outstanding. The flavor was a tad bland, but still tasty enough. I spruced it up with some salt when I ate it, which helped a lot. It was very easy to make.
