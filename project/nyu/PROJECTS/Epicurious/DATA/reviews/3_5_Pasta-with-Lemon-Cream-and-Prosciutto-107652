Delicious! I use half skim and half whole milk instead of cream, and throw in a bit of cornstarch to thicken. I also tend to use onion with a touch of garlic instead of shallots. Goes very well with seafood, and you can easily swap out the peas for spinach, mushrooms, etc.

I substituted the peas w/ asparagus and it was great - added a better "crunch" factor. I'd recommend using green asparagus cut in 1-inch pieces that's boiled first and then soaked in ice water.

I had to make mucho changes to the recipe cause I discovered the pantry was bare but this still turned out so good that I cannot wait to make it with the proper ingredients. I wanted to cut back the fat so I used coffee cream instead of whipping cream (lots of fat cut back there hehe) and I didn't have an orange so I zested a couple of clementines. No peas so I used fresh snow peas and no proscuitto so it was bacon. Oh but it worked so well. This is going into the cast of regulars.

This pasta is now a family favorite. Instead of draping prosciutto over the pasta, I finely chop the meat and mix it into the cream sauce just before serving. The way the mint and peas mingle with the zest is amazing. You won't be sorry you made this one...

this was a phenominal recipe- granted we were making it in the South of France with the best produce which didn't hurt, but it was one of the best lunches i've had. we did omit the orange peel, and instead of draping prosciutto at the end, we fried bacon chopped into little bits, whose residual fat we used to saute the shallots. wonderful.

great dish.. but make double the sauce! it was not enough. the flavors taste very sophisticated, a great meal to impress guests with.

This is one of my favorite ever recipes, and comes off as very fancy for guests. I am personally not a huge fan of peas, and make it with steamed cut up asparagus instead. The mint totally makes the dish. I have also served it with seared sea scallops on top to make it more of a main dish. I've also made it vegetarian with veggie stock, and left guests to add their own prosciutto on top. You will not be disappointed!

Yum yum yum. I made it as written but substituted fresh linguine and added some grilled chicken at the end. A hit with the whole family (5 and 3 year old included). Fast and easy for a weeknight.

I made this without the prosciutto. I'm really glad I did. I think the prosciutto would have taken away from the delicate flavors of the orange and mint. This was very very good. A cream sauce that is light and not heavy.

I had this dish for company, and it was a huge hit! I did make some significant changes, however, to lighten up the recipe. Instead of using the full amount of butter and cream, I actually used a variation with butter/cornstarch/half and half. even for those who don't believe in low fat substitutions I think it was really good and satisfyingly rich. The citrus touch was awesome--something i had never tasted before in a cream sauce.

love this -- make it all the time with asparagus (cut on the bias, dumped in boiling water and left on high for 2 min) plus the full amt. of cayenne and of course the mint.

Rating: 3
I made this last night and really loved it. I made the version with asparagus and basil that many suggested, though. Unfortunately, my boyfriend isn't that into peas. We love asparagus, though, so I blanched some and it worked really well. I used chiffonade of basil and crushed red pepper instead of cayenne, since I was out of the cayenne. Also, I used only four pieces of prosciutto cut into ribbony strips, which was plenty. I think eight slices would be too many. The leftovers were good for our lunches today, too.

Fantastic. I used fresh egg fettucini which worked great--it really absorbed the sauce. The orange and mint really make this dish. I did cut the cayenne in half per the suggestion of other reviewers, and I think that was a good move.

This was really good! I served it as a main course with some sauted scallops. I did use a lot less butter than the recipe called for and next time I will make it with less cayenne. I really did love the combination of cool, from the mint, and heat, from the cayenne though.

Rating: 4
While the ingredients seem a little odd, when put all together it was a delicious dish! I cannot wait to make it again! Since we are not fond of that many peas, I took the suggestion of asparagus. I used about 1 1/2 c. cut asparagus and 1/2 c. frozen peas. I had to cook just a few minutes longer to get the asparagus done, but it worked out! I also I love the little heat from the cayenne.

This tasted very good. The lemon and mint is so good together. I cut the peas down to just 1 cup, which still seemed like plenty. I also used just a dash of cayenne because 1/4 tsp. is an awful lot - even for spicy food lovers like us. I threw in some garlic too. Do use the mint. I would never put basil in this dish. The prosciutto was good, but expensive. I may just skip it next time.

This dish was perfect in every way! The only change I made was to pan fry the prosciutto. Next time I will double or triple the sauce! I love this, but will save it for an occasion or use it as a teaser type appetizer, as the calorie and fat count is disgustingly high, hence the reason it TASTES SO DARN GOOD!

Made this last night as a "trial" run for a Spring baby shower I am hosting. As expected, this is pretty in presentation and a delicious, different, interesting dish. The pinks and greens and creamy white sauce will look pretty on a buffet, and it is amazing in flavor as well. Such different flavors mixed together work perfectly. I did end up adding only a cup and a half peas, and still a touch more cream. I would not change a thing otherwise. I tasted the sauce as it was simmering before adding the mint, prosciutto, and cheese on top, and I was nervous....was not great. But the mint, the saltiness of the meat and cheese somehow bring it all together. I am going to make ahead just before guests arrive, up to the point of adding the broth and reducing, then leave the pan on the stove. When I am ready to serve, will add the cream, and the other ingredients, which I will have pre sliced and measured (mint, lemon and orange peels etc.) Not totally a make ahead dish but definitely the kind of dish you can prepare then throw together quickly for a small crowd.

This has got to be one of the best pasta dishes ive tasted. I tweaked it a lot though, didnt use prosciutto. Instead, added slices of chicken breast to the sauce. I sauted some garlic as well as some red pepper slices in. Didnt cook it with the peas nor used the grated orange peel. But i followed the rest of the recipe as a guide. For me, the most important is the addition of some chili, to give it a tangy and a subtle spicy taste. Wonderful!

So awesome. I've made this twice and plan to add it to the regular rotation. Two substitutions that worked really well: use crisped bacon or pancetta instead of the prosciutto; and replace peas with thinly sliced brussels sprouts.

A sheer masterpiece! Even my toddler, (who happens to eat only fries and ice cream), loved this pasta dish. I used it for a dinner party, and about a million people asked if I could print up the recipe for me. My Dogue de Bordeaux even ate a little, without me knowing. The citrus made it zesty and outstanding, a dish beyond compare. I'll definitely be making this one in the near future; even if it is just me it has to delight!

Delicious though unusual dish. I was wary of using a thin meat like prosciutto over pasta, so I panfried some pancetta with white onions, and tossed it with the lemon, mint and cream over fusilli pasta. Made for a delicious dish that's great for any season! Will certainly make this dish again.

I thought this was perfectly yummy. It's a simple, inexpensive (except for the proscuitto) weeknight meal. I agree that you need a more interesting shaped pasta than angel hair; I used whole wheat fusilli.We had it with a side of cherry tomatoes fresh from the garden. Out on the porch with a nice albarino, it became a delectable summer supper, and one I will make again and again!

I have made this dish several times with rave reviews from my family. I have opted to omit the cayenne because I have two small children. It is very creamy, lemony and is easy to double for large family gatherings. I made it the first time exactly as the recipe states and the next time with cubed prosciutto cooked in the sauce instead of draped which seemed to give the sauce more flavor. I will continue to make it this way because it just tasted better. Everyone even my Mother-in-Law who hates peas loved it! I will continue to make it, this is definitely a keeper.

The recipe base is good but needs a little more flavor! I added a carton of sliced mushrooms and 3 TBSP minced garlic to onion saute. I left out the peas & mint. I added 1lb. of medium shrimp and a bag of spinach to the final stage of cooking. I also added ground black pepper and a pinch of ground red chilies and served grated parmesan cheese on top. My family loved it! This recipe will be added to our dinner menu. For the buget shopper, chicken breast could replace the shrimp.

I will definitely make it again, but without the peas. The prosciutto (pan seared) and the citrus taste great, but we found that the taste of the peas "killed" the subtle (and delicious) taste of the lemon and orange. Like some of the other reviewers, I used bowtie pasta instead of penne.

Rating: 3
Really very nice. Used blanched asparagus and morels instead of peas, and used 1 lemon's worth of zest instead of the orange and lemon peel. Also omitted the salt b/c of the saltiness of prosciutto (but used plenty of fresh ground pepper). Seared the prosciutto quickly in saucepan, then added the prepared sauce, then added the al dente pasta. Everything was tasty and flavorful and yummy!

Absolutely wonderful! My husband and I really enjoyed this for dinner lastnight.

This recipe was okay. I made it exactly as written. I can think of better things to do with Prosciutto and cream and I think pan searing prosciutto in any recipe really brings out a much richer flavor although I didn't try it with this recipe. I though it tasted good, but I wouldn't put it at 4 forks- my girlfriend said the same.

Great recipe. Everyone loved it and quite readily gave it 4 forks when asked. I did cut back on the cayenne as well.

I followed this recipe to the letter, except that I used fresh peas from the farmer's market rather than the frozen suggested. They provided an excellent touch, and I would recommend that you steam them for about five minutes before adding to the sauce. My fiance and I absolutely loved this dish. The lemon and orange peel provided a nice citrus touch without being overbearing, and the mint was a perfect touch. Simple, delicious and excellent leftovers-- perfect!

This is really yummy stuff. I followed the recipe pretty closely except that, as suggested by other reviewers, I chopped the prosciutto and added it with the mint.

This is an excellent pasta dish. I agree with the comment about incorporating prosciutto pieces into the dish. I am sure draping a slice over the top makes a lovely restaurant presentation, but at home I find cutting it in advance makes it easier to eat.

I love Cafe Juanita, the restaurant at which chef Holly Smith concocts her miracles, and so when I saw this recipe from her here I grabbed it and tried it. It's delicious, and despite its somewhat highbrow sound, actually presents and eats as a wonderfully homey, authentic northern Italian dish. I found the amount of cayenne a bit much (even for my spice-loving palate) and would cut back a bit next time. My only other change would be to tear up the prosciutto and integrate it (or substitute some italian ham) into the dish; draping it is elegant but makes the dish hard to eat unless your guests like to use their hands (or a knife). Overall a wonderful and relatively easy dish.
