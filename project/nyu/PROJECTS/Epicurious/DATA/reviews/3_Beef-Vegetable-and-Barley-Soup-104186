I made this soup by first browning the meat, then followed the directions except I omitted the mushrooms and beans. Added fresh celery, carrots and a bag of frozen vegetables. The soup was hearty and delicious. Everyone seemed to enjoy it. I will make it again.

I omitted the tomatoes, beans, and bay leaf. (I can't smell very well, so bay is mostly wasted on me. Tomato gives my heartburn. TMI.) I also went totally random on the quantities, because this, for me, was an exercise in using veggies that needed used. So a full head of celery, a mess of carrots, and a few turnips. I'd do something a little softer than brisket next time. Also: more barley. That stuff was good. I threw in a glass of Siraz for good measure, and a bunch of pepper. No salt. The broth took care of that, thanks. It was VERY good. Especially for one of my efforts. I'm really a pathetic cook. Quite pleased with this.

Can't understand why this recipe wasn't rated higher, because we loved it. My wife and I ate 3 bowls each; and my 9-year-old, who hates mushrooms, just picked around them and ate everything else. The leftovers were taken to work and devoured by coworkers. We used the Zinfandel beef stock recipe on this website. You need to double the barley; 1/3 cup is not enough. We had no kidney beans on hand, so we substituted one peeled, diced potato. Tastes great left over.

This isn't a super-fast recipe because you have to cut up all that meat and vegetables, but it's certainly tasty. I left out the garlic (since I was making the soup for those who might not be able to handle garlic)and used a package of fancy mushroom mix (shiitake, portobello, oyster and cremini)instead of the dried shitttakes.

Did A Cook even make this recipe??? It seems questionable because s/he was quite opposed to the addition of bay leaves. Bay leaves are not so offensive as s/he would have you believe, and they are far more versatile!! I didn't make this exact recipe because we are no longer eating beef, due the whole Mad Cow debacle. Instead, we eat bison/buffalo. Because our favorite grocery store only stocks ground buffalo, we had to make do-- we browned the buffalo, added carrots, onions, and celery. Then, we used Onion Broth, because Beef Broth is quite dangerous, if you are nervous about Mad Cow. I used 4 c. of onion broth and 2 c. water. I also added 1/2 can of tomato paste b/c I was out of tomato sauce. I also tripled the amount of barley, which was too much, really. I would just double it the next time! Anyway, it was hearty and delicious. I used a lot of crushed red pepper, and the spice, coupled with the texture, made for a wonderful winter meal!

Instead of 4 cups of water, I used 3, and a cup of red wine. I too left out the okra! Also, I doubled the barley and added 2 medium new potatoes in the last 30 mins. along with fresh smashes garlic. I will use this again, as it's what grandma used to serve!

OK - 6 large cloves of garlic for six servings is too much in this type of soup. Also, tomato souce is lousy - whole peeled tomatoes are much better. And I would skip the beans! Want a better recipe: Use whole peeled tomatoes; beef marrow bones; barley; onions, celery; whatever other veggies you desire. I like basil, rosemary, and a bit of thyme and sage as my seasoning. Bay leaf makes it taste too much like marinara.

tomato sauce in any soup ugh...tomatoes should be well rinsed; before added to any soup...unless tomato soup.

The ingredients sounded fine, result wasn't very good. Sautéing the meat and veggies first might improve the flavor. Next time I'll try the 2/01 B.A. recipe ... it sounds good. P.S. to Meathater: if you hate meat, why on earth did you try this recipe?

This soup was very good and too easy to make. The flavor reminds me of a canned soup I used to have as a kid, but so much more flavorful. I used Chuck meat as for stew and also crimini mushrooms. I will definately make it again and again and again!!!!

I used chuck instead of brisket for improved flavor; skipped the beans as the soup didn't seem to need them. It was very tasty and everyone loved it. I am making it again today.

Good "comfort food". Makes more servings than stated. I used stewing beef and simmered it for a couple of hours. Nice flavours. Will make again.
