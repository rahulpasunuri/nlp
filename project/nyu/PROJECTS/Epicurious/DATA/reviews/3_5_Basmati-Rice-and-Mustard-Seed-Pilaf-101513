We thought this was more than a little bit bland. My husband put so much salt on it I thought I was gonna choke. I think we'll stick with pellao.

Excellent! Try adding toasted slivered almonds and sliced scallions. They give this recipe the boost it needs. So easy, so tasty !!

Great recipe. I made this for 2 using 1/3 cup Jasmine rice, 1 large shallot and olive oil. Sauteeing the mustard seed and rice really adds to the flavor. I served this along side Grilled Salmon with north African Flavor, Eating Well Spring 2004 for a great dinner.

While the recipe has potential, it definitely needed extra flavor. I added a little curry powder and turmeric. I also used chicken broth instead of water. Next time I'll just try start with another recipe.

The only change I made was to substitute olive oil for vegetable oil. We though the rice was very flavorful with and the whole mustard seeds gave it an interesting texture. This will definitely be a new staple at our house.

I used chicken stock and the flavor was just sort of there, not interesting. If I make this again I'll add ginger as a previous reviewer suggested.

I used half a cup of chicken stock and a teaspoon of ginger to intensify the flavour. I served it as an accompaniment to the Spicy Chicken with Yogurt and Dill, which was very good. Slivered almonds would also have tasted good in it. Of course you can dress this one up in many ways. A keeper.

This recipe can be dressed up for any occasion. I added a chiffonade of spinach after adding the water, let it come to boil and then simmered as directed Next time I think I will add some shredded parmesan cheese to give a little more interest or toasted nuts during the saute time.

I loved this rice. So simple yet it adds something to the meal. I will make this one again. And it is so easy. The mustard seeds just adds a subtle flavor, yummy.

Just served this to friends with the Mustard-Roasted Chicken and they liked both. We actually liked the slightly crunchy effect of the mustard seeds. They didn't realize either had mustard in it, however, until I mentioned it. It's a delicate taste. Subtle and a little different. Sure to please.

My family loved this. My six year old even liked it, and will add this to my collection of 'Indian' accompaniments. Served this with Tandoori Chicken and spinach salad. The yellow mustard seeds were just the right touch, and not overbearing in flavor or texture. A real winner!

I first had this recipe at my friends house and was begging her to let me take home the left overs. This is one of those recipes that you find yourself craving! What I love about this side dish (besides it's flavor), is that it goes so well with anything. I love to have it on the side with grilled salmon, or just by it's self for lunch. Everyone who I've made it for, raves about it. The mustard seeds give it a real nutty taste and the shallots are a major key to this recipe. I tried using other types of onions, but shallots give it a sweet unusual taste that other onions fail at. Easy to make, and addictive to basmati rice lovers! Yum!

A good friend recommended another recipe on this site, Jasmine Rice Pilaf with Mustard Seeds. I used the present recipe though, because the proportions suited my needs better. I did, however, use some scallions along with the shallots (which I decreased to one) as in the Jasmine rice. This pilaf is a very nice change from plain rice and I'll make it again. Neither recipe mentioned that both types of rice should be rinsed gently in a bowl in several changes of cool water until the water is clear. Also, either yellow or black mustard seeds can be used. The latter can be purchased in East Indian markets. I found it interesting that while this recipe, for 2/3 cup rice, calls for 1/2 teaspoon salt, the Jasmine rice recipe for 1/2 cup rice, states: 1 teaspoon salt. A good reminder for cooks to use their own judgment on salt amounts.

As usual, I modified slightly because of ingredients I had on hand--I used olive oil and a small onion instead of a shallot. I think the shallot might have given it a touch more flavor--my only complaint--the mustard seeds were "crunchy" which I didn't find desireable in rice. I also didn't use the suggested salt, instead just salted it to taste at the end.

YUMMY!!! This is a definite keeper. Next time I'll double the recipe and use a tad less salt.
