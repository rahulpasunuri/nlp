Wow - really, really good. A "keeper"! Ok, my girlfriend made homemade lemon curd which may have made a difference, but it was pretty much out of this world.

normally, i'm a purist but since cholesterol has become an issue in our home, i used cool whip instead of whipping cream. it was great.

I froze mine like an icecream - came out great. Would not include the raspberries in the mixture though as they end up like rocks. Decorate with the fruit. Will also try making it like a pie for dinner this weekend, topped with fresh berries and cream.

A little too bitter for my taste. This is just okay.

I am not sure if this is TRULY deserving of 4 forks, because I hold those 4 in high regard! However, I gave it 4 because I would not want to discourage anyone from trying this recipe. It is fantastic. Simple, quick, and so good! I followed another reviewer's recommendation and added more zest; I loved it but the less adventurous guests thought it might be a bit TOO lemony. Next time I won't add the extra. Also, whisking the lemon curd is necessary. Overall great recipe!

I've made this many times - with the lemon curd in a jar as well as "home made" and it's always a hit. Great with strawberries and blueberries also. The only recommedation I would make is to be SURE to WHISK the pre-made lemon curd WELL with the fresh juice and zest before folding in the cream - sometimes the curd is has become quite congealed and you don't want it to be lumpy!

I've made this often and it's always welcome -- I just never thought to review it before. This time I cheated rather wildly and it was still great, so I thought I'd leave a note. Because of packaging size, I used two pints of whipped cream, an 11 oz jar of lemon curd, all the zest and juice I could get from two small lemons. I also used frozen raspberries except for fresh to garnish. It was just terrific. I love forgiving recipes!

Lovely! Very light and delicious! No leftovers, just happy smiles.

I altered the parfait slightly because I didn't have any heavy cream, so I just mixed a half part of nonfat plain yogurt into a whole part of the curd. Then I layered in glasses with blackberries and crushed up vanilla cookies for an excellent, easy summer dessert. I will definitely make this again, possibly with the whipping cream but also with the yogurt.

The recipe is easy and very tasty. I recommend adding 1/2 teaspoon more lemon zest.

This was a great light summer dessert. Also very easy to make. I couldn't find lemon curd, so I used lemon pie filling and it turned out great.
