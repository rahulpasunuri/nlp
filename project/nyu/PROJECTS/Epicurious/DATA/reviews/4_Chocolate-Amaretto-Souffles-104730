Excellent recipe. Very easy and tasty. Made without the amaretti and it was still scrumptious.

Fairly simple to prepare and elegant desert

The easiest souffle recipe I've tried! I omitted the amaretto and it came out delicious. Not too sweet and perfectly fluffy and moist inside.

This recipe was outstanding! I wanted to tried it out with a couple friends before I made it for my husband this Valentine's Day and it truly was a success. The directions were very simple to follow. If you like chocolate souffles, may I also recommend the CHOCOLATE-ALMOND SOUFFLE TORTE recipe. It's more time consuming but well worth it. It serves approx 12 and I always add a side of fresh rasberry sauce. I've made it at least 10 times since it's release in 97. It'll melt in your mouth.

Definite winner! I'm not a dessert person, but this came out light, fluffy, and delicious. Made on valentine's day for two couples, I was a hero. I've never baked before, so viewed some technique videos on foodtv.com (melting chocolate, whipping egg whites, etc.) and had no problems.

This is truly memorable. Abandon flourless chocolate cake recipes & serve this for all chocolate lovers (and who isn't?). I substituted 4 oz German sweet choc & 2 oz dark, because that's what I had on hand & added perhaps 1/2 again more cookie crumbs because I used large individual soufle cups. I enjoy experimenting with new recipes - This recipe is quick, easy & worth repeating. My dinner guests & family rated this a "best".

Wish I could rate this recipe higher. It was sooo good. If you want raves and something special to serve your guests, you can't go wrong with this one. We had a little trouble finding the cookies, but you can get them at Williams and Sonoma. I'm sure I could have gotten them at the Italian Market, but didn't have time to drive that far.
