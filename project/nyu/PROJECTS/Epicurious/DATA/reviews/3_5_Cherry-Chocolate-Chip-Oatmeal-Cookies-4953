Delicious cookies... although I tend to agree they are a little too sweet, even though I used less chocolate chips. Next time I will cut the sugar down and try substituting some applesauce and flax seed. I think with a little alteration they will be a new Favorite! A BIG hit with my co-workers, just as they are though!

Wow are these ever some flavorful cookies! They really are gems, but I'm inclined to think that the recipe is one or two ingredients too close to throwing in the kitchen sink. In other words, there's almost too much going on in texture and flavor, and the balance is lost. The next time I make these (and there certainly will be a next time), I'm omitting the dried cherries. The oats, chocolate and toasted almost carry so much yumminess on their own - the cherries step in and try to claim all the attention, and not with perfect results. Overall, however, these are stellar cookies - certainly worthy of the calories! :)

In spite of my not picking up the correct (dark brown) sugar with the rest of the ingredients and not toasting the slivered almonds, these turned out great! A pretty substantial and grown up cookie as others have noted. Several friends asked me for the recipe as they disappeared at a party.

Love this recipe! I cut the sugar down a 1/4, add a little flax and some cinnamon. I just change the almonds or cranberries when someone I am baking for does not like them. Everyone always raves about these cookies!

everyone loves these cookies. i substitute macadamia nuts and cranraisins.

I definitely liked the presence of the late-added dry oats to the dough, but my main impression of this was that the flavor of the dried cherries overwhelmed the chocolate chips. I think I'd try this again without the cherries -or- without the chocolate chips. But as written, it's an interesting (and still tasty) miss.

On second tasting/after several hours, the cookies somehow tasted less sweet. I had to stop myself from eating too many, and they went extremely fast. Would not change anything

I loved the flavor combo and crunchy/chewy textures, but it was too sweet. I will try again, but next time I will cut down on the chocolate chips to 1 cup, or use bittersweet.

This is a solid base cookie dough and lends itself to adaptation with ease. I omit the almond extract and use additional vanilla. Without any molasses or spices- it is essentially a basic chocolate chip cookie base. Works for me, but may not satiate anyone who is looking for a classic oatmeal cookie.

I made the following changes to this recipe and the cookies were delicious: 3/4 cup dark brown sugar and 1/4 cup white reg sugar; 1.5 teaspoons vanilla and no almond extract; no slivered almonds; yellow sultana raisins instead of dried cherries; bittersweet Ghirardelli chocolate chips instead of semi- sweet. The cookies were very good.

Rating: 0
just a note to all the peeps who think the cookies are too sweet and want to cut down on the sugar- keep in mind this can really throw the balance of a recipe off, changing the texture, browning, spread, etc of the cookie!! Try upping the salt to tame the sweetness.

Wonderful cookies. I cut the amount of chocolate chips in half and added the equivalent amount of golden raisins. Didn't have almond extract so substituted with bit of Amaretto. Sprinkled shredded coconut on top - fantastic.

Rating: 3
These cookies spread quite a bit and were very sweet. I used the 3/4 brown sugar to 1/4 cup white, as suggested. If I try them again I would cut down on sugar and add a little more oatmeal. They were a little too "lacey" for my taste!

What a fantastic cookie! The only change I made was to add chopped up walnuts instead of the almonds and they turned out perfectly. This may very well become a new favorite!

I think these were great! I should have listened to the other reviews because I really could have cut back on the sugars, they were sweet. I subst. cranb-orange craisins-what I had on hand and used a chopped up large dark chocolate bar-also all I had. Then after mixing the batter remembered I had some yogurt covered cherries and wasn't sure how they'd bake in a cookie so I mixed some up into just enough batter for 6 cookies,(another reason to cut back on the sugar) baked them and was surprised they worked fine-didn't run like I thought they might. Didn't have almonds, but had pecans. Oh,I forgot, added some rum-soaked raisins(mmmmmmmmmm). So I guess I changed the whole recipe-sorry-I do that a lot!(no wonder they were so good)What made them REALLY great? An ice cold glass of milk!

These cookies are delicious. I added extra chocolate chips (always a good idea) and extra cherries (not so good - some of the cookies crumbled). I ditched the slivered almonds - it seemed to make them too complicated. I also substituted 1/2 cup of almond flour for 1/2 cup of regular flour. It sounded like an interesting idea, but the almond flour was really expensive. In any case, the cookies turned out FABULOUS. I will definitely make them again and again and again...

Rating: 4
I bake a lot of cookies, and this recipe is one of my favorites. The minor changes I've made (after making this recipe many times):using 3/4 dark brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar - keeps the cookies chewy! - and cutting down on the baking time to about 10 min total. Take the cookies out when they still look a little wet in the center and let them sit on the baking sheet for a minute or two - they will continue to bake in their own heat. This keeps the cookies from getting too crumbly after they've cooled.

Wonderful cookies, just a little heavy on the chocolate chips - would only use one cup next time.

Wonderful. Used as Christmas gifts and got great reviews. I doubled the recipe, but kept the cherries and chocolate chips at the original amounts. It seemed to be perfect. But I doubled the toasted almonds... I love almonds! I'm making them again tonight.

Rating: 4
Sooooo Good! These have become my favorite cookie recipe of all time. They are flat, but crispy at the edges and chewy in the middle....perfect. Made a few changes: I used all light brown sugar and no white sugar, cut the butter down a bit to 1/2 cup (the first time I made them they spread a little too much). But the best change is that I replaced half of the flour with Almond Meal from Trader Joe's. Almond meal is just pure ground up almonds. Because of this I omitted the almond pieces. I also used only about 1 cup of chocolate chips which is plenty (and I'm a chocoholic!) Everyone has raved!

These were quite yummy. I used cherry flavored Craisins, since they were cheaper than the dried cherries.

Very Yummy Recipe

This cookie turned out great! I used dried cranberries instead of cherries because it's what I had on hand. Next time I'll try cherries because I think they'll be wonderful. In the last minute before baking I beat in about another 2-3 tablespoons of oats because the batter looked a little loose and I didn't want the cookies to flatten out. In my oven I baked them for 10 minutes, then rotated the pans and baked for about another 6-7 minutes. The cookies still came out chewy, which is what I wanted. My husband will be very popular when he brings these to work and I can see them making a repeat appearance during the holidays as part of gift baskets.

Not terribly exciting. I used Montmorency cherries from Trader Joe and think golden raisins would have been better. The almonds just disappeared, not as good as walnuts would have been. I like the Toll House Cookie recipe on the chip bag much better.

Rating: 4
This is my new favorite cookie -- and my friends' new favorite. What a great combination of tastes. I like a softer cookie, so I use all brown sugar instead of brown and regular sugar. The brown sugar also keeps the cookies extra moist.

Rating: 3
I have whipped these up several times and they are very tasty. The chewiness of the oats, the crunch from the almonds as well the contrast of the tart dried cherries and the chocolate makes for a satisfying combination of flavors and textures. It sounds like a lot of different ingredients but they work really well together. I find that if you bake them as long as the recipe suggests, they become a bit hard so I reduce the baking time by at least 2 minutes.

Rating: 4
Excellent. left out the almonds though. soft and chewy even the next day. extremely popular with the group.

I just found my 2006 Christmas gift cookie!! I only used 1 cup of milk chocolate chips and added 3/4c sweetened shredded coconut. I also baked for only 10 min then did the rotate and switch - and baked about 5 1/2 mins more. To dress these up for gifts - I'll half dip into alternating white and milk chocolate. My cookies were not "lacey" like some reported but they did spread to about 4 inches.

Rating: 3
I added 1 cup of unsweetened coconut flakes and cut the chocolate chips to 1 cup, left everything else the same. Mine were golden lacey and delicious. I would not leave out the almond extract as it adds a note of piquant mystery! I know that adults, and aging rottweilers go for these delicious cookies! Unsweetened coconut is available in several forms at natural foods stores. Costco has wonderful dried cherries in large bags. Try them in oatmeal for breakfast.

Rating: 3
Good but not great. I agree that there was a lot going on in these cookies. Mine turned out crisp, and I like a soft cookie a little better. Certainly good, however, and I'll probably make them again because the cherries are indeed a nice touch.

Rating: 4
we live in a village that doesn't offer high end grocery stores, so substitutions are a must. i frequently use dried cranberries (which keep well in the freezer) and macadamia nuts (which are easy to come by) in this recipe. it's been a staple in our home for a couple of years. forming the dough into balls and chilling them completely in the fridge (or freezer) works well to make soft, delicious cookies.

Rating: 1
Texture and appearance perfect, taste left a something to be desired. I love all of the ingredients---chocolate, tart cherries, almonds, oats---but, as strange as this sounds, this didn't taste like a cookie. No buttery depth or vanilla richness typically found in your everyday homemade cookie, whether oatmeal, choc chip, sugar or peanut butter. You might say that's what makes this one unique, but I can get the same flavors from a cherry-chocolate chip-almond trail mix (with lots less sugar). Does anyone have an oatmeal-cherry-chocolate cookie recipe you favor over this one?

Great cookies. Made them for Fourth of July and not one left. Followed recipe exactly. They were chewy and full of flavor. Yum!

An excellent and hearty cookie. I've made it a number of times and get requests for it from many. Some people have claimed it's now their favorite cookie - and even one of my personal favorites! (Note: I bulk up the cherries a bit and add a bit more chocolate chips to make the cookie even more dense with good-bits.)

Rating: 3
Great cookie! I agree with a previous reveiwer that there are too many flavors, so omitted the chocolate. I used the cherries and toasted pecans (increased to 1 cup) and these were wonderfully buttery and the cherries were a nice complement. Definitely would have been gilding the lilly to add chocolate. Nice chewy texture. Was out of parchment but did well with an ungreased cookie sheet after cooling completely. Will definitely make again.

These came out great - the tart cherries make an excellent companion to the sweet chocolate. I left out the slivered almonds, but did include the almond extract. Yum!

I have to say I agree with the reviewer from Falls Church, VA. I love all the ingredients in this cookie individually, but all mixed together they lose their special qualities. There's just too much going on in this cookie to appreciate any one flavor. Based on the reviews, this seems like one you either love or hate.

My boyfriend thought he died and went straight to heaven! The problem was he wanted them again and I coupldn't find the receipe! Thank goodness for this web page! Last time I couldn't find the cherries and did them with cranberries. They were good but I am looking forward to trying the cherries. Trader Joe's is a GREAT source for finding things.

Good cookies, but I'm not sure what all the fuss is about -- they're not the best cookie ever. They're basically chocolate chip cookies with some extra stuff thrown in. The cookies were nice and crispy from the oatmeal. I used chocolate chunks, which I thought worked well with the almonds and large cherries.

This is a very dangerous recipe! I use mini-chocolate chips (I tried white chocolate, but like the semi-sweet best). I've sent them to my niece and nephews who are in college.

Hooray! These are delicious cookies. They have a very interesting taste, but at the same time, all of the different flavors meld nicely. Definately cut the dried cherries in half. Next time I will only bake these for 10 minutes, as I prefer a softer cookie.

These have become my families favorite cookie. I came across this recipe on this website 2 years ago and have been making them ever since. Everytime I make these I get rave reviews and they dissappear before everything else. Everyone always asks for the recipe. The combination of ingredients, textures and flavors really works and the recipe lends itself easily to substitutions. Although, I haven't been able to bring myself to do it except for the additon of 1 cup of coconut. The coconut makes them extra chewey and moist. I am a bit confused with the comments that the cookies turned out lacey and/or thin. My dough is quite stiff and the cookies turn out very substantial and chewey. I use a medium cookie scoop and then slightly flatten with my hand. I only bake them for 12 minutes. I purchase the "tart cherries" at Trader Joes and recently saw that they carry toasted slivered almonds as well. I also snip the cherries in half. I love to make these because they are so quick and easy and taste absolutely divine!

Rating: 3
Count me into the fan club for these cookies! The chocolate and cherries make for such a delicious flavor combination. Next time I will chop the cherries into smaller bits since I had one or two cookies with funky shapes, due to a large cherry poking out here and there! No harm done, I simply ate those! Don't skip the almond extract because it absolutely enhances the "cherry-ness" of the cherries. Mine also came out a bit on the crisp side, but I froze them and expect they'll soften when thawed (most crisp cookies usually do soften after they've been frozen). I yielded 3 dozen on my batch.

They were fanastic -- decadent and delicious.

perfect cookie....try these substitutions for an energy lift worthy for a long winter's day of playing in the snow! Increase flour to 1 1/2 C.Use only 1/2 C of golden brown sugar then add 1/2 C smooth peanut butter and 1/2 C chopped Snickers bars to the list of existing ingredients.I also used chocolate extract instead of vanilla for an extra boost of flavor.

On the basis of the rave reviews here, I baked these with great anticipation. Have to say they were a big disappointment. They tasted a little better the next day but overall, considering the yummy ingredients, they were truly underwhelming. Perhaps it's better to stick to a straight choc chip cookie, or straight oatmeal, but the choc chip-cherry-oatmeal-almond thing was somewhere between blah and odd. Didn't pass the taste taste of my easy-to-please 4 year old, either, who called them "weird." I'm sorry I wasted 2 cups of good cherries on a double batch. If anyone has a great cookie recipe that uses sour dried cherries, I'd love to hear about it!

Just made these a couple nights ago. I haven't had a lot of success with cookies in the past but these were fantastic. The recipe makes too few, in my opinion, so next time I'll double it. I love the flavor combo of cherries and choclate and this is just the ticket. I bet it would be good with chocolate chunks instead of chips...

Everytime I make these cookies people go CRAZY. It sounds like cranberries work but if you can get the cherries they are really something special. I'm not a nut fan so I leave those out, but still find the cookies can be TOO chunky--I reduce the choc. chips a bit so there is enough batter to cover. I think they'd be great a few days old but they never survive that long! Real classics.
