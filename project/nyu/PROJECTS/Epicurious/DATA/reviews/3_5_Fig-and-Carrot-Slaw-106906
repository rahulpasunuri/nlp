I followed the recipe exactly. I really wanted to like it, but found it really lacking in flavour. I threw out the leftovers.

Even better on the second day. I used a 10 oz bag of organic carrot shreds and the whole recipe of dressing, plus 1T of EVOO. So fast, so easy, so good.

It is of entertaining quality. I did add 1 tbsp Barnea olive oil, as somebody suggested. Will definitely make it again.

Much better than the average carrot slaw. I shredded the carrots in a food processor and substituted jumbo raisins for the figs (misread the recipe) but garnished with the fresh figs I'd bought by mistake. Really delicious.
