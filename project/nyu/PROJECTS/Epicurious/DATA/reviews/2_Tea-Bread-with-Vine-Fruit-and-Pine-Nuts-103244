I was also very excited about this bread, and even waited a day as the recipe suggests to let the flavors develop. It's really just not a very good bread. The consistency reminds me of a bit of a steamed pudding, except it's gummy and wet instead of moist and dense. Most disappointing was the 1 1/4 cup pine nuts, which are favorites of mine. I lightly toasted them, but cooked in the bread the absorbed liquid and were swollen and mealy. We tossed it without eating after one taste.

I was really excited when I read the description of this bread, but thoroughly disappointed with the result. The batter seemed way too thin and the fruit and nuts all sunk to the bottom! Did I do something wrong???

Easy to make - definitely better toasted as the recipe suggests. I couldn't find currants at my market so I substituted dried cranberries. If I made this bread a second time I might try chopping the pine nuts - left whole they seemed to over-power the dish.

Served this bread to 30 seniors in fitness classes. All enjoyed it and felt they were eating something healthy. Many have asked for the recipe.
