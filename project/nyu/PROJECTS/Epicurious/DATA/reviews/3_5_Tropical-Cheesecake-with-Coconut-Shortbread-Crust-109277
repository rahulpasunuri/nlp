I thought this cheesecake was delicious. I made it with the fromage blanc and the texture was smooth and lighter than it would be with the ricotta. I found that the recipe for the cookies made much more than was needed if you make a thin crust. Next time I'd probably make half that recipe. I made a mango puree for drizzling on the plates and a bit for the top of each slice and garnished the cake with other tropical fruits. Easy to make and everyone liked it.

I'm very sorry to say that this is the most bland cheesecake that I have ever tasted. While the texture is very nice and the topping lovely, the TASTE is simply not there. Actually, the fat and calories are not worth the flavor of this one.

exceptional - I'm a chef, I made it for chefs, the consensus was "perfect" (and I'm not typically a cheesecake fan). Ricotta worked but the fromage blanc, if you can get it would make for something quite special. Make this.

I baked the regular recipe & a lightened version (used Neufchatel cheese, nonfat Ricotta, Splenda, & 2 eggs/the rest egg whites to cut down on fat & cholesterol). The former was good, but the lightened version was a delectable, light-tasting coconut cheesecake. I also added coconut oil from Baker's Catalogue. This is a keeper.

This is an outstanding cheesecake with a wonderful,creamy texture. The presentation is beautiful. The homemade cookie crust sounds lovely, but to save time I substituted packaged coconut cookies - I ground 30 in my processor, mixed in 3 Tb. melted butter and then baked as in the recipe.

I made this cheesecake for dessert at our family Easter gathering. It was a big hit. Everyone love the presentation with the coconut and tropical fruits - very Eastery and Springy. The cocnut-shortbread crust really set it apart from a regular cheescake. I did consider adding another egg as it always seems that desserts reliant upon eggs for structure are never quite set (I always use extra-large eggs -- I guess professional chef's eggs are just bigger then mine!). Mine was slightly soft/mushy/runny in the center. Could've used another 10 minutes of baking perhaps, but I had already gone over the cooking time by 10 minutes. My oven could be sub-par. So, either have an excellent oven, add an extra egg, or cook 10-20 minutes longer then stated. This is a slightly time-consuming cake as you have to make/bake the cookies and then grind those cookies to make the crust, but the crust really makes it. And, things can be done way ahead of time.
