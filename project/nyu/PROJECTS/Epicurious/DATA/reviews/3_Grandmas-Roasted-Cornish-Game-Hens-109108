Really good. didn't have OJ so I used pineapple juice ... great. You owe it to yourself to give it a try

Really bland--nothing special. I have a pressure cooker recipe that is done in less time and is much more flavorful. Will not make again.

This was okay. Nothing special. It was easy enough and the cooking times and temp were spot on. Will try something else next time I make cornish hens, though.

This is my go-to recipe for Cornish Game Hens! Yet this is the first time I've remembered to write a comment. In the past I've varied the amount of marinating time, and I've used ground ginger instead of the real deal. My opinion, stick with the real deal! Tonight I'm going to try it with a split chicken to see how it turns out. If it works, I'll post the results!

My partner enjoyed it more than I did. I enjoy a salty, crispy skin and by putting the pan juices over the hens at the end, eliminates this pleasure for me. Don't get me wrong, it was quite delicious, but I enjoy crispy skin.

I have made these hens twice now, once for a dinner party of 6 and one for 4 people. Everyone enjoyed them very much. They are super tasty and moist.

I liked this dish. Nice subtle taste (wife and TWO kids ate it ALL UP!). The only change i made was after Marinating I sprayed cooking oil and broiled for 3 minutes to seal in juices.

I would actually give this a 2.5. It was good but the marinade ingredients really didn't didn't absorb into the game hens. I did mine on convection and they were beautifully browned and moist. Good for a weeknight but not company worthy.

This was pretty good, although not tasty enough to make again. I actually took the marinating bags with me in a cooler for dinner while camping. We skewered the hens and created a rotisserie over the campfire. Maybe the tip of roasting the hens with onions would make it more flavorful.

Used whole chicken cut into quarters, then grilled on the BBQ, moist and flavourful will make again.

Very moist and tasty! I added long sprigs of sage from my herb garden to the bed of onions. I also brined the birds (as I do most poultry) before marinating: 3/4 cup each Kosher salt and brown sugar & water to cover. Brine in ziplock bag for 90 minutes. We had this on Easter Day 2004. Next Year in DeSoto!

Wow, this was excellent. My only substitution was rice wine vinegar because I had run out of white wine vinegar. The marinade is delicious and I will be using it for many other dishes. Very easy to make, beautifully browned. The leftovers tasted great the next day also.

These were just ok. The marinade is nice. I followed one reviewers advice and added onions to the bottom of the roasting pan. Still, I thought the flavor was bland. I would make a roast chicken next time.

Fabulous, and so easy! This would work with any kind of poultry, not just Cornish Hens -- it basically poaches in the marinade, but also gets perfectly browned and crispy and sweet and sour all at the same time. Regular old chicken parts? Done. This marinade/sauce is a keeper. (Add garlic to taste perhaps? up to you)

Delish! Also extremely easy to prepare.

Very good basic recipe! Definitely add something to it to give it a bit extra zing. I roasted the hens on a bed of sliced onions, then I reduced the juices with sherry to make gravy. It was a hit with rice and steamed veggies. And very very easy to make!

I was somewhat hesitant about this recipe thinking it might be boring... Was I wrong! It was excellent! I served it with honey ginger glazed carrots (using only 1/2 tsp of ginger), wild rice and whole wheat honey rolls. What a hit! Very, very flavourful and mosit. My husband has already claimed the leftovers! I will definitely make it again and again.
