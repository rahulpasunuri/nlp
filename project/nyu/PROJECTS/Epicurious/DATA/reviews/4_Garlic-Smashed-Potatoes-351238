These are incredible - such an easy dish and just sooo good! Doubled the recipe and made awesome fried potatoes the next morning.

One fork might seem harsh, but the definition of one fork is "okay," and my family thought these were just okay. They also said that, since we have so many other good potato recipes, that I NOT make this again. There was nothing wrong with it, but there was nothing special about it either.

Loved it, so simple, and yet it looks good too, am taking it to a party tonight. Did have to cook the potatoes somewhat longer than it said, but I often find that is necessary.

Did anyone else that made this have a hard time getting the potatoes tender? I would have given this four stars, but it took about 30 minutes to cook the potatoes. Anyway, it was definitely light and creamy and everyone enjoyed it.

The potatoes have a great combination of crispy outside and super creamy inside (probably from all the butter!). I didn't think they really needed the sour cream, but I'm not one to turn it down.

This is a great 'do-ahead' side dish. Then 10 minutes before dinner was served popped the pan under the broiler. The potato skins were crisp. I used a small sized disher to scoop out the sour cream. I reduced the butter, olive oil and used light sour cream. It was delicious.

This was delicious! I didn't use the sour cream either -- but that's because I forgot it!

Simple and delicious and I didn't think this was too heavy at all. Then again, I used light sour cream and allowed each guest to dollop their own amount of sour cream onto their own desired serving of potatoes.

Excellent. Didn't use the sour cream, so this wasn't heavy and we got to experience the soft texture and great flavour of potatoes cooked this way. Will definitely make this again.

This dish was extremely heavy. Eliminating the butter and/or the sour cream might help. Why would you "round out the meal with potaotes..." if you are serving this dish of potatoes already?
