This was good, but not great. The dough was easy to work with and the cookies baked up just fine. I think the lemon icing was just a bit too much for me.

These are lovely and are very easy and quick to make. I used a 2" cookie cutter and only came up with 15 cookies, though.

I made this for the 30 cookie-conoisseurs in my workplace (lab). Nothing but raves. Also pretty easy to make, though I didn't bother to roll it out and I added extra lemon and nutmeg.

Loved this cookie. Delicate, aromatic and wonderful flavor. As one of my friends said, "this is one powerful cookie!" Perfect.

I made these cookies for Easter and the response was phoenominal. Several people asked for the recipe. These will definately stay on my favorites list.

This is a great light not to sweet cookie. Very tender. I chilled the dough for 15 minutes before baking. I used fresh lemon juice and I didn't use any nutmeg. Also I didn't frost them. Either way they are a great simple cookie. I served them with ice cream after a braised lamb shank with red wine & rosemary dinner.

How any one can get these cookies to roll out is beyond me. I ended up fighting with the waxed paper tossing it out and hand rolling the dough into balls then pressing them into small disks. Despite the rolling out fiasco they tasted wonderful with vanilla ice cream and orange segments as suggested and got rave reviews from guests.
