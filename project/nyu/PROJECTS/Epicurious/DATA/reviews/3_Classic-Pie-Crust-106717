Best pie crust recipie I have found. The secret is to SKIP the food processor. Just blend the shortening with a fork. Thsi is pie crust, folks! Machines are an abomination--save your food processor for another time. I get perfect crust every time just by going the old-fashioned route.

I thought I would try this recipe just for the fun of it, when I made the Bada Bing cherry pie recipe. However, I was very disappointed. It did not hold together at all when I rolled it out. I should have made another crust instead of trying to use this one, but I did not have the time to start over. I will go back to my old tried and true recipe.

I am not reviewing this recipe - just warning folks that the shortening called for in this recipe is a killer (hydrogenated oil, or trans fat). I encourage everyone to switch to all butter pie crusts! They are harder to work with but if you chill the dough for at least an hour and then roll out quickly, you'll be fine.

I am qualifying this as my crust recipe is similar and that's what I made. So, that said, the changes are, 2/3 cup of shortening, not 3/4 cup, a teaspoon of sugar in crust and a 1/2 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar added to ice water. I don't use a food processor for pie crust as judging the fat particle size and the moisture content is too hard. The old fashioned way works best for me. The key to the crust is to mix in enough water to form a ball. This means that there will be some dry crumbs that you will stick to the ball. If the crust is too moist, it will be tough, not flaky. I live in a dry climate and often add more water than is called for, but if your area is humid, the opposite would apply.

Had no problem making the crust, used ice cold water, it looked in the food processor like the recipe suggested. But it completely disentegrated when I tried to roll it out. Terrible texture, the dogs weren't even interested in the remnants. Fat chance I'll use this pie crust recipe again.

I had enormous difficulty with this crust. It came out of the food processor looking great, it was nice and firm when I took it out of the refrigerator to roll it, but the recipe's warning about "dough can become sticky" is quite an understatement. I've never had pie dough disintegrate on me quite like this did (and I've made plenty of pies). The taste is good, but I had so much difficulty getting it rolled out and put in the pan that I won't make it again.

This is a lovely pie crust. My husband was impressed with the taste. I made a beef pot pie. Only thing was it was difficult to take the wedges out of the pan without the pastry crumbling all over but this had no effect on the quality of the pie.

The four to five tablespoons of water weren't nearly enough for my crust! It ended up so dry and crumbly I could hardly roll it out. Not sure if I went wrong somewhere since the other reviewers liked it so much. I don't intend to give it another try as there are so many other good crust recipes out there.

I have always found pie crust difficult to make, but this recipe was GREAT -- easy and delicious. I ended up using butter flavored shortening to add some extra flavor. And, at the end of it all, I amazed myself and made a pie that was edible. Wow!
