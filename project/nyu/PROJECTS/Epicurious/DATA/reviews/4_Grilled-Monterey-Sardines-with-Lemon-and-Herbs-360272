This is an excellent and easy recipe! I would double up on the herb mixture as well as the onion/olive mixture, as these great toppings add an extra fresh zing to the sardines. Made fresh garlic bread with baguette halves and served with Arugula salad and home grown tomatoes...delicious! Scoop the sardines onto the toast, and don't forget a squeeze of fresh lemon. Divine!

I used 6 fat sardines for two people and almost all the herb and olive/onion mixture. Do grill them outside as they are smelly. They only take a few minutes.

I used fresh sardines and it was fabulous! We both were raving and to tell the truth, I didn't think it would be that great but the citrus, the coriander and the onion all worked wonderfully! If you have some fresh sardines, please do this recipe. You won't be sorry.

I used the sardine shortcut since all I had in my pantry were canned sardines. I loved the combination of flavors from the slight citrus to the fresh cilantro. This is a great recipe for those who are trying to increase protein in their diets and love sardines but want to be wowed by the dish instead of just eating a plain sardine. I adjusted the amount of the ingredients to go with one can of sardines. I made a sandwich out of the sardine puree...it wasn't watery so it still had texture. It was delicious!
