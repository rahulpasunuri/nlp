Best tart we ever had. Better than the ones in Paris. Worth the two day endeavor. We made two minor changes: left out the almond extract and grilled the pineapple and mango. The crust seemed thin before the first refrigeration but it baked perfect.

I made this recipe and it was sublime and guest couldn't stop raving about it. I had no problem with it being runny but always use grade AA eggs which may make a difference.

The crust is nice, but you could not taste the macadamias, only the almond extract. Good recipe, that could be made with another nut. The rest of the tart was just OK. I made with pineapple, but would make with mango entirely if I made again. Very difficult to slice and present with pineapple.

The tart as a whole wasn't great. But the mac nut crust is amazing. I have since used it as the crust for several tarts that are always very well received by guests. Thanks!

I enjoyed this tart as did my guests. Added 1/4 tsp more of the cornstarch and brought the custard to almost a boil (just take it off the heat immediately and whisk till smooth) and I practically had to spread it into the crust with a spatula. Used only mango which has a lot less juice than the pineapple. Would substitute almonds, cashews or pecans for macadamias; with the almond extract and all the other flavors you could not appreciate that they were macadamias. I will make this again.

I made this dessert for a family reunion and it was a huge success. I chilled the custard for 6 hours so I had no problems with it being runny.

I've made this excellent tart twice now--and received rave reviews both times. I patted the mango and pineapple slices dry on paper towels before I put them on the tart, and I didn't have a problem with anything being too runny. The custard filling is nice and thick--the vanilla-rum flavor was delicious.

The flavors of this were delicious...but beware that it can get very runny....mine did. I had to serve it in bowls. The juices from the pineapple and mango ran right into the filling. Next time I will cut the fruits the day before and let them drain overnight and pat dry before arranging them on the top.

This dessert is wonderful. I made it for a dinner party and it got rave reviews. My custard was a little runny, so it was very messy to serve. Otherwise, I would certainly make it again.
