I used 3 leeks, and 2 peeled potatoes, braising them in the liquid, which was 1.5 cups of pasta water left over from supper. I then poured the result into a food processor and ran it till it was smooth. I added enough chicken broth to get the consistency I prefer. I used 4 tsp. chopped parsley and marjoram, and finally ground both pepper and salt to taste into the mixture. I reheated it all to 140 degrees. Then I poured in a little half and half rather than butter. It is still basically the same recipe but without the lumps of potato and fewer calories.

Excellent, simple recipe.I made several changes. I doubled the recipe, and added 3 cloves of minced garlic. I roasted the sliced leeks in a frypan in a bit of olive oil in the oven, 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, and added the garlic with 5 minutes to go, then removed and covered the pan while I used the potato ricer on the Cuisinart, then added hot chicken stock to the potatoes and the normal blade to puree. Separately added 1/2 c stock and pureed leeks and garlic with a few pulses. I tbsp butter and some salt was more than enough. Sperlonga croutons were made while doing this in the still hot(375) oven, about 10 minutes...Yummy, even our 8 year old!

I can appreciate the simplicity of the recipe and it was good on its own but it tasted like it was missing something to me. I didn`t add any additional seasonings but I did add some left over roast beef which made it spectacular.

I made this tonight with some substitutions, like shallots for leeks (can't find them here in Tokyo), added Japanese taro (sato imo, which is kind of slimy for a root vegetable) and I added two cloves of roasted elephant garlic. I blended some of the potato soup, the garlic, taro, parsley, and garlic, and added it back to the soup to thicken it. Oh, and I added lemon juice for brightness. Still, it needs something else, like sausage, but maybe I'm just too much of a carnivore.

As is, this recipe is disappointingly bland, but with a few additions I ended up with a really tasty soup. I added 1/2 cup of chopped carrots and six cloves of smashed garlic with the potatoes (next time will brown the carrots a bit first), and subbed more chicken stock for the water. I also roasted six cloves of garlic and pureed them with the finished soup (I lightly pureed the whole batch). Next time I might use a 1/2 cup of cream, as well.

I add brocolli to this, and use some whipping cream in place of the water and it's delicious. Throw it in a food processor to make it smooth and creamy.

This was very tasty. I took into account all the comments about more chicken broth than water. So what I did was use one can chicken broth, and the rest I used leek stock (which is basically boiling the dark green parts of the leek that is removed with water). The soup came out great!

As is, the soup was good, but not great, hence the 2 forks. My very very simple adaptations: use 4 cups broth and no water, lots of extra salt, and serve with a dollop of whole milk greek yogurt. Excellent with these modifications!

Made more flavor able by adding chopped carrots to the leek mixture and using all broth instead of the water. Also added thyme then pureed the entire vegi/broth mixture for a smooth soup-- added 1/2 c half and half and a little milk, finished it off with parsley and just a bit of shredded cheese served at the table... yes it is no longer a lite soup, but it sure tastes better.

A very basic result. Certainly filling. But very much like a wet, chunky mashed potatoes. In its favor, I did eat it. It needs thyme leaves I think. Or slices of spice sausage. Or something else... not sure what. My quest for leek and potato soup continues...

Don't know how the original recipe tastes, but loved the changes recommended by others. Use all broth with a bit of white wine and finish it with some half and half. Also added fresh rosemary, dill and the ground mustard recommended by another reviewer. Very scrumptuous!

Very delicious soup and very much like the soup I've been trying to recreate from a local market, Metropolitan Market. Only changes that I've made are to use more broth than water and then I blend all of the soup, rather than the 1 cup that the recipe recommends. Next time I might try adding a little cream, I'll let you know how it turns out.

Rating: 3
I took the advice of some of the other reviewers, and cooked up a few strips of bacon first. Used the bacon fat to cook the leeks, plus onion, shallots and garlic until softened. Then I added the broth and wine (no water) until the potatoes were soft enough to blend with my immersion blender. I added more broth as needed since it was super thick at that point. Salt and pepper to taste. Used the bacon to crumble on top when serving, along with some grated cheese. So delicious!! I think I would also add a dollop of sour cream next time.

So easy to make. Will definitely make this recipe again.

This is indeed a good base. I used all organic and local ingredients and ended up with a soup that was fine but not particularly impressive. Fortunately I made the soup in the morning for a party in the evening. After tasting the results, I went ahead and sauteed some chopped shallots in olive oil with a dash of mustard powder and cayenne pepper. I added about a cup of chicken broth, let it simmer, pureed it and added it to the soup. After letting the ingredients mingle on the stove top before serving it turned out quite tasty.

The soup-loving family devoured this dish. Of course, I multiplied the recipe for 8 servings.

Nice recipe and thanks for all the good ideas for additions. Here's another: I made mine with my own broth which I make without salt. I used the tip of softening the leeks in bacon fat, then toward the end seasoned the soup with smoked sea salt which added a nice extra bit of mellow smoky flavor along with the right amount of saltiness. Yum!

Rating: 0
A good basic recipe to start with. Like Cook from Boston, I fried bacon to crisp, then sauted leeks and garlic in the bacon fat and butter. Added a bit of fennel but removed it when leeks were soft; added potatoes, only broth (no water), and some lemon salt/pepper. When the soup was finished, I topped it with the bacon bits and shredded cheddar. There was nothing leftover!

I followed the advice of others and used all broth, wine, and added garlic and onions, but it was still missing an intricacy of taste. So my solution was to add some lemon zest and lemon thyme. Also, added a pinch of cayenne and ginger

This simple soup is surprisingly delicious. I read the reviews about adding garlic, wine, etc - but I always like to make a recipe as written the first time before tweaking, and I am glad I did. If you use FRESH, ORGANIC, LOCAL produce (or do the best that you can!), and organic European style butter (I love Strauss from CA or Kerrygold from Ireland), the ingredients all shine.

This was just ok... then I read what everyone wrote. I added the galic, onion and the bacon. So much better. My husband loved it when it was fixed.

Rating: 0
I added garlic as others had suggested but felt it took away from the flavor of the leeks. I did sub some white wine for the water (1/2 c.) and liked that flavor. I ended up pureeing the entire soup and adding about 1/2 cream at the end. It was very close to the basic potato-leek soup I was looking for.

Rating: 3
great and easy soup. Like the others, I added garlic and white wine, which was a good move. also, used only 1 cup of water, and added bacon, sourdough croutons and fresh dill in addition to the parsley. I decided to blend the entire soup instead of just a cup and it was a great consistency.

Rating: 4
I had leeks and potatoes from my CSA (community supported agriculture) share, and this simple soup really highlighted the freshness of the ingredients. That said, with less-than-stellar vegetables, it could have been a bit boring. I cooked a few strips of bacon in a cast-iron skillet, cooked the leeks in the rendered bacon fat, and deglazed the skillet with a bit of the stock prior to adding to the potatoes. Added some nice depth, especially with the bacon crumbled on top. The lack of cream also made it a good early-fall soup, rather than a heavy winter one.

Rating: 2
This is a good basic recipe. I added both additional onion and garlic while sauteing the leeks, and drizzled a little bit of black truffle oil right before serving and it was very tasty.

Very yummy and easy soup recipe. I modified it as other reviewers had suggested with added garlic and onions. I also added about a tsp of grated ginger and a chilli and lime spice mix. I cooked the potatoes first up in the microwave (2 large = 5mins) to save time ( I had to simmer everything together for about 5 minutes for the flavor to sink in, thats all).

I doubled the recipe and added 1/3 cup white wine and pureed with a hand blended about 1/2 way. It was absolutely delicious! I could taste a hint of wine which gave this simple and healthy soup and gourmet flair.

I liked this recipe. I used two potatoes and four leeks. I can see how it would be good with bacon, but it is a nice fresh soup. The parsley adds a refreshing splash to it. I like how you blend part of the soup instead of the entire amount. It thickens the soup nicely, but the rest is still substantial. Garlic would also enhance the flavor well. Great hearty soup for a cold day.

Rating: 1
This was not a recipe I cared for at all. What a waste of beautiful leeks. I would have perfered to pan sear them and eat them that way to try and sip this thick soup. My kids usually love potato leek soup, but I could not find my other recipe. I even tried to doctor it up and did not work.

Rating: 3
Would give it 3 1/2 but needed a bit of "doctoring." Thanks to those who recommended bacon and white wine. I cooked bacon first, cooked the leeks in some of the bacon fat (in lieu of butter) and added some chardonnay to the broth and water. Russet potatoes worked fine as well. Didn't care for the parsley topper as much. Chives might have worked better.

This recipe is delish! I pureed the whole thing and added a tiny bit more butter, and sauteed garlic cloves with the leeks as was previously suggested. I thought about adding cream and didn't--I think it's perfectly tasty without. I'll be making this again very soon!

Rating: 3
I used 1 1/2 c checken broth, 1/2 c white wine & 1/2 c cream, plus a garlic clove went in with the leeks. It was good, but not exceptional. I would do again & next time forego the cream as the soup was thick enough. I'd also cut down on the potato a bit. This didn't need blending if you wanted a rustic chunky soup, but it did make for a thicker soup.

This is my main soup recipe. When in doubt, I make this. So easy breazy, and friends are always impressed.

I always get asked for this recipe.

Prepared following the recipe, this soup is fine, but kind of bland, and too thick. With the addition of garlic, white wine, extra chicken broth, cream, and a finishing pat of butter, it was pretty good. Of course, there goes the low-fat thing . . . This soup would probably be best served alongside a tasty salad, since the soup itself isn't all that earth-shattering. (Is potato leek soup ever earth-shattering?)

I just finished making this soup, and thanks to previous suggestions, it is delicious. I made my own veg stock prior to making soup, used that as well as 1/2 cup white wine.

This is good comfort food, but the plain recipe light my fire. I added grated parmesan to the top and heating each bowl, which made it very good. If one doesn't like cheese, some chopped up fried bacon, would also do the trick. This is a good starting point and very simple.

Used 2 cups chicken stock and 1/2 cup water - and finished off with cream after blended - which really made a difference.

This was so wonderful! Im sick with a bad cold and wanted to eat something healthy but didnt have much energy to cook. This was really easy and quick and very soothing. My potatoes took only 12 minutes to cook because I cut them small. I added one extra cup of broth and 1 extra cup of water. I mixed half the soup into the blender (one cup at a time) instead of just one cup total. I mixed in a little bit of rice milk into our individual bowls to cool down the soup. Mmmmm, will definitively make this again!

This is a easy and straightforward version of this classic combination. I like that it spares the cream as it makes it easy to freeze, and personally, I didn't miss it. I added plenty of ground pepper, a bit of thyme and cayenne at the end to finish. Will definitely make again.

I wanted a basic leek and potato soup to make and when i saw had no garlic in the house, it had to be really basic. This one was perfect. The method is easy, ingredients are basic and the half puree, half chunky mix is really tasty on the buds! I made it exactly as is and it worked turned out well. Good for when your not feeling well and want something healthy since it has no cream. Also it made lots so i can freeze it for later. Thumbs up :)

Keep in mind that I altered the recipe. I added carrots with the potatoes, then sauteed mushrooms & artichoke hearts in butter w/garlic and added these at the very end. Also used all veggie stock, no water. Served w/homemade French bread. It was delicious (and so fast)! Will definitely make again.

First - this really DOES take 45 minutes or less. Second - despite simple ingredients, it tastes great, even if you use instant broth. Family added sour cream, salt and pepper to taste at table. It's not "beyond compare" as the 4 forks I gave suggests - but it is basically THE best potato and leek soup for the ingredients and time required, I'd bet. Unless you boil this dry or don't adequately wash the leeks (I rinsed in a strainer AFTER chopping, as well as washing the whole leeks before; dirt was in every cranny), I can't see how you'd ruin it. I didn't add extra water, though you may want to. It was thick. Oh, and this easily serves 4, perhaps 5 if no one wants seconds, as a first course.

Delicious! I needed to make soup for a relative who came for dinner last night, as that is all she is able to eat, and this was perfect, especially since she loves potato soup!

My boyfriend loves potato soup, so I tried this, but it definately needed help.
