Flavors were just so so. Made this for a tapa party, but it just was not that special.

Made this as part of a New Year's buffet brunch. Turned out beautiful. Had made it exactly as directed first time I tried it. For the brunch, baked the unpeeled potatoes in the microwave, then peeled and diced.(Would be a fine use for leftover baked potatoes.) Very good without the saffron too!

Like another reviewer, my omelet came out as hash. My mother-in-law liked it but I was really disappointed by the outcome. I don't know what I did wrong (and I made two of them). It seemed like there were too many potatoes and not enough eggs.

This is a great basic recipe with lots of room to improvise. A lot of friends have asked for the recipe and they now have their own custom versions. I cook the potatoes in vegetable stock to add to their flavour, add ground red chilies to the eggs and garnish the finished omelette with hot sauce and thin-sliced red peppers. People love this dish.

Maybe I had too much potato, but this was definitely not finger food. It tasted ok for breakfast the next day, but it really looked more like a hash than a tapas. Tried serving it with a Spanish Tio Pepe sherry, also a bad idea.

Delicious. Especially nice if you make ahead--then you can relax when dinner time (or dinner guests) roll around. It really is special tasting. I served this as part of a tapas buffet, originally. There were no leftovers.

This dish is a staple in my house. I always have potatoes and eggs available, so it's an easy last minute breakfast, lunch, or dinner. To my taste, it's just as good without the saffron. I don't usually use the scallions, but I throw in some chopped parsely for color.
