Does anyone really need a recipe to make this dish? Particularly in that a main component is store bought??? Like many of the recipes on this web site, it's not a recipe at all.

Easy(ish) to make, and very rewarding. As long as you can multitask cooking the sausage, pasta and preparing the seasoning, this shouldn't be a problem. Makes enough for three people, with leftovers for lunch.

This is a variation of one of the great, easy dishes that my roommates and I learned to make decades ago in our first apartment. Times have changed, but it's hard to beat this one for a quick, delicious dinner.
