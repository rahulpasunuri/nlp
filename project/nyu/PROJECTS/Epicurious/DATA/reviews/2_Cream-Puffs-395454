Do not make this recipe. The review does not allow me to enter a 0, which is what it deserves. I have made choux pastry many times and NEVER had this happen. The dough was batter.

I've made cream puffs a number of times, and had always considered them fairly foolproof. I should have just used one of my old recipes. These puffs do not puff. The previous reviewer found an error in the sugar measurements - wish I had read the review before I made these.

Please note that the amount of sugar should say "divided" next to it! I was hurriedly making the recipe for a Mother's Day celebration. I mistakenly put the entire amount of sugar into the dough. That's probably why the dough did not puff very high, and collapsed as soon as it was removed from the oven. My family happily ate them, despite the puff's mutant space alien appearance.
