I've made this twice. Based on my first time making it, the second time, I used only chicken broth and omitted the water (it was too watery for me with both the water and broth). Tripled the cumin and stirred it in at the end. I didn't like it with the lime, so omitted it the second time. And like other reviewers, I had to play around a little to get the flavor right. I added some brown sugar and bit of fish sauce, which added some depth.

easy, but bland as written. tasted it and added the grated cheddar as suggested, then about a teaspoon of crushed oregano, paprika and a few good shakes of tabasco. still not quite right, so poured my glass of chardonnay in. nice. even the kids liked it, but sure needed some work!

Easy and delicious soup. Cooked the cauliflower and broth in the slow cooker. The lime juice really adds to the flavour of the soup. Added some grated parmesan cheese.

A yummy, silky soup to warm up with on a chilly winter evening. I used chicken stock instead of the water, and served it without the cumin seed and lime for my 6-yr old who loved it! My husband and I quite enjoyed the cumin and lime combo. A great way to use up leftover cauliflower.

Simple and tasty! Even my sister's 18 year old friend who "only likes pasta with butter and salt" had seconds. I didn't have cuminseed on hand, so I just used cumin powder and it worked great.

Bland and not worth the effort.

Easy and great! Used ground cumin just like everyone else and added 1/3 cup cheddar. Husband loved it.

Wow, my husband and I loved this soup! I didn't have cumin seeds but used dried cumin (added at same time as lime juice) and added 1/4 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese prior to serving. Followed the rest of the recipe. This is the first epicurious recipe in a few weeks that my husband requested that I retain! Pureed the soup very smooth and it was a lot richer than I expected. Will definitely make this again, and most likely for dinner guests.

I used ground cumin and plenty of lime juice. I was surprised at the depth of flavor for a dish whose main ingredient is cauliflower! Very tasty, very warming, and with my hand blender, very easy.

Love this soup. Decided to keep the calories in check and omittted the half and half. It was terrific. this is easy and very tasty. I'll be sure to make it again.

We usually substitute some vegetable stock for the chicken stock, and I've taken to caramelizing the onions to give the soup a richer flavor. It's a favorite - we have this 4 or 5 times over the winter. Invariably we have guests asking for seconds - even kids. Not everyone likes the cumin seed (tho I do). I have offered some garlic croutons - and they seem to make a nice guarnish.

Another variation. Used the Thai broth from Wegmans and coconut milk instead of cream.

hp again. forgot to mention i added unroasted cumin with the onion when i sauteed onion which i usually do when making veggie soups like butternut squash. next time i'll try roasting the cumin to see if it adds to the recipe.

this soup was very good, like shannon, i used greek yogurt instead of cream. then sprinkled with some chopped cilantro as i have an aversion to all white food. i used all broth, no water. lovely texture.

Rating: 2
Very boring recipe when made as listed. Needed lots of extra cumin and lime. A generous cup of shredded pepper jack cheese gave it the punch it needed.

I doubled the recipe, substituted Greek yogurt for the cream and added an extra teaspoon of lime juice. This is velvety and very, very good.

After reading the reviews from this recipe, I expected to really love this recipe. Even with the increase in cumin and lime juice, my husband and I found the recipe a little too bland for our taste.

This was rich and delicious. Used all chicken broth and omitted the cream entirely. My husband loved it and we didn't miss the cream at all.

I would spice up this soup more with cumin. I thought that it was a bit bland but had promise.

Really great, fresh flavor. Goes really well as a part of a tex-mex meal. My changes: tripled recipe, olive oil instead of butter, one diced russet with Cauliflower for body, used all broth, very little milk. A pinch of cayenne. Everyone loved it!

Good. Really Good. I added lots and lots of lime juice and lots and lots of cumin. Simple and delicious. Used yogurt as others suggested, but with caution, as I found that just a little too much can over power the cauliflower. I revived it with lime and pepper. Really delicious.

Rating: 3
definitely delicious. I used extra cauliflower, no cream, and spooned some yogurt on top before sprinkling on the cumin at the end instead. this made it healthier, but still gave the soup some body. I thought the presentation was nicer this way as well.

Rating: 4
I loved this dish. Echoing other cooks, I, too, eliminated all but a tiny amount of cream in my serving bowl - I used the whole head of cauliflower and winged the amounts of onion, broth, cauliflower. Tripled the amount of cumin seed and threw it in the pot. I added chopped cilantro and a dollop of Trader Joes Mediterranean Cheese Style Yoghurt for a yummy acoutrement to my broiled trout.

This soup is marvelous. It sounds like a strange combination -- I was skeptical, but the reviews made me decide to make it. The lime brightens the flavor and the toasted cumin rounds it out. I tripled the recipe (had alot of cauliflower), using 1 large onion. I toasted ground cumin and mixed it in to the soup. What a pleasant surprise.

Rating: 4
The receipe I searched for! Subtle and fulfilling. Love the fact that it is set for 2-3 people, I'm hoping if I ever want to double it I get it right too. A definite keeper. I added a few sprinkles of shredded cheddar just for colour, it didn't need any help.

This soup was very good. I followed the recipe exactly with one BIG change, instead of half and half, I used 1/2 cup of coconut milk. It combined beautifully with the cumin and lime and there were fights for the last few spoonfuls.

We loved this soup! We also substituted evaporated milk for the half and half. We loved the cumin and lime juice flavors and will definitely make this again.

Delicious. I added a pinch of saffron for a beautiful yellow color, and added zucchini as another review suggested. I used evaporated milk, and since I didn't have cumin seed, I simply roasted ground cumin. The texture was perfect, and the thickness was excellent.

I love soup, but this was easy and delicious. I used evap. milk. Would make again.

I changed the recipe some, but kept the main idea and left cauliflower in the lime light. i doubled the recipe, added half a russet potato for some heft, one small zuccini, and threw in a naked corn cob that i saved for stock, which added a deliciously mild sweetness that played well with the other ingredients. i added more cumin than called for, and used evaporated milk, though felt it unnecessary since it was already so creamy. most importantly, i used a very rich pork broth which just elevated the whole dish to four forks. family loved it - and it's quite good chilled, too!

Interestingly enough, I will make this again. I say this because I really changed several ingredients of this, and made it my own. I used celery seed instead of cumin, and I replaced the half and half with 1 cup of milk along with an additional teaspoon of butter and a teaspoon of flour. I increased the lime to the whole juice of one average sized lime. It came out delicious, and I am not sure that qualifies for this recipe or a cast off of it! Enjoy!

Delicious, healthy and easy! I left out the cream/milk added more cumin and a little salt as well. Really hearty and filling. The serving size as it's written is only 1 1/2!

Made this lovely soup for the first course of a Mother's day dinner. Delicious, subtle flavors. Everyone loved it...even those not overly fond of cauliflower.

Not one review has had a negative thing to say about this recipe surprisingly. However, I found it totally disappointing until I made a thickening roux and added one plus cup of shredded yellow and white cheddar to the batch which I had doubled. Then it was a terrific soup. Add more lime and roasted cuminseed (what's wrong with a mortar and pestle? instead of rolling pin on wax paper-that would be odd) and you'll have your favorite cream of cauliflower soup.

Rating: 4
Mmmmm! You aren't kidding! This is not much for 2 people. 2 batches for 3 people would make it. By the way, if you use one of those stick hand blenders (i.e. Rival) you can just blend it in the pan without the hassles of batching it into the blender.

Rating: 3
I made this soup last night and doubled the recipe (a good thing!). The only ingredients that I changed were shallots for the onion and 2% milk for half and half. I would agree that too much onion would definately overpower the taste of this soup, so I used 2 small-ish bulbs. The toasted cumin seed and lime juice were really wonderful ingredients. I will puree less soup next time as I like a more chunky texture and might try some garlic in with the onion. I WILL be making this soup again, it was delicious.

Did not toast cumin, but used cumin powder. Tripled the amount of cumin suggested by the recipe. Added a teaspoon of black mustard seeds. Blended 90% of the soup, left the rest in chunks. This definitely has an outstanding flavor. My guests loved it.

Rating: 3
My fiance and I loved it! The lime gives it a great fresh flavor. I made it once exactly as the recipe is, then made some adjustments. I threw in a zucchini, and instead of cumin seed, I used ground cumin powder and trippled the amount of cumin. I also used 2 tbsp of unsalted butter instead of 1. We will definitely make this quick and easy recipe again!

Rating: 3
Hmmmmmm....I was unsure at first, but YES! This is very interesting. Quick and easy to make, and the cumin surely adds something special! <(Onion Haters: Be careful - make sure to use SMALL onion or even half of one....mine was borderline overpowered by onion.)>

Nice flavor and very easy. I like to add the roasted crushed cumin toi the whole batch of soup after the mixture is pureed. The lime juice is a fine addition but not really necessary.

Good, and pretty easy. I added 2 smashed cloves of garlic and tripled the cumin. I also ground the toasted seeds in my spice grinder rather than using a rolling pin.

A really lovely, flavourful warming soup. I didnt use the half&half because it was quite creamy already. i would possibly cut down on the liquid, you only really need enough to just cover the cauliflower.

Used only small onion...great taste with cumin and lime accents.

I tried this recipe for the first time tonight. It was so incredibly easy. And, the flavor was by far more wonderful than any other cauliflower soup I have ever tasted. I will most definitely make this again - probably very soon. I think I will serve it at Thanksgiving dinner too! I can't wait to share this recipe with my friends and family.

Easy to make, great taste. Have made cauliflower soup before but the lime & cumin realy add great flavour. Will be making again.

I hate it when a recipe tells me to use for example, 1 onion, because onions are different sizes and it is all very arbitrary. Needless to say, I felt like I was eating onion soup with some cauliflower in it. So please make sure to use a SMALL onion. I added some rice to this soup after realizing that the onion had completely overpowered the soup. It made it better but still too oniony.

Rating: 4
This is an awesome and super easy soup. It was even a big hit with my 5 yr. old. I too made a few adjustments like using 2 cups of chicken broth and deleted the water and added a stalk of chopped celery. The touch of lime really makes this soup and I even added a little zest of lime as well. I served it with a green salad and sourdough bread-yummy! Since you can prepare it in under 35 mins, I'll be making this alot.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I used some left over parboiled cauliflower from a relish tray from a party I had last night-so that cut down the cooking time. I cut up a couple of left over small celery sticks and tossed them in too. Like another reviewer, I also added the zest of 1/2 a lime. I only pureed about 2/3 of the soup, 'cause I like it chunky too. When it was done, I tossed in a handful of leftover parboiled brocolli florets. Truly good stuff here!

Delicious soup! I added salt and pepper to the recipe and used 2 cups of chicken broth instead of broth and water. I added the toasted cumin to the soup, ladled it into a thermos and took it on a picnic. It was a Hit! I'll definitely make this often.

Terrific and easy to make soup that has the comfort of a potato soup, but a bit lighter in flavor and no potatoes to peel! Really enjoyed the lime flavor and added a bit more than it called for. Great week night fall meal served with salad and focaccia.

Delicious. I will definitely make it again. It is very tasty and as easy as can be to make. I like that it is very different from most of the other soups I have tried. I only used regular cumin to flavor - will try the toasted seeds some other time.

This was an odd sounding good tasting soup. I was out of chicken stock so I used beef broth I also used the juice of a whole small lime and added S&P plus a little extra cream because it turned out fairly thick it was yummy and comforting. The toasted cumin seeds added the perfect taste to the finished soup.

A very, very good soup which my entire family, including kids, enjoyed. I pureed only about 1/2 the soup leaving some small pieces of cauliflower still in it which we all really liked rather than having it as just a cream soup. I also added a bit more lime juice. This will be made often.

Excellent quick, exotic-tasting soup especially if you use a hand-held blender. It even tastes great if you don't have time to toast cumin seeds and substitute ground cumin.
