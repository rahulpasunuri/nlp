Just curious... why do all of these reviews have spelling mistakes?

This looked beautiful and tasted pretty good, but I've made better dished with similar ingredients. Kind of a disappointment.

Made this for a dinner party. Our guests included a diehard vegetarian and his wife who doesn't like vegetables....both LOVED this. It is so easy and makes a beautifulo presentation.

This is an excellent salad/side dish. I can't believe more people haven't reviewed it. I grilled the vegies and like the other reviewer suggested I added red onion. The flavor of the dressing really comes through.

Excellent. You can add red oignon slices.
