the duck was great but i wasn't blown away by the sauce or the cabbage. Both took far longer than indicated for the liquid to reduce. if i made the cabbage again, i would use oil instead of butter which richness detracted from the fruit flavor.

Very tasty! The cabbage was especially good. As someone else noted it had a bit more depth of flavor, and more subtlety, than other sweet/sour red cabbage recipes I've made. And hard to go wrong with duck and prunes together. As an accompaniment I made an oat groat pilaf (cook groats in broth with a bit of sauteed onion and herbs) which complimented the sweet/earthy flavors of the duck and cabbage. Great dinner party menu in that the cooking can happen while you're socializing. Will add to my short list of duck recipes.

Fabulous meal! Made for Christmas Eve after my husband had been asking for duck for 6 months. He said even after all the build-up of expectations, this dinner exceeded his hopes. My parents and I loved it too. Followed the recipe exactly, except even after a google search, couldn't find any blackberry-cran juice, so used cran-pomegranate. It was wonderful. The cabbage is amazing, too. Served with rustic fresh bread and broccoli in a walnut cream sauce. The 5.07 pound duck was just enough for 4 modest people, but the cabbage makes enough for 8.

The duck came out perfectly (I mixed the prunes with dried apples) in additon to the apple as per recipe. As for the red cabbage, my made my home recipe (the other side of the border... German version). Used balsamic vinegar, a jar of sour cherries, a handful of dried cherries and added a cup of applebutter (back home they use plumbutter). I glazed chopped onions and chopped apples before I added the cabbage, after I added everything else.

Served the red cabbage portion of this recipe alongside an apple-cider braised pork shoulder with caramelized onions (from Gourmet). This is not your typical sweet/sour red cabbage dish; much more complex and sophisticated. Absolutely loved the hints of orange and cinnamon. Added a splash of very good quality balsamic vinegar, as well. Everyone raved about it. This meal was comforting and delicious.

I made the cabbage and prunes only to serve with duck confit and sweet potato risotto. It was excellent! It's tangy but not too much and it was less sweet than I was expecting. The only change I made was green cabbage as that was what we happened to have. By the end, it was purple anyhow. I would definitely make this again, in fact looking forward to it!

It is easy to make, delicious and very festive!

I have only made the red cabbage (as it says you can make it one day ahead) but so far it has been successful. My Danish husband said it was exactly like the red cabbage Danes would make for Christmas eve dinner. I actually used raspberry-cranberry juice as I couldn't find any blackberry juice here. It needed a bit more sugar (I added 1/4 cup so in total I ended up using 1/2 cup). The duck will be made tomorrow, so a review on that shall follow. :o)

Oh shoot! I forgot to say. SAVE THAT FAT! You can totally clarify the fat that comes off the duck and use it later. It makes killer pomme frites!

Alright, this duck was seriously phenomenal. I also cut the cook time a little bit (I mean, I just went by the thermometer, really). I've heard it's sort of hard to mess up roast duck, but nevertheless, I thought these roasting instructions didn't feel in-depth enough and followed some advice from elsewhere about raising it up on a tray, turning it midway through the hour-long roast, and pricking the skin to release the fat after the initial 25 min. Also, DUDE, you can totally just hit the bird with a hairdryer before the roast to make the skin nice and crispy instead of waiting to let it sit out for hours in the fridge. Will definitely make this again

I made this recipe yesterday (Dec. 24, 2008)... followed everything to a T and cut cooking time by 15 minutes. Results: absolutely one of the best ducks I have ever made. I served it with mash potatoes which helped balance out the very rich sauce and a lovely Amarone wine... a new Christmas Eve tradition!

Now, this is what I call a Danish Christmas! The duck was excellent but I suggest watching the time closely. The sauce was excellent but extremely rich - use sparingly or cut with drippings. The cabbage - the first recipe I've found that really tastes like Danish cabbage! The recipes in this article were exceptional without exception!

The cabbage is great, and I followed one reviewer's suggestion to bathe the duck with boiling water with honey, and to air dry for several hours. I think that really helps to tighten up the skin and help it to crisp up. The duck recipe is phenomenal! The sauce is delicious, too, but frankly, it overpowers the delicious duck. Next time, I'll just make the duck without the sauce.

Turned out nicely. I would, in the future, defat the bird by braising first in order to have crispier skin. The sauce is simple to make, but has nice depth. Yum.

I made this for my family as our christmas dinner, and it was an absolute success. The cabbage dish was phenomenal - something I think I will end up making again and again. The prune sauce was also very good, although I added a cup or so of pan juices to reduce the sweetness a bit and add some complexity to the sauce. It means you have to reduce it longer, but it worked beautifully. Finally, the suggested cooking time for the duck is a bit too long. I followed a 15 minutes per pound rule (which is less than the recipe), and still took it out early for a bird with no pink left whatsoever. It was a great, simple meal and I cannot wait to make it again!

the cook from manhassett didn't even follow the recipe, so why rate it???

This was fabulous. I simmered the duck in about 1-1/2 quarts of combination chicken stock and water for 45 minutes to defat the duck. You can do this a day in advance and refrigerate the duck and stock separately. Before roasting I returned the duck to a temperature cool enough to handle but not cold and placed 4 scallions, 3 cloves garlic and a tangerine peel in the cavity. I combined Chinese Five Spice powder, salt and pepper to taste and rubbed the mixture all over the outside of the bird. The duck was roasted at 500 degrees for 15 minutes. I then reduced heat to 375 degrees. I substituted mixed dried fruit for the prunes and used the duck stock to make wild rice. I rate this as one of my top ten At-Home Meals.

All the unusual flavors really spice up the duck!

Good recipe. The red cabbage is delicious. The duck is juicy and flavorful. But what really makes this dish is the combination of the crispy roasted duck with the wine/cranberry/prune sauce. The prunes and sauce are really great and compliment the duck well. They melt in your mouth and have a great complex fruit flavor because of being boiled in the fruit juices. Make sure you make an extra helping of prune sauce if you make this dish.

Delicious! If I didn't know better, I'd swear that the gravy had heroin in it.... yum.

I made this for dinner on Christmas Eve and it was fantastic. I followed one cook's advice for a nice, crispy skin by boiling the whole duck for a moment and then keeping it in the refrigerator uncovered for a few hours. I substituted molasses for the honey when boiling the duck and the skin came out a rich, burgundy color. The cabbage and the red wine give the dish a vibrant, reddish color that I complemented by also serving wild rice with dried fruits and sautéed broccolini. The duck was the centerpiece of a wonderful, festive meal.

I was looking for a recipe for red cabbage to serve with my pork butt braised with port and prunes, and made this one. It ws a true hit at the dinner table. i would like to try it with the duck, but it's hard to find around here. Enjoy!

This is an excellent dish, and it will be our Christmas dinner. With this recipe as with other duck recipes, in order to get a "crispy" skin: in an oval pot or wok, bring to a boil 6 cups water, 1/4 cup honey. Lower duck (put a string under wings for handling)into pot and turn to bathe entire duck. Lift out, put on plate with a rack in refrigerator (uncovered)for at least 2 to 3 hours. Can be done the day before.

Wonderful recipe for doing something different. I was very pleased with the results. The cabbage dish is a keeper. The only variation I made was to the prune sauce, I added some of the liquid from the cabbage to the prune sauce, it sweetened it and made it outstanding.

First off - the cabbage in this recipe is awesome - I make it with other dishes and it is very delicious. I liked the duck and the sauce - the only problem was that the duck didn't get "crispy" enough.... have others had that experience and if so, what do you suggest? I followed the oven temps exactly so am not sure went wrong.

This was incredible, what fabulous favor, the prune sauce was delicious. This was my first time making a duck, and thanks to this great recipe it turned out great. The cabbage was wonderful too. Will definitely make it again. My taste buds are still happy.

I LOVED this! My Dad was a hunter, and I grew up eating dry, overcooked ducks that I did not like. The farm raised ducks of today are a completely different animal (as is the cooking process). My husband and I were both dubious of the prunes - but they were FABULOUS!! Added a wonderful flavor and texture that I didn't expect. I'm of German descent, so the cabbage was a no-brainer - but SO GOOD with the prunes and juice! Next time I'll probably add mashed potatoes to the dinner, as everything else was there. I may cook it less next time - it was more medium than medium rare like we prefer. (My oven may cook hot - but I couldn't find my thermometer) Like it - we LOVED it - YUM YUM!!!!

Easy, delicious and attractive! Doubled the sauce and cabbage recipe for three ducks for Christmas dinner. A BIG hit--everyone loved it. It looked beautiful with the duck carved and sitting on top of a large platter of red cabbage. I did cut down on the prunes in the sauce. Used cranberry juice only and added a little more vinegar to the cabbage as it tasted a little sweet.

This was a fabulous alternative to turkey for a samll gathering. The fruit stuffing added subtle favor to the duck - it didn't even need the prune sauce. The braised cabbage is excellent. held back 25% on the wine and juice and still plenty of liquid.

The German in me grew up eating sweet and sour red cabbage, so I couldn't stop myself from throwing a bit of onion & chopped granny smith apple into the cabbage and replacing the butter with a little smoked diced bacon. I guess with my changes this became more of a Jutland/Schleswig-Holstein dish than pure Danish. Regardless, it really is fantastic as everyone else said. I usually try new dishes by myself before attempting them for the first time with dinner guests. I found myself wishing I had a dinner party going on! It was great.

This is an incredibly elegant dish, worthy of your best china, and is very easy to prepare. The red cabbage is completely unlike any other red cabbage that I have had - there is an earthy spiciness from the cinnamon that is hard to describe, but is an excellent complement to the duck. I would chop the prunes rather than leave them whole next time, but otherwise, would prepare it exactly as written. We started with the parsnip and caramelized apple soup (also on this website) and the dinner was a success.

Absolutely fantastic! Especially nice, as you can make the cabbage the day before. so it's really not that much work. The sauce does get a little sweet. I made a fond with the inerts and used a little less of the prunes in the sauce. Goes really well with some German Spaetzle.

I made this meal as part of my Christmas dinner 2000. The colour of the meal was fanatic and gave a real festive appeal to the dinner. But better still it was absolutely delicious. I'd cook it again, but I'm not hosting Christmas this year. An excellent alternative from Turkey and Cranberry Sauce.
