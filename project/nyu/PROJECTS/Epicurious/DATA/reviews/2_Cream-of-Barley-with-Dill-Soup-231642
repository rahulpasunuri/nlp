Not bad for a simple starter. I don't think I had the right kind of quick cooking barley, so they soup was a little chewy. Next time I'll boil it a little longer. I'd make this again.

The shallots really make this recipe. I used homemade chicken stock and added finely slivered carrots to give the soup a little color. Didn't have access to fresh dill. Soup was delicious anyway.

Ugh. Wouldn't make this again. Closely resembles wallpaper paste, but thinner. Not too zippy.
