Made this for a crowd that included vegetarians and serious meat-eaters - all loved it. This was last year; we had it with just a green salad and dessert and it was plenty. The sauce is to die for - I intended to make it again for pasta but never did. I'm making the whole thing again tonight, a year later, for dinner!

I made this for my vegan brother and sister-in-law. Put shaved parmesan on top for non-vegans. Very good! Served with salad.

Loved it. The sauce especially was terrific. I subbed walnuts for pine nuts and a couple teaspoons dried basil for fresh, since that's what I had on hand, but otherwise made as-is.

Delicious and enjoyed by the entire family including my teenage son. Use dried instant polenta and only required 30 min of baking in the oven. Also I only cooked about 3 -4 min per side. The sauce is excellent as well.

The sauce was a big hit - slightly sweet. I will use a bit more pepper flakes next time. I used instant polenta - it is still somewhat time-consuming as you have to let it set for a while before you cut it and grill/ pan-fry it, but very easy.

I agree that the process for the polenta was lengthy and I don't know if it needs to be pan fried, but the recipe was definately a hit with friends. One thing to note is that I cooked the sauce down for a few hours while the polenta was cooling. I think this was important. I wanted a thicker sauce.

I love polenta and make it fairly often with a variety of sauces or toppings. However, I can't imagine why one would spend almost an hour and a half preparing it in the oven, when with just a few minutes of stovetop stirring, it's ready and can be set up in any number of molds -- a baking sheet, a loaf pan, a simple casserole dish, etc, or, as in panelle, or this recipe, just cut and fried. When making atop the stove, you don't need the oil, either, although I usually do add some butter along with parmesan, or some creamy cheese like marscarpone... Nonetheless, it takes very little time and is an easy foil for great toppings.

The sauce was so easy! I'll make it again and use it over pasta. I cheated and used store-bought polenta.

This was perfect for a gathering which includes vegetarians and meat eaters and it is all "do ahead". No wheat or dairy in this recipe or the sauce, which makes it work for those with allergies too.I made the polenta (added Italian seasoning along with the pepper) and sauce the day before along with my standby Italian style meatballs. Used half the sauce to cook & store the meatballs. The day of the party I finished the polenta just before the guests came and kept it warm in the oven (I only turned the oven up to 250 so it wouldn't dry out.) Reheated the sauce and meatballs. Served with a simple green salad with orange slices and red onion.
