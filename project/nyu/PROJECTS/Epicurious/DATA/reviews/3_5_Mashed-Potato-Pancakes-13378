I really wanted a review where someone used the turkey livers and I couldn't find one! I happened to have turkey livers because I just boned an entire turkey for this week, so I used them. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to cook them first, so I seared them for just a minute before I chopped them up and added to potato mixture. These were great and held together well. The only change I made was using chopped chives instead of onions just because I had them already prepared from last night. I think a mistake I often make with potato pancakes is using too much grease. If you use a well seasoned cast iron skillet, you shouldn't need more than just a spray of oil.

I made these to use up some leftover mashed potatoes. What a treat!! These were so simple and delicious. I used chives in lieu of the liver and marjoram. My husband was smiling the whole time he was eating these. Definitely a keeper!!

I omitted the egg, livers, and marjoram. They turned out great--gooey but easy to flip and did not fall apart. For flavoring I used grated onion, minced fresh jalapeno, and a little shredded Mexican blend cheese. Everyone loved them. I will definitely be making them again. Next time I will use less oil. They don't need so much with a nonstick pan. The other reviews convinced me to make them thin but they would have been fine, probably better, a little thicker.

I used all scallions instead of onion; parsley would have been a good addition. With sour cream -- delicious!

Great way to use up left over mashed. I omitted the liver and tyme, added a 1/4 corn meal, a 1/4 leftover corn, chopped fresh parsley, a dash of chipolte chili powder , ground mixed peppercorn, and sea salt, a quick grating of romano cheese. Spicy and wonderful all by themselves. Will do this again.

I give this 4 forks because it's exceptionally easy, fast & delicious. We make extra mashed potatoes specifically for this recipe - - my kids beg me to make them. I use extra onion (maybe 1/4 cup?) and always skip the marjoram and liver, but I bet they'd be great w/ liver. I also add 1/2 tsp. kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. I use a 1" diam icecream scoop to plop them into the skillet (stainless steel) and flatten slightly with a fork -this makes it very easy to form perfect 2- 2 1/2 inch circles. They come out crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and have never fallen apart for me. Yum!

Sorry folks, do not make this recipe. I consider myself (as do most people on this site) a good cook. I halved this recipe exactly and it was a disaster. The pancakes fell apart and what did get cooked had to stay in the oil so long (at medium heat) they almost burned. More flour and egg? That might work, but too much effort and, on a website like this, too many other recipes to try.

Maybe I didn't flatten them them enough. But, they turned out gooey on the inside the edges where they were thinner were nice. l'll sya the flavor was good, but I'll try it again making them thinner. Suggestion to others...thin pancakes.

Delicious! Much lighter than the type my mom used to make (we would add more flour and make patties). The grated onion really is essential, as is the sourcream on the side. I just tasted one so far, but am planning on having them with smoked salmon, sour cream, dill, sliced cucumber and a crisp california chardonnay. Sounds lovely, no?

I substituted the following: *Ham instead of liver *Fresh sage instead of marjoram I added: *1 T grated fresh parmesan *1 T grated granny smith apple (squeezed dry) *Thin slices of gruyere cheese before popping in the oven It turned out delicious!

Delicious taste. I left out the liver part. I would recommend either pushing them down a lot when you fry them or making them kind-of small. Mine came out a little under cooked in the middle. Otherwise a wonderful side dish.

Just finished up my thankgiving leftover potatoes with this recipe. What a snap and super good. Only had a cup of potato left over so I cut this in half, used heaping Tablespoon of onion, S&P. Voila. Done. Simple. These will probably replace Sunday pancake recipe in the future.

this is how my mom used to make her "quickie latkes". I love it, and now I can make them. I used Yukon Gold Potatoes, some parsley, grated garlic, and cayenne for kick, and they came out fabulous. THANKS!

Fabulous way to use up either baked or mashed potatoes. Yum! The grated onion is key, as everyone else says.

These are the potato pancakes of my childhood! (minus the liver) Yes, the onion is crucial, and if you want to change it up sometime, try a bit of nutmeg instead of marjoram. Wonderful!

Yes! Now I can make potato pancakes. Everyone liked them. I used a non-stick pan which I found was key. This was so easy and now I can use my leftover mashed potatoes! Thank you!

I made this with some thanksgiving leftovers, and it turned out great. I left out the marjoram and turkey livers, and added some shredded cheese, but otherwise followed the recipe. I served it with left over cranberry sauce and sour cream. I'll use this recipe whenever I have left over mashed potatoes.

We were looking for a way to make pancakes with leftover mashed potatoes and this fit the bill perfectly. In place of the turkey livers we used cheddar cheese but followed the rest of the recipe exactly and the pancakes were delicious. They were a big hit with the whole family.

I used leftover Garlicky Mashed Potatoes, which I also got from this site. Didn't love the initial recipe in the first place, so that's probably why I did not like this either. Skipped the liver (triggers bad childhood memories). Did not really care for the texture of the pancakes. My lovely husband ate them up, but he would probably eat cardboard if it was fried.

Very good potato pancake recipe, even if it is not the most "traditional". Didn't use the meat and threw in a little bit of grated sharp cheddar. I am sure they would be just as delicious w/o the cheese but it added a nice creaminess. I whole heartedly recommend this recipe!

i've tried for years to make potato pancakes that i would enjoy, never could until this resipe thanks alot!

I got a little creative. I had some extra minced shallots (made a beurre blanc for the entree), so I sauteed those with some shiitake mushrooms, added some finely sliced green onion and parsley, omitted the marjoram. I then used the pancakes as a base for the Scallops with Beurre Blanc I found on this site. Very good!

great recipe, I made these using leftover Thanksgiving mashed potatoes. I served them to friends on the day after thanksving. They were a huge hit. I served them with leftover dill sourcream dip, so I omitted the marjoram and used parsley instead.

I've been trying to get the left over potatoes to cook properly for many moons. This is the way to do them. Not a sloppy mess as they have been in the past.

Very delicious! A great comfort food. I, like one of the other reviewers, used bacon grease, and it was very tasty.

These were good - they are very mild in flavor, so you should serve them with something bold. I served them with sliced baked ham. I stacked them pancake - ham - pancake - ham - and then surrounded with a rich gravy. It was really good and a pretty presentation.

Great recipe, and a great use for left-over mashed potatoes. I had my herb-infused mashed potatoes in the freezer since Thanksgiving--defrosted them and drained off the excess water. These were really easy and tasty--would probably be fabulous if freshly made! Serve with creme fraiche or sour cream softened with milk.

This is probably something that this site will consider blasphemy, but I used instant Herb and Garlic mashed potatoes(gasp!-hey its what I have in the house). That would be the only reason why I would give this 3 instead of 4. It worked out very well and was perfect for my wife who's stomach is upset today. I substituted rosemary for marjoram, as I didn't have marjoram. I then used it as a bed for some monterey jack cheese. I mixed about 1.5 cup (or so) of tofu, marjoram, green onions, salt/pepper to taste in a food processor. Took that mixture and, using the same pan as the potatoes, cooked the tofu mixture which was a dry cottage cheese consistency. When it was warmed substantially(about 2 min) in the pan I flipped it, without breaking it, and did the other side. To finish it off I placed the tofu fritatta on top of the shredded monterey jack cheese and made a little breakfast sandwich. Keeping in mind her stomach was upset this had just enough spice to give it flavor but not too much to further upset. Using this recipe as a base for the plan it worked out well. I know that this is not exactly the same as homemade garlic mashed potatoes, but I thought some people might want to hear how the cheap/impatient kitchen cretin did. Thanks!

For years I have frugally tried to make pancakes out of leftover mash potatoes. I always ended up with a grease sodden mess that fell apart the minute I tried to turn it. These were absolutely fabulous. I gave it a four because of its kind, I felt it was the best potato pancake I've ever had. I used leftover roasted garlic mashed potatoes that were made with olive oil, not butter. I grated the onion and added the marjoram as well as about a tbsp of fresh minced parsley. I salted them the minute they came out of the pan. Enjoy!

Oh wow. I just tried one while the others are cooking. Yum Yum Yum. No turkey liver, no marjoram. I'm going to have to make extra mashed potatos from now on. I used yukon gold for mashed potatos the other night, so that's what we've got in there now.

I will certainly use this again to dispose of leftover mash in the most delicious of ways... they were great with mushroom gravy and leftover meat loaf. Of course, I left out the marjoram and turkey liver and used scallions instead of grated onion. I will also try it with crumbled bacon and grated hard cheese: It's worth making extra mash just to try new combos!

to make the pancakes more uniform, use a ice cream scoop, let one side brown a bit then flip and flatten. you can brown the first side more once the second side has finished. i found using a spoon was a bit messy since the batter is quite sticky.

Made this recipe as a last minute item. Had planned on Rice but found Potato in the Ref and decided on pancakes. My wife and I both found it far superior to any past recipe. Will use it often. I did leave out the marjoram.

These remind me of the mashed potato pancakes my mother made as a child. Nothing outstanding, but it's great comfort food. I skipped the liver & substituted scallions for the grated onion. But watch the heat! Since the recipe calls for moderately high heat, by the time I cooked the second batch, they browned *very* quickly.

very tasty and fairly easy, works well with roasts. doesn't need a sauce but is better for it. I siced the roast(lamb)thin, and layered it on the potato. thin sliced lamb and crusty potato with a demi of some kind is a nice combination.salad and a red are the only other things you need for this dish. good recipe!

I don't care for the marjoram, or even the liver. The recipe needs nothing more than the egg, the flour, and as many onions as humanly possible! Delectable!
