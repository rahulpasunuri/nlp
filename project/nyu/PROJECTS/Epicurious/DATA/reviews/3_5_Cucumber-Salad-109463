Unusual, but strangely refreshing even though there it includes strong-tasting fish sauce. I will definitely make again, especially when I am making Thai-inspired dishes.

I found this recipe quite delicious and simple. Tangy with the lime juice.

Sorry, don't mean to sound negative since I rated the Indian Cucumber Salad badly, but this recipe is also not worth repeating.

Refreshing and simple salad.....I made this recipe with the dried shrimp but next time I would make without...
