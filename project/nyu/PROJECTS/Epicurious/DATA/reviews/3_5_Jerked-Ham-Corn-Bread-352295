a nice easy quick bread that used up ingredients I already had on hand. Everyone in the family loves it. It would be a good brunch food, or just a side bread to a bigger meal. Love the jerk, I doubled the amount required and would add even more next time. yummy

I was disappointed. Found the corn bread dry and didn't care for the flavor. I expected it to be special with the good reviews and a whole stick of butter. I have a recipe for zucchini corn bread with bacon, white corn, cheddar cheese. It is MUCH better and much more healthy. If anyone wants the recipe, just email me at herrondm@comcast.net.

At my family's insistence on a very basic corn bread at a gathering, I made this recipe without the ham and jerk seasoning, and with salted instead of unsalted butter, dropping the quarter teaspoon of salt, and it came out very well! Against their wishes, I also made a sticky corn pudding that they ended up going NUTS over. Message me for that recipe, if you're interested!

So tasty, so easy and quick. Keep the ingredients on hand and you'll find yourself making it often. Have made this four or five times, each time same tasty results. Today I'm going to try it with pork cracklings that I have leftover from a roasted pork shoulder I made yesterday rather than running out to buy ham. My mouth is watering already.

This was really good! Quick and easy. This is great for a quick lunch or a lighter dinner. I have to agree with the person above, I am shocked no one else has tried this. Doesn't sound good but was excellent!

I can't believe I'm the first to review this recipe! I guess it doesn't sound as good as it tastes... but that shouldn't prevent you from making it! So delicious, moist and flavorful, and great for breakfast the next morning too.
