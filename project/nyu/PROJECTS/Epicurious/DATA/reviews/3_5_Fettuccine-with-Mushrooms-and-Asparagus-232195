I made this recipe tonight and it was Fantastic! I'm vegan so I changed it up a bit..I did add two cloves of garlic, instead of Heavy Cream I added Cashew cream. I also added dried porcini mushrooms, I used the water I reconstituted them with as the vegetable broth. I also did not add the cheese. It was great, not too oily at all. Even my non-vegan family loved it. I would make this again and again.

My husband, which doesn't like mushrooms, enjoyed this dish very much. So much he he asked me to make it several times since. Instead of red onions I used shallots and used a mixture of shitake and portabello, as I couldn't find cremini.

Actually 4 forks as I made it: half the olive oil, no added butter at the end and milk instead of heavy cream. To thicken it, I added about a tablespoon of flour at the end of sauteeing the mushrooms and cooked it a bit before adding the broth, etc. Not greasy, still delicious. Oh, and I was out of fresh basil so I added some dried to the cooking mushrooms so the flavor would have time to come out. I was lucky enough to have fresh shitake mushrooms and their flavor really shone in this dish.

Delicious! I followed the recipe but used Asiago instead of Parm/Reg cheese.

I substituted the broth for wine to reduce the sodium.

Great basic recipe that's ripe for modification. I used bacon fat with the olive oil and added sliced bacon: delicious. I added 1 diced red pepper too. It gave the red, white and green Italian flag look. I recommend fettuccine versus pappardella.

This was delicious and very easy. I added two cloves of garlic and instead of using 3/4 cup heavy cream, I used 1/2 cup heavy cream and added 1/4 cup of red wine to cut down on the fat. The red wine added a nice depth to the dish. I thickened up the sauce with cornstarch.

I made this for a dinner party. It was a hit. I substituted organic regular-sized asparagus and a mixture of portobello and dried porcini mushrooms. I boiled the pasta with some of the water that I used to hydrate the mushrooms. I greatly reduced the amount of cream, butter, and olive oil in response to some of the complaints in other reviews. Delicious!

I kinda felt like the directions were a little blurry on this one, but that let me experiment more. I had fun making this and my bf looooooved it and can't wait for me to make it again. I used full size asparagus and they were cooked perfectly. I also didn't slice my schrooms since I had very small ones and we liked it better than way. I think I'd add some garlic next time...

Delicious, easy. I substituted nonfat milk and a gob of goat cheese for the cream.

This is a good recipe for an easy dinner. For more flavor, I added 4 cloves of garlic with the onion and chili flakes. I added some rehydrated porcini mushrooms with the cremini. I also added some defrosted frozen peas while the sauce was reducing.

This is a keeper. Like another reviewer I combined fresh porcini with the cremini mushrooms. Also used half and half, thickening it with a little Wondra. Eliminated the butter. Finally, used porcini broth (bouillon cubes available at some Italian groceries) which upped the mushroom flavor.

Really enjoyed this one... made few modifications: less oil, regular aspargus, light cream (which admittedly made thin sauce) and less butter. Gotta keep the cheese! Still excellent.

What a mess this turned out to be! Maybe I did something wrong, given how much everyone else seems to've liked it...

This recipe was fabulous! The only things I changed were - substituted chicken stock for vegetable, added only 1 T of butter and used bow tie whole wheat pasta (half the amount). I also used regular sized asparagus which did not over cook. The pine nuts, basil and parm. cheese really complimented this recipe. I will make this again.

Sophisticated taste, but easy to make. It's amazing! Make this tonight!!

I was missing some of the main ingredients, so I changed it up and added my own twist to it. It came out so good I wanted to share it with you. Instead of the onion, mushrooms and pine nuts, I used roasted red bell peppers, garlic and roma tomatoes. Instead of cream, I used goat cheese. First I sauteed the garlic and the peppers, and then added the broth and red pepper flakes. Like the other reviewer, I was concerned about the asparagus getting mushy, so I added them towards the end. Finally, I added the fettucine, goat cheese and tomatoes to the mixture, sauteeing until the goat cheese melted. I topped it all off with grated pecorino. It was delicious. Don't be afraid to experiment with this recipe. It's well worth it.

Very delicious! I used trenette pasta and added fresh porcini mushrooms to the crimini mushroooms called for in the recipe. I was concerned the asparagus would cook to mush if added when suggested, so I added them in the last two minutes while the sauce was reducing so they were al dente. I doubled the recipe for a group of eight as main course. My guests raved and asked for the recipe.
