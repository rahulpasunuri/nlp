I don't know why this doesn't have a full 4 forks. I make this all the time with fresh beans from our farm share. If you use dried, I can understand how it might not taste quite as good and also how it might take longer to cook. But if you use fresh beans it doesn't take any time at all. It would be a great app, but we just eat it for the main course with a nice loaf of fresh bread and lots of olive oil. Enjoy!

I tried this using dried black eyed peas from my garden. I halved the recipe, but the peas did not cook up in the 25 minutes called for. I added additional liquid and cooked for an additional 15 minutes, and the peas were just barely edible. Don't know what I did wrong....not sure if I'll try it again.

I used dried black eyed peas (I could not find fresh or frozen ones) and this recipe was still delicious. This is great served with a white flakey fish... I used tilapia and whisked up some lemon juice, minced shallots, olive oil, salt and pepper and spooned it on top of the fish. So good! My dinner plate looked like I ordered it from a restaurant.

I ate this at a friend's house and the next day had to make it myself so my husband and I could eat it again. Seemed like a weird combo but it really works- we used fresh black eyed peas (my friend used frozen and was equally good). Brought it for lunch today and was equally good as the day I made it.

The third paragraph of preparation should read: "Stir basil and remaining 1 tablespoon thyme into peas. Discard bay leaf. Season to taste with salt and pepper."

The recipe ingredients call for 1/2 t. plus 1 T chopped fresh thyme, but the directions include only the 1/2 t. Anyone have any idea when we use the T of thyme?

I thought this was a great lite side. I took it to a small dinner party and it was a hit.

I was skeptical, but this was really delicious. We used fresh purple hull peas. It's a great summer dinner and is great as a main course or a side. We've made it twice already!
