This is the best potato salad I have ever made. Everyone always asks for the recipe.

Really great salad, but the pickles alone were FANTASTIC. They will be a picnic, cook-out, weekend staple for us.

This recipe worked so well for so many others that I wonder if I did something wrong. When I mixed the cucumbers into the potatoes, I ended up with a sort of mushy coating on everything. It still tastes good, but it looks bad and the mushy texture of the 'dressing' isn't what I was hoping for. I'll probably try this one again, but I can't give it a high rating for now.

Fabulous! Made this for our 4th of July barbecue. Our brisket and ribs can be a little spicy so this recipe is great as a cooling element in the meal. We totally love this recipe and will make it every year from now on.

Drained the brine on the potatoes while they were still hot in the colander, as others suggested. Non mayo salad people loved it as well as me (may lover). I would add more fresh dill before serving. Lots of steps and time prep but its managable if you have the time. A keeper.

Made this for a party to rave reviews. Mixed yukon & russet and only peeled what came off easily with my fingers, which only made it more flavorful.

Great recipe for non mayo salad. Dill is amazing but added more beforing serving. Used too many potatoes, I think, so I would cut down next time. Followed reviewers suggestions by draining the pickled mixture through the potatoes for added flavor. The radishes add crunch & color. Lots of prep, but since you can do so many steps ahead of time, it was no big deal.I may chop up the onions or sub shallots next time. Great fresh taste and new way to make a potato salad thats unique. Definetly a keeper.

I haven't found a person yet who doesn't LOVE this potato salad. It's become one of our summer picnic must-haves. The dill pickles and radishes are a great addition to an old standard. (Like the previous reviewer, I use half mayo and half Greek yogurt.)

Absolutely OUTSTANDING!!! I can't wait to make it again. I thought the pickled cucumbers might be strange, but they made the salad. The only change I made was to use half mayo and half Greek Yougurt.

Does anyone have an opimion on whether this could be made with baby red or gold potatoes that would be left unpeeled?

This might become my new potato salad. Such a nice change from the mayo and egg version I've been making for years. Lighter and fresher and so flavorful - love it.

This was fantastic and thoroughly enjoyed by all our guests at an evening BBQ. Well worth the pickling work the night before. I had a bit of difficulty using coarse salt as it didn't dissolve into the vinegar (stirred for long period of time, then tried to heat in microwave - still no luck). I used it anyway and it left the cucumbers ultra salty - remedied by rinsing them in water then in vinegar, followed by the drying time. This worked and the dish was wonderful!

Best potato salad recipe I have found for a summer BBQ. Amazing flavour and super easy to make. Just remember to start the day before with the pickles.

I made this for a picnic. I am testing recipes for salads for my brother's wedding. The potato salad was a smash hit. I can't believe all the positive comments I got on the salad. We will definitely make it for my brother's wedding.

My mother--who loves dill--really enjoyed this recipe. I did too. It was easy and came out nicely. Next time I'm going to follow other reviewers' suggestions for pouring out the brine to intensify the pickle flavor.

I think we chopped the cucumbers a little too thinly, as they didn't hold their shape very well in all that vinegar. Apart from that it was wonderful. A bit of work, peeling the potatoes after boiling them, but worth it in the end. I will make it again for sure.

this is fabulous--served it at a BBQ & everyone raved over it. i got lazy during the prep & did not peel the potatoes, and it came out fine.

This is my new favorite potato salad. But then I've always loved pickled cucumbers so it's a great combination. The only thing I do differently is I add mayo starting with large dollops and stop when I sense it's "enough". I don't think it's quite 3/4 cup. I've renamed it Swedish Potato Salad 'cause it's so Scandinavian (with all that dill & the pickled cukes).

This is the very best potato salad ever! Love it! I've made it many times, always to rave reviews.

This is wonderful! I use rice wine vinegar, and haven't used the radishes, but it is wonderful with halved cherry tomatoes added at the end. I recommend putting the potato pieces into the colander, topping with the sliced onion, and then pouring the cucumber mixture over the top, to allow the brine to drain through the potatoes. Transfer to large bowl and mix after completely drained, and allow more time for the flavors to blend before adding the mayo.

The perfect classic potato salad. Can be made in advance and keeps for days!

This is excellent. Everyone raves over it.

Best Ever Just add the cucumber dill to the potatoes, let sit for about an hour, then the mayonnaise. Let the potatoes absorb all the flavor, the fat in the mayo will block that if added too soon. This is great for tailgate parties.

I used cider vinegar instead of white..nice change for potato salad, everyone slammed it down and wanted more

Rating: 3
this is a great salad for hot weather. The crunchy texture of the cukes and goes great with the creaminess of the potatoes. Also, the flavor is nice and light (if you don't overdo the mayo.) It does have a lot of standing time so, it's not something you pull together at the last minute.

I made this salad for the first time this weekend. I would have given the salad two forks; but, my husband really liked it. So between the two of us it earned three forks. I was expecting a better salad based on the reviews. I did love the pickled cucumbers and plan on making those again on their own. I like the Potato, Cucumber, and Dill Salad recipe from Epicurious better.

What a pain to make (time-consuming) but definitely worth it! Everyone raved about how delicious it was and wanted the recipe. It's different from your standard, boring potato salad so it stands out! I used disposable plastic gloves to mix it which made it easier.

Without a doubt, this is THE BEST potato salad I have ever eaten. The individual flavors of each ingredient really stand out., yet work perfectly together. And no mustard or egg yoks in sight, what a nice change! The guests at my party raved over it. It's a bit fiddly to prepare, but well worth the effort. A mandoline makes short work of the cukes, onion, and radishes. I believe it is essential that all are very thinly sliced. I doubled the recipe and the most difficult part was mixing it. Folding the ingredients with clean hands turned out to be the best way.

The cucumbers and fresh dill made this a cut above the ordinary potato salad. Very refreshing and my guests enjoyed it.

Just wonderful, but the second time I tweaked it a bit with my own tater salad faves. Adding 8 oz. drained can each niblet corn and baby peas, and 1 C. thinly sliced celery. Also I added 1/4 tsp curry powder to the mayo.

This potato salad is always receives rave reviews. It has defiantly become my stand-by dish for any event that I am unsure of what to bring. My only suggestion would be to make extra dilled cucumbers, as personally I think they make a great snack.

Really an excellent recipe - I've made this a number of times now and it always turns out good and is a big hit! While it is easy, it does take quite a bit of time if you follow the directions as stated.

A good variation of basic potato salad. The cukes make if more refreshing and "summery".

This was delicious, so easy to make and had a wonderful lingering aftertaste. I cut the portions down for two. Since I didn't have any Yukon Gold potatoes, I simmered peeled Russett potatoes cut into 1/2" pieces to an al dente stage the day before to save time then drained and refrigerated them. I also used dried dill which worked fine and didn't wait the time alloted for draining the cucumbers, just drained them very well before blending in the mayonnaise and served. This recipe is definitely a keeper, we loved it and I am looking forward to making it again to share with others!

Have made this salad twice. A refreshing salad for a warm summer evening. Used more dill than called for in the recipe
