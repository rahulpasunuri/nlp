Really good, I will make this again but will be sure to finely mince the anchovy. Toasting the fennel seed was important for good flavour. Also - be generous with the butter mixture and choose a good bread.

This was so easy. Made it for dinner guests and they all raved about it. Was asked for the recipe the following week.
