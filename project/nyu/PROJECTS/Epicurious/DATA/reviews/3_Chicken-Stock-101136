The flavor of so many recipes for soups, stews, sauces, and braises is directly related to the quality of the stock used in the recipe. Commercial stocks aren't terrible, but, they have a mass-produced,flat and salty taste to me. Homemade stock was a revelation to me, after I finally decided to put the effort into making it. Freeze it in small batches and voila. Two critically important suggestions. First, roast the chicken and the vegetables for 20 minutes at 500. This carmelizes the ingredients and adds a great deal of rich flavor. Second, buy a large crock pot, at least 6 quart capacity and then add all ingredients; set to LO heat and leave overnight. Result is very flavorfull. Leave in refrigerator overnight so that fat comes to the top and is easily skimmed off. Freeze in small containers.

As a freezer staple -- for use in soups, risotto, sauces -- homemade stock cannot be beat, and this recipe makes a fine one. There is simply no comparison in taste, or price, with canned broths. Best of all, you can control the amount of salt: low-salt broth tastes anemic to me, whereas regular broth is usually way too salty. Both varieties taste vaguely of tin. This recipe is easy, but it is time-consuming: 14 cups of water take a long while to boil, on my stove at least, so you may want to start that first. Also, I suggest adding more bay leaves -- I tripled the amount.
