We make this wonderful soup at least once a month. Very simple and very flavourful. Great with grated fresh parmesan on top, and a nice baguette on the side.

Fast and simple! And all with ingredients you can keep around the house. Will definitely keep this one in mind as an easy, yummy weeknight dinner that doesn't require shopping or much prep time.

I have made this many times because it is so good. Try it you'll like it.

I had to give it 3 forks, because it was so easy and very hearty. I think a lot less savory can be used and perhaps put in your own additions like pesto, etc. I look forward to making this again and trying some new things in the recipe.

I just finished making this soup and it tastes pretty good to me. I was worried about the red peppers dominating the flavor, but that didn't happen at all. I didn't have any oil packed sundried tomatoes, so I just used dried. I also used dried basil and oregano. I didn't have savory (I admit I don't really know what that is and couldn't find it in the store). I'll make it again!

I love this soup, even my carnivorous husband likes it, go figure. It really has a good flavor that is better than one might expect with the small and simple list of ingredients and very quick preparation. I've made it several times and will again.

This is a family favorite. So easy and quick. I change it to feed a large family, by using 64oz can of broth, 2 cups water, a whole bag of bow tie pasta, doubling the drained sun-dried tomatoes and I throw all the ingredients in at once before boiling.

I found this soup oily and the peppers completely dominated the flovor of the soup. I will not be making this again.
