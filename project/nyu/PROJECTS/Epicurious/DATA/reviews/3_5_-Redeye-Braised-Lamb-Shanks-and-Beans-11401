Made this the first month it was published, way back when!! And last night (11/3/12) for a dinner party. Everyone wanted the recipe. Delicious! We pretty much followed the recipe. But after having lamb shanks at a restaurant that took the meat off the bones, that is how we do it now. We find it not as "jarring" as when that huge bone is on everyone's plate. And practically no one eats the whole thing off the bone, so by serving this way, the leftovers are wonderful.

This is one of my husband's favorite lamb dishes (and mine, too). It's a snap to make, and is pretty much a whole meal. I use pinto beans instead of kidney beans, and put it in the crock pot and forget about it.

I did this totally in the crock pot. It was delicious! I did add salt, but I am a bit of a salt-a-holic. I presoaked the beans before adding to the crockpot and added enough liquid (combo of coffee and water) to cover the beans by about an inch or so. I did skip the bacon, just to save on calories.

This is an excellent recipe for lamb shanks. The coffee and bacon gave off wonderful aromas while braising. Unfortunately, no coffee flavors remained after cooking. I'll try doubling the amount used next time. The beans were very good in this dish. Being a starch junkie, I also served polenta with this. This dish went very well with a Renwood Zinfandel.

Wonderful dish for a cold winter day and it's great because you put it in the oven and then forget about it. Served with sauteed mustard greens which were a nice contrast. I have used it for company but found than if people really like lamb shanks they loved this. If they were only so-so about them to begin with, this recipe didn't change their minds!

Comfort food. It was easy it could also be made in a crock pot. Anice thing about this is it can be made with variations from whatever is available.
