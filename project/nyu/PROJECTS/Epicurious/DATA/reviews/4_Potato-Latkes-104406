Perfect latkes! Made them for my son's class- gone in 5 minutes. Don't forget the applesauce and sour cream.

These are the first latkes I've ever actually liked! They taste purely of potato, no filler. We used less onion than called for, just so it didn't overwhelm the potatoes, and we did use the extra egg recommended by others. They came out beautifully crispy and very delicious. Our new standard for latkes!

Simple, delicious. We made in advance, and when cool, froze in a tupperware container. After a week, we reheated in a 400 oven for about 5-10 minutes (from frozen) - served as an hors d'oeuvre with a cream cheese/horseradish spread and smoked salmon on top. Amazing. Also served with a smoked chicken/ cherry bbq sauce and everyone loved them. Great to keep on hand for impromptu guests. Even good at room temperature.

This is the best recipe for latkes *ever*. The latkes are simple but delicious. The key is to make them fresh.

Complete fail on this recipe, I should have known better then to make latkes without a binder... need matzo meal or at least flour... total waste of time and disappointment... but could be a great hash brown recipe which is what this basically makes

My 8 year old son suggested making these after seeing a kids TV show about them...they were really good! My first few I spread too thin and they didn't hold together as well - found they held together better the thicker you make them. Didn't add extra egg or flour, followed recipe exactly and we ate the whole batch.

Easy and perfect latke recipe. I served these for brunch to make an egg nest - stack two crispy latkes, top with a fried egg, and sprinkle with some colorful garnish (parsley, sliced cherry tomatoes, etc.) Delicious and pretty!

Loved these latkes! It was my first time making latkes and I followed the recipe closely, using 1 additional egg per other reviewers. They were perfect - made them for a Chanukah dinner and everyone devoured them! I added some pepper to a few of the batches while they were cooking and that was great, too. I did not get 12 - 16 latkes though, more like 10. Used yukon gold potatoes. Yummy. Going to finish up the potatoes with another batch tomorrow.

This is a wonderful basic recipe. Drain the potatoes in a salad spinner instead of a colander, and you will get a lot more of the water out. We doubled the recipe, and added about 1/3 cup of flour to hold the latkes together. The flour was added in stages, 1/2 at the beginning and 1/2 as we were making the last batches. If you are making multiple batches, drain the mixture if liquid forms prior to frying.

Needs two eggs lightly beaten! I like sour cream with capers on top.

Very basic, very light and very easy. The Yukon golds were the perfect potato for this dish and I couldn't agree more that they add a nice golden and crispy touch. I did, however, add in some flavor by adding in a hand-shredded parsnip, some freshly grated ginger and two cloves of finely shredded (yes, I had my hand-shredder out for this recipe) garlic. I upped the salt, too, but not by much. I will definitely be making this recipe again this week for both my children's class parties and for my mother's house Friday night. So if that says anything about the ease and taste, there you have it.

Found I needed an extra egg to hold them together. I keep the mixture in a sieve over a bowl as the mixture gives off liquid while it sits.

after reading the reviews, grated ukon golds (unpeeled) and onions, towelled the moisture out, added some potato starch and fried 'em up. quick, quick, quick. froze them in single layers and then kept them bagged in the freezer til reheating (350 for 10-15 min.) everyone liked them but they were bland and tasteless--needed more salt and pepper.

For my very first attempt at making latkes, I tried this recipe and was quite impressed with how easy they were and how well they turned out. I did follow the directions as far as squeezing out the liquid, and did not add any flour or anything. I started with just one latke to get a feel for how well they would hold together and how long they would take to cook. I over cooked the first one, but the rest came out beautifully. My boyfriend was quite happy with them as well. I will make this recipe again, but I will add some herbs or garlic for flavor.

My daughter and I just made these and they turned out great, after a few learning bumps. We learned that the thicker latkes worked better, than the really thin ones. I also hadn't adequately heated up the cast iron skillet, but the latkes in the second skillet, a non-stick pan, came out perfectly. The flavor was really good. We will definitely use this recipe again.

Followed recipe exactly using russets and olive oil; soaked and squeezed hand- grated potatoes; didn't add anything other than onions, eggs, and salt. PERFECTION. Feathery light, crispy on the outside, nice toothsomeness on the inside, excellent ratio of potato-onion- salt. They held together just fine but they weren't cakey--I prefer them this way, but others may not. I think one important step for us was to have both of us (my daughter and myself) manning the stove. Had three cast iron skillets going and we worked together to ladle in the batter and get them turned at just the right point. We sort of accidentally doubled the recipe but ended up eating ALL of them in one sitting. They were fantastic! And what a fun little family experience.

Rating: 4
This is a simple recipe that is easy to prepare and produces great results. Be sure to drain the potatoes well. I then squeezed the water out of them after rinsing by putting a hanful in one hand, then cupping my other hand over it. You may find an extra egg helps with binding everything together. I cooked on low on my big burner, 6.5 minutes per side, partially covered. Great results. I substitute scallions next time and see how they taste.

We make this recipe every year. The potato mixture does become watery as it sits. After we shred the onions and potato we wring them out in a clean dish towel and then add the egg and salt. The flavor is fantastic if you use russet potatoes. Thank God for the food processor!! No need to peel the potatoes.

this was my first time trying a latkes recipe. I really enjoyed the finished product. It's hard to believe it's just some potatoes, egg, and flour. I also added some thyme to give it that something extra. I can't wait to make these for my in-laws.

Not a bad recipe, but I found them to be more like hashbrowns...crispy, but not very cake-like. They fell apart easily. I added a little potato starch to the second batch, and it was much better!

These are very good indeed, although I make different recipes different years and on different occasions. I also quite like the recipe from Zabar's which is included in this group: http://www.oneforthetable.com/oftt/hannukah/one-for-the-tables-latke-extravaganza-2.html; I made it this year for my second of two Hanukkah parties.

Nice, basic latke. I didn't bother to peel the potatoes, and they came out great. I also grated the onion right along with the potato instead of chopping it. The latkes cooked nicely in the olive oil. We only got 10 latkes out of the deal, though.

Rating: 3
This was a great basic recipe. Excellent to make with kids, as long as you supervise. I didn't need to soak the potatoes, especially since I grated them a bit finer than was called for. I also added about 3tsp flour to make sure everything would stick together. Next time, I'll try some garlic or spices to add some extra flavor; this time, applesauce & sea salt were the perfect finish.

Perfection! I used russet, and followed recipe to a T. Topped with smoked salmon and served dilled sour cream on the side. The recipe wasn't specific on reheating if you did them ahead of time so I looked in Cook's Illustrated.

Oh, deliciousness. We made them with Yukon Gold potatoes and doubled the recipe sort of accidentally and then ate ALL of it, just two of us. Totally follow the tip about using the potato starch from the bowl from the user reviews. They got all deliciously crispy trailing bits on the outside, soft fluffy inside.

First time I have made latkes that I actually liked (practising for next week). I think the soaking and drying really help and they stayed together instead of falling apart in the oil. Also keeping warm in the oven means that any uncooked bits cook through.

I found these fairly easy to make. I didn't soak/drain because I wanted to keep the starch. I noticed one reviewer added bacon, which I found a bit insulting, ironically though, since I don't keep kosher. But to go out of my way to add a forbidden food to latkes over a Jewish holiday? Please, a little respect, folks...

I've made these several times and they are every bit and usually better than any other I've tried. I grate by hand and may add fresh chopped parsley. You can also make them in advance, drain them on paper towels and freeze. Crisp in a 375 degree oven and serve topped with smoked salmon, sour cream and caviar. Yum!

Rating: 4
Simple is best. I learned how to make these two years ago following the online directions, and they don't go wrong once you get the handle on them. As with most food that you fry the key is getting the oil temperature right. However, once you figure this bit out, you can literally set the timer for five minutes on each side and walk away! These latkes do a fine job of holding together - something that I've found tricky in other recipes. This is my staple recipe - so easy to remember, so easy to make, and always tasty.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. I grated. Thought about the cuisinart but grating was quick and the slices were nice and thin and long. I used a cuisinart last time and the pieces were too thick and wouldn't cook. Also the added cuisinart chopping step is a no-no. I think for cohesivity you want long thin strands. I went heavy on the onions which probably detracted from cohesivity. I did all the draining steps. Sounds like a lot but was very easy. Didn't peel the potatoes, just brushed them clean.

Rating: 0
I have a wonderful hint for those who think the preparation time added to the cooking time is too much to do all at once. I make the batter up to 3 days ahead. The potatoes won't turn black if the batter is stored in the refrigerator in an air tight jar or plastic container. Just leave a bit of room at the top and completely cover with a layer of flour. When ready to cook, skim off and discard the flour. The flavor is wonderful because all the ingredients have time to blend together.

Rating: 4
Here's my mother's "Cuisinart" secret that really works: Use the shredding disk for the potatoes, drain them a bit, then put them in the food processor with the steel blade and pulse two or three times. (More makes it too mushy). Two or three pulses and you get smaller shreds, but not pureed potatoes. It really works!!

Perfect! Please note! The first time I made these latkes, I followed the directions exactly. Unfortunately, the latkes fell apartt. The second time I made them, however, I did not soak the grated potato. I simply used some paper towels to blot off the excess water. This way, the latkes held together perfectly. I'm sure the reason for this discrepancy is that I had to use all-purpose yellow potatoes, which contain less starch. Keep that in mind! Great Hanukkah recipe.

You have to add flour to this recipe, otherwise they don't stay together in the oil. You need maybe a 1/4 cup per batch and then they are fine. I also used corn/vegetable oil in lieu of olive oil. I multiplied this recipe by 7, was cooking for a lot of people.

I recommend saving some of the potato starch that settled to the bottom of the bowl after soaking the taters in water. It makes them even yummier and helps to hold them together.

Very good -- but for people worrying about the correct oil for authenticity, potatoes came from the "new world", so it's rather unlikely that Israelites would have been cooking up latkes prior to 1492!

Perfect latkes. Easy recipe.

This was a simple and delicious recipie. I only needed two potatoes to feed four generously with some left over, and hand grating just these two was a breeze. Also, using a salad spinner to get all the water out of the potatoes was a great tip, as was the one to add the remaining starch at the bottom of the bowl (this definitely helped to keep them together - i had no problems with them falling apart). Another great variation is to add scallions and bacon - delicious!!

the best latkes ! soaking is important, then draining well....make sure to pour off liquid , then add the white slurry [potatoe starch] on bottom. I used grater disc, then regular metal blade just a little to make mix a little finer.

Rating: 3
Very good. I'd never made latkes before, so the first round of four didn't come out so well, but then I got the hang of things. So here's my take on the big water controversy: I think the recipe only says to soak them because potatoes turn burn if left exposed to the air when cut. If it takes a while to grate them, soaking might be in order. It is an extra step to squeeze them, but not a ridiculously difficult one. Also: when you add salt to vegetables you cause an imbalance that ends with water coming out of the cells into a big ol' puddle. Now, adding salt tastes good, so the only way I've been able to combat the inevitable puddle formation is to squeeze the potatoes really well before putting them into the frying pan. Anyway: it's simple and good so make it if you're a waif like me who hasn't got family recipes.

Rating: 4
Great and easy recipe. We followed it pretty closely, assuming two large potatoes were about one pound, and using half an onion. Both went into the food processor; easy and for our purposes I would never grate by hand again. Skipped the "soak in water" step, seemed unnecessary. About 4 mins per side in olive oil. Result was great, certainly best latkes we ever made.

I have not made this exact recipe, but one very similar that made larger latkes, and many less. I beat my egg in a large bowl and added salt, pepper, and chopped green onions. Then, once finished with the by-hand grating of the potatoes, I squeezed out the excess moisture over the kitchen sink (using clean hands) before adding them to the egg mixture. I used russet potatoes, no potato starch, and they held together wonderfully and were delicious. Also, very little kitchen clean-up!!!

This recipe was more like hash browns than a true latke. I was not overly impressed. If you are going to go through the effort, make sure you grate the potatos fairly small. The resulting grind on my cuisinart was not good enough, I had to chop them further.

This was my first attempt in making latkes. My lil' sis brought home a really nice man for the holidays (this may be mister right!) and I wanted him to feel welcomed so I searched and searched for a latke recipe and decided this one would be it. They were easy to make..just wished i had doubled the recipe..next time. I served them on an antique pewter platter with homemade applesauce and sour cream on the side..next time, I'll buy some caviar and give the guests a choice of accompanyments. Everyone loved them. It's a keeper. (I cheated though, I didn't have a hand grater so my trusty food processor did the job) I also used virgin olive oil for the frying and made sure i only cooked 4 latkes at a time to avoid crowding them.

Yummy! My first attempt at latkes and they came out perfectly! After looking at other recipes I decided to save the starch that accumulates in the bottom of the bowl after soaking the potatoes, and then added it to the rest of the ingredients (after pouring the water off). The latkes were soooooo good!

I've been looking for a great latke recipe and I think this is the one closest to the recipe I finally came up with that I think is perfect! I shred my potatoes in the KitchenAid shredder attachment (which is amazing for shredding potatoes - I hate food processor-shredded potatoes and it takes too much time to grate them by hand) and I grate the onions by hand (no big deal for me). I also add potato starch to the mixture along with the salt.Without the potato starch these latkes didn't hold together so well, but with it, they held together amazingly well (I added about 1/4 to 1/3 cup for double or triple this recipe). I can't wait to make these again for the third time now that I've finally got a perfect latke recipe!

Great latkes - but how do you rid the house of that oily smell once it goes from a delicious aroma to a stale, greasy one? Actually, the olive oil would be more authentic as that is the oil indigenous to Israel and it was the one day's supply of olive oil that lasted 8 days and hence the miracle of Chanukah. Happy holidays!

Rating: 4
Happy Chaunkah to all! I use corn oil (more authentic than olive oil) and a tablespoon or two of matzo meal to help it hang together. You have to eat them right away, they're the best. Forget about keeping them hot in the oven! Pass the salt andpepper.

I also thought these were excellent and easy to make. I left the skins on, added the starch, used green onion and bacon according to my best friend's tastes, and she thought they were the best she'd ever had. Wringing out the excess moisture is a great tip, but I found a kitchen towel to be a messy cleanup. I wrapped them in several layers of paper towel, covering them completely in the first wrap to reduce waste or having to scrape off more of the sticky potato.
