Additional note. Do not be put off by the length of this recipe. Although there are a lot of steps in the recipe, and it is a bit time consuming (2.5+ hrs), it is quite simple. If making it for company you can easily make it the day before and reheat. It actually taste better after the flavors meld in the refrigerator overnight.

I followed this recipe to the letter. My husband and I absolutely it. The only caveat being that 1/2 teaspoon of oregano in the tomato soup is just too much. I had a sneaking suspicion when making it, but wanted to trust and follow the recipe. It just tasted a little too much like spaghetti sauce. Next time I will only use 1/4 teaspoon. But I will definitely make this again!!! I used sour cream rather than creme fraiche as my husband and I both prefer it a bit more tart with soups and savory recipes. I use creme fraiche (with a tiny bit of brown sugar) more for desserts.

Very good, but a LOT of work. And without the Serrano cream, it wouldn't have been nearly as good. Husband declared it as best soup ever...it was very tasty, but I'm left quite exhausted. The second time around should be easier. Oh, I grilled the peppers....only change.

Truly awesome! Absolutely delicious, bursting with flavors and a beautiful presentaion! I would definitely make it again (We substituted Greek yogurt for the creme fraîche and used a little bit of sour cream to thicken the Serrano -Jalapeño in our case- cream.)

This is the best tomato soup I have ever had. Don't skip the cream as it is an essential part of flavoring the soup. Preparation is not as daunting as it looks, I found it to be a fairly easy recipe. My 5 kids all loved this and so I will make it often

Don't skip cream sauce, it doesn't take more than a couple minutes and worth it. We served the soup with grilled cheese sandwiches--pepper jack on cheese bread--great for dipping. Great comfort food, good veggie and dairy combo!

I have now adapted this recipe into a sauce by combining the pepper & tomatoe soups cooked as one and then add a lighter cream. I use the sauce with meatballs stuffed with goat cheese & bake it, or with pasta. The sauce freezes very well, so you can make a big batch and pull out as you need. It is great! As soup or as sauce.

Made this Christmas even as the first course. I doubled the recipe and it easily served my 15 guests. Very elegant and delicious. I was worried it would not turn out looking as it is supposed to but it did and was very impressive. A fair amount of work but not hard and an easy do ahead.

Since I had red peppers on hand, I changed this to a roasted red pepper soup, and since I had a pasilla/poblano pepper, I used that instead of serrano. Also, I didn't make the roasted tomato soup, primarily because I was making this recipe for one person. The soup was absolutely fantastic! I made a few additional changes--you can find my version of the recipe, as well as photos on my blog. sweetcarolinescooking.com

I've made this soup enough times now that it doesn't seem like so much work. I make the pepper and tomato soups, freeze them without the cream, thaw them the day I plan to serve them, add the cream and heat 'em. My guests love this soup - the way it looks and the way it tastes. One of the best recipes on this site - and that's saying something.

This soup was fantastic! But set aside a couple of hours, cause it's not a quick soup by any means!!! If you have the time, it is highly recommended though. Not only does it taste great, but it looks beautiful. We served it with some smoked ribs. Since we smoked the ribs our selves, I decided to throw the tomatoes in the smoker for for an hour or so. The combination of smoky tomatoes and roasted peppers is delightful! If you don't have a smoker, you could always add a dash of liquid smoke too.

My sister made this recipe for me years ago, and I still remember it fondly. I have also made it msyelf since then. I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing. And beautiful. The two soups sit right next to each other with the cream squeezed on top. It's quite a bit of work, but if you have the time it's worth it. I would expect to pay a lot for this in an expensive restaurant. This will definitely titillate the palate and impress guests!

Really delicious. Like some reviewers I did not bother to strain the soups. To save time I did not make the cream, but doubled the garlic and added habanero pepper when making soup. I roasted the tomatoes, garlic and peppers on the gas grill and that resulted in a fabulous smoky flavor.

I made just the pepper soup and used red peppers. This is an easy recipe. Some reviewers have commented on its labor intensity. I think the most labor intensive part is straining the soup. While straining, there seemed to be a large amount of solids left...too much to waste. So, I threw them back into the blender with add'l stock, re- blended, re-strained. The straining is worth the extra time. Makes the soup silky smooth. However, in the end, I tossed what was left in the strainer into the strained soup, and the result was still smooth. The cream really makes this dish. Stirring the cold, spicy cream into the hot soup, makes the soup extra creamy and gives it a little kick. This one is a favorite of mine and my 4-year old daughter.

Rating: 0
This soup was great! I would suggest an easier and faster way to roast the red peppers is to cut them in half length wise and devein and deseed them first. I put the in a shallow pan and broiled them and then covered them with foil. I also used a variety of tomatoes -- seeding them as cutting them in halves before roasting as well. Made the process much quicker. I also used more garlic and put some in the pepper soup as well.

We made this soup with smoked ribs (See Epicurious recipe for Memphis style ribs from the Barbeque Bible), so instead of roasting the peppers, we included them in the smoker. The combination of the roasted tomatoes and smoked peppers was delicious! I forgot the lemon juice and opted to add only a dash of cream, but the flavors were great!

Delicious and visually appealing. I regret not serving this in a shallow soup bowl in order to get the full effect of the different colored soups mixing. I love the splash of Serrano cream on top. Will definitely strain the pepper soup next time...had a few blackened specks from the roasting. Well worth the effort!

The outcome is well worth the effort you have to put in for this gorgeous soup. Of course it's the most fun serving this to others and basking in the appreciation, but I've spent a quiet and enjoyable evening making it for myself also.

This soup was definitely a lot of work, but I think it's worth it. The first time I made it, I was going crazy because it took way more time than I'd anticipated. The second time, I roasted the peppers and tomatoes the day before and made the soup the day of the event. When you do this, the peppers lose a lot of juice - I added the juice to the soup, but it made it too watery and had a brown tinge to it from the juices. Then I had to mess around with the tomato half to get to the same consistency. The third time (three weeks in a row!) I roasted the peppers and tomatoes the day before, didn't use the juice from the peppers, and used a mix of evaporated milk and table cream, light sour cream, and it was perfection itself!

Rating: 4
AMAZING!! Have made this recipe so many times and every time people think i am a genius in the kitchen. I have never made the serrano cream, instead i just drizzle sour cream over the top (thinned with a little water or milk). You cannot go wrong here...some people think it is reminiscent of a stuffed pepper. Love it!!!!!

I printed this recipe a couple of years ago and finally made it for our annual neighborhood progressive dinner. It definitely has the WOW factor! Everyone was impressed not only with the beautiful presentation, but with the exceptional flavor. The only thing I did differently was to reduce the amount of heavy cream by 1/2. I doubled the recipe and I am glad I did it the day before because the scorched peppers really smelled up the house. I will definitely make this again!

I really liked this soup. The serrano cream was great. I used fat free greek yogurt instead of sour cream and it worked perfectly.

Rating: 4
One more thing- since I was trying to make this healthier- I didn't add any cream or half and half to the pepper puree- only chicken broth and it was still wonderful- the pepper cream added just enough to make it taste decadent and since I just used light sour cream, even that was not too bad!

Rating: 4
I changed this recipe significantly- I only made the yellow pepper soup- I roasted the bell peppers and peeled them, then I put them in the pot with the shallots and used herbs de provence instead of just the thyme. I added chicken broth and a bit of parsley and sea salt. Then I roasted poblano peppers and jalapenos (we like spicy stuff) and I added a bit of broth to then as well and then put them in a blender with light sour cream to make a pepper cream. I also happened to have some shrimp in the freezer so I cooked those and chopped them up for a garnish- then I tossed them with a bit of sea salt and fresh lemon juice. My husband and son said that if they had had this soup in a very expensive restaurant they would have been happy! The addition of the shrimp made it more of a meal too. I will make the recipe next time with the tomato soup- just didn't have time last night.

Another quick note -- I used half and half instead of heavy cream and to concur with previous reviewers -- the whole is definitely more than the sum of the parts!

Rating: 4
My husband said this was "the best soup I have ever eaten in my life". A couple of notes: I cut down on preparation time tremendously by using jarred pre-roasted yellow peppers and skipping the sieve. Tomatoes can be roasted a couple of days before any time you happen to be using the oven, and serranos can also be roasted by throwing them in the oven whole on a small tray with the garlic and peeled later instead of dealing with the stovetop. I skipped the lemon. Used sour cream -- if you want to avoid chunks, just throw the cream into a mini-prep or use a hand blender to make sure it is whipped smooth.

Rating: 2
I agree with many of the other reviewers regarding the level of effort involved in preparation. After 2.5 hours of roasting, sautéing, blending, and sieving (not to mention the washing) it was demoralizing to only have this bowl of soup as a result. It was certainly delicious, but I've been far more excited with soups that take half the work.

Rating: 4

Yes, it's delicious, but I'm not sure that it's worth the labor. Next time I will make one or the other (you swirl it all together in the bowl anyway). The cream is simple and adds so much.

This recipe was the high-light of my dinner party. I did not strain the soups, as I like the texture, but I think straining it would have made it a bit more refined. The soup is beautiful and delicious. The serrano cream fraiche is a must, though I found mine to be a tad salty. Other than adding a little less salt to the cream and straining the soup next time, there is nothing I would do different. There is a picture of it on my blog at nomnomnoms.wordpress.com

The soup looked great, but it took alot more time and effort than I expected. The tomato soup was preferred over the pepper. I left out the serrano cream when I served it to guests and it was still tasty. BUT the next day when I had leftovers, I added a little cream for myself -- what a difference!!

This soup was incredible! It did take a while to make, but it wasn't difficult. I used a stick blender to puree the soup and that saved some time and mess. The combination of the sweet and savory then spicy flavors was excellent. Also the presentation is great. I loved it. I didn't sieve the soups, I like the texture. I did change the recipe a bit by using 3 lbs of assorted tomatoes and roasting them with olive oil and herbs. I think it made the soup more flavorful. Also, I halved and seed the peppers before roasting, making peeling easier. Don't skip the serrano cream, it adds another texture and depth of flavor that really compliments the soups. I will definitely make this again.

OMG!!! This is the most beautiful soup and the taste is so warm comforting!! I just love this recipe. For the cream I used a roasted pablano and 2 roasted garlic cloves. I did not blend it I just mixed it together and then put it through a fine strainer. This is outstanding I would give it 10 forks if I could :)

This was a great recipe! Everyone absolutely loved it, including the picky individuals! I served it at a dinner party. Some notes on things I did differently . . .did not put soup through a sieve as I like the texture of soup that is a little thicker. I just pureed it a bit more. Still came out great. Also used jalepenos and sour cream and the cream came out delicious. The yellow pepper soup was exceptional. The roasted tomato soup tasted very fresh! Both tasted even better together.

This is very pretty. In my opinion, it didn't need the serrano cream as well, which was really spicy and overpowered the taste of the 2 soups. Better off without, I think.

Not to contradict the previous reviewer, but this soup was not quick or that simple for me to make. A novice in the kitchen, this took me well over two hours to prepare. Not a bad idea to give yourself four if you have other things going on in the house. Peeling the skin from the peppers wasn't always straightforward. Blending, straining and whisking took some time. The tomato soup was incredibly bland which I attribute to the lack of available quality produce. I ended up using a fair amount of tomato paste to bring it up to par. I also recommend that no lemon be used - adding to tomato soup with cream created unpleasant flavor and aroma. Aside from that, when complete the soup was a big hit at my dinner party and exceptionally delicious.

To beginners: I am no good cook but this recipe was (even though time consuming) veeeery easy and the review I got was: 'I have never had anything good like this in my life' My picky boyfriend loved it! Pointer: Watch out that the yeallow peppers remain as yellow as possible when roasting - this way you will avoid that dirty look even though it was still awesome in taste. Three Serano Chilis are perfect and not too much and use Creme Fraiche cause it comes out perfect. I used Double Devon Cream for the soup. Delicious!!!

The pepper soup is fantastic. I used 2 cups of broth instead of 1 1/2 cups to get it to the right consistency. I also made two types of creme fraiche - one following the recipe, the other replacing the serrano peppers with basil. Both were great. I highly recommend this recipe!

I just made this recipe as a 'test run' for my annual Valentine luncheon. The reviewers were not joking about its dirtying every pot and pan in the kitchen! This is a wonderful recipe that is as delicious as it is beautiful, though. I didn't think either soup was spectacular on its own, but together and with the serrano cream - wow! When I make this again, I will slice the yellow peppers in half and remove the seeds and ribs before roasting. It was quite a mess trying to remove them as instructed in the recipe. I also will let the peppers steam in the plastic produce bag to eliminate one bowl from the clean-up. Otherwise I won't change a thing.

Rating: 2
Two forks because the serrano cream became thick,hard chunks on top of the soup. This must be a result of using the sour cream substitution for it. The other flavors were great and the serrano gives a just the right touch of heat. Still floating hard chunks of dairy is not very appetizing. It was an impressive dish besides this, but enough to warrant the extra work? For me, no.

My family all thought that the tomato soup portion was outstanding, I will be making it again. For a more rustic soup I may not force through a sieve. You will only need to make a small portion of the serrano cream to have enough.

This is a gorgeous soup that never fails to impress. It can take some time to make it but I make each of the soups ahead of time and at my own pace. I cut back a bit on the amount of chilies but I caution not to omit them altogether. They add a nice kick to the dish. The colors alone are worth the price of admission.

This is a great recipe, the only bad thing about it is the fact that it can get a little messy and time consuming, but it really is worth it in the end. And don't leave the serrano cream out, it adds a great punch to the flavor of the soup.

I've started making this, two days before the dinner party. Three questions for someone who has made it before: 1) The Serrano peppers don't get roasted, right? I ask because the last line in the paragraph on roasting the peppers mentions how to handle the chilies. 2) Has anyone served it cold? I think I might... 3) I used seven good sized yellow peppers, but after roasting and chopping I had just over 2 cups, compared to the 6 (?!) that they say I should have. Typo somewhere? Comments? Thanks in advance if anyone replies...

Amazing soup...months later, people are still talking about it. It's a lot (I mean a LOT) of work, but the end flavors and presentation make it worth while. I agree with the other reviews, you will in fact use every bowl, pan and appliance in your kitchen, so make sure to allocate appropriate clean-up time if you're expecting company. All-in-all this is a great recipe - definitely restaurant quality.

I made this soup for our New Years party 2005. As I prepared a multi course dinner, I started with the soup the night before and refrigerated it as instructed. My 22 month daughter absolutely loved it! Needless to say, the soup was extremely well received by our guests, they complimented the evening to be "CUISINE", but highlighted that the soup was out of this world. Thank you for the recipe! It does take time to prepare but the work is well worth the effort. Maybe next time I will make two batches and freeze one. Thanks again for such an amazing recipe!

My husband described this soup as 'more than the sum of its parts'. Our friends were licking their bowls, and there was much moaning and groaning in culinary delight when I served this soup at our annual New Year's Eve multi-course meal. Between roasting the peppers and tomatoes it is very time intesive as two soups are being made simultaneously. The time is 100% worth it. The tang of the yellow peppers, the rich flavor of the tomatoes, and the heat of the serrano cream compliment each other perfectly. I think that both soups could served separately, but why? This is the most gorgeous, impressive soup I have ever made. My husband has requested that I make a double batch, and freeze it so we can eat it as often as possible. Make this soup. Make it now.

I made this soup for the first time today, and prepared it exactly as written. It was superb! My husband and I both loved it, but more surprisingly, so did all four of our kids. With six people, it's almost impossible to find a recipe that's interesting enough to please the adults, but not too weird for the kids. We've found it! The tomato and bell pepper soups are both simple and excellent, with very pure flavors, and smooth, creamy textures. The serrano cream adds a good deal of heat if you use a lot of it, but virtually none if you only use a light drizzle. This soup is healthy and filling, and the presentation is as cool as any I've ever seen in a restaurant. This is a new staple for us; I only wish I could give it five forks.

I made this for friends last night and it was absolutely incredible. It was my first soup (what a one to start out with!) and while it very time consuming, it was easy and fun to make. My friends were so impressed with the presentation and they raved about the taste! My one mistake was that I thought the cream sauce was too thick so I thinned it by adding cream, however that backfired when I drizzed it over the soup and it sunk because it was too dense. Stick to the recipe and you should be great. I agree with a comment made by another chef--I would seed and split the peppers first and then broil in the oven, rather than blacken them over an open flame and then seed.

Fabulous taste and presentation! And I guess I'm going against the grain but I didn't think this soup was that much work. I roast peppers all the time for antipasto so that step was pretty easy to me (my method is a bit different from the one given.) I also seeded and skinned the tomatoes before roasting them. I then used my stick blender to puree both soups and didn't bother sieving them; the texture was fine. I also substitued fresh basil for the dried oregano in the tomato soup and fresh tarragon for the dried thyme in the pepper soup. I'm thinking of trying this in the summer w/ both soups served cold.

I have made this recipe for Thanksgiving nearly every year since it first appeared. I've served it in South America, the Caribbean, and Eastern Europe. It is a spectacular introduction to this special meal to people from very diverse cultures. All love it. The distinct flavors of the roasted peppers and tomatoes complement one another, and the cream is a colorful contrast and a surprise flavor. I always dread the labor (especially when serving a large group), but the result is worth it.

I'm so suprised at how people change this recipe by either only making the tomato soup or switching the yellow peppers to red. The best part about this pairing is the Yellow Pepper soup. The roasted flavor of the Yellow pepper is really different from Red pepper soup (which I also love) I think I would go without the cream in the tomato soup; it reduced the color and the flavor too I think. The lemon juice in both of these is great combination to the potentially overpowering roasted garlic flavors. I will make this soup religiously from now on.

This was an elegant first course to my dinner party.

I can't believe I found this recipe! In 1996, my sister-in-law and I thought maybe we'd become caterers & decided to practice on our spouses. We didn't understand the strategy of NOT choosing a menu in which all recipes require last-minute cooking & detail work, so we gave up the idea. However, this soup, which was our starter course, was absolutely fabulous, looked beautiful and was great as leftovers too. The three components are delicious individually & gorgeous together. I had forgotten it was a Gourmet recipe, so had never looked for it here. Yay!!!!

I have only made the tomato soup part of the recipe, but have done so several times. It always gets rave reviews, and since most of it can be made ahead, it's not as much work as you'd think. I recommend reducing the oregano slightly and adding a generous amount of dried basil. And definitely, it is worth it to pass the pureed tomato soup through a sieve, that gets rid of most of the skin, and really does make a difference in the texture of the soup. Not hard or time consuming to make; but consider making most of it a day ahead and reheating. Excellent.

I agree with everyone else.......this is a gorgeous and delicious soup! Time consuming, but worth it, and it can all be done in advance. One tip about roasting peppers....do it on the barbecue grill. Set on high, cover, and turn them every 5-10 minutes. They cook evenly and quickly. Also, I did not find it necessary to strain the yellow bell pepper soup.......I used a chinois (fine strainer) and found it made the soup too watery. It was fine and very smooth unstrained. The soup also freezes very well, another plus!

Not much more I can add to other reviews other than it really is an exceptional soup. I was very time consuming.

I make this soup every Christmas, but make the pepper soup with green peppers instead of yellow as per a previous rater. Beautiful and festive! I also use lots of sweet baby tomatoes, as I think they are so much more flavorful than their larger cousins--it makes for a DELICIOUS tomato soup. I, too, agree the color can naturally end up a little flat. This may be a major faux pas given the 'gourmet quality' of the soup, but I have to admit I add a few drops of food coloring (red for the tomato, green for the green pepper) to each soup to boost the presentation. It definitely makes for a more striking contrast.

If you only make the tomato half you are missing out on an exciting presentation. The two soup colors juxtaposed lift this way out of the ordinary. The colors are cheerful, bright and beautiful when you place them in front of your guests. It's such a treat to go from tasting one soup to the other, and I really love the serrano cream garnish. Try to make each soup the same consistency for best results. I think this is one of the most "gourmet" recipes on this site, both in terms of fresh flavors and presentation.

amazing! after reading the reviews i considered making only the tomato soup. glad i went ahead and made the roasted pepper soup too. both are delicious and the serrano cream is the perfect compliment to both. wouldn't change a thing and will definitely make again. the presentation is ideal for company.

After reading reviews and seeing the price of yellow peppers this time of year, I opted to only make the tomato part. No regrets here, this soup was fabulous. I really really dislike tomato soup, at least the kind in a can, but decided to try it anyway, with a fear of serving a spaghetti sauce type soup to my guests. I should have served it with a hearty bread and skipped the main course, everyone loved it and one guest nearly licked his bowl clean. Would definitely recommend the serrano cream, it added a nice spiceness to the soup, was very easy to make, and made the presentation gorgeous. Will definitely make this again in tomato season and triple or more the recipe size - doubling barely served 8. No leftovers!

I love this recipe, but find it overly time consuming, so I've taken to making only the tomato part of the soup. It's absolutely delicious on its own with the serrano creme fraiche. In order to make enough for it to be worth the time I usually double, if not triple, the recipe. Great with crusty sourdough!

Sublime. I served it as a 1st course and got raves. Passing it through a fine seive makes all the difference. Suggestion: due to the prep time, make a day ahead and reheat in bain marie.

This is a very time consuming and expensive soup, but absolutely worth it. I'll make it again.

Made this soup for a special family occasion - everyone raved! Having read previous reviews, I have some suggestions: use only the reddest, ripest tomatoes (it's worth buying the more expensive ones at the store)- this will enhance both flavor and color. Instead of simmering with 1 1/2 cup broth, I simmered with 3 cups & did not need to add broth at the end to thin the soups. Consistency was even and perfect. I roasted elephant garlic & got a more mellow flavor than with straight, raw regular garlic (for both tomato soup and cream); finally, I used Mexican cream (buy at Latino groceries)- for a more complex flavor than sour cream.. the result was spectacular... Will make this again and again and again....

This soup is really without peer. I have made this recipe three times; it has been incredible twice. Twice I made it according to the recipe and it was marvelous. Once I tried it with commercially prepared peppers and it wasn't so marvelous. Commercially prepared peppers leave too much of the skin on and render the soup bitter. Otherwise, I find it well worth the effort - and easier with each preparation. It has become a family holiday tradition.

I'll make it again, but only if I have lots of time. The vegetable preparation is easy enough but time-consuming. It's a sophisticated dish but simply not worth my time for it to be in my "cook it often" repertoire.

Made this as a first course for New Year's Eve. Everyone raved. The presentation was also delightful (three colors). I used jalapenos with store bought creme-fraiche. Prepared the soup in the morning and re-heated it for dinner. You have to try this!!!

Wow, this soup looks and tastes wonderful. I'm not a tomato soup lover, so I just made a batch of red pepper soup using the same seasonings as the tomato soup recipe and a separate batch of the yellow pepper soup. Served it in black bowls and my guests loved it.

this soup is the best. Nothing else needs to be said about it. :)

i don't think i would try this again. I did not have the success other reviewers had. The tomatoes took at least 3 times as long to get to desired color/consistency. by that time i think the garlic got over-roasted. I don't know if it is because i have a single oven & therefore had 2 trays of tomatoes in same oven or maybe it had to do w/ the actual tomatoes i used. I loved the serrano cream but didn't understand how it went w/ the soup- that part didn't work for me. I thought the soup was tasty but overall too much labor for end result.

the colours and flavours of this soup is wonderfully brillant. i felt this dish was easy to make. to save on time, put the tomatoes in the oven at the same time as the peppers. when you take the peppers out turn down the oven temp. for the tomatoes.

Wonderful recipe. Beautiful and delicious. Not easy but worth the effort. Used fat free half and half instead of cream and fat free sour cream. Still was rich to me and I saved a ton of calories.

This is NOT something that you come home from work and throw together. It is a very time consuming recipe however it is delicious. You would think that the contrast between the red tomatos and the yellow peppers would be significant but it is not. My tomato soup was a pale pick and my pepper soup was a dirty yellow, when poured side by side it was difficult to tell which one I was eating. One day I will have some extra time and make it again.

I first made this soup for a gourmet luncheon in 94, that is the only time I have made both soups. Since then I have made the tomato soup numerous times, only in fresh tomato season and it is to die for. I like a little more cream than it calls for. A large sieve makes the job much easier.

Really amazing! Flavors of the two soups blended beautifully and the serrano cream topped it all off. How great the soup was all everyone could talk about the next day. Not sure what the one reviewer meant when saying there wasn't much of a color contrast... yellow/red? A definite keeper, plus the serrano cream makes a wonderful dip for veggies and chips.

Although the color contrast between the two soups wasn't as great as I'd expected, the flavors were delicious.

I substituted red peppers and just made the pepper soup - it was wonderful and our guests raved about it. It was however extremely time consuming (we served it to 12 people) rather expensive, but it made a beautiful presentation for our special occasion.

I substituted green bell peppers, to make this a green and red soup for Christmas- it was totally delicious (and much less expensive). Fantastic presentation!

My husband and I both loved the tomato soup, I still have not tried the pepper but plan to soon. The tomato is easy to make, and delicous. The only thing I didn't do was push through the sieve, it wasn't necessary after the blending.I did add fresh finely chopped basil to the soup and that made it even better!! ;o>

I have served this soup more times than I can count. People are always amazed. It looks fabulous and tastes delicious!

I have used this recipe twice and am just about to prepare it again. Perfect for an entree for an Australian winter lunch. I have found I needed to double the quantities to serve 8 people, as the recipe only serves 4/5 people.

This soup is very labor intensive, but a real show stopper: both beautiful and delicious. I've served it twice and both times have had raves.

A dramatic presentation to be sure. Both soups complement each other well. The roasted tomato soup was a litle difficult to thin to the same consistency as the roasted yellow pepper soup. I was concerned that the two soups would blend together rather that sitting side-by-side, but it worked the very first time. I served this dish for the first course of a Valentine's dinner party that my wife and I gave with two other couples. The amount was perfect for the six of us.
