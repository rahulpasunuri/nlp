I'm sure this is very delicious, but I rated it 1 fork only because of its high sugar content and overall high calorie count. Each serving out of 4 servings has 443 calories, and that's just using 3/4 cup raisins plus 3/4 cup dried cranberries. I didn't even count yet the sliced almonds, yogurt, milk or whatever else a normal person might want to add. So yes, it's yummy but if you're watching your calories, just make it an occasional treat.

This was good for weekend brunch but not exciting enough to make the cut to feature in my box plus too much fiddling and many pots for every day.

Excellent recipe...tweaked it a little to have for dinner, but never thought of it for breakfast. I used my Thai Lime marinade, green apples, nectarines, strawberries, pinch of cilantro, red peppers and green onions. You can play with all different ingredients and spices, really good left over too, if you don't make it too syrupy. It was an excellent addition to my Thai Lime Chicken. Also liked another reviewer adding yogurt or half water and half milk.

Delicious, easy, and cheap. I used whole wheat couscous to up the fiber and found the result very filling. Definitely a flexible recipe - I look forward to playing around with different fruit/spice combos in the future.

I mixed the cooked couscous with low fat vanilla yogurt, fresh blueberries and sliced almonds instead of the fruit compote. Yummy

This turned out a lot better than I expected! The only substitution I made was using quinoa instead of couscous, since that's what I had on hand. I would def. recommend adding in the nuts -they tend to break up the flavors a little and give it more dimension.

This is an awesome breakfast. I make the couscous with a cup of water and 1/4 cup of milk. I also add nutmeg, and skip the tea bag. I disagree with the other reviewers who say the nuts are too much - they give it an awesome crunch (I usually use walnuts instead of almonds though). Also, don't skip the lemon. It doesn't make it taste lemony - just brightens up the other flavors.

Honestly, I think adding nuts is a bit too much - but this breakfast is delicious! Great for a weekend, and if you skip the compote, the couscous with milk can stand on its own for a yummy weekday breakfast.

This is delicious! The best part is that it is so easily customizable to each person's taste. I use dried cherries, cranberries, apricots, 1/8 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and a chai tea bag for the compote. I usually skip the lemon juice. I make this at least once a week for a tasty, healthy breakfast.

I make a breakfast meal similar to this every weekend I have couscous on hand, but I enjoy all types of shortcuts in the kitchen. To keep it quick and easy, I bring a saucepan of water to a boil, then add equal part couscous and turn the heat to low. After the couscous has absorbed all the water, I add a pad of butter, salt, dried fruits (and crumbled mixed nuts if I have them on hand), then a touch of maple syrup, brown sugar, and maybe a sprinkle of cinnamon if I want a little added flavor. It takes about 5 minutes start to finish and it is warm, hearty and delicious. My boyfriend shudders at my "overuse" of couscous (and vegemite) but I could eat it everyday. It is a simple food fit for the gods, a blank canvas for your imagination and tastes, so experiment and enjoy.

This was definitely a great way to start my day!! Other than some trail mix and dried currants, I only really had fresh fruit on hand, but that worked perfectly well (apples, raspberries, grapes, dates). I also threw in some cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves in the syrup, definitely a goo dtouch. First time I've had couscous in the morning, but I will definitely make this again.

Ding ding! This is EXCELLENT. I just made a double batch and did 3 different things: 1. Used a carton of College Inn Thai Coconut Curry Broth (32 oz) instead of water for the compote broth 2. Used two 6 oz packages of Planters Trail mix (which has dried fruits and nuts 3. After I toasted the dry couscous, I just threw in the liquid compote (nuts and all), let it sit about 10 min, fluffed, and ate! Hopefully I won't eat all of it before my husband gets home tonight!

Very very tasty. I made it with Splenda brown sugar substitute since I'm watching sugar and added a quarter cup of apple brandy to the compote while it cooked... wow. This went straight into the fridge in separate containers, both the couscous and the compote -- sure beats drive-through breakfast on the way to work!

What a pleasant surprise! I can't wait to make this for my husband - deeelicious. We will add this to our breakfast repetoire. I served this with a cup of warm milk on the side with a touch of vanilla and cinnamon to round the meal out with a little protein. I ended up drinking the milk since I thought the texture of the couscous was better with out it. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves to the fruit capote for more depth of flavor, and cut back the sugar to 1 tablespoon dark sugar + 1 tablespoon on agave. If anything, I will cut the sugar back more to suit may tastes next time I make this.

I will admit, I only used the ingredients of this recipe. I changed the cooking process a lot! As a busy mom, I don't have time for 2 pots on the stove in the morning. I steeped the dried fruit in a bowl with the teabag and boiling water from my kettle. I cooked the couscous using the recipe, but but used the water from the fruit plus any additional boiling water needed. I used just raisins as my dried fruit. I eliminated the sugar, but stirred in some chopped bananas and a little homemade applesauce. A drizzle of warm milk made it extra yummy. Skies the limit with possibilities for this one!
