This recipe was very good, but I used skirt steak and let it marinade overnight. Only changes I made was I use Olive not vegatable oil and I added minced garlic and salt and pepper. Meat was tender and flavorful. Paired it with rice and fruit. Great summer bbq dinner.

one thing to think about is, if you go to a nicaraguan restaurant, they use cuts of meat that are 1/4 inch or thinner. you get much better flavoring that way.

The citrus marinade did not empart much flavor to the steak. It would do well using pork.

The reviewer below was right. The marinating did nothing to improve the flavor. Instead I ended up with a wet steak which did not crisp as well under the grill. Perhaps the lemons and limes we get up here are not tangy enough to create the desired effect.

Despite the marinating, the citrus flavor was barely noticeable in the finished product. There are definitely better steak dishes within these pages.

This recipe was a sure winner with my family. The only thing I changed was that I added a dash of garlic/parsley salt to each steak prior to cooking. Another winner!Thanks!
