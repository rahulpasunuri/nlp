I've made this before following the recipe (more or less with the oil and spice amounts, I usually do this to taste.) Tonight I roasted the marinated chickpeas at 350 for about 25 minutes while I chopped the vegetables. They got slightly crispy and tasted delicious. It's definitely something to keep in mind if I have a little extra time.

Great and really easy also. I added some chopped red pepper I had to use up. Even my toddler loved it--she surprised me by eating a whole half pita filled with this for lunch! Will be making this again and soon!

I love this recipe. It has been in our regular rotation for about 2 years now! So easy and yummy and healthy- can't go wrong.

I made the bean portion of the recipe, and served it with cucumber, feta and red onion on the side for people to mix in however they liked. It was great with some cilantro chutney, too. Wonderful leftovers for my lunchbox.

Delicious! I greatly reduced the amount of oil and vinegar, which upped the spice flavor. Don't skip the yogurt, it adds a great level of complexity. I'm printing this out to be made again soon!

This is so yummy! The first time I made it, I served the chick peas in pitas as suggested, but they got all soggy and fell apart. The taste was delicious, so I tried again. The second time I halved the olive oil and vinegar, but kept the full amount of spices and served it over quinoa. This was perfect. This makes a great salad that keeps well for a day or two. Very refreshing, and excellent when it's too hot to cook.

Great flavors and easy to put together with ingredients that are staples in my summer kitchen! I confess, I did not make the pitas and kept it as a side salad. I had inadvertantly left the chickpeas marinating in the dressing for 4 hours. I had used the suggestion of mixing my own cumin, coriander, etc. When I came back to them I almost inhaled them as the flavoring was so intoxicating to me! I made this recipe twice. First mixing all of he bean salad ingredients with romain and topping with the feta cheese. It was okay, but my favorite way was to make this a bean side salad without the lettuce, leaving the beans to marinate for several hours or even overnight before adding the rest of the ingredients and skipping the pitas and yogurt altogether. I am never happy with the dried up pitas available in my stores. Even the feta cheese was optional in my book. In fact I am waiting for the rest of the marinated beans to come to room temp so I can add the fresh veggies and have it for lunch again today! Marinate the beans and add the fresh ingredients to suit the amount of beans you have leftover. Great summer salad! This one definitely stays on my list of summer salads!

Add 1 tsp of honey to dressing to cut acidity. After tossing chickpeas with dressing, microwave for 45 seconds, just to slightly soften the beans. Grill the pita and spread with thin layer of greek yogurt. Added chopped lettuce, red pepper, and had no tomatoes. Very good! Did make way too much dressing, reserve for additional meals, or make half as much - There will still be some extra.

Excellent dish. Like many, I used a little less oil. I also love the cumin flavor so used a little bit more cumin than coriander. Very easy for me to take to work and eats well hot or cold.

This was delicious. Used way less oil and more spices than called for, and served it over lettuce with the Moroccan-spiced cold tomato soup on Epicurious. Also substituted cilantro for parsley as a personal taste thing. The leftovers were even better the next day... great summer meal on a hot evening.

Very tasty for lunch and easy to prepare.

Nice light summer fare. If you want the Morrocan flavor to come through stronger, use less vinegar and oil (there is more than necessary anyway) , so the spices come through. Also use a high quality vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. so their taste stands out as well. I would also recommending lightly salting and draining the cucumber and tomato for awhile before mixing themwith the garbanzos to keep the mixture from getting to watery if you won't serve it immediately.

I also halved dressing (and only used a portion of that). Used full amount of spices plus kalamatas. Placed a romaine leaf in whole wheat wrap, then bean mixture (well drained). Delicious!

I halved the dressing recipe, and tossed the whole mixture with 2 heads of romaine lettuce and served it as the salad course for a Moroccan dinner. It was delicious! I served Naan (bread) on the side - it made a big hit.

This is a delicious summer meal which requires no stovetop, oven or grill! Because others had commented on the oiliness, I strained the beans through a fine sieve after they marinated in the oil & vinegar but before adding the rest of the veggies and cheese. I then reserved the strained off oil so that people could add to taste. That worked perfectly and everyone commented on how tasty it was. I also doubled all the spices for some extra bite.

You can substitute rice vinegar for the white wine vinegar. There is a lot of dressing, but remember to put only as much to coat and reserve the rest to top the pitas. The salad could need more the next day. I skipped the pita and yogurt and made the salad for the full meal.

I made this recipe exactly as it reads and agree with previous reviewers that it calls for way too much dressing. The pitas fall apart and it feels greasy for what is otherwise a healthy meal. If I make this again, I would add a little bit of honey or sugar to curb the acidity of the dressing and I would serve it over plain cous cous or salad.

I made this recipe substituting marinated tofu for the feta and I chopped each chick pea in half (my husband doesn't like chickpeas) and he loved it! Try it in a whole wheat wrap! I'm making another batch right now to take to the girls at work. I have been craving this ever since I made it last time! Very adaptable. You can use lemon juice instead of the vinegar for a really great zing! I wish I'd made it when I first came across the recipe months ago! Try adding some olives or sweet red pepper. I don't bother with the yogurt.

I've made this many times and never tire of it. I don't particularly care for parsley, so I usually omit it, and I usually use less EVOO than suggested. A very forgiving recipe; handles changes and substitutions very well.

Rating: 3
I have made this many, many times now and it is great. The only changes I have made are to double the amount of spices in the dressing as well as doubleing the dressing and serving the extra on the side (so there is 4X the amount of spice per single recipe)

Spicy and so flavorful! I omitted the cucumber (too watery) and did not serve with yogurt/pita. Rather, I served over bulgur for a perfect take-to-work lunch and topped the salad with feta. Easy ingredients are always on-hand, so I will definitely be making this again!

I love this recipe!! It is absolutely perfect to bring for work-day lunches. The dressing keeps very well, and the flavor improves with time. I've been eating it all summer, and crave it on the days I don't have it. The key is top-quality ingredients--fluffy pitas, fresh tomatoes and cucumbers. I find European (seedless) cucumbers have better flavor for this dish. I recommend using St. Vikos feta, a goat and sheep blend--very creamy, less salty and much more moist than store-basic fetas.

We didn't like this. Flavor was strong and used only some of the dressing and it was still too wet.

Very tasty! I just used za'atar instead of "moroccan spice blend." Would also taste fine if you didn't have any feta on hand.

This was a very tasty little dish, even though I didn't have many of the ingredients. I heated the garbanzo beans and then added the vinaigrette (made much less than called for as the other reviews suggested, and used garam masala), tomatoes, and feta. I had to leave out the cucumbers, onion, and parsley, but I'm sure it would be great with all of those ingreds and I plan to make this dish again with them. Instead of pitas I poured the mixture over a bed of lettuce and it was delicious! It slightly wilted the lettuce leaves because it was warm. I think the vinaigrette might get absorbed some if this sits overnight.

I have made this dish for my friends and they all rave and say it is restaurant quality. I only make half the vinagrette and add in a bit extra of each of the spices.

Rating: 3
Great summer dish. It made too much "vinagrette" for my liking--I'd only make a third as much next time. Heating up the chickpeas would also be a nice addition (to get them a little soft). Will definitely make this again.

I was trying to remember a garbanzo salad my mother used to make when I found this recipe. I actually omitted the pita altogether and instead served it in the big bowl as a side dish ... everyone loved it.

Rating: 3
Very good summer dish. We enjoyed the flavour, though the dressing caused the pita to fall apart almost immediately. Messy, but good.

This is a great summer recipe, especially when you brush the pitas with olive oil and grill them before you stuff them with the salad. I also added kalamata olives but omitted the yogurt.

Refreshing, great summer food. Not too daring, but this little pita wins points for flavor. Even so, next time I'll add a little more spice.
