this was just ok. i think slicing the bananas and tossing them with some choco. chips would be better.

This is fabulous and extremly easy. First time working with the filo and it will take some practice. I followed the advice and put some cinnamon and sugar on the banana. I also used a combo of peanut butter chips and chocolate chips. Out of this world. Even re-heated the next night, they got even crispier and flakier! YUM!

Quick suggestion/idea: try sauteeing the bananas, sliced length-wise, briefly in a little butter, sugar, cinnamon, and other spices that you desire. Be sure not to cook it too much or it'll get mushy! Cool before proceeding with recipe. The caramelized bananas are perfect with the chocolate filling!

Easy to make as individual servings--I used about 6oz semi-sweet chocolate chips for 8 individual banana "logs." Used one phyllo sheet folded in half per person/banana; melted the chocolate chips w/a little cinnamon and cream for 30 seconds in microwave just until melted. Spoon about 2-3 Tbs of chocolate on the banana; fold phyllo to make individual logs. I even made them 3 hours before serving...stored them on my silpat/cookie sheet in the fridge with a wet towel on top to keep the filo from drying out. Took them out right before baking and put on the egg wash. Delicious!

Wow! What an awesome dessert! Took the suggestions of others and used semi-sweet chocolate chips - who doesn't have them on hand! And, I also do not think this dessert is sweet enough to warrant bittersweet chocolate. Next time I will chop the chips a bit (so they melt more) and add toasted walnuts! Yum! Also, will cut bananas in half, sprinkle with chips (and walnuts) and top with other halves so that the melted choco stays in the middle. As for the bananas, do ensure they are not too firm! Also - whipped cream good, ice cream better! Finally, serves 6? 6 what? Come on ... serves 3-4! Think about it - two bananas and four sheets of phyllo serves 6?! Puhleez!

I've made this dish twice now. The first time I experimented with using baby bananas individually baked for smaller individual portions, rubbed cinnamon on the bananas, and tried a few with bits of high quality chocolate bar, and one with Hershey's syrup. Syrup (no surprise) was too runny. The milk chocolate worked ok. The second time i used regular bananas, still trying for individual sizes, and used the bittersweet chocolate. The chocolate was too thick. It should be a creamy goo inside, not a paste. I think next time, I will stick 4oz bittersweet chocolate in a cup, melt it quickly for 20seconds, add cinnimon and maybe a tsp or two of whipped cream or milk. With a barely thinner sauce it'll be perfect.

This is so easy and so good!!! I have always used semi sweet chocolate chips because I tend to have them on hand. I'm not too sure about the bittersweet being sweet enough. This is not an overly sweet desert. The next time I make this I will try grated chocolate so the chocolate is more evenly dispersed in the filling. I find that the chips tend to roll to one side or the other of the bananas and break through the phyllo when rolling up. I agree with some of the other reviews that cinnamon sprinkled on the banana and the dusting of cocoa along with the pwdr. sugar would be a nice addition.

Great easy easy easy dish. It looks like it takes 2 hours to prepare. No one could guess that this took less then 25 minutes. I did not change anything. I added some gourmet raspberry chocolate syrup.

This was really easy and pretty tasty, but I have to agree that it is missing something. I think next time I make it I'll try some cinnamon sugar on the bananas.

This was good, I just thought that it was missing something. Of course, I'm not really food educated enough to know exactly what, but I'd make it again to experiment. Maybe my taster was just off and it will taste better to me next time.

Give this a try! Very easy, delicious and the phyllo just makes this impressive! Followed suggestions posted by previous reviewers with great success: Sprinkled sugar on bananas that were not quite ripe to bring out sweetness and dusted finished strudel with cocoa powder and powdered sugar. Used semisweet choc chips.

This was fabulous. I was a little scared doing the Phyllo thing, but all went well! My guests absolutly loved it! Great reaction to the dish. My only feedback...make two! Everyone wanted seconds and there was none left!

Boy was this tasty! I've never worked with phyllo dough before, and this was the perfect recipe to start with. My guests were pretty impressed when they saw it; little did they know how easy it was! Now that I've got the basic technique down, I will try it with strawberries, or I might even try an apple strudel!

Wonderful recipe and elegant presentation. Very easy to make. We drizzled melted chocolate on top of the strudel. We may slice the bananas next time.

I made this dessert last night for a dinner party and the guests raved. This dish is all about ease and presentation. I added an extra banana.

Easy, very tasty either with whipped cream or ice cream, looks nice, and quick to make. Try adding a few walnuts.

I hate to be a naysayer in the face of all these brilliant reviews, but I thought this was only middling. If you like the combination of bananas and chocolate (and who doesn't) it will be fine, and a real strength is that it is really quick to prepare, but in my opinion not a stunning recipe.

I literally had this totally done in 20 minutes! And it was sooooo good. Whipped some homeade whipped cream to go w/, and added xtra choc inside. Next time I would use less "firm" bananas as I thought the firm ones were too firm. Awesome Dessert!

This recipe is a hit! It is so easy to make, yet such a beautiful presentation. I added another oz. of chocolate to the strudel and dusted the plate with a combo of powdered sugar and chocolate. I will definitely make again!

Very easy to prepare and make. I added a bit of sugar inside and on top before baking, as the bananas I bought seemed a bit on the bland side. It really is a 10 minute dessert that looks like it took you hours to make.

Absolutely scrumptious! Just make sure the baking surface is amply buttered-- mine wasn't and the bottom got stuck to the cookie sheet. But it is a relatively easy recipe that will yield great results. Serve with vanilla frozen yogurt or ice cream.

Fabulous. A quick and easy dessert to make. My boyfriend demanded seconds! I would use very little whipped egg to baste the strudel with (my came out too browned).
