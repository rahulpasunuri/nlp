This is a great consistency hummus, but I definitely cut the oil by over half. I also doubled the garlic, but that's just me, and I've tried it with pesto added as well. Perfect really for lunches!

I thought this recipe was fantastic. It's so simple and comes out wayyy better than what you can find in a store. I added extra salt which brought out the more subtle flavors of sugar and cumin. This will be a staple snack in our fridge from now on!

I think this is the start of a fairly decent receipe, but it has to have tahini added.. that is must in hummas. Hummas is a nice appetizer, and it needs to have lemon and parsley added with olive oil,,,, and then add your eggplant, red pepper, etc. for flavors!

It was a nice, but not stellar hummus. I think that it's a good enough base to add roasted red peppers, tahini, eggplant, etc... to your own taste.

Hummus is new to me, so perhaps I am not the best judge of what makes for a great tasting hummus. I doubled the garlic and used a 1/4 teaspoon salt. I wouldn't go so far as to say this recipe was bland, but it didn't ignite my taste buds. I liked the taste of the lemon with the carrots I ate with it.

I agree, hummus isn't without tahini. I made this recipe as it is, and I found it pretty bland. I added another T of lemon juice, 1 T tahini, and a t of salt. It was an easy recipe, but you may as well find another that you don't need to add other ingredients to.

Real hummus needs to have at least a few heaping tablespoons of sesame paste aka tahini. Without that, it is not hummus, you have blended garbanzo beans with some seasoning.
