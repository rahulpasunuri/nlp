This was easy to make, the next time I will marinate for the full 8 hours and add some hot spice (perhaps garam masala) to the marinade. I have been looking for a reasonably fool proof rib recipe, and this is it! guten appetite!

I should have known this would not work unless you like fat filled, greasy ribs. I am up at 3 a.m. after having these ribs for dinner. It's better than the bad dreams I suffered. You have to parboil or otherwise defat ribs. I baked these for almost two hours and they were still swimming in grease.

I really like this method of preparing ribs - it's the only way I will eat them. I thought for a long time that I didn't like ribs and then realized that what I didn't like was BBQ sauce. This has a distinctive flavor and the sweetness make the ribs seem less unctuous.

Haven't tried the recipe but here's a hint: for tenderness, wrap the coated ribs tightly in foil, seam side up. Bake at 300F for 2 1/2 hours. Then put on grill, 5 min each side. I just use a good BBQ sauce from a bottle.

I liked the pineapple juice in the recipe. I ended up using the recipe as a base. I used juice concentrate with half the water content.I omitted the ketchup, adding tomato paste, 1 can cola, 1/4 cup blackstrap molasses, 1 finely chopped onion, 2tbsp cracked black pepper, and a couple of smoked chipotle peppers. It was great! Seems like Sheila's recipe could lend itsself nicely to many variations. I'm looking forward to trying....

I let the marinada simmered 2 different times, it never thicken, the flavor was too bland, I was quite disappointed.

This is truly "to die for." The marinade dresses up even the most undistinguishable road kill when you don't have the funds for spareribs.

We like the marinade but its not the best ever. I've only used this recipe once and I will make it again.
