This was delicious and beautiful to look at. It was light in the stomach so a wonderful selection just after a holiday meal. Great choice to make ahead and serve to "Wow" your guests.

This is a fantastic, unique dessert. Excellent combination of flavors - almond, lemon, orange, clove (just enough) - and not too sweet. I did the entire filling in the food processor, which made it super simple. The only thing I've had difficulty with is the top crust. I'm not an accomplished pie or pastry person, and lattice doesn't strike my fancy, so I've used one of those Nordic lattice cutters. I figure, simple, just press and voila - first time, the pretty & complex pattern worked out great. Second time, not so much. I had to use the pattern I wasn't crazy about after re-rolling the dough 3 times (I know, I know... but the crust didn't suffer too much). I suppose if I go for #3, which I probably will, because this rocks, I will get over myself and try a lattice top. I usually mess with recipes, but this is one I follow to the letter.

I'm not sure why the other reviewers weren't happy, but this was wonderful! Easy, too. I made the almond flour (50/50 finely ground almonds and flour, done in the mini processor), and the crust was great. I found that the lattice was very easy: froze the strips for a bit, then placed them on top. Once slightly softened, I actually wove the lattice. The filling was a breeze in the KitchenAid, and it tastes wonderful. As a good friend said "this tastes like Christmas in a pastry".

This looked so beautiful and I had high hopes it would be delicious - but nobody raved about it and it was just OK.

This is very good. I ran out of orange marmelade and had to mix with apricot. Trader Joes sells bags of ground almond meal in the nut section. Bob's Mills also sells almond meal but it is way more expensive. Not too sweet, not savory either, just right.
