Really fantastic. In the accompanying article in the magazine, this was described as a sort of elegant cousin to Caesar salad. I couldn't agree more. Refined but bold flavors. I sprinkled fresh chives on top for a bit of color, and left off the lemon (couldn't be bothered that time); it was still amazing. The breadcrumbs are a brilliant addition.

Very flavorful, unique treatment of the radicchio. Lemon was a waste of time, don't bother. Can't wait to use the same breadcrumb recipe with other dishes.

This was so, so good, a really unique, healthy tasting meal that felt hearty and satisfying. I loved the vinaigrette and the breadcrumbs added a nice textural complexity.
