This reads like a bad google translation from Aramaic. Don't waste your time...too many good recipes out there.

This recipe qualifies for "Give me a break!" I've made a lot of bread, but I'd only try this if I were being held prisoner in a kitchen for a week with nothing else to do. Looking at the other comments, why not just remove it?

I've had mixed success with this recipe. On a positive note, the sourdough flavor is excellent and the recipe is not that hard if you think about the process in stages. On the down side, Ive had a lot of problems with the loaves deflating. I recently ordered a banneton so hopefully my results will improve. I baked the deflated loaves hoping they would rise in the oven but they didn't, so I used them in a couple of other epicurious recipes with great results: Leek and Wild Mushroom stuffing and Maya Angelou's Bread Pudding. If you're thinking of making this bread I say give it a shot! Prepare to experiment and learn from the process, and don't be deterred by negative reports from people who didnt even bother to try the recipe.

Please help. I am willing to do whatever it takes to make this recipe work. I have followed the recipe to the letter (I think). I bought organic rye flour and am using spring water (bottled). The starter does everything the recipe says it should do but on day five it bubbles up and falls and then thats it, no more action on day six. And, I am confused about the stiff starter. Do I keep and feed this for future loaves or do I always start out with the more liquid original starter? Thanks to whomever can answer this question

I need help. not necessarily with this recipe but bread in general. My bread has been turning out just fine for the most part but I have never ever gotten my dough to pass the "window pane" test or the stretch test. Everything I read about bread baking says that the dough should stretch without breaking. What am I doing wrong?

While I did have to read this recipe about ten times before getting started, it did make a really tasty bread. Once I understood all the steps, it wasn't really that difficult. I shaped mine into two baguettes. They had a great crisp, brown crust and a fluffy, chewy inside. It had a definite sourdough taste, although my starter is only about 10 days old. I do think you need to double the salt in the recipe. I look forward to making it again as my starter ages.

OK, as most have posted, the instructions are a bit strange. It takes a bit to follow them and I found myself rereading them multiple times. The good news is that this makes some of the best sourdough bread I have ever had. It's is a slow process. I found the rise times and proofing times to be almost twice the listed. I'm sure that being in the southeast and humidity levels are affecting this. It is definitely worth the trouble.

I have to say, I'm all for slow food, and enjoying the journey of making good food, but this recipe IS very difficult to follow, the directions ARE too vague. I'm currently still maturing my starter, and have read the recipe through a few times to familiarise myself with what's going to happen next, and I can only just about follow what I'm meant to do. I'm familiar with cooking and baking terms, including bread, and don't have any trouble with my reading comprehension. There are simply too many vague references to storing starter and keeping starter and throwing out starter and it's unclear wether one part of the recipe is referring to another part or is independent in and of itself. There needs to be more distinction between sections and between the various bits of starter used/stored/discarded. I think it's clear from the number of confused reviewers that this could do with being simplified and clarified.

I have a copy of Rose Levy Beranbaum's book "The Bread Bible". I find all of her formulas to be wonderfully detailed and very easy to follow, but one cannot jump in cold. One must read the formula through first to gain a perspective of what the task is, and how the task is to be achieved. If faithfully followed, the formula produces a fantastic sourdough loaf. Flavour is as good as it gets, with superb crust and crumb. I believe a few reviewers were not fair in rating the formula, simply judging it based on opinion, or lack of reading comprehension.

This is a review of the bread made with this recipe On try number 4, I feel I now can understand this recipe and can successfully follow its instructions. Despite its fussiness, following the instructions to the letter has gotten me a superb loaf of crusty, artisan style sourdough. My first attempt was successful but I had a hard time managing my time, and the 2 times between I would deem failures due to my struggles with timing and dealing with the details of the recipe. But, now on try number 4, I am very pleased with the results. The crust is thin and crisp, the taste is excellent, and the crumb is well developed. This is just not the kind of thing that is at all easily memorized, and when I mesed up steps on previous tries I screwed up teh end results pretty well, creating dense or undercooked loaves.

To elaborate on my previous post, I have some experience with sourdough and baking bread, and this recipe is overwrought. Instructions on feeding the starter are more complex than they need be, hard to follow, shouldn't be part of the bread recipe anyway. Yes, there is pleasure in making a loaf of bread, but you wouldn't know it by reading this recipe.

This recipe is incomprehensible.

This is a review of the recipe itself: I found it extremely challenging to follow the directions -- The style it's written in, with bold being an overall description of the steps, then followed by more details about that step, was very confusing. While I do not feel one needs to be a chemical engineer for this recipe, I think it is written for a very experienced baker. I got really fed up trying to interpret some of the directions, such as when I was told to "add the water" but the amount of water I was supposed to add was listed 5 pages earlier. I do not recommend this recipe because it is extremely challenging to understand.

Some of you are missing the whole point about making a time consuming loaf of bread. It's not about needing the food but the pleasure in making something beautiful with your own hands. A rainy weekend endeavor, not during the work week.

Good things come to those who wait... after days of feeding my sourdough starter I was rewarded with a flavorful yeast alternative and starter that will last a lifetime--my bread gets better each week ;-)

Having followed the steps for 5+ days I created a wonderful sourdough starter! I now bake sourdough bread and pizza dough a couple of times a week and there's nothing like it :-) For those interested in the process of collecting wild yeast and creating unique loaves, hang in there...I'm not even an engineer ;-)

What's wrong with all you reviewers? If you want bread easily, go buy it. Fine. But don't rate this recipe based on how easy / hard it is compared to just purchasing your food. That's pretty much the opposite of what this site is about. I could say the same thing about everything: "this is way too hard, go to a restaurant and have someone else cook it, lolzers". Sheesh. Rate it instead based on how well it works. I'm starting it today, will post a real review next week.

No chemical engineer and have not made this recipe, BUT I have been baking bread 2-3 times a month for twenty+ years and I am overcome by the time required in 1-3 hour segments, mostly for the various rises. This may have been possible for a stay-at-home mom (or dad), but most of us leave home in the morning to go to work, not to return for 9-11 hours. Bottom line is this recipe is nuts for anyone who has anything else to do for the nearly 24 hours it takes.

You know, it's possible to post comments, however inane, without rating the recipe, which you clearly have not bothered to make. At least that way you don't unbalance the USER Rating.

Good grief the chemical engineer comment was dead on. I can get a good sourdough loaf at the local grocery store for $3 and an excllent loaf at a local baker for just a little more. Whey the heck would I do all this work for $3? Buy the bread and spend the time making something else you can't easily purchase.

If your are a chemical engineer, you'll love this recipe. For us average folks, it's ludicrous.
