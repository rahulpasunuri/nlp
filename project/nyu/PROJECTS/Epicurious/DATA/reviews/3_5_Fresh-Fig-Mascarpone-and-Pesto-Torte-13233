I love fresh figs and I'm happy to have a new recipe to use them in. I substituted pistachios for the pine nuts then scattered crushed pistachios on top.

Awesome! I used dried figs that I soaked for several minutes in warm water, rather than fresh, which weren't available. I baked up beautifully and was delicious. Perfect for a party where you want something a little sophisticated, but not necessarily too epicurean or labor-intensive.

This is a lovely dish and makes a beautiful presentation. I also think it is a pretty straight-forward recipe; not hard, just a few steps. I made it for a party and wanted to serve it in under three hours, so I put it in the freezer for about an hour and kept my fingers crossed. I think it turned out fine--it was firm but not too cold. I liked this much better the day I served it than a day or two later. Also, I'm not sure the toasts are necessary.

I made this recipe years ago from the Magazine recipe and it was a huge hit at the Labor Day pot luck party I brought it to. I made it a number of times with the same results. THEN my magazine collection got ruined and I used the on-line recipe - with DISASTEROUS results! I just came across the recipe again here on line, looking for ideas for the same weekend party, read the reviews and the cook from St Augustine got it. The filling is only the 1st three ingredients. The on line recipe is poorly written. Thank you St. Augustine! I'm making this again and my neighbors will be thrilled!

This was a hit. It was time consuming to make but delicious. I was nervous about the sweet/savory flavors working together but in the end they did! And yes, the Filling is only the first 3 ingredients listed!! The cream cheese, mascarpone, eggs

This was great! It came out very pretty and my guests loved it. I replaced the cream cheese with neufchatel to reduce the fat content. Also, I was out of pine nuts and white-wine vinegar, but hazelnuts and balsamic vinegar worked very nicely in a pinch.

I had this at a wedding. It was amazing. It was gone before everyone had a chance to sample. If you need to bring something, bring this one. It is a real gift!

My friend made this for me for a graduation gift and it was indeed memorable, especially served with champagne. We recommend the Veuve Clicquot. And we recommend it before dinner......or instead of it!

This was a great answer to how to use figs- an ingredient people don't utilize much. It is best at room temp - so take out of the fridge in advance. I added some prosciutto that I had- cut in tiny peices and placed on top between the figs and fig preserve- really added that extra bit of salt to the sweet for a great contrast. Don't know if it was because I used mascarpone and not sour cream - but when recipe says "pour" the filling - be warned - it doesn't "pour"- it is pretty thick and needs to be spread- carefully.

to the cook from st. augustine... you're right, recipe needs editing, but this is a lesson learned to read the entire recipe through before starting to cook...this dish is fabulous--great tasting, and incredible looking. a real winner!

Great recipe. Making the pesto fresh makes a big difference. People are always nervous about trying it, but they end up loving it. As an appetizer, this dish serves a lot - it tastes as rich as pate.

Some on needs to review the instructions for this recipe!!! The filling ingredients are only the first three items. The pesto is a layering, and the preserves and vinegar are for a sauce!!The recipe reads as if you blend all 7 things together. This I did, and did not understand my error until I had completely made the torte and put it in the oven. The end result wasn't terrible, but it sure wasn't a lovely gourmet treat either.

I made this recipe for a gal's dinner after reading the rave reviews. My first thought reading it was that the combination of flavors was quite unique. And upon tasting it, I don't think I've been convinced that they actually work together. I found it hard to eat more than a few bites of it. On a brighter note, the others seemed to enjoy it a bit more than me (but I'm not sure if they were just being nice!). Another problem: I just dont know what this should be - an appetizer, a dessert - it doesn't really fit into an overall meal very well.

I agree with another reviewer -- it took my guests some coaxing to try this torte, but once they did it went quickly and recieved rave reviews! I was short on time, so I dolloped a jar of Stonewall Kitchen's fig and ginger jam over the top, sprinkled fresh chopped figs and toasted pine nuts over it -- it was delicious! Can't wait to make it again!

I made this in the form of individual tarts for a party I catered. They were a huge hit.

Just made this for a big party this weekend and it was a great hit! Such a unique combination of savory and sweet flavors and super-easy to make. I baked it the day before and refrigerated (without toppings) until about 2 hours before the party began. The catering staff finished it off and it was so beautiful -- the preserve mixture just glistened and, combined with the sliced figs, it was the perfect autumn buffet item. It went quickly and everyone I asked about it just loved it! Seems like it would lend itself to many variations. It held together much better than the typical (unbaked) goat cheese and cream cheese tortes that are so popular and was so much more unique. Loved it and will do it again soon!

What a great appetizer! Even those who thought they didn't like figs loved this unique dish. One note: be sure to read the recipe thru'-the filling is only the the first 3 items. If you can't find fresh figs, use the pkgd ones--still look great sliced on top.

Served this as part of a holiday buffet for 75. It sat on the table for about 15 minutes until one brave soul cut the first slice and then decribed in great detail just how wonderful the torte tasted. It disappeared slice by slice (as a line of now interested people fomed behind it.) I served 16 dishes that night and I can say that I received more requests for this recipe than for any other dish I sereved. I will definitely nake again...and again..and again.

I waited too late to buy fresh figs, so I had to innovate. I used apricots, dates and red pear slices, and apricot preserves instead of fig preserves. It turned out great, but will remember to buy my figs earlier next year. It was a big hit. The pesto gives it the unique flavor.

I made this dish for an engagement and it was a huge hit! Everybody the unusual combo.

It's true that the figs on top scare away some people - but hey, that leaves more for me!! This is so good, my husband can't stop eating it even though I have never seen him eat a piece of fruit if he could help it over the last 22 years. The folks at my local store are looking at me oddly, as I keep asking them for more figs. If you could grow figs hydroponically, I would devote my entire kitchen windowsill, just to keep myself in figs for this torte. IT IS THAT GOOD! People at my last party were skipping the toasts and gobbling it up by the slice. Anyway, as far as freezing goes, I don't see why you couldn't freeze the torte sans the fresh figs and glaze - you can freeze cheesecake, after all, right? Good luck!

I also loved this recipe. Does anyone know how it freezes?

Wow! My third time making this recipe and once again it is amazing. I substituted apricot jam which worked very well.

I was looking for something a little different for a bridal shower - and this was a perfect addition to the menu! It was a huge hit and was delicious!! (I followed the recipe exactly - and for the last reviewer - the filling is the cream cheese, mascarpone, and eggs).

Am I dense? I am having a hard time telling (from the way the ingredients are listed in the recipe) exactly what to put in the mixer to make the filling. Please someone spell this out for me!

I made this for Christmas day and it was a hit. I too used dried figs, and didn't layer figs on top (didn't want to scare away any anti-fig people). My family loved it and is making it for a New Year's Eve party. Very elegant.

This was very good and not too difficult to prepare. However, I could not find fig preserves anywhere. I bought date filling and added corn syrup, sugar, and water to bring it to preserves consistency, then added the vinegar. It worked out well. Everyone at the Christmas gathering loved it. I brought leftovers to work - people here thought it was scary looking and smelled funny. :(

wow, strange but i exactly echo all the reviews before mine. bizarre combination of ingredients, but with amazing results! i was looking for a fancy, make-ahead appetizer recipe for a brunch and came across this. dubious about the figs and pesto, i tried it based on all the reviews. and, as promised, this dish was THE hit of the party! i'm not a big fig lover and even i loved this dish. everyone asked for the recipe but i'm tempted to keep this as my little secret.....by the way, i used pre-made pesto (fresh, in the refrigerated pasta sauce section at the grocery store) and thus this was easy to prepare and still delicious.

You say pesto recipe follows, but I didn't see it. I do want to try this recipe. I love horsd'oeuvres. Please e-mail me. Thank you. Hilda

Don't wait for fresh fig season to make this! I used dried figs and poured boiling water over them, letting them soak for about 10 minutes. They worked well in the recipe; which got rave reviews at a dinner party.

I had a lot of fresh figs to use, and needed something unique to take to a pot luck. I thought it very tasty and everyone raved about it. I will have no doubts about making it again next year when figs are ripe.

A surprisingly synchronous palate of tastes emerges from this disparate list of ingredients. I was nervous after making this, for although it looked beautiful, I was skeptical about how it would taste. It was the hit of the party!
