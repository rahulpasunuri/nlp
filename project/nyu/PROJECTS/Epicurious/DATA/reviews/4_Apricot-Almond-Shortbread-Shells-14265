This is going to be one of my new favorites! Very easy and delicious! I used Triple Sec since I didn't have Grand Marnier. Perfect flavor. A real keeper.

These can be filled with jam if time is short. I didn't bother with the cream. My oven hasn't been tested in awhile, but the shells were done in 13 minutes.

I made this recipe along with the almond madelaines for a party. The shortbreads were the hit of the evening. I made two batches, one of which I made with brandied cream and the other with amaretto in the cream. Both were terrific.
