We loved this dish. It is very hardy and would be perfect at a football tailgate. Its a relatively inexpensive meal for feeding a crowd. I used red beans and they were perfect. Next time, and there will absolutely be one, I will leave out the bacon. I loved the croutons!

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used red wine instead of brandy (merlot), and it turned out great. I was only cooking for 4, so I made about 2/3 of a recipe and eyeballed most of the ingredients - I had only 1 can of northern beans and 1 can of tomatoes on hand, so I added a bit more tomato paste and chicken broth and it was delicious. Very flavorful, but not overwhelming. Definitely adding to my list of favorites, and it's great as a make-ahead for a dinner party.

Love this - made for company and there's nothing left. Used 1 lb hot turkey sausage and 2 lbs chicken breasts cut in 3"pieces. Cut out the brandy, lima beans and the breadcrumbs. Used a fist full of all the herbs in our garden (Sage, Lavender, Oregano, Thyme, Sorrel). Will make again and again ;-)

This is one of our favorite winter meals! It fills the house with the most wonderful smells. We usually don't put in the Lima beans since I dont like the idea of it in french food so we just use canalloni beans instead. We also make sure to use quality bacon and sausage since it really does make a difference. Highly recommend this quick recipe though!

This was not good :( I followed the recipe exactly except that I used Ukranian smoked sausage along with Harvest sausage. I also used a bean medley instead of the Great Northern Beans. Regardless, its tasteless and pretty gross. My sister just thought that it was weird. I would not make this again.

This was the first time I've made (or eaten for that matter) cassoulet. I really liked this, but.... 4 cups of breadcrumbs? Is that normal? Maybe the problem was that I used a can of breadcrumbs instead (and only 3 cups) and it seemed excessive. But the flavors were delicious together.

This worked great for me. Easy dish to entertain with, because you can do it all ahead. I added carrots, switched out the bacon for pancetta, and skipped the lima beans. Left overs taste great.

This has quickly become one of my favorite recipes, both for fantastic flavor and ease of preparation. It is also quite possibly my husband's favorite meal ever.

Used 2 pounds of turkey kielbasa instead and used red wine instead of brandy - great Fall recipe when you want to hunker down and cook. No special techniques required. Surprised by the small number of reviews for a 2002 recipe. This was a wonderful introduction to a type of dish I had never tried.

Excellent! I cut the recipe in half, and used one half bag of small, dried white beans (soaked and cooked for one hour) The beans held their shape and texture without becoming mushy. A warming and hearty dish.

In a word, FABULOUS! This is a great tasting dinner for family or company. I made the recipe as written and its an explosion of flavor. The leftovers are even better a day or two later. Served with a merlot and Pinot Noir and both worked well. Will make this one again, and again..........

I was not as impressed with this dish as I had hoped. It seemed a little bland for all the work and the flavor of the sausage overpowered the dish. I think I might have liked it better if I had halved the sausage and added chicken, duck and shrimp instead.

Really good but makes a lot. I halved the recipe and got about 6 servings over several meals. I don't care for spicy so halved the red pepper and would use even less next time. Also, I added smoked duck which we had on hand. Flavor definitely develops over several days.

This dish was great. My husband couldn't stop talking about it. I used a kinds of smoked sausage and whatever bread I had in my freezer for the topping and dried herbs. I plan on making it for a summer BBQ instead of baked beans.

This is to die for!! I have made it several times at my boyfriend's request. I make the chicken stock from scratch. Then use the chicken from that. Also, use diced tomatoes with roasted garlic,a couple cloves,and make garlic croutons for the topping. I have tried different sausages. The best is half Andouille and half Ukrainian sausage.

I made this for a Sunday evening Christmas gathering and everyone raved about it! It was quite simple to make, although I eliminated the breadcrumb topping.

Simple to make and quite good. Being able to make it up to two days in advance is a big plus. Lots of compliments and requests for the recipe. Not really cassoulet but a very good choice for a winter buffet table.

Having never tasted any cassoulet before, I found this dish to be tasty and quick. The canned Great Northern beans just mushed up after finish simmering for so long, but it made the broth richer and tastier. I eliminated the bread crumb topping (too much work) but served them with plenty of crusty bread. It freezed well too. I used turkey kielbasa to cut on fat. Perhaps next time I'll use dried white kidney beans instead of the canned ones.
