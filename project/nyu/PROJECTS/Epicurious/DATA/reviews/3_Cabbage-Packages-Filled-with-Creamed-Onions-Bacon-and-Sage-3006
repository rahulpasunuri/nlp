I didn't make this recipe but I had the delightful little packages at a bridal shower. I came to this website to get this recipe and check out others. Thanks for the recipe.

I made these for a bridal shower for my sister. They were incredible and a huge hit with the ladies. A special touch is to tie the packages shut with a chive. This makes for a wonderderful presentation. Although time consuming they are relatively easy to make, taste wonderful, and look impressive.

The filling was VERY rich and although the sage and bacon combo was tasty, it overpowered everything on the plate. The cabbage was difficult to cut and ended up kind of stringy.

Liked this recipe, but one thing I tried (works with cabbage rolls too) is instead of boiling the cabbages (which is simply to soften them enough to allow you to fold them) is instead to place the heads of cabbage in the freezer until frozen through and then to allow the cabbage to defrost. This wilts the leaves the same as boiling them would, and since you are baking the packages anyways, this also eliminates overcooking. Obviously this requires a bit of forethought, having to put them in the freezer, but I keep a cabbage in the freezer for just such a time and take it out in the morning to use for that eve or the next day. Just a thought.

Absolutely fabulous. Served this and the above potatoes with a very slowly braised pork shoulder and the results were great. Makes a great presentation and a greater meal.
