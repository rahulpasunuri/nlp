We have diver Scallops available this time of year and this recipe is perfect. I think I would omit the basis puree next time. Not sure why you blanch the basil since it did not hold together or add much since it calls for fresh basil. Pesto would work well though.

This is one of my favorite recipes to make use of the abundant produce at the market in the summer. Use high quality scallops (get dry if you can) and local produce and don't skip any of the components. They are all simple to prepare and the magic in this dish happens when you taste everything together. Gets 4 forks for how delicious it is given it's simplicity and it makes for a beautiful presentation for guests. Pair it with a semi-dry riesling. I can't have a grill btw so I pan sear the scallops in oil and broil the nectarine slices for a couple of minutes on each side.

So summery. Used smoked paprika instead of espelette and thought that worked well. I recommend the following as an accompaniment: Brush leftover basil puree on slices of bread and grill those too. Rub a garlic clove on the toasted surface. Cut an avocado in half, sprinkle it with lime, salt, pepper, and smoked paprika. Spread the avocado on the bread like butter.

Loved the taste combo of fresh corn, tomatoes, basil and nectarines! I didn't grill anything, just chopped up the fresh ingredients as a salsa to go along with crab cakes. I overdid the lime juice in the vinaigrette, so blended in a half avocado and some leftover chipotle mayo to mitigate the citrus. It turned out great. Tart and spicy. Served everything over red quinoa and had a lovely colorful dinner that I'll want to repeat again and again.

Really enjoyed this. The dressing is delicious -- especially on the corn. A definite keeper.

This is one exceptional meal! The favors are extraordinary together. The only changes I made were NOT adding the lime zest(not a big lime fan) and I roasted the corn on the grill making it hot instead of raw. I also made the meal with scallops and shrimp. The salad is wonderful with the dressing and over the seafood. Why anyone would say that the flavors don't mess is beyond me. Will definitely may this several times this summer because the tomatoes and corn will only get better.

Fantastic dish! However, as I am not a huge fan of scallops, I've made it a few times now minus those. I've served it this way as a side dish twice so far to rave reviews: once with grilled chicken; the other with spiced lamb chops with mint mango sauce. Yum!

This was a very yummy summery dish. And, it looks so fabulous! Made it for a backyard party and everybody raved! Made the dressing the day before so the flavors could gel. Will make again for sure.

This is an elegant dish, lovely for a dinner party, that doesn't take much time or effort. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

This was wonderful. I loved the lime dressing, and the corn and tomatoes were great. I cooked the corn for a few minutes before I cut it off of the cob. The recipe doesn't specifically call for that, but I think it helped a lot. I served it cold, though.

We love this salad. I often serve it with mixed greens or arugula. I've done it with peaches when I couldn't get nectarines, and with shrimp and chicken when I couldn't get scallops. It is infinitely versatile and delicious. I do taste everything as I mix the dressing because the intensity and liquidity of the ingredients is always different, so I adjust as needed.

Rating: 4
I think this is a terrific salad; so refreshing and clean tasting! There is no reason to do the dressing a puree separately. I put all the dressing ingredients in a blender along with the basil puree ingredients then proceeded with the recipe as written. A great summertime meal that has become a repeat at our house.

I agree that the ingredients in this recipe seem disjointed. I altered a few things and didn't rate it because of that. I roasted the corn and tomato together with the basil olive oil and it was delicious with the grilled scallops. We ate the grilled nectarine for dessert with ice cream.

I did have to make a few subsitutions because I made this last minute, but it was absolutely delicious. My recommendation for people who thought the lime was bitter...taste it before you add the other ingredients. Some limes may just be bitter. Adjust the recipe as you see fit...you are smarter than teh recipe!

I made this last summer but won't make it again. The dish lacked cohesion, too many incompatible flavors together. Also, the lime juice, tomatoes, and basil puree made my plate very watery...

Made this for my mom's birthday (in August). So easy and a fitting dish for the end of summer. This dish is really all about the simple ingredients, so fresh scallops, fresh corn off the cob, and perfect nectarines can shine. The family couldn't believe how sweet and tender the raw corn was. I can't wait for summer so I can make this again...

This dish is more than the sum of its parts, and it has some great parts. I like to grill the corn for a few minutes before cutting it off the cob.

We made this recipe this weekend. Upon tasting the dressing we found it quite bland. I had not read reviews and after so doing was very surprised at the comments on the dressing being overly flavored. We added a few tablespoons of Roses Lime Juice and it really kicked up the flavor. Would definitely make it again.

I served the individual components over red quinoa. It tied it all together as a great main course.

This was a fantastic dish. I followed it to the letter except I didn't have a grill. I seared the scallops and roasted the nectarines. I think the scallops would have been better grilled but the nectarines turned out lovely. So sweet and delicious. And I was going to cook the corn but the corn I had was good and very sweet so it was great raw. I forgot to put the basil puree on for the first few bites then remembered it and put it on. We both agreed it was the perfect touch to have the basil. This is a truly fantastic mix of flavors and lets the great summer vegetables shine.

This recipe was delicious but unnecessarily complicated! The basil puree was yummy but next time I would buy a little pesto to save time (and the dish doesn't even need it.) Definitely cook the corn first. I thought the lime flavor was too strong when I tasted the vinaigrette but mixed with the corn and tomatoes (yes I mixed both instead of separately as suggested) it complimented the dish wonderfully. This recipe was a lot of prep work which could easily be simplified but the actual cooking time was very quick!

I must admit that although I made the vinaigrette and the basil order I did not use either. I thought the vinaigrette was way too tart and the basil oil too bitter. So I just put oil and vinegar on the corn and chopped basil for over the top. I used really good olive oil so it enhanced all the flaors. It was so delicious. Because I felt I had to change the recipe I gave it only 3 fork but with my modifications it was 4 forks!

Rating: 4
Might have given 3.5 because husband throught there was too much going on flavor-wise. Very difficult to halve because of the need to blend the basil. Ended up making the full amount of basil. Loved the fresh corn taste.

I did not think this was good, and for the life of me, my husband & I can't understand the glowing reviews. The dish was completely disjointed, and the flavors did not unify into a whole. A few other thoughts: I would have preferred the corn to be slightly cooked, and I think searing scallops brings out their deliciousness more than grilling them does. My only take away here is that nectarines on the grill are delicious, and perhaps I will make them again and serve them as either a dessert with whipped cream or in a salad with arugula and toasted nuts.

Rating: 4
Amazing flavors. Would not change a thing, but did like another suggestion of blending the puree and dressing together. As written it was difficult to make the puree smooth. The dressing tastes tart by itself but the sweetness of the scallops, nectarines and corn balances it out. (Frozen corn would be a better substitute than canned.) Very clean tasting impressive salad. I will definitely be putting it in my "do again file".

I obviously realize I'm in the minority here, but I was horribly disappointed in this. I had wonderful nectarines and the only thing I changed was skipping the basil puree because of a broken blender. To make up for this, I infused the olive oil with basil. I don't know what went wrong but the flavors seemed so separate and united to form a dish which was nothing more than the sum of its parts. The lime gave the scallops a simply awful bitter, sour taste. After the glowing reviews I made it for company wothout a preview... how utterly embarassing. they choked it down with half-smiles and clearly farsicle polite comments.

The scallops and tangerines together were outstanding! This was very easy to make. I cut fresh corn off the cob, but this could have also been done with canned corn to save time. The basil puree is also delicious! Presentation is gorgeous on the plate!

Jim from Florida, you basically changed the entire recipe and in the end only gave it 2 forks saying that the recipe was, "disappointing".... How do you figure? I did make this recipe as is and thought is was delicious! Will definitely make again!

all i have to say is that this recipe is super-delish! i pretty much made it as is, with the exception of cooking the corn on the cob and then grilling for a couple of minutes. everything tasted wonderful. i had a "top chef" moment when pouring on the basil puree. looked great! highly recomend.

Excellent recipe - definitely one we will make again - Summer on a plate. Had to use plums instead of nectarines - not a change I would recommend.

I made this for about 10 people this weekend, added grilled shrimp to the warm salad and it was perfect. I used more corn and dressing then this recipe called for. Great recipe.

If you are an adventurous with your Platte this scallop recipe is great! At the end all the flavors just came together. (Even my 12 yrs old boys enjoyed this dish). However, I did follow the recommendations of jillcookie and kznadalin reviews about blending the dressings and the puree together. In addition, my husband grilled the corn for about all of 4 minutes. Tossed it with the tomatoes and (as recommended) diced nectarines with little of the dressing then topped it with the scallops. Nice presentation!

This was lovely. We used shrimp because the scallops at the market didn't look good. The corn is so good this time of year that there was no need to blanch it.

This was an awesome dinner. The nectarines add just the right amount of spice. I highly recommend this.

This was a fantastic recipe. The scallops should be marinated and the corn blanched.

Easy to make. I substituted shrimp for scallops, canned white shoepeg corn for fresh corn, omitted the chile powder and sprinkled with cummin. Oh, no limes so I used lemons and peaches for necterines. Due to high blood pressure I omitted the salt. The recipe was somewhat disappointing but OK.

Great recipe! Perfect for hot weather! I blanched the corn, omitted the basil puree and tossed the corn and tomatoes together with the vinaigrette. Presentation was beautiful and easy. Put scallops in the middle of a pretty plate, arrange the nectarines in a "pinwheel" shape around the edge, scatter the corn & tomatoes around them and sprinkle the basil chiffonade over it. Then sit back and listen to the oohs and ahhs of your guests as they enjoy the beautiful plate and enjoy so many succulent flavors.

I really liked the ease of this recipe, but made a couple of changes. I also skipped the lime zest and used a pesto sauce rather than blanching the basil. I used chopped mangos instead of nectarines and added chopped cucumbers. Adding small scallops and baby shrimp turned this into a wonderful side dish for dinner and a great salad for lunch.

Yummy flavors but I made a couple of changes. I grilled the corn briefly before cutting it off the ears. Raw corn didn't appeal to me And served this with grilled salmon rather than scallops. But it was very tasty, and I think the dressing would go nicely on other things this summer.

When I saw this recipe, I had to make it even though I did not really like scallops or the idea of raw corn. Well, everything about this dish was a wonderful tasting surprise. My guests loved the dish. I will make it again many times. Thank you.

Basically a good dish that tastes like summer BUT -- the lime zest added nothing but bitterness. Yes - I have a zesting tool and I know how to use it. I would recommend using the lime juice and maybe substutiting at least half, if not all, lemon zest. I love lime juice - cook with it alot - but the lime zest was NOT a pleasant addition to the dish. OTher than that - I would recommend the dish. I would also suggest serving 1-scallop-per plate as an appetizer - rather than an main course dinner.

Wonderful flavors. I'm not fond of Scallops so I grilled shrimp and it was delicious. I too streamlined the recipe by blending the basil puree with the dressing. That made enough for the blender to mix nicely. My picky husband loved it! I've got to work on my presentation!

I wasn't sure about the basil mixture since I made a smaller batch and the blender could barely mix it, so I combined the lime dressing with it in the blender. The flavor was good but needed a little something, so I took a chance and added 1 teaspoon of fig balsamic vinegar. It was amazing. I also steamed the fresh ears of corn for four minutes before slicing off the kernels - they were barely cooked and still had crunch. I tossed the corn, sliced tomatoes and grilled nectarines together with a small amount of dressing before plating with the scallops. The flavors blended beautifully, so next time, it will be a simpler process. Definitely a keeper - I only gave 3 stars because the original recipe could have been streamlined, but I figured it out. Yum!

This is a wonderful summer meal. My husband was not happy about uncooked corn. When I gave him a kernel of uncooked corn to try, he quickly changed his mind. We both thought every thing was just delicious. Jeanne Wood, Prescott, AZ
