We really enjoyed this and I cannot figure out why hardly anyone else has reviewed it. I had to improvise as I was using turkey leftovers not the 5-6# turkey the recipe called for. This meant chicken broth had to sub for the turkey broth that would have been the result of simmering the whole bird. The recipe instructions call for green peppers but they are not listed in the ingredients. I used 1. Also I would recommend using sliced green olives instead of whole ones. Next time I might try adding another seasoning - maybe tarragon or cumin would work. But all in all a really tasty, inventive dish that I will definitely make again.

No complaining about this dish. Please! I think that we are all tired of hearing the reprobation every time an innovative recipe is published.
