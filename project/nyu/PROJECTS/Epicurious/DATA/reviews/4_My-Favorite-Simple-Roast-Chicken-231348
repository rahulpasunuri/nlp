This chicken deserves a dinner party. I was worried that the ease and simplicity would make it ho-hum, as some said. Definitely not the case. It had crispy skin, moist meat, and the few ingredients and minimal prep time make it a total winner. It doesn't need butter or dijon. It doesn't need vegetables or a long list of ingredients. Do what Keller says: dry it well, salt it well, put it in a roasting pan so it cooks evenly, and leave it alone. I added some white wine to the pan juices along with the thyme and scraped the pan. Then I just poured the pan sauce over the top before serving. So good, you'll want to spoon it over each bite.

Wasted a chicken. I can't think of any way to roast a chicken that would be as "meh" as this. The skin was tough, not crispy.

I began making this recipe a few years ago and it is now on my weekly rotation. SO good and so easy. TK isn't tops for nothing. Letting the chick speak for itself is key and Dijon on side with a simple green salad is the perfect week night meal.

I have made this roast chicken more than than any other recipe in my weekly rotation...at least 40 times per year (!), and I have always ended up with crispy, dark golden skin. The key is to dry the chicken prior to roasting. Don't add anything else that may add steam. This recipe doesn't need the thyme.....the butter at the end....or the mustard. So easy. Don't be scared when the skin gets dark around 40 minutes....that is when the goodness begns.

hate to be a nay-sayer in this large group of adoring fans but my opinion was - meh... i have tried this a few times thinking i must be doing something wrong but have conferred with others and - well, so be it. it is a simple nice roast chicken and it is moist but the skin never got to the crispiness of my liking, and the flavors (even with varied spices) was just there - nothing so special.

This is my go to recipe for roasted chicken. I decrease the oven temperature to 435 degrees but otherwise follow the recipe up to the point of basting with thyme and pan juices. The recipe is simple and reminds you that cooking does not need to be complicated to be delicious.

This really is simple and good. It does make a mess of your oven however. I try to always do it in the gas grill and use throwaway aluminum roasting pans.

I'm guessing all these raves are because it's a Thomas Keller receipe. I followed the recipe exactly and in 50 minutes my chicken was very brown on top but the wings and sides were not. Also, the dark meat was far from cooked. I cooked it another 20 minutes and the dark meat was still not completely cooked. My oven temp is accurate, I think this recipe just doesn't work. I would NEVER slather butter on cooked chicken. I'll stick with Julia's fabulous roast chicken which never fails.

Easy to forget how simple things are often the best. This recipe is a great reminder! Very simple to make, but creates a delicious and very moist chicken. Will definitely use this method for roasted chicken again! I didn't have fresh thyme or mustard, but it was delicious without as well. Definitely recommend trussing the bird. I hadn't trussed anything before, but with a quick online search, it was no problem. And I think it made a big difference in how moist the breast came out.

LOVE this recipe. For those who are mindful of their meat sources, my family gets all of our meat and beef from a 100% grass-fed beef source. The farm also has pastured poultry, and pastured pork. You can order their pastured meats online at http://www.pastureprimewagyu.com. Thanks for the recipe!!

Delicious! Skin was crispy and meat is juicy. Very simple preparation. I prepared it in the morning and left it uncovered in the fridge to dry the skin further. Find that helps with crisping up the skin.

Rating: 4
Great! I like to salt the bird 12 hours in advance with a 1/2 tsp of salt in the cavity and a full tsp on the outside. I also put a sprig of rosemary inside before I truss. About 45 minutes before i put it in the oven I like to add pepper to the outside (maybe a 1/2 tsp) and also another 1/2 tsp of salt. I use kosher salt. I bake a 3.5 lb bird for about 50 minutes on a roasting rack at the bottom of the oven. I spoon off the clear juice and retain the colored, thick juice. I pour about a 1/4 cup of chicken stock (white wine if I have) into the pan and scrape to get any extra juice and chicken flavor. I add all of this and the colorful juices to a small skillet and thicken. I turn the heat off and add a small slice of butter to help thicken it up. I remove the skin before adding the gravy, because I like the skin crispy and not wet. Best roast I've had.

I folowed this recipe to the T and it was FABULOUS. Even my husband, who never ever eats breast meat, loved it. The temperature and the resting did the trick for super moist chicken with a crispy skin.

Amazing! The most succulent, crisp bird that I have ever had. Lots of juice in the bottom and no smoke whatsoever. I roasted mine in a skillet with squared up sides and not a saute pan. It was a large-ish bird and so did not have a lot of room for splatter. I think that may be the trick. Lots of paper towels for drying. If my husband wasn't devoted to me before he is now :). Best ever!!!!

Perfect every time! We make this on an almost weekly basis. I roast mine in an All-Clad skillet and make a great reduction sauce with the drippings and whatever I have on hand (white wine, broth, lemon juice, etc.)

Made this according to the recipe, but I put a few sprigs of rosemary into the cavity before roasting. I'd never roasted a chicken before, so if you haven't either, this is what I learned: make sure the chicken is close to the bottom of the oven (bottom rack) because if not, the juices/fat "pops" and onto the hot top of the oven, causing smoke and alarms to go off. Also, the pan became too hot so juices evaporated on contact so there wasn't much for me to work with for the gravy. (For the gravy, I used the juices, a spoonful of flour, then topped up with chicken stock, and salt & pepper to taste)

Delicious - thank you Mr. Keller! This dish is straight-forward simple, delicious and homey.

this was my first time roasting a chicken and i chose to follow this recipe because it was so simple and had so many good reviews, not to mention the fact that i didn't need any special ingredients. i had a 4lb, free range bird that i purchased frozen almost 1 yr ago from my farm share which i thawed for about a day and a half in the fridge. it was fun learning how to truss the chicken and after sizzling away in my oven for an hour, it came out crisp and perfect. actually, i forgot the butter and it was still delicious. i'll definitely use this technique again!

Rating: 4
Simple and delicious! I used a 6lb chicken, slipped the thyme sprigs under the skin before trussing and seasoned with salt and pepper. I used an instant read thermometer that beeps when the desired internal temp is reached (more reliable than going with just the baking time.) The roast was so juicy while the skin was crisp. Leftovers were still moist and I used the bones of the body to make arroz caldo. The chicken breasts were great for sandwhiches - so moist and tender! Can't wait to make again! Thank you, Thomas Keller!

This is the recipe I've used since I got married and everyone has always liked the way I cook chicken. You don't need to truss the chicken if you use cornish game hens, as I have, or if you use pieced thighs and keep a close watch on the time and chicken itself as it's cooking. Also adding a little squeezed orange juice to the inside and lightly coating with a little coconut oil instead of butter makes it kosher and taste slightly sweet with a salty crunch.

Rating: 4
excellent recipe- simple is best! i did exactly as the recipe stated up to the thyme part because I wanted simple "lunch meat" for sandwiches. Yes, it splatters a bit, but this isn't the recipe's fault. grease when heated splatters. Just put tinfoil on the top rack of your oven. Sure a bit of smoke, but again this isn't because of the recipe- just the bird cooking. Turns out great, moist and delicious!

This was a wonderful simple chicken recipe. Mine DIDN'T smoke. Seems to smoke and pop more when there's liquid in with the chicken. But when that happens I just tent the bird. I roasted it in my deep roaster without the V holder. Did stick a little bit as I had lined the pan with foil for ease of clean up,but it pulled right up after it rested. I didn't have much of any pan juices. I did heat up chicken stock with melted butter to pour in the pan as it rested so that I'd have something to baste it with while resting! Raves reviews from family! Will keep this simple idea. Couldn't taste the thyme though and it was fresh from my garden.

Rating: 4
I agree with all of the other wonderful reviews. I think the nasty comments to those who get smoke are very rude. I'm an excellent cook, and there was smoke. I did it on the outside electric grill and it caught on fire. Next time, and oh yes, there will be a next time, I will use the kitchen oven, with the foil on top, a roaster pan with high sides along with root vegetables on the bottom. This recipe also works with pieces of chicken also!

I am so disgusted with this recipe. I roasted it EXACTLY as written and I have never had such a holy mess in my oven. The chicken skin/fat sprayed all over the entire oven, smoke filled the house and it didn't even smell good. When I took the chicken to check the temp it was still spewing everywhere. I had to clean the stove top, the oven and the walls and countertops where it made a mess. I will NEVER EVER do this recipe again!

I used this recipe for a 4lb Ginseng fed chicken, with a few little changes. I dried the bird with paper towel inside and out, placed in a raised roasting pan breast side down. I coated the skin with 1 tsp salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, and inserted a meat thermometer to ensure I cooked it through. Took 70 minutes for my bird at 450 to reach 180 F inside. At that point I took it out of the oven, flipped the bird over and broiled on Low setting for 2 minutes. BEST roast chicken I've ever made, no basting, no burning and the breast was tender and juicy. Amazing crispy skin, I feel silly I've basted and buttered chickens in the past because this was perfect. Simple really is better! We ate carved up chicken with fresh mango hedgehogs on the side :)

This is the first time I've ever cooked a whole chicken and I must say, this recipe is a revelation. First, I had no idea that such a simple recipe could be so good. Good cooking doesn't have to be complicated. Second, chicken the food is from chicken the bird. I guess I never stopped to think about it before. It's not that obvious when you're eating it in chicken soup or a nugget. I'm not sure how I feel about that. Anyway, you will enjoy this recipe even if it does involve eating a real bird.

I've made this recipe a million times, and I've noticed that many people complain about the smoke. I had that problem too, but now I put a sheet of aluminum foil on the top rack of the stove (above the chicken) - it seems to stop the chicken fat from spraying on the top burner, and I haven't had a smoke problem since!

I was able to make this chicken in a tiny toaster oven, using only the leg/thigh part of the chicken, and it turned out phenominal. Was really nervous about the chicken burning or smoking being so close to the heat but it cooked perfectly in 30 minutes with minimal smoking. I made this as a test recipe for Christmas dinner and it definitely passed.

This recipe is delicious and I have made it many times. I have found a way around the smoke! Chop root vegetables (potatoes, sweet potatoes, parsnips, etc) and put them in the bottom of the roasting pan. The chicken drippings will fall on them making them crispy on the outside, soft on the inside - delicious! Turn the veggies 2-3 times during cooking so they don't burn on one side. You can do this quick enough that it doesn't interfere w the chicken cooking. This recipe rocks! Tonight I was lazy so used adobo seasoning with salt on the outside for the flavoring.

This is as amazing as everyone says it is and more. I use only salt and pepper and not as much salt as is called for; I do truss the bird (amateurishly) and I perch it atop thick disks of yam and onion, as some reviewers recommended. The vegetables carmelize beautifully and become laden with delicious juices. This was our Thanksgiving dinner last year (a small one for four) and it was better than any turkey dinner I've ever made. Pretty much my favorite recipe.

Like this recipe needs another review, but I can't help myself! It was unbelievably moist and flavorful. To those who had problems with smoking (which I didn't), perhaps you need to 1) clean the oven first or 2) add the root vegetables to the recipe which the video explains posted by a previous reviewer or 3) get a better oven! Obviously, you apartment dwellers have no choice in ovens, but I really think the oven has a lot to do with the smoking problem. That being said - it was the best and now only recipe I will ever use to roast a chicken. I had a 5 pound chicken and it took 1 hour and 10 minutes and was perfectly done and moist. The skin is pretty salty, but i loved it! This recipe is not for you high blood pressure people if you want to eat the skin. Do yourself a favor and watch the video. It really helps. The link to that video is a page or two back on the comments.

This is quite good. Don't hesitate to use lots of salt. If you're inclined to put butter under the skin (as I am) make sure to put some chicken broth in the bottom of your roasting pan otherwise at 450 degrees, the melting butter will cause a smoke storm. This may pull away from the recipe's advice about trying to get a dry roast but I thought it came out great.

Rating: 4
So simple and so divine! The oven only smoked during the first 15 minutes or so. I had two 5 pound chickens, so I cooked this for about an hour and 10 minutes. Perfect timing. I will always truss my birds from now on. The best part was the skin, and it was the first time my son ate the skin on chicken that wasn't deep fried. Adding the fresh thyme in the drippings and then basting with it really made a nice, subtle flavor. I served it with the drippings, as we love natural juices with the meat. Now I have another chicken for dinner for the week. My definite new go to roast chicken method from now on. Almost 500 positive reviews can't be wrong!

I cook a chicken every Sunday and have used dozens of great recipes. No longer. My husband requests this every week. Speaking as someone who usually likes to add my own touch, this recipe is perfect as is. Truly perfect. I do usually make a little mustard thyme butter sauce for the side. I start with a couple of tablespoons of butter, add flour to make a roux, add chicken broth, a splash of white wine and maybe a splash of cream if I have some. Then stir in quality dijon and a plenty of thyme. Not a health food but divine in small quantities. Make this chicken. You will not regret it.

This was awesome! My 5-yr old son picked out a 9 lb chicken at Trader Joe's and I was wondering how to roast since it was so big. I found this recipe, did exactly as written (he helped salt the bird, so I thought it was going to be over salted -- but it wasn't). It was DE-licious!!! Comments from my son: "This is the best chicken ever!" "I didn't think it would taste this good!" Anyway, I know: 5-yr old palette, but still, it WAS amazing!! (He wanted to eat the skin.) Oh, and I roasted at 450 for 2 hours due to the size. I think I could have maybe turned it down mid-way maybe, but it was still incredibly moist.

We made this with no planning, and ended up using a blow dryer to ensure the skin was dry. Next time, we'll let it dry age in our refrigerator, salmonella be damned. It was the crispiest skin and juiciest white meat I've made, with about 55 minutes of cooking time.

Results were excellent! The fast cooking method works great & I had no problems with smoking. I followed recipe exactly as written with the trussing & thyme & all. I was skeptical about cooking a chicken so 'quickly' for fear of it not cooking all the way through, but that was not a problem! I used a temperature probe jabbed deep inside the meat of the thigh. When it reached 170* I took it out of the oven to let it 'carry over cook' and let it rest for 1/2 hour to let it cook the rest of the way so that it would remain juicy. {Just Google 'Carrie over cook' if you don't' know what that term means} I find leaving a chicken in the oven until it reaches 175* overcooks & will dry out chicken. The flavor wasn't as 'unusually spectacular' as I had hoped with the butter, thyme & Dijon, the flavor was very good indeed,but it was no better of a flavor than other recipes I have for chicken. To be fair I used 'Golds' Dijon mustard which I bought for the first time and find it only tastes like 'regular brown mustard' and not like Dijon at all! I won't be buying that brand again & I will stick to Grey Poupon.Maybe the flavor would have impressed me more if I had better quality Dijon Mustard with the white wine in it. This 'method' of quick cooking the chicken is something I will continue to do in the future, perhaps with different seasonings.

Just tried this recipe for the first time and it's definitely a keeper. I greased the bottom of the pan lightly and layered slices of potatoes, then placed the chicken on top. For seasoning, I used salt, paprika, and ancho chile powder (my husband isn't big on thyme). The 4lb chicken took ~1:40min to cook fully. I had zero issues with smoking. The skin was crispy and golden and the breast meat was super juicy :)

I have tried countless roasted chicken recipes and this is by far the best. It's also the easiest! Start with a good quality organic chicken. The smaller chickens are better. I always do the optional thyme basting, this really adds a lot of flavor. The temp is very high, so make sure you have a clean oven and lots of ventilation. I've smoked out the house a couple of times making this recipe. The skin turns out perfectly brown and crispy and the meat is tender and juicy. It's great paired with a little dijon as suggested.

Don't skimp on the mustard. I also always recommend organic chicken. The flavor is so very much better. Good luck!

I just wanted to add that I only had chicken legs, not a full chicken, and this still worked really well. I cut the cooking time down to about 20min, and the skin still came out nice and crisp, lightly browned. I might bump up the heat even more in the future to see if I can't get it browner. I had no smoke issues. Since I had some herbs on hand I wanted to use, I made an herbed butter and put that on the chicken, plus a bit of mustard. Tasty. But just the chicken alone is really good, too.

This is a delicious and simple recipe. I also had smoking issues, so now I always cook this recipe outside in my "Bubba" grill. It comes out great, and the smoke adds another layer of flavor.

Made this for the 3rd time last night. Just supurb with the free range chix I picked up on sale. I cooked a 4 lb chicken for an hour. The dark meat was done, breast a tiny overdone but still juicy. I usually always check the temperature with an instant read thermometer before removing from the oven. Going by time can vary depending on the size of the chix, how cold it is, and the accuracy of your oven. Be sure to let it rest before carving.

I was very intrigued with idea of baking a chicken at high temperature. I know Keller is the super-stud chef - but I think his recipe will get you food poisoning. I cooked a medium sized chicken at 450 for an hour. According to my thermometer - bird was undercooked. Cut it open - pink juices. I had to cut up the chicken and throw it back in the oven. Maybe I did something wrong...but I don't think so...

Chef Thomas, your food sir, is in a word Epic. This is the most delicious roast chicken I've ever made. And like the other reviewers I was very skeptical about the recipe but tried it anway and I was blown away. My boyfriend and I did end up eating the chicken with our hands. No fuss, no exotic ingredients just Chicken, salt, butter and potatoes. Thank you for this and I will gladly make it again.

Regards to my earlier review, I should clarify - bring the chicken to near room temp BEFORE cooking.Just ensure you cook to an internal temp of ~165 deg F. And give ample rest time before carving.

Foolproof basic roast chicken recipe. I used to use Julia Child's recipe but this is much less fussy and just as good IMO. Bring the chicken to slightly below room temperature for the best results. Bon Apetit.

I have yet to find a better way to prepare roast chicken. This simple recipe leaves the chicken moist and flavorful!

A total winner & easy as can be! I followed the directions exactly except I used a 4.5 pounder, and also lined the pan with thin potato slices to cut down on the flying grease (thanks to suggestions from other reviewers) and the bird was so tender & flavorful! After exactly 60 minutes, it was baked to perfection. My husband thought the ultra-browned potato chips were delectable and other than the five I was able to snag, he ate the rest! Definitely will make this again!

I live in France and this is about the only way I cook roast chicken. I use farm chicken from the butcher or a label rouge chicken. It's so simple you cannot fail to bring juicy, tender meat to the table!

I'm constantly shocked that such simple preparation can result in such a tasty dish. This is my husband's favorite chicken. Just make sure the bird is thoroughly dried and it's foolproof. I usually serve with a simple green salad and shallot haricot vert from another recipe in Keller's Bouchon cookbook.

I love this recipe, the butter and mustard are a must! If your oven is clean and your pan not too shallow the oven shouldn't smoke. You do have to clean it after, but it's worth it :) DELISH!

Who knew a roasted chicken could be this easy!!!! So delicious. Leave it to TK to make it this fab. I never expected the ease.

The solution to the smoke and the oven clearning? Put it on the barbeque! And do it in a "disposable" aluminum pan. (I use mine about 4 times before I dispose of it.) I've done it this way for years now (in all seasons) and the result is perfect. You obviously need to have a BBQ (with a lid) that gets this hot and a temperature gauge to monitor it. I've never looked back... I have tried all sorts of chickens - free range, corn fed, el cheapo from the local grocery and I can honestly say it doesn't matter one bit: a chicken makes it's own mind up whether it's going to be a bit dry or exceptionally juicy and tender. But it's always good!

This is my favorite recipe on Epicurious. It is the easiest recipe and tastes divine! It is well worth it to take the time to find the 3 lb. organic chickens. As suggested, I line the pan with thin slices of potatoes. It doesn't take long and does help with the smoke. I make it according to the recipe and always serve it with a good butter and the dijon mustard. It is consistently delicious.

Rating: 4
So delicious. When it came out I tasted the skin, and was worried that I'd oversalted, but everyone said it was phenomenalbut it turned out to be perfect. I skipped the butter and dijon, because it was juicy and flavourful just as is, and my boyfriend wanted to eat it right away. Slathering butter on sounds pretty divine though. We ate the dark meat last night with whipped potatoes and green beans, and will eat the breasts and wings tonight with polenta and and some greens. The bones are simmering on the stove right now with half an onion, a bunch of water, and the drippings...and the stock is already so tasty that I can't stop sampling it. Oh.... and the smoke set off the entire apartment fire alarm.... which stayed on for twenty minutes straight. Ooops. It was totally worth it, though it would be great to figure out how to cut down on smoke for next time.

Rating: 4
I tried this tonight for the second time. Both times excellent. The best and simplest recipe I've ever found, I love it. The first time around I did have some smoking issues, but after cleaning my oven thoroughly, it wasn't a problem this time around. I can't recommend this more. Follow this one to the letter and you'll be preparing this regularly.

Absolutely incredible. I skipped the thyme and butter step, we began eating the exact second the 15 minute rest time was over. I will never bother with another roast recipe again. This recipe is an example of "tasting the food". Respect the bird by keeping it SIMPLE, the chicken will speak for itself!!!

This is an easy, awesome recipe. Reviews from much earlier suggested lining the roasting pan with thinly sliced potatoes. This helps dramatically with the smoky oven issue and creates some deliciously fatty and tasty potatoes...

Just made this for the first time last night. I agree, this recipe is simple and delicious, but I also have the problem of a super smoky kitchen. Does everyone experience this?

My left eyebrow hurts from having it raised into an arch the entire time this bad boy was roasting (*skeptical face*) Not only was I skeptical of the recipe, I was even skeptical of all of the raving reviews. How could only salt and pepper make a perfect roasted chicken? I now owe everyone an apology, because they were right. And I feel like queen of the world for having produced a totally perfect roasted chicken. I can't even wait for the accompaniments to be ready. I'm eating it right out of the pan.

Everyone's right - this recipe is amazing! I have company from out of town coming to stay with me so I'm experimenting with recipes; made this for myself and I'm a little embarrassed to say that I ate half a chicken in a very short time.... Didn't have any thyme in the house. I made a sauce by skimming the pan juices a little, added dijon mustard and finished it with a small amount of butter. The sauce tasted fantastic but I didn't even really use it - the chicken by itself was so juicy and tender I liked it better with nothing on it. I am a big fan of roasting chicken (or really any meat) with onions and potatoes, but this is now on my list of best roast chicken ever!

This recipe poses a major problem. I don't ever want to use another technique for roasting chickens again, but I can't have the smoke detectors going off every time I want roast chicken. So I guess I am limited to having this in spring and fall when I can open up the house and run the oven.

Chicken was perfect. I usually make a simple gravy from the drippings with some butter, flour, and pepper. No need for salt because it's already well seasoned. I serve the breast, thighs, and legs and save the carcass for lunch the next day. Getting all the delicious bits including the oyster, it's better than the meat. Of course, this is a meal best eaten with hands and a roll of paper towel.

This recipe had my husband stalking around the kitchen..whaaat did you season it with? Just salt? HOW high is the roasting temperature?? Are you sure this is right? To the point where I began to doubt. There was no need. The chicken was perfect, succulent, amazing. My husband and son finished eating and then picked over the carcass like a couple of cavemen while I sat and watched while savoring my perfect juicy breast with the golden skin and a side of garlic mashed baby reds.... And chuckling to myself. Just make the chicken.

I occasionally try other recipes for roast chicken but keep coming back to this. It ALWAYS comes out perfectly moist with delectable crunchy skin and is ridiculously easy to prepare. I do agree that adding potatoes to the pan while the chicken is roasting helps keep the smoke to a minimum. Last night when I made this, there was no smoke whatsoever. Ive given this recipe to a few skeptical friends who cant believe that salt is the only other main ingredient but once they try it, they all become converts.

Believe me, I've made my share of Roasted Chickens, I've stuck beer cans in them, put them in roasting bags, I've rubbed them and basted them but this is by far the best looking and most delicious chicken I've ever prepared, or eaten for that matter.

I've made this over and over and have a hard time even trying other recipes b/c I know that it's almost impossible to improve on this method. I've yet to try the butter and mustard at the end, b/c the chicken turns out so incredibly perfect. Eventually I WILL try it though. I also want to say that I almost always use just a store bought whole chicken, usually Foster Farms and it's always tender, moist with a beautiful crisp skin. I don't think you can go wrong with this recipe; it makes even plain ol' store-bought chicken taste divine!

The taste of the black pepper chicken is awesome! My husband and kids like this dish very much. My husband says this black pepper dish improves digestion and promotes intestinal health. I guess he is right, because black pepper is full of enzyme. To make the chicken taste even better, I thrown in a few gloves of crushed garlic and 1 teaspoon of mince ginger. The sweetness of garlic, gave the chicken slightly nutty flavour it is very appetising. The shortcoming of this dish is it was slightly saltiest (Due to time constraint I forgotten to add in brown sugar!). Here is the last weekend dinner ( pepper chicken, tomatoes& cabbage salad, rosemary bun and spring onion with brown sauce. If you want to grate large amount of ginger, I reckon this ginger grater will be quite useful, it wont cutter edge wont become blunt easily. Anyway thanks for all the hard works and time to list out the recipes.

This is fantastic. It's amazing how simple and how delicious this is. Also wanted to point out the silliness of the review that gave only 3 out of four forks... because he wished for more "complexity or strength of flavor"..

I'd say keep your trap shut unless you're actually talking about the recipe as written.

Even though there are hundreds of positive reviews, I couldn't believe it until I made it myself. Super easy and absolutely delicious! You can not go wrong. And if you don't know how to truss, ask the butcher to do it for you (you can still rinse the inside and outside and salt/pepper the cavity). Will definitely make this again. No changes needed (although I used dry thyme; and there weren't a lot of pan juices from my Amish free-range chicken).

Absolutely delectable. We hosted a dinner party for 20 guests last night, so I cooked three chickens (at once) using this recipe. Our guests raved about the flavor and the tender juiciness of the bird. This will be my go-to recipe for roast chicken from now on. Just a quick note: my thyme disappeared somewhere in the abyss of my stuffed-full refrigerator, so I stuffed the birds full of sage and set them over a bed of rosemary instead. The gravy we made from the drippings was very yummy.

Wow....so simple and so delicious. I must admit I was skeptical, however this has now become MY favorite roast chicken recipe! Definitely important to make sure the raw bird is dry and brought up to room temperature before putting it in the oven. I watched the bird roasting in the oven and noticed that the skin cooks first and essentially seals all of those wonderful juices....making for a wonderfully moist bird! And the dijon mustard definitely adds another level of flavor! I will make this again and again!

My husband and I love this recipe - really honors the ingredient. I do have one problem with it though. When I cook it the fat start spattering everywhere in the oven and it starts smoking. Does anyone else have this problem and any solutions? I did cover with foil the last time after about 40 minutes of cooking (and smoking!). It helped a little but I'd love other ideas!

I had just put a chicken in my dutch oven surrounded by vegetables and for some reason came here to check a recipe for roast chicken. I found this and quickly grabbed the bird out of the pan of vegetables, dried it off, salted it and put in the oven separately.

To add vegetables to the pan is to ignore the technique used in this recipe. Vegetables add steam and while that can produce a delicious dish, it is not the same. Don't skip the thyme, mustard and butter at the end of the preparation. It is a brilliant combination. I made a compound butter with the mustard and after removing most of the fat from the hot pan, stirred in the thyme, mustard, butter and then spooned it over the chicken. A truly inspired blend of flavors.

with all these rave reviews, it feels like a heresy to give only 3 forks. i definitely give 4 forks for ease of preparation; i've made this twice with organic birds and followed the recipe exactly except for placing some sprigs of thyme and a little rosemary in the cavity, and (the second time) laying thick-cut slices of potato under the chicken. the potatoes are heavenly, and the breast, especially, is very succulent! the reason for the missing fork is that while the texture of the bird is wonderful, i would like a bit more complexity or strength of flavor. didn't try butter or mustard--not my thing--but am thinking some garlic cloves in the cavity, or scattered in the pan, or fine slices beneath the skin, and/or also using the zuni trick-- sliding 4 sprigs of herbs under the skin. that makes it more labor intensive, but i think it would be worth it. i'll also try thick-cut onions and possibly carrots next time, as others have recommended. i'm sure i'll make this recipe again, but not sure if it's my holy grail. i've just been looking at the zuni method, which a friend swears by.... :)

Seriously yummy. I used a Rosie the Range Chicken that was just under 5 pounds, so I expected to have to cook it longer. Prepared the bird as directed, put it in my convection oven at 425F, checked it with a meat thermometer at 57 minutes, and it was thoroughly cooked. In other words, as another cook mentioned, the meat thermometer is your friend! I basted the chicken and let it rest as directed--definitely the best ever.

whoa, this was good. really good. no need for anything other than salt and pepper. what I did do, though, was once I took out the chicken, I threw in some halved cherry tomatoes into the juices so that they'd cook ever so slightly and served the tomatoes alongside some spoonfuls of the juice on top of the chicken. my oh my.

I have become 'known' for my roast chicken, but always give credit to epicurious. All I do is use sea salt, and 'rain' it on as suggested. I don't use the mustard or butter or thyme (although I have in the past). A more moist and simply flavoured chicken you will not ever have. It is important to find a good quality free-range, organically farm raised chicken. Makes a huge difference!

Marvelous -- just like the recipe said, we started with forks and knives and within minutes were tearing it apart with our hands and licking our fingers. How hedonistic!

Delicious. The only hiccup in cooking was that I had a 5 lb chicken, as opposed to the 2.5 lb chicken recommended in the recipe. It needed to cook for twice as long. Duh! It seems obvious now but I kept pulling it out of the oven and slicing the breast open. Use a meat thermometer, kids. The chicken leftovers were fantastic and I used them to make homemade chicken enchiladas.

Logged on to Epicurious to look for roast chicken. I've never been pleased with my previously roasted chickens -- too much trouble, not a good result, or not good looking. Found this recipe and dashed to the kitchen. By the time the oven was heated to the proper temperature, the bird was ready and waiting. Absolutely effortless. Followed the recipe to the letter but didn't bother with thyme. The oven did get smoky along the way but the fan took care of it. The result was one perfectly roasted, beautiful, moist, tasty chicken. No need for butter! I will roast every future chicken this way. Thank you. Thank you.

Truly exceptional, and unbearably simple to prepare. Followed the directions to the letter and even included the thyme and this chicken was marvelous. By far my favorite recipe to date. Make sure your roasting pan is not much larger than your chicken, or else the juices and fat will spread and burn. I used my Le Creuset pot to roast my small bird and it worked like a charm.

I've made this again and again with great success and small variations each time. Simple preparation, presents well with limited effort, cleanup quick and easy, leftovers are great - if there are any. I get the smokey oven too, but it's well worth it. It's worth it to use the quality bird, also. A staple with side of potatoes and nice veg, like asparagus or brussel sprouts. Delicious dining during the week when you may not have time or energy to 'spend in the kitchen'.

Best chicken ever! Better than any rotisserie chicken. I don't season it, but I do add a few aromatics to the cavity: chopped garlic cloves and some lemon peel or rosemary. I call it Smokehouse Chicken because the kitchen gets really smoky- it's worth it though!

This has got to be the best roast chicken i have ever had. So succulent and tasty. I threw in quartered red potatoes, sweet onions and thickly cut carrots and they came out wonderfully browned, tender and tasty. I cooked a 6lb bird and gave it 20 minutes per pound, never basting, then followed the recipe's instructions of letting it sit 15 minutes out of the oven. The fact that this meal requires practically no effort to cook will make this one of my favorite go to recipes.

This is a wonderful recipe! I chose it for a Channukah dinner for adults and young children who don't like fussy food. Everyone loved it. It was the juiciest, most succulent chicken any of us has had. Will definitely make it again. The only down side is that the high heat and grease from the chicken led to some smokiness- but the exhaust fan took care of it.

This recipe really demands a quality bird. If you have a high-quality product on your hands, this would be a worthy use of it. Typical supermarket chickens, however, will require more help in the flavor department.

This chicken is fantastic! Made it for the first time on Thanksgiving for my husband and I, we both raved so I made it again this past Sunday for some friends, great reviews all around. The only variations I made were to stuff the cavity with fresh herbs and a lemon, and I also cooked it on top of fingerling potaoes and carrots and did not have any smoking problems. The veggies are heavenly! An all around great meal!

We LOVE this so much that this Thanksgiving we ditched the turkey in favor a couple of these fabulous roast chickens. It was a big hit and no leftovers.

I've made this a lot since first trying it. I don't bother trussing the bird. I've never had a problem with smoke using this recipe. I always cook the bird on top of veggies so maybe that's why. Also, for the cook from Honolulu, I've done it with a fifteen pound turkey, no problem.

Rating: 4
where is the button for 5 forks? I made this first time: took the advice to cook on a bed of potatoes and carrots! The carrots were to kill for! Turned ti once last 15 minutes for more even browning. 2 questions: 1) the temperature of the bird reached 180 after 1 hour at 450 (a 4# bird) and i thought "OOPS, too done" but nope, it seemed just right. So why do some folks call for much lower finishing temps? 2) Can this method be used for a much larger bird like a Turkey?

I JUST finished making this recipe. I added a few steps and eliminated a couple but the basic idea is the salt . My husband and I both agree that this is by far the best roast chicken I've made. It is certainly a quick solution for an after work meal.

I have made this chicken a number of times, and agree, it really is simple and delicious. I do have a question to others who have made it successfully, though - is there a method that works so that the bottom of the chicken isn't soggy? I have used a rack, as well as no rack, in the roasting pan, and both ways, the chicken bottom is soggy and doesn't brown. Thoughts?

This is my master recipe for roast chicken. I've passed it on to friends and it's become the "bible" of chicken for us all. I use a 3 lb. fryer from Whole Foods or my local farmer's market, rinse, dry, rain the salt and roast at 450. It's hands down my favorite food. I swear, I could eat the whole thing standing up at the kitchen counter. I use the carcass for stock as well. I've blogged about this, and also posted it on Twitter. This, my friends, is chicken worth clucking about.

This is the best roast chicken! My husband requests it weekly throughout the fall and winter. He still panicks as I "rain" salt over the chicken, but he always loves the result. I dice bliss potatoes and shallots and surround them around the chicken. The veggies roast in the chicken fat...better than candy!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. It came out so juicy and tender. Trussing is very easy: there are many good videos on youtube showing you how to do it. I think the easiest truss is the figure-eight around the drumsticks. You really want to use a lot of salt and dry it really well. I think my skin would have been crispier if I dried it even more.

Delicious! I've roasted a lot of chickens, and this is the best one I've ever made. Used the potato hint, and had zero smoke.

Rating: 4
It's almost shocking, how easy this is and how perfectly it always turns out! It takes literally 5 minutes to get the chicken ready to roast, and 5 minutes to carve things up at the end of the cooking time. It's tough to find a chicken as small as the one called for, so I just get what they have at the grocery store and guesstimate on the cooking time. It helps to use a meat thermometer and to watch the little popup thingy most commercial chickens have these days. I think it took about 90 minutes for the most recent one. Most recently, I added potatoes and carrots to the bottom of the roasting pan, as another reviewer suggested. The potatoes were fine - nothing really all that special but it was an easy way to cook them. The carrots, however - they were blackened in places and looked limp and not at all attractive... but holy cow they tasted DIVINE. My teenage son refused to try them because he insisted they were burned. I made him try just one - and he wolfed down as many as we'd left for him (the family was fighting over them). Next time we'll probably skip the potatoes and put a lot more carrots in the pan. The drippings make a very nice gravy as well. You can move the chicken to another platter while it rests, and deglaze the pan, then just add a simple flour/water mix to the drippings for thickening. Might be slightly salty depending on how much salt you used on the bird, but it wasn't unpalatably so.

A true NYC gal, this take-out queen finally learned to cook. For my very first roast chicken I used this recipe and it was in a word - divine! It's really easy for even the novice cook and came out so unbelievably juicy and flavorful. My typically picky guests were blown away and begged to take home the leftovers. I will be making this weekly from now on. Love it!

Wow! I purchased a pastured raised 3 pound bird from healthy family farms and tossed it in at 450 in a le cruset dutch oven with copious kosher salt and pepper. It took about 70 minutes maybe 75, but holy cow that bird was off the chart. After I let it rest for 15 minutes I deglazed the pan with a chardonnay and thyme, and rubbed the bird with plugra. My kids and wife were silent as we all devoured that bird. Brilliant, simple recipe!

It's basically foolproof. Every time, this comes out amazing. I usually go even higher on the temperature, because I'm so impatient. 475 works well. If you put some raw potatoes and onions in the roasting pan under the chicken, they come out better than any potatoes and onions you've ever eating, no seasoning necessary (what isn't delicious, cooked in salty chicken fat?)

I don't cook this quite as hot as specified, and get great results-- crisp skin and lovely flavor. So far, haven't set off the smoke detector (Crosses fingers) My college age son has requested cooking lessons, so I just showed him how to do it, assuring him that he'll get raves every time he makes it. He said he'd claim it as a secret family recipe... :-)

This was absolutely phenomenal. We had a 5 pound roaster and per reviews, I adjusted the time up to 80 minutes. It was a hair too much time, but it was all still completely delicious! The skin was to die for and the limited remains are going to make a wonderful stock. I'll be abandoning my other chicken roasting methods for this one.

YES!! ROAST CHICKEN HEAVEN! This is great - I like to add rosemary and a large onion in the cavity. So delicious. My husband and I make sounds when we eat this - that sounds weird - but you know what I mean, the 'mm' good food sounds. Just make this!

Is it just my imagination, or is there no reference here to salting or brining ahead of time? If not, be aware that I've been making this chicken since the cookbook first came out, salting it 2 days ahead (per Zuni Cafe cookbook) instead of brining (per his OTHER chicken recipe, on p. 195) and it really is fabulous. Just unspeakably good. I agree with others on the gorgeousness of it when you hunt out a small and happily raised (not battery) chicken.

Great! I followed the instructions exactly, but instead of adding plain thyme at the end I sprinked on Simply Organic Chicken Seasoning for Grilling (because I didn't have dijob mustard) in the last 10 minutes of cooking so that it wouldn't burn. Exceptional! Next time will try the mustard. After we finished our dinner (we served this with a side of seared rainbow chard) my fiance and I went in and picked apart the rest of the chicken by hand! This is hands down the best roasted chicken recipe I have tried because of the cooking method.

Have made this about a dozen times, with total success each time. I use rosemary instead of thyme, and I usually do the bird for 45 minutes breast down, then 15 minutes breast up. Comes out perfect every time - crispy skin, juicy meat! I do get organic, farm-raised, vegetarian-fed chicken and it's usually about 3 1/2 lbs.

oh yes, so delicious. first time I made it in the oven. it was a 5+# bird. yes it smoked, yes it was amazing. i have since found a place where I can reliably get at least a 3.5#er if not smaller. I now also roast this in a roasting pan on the grill. Smokes, but who cares? Insanely delicious. So easy. Who needs buttah? Perfect just the way it is. Grill up some asparagus while its resting and there ya go. Made some polenta but didn't end up eating it really, didn't need it. Thanks!!!

I figured there had to be a difference in cooking times between a 2-pound and a 3-pound chicken. Mine was 3 pounds, so I cooked it an extra 10 minutes. The meat turned out a bit dry. Also, there isn't that much fat in the pan so I suggest you tilt it slightly in order to gather the liquid fat in the same spot before adding the fresh thyme directly into it. And there is no need for that much thyme either, in my opinion. Half the quantity would do. And finally, don't be afraid to slather LOTS of butter on the chicken pieces.

Loved the Chicken, so tender, so easy. Hated the cleaning. Have never cooked so high for so long, and while the chicken just fell of the bone, it splattered everywhere inside the oven, making it a nightmare to clean. Would make it again but trying it inside a roasting bag to avoid the splatter. Don't know if it will work. Likely it will steam and detract from the objective

Amazing. Highly recommend using a quality bird - organic/free range/etc. - as it does make a difference. This is the only way chickens are roasted in our house!

Make this dish and make it as written. It's surprising how easy and juicy the chicken is. I've done this recipe many times now. If you haven't purchased a kosher chicken, consider brining your chicken if you have the time. Maximum favor for little effort.

I can't say I wasn't warned but it sure was smoky, even with the sacrificial potatoes. However, it tasted great and was so easy - but then really, how hard is it to roast chicken? I would make it again, rotating this with other favorite roast chicken recipes.

Easy and moist, although perhaps could use a few more herbs. I cooked a 5 pound chicken in 80 minutes and used the method of layering the pan with potato slices and placing the chicken on a rack on top. Absolutely no smoke that others mentioned as a problem!

I have become obsessed with the French Laundry at Home blog (read it!), so I ordered the Complete Keller cookbook set. While I anxiously awaited its arrival, I figured this would tide me over. Yay Keller! This is how I'll be making chicken from now on. It was juicy and moist without brining, and it was so much easier than the recipes that require an herb rub and/or vegetable chopping. I put a very thin layer of potatoes in the bottom of the dish (easily cut with a mandoline), and I had no problems with smoking. On the other hand, I also had no drippings to work with, and the potatoes were definitely not edible. I think that the chicken is worth sacrificing a potato, though, and I probably would have found the drippings to be too greasy anyway.

Wow. There isn't much to add to this other than this is the best roast chicken I have ever made or eaten in my life. Meat perfectly cooked, insanely juicy and falling off the bone. I cooked a 4.5# roaster from Whole Foods and it took 70 minutes. One thing the recipe doesn't state is how to know if the chicken is done- 150 on a meat thermometer, or if the juices run clear. I followed the advice of a few reviewers and layered the bottom of a roasting pan with tin foil and sliced potatoes and had no problems with smoke, and it was an easy side too! I will add carrots etc. next time, the potatoes were so yummy. I skipped the thyme, mustard and butter- all not needed with this fabulous recipe!!

I made this for a very pared-down Christmas meal, and it was revelatory! I had a larger bird (4.5 lbs) and was worried the inside wouldn't cook evenly while the outside burned at such high temps, but 75 mins in the oven cooked it perfectly inside and out. Maybe the best skin ever; also tossed some Herbs de Provence in for seasoning. SMOKE CONCERNS: Cheers to the the cook from Silver Spring who suggested potatoes under the bird to absorb the smoke-creating drippings. No smoke to speak of and sinfully delicious veggies! Fantastic recipe!

Very good particularly because of the ease factor, however, we still prefer our favorite roast chicken recipe which is simply rubbed with duck fat, salt & peppered, roast at 425 for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours (depending on size) and baste every 10 to fifteen minutes. Hardly any more trouble but well worth the elevation in flavor.

Fantastic, as hundreds have already pointed out. One slight modification which has served me well: I roast the chicken first for ten minutes on one side (leg down in the pan) and then for ten on the other side before turning it breast up for the remainder. Better browning on the thighs. Use this technique for my Thanksgiving bird, too.

Here is a suggestion to avoid the 'house burning down' element of the recipe. I got this from America's Test Kitchen. Try cooking your bird on a broiler pan. Underneath the grate, place a layer of foil on the bottom(for easy clean up) and a layer of sliced potatoes which have been salted and seasoned as you like. These absorb the grease and cook while the bird does, so you don't get the same smoke. When the bird is done you can lift the foil out and scrape the potatoes off. You may want to paper towel them to absorb some grease. Delicious. (Just don't tell your cardiologist)

Amazing and so simple - this dish will be in regular rotation. I used a 5lb free range bird cooked at 450 for 80 minutes, with a few slices of lemon in the cavity. This dish does not need the butter. The smoke alarms did go off but it was worth it!

I have been using this recipe for over a year. First, I am a wife and step mother to two PICKY eaters, and I have always hated roasted chicken. Not anymore, and my boys ask for it weekly! This is THE BEST WAY!!!! Don't try to improve upon it, it is Thomas Keller, it can't be improved! However, the first time I made it, smoke alarms, filthy-funky oven....and closets full of clothes that smell like chicken ( I actually had to show my husband the other reviews to legitimize that I wasn't trying to burn down the house). I do it on the grill now. I use a heavy roasting-stainless steel pan and turn the grill up until the thermo on the lid says 475. Oh my god, even my hard to please mother in-law who thinks that she is the Jean-Georges of mothers, was impressed. I have even done it for parties (3 ckns) by cooking them on the grill in disposable roasing pans (they cook faster though). This recipe is sooo simple and soooooooo good. Thank you Chef Keller....you are a genius!

Wow! Used Kosher salt and the skin turned out perfectly browned and crisp. The meat of the bird was perfectly done as well, moist with a slight hind of salt. Perfect. Made it last Sunday and just put it in the oven for another Sunday night dinner. Hoping for leftovers this time!

I cannot believe how good and easy this chicken is, this has become a staple in my house. And this is being made with a standard chicken from the grocery store, I'm sure it's even better with an Amish free range bird. We make great gravy from the drippings in the roasting pan since it already has the delicious saltiness. Since there's only two of us, we use the leftover chicken in enchiladas or chicken salad. And of course, throw the carcass in some chicken broth for great stock for risotto.

The BEST roast chicken I have ever made. I can't believe it's so simple. I made it pretty much exactly to plan, but we all have certain variations so I'll give you my exceptions. I purchased a 3.5 lb free-range organic chicken from Whole Foods. I have ethical and medical reasons for only buying free- range organic chicken, but you really must use them for roasting, as they actually taste like chicken. I rinsed the chicken in cold water for a few minutes and then dried it very, very thoroughly with paper towel -- with special attention to the inside of the bird. It was definitely dry. I also trussed my bird with some white dental floss (I didn't have kitchen string) which worked fine. I have never trussed a bird before, but watched a YouTube clip on the web and then it only took me three seconds to do after that. Trussing seemed key for both the flavor and juiciness. I didn't have a roasting pan, so I made it in a pie pan. I used exactly one tablespoon of Cornwall rock salt, which may be too salty for some palates. I am a confirmed salt addict, so I was very pleased. I then ground some pepper over it and sprinkled some Mrs Dash on it. I had no thyme, but the Mrs Dash was perfect. I roasted it in a 450 F oven for 50 minutes without opening the oven door. When it was done cooking I removed the bird from the oven, squeezed 1/2 lemon into the pan juices and basted it for about a minute or so. I let it rest in the pie pan for about 20 minutes

To the Cook from Colorado, yes, table salt is sort of more salty than kosher. Kosher or sea salt have bigger grains therefore a teaspoon of kosher or sea actually has less density than a teaspoon of table salt. Its just like with sugar...you need more raw sugar than you would confectioners, etc etc. That said, this is still the very best roast chicken I have ever made/eaten, even though it makes my smoke detector go off.

Wonderful, easy recipe. I was so worried I'd have trouble with smoke and spitting grease, especially since I have an old, dirty oven. But I just put some sliced potatoes and carrots in the pan, and put a veggie steamer on top of that to hold the chicken above the veggies. (My turkey roaster rack was WAY too big.) I used a 4.5 lb farm raised chicken, cooked it for 80 minutes. To prep, filled a tablespoon with coarse kosher salt and "rained" it on the chicken, it was just the right amount of salt. I didn't buy fresh thyme, just sprinkled a little bit of dried thyme on top of the salt. I put the chicken on the bottom oven rack. Didn't open the oven for 80 minutes until it was done. When letting the chicken rest, I couldn't find my baster so I just ladled some of the juices on top of the chicken. No butter was necessary but the mustard was a nice condiment. It served 4 with just a little bit left over. The white meat was juicy, the skin was crispy, it was truly the best roast chicken I have ever had. Everyone thought I worked so hard...15 minutes of prep, 80 minutes of cook time = so easy and delicious!

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but the skin wasn't as crispy as all the reviews led me to believe it would be. I rinsed and dried the chicken, and then let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before I cooked it. It was an organic/veg fed/free range fellow, and the mean was delicious, but the skin was very salty. I used regular salt, but not more than I thought would be good, but maybe that was the problem. Is kosher salt less "salty," or something? All I had was sea salt, and it is in huge crystals, so I was afraid it wouldn't work well. Any advice before I give this a 2 or 3 fork instead of 4? Oh, also, I cooked with a few slices of potato on the bottom of a square pyrex, put the bird into a veggie steamer and cooked for a little over an hour for a 4.25 lb. bird.

Best. Chicken. Ever. I have become famous in my circle of family and friends for my roasted chicken, armed only with this recipe and occasionally a few extra spices.

I've tried many other methods of roasting chicken but always had problems- underdone chicken, too little flavor for too much effort. This is the only way I make it now. Just came home and I don't feel like breaking down the chicken I have in the fridge but I need to use it up. This recipe is barely harder than calling for takeout and the results are so worth it. Turned my boyfriend into a chicken lover. (I know, who doesn't like chicken?) I plan on serving over large homemade croutons with a salad. I've never trussed the bird and always had good results- I always use a pan that fits the chicken perfectly. Marvelous.

This is a good recipe. However, the smoke generated was so great that all windows had to be opened (it was 95 outside) because the hood vent (800cfm; unfortunately over the cooktop) didn't help.

I put the chicken on a "v" shaped roasting grate that came with my roasting pan, and placed the pan on the unlit portion of the grill. The grill essentially acted as an oven. This kept the heat out of the house (it's hot here in AZ). It was fabulous. I followed the instructions exactly except for the butter at the end. Excellent.

I didn't change a thing, except that I didn't add butter to serve. The meat was so juicy and tasty, it really didn't need anything on it. I didn't believe it when I read the recipe, but it is really the best way to roast a chicken. My husband asked me How is it that you can make chicken taste better than anybody else?

I made this chicken last night and it was absolutely phenomenal! The skin was so crispy I thought I was in heaven. I added a cup or two of water to the roasting pan and this prevented the smoking and splattering problem. Don't think it affected the cooking of the chicken as the skin was very very crisp.

What more to add to a 200 plus 4 fork review? I roasted my chicken in a 12 inch castiron frypan. Three pound chicken required 60 minutes total after preheating pan with the oven. Onion cut in half with toothpicks acting as anchors suspended the bird nicely. Carrots and potatoes in the bottom after 20 minutes. Really was exceptional.

Had this recipe not been written by Uber-Chef Thomas Keller I would have scoffed at it. No butter under the skin? No herbs? But it was revelatory: his is what chicken should taste like. After roasting the chicken I deglazed the pan with some chicken stock, whisked in some dijon, and mounted it with butter. Amazing!

Rating: 4
This chicken is absolutely delightful! So moist and flavorful. I did not put butter directly on the chicken before I served it, but I did put a little bit into the remaining drippings after I basted the chicken. This is definitely my new favorite way to make roast chicken. My husband loved it!

I have been doing this for a long time now, at least one year. Sometimes I trussed, sometimes I didn't... You definitely have to, for a juicier bird. Also DON'T put anything inside the chicken cavity or beneath the skin, I've tried both and it's much better without (especially, don't mess with the skin). The smoke is not that terrible if you put the chicken on the lower part of your oven. Sometimes I've had to tent it with foil, others didn't need to. Don't know what that depends on, really.

This is truly amazing. I have a convection oven, so lowered the heat to 425 and roasted almost (1/2 tbs salt insteadwhich could have been reduce to maybe 1/3 tbs instead) exactly as directed. The meat was very juicy and tender and the skin was amazing!! Better than anything (M. Bittman from NYT included) I have tried before.

Excellent recipe and technique. I was worried about the smoke, and since I needed the oven to make garlic/butter/olive oil potatoes, I cooked the chicken per Keller's technique exactly, but I roasted it on a covered Weber gas grill. Glad I did, and it worked perfectly - just monitor the temp gauge to keep it at 450.

Spectacular, rich results. Rather than messing around trussing with string, I cut two holes in the loose skin at the cavity opening, cross the legs and put the bone ends through the holes to hold them in place. I also usually roast in a preheated cast iron skillet,

Terrific. I put 2 Poulet Rouge chickens (from Whole Foods)at approx 3 lbs each on a rack in my All Clad roasting pan after following recipe exactly-- drying birds, trussing birds, raining on birds--I put in a convection oven, dropped temp 25 degrees, had no splattering, grease or smoke in oven. Tipped roasted birds to drain juices into roasting pan and squeezed juice of meyer lemon into pan, heating and scraping bits from pan and served pan juices with chicken. Rave reviews from guests.

I have been making this chicken for a LOOONG time and absolutely LOVE it ... after much experimentation, I actually cook it on top of a broiler pan, so the drippings fall below and they are less likely to smoke. I have set smoke detectors off, but it is so worth it. I have honestly never even gotten to the butter and thyme ... I keep saying someday I will but it hasn't happened yet. I can't even look at commercially roasted chickens when I can make this so easily and deliciously.

This was one of the most delicious roast chickens I have had... also the very first one I've ever made! (newlywed) My hubby and I just loved it.

All came out fine, but none ever came out as flavorful and moist as this one. And it is ridiculously easy. I put some sweet potatoes and onions in the roasting pan and tossed them in the juices, rather than following the basting step. Can't wait to make this again.

This is great recipe, very easy and loved by my husband. I added saffron and a bay leaf to the seasoning. Regarding cleanup: I put the whole thing on a baking sheet that has holes in the bottom (Anolon Pizza Pan), and put that pan on a foil lined baking sheet. This eliminated spatters and mess as the fat dripped onto the baking sheet. It also circulates hot air underneath the chicken and roasts the bottom.

This is not an unusual recipe and Ive done it for years. High temp turkey roasting is also very good but much more work. Putting things in the cavity defeats the purpose. You may want to try a Vertical Chicken Roaster. Put it in a pan and handle carefully to keep the drippings from spilling. Dump the drippings and live longer. I have not had a smoke problem with this. It also works on the gas grill.

Heavenly! I have never made a good roasted chicken until now! Those with fat-spitting problems should tilt the bird a few times to let the fat drip out of the back of the bird. This is the best chicken I have EVER had!

This was the fourth time I've roasted chicken this way. I'll never go back to slow roasting a bird of this size. The only modifications I make are using a bit more salt and sliding some rosemary or thyme under the skin (and maybe a few cloves of garlic in the cavity). We love this chicken!

I have made this roast chicken three times and every time the result was fantastic. The last time I made it I used an organic and hormone free chicken which we bought from a local farmers market and the result was amazing. Without a doubt your oven is going to be a mess but the end result is worth it. Also, every time I made the chicken it took more than the suggested 50 to 60 minutes. On my last try it took about 1 hour and 20 minutes. All you need is just a food thermometer to make sure your bird is done. This time I made a couple of additions to the recipe. I brushed the bird with very little extra virgin olive oil. Then I grinded some sea salt, peppercorns, and rosemary and rubbed it all over the skin. I also thinly sliced some garlic and put some under the skin and some in the cavity with a branch of fresh rosemary. The end result was fantastic and the skin was delicious and the chicken itself very moist and flavorful. This is by far the best method to roast a whole chicken.

Rating: 3
it is simple and delicious. But like the other reviewer, I found that it made a greasy mess of my oven. I'm not sure it's worth the time spent cleaning up -- especially since nutritionists tell us not to eat the skin, which is the best part of the bird.

This recipe has the honor of being the first meal I cooked all by myself! Other than scrambled egg, I guess. I cooked one boned chicken breast in 450 for 55 minutes. I think I salted too heavily, and I should have shielded the chicken somehow since it was splattering and steaming a lot. At 55 minutes the skin was golden brown. I removed the chicken and basted it a bit, and I ate it. It was a bit on the the dry side, but otherwise quite excellent. Thanks for the recipe.

I used a 3.6 lb Smart chicken, and followed the directions exactly, except after I washed and dried the bird, I let it sit uncovered in the fridge for an hour or so to dry out even more, for a truly crisp skin. I also put the bird on the lowest oven rack, after reading about smoking and spattering issues experienced by others. I cooked my bird at 450 for 1.5 hours - no smoking, no messy oven, no need to cover the skin due to over-browning. It came out perfect, with clear juices, crisp, beautiful skin, and the best tasting chicken ever. I will make this over and over. Simple and delicious! What more could you ask for?

Rating: 1
I don't know how one can get enthusiastic about this recipe. Using the stated directions of a 450 deg oven, even at 1hr and 20 mins, the 3lb chicken was still underdone, the skin not crisp but the oven was a mess. All in all, the recipe produced a smoke filled kitchen and an excessively salty chicken with a browned but soft skin. I am sure that my own poulet roti could beat this hands down.

Rating: 3
This is only part of the recipe as printed in the Bouchon cookbook. The complete recipe in the book starts with a brine step and ends with a gravy. I used the brine, but only brined for 2 hours. I had a lot of trouble with smoke. My guests had to take turns waving the smoke away from the smoke alarm. It was very embarrassing. I'll try again at a lower oven temperature. At this temp, the chicken was finished earlier than expected and the potato halves weren't done yet (even though I blanched them in water first). I had more smoke when I cleaned the oven the next day using self-clean.

This is one of the simplest, most satisfying meals to make. I started making it last January, and it became an almost weekly staple in our house. The meat comes out so juicy that I never feel it needs butter, and the herbs infuse the meat more than any other roasting method I've tried. I think thyme works really well, but you could use any herb you like. Simply fabulous chicken.

I just ate over half the skin before even carving the chicken. And I don't even feel that bad. The skin is AMAZING. I put potatoes and garlic cloves in the pan to catch the juices, and they were some of the best potatoes I've ever had. Next time I'd use thyme, rosemary and marjoram, I think.

Yup, it's awfully good. I didn't truss it, because I was in a hurry, and we didn't think it needed butter. The mustard is a nice touch, though. I did it with Yukon Gold potatoes underneath to absorb the fat (delicious). Papery crispy skin. This will not be the last chicken I roast. Thank you,Thomas Keller.

This is the best chicken recipe I have ever made. I cook all the time (friends always want to come for dinner) so it is not like I have never made a chicken before - but after making this recipe, I felt like I had never made a roast chicken. I have made it twice now and both times were a just little too salty but other than that - PERFECTION - moist on the inside, crispy on the outside. I added butter to the outside and paprika - next time I will try without the butter just to test the difference. The only problem was that I thought I was going to burn my kitchen down - there was quite a bit of smoke - i ended up having to clean the oven (self-cleaning of course) each time- but you know what - this chicken is worth it. I will try using potatoes to absorb some of the grease - hopefully that will cut down on the smoke. Speaking of smoke, I don't know what Judy from NY was smoking, clearly she did something wrong or is just very dramatic. I can't recommend this recipe enough. Enjoy!

I slice potatoes, carrots, celery & onions about 1/4" thick & place on bottom of heavy roasting pan. Put split breasts on top. "Rain" with salt & pepper. Bake uncovered for 1 hour. Let set for 10 minutes. Smear with unsalted butter. Not sure I get the mustard part. Maybe it depends on the type of mustard. No smoke, no oven mess, crispy vegies. Wonderful

I made this last night; it was divine. Some other tips: if you don't have kitchen twine, you can use dental floss for the trussing -- I read this in Cook's Illustrated, tried it, and it works great. Also, after you're done, take the chicken carcass and bones and all of the innards that you took out before you cooked it, dump them in a crockpot with whatever else you have in the fridge that you want to get rid of, pour 8 cups of water over it, and let it cook on low all night. the next morning, strain the stock and put it in the fridge. after a few hours, strain the fat off the top, and voila - easy homeade chicken stock!

My boyfriend and I have made this recipe many times now. We follow the instructions to a T and it is insanely delicious and simple; make salad and you are done with dinner. The leftovers make a great chicken salad for sandwiches. We have made it in three different ovens -- two gas, one electric. The electric one had the smoking/splattering issue, while the gas ones did not. Maybe that's the source of the different experiences? Also the electric one was a smaller sized oven, which may have had something to do with it.

This has become the only roast chicken recipe I make anymore. I'm addicted to it and make it at least once a week! I was skeptical about the butter and mustard and made it for weeks without. Well, I tried it for the first time with the additions of butter and mustard and I can't recommend them highly enough. It's sooo good and at a totally different level. However, it will leave your oven messy with grease spatters. Also, it may be my oven, but I usually cook about a 3-pound bird and it's done in 50 minutes. Actually, I often cook two birds at a time, so I'll have leftovers, and they're done in an hour. I know I sound effusive but it's so nice to find a recipe that's so easy and so good.

This IS a fantabulous recipe! The chicken is definitely gorgeous, as (most) of the other 193 reviews have attested.

Hmmm... the crispy skins!!! yet perfectly done meats! (I didn't truss the bird) Love the simple taste of this roasted chicken (used no butter, no mustard). I used a cheap, frozen regular 5 pounder and even made a mistake by setting the oven temperature too low at 350 degree during the entire 30 minute prep period. My total oven time was 1 hour 45 minutes w/ the last 20 minutes at 400 degree. I had no "smoke issue" even with my dorm oven! I will definitely use this recipe again and practice more.

Vegetarians, beware! This was amazing. I used some of the pan drippings to roast sliced leeks in another pan while the chicken rested. 'Served polenta on the side. Terrific. I recommend the butter and mustard highly. The chicken was delicious on it's own, but the butter-mustard combo punched this up to make-for-company level. I might roast one of these and bring it to my next potluck. It can rest in the car on the way there... MMmmm.

This is simplicity itself. I cook this at least once a week now and use the leftovers in wraps or salads. I used Jamie Oliver's technique and slashed the legs a couple times with a sharp knife to help the dark meat cook faster. TOday I sprinkled some Herbs de Provence, and the skin was fragrant, crisp and lovely. I tossed some celery root and rutabegas in the pan. Not that crazy about either of them, but they were on sale and I'm a broke student. Well, flavored with the pan drippings, they were wonderful

I am sitting here as happy as can be, waiting for the Oscars to start and planning my meal for tomorrow night. . .roast chicken definitely's on the menu. I was very worried that my cheap NYC rental oven would smoke, but followed the fellow reviewer's instructions: I lowered the oven rack, put foil over the bottom rack, and put the chicken over pre-boiled potatoes (and sliced carrots) so the fat would be absorbed. Voila! Not a whiff of smoke! And some damned good roasted vegetables to go with my chicken. The chicken was excellent, even though it was a cheap little Purdue on sale at the Met. The skin was salty, yes, but wonderfully crisp. I never used to eat skin because it was so flabby. This is an excellent cooking trick, so easy, and just wonderful. I want to go buy some kosher salt and try it again to see if that makes a difference.

Amazing! I used chicken pieces because it's what I had. 1 hour in the oven. Didn't put the butter on--didn't want to mess with the crispy skin. I know--I know. Skin is not good for us. But try this skin--so crispy. The fat was all in the bottom of the pan. And carving was a snap! :)

When I first came across this recipe, I really was amazed at all of the great reviews it received because it seems like it would be bland without more seasoning or an interesting sauce/gravy.

This was the best roasted chicken I've ever made! It's an excellent recipe to serve company because it's so fast and simple to prepare but makes a stunning presentation and tastes like it should have taken a long time to make.

I made this last night and everyone loved it! Made it just as instructed. I bought two 3 lb organic chickens from Whole Foods, easy as anything. I cleaned my stove the day before, so no smoking or mess really. I kept them in for a little longer 70 mins, and they could have stayed in longer. I thought they were good, but not as fantastic as all the previous reviews stated, but my family absolutely loved it! My son went back for seconds, and usually he's so picky, he never even eats chicken! I'll make again and cook a little longer and just to get my son to eat!

Excellent--I will use this technique from now on for perfect moist meat and crispy skin. Keller's keys here are to pat the skin and cavity dry first, and to not baste it. Used a crummy grocery store chicken, did not serve it with butter. I did trim the extra skin around the neck and bum cavities though, and didn't have problems with smoke/spatter.

Well, I must say I'm awfully disappointed. I used an ordinary supermarket chicken (maybe that's the problem?) that was over 4 pounds (they don't come any smaller), and followed the recipe exactly, except that I used the poster-suggested potato base to avoid smoking. The chicken cooked thoroughly in one hour (which makes me wonder how a 2.5 pounder could be anything but cremated after 50 minutes). The skin on top was nicely browned, but it was pale and flabby on the sides--so the legs and thighs were not good. (I wonder if the moisture from the potatoes might have caused this.) Overall, the meat was nice and juicy, but very, very bland. I admit I didn't "slather" the meat with butter after serving, but buttered chicken is really not appealing to me--and why should it be necessary to do this? I can think of a lot of roast chicken recipes that are much better than this--even the rotisserie chicken at the market beats this. I suppose I could search the universe for a petite "farm raised " chicken (yeah, right) and try again without the potatoes, but I honesty don't see the point when I can roast an ordinary supermarket chicken other ways and get a much tastier result.

Divine! It splattered during the last half hour of cooking time, so next time - I will lightly tent some aluminum foil over the top for the last 30-40 mins of roasting time. The night before, I made a pan-seared tuna with a ginger-cream shiitake sauce (found on epicurious.com) and served this sauce with my roasted chicken. Unbelieveable. No one touched my gravy because that sauce complimented the juicy chicken. I'm a neaat freak and was a bit upset with how greasy my oven got after roasting this chicken, but after one bite...it didn't matter! I'm looking so forward to having this again. Oh, by the way - I cooked a 10 lb bird using this recipe. It was in the oven (convection roast for 90 minutes). Turned out perfectly!!

I have made this several times, and although it probably the best chicken ever, the oven clean-up is just not worth it.

At 1st bite I thought was that this is the closest thing to battered deep fried chicken I could get but much easier.

I liked it ... but didn't love it! It was exactly as the name says - simple roast chicken - nothing more, nothing less. I followed the recipe exactly, but ended up with a simple roast chicken. I know I'm in the minority here, but I think there are better recipes out there.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but I am so excited about it! I think future reviewers should forego responses to "judyNYC", because I'm pretty sure her posts are a bored person's fiction written just to stir up excitement on the site--I don't believe for a second that three guests actually spit out their food, and who makes a 2.5 pound chicken for four people? Pfft.

Excellent chicken. Had 4lb bird in a convection oven that finished in 60 minutes. Put oven rack on bottom setting to prevent smoking or burning (and wing tips still burnt a little). Also couldn't resist adding very dry, ground, Italian herbs with the salt and pepper.

Lately I've been obsessed with making a good roast chicken. This cooking method does it for me. I even forgot the salt and pepper of all things (too caught up in making sure the bird was dry and oven was hot enough). It was still fantastic. I used a rack in a large roasting pan. Pan drippings were very dark and not that fatty. With giblets, made excellent gravy. Will try butter and mustard next time. Lots of smoke and the oven is a mess, but worth it.

Perfect! Unless baking, I never follow a recipe completely to the 'T'. I always manage to customize it somehow but after reading the reviews I decided that for my first 'go-round' with this recipe I would stick to the directions. I also have never trussed a bird (nor wiped it out with a paper towel) but my-oh-my! what a magnificent and oh-so-simple means of roasting. You can't fail if you follow it step by step. I always buy the already roasted/rotisserie chicken but it's at least $7 for a small one and hit or miss on taste. This was by far better than any I recall ever purchasing pre-cooked and I paid $5+ for a 6lb. roaster. The dark meat is usually my fave because the breast meat is always drier - not this time - the breast meat was my favorite. I saved the bird's juices and ladeled them into ramekins for each person at the table to dip their meat into ... mmmmmmm!! I intend to make this again within the next week.

Had to laugh at this "recipie" (chicken, salt, pepper, hot oven, voila!) but, as I find a good roasted chicken to be one of life's great pleasures, decided to give it a go. What bliss... there's a reason Thomas Keller is who he is. Followed the directions exactly, using what another poster described as an undistinguished supermarket chicken, 4 lbs. exactly. Wiped it dry inside + out, trussed it (first time ever), rained kosher salt and cracked black pepper over, threw some thyume sprigs in the cavity ('cause I happened to have on hand) + put in 450 degree, pre-heated oven. Set timer for 1 hour. Didn't even peek. The timer went off + I removed the most beautiful roasted bird I've ever seen. No smoke, by the way, and that's NOT because my oven was perfectly clean. The skin was crackling-crisp, and the meat was moist and perfectly done. Served with garlic mashed potatoes + fresh, sauteed asparagus. "The boyfriend", a culinary-school trained chef at a very high-end resort, admitted to being humbled. (He of the "Keller just 'ain't all that" persuasion) I left the table filled with excellent food and pride at my accomplishment. A Costco chicken has it's place, but nothing, nothing could beat this beauty.

This was really, really good, but it wasn't sufficiantly better than Costco chicken, and to buy a good chicken for roasting, it was more expensive! Sorry, but I'm not smoking up my kitchen when I can buy it for less at Costco.

I have to admit, I was encouraged by all the reviews, but was skeptical due to the simplicity. Boy was I wrong! This is a classic example where technique makes all the difference. I pulled this recipe up - and had a cornish game hen (just for my husband an I) ready. So I trussed the hen, followed the directions, put it in the oven for 1 hr at 450, and voila! The skin was crackling, salty and crisp. It tasted salty and peppery - but the chicken was moist and flavorful. My husband wanted some pan juices but he thought it was divine. I had NO smoking in my oven...and would absolutely make this again and again.

I am not a fan of roast chicken normally. Kind of bland. But my husband loves it so I made this one. And I will keep making it. I did get smoke everywhere, so I will take others suggestions of using potatoes in the pan. But it was juicy, delicious and incredibly easy.

The hardest part of making this was looking up info on how to truss a chicken. The whole family loved it---and for me, it emphasized the importance of technique over quantity of ingredients!

Ridiculously simple and really delicious (crispy, succulent, flavourful -- everything you want out of your Sunday bird.) This has been my standard chicken-roasting technique ever since I tried this recipe the first time. I've taken converting friends and family to Keller's method with evangelical enthusiasm.

This is the roast chicken I have searched for my entire cooking life. It was succulent, juicy, flavorful, cooked so perfectly I didn't think it was possible. How can you have perfectly cooked dark meat yet still have the breast meat juices running down your chin? Follow this recipe and you will. I followed the recipe pretty much to the letter. I added 10 extra minutes as my chicken was about 3 1/2 pounds. I'm making this again next Sunday, if I can wait that long. *happy sigh*

A bit salty for even my tastes... but it worked like a charm. I've been very roasting-poultry challenged in my life, but this one worked perfectly (even after I discovered I had the oven set 50 degrees to low for 20 minutes). I used a cast iron skillet, put foil over the bottom rack in my oven and had no smoke issues. Drippings made a wonderful gravy.

Rating: 4
I roast lots of chicken and I have used many different methods over time. This chicken was so perfect in its simplicity that I do not see myself using any other type of method. I did not have any of the smoking that some of the other users mentioned in their reviews, and I think that the reason may be that I used a large stainless steel skillet so there was plenty of room for the chicken. I did serve it with a touch of dijon mustard on the side which I think sent it over the top.

Rating: 4
This is one of those recipes that are perfect. It is stripped-down ease coupled with sublime taste and I've never had a dissenting voice, never mind any diners spitting it out like some kindergarten chorus of bad manners. I recommend the recipe be followed as is and I do not bother with the end butter or mustard anymore.

To Judy from NYC, you actually state in your original review exactly what you did wrong: You squeezed lemon juice all over your chicken. This is why you got a rubbery bird. The percise method here is to not "steam" the bird, which is exactly what putting lemon juice on the skin did. This is simply one of my favorite dishes in the entire world. I posted a link to it on my blog and all of the readers on my blog have made it and raved and raved. I buy my birds at Whole Foods and they come already trussed, making it even easier! I have done it with and without trussing and the results are the same. There are a million reasons that I call Thomas Keller "The Man" and this dish is one of them.

I'm wondering whether Judy used a kosher chicken, which is brined and may have resulted in a dried-out salty bird(?) (A kosher organic chicken would be about $14.)

My first attempt at this recipe resulted in a VERY dry chicken. I was extremely dissapointed after reading all the great reviews. However, I realized that the chicken I had used was only 2 1/2 lb.

Having eaten at Bouchon, The French Laundry and Per Se, I was eager to try one of Thomas Keller's recipes. I made it exactly as directed, served it with Dijon mustard, but didn't "slather" the meat with butter. This is probably the best roast chicken I have ever eaten, and the easiest to make. Keller's a genius in my book!

Let me just start off with saying I'm a five-ingredient girl, two of which are always salt and pepper. So when my sister recommended this wholeheartedly, I went for it. I have a very sensitive smoke detector, so I went all out. Opened the kitchen window, left the sliding door 1/4 open, turned on the ceiling fan. I lined the bottom rack with heavy duty foil. For roasting, I used a heavy duty cast iron pan with a small toaster rack to prop up the chicken and collect all that juice for the gravy later. I also sliced up some small potatoes to help soak up a bit of the grease as recommended (to keep splatters and smoking to a minimum). Took note and really wiped that bird down dry before liberally salting (using table salt) and a few dashes of pepper. Did not truss. Put that baby in on the second to lowest rack and turned up the heat (450 degrees for an hour) -which was a good thing, because it was 12 degrees outside (ha) and it was getting chilly in the house. I did peek in the oven once and there was definitely smoke billowing inside (alot), but the precautions I took, thanks to everyone's suggestion, meant my smoke alart stayed silent. Oh my goodness - hands down, simple, juicy and oh so good. This is a keeper! Did not add the mustard, did not slather the meat with butter (though I was dearly tempted). Yum, will make this again and again.

I first objected to roast chicken just a few days after making a turkey, but the skin is crisp, the meat is moist, and everyone licked their fingers. Deglazed the pan with white wine and added thyme and 1 cup of broth I made from the giblets. Finished with butter and served with Perfect Rice and a big green salad.

I had a small (1.2 kg) chicken which I brined overnight with salt and garlic, before draining and drying thoroughly as per recipe. Followed instructions to the letter, thereafter (altho my chicken needed 1 hr 5 min to cook thoroughly, despite small size). Result was fantastic - crispy skin, moist tender flesh, excellent flavour. Best and easiest roast chicken I ever made. Flavour was delicious, but agree that may want to experiment with other seasonings (lemon rinds, herbs etc) for variation; but this method (very high heat, no "wet" marinades to prevent steaming) is something I'll stick with for all future recipes.

You know, I'm not a roast chicken fan. I have found it to be boring and usually dry. I found this recipe to be the exception to the boring roast chicken rule. (Or it could be I have just been lucky lately with good birds.) My six-year old ate this chicken the other day and her first reaction was "This is a 'make again' dinner". Skip the basting at the end if you want crispy skin.

I've been roasting birds for many years, so many that about five years ago my family said no more roast chicken. Reading these reviews made me want to try again. It's true what they say about this technique. Pure heaven. That skin is amazing and the meat so tender. Even the white meat was juicy. My son said he'd eat it every night. I had a lot of spattering but not much smoke. We'll have this again very soon.

Excellent roasted chicken recipe! My guests were on their way over when I realized that my rotisserie oven and my roasting pan were in storage! I had to use a pyrex dish and a cooling rack and this chicken still turned out amazing. I did have the problem with smoke. I lined the bottom of my oven with foil like another user suggested and I was glad that I did as there was quite a bit of splattering. Don't let the smoke stop you from trying this recipe- one bite of the crispy skin and juicy chicken and you will forget all about it!!

Rating: 4
Definitely the best roast chicken I've had. I had no problems with the splatters producing smoke, but, like another reviewer, lined a lower rack with foil. My only regret was that I hadn't planned to have mashed potatoes or make a pan sauce so the pan juices and crunchy bits on the bottom didn't get used. I won't make that mistake again!

Rating: 3
This was easy and very tasty. We used a large roasting pan and put two roughly 3 pound chickens on a rack in it. We had no smoke at all. Followng the thoughts of a previous reviewer, we couldn't see basting the crisp skin. Removed the rack and put the pan on the stove top and deglazed with some chardonnay. Then added the thyme as it reduced. Poured it off, swirled in some cold unsalted butter for flavor and to thicken, a few grinds of pepper and we had a great sauce for the chicken. Judinyc...the skin on the underside of the bird wasn't crisp, but that's normal and maybe would have been if we didn't use the rack, but I doubt it. Sorry you had such a bad experience, but can imagine you'd be reluctant to try again.

Rating: 4
This is the best roast chicken recipe I have ever used. I followed the directions explicitly, and the skin turned out crisp and brown, and both the white and dark meat were moist and flavorful. I also made a simple gravy with the pan juices, a little flour, butter, and broth, and it turned out beautifully. I also used a large-ish pan and had very little smoking. I'm not sure I'll ever be able to bring myself to use another roast chicken recipe.

I made this over the weekend & it was great! I have always been a baker & not much of a cook so this was my 1st attempt at roast chicken. I could not have asked for better results!! I was worried about the smoke stories but had no smoke at my house! I lined the lower rack w/hvy duty foil & put it immediately under the rack that held the roaster -- any splashes or drips (and there were plenty) landed right on the foil. I followed all directions, including the "butter slather" except I didn't baste because I didn't have a baster -I said I was a newer cook! I went simple & served w/steamed brocoli and mashed potatoes -- made gravy for the 1st time too from the pan drippings! Yum! My husband kept saying how good it was. And just because I don't cook much doesn't mean he doesn't recognize a great dish -- we're in the Chicago area & are used to awesome restaurants! I think the gal from NYC ought to give it another try!

I thought you people were all kidding. How can such a simple recipe yield such rave results??? But then, I cooked it...and it is UNBELIEVABLE. Per your suggestions, I trussed and cooked a 4.5lb free-range roaster at 460 for 65 minutes. The chicken came out moist, the skin crispy. I had to ask my husband to get a plate and stop eating from the carving board. My 5-year old (who can be a tad picky) asked if we could have it every night. Yes, it's that good. Just goes to show you what a master chef like T.K. can do with technique. My only modification (when I cook it again next week) will be to not baste the bird after cooking. I am just a sucker for crispy skin, and the basting moistened it. Has anyone tried this with turkey???? Yum,yum.

Can't add to what's already been said, it's as good as y'all said it is. One question comes to mind, though. Any ideas how to prepare the Thanksgiving turkey with this method? Without filling the entire house with smoke, that is?

Ok. I really don't know why this is so special since it is perfectly simple. Maybe it is the salty crisp skin, or maybe it is the way the meat stays moist. But it tastes great and my hubby who is normally indifferent about roast chicken says it's great. So there. Simple and delicious. And not so much smoke if you just open the back door for the last 10 mins.

Yum! The preparation techniques in this recipe really made a difference in comparison to my usual way of roasting chicken. The hardest part was using Internet tutorials to figure out how to truss a chicken, then wrestling with my bird like some kind of poultry dominatrix. Even though I followed other peoples' advice about rack placement, it got a little smokey in the house. Still, the crisp outside and juicy inside were worth a bit of smoke. My dinner guests noticed that this roast chicken was a couple cuts above the rest. Definitely a keeper.

I thought this recipe was too simple to make much of a difference from my normal recipe but it was so very good. I made sure the chicken sat in the fridge for 1 hour and then placed it on the roasting rack. I put the neck and giblets into the roasting pan to augment the pan juices along with some sliced lemons. My bird was almost 5 lbs. so I cooked it for 60 minutes at the directed temperature and then cooked for an additional 15 minutes at 350 degrees. I followed other reviewers' advice and dropped the oven rack one level, foil-tented the chicken for the last half hour and my oven barely smoked. I did tilt the chicken several times to allow the juice to run out of its cavity and to drip into the pan. As for the pan gravy, I lifted out the chicken to let it rest then put the roasting pan on my stove and set it to medium high. After removing the giblets & lemon, I scraped up all those lovely brown bits, mixed in a few tablespoons of flour and added beef broth (all out of chicken broth) which made a really deep flavor to the gravy. I'll be using this recipe again and again.

I made this a little over a month ago, and my fiance has been begging me to make it again ever since. To be fair, the only reason I haven't is because, yes, it made my oven smoke like mad. I am giving in finally and making it again tonight, with the vent running full-blast and the kitchen windows open. JudiNYC, I've been cooking since I was 12, too (yes, in the EARLY 1970's) and am definitely no slouch. You MUST have done something wrong without realizing it - something the best of us do upon occasion - because this is, without a doubt, the BEST roast chicken recipe we have ever eaten, smoky oven and all. Especially if you don't believe it was your oven and there was nothing wrong with your chicken, since I used the cheapie 67-cent-per-pound chicken.

After the rave reviews, I just had to try this chicken. It was indeed very good, with perfectly crispy skin. As others stated, I did not baste the chicken at the end b/c I wanted the skin to stay crispy. It was good, but my god, my house will filled with smoke, setting off fire alarms. I wasn't prepared for all the smoke - I didn't read all the reviews, therefore, missed out on that warning. I'm making it again today for a potluck. This time, I will place potatoes to soak up the oil drippings. The smoke is not caused by a dirty oven (as many reviews assumed), but as one reviewer stated, caused by the spattering of the oil burning off at the later end of cooking.

The chicken came out so juicy my boyfriend and I enjoyed eating it so much! I was surprised how such a simple recipe made the chicken so juicy. We bought a 5-lb. supermarket chicken on sale that day (not farm-raised) and this recipe made it very tasty. I didn't even use fresh thyme. The chicken was bigger than what the recipe calls for but I didn't change the baking and basting time. I had the oven multi-tasked: I poured some olive oil over a clove of garlic (top cut-off) and baked it next to the chicken; I cut a butternut squash in half to bake next to the chicken, too. The creamy garlic went very well with the chicken. The baked butternut squash flesh was blended with sauteed leeks, bacon bits, and milk into a smooth silky soup.

I'm adding my second review of this recipe in order to respond to some other reviewers negative results. (Funny, I almost feel compelled to defend this great roasting technique.) 1) Kosher salt and other coarse salts can vary greatly in terms of "saltiness." For example, ordinary table salt weighs 10 oz. per cup; Morton's Coarse Kosher Salt weighs 7.7 oz. per cup; and Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt weighs 5 oz. per cup. (The variation is due to the differing sizes of the kosher salt grains. The size of the grains affects the saltiness you perceive.) Therefore, table salt tastes saltier than Morton's which tastes saltier than Diamond brand. If you are using Kosher or Sea Salt, know thy salt. It will make a difference. I find that I prefer the less salty Diamond brand in this recipe. 2) The smoke in the kitchen is most likely due to the spattering of the fat from the browning skin onto the heating element. Move the rack in your oven down. 3) Those who really hated the dish seem to have violated the one cardinal rule to making this recipe a success. DRY the chicken. If you add moisture to the outside of the chicken, by squeezing lemon onto the outside of the chicken or adding other liquids, you end up steaming the chicken rather than roasting it and will not get a good result.

This was lovely. Husband and I sat and picked away at it as long as we could stand to. We both stuffed ourselves. So juicy and flavorful. I made a little gravy and baked some potatoes to go with it. Made splendid gravy. I think this was the best roast chicken I've ever made. The perfect autumnal meal!

This has shot to the top of my list as my standard roast chicken recipe. I left the chicken uncovered in the fridge overnight so the skin dried completely out. I also let it come to room temperature for an hour before roasting it. The results were perfect. The skin puffed up and was incredibly crispy and the meat stayed juicy and tender.

This method yields a fabulous roast chicken, every time. Even an undistinguished supermarket chicken, given this treatment, is delectable. It's important that the chicken be dry (if I have time I leave it uncovered in the fridge overnight). Somehow it's never too salty; it's perfect.

My wife is normally the cook in the family (for good reason), but she was returning late from a business trip, so I was forced to take the controls for our dinner party. The simplicity of this recipe made the roasted chicken an easy selection for our gathering. I was a bit apprehensive after reading JudiNYC's review. My cooking debut had our dinner guests assuming that my wife had cooked. One guest described the chicken as "succulent" and another couldn't get over how delicious and cripsy the skin tasted. Given my inexperience in the kitchen, I am not sure how I was able to evade the "unctuous flab of death," but I will chalk it up to devine intervention. This dish was absolutely amazing and easy to prepare. I would highly recommend it to any and all inexperienced, newly wed guys out there, or guys trying to impress on a first date. Who knows, maybe I do have a better oven that the "piece of merde oven" that JudiNYC is using...

Incredible! Roasted 2 chickens, the smaller 3.5lb one was done at 50 minutes and the larger 5lb one was done at 60 minutes. Didn't have a problem with smoke as others noted.

Melinda Lee on 1070 KNX radio (L.A) has been touting almost the exact recipe for years. She calls it Blasted Chicken. However she doesn't truss it(even easier) and recommends roasting it on the rack in a broiling pan after putting sliced and seasoned potatoes in the bottom of the pan. The potatoes absorb the fat and therefore no popping grease and smoke and no dirty oven. Potatoes are crisp and delicious if you care to eat them.

I've been roasting chickens since I was six years old and this by far the most superior method. My husband agreed. When chicken was done, put roasting pan over stove and added shallots. Deglazed with white wine. Reduced, then added chicken broth I had cooked potatoes in. Thickened with cornstarch - amazing.

This recipe made a mess of my oven and smoked up my kitchen but it was EXCELLENT!! Did'nt use the butter-I thought that idea was rather gross but did serve with Dijon mustard and it was magical.

This was incredible! So easy to prepare. My husband didn't believe that it was only seasoned with S/P. The meat was so tender he thought for sure I had used butter. I'm thinking about doing this on the grill next time as it made a mess of my oven and smoked up the kitchen (my dog was hiding most of the night). Any thoughts on the grill? What about trying this with Turkey?

I decided to check back here and see what's up with this vile chicken recipe and WOW! this is one heck of a response. I thank you all for having strong opinions and recommendations. To poufoulet from San Diego on 09/10/06: You stated I needed to invest in an oven. My oven produces amazing dishes -- everything from perfectly roast turkey to brisket and short ribs to angel food cake and plain old baked eggs. What in the world would my oven have to do with how terrible this recipe is? Julia used an old four burner electric! I am way beyond that, but even if I weren't, what would a different oven have to do with a recipe that produced a flabby, salty, gummy chicken when the rest of my dinners emerge from the oven delicious? I have been cooking since I was 12 years old (the 1970s, for those interested). Thanks to all who graciously gave suggestions on how to improve this dish. However, I will never make this dish again. I recommend anyone who is considering it to think about fat, salt, texture and what really truly gives pleasure from a roast chicken -- flavor. I won't curse here, but this treatment of a great bird is pure s--t. By the way, I didn't consider my guests at all rude. Honesty is the best policy. I would rather hear it from the choir than have anyone discuss bad food -- especially my roast chicken -- behind my back.

Poor Judi! I had to scrounge up my user id, too, so that I could join the others in letting you know to try this recipe again. This is the easiest, tastiest chicken ever (although I've never tried your sofa cusions :). ) I changed nothing, had no overly smoky kitchen (I did use the exhaust fan on high the whole time based on others' comments, and my oven was recently cleaned). Sorry, too, about your guests' poor manners. Maybe they'll see all these postings and realize how boorish their behavior was.

Delicious and easy!!! To the cook Judy from NYC - try this again. To be fair to you, the instructions are deceptively simple. "Rain" the salt implies using a lot. "Sprinkle" would have been more appropriate a term. Indeed, if you actually measure out 1 Tbsp and use it to salt the entire chicken, it is not so much. I think you literally "rained" the kosher salt on. Yes? This would explain the over saltiness. Regarding the greasy consistency: what kind of oven to you have? Serious question here. A piece of merde oven will ruin even the best chickens and cuts of meat. Did you really have your oven at 450 degrees? It doesn't sound like it, which would explain why your chicken didn't crisp. A cheap oven thermometer will tell the truth. It sounds like you may need to invest in a good oven.

This was sooo easy, sooo good! Smelled so good while cooking. I read through all of the reviews & found almost no "I added/changed/deleted". That told me all I needed to know. judinyc---I can't imagine what happened. Other than you may have invited the wrong friends to dinner that evening. Spitting out the chicken? Stopping for pizza? Sounds like they have far more elite taste buds--and manners for epicurius.com. And for the idiot that said it tasted like chicken---how is chicken supposed to taste? Like steak?

JudiNYC, I'm sorry this didn't work for you. I would be mortified if this had happened with guests. But I've made this chicken 3 times and so has my sister. Everyone has loved it. Something must have been wrong with the chicken you purchased or your oven temp.

JudiNYC you must have done something seriously wrong because this is the best roast chicken ever. I have made it several times and guests have raved.

I just went to the trouble of retrieving my user name and password so that I could post here regarding how absolutely horrible this chicken tasted. I have never posted a negative comment at epicurious.com, but this chicken is so spectacularly awful, I must do this. I purchased a $14.00, three pound organic chicken to prepare this recipe. I followed the recipe 100% according to the directions. The result? A salt mine of tasteless fat. Thank God I have three cats who will eat anything. My friends were not so forgiving. Why is the thyme optional? If I had not added thyme, my loveseat cushions would be far more satisfying. I am thankful for my base knowledge of cooking. I had the foresight to squeeze fresh lemon all over this unctuous flab of death. I served three guests tonight. My guests actually spit out the chicken -- on to their plates -- in front of each other -- and in front of ME! The remainder of this crap was fed to my cats. ALL OF IT. I wouldn't even use the bones or "jus" for another recipe. All is just oily flab, not food. Even as I am typing this, my lips are greased with tasteless chicken fat. My guests left hungry, save for Ben and Jerry's and my peach pie. I am embarrassed, humiliated ... worse even since one of my guests stopped for a slice of pizza on the corner. How dare you! In the past, I have trusted Bon Appetit and Gourmet magazines with my culinary life. I have been a subscriber to both magazines for nearly two decades. This foul fowl concoction needs to have another look. I am not sure who is reviewing it here, but I am certain, these are not folks who have anyone to feed but their cats.

This certainly lives up to the accolades... and I actually did this with a thawed frozen chicken and had very low expectations b/c of that. I followed the directions exactly, and had to slap my hand to keep from spreading butter or olive oil on the skin. I made sure it was very dry and just used sea salt and pepper. I did put a few sprigs of rosemary and thyme in the cavity. My chicken was closer to 5 lbs and it cooked perfectly at 450 (convection) in one hour and 15 minutes. The oven was indeed very smokey and a mess. I recommend keeping some windows open when you start and making sure your ventilation is cranking. I actually put a cookie sheet under my roasting pan to catch some of the spatters and prevent them from hitting the heating element. That seemed to help a bit and didn't impact cooking temp/time b/c I was using convection. We were in the mood for mashed potatoes, so we made gravy. Just poured off all the fat and drippings and deglazed with sherry. I then added back in defatted drippings and some broth and thickened with a butter-based roux. Added in some chopped fresh rosemary and S/P.

This is simply the most perfect roast chicken imaginable. I've made it several times and am always amazed by the simplicity and the taste. My children love to help out with this one too, rinsing & drying it, trussing it and picking it apart when it's finished. I love Mr. Keller's commentary... about the chicken butt and how you'll start w/ a knife and fork but end up eating it with your hands. It's all very true and now my children fight over the butt! One word of caution, however: The high heat necessary to creat this succulent bird causes the biggest mess I've ever had in my oven. Everytime and no matter what I do. Not to mention, my home fills with smoke (caused by the splatter... even if you tent w/ foil after the bird browns). I just finished cleaning my oven and although my house still has that lingering smell of burnt fat, I still will make this chicken again. Oh and I highly recommend the butter and dijon mustard... yum!

Rating: 4
Not that this recipe needed another "thumbs up". I just thought I would add my $.02. Minutes ago my family gobbled down a 4 lb chicken in minutes with no leftovers! Easy & tasty. What more does anyone want from a recipe? I followed the recipe as written except my chicken was larger than advertised. Because of this, I roasted it as described but after the sixty minutes were up, I lowered the heat to 350 and let it cook an additional 15 minutes. PERFECT. I added rosemary and a squish of lemon to the standing juices before basting the bird with it. Yum. That's it, that's all.

OMG! This recipe is simple, but simply the best roast chicken I have ever had...and everyone I prepare this for agrees. After following the recipe everytime, one time, I added fresh sage and a tiny squirt of fresh lemon jucie...delicious as well. Either way, this recipe is guarantee just as it is, or if you add your fave herbs to the sauce!

This was a good cooking method and produced a lovely chicken. I served it with dijon mustard but not the slather butter (there was enough fat), and it was just delicious. Adding the thyme was a great addition. As a side dish I made 'Brussels Sprouts and Chestnuts with Blue Cheese' from this site, and it made a wonderful (southern hemisphere) winter meal. I did experience a fair bit of smoke coming out of the oven during the cooking process, even though my oven was thoroughly cleaned a fortnight ago. Perhaps this was because I used a fan-forced oven and it was probably hotter; or because I used sea salt instead of kosher salt; or because of the string I used to truss the bird. However, the smoke didn't effect the flavour.

After discovering this recipe I see no reason to ever make chicken any other way. It's both as simple as it gets and as good as it gets: the skin is perfectly crispy,1 and the chicken very moist-- you can pull the legs and wings right off it easily by hand. Why settle for less?

Rating: 4
Sometimes the simplest dishes are the best. Over the years, I've roasted many chickens. I've made recipes which involved starting the chicken on its breast side down and then turning it over. Recipes where chickens were brined, tented with foil, basted, or rubbed with a variety of oils or butter. Recipes that involved turning the temperature up and down during the course of cooking. But this set it and forget it method made a moist and perfectly roasted chicken. (Not to mention allowed me to focus my efforts on the side dishes). The high temperature and thoroughly drying the chicken... along with the trussing, sealed all the juices in. Suprisingly, basting the chicken with the thyme infused juices during its 15 minute setting time, allowed the flavor to penetrate well. I plan on experimenting with this recipe, in terms of seasoning under the skin or the cavity with various herbs and spices. But, I will keep the cooking method the same. Delicious!

Magnificent! Made 2 chickens(4lbs or so each) & put on rack in roasting pan. Roasted at 475 for 20 minutes per early comment re the same recipe from his cookbook. Got nervous & went to 450. Roasted longer 15-20 minutes because bigger chickens. Like many others, ate dinner at the counter. No butter or thyme, didn't care. Ate almost half a chicken(dijon on the side)plus skin. Deglazed & saved all of the drippings(fat removed) to make gravy for leftovers. Absolutely out of this world gravy!!! Made a roux & didn't dilute with broth or very much water. Can anyone tell me why not using a rack is better? I like it for ease & did rotate the chickens (breast to back) once. Completely done & still juicy! Maybe perfection comes from the right sized chicken cooked by this method. Still, mine was as close as I have ever, ever been to perfect roasted chicken.

I waited over a year to try this menthod for roasting chicken only because I just couldn't believe something this simple good be good. I WAS WRONG! Way wrong! This produced a perfectly crispy skin, golden brown outside and juicy inside. And I just used a basic 4 lb fryer from a discount grocery store. I added 15 min to cooking time to compensate and it was just right. As for smoke - I clean my oven MAYBE once a year (I know.) and I had no trouble at all.

In my 20s, I decided I was done with chicken. Bored. Been there. Done that. Never needed to cook it for company again. Please; how can something that costs $2/lb. be worthy of my guests? Then, thankfully, I saw this recipe, read the chef's name, and thought, "Well, OK. I'll try it." My husband and I have since been eating one of these birds on a weekly basis. The skin. My god, the skin. I could die. So, the biggest problem now is that I don't want to SHARE the chicken with my guests. Company's coming? Let them eat filet mignon. The best stuff is for ME!

It was so good I stood there and ate both drumsticks while it was still hot from the oven and on the cutting board. The high heat gives you such a crisp, tasty skin. No need to bother with mustard or butter, and I added thyme but it didn't seem to really need it.

I was looking for a roast chicken recipe to make during our blizzard today and was drawn to this one as I had dined at Bouchon in September 2005. Agree with everyone else, this is so simple and absolutely delicious. My oven was relatively clean though not spotless and I had no problems with smoke. I NEVER eat the skin but had to try it after reading the other reviews. It was awesome!! Can't wait to make this one again.

A MUST try!!! Please count me among the converts - I was very dubious about this very simple method but tried it because of the other reviews I read. I cleaned my oven first - thank you all! - and was thrilled when a perfectly juicy, flavorful and FRAGRANT chicken emerged from my oven. The house smells wonderful!! I must admit, we didn't even make it to the table - we stood at the counter and feasted on the bird with our fingers right off the cutting board. I will share this recipe with all the cooks in my life.

Fixed this for my visiting Brother and we devoured the bird entirely...no leftovers at all! Don't know what to tell the cooks with smoking oven problems...I had no smoke at all. Clean your oven first? Again, the simplest, easiest, most flavorful chicken I've eaten!

I'm roasting my third chicken in as many weeks using this method. My oven is trashed and smokes like crazy. I keep saying to myself, "I'll make one more chicken and THEN I'll clean the oven." But I know I'll want to make another chicken next week, it's that good. (I have a second oven that I use for everything else. Maybe I'll just keep this one dirty so I can keep cooking chicken!) I love having the cooked chicken on hand to make sandwiches, Chinese chicken salad, chicken enchiladas, whatever sounds good at the moment. When this chicken comes out of the oven, no one in my family can stop eating the crispy skin right off the poor guy. Even I eat it, and I haven't eaten skin in years because of the fat.

I couldn't get excited about this one. Even adding additional cooking time to account for the 4 lb chicken I used, it still seemed undercooked to me. But what was really problematic was the cleanup!

This is not really as much a recipe as it is a method, and boy, is it a good one! I've made it twice in the past week, and both times my chicken was just wonderful. I made gravy and no one even used it, as the meat was so tender and flavorful.

I thought I'd reviewed this already, but haven't, and it definitely deserves it! The only thing I did differently was to increase my oven to 470, and it may be that my oven is off (need to get a thermometer). Otherwise, don't change anything. I felt slightly guilty about buttering the finished product, but I bow in thanks to the previous reviewer who explains that most of us use butter anyway, just before we cook. With the butter and mustard, my mouth is watering just thinking about it! What a wonderful, simple dish!

I've been making this since I first read the recipe in February, and it is truly awesome. It's a good reminder that great food does not need to be complicated. I adore the salty, crispy skin! Had my 4H group do 2 chickens to test techniques--one at high heat roast, the other at the typical 350. What a difference! But, some of the kids did prefer the softer, more 'stewed' texture of the 350 bird. Like other reviewers, I don't need the butter at the end--but it is just like the icing on the cake! Not necessary, but very yummy.

This is really a terrific recipe, quite full proof as written. Use a good quality chicken! This recipe succeeds in its simplicity because it assumes a flavorful chicken whose potential is waiting to be realized. Proper trussing is also key, and I hope to go from using yards to mere feet of butchers twine sometime soon :) Enjoy!

Ok. The smoke has cleared (see previous posting) and the chicken has been eaten. It was definitely great, and worth the smoke fiasco. I think it would have been even better if the smoke thing hadn't happened, because I had to open the oven a few times and I also lowered the heat to 425 at one point in an effort to lessen the smoke. Even though it was exactly 3 lbs, I had to cook it for about 20 min longer before the thermometer read the correct temperature. Anyway, miraculously, the flavour of the chicken wasn't affected and it was still nice & juicy w/ crispy skin. I will definitely make this delicious chicken again, but next time I will check first to make sure my boyfriend hasn't been cooking frozen pizzas without a tray under them, resulting in a disaster at the bottom of the oven!

Well, I am writing this in a house filled with smoke. Here's a very important tip that no one has mentioned (maybe everyone is a better housekeeper than me): make sure your oven is clean before beginning!

4 forks! Highest rating! 4 forks! Highest rating! OK, Epicurious has not so much provided us with a recipe here, but rather an incredible COOKING METHOD. I am about to roast our, um, 5th chicken in 3 days now (usually we have a roast chicken once a month-this should tell you what a great thing we're on to here now...), based on what I've easily learned from this God-like person's instructions. Forget hours of marinating, basting, etc etc etc at lower heat--I now realise it doesn't matter!! I used to to waste hours of time marinating, basting, cooking whole chickens at lower temperatures --never again! You should just pre-heat your home oven as high as possible and blast the bird for 50 minutes, (covered the whole time with a loose V-shaped foil tent on top of it; then let it sit for 10-15 minutes after the cookiing is done! (trust me--it's difficult to get a home oven above 450-490 degrees F.--especially if you are popping the oven open fromn time to time to do side dishes in the oven at the same time). Anyway, at the end, SKIP the step where it tells you to pour the drippings over the just-cooked bird, that just makes the chicken skin less crispy. Anyway, this recipe + Roxy Music CD + wine == HEAVEN!!!! Anyway, we are again drifting off into bliss with Roast Chicken and Roxy Music and Squeeze's Greatest Hits, those of you who don't get it can just go get a george foreman grill and uselessly steam good food; please; otherwise please listen to this great Epicurious recipe

The only reason I made this recipe is because it's Thomas Keller's. The only reason I'll make it again & again is because it's AWESOME! Slathering the butter at the end actually makes a lot of sense- I normally rub it under the skin, & it gets lost in the pan. With this recipe you use a lot less butter. PS. PER SE is heaven on earth.

this recipe was amazing. i've never roasted a chicken before and it turned out absolutely perfect. my housemates and i devoured it right out of the oven (40 minutes, then tented with foil for an extra 20), no basting or butter required - though the dijon was amazing with it. i made a great gravy with the pan drippings, just adding some corn starch and chicken broth (and i'm using the carcass to make some wonderful-smelling chicken stock now!)

Rating: 3
Without the glowing reviews, I never would have thought that something so simple could actually work; with them, I gave it a shot and am glad I did. The skin was like brittle paper before the basting, so I may leave well-enough along next time and use the liquid some other way. (Not the only way to roast chicken -because so many flavors are begging to be introduced- but a great exercise in minimalism.)

The oven will require immediate cleaning but this dish is worth it. I used a 4 pound free range chicken and it was ready in 50 minutes (in the book he tells you to cook at 475 degrees and check after 40 minutes). This recipe also doesn't tell you to check and rotate the chicken every 15 minutes if it is not browning evenly and/or to lay a piece of foil over it if browning too quickly but the recipe in the book does. My husband are not large people but we managed to consume "all" but 1 breast....

This is an incredible preparation for chicken -- truly revolutionary for the home cook. I was fortunate enough to receive the Bouchon cookbook as a gift, and some of the most fantastic simple (yet very rigorous and committed to detail) recipes are contained within. Particularly amazing is the brined chicken counterpart to this recipe. Too many recipes try to mask the flavour of the principle ingredient. Here, Keller puts chicken on a pedestal and surrounds it with a heroic supporting cast. Fantastic.

A perfect roasted bird, and the perfect meal for anybody on a low carb diet. I just ate at the original Bouchon last week, and am always impressed by the dedication to perfection with which Keller brings to simple food. Who knew that slathering the meat with butter could be so good? This recipie results in incredibly juicy breast meat, mainly because the bird is cooked under high heat for a short period of time, until it's just done. I will continue to use Keller's methods in the future, and found that cooking the bird at 470 for about 50 minutes works even better...crispier and jucier.

REALLY easy and very delicious. The simplicity belies the strength of this roasted chicken recipe. The chicken was moist and flavorful, the skin nice and crisp. Yummy!

The cook from Vancouver will never know how perfect this recipe is.How sad.

I actually had this recipe at Bouchon's here in Las Vegas and enjoyed my home cooked version more. I did not use as much salt as called for, perhaps only 2 teaspoons and I defatted the drippings and deglazed with a white wine with about 2 tablespoons of butter for the sauce. It would have been great even without the butter reduction. I agree with a previous reviewer that this is a wonderful basic technique and will use it as the foundation of all my roast chickens in the future.

There's a reason Keller is the number one chef in America. This is the most basic recipe in the world, yet his techniques make all the difference. By far, the best roast chicken I've ever had- and I didn't even add the butter at the end. I'm so sold on this recipe, I'm buying the book today. Can't wait to visit Per Se.

Useful advice on trussing. But how can you take seriously a recipe for roast chicken that asks you to "slather the meat with butter" just before serving?

I made this mostly as written but added a cut up lemon to the cavity and it was awesome!!! I loved the way the skin made the chicken so juicy. Will make again and it is so easy!!!!
