My coworker cooked this recipe for me a couple of months ago and it was fantastic, Since, I adapted a similar recipe that I found which included cherries in the compote and I actually thought that had an was even better texture . I also prefer on the bone pork so it worked great with frenched bone in pork chop - also makes for a nice presentation.

I had enough rhubarb for 1/2 recipe compote and it was enough. I did the combo sugar and honey. 1 T ground pepper was plenty peppery for me. I used fresh sage in the marinade. I made the lemon herb orzo recipe to accompany and it was good. Lots of fresh oregano.

This recipe is fantastic. Too bad it doesn't say anywhere where this recipe was originated from. It came from Anna Pump and it is in her book Summer on the Plate, which is a great book, by the way. For the compote - in the book she uses less sugar, 1 cup and 1/4 cup of honey and 1/2 of water. It is so much better this way - just a perfect balance.

Super delicious! Agree that water's not necessary for the compote; I just washed the rhubarb, cut it up, and covered with 1 cup sugar, allowing it to macerate in its own juices, stirring occasionally, for 3 hrs. Disagree that tenderloin takes longer to cook, as long as you're starting with room-temperature meat. Plan ahead!

A fancy dish, great for a dinner party, that's amazingly easy to make. I use frozen rhubarb to make the compote when I can't find fresh. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Tonight will be my third time making this dish this month, except without the rhubarb sauce. What an easy way to prepare the pork tenderloin. I found the timing pretty close for cooking it, but adding maybe another 2 minutes total. I just usually cook one tenderloin but put the entire marinade on it, grinding the peppercorns with the fennel seeds. Last time I sauteed up some mushrooms ahead of time and then cooked them in the same pan as the pork after I had removed it, adding a bit of chix broth, cornstarch and fresh sage to make a gravy to spoon over the pork and some roasted potatoes. It was heavenly! Tonight I will be adding roasted butternut squash, cooked brown rice and fresh sage to the pan afterwards to soak up the leftover spices. Can't wait to try this combination.

I was looking forward to making this based on all of the great reviews. Sorry to say I wasn't in love with this. It seemed to be lacking something. The pepper seemed a bit too much, and the compote a bit too sweet although I did reduce the sugar as other reviewers had suggested. I did really like the pan searing preparation, however. Very convenient.

Loved the flavors of the fennel and sage. The pan-searing is a great time-saving alternative to roasting, which is what I usually do with a pork tenderloin. Red currant jelly makes a fine accompaniment if you're pressed for time. Any kind of sauteed green would make an excellent side (I had spinach). The cooking time seemed right on the money to me.

Everytime I make pork tenderloin I consider trying a new recipe but always end up making this one. My family really enjoyed it with the balsamic cranberry sauce (another epicurious recipe.) I do agree with others that it takes much longer to cook than the recipe suggests.

I have made this dish twice exactly as instructed and wowie. So impressive and so tasty and so easy!

This dish is beyond delicious - it has wonderful subtle flavouring - you would think the pepper would overwhelm it but it gives it a smoky bite that is not overwhelming. I forgot to buy fennel seed - and so had to scrounge - added a spoonful of Ouzo to the marinade and another spoonful to the oil. I consider that minor as the slight fennel flavour was certainly there. It does seem to take longer to cook than the recipe implies - it took us a good 10 more minutes to get it to the right temp - it was tender and juicy. I used frozen rhubarb to make the compote and added some heather honey for the sweetness. It was heavenly with the pork. Served it with butternut squash risotto.

Tasty dish, but took much longer to cook than stated, easily double.

Made this exactly as directed, but "marinated" the pork at room temp for about an hour before cooking. Everyone loved it, even my fussy teen. I found the rhubarb a little bland (I cut back on the sugar a bit), but my husband said if it had any more flavour it would have overpowered the pork. Will definitely make it again.

Excellent! Quick, Easy and Delicious. I used a date sauce I purchased at an Indian market as I couldn't find Rhubarb. Magnificent!

I forgot to add that I just lightly marinated the chops with white wine, brown sugar, salt and pepper and didn't use the spices for the tenderloin recipe. - Delicious

I made this with pork chops and it was WONDERFUL! Forget the applesauce for a summer dish and use the rhubarb.

Pork & rhubarg combination works well together...I'm not a big fan of fennel seeds, so I would reduce it by half next time. The black pepper was also a bit overpowering - again, I would reduce the amount. The pork tenderloin was a cinch to cook, and we're enjoying the leftover meat in open-faced sandwiches (with the compote as a condiment).

Excellent and easy. Don't skip the compote; it's an unusual taste combination and only takes a few minutes to prepare. You can cook the rhubarb in the microwave in a large bowl covered with lid or cling wrap--less time stirring.

This was delicious - the pork was tender and sweet. I cooked it on the grill instead, and it was wonderful. Served with rhubarb compote to guests who kept asking for more. No leftovers!

Simple, fast and savory (even for an unskilled cook). I adhered precisely to the recipe and this dish has been a two time winner. This will definitely make it into the rotation of stand by recipes.

I'd never cooked tenderloin this way, but I loved it! It was a perfect last minute meal; a quick and easy crowd pleaser. I didn't have the ingredients to make the compote. Luckily the pork didn't need it. The meat was moist and juicy.
