Absolutely delicious even without the Mojo sauce. I made a few changes though: Added 1&1/2 tsp red pepper flake, used vegatable broth instead of chicken because its what I had on hand and I layered the bottom of pan and top of meat with additional sliced onions before cooking. I cut the baking time by 20 minutes and I deep fried the pork after braising. Crisp little bits of fried pork that were so juciy on the inside. Served this with Rice cooked in black beans and tostones. My husband found the mojo sauce to be a little to much for his taste so I reserved it to use as a marinade for Mojo chicken wings. marinate wingettes overnight then cook under broiler for about 15 minutes turning once. delicioso!

Really good flavors. I followed other recommendations and browned the pork first. I also used about 1/2 cup oil in the sauce. That was plenty.

I made this along with some cuban saffron rice, and it was delicious. The pork itself, cooked in the broth and garlic, was a little bland but the addition of the mojo sauce really made4 a huge difference. I added about 4 sliced onions to the pork in the oven, because I'm used to having cuban pork with heaps of onions.

Muy deliscioso. I only used a quarter of the recipe and it was so real and authentic and delicious tasting. The only thing I missed was un pico de hot pepper. Does anyone agree with me? And maybe a finish of lime juice?

Wehn I lived in Miami, I ate at this restaurant all the time. Cooking it brought back fond memories as the house filled with the smells pork and garlic. Easy to make and loaded with flavor. I did not care for the Mojo sauce, but it was great without it. Next time I will make 2-3x the onions...as they realy added to this dish.

We eat at a nearby Cuban restaurant often and I always wanted to be able to make the pork dish! Now I think I can say "I can make that" I cut the recipe in half for two people. Used only half the pork with all the broth and garlic recommemded. Because everyone talked about browning the meat after (which seems SO painful) I browned the pork pieces in a little oil before adding the broth and other ingredients. It seemed to work just fine, although I checked the meat after one hour and all the broth had cooked down. Had to add another can. The meat came out perfectly, tender and flavorful. But I added some of the mojo sauce when cooking down the broth and that's when the recipe really came together. Start with just a little, adding more to suit your taste. (Even used the mojo sauce when cooking down the onions and garlic) This is NOT a recipe for persons timid about garlic.

Very delicious flavor - my latin mother-in-law loved it. How's that for an endorsement?!?!

Great recipe. It takes a while to prepare, but it's well worth it - the pork comes out very tender, the garlic taste is great, and the mojo sauce is quite yummy. I used leftover mojo sauce as a marinade for chicken, which was also very tasty.

I loved this recipe. Have been looking for a healthier way to cook my country style ribs, and this is it. The pork is very tender and flavorful. We finished it on the BBQ - a little bit crispy on the outside, moist & tender inside - delightful. Try serving over a bed of fresh spinach, sauteed in the mojo sauce!!! Fabulous!

Excellent!

Served this over Carribean Black Beans & Rice--it was fabulous! Instead of adding the onions & garlic on the plate, I added them while I was rewarming the pork & stirred them into the sauce a little. I also used the Mojo sauce as a salad dressing over a simple green salad. Great, easy meal!

I think Plano TX got a little impatient, or a little too retentive on the recipe. Conditions, measuring etc. can make variations. As it was, I had to let the reduction go until it was a little less than what looked like 1 1/2 C.(and did anyone REALLY pour it out and measure it?) So perhaps it should read reduce to desired consistency (which in my case was slightly thinner than what I wanted the finished product to be).

Having read the reviews, here's what I did: I let the liquid cook down and then browned the pork quickly in the pan to give it a more appealing color. I served the pork with tortillas, avocados, and sliced tomatos and drizzled the sauce in/on/over it all. The sauce is delish. Banish any notions of it being a barbecue type-sauce. Think of it as a vinaigrette and you won't run out of uses for it.

The mojo sauce was great and the meat was very tender. It did however look unappetizingly boiled so I browned it a bit before serving. Just, if you have people like I do who are bothered by garlic choose another recipe. The effects were startling.

I have used other cuts of pork and that works very well. One of the best receipes I've found online.

Although this recipe takes an entire afternoon, the work is definitely worth the work. I love the distict mix of flavors. I used a tangerine for juice instead of an orange, which made for a really tangy mojo sauce. This is my husbands new favorite recipe. But since there is only the two of us, I divided the recipe into fourths--much easier to manage. We thouroughly enjoyed it. I've also used just the braised pork as a base for pot pie--rich and delicious.

The pork tasted like boiled meat, and the mojo sauce was runny. For all of the work with the sauce (squeezing all of those limes in particular), I expected more. However, the sauce made a great marinade for chicken (that's how I used the huge amount of leftover sauce).

This made a very good meal. BUT when I make it again I will cut way back on the amount of oil in the Mojo Sauce (be more than half). My family really liked the sauted onion and garlic toppping so I will have to more than double that part of the recipe. I served the pork with moros y cristianos (black beans and rice) and yuca. This recipe will be a regular meal around our house!

I made this dish with a change or two. After baking the pork, I sauteed it along with the onions. Then, I added a bit of the mojo sauce along with the reduced liquid from baking to the pork/onion mixture and let it simmer a while. I think this added more flavor than the dish may have otherwise had. Served with yellow rice and enjoyed. It was quite good and flavorful. Used the remaining mojo sauce as a marinade for chicken which I baked later in the week.
