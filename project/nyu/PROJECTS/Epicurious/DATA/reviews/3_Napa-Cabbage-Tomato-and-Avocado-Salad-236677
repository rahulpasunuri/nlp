This was delightful. I added some pine nuts for texture. I thought it was a good salad, everyone at the party thought it was amazing.

Perfect salad for those hot muggy summer days. I like the light refeshing dressing. I did double the mustard and used stoneground.

This was a complete waste of ingredients, my husband even refused to eat it. Absolutely awful!!

Invite to last minute dinner party. Asked to bring a salad. Had a napa cabbage from the market that morning. Made the recipe. Quick, easy and good. Not the most amazing, but certainly great in a pinch or when you have a napa to use.

Very colorful, very easy, all the way around a win. When tomatoes are in season, adding different colors can do wonders, too. I thought this was very visually appealing as well as salubrious! I have friends that are anti-cabbage and this turned them around quickly.

Bright and summary, an excellent alternative to cole slaw - and a great way to introduce cabbage to the cabbage- phobic. Also pantry-friendly (the ingredients keep well) and easy to whip up quickly if you're short on veg.

Boring and not visually appealing.

Made this for the first time, and people kept on talking about it throughout dinner. Nice and light.
