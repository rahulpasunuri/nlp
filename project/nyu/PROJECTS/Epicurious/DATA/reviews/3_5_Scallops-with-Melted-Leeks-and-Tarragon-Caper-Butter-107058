absolutely wow. best if you go light on the cream sauce when plating.

I'm mystified. My husband and I love leeks. I have tons of them growing right now in my garden and we eat them all the time. This was just way too leeky and it overpowered the mild scallops. I admit I did not do a "pretty" job of cutting the leeks because I thought they where supposed to melt together anyway. But my sloppiness showed, since despite condiderable additional cooking time, they never melted. Maybe my leeks were too fresh or too firm of a variety?

Excellent recipe with a lovely mix of flavors. I followed the recipe exactly and wasn't disappointed. A perfect dish for impressing guests and pleasing family. Highly recommend.

Excellent! I was looking for a way to use up extra leeks, and I love scallops - this was a huge hit. I used a muscadet for the sauce, and strained out the shallots and herbs before adding the cream. I also cooked some squid ink pasta I'd been hoarding. The result was beautiful and delicious.

outstanding! As said, the leeks take a lot longer to "melt" but it is well worth the wait. Do not skimp on the Capers they are fantastic! This is a keeper.

Lots of pans, lots of work, lots of cholesterol...but it is all worth it. 10 out of 10 !! By the way, I love capers and normally increase the proportion. This one does not need an increase.

A first rate recipe, but it does take much longer than 4 minutes to melt the leeks. The sauce worked fine with less butter added to the reduction. A wonderful addition; a mild but tasty blue cheese (Fourme d'Ambert) on rounds of French bread.

I actually didn't eat this dish - I am a vegetarian, but I made it for my husband for Valentine's Day. I put a poached egg over the leeks with the same sauce for myself and thought it was great - my husband loved the scallops. If I were to make it for company (and I would), I would serve it as either a first or second course and might decrease the amount of sauce.

Though this took a fair amount of time to prepare, the results were incredible. The leeks were a perfect bed for the scallops and the sauce. I would definitely serve this for a dinner party!

hmmm, I found this to be really easy to make and a great make ahead for a recent dinner party. 3 pans was all I used. The wine butter sauce is amazing! I made it 3 hours in advance up to the point of whisking in the butter and herbs, this I did right before serving. The leeks do take longer but that is normal for 'melting', I cooked them over med for about 20 minutes making sure not to brown them. Then I put them on a plate covered with seran again 3 hours before. I heated them in the microwave just before plating. I seared 2 large scallops per guest instead of sauteing. This was served as a second course and was wonderful, a bed of melted leeks, the seared scallops and a drizzle of sauce.

I really liked this dish. The grocery store was out of thyme, so I used a dash of dried thyme instead of fresh. I served the scallops and leeks over linguine. The capers add a nice salty bite.

Although yummy, I found that there were too many leeks compared to scallops. It was a nice summer dish, but I'm not sure I'd make this a staple in my household.

I agree with every comment made before: the leeks take a lot of time, the wine requirement is pretty major (I just use a cup or so and don't boil it down as much: I like lots of sauce?) -- but I have made this many times, just messing with it. It seems to me that if you know how to saute leeks and cook scallops, you can't go wrong: the flavor is marvelous. It does dirty every pan in the house, though-- she's right about that, too!

Made this last night to bring to a dinner. I made the leeks ahead of time (they took much longer to cook to the correct consistancy than the recipe says) and reheated them in microwave to serve. Made the sauce and capers ahead and just added the butter at the other house. Then, kept it warm while cooking the scallops. The result was delicious, everyone raved. I would certainly make again, but sprinkle the capers on each plate, instead of adding them to the sauce - they all sunk!

Just divine! I didn't change a thing. Definitely elegant and very different. An unusual combination of flavours that make a meal exciting. I would, however, do 1 1/2 times the leeks next time, with just a bit of extension on the cream to accommodate.

Served this at a party and everyone loved it. But, it took a longer to melt the leeks. I doubled on the sauce since I had more scallops than the recipe called for, so, maybe that's why the sauce also took longer than expected.

This recipe is fabulous! Had no cream on hand so used 1% organic milk, had no tarragon so doubled up on the fresh thyme and (lazy cook that I am) did not strain the sauce. This is definitely a keeper!

Sauce had a wierd taste to it. Scallops were wonderful, but there are many more recipes that could do them justice. Overall, a pretty blah recipe and not worth all the fat that goes in to the dish.

OMG this was so delicious. It was just a Wednesday night dinner and it is definately "company" food. I wouldn't change one thing on this recipe. I didn't have the right side dishes and I wish I could have had something more complementary to this. But oveall, FABULOUS!

I can't wait for our next dinner pary to serve this. It was GREAT! I did not think it was labor intensive at all considering the capers and sauce could be made in advance even though I was only making it for two people. I can see where it might be labor intensive to try to put it together for a dinner party of 6 or more. The leeks "melted" for me in four minutes. I also think the leeks could probably be melted in advance and than zapped in the microwave before serving). I will also try broiling the scallops next time to see if it is comparable since that would be a lot easier than sauting them if you wanted to make this dish for 6 or more.

This a wonderful recipe - perhaps a little involved. But the results are certainly worth it. I agree, it took longer to melt the leeks than the recipe suggests and I added additional water. This would make a lovely first course or light supper. It is very rich, but just delicious.

Very tasty--I was too fearful of fat and probably cut butter and cream a bit too much. Simmering leeks till tender took much longer. A nice combination of flavors.

This is now one of our favorites. It seemed like an awful lot of leeks but they just melt in the pan and in your mouth. My husband couldn't get enough of the sauce.
