Very tasty, but more importantly, very very very easy. It was *almost* possible to make this with a toddler hanging on my leg the whole time, but I needed help to be able to operate the oven and keep him safe at the same time. I made lots of minor changes based on what we had: I used country-style Dijon substituted for all the mustard, panko crumbs instead of French bread crumbs, and half the sugar as recommended by others; and, I used a 1.15 lb piece of coho salmon as a whole piece, not cut into individual filets. I cooked it for about 16 minutes, could have been a minute less for our taste. Would have been nice to get the panko a bit more browned. Even so, delicious!

The crust is delicious and light. The fish was moist and tasty. My husband loved it and I went back for more.

I tried this b/c I am always interested in pantry cooking. However.. even though I am a fan of mustard, I found the mustard crust to be pretty gross. I used less sweetener than suggested and replaced sugar with honey. Panko crumbs. Served it with rice with pine nuts, currants, and shallots. A weird combo, but I mostly just ate the rice. Not one that I'll be repeating. My significant other loved it, however.

Tasty and easy. I didn't have any dry mustard, so I used a combo of whole-grain horseradish mustard and Dijon; I also used only 1/2 tbsp sugar and slightly less than 1/4 cup of olive oil for the sauce. I made my own breadcrumbs out of some whole wheat bread ends for the topping, and finished the fish off with a minute under the broiler. I'll definitely be putting this recipe into weeknight rotation!

super simple and delicious! I will definitely make it again. Due to some dietary restrictions and what I already had avail in 'stock'. I made the following substitutes: -agave syrup for sugar. -sprouted spelt bread crumbs for white bread crumbs -apple cider vinegar for white vinegar

This recipe is a fabulously easy and delicious entree! If you're looking to impress dinner guests without a lot of fuss, this is a great choice. It's also easy for a weeknight and will make you feel decadent and spoiled - but without the effort! Recipe is foolproof in my experience. Just keep an eye on fish since varying thicknesses of the fillets may require monitoring as to not overcook thinner fillets.

Great... you can even use plane mustered if you don't want to make the sauce. Panko is definatly better the bread crumbs don't toast as well, and watch the baking time. Cooking for 18 min was too long.

great recipe! super simple.

This is our default "easy" salmon recipe, since we usually have all the ingredients stocked in our cupboards. I prefer panko for the crunchy texture. All in all, a great weeknight meal that takes no time at all.

Whoa! Looked great, made the sauce ahead, then decided to read the reviews (duh). After seeing so many advising to use half the sugar, I stuck my finger in for a taste. Definitely use half the sugar. I dumped it and made another batch of sauce. Much better.

We loved this dish after we modified it slightly. Reduced the sugar by half, substituted vegetable oil with olive oil and used the panko as someone else suggested. It was just wonderful! Seved it over a nice salad of mixed baby greens.

Rating: 3
This has quickly become a standard weeknight fish recipe for us, and we have also made it for guests. I would say it is not an exceptional recipe per se, but a very good and very easy dish to prepare. We use panko crumbs as they give a nice crunchy texture, but I imagine freshly made breadcrumbs would also work well. This is a recipe you just finf yourself making over and over, because the ingredients are "stock", in that you usually pull out what you need from your existing provisions.

Salmon needed about 5 more min. to cook through, and definately reduce the sugar by half. Kids hated topping, ate the salmon.

YUM! This was very easy and delicious. My fiance who does not really care for salmon really enjoyed this preparation. I used fresh thyme, corse grained Dijon and dried Progresso bread crumbs. Nice crispy coating too!

My 12 year old son and I really enjoyed this recipe. He helped with the sauce and I baked per instructions though I used only 1 salmon filet- a two pound piece- the taste was mild and pleasant and the bread crumbs added a nice crunchiness. Also used fresh thyme instead of dried.

I thought this salmon was incredibly good. The salmon was cooked perfectly, not dry at all. I prepared just as stated, however, I did substitute rice wine vinegar for the white vinegar. Thanks from northern Chester county!

I used fresh coho salmon, and really enjoyed this recipe. I did make a few alterations because of what I had in the cupboard: cider vinegar instead of distilled white, spicy brown mustard instead of dijon, olive oil instead of vegetable, dill instead of thyme, and dried breadcrumbs. Okay, so I guess I changed a lot of things, but I believe the essence of the recipe to be the same. I did have to bake it for about 22 minutes, and then turned on the broiler for another 2 minutes to make the breadcrumbs golden. Served with a brown rice salad. Will definitely make this one again. Oh, and be sure to reserve some of the mustard sauce to drizzle over the fish after it comes out of the oven.

Rating: 2
A good, simple recipe. Personally, I'm just as happy to eat poached or grilled salmon, but this recipe is good for "masking" the salmon for those eaters who aren't keen on the fish. Each time I've made this I've improvised by using less sugar, combining grainy and dijon mustards and using flavoured vinegars to give more oomph. I find dry bread crumbs are better than fresh.

Easy and tasty.

This was yummy -- my changes: I used a light syrup in place of the sugar (has a nice, subtle sweetness), hot sauce in place of the vinegar and fresh dill in place of the thyme and a little drizzle of olive oil in place of the oil. For the bread, I used the Earth Grains International Hearth Bake and Serve French Bread. A little fresh lemon juice is a nice touch after cooking.

After reading the other reviews, I reduced the sugar to one teaspoon (could have put in a little more) and I also substituted white wine vinegar for the distilled white vinegar. It was good!

Living here in the Seattle area, I am always looking for new and creative ways to prepare salmon. This one is a keeper!!

Definitely quick (as most fish recipes are) but certainly nothing special. I served this with roasted potatoes and sauteed carrots. Might do again for a hurried weeknight dinner, but the fish is not something I would go out of my way to make again.

I have made this review multiple times. My wife, who is pretty picky, loved this dish and got seconds! I've tried different mustard sauces, but I like the honey mustard best. Great sweet taste that's perfect for salmon. Goes well with other fish too.

Nice alternative for salmon - I have made this for family and well as for my dinner club and all have enjoyed. Some reviewers felt there was too much sugar - I actually prefer the sweeter taste as it contrasts nicely with the mustard.

Rating: 4
SO easy and delicious! I found that using less sugar, as suggested by many of the cooks, was to our tasting as well. Sometimes I use Pepperidge Farm Stuffing Mix and crush it in the food processor to save time - it works very well. I also brown the fillets under the broiler for a minute if the crumbs don't seem dark enough.This continues to be our favorite salmon recipe!

This is yummy. I think two tablespoons of sugar is too much...made it the second time with much less. Really good, easy.

This recipe is simple, and we loved the crunchy bread crumb crust. I cooked the salmon for about 25 minutes because the fillet I selected was quite thick. My only comment: use less sugar! I didn't see the early comments from users who suggested less sugar, and I was disappointed that the sugar taste was so strong.

I thought this was decent but nothing fantastic. My parents didn't like it much but my husband said it was quite good...so I guess on the whole there were pretty mixed feelings. Ultimately I think there are better AND easier ways to prepare salmon.

Simple, tasty, the crumb topping is a nice contrasty crunch vs. the salmon. Definitely will make again.

This is a good recipe, although I have had to make some changes to make it work well with Steelhead Trout. Thyme has no business being in this recipe, IMO. It makes you feel like you're eating a pizza. I've added dill in replacement of thyme. Also, if you're REALLY in a pinch, you can substitute Potato Chips for bread crumbs, only reduce the oil in the sauce if you're going to do this. Also-Also, remember to bake the fish longer if you have a really thick fillet.

Very nice. Easy and delicious. Doesn't really need the bread crumbs if you don't want to bother getting the food processor out. The sauce is nice on chicken as well (for those children who refuse to eat fish). Enjoy!

Fabulous! Crushed up seasoned Pepperidge Farm stuffing mix for the crumbs (about 1 1/2 cups of cubes is sufficient to make 1 cup crushed) in the food processor, put them in a bowl, and then made the sauce in the processor rather than the blender. I followed the advice of several others below and halved the amount of sugar overall and doubled the sauce recipe (saved the extra for next time!). Also used apple cider vinegar instead of white distilled, and for the dijon mustard used half Grey Poupon country dijon and half Maille dijon. Opted for olive oil rather than vegetable oil. Served it with steamed asparagus and steamed rice with chestnuts.

As quick & easy as it is, it's really not good enough to make again. The strongest flavor to come through was sugar, but without the sweetness I think it would be very bland.

Have made this dish a dozen times, but with only half the sugar. I use about 1/2 cup of Progresso Italian style bread crumbs -- just sprinkle them on top (rather than press them in) until the filets are nicely covered. You don't need to gradually pour in the oil to make the sauce, either. Just throw it all in the blender and whirl for 15 seconds and you'll get a mayo-like consistency. This is an easy, quick and wonderful dish, fit for company.

I tried this with apple cider vinegar and cut back the sugar. I didn't measure the oil so my sauce was thick like mayonnaise and I used the Sunny Spain seasoning from Penzey's instead of thyme. Run it under the broiler to brown a bit; fine for a quick weeknight meal.

I'm a college student who doesn't do much cooking, but when I went home for the weekend, I made this dish for my family and they decided I should become a chef!! I thought it turned out wonderful and it wasn't too sweet (like the other reviews said).

Absolutely disgusting! This recipe doesn't even deserve a rating of 1. I rate this a big zero. The sauce tasted like mayonnaise - Feh! If this were the first time I ever ate salmon, it would turn me off to salmon forever. Because it was so terrible, I threw out the whole thing and my husband and I had to make something else for dinner. For those who want a great recipe for salmon, try the "Spicy Grilled Salmon Steaks With Black Butter" on this site, and you don't even need to make the black butter - the spice rub is stupendous on its own and needs nothing else!

Rating: 3
This dish was really fantastic. Not only delicious, but quite beautiful when served. I agree with another reviewer to double the sauce recipe but CUT THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR IN HALF! It would have been much too sweet with the amount of sugar called for. I was glad that I made a double batch of the wonderful sauce....we almost finished it off! Even my 10 year old daughter loved this dish! A definite make again in our house!

This recipe is so simple if you keep a bag of frozen bread crumbs in the freezer. I made the sauce as written, but didn't pass it at the table. I thought the salmon was incredibly moist and the bread crumbs and sauce made it sublime. My company and children agreed!

I too found this dish to be very tasty. However,I used seasoned bread crumbs. Could that have been the reason why 18 minutes weren't long enough to brown the crumbs? I helped it along by pouring a little melted butter on top. I will definitely fix this again.
