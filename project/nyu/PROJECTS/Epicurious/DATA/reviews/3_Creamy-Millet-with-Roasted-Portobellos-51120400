I've been exploring millet recently, as it's very healthy and also alkalizing for the body. Despite some of the mismatched flavor combinations in this recipe - Gorgonzola and Pecorino? Nutmeg with herbes de Provence? - I was intrigued enough with the basic idea to try it. As a trained chef, I never follow a recipe exactly (other than baking), I just like them for inspiration. I made some changes (namely increasing the Pecorino and omitting Gorgonzola and the nutmeg). In the end, delicious. Good texture and taste. The kale heaped atop the portobellos was very nice. A satisfying entree for vegetarians and omnivores alike.

I HATE cooking turkey. I'm not vegetarian but I'm going to make this for Thanksgiving - just me and hubby this year. Although I'm going to put it on top of mashed sweet potatoes rather than millet and use spinach for the filling rather than kale. Wish me luck!!
