I made this soup WITHOUT rice and cream to cut calories and it taste just as yummy. By may calculations the calories per cup when excluding rice and cream is 248. When blending in batches I blended 2.5-3 cups at a time for 3 min each (I always set timers for blending). Spooning through strainer is a great idea and I will enjoy soup this way, but a lot of bisque's have little bit in them and a lot people don't mind their soup that way. The discarded waste left in strainer is minimal. This recipe took exactly 2 hours 26 min from start to finish using all the necessary cook times in the recipe. Kind of a long cook time but well worth it!

Time consuming but worth it. I used an immersion blender to blend and did not strain - don't think you need to.

This was a really tasty soup. Just making the stock put fabulous aromas in my kitchen. :) It was a bit of work but worth it. SOOOOO good! Even my picky 15 year old daughter loved it!

Amazing! I too used a hand blender instead. I made as is except I used dried thyme as I had no fresh thyme. Instead on adding cream into the soup, I swirled some cream round the chive/shrimp mixture once soup was in bowl. Beautiful presentation. I would maybe go a bit easier with the lemon juice next time(I think 1 tablespoon would have been enough). This is an elegant and delicious soup!

I have made this over and over again and love it each and every time. Wonderful.

Don't bother with straining if you have a good blender. Saves time and preserves all that good veggie and shrimp base.

I loved this soup and so did everyone I served it to. I made a couple of changes though. I used the immersion blender prior to adding the shrimp and there was no need to strain the soup. The rice gave it a very silky texture. I then added the shrimp to the soup and simmered it a while longer. Excellent!

Preparation time for this soup takes longer than my other standard vegetable soups. However the time invested was worth it. I added some tobacco sauce to add more "zing" to the soup and it was a hit amongst the dinner guests.

So delicious! I didn't have cream on hand but it really didn't need it. Very rich and flavorful without!

Delicious restaurant quality results. I substituted the brandy with cream sherry. Highly recommend

This is restaurant quality delicious. I think the best way to make this earlier is to ensure you have a stick blender (cuisinart smart stick for example). I also passed the time peeling and deveining shrimp on the phone with a girlfriend -- easy and fun. I didn't have brandy so I substituted cream sherry.

Although somewhat labor intensive, this recipe yields a wonderfully rich, silky bisque. With a simple salad and some crusty bread, it is a satisfying meal. As a first course, I would cut the serving size due to the richness.
