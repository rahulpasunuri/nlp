Deliciously simple and surprising. Instead of ancho chiles, I substituted diced green chiles and threw them in after sauteing the onion and garlic down some. The result was a near-perfect blend of flavor considering the recipe is composed of relatively basic pantry staples. Served with homemade pita chips for some crunch!

They were good. Hubs said they were good for beans. I toasted the chiles & cumin seed (thanks) & used pintos I had cooked from dry beans. I'll probably make them again. I might mash the beans & refry. I was a little disturbed by the "separateness" of the beans and the sauce.

These were really tasty. I used dried beans (soaked and cooked) and toasted and ground the cumin seeds before adding them in. They were a big hit with my family and I will definitely be making them again.

I thought these were OK, nothing special. I used dried beans instead of canned.

Wonderful recipe! I couldn't stop tasting it as it was cooking. Someone mentioned they taste like "Ranch Style," and they do, only better and cleaner. This was the taste I've been looking for, and the Ancho chiles are what give this recipe its gusto. I used dried beans (1 lb.) and doubled the recipe (1 lb. dried beans = 6 cups cooked, = 4 15oz canned - google it!). I also added two pounds of browned ground beef. Otherwise I didn't mess with it. Cook cracker! This is my new "go-to" pinto bean recipe.

I've made these several times and am always glad to have the leftovers lingering for a few days. I've put them on omelettes, mixed them into chilli, and over rice with chopped raw onions, sour cream, lime and fresh cilantro. With dried beans they have a fresher taste. Rather than chicken broth I use the broth from the beans, which were cooked with a little salt and a small onion. I also toast the anchos and the cumin for extra depth. Bueno, bonito y, barato!

This recipe was great. Changes I made were based off of using dried instead of canned beans. I soaked the beans overnight, drained and refilled the water in the morning. I had not means to puree as the recipe suggested, so I just added the dried ancho chilis directly to the pot along with all the other ingredients. Let it all cook until the beans were tender. Then removed the tender ancho chilis and chopped them finely and returned to the pot. I also skipped the chicken broth; just the water was fine. We ate with burritoes the first night. The next day it was even better and I used it as the base of a beandip that called for canned refried beans...AMAZING!

Wonderful! Try adding a couple spoons each of tomato paste and beer. It sounds strange but tastes fantastic.

3+ forks (I only give 4 forks to really outstanding stuff). For the effort, these are really tasty I thought. For those who thought they tasted like they were from a can, maybe that was the canned beans? I'm sure they'd be better with dried, but who thinks that far ahead! I added a squeeze of fresh lime at the end and some cheese. Solid side for all kinds of stuff. Mild enough for kids and those without tolerance for heat. If it turns out to be too spicy for you, mix in some sour cream at the table.

I used dried pintos - soaked for a couple days, cooked for about 45 minutes. I didn't need the chicken broth. These beans are delicious!!

This is now my "go to" bean recipe. These were absolutely fabulous. Only changes I made were 1-1/2 tsp. cumin powder instead of the cumin seed, and I only used 1 cup chicken broth. I served alongside Whiskey Steak (Epicurious April 2008) and Spinach, Corn & Roasted Pepper Salad with Chipotle Dressing (Epi, Nov. 2000). I can't wait to have the leftover beans today!

These were good, but honestly, they tasted almost exactly like "Ranch Style Beans" from a can. I thought so, and my husband said he thought so too but was afraid to mention it for fear of offending me! Now he says these were a little better. Good thing we like the Ranch Style beans!

This is so flavorful. I had a Mexican themed dinner party and used these instead of traditional refried bean and everyone raved about these. I gave the recipe to three of the guests. I used leftovers as a main dish mixed with rice.

These are the best pinto beans I've ever made. I used pasilla chiles instead of ancho, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.I saved the leftover broth and used it to braise leftover carne asada, which was also good.

Easy, delicious and SO much better than beans out of the can. I sprikled some cotija cheese on top before serving, and the saltiness of the cheese nicely complimented the spiciness of the beans.

I used ground cumin and this recipe was a super hit. I am originally from California and love the flavor of authentic Mexican flavors! Everyone raved and it will be a staple. Try it with the pork carnitas tacos featured. Equally delicious!

Well-flavored beans but 2 tsp of cumin seeds is a lot -- the flavor dominated to an uncomfortable degree. I went one step further and made them into refried beans by simply adding a bit of broth and mashing the beans. To add insult to injury, my husband thought these were out of a can.
