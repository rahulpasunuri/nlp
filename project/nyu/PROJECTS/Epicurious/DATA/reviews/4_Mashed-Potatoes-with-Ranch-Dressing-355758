Very rich, very tasty. The only changes I made were to use one clove fresh garlic minced + some salt instead of the garlic salt and a bit of minced shallot instead of the onion powder.

I was skeptical, but other reviews convinced me to try this. Wow! The final dish was fabulous, and the ranch dressing leftovers were awesome.

Decadently fabulous!

These were quite tasty! The potatoes don't have an overwhelming Ranch flavor so they blend well with other foods, even those with strong flavorings of their own. I had never used a potato ricer before, but it imparted a really nice texture to this recipe. The potatoes reheat beautifully in the oven without drying out on top.

First served these at Thanksgiving and they were such a hit that the same folks got them at Christmas! Everyone I have shared the recipe with loves the flavors plus the ability to make,keep,and rewarm without ruining the potatoes.

This was lovely and appealed to everyone. I was also concerned that the flavors may not marry well with those who like turkey gravy but the potatoes were excellent! I would recommend making the dressing one day ahead as it allows the flavors time to develop.

Good recipe. It's simple and adds a nice flavor to ordinary potatoes.

I am making this for Thanksgiving and like to try out the recipes ahead of time. Was concerned this might have too much going on to also put gravy on the potatoes. However, this was very good and the gravy will just make it all teh better! Plus the buttermilk dressing is excelelnt and I saved separately for just h aving on salad.
