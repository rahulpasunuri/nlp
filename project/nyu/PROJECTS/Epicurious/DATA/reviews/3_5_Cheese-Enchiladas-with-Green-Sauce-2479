Great results for a dinner party. I followed the recipe almost exactly (the corn tortillas were fresh and easy to roll so I didn't fry or steam them) for the vegetarian guests and added some chicken for the others. Everyone loved it and some even asked for the recipe.

Great recipie and like most reviewers I made some modifications. - used coconut milk vs. whipping cream - Added half a jalapeño to the sauce to kick up the heat - used the whole 4oz can of diced green chilies vs. half - instead of adding sour cream to the sauce I added Greek yogurt to the cheese mixture (making it creamier) - used Queso Fresco instead of Monteray Jack Plan to make again.

I have made this recipe about 3 times now and each time it has gotten better! It has so much flavor and is fairly simple to make and not too time consuming. I tend to like more bulk inside my tortillas though, so I would recommend to also add a can of black beans, tomatoes, corn, and cabbage to the filling mixture, and if time allows, some cooked spanish rice. To the sauce mixture, I also like to add a can of diced jalepenos. I layer the bottom of my pan with some green salsa and top my servings with some as well.

Aweome flavor, but I tweaked it a bit. Doubled the spinach * added torn chicken breast meat * heated tortillas on an open gas flame * added granulated garlic & onion to the sauce * used 1/4 heavy cream to 3/4 2% milk * added an extra cup of cheese *used light sour cream.

Great! The green color is really eye catching. Like almost everyone else, I used whole milk instead of cream, fage greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and cut back on the butter. I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, but in hindsight I think the frozen would have been fine. I doubled the spice, tripled the cilantro, added fenugreek, and used extra green chilies - it could have been even heavier on the green chilies because the milk drowned them out. I added about half of a sauteed onion and one giant clove of roasted elephant garlic to the sauce before pureeing. I steamed the tortillas instead of frying them (fry them, really??). I went crazy with the veggie stuffing: roasted yellow peppers, sauteed onions, grilled zucchini and mexican squash, sliced avocado, mushrooms, corn nibblets, and roasted butternut squash - and I used a roasted chicken from my local grocery store. I highly recommend the butternut squash...a bit of sweetness with the sauce is perfect. To me, the additional veggie stuffing is key. If you only stuff these with cheese and onions I think they would be a bit heavy/gross. I ended up with a ton of sauce and will freeze half.

This was so good, so easy, just make that sauce ahead. Used fresh spinach, threw it through the food processer... Very good

This was so easy and SO DELICIOUS! For those of you looking to reduce some of the high saturated fat and calories, I substitued Cultured Coconut Milk for the whipping Cream and Fagi (Fahee) Yougurt for the sour cream. I also added 1 can of chopped tomatoes and 1 chopped onion that had been simmered to soften. I put about 2/3 of the total green sauce over the enchiladas and reserved the rest in a bowl. This kept the dish with enough kick for those who can't handle kick and an extra bowl for those who wanted more!

I made this for an apres ski dinner (I made the whole menu from the original magazine - i wish that epicurious would post the salad recipe that went with this meal as it was outstanding and I can no longer find my feb 1995 issue). anyway the enchiladas were easy and delicious and well liked by everyone form kids to adults.

I think this would have been super delicious if I'd made it in its original fatty glory, and would not have needed anything extra, since all that cream and cheese would be very flavorful. With the various health-focused changes I made, it was quite good but needed some more oomph, as others have suggested--maybe garlic, more heat, etc. Major changes I made: 1.75 c whole milk instead of the milk and cream, 1/2 the cheese (for both filling and top), and the addition of sauteed orange bell pepper, squash, and mushrooms to make up for the lost cheese in the filling. Used about 10 oz. of fresh spinach, just thrown right into the sauce, and 2% greek yogurt instead of sour cream. This really is a good inspiration, and I'm sure I'll be trying it again with more tweaks.

I forgot to mention, I also don't cook the tortillas in oil. It seems totally unnecessary to me, and it adds so much fat and prep time. I'm no health nut, but with all the cheese this dish is plenty rich.

Rating: 4
I make some changes to this recipe to make it healthier. I would never make it as is. The fat content is through the roof, and it's delicious and fairly rich even with the changes. 1. Replace the whipping cream with milk (I've made it with whole and skim and can barely tell the difference) 2. Cut the cheese in half and add some cubed chicken breast instead to fill the tortillas. 3. Use whole wheat tortillas (I guarantee no one will notice the difference) 4. Use olive oil or vegetable oil instead of butter in the sauce 5. Omit the sour cream. I really don't notice its absence. The dish is plenty rich without it. 6. Double the spinach for more sauciness and more healthiness. Everyone LOVES these even with no cream, no butter, no sour cream and less cheese. I also have some notes on the prep: 1. It always takes a lot longer than 5 minutes for my milk mixture to thicken, and to get it to thicken at all I need to turn the stove up to medium high (this was true even when I used butter instead of oil) 2. A stick blender works great and is so much easier than putting the sauce in the blender in batches. 3. I use raw spinach instead of cooked, and find it cooks down in the pan with the sauce very nicely. Just stir it in. This recipe takes some time so I always make a double batch and freeze one in portions. Everyone from my 2 year old to my husband to my in-laws rave and I make it every other week or so.

Rating: 4
This was SO good. Took the advice of other reviewers and added other veggies to the filling, as well as sautéing the onions and adding 1 small jalapeno (will add more jalapeno or habanero next time) Used the whole 10 oz. package of spinach, 1 % milk and 1/2 and 1/2 cream, and actually thinned out the sauce more with a little vegetable broth. Accidentally read the amount of cumin as 1 1/2 tablespoons instead of teaspoons, but it was not too much. Try this recipe!

Rating: 3
Following a number of reviews, I made a bunch of changes to add flavor and use up a bunch of veggies. For the sauce, I used swiss chard instead of spinach, all milk (no cream), and added a chopped jalepeno, some garlic scapes, chili powder, and lime, and omitted the coriander. Salting the sauce properly seemed important: 1 tsp Kosher. The filling was cheese + sauteed beet greens, chicken, and chard stems. I dipped the tortillas in sauce to soften rather than doing the oil step, just to save time. Basically, a great concept: green sauce plus versatile cheesy filling. I will use this as the basis for many improvised dinners, which to me makes it a keeper.

Rating: 3
I've made this quite a few times and think it's tasty as is, especially as part of a buffet. However, I now make it with the following changes - make 1 1/2 times the white sauce and use the entire package of spinach and the whole can of chilies. Add sauteed mushrooms, squash, and corn to the filling. The extra vegetables add a lot of texture and help cut the richness a bit. This is a lot of cheese! Also steam tortillas and use regular milk.

Rating: 4
Very tasty and pretty easy. While I made the sauce, I roasted 2 zucchini and steamed the corn tortillas (wrapped the stack of tortillas in a dish towel, placed in a steamer basket over boiling water, covered, turned heat off after 1 minute and left until I was ready to make the enchiladas -- skipped frying in oil entirely. The corn tortillas definitely added a very nice flavor to the finished dish). I used ~1/2 of a 7 oz. can of diced green chilies in the sauce; for the filling, I sauteed 1/2 cup red onion in a little oil, then added the rest of the green chilies, the rest of the spinach, the diced roasted zucchini, and the cheese. The recipe makes a lot of sauce, but it thickened up nicely when cooked and was very yummy -- mild, but great flavor. Served the enchiladas with some beans and rice and it was a very filling, substantial dinner. Will definitely make this one again.

Rating: 4
This was wonderful. I took some of the most popular tips from other reviewers and it all worked great: - all milk and no cream - skipped the sour cream - added chunks of chicken breast Other things I did differently: - Used cooked, fresh spinach instead of frozen - Skipped the cooking of tortillas in oil. Just adds fat and the sauce is wet enough that the tortillas were plenty tender. I thought about cooking the onions before stuffing the enchiladas but they actually added a nice bit of crunch.

Rating: 3
I am an enchilada fan and thought these were great. I mixed the onions cilantro and cheese together, along with 3 chopped, cooked chicken breasts before filling the tortillas. I used fresh flour tortillas which were great. I did not fry the tortillas in the oil beforehand to save some time. These took a bit longer to prepare than I had anticipated. I did make ahead and chill in the fridge for about 12 hours. It made about 10 generously filled enchiladas.

Rating: 4
Really, really good! Read prior reviews and made the following changes: - sauteed about 4 cloves of garlic with the butter - poached 2 chicken breasts, which I cut up - used whole can of chilis instead of half - switched amounts of jack and cheddar (3 cups jack, 1 1/2 cups mild cheddar) - mixed cheeses, chopped chicken, onion and cilantro together - put entire mixture inside enchiladas and then added more cheese on top (my family loves cheese) - used flour torillas. Sauce did taste bland when tasting it alone but combined with the enchiladas, and served with extra sour cream and pico - it all came together beautifully. I will definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
Thought this dish was great - the changes that I would make next time would be to add all the spinach and perhaps some jalapeno for kick. I also thought there was too much sauce. I think I will pour on half the sauce and use the rest for dipping chips into later!

Rating: 3
Overall a good recipe with a lovely flavor, if adjustments are made: the sauce needs more chilies and crushed red pepper in my opinion. For a main course meal cheese isn't good enough filling for these enchiladas: next time I will add musrooms or chicken.

I thought these were excellent. Even forgot to add the sour cream at the end so used it as a topping. Used the full 10 ounces of spinach and 4 ounces of chiles. Used meat from a roasted chicken. Will add a garlic clove next time and of course, the sour cream! A blender stick works wonders for pureeing. I used 1/2 and 1/2 and will change that to whole milk next time. I thinned the sauce with some chicken broth. My husband loved them! Happy Cinco De Mayo!

This was excellent! I used all whole milk (no cream) and added a little extra butter to the sauce. I also sauteed a chopped red onion until golden brown and blended this with the sauce, as well as a healthy amount of fresh cilantro and LOTS of extra chilies. I roasted red peppers and zucchini in the oven with garlic to add to the cheese and cilantro filling. I served it with avocado slices, salsa, and sour cream. My dinner guests loved it and of course today's leftovers were lovely as well.

Rating: 3
This was delicious. For the sauce, I used 3 cubes of frozen cilantro instead of fresh cilantro. I am a cilantro-hater and this made it much more tolerable because it was chopped so fine. I also added about a teaspoon of salt, 2 cubes of frozen garlic, and a couple tablespoons of lime juice. Next time, I might reduce the amount of heavy cream and increase the amount of milk. Adding the sour cream at the end really pulled everything together. I made a veggie filling with diced baby portobello mushrooms and sliced asparagus sauteed in some olive oil with finely diced red onion, garlic, fresh parsley, and some Penzey's fajita seasoning. It really added some great "bite" to the enchiladas. This is definitely worth making again. It was quite a treat!

Yummy! I added chopped jalapeno for more of a kick. I prefer flour tortillas. I used pepper jack for all of the cheese. Mild cheddar? Not appropriate at all.

A little time-consuming, but good. I didn't have cream, so substituted light sour cream which worked very well. Also didn't dredge the tortillas in straight oil, but a mixture of 1/3 oil, 2/3 water.

This recipe is delicious and deserves 3-1/2 forks even though -- stupid me -- I forgot to pick up the sour cream at the market! I can only imagine how much better it is with the sour cream. Otherwise, the only other change was adding chicken to the stuffing. Yum! It was a lot of work, though, so next time I think I will eliminate the heating of the tortillas in oil to cut down on the time and work. I don't think it will make that much difference. I'll definitely be making this again. It's a keeper!

This recipe has been in the regular dinner rotation for years. I usually use the entire box of spinach and sometimes even almost double the sauce. If I have leftover chicken on hand I'll add that to the enchiladas too. This freezes well.

Everyone I've ever made these for loves them. I usually do the chicken/olive enchiladas at the same time, both trays go quick. Prep isn't bad. I've tried to skip the heating the tortillas, but I'm always dissapointed when I do. They still taste great, but don't look as nice.

Rating: 3
These enchiladas were good, but the sauce was not good. Although maybe it is beating a dead horse to say so! I took the advice of other reviewers and tried to bring the sauce alive with garlic and jalapenos and cinnamon. It didn't help. Really, though, whoever heard of spinach in green sauce? Next time, i'd substitute 10 oz. of tomatillos. I sub'd half and half for the cream, as some suggested, and the texture came out fine. I think next time i would substitute chicken stock for the milk. And i used low-fat sour cream, which worked out great. Because this really is a fat-packed recipe, and much of the fat is completely unnecessary. The cheese in the enchiladas and on top of the sauce is more than enough fat/dairy without having an incredibly rich sauce. As for the enchiladas themselves, i used cotija instead of the Monterey Jack, as someone suggested. We also threw in mushrooms and shrimp and they were really good. I would definitely make them again with a different sauce.

this was ok. we tried to kick it up by adding a whole can of chilis and some chopped jalapeno, but it still seemed bland. I think using a sharp cheddar instead of mild and/or a pepper jack would do the trick next time.

Nice change of pace from the usual enchiladas, but I agree with others that the sauce needs a bit more punch. I added 4 oz of chilis but would even use a 7 oz can next time. My kids had no idea there was spinach in the sauce so that right there makes it a winner.

I really enjoyed this recipe, BUT I changed it up a bit. For the sauce, I made it as written, but used whole milk instead of cream, added double the spices and added a pinch of cinnamon.

After all the changes, it was really tasty. I'll definitely make this dish again.

I made this recipe for a vegetarian friend of mine and we both loved it!

When I first made this dish, I really liked it. I made it again recently and didn't think it was that good. I don't know what happened. To cut calories, I use fat free half and half for the whipping cream and fat free milk. I also use reduced fat cheddar and jack cheese and fat free sour cream. Maybe it needs the fat to taste better. Regardless, it is an acceptable vegetarian dish.

Made this for a dinner party with great results. I used several of the changes others mentioned - I sauted a full 10 oz bag of fresh spinach, added garlic, used a whole can of chiles, and used 1/2-1/2 and milk instead of cream. I also added sauted mushrooms to the filling and used cheddar and monterey jack with peppers. The results were great and everyone loved the meal. I served it with the black bean, corn and hearts of palm salad, and the frozen strawberry margarita pie for desert. Excellent!

Rating: 4
Really, really fantastic. Like others, I added more scallions, more cilantro and the whole can of green chiles to the sauce. Also used whole milk and wouldn't hesitate to use 2% next time - can't imagine why you would need or want whipping cream, this was so rich. Maybe someone has already suggested this, but next time I will put some of the sauce down in the pan first to keep the tortillas soft. Some of mine got a little tough on the bottom. I served this with chopped tomatoes and pickled jalapenos over the top for color and flavor.

I read the other posts and made this with quite a few modifications. I used one bunch of green onions, the full can of chilies and added two jalepenos (it stil wasn't hot). I also upped the spices to 1 tsp of red pepper, 4 tsps of coriander and 4 teaspoons of cumin. And...since I didn't have spinach I used arugula. I liked it--we did a cheese and bean filling with sauteed onion. My only concern is the richness. I will have to play around next time to see if I can do something besides all of the cream.

This sauce is fabulous; made it first time as written and this time made some slight changes. For the sauce I used fat free half and half in place of the whipping cream and used 2% milk. I did need to increase the flour by 1/2 T. to get to a nice sauce consistency. I doubled the green onions and added 1/3 cup of jalepenos from a jar(that were very hot). Perfect! I was underwhelmed by the enchilada portion of this recipe the first time I made it; so used from another recipe this time: 2-3 cups diced cooked chicken (I buy deep fat fried chicken from the deli. 2 breasts and two thighs); 1 cup cheddar cheese; 2 cups montery jack cheese; 1/2 medium onion, chopped; 1/2 cup sliced black olives; slight handfull of minced jalpenos; 1 and 1/2 cups sour cream; 10 Flour tortillas (depends on how full you fill them, but I used 10)

I was faced with cooking for 75 people on a one-day notice and this worked wonderfully. I flavored the sauce much more than the recipe states, but after cooking the enchiladas with the sauce on-top, it wasn't as spicy as I would have liked. Don't be afraid to really spice it because the baking will lessen it. I have also added chicken and sauteed mushrooms (garlic and olive oil) inside the enchiladas - I recommend it! I can't wait to try duck.

I make this dish all the time for large groups of guests (great make ahead meal) and I always get rave reviews. I add shredded chicken to the filling and microwave the tortillas, which works just as well to soften and takes no time at all. Made this for a get together the other night and was in such a hurry that I used canned green sauce mixed with the sourcream and used a bag of grated mexican cheese mix instead of grating it myself. Hate to say it, but it was still great--everyone asked for the recipe :).

I am giving the sauce four forks. We made the recipe as written, but next time I will as other reviewers have mentioned use some of my other base enchilada recipes. Just a personal preference, prefer meat fillings. I have a favorite mexican restraurant in Austin Texas that has a duck dish with a sauce like this. So excited to add this to my collection to make at home!

I only searched the enchilada recipes for new sauce ideas - I never follow the recipe for the filling, instead opting to use my own fave ingredients. I served 3 enchilada variations last night at a dinner party and this one was the most-requested. I actually forgot to add the sour cream to the sauce before pouring over the enchiladas, and it was still wonderful. I doubled the amt of crushed red peppers and added more diced green chiles for extra zip. But this was creamy, mild, and yummy, and a delight to look at!

This was a good recipe and I will make it again. I prepared it just like the recipe, except I used too much spinach. (All 10 ounces by mistake.) My young children adored this recipe and ate alot.

It was good.

Tonight's my first attempt at making enchiladas and so was super nervous. Read through everyone's review and incorporated them all - leaving out the coriander and red pepper, adding 2 green jalapeno pepper, used one whole can of 7 oz diced green chilies, used 4 teaspoons of ground cumin and definitely salt it well. Did not care for just a simple cheese filling so instead sauteed 1/2 onion with yellow pepper and garlic, mixed it with 1 3/4 cup sour cream, 7oz diced green chilies, 4 green onions, 1/2 cup cilantro, 1 small roasted chicken, 1 cup mixed cheese. The result - a delicious meal that even my picky husband loved. Thanks everyone for your contribution!

This is a great recipe. I made it for my mom's birthday dinner. She's a vegetarian so I was looking for a different kind of cheese enchilada recipe- i found it! I made a few changes, according to previous reviews. To the sauce, omitted the ground coriander, doubled the crushed red pepper, added extra cumin, used the whole can of diced green chilies, added a roasted jalapeno, and added garlic minced garlic. For the enchiladas, I quickly heated the tortillas in a skillet, using a little bit of fat free cooking spray (that softened up the tortillas so that they didn't crack when I rolled the enchilada). I sauteed the onions along with some fresh minced jalapeno. I didn't have anymore cilantro since i used it all for the sauce. This was excellent and I will definitely be making it again.

Four forks for the sauce, which is a great complement to enchiladas (however you build them) and I bet would be great added to Eggs Florentine or savory crepes. The preparation is a bit time consuming and leads to a lot of used dishes, but I was able to simplify things a bit along the way.

I've made this numerous times and it's always good, though a little time consuming and messy if you use the food processor. So now, I do not process the sauce with the spinach, etc. and I also use the tortillas straight from the package instead of dipping them in oil and heating them. It makes it a little harder to roll the tortillas, but in the finished product it makes no difference. Also, the enchiladas look nicer without being processed and there's more texture. Next time I'm just going to layer the tortillas instead of rolling them up. Good leftover, too. I agree with other reviewers about the sauce needing to be a little spicier.

You have to do a "little" doctoring to this dish. It is delicious, but like other reviewers stated, It could use an extra kick. I added an additional Habanero chili to the sauce, and I used pepper jack cheese in the mixture. I also just used half and half for both cups of milk, and didn't add the sour cream at the end. I served it on the side with some avacodo slices. I also added some diced chicken breast to the enchiladas...next time I want to try fresh shrimp. My guests raved, and it made the lengthly stay in the kitchen for prep and clean all worth it.

I thought this was good - not great. The sauce was very good, I will make that again with something else, although I did almost double the cilantro. The enchiladas were bland, and this is why I didn't give it a higher rating. Overall, it took me a long time to make(which was also because I made 40 of them for a party) and to me, it wasn't worth it.

Rating: 3
Definitely a different take on enchiladas but interestingly good and satisfying. The sauce was quick and easy to make - the entire assembly time was just under 45 mins. The only negative is the chopped spinach, it seems to get everywhere. The filling of onion and cilantro needed to be doubled. The overall flavor was "green" and you could taste the spinach, chilis, green onion and cilantro. It had just the right amount of kick, making it any hotter would drown out the flavor and defeat the purpose of the green sauce.

Yum! We all loved it. We made it to the recipe this time but would be willing to improvise a bit another time (chicken sounds good, and I would substitute a lighter cream).

I just made these, and all three of us loved them! We didn't find them to be bland, but that may be because I used a bit extra cilantro and cumin.

I've made this a half-dozen times; it's great. Better, as other cooks have noted, if you double the chiles and add chicken. Keeps pretty well, too.

Excellent. As with any recipe, I adjusted to suit my tastes. I added a roasted jalepeno (may add 2 next time). and whole package of spinach. Used fat free half & half and tablespoon of cornstarch in place of cream and milk. May use some pepper jack next time. Oh, I also added shredded chicken. Rave reviews by all. Will definitely make again. (Note: chipoltes may be a good addition -- would go well with the flavor of the cumin.)

Wish I'd have listened to the reviewers from Denver and Sacramento - I made this for a mexican-themed dinner party and was terribly disappointed, especially after all the time and effort that went into the preparation. The sauce was dreadfully bland, the enchiladas fell apart, and the overall taste was mediocre at best. I'll keep searching for a good cheese enchilada recipe, as I probably wouldn't bother to make this one again even with a substantial amount of doctoring.

This was okay, but nothing great. I did add chicken to the recipe. Everyone thought it was a little bland. It's always better to try out a new recipe on family, they will tell you the truth.

As a native Texan (and fervent lover of truly good Tex Mex cuisine) now living in the northeast, I am always in search of good Mexican recipes. The enchiladas were very good. The sauce leans to the bland side, so I would add some kick to it next time with jalapenos or more chilis. I also substituted Pepper Jack cheese for the Monterrey Jack, which gave it a good uptick. In all, this will definitely be served again. My husband loved them.

Very close approximation of the best enchiladas I've ever had. It was a little on the mild side and had to be give a little extra heat but almost as good as anything you'd get in El Paso or anywhere else in west TX.

This was fab. I'm a vegetarian but my carniverous fiance declared them the 'best enchiladas' he's ever had. This will become a standby for sure. I too subbed chipotle, increased spices a bit, and added some garlic....

Great. I throw in some cooked chicken and these are always a big hit. I've made them several times and they are still my favorite version of the enchilada.

This receipe received raves from my native Houstonian inlaws (which is nothing to sneeze at). I also enjoyed it and would serve it for brunch or other casual meal. It was very good re-heated and re-reheated.

We enjoyed this unusual enchilada recipe. I used fresh spinach,(that's what drew me to this recipe). I omitted the canned chilies and crushed red peppers and replaced them with 1 T. chopped chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, love that smoky flavor. Used half & half instead of cream. I did add spicy shredded pork to the filling,(had to use that up as well). Jalapeno jack cheese kicks it up a notch!

These were very rich.(Even though I used fat free half and half.) These were quite tasty but not spicy. If you are looking for a spicy enchilada recipe look elsewhere.

Excellent enchiladas. I made them with the mexican black bean recipe and wow what a great dinner! I read all the reviews and took the advice of adding a serrano pepper and crushed garlic to the sauce. I will definately be making this again..many times.

Excellent sauce - very versatile. Added extra cumin and spice. Actually used flour tortillas when perparing the dish. Made a couple of times with different stuffings - once with chicken & rice, another time - corn, bell pepper & onion mixture

Rating: 2
Too much preparation time and not worth it when I tasted the final package. Bland, bland, bland.....

Rating: 2
Sorry to say that "as is" this is only a so-so dish. If you make all the changes that many have suggested, it is not the same recipe, and even with the changes, I would only give it 3 forks. The sauce is definitely bland without jalapenos, garlic, & more cilantro, cumin, etc. I have had much better cheese enchiladas & would recommend trying a different green sauce.

Rating: 4
Wow, these enchiladas are wonderful! They actually took quite a while to prepare, but my husband and I decided that they were well worth the wait. We added a little more cheese on top & served them with homemade Spanish rice. A completely satisfying meal!

This was a bit of trouble to make but very very good. The sauce could use a little more zing- maybe add one small jalapeno to the mixture before puree-ing.

Rating: 4
Delish! Only change I made was to not actually roll up the tortillas. I made a sort of layered-lasagna out of it. I layered sauce, steamed corn tortillas to cover bottom, cheese mixture, onion mixture, sauce, tortillas, etc... I used all the sauce this time. Next time a little less sauce or more tortillas. It was a bit runny last night, but some of my guests had thirds anyway!

Yum, yum, yum... this was my cooking debut of some sorts and turned out a lot easier then I suspected. I had to change a few things because I didn't have a processor, but it was excellent. Spicy, with lots and lots of cook... and easier than it sounds!

Delicious! This is a wonderful dish. I only baked it for about 15 minutes, though. The cheese topping was already golden by then.

Great Recipe! I appreciated so much the other reviewer's comments as I too made a few changes. I added some fried fresh jalapeno slices to the sauce and a whole pkg of spinach,as we really like spinach. I think there are probably many variations of different pepper combinations which would be super with these enchiladas. Next time I want to add some roasted poblanos.

Great recipe. Long prep time - about 1 hour. You'll use ALOT of pans and dishes, but worth it. Great for company because you can make it ahead. I made the following modifications: all cream (no milk), whole package of spinich and can of chilies. Flour instead of corn tortillas. 1 c. sour cream. 1 bunch of green onions (including some tops) - I used 1/2 in sauce and 1/2 inside enchiladas. Be sure and puree in batches in food processor. Too much to fill at once.

I love this dish. I think it tastes great! The only bad thing about it is that it takes alot of time to make. But I get hungry for it often, so even though it is time consuming I still make it.

These were a hit! My boyfriend lives for his favorite Mexican restaraunt because of the spinach enchiladas.....after making these he wants mine instead. I couldn't believe how good they were. I felt like a true chef!! My sister-in-law used to own a Mexican restaraunt and I don't think she could top these.

I made this recipe last night without really reading the other reviews - my mistake. The finished dish was beautiful in presentation but too bland for my tastes. If I make again, I will add my own chili peppers, use more cilantro, definitely add garlic and cut the spinach a bit. Another idea would be to mix the monterey jack with cotja for the filling - add a bit more zing to the taste. I think that with those changes/additions, I would enjoy a lot more.

I made this recipe for our Cinco de Mayo party and it was GONE in 60 seconds! I doubled the cream, cut out the flour & milk, added at least a cup of cilantro and cut the cumin down to 1/4 tsp. Served it with sour cream & lemon wedges...so good!

I was looking for an authentic Mexican dish to serve to my in-laws who have never had Mexican food. The Cheese Enchiladas and Green Sauce caught my attention. WOW !! What a great meal, everyone loved them,they were a hit. The Green Sauce is a little rich, I suggest using "light" heavy cream instead. I will definitely make these again !!!

Rating: 3
These were delicious - such a rich, flavorful sauce! I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 and light sour cream to lighten it up a bit, but it still tasted sinful. I also used regular white onions and fresh serrano peppers for spice. I think the richness and strong flavors make it a dish I couldn't eat a lot of at one sitting, but I would certainly make it again, especially for entertaining. I served them with the panfried black bean coriander patties from this site and it was a good mix of flavors and textures.

Do yourself a favor and crush a large clove of garlic into the sauce. (can not imagine it without it)

Rating: 3
I found this dish very flavorful and just the right amount of spiciness and kick; however, I made some modifications to the recipe that perhaps influenced the outcome: --I roasted my own hand-picked chiles, which added a half-hour to the preparation time. --I cut back on the amount of cheese. --I eliminated the red pepper flakes. --I used fresh, local corn tortillas. Gringa tip: corn tortillas dry out quickly! Keep the unused ones covered in a plastic bag or under a moist paper towel while you're softening each one in the skillet. I feel that by implementing the steps above, the full flavor of the sauce and tortillas really stood out in this dish, rather than being drowned by cheese and heat.

One of our favorites! We usually add a few more chilis to the sauce to make it a little hotter. Even the teenagers love this one!

Rating: 4
I'm from West Texas, and let me just say, as Tex-Mex goes, this is delicious. (The Californians I served it to loved it as well!) I did double the spices because the sauce seemed a little bland at first, but otherwise, I stuck to the recipe. I think the others have good comments about spicing it up with peppers, if you like it hot. Try it!!

Don't let the naysayers hold you back. This is an outstanding recipe. Use fresh serranos and you will be most pleased. People who used canned chiles and then complain about a bland sauce get just what they deserve.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I made the following changes: used 3/4 can dice green chili, 2 diced fresh serrano chili, and doubled the dry seasonings. I also decreased the amount of spinach (1/3 of 10 oz bag) and used flour tortillas (couldn't find corn). Turned out delicious!

Rating: 2
How could so many people be so impressed with this very ordinary recipe? I substituted canned diced jalepenos for the canned mild green chiles, and that helped a little bit. It needed about double the specified amount of cilantro. Also, the sauce came out much thicker than I like my enchilada sauce.

Rating: 3
This is an excellent recipe! I did some substitution as well. I used a green chili sauce which I found in the local mexican grocery store as a substitute for the green chilis, added a little more green onion, cilantro & spices than was called for, and used a little less spinach. Just the right amount of zing! Definite do again!

Since when does creamed spinach substitute as an enchilada sauce? I doubled every seasoning and still came out with a boring, unattractive sauce. Do youself a favor and look elsewhere for a better recipe.

Rating: 4
Yum. Yum. After reading the last review, I was concerned about this being too mild, so we substituted 4 fresh serranos for the canned peppers, and we used a liberal hand with the cilatro, coriander, cumin and red pepper. It was beautiful! Not bland at all. I will definitely make this next time we have company.

I love enchiladas but unfortunately they are a scarce commodity in Australia (I am formerly from San Francisco where the Mexican food is suberb). I was disappointed with this recipe. It was very heavy and too bland and I have made much better ones in the past. But nothing ventured, nothing gained.

This was a very nice dish and a great sauce, although it did need some tweeking. I replaced the cream with fat free half & half and it worked fine. Also used wheat tortillas rather than corn, as a personal preference.

These were the BEST!!!! I have never made enchiladas that were this good. My whole family enjoyed them and I am having leftovers for lunch today. I can't wait to make them again. I made them just the way the recipe said and they were delicious! A little time consuming, but hey, they were worth it.

Very good, but very heavy! Every once and a while we can splurge though, right?

Taking the advice of the reviews below (thank you), I increased the butter & flour, added 2 chipotle chilis in adobo sauce, the whole can of green chilis, the whole 10oz pkg of spinach then also added 1 tsp of Mexican oregano. It was well-received, but I can't imagine the recipe being memorable in its original form. I may also use this doctored sauce with potatoes and peas served with rice as it reminded me of Indian flavors.

A definite hit among my vegetarian friends at a recent Mexican theme dinner party. I prepared everything the day before so I just had to put them in the oven when my guests arrived. Yummy!

I followed the change suggestions from North Reading and the meal was fabulous. I also put the rest of the green chilis in the enchiladas + 1lb. cooked and diced chicken and put the cilantro + some chopped green onions on top of the enchiladas after I took it out of the oven. Yum!

This was good, but a bit too creamy/bland. Next time I'll add some chipotle peppers. We liked the addition of cooked chicken to the enchiladas. Also, I'd use 2 cups 1% milk (because we always have it) and 2 T butter, 2 T flour.

My daughter in law made this for Thanksgiving for the entire family -- a very large group -- to go along with the bird in and the rest of the meal in a Southwest theme. What a marvelous addition and loved by everyone!! Since we are from Arizona and eat this type of food on a regular basis I was pleasantly surprised.

This recipe is great if you want to go a bit crazy. It is full of cream, but worth every calorie. If you like it a bit spicy, add more hot peppers.

Well, I can only agree with the other comments. This dish was terrific! I made the dish for my fiancee along with some spanish rice, and he was very impressed. I would recommend serving some type of rice or cornbread, etc. with the meal, however, because otherwise the dish may begin to taste overwhelmingly like the green sauce.

these enchiladas though time consumming, are terrific. The sauce is very tasty. We served a heart of palm, corn and black bean salad (which can be found on this site) along side. We recommend baking it for a few minutes longer than called for to make the tortillas a little bit more firm.

These were fabulous! The green sauce was surprisingly tasty and a wonderful complement to the enchiladas. We served them with a green salad tossed with lime/cilantro/olive oil dressing. The recipe made enough for 3+ meals for the two of us...and every bit of the leftovers were enjoyed.

I love the sauce for these enchiladas! They are time consuming, but worth the effort.
