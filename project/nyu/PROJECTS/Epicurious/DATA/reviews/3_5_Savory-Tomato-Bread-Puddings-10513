This is so easy and very good. I didn't change a thing.

Great for an easy supper with salad though I imagine it would be a nice accompaniment to BBQ as well as the prelude to the recipe suggests. Did make a few adjustments - added some minced garlic to the sauce as it simmered and added cheese to the dish before baking (which I don;t really consider a true change, I think whoever wrote the recipe accidentally left it out!) Also used leftover tarragon shallot bread but I think even plain old white bread would probably be good!

I Hate when people modify recipes, BUT this is the second time I made this and it was 100% better because of the changes. The first time it was WAY TOO MUSHY even though the flavor was good. This time I bought one of those baguette things from Pannera. I took off all the crust, and tossed the cubes in melted butter and garlic. Then I put them on a cookie sheet and toasted them in the oven. And, instead of canned, diced tomatoes, I diced lovely, fall beefsteaks. Then I followed the directions for baking and was much more pleased with the result.

This might be the first four-fork ever, thanks to simplicity, on-hand ingredients and taste. The only downside (a big one) is calories - 6 WW points a serving, even with 1 slice bread (all that fit the ramekins). So it's special-occasion fare for me, no problem! I did use Health Nut bread because it was on hand but really liked the bit of nuttiness/texture it added. White might make for better color presentation, however.

I ate such a dish at Boyne Lodge in Boyne, Michigan about 50 years ago and was delighted to have found this. Interesting that it was found in Horton Bay, Mich. also. It is delicious and I will serve it as a side dish with Turkey Tetrazzini. Nice combination, I think.
