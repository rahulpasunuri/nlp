Not a thrill. Better to make a bianca with a quasi lasagna filling; drained ricotta, shredded mozzarelle, a fair amount of chopped parsely, salt and pepper to taste, and, as an option, a dash of nutmeg. And, if your using a pizza stone, don't pre-bake the crust. Put it in all at once. My vegetarian and tomato allergic friends have loved this approach, the latter with some finely chopped prosciutto put into the cheese mix.
