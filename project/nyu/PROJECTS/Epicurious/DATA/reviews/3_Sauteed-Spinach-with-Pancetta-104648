I love pancetta, so I thought this recipe would taste great. I did alter it a bit by adding some sauteed garlic and shallots. Unfortunately, the dish did not meet any expectations around the table. Thus, I'll look for another sauteed spinach recipe.

I used one pound of spinach and 4 ounces (prepackaged and diced) of pancetta and no olive oil, as the bacon gave enough oil. I also seasoned it with salt and pepper.

Very good. Served with the herb pork with fig jam from this site. I too just added the raw spinach directly to the sauteed pancetta and let it wilt down. Easier than boiling and having to squeeze it dry.

This was quick and tasty, and was a fine accompaniment to the smoked scallops.

Much easier and better: saute pancetta in 1 T. olive oil in Dutch oven or large skillet; add spinach and saute, tossing until just wilted.

Pretty Good. I used baby spinach. Much easier.

Two lbs seems like a lot but you'll need all of it. I used this to go with smoked sea scallops. Excellent!
