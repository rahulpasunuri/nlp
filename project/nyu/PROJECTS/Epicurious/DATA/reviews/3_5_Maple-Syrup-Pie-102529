This is an excellent recipe. I needed a dessert for a buffet so I made tartelettes and had enough filling for 24 in 3 inch muffin tins. Sprayed the tin with Pam and they came out beautifully.

I used three eggs and "fancy" grade syrup for a more delicate flavor. I also added a pinch of salt. We call this "Sugar Pie" and everyone loved it. Made it in a flat, French tart pan and got more servings.

This recipe is very easy to make. The only thing I would add is maple extract to spike the maple flavor. Easy and yummy!!

I thought this recipe was a good starting point, but the maple flavor is over-powered by the amount of sugar. I'm going to try substituting some maple sugar for some of the brown sugar to see if I can bring out more flavor. Will post again if it works.

This is the quintessential tarte au sucre recpie. I substituted dark brown sugar for light brown sugar, and baked it for 60 minutes. Don't be put off by how jiggly it might seem when first taking it out of the oven. I put it under a cake dome overnight and when I served it at Thanksgiving dinner the next day the texture was perfect. I served it with dollops of softly whipped cream (unsweetened) flavoured with seeds from two vanilla beans.

I am not sure how anyone can have decent results with the formula presented. This pie is nothing but sugar and a little dairy. There are no ingredients that offer any type of structure building beyond the eggs. I agree as with many others, it is overly sweet.

This is fabulous. I have made it six times since eating it at the same Quebéc City restaurant, Labor Day 2008. I make it with dark brown sugar now, however, since the second time and prefer it. I also use a quality prepared pie crust. It is a fast, elegant dessert.

Made for Thanksgiving and it was excellent. Very sweet so also served a less sweet dessert.

I am so disappointed in how this turned out-- although the flavor was as wonderful as advertised, the filling was completely runny after 50 minutes (I took it out when it was dry on top but still wobbly, as directed, and somehow don't think another ten minutes would have done the trick). Trying to figure out where I went wrong: I used Turbinado sugar--perhaps it was the wrong kind of light brown sugar? I wouldn't have minded so much except I took it to a holiday diner, which was a little embarrassing... I see one other cook who had the same issue, but short of figuring out where I went wrong, I'd just caution anyone that a little overcooking would be preferable to undercooking.

I made this for a Thanksgiving day dessert. Everyone loved it. It's very sweet and rich. The unsweetened whipped cream was really necessary to cut the sweetness. Delicious and easy!

I used whipping cream and marscapone as a garnish. Definitely pair this pie with something--it's very sweet on its own.

My husband and I at at the Restaurant Aux Anciens Canadiens on our last visit to Quebec City. The Maple Syrup Pie was absolutely delicious. The restaurant actually pours pure maple syrup over the pie. The recipe is perfect. I will make this again.

Pie is just too sweet. I don't know what I was expecting, because the ingredients are essentially all sugar. Maple flavor was great.

I have made this pir multiple times. It is so easy and sweet. I use a prepared pie shell and the rest comes together in minutes. I have also made it in mini prepared tart shells and baked them for a shorter time for great individual desserts. Garnish with berries on the side in summer!

This pie was absolutely delicious. The creme fraiche was a perfect side note to the sweetnes. Will definately make this again!

My husband and I have been to Quebec city many times and have also been to Auz Anciens Canadiens. I am a collector of sugar pie recipes as I am from Quebec and have been brought up on the sugar pies. I tried this recipe and made it for my son because this is his favourite pie, but to my dissappointment it didn't turn out. Like one of the persons that rated it I found that the top of the pie was crispy and the inside was runny. Each time you put the knife in to cut it would crack all over. As far as taste is concern my son rated it a 4 fork.

Absolutely delicious!! However, a question. I followed the recipe, pulled it out of the oven after 55-60 minutes. Went to cut it after a while, and it was still completely runny. Stuck it back in the oven at least 10 more minutes, and after cooling, it's still not set up. We live at about 4400 feet, so I feel confident it's the altitude (I've read complaints from bakers before). Any ideas how to fix this?

My version looked dubious, but the taste was great. I missed the comment regarding 1.5 recipe for the 9" pan. Also used the unsweetened whipped cream- definately adds to it.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe. I made it exactly as written, including the cream fraiche. My dinner guests raved and raved. The cream fraiche met mixed reviews..I think next time I would use unsweetend whipped cream. You definitly can use the side of cream to balance the sweetness, but not to mislead you into thinking it was too sweet...just a perfect piece of pie.

Being French Canadian, maple syrup pie is something I have eaten all my life. As with so many dishes, there can be as many recipes as regions in a province. This version is fantastic. What I loved about it was that it was not too sweet. It has a balanced combination of richness and sweetness. This version is the one I'll make again. Sorry mom!

Fabulous maple flavor (used grade B syrup)! A 1.5 recipe of filling fit a 9" pie pan perfectly. Needs lots of time to cool and set! I took it out of the oven a bit too soon. It may be too sweet for some, but if you want a really good maple fix, this is your pie!

I found grade B syrup at Trader Joe's, but it's much cheaper on Ebay right now. Several people are selling it. It's called #3 in Canada, apparently.

This is so simple and delicious. And it really does need the creme fraiche to cut the sweetness. If you can get darker maple syrup it tastes better than most Grade A light syrups - more maple-y. Have made it a few times now - and have considered scattering toasted walnuts on the bottom for a maple-walnut pie that might be nice with maple walnut ice cream.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving, it was not quite all that I'd hoped for...it was like a pecan pie sans pecans. Not much maple flavor. My family said they liked it though, and the unsweetened whipped cream was delicious with it, but I think I will try to make this pie again with either maple sugar or syrup in place of the brown sugar.

This pie was easy and delicious. However, it didn't taste really "maple-y" enough for me; maybe that maple extract really helps. In any case, it is worth the effort!

This was one of several pies that I made for my family's Christmas dinner. They thought it was delicious - better than the family recipe that had been handed down for five generations (My ancestors are from the Province of Quebec - a small hamlet called Ste Famille on the Isle of Orleans). I also made it for a recent bake sale held at the church that I attend (predominantly French Canadian) and they couldn't believe how many people bid on this pie and the price it sold at.

If you like maple syrup you must try this pie. It is very sweet and needs the creme fraiche as a counterbalance. Use the tart pan and pre bake the crust. Excellent!

This recipe is OK, but not nearly as good as the recipe for Maple Syrup pie in the June 99 issue of Bon Appetit. Try that one if you can get your hands on it. I misplaced that issue and thought this would be a good substitute, but I was disappointed.

I tried this on a lark, because I had all the ingredients on hand, and was quite pleased. I used a tart pan instead of a pie pan, and a shortbread crust instead of regular pastry crust. The flavor was incredible. I "kicked up" the flavor a notch by adding half a cap of maple flavoring. And even though I forgot to add the melted butter the pie still turned out quite rich and flavorful. I'll definitely make it again.

My French Canadian mother could not have made a better pie herself. In fact, this one gave her a run for her money!! And I agree with the other reviewer about the whipped cream -- resist all temptations to sweeten it. It's a perfect complement plain.

This was so good! I was skeptical, but all the other reviews were right: it is soooo sweet (and I love sweet!) and the non-sweetened, whipped heavy cream is perfect!!! I almost put sugar in it, but I am so glad I didn't (it would have been way too sugary-even for me)~ The maple taste is wonderful!

Excellent pie. I have made it several times. It is so easy. The last time I made it, I added a little bourbon for a different taste. The adults in the family very much enjoyed it. The unsweetened cream is a must.

This was very delicious and easy to bake. I didn't have a glass pie plate. So I used a foil pie plate and it worked perfectly fine.

This is a wonderful recipe that met with rave reviews. It is treading a fine line of being too sweet, but comes in just under the wire. The unsweetened whipped cream is vital to the pie success. I made it with a walnut crust that can be found in the recipe book "Still Life with Menu" which made the pie all the more delectible in my mind. A definite winner.

Very interesting and tasty pie. I had trouble getting it to cook through without being too crusty on top. Wonder what I did wrong. Worth trying again.

Very sweet! The creme fraiche gives an excellent balance to the dessert. This pie got great reviews from family and friends. I will definitely make it again. I used the buttermilk pie crust that I found in the recipe search. Yummy!

I have made this pie 4 times (it was the first pie I have ever made) and it was as my husband put it "to die for!" Re the pastry dough: be sure that your fat (butter and shortening) are very cold (I froze mine) and don't overprocess. I also found it a lot easier to roll out the dough between two sheets of plastic wrap; no tearing or sticking problems with this method. Also be sure and chill the pie crust at least 30 minutes before filling and baking (this helps prevent shrinking). Re the filling: be sure and either sift the brown sugar before you mix it with the rest of the ingredients or strain the entire mixture before pouring it into the pie shell. All in all, a very delicious and easy pie to make and this from a novice pie baker!

I think you should review your recipe,because it is rather scrambled, giving no directions for the pastry, and pastry instructions with the filling, I would like the amended recipe, please.
