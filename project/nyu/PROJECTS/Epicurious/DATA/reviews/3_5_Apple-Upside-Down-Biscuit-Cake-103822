When I first read this recipe, I thought "hmm..it doesn't sound like the cake ingredients are sufficient to cover a 10" skillet." And sure enough, they were not. So I very quickly made another batch of dough. It's in the oven right so fingers crossed.

@ A cook from Lisbon, Tarte Tatin has more of a pie pastry crust and is not baked in the oven, except to brown the crust. This is more "cakey" and very delicious.

This is no American cuisine... This is based on the original french recipe, Tart Tatin, look for it you guys. Made with pears, and here they only changed the apples... No comment on the originality.

Tastes like something my grandma would make. Great way to use up extra apples. Tt looks really elegant when its turned upside down even though its a simple dish. I used a buttermilk pancake mix for the cake and was delicious. Would consider using dark brown sugar and making for brunch sometime.

I thought I died and went to heaven, when I doubled the topping ingredients and make this cake. It was more like carmeled apples. This was delicious when served warm with whipped cream. (or Cool Whip) YUM YUM !!

This cake was excellent and very quick and easy. I used Fuji apples because I had them and it was delicious. I served warm with cinnamon ice cream and it was a real hit.

amazing!!!!! needs a crunck though so i thought to put pecans and semi crushed graham crakers on the batter and baked it amazing!!!! i think i am also going to do more of the syrup on the bottom so that it is evenly soaked up by the cake!!mmh mmh good!!!

This was delicious, although it lacked structural stability! I wasn't sure how many apples made the right weight, so I used 6. 3-4 would probably be about right! I would also make 1 1/2 recipe for the biscuit portion. I followed the advice to add dark rum (3 Tbsp) and extra spices to both apples and biscuit (cinnamon, cloves, allspice, ginger). Very good. In the future, I'll serve it in the cast iron skillet for an easier rustic presentation.

This was very quick and easy to make, maybe not my favorite apple dish but still pretty good. My husband and I thought it was better the second day.

We (four of us) all thought this was delicious. I did follow others' advice to add rum to the caramel topping, and spiced the apples with cinnamon, allspice and ginger. I also replaced some of the sugar in the cake with a little extra demerara and used 5oz buttermilk instead of 4. I put a timer on it and the cake came out of the pan almost perfectly, I had one little bit of apple that stayed behind, but it came out with only gentle persuasion. A dollop of creme fraiche was just right on top. It was also excellent cold, the next day for breakfast, and again for dessert.

If you don't have buttermilk on hand, mix 1/2 cup regular milk with 1/2 Tbsp vinegar and let sit for 5 minutes.

I made it in an iron skillet and had no problem getting it out. As other posters mentioned, the biscuit wasn't as expected and a topping like whipped cream or ice cream was really needed. Next time, I'll make the biscuit cake- ier.

The apple topping was wonderful. I used Harlsons from our local orchard. The cake portion of the recipe, however, was dry and unappealing. Good thing I had some ice cream to drown it in, or it would have been much worse. I'll keep looking for a better apple cake recipe.

Rating: 0
The recipe came out nicely and tasted like a standard "cobbler". My variations: -whole wheat pastry instead of white flour (came out perfectly) -added a few tables spoons of apple sauce and rum to the batter -made my own "buttermilk" by adding a half table spoon of lemon juice to to a half cup of half and half (did not want to buy a carton of buttermilk just for this recipe) -the apples produced allot of juice (I used what I had on hand-fuji) so I gently poured out the excess and put the pan on the stove to get som caramelization - I served it "cobbler style" with the batter on top

Rating: 3
Easy to make, very good, but would not say exceptional. Was slightly disappointed in the taste of the biscuit portion of the cake. I followed the recipe for the biscuit portion & found the taste slightly "flour-y." For the topping, I spiced the apples and added a TBS of dark rum as recommended by a previous reviewer. I used a 10inch calphalon pan lightly sprayed with pam, allowed the cake to sit for only three minutes and had no trouble inverting the cake on a platter. Maybe would make again and play with the biscuit ingredients.

I made this recipe today for Father's Day. My father-in- law loves apple desserts. He loved it. So did I. I didn't have a cast iron skillet, so I doubled the recipe and used my 12" PC Family Skillet. It slid right out of the pan. I have to admit I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and made a couple of additions. I added a tablespoon of Meyer's Dark Rum to the topping, along with a teaspoon of Pampered Chef's Cinnamon Plus (cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, allspice and orange peel). After placing the apples on top of the brown sugar mixture, I sprinkled the apples with a teaspoon of PC Cinnamon Sprinkles. I added a teaspoon of the Cinnamon Plus to the flour mixture and one egg. The biscuit mixture was very easy to spread over the apples. I then sprinkled another teaspoon of Cinnamon Sprinkles over the batter. I baked the cake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes. Pure delight.

Rating: 4
Oh my word! Delicious! After looking through some of the reviews I decided to make some changes and think it turned out really well. First, I tossed the apples with some ground cloves and cinnamon before laying them out. I added an egg to the batter, as well as some more cloves and allspice. I increased the buttermilk to 2/3 cup. Also, I put in 1 tbsp raw sugar. This was a nicely moist but not heavy biscuit cake, and the crispy carameled edges were very tasty. I did not find the cake part to be nondescript, probably because I added extra spices to it. I will be making it again for sure, I served it with cool whip for the kids, but I think the creme fraiche would be divine for a more grown up setting. Be sure to take it out no later than 3 minutes, or your apples WILL stick to the pan. You can simply rearrange them but it doesn't look as nice that way.

Great dessert and breakfast serving.

I didn't have brown sugar, so I made a caramel sauce in the pan with butter, sugar and a little water. I used Cameo apples and was pleased that that they weren't too juicy. Also added extra cinnamon and nutmeg to biscuit batter. Fairly impressive, and not too difficult.

Rating: 4
this was really good. the apples were fantastic!! the cake part was less fabulous. i must admit, i may lean more toward 3 forks than 4, but the look of pure joy on my BF's face at the first bite, the urgency with which he got seconds, and the fact that all day today he kept saying "remember the apple cake??" made me go for 4 forks. the apples were fantastic, but the cake part was not very biscuity. we had no trouble getting it out of the pan, but we took it out after exactly 3 mins (a previous reviewer said, plausibly, that if you wait too long the caramel will stick to the pan.) the cake part was a little nondescript, but i like a previous reviewer's suggestion to add raw sugar to the batter for more crunch--i will probably try that in the future.

Rating: 4
Excellent. It got rave reviews both at an informal dinner party and a brunch. Heating the apples before putting the cake on seems to help it cook without becoming too brown.

Rating: 3
Not bad! The biscuit cake portion was wonderful! The topping was so-so. Perhaps this was because I used a Fuji instead of Granny Smiths. I made a few other adjustments also; I think I cut down the brown sugar a bit on the topping and added extra cinnamon and some nutmeg to the biscuit dough. AND since I had no buttermilk on hand, 1/2 cup soymilk and 1/2 tbsp of vinegar were subbed. Mm! Pretty good.

Rating: 3
I used a 12 inch cast iron skillet and found that it was too large, even after doubling the recipe. 10" would probably be just right. For the topping, I used apple juice to thin the mixture, next time will increase brown sugar by half. As suggested, added (for the doubled recipe) 1/2 tsp. each of ginger and clove to the topping as well as 1/4 cup raisin and 1/2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts. Tossed about 2lbs of Granny Smith apples in 1/4 tsp. each of ginger and cloves. For the batter, I added 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. each of ginger and cloves and two pinches of nutmeg. Meant to add vanilla, but forgot. I also added remaining 1/2 cup walnuts. Didn't have buttermilk so I used a substitute. The presentation was beautiful, the topping looked and tasted spectacular! I did think that the biscuit portion was a bit more crumbly than I would have liked. Has anyone tried adding either a couple of eggs or about 1/2 cup of applesauce to the batter to improve the moisture? I guess I could always top with whipping cream or vanilla ice cream. My husband loved it as is.

Rating: 4
This is SO great and SO easy. I spooned a few tablespoons of dark rum over the apples before I put the biscuit mix on. It came out beautifully, rave reviews from the guests. The creme fraiche is a must.

Rating: 4
It's odd to see such conflicting reviews about a recipe! I added 1 Tablespoon dark rum to the topping (after the butter foamed) and added ¼ teaspoon each ground ginger and ground cloves. I also tossed the apple slices in another ¼ t. each ground ginger and ground cloves. The biscuit cake is wonderful  subtle, crumbly. This recipe is like having a delicious, complicated jam spread on biscuits!

It's LA again, just pulled my doctored version of this out of the oven and flipped it over--the jalepeno combined with the brown sugar/rum to make this lovely spicy- sweet glaze and it's held it's shape nicely. The cheddar crusted bottom really compliments!

Rating: 3
I played with this by adding a thinly-sliced fresh jalepeno to the butter mixture & splashing in some rum with the brown sugar. Then I used a mix of apples, coated the slices with ground white pepper, ground clove, cinnamon & nutmeg. When I made the batter I used fresh ground pink peppercorn. Then I layered the thing up and sprinkled the top with sharp cheddar cheese & baked. So far, so good although spicy so serve with cream.

Rating: 1
I thought I would ignore the one bad review on this page, but I shuld have heeded the warning! This is a disappointment. Baked sliced apples are fine (I improved the recipe by flavoring them with lemon juice and cinnamon first), but the "biscuit" didn't work. The recipe needs about another cup of flour, more buttermilk, and an egg. My dough didn't rise at all (no, I didn't overmix) and tasted like baking powder. I will find another recipe for upside down cake and use apples as the fruit- it can only be better than this!

Rating: 0
I will not rate this since I used the wrong apples, and boy, was it bad. I used Paula Reds which may not be recommended for cooking - anyway, it was not the only problem. The biscuit was too mushy to work with, as far as spreading it - ha! It burnt on top and was mushy inside and tasted like wheat bread! Yuk! I followed others' advice and used some spiced rum and more spices, but what a waste of a lot of apples. These Paula Reds made it mushy. I don't know if I'd try it with the right apples.

Rating: 3
So easy and so good! I don't see how anyone could have trouble making this or eating it. I sure didn't. Cinnamon gives the dough a nice subtle taste and color that looks almost like whole wheat flour. Actually, I think I will use part or all whole wheat flour next time. Will make it in future for breakfast, brunch and tea time.

I LOVE THIS! We went apple picking last weekend, and looking for fabulous apple recipies to share with friends. Well, after trying this one out, I've made it three times in the last week, and everyone has raved. (I'm not using granny smiths, but rather a mix of various red apples from the orchard, like gala, macouns, etc) Loved it the way the recipie is written, but the 2nd time, I took other reviewers' advice and spiced the apples generously with ground ginger and cloves -- YUM. Then I added a few tablespoons of dark run to the brown sugar/butter mixture in the pan before I added the apples -- this is a must. It adds great flavor, and more importantly, makes it much much easier to get a good glaze. This last time, I added diced candied ginger in a thin layer between the apples and the biscuit layer -- also a great addition. The strength of this recipie seems to be it's ability to be endlesly futzed with, depending on your own tastes, and still turn out fabulously. I'll make this over and over.

Rating: 3
We really liked this. I think I would have given it a four-fork rating if I'd used the buttermilk as called for (all I had was 2% milk, which really shortchanged the recipe). It still turned out much better than I'd have expected, and I'll look forward to making it again with the buttermilk.

This dessert deserves 4 stars, for the combination of ease, versatility, and, of course, sheer deliciousness. I also think it's a unique concept. It is truly "biscuit-like", but also has elements of many apple recipes I've seen combined into one very simple and delicious dish. It does look nice and doesn't even need much, if any, oiling to come out of the pan. A dusting of powdered sugar or other embellishment would make it look "fancier". I added coarse sugar to the biscuit topping for added crunch. I definitely will try this with other types of fruit! mmmMMm :)

Really great way to do a quick tarte tatin-esque dessert! It is very sweet, so I sometimes use more apples - for this I just stick it in the oven for about 10 minutes then take it out to "spread" the biscuit mix on it.

Oh, my! I though I'd reviewed this long ago. It's a wonderful and extremely quick dessert (although I agree with the person who mentioned breakfast--it'd be great).

I got a kick out of baking a cake in my cast iron skillet, but it was a bit of an "ugly duckling", as the recipe more or less suggests that it will be. After all, it does say to "replace any apples that stick..." which means it's pretty much a guarantee. It was fun to try once.

Rating: 4
This is a great and simple recipe. I did not have brown sugar - so instead I boiled 1/2 cup sugar in 1 cup water in the cast iron pan, and added the apples to that. Let the sirop reduce a bit, add the butter, and the syrop will eventually caramelize and cook the apples. It was great! Another tip so that it reverses more easily - reverse it while it is still hot. That way the caramel is still liquid and it will flip onto the plate more easily (place the plate upside down ontop of the cake in the pan and then flip it - but be careful not to burn yourself!) YUM!

Rating: 3
I've made this 3 times and each time it was a hit! I've had the best results using a deep 12" Kitchenaid non-stick skillet - the cake slid out of the pan beautifully and the extra depth of the pan gave the cake a lovely height. Perfect with gingered whipped cream.

Easy, yes, but you must watch it carefully to avoid the carmelizing effect - don't let it sit more than 3 minutes or the presentation is ruined. There are other Tarte Tatin versions that are less challenging.

This recipe was fabulous and I did not add any of the sugar that it calls for due to special diet restrictions. The only sweetness came from the Granny Smith apples that I used. I also added extra spice to the apples, and did not bother inverting. We just neatly scooped each serving right out of the cast iron pan...Delicious!

My two friends and I made this last thurs night. We thought it was delicious, and added ben and jerry's ice cream on top to increase the splendor.

A delicious a cake! Everyone loved the ooey-gooey brown sugar and butter mixture oozed over the apples and cake. I had two qualms though: 1. This recipe much more spice.

I haven't made this yet, but will. Regarding cast iron skillets, once they are seasoned, they are the easiest care pans you can use. One person gave directions for seasoning and washing. One added suggestion: put it empty over very low heat on your stove to dry...better than cloth.

Rating: 0
Cast iron skillets are relatively inexpensive to purchase (a 10" skillet would probably be around $10 at a discount department store). They are not as difficult to maintain as people might think. To season, lightly rub the entire inside of the pan and bake for one hour. For extra seasoning, you can wait until it cools and repeat the process. The best seasoning for cast iron is using it A LOT. Use it for fried chicken, meatballs, burgers, anything that requires a substantial amount of oil. To clean, deglaze the pan by boiling water in it. After it cools, some, dump the water, sprinkle coarse salt in the pan, dampen a rag and scrub it. Rinse well, and dry THOROUGHLY! Never put soap on a cast iron skillet. After drying, rub the entire interior of the pan with a thin coating of vegetable oil. If the pan looks dry, bake it again. All this SOUNDS more difficult than it acutally is. This is my favorite pan for true frying.

Very tasty. I used about 2 layers of apples instead of one. Also, the butter brown sugar mixture is difficult to spread evenly. I'd add some brandy or something to it to make it looser and easier to smoosh around. Also, my biscuit batter didn't spread easily. I sort of made lumps of it on top of the apples
