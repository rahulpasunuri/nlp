I replaced the raspberry sorbet with coffee ice cream, and the cookies with ladyfingers. It came out delicious! I make these all the time now :)

This served many more than eight, so it wasn't as pricey as mentioned in other reviews. I found it best to unmold ahead of time and "clean up" the edges with a sharp knife (chef's treats) instead of using a warm spatula to smooth the sides, as suggested, because that blurred the ice cream layers. It made a great presentation for a casual italian-american dinner party.

Made this in a bundt mold for a wedding reception. To remove from mold just dip in a pan of boiling water for 10 seconds and repeat until loose enough to reverse onto a plate. This cake was outstanding - both visually and taste-wise. Was prettier than the wedding cake!

This is a great recipe to make with an electrical ice cream maker. The icecreams come out at just the right level of softness. I soaked the cherries in Gran Marnier overnight, dried them off, then added them to the icecream when it was done.

This was easy and delicious and was a big hit with my family. It's a nice combination of flavors and can be made several days in advance.I will definitely make it again.

It may seem like overkill to make the chocolate sauce for this dish, but it really is a nice addition. And very simple to make.

This was really good. I forgot to add the almonds to the itallian cookie mix but it still turns out really good. I am really surprise how well these flavors work with each other. Yummy!! I made this for dinner and everyone raved about it...:D

I made this cake for my Mother's birthday, and it was a complete hit!! Everyone had two pieces. I used almonds and italian biscotti for the crust and it worked great. This is a cake that no one has ever tasted before. When my brother-in law tasted it he was amazed at how you could really taste all the different flavors. I might try this one with different types of ice cream next time.

Very easy to make. I agree with the first reviewer, it can be a bit pricey. I used graham crackers, pralines, pecans, almonds and pistachios in the crust.

This was fairly easy to make, though it gets expensive if buying premium ice creams. The presentation was very nice and the foil made for perfect unmolding.
