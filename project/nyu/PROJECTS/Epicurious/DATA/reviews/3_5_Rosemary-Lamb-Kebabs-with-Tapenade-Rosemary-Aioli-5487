Instead of making lamb kebabs, I marinated lamb chops and served them with the dipping sauce as an appetizer for a party. They were gone in a flash and everyone raved about them.

I followed the recipe quite closely, and it really was nothing special. The marinade was pretty lackluster..and we let it marindate for a good 6 hours.

Excellent recipe--even for entertaining! I prepared everything in advance and finished the meat at the last minute. It was a hit. Do make the aioli recipe, too. The flavor combination was unusual, but very tasty with the kebabs. (We actually had more sauce than needed, even with generous helpings.)

Excellent. I am picky about my lamb also. Added a spice mixture on top of the marinade as previous reader but with different spices based on my tastes: cayenne, black pepper, oregano, thyme, garlic powder, and salt. Very flavorful and the aioli was incredible!

Nice but didn't blow me out of the water. The aioli is the best part. Don't hold back on it!

Just great, and I am particular about my lamb. Following other reviewers' suggestions, I increased the garlic. I also used a spice rub(well, sprinkle)of cumin, greek oregano, tiny bit of cinnamon, and a touch of cayenne just before griliing. The tapenade I used for the aioli had California olives, no anchovies, but did have some sun-dried tomatoes. The aioli was a big hit. Guests must have told me 5 or 6 times how delicious everything was. Definitely endorse the sweet potato "salad" as an accompaniment. I parboiled them for 20 min, and broiled for about 7. Steamed asparagus. Stag's Leap Petit Syrah. Apple torte in almond base. Perfect.

This was exactly what we were looking for in a Lamb Kabab - very flavorful and tender. (careful trimming is time well-spent!)Quick and easy to throw together when it is time to eat. Fresh rosemary is very important for the best aroma and flavor. The sauce was good, even though I had to throw together my own tapenade based on the dictonary definition. This is a keeper.

Next time i'd increase the garlic. Other than that, it was very tasty... as part of a greek-themed dinner, it was a nice change from "standard" souvlaki.

We especially liked the dipping sauce, which we made with purchased Greek olive tapenade. We can't wait to try it with fried calamari!

Can be broiled instead of grilled

Very delicious. I agree with other reviewers -- don't skimp on the marinade time. Convenient to thread the kebabs right before guests arrive so you can enjoy the conversation and appetizers without getting messy. I went a little heavy on the garlic and everyone loved it. The aioli worked really well with chicken kebabs as well. This is a definite keeper!

Have used a near-identical marinade for years for grilled lamb chops...also use a spice rub which contains a little pepper, cumin and oregano just before grilling...no better way to fix lamb, whether kabobs or chops!

I made this dish for a friend that swears he hates lamb. I have been trying to get him to enjoy it (his memory is the mutton his mother made) and he LOVES Rosemary. So the abundance of Rosemary make him a convert. Now if I can just get him to eat goat cheese!!

Very nice. Using fresh rosemary versus dried really makes the difference in this dish. The second time we made this, we marinated pre-cooked shrimp with the lamb for about eighteen hours (refrigerated) and also added one inch red and yellow pepper chunks to the kabobs for color and flavor. It was exceptional!!!

We generally buy a boned leg and cut it for kebabs and marinate at least overnight. It seems so simple in ingredients, but this is the best marinade for lamb I have ever tasted!

Loved this dish. The aioli is outstanding. I made it the first time for guests, and it came out perfect.
