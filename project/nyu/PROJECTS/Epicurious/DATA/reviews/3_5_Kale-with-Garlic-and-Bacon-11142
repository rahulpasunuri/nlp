Husband brought home a whole bag of kale and I had no idea what to do with it. Loved this recipe, although I added feta cheese and s&p to taste. (He still didn't go for it, so more for me!)

This was amazing! Made with chicken broth, as recommended and added a splash of lemon juice just at the end of the simmer. Tender, moist, delicious kale, a total hit with a vegetable-hating husband!

Excellent!! Greens and bacon - what's not to like!? I used onion too as the commenters suggested and it was delicious.

Quite tasty. I used 2 pieces of bacon, and threw in some very thinly sliced onions with the garlic. I used beef broth instead of water, and it turned out really well.

good stuff I made it with chicken stock and onions too, extra garlic topped with Romano cheese

Double the garlic and lightly caramelize some sliced onion in the bacon drippings before adding the garlic.

Quit good. I don't understand why the 45 minutes, when all you're doing is making bacon and cooking the kale for 6 minutes, it takes maybe 20 minutes, if that.

My mother used to make kale, and I hated it. I added some diced onion to the cooking bacon, and it turned out pretty good. Good way to add another green to your catalog.

Better than the sum of its parts. Nothing revelatory, but quite good, and even better with chicken broth instead of water. A nice green, great with the goat cheese ravioli I was eating.

This is really good. Try it with chicken broth instead of water for even more flavor.

This is one of the best kale recipes I've ever run across. Very tasty!

I tried it with Pancetta instead of bacon and it wasn't so good. It just tasted salty with minimal flavor. Not even that garlic could salvage it.

This is a great recipe, use the thick bacon! I also added Cannellini beans and used it as a "sauce"

This is the dish that sold me on Kale. I added a little bit of lemon juice-fantastic!

I used 4 thick slices of bacon and 4 cloves of garlic. I also added a medium sized onion. Tasted very similar to "couve a Mineira", which we ate a lot of in Brazil.

You will either love or hate this dish, but give it a chance! If you are timid, try it over rice which cuts the slightly strong taste of kale. It is wonderful! (I added onions, as I love onions).
