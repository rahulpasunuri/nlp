Never made ratatouille but looking for ways to broaden my range w/ eggplant. Found this delicious, and not too much work. Made it pretty much as written and it came out great, but will try again w/ the chickpeas, I think it'll add even more great texture.

Loved, loved it! I had some left-over cooked bacon pieces; added it to the crock pot mixture for wonderful added flavor.

I tried this recipe last night - the polenta was amazing, and the ratatouille was delicious. I had to make some changes to the ratatouille recipe, as I don't have a slow cooker. Instead, I simmered the vegetables on low with the tomatoes. I ommitted adding the flour because the sauce was thick enough, although I did add red wine. As for the polenta, I made it exactly as described in the recipe and it was great! Having never tried to make polenta, I was surprised by how salty the broth made it, but the goats cheese and butter mellowed it into creaminess, and the saltiness was great with the ratatouille.

This tastes awful. You are better off roasting the veg for ratatouille for flavor and work purposes. As others have said, there is so much prep involved you are better off roasting this if you want any sort of good flavor.

Fabulous polenta!!! So creamy and tasty. Big hit in my house. I made oven roasted ratatouille which only takes 45 mins. to cook and is similar in ingredients using thyme and basil to season. Even meat-loving husband said "you can make that again any time!"

looking forward to making this! to the reviewer wondering about the prep work for this, i have never had something out of a slow cooker that didn't have prep work and tasted good. i think the "just throw raw ingredients in the pot and walk away" attitude was why so many abandoned their crock-pots 20-30 years ago! in my opinion, the point of the slow cooker is to allow the mellowing and melding of flavors and, for meat dishes, to allow for tender meat despite cheaper, tougher cuts. i think it is an awesome way to "cook" my family's weekend evening meals: after breakfast prep the veggies and/or meat, get everything in the slow cooker, go out and enjoy the day with the kids, and come home to a yummy dinner !

Wonderfully delicious and a great comfort food. I didn't have goat cheese but used gorgonzola instead. A very tasty dinner!

I so agree with previous comment. We should all be trying to eat more seasonally, if possible. But the recipe looks great and I hope I look it up when those vegetables are fresh and amazing.

This sounds yummy! I make Ratatouille all winter when I can find nice veggies on sale. Besides, eggplant is way less expensive than meat per pound any time!! This recipe is a bit different from my go to one so I will be trying this one soon. I like to serve mine with cheese grits or just plain grits. Such a great dish for a cold blustery day! Thanks for posting this now, this is great!

I agree with the other review.... Why make a Summer dish in the Winter as the daily recipe? However, I did freeze some zucchini, but no eggplant. I will be trying this soon. Maybe an Easter dish for my daughter,a vegan. But looking forward to trying it out! Thanks

Slow cooking is supposed to be throw it in the pot, leave for work and come home for dinner. Not spend hours in prep! By the time you get through fussing with draining, saucing and browning you may as well just cook it in your stove for an hour. Since it makes so much you can prepare it on the weekend and reheat portions for weekday dinners. I don't know that there's anything new to this recipe.

I have not made this. I saved it to my recipe box as it is MARCH. Eggplant and summer squash will not be in season for months. This will make a fabulous summer slow cooker recipe, but I just don't understand why it has been posted when snow is still blanketing half the country and the eggplant at grocery stores has no flavor and a skin an inch thick.
