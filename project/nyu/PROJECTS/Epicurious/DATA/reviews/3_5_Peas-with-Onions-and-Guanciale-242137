A festive way to make peas. We used pancetta (kind of grossed out by cow jowls)pearl onions and frozen peas--worked just fine. This takes a little bit of time; but it is worth the effort.

I made this a week ago and am making it again tonight. I used guanciale from the Batali salami shop in Seattle lst week but will have to use pancetta this week. It will be interesting to see how different it is from the guanciale. I also used pearl onions and frozen peas. Delicious!

This was a great take on your classic "peas". I used pancetta instead of guanciale, and I think it worked just as well. Also, I recommend using pearl onions because cipolline onions can be very large. Also, I used frozen peas. It was all excellent.
