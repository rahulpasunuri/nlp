I made this for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews. I took notice of previous reviewer's comments that the cake was bland. To the flour I added: 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp grd allspice, 1/2 tsp grd ginger, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1/4 tsp grd cloves, 1/4 tsp salt and 1 tsp finely chopped crystallized ginger. With these additions, I followed the recipe exactly. The cake was wonderful. Fix the cake and you'll love this recipe. I spinkled cocoa over the whipped cream frosting to make it look like a log and garnished it with suggared pecans. Will make this again next thanksgiving. It's a keeper!

I agree that the presentation is great but I feel there just isn't enough flavor in the cake or filling to warrant the fairly significant amount of work involved in this dessert.

The filling was delicious, but the cake failed to meet expectations. It was plain boring -- both in taste and in appearance. All the same, my guests took seconds.

I substituted chocolate sponge cake and a chocolate sour cream frosting. I followed the recipe for the filling except I used Grand Marnier instead of the orange juice and added a little extra gelatin because I had to transport the finished cake. Looks gorgous but could use more spice to be called "spicy".
