Lactose intolerant, used cool whip and silken tofu insead of whip cream and cream cheese. Used an oreo prepackaged crust. Super easy, extra tasty. Dressed up a bit with some shaved dark chocolate on top before freezing.

I made this pie for my peanut butter and chocolate loving father's birthday. It was a big hit with everyone and there was a request for another pie from my brother. I used the recipe for the Oreo crust from Bon Appetit's Chocolate Mousse Pie (url below) and it worked out beautifully. I topped with unsweetened whipped cream and served in very small slivers. It's rich! http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Chocolate-Mousse-Pie-2687

I made my own crust with chocolate graham crackers and used a 13x9 pan instead--doubled the recipe and it worked well and was easier to serve. Fun, cool summer dessert!

Really good. I too made my own crust using chocolate graham crackers, butter, and sugar.

I love this recipe! I am making it for Pi Day today and I'm sure it will turn out as it did last time - perfect. In this recipe the peanut butter filling is very creamy and is almost like a mousse. I would recommend it and make it again anytime.

I have made this many times and it is delicious and easy to make. I decorate it by melting some chocolate with heavy cream (ganache) and drizzling it over the top or covering the whole top with chocolate. Another nice thing is you can make this in advance and freeze it until you need it.

I lost my recipe and was elated when I found this. There were only a few differences from mine, but it's the same pie. You can substitue the whipping cream (and eliminate the beating to peaks) for whipped topping (like Cool Whip). I use a graham cracker crust (purchased or home made), and for special occasions, shaved chocolate on the top. If you don't have a processor, the ingredients can be mixed by hand. A 9" deep dish pie can be created by INCREASING the peanut butter and whipped topping by an additional 1/2 to 1 cup. The pie still tastes the same -- WONDERFULLY DELICIOUS!!

This pie was so easy to make and quite delicious. I varied the crust by spreading melted chocolate into a foil lined pan and freezing and pulling off the foil before adding the pie filling. I then froze the pie and garnished with chocolate sauce and crushed up 5th Avenues. It was a hit at dinner club...where all of my friends out do me with desserts...well, not this time!

Easy and a crowd favorite. I made my own crust with chocolate wafers, butter and chocolate. Very easy and much better than store bought.

As I often do I used the opportunity to use up some little bits of things in my pantry. I used some almond butter and chunky peanut butter which was fine because most of the chunks disappeared after I processed it. Also I used some Peregina chocolates with hazelnuts in them that someone had given me, putting them in at the very end so that I had bits of chocolate and hazelnuts which was very nice. I didn't mix the whipped cream in with the filling but spread it over the top of the filled pie instead just because I wanted it to be more like a cream pie. To make the filling more creamy, I omitted some of the sugar and used 3 TBS of maple syrup. Delicious treat!

This pie was a great hit with family and with church crowd. It assembles in less than 30 minutes, but tastes as if you slaved in the kitchen. Delicious and rich. And easy.

This was a bit too sweet for our taste. The peanut butter flavor was just a little overwhelming.

Easy and very good. It got raves from friends, many of whom asked for the recipe. One tried it with a store-bought Oreo crust & said it was great.
