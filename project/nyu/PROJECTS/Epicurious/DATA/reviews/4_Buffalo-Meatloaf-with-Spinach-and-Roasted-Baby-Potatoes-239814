This was really good and fairly quick and simple to make. I used heart smart beef (similar to ground sirloin in the US) since I don't like using kangaroo in short cooking time recipes. I added a chopped carrot to the mushroom mixture and used cap mushrooms instead of criminis but other than that, I followed the recipe fairly closely. served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Converted my Aussie husband to meatloaf in minutes--he went back for seconds and took a meatloaf sandwich to work the next day! This will go into our regular rotation of dinners! I especially liked that I could serve a full dinner like my mom used to make just over an hour after we got home from work!

All I can say is WOW!! I did not make the spinach (we had salad instead), but the meatloaf was amazing...juicy, flavorful...I only changed one slight thing in the recipe...I added some brown sugar to the tomato sauce on top, and next time I will make more of it to top it off!! Perfect for sandwiches the next day...yum yum yum!!

My kids, who are very picky eaters, literally ate every bite of this meatloaf and were begging for more. I did a slight variation and added a bit of fresh rosemary in addition to the sage and thyme.

I do not understand the extravagant praise fort his recipe. The spinach is boring, and the meatloaf doesn't really come together. This is a good method for potatoes, though, so I'll do that again. Otherwise, I wouldn't waste my time or appetite.

I thought this was good. I definitely do not think it was a four fork dish. My husband liked it a lot more than I did. Just... not that special. Also, as a mushroom lover I thought I would like the mushrooms in it, but... not really. Oh well.

I am from Rapid City SD and although I haven't eaten at the Corn Exchange, this has become a staple recipe as it reminds me of home. I make it for my parents whenever they visit. Bison is a lean, healthy meat, and this is a great comfort food recipe. I make it unmodified, just as the recipe states.

substituted oregano for sage....delicious!

Best meatloaf I've ever made. Even the mushroom-hating kids loved it. They never realized that it had mushrooms in it. The only changes I made were to add a little brown sugar to the tomato sauce on top and to add twice as much tomato sauce on top as called for in the recipe.

OK. I don't write reviews if I change the recipe...this one I have to write. Made to specs and truly enjoyed the the meatloaf. Just two of us so of course had leftovers. A lot. Took some chunked it up in crushed tomatoes, etc and made marinara still had leftovers added more fire rosted tomatoes and ended up making lasagne. Seriously awesome. Made again tonight and have a ton of great leftovers. Do it try it and enjoy it. Will make over and over again.

Excellent! Made with ground turkey, and used ketchup instead of tomato sauce. It was very tender and moist.

This was my first time cooking/eating bison meat...and it was amazing! This meatloaf did not last too long at the dinner table. The flavors go very well together, the fresh sage, thyme and mushrooms all give this meatloaf an awesome flavor. I was a little apprehensive to try this but I was very happy that I did. It was very easy to make and every part of this dish was great!

OK, so this was my first time making Meatloaf, being from France, it is something we don't know... and it was delicious. Although, I have to say that I modified the recipe... A LOT. Since I could not find bison, I did it with horse meat (don't shout at me, it was the recommendation of the butcher for a susbstitute lean meat) and it was moist and really really good. Anyways, I am sure it is not the same taste as bison... maybe next time...

This was fabulous. I didn't end up making the spinach, but the meatloaf was great. My husband and my 14 month old loved it. I made it again with ground pork, and it wasn't as good as with the buffalo.

This was the best meatloaf I have ever eaten. This recipe is a real keeper. I have made it with beef and buffalo - buffalo is better. Just wish that whoever wrote the recipe could have said how much dried herbs to use for those of us who don't have a herb garden.

Next time I'm making my own sides as I thought these were a bit bland but I loved this meatloaf! Next time I'm doing mashed potatoes as the side instead of the roasted potatoes and I'll do beets and roasted brussel sprouts- it'll be great! Very easy tasty dinner!

This was delicious. I followed another commenter's suggestion and cooked everything in one large le creuset braising pan. Slight changes - deglazed mushrooms/onions with a tiny bit of red wine. Used italian parsley instead of sage, since I had it. Included teaspoon of red pepper flakes in meatloaf. Used baby potato-sized chunks of small yukon golds, and did not pre-roast them, just nestled them around the loaf. Cooking time was perfect for both loaf and potatoes without initial 20 minutes. To serve, drizzled a little worchestershire on top - just a drop or two. Next time I'll mix it in. Used leftovers in breakfast tacos the next morning. Yummmmm.

I made this meal for the second time last night and it was just as amazing as the first. My husband has requested this meal every day since the first time I made it, it is a new household favorite! I followed the recipe to the letter and don't have any changes. I would highly recommend this recipe, it is a great healthy meal.

I really enjoyed this meal. Everything was fantastic, the meatloaf was exceptional - moist, flavorful, a pleasure to eat. The family loved it, and its now a staple in our household. We order bison by the half and this is a good way to use up some ground. The only sub I made the first time was rosemary-garlic crutons (crushed up), as I didn't have any panko. I have prepared with both panko and the rosemary-garlic crutons, and prefer the latter. Lamb spices (like rosemary) seem to work really well with bison.

I've made just the meatloaf a number of times using a loaf pan - it's delicious! Very moist and tender. Freezes very well also - if there's any left over, wrap slices in plastic wrap and aluminum foil to protect from freezer burn.

I changed the recipe by using whole wheat panko and for the last 20 minutes I sprinkled a 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese then poured 1 cup of tomato sauce over the top of the meatloaf. The meatloaf was fabulous! We love it and will make it one of our regular dinners.

I was ready to be wowed by this recipe but I followed it to a T and was not really impressed. Yes, the buffalo meat is kind of mushy. The flavors are okay but not stellar. It firmed up okay for sandwiches the next day but then we were glad to see it gone. I won't make it again.

Does this meatloaf TASTE very mushroomy? I love them - my husband does not...

Rating: 4
Delicious -- no leftovers! I took the advice from some reviews and used a lot more tomato sauce. What I got was a fantastically moist meatloaf. One thing many of my guests commented on was that this loaf isn't overly-sweet. It is the perfect balance of spice and sweet and salt. I sub. cayenne for red pepper (only a pinch though for the recipe given). Will make again, and again, and again. . .

I'd never made meatloaf before this dish, and to be honest, had been too scared to ever try meatloaf. But I love buffalo and was intrigued by all of the good reviews on Epicurious. Make this dish. It's easy to make, the result is delicious, the leftovers are good too. I followed the recipe to a T. Next time, I'll use more mushrooms and add more sauce at the end.

Rating: 3
This was really good. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will add an additional half to 1 cup chopped mushrooms and brown them more. Buffalo meat is a bit soft and mushy, and the chewier mushrooms will give the dish more body. The spinach was good too, but I prefer to "toast" garlic slivers in olive oil and then crumble into the sauteed spinach.

This is an easy and fantastic meal. It is terrific and flavorful. I have made this one of my standards in my monthly dinner plans.

I make this at least once a month and I think the recipe is great just how it is. LOVE LOVE LOVE the creminis in it, creates dramatic moisture and flavor both. I always have leftover red onion and not much is cooked with it. I always seem to have all the ingredients on hand except the meat and creminis, so it's a super easy weeknight recipe. The preparation flows quickly and nicely with little downtime.

We had this for dinner last night, and LOVED it. This is the only way I will make meatloaf from now on. It's truly fabulous, but it won't feed more than 4 people because everyone will want seconds.

I was at a loss how to use some ground buffalo I had in the freezer, and this recipe was a lifesaver! It was fairly quick and easier than I originally thought. And coming from someone who normally HATES meatloaf, but was willing to try something different, it was VERY tasty! I had the fresh herbs growing on the porch, and all of the ingredients on hand, and decided to give it a go. Served along side rosemary roasted potatoes and wilted spinach, it was amazing.

if i could give it more forks, i would! this is the BEST meatloaf i've ever tasted--it's so moist, has so much flavor, and is super easy. i didn't have panko or breadcrumbs, so i used oatmeal and it was fine. as suggested, i toned down the sage to half a tablespoon, and added chili flake to the meat mixture. UNREAL. served it alongside some horseradish mashed potatoes, and it was a match made in heaven. YUMMMMM

A moist and delicious take on meatloaf. We had it with basmati and asparagus. My only suggestion is that less sage is used - 1 tablespoon/pound of bison is a bit overpowering.

Rating: 4
Great complete meal, as advertised. I made it for the second time tonight and came up with an idea that I'll try next time. Because the cooking time seems long for the potatoes, I'm going to saute the mushroom mixture, put the meatloaf together, put it back in the same skillet, pop the potatoes in that pan and put the whole thing in the oven. It would be great to cut down on dishes to make this meal even easier!

Rating: 3
This is really delicious and easy, but 70 minutes at 375 is honestly too long to cook baby potatoes. The potatoes were good, but way overcooked. I will definitely make this again -- and for company -- but definitely not put the potatoes in the oven 20 minutes before the meat.

Phenomenal. Third time we made this we replaced some of the mushrooms with chopped pine nuts, added very nice texture and flavor. This was a huge hit with everyone we served.

Quite a tasty dinner - I omitted mushrooms and used 1 lb grass-fed dry aged beef. Maybe due to fat content of beef it was moister than it should have been, but otherwise delicious! My husband was skeptical about meatloaf but liked it!

Awesome! I have made this twice this week and my husband loves it. I put a little extra red pepper flakes in the tomato sauce - otherwise i made no changes. It was not soggy at all. It is a little wet when you put it in the pan however it holds together well with the one egg. I also love the spinach - so easy and delicious.

Fantastic! I used two eggs. It was very soggy coming out of the oven, but it held together well after it spent the night in the fridge.

Buffalo isn't available in NZ, so I made this with ground wild wallaby. The flavour was exceptional - as some other cooks suggested I added extra red pepper and made it spicier - but the texture was rather crumbly despite using 2 eggs instead of one. The potatoes were lovely, but I skipped the spinach. I'm going to try it again with venison and see how it comes out.

My husband loved this meatloaf. Since I did not have fresh sage, I added 3 mashed chipotles in adobe sauce instead to the meatloaf mixture. I also added a tablespoon of chiptole/adobe sauce to the 1/4 cup of tomato sauce rather than using the red pepper flakes. Just enough heat--could have added a few more chiptoles for my husband's taste. Baked in a loaf pan rather than on a baking sheet as the mixture was very moist (may add an extra 1/4 cup of crumbs next time). Since the baby yukons were not baked along side the meatloaf as suggested, I rubbed them in olive oil, salt and pepper. Very glad I did as the meatloaf still creates a little grease, although the buffalo meat is more lean than beef. Roasting the potatoes in the grease didn't seem appetizing to me.

I used two eggs, as some other reviewers recommended, and put red pepper flakes in the loaf itself instead of sage. Flavor, texture, crust, and spiciness are all excellent. Next time I might throw some sun-dried tomatoes into the mix too.

roasting the loaf with the potatoes gives them some of the flavor from the fresh sage and thyme, yum. I used leftover meatloaf for sandwiches, Mmmmm.

The meatloaf didn't hold together so well so recommend another egg. Also, for those who prefer more kick, use less sage and thyme and add more pepper flakes and/or other spice items you have on hand. I would suggest adding it directly to the meatloaf and not just on the topping.

Yummy comfort food. Buffalo is much less greasy than beef, but has great flavor. My children both love this, and have requested it for Christmas Eve dinner. I am adding Chipotle this time since I had some in the fridge. I think this is a recipe that can vary somewhat based on what you have on hand.

Loved it! Simple ingredients, easy to make, and doesn't require you to be in the kitchen for hours. The meatloaf was so tender and moist! A quick,fresh pinch of lemon or lime juice brightened up the otherwise bland spinach. The leftover meatloaf (if there are any) is also great for sandwiches. Received many compliments on this dish. Can't wait to make it again!

So simple and wonderfully light! I incorporated the red pepper flakes into the loaf instead of putting them in the tomato sauce on top and I used a couple more ounces of tomato sauce than the recipe specified. Also, the cook time in the recipe is slightly too long or my oven runs hotter than the recipe writer's oven so watch your cook time to avoid overcooking. (I used a meat probe and saw it was almost done before the last 20 minutes of roasting. So, I left the meatloaf in the oven but turned the temperature off for the last 20 minutes. It worked out perfectly.)
