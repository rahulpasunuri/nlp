I made this for breakfast and thought it was fantastic! I didn't have any passover wine, so I skipped it altogether. I topped it with some vanilla yogurt and viola! it was great! It was a little sweet with the amount of honey and vanilla yogurt. Next time I might try plain yogurt or less honey.

Delicious! Although I understand this is not the traditional haroseth.
