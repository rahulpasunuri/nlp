We had freshly picked morels, bought the really expensive veal and seasonal asparagus. My husband is great a following recipes but this really did not highlight the fabulous flavors. We had never eaten veal but love our fresh morels and asparagus. They pair really well. For the time and expense - this is not worth it. Tastes are good but morels could have easily been plain old button mushrooms for all they added... Keep looking if you are looking for a recipe to showcase your morels.

I don't know how you can not like this. So good and really quite simple to prepare. Everything just works together. Couldn't find fresh morels so I used a dried wild mushroom mix that had morels in it - worked great.

This was wonderful on a winter's night after snowboarding. We substituted pork for the veal, and a variety of mushrooms, especially shitake, for the morels. Really wonderful.

try eric ripert's veal chops with morels and herb butter sauce if you want this to be out of this world (from an amazing cookbook 'a return to cooking')

I agree with Cook from Seattle. Too much fuss, too much time burying good flavors.

This was great. The flavor was outstanding. Used dried morels since I didn't have fresh. They don't need to cook as long as the fresh, maybe only a couple of minutes.

This recipe is an excuse to throw expensive (and wonderful) ingredientes together. And I was disapointed... the wonderful flavors overpower each other. The flavour of morels should be showcased, not thrown in with asparagus. Take the ingredients and do seperate recipes worhty of them.

Amazing flavors. Splurge on the fresh morels (for two anyway). Followed recipe except I did not cover the pan while the chops were in the oven or add them back to the sauce at the end as I did not want to overcook the veal. Served with caramelized-shallot mashed potatoes and salad. A special meal
