Delicious and very easy to make. I used fresh organic lavender. The honey flavor was strong so I might reduce the honey a bit. I used 1.5 c 2% milk and 1.5 c half-and-half. The ice cream was very creamy and did not get hard in the freezer. Great recipe.

I used 2 cups half and half and 1 cup light cream and added crushed fresh blueberries to the recipe (about 1 cup) - it turned the ice cream a beautiful lavender color and my husband said this is the best ice cream he's ever had!

I have made this many times and it always a great hit. Guests remember it fondly. I use lavender from my yard and honey from the beekeeper around the corner. The high quality ingredients make all the difference. I gave my copy of the recipe away so I am back on the site gearing up for another batch.

Not very good. I followed other reviewers' recommendations - 1.5 c. half and half/ 1.5 c. cream/ 1+ TB lavendar/ .5 cup honey. Steeped for 20 minutes. The lavendar wasn't overwhelming but the flavor just wasn't that good. And, the ice cream was too rich (something that I've never said before). Too many other great ice creams out there to make this one again. As a note, if you do make it, mine started to almost curdle on the reheat before it got to 170. I took it off the heat then. After it cooled all night, I used a handblender to smooth it out. The texture ended up pretty nice.

Amazing! I took the advice of the other reviewers and made the following changes to the recipe: 1.5 cups each of half and half and cream, 1.5 TB lavender steeped for 15 minutes, and 1/3 cup of wildflower honey. I put it in the fridge overnight and churned it for 25 minutes before freezing for six hours. DELICIOUS!

This is amazing and a real hit with a homey almond bundt cake. The flavor is so subtle and refreshing. I recommend following the recipe exactly as written and would not leave the lavender flowers in the ice cream for texture. Tastes too much like grass if you do that.

Made this for my sweetie for Valentine's Day. We both thought that the honey might be overbearing but the taste was perfectly mild and gave it a smoothness. Served with strawberries - it was an end to an excellent meal!

I was tasting as I went along and thought it'd be a huge hit. Once I added the eggs, it was over. Something--I don't know what--was lost to the custard taste/consistency. The lavender flavor had been wonderful, but then became much too pine-y.

I've made this many times and love it! It's best served in small quantities and goes well with other desserts that have relatively simple flavors, such as an almond cake. I have lightened it up by using 1.5 cups each of heavy cream & half-and- half and it is just as good. I've been told it makes a milkshake that is "like drinking ambrosia!"

I love this ice cream. I have now made it 4 times in a row and the word has gotten out - - my friends are requesting this ice cream. I find that it tastes better the 2nd or 3rd day and that right after it's made the lavender flavor can be a bit intense.

Wow, this is an amazing recipe. I have an obsession with lavender flavored foods, it started with Bi-Rite Creamery's honey lavender ice cream - or was it Christopher Elbow's lavender caramel chocolate truffles? Who knows? I made this yesterday in my brother's high end ice cream maker. It was ridiculously simple to make and unbelievably good. I didn't really measure the lavender - I used fresh blossoms from the potted lavender on the patio and chopped them up. Maybe about 3 tbsp total. I changed the cream quantities per the other reviewers; I actually did 1/2 and 1/2 (1.5 c heavy cream and 1.5 c half and half.) I also used less honey - I couldn't say how much but maybe a little less than 1/2 c. I also left the lavender bits in, which I don't really recommend unless you chop them really finely in a food processor, mine are a little too big. I think you could do 2 c half and half and 1 c heavy whipping cream and it would be just as good. All in all, this is incredible. This is only my 2nd time making ice cream - I made salted caramel a few months ago and it was labor intensive and not as good.

One of my favorite flavors! Next time I'll probably ease up on the cream. A bit too heavy. I also cut the amount of lavender in 1/2. BUT I didn't skim it out. I crushed the flowers and kept it in. Love the extra texture.

Delicious! I used lavender buds that were freshly picked from our garden and followed the recipe as written. I served two small scoops in pretty little bowls. It made a rich, exotic desert.

I've made this recipe twice now with fresh sage instead of lavender (it's what we have in the garden). Excellent!

Great recipe. I served it with a strawberry tart and it was a great combination. Based on previous reviews I did cut down the honey and wish I didn't. I used a clover honey (which I believe is a mild honey). I think the recipe is right on...

Yummy! I loved this recipe. Definitely prefer this recipe over the other one that people are recommending (Profiteroles with Honey Lavender Ice Cream - too heavy and rich for me.) I prefer a lighter ice cream, as opposed to a custard consistency, so I switched the amounts of the half & half and cream, added some vanilla and let the lavender steep for 20 minutes as opposed to 30. It came out PERFECT. A great summer treat.

This recipe was excellent -- as a starter. If you are looking for an unusual ice cream with a really intricate and complex flavor profile, then this is a recipe for you. I made this with 4 egg yolks instead of 2 eggs as others had suggested and I thought it might have been a little too rich for my taste -- you will have to experiment. Definitely switch the amounts for the cream and half and half to avoid the cold grease texture (and to cut some of the calories). Most importantly the recipe's biggest flaw, and ironically one of its best features, is the honey. I used 1/2 cup of "mild" (whatever mild is) honey instead of the 3/4 cup suggested and I still found the honey flavor powerfully overwhelmed the lavender. I would probably cut it back to 1/3 or even a 1/4 cup next time. It's important to note, however, that the type of honey used can dramatically change the flavor profile of this ice cream! Find one that suits your palate and which complements your lavender and you will thoroughly satisfied... And remember -- recipes are guidelines so be adventurous!

This recipe is AMAZING...but you have to be careful which kind of lavender you use. There is very little "true English lavender" out there - most types have been cross- bred with the French variety which leads to a medicinal/harsh tasting lavender that is more suitable for potpourri than for cooking. I got my lavender from www.lavendergreen.com. It is an organic, "munstead" variety true English lavender, really mild and lovely. The honey, I used a local farmer's honey, harvested in the spring. Spring honey is nice for this recipe, it's not too overwhelming, but still flavorful. I also dropped in a dollop of truffle honey. Divine!

I would not make this again. The only thing I did like was the departure from using sugar to sweeten it to using honey. That was a nice touch. I used 4 egg yolks vs. 2 large eggs. The consistency was good but the lavender was extremely overwhelming. I used one tbsp and only steeped it for 15 minutes as other reviewers recommended. It still feels like I've been sucking on a bouquet of flowers and I only took a sample bite and that was four hours ago. Maybe lavender is just not my cup of tea but I did not like how this turned out.

I doubled the recipe and used 3tbs of lavender instead of 4, and it turned out fabulously. I brought some to a clothing swap, and it was a huge hit. One girl's eyes rolled back into her head while she was eating it.

WOW. Outstanding recipe! I did follow the suggestions posted by a few other commenters though--used only 1 1/2 TB of lavender and added 1/4 vanilla bean (scraped), and it was dee-lish!

This recipe makes a very light, creamy, tasty ice cream; I made it with orange honey and vanilla extract. I concur with the other reviewers that the amount of lavender called for is too much. I used 1 1/2 tbsp of dried lavender flowers instead of 2 tbsp, and I only steeped the cream for 15 mins instead of 30. The end result had a distinct flavor of lavender that was not overpowering. Also, if you want a thicker ice-cream, I would use 4 egg yolks instead of 2 whole eggs.

This was quite tasty, but it's also very intense. A little bit goes a long way. If you're thinking of serving this with cake, make it as plain as possible because the flavors of this ice cream will overpower everything else on the plate. I also reversed the amounts of cream and 1/2 and 1/2 so it didn't have a greasy mouth-feel. But it was certainly delicious.

Added a bit of thyme to cream mixture instead of lavender and left a little under-sweet. infused honey withlavender and then swirled through the ice cream. made it just a little more interesting. Served with fresh berries.

An excellent recipe. I used 4 heads of fresh lavender flowers from my garden and also added 1/4 vanilla bean sliced open and scraped. All the flavors - vanilla, honey, and lavender are distinct but blend well together. I topped this with home-made sour cherry preserves. The ice-cream churned up very smooth (I have a hand-crank ice- cream maker) which I attribute to the honey.

We loved this ice cream and had fun getting our dinner guests to guess the ingredients (most guessed cinnamon)! I highly recommend putting the mixture in a blender and whipping it right before adding to your ice cream machine. The end result is a creamy and light gelato-like treat!

This was really exceptional, and my husband said it was the best ice cream I ever made. I served it with fresh strawberries. I'd recommend this with just about any fruit dessert; in fact, I may serve this from now on instead of vanilla ice cream with fruit. I used a lavender honey, so I skipped the lavender infusion. I would think that this would work well with any honey, regardless of the use of the herb. FYI, my custard curdled (I guess it was the honey), but came out perfectly smooth in the ice cream maker.

I loved this ice cream, as I thought I would considering how much I adore lavender! However, I did have to cut the amount of lavender used. The first time I made it I followed recipe exactly and my husband made the quite accurate statement that the ice cream tasted a bit "like lavender soap". The next time I made it I cut back on the lavender a bit and didn't let the lavender stay in the cream quite as long and it turned out perfectly. Wonderful lavender flavor without being overpowering and being reminiscent of soap.

I first enjoyed honey lavender ice cream prepared by a professional chef at a private dinner, and craved it ever since. This recipe duplicates his ice cream very well. I have made it a few times now, and it was excellent served with a rustic plum tart. I caution cooks to test the flavor of the cream mixture after steeping for 15 minutes or so, as lavender varies considerably, in my experience. Once I made this without testing it half way through, and the lavender flavor was too strong, leaving an almost bitter after taste when the ice cream melted in your mouth. You will want a definite lavender taste but not too overpowering. Also, you can strain off the lavender more easily right after the steeping, and before you reheat to add the eggs. This also gives you more control of the flavor. I love lavender, this recipe is easy and great to serve for any occasion.
