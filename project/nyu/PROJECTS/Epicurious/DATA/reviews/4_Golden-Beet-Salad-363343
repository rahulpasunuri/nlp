I made this salad with beets from a friend's garden and spinach from my garden- my husband will not eat beets, and after eating this salad asked what those golden fruits were, apricots? ha, ha. Golden beets are the ticket for the non-beet eater, in combo with a good dressing. Now I'm growing golden beets in my garden too.

Really enjoyed this recipe, as did all my friends. It's particularly pretty when you slice up the beets as instructed. I roasted golden and red beets together, which had the amazing effect of staining the golden beets about a quarter inch with that dark purple. When they are sliced up, this is particularly pretty, the multi-colours.

I decided to try this recipe after I found some gorgeous beets at the store and didn't know what to do with them. I LOVE this salad, and it's beautiful presentation as well. Would be great to take to a dinner party, pot-luck..just wait to dress it. Add some grilled chicken and it's a great meal, too! We did up the amount of spinach as well.
