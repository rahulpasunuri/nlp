The base of this recipe is my go-to for almost any flavor of gelato. I will usually used frozen strawberries; leaving them on the counter, sprinkled with sugar to thaw. Grocery store frozen strawberries have dye added to them, thus I omitt the pomegranate juice and it still comes out a beautiful shade of pink. Like others mentioned, I also don't strain- the seeds are not a distraction. Due to the lack of fat, it keeps in the fridge for only a few days before crystals start to form. I am going to try the vodka trick on my next batch.

Outstanding! Having fallen in love with gelato in Buenos Aires & Italy, this was my first attempt at making gelato - a success! No pomegranate juice on hand so I subbed 1 tsp pure vanilla extract. Cut back on the sugar just a tad since I knew the fruit I was using was sweet enough. I used: 1.5 c fresh strawberries chopped fine; 1.5 c pureed thawed strawberries; 0.5 c fresh blueberries chopped.. IF I had had raspberries, I would have included this too to replicate the 'wild berries of the woods' gelato I had in B.A. Sigh ... gorgeous stuff. Served this, along with two sorbets and an ice cream made earlier in the week as the dessert buffet at Saturday's dinner party gathering. A hit with everyone. Proud to serve this - just be sure to take it out 15 min before serving to soften a bit.

This gelato has the perfect texture! It was really delicious and simple to make--though I suggest just going out and buying pomegranate juice since juicing it yourself is a major pain. A bunch of people in my house have been asking me to make it again and I certainly will!

Very good. It is critical though to have really tasty strawberries. Mine were not the most flavorful but it still turned out great. I used my Vita-mix to puree the strawberries and strained it but it was not necessary since the seeds became completely blended. I did not have pomegranate juice but I had Cran-Strawberry juice so I used that and I can't really say how much it helped but it was a hit with everyone in the family.

Quick and easy (for gelato or ice cream) and delicious. I have made it with both fresh and frozen strawberries with equal success. I have also added chopped bittersweet chocolate on occasion. I have never added the pomegranate juice so I'm not sure what I might be missing but my gelato is typically a pale pink rather than neon which I would imagine would be off-putting.

My go to recipe for a quick, easy and delicious light dessert! Try it with other fruits, too.

I used a third of the pomegranate juice and the gelato was a pretty pink, but I agree with others that it can be eliminated.

This is a super simple gelato recipe. Like other reviewers, I skipped the pomegranate juice and it turned out just fine. I recently made this recipe with bananas instead of the strawberry and it is super delicious. I do like the fact, this recipe does not require eggs....

Amazing! Even better than custard based ice cream. I made this recipe exactly as written except I omitted the pomegranate juice and added 2 tablespoons lemon juice. I am definitely going to try this with other fruits as well - white peaches are next.

This is a great and easy recipe. I skipped the straining step and skipped the pomegranate juice. It came out wonderfully fresh tasting and had a lovely consistency and color. I will try it with different fruit and perhaps with nuts and cocoa. I do like the idea of making such a smooth ice cream dessert without a lot of egg yolks.

This is a fantastic recipe. I used 1/2 c of the sugar in the base and 1/4 c to macerate the berries. Add 1 tbsp vodka (to this and other gelato/ice cream/sorbet recipes) to keep it from freezing too hard. I have made it with and without the pomegranate juice. It makes the gelato a garish colour. Not necessary. Don't strain the pureed berries. Other than that, the recipe is perfect! Have already made it many times.

I made this over the weekend and thought it was really great! Very easy to prepare and had a great flavor! I also like that it doesn't have all the egg yolks of ice cream.

I didn't strain the strawberries either and added lemon juice instead of pomegranate juice as that's what I had. It turned out really well!

This gelato is excellent and so easy to make. No need to strain the strawberries. I tried and it was a pain. After you puree the strawberries just add it to the cream mixture and refrigerate for 3 hours.
