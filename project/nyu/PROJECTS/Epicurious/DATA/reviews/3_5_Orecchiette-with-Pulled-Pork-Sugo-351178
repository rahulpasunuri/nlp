This is good. It's not great, and for some reason none of the kids liked it. I should have made a regular meat sauce for their pasta. Anyway, I would eat it again, but would I make it again, not sure. The roast pork was really delicious on its own actually, should have turned it into pulled pork tacos instead. It was easy to make, but I had to be home all afternoon for the roasting part. Other than that, simple. I'll eat the leftovers tonight, maybe it will be more interesting after sitting in the fridge.

Loved this recipe. I slow roasted the pork in a crock pot overnight, then skimmed off the fat and pulled it apart and made the sugo. I did not have orecchiette on hand but used a different pasta. It was a hit and I will definitely make it again. This would also taste nice over homemade polenta with lots of parmesan.

I agree with the previous reviewer. This dish is fantastic. My only problem with it is the time it all takes to put together, which was a lot, especially since I couldn't find dried orecchiette and had to make my own. We loved it.

I can't believe some people didn't like this. We fell in love with this dish! The day before, I roasted a 4lb. butt that had been bubbed down with smashed garlic and s&p at 275 pretty much all day, with a little veg. broth in the pot. I uncovered it for the last two hours. We had some for dinner that night, it almost made me cry, it was so good. When I made the recipe, I used fresh oragano (all I had) so I used more than called for. And more garlic, and I didn't use as much chicken stock or as much pasta water (only 1/4 cup maybe), it just didn't seem to need it. I also didn't stir in the olive oil at the end. But the results were amazing!! And they are even better today.

I made this dish last night and about the best thing I can say is that it was edible. It wasn't necessarily bad tasting, but given the amount of time it takes to prepare, I was expecting something spectacular. Would definitely not bother making this again. There is a Giada recipe for Short Rib pasta that although beef, produces a similarly meaty sauce, but it is outstanding. I will stick to that the next time I want a hearty meat sauce pasta.

I had some extra cooked pork butt on hand. I downsized the recipe for two, and it was fabulous. This was a superb way to use leftover pork.

I suspect that the previous reviewer gave this dish 4 forks because he or she DIDN'T make the dish with the pasta. I also thought it was pretty good before the pasta was added - not great or complex, just tasty. However, once the pasta went in with the pasta water, the flavor was completely diluted. I would be tempted to try it again without any pasta and increase the amount of beans...kind of turning it into a roasted pork and bean stew.

This dish is delicious, substantial and simple to make. I actually didn't prepare it with the orecchiette because I was taking it to a dinner party where a pasta dish was already being served, so I threw in a whole can of cannellini beans and served it as a braised meat dish. Everyone loved it. It was even better the next day, which makes it a perfect make-ahead dish (without the pasta, of course). I made it again a week later (again without the orecchiette) and discovered at the last minute that I was out of oregano, so I used an equal amount of dried thyme; the results were just as delicious. If making without the pasta, I would cut back on the salt just a bit, maybe using just 1/2 tsp to salt the meat when roasting. Important tip: if your roast comes tied with twine, remove it before roasting. It cuts down on the cooking time. I can't wait to try it again *with* the orecchiette! P.S. made without the pasta, it freezes beautifully.
