This reflects the "to each their own". I find it disgusting to see people comment arrogantly against "American" dishes such as enchilada casserole. It is all a matter of taste. Food all over the world has morphed into a mingling of cultures and popped out hybrids of dishes that give everyone something to enjoy. And, Mexico's dishes are a morphing of Spanish-European and Indian influences..I found this sauce to be ok...guess I am used to the delicious Sonoran sauces of my native Arizona. All a matter of taste!!

Would just like to inform the person who called these a "nice change from traditional enchiladas" that these ARE the traditional enchiladas. It's an American tradition to make those soggy casserole abominations, often laden with canned enchilada sauce or, disgustingly, even cream of chicken soup. Needless to say, I was happy to try this twist on authentic enchiladas, though it was very time consuming for what it was. I felt the chicken was unnecessary, though a nice treat. Think I'll stick to my potato and cheese enchiladas.

This was challenging in terms of time and the sauce. But it is really worth it. I kind of messed with this recipe a lot but the end result was still enchiladas. I used a rotisserie chicken, and mixed the cooked carrots, potatoes, and chopped chicken with some sauce to fill the tortillas (cooked for a few moments in oil to soften). I poured the sauce on the bottom of the dish and over the top, with a bare sprinkling of cheese. Delicious. The sauce I will definitely make again. I've frozen some and hope it will keep.

things i changed: added the par- cooked vegies to the chicken with a little of the chile sauce; i fried the tortillas in oil for about 15 seconds, then dipped them in the sauce filled them with the chicken and vegies rolled em and put them in a pan, pan enchilada style. they were great. very flavorful. i served them with Ranch Beans and GREEN POBLANO RICE (ARROZ VERDE AL POBLANO). everyone loved it and would eat it again in a heartbeat.

I made this tonight and loved it. My boyfriend said that it was the best dish I've ever made for him (and I've been cooking for over 2 years from Epicurious). The only changes I made is that I did not hav enough dried Guajillo chiles (there were only 5 in the package I bought) so I did extra Ancho's instead.. so it had more of a "kick". Also, instead of using 3 pickled jalapenos cut in half, I used 5 jalapenos, and sliced them thinly, so there was a small bite of jalapeno (pickled jalapeno's are MUCH milder than fresh ones) in every bite. Otherwise, I made it by the book, and we loved it. My only advice is to wear gloves when de-seeding the dried peppers. Even after two soap washings of m y hands after cooking, My eyes are burning from touching them. This recipe (with the sauce) is EXTREMELY time consuming, but well worth the effort if you want a true Mexican flavored dish. I live in Tucson ( 40 minutes from Mexico) and this has the real smoked pepper flavor that you find there. I also love that it isn't buried in cheese like typical Mexican-American fare.

Is there something missing from this recipe? There are neither ancho nor guajillo chilis in the sauce?

My family really enjoyed these enchiladas. The sauce was delicious although I did add some extra salt.

After spending hours making this dish, not one person (out of 8) enjoyed it. The chile sauce is tasteless and since everything in the recipe is dipped and fried in it, the entire dish is tasteless. Not one person ate more than two bites off their plate. I followed the recipe exactly as printed. Horrible!!!!!!

Only 3 changes, boneless, skinless chicken thighs, flour tortillas and feta cheese. I doubt that my chicken broth is as tasty as it would be with bones and skins from the chicken, but I used what I had. Scrumptious food and a pleasant change from traditional enchiladas. The chili sauce is terrific, too. I served this with black beans.
