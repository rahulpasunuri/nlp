This was a really nice recipe that I made for an informal Christmas eve dessert. The currants added a surprising tartness to the rich chocolate flavor. I made more crust as suggested by another reviewer, which proved to be a good idea. I also added more orange zest to the custard to give it a stronger flavor. It was a big hit with all the chocolate lovers in my family.

One of the best desserts that I have ever made. So good in fact, that I received a marriage proposal from friend at the table, with her husband sitting right there! ;)

Yum! I made this for Thanksgiving as the chocolate dessert and once again BA did not disspoint. As some other reviewers I was a little leary of the currents in the filling, but they were a great combo with the nutmeg. It made it very Thanksgiving appropriate. The orange custard sauce added a nice flavor balance as well(quantity was a bit much I agree-but it was pretty tasty with pumpkin pie as well so no loss). It definitely goes into to keeper file.

Here is a testament to the power of the internet. I remembered making this recipe a long time ago, and a quick search for "bourbon chocolate currant tart" found it again for me. As for the recipe, this is a great one. Easy to make, nice dense texture, and the currants give a nice contrast. This will again grace the table for Thanksgiving this year. As one other reviewer noted, the sauce recipe makes a little too much. I use a tart pan, but if you don't have one, a springform will work, too. Only work the crust a little up the sides and you will be fine.

This is definitely a tart for chocolate lovers! I was somewhat disappointed that the flavor of the bourbon-soaked currants didn't come through more strongly....perhaps more bourbon flavor would be helpful. However, the orange custard sauce was delicious! I took the advice of a previous reviewer and added some G. Marnier. Very nice! The flavor combinations were good. Not one of the best desserts I've made/had, but certainly worthy of another try.

This is the best dessert I have ever made. It was so very rich and so very delicious. Big hit with our friends and my husband couldn't stop raving. Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe in stages over 2 days before Thanksgiving. It received rave reviews. The bourbon-soaked currants are a great counterpoint to the richness of the chocolate and custard. Delicious!

I also made extra chocolate wafers to insure that I had enough to coat the 9 inch pan. This is a great easy dessert. I added a few splashes of grand marnier to the orange custard sauce and it was a hit.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year, it was a big hit. I wouldn't change anything-but I needed to make more of the crust than was listed here even though I used a 9 inch pan. Wonderful!

Really yummy, maybe even 4 forks but i am not bowing at its feet. I was concerned about the currents (I'm not generally a big fan of raisons in dessert) but they added a great and necessary balance. The orange-current sauce made WAY too much, so maybe only make 1/2 or 2/3 the recipe -- it's definitely a delicious addition. Finally, I had no idea what "chocolate wafer cookies" were but they are an actual item sold by nabisco in the cookie aisle (called "famous wafer cookies") and they made the crust great and super easy to make.

I made this for a dinner party. Big Hit! I did error in letting the filling get too cool and then had trouble spreading in on the cookie crumb crust without breaking the crust. But, after saying the "F" word several times in rapid succession I patched is up a bit and it turned out fabulously. The orange custard sauce is sensational! Since they are in season I used grated zest from Clementines then sectioned a couple of them and served the sections on top of the tart.

I made this for the first time last year for Christmas. Everyone loved it! Even the people who don't go nuts over chocolate loved this tart.

If they allowed me to rate this recipe a 10 I would. This is now my favorite desert. Very easy to make and very, very rich.

I have made this many times for my family over the years. My daughters are chocololics and so am I. We love the tart's rich creamy texture and the buzz of chocolate it gives. It is rich, rich. My wife is not a chocololic and she can only handle a small slice. Too bad for her. I think it is best when it has sat in the frig. for a day and sets up nice and firm. Easy to make too.
