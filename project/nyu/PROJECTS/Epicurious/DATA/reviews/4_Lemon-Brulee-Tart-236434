Delicious! No changes to recipe (other than serving with lightly sweetened whipped cream and increasing the amount of sugar on top by 50%). Great crust - not too difficult to roll, and didn't shrink. The brûlée topping was the perfect addition to a basic lemon tart.

I love this recipe -- it is so easy and absolutely delicious. Tonight I'm not doing the brulee part--serving with some mascarpone on the side instead. The brulee is not as crisp on the second day and since the 2 of us aren't going to devour a whole tart I' skipping that bit--well ok e could devour the whole thing but that would be sheer gluttony!

Refreshing and scrumptious! I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and the tanginess was a most welcome twist to the usual holiday desserts. I made one change-I added 1/3 cup of granulated white sugar to the pie crust because I personally enjoy a mildly sweet crust with all my tarts and pies. Don't feel like you need to purchase pie weights-my leftover basmati rice worked perfectly. Just be careful when pouring the lemon curd into the crust. The instructions tell you to pour while the crust is on the rack for a reason..which I choosed not to follow. The purpose is to prevent spillage while transporting the pan back to the oven. In any case, I'm adding this recipe to my repertoire!

Rave reviews for a dinner party. My tart pan is 11 inches so I increased everything proportionally, and used more sugar (turbinado) for the brulee crust. I had been searching for the perfect lemon tart, and this is my new go to recipe.

This was fabulous, though I did change the recipe - I doubled the cream and topped the tart with toasted almonds instead of the sugar crust, since I don't have a blowtorch. Highly recommended as a variation.

This tart was one of my contributions to the giant Thanksgiving dinner at my in-laws. It was an incredible success with many of the guests asking for the recipe. I am planning on making it again this evening for my husband's birthday tomorrow.

We decided on this for Thanksgiving dessert, and I wish I'd made a pumpkin creme brulee instead. While definitely lovely after a big meal, I thought it was just OK. There were only 4 of us for dinner, so we didn't finish it - and it doesn't keep well, so you might want to try it for a larger crowd.

Brought this to Thanksgiving, to rave reviews. After such a big, heavy dinner, this was just the type of dessert that most people were in the mood for, and in fact, it was the only one that completely disappeared. My one change would be to double the sugar for the brulee crust, as it came out very thin and so lacked that fabulous brulee crunch.
