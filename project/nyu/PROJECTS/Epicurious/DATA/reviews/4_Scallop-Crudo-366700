Absolutely delicious! I made this as an appetizer on New Years Eve for my family, who are all big foodies, and received rave reviews. I followed suggestions from other reviewers and used 1T of white miso paste and, once plated, a couple of dashes of soy sauce on each dish. Very easy to make and presents well. My husband loved it so much that he asked for it again the following night. This recipe is a definite keeper!!

Very, very tasty. After reading the previous comments regarding the actual brown color of the sauce versus the color shown in the pic I decided to try using a nicely rounded tablespoon of miso paste plus just a dash of soy sauce instead of the amount of soy called for in the recipe. The color was pretty close to the pic, and the flavor got a thumbs up all around. I had a red/white miso mix on hand, but a white miso would turn out even better I assume. I'd also suggest having more Thai chilis on hand if you want as much as shown in the pic. Either way, this is a great crudo concept. Try it.

Very, very tasty. After reading everyone's critique of the difference in color between the pic and the outcome of the actual recipe I decided to try using 2T of miso paste dissolved in the citrus, plus just a dash of soy sauce instead of the amount of soy sauce called for. The color was pretty close to the pic, and the flavor got a thumbs up all around. Not sure what Jean-George would say, but think you'll be happy with the color difference if you try it. I used a red/white mix miso paste, but white miso would be even better. Either way, this is a winner crudo concept.

Spectacular, spectacular! As everyone else has noted, the sauce was brown but delicious. Two people who do not like scallops were floored. The best recipe for scallops I have ever made.

I made this recipe exactly as written. It looked so beautiful that I just had to give it a try. There is no way that picture reflects the recipe with the soy sauce! The sauce comes out brown---not that beautiful yellow-orange pictured. That was very disappointing. I wouldn't make it again.

Great recipe. Agree with comment above sauce is much lighter in color. I think it's got to be an appetizer as is; the scallops are savory and almost buttery like this, but a little much for me to eat more than about a scallop's worth. To serve as an entree, I used the sauce as a marinade, seared the scallops for a minute, and then put them back in the sauce. Totally different, and still as great. I used the sherry vinegar to make a vinaigrette for a salad, which went great with the scallops. Also subbed olive oil for the sunflower oil.

Made this last night and it was delicious. I had to substitute white balsamic vinegar for sherry vinegar, since it was reasonably close flavor-wise, and the dressing is much darker than the beautiful photo from the magazine because of the soy sauce (did they even use soy sauce in the version photographed?)... that said, with really good fresh local scallops and fresh herbs, this is a really easy and delicious side or entree (I followed the recipe but served it for two instead of four portions). I will definitely make it again, AND the dressing is so good I'd try it with grilled steak for a steak salad and/or chicken
