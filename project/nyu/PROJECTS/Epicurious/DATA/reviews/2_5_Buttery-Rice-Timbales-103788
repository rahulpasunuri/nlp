I've made several variations of this, but I mainly had to write because of the idiot who complained it was bland and colorless. HELLO!!! Read the recipe! IT'S RICE!!! And this is a nice foil for saucy recipes. Sheeeesh.

I have made these twice, following directions exactly, and we love it. It has turned out very flavorful and the technique works. It's an easy way to have an impressive presentation.

I've made this several times. I use it as a filler dish. When all other dishes have alot of flavors this will go well in order to clean your palette. It's very easy and it makes no more of a mess than when you put the H2O in rice-a-roni.

The rice held together well (which is always an accomplishment!). The taste was very bland and presentation lacks color. If I make this again I will add herbs for color and flavor. It was very boring!!! (I used a few of the vegetables I had prepared to garnish it to attempt to "pretty it up a bit".) Also worth mentioning, when adding the broth mixture into the rice saucepan, the pan erupted LIKE A VOLCANO, violent bubbling and throwing hot liquid all over the cooktop. If you prepare this dish, be very careful adding the broth mixture. Do it slowly and step back!!!
