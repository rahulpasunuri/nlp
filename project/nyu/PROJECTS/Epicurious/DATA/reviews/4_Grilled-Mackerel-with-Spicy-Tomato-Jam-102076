As others suggested, we used canned Muir Glen tomatoes and only a 1/4 cup of jam. This is definitely on our list to repeat!

We doubled this recipe for eight people and enjoyed a great main dish of Spanich mackerel that we removed from the Gulf of Mexico that same afternoon. Easy recipe with great results. Even the non-fish eaters liked the results.

oh -- and I used Muir Glen's roasted diced canned tomatoes. Nice, subtle smokiness and high-quality tomatoes.

I've made this jam for bluefish a couple of times and think it's PERFECT. Nice balance of spciy/sweet really cuts the richness of fish. I've also served it with grilled shrimp and toasted country bread. I leave out the tarragon, tho I love anything anise-y: it doesn't really 'fit' the flavors, imho. I agree with another reviewer -- use whatever jelly you have convenient. I used rosehip jelly and wild plum jelly -- different result, both tasty.

Great accompaniment for otherwise bland fish. Used apricot preserves instead of apple and it worked just as well. Double the recipe, though to ensure enough jam to go around.

Served this at a party. Guests loved it, but I personnally though that it was a bit sweet. I'd reduce the jelly (you can use any light fruit - apricot, apple, peach) to 1/4 cup and increase the salt to 1/2 t. It was pleasantly spicy and went well with the fish.
