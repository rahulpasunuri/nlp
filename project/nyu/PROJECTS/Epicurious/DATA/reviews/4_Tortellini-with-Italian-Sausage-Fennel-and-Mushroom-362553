I've made this four times now and felt the need to defend it from folks who said it looks nasty. I added a couple of my own photos because I don't think it looks bad at all. It's easy to make. This recipe is the only time I have used fennel at all and I don't cut it particularly thin. I cut off the green parts and only use the part on the bottom that looks like an onion. I don't use the fronds and last night I omitted the fennel seeds because I was out. It still turned out wonderfully. Its a great recipe.

This was somewhat tasty and smelled heavenly -- but it was nasty looking. Certainly all of the sense should be involved in a good meal.

This is somewhat tasty and smells heavenly -- but it is very ugly looking. It would be hard to convince my family to taste it. Certainly all of the senses should be involved in a great meal.

Very good. Followed the recipe exactly except browned the sausage first and then the mushrooms and fennel. As others have said, slice the fennel very thin.

Pretty good. I would make this again. But instead of using a cream like sauce. I would probably use fresh tomatoes or a tomato sauce.

I replaced the chicken broth with wine. Make sure the fennel is sliced very thinly.

You don't need to use cream to enjoy this recipe. I about 1/4 cup of white wine instead of the cream and broth, and it came out really nicely. I also added in cherry tomatoes instead of mushrooms and used whole wheat corkscrew pasta. Came out really great.

Such a hit! I made it with a friend several months ago and we're still talking about it. We omitted the fennel seeds because I didn't have any, and we certainly didn't miss them.

This was a very easy and delicious meal. The fennel had nice flavor.

My husband and I went crazy over this recipe! I wouldn't change a thing. It reminded my husband of a dish he used to be able to get at a favorite Italian restaurant. I did add a bit more garlic. I will use this again and proudly serve it to guests!

This was almost but not quite perfect but I would definitely make it again. I felt it just needed a little bit more flavor. The store was out of Italian sausage so I substituted a sun dried tomato basil chicken sausage which was wonderful with the fennel seeds. I would also increase the garlic and I did not care for the parmesan. I might also use a flat pasta, like pappardelle, instead of the tortellini (I wished I had undercooked the tortellini because the extra steps at the end resulted in an overdone pasta).

Delicious. I used Italian style sausage made with chicken (less fat) and decided not to add the fennel seeds, as they were fairly prominent in the sausage. Oh, and I did thoroughly brown it before adding the fennel and mushrooms to the skillet. At the end, I added a full teaspoon of freshly grated pepper to kick it up a bit. I suppose red pepper flakes would have been another option. Overall, it was a tasty, flavorful and satisfying entree and I would make it again.

Absolutely fabulous! A keeper for this family. I'll be making this over and over! We used fresh plain and spinach tortellini filled with 3 cheeses...

This is really tasty, but was a little rich for us. I halved the recipe, since there are just the two of us, and we have plenty of leftovers.

This was pretty good and was a great way to use up a big bulb of fennel I'd gotten in my weekly basket from the food co-op we belong to. The flavor of the fennel went well with the Italian sausage. I used 1/2 mild and 1/2 spicy sausage as I generally prefer the mild. I made the mistake of subbing some kale I had on hand for the spinach and, though I do like kale, it did not make a good substitution. I gave the recipe three stars because it was easy and pretty good but not really anything special.

I've made this a few times, and love it. I've never used the seeds before, but I just bought some at the market, so will try that next time. I usually just use half and half instead of the heavy stuff. Doubling the garlic is a good idea, too!

we were excited to try this recipe since fennel is currently in season. We really enjoyed the meal, there was lots of flavor and we did not need to add any salt which we often do. next time we may try browning the sausage before adding the veggies for even more flavor.

This recipe is amazing! I found it easy to cook (once I figured out the fennel bulb) and my boyfriend and I both loved it. Makes great leftovers, too.

Very easy and good ingredients for a very tasty family meal. Everyone enjoyed dinner.

Made this tonight and it was DELISH! I eliminated fennel seeds and used left over sausage. I also cut recipe in half since I was only feeding 2 people. Not a single morsel was left over. This was the first time I've ever used Fennel bulb and did not know what to expect. My husband said this is a KEEPER!

This was a smash!!!! I made it as written and it was absolutely yummy!!! Will make again for sure!!

Crazy delicious. I was cooking for 4 and decided at the very last minute not to halve the recipe, which turned out to be a good idea, since it was almost all gone. Skipped the spinach due to picky eaters and added an extra handful of mushrooms instead. I also went half-and-half on spicy vs. sweet sausage, which turned out great - any spicier and I feel like it would have overpowered the fennel. I will basically be making this recipe forever.

This recipe is so seriously good. I don't have a lot of time for cooking so this was the main and only course and though it says 8 servings, if it is the only thing it served four, at least in our house. It was so yummy everyone wanted seconds! I followed the recipe exactly, but could see that it could easily be modified for individual tastes.

This is so good! Just got back from vacationing in Asia - and we decided this will be our first American homecooked meal. Have actually made a few times with penne (and it's phenomenal); will try with tortellini for first time tonight.

Great recipe. Can easily be adapted to individual tastes. It is also a great recipe for for those who find the flavor of fennel overwhelming, the combination of ingredients creates an amazing combo.

This was really delicious and easy to make. I left out the fennel seeds but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will chop the fennel more finely (lengthwise and crosswise) as it is a very strong flavor and per my preferences will use sweet instead of spicy sausage and use a little more mushroom and a little less sausage.

This is simply delicious comfort food thoroughly gobbled up by 3 generations! I'm so glad I doubled the recipe for the 4 1/2 of us, because we ate so much that we fought over the leftovers! I more than doubled the garlic and it was perfect. I did not add the fennel seeds because they can often be overwhelming, but next time I will experiment with half the amount. I also think I'll try mixing sweet sausage with hot, since we all like spicy food. Try it!

I used half the amount of fennel seed and twice the cream (by accident), and just used regular pasta tubes rather than tortellini. It was great! I may add more fennel bulb next time. Delicious. Looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

This has become a standard in my house. It is quick, easy to prepare and very tasty.

I changed amounts of ingredients. I only wanted 4 servings. I used all the fennel, half of the sausage, half of the mushrooms, fennel seeds. I wanted it creamier so used 1 cup whipping cream and only half of the chicken broth, tortellini. Used all of the spinach and cheese. It was fantastic and I will definitely make this easy recipe again.

Oh my goodness this is one of the best recipes I have ever made. I try lots of different things on epicurious, but this is the first time I have been inspired enough to write a review. The only change I made was instead of using fresh fennel, I used belgian endives (the store was out of fennel). Endives have a very similar texture to fennel, but the flavor isn't as strong, so I think this would be a great substitution for those who aren't huge fans of the anise flavor. Followed the rest of recipe exactly, with cheese tortellini, and oh wow, I want to eat this every day.

LOVE THIS! Made it twice. First time browned sausage first to drain fat. Forgot 2nd time...will def go back to browning sausage first next time. The fennel is the best part!!!

Wonderful one dish meal. Followed directions exactly. Purchased sausage from Fresh Market so it wasn't very fatty. Serve with fresh crusty bread!

The family loved this - even the picky eaters. I'm not a fennel fan, so I skipped the seeds and just used the fronds for garnish, which left the dish with just a sweet hint of it. Easy and yummy.

Delicious! Used half and half instead of cream. I did have to use most of a second cup of chicken broth to get it "saucy" enough. One recommendation though, I would brown the sausage first in order to drain the fat then cook veg in with meat. Will definitely make again.
