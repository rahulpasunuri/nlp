This was really tasty and went over well at a dinner party for 8. I doubled the recipe, using boneless, skinless breasts and thighs which reduced the cooking time significantly. Used whole wheat cous cous, and cranberries, apricots, peaches and prunes. Needed a bit more salt, but overall a definite keeper.

Next time I will use skinless chicken. We don't eat the skin and I don't think it added much. I used cherries, golden raisins and prunes. I didn't have chicken broth so I used vegetable broth and it was delicious. As with other reviewers, I only kept about 2 tbls of the drippings. My chicken produced well over a cup. Had I not dumped it out it would have ruined the couscous. This is definitely a keeper!

Made this with boneless skinless chicken thighs, the ways it's done in the amazing Creole Mustard-Orange Sauce Chicken recipe. It cut down on the cooking time and the greasiness that other reviews have commented on. Subtle but really delicious - will definitely make it again.

This is one of our favorite dishes any time of year. Healthy and extremely satisfying. Sometimes I make the couscous to go with other proteins. The chicken works equally well whether you use legs, or breasts.

OK so I made this for the final night of Chanukkah. I'll be honest my husband doesnt like sweet dinners and he complained mercilessly about the "very goyish" fruits in the cous-cous but when finally he stopped kvetching, he ate every bit I put on his plate and he acknowleged that it was in fact "delicious" and he thanked me for making it! All in all a rather easy dinner. I added toasted almonds as many suggested, I used kosher bone in breasts and cooked 20 minutes on 400, after first browning in the pan they came out Juicy and perfect. My one other change-I wasn't about to include all of those fatty drippings in my cous-cous so I just started a new pan with 1 Tablespoon of Olive oil and it came out great.

This is a favorite of friends and family. I often get requests for this dish. I generally double the recipe!

We enjoyed this super easy dish. As suggested I cooked the chicken for ten minutes longer and added chopped almonds to the couscous. I couldn't find my ginger, so I tossed the chicken the cinnamon, but also a tablespoon of jerk seasoning. It was really lovely and seemingly more complex than it was.

What I liked about this recipe is that it is very tasty, quick and easy. I did not put the chicken in the oven and next time I will, unless I used boneless breast cut into small pieces.

Sorry, in addition to the previous review, I also roasted a handful of pine nuts and tossed them into the broth mixture.

This is a delicious and simple weekday dish to make! I salted the chicken before browning and it added great flavour. I used apricots, prunes, figs and raisins. I actually salted the broth mixture before stirring in the cous cous. And I sprinkled some red pepper flakes before serving for some added spice. Definitely a keeper. And I would also cook the chicken in the oven for about 25 - 30 minutes as opposed to the suggested 20. I also added a dash of vermouth only because I used about 10 oz of cous cous and needed the liquid. But then again, some vermouth or fry white wine never hurts!

Overall, I thought the couscous was awesome, but found the chicken greasy (and I dumped most of the oil) and just not impressive. I'd adjust the recipe to brown and then braise the chicken in diced tomato with the same spices (more of them), or else roast a whole chicken with the same spices.

A delightful and yummy surprise. The flavors do wonderful and exciting things together.

The recipe only asks to cook the chicken in the oven for 15 minutes. I took the chicken out after 15 minutes and the inside was completely raw. I ended up roasting the chicken for 45 minutes, and it was perfectly cooked. The chicken was so tender and juicy. Absolutely love the cinnamon flavor. The couscous was supposed to be cooked with chicken pan dripping. But there was just too much oil from the chicken fat and skin. I only left about a tablespoon of the dripping and fat to use. Since boyfriend doesn't like sweet too much, I was worried that the dried food might make the couscous too sweet for his taste. But it didnt. It was savory from the chicken stock with a hint of sweetness from the dried fruit. So good! This recipe is definitely a keeper. It was really easy to make, and it tastes amazing! Will make it again soon.

This is a keeper...easy to make, and I think it could be easily increased to make a large amount for a gang!

Have made this recipe again and again, mostly for parties and company because it always gets such rave reviews. A forgiving recipe, you can alter amounts of various ingredients (i.e. forget exactly what goes into it) and it still tastes fabulous!

What a great weeknight meal. Super easy to prepare. It had a great sweet savory thing going on. We paired our with some lowfat plain yogurt, yum. The leftovers were even better today for lunch. I will certainly make this dish again. My three year old son loved it as well, thats always a good sign.

Let me begin with it's easy. I was definitely disappointed with the flavor. A bit greasy and lack luster.

This is one of my favorite party dishes -- it's easy to make large quantities, much of the preparation can be done ahead, and everyone loves it. I've substituted orzo for the couscous in the past with great results. I also add pine nuts.

A hit at our house last night. Used thighs and bone-in breasts and they came out perfectly. Added a little cayenne for a bit of heat, and used Israeli couscous, which really complimented the chicken. Easy to make and nice enough for company fare

Very, very good and easy to make. And, especially if you use organic cous cous and chicken raised without hormones, it's healthy!

This recipe was incrediable. My mom and I were looking for something different to make for my dads birthday dinner and we came across this dish. It was a huge hit. The chicken was so flavorful and moist. I loved it and so did everyone else. One thing we added to the couscous and driedfruit part was almonds. The almonds were a nice little touch. For the other dried fruit we used raisins, crasins, and Apricots. It looked so pretty.

Used lots less cinnamon, and added some cayenne and we liked it. The couscous is tasty and goes really well with it (again, less sweetness - only about a quarter cup of the fruit).

After searching for a few one dish meals, I tried this recipe. All in all, I thought this was a good dish. I used larger couscous and only chicken breasts (what I had on hand). Also used dried cranberries in addition to the other fruits suggested. My family ate the meal without complaint- very important with a toddler, and I will make it more often for a quick dinner dish.

I love this recipe. One change I make is to use chicken thighs only, cook (boil in stock or saute) until they are about 95% done and then shred them when cool. I add the chicken at the last minute with the other ingredients so it finishes cooking in a couple of minutes. I find the dish is quicker, uses less oil and the spices get more evenly distributed. I usually use a sweeter dried fruit, like prunes or raisins, and a tart fruit, like apricots or cranberries. I've also made this dish with the larger size couscous (could be harder to find) as well as the traditional couscous and I find that the texture of the larger couscous is a nice addition.

Easy and quite good - sweet, yes, if you don't like that use tart dried fruits such as cranberries, currants or blueberries or even work with the basics and alter as you like (maybe paprika instead of cinnamon? red peppers instead of dried fruit?). The chicken was moist, perfectly cooked with 20 minutes in the oven, however a little bland. Will try bbq sauce or lemon juice or similar during the frying phase next time to remedy that. Would easily serve 5 with a simple veggie side dish unless the chicken pieces are very small. Oh, and I did not seperate the legs and thighs...worked fine, but maybe that's why it needed 20 minutes in the oven.

This reads great, but we found it disappointing. There is a lot of fat pouring out of those skin-on thighs and drumsticks; I would suggest pouring off all but 1 tbsp of the fat. The whole thing was bland. Maybe double the fruit, triple the ground ginger. I won't be making it again because I have lots better uses for that excellent dried fruit I got for Christmas.

I agree the recipe was easy, and I love couscous, but it was too sweet for me. I used boneless chicken breast, cut up. Perhaps with the smaller pieces it absorbed too much cinnamon. I also couldn't taste the ginger at all. I would make this again, but I would try to figure out someway to cut the sweetness and cinnamon and add more of a bite to it. Perhaps some red wine or more ginger.

Made this the other night, much to my beef-and-potato-eating husband's dismay. It was very easy and quite good! The dried fruits; currents, apricots and cranberries, added wonderful punch and married well with the cinnamon and ginger. My husband a coucous hater even snuck seconds onto his plate.

Quick and different! Next time I will remove skin from the chicken. Time in the oven is probably underestimated depending on size of legs. Be sure your onions are tender before adding couscous.

I brought the recipe home and my husband made it. He said the cooking time should be increased to about 30-40 min in the oven, but that it was otherwise fairly easy. The results were darn tasty! The raisins, dried cherries and apricots he put in the couscous were so delicious with the other flavors. Mmm!

Very good and very easy. We love Middle Eastern food and this was a hit. I agree that couscous recipes are often very bland. This recipe was aromatic and interesting, but not spicy, which is great for children.

I made this recipe twice this week - once for a family dinner and got raves, even from my 3 1/2 year old grandson, who especially liked the chicken. Then I made it for an open house - I cut up the boneless chicken thighs (I only used thigh meat) into small pieces and put the finished dish in a crock pot. I served the couscous along side - using apricots and prunes... no mint, only because I didn't have any on-hand. The recipe is easy to make and very tasty. KJ in MA

Oh my sweet lawd! This was exquisite! My previous chicken/cous-cous endeavors resulted in tasty but pedestrian dishes featuring things like swiss chard. For this dish, I left out the mint, because I don't much like mint. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I used dried apricots, a few prunes, and some red currents. The result was delightful. I'll definitely make it again!

I have not had this recipe yet, but I noticed it to be very easy in preparing. I am a very busy Mom and Housewife, therefore, I am constantly looking for gourmet meals that don't take hours to prepare.

I haven't made this dish so I can't rate it - but it does look nice and I'll be making it soon. Yes a perfect dish for Hannuka here in Australia
