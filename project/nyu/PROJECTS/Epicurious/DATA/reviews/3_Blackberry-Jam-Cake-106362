Cake turned out great, used the buttermilk, followed the recipe and everyone asked for seconds. I'll make again.

Yuck! I used skim milk with lemon to substitute the buttermilk. The cake seemed to have too much liquid. It turned out a soggy, flatten mess. I had even tried to cook it for longer, but it still wouldn't set right. Plus, the cake was bright purple. I named this the "Aliens Attack" cake!
