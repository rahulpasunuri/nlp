Aren't you supposed to turn the turkey breast side up at some point?!? How are you supposed to cover breast with foil if it's breast side down in the pan?!?

I didn't use the turkey recipe, just the gravy. This is the first time I've made something other than the standard pan gravy and it came out very well. The white wine added a nice flavor and it was really easy.
