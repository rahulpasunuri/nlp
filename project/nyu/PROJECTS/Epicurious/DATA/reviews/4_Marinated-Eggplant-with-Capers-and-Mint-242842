I picked this recipe because I was doing a greek themed dinner and as it happened most of my guests were vegetarians. was a little nervous about the flavor profile - but they absolutely LOVED it!

I salted the eggplant prior to broiling (omitted the salt later) and replaced the wine vinegar with balsamic. The result was quite yummy.

Excellent. I did indeed salt, rinse and pat dry the sliced eggplants prior to broiling. I used balsamic vinegar and added some chopped garlic. The garlic is a must. I made this all summer long and it was a huge hit.

This is really 4- forks and only because other reviewers are correct about salting/draining the eggplant before broiling/grilling. Made it once as written and again by salting/draining. The latter netted nice gooey eggplant that retained shape more appealingly. That said, the mint, capers and olive oil make this baby really wonderful -- and three of us made short work of it at one sitting.

Wonderful flavors brought together and wowed my guests. So easy to prepare! I did use a little bit more oil than the recipe called for. Perfect for serving along with antipasto.

Simple and delicious recipe for marinated eggplants. Frankly, I like this way more than the one that is normally cooked in my family, involving tons of garlic. I love garlic but it tends to overpower eggplant flavor when marinated. This version has a lot more subtle yummy flavors. Oh, yeah, this will be a very small batch in the end, so double/triple up if you must cook for a party.

The flavors are pretty good on this, but the eggplant turned out pretty soggy. I think the technique one reviewer suggests for salting the eggplant and covering it overnight would be smart. I topped mine with a litte chopped tomato and mozzarella salad. If I do it again I'm going to panko bread mozzarella slices and fry them so I can get a little crunch on top.

This was a wonderful eggplant variation for a Greek Easter feast. Next time I'll double the recipe. Easy, quick, do ahead, and absolutely delicious! B.J. Harrick

This is a really great, simple, flavourful way to do eggplant. I highly recommend it!

This just might be my favorite way to eat eggplant now. The addition of the mint really kicks the whole dish up a notch and surprisingly the mint does not overpower at all. Visit http://joleneeatshere.blogspot.com for pics and details.

I loved this dish - the pairing of mint with capers is superb with eggplant. And really, it could not be any easier to throw together.

Delicious! I used a whole eggplant. It cooks down a lot, so you dont end up with as much as you might imagine. I served along with a grilled mahi mahi and pita wedges with tsatsiki. YUM!

This was really good! I usually associate eggplants with tomato-based sauce so I was hesitant but it turned out very well. We only had regular eggplants but it worked out just fine. Did not change a thing.

Even my in-laws, who have been to Italy, raved about this recipe. One tip: cut up the eggplant before serving because it doesn't look very "pretty" (it's eggplant, what do you expect?).

As I mentioned in my previous review, I made some simple changes to the recipe. I forgot to mention I didn't bother to let the eggplant marinate in the dressing - I just tossed and served and it was delicious. I also seasoned with salt and pepper (in addition to the thyme and balsamic) before broiling. It took me about 12 minutes total to make. If you want to use the 2+ hours technique that another reviewer mentioned, I'm sure it will turn out just fine, but simple slicing and broiling worked great for me!

This was so easy to make and very delicious. My boyfriend loved it, even though he thinks he doesn't like eggplant. I made simple changes: I sprinkled dried thyme and a little balsamic on the eggplant before broiling. I also didn't bother to rinse the capers.

Very nice. The use of mint is a bit of a surprise - in a good way. Mario Batali teaches a technique in which you heavily salt eggplant slices and place a weighted cookie sheet on top for 2+ hours. The eggplant is effectively and easily deprived of it's moisture, and you get PERFECTLY roasted slices. I used that technique for this recipe - and highly recommend it. Quantity of viniagrette is about double what's needed (and I removed a lot of moisture from the eggplant too).

I made this for my husband, who loves eggplant, and I found that I liked it too, even though I generally hate eggplant. I didn't rinse the capers and I did add a little salt and pepper, though. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. I think you could add garlic or crushed red pepper as other cooks suggested if you wanted to amp it up a bit.

This was okay but not exceptional. I was excited to try it because we grew a beautiful little eggplant called fairy tale this year. It is very thin and I sliced it in half and grilled it rather turn on the broiler. We also grow spearmint so I thought it would be great together but it just seemed like it needed something, like garlic or red pepper flakes or something. With all the other eggplant recipes I have, I won't be making this again. Our vegan son liked it more than us so I rated it higher than I would for just me and my husband.

Wow!Easy to make with big flavors. I ran a pair of scissors through the eggplant as it marinated to break it up into more bite-sized pieces. I'm thinking this would make an amazing sandwich. Baguette with a smear of pesto, topped with provolone, marinated eggplant and arugula. Made the rosemary flatbread too. Good, but I'd prefer the eggplant on a baguette.

YUUUMMMY! I cut the eggplants in half length-wise, oiled them, then grilled them out on the gas grill. We love the black charred parts, both for the rustic looks and the flavor. The capers and mint were a tangy and mildly sweet combo. Each flavor was a perfect balance to the other. I added a small chopped garlic and liked that layer of flavor, too. The only thing I might change is to use less vinegar. I reccomend using half of what is called for, taste, then add more to your liking. the rosemary flatbread (same issue) is a perfect match for this.
