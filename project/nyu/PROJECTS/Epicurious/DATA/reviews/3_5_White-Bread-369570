This is an exceptional bread recipe! I have been looking for a gluten free bread that actually tastes good. All of my other attempts (including one earlier tonight with Bob's Red Mill mix) have tasted pretty bad. But, this is light and quite yummy. And, best of all, really easy!

This was my first attempt at gluten free bread and I was pleasantly surprised. I over proofed it unfortunately so it did fall but it still wasn't overly heavy and tasted pretty good. I did exchange white romano bean flour for the garbanzo bean as I'm not a huge fan of the taste of the garbanzo flour.
