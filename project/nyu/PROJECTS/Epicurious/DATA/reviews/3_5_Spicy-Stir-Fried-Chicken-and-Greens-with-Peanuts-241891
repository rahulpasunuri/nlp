I was mostly interested in the sauce for the stir fry and modified it with suggestions from other reviewers to add sambal oelek. It was terrific against the greens and sweet ingredients I added (carrots, parsnips, red pepper) plus I liked the crunch of the salty peanuts with these added ingredients too! Will likely make again with the modifications, can't really imagine this recipe without them - it would be flat and colorless.

a good idea, but really needed to add more seasonings to to make it more flavorful so couldn't give it a higher rating as is.

Good, but agree it needs tweaking...ginger, garlic, extra spice. I grilled my chicken and then added it. Also added broccoli, snow peas, carrots, mushrooms, onions, red bell peppers.

The sauce this makes is excellent!. The combo of sesame and peanut oil and the spicy peppers are key to right flavor balance. I used jalapenos instead of serrano chiles because that was all I had and it worked out very well. The only reason I did't give this 4 forks is because, as other reviewers noted, it's much improved by adding garlic, ginger and more veggies. I added mushrooms, red bell peppers, broccoli and carrots but I think any combo of veggies would work.

I added sambal oelek (a chili garlic paste) to the onion mixture before I added my greens and let me tell you it was AMAZING! I brought it to work (with a little bag of crushed peanuts, I don't like them heated) for lunch and everyone raved about how wonderful it smelled! I was looking for a healthy dish and this paired with brown rice and less peanut oil really hit the spot for me!

Very good! May use extra stir fry veggies, such as, celery, onions, broccoli. I substituted jalapenos! It was great!

Like most people, I'm giving this recipe three stars because it's such an outstanding base from which to build, not because it works well on its own. My mods: I doubled both sauces, leaving the sugar unchanged. I amped them up with garlic, ginger and sriracha and added some cornstarch to the meat sauce to add that gloss to the chicken that makes stir-fry so pretty. I added a third serrano, leaving the seeds in two of them for the heat. I also added some red pepper, in my case a cayenne, but it doesn't matter what kind, it went in for color. Next time, I'll add some crunchy veggies.

Yes, this recipe needs ginger and garlic. Sugar can be omitted. I say, use the full ten cups of greens! Live it up!

i made it with garlic added to the ingredients. I barely taste the serrano, though i like the flavor of them. I was originally thinking red pepper flakes would work because i add them to sauteed kale all the time.Barely makes 4 servings with the rice(or whatever you choose to serve it with). The green onions and peanuts really make the flavors pop too.

Don't throw away the thick stalks of the greens as suggested. Do what the Chinese do ... slice the thick stalks finely and throw them in. Nothing wasted and good extra flavour too.

Rating: 2
I made this according to the recipe and agree with other reviewers that it is just okay as written. It needs more flavor, maybe some more green onions and leave in some seeds from the chilis for extra heat. I will try it agains with some tweaks.

Rating: 3
Used mix of collard greens, kale, turnip, and mustard greens. Added about three tablespoons more of the sauce mix. I followed previous advice and added garlic and chicken broth to the greens. Tuned out really good. Very light dish. Next time I will add bok choy ( as suggested) and possibly carrots.

Rating: 3
I used half of the greens (5 C) and used dino and curly leaf kale. I think it needs at least 7 C to balance out the chicken. I used thighs instead of breast meat. I used green chilis instead of serranos (since I live in the Southwest). It is an easy dish to make and I have recommended it in my blog jillcsameals.blogspot.com

Rating: 2
This was okay. It's a good jumping-off point, as other reviewers have said, but without the garlic and the ginger it's mostly just salty. I put in some Thai chiles that made a couple eyes pop out of heads, but otherwise this was not that memorable.

Rating: 4
I pretty much followed this recipe as is. I used bok choy and chili pepper flakes (because that's what I had on hand). I didn't bother with the peanuts and in spite of that, I thought it was excellent. So easy and very tasty. I'll be making this again for sure.

I liked this a lot. One of my first times using a wok. Used broccoli rabe.

Nice dish but definitely agree that it needed more marinade and more heat.

Rating: 2
With so many changes, are we even reviewing this recipe any more? Anyway - yes to garlic and ginger, no to the sugar. I used mizuna for the greens, and they were nice and bitter. Other than that, this is a pretty standard stir-fry recipe.

Great for a basic recipe to build on....very versatile! I used steamed broccoli, carrots diced, green onion, mushrooms, sliced red & orange bell pepper. marinated par cooked chicken breasts (night before on BBQ) -only used one breast sliced. ADded 2 cups spinach at end of stir fry of veggies. Added sirachi sauce for spice. NOT too spicy...great flavor. Would try garlic/ginger next time. Great late night meal...light fare and really healthy!

With some doctoring, this recipe came out really well! I followed advice and added garlic, ginger, and thinly sliced red pepper. I doubled the marinade, too, and added cornstarch to it for thickening. I used two Thai chilis - I wanted more heat but husband liked it because you could taste the variou flavors.

Rating: 0
It came out well, I did take the advice and add garlic, ginger, chicken broth and cornstarch/water to thicken it. I also doubled the sauce recipe. I wasn't sure what serrano chiles were so I used chiles I got from a farm co-op, weren't quite spicy enough. I've seen other stir fry recipes that just use red pepper flakes. Will make again, spicing it up a bit more. I also through in firm tofu for the vegetarian in the house - I marinated it first in the sauce and ending up liking it more than the chicken!

I have to agree with lilylady. This is okay, but not great. I made the recipe as written and added the garlic that other reviewers suggested. It was a little dry. I used kale and that takes a long time to get tender. Maybe some chicken broth mixed with a little cornstarch at the end would've made it a little saucier?

Rating: 2
This is OK. Used other reviewers' suggestions--garlic, ginger. Even added a splash of vinegar at the end. The dish was still just OK.

Rating: 4
This was a really tasty recipe. I followed some of the other reviewers advice and added 2 cloves of garlic and about 1 inch piece of fresh ginger finely chopped. I believe this made the dish much more flavorful than it would have been without. I also used bok choy, snap peas, and sweet baby broccoli which I would recommend maybe steaming for a couple of minutes first before adding it to the pan with the other veggies, otherwise it maybe a bit to tough to eat. Severed with brown rice...delicious, healthy and filling, what more could you ask for.

This will go into my Chinese go-to recipe collection. It was delicious, healthy and I highly recommend. I used broccoli rabe to great effect and I'm sure that another sturdy green such as Kale would be equally good. I can't imagine spinach as that would be way too "wimpy" with this hearty dish. I did reduce the sesame oil by 1 tsp, and instead of peanut oil I used canola and reduced it by 1 T. to make this a healthier dish.

This wasn't as delicious as I had hoped. I used kale and spinach greens, and no where near 10 cups packed. The flavor was ok, nothing special. I followed the recipe and was not impressed.

Relatively quick...I like the heat so I left the seeds. Great weeknight dish.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 2 cloves of garlic and some fresh slivered ginger. I used a bag of saute mix greens from my CSA farm and also added some baby broccoli including the leaves because I didn't have quite enough greens. I used 1 serrano chili, seeds and all. Depends on how spicy you like your food. I served the dish over brown Jasmine rice.

Rating: 3
Quick, easy and delicious! I used thin slices of broccoli, and it was super! I also added garlic and ginger to the green onions as other reviewers suggested, and I threw in some slices of red pepper. Will definetely use this recipe again, a great dinner served with brown rice.

This dish was delicious. My family (kids included)absolutely loved it. I followed some of the other suggestions adding ginger, garlic, and serving brown rice. I also added thinly sliced red bell pepper to add color, juice of one lime, sriracha hot chili sauce, and used 2 whole serano chilis chopped. Just the right amount of hot factor. I will definitely keep this in my recipe box.

Disappointing, like so many psuedo- Asian dishes. Used the kale, added garlic and ginger to the aromatics, but it just tasted muddy. Shoulda' just eaten the dry roasted peanuts without the bother of making the recipe...

This was really good! The recipe called for entirely too much oil though. I followed the recipe, but next time will add garlic and ginger too.

I took advice from other reviewers and added 2 large minced garlic cloves and a 1-inch piece of fresh ginger, minced, to the scallion/serranos. I also sauteed those in 1 TB peanut oil instead of 2 to cut down a tad on the fat. I also used a big bunch of kale and a 10 oz. bag of baby spinach. I don't think one or the other would be nearly enough. I made brown rice on the side and mixed into the chicken for the last minute for easy serving. The green onions and chopped peanuts on top are a must. My husband loved it and it will definitely make it into the weekly rotation.

Rating: 3
A nice bit of exotic for a quick and healthy weeknight meal. I used dinosaur kale for the greens and was quite generous with the peanuts. I agree with other reviewers - one serrano didn't lend enough heat. Next time I will add another, or ginger and garlic for more flavor as others have suggested. Served this with the panko and sesame crusted asparagus from this site.

First thank you to the reviewers who suggested the brown rice, garlic and ginger additions. Yum. This was so fast, easy and healthful I will make it again. I used mustard greens and a regular onion because that is what I had. I also did not remove the chicken to do the greens I just shoved it all in the wok. I am sure it did not suffer. I also used non salted peanuts... lots of them. They make the dish. Also, I can't see using spinach. IMO it would be too soft and does not have the requisite zip. You need something with some substance and kick!

Loved this. I added garlic because I never cook anything of this nature without lots of garlic. Used a mix of four types of greens because I happened to have them. But the one serrano chile didn't make it hot -- need to add more, definitely, for next time.

Rating: 3
This was good and healthy. I added ginger and garlic, but still felt it needed something more--perhaps more spice next time. Also, used a bag of baby spinach, but could have used a 2nd bag.

This was a really great recipe for a quick and easy healthy meal! I added some dried cranberries in just for some more flavor since I didn't have peanuts and that was pretty good but then I tried to add in what I thought were pine nuts which were actually some kind of bean, which was gross but i think real pine nuts would also be good in this.

Rating: 3
This was tasty and healthy, but seemed to be missing something. I followed previous reviewers advice and added extra chiles, however next time garlic and/or ginger would not go astray. I used kale rabe and spinach for greens. Tofu and cashews would also be delicious in this recipe. I think next time I will try it with hot chile sesame oil instead of plain. It went well with brown rice.

Rating: 3
Tasty and quick, as the first reviewer said. I couldnt get fresh kale/spinach etc, so instead used dark lettuce... This worked, but I think with spinach (fresh or frozen) it would have been better... Also the addition of garlic might add something, give a more complex taste...

This was tasty and quick. healthy as well. I didnt use as much greens so will add more next time. I also ommitted the peanuts bc I don;t like peanuts in stir fry.

This was very good. I added garlic and ginger, because I am addicted to them. Also added extra chiles as suggested. The greens are so quick to cook that I don't take the chicken out. It's a really quick yummy week-night dinner.

I loved this recipe! I forgot to buy the serrano chilis, so I just used jalepenos. It was still delicious.

This was good. I used two whole serranos and it wasn't overly spicy. It might have been better with ginger.
