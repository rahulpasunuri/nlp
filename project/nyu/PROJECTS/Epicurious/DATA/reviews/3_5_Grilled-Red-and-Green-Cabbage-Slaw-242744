Add shredded carrot for more color, and add a bulb of fennel which compliments the tarragon nicely.

Great tasting slaw! Believe the reviews! I had green cabbage & green onions & tarragon vinegar, & gave it a whirl (without red cabbage or fresh tarragon).It was really tasty, & sweetie liked it a lot too! Grilling (we used charcoal) really does subtly change the taste. Served it with jerk chicken & thin-cut pork chops, & beans. My sweetie & I were both happy campers.

truly a game-changing coleslaw-- somehow it became the star of my friends' grill party. an exceptional way to make the humble cabbage shine~

Excellent dish- did not have red cabbage, so I used all green. Looked and tasted yummy. Chop finely since it's still very crisp, similar to raw cabbage.

I couldn't find red cabbage, so I used radicchio instead. It worked well.

totally amazing - no prob if you don't have green cabbage - actually like it better with just the brilliant color of the red. Also doesn't matter if you have a substitute vinegar (doesn't need tarragon) MAKE THIS!

This was remarkably good. I used cider vinegar instead of taragon, and I only had red cabbage. My husband loved it!

this was awesome! I have non-coleslaw eaters begging for more. I also used only green cabbage, since I have an abundance, and Splenda instead of sugar for a diabetic, and it was still great.

This dish was awesome. Everyone at the table said it was delicious. I took the suggestions of some reviewers and cut the sugar by half and added another tbsp of mustard. Really good and different and will definitely make this again.

really different and tasty. perfect for summer evenings when you're in the mood for slaw but not for the thickness of typical coleslaw dressing. we made this several times last summer... one of the many reasons to be excited about grill season!

I just made this, and I am so impressed with how easy and tasty this is! I did make a few substitutions to use ingredients that I already had on hand. I used apple cider vinegar instead of tarragon vinegar. Used 1 T. spicy brown mustard, and 1T coarse dijon. Instead of using vegetable oil I used 1/2 C. mayo. And used a red onion instead of green onions, which I cut in half and grilled as well. I also added red and orange bell pepper--un grilled for a different textural crunch. And Still though it ventures off from the original, I LOVE IT! And I love recipes that really give you a new perspective on a common food. I will make this over and over with so many different variations.

This was kind of too sweet and oily, I made it because I like tarragon and cabbage but all I tasted was sugar.

I made this slaw two weeks in a row - it is perfect with a BBQ. I did add more mustard, decreased the sweetener (I use splenda) and opted for cider vinegar and olive oil. The tarragon and mustard take the flavor to a whole new cole slaw world!

I made it for a group of people and agree with several posted comments. What is suppose to serve 6 could easily serve 12. I would cut the cabbage in smaller pieces prior to grilling to get a better 'grilling' flavor. I think it could use some kick. When I had some leftovers, I added some red bell pepper flakes which added some additional flavor.

I used cider vinegar and olive oil instead, then added just a touch of sesame oil and reduced the sugar and oil by half. It was even better the second day.

Lose the tarragon. I sub'd cider vinegar and fresh thyme. It goes well with anything grilled.

Served this to family and some neighbors for a 4th of July dinner and it was a big hit. Even with several people taking seconds of this dish I still had plenty of leftovers. It might say "serves 6" but I think that it is closer to say that it could easily serve 8-10. If you are looking to make this for a smaller get together, consider using a half a red and half a green cabbage. Next time I make this I'll try and make the vinaigrette up a day or so before just to see if that will help boost the flavor a bit more. The Tarragon flavor was fine, but I still felt like I should have tossed one other sort of spice into the mix.

Very yummy, next time I'll grill the cabbage in smaller bits for more grill-y flavour.

We thought it was fabulous, even good the next day!

Wait a minute....you gotta wonder about a recipe that thinks 6 people are going to eat more than 3 pounds of cabbage at a meal! Might those quantities be wrong??
