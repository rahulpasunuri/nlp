Have made this dish numerous times...excellent fall/winter dish, even for company. I replaced the gorganzola polenta with gorganzola mashed yukon potatoes and it works much better in my opinion.

The Gremolata definitely added a fresh "zestiness" to the braised short ribs. I've since used it on other meats I've braised and found the mized-herb Gremolata to be very versatile addition to my cooking repertoire.

The cabernet braised short ribs will definately not be the same without this!
