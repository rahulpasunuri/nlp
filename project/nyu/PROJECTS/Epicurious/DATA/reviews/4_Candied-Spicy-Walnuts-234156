Agreed, very addictive, and not hard at all. I didn't even bother with the oil step; just toasted some walnuts in a pan, then melted some light brown sugar in a little water with the walnuts and sprinkled with cayenne and salt. Swirl and toss the pan until the sugar sets on the nuts, voila! They do work a treat on the Burricotti recipe that brought me to this one.

Addictive. And easy to make!

I may have heated the oil too much, but I wouldn't leave the walnuts in there too long. Just drop them in, watch for about 10 seconds and take them out as soon as you can. Aside from that, great recipe and an excellent study snack!

I'm with "A Cook" -- not that this is a bad recipe, but how are these recipes ending up here???

Help! I can't stop eating these. I'm suppose to be taking them to a party but am having second thoughts. I have a can of peanuts in the pantry that I could take. I want these candied walnuts ALL to myself. Easy to make......the production can get a bit messy but it's totally worth it. We even ate the sugar that we drained from the nuts....it's like praline candy.......
