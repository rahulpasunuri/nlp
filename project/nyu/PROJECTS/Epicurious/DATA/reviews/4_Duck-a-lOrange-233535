I served this for Christmas and everyone loved it. It was perfect. I served it with Wild Rice with Butternut Squash, Leeks, and Corn, and with Green Beans with Toasted Walnuts, and Dried-Cherry Vinegrette. Everything complemented each other perfectly. This is a slightly complicated dish but worth the effort for a special occasion. My guests were talking about this dinner for weeks afterwards.

I'm not going to be so critical, knowing that this recipe was written in the 40's. But oh, what a time I had getting this together. If I ever do this again, I hope I remember to rewrite the instructions in the sequence in which they're intended to be done. The recipe is otherwise quite readable and the duck ultimately came out beautifully. ~M

I made the duck as per the recipe. the bird cooked just fine at one hour at 350 degrees (after the initial 1/2 hour at 475). the only problem I had was with the sauce. I added the juice and vinegar to the caramel and it turned to candy including crystallizing on the fork. not sure how that can be prevented but I tried to dissolve as much of the candy as possible in the liquid in the pan. the duck was delicious.

I cooked the duck according to the 5 hour slow cooked recipe. But I made the orange sauce described in this article. It was great - and easier than it sounds. I warmed the orange juice before adding it to the sugar so there was not as much reaction. Also - taste carefully before, mine was a bit too sweet, probably because the fresh juice was a bit watery. I added more vinegar and zest. This could be very interesting with some chili pepper thrown in. Also, as another reviewer noted - don't throw out the roasted veggies. They are fantastic.

Delicious. I used half the sugar in the sauce and a semi-dry wine in the stock. I would also suggest NOT throwing out the carrots and celery as they are fantastic.

This was a great recipe. Fun to make and soooo yummy. I'll be making it again! I didn't roast the whole duck however just the legs I pan seared them first and followed the recipe from there. Grrrrrreat!

I prepared this recipe for 2 chefs and a woman who has studied food preparation in Italy. It was wonderful! And it was even more wonderful cold when I was putting away all of the left-overs.

This was the first time I've ever roasted a whole duck and it turned out fantastic! I researched several sources including one of Julia Child's books and decided that 475 was too high to start the bird. I settled on 350 per Julia and it took exactly 1 hour and 5 minutes to cook through and be properly browned. I also pricked the skin all over the back and in the thigh areas (but not deeply to the meat) and it let a bunch of the fat out to flavor the sauce. The gravy was superb and the whole family loved it. The only other advice I'll leave you with is to make sure you get 1 duck per 2-3 people. There isn't as much meat on a duck as there is on a chicken. Be prepared.

I used this recipe the first time I made duck .... my fiance told me it was the BEST duck he'd ever had (he's 54 years). I did substitute peaches (sugarless Orchard Harvest - in a glass jar in produce section) for the inside and used some of the peach juice for the sauce ... excellent recipe and easy to make.

To cook a whole duck, you must cut it into parts and cook at different times and temperatures. I have attempted whole ducks many times through Epicurious and it wasn't until I became a Cooks Illustrated devotee that I finally got the 411 on steaming the bird first and then separating parts. That being said, I am still a fan of this site, although they haven't nailed the whole duck cooking experience.

Delicious - both duck and sauce were tasty. The sauce had a depth of flavour that seemed beyond its cooking time. No complaints. A 5.2lb turkey was enough for a meal for two with ample leftover for some tasty wraps tomorrow. Would make this again - possibly with the addition of a couple of cloves to the sauce.

The sauce was great! I used it with duck breast which was unfortunately slightly overcooked (first time I ever tried making duck), but the sauce made up for it. It was a big hit and I will definitely make this again.

Good but not 100% great, heres why: The finished result was a delicous breast but the wings and legs were practicaly inedible, and this was not due to any under or overcooking on my part. The meat in the breast was suculent, tender and had a nice flavor on its own and the sauce gave it an even better flavor. The drumsticks and wings on the other hand were inedible and like hard rubber. My husband who is usually very fond of drumsticks was disappinted. Another detracting thing about this recipe was the amount of meat we got off the bird.I used an even bigger bird than the recipe suggested-it suggested a 5-6 lb. duck. I used an 8 lb. duck and I couldn't believe the small amount of meat that was etable. The breast meat only fed the two of us. Thankfully I din't serve this to guests because one bird would have starved more than two people. We like having leftovers and no such luck with this meal. I suspect a lot of the initial weight of the duck was fat and it simply cooked away and resulted in a small amount of meat. I probably won't make this again due to what I just mentioned along with the fact that it is tedious to make the syrup that goes in the sauce. It seems like too much work for such little result. If I make anything like this again It will be with breasts only if I can find them, and not a whole bird.

I made just the orange sauce and used another recipe for the duck. The sauce was excellent. It was a nice complex of sweet & savory. I made a few adjustments to the recipe: I made the sauce a day ahead. I browned the neck and tail in olive oil before adding water, vegetables, one bay leaf, three cloves of roasted garlic, and one tablespoon of soy sauce. This reduced into a rich and flavorful stock. The only problem I had was when I added the orange juice & vinegar to the carmelized sugar, the sugar syrup instantly seized like hard candy, and took a long time to melt again.

Superb. Best duck we've ever had. One little variation: I subsituted the white wing vinegar for dry white wine and the outcome was still fantastic. Must cook it again on special occasion.

It is an exceptional recipe. It was the best duck we ever enjoyed. Few suggestions. We like our duck well cooked so I cooked it another 15 minutes to get F 175 temp. I did not add flour to the gravy and it was outstanding. Definitely a repeat for very special occasions.

This is a wonderful recipe. I have made it twice, turned out perfect. I have also used the recipe just for the sauce and put it on roasted chicken. Wow.

I made this recipe exactly as written and was pretty unimpressed with the results. After reading all the reviews below, I thought we were in for something spectacular, but it was merely OK. My strongest impression was of orange-flavored gravy on decently cooked duck. My husband liked it more than I did but neither of us thought it was worth making again.

Thyme, garlic, carrot, celery and onion, simple and awesome. One extra step I did was to add orange zest into the coriander, cumin, salt and pepper mixture so that the duck would smell more 'orangey' :)

Totally delicious! I recommend cooking the duck a little longer, but the sauce is out of this world!!..do not plan to cook anything else last minute...the sauce takes alot of concentration...I recommend roasted courgettes, squash, asparagus, broccolli and onion in herbs and virgin olive oil ( put into the oven to cook) with dauphinoise potatoes...( simply stated mash piped into swirls and toasted in the oven!)...again, this sauce is excellent!! Impress anyone..and enjoy..

I made this recipe instead of turkey one Thanksgiving and it was such a hit, it's become a tradition. I have to admit, though, that I've stopped making the orange sauce. It's pretty time-consuming and messy to prepare, and the general consensus has been that it overpowers the flavor of the duck. The oranges stuffed inside give the meat a nice flavor and that hint of fruit seems to be enough.

We made this for New Year's Day supper. It was my first time making duck and it was perfect. A truly exceptional recipe that I'll definitely use again!

WSe used this recipe for our Christmas dinner, substituting Clementines for juice oranges, and doing two ducks at the same time. It came out great and we will absolutely make it again.

Wow! I thought I was taking a risk, having only previously had Duck A L'orange on a shabby cruise ship. I had no idea how incredible orange sauce could be. When my guests found out what was for dinner, they too had some apprehension. Instead, we were all amazed. This updated recipe is a home run. Not really that complicated, and will certainly be easier the second time around - and there will be a second time. Don't be intimidated.

OK, so if you don't use the gizzards and things to make your own stock, this is a not terribly time consuming, good roasting recipe. I made as is for our 1 month wedding anniversary, and hubby is still doing the dishes! But really really yummy. The sauce is so good!

Outstanding, really restaurant quality. We did cut the amounts of cumin and coriander in half because we think of them as strong flavors. The finished flavors were subtle, but not bland. In hindsight, we might have avoided having to broil the dark to achieve crispness if we'd not reduced the initial oven high temp. right away but had let it remain that high for 15 minutes or so. Sauce was excellent, and we added 2 T of Grand Marnier to enhance it.

This was really fabulous. It was more time consuming that I expected, but maybe that is because it is Christmas Day and time just seems to be a bit more precious! Thanksfully, I had read other recipes and had some idea how to prep the Duck - ie. where to cut the fat, etc. The flavors were really wonderful, but there was really no juice left, only fat, so I didn't bother even trying to strain the drippings. I just used Chicken broth with the sauce. Definately worth trying, especially if you are looking for something unique!
