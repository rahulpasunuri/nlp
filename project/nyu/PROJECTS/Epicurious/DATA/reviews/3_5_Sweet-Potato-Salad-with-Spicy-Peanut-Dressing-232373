I made this exactly as written and thought it tasted horrible. Onion taste overwhelmed everything else. Certainly not enough peanut butter. Combination of textures was good, but this recipe needs a LOT of tweaking to be acceptable.

Awesome!!! I added a bit more of the chili-garlic sauce but otherwise made as written. This is so flavorful you have to take care in the main dish you serve with it. A real winner

Exceptional! Yes, I used more ginger, and more peanut butter, and definitely more chili-garlic sauce... and it is SO GOOD! Everyone loved it. It is good 3 days later. Absolutely... do try this. This should be on a menu in a restaurant!

Great twist on your normal potato salad. I upped the spice adding more chili sauce,addded a bit more peanut butter and mayo too (the dressing was so good you want plenty of it to cover the salad) - all the flavors really gave it a nice asian flare!

Sadly this was a total disaster. Living in Africa it completely slipped my mind that a 'sweet potato' is SO different from that of North America. Along with that the vinegar was so painfully over powering everyone eating it was puckering the whole way through. Would recommend reducing the quantity of vinegar and doubling the peanut butter as well as the chilli-garlic sauce.

tripled the peanut butter, doubled the sauce, added kale. wonderful!

I liked this recipe a lot and have made it a few times. Most people have enjoyed it, but those who do not like sweet potatoes, of course, do not. I am not sure what chili-garlic sauce is, and have not been able to find that in my Whole Foods, but it is great without it, although perhaps less spicy. Don't be afraid of the mayonnaise, this dish is not too mayonnaise-y at all. Works with out with the snap peas and peanuts.

I made this twice. The first time it was appealing but I felt it was too salty and the soy sauce overwhelmed the flavor of the potato and peanut sauce. The second time I made it with 1 Tbs of lite soy sauce and my guests really enjoyed it. I served it with pork skewers with molasses barbecue sauce (Epicurious recipe).

Delicious made according to recipe. Very healthy. Even my 2 1/2 year old ate the potatoes. I will definetly make again for the next summer picnic!

Excellent salad that everyone seems to like. Combines easy to obtain ingredients in a new and interesting way. I substitute fresh red pepper strips for the peas and then top with chopped cilantro & peanuts.

DD from San Francisco I made this as a side salad and we LOVED it! I served it with Spicy Lamb Chops (although I made this using the rub on a Butterflied Leg of Lamb). It's easy and flavors just jump out at you. All asked me to keep it in my collection.

The dressing was simply wonderful, I'm going to try pairing it with other things next time, e.g. a sobal noodle salad?

This is a wonderful salad. I'm always looking for something a little different. Wonderful color. Don't overcook the sweet potatoes-you want done but firm to hold together. You have to try this to believe how good it is!

A favorite recipe since we saw it in summer of 2005. All of our friends ask for it and want the recipe! Sauce is great; snap peas and onions are great compliments to the sweet potatoes. We serve it with picnic fare and it's a huge hit! Always a safe bet to take to another's house when they ask you to bring a dish. Dresses up an otherwise regular meal. Very tasty and glad to be making it again this week! Delicious!

I love this type of spicy peanut dressing on chicken satay dishes - - but wasn't crazy about it combined with sweet potatoes. It was a bit overpowering for this side dish. Also wasn't crazy about the snap peas addition - not a palate pleaser.

This is one of my favorite summer side dishes - I think it's great with anything grilled! I follow the recipe, no additions, deletions or changes, and it's delicious. Even my non-sweet potato eating husband likes it!

Followed the recipe exactly with the execption of excluding the ginger (not on purpose, I just couldn't find it when I got started cooking.) I thought the dressing was good, but it did not seem to get along with the sweet potatoes. Seems like the sauce would be better on pasta or rice or something. No one much cared for it except for a friend's 3 year old son, oddly enough. Won't make it again.

What a fun salad for a buffet - served it with grilled Cornish Game Hens basted with a spicy, Asian flavored sticky, goopy sauce. Very good!

I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. The sugar snap peas add a delightful crunch. Making this salad ahead of time lets the flavors meld even more.

I made this as part of a vietnamese dinner with chicken and beef satays and it was a huge hit at my dinner party. Do not leave out the mayo!

Very, very tasty. I served this on a hot night with grilled hotdogs (not very gourmet but it was so very hot). That said, the burner was only on long enough to bring a bit of water to a boil and then an additional 5 minutes (do not over cook your sweet potatoes). I spaced that I had run out of sesame oil but it really wasn't missed. When I remake it, I will only add just a touch to reduce fat but add the flavor of toasted sesame. I may have added a bit more peanut butter and it was plenty spicy as written when I halved the recipe. Very tasty, quick and filling side.

You can find Chili-Garlic sauce on the Asian foods aisle of most decent grocery stores. It usually comes in a large plastic squeeze bottle with a triangle tip.

This is a new favorite. I doubled the chili-garlic sauce and doubled the snap peas. Love the contrast between the potato and snap pea and peanut textures. Our leftovers were great, just added more fresh chopped peanuts each time. Yes, don't overcook the potatoes....I was a skeptic about this cooking method, but it was easy and came out perfect at 5 minutes! I am going to convert my sister to a sweet-potato-lover with this recipe!

I HAVE BEEN MAKING THIS SINCE THE DAY I GOT THAT MAGAZINE AND TAKEN IT TO A NUMBER OF BBQS & IT HAS BEEN A BIG HIT EACH TIME, IT IS A NICE CHANGE FROM THE ORDINARY FOR ALL AGES. I ADDED CHOPPED CILANTRO ONE TIME AND ANOTHER I USED THAI BASIL AS A GARNISH AND SURROUNED THE BOWL WITH LIME WEDGES. CONTROL THE HEAT BY EXPERIMENTING WITH AMOUNTS OF CHILI SAUCE AND PEANUTBUTTER. I ADD MORE OF BOTH ALONG WITH SOME MIRIN WINE. IT IS TRULY A GREAT 3O MINUTE RECIPE, JUST DON'T OVERCOOK THE POTATOES. ENJOY1

Three of my very favorite things! Sweet potatoes + snap peas + peanut sauce should = WONDERFUL! Except it just...didn't. The snap peas and the sweet pots made for a weird texture combo, and the peanut dressing was very rich, as are sweet potatoes...too much. I like the dressing and will use it for other things, but I won't put it anywhere near a potato.

This is a great salad; didn't miss the mayo and added a little extra peanut butter to the dressing. Day after leftovers are just as good. The garlic-chili sambal is a key ingredient.

I was skepticle about making this with some of the previous reveiws, but I was throwing a big BBQ for a friend who doesn't eat white potatos, so I figured I'd try it. I made it as it called for, except that I used light mayo, and threw the dressing into the blender. WOW! It was AWESOME. I doubled it, and didn't think I'd have enough of it the way people were eating it, and asking for the recipe. It all went, with no leftovers, so I can't comment on 'next day' tastes. I've shared the recipe with all of my friends, and can't wait to make it again (so I can eat more of it!).

I really liked the dressing.But I highly recommend using a hand blender or regular blender to combine ingrediants.Peanut butter doesnt "whisk" so well.I dont know what all the fuss was about over the small amount of mayo.People relax!If they called it aoli would you feel better?I even liked this salad when the sweet potatos were still slightly warm.This is also better the day made.I think the dressing alone could be used in lots of other ways.

Delicious summer salad; easy to prepare and an interesting blend of flavors. It got rave reviews from my dinner guests when paired with barbequed ribs.

I was apprehensive about taking this dish to a church potluck after seeing such a negative review. My first reaction was "it's not awful." However, the second day it was WONDERFUL and I would definitely make it again. I steamed the sugar snap peas for two minutes in the microwave and I will be sure to make the dish a day ahead.

While this sounded interesting,I didn't care for as much as other reviewers. The flavors were okay, but the mayonaise produced a weird-looking coating on the potatoes. Also, felt the very crunchy contrast of the snap peas against the potatoes didn't work.

I liked the dressing a lot. It seemed to make quite a bit of it, though so I added some leftover whole wheat pasta. This is a really tasty salad.

Our leftovers were as delicious when freshly made. The taste was like a sweet & sour potatoe salad with the sweetness toned down by the chili/garlic. It sure beats serving sweet potatoes with melted marshmallows!

We loved this recipe, a great new and unusual way to use sweet potatoes.I did however omit the mayonaise,didn't seem like it belonged with all the oriental inegredients. Like suggested by another cook, I added the snap peas & green onions just before serving, so they stay crisp & nice color. It is pretty spicy, if you don't like real spicy, might cut the chili-garlic sauce to 1 tsp.

After searching all the supermarkets here for sweet potatoes (they don't grow them in France - they are usually imported from Israel) without any success (must be out of season...) I finally decided to substitute them for rice, especially since I had already bought all the other ingredients. So the Sweet-Potato Salad turned into a Rice Salad and it was DELICIOUS!!! In fact, I think it can be tried with pasta as well and goes perfectly with pork chops, ribs, or even as a vegetarian meal itself. Next time when I find sweet potatoes in the vegetable section I will give it a go as the real thing!

To cook from New York: When I first saw this recipe I also thought the mayo was a very odd/strange addition and almost omitted it. However, after making, I think the mayo plays an important role in this dressing. It acts like a binding agent for the other ingredients and helps to suspend the bits of ginger and garlic within the dressing. It really doesn't contribute any appreciable taste nor does it interfere with or enhance the flavour of the other ingredients. At least, that was my take on it.

I am intriqued by this recipe but can't rate it since I haven't tried it - yet. But I'm curious if anyone has made it without the mayonaise or if they've used a substitution for it. It's the one ingredient here that seems not to go with the rest. As I love Asian flavors, I do intend to try it.

Loved this salad - a great summery way to serve yams! Excellent blend of sweet, tart and spicy flavours with good contrast in colour and texture. Did make a few minor changes: Not a fan of raw ginger in salads so simmered the dressing ingredients (minus the mayo) for 2 minutes, cooled to room temp, then whisked in the mayo and fine zest from one lime; tossed the dressing with only the yams and chilled for 2 hours; mixed in the sugar snaps/green onions just prior to serving to maintain their colour and crunch/crispness. If you enjoy yams and Asian flavours, then this is the salad for you!

Delicous new twist to Sweet potatos. I do not care for them when served traditionaly for thanksgiving. After having had this dish we will be making it again. It was a excellent clash of peanuts, with a slight spicyness, and sweetness of the sweet potatoes and brown sugar. Give it a try!
