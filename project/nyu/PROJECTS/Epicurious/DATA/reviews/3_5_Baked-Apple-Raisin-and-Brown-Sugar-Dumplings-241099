Very easy, and tastes delish! I made extra filling for mine because there was too little!

So yummy! I made these for the 2nd time last night.. I wasn't able to find Golden Delicious apples this time around and had to use Fuji.. I ended up doubling the time in the microwave and the apples still came out a bit too hard. Regardless, these are quite a treat- worthy of a special occasion. Make sure you leave a little extra time because the apple coring is a bit tedious but very well worth it. I chopped up some toasted pecans for the filling and topping and it was wonderful!

I thought Epicurious was all about good food, not opening a packet of cookie dough!

Very good, but not as easy as it appears. The dough kept peeling itself off the apple, so it definitely did not look like the picture, but was still delicious! Next time I will wrap the apple in my own pastry dough. Some things I did differently.. -I baked the apples 30 minutes as another reviewer suggested. -I'm not to crazy about raisins, so I made a caramel pecan sauce and filled the apples with that. I also put some extra sauce on the side. It was sooo good, can't wait until I make it again!

I loved this recipe!! Everyone loved the way they turned out. I bought a mellon baller but I really don't think its meant for coring apples at all, I ended up just using a knife to core the apples. It also took a bit longer than I planned so next time I will set aside more time for all the prep.

Made these last night and were delicious. Had a tough time assembling the without the bottoms ripping. Apples could have been a bit softer.

I made these for a fall dessert after a pork roast-and they were a big hit! Doubled the recipe using Rome apples, added some allspice to the cinnamon sugar, used three types of raisins and added walnuts to the mix. Also served with vanilla honey ice cream instead of whipped cream. They were simple to make, beautiful, and scrumptious!!

I was so proud of myself after making this! Everyone was impressed, and it was so easy! I'm not a fan of raisins so I just used filled the apples with the sugar/cinnamon sauce and it was still yummy. I as well did not have a "melon ball thing" so I cut the top off the apple and dug the seeds out with a spoon.

This recipe turned out even better than I imagined. I was alittle worried about how the raisins would taste with the apples. the answer... perfect! I didn't have a melon baller so I cut the apple into 1/4 pieces to cut out the core, the "tried" to reform the aple in the dumpling. It didn't quite workout that way, but no one else noticed. many people cut theirs in half thinking that they wouldn't finish it all, only to come back later to finish it off.

I doubled the recipe and oh my gosh! INCREDIBLE!! This is one I will make over and over again. Yes, the dish was great, I added peaches to a few of the apples. but...the peaches made it something very orginial and delicate tasting. I'll try other fruit in the future as well but this is definitely something I'll do again and again. I had two left over and refrigerated them, the next day, after warming them in the microwave, they were twice as delicious. Mmmmmmmm

These were really good! I had to cook the apples a little longer in micro. Also - because I started to prep these so late, we decided to save them for breakfast. I took them out of the oven and refridgerated them overnight, then reheated them in the oven again. They were amazing with hot milt poured over.

Baking the apples for 30 minutes in tin foil with a splash of water and vanilla, instead of microwave, works perfectly. This recipe is excellent.

taste is wonderful. I had to ad lib though on the raisins and sugar mixture because I didn't have nearly enough to overfill four apples.

Does anyone have a suggestion for preparing the apples without using a microwave? Steaming them perhaps?

Tasty, elegant and easy desert. Ensure you include the whipped cream as it compliments the apples nicely.

The cinnamon whipped cream was a great touch to it.
