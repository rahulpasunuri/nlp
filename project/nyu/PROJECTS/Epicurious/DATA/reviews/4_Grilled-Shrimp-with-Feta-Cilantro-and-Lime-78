This was a perfect summer recipe - the lime and cilantro were refreshing, and the feta sauce was a big hit, even with the non-feta fans in my family.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic. We followed it to a tee, but we may have used a bit less olive oil for the marinade. We ended up without as much liquid as we would have liked, but the onion and feta were absolutely phenomenal. We both love to cook and said this is one of our favorites ever!

Great - if you like cilantro. If you don't, try it with fresh parsley or mint.

Rating: 4
this sounded so interesting i had to try it. made it with 1.5 lbs of large shrimp so i made 1.5 X the marinade which wasn't needed. there is plenty of marinade left to boil after the shrimp make it to the grill. and i agree with others that the onions make the dish. i served the sauce on the side but next time will mix it with the shrimp as directed. very yummy and would be good with scallops or chicken too.

Loved this dish! The onions coarsely chopped mixed with the marinade really makes this. Never put the cheese in and I was going to use a goat cheese but it just didn't seem to need it.Simple and fresh is what I like. Will make again real soon.

Grilled red pepper along with the onion..delicious. That with the feta and the angel hair pasta was great, even my teenagers liked it. Shrimp needed a little more flavor. Will add more cilantro, garlic and maybe some smoked paprika next time

This is so good. We made salmon along with the shrimp and just mixed an additional portion of the marinade for the salmon. We heated both portions of the marinade at the same time! Very good!!!

Wowwee! These were great! I made a very large quantity for a large party and they were the first thing to go. The shrimp were amazing plump, and looked so delicious that I decided to forgo the feta sauce all together- which my husband, a hater of feta, deemed a good call. Because I increased the number of shrimp so drastically ( to about 4 dozen), I wanted to let them marinate for longer without them starting to cure, so I reduced the lime juice and instead squeezed some fresh juice over them once cooked. Amazing - Can't wait to make them again!

Sorry...meant to say that I doubled the GARLIC - not the shrimp!

So delicious! Doubled the shrimp and tossed the onion/marinade/cheese mixture with angel hair pasta then placed the skewered, grilled shrimp over the bed of noodles. Divine! Husband said it was "better than restaurant quality!" Will make for company soon.

This dish is fabulous. I like to grill orange and yellow peppers as well, and serve everything over angel hair pasta. In fact, I've found it easier to boil the marinade and cook the pasta, then toss the pasta with the marinade to keep it from sticking, and then top it all with the shrimp and veggies. Looks great mounded on a serving platter or in a wide, shallow bowl. Guests we've served this to have raved about it. I usually serve it with grilled asaparagus and a roasted beet salad, with fresh pineapple spears for dessert.

Nothing yummier than this dish! This has been an all-time fave for years, everyone loves it. I add some dry white wine to the marinade/sauce, double (triple?)the cilantro, and always serve over fresh, buttered angel hair pasta, al dente. Even better the next day after flavours meld. No fail crowd-pleaser!

I made this as a sauce to accompany grilled salmon, to the delight of my family. Next time, I will use even less olive oil (3 - 4 T) and add the feta once the marinade is off the heat. The feta crumbles were a bit gelatinous looking when they began to melt.

Rating: 3
The shrimp were delicious! I used wild caughy gulf shrimp - so flavorful - and served them on pasta. I sauted onions, garlic, and red peppers, added some blanched broccoli, a little of the pasta-cooking water, and tossed the pasta and shrimp in the mix. Crumbled the feta on top. Oh, so tasty!

This was good! The grilled onions so make the final dish!!

Yum! I had to change the recipe a bit based on what I had in the house - 1/2 lime juice, 1/2 lemon juice, goat cheese instead of feta, and yellow onion instead of red. Still, this was truly delicious (3 forks), just not sure it was quite exceptional (4 forks). Based on another review, I served this over thin spaghetti - next time I think I will stick with just the onion mixture, shrimp, and some good crusty bread.

YUM! So tasty and easy to make. Followed the previous reviews and used 3 tbsp of olive oil and 4 cloves of garlic. Also used 8 large shrimp (U15). Served over whole wheat pasta with crusty french bread. Grilling is a must for the shrimp and onions!

Rating: 4
Tasted delicious, and looked impressive! I skipped the feta (didn't have any) and used shallots instead of red onions, since I had them in my cupboard, and it turned out fantastic. I served this beside mixed greens drizzled with olive oil, salt, and pepper; the sauce from the shrimp also made a nice dressing for the greens. I can imagine how much better it would have been with the feta. The only downside was having to make my guests peel the shrimp before eating, so next time I may peel them before cooking. Otherwise, I will make this again and again!

I did all these ingredients as a stir fry in a cast iron skillet (I have an electric range) on the grill and tossed them with linguine and some butter. Chopped onion & garlic. Nice.

doubled the recipe (minus some of the olive oil) and added some red pepper flakes to the marinating shrimp. marinated them for a good 4 hours (which cooks them slightly yes) then tossed everything together with al dente fettucine. everyone loved it and my mother is already asking for the recipe.

Rating: 4
I tossed the shrimp with 1 tsp. paprika, 1 tsp. fresh ground pepper, 1/2 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. cayenne before letting it sit in the marinade. It was fantastic, and the spices really brought out the flavor of the marinade. I will definitely make this again.

We made this after our sister in law made it for us one night. It's a great recipe with the oddest ingredients. I would never have thought of putting feta cheese with lime and cilantro. We also added the tomatoes; I served it over rice for the family and over green beans for the cook. Delish!

Very tasty.Used U-8 shrimp...cut oil back to 3 Tbsps and used fat-free feta. Added red pepper flakes as others had suggested and the halved grape tomatos for color, Turned out just fine. Am having trouble not to go picking at it. Marinated shrimp about 1/2 to one hour. Didn't bother with the skewer thing...not necessary unless you have extra time on your hands ;-} Extra garlic didn't hurt either.

Yummy! Thanks to all that offered comments. I followed recipe exactly and opted to add a handful of halved grape tomatoes to the sauce just after it came to a boil. It ended up creamy and full of flavor. Excellent. Served with roasted green beans and red pepper and tossed sauce and shrimp with potato gnocchi. I will serve with linguini next time or just extra veggies.

LOVED this recipe... but made more than a few changes - not a fan of cilantro so I used oregano (feta is greek afterall) I cut back on the lime and served it on a bed of roasted french green beans and grape tomatoes (based on other reviews) - my husband and I licked our plates!

To cut the fat in this recipe, I used 4 tbsp. of olive oil and less than required feta cheese. The feta we used was reduced fat too. This was SO good!! Great for a warm summer night. This one is definately being used again!

I made this just last night and it was terrific. My husband flipped for it as well. Although I like the idea of serving it over angel hair pasta (there is a lot of sauce), to keep it light, I served it over green beans roasted in the oven with some of the marinade and sea salt. I will definitely serve this again.

I made this recipe as a topping for pizza and it was fantastic. I grilled the shrimp and onions, then boiled the marinade, added the feta and cilantro, but left the onions out of the sauce. I made a thin pizza crust, spread with the cheesy sauce, topped with the shrimp, onions, and some sliced tomato. Baked it until the crust was nice and crisp. Wow. My boyfriend said it was my best pizza combination yet.

This is an extremely flavorful and great recipe. It is hard to imagine that anyone would think this is bland. I marinated it for a bit longer than called for...about an hour. I served it with rice pilaf and peas. Will definitely make this again.

To me, the reviews are as important as the recipe. I diced a smallish tomato, added it to the marinade before simmering it and found it took care of the "too tart" complaint, as well as increasing the amount of sauce for the pasta (linguini) I used with the shrimp. We thought the flavors all worked well together. It's a "keeper".

Rating: 4
Again -- you need to let it marinate for an hour or more to really maximize the flavor. I've done several batches overnight and they've been terrific. This is one of only half a dozen or so recipes that I actually follow, and that I've made again (and again, and again....). Enjoy!

I wasn't impressed with this recipe, with all of the positive reviews I expected the flavor to be spectacular. I found it to be very sour and on the bland side.

Loved this recipe - the grilled onions are absolutely essential and add a wonderful balance. I was out of kalamata olives (as a side ) so I served pickled vegetables that I made last winter - recipe is on this site: Gingery Sweet Pickled Vegetables. Major Yum. Incidently, that is an excellent pickled veg recipe. I used vegies from my garden.

All the reviews for this recipe seemed so positive, so I thought I'd give it a try. It had a number of flavors that I really like (lime, feta). This might be the first recipe that I've tried from Epicurious where I was kind of disappointed in the end result. I felt that the sauce came out kind of bland. The part that I don't get is that my dinner guests raved about this dish (served over angel hair as several suggested). So, I'm stuck with a recipe that didn't meet my expectations but yet the peopl I served it to absolutely loved. Go figure. I rate it three forks (1-2 for me, 4 for my guests).

Easy and delicious! My shrimp were a bit small so I just put tin foil down on top of the grill instead of using skewers. We make a shrimp dish at least once a week--we will definately have this one again!

I made the dish exactly as directed. The marinade seasoned the shrimp deliciously. Per other reviewers suggestions, I tossed pasta with the feta sauce but found the sauce too tart and overpowered by lime flavor to be as savory as described. Will likely try recipe again as shrimp marinade only or try to doctor sauce somewhat, perhaps by adding some sweetener.

Loved it, loved it, loved it! My husband had two huge servings at one sitting. Served it over angel hair pasta and couldn't imagine serving it with anything else.

Geez! I haven't had this kind of mouth-gasm in quite some time! We added a skewer of mushrooms to it as well and marinated for a few hours before grilling.

Though this was tasty (2-1/2), I chose it because it fell under kid-friendly. I tried to pass it off to my stepdaughter, it didn't work (she made a face, but she's a good sport and ate most of it) but I didn't really expect it to. How many kids do YOU know that like feta cheese and onions? It needs something else, too.

This was a weird one to figure out. Pasta wasn't exactly what I was thinking, although I agree it needs something. We did it with rice, but that wasn't right, either. Maybe this would work with freshly toasted corn tortillas--sort of taco-like... something? Hmmm.

This is heavenly, a food for the gods. A gourmet meal for the gourmet. My husband and I had this dish for our anniversary, served over angelhair pasta and accompanied by grilled lobster tail. It was the perfect seafood feast and the sauce with the pasta is an excellent combination. We had medium shrimp so rather than skewer, we simply wrapped in foil and grilled. We also used some spicy olive oil (1 tbsp) with no ill effects. If you didn't have to do the dishes afterwards, you would swear you just dropped upwards of $100 in a five-star restaurant.

My wife and I loved it and competed for leftovers the next day. Try this one, you won't be sorry.

I seldom repeat recipes, but this one has become a standard. For a fast meal, I skip the skewers and just cook everything stovetop in one big pan. (One-two pounds of shrimp with the other ingredients increased correspondingly.) Costco has the best price for feta cheese.
