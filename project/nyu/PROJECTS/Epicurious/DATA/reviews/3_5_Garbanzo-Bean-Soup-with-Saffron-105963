My family loves this soup. I make it mostly as written with two small changes. I puree the whole thing before serving, and I add one extra cup of vegetable broth. I prefer the organic "Better Than Bouillon" brand of vegetable broth base over the boxed brands of vegetable broth, like Pacific, because the flavor is less sweet.

I did use sweet potatoes instead of squash but it was really good. I would make this again! yes, more chick peas would be nice.

This is delicious and simple. Perfect with fall veggies. I have added turnips and carrots in recent versions. Best made a day in advance (remove cinnamon stick) so the flavors have time to come together.

for those looking for more spice/seasoning, i recommend the "Quinoa with Moroccan Winter Squash and Carrot Stew" from this site. it always gets rave reviews, and i usually add a can of chickpeas to bump-up the protein content, which would come very close to this recipe.

Very good. Very simple. I have made this many different times with three different types of squash, and all of them were good. I also added one tsp of hot pepper flakes. My two teenagers liked it better with a bit of heat. It is also good with any type of white bean, or hominy as well

Easy, tasty and good for you! The only change I'll make is more garbanzo beans next time. Great recipe!

I am still wondering how ingredients so simple can yield to such amazing flavors.

We used garam masala in place of the curry powder and omitted the cinnamon (didn't have any). I also used chicken stock and pureed the soup a little before adding the chickpeas so that it was nice and thick just the way we like soups like this. It was great; good as leftovers and quick lunches too ... esp with crusty bread. Nice to know it's healthy too. The only change I'd make was maybe a little more chickpeas next time.

I love this flavorful and low fat soup. It's great to have something healthy and warming for lunch. I can understand people's hesitance about the saffron. Luckily I got a ton of saffron threads while in Singapore so I have enough to be silly with it but I may try it sometime with Garam Masala too. I think it would work wonderfully.

I left out the potatos & added chicken breast and a handful of rasins. I have made this soup several times and frozen it for future use. It was great. I also sent it to several women I know who have just had babies & they liked it so much they wanted the recipe.

Great flavor! The cinnamon pairs so well with the cumin! It is hearty enough to satisfy a cold winter craving for soup, but it is also sophisticated tasting to prepare for guests. It's not fussy and its healthy.

I loved this soup, with it's subtle saffron flavour. The cumin I used was very fresh, and I found it a little over-powering, so next time I might reduce the cumin to 1 tsp. I did puree the soup before adding the garbanzo beans, to give the soup a velvety consistency. I served this with a store bought tandoori bread, a perfect complement to the soup's flavours.

This such a fantastic tasting soup and it was so easy to prepare. My whole family loved it including my one year old grandson.

This soup was fabulous - very tasty and healthy. I left out the potatoes and loved it (lower carb).

I have made this soup sevral times and just wanted to add to the comments made thus far. This is a subtle but divine soup. I also use chicken stock rather than the veggie stock called for. Also try adding double the cilantro. It freezes well too.

I used extra garlic, 2 tsp of good curry powder, an extra cinnamon stick, and garam masala instead of saffron and I thought that it turned out great.

Blah - great veggies and texture, but the overall flavor was bland. It took too much 'adjusting' with salt and pepper - it needs more garlic, more saffron...more flavor.

I couldn't get the spices right. It was edible, but not inspiring. The folks at lunch loved two of the other epicurious soups: white bean and chicken chili, and white bean, kale and roasted vegetable soup. They rock!

This is a good comfort food recipe. We used chicken stock instead of the vegetable broth. Had to add extra seasonings but this recipe is a good base to start with. For added richness cream works wonders.

I loved this subtly spiced, aromatic and filling soup but the recipe is definitely under-spiced. I added an extra 2 tsp of cumin, another cinnamon stick and two pinched of cinnamon and it was perfect. Next time I'll definitely try the garam masala idea, but I was out of it when I made the soup. I'm usually an advocate wildly liberal seasoning of soups but in this case, I didn't want to overwhelm the saffron (after paying so much for it). I cooked the chickpeas first, then used the chickpea broth (plus 2 and 1/2 cubes of veg boullion) in place of the stock. I used sweet potatoes instead of squash. I also pureed about 1/4 of the veggies to thicken the soup. If you decide to cook chickpeas instead of using canned, I'd reccomend making hummus as a course after the soup. Also, as others mentioned, the soup thickens considerably the second day which is something to keep in mind if you're making it ahead of time.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and didn't find this soup all that tasty. It is very healthy and nutritious but is lacking something that I can't quite put my finger on in terms of flavor. Perhaps I needed to increase the garlic and cumin as other reviewers did - I found the soup to be rather bland.

Rating: 4
This was outstanding! The cinnamon, cumin, and cilantro combine to give this soup the most wonderful flavorand aroma!

This soup is absolutely fabulous - I added an extra cinnamon stick, an extra tsp of cumin, an extra clove of garlic and some hot chili sauce to give it a bit of a kick. This soup is FAR from bland! I love it and plan to make it for my soup club at work.

I broke my jaw and had my mouth wired shut for 6 weeks, so liquid food was all I could eat. My husband made this one for me (minus the cilantro and saffron) and then pureed it in the blender. He had the unblended version which was very blah. But the blended version is spectacular!!! We now make it at least once a month and just love it. We've also added a dollop of sour cream for a richer, creamier soup.

After reading the recipe and reviews, I was expecting dynamite, but I found this recipe bland! I ended up using almost triple the cumin called for, and added liberal pinches of saffron and more garlic halfway through. That certainly improved the flavor, but next time I make it I'll be experimenting with some non-traditional exceptions. It IS very healthy and filling.

This soup was awesome. I'm a newlywed and am trying all sorts of new recipes. This is one of my favorite soups yet. I used dried garbanzo bean and took way longer than I thought it would. Next time I will start the beans much sooner so that squash doesn't become squishy.

I liked this soup a lot. It was quite different and very easy to make. I might add more garbanzo beans next time, but then again, I'm a big fan of garbanzo beans...

I don't review very often, so when I do it's only for the best recipes- this was EXCELLENT! Easy to prepare, delicious and low fat. Don't forget to rinse your garbanzos before adding.

Excellent, sophisticated, but easy to prepare, soup. The saffron adds wonderful color and complex flavor. We served it for a Sunday lunch with a nice loaf of bread and everyone enjoyed it immmensely. Highly recommended

I made this the first time for a party, and everyone loved it and asked for recipe. My boyfriend didn't like it too much the night that I made it, but after letting it sit overnight, he loved it. I think that is the key to all soups, let it sit overnight.

Yummy soup! I used vegetable bouillon cubes instead of canned vegetable soup. Another place to purchase saffron is at an Indian or Middle Eastern shop where the price is more reasonable than at a regular grocery store.

This is a fantastic recipe, especially after incorporating some of the previous suggestions. To Tracey in Burnaby: I know saffron is expensive, but there really is no substitute, especially in risottos and other dishes that are not quite so heavily spiced. If you're ever in Duncan, BC, there's a Dutch delicatessen, here, that sells saffron for less than $3/gram.

My vegan husband loved this soup. Mind you I didn't tell him how much the saffron cost!It said right on the bottle it is the most expenisve spice in the world and the little package inside couldn't have held more than 2 teaspoons, for $12. May try a substitution next time.

This was a great soup! I didn't have any saffron or garam masala, so I improvised slightly. I added ground cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin, paprika, and chili pepper (sort of my own garam masala). I used about 1/8 teaspoon of each, but more cinnamon.....the result was great! I also pureed half of the squash to make it creamier. The subtle warmth of the spices with the warm soup made a great winter soup!!!

This is a great recipe. Ground cinnamon works fine if you do not have cinnamon sticks. I cut the vegetables in bigger pieces and served the stew over couscous.

A wonderful, warming, main meal soup. I used sweet potato instead of ordinary & used a potato masher to break the vegetables up a bit when cooked, to thicken it up. It also went really well with cubed gorgonzola piccante stirred in, as the spicing is very subtle.

ALWAYS rinse and drain canned beans to get rid of excess salt! I would first roast halved whole squash, and then puree to add to soup. NONE of these recipes show amounts of sodium. I have been on low sodium for years, and now have had to add low cholesterol and low fat.

Very good! We did cook it longer than instructed in the recipe. We also added additional herbs and spices to increase flavor, and even tried it topped with grated cheddar which was great. A very easy recipe, and delish!

Wonderfully mellow low-fat soup in which the whole seemed far more than the sum of its part. Took out a little of the veg and pureed before adding beans and this worked well. For UK cooks, a good vegetable stock powder like marigold works fine.

This was delicious. Simple, satisfying and healthy. I increased the garlic a little bit.

This soup is excellent. I made it for dinner tonight and it's the perfect cold weather soup. I increased the garlic, butternut squash, cumin and used 5 cans of vegetable broth instead of 5 cups. You'll need the extra liquid with more veggies. I didn't even add salt and pepper and it was really delicious. I can't believe that a low fat soup can be so tasty.

Great soup. I followed the earlier suggestion of substituting garam marsala for the part of the cumin & all of the cinnamon (1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp garam masala) and loved it.

This soup is outstanding. I am a lover of soups in the winter and this one is perfect for cold winter nights. I did substitute 1/2T Garam Masala for the cinnamon and cumin with great success. (Not to mention that it makes the whole house smell wonderful.) I also increased the garlic to 3 large cloves. I thought about pureeing before I added the garbanzos but then decided against it. I am glad I did because on the second day the butternut squash seemed to melt into the broth making a much thicker base. Serve it with some nice hot flat bread.

I absolutely loved this recipe. My fried from Yemen made a dish that tasted just like this once and I've always wanted the recipe. It's incredible. I made cous cous, which I served in each individual bowl, then poured the soup over it. To make cous cous, the ratio is 1 c. cous cous to 1 1/2 c. water. Boil the water, then add the cous cous and stir. Reduce heat to simmer and cover. Cook for 5 minutes and fluff occasionally with a fork while cooking. The cous cous really absorbs the broth...I might try to make it with a little extra broth next time.

This soup was out-of-this-world delicious! At the suggestion of the Toronto chef, I increased the garlic quotient by using canned tomatoes that were preflavored with roasted garlic. Peeling and chopping the squash were a bit tedious, but well worth it.

A nice, light, vegetarian soup. I pureed some of it to make it a little smoother, which is how I like soup. It could use a little more garlic, try 4 cloves.
