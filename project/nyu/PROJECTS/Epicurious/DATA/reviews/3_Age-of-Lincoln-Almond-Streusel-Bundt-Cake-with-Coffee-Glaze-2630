I too found this cake dry, and a little too sweet for my taste. I dont think its worth the effort.

I absolutely love this cake, but I can see how someone in search of the perfect bundt cake could be disappointed - without any sour cream or buttermilk, it's not as dense and moist as the best bundt cake, but with the tender crumb and lightness due to the cake flour and egg whites, not to mention the wonderful almond taste, it offers a delicious change. By the way, I've made it twice now and it has never been anywhere near "dry".

Delicious cake. I added some sour cream to combat the dryness. Very almond flavor due to the almond paste (the paste I found was imported from Germany).

What is almond paste? Any idea where I can find it in Belgium?

This is really an unusual and superb cake. If it was dry for some, I suspect overbaking -- ours was moist. Glaze didn't harden; more sugar might fix that. Beautiful and worth the effort.

I was very excited to make this cake, but I too found it very dry. The filling and glaze were good, but I needed a glass of milk just to get the cake down.

i saw this recipe and thought it looked great; it even had good reviews to back it up. unfortunately, this cake was dry and rather tasteless. i don't have a picky family, and still no one liked this cake. i followed the recipe and ingredients exactly and it just wasn't good. i would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

When I read the ingredients and the previous reviews, my mouth started to water and I couldn't wait to have an opportunity to make this cake. Although the flavor is excellent, I and the people I served it to, found the cake very dry. I prefer a moister bundt cake.

Chock full o' almonds.... not only a dessert, it could be a main course. The icing/glaze leaves a bit to be desired. Great with coffee or a good vanilla ice cream. The crew at Starbucks loved it!

Absolutely the best. I couldn't believe how good it was. If you like almonds, this is the cake for you. It goes great with coffee/tea and keeps well for days. One thing: it's not as fast and easy as one reviewer said. It takes some time to make, but it's well worth it.

I love this recipe. I am an almond lover and this cake is surprisingly quick to put together and very tasty. GREAT with coffee.

It is easily one of the best cake recipes I use. If I am baking for special friends, I often turn to this recipe.

It's a good recipe but you have to love almonds. Took it to the office and most people liked it - one woman had to have the recipe and was planning her next dinner party around it. One baking issue - 60 minutes might be a little too long for some ovens - so make sure you check the cake a little sooner.

I would make this again, but I do have to sort of voice a personal gripe here. The good Mrs. Lincoln couldn't possibly have made the recipe using the ingredients listed; no instant coffee, no baking powder, no confectioner's sugar . . . they simply were not around at that time. This is a modern interpretation of what may or may not be an historic recipe. No one should interpret it as anything more!
