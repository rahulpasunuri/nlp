I loved this recipe. It reminds me of traditional chinese chicken and chesnuts, but with an almost french preparation. I used flour instead of corn starch to thicken. You can find bags of roasted chestnuts for about $1.29 at your local chinese/Korean marts. I'd recommend the national chain H-mart for these kind of provisions.

Well I hope the recipe is as entertaining as the reviews. Note i didn't fork it as i have not yet made it. But it does remind me a braised duck dish that I love at a Vietnamese restaurant in town! So i am sure it will great!

I have made this dish several times, always with the Olorosa sherry option, and I've had foodie guests tell me that it's the best chicken they're ever eaten. The real chestnuts are a must-- water chestnuts may have the same name, but they aren't related.

This is tasty. However, it is too much work for the results. i've been making a family chicken recipe that tastes very similar, with half of the work. Anyway, used bonelees skinless thighs. My Chinese mushrooms were awful, so I use some cremini. I much prefer water chestnuts to roasted chestnuts. It gives it a crunch. I added garlic and green onions in the beginning. Towards the end I added red pepper (crushed and whole), thinly sliced napa cabbage, , and some bean sprouts. I really like the smokiness of the prosciutto.

I made this recipe AS IS for a group dinner last Easter - just ran into it again while tralling for a recipe for next Saturday nights dinner party. It was excellent. A bit fidlee and many traps for the unwary but well worth the effort. Our guests raved. Cheers.

A definite keeper! I substituted a handful of diagonally sliced celery and spring onions for the chestnuts (which I added with the ham towards the end of cooking time). In addition, I served the dish over a small portion of cellophane (rice) noodles,more customary in Vietnamese cooking - the amount of noodles shouldn't overwhelm the chicken braise. Used thigh fillets on the bone which I cooked a little longer than recommended in recipe - the meat was tender without falling away from the bone - perfect. Let me make it easier for you: I didn't have time to marinate overnight and realised that the sauce and marinade are virtually the same so I marinated for half an hour or so and retained marinade, added quantities to match sauce portions, chicken broth etc. (and threw in cornstarch at this stage, no need to add separately to thicken). The chicken took in the marinade during the browning process and soaked it up during the slow cooking time. A perfect one-pot dish! Hope this helps ....

Thanks everyone, for the most entertaining comment trail yet. I learn from both the substitutions and the strict adherents, so am happy to see both. The witty trash-talking is a major bonus.

hey folks - did you know it's possible to leave comments without fork-rating the recipe, as i am doing right now? here's the middle ground! people who modify can leave comments, and people who follow the recipe religiously can use the fork-rating system as well! i rarely make the recipe as it is exactly written, but i love leaving comments, so this is what i do. and sometimes i do follow the recipe completely, or with minor subs, ie., NOT vinegar for wine (!!! tmcguff is kinda right, people. vinegar \= wine.), and in that case i will rate it. ALSO you are not required to answer the "would you make it again? yes/no" question either.

The last three reviewers are still missing the point. No one said that you shouldn't make substitutions. We are only suggesting that you try and review the original recipe first. It's understandable if you can't get the all the ingredients, but the wine aside, none of this should be hard to find for the average consumer.

Let's all live and let live. Our taste buds aren't all exactly the same anyway and our idea of what is a three-fork recipe or a four-forker differs anyway, so these ratings are not exact anyway. I'd rather hear people's modifications and how that went. That's what I learn from.

Interesting that a guy is 'always surprised' when he sees the same thing over and over. Must be a texas thing. With most people, surpise wears off with repetition. Anyway, the good news is this is now the recipe of the day and perhaps more people will make it, or something like it. I understand the epiconformist viewpoint with the altar and all the bowing and scraping. Then there is the curious view that says "ok, we are not all restaurant chefs..." what are we going to do with idea. So having biked for hours around town looking for ingredients that in the end only make slight tweaks to a dish, I start off with what we have at the base commisary and see where that leads. It got me close enough that I'd probably try it again with more of the "correct" ingredients that came down from olympus when god invented this recipe and whispered it in the ear of a lucky chef. Now, that said, the reviewer below did validate that the recipe was better using all the right the stuff as I thought. And yes I do suffer from americanizing things that I cook in america. In fact, I tend to southwest them because I'm in san diego. back in san francisco, I'd have gotten closer to the original thanks to all the asian markets there. Taking the idea that food is more than flavor, this dish features chicken and ginger, two of the healthier products people can put in the mouths. so yeah, recipe of the day, good news. If you are a purist, by all means, make this your life's work. If you are not, tweak and share. and yes, i will also agree that forking a tweaked recipe is bad form and in the future will refrain. toodles.

Phooey! I love tmcguff's review--perfection! But I also appreciate the reveiws of those who substitute ingredients. Not everyone caters, or has the time to hunt down every exotic or authentic ingredient & it's nice to know how reasonable substitutions turn out. I'm glad this is a winner & look forward to making it. Thanks to those who reveiw--following the recipe or with substitutions. Learning from others has helped my cooking tremendously.

Nice! And thanks to Mr. McGuff from Houston for appropriately chastizing so- called reviewers who make so many substitutions that they are no longer reviewing the recipe that was presented in the first place. The idea of a review is that it should help one know how well the recipe works AS IS.

Cheers to you, tmcguff! I am in complete agreement with you about reviewers that change a recipe and then give a fork rating to their own creation. Kudos, also, for one of the finest written reviews I have read on this site. I will try this recipe (as written) and report back.

First a comment on "not making the recipe". I'm always surprised at reviewers in this space that drastically change a recipe and then write a review. Unless it's a subtlety, like substituting one kind of mushroom for another, or good sherry for Shaoxing rice wine, you're now making an entirely different recipe. The reviewer below substitutes vinegar for sweet wine. Imaging using red wine vinegar in Chicken Marsala, instead of sweet wine. You get the idea. This recipe is superb, and is as close as you may come to cooking a true Chinese style dish in your home, as it is wholly unlike Americanized Chinese food. The ham and chestnuts are secondary elements, and I think not too unimportant to the dish. The flavors imparted by the ginger and Shaoxing wine are what shine in this dish. And for that reasons I also disagree with the first reviewers idea of adding more pepper. The depth of flavor imparted by the two wines and ginger is impressive, and it is important that you marinate overnight. Since the chicken picks up so much moisture from the marinate, browning is a mess on your stovetop. This Saturday I'll be using this recipe for a catered party for 60 people, and will grill marinated chicken thighs instead of pan-browning whole chicken pieces. Note the instruction to put the breast on top....you don't want to over cook it - so maybe all dark meat is a good approach. You can get dried black Chinese mushrooms that are sliced into long ribbons (think Mu Shu Pork) - they go well in this dish. Overall, this is one of the best Asian recipes I've ever seen in Gourmet (20 year subscriber) - and possibly one of the better recipes ever published. Of course, since it's from a restaurant, I'll now have to find my way to Chapel Hill.

edit: dried black trumpet mushroom I should have said.

Made three changes to the recipe based on availabilty of ingredients. Used dried black knight mushrooms. Could have used fresh shitakes, but thought I'd get more intensity using something dried. Used water chestnut for the roasted chestnuts. and substituted rice wine vinegar for the sherry. So I probably killed the rating by the downgrades, really thought this was a B+ or A- dish as I made it, and suspect that getting the exact ingredients gets it up to an A. The way I did it, I'd up the white pepper a bit to make it spicier. I marinated the chicken two days and it did pick up pretty good flavors from the marinade. so overall was happy with it and would make it again, figure I'll tweak it a bit to see how to make it work with the ingredients that I can find.
