This recipe is exceptional. I tried it a few years ago just becasue it sounded interesting. I served it at a dinner party where every morsel was gone. I think they licked the plates. I have made it many more times always with rave reviews and from some pretty picky people. I did not vary the recipe at all. It is perfect the way it is. I will make this recipe again and again.

This is a super recipe! Served at a dinner party last evening, and everyone devoured it. The smell of roast alone was very appetizing. We'll do this again.

This was WONDERFUL!! I made it on Monday evening to take to work the rest of the week. My local grocery store had chuck roast on sale, so I used that, and roasted it after rubbing it in the spices. Then I put it in the frig. I made the dressing in advance and put that in the frig, too. Each day, I've been thinly slicing the roast and putting it in a tupperware. In the other part of the tupperware, I put some dressing (it's divided). Then in a bigger tupperware I put the greens. At lunch, I add the dressing to the greens and nuke the chuck roast for a minute. Then I add them all together. The result is delicious, definately a keeper.

This was wonderful! Try doubling the spice mixture and saving half for future use. I have substituted chicken breasts and pork tenderloin for the beef - both were very good.

It was a really good basis for a meal. Treat it as a template - I added avocado to the salad, and mixed various peppery salad leaves - looks better. I also put some salad under the steak and not much on top. The dressing was a bit sparse, so made more of it, and swopped good soya sauce for salt in that. I used red spring onions instead of shallots as they're hard to get in South Africa.

Really excellent -- made this with the pearl couscous, and it was a big hit.

Cooked this for 30 people, and even w/that volume, it turned out well. Used tri-tip instead, and it was still tender and flavorful.

I've made this twice for company already and once for just us. It is that good! And so easy. One note, when I made it for just two of us, I used two small fillet mignon's instead of a whole tenderloin and coated the fillet's with the seasoning. It was VERY spicy, even for us. If you reduce the meat portion, or are shy about food with a "kick", you might want to experiment with a little less red pepper - it's a lot easier to add than to subtract! The salad is the perfect 'foil" for the spice, I would not make one without the other. I highly recommend this dish as written.

I very much enjoyed this dish. I cut down on the chile flakes and next time I will cut down on the salt a bit as well. I was concerned the salad dressing would be too boring, but it balanced nicely against the spicy meat. I'll be making this dish for company
