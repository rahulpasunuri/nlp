Actually, REAL Hawaiian Chili Pepper water doesn't NEED to be shaken. Most times, my grandfather would strain the peppers and the seeds and garlic out and throw them away. This recipe isn't exactly what I was brought up with, but it's definitely a quick and easy way to add spice to our food. I added in a little ginger (we eat a lot of asian food in our home and the ginger adds something to it,) and it IS called chili pepper WATER for a reason. A lot of people add it to their food when they're ready to eat, but I usually add it in to stews and other dishes BEFORE they're done cooking. It's also good for getting your children to stop biting their fingernails (my mom used to soak our fingertips in chili pepper water if she caught us biting on them.) Just be careful not to touch your eyes!!

Ditto "A Cook from SF Bay..." Colorful, light and packs heat. A very flavorful blend of peppers/garlic/ginger/salt. Easy to create, and one of my most requested items.

The other reviewers have missed the beauty of this condiment; it is light, almost tasteless, but has heat. You can use this chili-pepper water to add heat to any dish, even poached eggs, without altering the original flavor or texture of your dish. If you already have a great tasting, well-prepared dish that just needs a little heat, this is for you!

Not too impressive. It really is water - no thickness to it at all. Yes, it's spicy, but we had to keep shaking up the bottle as most of the ingredients kept settling to the bottom. Most of my guests didn't really see the point to it.

The REAL chili-pepper water served in REAL Hawaiian restaurants is simply two or three "bird" peppers, found growing wild in dry places in Hawaii, mashed or cut into about eight or ten ounces of plain water or half water- half white vinegar, sometimes with a little salt. A ketchup bottle is used as a container. A cork cut with two small slits to allow the sauce to drip out keeps the FIRE contained!
