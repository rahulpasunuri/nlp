Not impressed. Despite taking the advice suggested in the reviews, it was still relatively bland.

Light and tasty, and simple to prepare. This went well with the sesame scallops, and made a pretty presentation.

This recipe has a mild, fresh flavor and is quick and easy to make. The peas are an accent, so don't consider this dish a vegetable exchange. I make this recipe with chicken broth in place of the water, as this greatly enhances the flavor. I would not ever make this dish again with water, though the flavors of this dish are obviously meant to be subtle, I found the recipe to be too bland for our tastes without the broth.

So-so results. Although it was easy to prepare, it lacked zing. I will skip this recipe next time and just do regular rice or pasta.

Not a very interesting recipe. The great flavor of peas was lost amidst the mounds of couscous. I even added extra seasonings but still not that exciting.

Great fresh recipe, absolutely loved it with the seared sea scallops. So simple and tasty!

The couscous had a nice subtle flavor. I served it with grilled lemon chicken. It was a nice accompaniment. It was easy to make and took only 10-15 minutes to prepare with instant couscous.
