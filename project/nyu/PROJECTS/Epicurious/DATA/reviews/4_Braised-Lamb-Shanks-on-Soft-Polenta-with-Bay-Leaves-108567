This dish is absolutely positively DELICIOUS. I omitted the orange zest as suggested by many reviewers and added some minced garlic to the onion saute. Best made a day ahead to easily remove fat from sauce before reducing and flavor only improves! Everyone loved it.

I made this for two of us, because we get lamb shanks from time to time with our meat CSA share (local meat farm that you subscribe to for monthly meat delivery). I used almost all the full amounts for the sauce, except for the chicken broth, which I cut to two cups. I still had a hard time boiling down the sauce, even though I kept the cooking times the same. It was yummy and very fragrant. I'd cut down the orange peel two about a quarter of what is called for regardless of the amount of meat I'm cooking, but keep mushrooms, wine, and onions the same as called for in the recipe. Oh, and for wine - affordable "cooking" Barolo is kind of impossible to find, but Shiraz is cheap and comparable. I bought an $8 McWilliams and sacrificed a cup to the recipe and drank the rest with dinner. Just right!

I used 1 large orange AND the reviewer's suggestion for an orange zest gremolata as well - not overdone on the orange taste and the gremolata makes for a great presentation. I couldn't bear to use my precious $50 bottle of Brunello in the sauce, thank you - the $12 bottle of Chianti was fine. I used Knorr chicken broth diluted 1:1 with water - the sauce didn`t need any additional salt. A very rich dish indeed. I served fresh fruit and unbelievably, no one ate the Asiago cheese - enuf fat already!

Delicious, complex and hearty. Rather than soaking the porcinis, I ground them into powder and added that to the braising liquid. I also tossed in a cup or so of demi glace I had on hand. I oven braised the lamb for several hours on low heat and got a very succulent result. Regarding the orange peel, I opted to leave that out while cooking, but then served the finished dish with a gremolata made of orange zest, parsley and garlic. The freshness of the orange zest contributed a very bright note to the overall flavor and made a pretty garnish.

Lidia does it again. This recipe was a total hit for our Easter dinner. The lamb was flavorful and tender, and the braising sauce divine. I didn't change a thing on the recipe, although I did feel that the sauce was a bit too orangey. Maybe next time I will remove the peels a little early. I used a leg of lamb, which was larger, and just increased the cooking time to about 2 1/2 hours. Highly recommended!

This was a fantastic dish. I made exactly as written except I left the bay leaves out of the polenta. My pan wasn't big enough for the 8 cups of chicken stock, so at the end I added 2 cups stock to the sauce and then reduced that to 5 cups. I served Brussels sprouts with marjoram and pine nuts with this and it was a great combination.

Made this with osso bucco lamb shanks, next time will make with regular shanks. The osso bucco style seemed to get a bit overcooked, wasn't as tender as regular shanks generally are. Didn't reduce the sauce completely, but it was still great, even if it was a little thin. I thought the polenta was a bit heavy on the bay, and only had to add about three cups of water after the original five to get it nice and creamy.

Have fixed a half-dozen lamb shank meals following different recipes over the years, and this one tops the others by far! My wife and I loved it, and our guests, all serious lamb connoiseurs, raved about it! Followed the recipe to a T. The dried porcinis are a must, and don't even think about substituting anything for the orange juice/orange peel. Also make sure that you take the time to properly reduce the sauce. Served it over a rather simple soft polenta, adding butter and some shredded asiago cheese. Added a side dish of cannellini and pearl onions topped with roasted tomatoes, which was almost as big a hit as the lamb. Can't wait to try it again.

What a great recipe. I was a bit leery having read the other reviews, and I did make a few adjustments. I doubled the recipe (12 person dinner party) so halved the orange juice/peel) and added 12 minced garlic cloves at the beginning with the onions. Skiiped the cloves as I had none, but added some thyme and sage to the bouquet garni. I did not really have to adjust the sauce which was really terrific. My husband said it was the best dinner he had ever had including top restaurants. The guests ate EVERYTHING. I served with parsleyed white beans, caramelized shallots and roast asparagus. Will be repeating for years as I love a good dinner party recipe that can be made the day before.

Lamb shanks are frequently on our menu at home, so I was delighted to see yet another version. Alas, it failed the taste test rather badly. Although it is quite similar to one of my recipes, I wanted to make this one exactly as written. I did wonder, with all the strong flavours, if dried porcini mushrooms could possibly have any flavourful effect....they didn't (and at the price, that was disappointing). I found the orange flavour did not marry well with the lamb, although the other ingredients worked quite well. My guests, all lamb afficionados, agreed it was not up to their expectations. I'm removing it from my recipe book.

Substituted lemon juice/peel and sauteed crimini mushrooms but followed recipe to letter except for that. Skim, skim, skim. Delicious and worth the effort. Wonderful leftovers. Thanks Lydia.

Fork-tender, juicy and incredibly flavorful lamb. Time consuming, yes. Difficult, no. Most of the time required for this recipe just calls for simmering the lamb, leaving you free to your own devices. My shanks were particularly large (7 lbs total), and I couldn't fit them all in a single layer in one pot. Instead, I simmered two batches of three shanks each simutaneously in two separate Dutch ovens with the FULL sauce recipe in each pot (I like sauce, and I was worried that too little cooking liquid would ruin the recipe and my pots). Easy and fantastic, although be sure to keep an eye on both pots before the lamb simmmers and when the sauce is reducing at the end; I had two diff't makes of Dutch ovens (heavy All-Clad and a lighter, more inexpensive pot), and the cooking times did vary a bit. I made the polenta while the sauce was reducing for the last 35 minutes, and the timing was perfect. Not a huge fan of the polenta on its own, but it was much better w/ the extra lamb sauce.

i hate to give it 3 forks, but for me 4 are for really special dishes. this is really great though, even having left out some arguably key ingredients, like using diluted salty gross bouillon cubes instead of chicken stock, no mushrooms, no wine, thickened with cornstarch and served with spinach sauteed in butter with parmesan, the whole recipe guestimated to scale for just one serving, and i will admit that i rubbed the shank with some emeril essence that i made for another recipe. it was GREAT! i loved this, although i'm not quite sure i know how to attack a shank yet. i think it pairs nicely with the spinach. i've made the polenta before, but this is the first time and not the last that i have attempted the lamb portion. great easy super tasty dish! i especially appreciated the layer of fat on top being really tasty!

I made this yesterday so we could have it for dinner today,thus allowing the flavors to marry and to simplify degreasing. The porcinis lent a very earth aroma, and the final sauce was very rich tasting. The meat was fork tender and extremely flavorful, and the polenta soaked up the sauce nicely. I imagine this will continue to improve for dinner tomorrow! I also served fresh asparagus with this, and a Pinot Noir. The whole family swooned, and I got fresh flowers from my husband, too!

Very good and a nice way to end winter (we hope). I used 2 oranges and liked the flavor. Used instant polenta. Yuck. Next time, I'll either make with real polenta or regular grits. I made 8 shanks so we'd have leftovers so couldn't fit them in one layer. Not a problem.

After all the four fork reviews, maybe my expectations were too high. Or maybe the awesome smell coming from the pot set my expectations too high. But in the end it was just "very good", not the must-make-for-company taste that I was hoping for. Based on suggestions below, I used only one large orange. This was definitely enough for a distinct but not overpowering effect. All in all, I'll definitely be making this again.

Very, very good. And easy. Delicious souce, which even my 4 year old enjoyed. Perfect with fresh green salad.

Incredible. I didn't change a thing, except w/the polenta I eliminated the salt by using 5 c. 99% fat free chicken broth with 5c. of water. I've made this recipe twice for guests - everyone raved. It's great for a party because you can prepare everything ahead. I served it once with roasted beets with goat cheese; the second time I made the asparagus with goat cheese and bacon. Both were excellent accompaniments.

This dish was fabulous! We follwed everyone's suggestion to reduce the amount of orange peel which was perfect. We served this dish with a great salad, crusty country bread and a delicious red wine. This was a perfect dinner!

Following the previous review, I pureed the sauce in a blender and then passed it through a sieve. Most delicious, an interesting blend of oranges, rosemary and porcini and sieved it becomes a beautiful sauce!

I followed the reviews and used only one orange -orange flavour was subtle. I didn't have any polenta unfortunately but I did try the roasted yams from Bon Appetit Nov issue with orange/lemon and coriander. Very nice. Thanks for warming up a grey day here.

This dish is fantastic! One might find the orange peel too overpowering...i wil propably reduce the peel from one instead of 2 oranges but use the juices from 2 organges. The flavour from the porcini and home made stock blended so well and was so flavourful that i did not even have to season it. Definitely a keeper!

This is an excellent recipe for lamb -- I made it on Sunday, and it was terrific! Truly restaurant quality at home. I thought that the orange peels were a little too prominent in this dish, so next time I make it, I'll probably ditch the fresh oranges and just pour in about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of good-quality store-bought juice. Also, I made it with only 4 1-lb lamb shanks -- to save on money and effort. The only other proportion I fooled with was the chicken stock -- I made this in a dutch oven b/c I don't have a pot with a wide enough base, and it came out fine. I used only as much stock as it took to cover the meat -- about 5.5 cups -- and then added a little bit more as the sauce cooked down, again, just to keep it covered. I left everything else the same -- the more sauce, the merrier!! I halved the recipe for the polenta and it made more than enough. I used quick-cooking polenta, and it saved time and tasted great. The bay leaves go a long way to make it different than your average polenta! This is a time-intensive recipe, but no complaints given the results!

I have always loved Lidia's cooking and this recipe was heavenly! I had lamb shanks in my freezer, just waiting for something this delicious! I used mineolla oranges and I also pureed the sauce with my Braun hand blender, after cooking it down. Then I strained it. I used fresh bay leaves and rosemary from my garden. The sauce was great the next day over the leftover polenta.
