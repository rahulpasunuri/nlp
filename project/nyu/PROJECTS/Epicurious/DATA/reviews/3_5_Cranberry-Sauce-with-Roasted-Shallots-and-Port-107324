This is super yummo delicious! It has become a part of our thanksgiving menu every year! People request it often and I usually freeze half and use that at Christmas. If I can't find currants, I use raisins and I find that 12 large shallots is enough. Also,akes a beautiful holiday gift in a mason jar with a pretty ribbon. THE BEST CRANBERRY SAUCE!

This recipe has become one of my favorite things about Thanksgiving. A few things to note. The first time I made it, I made it the same day, and my guests didn't really like it. The second time I made it, I made it the weekend before, and everybody raved about it. This is one of those recipes that melds into something magical if you give it a few days in the fridge. Second, I would leave out the marjoram - it imparted a grassy flavor that in my opinion just didn't go with the rest of the flavors - but you may love marjoram. Third, this year I substituted dried tart cherries that I found at Whole Foods for the dried currants, to great effect - I will look for them again next year. Fourth, don't miss trying this on a turkey sandwich the next day. Fifth, my fantasy refrigerator would have this in it all year round.

This is one of the few recipes that I continue to make year after year. It also makes a great gift - I can it in pretty quilted jars. It is excellent over brie and very wine-friendly.

Normally I am not a cranberry eater and a friend of mine made this for once Thanksgiving and I loved them and made this recipe the following Thanksgiving. You do have to keep a watchful eye on the shallots; mine didn't take nearly as long to cook as the recipe indicates and I burnt a few. I also didn't use more than 10 shallots and do think 18 would be overkill. These cranberries were AMAZING with leftovers the next day; they do seem to get better as the flavors come together with time.

I've made this before and liked it very much.I think in years past I used Tawny Port because that's all I had. This year I used thw Ruby Port (1 cup instead of 1 2/3) and about 12 shallots (most were large). Everyone raved.

This was a huge hit. I cheaped out and used red wine and small onions instead, and it turned out great. This may become the new mainstay cranberry recipe for the holidays - with the cheaper ingredient

This recipe was a huge hit. One of our guests was a vegetarian and after dinner we brainstormed about all the dishes this recipe would complement. Baked Brie, toasted pound cake, roast pork, baked squash, arugula salad with goat cheese, grilled salmon steaks, Pancakes or french toast stuffed wit cream cheese, cream cheese and crackers. the possibilities seem endless. It is a great recipe. The readers who thought it was bitter may have cooked the shallots too long so they tasted burned, this would make it taste bitter. The cranberries are definately tart tasting, but this is what makes this recipe good. It is not too sweet and cloying and it lends itself to many possibilities.

I loved this receipe, as did my adult daughter. Absolutely delicious! Sadly, the rest of those at the Thanksgiving table did not have adventurous/discrimating tastes and ate the jellied stuff that they themselves had brought (ugh!) I will definitely save this recipe and serve it to those who will appreciate it.

I thought this recipe was great. I used tawny port instead of ruby port (much cheaper!) and used only half the amount specified, simply using water for the remaining liquid. I skipped the dried currants and marjoram and concentrated on the thyme flavor. This tastes gorgeous with stilton.

made this for tgiving b/c I was tired of the alternative. it was FABULOUS! All 9 people at the table went for 2nd and 3rd servings. It was the only thing NOT leftover that we wished were! Sent my mom and mother-in-law home with the recipe.

I got really excited baking the shallots - everything smelled so good, I figured it was all gonna be great. Once I added the port and sugar, it all went downhill. I agree with the reviewer who found it bitter. I ended up throwing it out. I will use the shallot-recipe in other dishes, though..

What a wonderfully yummy recipe! The combination of the sweet/tart cranberries, the sweetness of the port, and the bite of the shallots made for an interesting and delicious combination!

Rating: 2
I have to admit I didn't much care for this, although others at the table did. I didn't like the oily roasted shallot flavor and couldn't taste the thyme at all. Considering the cost, including the beautiful organic cherries I used & the port, I think there are better, fresher & brighter tasting recipes to be found.

I know it's great to explore variations on tradition, but this one misses the mark. The effort is too much and the ingredients are too expensive for me to make this again. One upside--this sauce goes quite well with brie as a leftover idea.

Rating: 4
Abolutely delicious! So much better than canned, needless to say. I had to saute/carmelize the shallots on the stove due to lack of oven space on Turkey Day, and I coarsely chopped them and they were not at all too overpowering in the end. We also substituted dried cherries for the currants and it was a big hit! I will be making this again for Christmas for sure. Enjoy!

Doubled this recipe (1 bottle of wine)and shared with a neighbor. The best cranberries I've ever had.

Rating: 4
This is my latest cranberry sauce after using the standard orange/cranberry/candied ginger one for 25 years. It was a big hit with Thanksgiving dinner. I did chop the shallots and for my own taste I think I'll add a little more sugar, but that's the extent of fiddling with it. This is just plain ole good and not really a lot of work and can be made ahead of time.

I've made this recipe twice. As a trial run before Thanksgiving (served with roasted duck) and then at my husbands family Thanksgiving dinner. The skeptics wanted a "normal" cranberry sauce also served "just in case"...but my cranberry sauce was a hit and I received many requests for the recipe. The only change I made is that I coarsely chopped the shallots after roasting. Will definitely make this again--not just for the holidays.

FABULOUS! What a nice change from the basic cranberry sauce recipe.

This was absolutely terrible. I followed the recipe exactly, even used a good ruby port, and was rewarded with a bitter, unpleasant dish. Everyone at the table took one bite, and stayed away for the rest of the meal. It all went straight to the trash!

SIMPLY SUBLIME. How can we ever go back to boring old cran sauce now that we've tried this? We are ruined for the ordinary. It's sooooo good! This is now the family standard. Very easy to make a day ahead, too. Killer on sandwiches the next day.

This was way too much work and expense for the outcome. Too weird, not traditional enough. My father who has pretty eclectic taste took one bite and that was it. The rest went into the trash. I will never make this again.

This was delicious. I really like the addition of the shallots and the port. I cut down on the sugar as per reviews, but ended up adding some back because it was too tart for my taste. Next time I won't cut down on the sugar. I cut the shallots into smaller pieces and that worked well.

Rating: 3
Given previous reviews, I cut the sugar down a bit. I absolutely loved this. The only change I would make is cutting the shallots to a smaller size. It would be nice to not have to worry about cutting into bite size pieces on the plate.

I made this yesterday and although I personally preferred it to the cranberry/orange type relishes I've made in the past, I didn't get the oohs and aahs from the guests that I'd anticipated. A couple of people remarked mildly that it was 'very nice', but it wasn't the show-stopper I'd counted on, based on the rave reviews. And I did follow the recipe to the letter!

I made this yesterday and I did think it was very good. Several people remarked mildly that it was nice but I didn't get the oohs and aahs I was expecting from all the rave reviews I read. I might make it again because I personally preferred it to most of the cranberry/orange type relishes I've made in the past, but I was disappointed that it wasn't the show-stopper I was anticipating. And I followed the recipe to the letter!

Just finished making this for Thanksgiving. It is FABULOUS! Had to use dried herbs and decreased the sugar. I am interested in my companies thoughts on this one. Made basic cranberry sauce for the purist.

Rating: 3
I almost changed my mind about using this recipe - the combination was a bit funky - but I'd purchased the ingredients and soldiered on figuring I could always buy a can of Ocean Spray for the "purists". After tasting it, I thought it was wonderful. Those "weird" shallots are absolutely wonderful after caramelizing and certainly enhance the cranberries.

I want ot amke this for Thanksgiving next week but have a question about reducing the amount of port--will I need to add more liquid is there still enough to cook the cranberries? Thanks everyone!

Rating: 4
If I hadn't committed to bringing the dish to a dinner party I may have eaten all by myself. It really is a delicious complement for turkey or pork without being too sweet (as with other reviewers, I too skimped a little on the sugar). Can't wait to make it for Thanksgiving!

Rating: 4
This is the real deal. I made this at Thanksgiving, after Thanksgiving, at Christmas and will be making again soon. I substitute dried cherries for the currants. This is a great condiment for just about everything--I used it for brie en croute, alongside smoked beef brisket, on turkey sandwiches and even with peanut butter. It is a really nice little app served atop cream cheese on a cracker with jalapeno. Fab!

This was a great addition to our Thanksgiving table...I allowed some of the cranberries to stay unpopped which added a nice texture to the sauce. Delicieux!!

Rating: 4
This was absolutely wonderful! It may very well become the new family cranberry sauce recipe! I did cut the shallots into smaller pieces (but watch them closely, they do burn more easily that way, as I soon learned...). I wish I'd read that the sauce was a little too sweet - I might have cut down on the brown sugar; but definately not on the port! The port and the shallots (plus real cranberries instead of canned) make the dish!

"So what's the big deal about shallots? I'll just use onions." Wow. Get the shallots. Licking the bowl is just the start -- I'm having trouble with sharing. What a combo and the shallots absolutely steal the show.

I hate anything with cranberries in it, but oh my gosh, when I made this for my first Thanksgiving feast at my house, I'm not kidding, everyone was licking their plates. I had found the recipe last year in the magazine, but when I tried finding the recipe again this year, I only found the picture of the recipe, I searched my entire house and office for the magazine. Actually, I thought it was from the Martha Stewart Magazine, so thank goodness you type the magazine name, month and year on your pages. Thank you, thank you for the great information provided in your magazine.

This is a great cranberry sauce, however I agree that it needs some tweeking. A little less Port and sugar should make up for it being too sweet.

Rating: 3
This is a fantastic recipe but it does, as other reviewers say, need tinkering. Personally, I cut down on both the shallots (used half) and the port (used 2/3), nixed the marjoram and used only brown sugar (a bit less than called for.) Guests were literally scraping the bowl with their fingers.

This recipe ended up being even better than it sounded! Everyone loved it. The shallots I bought were big so I cut them into smaller pieces than recommended. Also only used 1 cup of port. I thnk these changes made for a slightly more balanced flavor.

My Thanksgiving company was deeply divided about this sauce. The old traditionalists still wanted their canned gel (blah), however the more adventurous loved it. Will cut down a little on the port next time. A keeper.

Rating: 3
While the concept of this recipe is great, I think the cooking time on the shallots can be reduced in order to prevent burning (you could also simply carmelize them in a skillet). This recipe lured me away from the cranberry-pineapple relish that I have been making for years since it debuted in Bon Appetit. I will probably try it again next year.....

Rating: 2
I thought this sauce was really good, just not great. But definitely an improvement over canned sauce and even the recipe on the Ocean Spray bag. It gives me the right direction to go in when making cranberry sauce- roasted shallots and port. But perhaps less port next time so that the flavor doesn't overwhelm the sauce. Definitely a keeper, but needs some tinkering.

Best cranberry sauce I have ever had!! But beware: it won't convert the people who love the gel in the can--- they are hopeless!

Definitely a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner! I was concerned about the shallots, but the melding of the flavors was wonderful. I had to bake the shallots for less time than recommended (my first batch burned). The extra time it took because of the mishap was still worth it. I'll definitely be making this one again.

It's the morning after Thanksgiving and I woke up craving leftovers of this cranberry sauce! Just returned from raiding the fridge and had to review it. Delicious! Is perfect as is, but might also be good using a Tawny Port.

Just finished making this incredible cranberry sauce and I can tell right now, just from sampling, it will be the highlight of the Thanksgiving Dinner Table! I halved the number of shallots since it seemed like such a huge amount while I was chopping them but next time I think I will add all 18. Yummy!!

I was very scared to make anything different and new from this website, but let me tell you for my first thanksgiving meal...It is turning out to be the greatest. I followed the menu list they presented and now i see they took out this side from the list?? IT IS DELECTABLE!

Finally - a cranberry sauce that's not just there because it should be on the Thanksgiving table. Each Thanksgiving, I try a new sauce recipe in an effort to find the one cranberry sauce that people really love. My quest is over: Next year, I'll be making this one again! This is a wonderful combination - the shallots, currants, and port intertwine beautifully.
