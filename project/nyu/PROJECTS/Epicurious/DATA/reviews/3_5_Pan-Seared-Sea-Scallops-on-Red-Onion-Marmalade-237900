I made this tonight with salmon. I put the lemon/Ginger/olive oil on the salmon and let it sit for 30 minutes or so. Roasted it at 425 for about 15 minutes and served it atop the onion marmalade. It was fantastic. I actually like it better with salmon than I did with scallops.

Wonderful recipe! I didn't think the onions overpowered the scallops at all. I did marinate the scallops in the oil, lemon and ginger while I made the marmalade because I didn't want the scallops to sit for 15 while I did the onions. I put a bit of Ginger and lemon in with the onions to compensate for the pan drippings. It was terrific.

I guess I'm in the minority here...I didn't think the marmalade overpowered the scallops at all. I thought the dish was fantastic, a great, elegant dinner party dish. I'm sure the quality of the scallops has allot to do with the outcome.

This turned out wonderfully; I will say that I substituted vidalia onions for the red onions, and they were mild enough to enhance the scallops without overpowering them. Yummy!

Thumbs up, but I agree the onions do over power the scallops. Next time I'll halve the onion marmalade and serve a very thin bed of it under the scallops.

The red onion marmalade was wonderful, but the scallops didn't hold up to it. Not sure if the scallops I used just didn't have enough flavor. Bay scallops might have been better or steak. Will definitely make the marmalade again.

A good recipe but be carefull with the marmalade as it can be too dominante. Suggest less reduction and smaller amount drizzled over the scallops on a small bed if rice

The scallops and marmalade were independently good, but the marmalade dominated the scallops. The onion marmalade would be better for pork.

Make sure scallops are as dry as possible before you sautee them...Also, you can use beef stock, chicken stock, or veg. stock in place of the red wine -- We use white wine and veg stock
