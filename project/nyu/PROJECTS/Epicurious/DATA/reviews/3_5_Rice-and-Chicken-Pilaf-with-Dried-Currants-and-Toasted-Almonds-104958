Very good considering the simplicity. I left the thighs in bigger pieces(used 1.4 #s), browned yellow & red pepper(for flavor & color), added golden raisins & toasted slivered almonds at the end. Very good. Will definitely make again. I used Trader Joe's low sodium chicken broth concentrate(packets). It needs more spice though, maybe add curry powder next time and or a touch of mango chutney. Maybe someone else has spice ideas?

Wonderful, easy, flavorful! I added the thyme and lemon zest & leftover flour mixture also. The chicken was singing!

Quick, easy, delicious! The best part is with a freezer stocked with chicken, this is made with pantry-ready items! Perfect for days when a trip to the store just isn't in the schedule.

Even with a 5yr old and toddler clinging to me this dish is fantastic. I used cranberries instead of currants, and at least 1# of thighs. Has a great flavor, lingers thru the house and kids ate it also. I didn't cut the chicken thighs, chopped onion instead of wedges, cooked it all in a big iron skillet. Served with greens beans saute' w/lemon and butter. Great as a base for more elaborate meal.

Quick and tasty. I substituted dried cranberries for the currants and also added some grated lemon peel. I am going to try this again making an Indian version using curry powder.Should work well.

This was a delicious recipe. I was looking for something moist and fairly bland for my in-laws, and this wound up tasting very good. I chopped the onion finely instead of using wedges.

Surprisingly simple and tasty. It was a bit salty overall so next time I'll make sure to use low-salt broth. I added about 1 cup of shredded zucchini and used chicken breasts instead of thighs. Chicken was amazingly tender. Doesn't make quite as much as I anticipated so I'll increase ingredient amounts and maybe throw in another veggie to the mix next time. Definitely a keeper.

A nice, tasty weekday meal. I used 3 chicken breasts instead of the thighs. I thought it would be very bland but ok for kids, but I was surprised at the flavor. The cinnamon and currants made a nice addition to a simple chicken and rice. But my picky eaters still happily ate it.

I thought this was really fantastic and I was quite surprised because it seemed so simple. It took about 25 minutes to make and it was absolutely delicious. I used pine nuts and raisins instead of currants and almonds and added some fresh parsley and orange juice to the broth. It was mild but not bland, and really satisfying.

This dish was easy and pleasant, though a bit bland. I added chopped candied ginger; next time I also would add salt and pepper. (I used low-sodium chicken broth, as always.) I served it with hot mango chutney, which was a good accompaniment. It also helped the flavor that I sauteed the rice a few minutes before adding broth; next time I might do that longer, to get the rice more toasted. I definitely agree with reviewers favoring currants over raisins. I used strips of boneless skinless chicken breast, not thighs, and the thigh meat would have been tastier. So that the breast meat did not dry out and over cook, I quick-sauteed it in the beginning, then set it aside and added it back a scant 10 minutes before the end. Even my teenaged son noticed that the dish lacked color; I think one reviewer's suggestion about adding a handful of frozen peas is a good idea.

Really good, but a little too "cinnamonee". Will add only 1 stick of cinnamon, and will take out of pan sooner next time.

I thought I was probably going too far afield making this recipe with bone-in chicken thighs, regular long-grain white rice and dried cherries, but it was still quite good. Family members were arguing over seconds! Who'd have thought it?

Made this for a dinner party, everyone loved it. Used regular rice, ground cinnamon, and forgot the chicken stock, so I used water. Still delish!

Very Good. Changes: Used small stockpot instead of skillet. Used two garlic cloves. Used brown rice instead of basmati. Used two chicken breasts instead of thighs. Perhaps because of the longer time in cooking the brown rice (I added about 15 minutes to the simmering time) I did not find this recipe too wet, as some other people did. Next time I might add more currants, and another chicken breast. This seems like an easy recipe to personalize.

This was a nice sweet chicken dish for a weeknight. Next time I'll use less broth as it didn't fully reduce and came out too wet.

I loved this recipe once I tweaked it. Its creamy like risotto but a lot less work. I increased the amount of currants from 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup, the garlic from 1 clove to 2 cloves, and the chicken from 12 oz to 1 lb and chopped the chicken into bite size pieces. I chopped the onions. I added 1 cup frozen peas after cooking the pilaf for 14 minutes (giving the peas 6 minutes to cook) I substituted toasted chopped walnuts for the almonds.

yummy--a good main dish, but a little too busy as an accompaniment. remembering another pilaf recipe, i used basmati rice on-hand (& decreased broth by 1/3) and added a 1/2-inch chunk of fresh ginger, diced fine. guests commented on the flavors of the ginger & cinnamon. i'd definitely opt for currants over raisins, if available. very good & easy for a group!

This is an excellent recipe as it tastes great and requires very little effort. Instead of currants, I used raisins (twice the recommended amount) and I also marinated the chicken with 1 tsp of sesame oil. Before serving, I garnished the dish with thinly chopped scallions.

I really enjoyed this dish. As a beginning cook, I was won over by the fact that it's both easy *and* delicious. I didn't think it was lacking in anything, although I did add extra currants and almonds and was pleased with the results. I will definitely make this again and share the recipe with friends.

I changed quite a bit in this recipe for lack of time. First I used leftover cooked leg of lamb - sauteed it with the onion, oil and garlic - thru in uncooked rice, carrot, dried prunes (didn't have dried apricots) and 4 cups of water, along with canned tomato puree and the spices recommended by the Washington DC cook (thanks!). Came out pretty good but not memorable. But it is not a fair review of the recipe since I changed so much!

This recipe didn't seem very low-fat but in reality, it made about 6 servings not 4, which made the numbers better. I added sugar snap peas to make it a complete meal.

I omitted the chicken to make this as a sidedish, used raisins, and more of them, instead of currants, lots more almonds, and fresh cilantro stirred in at the end. I thought it was really flavorful, and my starch-hating husband had seconds and remarked that it was one of his favorite rice dishes.

The flavors are nice, and it's easy to pull together on a weeknight with on-hand ingredients, but it's boring as all getout. Next time I'll garnish with chopped scallions, shredded coconut, sliced sweet red pepper, and chutney or onion relish in addition to the almonds. It lacks pizzazz and it's so close to wonderful!
