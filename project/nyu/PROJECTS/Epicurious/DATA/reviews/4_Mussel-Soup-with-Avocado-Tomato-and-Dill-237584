I made this for my family, and we thought it was excellent as is, but the next time I make it I'm putting in some roasted sweet corn :)

Very clean flavors, and very delicious. Was a welcome change of pace compared to other things I often cook (Thai, Indian curries, pasta). I didn't have lager/pils on hand so used Sierra Nevada pale ale, and it worked for me. Served with arugula salad and sliced rye bread. 3.5 stars!

I really wanted to like this recipe but it just didn't do anything for me or my husband.

To the cook from Philadelphia, sadly, what the Brits call "single cream" is most comparable to our "heavy cream." What the Brits call "double cream" (aka heaven on a spoon)...we don't got. Sorry, but they have our butts whipped from here to Sunday when it comes to dairy products.

Tried this recipe with New Zealand greenshell mussels, and it was fabulous! We left the shells on, which really added to the presentation. Diced vine ripened tomatoes also work well in place of the grape/pear tomatoes.

This soup is amazing! The broth on its own is delicious, but combined with the avocado/tomato/dill mixture, it's just genius. I'd make this for company, and I wouldn't change a thing.

Really delicious and unusual. I made the recipe as written except I did not pour the soup through a sieve. I saw no reason to discard all the tasty leek other than aesthetics (the mussels were very clean). Served it with a baguette.

budweiser is a lager, however... I'd sooner drink p... pilsner is the way to go I added saute'd sweet onions just till slightly brown... emphasis on slightly! No leeks to be found and used chopped chives just at the end. Added my own home grown diced and seeded plum tomatoes with my own tsp tomato paste. It gave a richer taste and made the soup less watery. Used heavy cream to finish the soup with an additional pat of creamy Irish butter. For those of you in the UK, see everyting you wanted to know about milk... http://www.foodsubs.com/Dairyoth.html Would I make it again... you bet... "In a NY minute"

This soup was very good considering I used regular budweiser as that was all we had, and dried herbs since I made it in the dead of winter. My husband was against me making that night, but I was in the mood for soup. He loved it.

Very impressive and I like the cream aspect. I did add a splash of Pernod and it was wonderful.

Half and half is just a mixture of heavy cream and milk, sold as such for coffee in the US.

This site has an excellent food dictionary ~"...Half-and-half is a mixture of equal parts milk and cream, and is 10 to 12 percent milk fat..." I haven't made this recipe yet but anything with mussels ( from PEI of course) deserves three forks without even trying!

To the cook below from the UK - half and half is simply light cream.

For the previous reader, half-and-half is a mixture of equal parts milk and cream, and is 10 to 12 percent milk fat. I have not tried this soup yet, but it sounds good

To the UK reviewer: yes, half and half is what we in the states call a mixture of equal parts full-fat milk and heavy cream.

you are correct that "Half and Half" is 50% whole milk and 50% cream. From what I remember of my days in London, this is sold as "single cream" in the UK. I haven'te tried this yet, either, but it does look good.

I am not sure what half and half refers to. It could be milk and cream, but it could be many other things. Hopefully not the half-and-half mixture of linseed oil and turpentine that www.thefreedictionary.com refers to! I have not tried this yet but it looks tempting.
