Excellent and easy salad to prepare with the freshest and most delicious melons of the season. The dressing is exceptional coupled with the pepper zing of the watercress and the crunch of the almonds. Great salad to serve with asian or indian type cuisine!

The cantaloupe I bought was bad so I used only watermelon, but this salad still turned out nicely. Be sure to drain the watermelon chunks before adding them to the greens, or you risk making things soggy.

Great salad. Almonds are the perfect final touch. I will make this all summer long.

Years ago I started making salads with "cantaloupe croutons" in the summer -- juicy ripe squares of melon in my salad -- and I'd forgotten about it...this recipe takes it to a whole other level. The dressing is great, the almonds sublime -- but clearly the spicy/sweet combination of watercress and melon makes this the perfect summer salad for a buffet. My VIP clients loved it. Be sure and dress the greens first, before adding the melon if you're going to serve it on a platter -- but don't just layer it or guests may not "get it" -- you need to really toss all ingredients together -- just don't forget to add extra almonds on top -- and taste! This is one fruit salad where salt is definitely a secret ingredient.

When I saw this recipe I remembered how my aunt and father used to put pepper on cantelope, it's a good combination. So the peppery watercress with the melon is good. A very refreshing salad, yum. The toasted almonds add a nice touch. Don't faint but I actually made it as written, no substitutions or additions...:)
