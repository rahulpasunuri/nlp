I use skinless boneless chicken for the veal and non fat 1/2&1/2 for the cream. I have made it with regular 1/2&1/2 and we prefer the lighter taste of the non fat version and we don't miss the calories. Also have made it with the porcini's & mixed dried mushrooms both are great. Sauce is also wonderful on fish, lay a bed of steamed spinach with a piece of broiled halibut with the sauce you won't be disappointed.

Great flavor and easy to make. I ground up dried porcini and that worked out perfectly - do not skip! Next time I will use half & half and do 2 parts half & half to 1 part Madeira. I didn't think the Madeira flavor was strong enough. After adding back the veal to the pan the sauce got too thick so I think the half & half will help with that and the calories.

We had this dish in a local restaurant and my wife loved it, so she asked me to try to make it. It was good, except that next time, I would omit the cream. I don't think the restaurant used a cream sauce. I would thicken the sauce with bread crumbs or corn starch. Also, I couldn't find porcini powder in my supermarket, so I used dried mushrooms instead. I don't know what difference that made. I will try it again without the cream, though.

I substituted chicken breast for the veal and thought this dish to be wonderful!
