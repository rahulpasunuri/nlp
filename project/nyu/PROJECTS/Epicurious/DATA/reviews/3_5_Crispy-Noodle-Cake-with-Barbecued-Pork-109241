Very good. I omitted the ginger and used chinese rice noodles instead of egg noodles and it turned out great. Next time, I would add more soy sauce to the sauce.

I don't know what I did wrong, but I couldn't get the cake to work. It kept falling apart. I had better luck making smaller cakes, but in the end it wasn't worth the time and effort.

Pretty dull and tasteless.

Great flavors in this dish, with one modification: I added chili oil to the cornstarch mixture for some added kick. I thought the dish tasted great without the added step, and additional oil, of frying the noodle cake.

I made this with leftover pork and it was wonderful. Even my mom and dad, who can be very picky eaters at times, loved it. The only drawback to this recipe is the amount of bowls and pans I used while making it. I agree with the previous reviewers, a large, nonstick pan is a must for this recipe.

This was delicious and everyone enjoyed it. It is messy, but gets easier with practice. A non-stick pan is critical to get it flipped over. Invert it onto a plate and then slide it back into the pan to brown the other side. And skip the BBQ pork. Not worth the effort

The first time I made this as written. I didn't find the barbequed pork added a lot and it was a nuisance to get so now I use left over chicken or pork or even leave it out. One of our favourite meals-never enough to make everyone happy(3-4 people)and have some left for hubby's lunch the next day.

This had good flavor, fun to try once. But it was a lot of preparation and made a mess of the food and the stove to make one big cake and flip it--tried both nonstick and cast iron. I had better luck making small individual pancakes.

Great weeknight recipe! I used leftover angel hair and take-out Chinese BBQ pork. Forgot the bean sprouts but will definitely use them next time.
