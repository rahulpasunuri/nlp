My family loves this recipe. It's got a nice flavor, and goes along with a salad great. We use it as a summer dish when it's too hot to eat really heavy, and as I'm not that familiar with Middle Eastern cooking, to be honest I don't serve Middle Eastern side dishes with it, but I do make it exactly as the recipe is written and it's really delicious. It's my 3 year old son's favorite meal, and he's a pretty picky eater, so that always gets high marks from me. Although I think if I served everything on a skewer, it might make mealtime more interesting to him. ;-)

I made this recipe, but kicked it up a little bit by using lime juice instead of lemon juice, skipping the tumeric, and adding fresh cilantro instead. I added salt and pepper to the marinade as well. I popped some bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms onto the skewers with the chicken and cooked on a grill pan in the kitchen. My dinner guests *loved* them!

To the reviewer who thought it was bland: it is, but this dish is best served with onions, tomatoes, and a yogurt sauce with pita bread. It brings the flavors together nicely; the recipe misses out on this bit of info.

This had a very plain, bland taste. Not going to make this dish again.
