These were delicious. I also love this recipe for wonton wrapper tortellini: http://applepiefromscratch105.wordpress.com/2012/03/19/wonton-wrapper-tortellini/

This was good and relatively simple. I'd never have guessed that peas and mint could taste so good. We followed the suggestions in reviews and added some goat cheese and lemon zest to the mixture; fried the wontons instead of boiling. Paired with some rice and veggies, it was a good meal.

I made these a couple times following orig recipe + they were great. This time I added about 1/3 c toasted ground hazelnuts and about 2 oz goat cheese, and put more filling into less wrappers... and it was really excellent.

Very, very good. I used nasoya wonton wrappers, which say "good for ravioli" on the package. I used one wrapper folded into triangles, and cut down the butter for a mix of olive oil and butter. Boiled gently, and while I did have some issues with sticking they were very delicious overall. Perfect w/ an heirloom tomato salad for a late-summer dinner.

I actually made these ravioli's as gyoza instead! I preheated my oven to 375 degrees F. Sprayed a pan with non-stick spray, lined them all on the pan, sprayed the top of them with non-stick and baked them for 8 minutes. They were great! crispy on the edges without all the grease! next time I make them I will add less salt and pepper though. They were too over seasoned for my taste.

I had leftover wonton wrappers and thought this recipe would be perfect. I made a batch of these and a batch with pumpkin puree and ricotta. I am not a fan of the gummy wonton flavor and will try frying them instead. It was a good way to use leftover wrappers but I probably wouldn't seek this out in the future.

Double the mint in order to allow the mint flavor to come through. I made it once using two wrappers per ravioli, but didn't like all the excess wonton wrapper. It's much better using just one wrapper. I drizzeld white truffle oil on top and sprinkled with grated parmiggiano, salt, and cracked pepper. Simple and delicious.

These were DELICIOUS. We cut egg roll wrappers into quarters, put about a teaspoon of filling in the center, moistened the edges, and pinched up the ends around the filling. To avoid the sticking mentioned by others, I removed them from the pot to a plate and drizzled a little olive oil over every layer of dumplings. We served this with pan-seared asparagus tossed with olive oil and lemon zest. It was light, elegant, springy, and fun! Definitely keeping this one in my recipe file.

I made the ravioli then changed the shape around my small finger joining the two ends to make a tortellini shape. The I deep fried them and served them with natural yoghurt under them, parmesan sprinkled over them, with fresh chopped mint garnish. Result was wonderful, easy to eat as a passing snack at a party and also as an unusual and appetiser. have already made them twice in two weeks. This is a winner

Made this a few weeks ago. It was fast easy and really tasty! I took a few peoples suggestions and added lemon and tomatoes to the butter which made an excellent sauce. They really stuck together so next time I would add oil to the water. Will make again soon!

I've made the very similar pea ravioli in lemon broth recipe on this site, and I'd recommend following those instructions for assembling the ravioli. That recipe calls for one wrapper, rather than two, for each tsp of filling. You fold the wrapper into a triangle, then fold over the corners and attach to make a little hat. That way you get a much better wrapper to filling ratio.

This sounds great, but has anyone tried frying this in some oil and making it into a dumpling instead of a Ravioli? Think I'll give it a try this weekend... maybe with a Tzatziki dipping sauce??

the pea mixture is yummy and easy enough to make. however i found the wonton wrappers gummy when boiled and not so delicious to eat. as i didn't soak them in butter immediately after boiling, a lot stuck together and were unusable (for the party i'm bringing them to, for snacking they're fine). i fried the ravioli in butter and that helped make them less sticky and more delicious.

YUM! First time using wonton wrappers and it won't be the last. Easy and very fancy looking -- I agree that perhaps a little trimming (maybe after cooking) would help. Also agree that much less butter than is called for works. The olive oil idea sounds good, too. Maybe next time.

This is a great and easy recipe. I used fresh peas instead of frozen, and left out the mint. Instead of just drizzling with butter, I made a sage and brown butter sauce. Very delicious and a big hit!

This was soo good and so easy to make. Very spring-like. Made it as a first course for a party and it was a huge hit.

Excellent! Very easy to make. I served with drizzled olive oil, grated parm and peppercorns.

I love the pea and mint combination, but I was a bit nervous about using the wonton wrappers. Easy! They didn't fall apart on me and were quite delicious. I added some lemon zest before serving and it really brightened the flavor. I'd really recommend this addition. The dish was pretty rich and filling. Three ravioli per person would make wonderful and impressive starter when entertaining.

Better than I had even imagined. I loved the picture in my Gourmet magazine the instant I opened it. This is, without question, one of the easiest recipes I have ever prepared, and is absolutely DELISH. The mint lends such a delicate and complex flavor to the peas. Don't need so much butter, though, and I'm going to try it with olive oil drizzled over it. Definitely a winner.

These were great! They were very easy to make and quick, even for this slow cook (my first time using wontons or making ravioli). They didn't split open while cooking as I was afraid they would. I was surprised at all the butter recommended for serving and only used a small amount myself, but I think it's (1) to keep the ravioli from sticking together, and (2) to balance out all of that extra dough around the filling. I found myself trimming it away while eating them -- it was a little too much. If I were to make them again I'd try trimming them just a bit -- but not too much or they'll split open during cooking.

This filling was super and easy to make and quite delicious. Check out my results on my foodblog: http://foodskop.wordpress.com

The filling for this recipe was very easy to make, if you cook the peas enough, you probably can just mash them thoroughly with a fork if you don't feel like cleaning the food processor!
