Great recipe and easy to modify. I'm really taken with replacing the spinach and celery with baby bok choy. Even my hubby gives his stamp of approval.

This is really, really good. I added a bit of hot sauce for a kick. This will become one my standard take-to-work-lunch dishes.

Rosemary is a flavorful alternative for this recipe which I prefer--I saw a similar Italian bean soup using rosemary so decided to substitute after trying with thyme. This is differently delicious soup/stew (depending on the amount of broth you use). I used shredded poached chicken breasts, onions, regular ungutted tomatoes I had on hand, cannellini beans, omitted the bacon. To make it even easier due to feeling under the weather, I added the spinach and extra garlish directly to the soup. I also quartered the roasted tomato halves and added to soup which added more flavor to the broth. I don't find this soup/stew too hearty to be served as a summer meal.

This recipe is truly amazing. Super flavorful, good for you, and seriously, so worth repeating again and again. I cook a lot, and I make a lot of stews , but this one really ranks high in my books. Enjoy!

Made this for company last night, followed recipe except cut in half for four people. Everyone raved, it was a delicious hearty winter meal. Served with green salad and garlic ciabatta bread. We loved the spinach and the roasted tomatoes, this would be a good dish at Christmas time because of the color. Don't forget the shallot/garlic topping, it adds a punch of flavor, also, I might add a little more bacon (trimming fat off) next time.

Outstanding recipe! Modified just ever so slightly by pureeing tomatoes after roasting and adding to stew...just fantastic!

Only 2 forks before changes. I made it according to the recipe - except for roasting the tomatoes for over an hour. Two forks. When putting away the leftovers, I deglazed the baking sheet with 2 Tbsp red wine vinegar and added that plus 3 Tbsp tomato paste and all the remaining ingredients to the soup. That combo rates 3 forks - VERY good but not exceptional. Next time I will use all the alliums at the beginning and add the spinach directly to the soup. Fewer pans to clean, although not as pretty!

We did not enjoy this dish very much. It was a lot of work for not a lot of taste. It was very bland and a consistency of a soup vs. a stew.

This is soooo good. I've made it twice with a few substitutions: boneless chicken breasts stewed in broth, beet greens instead of spinach, onions instead of shallots, vegetable broth, cannelini beans, regular bacon, grape tomatoes. The roasted tomatoes are the best part - don't leave them out! Leftovers are wonderful. The only downside - lots of dirty dishes!

A very satisfying, simple and delicious soup for a cold winter day. The bacon adds a lot of flavor to the very healthy ingrediants. There are a lot of variations possible.

The only reason I give this recipe three foks and not four is because I made several changes, so I have no idea how the original tastes, but my version was great!! First of all, I didn't process the tomatoes as indicated; I just diced them and threw them in at the same time as the chicken. Second, I poured off almost all of the bacon grease before adding the onions and garlic. It would be way too fatty if you didn't. Also, I used leftover ("in-organic") chicken thighs, which I find much more flavorful than breasts. After the chicken addition I let the mixture cool, then packaged it up and put in the fridge for the coming week. Mid-week I thawed it out, heated it up, and as it bubbled, I threw chopped green chard, instead of spinach, on top and let it wilt, then spooned it out into bowls for a delicious, hearty winter mid-week dinner that took about 10 minutes to make! I will absolutely make this again!!
