The lentils have nothing to do with this recipe. They do not appear in the recipe in the magazine issue.

This recipe was just OKAY. Definitely didn't knock my socks off. As A Cook From San Diego mentioned, there are too many fantastic recipes out there to make this one again... especially involving quality (not to mention expensive!) ahi tuna.

This recipe is so delicious and so easy.... but.. cook the ahi in a hot pan (high heat) - kiss the steak on all sides for about 10-20 seconds per side (depending on size of steak). The ahi should be ruby red in the center for serving. The wonderful vinaigrette is also delicious on bruschetta if you have any leftovers. Will definitely make this again, and again, and again...

I wish I had read these comments before I made this....10 minutes on medium heat produces an opaque-white, over-cooked tuna steak....not the ruby-red jewel pictured with the recipe! Ugh! I guess I'd make this again, in the sense that I'd sear a tuna steak and put an olive sauce with it, but I wouldn't follow the cooking directions.

Folks, just look at the picture, does it look like it was cooked 10 minutes?

I hate to be voice of dissent, but I did not really care for this recipe, even though I love all ingredients called for. I used sushi grade ahi, but this did not do it for me. It was easy.....but I will not make again. There are too many other recipes out there.

Easy, quick and delicious. To sear the tuna do not grill or saute for more than 2 minutes per side. I served this as a main course.

Do not cook your Tuna for 10 minutes. If you do that you might as well just crack open a can of Starkist and dump that on your plate. Find a nice piece of sashimi grade Ahi and just kiss that hot pan with it. I'm not sure why this site put that as the cook time, but any Chef worth their weight in salt would never abuse a lovely peice of tuna like that. The vinegarette is simple and a pleasant counterpoint to the rich meaty tuna. Didn't do the lentils, hope I didn't miss anything.

It was excellent. Served it on a bed of garlic mashed potatoes with a side of grilled asparagus.

I've served this twice but put black olive tampenade around hot yellow fin tuna (rare). There is a box mix of coucous and lentils together which I served with it. Great!

Wonderful recipe! A keeper for sure and I even hate black olives. Must try.

Fresh Ahi, cracked pepper, pinch of salt and just kissed by a screeching hot pan. I served this recipe nearly sashimi style and got raves. The leftover dressing incorporates nicely into bruschette or over mixed greens/blanched asparagras. Yum

Judy, The lentils would generally act as the backdrop or bed for the tuna. But olive tampenade and lentils? Hmm. It makes my mouth pucker. You could skip the lentils and maybe serve the tuna slices surrounded by some nicely flavored couscous. That seems like a likelier pairing than lentils. Just a thought.

Could you tell me where the Frenh green lentils go in the recipe? Beneath the Tuna or on top with the chives? Thanks.

This recipe was great! And note to Henry...think you definately got bad fish but don't let it put you off! I once had some bad squid that made be sick for 3 days but I love fried calamari and am simply more cautious about my seafood purveyor. Give it another try my good man!
