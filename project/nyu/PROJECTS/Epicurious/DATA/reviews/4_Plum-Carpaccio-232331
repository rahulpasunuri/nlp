Thank you Epicurious! I was looking for a way to use 5 ripe plums that had been languishing in my fridge and did not feel like making a cobbler or baking anything. This recipe sounds weird with the rosemary, but it is excellent, tastes great, and very upscale (at least the taste I took while it was marinating). I didn;t have plum brandy/grappa, but threw in some Kirsch and can't wait to try it tonight!! Thanks again

Very quick and simple -- I just used a standard mandolin to slice the plums but I have to admit they looked lovely. My main issue was trying to serve them, the plums are so soft after two hours (actually, after 10 minutes!) that moving them was difficult. I'd be tempted to slice the plums onto the dessert plates and put the boiling syrup on shortly before serving.
