What a disappointment. The amount of butter in this recipe is disgusting - I felt sick after eating this. Yes, the parchment is an interesting presentation, but I think the mushrooms would taste much better just sauteed in a pan.

My family doesn't like the flavor of tarragon so we omit that, but we do add some pearl onions
