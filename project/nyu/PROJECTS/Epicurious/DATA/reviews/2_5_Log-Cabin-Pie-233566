My pie did not set either. I used grade A syrup instead of the "preferable" grade B but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, not that this was a particularly complicated recipe. The top got very crusty but the inside was totally runny.

Would not set - something probably missing from published recipe

Yum! As a Vermonter, this is a natural for me! However, I intend to try walnuts next time, to create a Maple Walnut Pie! If I can ever get around to cracking all those Butternuts I have, I'll wager they'd be darned good too!

This is the best and easiest no fail pecan pie recipe out there. I make it every year for holidays.
