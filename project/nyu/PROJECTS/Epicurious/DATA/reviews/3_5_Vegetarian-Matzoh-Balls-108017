This is my go-to recipe for Matzoh balls. I usually lose the vegetarian attribute by using schmaltz for the extra flavor, but these have just the right texture in between fluffy and cannonball.

This was the first time I strayed from the recipe on the back on the Streit's Matzoh Meal box--and I wasn't disappointed. I made these for our second night seder, and while I wasn't crazy about the texture (which I think was due to an error on my part with the eggs, not because of the recipe), I thought the flavor was really good. I cooked them in water with Osem "Chicken-style" Parve instant soup/seasoning mix added, and served them in a broth I'd made using carrots, celery, onions, garlic & parsley (in the end I added some of the Osem to that as well...it just didn't have enough flavor on its own).

I have made these many times, and they are perfect. Does anyone have a recipe for a great vegetable broth that you can serve with them (instead of chicken broth)?

I have never made matzoh balls I don't like--fluffers, sinkers, with baking soda or seltzer, whole wheat matzoh--until now. This version is truly terrible. Spongy (not soft) and lacks the flavor and texture of Matzoh balls. Not meaty at all. Whipping the egg whites is a bad idea. Hope this will serve to warn others, especially given Epecurious's ringing endorsement.

Wow were these good! And surprisingly easy. This was my first time cooking matzah balls and I was a little nervous, but they came out great!

Made an 8x batch for a large group. Cooked them in the vegetable broth a day in advance and added them to soup next day. Very popular amongst group of 70 adults....light, "meaty" and flavorful....

Lidlestarz, to make this pareve, use pareve smart balance (the kind with 67% fat, not 33%) or some other pareve margerine. It will be fine.

I made these last year for Passover and everyone said they were the best matzoh balls they had ever had. I definitely want to make these again this year, but I am attending a Pareve Seder and I can't use butter. Any tips on using oil in this recipe instead? Also, I'd like to make them the day before the Seder. Any storage tips?

Made this for my boyfriend who has tried every matzoh ball under the sun. He said these were by far his favorite. They came out perfectly light and fluffy, but held together well. I might up the salt and cayenne seasoning a bit...

I make these matzoh balls every year for Passover and I always get rave reviews. Unless you are cooking for a very small crowd, I suggest doubling the recipe.

This was very simple and VERY GOOD! If you like large matzoh balls, double this recipe as it only makes 8 or 9 large balls.

Matzah meal is basically matzah that has been pulverized to a bread-crumb-like consistency. Usually people buy it pre-packaged but I've made it myself when I've run out by pulverizing matzah or matzah farfel in my food processor. (Matzah farfel is matzah in a pebble-size, which is more appropriate for stuffings or casseroles.) Does this help?

Sorry this is not really a review but a question. What is Matzoh Meal? I know what Matzoh balls are but matzoh meal? I'm really excited to make chicken soup with matzoh balls so .... HELP!

Made last nite for my first seder to rave reviews for light, floating matzoh balls. I made the mixture the nite before. Double the receipe made 19. Perfect for my vegetarian and meat-eating dinner guests

These were some of the lightest matzoh balls I have ever had. But held up well in the broth. Well done!

These were the best matzah balls I've ever made--I'm delighted to have finally found the right recipe. I made a nice vegetable soup with a garlic peppercorn broth, carrots, asparagus, celery and onions--which tasted great with these. I also found that the recipe only made about 13 or so matzoh balls.

Made this for Passover and it was a huge hit! Light and fluffy. Cooked half of it in chicken broth for the meat eaters and the other half in vegie broth. Either way they were great. Only thing I hade to change was the amount--I only got 10 matzoh balls out of this recipe so I had to go back and double it.

This was my first attempt at Jewish cusine, which I made for a dinner party during Passover for some friends who were observing. I thought the stock was fantastic and the matzoh balls were flavorful and very moist. We served with crushed matzoh in the soup. I will definately make again, regardless of the time of year.

To Lisa in New Port Richie: if your husband's family keeps kosher, don't serve these to them in a meat broth or if any meat will be on the table. Butter is dairy, and dairy can't be served with meat.

To the Cook from Bloomington, although it has been awhile since you posted your message, in the hope that you do one day return, I would just like to say that there is no one singular Jewish way of cooking. There is Sephardic, Ashkenazi, wealthy, and not. So none of "us" can tell you what type of stock to use, as I would imagine we all have our own views on the matter. To the recipe itself, it is lovely and goes well with a mushroom stock, mine homemade.

My first attempt at matzoh balls, they turned out very light and fluffy. I used green onions, as that is what I had on hand. Later I discovered a recipe elsewhere on this site for green onion-dill matzo balls which looks interesting and is a little less involved. I might try that one next time.

I know that I am a little early for menu planning for next year's Passover Seder, but I am a Quaker preparing a traditional dinner for my husband's Jewish family. I tried these, and they were very good. Best of all, they did not fall apart like the first recipe that I tried. I ended up with Matzoh crumb soup! I also plan to serve a Capon (kosher, of course). Does anybody have any ideas what else I could serve? I'd like to please my in-laws. Thanks.

Amazing. Light and fluffy. I doubled the amount of onions, but still could not taste them. I cooked the matzo balls over 9 cups of chicken broth. I did not serve them in the chicken broth.

I am a non-jew but am very interested in Jewish cooking. I would like some cookbook recommendations. Can I buy chicken fat in the grocery? Do you use homemade vegetable stock or do you use store bought? Thank you for any help you can give.

I think beating the whites ahead of time really made the difference. I used this as my basis and put the pinch of cinnamon and clove in the center, the way my family prefers for a bit of sweet in the soup. Just wonderful!

These came out perfect and delicious. I, too, doubled the onion and cooked the matzoh balls in chicken broth.

These matzoh balls were excellent! Everyone at our seder raved about these flavorful matzoh balls. I cooked them in chicken broth and used a dash of tabasco instead of cayenne. Great taste. This recipe is a keeper!

Great, easy matzoh balls. I boiled them in chicken stock, which gave them a lovely color and a richer flavor. More onion, and a bit more cayenne would be better.
