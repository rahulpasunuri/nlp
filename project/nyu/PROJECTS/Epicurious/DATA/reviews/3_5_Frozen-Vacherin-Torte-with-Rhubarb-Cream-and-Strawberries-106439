I'm not as impressed as the others who have tried it. A few changes to suggest depending on your ingredients.... The cream was incredibly soft so I would not add any water to the fruit compote and in fact reduce it before chilling. Perhaps my rhubarb had a higher water content? I didn't have a spring form so made an aluminum foil collar which seems to have worked satisfactorily. Flavors are all good, the assembled piece isn't great!

I've made this recipe several times and always get rave reviews!! It's definitely one of my spring dessert 'regulars'. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a fantastic, fresh springtime dessert!!

I substituted ripe peaches (3 cups) for the rhubarb, strawberries and water. Superb! A definite keeper, especially if you like peach ice cream. I also didn't bother to pipe the meringue, but did need to go to a 10" springform pan due to spreading.

I really liked this dessert, however not everyone in my family did, which surprised me. I found this to be very light, delicious and pretty. I didn't take the time to pipe the meringue, just gently spread it evenly.

First, it feeds at least 12! Excellent really, although in the freezing process it deflates somewhat. And you need to keep it cold - it melts fast!
