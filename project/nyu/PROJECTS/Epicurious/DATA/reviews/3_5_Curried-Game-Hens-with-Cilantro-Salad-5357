This is an outstanding preparation for cornish hens. Simple to make and delicious.

I only made the curry sauce, and while it was spicy, in terms of flavor it was bland. Waste of time, don't bother. I've tasted many curries, and this one was sub-par to say the least.

Delicious and juicy bird! Great for dinner parties - since it is so easy to make, and most of work is done day ahead! Start with the Roasted Red Peppers stuffed with Feta and it's a staple dinner party menu!
