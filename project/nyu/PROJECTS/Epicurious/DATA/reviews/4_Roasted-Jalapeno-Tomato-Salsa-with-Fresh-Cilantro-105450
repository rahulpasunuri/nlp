Honestly kind of lacking in depth. I roasted everything together as suggested in previous reviews, left skins on, and didn't even add the water, but the final product was just, well, blah. Jalapeños were flavorful enough and tomatoes were great. Throwing together canned diced tomatoes and fresh peppers of various sorts is actually easier and had more flavor. Will stick with my old recipe.

This recipe has a lot of flavor. I roasted the onions and garlic along with the tomatoes and jalapenos. I like it spicy so I had a few more jalapenos in it and did not add any water since my paste tomatoes had enough juice coming straight out of my garden. Now I need to can the salsa :)

This is a very tasty salsa, but too soupy for my taste. My husband liked it a lot, but I think the next time I will NOT include the juices from the tomatoes just the tomatoes themselves when I puree it for a chunkier texture.

Good flavor, but nothing extraordinary. I used tomatoes from the garden, de-seeded 2 of the 3 peppers and it was still very spicy - too spicy. The texture was way too watery, like soup almost. I didn't even add the water. Disappointed. I won't make it again.

As in previous reviews, I throw everything onto one baking sheet and place it 4 inches below the broiler. I also replace one of the jalapenos for a serrano, for an extra kick. It's important to use plum tomatoes--I tried this with romas and the texture was completely off.

I roast everything for this salsa, the tomatoes, peppers, onions, and garlic. I do it on my grill with some mesquite chips to give the ingredients a nice smokey flavor. A double batch lasts about a day and a half around my house. Absolutely fabulous!

this recipe is very good but instead of roasting the jalapenos, tomatoes,and onions,and garlic we grilled them. after that we followed the recipe egg-zactly! and when we got to the cilantro part we added some things. We added about 1/4 cup of fine chopped raw onion, 1/4 cup of fine chopped cucumber, 1/4 cup of fine chopped celery. And about a tsp. of lime juice and then we added 2 tsp. of lemon juice. After we added all of those things we added some pampered chef southwestern seasoning mix to give it spice. Stir that all together and it is DELICIOUS!!!

It was a hit. I used 3 jalapenos, which was a bit spicy for me, but my husband loved it. He and a friend devoured it in one sitting.

Most excellent salsa recipe. My keeper forever. I prepared the jalapenos, onions, and garlic called for in the recipe, but ended up using only 1/2 the pureed mixture in the final product, and it was still too spicy for some. I thought it was perfect, but I love spice. I used the remaining part of the mixture to make another batch a week or two later. It saved great in the fridge! Also, I omitted the cilantro, since I hate it. Still a lovely salsa.

I loved this salsa. I loved to rustic texture. It was bursting with flavor. I only gave it 3 forks because my husband didnt care for the roasted taste of this salsa.

this salsa is AWESOME and has great flavor! i streamlined the roasting a bit by putting all the veggies on the baking sheet at once. just watch it and pull off the vegetables as they char. you can go ultra hot with 1 habanero instead of jalapenos. i've made this several times and haven't needed to add water. you can make it chunky by coarsely chopping some of the roasted veggies and stirring it into the salsa after blending/processing. no more store bought salsas for us anymore.

Excellent flavor. I kicked up the heat by adding an additional jalapeno or two. I substitute lime juice for the water. It added another dimension to the flavor.

This recipe has the perfect kick and it's a little bit sweet at the same time. That garlic flavor is just enough. Very fresh, perfect salsa. I only added a little bit more pepper to make it even more spicy.

Excellent recipe! So far i've made it twice and I think I'll always want to have it on hand. The only thing i did differently was leave out the water and add a little bit of fresh lime juice. I'm addicted! My friends love it too!

This is the best salsa ever and I have been trying to find the perfect recipe for years! We like our salsa hot and used four jalapenos. Delicious! I canned a bunch last weekend to tide me over the winter months when we do not have fresh tomatoes

Fantastic salsa. Wonderful smokey and subtle garlic flavor. I only used one jalapeno pepper to make it on the mild side.

This is the best salsa I've ever tasted or made. I originally made it for the "salsa baked goat cheese" appetizer recipe on this site, which was a huge hit at a party. The salsa takes a bit longer than some because of the roasting, but that is what brings out the rich and complex flavors and it is well worth the effort. I will make this often and can't wait to try on grilled chicken or fish. Definitely a keeper!

Wow! After having made this, I now understand what all the rave reviews are about! This salsa really is delicious, and addictive. It's great as is or can be played around with: I have made it with increased garlic and onion, with the addition of roasted red pepper and with tomatillos subbed for some of the tomatoes. I've even subbed lime juice for the cider vinegar. The one thing I never add is the 1/4 cup of water - the salsa is the right consistency without it.

This recipe rocks! I like heat so increased the jalepeno a bit and may up the onlon and garlic a hair the next time, but not much. This is pretty much pure perfection as written.

Best salsa I have ever made (and one of the best I have ever tasted)! I was originally looking for a recipe to mimic Chevy's restaurant salsa -- my favorite ever -- and this is the closest I have ever gotten. I have made at least 15 batches of this over the past 2 years or so. In the summers I put the veggies on my grill outside so I don't heat up the kitchen. It's a little different every time depending on the type of tomatoes I use. I usually add extra garlic and onion as well since the roasting mellows the flavor. I love how spicy it is and like to char the veggies so I have black bits in the salsa. I do not add any water since the tomatoes make it runny enough. It will thicken once you refrigerate it so don't worry if it looks runny at first. I just had to print out another copy of this recipe since I use it a lot and my other one is very ragged.

I love this recipe. Of course, I modified it. Since I cannot have tomatoes I use a base of salsa verde that is made with tomatillos made by Trader Joe's. I also use chiles like hungarian, poblano, chipotle, and red pepper. Sometimes I use cubanelles or cubanos. (All roasted) I also add a little bit of jalepeno. Everything else pretty much is the same. I've made this over 5 times now. It's exquisite on homemade burritos, or dipping homemade crackers in.

Fantastic recipe!! I have made about 10 batches of this so far, and we just love the roasted flavor. It is REALLY hot, so you can cut back on the Jalapenos. I used Roma tomatoes, skipped the water and cilantro (family doesn't care for cilantro and it is very moist without water), doubled the onion and garlic, and added a roasted green pepper, as well. With a bit of lime juice and salt, you are good to go. Best salsa ever!!

Absolutely delicious. And very easy! I kept the skins on the tomatoes and just mashed them in the bowl, pureed everything else and through it in. I'll be back at the farmer's market today so I can make some to can.

The salsa has a nice zing and really fresh taste. We canned a quadruple batch.

After reading about this recipe I went right to the kitchen and made a batch. My only problem is that I didn't make a double! This is delicious. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the onions and garlic and sprayed them with olive oil. No water....and used lime juice. It is a very tasty and not difficult salsa. When my farmers market finally gets canning tomatoes, I will be making and canning enough of this to last through the cold long winters here in Wisconsin.

Pretty good! Love that roasted tomato flavor. I too added lime juice, and substituted a couple of habaneros for the jalapenos. A non-recipe-related paranthetical: I for one enjoy reading about other people's experiments with the recipes here--I often get good ideas about how to tweak dishes. So, keep them monologues a'comin.

Rating: 3
I think this is a bit too complicated for the result. I did everything out on the grill and it gave similar results - too much oven work, but it tastes good and if you want, add extra garlic and onions to your preference. As for people who substitute everything (note below)and write a ten page soliloquy on how to alter the entire recipe - stop doing this. It is very annoying and nobody cares.

Rating: 3
Half-way through preparation I decided that previous reviewers instincts about doubling the onion and garlic were correct and did so. I decided to spray the onions and garlic with a bit of olive oil as the first batch looked a bit dehydrated - I was much happier with round two. I'm quite satisfied with my salsa, having made a few significant changes: * Used early-girl tomatoes from my garden instead of plum (I'm using this strictly as a dip) * Doubled garlic and onions * Added 3 tsp lime juice and a dash of fresh-ground pepper * Used 2 jalepenos and 1 serrano pepper * Threw cilantro in blender with tomatoes for a better mix * Added a pinch of extra salt I cored my tomatoes which - considering what a pain it was - I'll probably do before roasting them in the future. I only removed about half of the skins, keeping the darkened skins to add to the smoky flavor. Overall, I found this to be a good introductory guide to a nice, smoky salsa that I'll definitely play around with further. A note on cilantro: As a Texan, I've learned to love the flavor though I appreciate that it can be overpowering for novices. I prefer to discard the stems - I find that they're a little too bitter but that the leaves alone are a very complimentary flavor for tomatoes. Good luck!

Roasted vegetables, yum. I replaced the jalapeno with chipotle. Smokey. Also added roasted white corn.

I made this exactly as written except I used lime juice instead of vinegar. I just made it 10 minutes ago and my first impression is the tomatoes outweigh the other ingrediants and the flavor is so so. As others have stated it gets better with time I will wait for 24 hours for final judgement. I would make again but I will definitly add more onion and garlic and either more pepper or a hotter variety. It was also a little watery for my taste so next time I will not use excess tomatoe juice.

Rating: 3
Yum yum yum! A few minor changes...nixed the water and added a splash of lime juice. No cliantro b/c I'm not a big fan, but I added parsley instead. I thought it was gonna be a flop when I tasted it immediately after making it, but I put it in the fridge over night to let the flavors mix and mingle. The next day it was fantastic! I'll definitely make this one again.

I've been searching for a roasted salsa recipe for quite some time now, so I was most excited to discover this delicious, simple concoction. Regrettably, at first try, it was a bit too spicy and watery (I added 3 jalapenos + a splash of water). However, on the second go round, I eliminated the water all together (it really doesn't need it - the juice from the tomatoes should suffice), reduced the jalapenos to 1 1/2, and doubled the amount of onions and garlic. I also added a splash of fresh lime juice. I let it sit for about a day, allowing the flavors to get to know one another, and was greeted by a refreshing, addictive, delectably spicy salsa. Everyone should give it a try!

This is one of the best salsas my family and I have ever had. The recipe was relatively easy, and the roasted veggies made a huge difference. In addition to the roasted tomatos, we used one good sized red pepper, and one good sized green pepper. It lowered the heavy tomato taste which some people in our family dont like very much.

This has become a staple recipe for me, and make it upon request every couple weeks. I even gave jars away at Christmas, and everyone begged for more. For a little more pop I use 1 habanero in a double batch.

To be fair, I made this recipe first exactly as it is written. It was pretty good. But then I got creative. I don't care for cilantro, so I used flat-leaved Italian parsley instead. And I roasted some corn and added that. But the most important addition is extra roasted garlic and onion. I've made it four times now, and tonight's batch was supremo!

Very good salsa, added some fresh tomatoes at the end which lent a little chunkiness, we liked it. However, hovering over the broiler in summer tomato season, here in the south anyway, borders on masochistic, so will probably not make this often.

Wonderful. Omit the water and use more peppers. We have made three batches already. Took a large batch to a party this weekend and it was gone in no time. I picked this to use up our garden tomatoes, ran out of those, so I used store tomatoes and it was just as good!

This is very good salsa. I have a tip for cutting down on the amount of "liquid" the tomatoes produce. Before you roast them...slice them and put them in that salad spinner that's been collecting dust in your cabinet. Spinning will leach out some of the water, and let the tomatoes roast nicely. :) Enjoy!

Very refreshing & well-received at work. I added more salt than called for but that is just personal taste.

I used hothouse tomatoes and this salsa turned out extremely watery. I hade to strain it to get the texture I wanted. The flavor was very good with just the right amount of kick but after you strain it you aren't left with too much. I also used parsley instead of cilantro beacuse I really don't like that flavor, but the parsley didn't work. Next time I will just omit it completely.

Where the standards of salsa is usually set by store bought brands and chain "Mexican" restrunts, this is a recipe without compare. Friends' Moms who jar their seasonal garden conveniently into salsa is what I used to yearn for. With this recipe, I am the one people are begging to produce more batches of my "secret" salsa.

Good bye salsa in a jar, hello fresh. This was my first attempt at fresh salsa. In the past week I have made three batches and will probably make another one this week. I did change the recipe a bit. I put the tomatoes, jalapeno, garlic and onion in a bowl and drizzled with olive oil before broiling. I also used the lime juice.

I make a very similar recipe to this except i use about 15 jalapenos, roasted till black with no seeds, when i need to spice it up i use 3 purree'd fresh jalapenos with some of the sauce to liven it up. it can be very bland with just 3 to 4 peppers. as for tomatoes i use stewed hunts tomatoes gives me more of a tomato flavor. and do use the juice. as far as garlic a whole bulb is just fine(yes i LOVE garlic)

The salsa was to be used as a dip, so I did not add water and I reduced the liquid before adding it to the vegetables. I also used lime juice in place of the vinegar. The dip was a huge success. Next time I plan to pan broil the onion with a bit of oil, though, to make it sweat and bring out more flavor.

The recipe is bland for those of you haven't tried authentic salsa or don't like hot & spicey. I had to add a great deal to it to achieve a salsa I could serve at my table. For the more adventurous types, add 4-5 serrano chiles instead of jalapenos. Also, when tomatoes are out of season or decent ones can't be found try canned, plum tomatoes with the juice.

I made this salsa for New Years Eve and all who tried it loved it. The roasting of the tomatoes and jalapenos added a wonderful smoky flavor to the salsa, and cilantro always is a delicious addition to any Mexican dish. I brought the leftover salsa to the firehouse where I work, and all of my collegues could not stop eating it! I highly recommend trying this, you'll love it!

I made a couple changes. I had many green peppers in my garden to use. I always double the recipe. I use 2 lbs tomatoes and 1 lb green pepper. I roast the pepper with the tomatoes. I also added the same amount of lime juice as vinegar. I found it very hot so I cut back the jalapeno to one large or two small per double batch. It is just delicious.

Great salsa but I deviated from the standard recipe. I used vidalia onion not white and serrano chiles instead of japs. I also added a few dashes of Worchestire sauce, some chopped green chiles and juice from 1/2 a lime.
