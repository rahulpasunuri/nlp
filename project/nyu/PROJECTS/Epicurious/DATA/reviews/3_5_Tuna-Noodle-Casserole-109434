One of the best "comfort casseroles" you can ever make. The only thing I add are a bag of green peas. My family LOVES this recipe and it is now in regular winter rotation.

I used this recipe with left over Thanksgiving turkey instead of tuna. It works out marvelously. However, I didn't have sherry so I used white wine, and I made the addition of peas. I followed all other steps. I didn't find it too time consuming considering I don't want the alternative of opening a manufactured soup instead of spending 15 extra minutes making the roux and base sauce. Well worth the effort, and my small kids even loved it! I'll use this recipe again.

The recipe by itself seemed too plain so I added thinly sliced carrots, chopped French green beans, extra mushrooms and an additional can of tuna. The flavors were good and light, not too heavy. I would make this again for a casual weeknight dinner.

As per what many reviewers said, this is an unusually time-consuming and dirty-dish-making recipe for a tuna casserole, but I found the pauses in between active cooking to be adequate for cleaning as I cooked. However, I'm an ex-pat and can't find things like cream of mushroom soup. I made this for a big dinner with our North American friends, and while ex-pats are conditioned to be extremely grateful for North American comfort dishes, this was a huge hit and will definitely make a reappearance.

wow! made this tonight and couldn't believe how good it was! followed recipe exactly except used white wine instead of sherry. i think my husband and myself had 3 helpings each! so good! best tuna casserole recipe i've ever made.

Delicious. I hope this review doesn't appear 2x, I think I pushed the wrong button somewhere. Anyway, adjust flavors to make it perfect for you, great advice contained in other reviews. Make this with one pot by sprinkling flour directly over veg and let that cook a few mins, then deglaze with liquids. If you add liquids slowly enough, you will have no lumps. Then at the end put the crumb topping on top of the skillet (same pan) and put the whole thing in the oven. 1 Pan. Oh, except for the pasta pan, you do need to boil the pasta. So 2 pans. Still better than the 4 they call for in the recipe. Hope this is helpful.

Bland, dry and bready tasting. I won't make this one again - it was edible, but average.

This recipe delivers on what it promises -- a classic tuna noodle casserole made from scratch -- and it tasted pretty good. However, what will keep me from making this again was the time and work involved, and also an awful lot of pots and pans dirtied. I generally enjoy being in the kitchen. After a full day of work I like spending an hour or two (or more!) preparing dinner. But for tuna noodle casserole? I just didn't think it was special enough, or amazing in any unique way, to justify my efforts.

I tried to stay true to the recipe but my cupboard was working against me. Substituted 1 red pepper for the mushrooms. Added 1/2 cup shredded cheddar/jack blend cheese and 1/4 parmigiano reggiano to the sauce, along with a 1/2 cup or so of frozen peas. I didn't have sherry so I used sake. And I did not drizzle oil over the bread crumb mixture (I overlooked this step). Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was the best tuna casserole we've ever had! Kid and husband both liked it and asked me to make it again. Seemed kinda weird to add soy sauce to a tuna casserole, but it worked!

I think this should call for 16 ounces of egg noodles, not six. I prepared this in two casserole dishes. Additions: celery, Dijon, cayenne, nutmeg, Italian parsley, frozen peas. I substituted some Parmesan for the cheddar. Lovely and comforting without the cream of blech soup.

This was awesome! The only mistake I made was adding more noodles than called for cause I thought it would be too watery. It was fine when first cooked, but then the leftovers were very dry.

This is a very good basic recipe, but can be made a four-forker without too much trouble..... How? This was my approach: Add 1 1/2 tsp Dijon mustard to the butter prior to adding the flour for the sauce. When the sauce is finished add cayenne pepper to taste and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. When combining the sauce and mushroom mixture, add one bunch of finely chopped flat-leaf parsley and a hand full or two of frozen peas. Use 3/4 cup of Cheddar cheese for the topping (I used Old Amsterdam, since that's readily available in Holland already grated) and 1/4 cup grated parmesan or Pecorino cheese. The difference is significant when compared to the original recipe!

Really delicious, better than I expected. Definitely brings back memories of having it as a kid, but flavor was better. Note that 10 oz of mushrooms is NOT 4 CUPS. Made a few changes to lighten/make it more healthy. Used multgrain bread crumbs, skim milk, Tamari sauce. Also added peas. Will definitely make again!

This recipe definitely satisfies a craving for the tuna casserole made from canned things from childhood, but it's SO much better! I punched it up with a little cayenne, but other than that, made it as written. It's delicious and easy.

I LOVE this recipeit's so versatile, fun to embellish, and so great as-written, and it's become my go-to for tuna noodle casserole. I like to stir in veggies before roastingfrozen or canned peas, fresh zucchini, red peppers (either fresh or roasted), and broccoli are all favorites. Here's a way to make this dish DAIRY FREE: Sub in dairy-free margarine like Earth Balance for butter Use unsweetened almond milk instead of milk for the rouxit blends best and tastes great Use Daiya or Teese cheddar cheese for the topping, or, if you can tolerate it, cheddar made from raw goat's milk. I know most lactose intolerant folk are used to making these simple substitutions, but if you were wondering if it would work, let me tell you - it does!

I have been looking for a good Tuna Noodle Casserole without Campbell's soup as an ingredient for the last 10 yrs. I have found it! Love it! I used whole wheat noodles, tuna from a pouch and olive oil instead of the listed ingredients. It was the best we've ever had. Thank you for the recipe! I think it would be good with celery or pinmentos too.

Rating: 4
This was so good! The addition of sherry is almost a must in any tuna noodle dish! I also added 1/2 cup chopped celery, when shitakes were almost done, kept it a bit firm, as well as olive oil for the crumbs and a cheese mix. I also used some of the tuna oil as perk flavor!!Yum!!

Rating: 3
I made this for dinner tonight with some minor changes (because it was what I had in the pantry). I only used 1 T. butter to saute the onions and made a slurry of broth and flour instead of adding more butter. I replaced the mushrooms with dried shitake mushrooms (rehydrated) which, I would guess, gave it a stronger mushroom flavor and used half and half instead of milk. My husband and I really liked it. We both grew up eating Tuna Noodle Casserole and thought this is a more gourmet version while still keeping it's "homey" quality.

I loved this receipe! I hadn't made tuna casserole in decades, but I was looking for ways to prepare tuna and I happened to have most of the ingredients. I left out the lemon juice, used water-based tuna, twice the amount, 1% milk and two little cans of shitake mushrooms. Delicious!

This recipe was fantastic! I did make a few changes to ramp up the flavor: -added about 3-4 oz goat cheese after adding milk to sauce (used 2% milk) -added 1 c frozen peas - love the poppy texture! -added red pepper flakes and fresh black pepper to sauce for a little heat -added salt, pepper, smoked paprika, fresh parsley and gouda cheese (instead of cheddar) to the breadcrumb topping. The smoked paprika really gave it a complex unique flavor - I highly recommend it! This was so delicious - reminded me of when I was a kid - except no cream soup : ) A must try!

I had never eaten, much less made, a tuna casserole in my life, but having recently gone vegetarian (except for fish), I needed recipes for my family's new lifestyle. This was a big hit with everyone, including my kids (ages 10 and 9)! Here's how I tweeked it to make it healthier and tastier: --I used low-sodium vegetable broth rather than chicken, and 2% milk rather than whole. --added 1 cup frozen peas with the mushrooms which was really good! --did not use soy, lemon, or sherry, rather (upon a reviewer's suggestion) I added a little ceyenne pepper and nutmeg to the roux, plus salt & pepper. --Used one can of tuna (drained), plus one 2 oz. pouch. Perfect. --added a little cheddar to the roux, per several reviewer's suggestions. --I used bagged shredded cheddar which worked just fine, and also whole wheat bread rather than white. Worked perfectly. I'll definitely be making this again! Rich, creamy, hearty, satisfying! Loved the crisp topping over the hot creamy filling!

This was delicious. Here are my tweaks to make this gluten-free, lower in fat & salt, and to use fewer pans: * low-sodium tamari instead of soy sauce * 1/4 C Savory & James amontillado (no need to use my good sherry for cooking) * 1/4 C Bob's Red Mill GF all- purpose baking flour + 1 tsp Bob's Red Mill corn flour (to thicken the roux) * 2% milk instead of whole * 1/8 tsp. salt * 2 cans Pastene tonno--one 5 oz, one 3 oz (more would've been too fishy) * 3 slices Ener-G Light Tapioca Loaf * 6 oz Bionature fusilli * 4 0z Cabot 50% reduced fat sharp cheddar cheese * 1 tbsp olive oil insteaed of vegetable oil * ~ 1/2 bag of Cascadian Farm frozen peas (~8 oz) . Following others' suggestions, I cooked the pasta first, then used the same pot for the mushroom portion of the recipe. I placed the mushroom mixture in a bowl and used the same pot again to cook the rest of the recipe. This is a keeper.

never having had a tuna noodle casserole in my life, i couldn't really explain why i had a craving for this the other night, but i'm glad i did. delicious. i changed it a little, to make it healthier/more delicious. i added a few cloves of garlic to the onions as they cooked, some chopped rosemary and thyme when i added the mushrooms. when the mushrooms were almost done, i added about a cup of thawed, drained frozen spinach. i used whole wheat rotini- which was nice b/c it added texture. i used skim milk in the roux- and it didn't thicken quite as much as i had expected, so i added a little cornstarch slurry and that helped. it still wasn't that thick, but when i assembled the dish, it didn't matter. it was so good. next time i would add a second can of tuna, as other readers suggest, and mix some of the cheese into the roux. the crumbs were the only part that seemed a little bland, next time i might add a little garlic and maybe some more flavorful cheese, like parmesan or romano.

Rating: 3
This was pretty tasty, though a lot of work for a weeknight. I actually found some whole grain egg noodles which worked perfectly. My only disappointment was that the top did not get crisp at all, even though the sauce was bubbling. Still, heard lots of "best tuna noodle casserole I've ever had" - take that for what it's worth.

Rating: 3
I enjoyed this recipe. I added 1/3 cup frozen peas.. Next time I plan to add some shreaded carrots. One tip I would suggest is to be careful in seasoning ths dish. There is a lot of salt content in the soysauce so keep the salt to a minimum and season to taste after you mixed all the ingredients together...

This was just what I was looking for. Heavy food for the last 2 weeks & New Years tomorrow. I made exactly as written & used 1 4qt.sauce pan & a 2qt. baking dish. Cook the noodles first. Drain & put into baking dish. Follow recipe & pour over noodles & tuna as you go. No reason to drag out all the pots & pans. Mix & bake. Yummm EASY

I was looking for a homey casserole to make during a snowstorm, and decided to try out this one- pretty much by the recipe, except that I forgot to add the soy sauce (added salt instead), added french cut green beans, and doubled the tuna, adding the water from the tuna can as. It is indeed some work to assemble, but that's mostly prepping the mushrooms, grating the cheese, and stirring the sauce as it boils and thickens-- a similar amount of work to mac and cheese, I guess. I also see now that I look again at the recipe that I probably didn't make as much crumbs as it calls for, but it was a very adequate amount (maybe about a cup). With the extra tuna, It was not bland, and I'd make this again if I was looking to make tuna noodle casserole another time. (it happens about once a decade!)

Meant to mention that the cayenne and fresh nutmeg idea in my review below was inspired by a delicious Mac and Cheese recipe, courtesy of Martha Stewart: http://www.marthastewart.com/article/perfect-macaroni-and-cheese. It is worth checking out as it is a similar recipe.

I left out the soy sauce, sherry and lemon. I added 1/4 tsp each of cayenne and grated nutmeg and 1/2 tsp fresh ground pepper to the sauce. I used 8 oz sharp cheddar, half of which I added to the sauce along with the spices, before mixing in the mushrooms. I used 2 cans tuna as other reviewers did. Also, I made garlic bread crumbs for the topping by melting butter, adding crushed garlic and tossing with 4 slices of torn white bread. The dish was flavorful and a big hit. Great comfort food.

Rating: 4
I like the original recipe, but I made a few changes. First of all I sauted fresh raw prawns in butter and a bit of chili oil, set them aside and sauted several cups of a mixture of wild mushrooms, celery, onion. In the roux I added a cup of sharp cheddar along with the other ingredients. I used unseasoned panko with melted butter and sharp Cheddar for the topping. I got raves from the family next time I will have to double the recipe since there were no leftovers. Oh, and I made the roux in the same baking dish to eliminate an extra pan to wash!

Rating: 0
While this tasted very good and the whole family enjoyed it, I doubt I will ever make it again. If I am going to get every pan in the house dirty, it's going to have to be something more substantial then a meal with less than $10 of ingredients. Seriously, 3 pot or pans for the stove and then a baking tray for the oven. The strainer, cheese grater, food processor since I didn't have bread crumbs and the energy both for the appliances and on my part just didn't justify the meal.

I made this for the first time tonight and it was perfect for a rainy night!I took the suggestions of others here and used extra tuna and extra noodles and made it in a 13 x9 pan. I added red pepper flakes to the noodles and used a soy wasabi sauce. Also, I used lime juice instead of lemon juice and used panko breadcrumbs. Simple recipe - I don't think it took all that long to make, really and the results were well worth the effort! Very good! It's a keeper!

This has become classic comfort food in our household. Ive taken a bunch of suggestions from other people, and changed the assembly order to reduce the dishes and make the timing a bit more efficient, so here goes: First cook the pasta, and rinse it till its thoroughly cooled, leaving it in the colander. Then in a 2.5L saucepan, I do the mushroom paragraph, adding 2 stalks of celery, chopped pretty fine. Then move that into a large bowl, and use the same saucepan for the roux. I use the liquid from the tuna as part of the two cups for the roux broth. As youre making the roux (and I warm the 1% or 2% milk a little in the measuring cup), flake into the mushroom mixture 2 cans of tuna, some parsley, about 5 oz of frozen peas (1/2 a box), and the lemon juice. Season lots w/ salt & pepper; thyme goes well too. When the roux is thickened, mix in half the cheese, then combine with the mushroom, etc& and pour into the casserole. Finally, thank you pastaguy  the suggestion for substituting potato chips as a topper is BRILLIANT! I mix the other half of the cheese in w/ the crushed chips (which you can do in the same saucepan once you remove the roux), and use that as a topping.

Also good substituting chicken for the tuna. I didn't have mushrooms, so I used asparagus. It was fabulous!

I used the recommendations of some other cooks- added frozen peas, celery, plus several cloves of garlic, two dried chillies and increased the butter. Also added sour cream to the noodles before adding the sauce mixture. It still tasted a little on the bland side. The sauce mixture smelled amazing while cooking though. My husband suggests marinating the tuna next time before adding into the mix.

This is my go-to recipe for tuna casserole. I add extra mushrooms, extra tuna and extra noodles - it makes a ton and tastes SO GOOD. Also I substitute veggie broth for the chicken broth and panko for the bread crumbs, and add celery, peas, or whatever I have on hand. My boyfriend asked me to make tuna casserole out of the blue a few years ago and I've been making this ever since - he raves about it. Especially the crust on top and the mushrooms. It does take a while to put everything together but if you like to cook you won't mind, plus it is worth what you get at the end!

This recipe came out great flavor. I tweaked it a bit. I did not add any salt since there is enough salt in the soy sauce as well as the chicken broth. I used two cans of albacore tuna and reserved the oil for drizzling in the cheddar mixture, instead of using the vegetable oil. I used Panko flakes instead of bread crumbs and 2 cups of freshly grated Cheddar Cheese instead of 1 cup. I added quite of bit of fresh ground black pepper and a dash of Jalapeno powder into the roux before adding the mixture to the noodles. I added red pepper flakes to the water to boil the noodles. I baked it in the oven for 22 minutes on the middle rack then broiled it for about 4 minutes, leaving it on the middle rack. I also added peas.

Made this a second time. Changes are as follows: Used fresh thyme, used panko-style bread crumbs, two cans of 5oz tuna, and lastly I used some of the juice from the canned tuna to augment the chicken broth. This recipe is still as spectacularly delicious when making it this second time.

I wouldn't recommend this unless you really, really love tuna casserole. It took quite a while to make and all in all was a little bit bland, even though I seasoned heavily with salt and pepper, and a few other spices at hand. Even so, the flavor was a little dull. The texture however was fabulous, and because it makes a large dish there was casserole left over for easy reheating when there was no time to cook. I served with baby broccolini sauteed in garlic to add color/something healthy on the side...The breadcrumbs were excessive, I would definitely recommend half. I'm a fan of breadcrumbs but because there are so many they never really cooked into a crispy top, it was like serving a casserole with a mound of sand on top.

This is a decent recipe, but I did add a a bit stone-ground mustard, and a dollop of red curry paste to give it a slight kick. Used Panko crumbs for topping. Nice, easy weeknight meal.

This is a staple now whenever I visit my son,daughter-in-law and their new baby. I fiddle with measurements because, as we all know, tuna comes in only 5 oz cans now. I cut down on the noodles & sauce and it fits into an 8x8 pan. A larger version can be divided & half of it frozen, if making for two. I use panko & cheese for topping. BTW, as written, the topping is twice as much as needed. I made this today with canned chicken for someone who doesn't like fish. Eager to hear how that works.

This was delicious, first attempt at tuna noodle casserole. Few substitutions (of course)...added whole wheat egg noodles (which turned out to be egg white only), added about 1 cup peas (to add something green) during the mixing of the tuna, and finally added 2 cans of tuna. The meal was hearty and delicous, and made 8 servings.

by the way - forgot to mention... i only had 4 oz of pasta instead of the 6 called for... and those were some lovely lemon egg noodles made locally by nonna's noodles... they were all that i had in the cupboard, but they turned out to be a great substitution. I still used the same amount of sauce provided by the recipe, and it was perfect...not too saucy at all. i will do it the same way next time. :)

Wow! I was hesitant to make this because I was missing three key ingredients... soy sauce, chicken stock and sherry. I decided to risk it, using lightly salted water in place of the chicken stock, sherry vinegar in place of the sherry, and a paste of miso and water in place of the soy sauce. This is obviously a very forgiving recipe, because it was still delicious. Aside from the subs I mentioned above, I used peas instead of mushrooms, two cans of tuna instead of one, mixed a bit of the grated cheddar directly into the warm sauce before pouring it on the noodles, and used a combination of croutons and bread crumbs for the topping. My boyfriend is incredibly picky, but he raved and raved about this casserole. For those who stated that this was bland..I think the key is to take enough time to properly cook the flour when making the roux, and then making sure to season the sauce well to your liking before mixing in the tuna. I will make this again and again.

The sauce is great. I don't just use it for tuna casserole. I will stick chicken, beef, even chunked whitefish into the casserole instead of tuna. One thing I did change is the number of pots and bowls I use. I hate washing a ton of pots and pans at the end of the night so I empty the onions and mushrooms into a small bowl (easily goes in dishwasher) and make the roux in the same pan. I use a 3 qt pan and toss the noodles into the sauce at the end, top the pan with breadcrumbs and throw it in the oven. Washing 2 pots is definitely better than 3+casserole dish.

I found this to be a great base recipe. I know the flavors that I like so I made modifications based on that. I added de-thawed frozen peas to the mushroom mix once it was finished sautéing. And added an extra can of tuna (flaked) but did not stir the tuna into the casserole until it was 5 minutes away from being fully baked. I also didnt add the topping until this time. Instead of adding bread crumbs to the cheese, I used my homemade croutons (bread ends, garlic, olive oil, onions, salt & pepper) and crushed them in a baggie for a more flavorful topping. I also omitted the oil since the croutons had oil and reduced the butter amounts for the dish by half, which required me to add milk to the rue asap. Overall the dish turned out wonderful and I will definitely make it again!

This is definitely superior to the cream of mushroom brand of tuna casserole. I would far rather make things from scratch then add a canned soup or alfredo sauce, but that's just me. To me this wasn't bland as others have complained...but it's definitely a creamy comfort food. I'd suggest red pepper flakes if you need some heat. I added fresh dill which was a nice pairing with the tuna. I didn't have any breadcrumbs... just topped it off with cheese. I did miss the crunch but this was still tasty.

Rating: 4
Very good recipe. I grew up with the canned soup variety also and knew that it had to be better. This recipe is it. I can't stand mushrooms so I omit that. My mother used a can of cream of celery soup in hers and I miss the celery so if I have it, I dice up some and cook it with the onions. I use two cans of tuna; one can simply is not enough. Also, even though my sons love the breadcrumb topping, I use only one cup of it; 1 and a half cups is just too much! Oh, and I've used the roux part of this recipe to create my own chicken pot pie. It's probably a standard roux...it works well.

I made this last night for my husband and I. I was a bit disappointed with the results for the amount of work. I followed the recipe as written with the only exception being, I added a second can of tuna as others suggested which turned out to be a good idea. The Sherry disappeared completely and made me wish I'd added more than the 1/4 C. Neither one of us were wowed with the overall flavor. Something was missing. I also felt the ratio of noodles to onion mix was to great. I would double the onion mix if using the same amount of noodles. Perhaps a bit more salt would be helpful, I don't know. This is the first time I've made tuna casserole. I will make it again and increase the Sherry a bit.

I grew up on tuna noodle casserole with cream of mushroom soup and have made it my entire life, but this has transformed me! I actually searched for this recipe because I didn't have the mushroom soup. This had so much more flavor! My small tweaks: I added a bag of frozen peas to the casserole as I always do. I mixed the cheese in with the casserole in lieu of some of the milk, than added a sprinkling of cheese over top. I couldn't stop eating it and my family had the same reaction. I will definitely be making this again.

As usual had to do some subs based on what I had in cuboard: elbows instead of egg noodles, dried mushrooms instead of fresh, reg bread crumbs instead of fresh. All was fine except next time i will take make sure i have some homemade breadcrumbs- the topping texture would have been better, I'm sure. As is, it wasn't bad or anything, but not as beautiful as photo. I was also freaked about cheese on this dish- never had it with cheese before- but my friend said to do it, and was right. It's not enough to make it "cheesy" but it improves the crumb topping texture & keeps it from being so dry. I always keep dried mushies on hand cause I don't use mushrooms a lot so they go bad in the fridge. Used the mushroom "tea" water to make part of the 2 cups of broth, added water from the (water packed) tuna & reg water to make 2 cups & 2 tsp "better than boullion" base. Pretty much followed all other seasoning to a T except I didn't add the bit of salt because I figured the salt from the tuna water, etc, was enough (it was.) Definitely doubled the tuna- hadn't even read the reviews yet, but couldn't imagine 6 oz being enough. Added some peas ("Tuna Pea Wiggle" as we call it in NH.) Also scooped mush mixture into bowl & did white sauce in same pan to pick up flavor & save washing pans. It did take awhile for something I consider a "convenience" dish, but it was my first time with this recipe. It is a keeper! & I am sure I will get it down & faster with some practice. Its just the sauce thats a couple steps extra & once you don't have to look at the recipe all the time, then that part should only be 15 minutes instead of 25. Oh,and my daughter (21 months) loved it.

Dish was fine and I can already see shortcuts to take for the same result. If carefully done, the roux could be made in the same pot as the onions and mushrooms; it wouldn't be classic roux, but this method would impart more of the sherried mushroom flavor. I served the dish with a dollop of sour cream for added richness.

I now make this recipe religiously - especially in the winter. About the only thing I change is to add another can of tuna. I've used both oil-packed and water-packed and honestly either works well. This also freezes well. I almost always make a double batch and freeze half for later. Sherry adds great flavor - this is not your bland tuna casserole

Well, I never ate this growing up so I thought I would give it a try. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly - only change was to use 2 cans tuna based on previous reviews. I had the mushrooms, sauce, and pasta all going at the same time so it didn't take too long to make. I really wanted to like it. I really didn't like it though. It wasn't awful but I just didn't think it tasted all that good. I did manage to eat it but honestly I've never disliked something I made myself so much before. My husband liked it though, so he might request it again; otherwise I wouldn't make it again. The mushroom mixture smelled awesome while it was cooking, and I did pikc those out of the finished dish...maybe I could somehow stick more with that and lose the bland sauce if he requests it again....eh.

It was 1975 and I was a 7th grade Home Economics student at Shenandoah Jr. High in Miami, Florida. Our teacher taught us how to make Tuna Casserole, a recipe I always loved and never forgot to make as it is the epitome of comfort kiddie food. Over the years I inevitably became an adult and snobbish about food and ingredients (use a can of cream of whatever... for a meal? Never!) so I hadn't considered this dish in over a dozen years. Then one night in May 2009 my pre-teen kids were sick and asking me to baby them and I told them I would make them my favorite dish as a kid. I pulled up this recipe and thought it had some nice touches with the soy sauce and the sherry. But then I got real and used the proverbial can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup to substitute for the creamy sauce called for here. I am sure the sauce is fabulous, and tuna casserole is a winning dish especially for young families. But if you're feeling a little lazy, go for the canned cream soup and arrange the casserole as called for in this recipe. Skipping the sauce steps will save you 40 minutes and your family will still be satisfied, heartwarmed and feeling loved.

Yummy! Didn't add Sherry because I didn't have any and I used beef stock instead of chicken because that was in my cupboard! So delicious I ate a ton of it!

My husband and I really liked this. I did try to make it a little more healthful by using olive oil instead of butter (except in the roux--I used the butter for that); and using 2% milk, whole-wheat egg noodles and whole-wheat bread for the breadcrumbs, and reduced-fat Cheddar.

I thought this was tasty - I've never made the soup version (and never will) but have made it with a white sauce which can be boring. Added one stalk of chopped celery and minced garlic to the onion - love the idea of mushrooms but my husband wouldn't so added peas, and used panko crumbs. You have to start the steps simultaneously,otherwise, it would take too long - and too many pots to clean ... but you can do those when the casserole is in the oven.

Holy cow, this is amazing. I doubled the tuna, and sprinkled french fried onions on top. The sauce is a bit of work but not difficult if you follow the directions, and it's worth it.

This was a production to make but worth the effort! Instead of using fresh mushrooms, I used dried porcinis, reconstituted them in 1.5 cups of hot water, and reserved the mushroom water. I diced the reconstituted porcinis finely and tossed them in the saute. I used the broth from the mushrooms as one of the two cups of chicken broth. This gave it such a wonderful mushroomy flavor...I also used skim milk and it comes out great. Another sub I made was using sake instead of sherry...it offers a nice, nutty flavor to the casserole, but sherry also worked fine. Thank GOODNESS I was out of canned mushroom soup and found this recipe!

Rating: 4
I made this recipe as written, except that I used 2% milk and substituted panko for the fresh breadcrumbs. It was excellent! Even my three- year-old ate it (and thanked me for making it). Certainly more work than the standard canned- soup casserole, but worth the effort.

I grew up in a busy family with both parents working and naturally, my mom made this with condensed soup. And I HATED it. I hated every casserole made with bland, salty, condensed soup base. I came across this and thought I'd give it a try, just to change up the weeknight routine and wow, it is really good. The fresh mushrooms, snappy lemon, and the unique mix of sherry and soy sauce - really flavorful. I reduced the amount of milk and used skim, and substituted butter for olive oil. Makes a nice meal with a salad or warm veggies like green beans or brussels sprouts.

Wow - this is super YUMMY! I tried to make it a bit more healthy/low-fat using 2% milk, less butter, adding peas in with the mushrooms (I think asparagus would be fantastic!) and using less panko breadcrumbs and cheese. It was fantastic and we are NOT a casserole kind of family. It's a great gourmet twist on an old-time comfort food. Great for challenging economic times too. Try it!

Didn't have mushrooms on hand so I used peppers. Also no sherry so I used red wine vinegar and it turned out delicious. Does take a little bit of time and I put wayy too many bread crumbs on it.

I thought this was wonderful! Made it at home and the roomies couldn't get enough. :-) I used skim milk and thought that was just as good as whole. Like other reviewers, added celery and garlic for some extra punch. Would suggest incorporating cheese into the roux-- we were all so wild about the cheesy topping! How can you go wrong with more cheese? :-) I also used panko instead of bread crumbs; definitely the way to go.

Reality - I am not going to use unsalted butter to make tuna casserole. This dish could have used some celery for flavor and texture but overall, really good. The sherry was great and I would have cut down on the broth and added another quarter cup of it. A little garlic would be a great addition as well. Also I did not have any cheddar but swiss was a great alternative to it.

Rating: 4
This was delicious! I followed the suggestion of other reviewers by using two cans of tuna and used Progresso bread crumbs (hey, that's all I can get at my grocery store) and it turned out great. I'm sure that if I used higher-quality ingredients it would've tasted even better, but trust me - you don't need anything fancy to make this an excellent dish.

I made this last night and thought it was delicous! I omitted the lemon juice partially because I would have had to defrost some, but also didn't see what it would add to the flavor. I also used only 8 oz of muxhrooms b/c that's all I had (again, I thought it was very flavorful and yummy, but probably would be even better with the full 10 oz), and I used shredded Romano cheese instead of cheddar b/c I don't like cheddar. Also used homemade white bread crumbs. I am a tuna noodle afficionado, and was worried that it might not measure up, but IMO, it was fabulous. I will definitely make it again and thought it was well worth the extra effort.

My wife rated this dish - excellent. I added fresh rosemary, thyme and celery as suggested in a companion Epicurious recipe. By accident I substituted beef broth for chicken broth.

I made this for the first AND last time last night. It was terrible. I should have heeded the adive of the 15% who rated it poorly and not wasted my time.The sauce had absolutely no flavor at all in spite of me spicing it up with Tabasco, garlic and an extra can of tuna. I did not find the recipe too time consuming as did some reviewers, but even one minute is too long to waste on this mess. If you are at all discerning,don't even think about making this.

The quality of ingredients is everything in this dish! I followed the process of this recipe but made a few adjustments to the quantities and qualities of the ingredients. I used a pound of porcini mushrooms, a yellow onion, 8 oz of Pennsylvania Dutch egg noodles, 2 cans of Tonno Genova Light Tuna in Olive Oil, and Ian's Panko breadcrumbs...this was EXCELLENT!

This was not worth the effort at all! But if you really want to give it a shot, I'd recommend adding at least one more can of tuna and use far less breadcrumbs than recommended. The recipe "as is" is really nothing special.

I avoid tuna, due to the mercury content, so I decided to make a salmon noodle casserole. I used three cans of salmon (next time I'll use fresh poached salmon). Since it was water-packed, I added one tablespoon of Olive Oil to the sauce. I doubled both the soy sauce and the sherry (I used dry sherry). Next time, I will also double (possibly triple) the lemon juice, as well. I also added a half cup of milk due to the extra salmon (I was concerned about the possibility of it being dry). For breadcrumbs, I substituted what I had on hand -- Italian-spiced Panko, which really added to the flavor and the herbed crunch was delicious! Since I bought my egg noodles in bulk, I misjudged and used too much, so next time I will reduce the amount. I increased the amount of cheese to suit my housemates' palate and added garlic, peas and white pepper to the mix. Next time, I'm considering broccoli or green beans instead of peas. Overall, it was very tasty and with a few more minor adjustments (mostly noted above) I would definitely make this again.

Rating: 4
This is an absolutely scrumptious dish. I made just a few adjustments. I added a second can of tuna as well as peas and fresh parsley for color. I used dried bread crumbs because I had no fresh crumbs. I liked it in the end because it gave the casserole texture. One thing I would do is make a bit more of the roux, especially since I added other ingredients.

Rating: 3
This ain't your mom's casserole(at least not my mom's)! I loved the earthiness of the sauce. I did double the sauce ingredients, but that made it too runny so next time will cut down on the broth and milk. I used gruyere and swiss cheeses(and threw a handful into the sauce as it was cooking).I like egg noodles better so used them. Will definitely make this again, and wont wait for Lent Fridays next time.

Rating: 3
Delicious! Only change I made was swiss instead of cheddar. A suggestion for those reviewers who thought the recipe took too long -- do more than one thing at a time! Put your pasta water on to boil right away, and start your roux while the onions cook down. If you do everthing at once, it's very fast to prep and get in the oven.

Rating: 3
Very happy with the results. I agree that is it a little more intensive with the time but worth it! Doubled the sauce, doubled the pasta and 4x the tuna all in a 9 x 12 pan for 20 minutes on the nose and it came out perfect. By the way also used full 1# of mushrooms.

Fantastic! We used whole wheat egg noodles and garlic- roasted tuna in olive oil; other than that we followed the recipe exactly. Between the two of us, we finished this off in one sitting. I will double it next time so we have leftovers!

No time to read through all 121 reviews to see what everyone else said, so apologies if I repeat. First, I didn't find this slow to prepare at all; it took just over 30 minutes and was on the table 1 hour after I walked in the door. I used a bit too much pasta for the amount of sauce I had; next time I'll be sure to allow for it to be much wetter. We are dairy free, so substituted soy cream for the milk, canola oil in the mushroom/onion sautee and margarine in the roux. Skipped the cheese with the bread crumbs; tasted great. I also used more mushrooms than suggested, since I like a mushroomy taste. Otherwise went with the recipe, and it was a huge hit for kids and adults, especially on a cold, rainy day like today. Can't wait to make it again!

Rating: 3
This is a truly wonderful, comforting casserole. My husband had a special craving for a casserole one night, but this did disappoint. The one thing we would suggest is to double the sauce and be very careful not to dry it out in the oven. We used marble cheddar but next time will use a sharp, old cheddar and a bit more of it. We had not sherry, so we used Grand Marnier - it was good!

Rating: 3
Scrumptious! Would give it a 3.5 if I could. Its the perfect meal when a blizzard rages outdoors. Have made it twice this winter, using what's on hand and trying the suggestions of other reviewers. Its always tasted great. The only thing I've tried that hasn't been mentioned already is using a whole 1# package of mushrooms. (I tend to forget "extra" produce and then later discover a puddle of mush. So why not put those surplus mushrooms where they'll do some good.)

Rating: 2
This was very good and probably would have been even better if I had used whole milk instead of rice milk and butter instead of canola oil. However, it takes an Awfully. Long. Time. to prepare. And makes a huge mess. I added diced celery and carrots as well as two cloves of garlic to the sauteeing onion, which rounded out the meal and tasted very good.

Today I had a craving for Tuna Noodle Casserole, which I haven't had in years. Seems the previous reviewer was on the same wavelength - must be our lovely Seattle winter weather! I ALMOST chickened out and made the canned-soup recipe I grew up on. Glad I listened to the rave reviews for this recipe instead. It really hit the spot and will definitely make it onto my comfort food repertoire. I made the popular modifications of adding a bit of garlic and Tobasco to the mushrooms. Also used crushed croutons for topping. The whole thing took me about 30 minutes to put together. I used pre-sliced mushrooms and did not bother cooking the egg noodles. They cooked perfectly in the oven. I made the mushroom saute and the roux/sauce at the same time. Served with white wine and green salad w/champagne vinagrette. Mmmmmm. Next time maybe I'll double the recipe and make an extra one to freeze.

I'm shocked at any negative review - I don't know how anyone could NOT love this! Adding diced celery & 1/2c walnuts (because it was something my Mom always added to her tuna casserole) only added a few minutes to the prep time, and lots of flavor. I topped it with 1 cup of crushed kettle potato chips, and used "Kluski" noodles, which, with the nuts and celery, made it taste more like Mom's. It took just a few minutes more to make this recipe than one that uses the salty, processed canned soup (which I HATE). With my personal changes, this will be the Tuna Casserole recipe that I'll make for the rest of my life. The sherry, soy sauce and chicken stock give this dish lots of flavor, as well as the fresh mushrooms. Great Recipe!

I will definately make it again.

We found this tuna recipe to be very unexceptional. It does take an hour to assemble and it does take several pans to put together. Then, when you finally eat it, it seemed so very ordinary and not worth the effort. Based on all the other rave reviews, if you decide to try it, this is one recipe where you'll be happy if you have everything assembled and ready to go beforehand. Slice the mushrooms, measure the flour, grate the cheese, etc., etc. Then between each step while you're waiting for something to simmer you can be accomplishing something else toward your dinner.

tweaked it from suggestions here - cooked the noodles first, cooked the onions etc. in the same pan and put them in a bowl that would later hold the panko and cheeese. Wiped the pot out and make the sauce in it. Wanted to see if I could get it down to fewer pots and pans: so I pot and I bowl did the job. Pretty good, but too much work for a so-so casserole.

This was an awesome recipe! I did tweak a few things from previous reviewer's comments. I substituted panko for the breadcrumbs, which gave a perfectly crunchy texture and I added grated parmesan cheese to the cheddar (1/2 cup of each cheese). I added 5 cloves of minced garlic right before I added the mushrooms and I stirred in 1 jar of thinly sliced, drained artichokes right before I baked it. Yummy! My friend loved it! We drank an Italian Lagrein Rose with it. I will always make this on cold, winter nights!

Surprisingly good recipe. Made it for my mom while I was taking care of her post-surgery for a week and she asked for it a second time so she'd be sure to have plenty in the freezer after I'd gone. Added garlic, doubled the tuna, added a bit more noodles (about 4 cups), used panko, and used half cheddar half parmesan (and probably about 1/2 again more cheese than called for). Second time I made it it went much faster, probably even less than the hour and a half stated. Terrific comfort food.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. Took me longer than an hour and a half, though - more like 2+ - but it's possible I worked slowly and/or could have used more time-saving techniques (pre-cleaned and -cut mushrooms, etc.). All-in-all the casserole was delicious. I used 2% milk, salted butter, tuna in water, regular chicken stock, and panko, and can't imagine the regular ingredients would have added much. I do believe the sherry added an incredible dimension to the flavor, though, and would discourage omitting it when possible. Otherwise, a great dish, and one to keep in the file for years to come!

GREAT tuna casserole recipe - I didn't think it took too long. I added some steamed broccoli, a couple tablespoons of grated romano cheese, and a few dashes of tabasco to the sauce. Next time I make, I'll probably leave out the cheese on top and just add some panko or crushed crackers.

Great recipe! This dish is a staple in my home. I usually omit the cheese, cut back on the butter, use tuna in water and use reduced fat milk instead of whole (my husband would faint if I followed the original recipe.) I've also tried sun-dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts instead of the peas and mushrooms. I prefer the original myself. Love it!

Perfect comfort food on a rainy night. Taking the cue from several other reviewers I used a mix of panko, cheddar and parmesan for the topping. To make it a tad bit more healthy, I used whole wheat pasta and skim milk. You could probably use tuna packed in water and not really tell the difference.

I made a combination of this and the TUNA NOODLE CASSEROLE WITH MUSHROOMS AND FRESH HERBS from this site (not really enough of either to rate them) Mine turned out good. If you're looking to add something to this try rosemary and thyme (1 tb fresh, 1 tsp dried) from the other recipe. Also, I took another reviewer's advice and used a big sauce pan for the mushrooms, so I could use it to make the sauce too. I never precook my noodles, they cook well in the oven. One less step and all I used was one pan and the casserole dish. I'm not sure how this is as written, but it's a good base to play with -enjoy!

Everyone loved this one! A couple of modifications I used... Instead of butter in the onion/mushroom I used olive oil. I also sprayed the pan w/ non stick spray.

A great fancied-up tuna casserole for dinner guests! I have some friends who are food snobs. When they have me over for dinner, they make inordinately fancy meals. So when I have them over, I like to make something a bit more homey (I keep hoping they'll learn that food doesn't have to be complicated to be tasty). I made this dish for them and they loved it! If you're just making it for the fam at home, though, I would stick with the classic can of cream-of-mushroom soup instead of the complicated base here (though the sherry was a nice touch!).

This is a fantastic recipe, especially when you add what others' suggested. We used 3 cans of tuna (sping water was fine), shells (but next time we're trying potatoes), and salad croutons (crushed).

My 16 year old daughter requested this dish over the weekend, so to find it, a-searching the recipe data base I went. This recipe is all it is advertized and more. Following the lead of a couple of the other reviewers listed here, I also took some liberties with the recipe. I didn't want to go to the store on Monday evening so I adlibbed a bit. I doubled the amount of tuna as was suggested. Then I substituted Marsala wine for the sherry, used purple onion instead of what was specified and finally, instead of flat noodles, I used up the contents of several different partially empty pasta boxes from the pantry. I think I ended up with a combination of rotelli and the little tubes, what ever they are called, plus some bow-ties in the casserole dish. Well, the it came out superbly and my daughter and her friends all seconds. Me too. Their only comment was that I should have added a third can of tuna. The dish was moist, very flavorful and not as heavy as some of the cream based casseroles of my mother's era. I will definitely make this again.

What a great recipe to build upon; doubled the meat- 1 can tonno/1 can lump crab for a delicate alternative. added fresh-torn parsley, rosemary + thyme into butter melt - (Cabot unsalted). dashed white cooking wine into broth/rue mixture. Used Tamari instead of Soy Sauce. Dashed asian fish sauce here an there. Let a curse out. Medium-size semolina shells (sauce holders)instead of gooey egg noodles. Crushed up boxed salad croutons for breading, held back on amount called for. What can I say, wish I had ya' over, ate half of it already, giving other half to sister tomorrow. Seasoned with a cajun mix. What next? Capers!

Absolutely delicious! Instead of the Chicken Broth, I used Amy's Organic Cream of Mushroom soup. Less flour was needed, & I also added peas. The combination of fresh mushrooms, sherry and onion along with Tuna packed in olive oil make this dish outstanding... I used soda cracker crumbs, olive oil and cheddar for the topping. Pretty hard to make this dish taste bad!

As written, this is surprisingly deficient in the tuna component. One can of tuna for 4-6 servings? How about 3? I also added frozen baby peas and diced red & yellow peppers, and used Panko crumbs blended with low-fat three-cheese blend for the topping. Plain Silk soy milk also worked nicely in the sauce, and it didn't hurt to use a 50/50 combo of butter/oil for the roux.

This is an excellent comfort food recipe! Easy and quick. I like the fact that the cheese is added to the bread crumbs, rather than mixed in with the noodles.

I doubled the tuna, and used portabellas, skim milk, and vegetable broth for semi-substitutions. I further embellished this by adding fresh peas and making my own noodles (with whole wheat flour). I've definitely found my new recipe for TNC. :)

I finally liked a tuna casserole! I did make a few modifications though. I sauteed the onion and mushrooms in olive oil instead of butter, and only used 2 tbsp butter in the roux. I also added frozen peas before baking and I skipped the topping entirely. This had good flavor and I will definitely make it again.

this took a while, so make it with a friend to reduce time, otherwise i might have considered buying cream of mushroom soup. however, i tasted it 3/4 of the way thru, and it gave a warm hug only comfort food provides. i subbed hungarian tokaji aszu (dessert wine)for the sherry, and ponzu in place of soy sauce. sprinkled a little mexican oregano ontop just before baking, and used two cans of tuna instead of one for more meat. used little ripped pieces of french bread for topping. used regular macaroni (1/2 ditali, 1/2 mini pene)instead of egg noodles. added a few generous dashes of creole seasoning during final correction. serving with a mesculn salad, wine & french bread.

This was a yummy dinner. I even made it with those awful lo-carb noodles and three cans of tuna to increase the protein, and it was still terrific. It seemed flavorful to us.

This is always a hit with my boyfriend and friends. I've substituted sherry with cognac and had fabulous results. I use portabella mushrooms too and to add more taste, pepper. I only gave it 3 forks because I don't really care for the topping. It stands on it's own without it. As my one of my guests said this past weekend, "this isn't the tuna casserole you dread eating. This is really good."

Followed recipe except I increased the amount of soy sauce and Sherry. It was delicious - not dry and not bland.

Good casserole. It could have used just a little more flavor. I subbed marsala for sherry - that may have messed with the flavor. I'll make it again but probably add a little something extra for flavor.

Tastes good, but took a long time to make. I prefer the Tuna Noodle Casserole w/Mushrooms and Fresh Herbs recipe, minus 3 T butter.

This is a GREAT tuna casserole. Great comfort food. I didn't have sherry, so I used a splash of whiskey and I used reduced fat milk. Also added an additional can of tuna and used the tuna in water instead of oil.

Rating: 3
This probably is the best Tuna and Noodle casserole I have ever had or made. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly - only I used a 12oz jar of home canned Albacore. This will be my new Tuna and Noodle recipe - the canned soup recipe is out-a-here!

Rating: 3
I made this a two-pot dish - I made the sauce in the same pan as the one used to sauté the onion & mushrooms as well as to bake the casserole. My father-in-law who does not eat tuna noodle casserole due to a bad experience had seconds. I'll definitely make this again (being a tuna-noodle-casserole-lover myself).

Satisfying comfort food that doesn't come from a box?! Sign me up!!! Don't be daunted by the three pan and a casserole dish issue. This recipe with a little planning can be done in a little amount of time Think about making the roux in the same pan you sauteed the mushrooms in - now you're using two pots and a casserole dish. Bump up the milk with half and half to taste - 30 minutes for a great dish. I'll make this again and again.

After making this numerous times I decided that I should let everyone know that this is THE BEST Tuna and Noodle casserole; please give it a try! Even my husband, who doesn't like Tuna and Noodles, loves it. I agree, it takes many pans and extra time but it is well worth it! I use two cans of tuna; it makes the dish heartier. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

This was really delicious. It was a hit with both my husband and two toddlers. I made a double batch and froze half of it which worked out great. Make enough for leftovers because it is even better the second day. Unfortunately it takes a long time and a lot of pans to make this, so I will probably not make it again.

My husband and I loved this dish! It is the best tuna noodle casserole either of us has had. We will definately make this again. Just be sure to give yourself enough time, it took me longer than I thought it would to prepare (but was definately worth the wait).

i have never liked tuna fish but my husband does. i decided to make this for him and i couldn't believe that i liked it too. i've made it 3 times now and it is a great recipe, another good tuna recipe i found is the pan bagnat from bon appetit.

Good tune casserole recipe. I also doubled the tuna and added some extras (red pepper, dill, parsley, etc.). I disagree with some other reviewers, I don't think it was that labor intensive, pretty quick actually. I will certainly make this again.

This is my new favorite comfort dish! We use less butter and substitute skim milk. And when available we add some matsutaki mushrooms. My friends love this dish and always ask for it.

not good. very bland. this may be a personal problem since i am asian and tend to like my food with plenty of flavor. i could only swallow this with a side serving of sweet chilli sauce and plenty of lemon juice squeezed on top, and even with the addition of those i couldn't finish my serving. those who have not been brought up with this 'comfort food' may want to stay away!

The dish tastes okay, but I agree with the reviews who say that it is too much work for a so so recipe.

I never grew up with Tuna casserole but it sounded like a good comfy food so Idecided to to try it out one rainy day. I tried this recipe and loved it, had to use brandy instead of sherry but it turned out really tasty. I can't compare it to the original with mushroom soup but we love it.

Rating: 3
This is a bit of work, but considerably better results than the can of mushroom soup method. It needs at least twice the quantity of tuna and, in my opinion, something to make it a bit lighter. Still, we licked the bowl.

Rating: 3
This dish IS worth the extra effort. I will gladly spend an hour chopping and stirring and sauteeing if this is the end result. If time's an issue, make it on the weekend. But this stuff is GOOD! The sherry adds an excellent layer of flavor to the mushrooms and the casserole itself. This is inifinitely better than the Tuna Helper you get in a box at the grocery store. Good comfort food!

I've made this several times and it is better than most casserole recipes that I've seen but it's STILL tuna noodle casserole.

Surprisingly good. I substituted zucchini for the mushrooms, since I didn't have the latter, and maccheroni for the egg noodles. I think I spiced it up a bit as well. It was a hit, and even better the following day for lunch.

WOW!!! I would make this dish for company!! I doubled the tuna.

This has replaced my old tuna casserole recipe- It has a "grown up" taste mixed with such a familiar dish. I love it! My husband doesn't even complain when I make this instead of his mother's! & I LOVE that it doesn't use some cream of something soup like most tuna casserole recipes...

Enjoyed this dish VERY MUCH! My 12 yr old kept asking for more "chicken" (he's NOT a tuna eater). I substituted plain yogurt for the milk for lactose intolerant family member. I also topped with crushed potato chips & no cheese. A winner!!

I don't understand people saying this is "time consuming"; it takes under half an hour to make. I added a second can of tuna; to save time used already shredded cheddar, a container of already chopped onions, already sliced mushrooms (used 12 oz.) fat-free 12 & 1/2 instead of milk, and jazzed it up a bit with a 1/4 tsp. of Old Bay seasoning mix, 1 TB. dried parsley and 1/2 tsp. dried dill. Only 3 pans are used, how hard can it be??

I would make this again but add more seasoning to the sauce. It was just to bland.

Rating: 1
THis recipe is not worth the work. If you have extra time on your hands and want to go the extra effort for the fun of it, then give this recipe a try. Frankly, though, using the modified recipe using canned soup will take you less than half the time and the results will be as nice if not better. The sauce in this recipe isreally not all that tasty. I am an avid cook and try a lot of new recipes. This one simply does not make the cut.

I have made this recipe using canned chicken, equally as good as using the tuna. This is a great alternative to tuna casserole for those of you who don't appreciate the canned soup kinds. I prepared this dish in 30 minutes, and served it with fresh french bread. It's easy and so delicious.

Rating: 3
I really like this dish. Yum!!! Great for a cool autumn day. Because I didnt have chicken stock, I used a can of Cream of Chicken Soup and a cup of nonfat milk and it turned out fine. All in all, very good. However, it is a bit time consuming to make.

Rating: 3
This was quite tasty. However, like others next time I will add another can of tuna and some green peas.

Rating: 3
I would absolutely make this again. Sometimes you just feel like real comfort food and this is it. I added some paprika and dry mustard for a bit of added flavour, plus one of my favourite parts of tuna casserole is green peas - so I added a handful of those too! The top was so lovely and crunchy - both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this.

Rating: 1
While I take the point that this is old fashioned comfort food and (as one reviewer put it) "anti-gourmet", I found the end result bland. I'd prefer something with a bit more "oomph"... perhaps more lemon, or herbs or even some mustard would help. The sauce is tasty on its own but looses its punch when combined with the pasta.

Rating: 3
Just made this for dinner and it was very good! A bit time consuming, but it helps if you have everything preped ahead of time. After sauteing the onion mixture, I used my Le Cruset for the sauce then just mixed everything in there and put it right into the oven, so one less dish to wash. I also added an extra can of tuna and lots of s+p and some nutmeg as well. I'm sure leftovers for lunch will be good as well!

Rating: 4
This recipe is wonderful! Very flavourful! Add a little ground nutmeg to the cheese topping to bring out the flavor (nutmeg is used in other cheese recipes such as fondue and suffle for the same purpose). I used sharp cheddar and parmeasan cheese--it was great. If you want the Tuna taste to stand out, you could add a second can ( I used solid tuna in water and added some olive oil). I'll be making this again and again!:)

This was ok. Not that hard or time consuming to make, but for the amount of effort, it kinda tasted like cream of chicken to me.

A tad time consuming to make on a weeknight, but a good meal for a weekend. Excellent flavor and will surely make again.

This is a little more time consuming for what the results offer, but it is a good choice to make if you're hankering for tuna noodle casserole. As much as this trys to jazz up an old favorite, it still pretty much tastes like what most of us grew up on.

Rating: 4
Delicious casserole I'll prepare again and again. Much better than the "fast food" soup version, with all its additives. My husband loved the crispy, cheesy topping. A comfort food, that tastes good direct from the oven or reheated the next day...if anything remains after dinner. I'm not a tuna lover...but love this dish. A comfort food that harkens to simpler times.

Sorry to go against the flow BUT the Sherry did nothing good for this. Just the reverse is true. My husband took two bites and put it in the disposal then made a bowl of corn flakes for dinner. Back to the "unimproved" version for me.

this was great comfort food. i made it in a half hour- you just have to keep your eye on everything at once. it tasted great & hit the spot. it's replacing my mother-in-law's tuna casserole recipe, & i plan on using the roux for other things as well!

If this recipe seems too time consuming, I would suggest another from Epicurious: Farfalle and Tuna Casserole. We've used Classico's alfredo, which doesn't have any bad stuff in it. It's yummy (can't believe I've said that about tuna casserole) and quick/easy enough for a weeknight meal. URL to recipe: http://food.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=106324

This is a tasty, hearty and easy dish. Perfect for picky eaters or to take to a potluck. I followed the recipe pretty much. The only changes I made were to use 2cans of Albocore and I also put in some thyme and marjoram. I will definately make this one again.

Excellent dish. I think next time I'll add peas and cashews like my Mom added to her tuna noodle casserole.

I added some fresh green beans which added a pleasant crunch. Overall, delicious, easy recipe... however you will have lots of dishes to wash afterwards. This will become a regular dish in my home.

Loved it! My family looked at me funny when I told them we were having Tuna Noodle Casserole for dinner, and even snickered when we sat down. But they happily polished off the whole dish and said it was really great. I added an extra can of tuna, some peas and seasoned to taste with salt and pepper, those are the only variations I made to this recipe.

People that dismiss this recipe as "simplistic" or "old-fashioned" are missing the point. This is comfort food, and invokes food memories. My mother made tuna noodle casserole with Kraft Mac 'n Cheese, a can of tuna, and frozen peas. It was fast and good (believe it or not), AND it allowed our family to sit down together and eat on a weeknight. I like doing something interesting and different as a cook as much as anyone (FYI: don't try to make your own tamarind juice), but simple can be good and sometimes the best. Create your own signature dish to pass on to your kids. Mine is Poppy-seed Chicken, but I'm not sharing.... :)

Ah, the tuna casserole! In my mind this is anti-gourmet, passionless, and a throw-back to the days when women had the meal on the table promptly at 6 PM - right after greeting husbands at the door with slippers, the newspaper and a martini.

this is great comfort food, much better than what I grew up on, only thing... dirtys up alot of dishes.

If you want fast stick to the can of mushroom soup. But you can speed this recipe up by multitasking. I started the water and the onions at the same time. While the onions were sautéing I sliced the mushrooms. When I added the mushrooms to the onions I started the roux. The mushrooms and noodles were done before the béchamel, so I did the topping and drained the tuna. When the sauce was done I mixed it all together. I also agree with the extra can of tuna and added some white pepper, garlic powder, and celery salt.

This is a keeper...even my teenage son enjoyed it!

My mother made this casserole in New England where I grew up too and it was one of my my favorite meals. She did not use bread crumbs though - she used potato chips crumbled up. You can also use solid white albacore tuna and use 2 cans instead of one for a meatier main meal. Works well with leftover thanksgiving turkey chopped up instead of tuna.

The whole idea of tuna casserole is quick and easy. This recipe is not. I cook my noodles and heat everything else in the microwave. I add black olives, mushrooms, frozen peas-heat with tuna and mushroom soup, then I add the noodles. Dinner is served.

I could tell from the ingredients it was going to be a bit bland so I added extra flavor where I could. I used crimini mushrooms, I added some fresh thyme, lots of fresh cracked pepper and also some frozen peas, all of which complemented the dish well. I didn't have any sherry on hand so I used white wine instead, that seemed to work fine. I also used Japanese Panko breadcrumbs (found in boxes in the Asian section of the supermarket) for extra texture and crunch. After it came out of the oven I sprinkled some finely chopped flat leaf parsley on top for color. Overall, this turned out to be a pretty classy version of a tuna casserole. To save a little on cleanup, I added the butter/flour/broth directly into the same pan with the mushrooms, instead of using a separate pan as the recipe states. This seemed to work just fine. Looks like this is a recipe that you could make quite a few variations on and still have it turn out nicely.

This was well worth all the clean up and time needed to make. Absolutely delicious. The only weakness of the recipe is that there just isn't enough tuna. Next time I make it I'll try adding two cans.

Made this recipe today and both my husband and I loved it. Didn't have any mushrooms on hand and used canned peas which were just fine. It was a lot of cleanup, though, too many pots and pans.I will make it again.

So much better than the can of mushroom soup version. Even my husband liked it and he hates tuna!
