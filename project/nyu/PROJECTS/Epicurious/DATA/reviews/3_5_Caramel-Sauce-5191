Great as is also fantastic with a splash of whiskey when you're adding the cream.

I have made lots of different caramel sauces over the years but had printed this one out a long time ago and never tried...unfortunately I ended up with a runny version of a sweet sauce...no stickness at all. Recycling this one :-(

No burnt taste here! Absolutely delicious and perfect with the Rustic Apple Tart. A keeper in my book!

This was a perfect basic caramel sauce recipe. I couldn't stop eating it. Perfect on pouched pears and over ice cream.

I'm with the folks who ended up with the burnt taste. I am not a novice cook - I've made other caramel sauces with great success, to the point where I literally licked the pan clean. But this one did not come out good for me. I realize it's mostly my own fault - I should have listened to earlier reviewers who mentioned the burnt taste and suggested taking it off the heat the moment it turned golden - but I'm a caramel LOVER and thought that I should just do what the recipe says, and let it go to dark amber. Take my advice - DON'T! Take it off the heat at golden, not amber. The burnt taste is simply unpleasant, and it ruined my dessert. Another tip: I ended up making this twice, and the first attempt was an even greater failure. The recipe says to turn the heat up after the sugar dissolves, but it doesn't say how high. The first time I made this I only turned up to just above medium...and it never did turn any color at all! All the water cooked right out, and the sugar turned into dry, clumpy crystals. I tossed that, and started over, this time turning the heat to high. That got it to amber, without crystallizing...but I guess I let it cook too long. There are better, easier caramel sauces out there.

Fabulous sauce, always a big hit. Covering the boiling sugar for 3 minutes lets the steam wash down any crystals. I would love to add some molasses to this for flavor, but can't figure out how to watch the color properly -- does anybody have a suggestion?

I got a little gun-shy after reading the reviews about the burnt taste, so I removed the sauce from the burner a little early (light amber). In retrospect, I would have made it a little darker, but it was still absolutely delicious!

Classic caramel sauce. I made two batches back to back because I felt the first one was not quite dark enough. Neither of mine tasted burnt. Both thickened nicely when cooled. A few tips...1 - Use a light colored pan so you can see the color change clearly. 2 - When it starts to color, watch it constantly because it will turn darker quickly at this point. 3 - Use your nose...when you think it JUST might be starting to burn, throw that butter in and start stirring! As soon as the butter is melted, slowly add the cream. Also, if you feel it's too thin, you can always boil it for a minute or two after the cream is added and it will evaporate a little more without burning. Hope that helps.

Easy, tasty, classic. Yes, tastes a little burnt, but then real caramel does (made mine to a nice, rich amber). Consistency was good for my tastes.

great fall dessert. Plenty of leftover sauce to use up during the week was great with Apple Galette as well as ice cream.

Awesome sauce. I thought this was perfect with the apple galette. Guests were vying to see who would get to take home left overs.

I agree with the reviewer who noted a burnt taste to this sauce, but I think the taste is fabulous! Delicious on lots of desserts.

Aaah! Apparently MY idea of 'dark amber' is darker than THEIR idea of 'dark amber'. I wish the recipe provided a temperature. My caramel sauce tastes vaguely burnt. Just a heads-up, stop while it's still a bit golden. I think I shall call this batch 'burnt butter caramel sauce'.... heh heh

This is a classic, easy caramel sauce - a favourite topping for many desserts. Will thicken as it cools. Always gets raves.

This is a very rich and delicious caramel sauce and is perfect for the dried cherry and apple galette. I do find it to be a bit on the thin side when it is quite hot but if allowed to sit a bit it will "set up" and will still be warm enough to drizzle over the galette. Added bonus: there is usually enough left to spoon over vanilla ice cream the next evening!

This recipe looks simple but it is devious. It will always come out thin and it will never have the velvety texture that caramel sauce should have. The cream and the sugar should be brought to temp. at the same time. I wasted two batches on this recipe. Stay away!!! Go to the Coffee Caramel sauce instead.

Mine came out a little thinner than I like so I'll try something else next time.

Fast, easy and delicious. Also great lightly drizzled over cappuccino.
