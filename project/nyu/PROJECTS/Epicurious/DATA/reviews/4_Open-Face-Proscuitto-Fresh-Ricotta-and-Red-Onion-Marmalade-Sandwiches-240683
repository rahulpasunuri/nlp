Easy and good. Substituted Robusto cheese for the ricotta and deglazed the onions with vermouth. Four cups of onions was way too much. Used vidalias which negated using brown sugar,

Question: The onions didn't really make a marmalade in the sense of fruit with viscous liquid holding it together. It was more like flavoursome caramelized onions, but no marmalade. Did I do something wrong? Great flavour though!

Makes a very tasty and delightful open-face sandwich. I also put the prosciutto under the broiler to have it crispen a little. This would be good for hor d'oeuvres.

The combination of salt, sweet, and spice is phenomenal. My husband and I really enjoyed these sandwiches.

This has now become my most favorite sandwich - yummy!! The only change I make is to place the prosciutto on a cookie sheet and "crisp" in the oven as the bread is becoming crusty - it adds a bit more flavor and some texture. Truly a heavenly sandwich.

This had now become my favorite sandwich - I just placed the prosciutto under the broiler for a few seconds to add a crispy texture and served on toasted split ciabatta. The flavors are scrumptious......Yummm

Just made this recipe for a quick but fancy lunch and it was fantastic! The ricotta works great with the prosciutto and the marmalade is delish! I did kick up the red pepper a bit because I like some extra spice, but other than that, perfect.

Just terrific. The onions especially are great--I will use the onion recipe for other purposes. But the combination of the creamy ricotta, sweet onions, and salty prosciutto is great. This is a real keeper.

This was excellent! I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added parsley to the ricotta, and also added freshly minced garlic! Made extra of all the ingredients and I used the ricotta mixture as a sandwich spread for other great meals!

This was so easy and simple! I love anything with caramelized onions for two reasons: They taste good, and you can clean up the mess you've already made while they're cooking!

This was okay, but after just making two other onion sandwich appetizers, this was my least favorite. I think it would be great if you used goat cheese instead of the ricotta. I'll try that. Two others that are wonderful - Toasted Blue Cheese and Carmelized Onion...and Grilled Bread Topped with Arugula, Goat Cheese,....both on this site. Try them instead.

Very tasty. I kept the caramelized onions in the fridge for other creations in the following days and it made every following sandwich quite tasty. Very rich, could use some more veggies. Looking forward to making again.

So good. I made the marmalade a few days in advance, so I could have a quick weeknight supper. And I piled the sandwich goods atop split baguette halves. We'll definitely make this one again.

This was delicious. The onions take a while - cooked longer than they said as i like them REALLY caramelized. But we loved it...i'm making again tomorrow.

This was incredible, even my picky boyfriend devoured it. The spice from the red pepper and the sweetness of the onions,was fantastic. I fried panchetta to add a bit of cripyness and it was perfect. I will definitely be making again.

I have made this several times on tasted baguette rounds for parties. Everyone RAVES. I have substituted pancetta and even applewood bacon, and it turns out great every time!

I love love love this recipe! My boyfriend who hates onions loved this recipe. I took the advice of fellow foodies and added thyme and one granny smith apple to the onions and parsley to the ricotta. I also added a bit more sugar to the marmalade as well. This looked great with all the vibrant but rich colors! Perfect for a Sunday afternoon relaxing at home with a bottle of red wine!

This was surprisingly filling and just as quick and easy as promised. I added some herbs to both the onion mixture and ricotta mixture, thyme to the onions and fresh parsley to the ricotta and found the entire thing to be very delicious. A great dinner, to be sure.

I thought this was wonderful and quite simple. I'm not even a big onion fan and I liked it. It might work even better in small form on toasted baguette slices so you could eat the whole thing at once. It tended to fall apart on a larger slice of bread.

Made for supper served along with a salad. While good thought the flavors were too sweet for an evening meal. The red onion marmalade was easy and delish...will try using for a simple hors d'oeuvre of toasted baguette with goat cheese & the onion marmalade.

These were great I added a couple of thinly sliced granny smith apples to the marmalade. Delicious.

I served this to my husband and his friends after golfing and before wine tasting. It got rave reviews. Everyone said they were was skeptical about the ricotta cheese before tasting it, but it made the sandwich light and delicious! I served it with a roasted red pepper and tomato soup. It couldn't have been better!
