LOVED IT! I used the 2 full pounds of potatoes that I had. I thought this was a lot of oil and a lot of salt (I adjusted proportionately), so I cut back on both and it was perfect. I was too lazy to grate the lemon peel, so I only put in the lemon juice. It's not that the finished product tastes like lemon as a result, it's just that it has this great flavor, kind of like the flavor that you sometimes taste on great food at restaurants and wonder how you can get it into your own cooking!

Family enjoyed this recipe! I paired it with the broccoli with lemon and red pepper flakes that is also from this site.

Followed exactly, and loved the results. A good accompaniment for fish. The addition of minced fresh herbs with the lemon would be a good addition too.

Pretty good, but could use more lemon flavor. I also added parsley.

I used all of the ingredients and followed the directions and these are the best roasted potatoes I've ever made. They were crispy and juicy. This will definitely be in my recipe arsenal.

I added rosemary. Fabulous!

This recipe is a good base, but there's not really too much FLAVOR to it...it could use a little kick.

Very good - just don't go overboard on the lemon peel/juice since it can overwhelm the potatoes pretty easily.

I liked the lemon flavor, but after cooking as directed (at the same time as the strata from the menu, so couldn't wait any longer), the potatoes weren't crisp, and they seemed a little oily. My husband said that he likes them better soft anyway, but he may have just been trying to make me feel better.

Not spectacular, but good. The lemon gives a nice tang and it couldn't be easier to prepare.
