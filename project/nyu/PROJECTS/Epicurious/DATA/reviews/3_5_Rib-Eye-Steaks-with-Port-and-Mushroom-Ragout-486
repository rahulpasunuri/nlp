I've been trying for ages to recreate the Portuguese style steaks I ate in Lisbon and came across this recipe. I'd experimented a little before and knew that the sauce I'd had in Portugal was brandy, not Port, based, so I made that simple substitution and it was 100% dead-on perfect. My Portuguese husband loved it so much he was sopping up the sauce with bagels when he ran out of bread.

One reviewer suggested using bleu cheese instead of cream, so I gave that a try and it was fantastic. Zinfandel worked better than Port (Port's too sweet for steak, I think) but makes it a purply color. Delicious on grilled steaks!

Easy and incredibly tasty ... like others here, I used goat cheese instead of cream, with good results.

Very enjoyable, especially with a green salad as a side.

This recipe is fantastic! It's delicious and easy.It certainly can be used on many kinds of meats with great results. Like other reviewers, my sauce didn't get as syrupy as it should, but it didn't matter.I just simmered it a little longer when it was added to the cream and it was fine. This is really a "must try!"

This recipe was great. The mushrooms were fabulous, even given the fact that I used a pound of ordinary white mushrooms that I already had in the refrigerator. Will definitely try it with a wild variety next time, which can only make it better! I only had two shallots on hand, so used half an onion and added a couple of cloves of minced garlic to the shallots. Because the steaks and ragout are cooked separately, the steaks could be grilled just as easily as pan seared. Delicious - can't wait to make this again!

I served the steak over hashed browns, and then I toped with the ragout. I might try a substitute for the beef broth. I am also thinking of trying the ragout over baked red and gold potatoes.

Mmmmm. The only thing I changed was to not boil the mushrooms with the liquid; I removed them to a plate and added them back after reducing the stock and port. I used chicken stock and it was fine. I might add garlic next time and try finishing it with blue cheese instead of cream.

Excellent with any type of unsauced steak. Use more if you want a combination sauce/vegetable side dish, or increase the liquid ingredients if you like a lot of sauce with your steak. I used portabellos, and top sirloin steaks.

I have made this dish at least four times for assorted people and gotten rave reviews each time. The ragout is amazing.

Very good! Used a good red wine instead of the port and it was fine. If you liked this, you might also want to try the Veal Rib Eye with Ragout of Pearl Onions, Peas and Artichokes from this website (we made it with beef rib-eye steaks instead of veal, and have also made it with pork), it's incredible and surprisingly "under-reviewed".

This dish was pretty easy to make. The sauce was too sweet for my taste! I was expecting a more rich flavor. I didn't like it.

I have been making this recipe for years. All of our friends absolutely love the mushroom ragout! It's sn easy recipe to serve for guests.

Since everyone raves about this recipe, I feel a bit guilty saying it was just alright. Maybe my tastebuds weren't functioning correctly. My guests all said they loved the ragout.

I had only one type of mushrooms (portabella) so chopped them up finely. That part of the recipe was fine but I'd like to try the different types of mushrooms too. I also only had ruby port; that substitution didn't work out quite so well. In combination with the tarragon, it made the sauce a wee bit on the sweet side. I will try it again with a nice shiraz, as suggested, though.

Great rich flavor, easy to make. I used shiraz wine instead of port. I also used Cajun spice as a rub for the steak (about 1 hour), you won't be disappointed!

I would suggest to anyone making this recipe. 1. Let the mushrooms chill in the sauce for at least a few hours to soak in more flavor. 2. The sauce does not become "syrupy" as I would define it. It does get thicker, I would say keep boiling it until the sauce boils up and not a second more.3. Do try to get all four mushrooms listed in the recipe for different tastes and textures. I made this for my husband and father. My husband, didn't like the ragout, but he has a problem with trying new things. My father literally inhaled the mushrooms, scraping them right off of my husbands ribeye! I savored every bite of mine. Next time I might try grilling the steaks though and then putting the mushrooms over it. I highly recommend this ragout to everybody!

Sorry, this didn't work for me. The liquid never got syrupy. All directions were followed exactly but it simply was disappointing.

I tried this recipe and it was SUPER! Most of my guests loved it! Try it yourself to taste it first hand.

Instead of rib-eye steaks I used the mushroom ragout as a side dish with grilled filet mignon. The musrooms were a huge hit with my guests.
