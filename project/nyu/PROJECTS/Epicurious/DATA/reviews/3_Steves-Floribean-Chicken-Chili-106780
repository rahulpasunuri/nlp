My husband thought it was very good but I didn't care for the sweet flavor. If I made it again, I'd leave out the molasses. But likely I'd try a different recipe, try something a little bit lighter in flavor, to match the chicken. Here, seems like chicken just replaces beef or pork in a traditional red chili.

Great flavor. I used 3 1/2 lbs of chicken breast instead of thighs. That made it a thick meaty chili and all my co-workers loved it. They are asking me for more. Love the coriander flavor.

This recipe was very good and flavorful. I did add an extra can of crushed tomatoes and an additional 1 cup of the stock because it just looked like a bunch of ingredients in a pot. The very long list of ingredients was intimidating, but not really too big a deal in the long run. Great with homemade corn bread and a beer!
