Tasty, easy, economical, and kid-friendly. We used kalamata olives and served it over bulgar, which worked well. Next time I may use a smaller dice for the vegetables to make the sauce a bit less chunky.

Easy and economical, I probably won't make it again though I don't regret that we tried it. The sauce was good over rice.

This recipe has a lot of good things going for it... cheap, quick and easy, and dirties minimal cooking dishes. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, it's also really tasty! The light spicing of the ground meat and a very pleasing sauce make this a real winner. I served it over noodles, but I think it'd work as well over almost any type of pasta or rice, or even on toast as an open faced sandwich.
