This was delicious--used Whole Foods dough, prosciutto & sprinkled with arugula when out of the oven. Wow!

Delicious! The best pizza I've made from a recipe. I did not saute anything - just thinly sliced the mushrooms and coarsely chopped the pancetta and put it on the pizza and it turned out great. I did use a store bought dough I like though. The fontina definitely added depth and flavor so don't leave it out.

Yum... Made the dough with half whole-wheat, half all-purpose flour, and subbed ham for the pancetta, as I'm not the biggest fan... Man I LOVE fontina.

Awesome recipe! Sauteed the mushrooms and then crumbled some Italian sausage into the pan along with the pancetta. Topped the pizza with some arugula after it came out of the oven. I agree with everyone else about the salt...be careful not to overdo it. I omitted the salt altogether and just sprinkled the pizza with pepper before putting it in the oven.

Made this for dinner the other night... and wow, it was very tasty. As others indicated, I sauteed the pancetta and mushrooms before putting on the pizza and also added some fresh basil and Italian parsley. Next time I would add a few crushed red peppers. I ate 2-pieces the next day, cold, and it was just as good.

This was a delicious pizza! Just like others suggested, I sauteed the mushrooms and the pancetta beforehand. Also, I used more mushrooms (8oz) and pancetta (1/3 lb) than the recipe called for--the amounts in the recipe were too small for the size of my two pizzas. Beware of salting the pizza--the cheeses and the pancetta are quite salty. I used no other salt and it was on the salty side. Made it for a superbowl party and it was a huge hit with kids and adults alike. Will definitely make again.

Really enjoyed this. Used Whole Foods whole-wheat pizza dough and a nice organic brand of pizza sauce. Also took other reviewers' advice and sauteed the mushrooms before adding them to the pizza. I think another time I'd use prosciutto instead of pancetta, which was mostly fat and very little salty flavor. All in all, though, a great, easy, tasty pizza.

I just made this using Whole Foods pre made dough, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It was delicious, and made the house smell divine. I will try making the dough next time.

YUM! This is my favorite pizza recipe. I love the combination of the cheeses with the salty pancetta and earthy crimini mushrooms. The pizza dough recipe is the easiest and tastiest I've tried and always bakes up nice and golden. I try to make this at least once a month.

Very good pizza although I like my pizza extra thin and could not get my dough thin enough-not the recipes fault! Anyway, would add a lot more pancetta next time-but very easy and different. Fixed it for a football game party when no one wanted to grill..

Wow! I used to work at a FANTASTIC pizza place in DC - 2AMY's - where they serve authentic Italian pizza's - When I made this recipe it brought be back there - I wish there was room in my stomach for more! I added a bit more cheese and some more pancetta for my husband (Who's a meat freak). The directions say to salt and pepper the pizza before it goes in - I didn't do this - and wouldn't. The pancetta is so salty already. Someone commented that the pizza was too thin - no way - excellent and not too crispy if you take it out around 12 - 13 minutes.

I had a lot of trouble with the dough but the final result was delicious. I will definitely be making this again.

Better than pizza joints! I made the dough recipe, and forgot the olive oil, but it was still fantastic. Also, used turkey bacon instead of pancetta, as it is what I had on hand. Will make many more times with different toppings. I think the parchment paper made a huge difference, allowing a crispy texture to the crust.

Excellent! Wouldn't change a thing, except for adding more toppings if desired.

All of my friends & neighbors rave about our pizza parties & it all started with this recipe! Use Giada's dough recipe & set out a buffet of ingrediants for your guests to choose from. Add olives, pineapple, basil,garlic, & whatever else you can think of. Pop it in the oven for 15 minutes & voila! So much fun!

A terrific recipe! I use a pizza stone in the oven and used Giada's dough recipe too. Both recipes are keepers! Have already made this many times since the March Bon Appetit came out.

Fabulous. The best pizza receipe I've ever eaten. I will make this again and again. I also used the Whole Foods pizza crust. A big time saver! The blend of cheese is magic!

This is one of my favorite pizza recipes! I usually cheat and use fresh pizza dough from Whole Foods Market, though, rather than make Giada's dough recipe. Recently I've begun cooking this on the grill instead of the oven and it's sensational!

This was wonderful and will make often. I used pizza dough from Trader Joe's. It was a hit when served fresh from the oven. Very quick prep when using store pizza dough. Yummy!!!!

I don't see what the fuss is about. The dough was very simple to make, but not great. I won't make it again. Also, the topping was just ok. Big disappointment.

I'm a complete spazz with pizza dough. I knew it wouldn't come out quite right, and I was correct. However, this combination of toppings was really great. A definite keeper.

Wonderful recipe. Be sure to roll the dough to 13 1/2 X8. The first time I made it I thought it would be too thin so I did not roll it out all the way. It puffed up quite a bit in the oven and was too chewy. The second time I made it exactly as written and it was perfect.

I bought refrigerated pizza dough because it is soooo easy. We spread the dough in one 10 X 15 baking sheet. The flavor of this pizza is so authentic. My husband and I just loved it.

This dough, when divided per the instructions, does result in VERY THIN (1/4 inch) crusty pizzas. It was good, but I would consider it more of a crust for an appetizer type pizza. That said, it had the texture of a "brick oven style" which I liked. Also, I liked the idea of using the parchment paper on a baking sheet - the bottom really browned and crisped well. Next time, I might use the whole dough for 1 pizza instead of dividing to see if I get the crispy but thicker pizza I was looking for. One question, though, why is this recipe slightly different from her pizza recipes on the Food Network website???

1st time making my own pizza crust. It turned out to be easy and ended up thin and crispy and yet tender. I added a couple of italian turkey sausages that I had in addition to the other ingredients. Next time I will up the quantities of the cheese and pancetta and also tinker with the sauce. I briefly sauteed the pancetta and mushrooms to render some of the fat and to insure the bacon was crispy and the mushrooms were cooked. This recipe is definately is in the do again file.

We loved this - I've never used yeast and this was easy and fun to make. The pizza was delicious - we will make it again and again.

I'd never made pizza from scratch until this issue arrived and I've now made it 3 times in the past 4 weeks! Love, love the crispy crust. Subbed a homemade tomato sauce once which was wonderful, but used jarred sauce with good results, too. The pizza dough freezes well (I've got 3 pies worth in my freezer right now)...just put it in the fridge in the morning and by supper time it's ready to roll (pardon the pun). Now homemade pizza is an easy weeknight dinner. Who'd have thought? Looking forward to experimenting with other toppings but the pancetta and mushrooms is hard to beat.

Finally! After trying so many pizza recipes this was the one that worked! It's easy, delicious and you are able to change toppings and cheeses to suit your taste. The pizza dough is especially good.

Awesome dish! However, I used Fontinella cheese, instead of Fontina, and i must say that it was very good!

I've made many pizzas before, but this one is so simple and so divine. The combination of cheeses has the right amount of sharpness and the pancetta and mushrooms complement each other well. I am not a huge fan of jarred sauces..so I did make my owm pizza sauce.

I love this pizza!!! It is so easy to make and tastes delicious!!! Will definately make again and again. Would not change a thing.

This pizza is delicious! I've made it now 2 times this week! It's so good it's adictive! I did use more mushrooms (1/2 of a regular portobello per pizza - way more than the sparce amount pictured), a little more marinara and subed prosciutto for the pancetta. This really is a wonderful recipe that you can tweak to make to your own liking. The crust is easy & this pizza is delicious!!!

This was a hit...Husband and twin 6 year old boys loved it. This was my first time working with yeast and I was a little nervous about it. NO PROBLEMS! Would have liked to have had a recipe for some nice fresh tomato sauce but using the jarred certainly made it a quick and easy recipe.

Hooray! At long last, I am no longer afraid to make my own pizza, no more fear of yeast & dough. This was easy, absolutely delicious, and not heavy. And my 2-year-old inhaled it and asked for more. Was perfect for weeknight dinner -- made the dough on Sunday, bought pre-grated cheeses, so it came together quickly for Monday night dinner. I used Eden Organic Pizza-Pasta Sauce, and that was a tasty complement to Giada's ingredients. This might become a weekly dinner!

As I wrote in my review of the dough recipe, the crust was wonderful. I modified the ingredients a bit on the pizza - used mozzarella, fontina, and feta cheeses. I sauteed sweet onions, mushrooms, and a bit of fresh basil before putting them on the pizzas to bake. One pizza had cooked sausage and crumbled cooked bacon in addition to the onions and mushrooms. The other pizza had the addition of chopped fresh tomatos, crumbled cooked bacon, and prosciutto. My husband and I both LOVED them. Will definitely make again.

Giada comes through again! Love her recipes and this is another winner. I am a big fan and this recipe did not disappoint - I thought pizza dough would be more difficult to handle but this recipe was just perfect.

I knew I had to make this pizza as soon as my issue of Bon Appetit came in the mail. This recipe provided the best results I have ever had making pizza at home. The dough came together perfectly and was very easy to work with. I removed all but one rack from inside my oven, placed it on the very bottom and then heated a pizza stone for 30 minutes at 475. I slide the pizza on parchment from a cookie sheet to the stone and baked according to the directions. The crust was crispy without the toppings being overdone. The combination of the pancetta and three cheeses was sublime. My family is already begging me to make it again.
