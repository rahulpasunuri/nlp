Delicious and easy. Maybe a tad sweet but otherwise the perfect blend of sweet, sour, and hot. Next time I'd make it the day before to ratchet up the flavor.

This is a great sauce, but since it is rather sweet, you must choose it's counterpart wisely. I grilled a salmon filet after I coated it with a paste made with olive oil and black pepper with a dash of the other common blackening spices. This mango sauce was perfect with it.

The honey flavor was too strong and too sweet for me. Maybe less honey or mixing it with another sweetener like maple syrup might tone it down. While it was too sweet on its own, when mixed into a vegetable risotto and served with the grilled lamb chops with 5 spice asian butter sauce, it was perfect!

This chutney was sweet without being an overwhelmingly sugary. I made it to go with the firey shrimp and Indian orzo listed in your recepies. The combination of spicy hot shrimp and sweet chutney blended superbly. I plan to use these two together often.
