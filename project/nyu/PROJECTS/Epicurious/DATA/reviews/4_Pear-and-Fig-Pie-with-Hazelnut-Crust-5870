I was underwhelmed. It did "sound" very delicious. However, the pie was bland and the crust was just okay.

What a fabulous pie! The crust is what makes it so exceptional. And making in a food processor instead of having to cut butter in by hand? Genius! (I'm sure that's not new, but I'm a bit behind the times.) The crust was easier to make than I expected. As for the filling, I found it just a bit too sweet. I added a bit less than 1/2 cup, but I still found it too sugary. If I make it again, I don't think I'll add ANY sugar. I also didn't think the figs added much. I only quartered them, so perhaps if I had cut them up more finely as other cooks suggested I'd like them better. All in all, this is a FANTASTIC recipe, and it would certainly be great for a Christmas dinner or party.

Made this for a birthday dinner - what a treat! The lemon zest is what makes the pie stand out - it's a nice bright flavor to balance the pear and fig sweetness. I second klos08's suggestion to cut the figs more finely - especially if you're using the larger dried figs.

Great recipe, though I made a few changes: used regular pie crust, since we already had some on hand. Also added golden raisins to round out the flavors. I've never made a pie that didn't call for spices, so also added a bit of fresh rosemary (diced very fine), ginger, and allspice. The figs were also very good, but were "too much" flavor in one bite (even though I cut them into sixths instead of fourths). Would chop them more finely next time, and cut down the amount to roughly 2/3 to 3/4 cup. All in all, though, really good. Served it with a tawny port for Christmas eve dessert to rave reviews.

This pie had wonderful flavor and a perfect consistency. It was an excellent choice for a holiday meal. The crust came out well, and I'm a beginner with homemade pie crust.

great pie! I made it just as the recipe said. I was a little concerned that it was too much lemon zest but it mellowed as it baked. Regarding the crust...it was ok, but not worth the extra hassle. Next time I will use a standard crust recipe

This review is for the hazelnut crust only. (I used the filling from the other epicurious recipe entitled "Pear, Prune & Fig Pie" because it sounded better to me.) However, I must tell you this is one of the most forgiving crusts I've ever worked with. I made two batches, one with hazelnuts, and one with toasted pecans and they both had a wonderful nutty flavor. The crust was dreamy to roll out and didn't crack or break when transferring to the pie plate. It browned beautifully and was flaky, crisp and tender all at the same time. This crust recipe is a keeper & would be great for a quiche or any other pie recipe!
