Very, very good. I just finished eating this tasty gratin. I did not have marjoram and substituted thyme.

This dish was fantastic! It was great for a chilly fall evening. It does require a bigger pan then stated. I followed the recipe with a few exceptions. I used one bulb of fennel instead of two and was happy with the result, there was plenty of fennel in the dish. Because I try to keep things pretty healthy, I cut the butter in half and I am not sure why you would ever need to the full 41/2 TB. The flavors were complimentary and comforting, highly recommend.

I've done similar dishes before, but this really didn't work out at all. Among other things, it never seemed to fully cook like I expect a gratin to, even with another 40 minutes. I think less fennel, more gorgonzola, and a larger dish might have helped. In any event, I won't be trying this again.

My husband loved it. I wouldn't change a thing except suggest using a different type of pan. I used a corningwear casserole dish. It never would have all fit in a 9x9x2 pan.

This dish was OK. Be sure to use an aged gorgonzola, my choice was too mild. I found this dish overall too mild.
