I found this to be too tart with not enough flavor. To salvage the dish, I sauted red peppers in butter, added some salt and then tossed everything together. I came out much better after adding some complexity.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about it. Several asked for the recipe. Some people said 1 cup of wine was too much, but I found it was just fine. The only change I did was add a little more thyme.

This was so simple and delicious. This dish taste better when you let it sit a day or two, great at room temperature, too. I forgot to add the wine & olives. This will become one of our staple dishes.

I am shocked at how well the flavors in this dish meld. I made exactly as written. Next time I believe I would add more corn to make this more a "veggie" side rather than a starch. Still really good and I can't wait until S NJ corn is in season to try this again!

This was a wonderful mild coucous that was nice paired with beef. I grabbed fennel at the grocery store by accident instead of leeks, and it was delicious! It's not a complicated recipe and our guests loved it.

I found this absolutely awful. The addition of white wine, which I usually adore, made it even worse (I believe 1 cup of wine is too much for that matter). And the use of only one herb (thyme) produces a very empty taste. After having one or two mouthfulls, I threw it in the bin.

Wow. This was awesome, so quick, so easy, so foolproof. My husband, a couscous naysayer, absolutely adored it. Used 1 tsp. of dried thyme instead.

Absolutely great! Used fresh oregano because thyme not available, but still great.

I found out I didn't have couscous and I used whole millet and it turned out pretty good. I think 1 cup of wine is too much, I only used 1/2 and the taste was still pretty strong.

Really nice recipe. Used fresh white corn, so didn't cook it and used dried thyme. Worked great, but if I had fresh would use that. Great taste. Keeps well and reheats great. Tastes wonderful leftovers.

If you eat pasta every night and want a change, this is a good,simple and easy way to get it. You can make this pretty quickly and it tastes and looks good. It's not exactely a dinner party dish, but its tasty and good.
