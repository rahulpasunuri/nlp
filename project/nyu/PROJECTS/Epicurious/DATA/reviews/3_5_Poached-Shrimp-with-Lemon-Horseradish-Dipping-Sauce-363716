Everyone loved this! I agree with another reviewer, make more shrimp, the sauce is great!

Disappointing. I found the sauce to be rather 'blah'. I added the reduced poaching liquid (which took a long time to reduce). Added extra lemon and it still was not very interesting. I also found the shrimp to be tough and I don't think they were overcooked. I usually cook shrimp with a touch of champagne vinegar and a bay leaf ---- much better. Clearly, many people like this recipe, but I won't make it again.

Another crowd pleaser and a great alternative to the usual cocktail sauce. Make extra shrimp because no one wants to toss the sauce! I've made it twice and both times had people asking for the recipe.

I substituted Greek yogurt for the creme fraiche and it was wonderful (and much healthier).

excellent recipe! the dipping sauce is amazing! I honestly don't know why anyone would give this less than 4 forks

Made this for a dinner party of 6. The presentation was wonderfull and the dipping sauce was a big hit. Paired this with a cold, crisp Vidal Blanc. Our guests really appreciated the change up from the "normal" shrimp cocktail that you typicaly get in a restaraunt. Will put this recipe on our "keeper" list!

It really didn't do it for me. I feel like a remoulade would have been better.

I made the dipping sauce only as I was running short on time and it was delicious! I made it another time substituting cilantro for the chives, which was even better! I'm sure adding the reduced poaching liquid would give more depth, but I never make just 8 shrimp. The volume of wine I would need to poach an entire bag of shrimp, I'd rather save to drink!
