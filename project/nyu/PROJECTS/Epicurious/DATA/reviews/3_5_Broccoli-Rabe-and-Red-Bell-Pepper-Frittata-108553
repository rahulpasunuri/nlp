Simple and delicious flavors

Rating: 3
I agree with others; the recipe is simple and delicious! I didn't find broccoli rabe so I ended up using the regular one. I am curious about the taste of the rabe though and will try it next time, and sincerely, I will have to look up on line what it is exaclty. I added orange bell pepper and used olive oil spray instead of the regular tbsps of oil...I used fresh feta cheese and I believe it made a difference!

This was a simple and delicious dish. I am not a cheese connoisseur so I used feta instead which was delicious. For those without an ovenproof skillet - I saw this on a cooking show once and it works for things that will only be under the broiler briefly - wrap the plastic or wooden handle in a couple layers of aluminum foil and your handle will not be damaged by the heat. I reuse the same piece of foil so I'm not wasting foil every time I use this trick - one of these days I'll just buy the darned ovenproof pan!

Wonderfully rich and relatively simple, this is a lovely brunch dish. I fixed it with homemade sausages, and it was a hit. The cheese adds a lot, so don't skip it.

This was very good and colorful. Nice w/a salad for dinner. The rabe was a little to bitter for my taste, but my husband loved it.

Excellent! Great for a weekday dinner. Rabe has a nice taste, milder than I thought it would be.

This is a cook's delight-fast, easy, delicious & waits for your audience! My broiler was on the blink so it became an omelet. The broccoli rabe & GOOD provolone are essential!

This was a delicious dish! Made it for brunch with a few changes. Due to not having an ovenproof skillet, I just sauteed the garlic and onions, then the bell pepper and broccoli rabe. I mixed the rest of the ingredients and just poured it in the pan. Turned it on low and flipped it once it was really set. Great recipe, everyone loved it - definitely added to my recipe book!

This was absolutely delicious and tasted even better room temperature as leftovers for lunch the next day. The key to making sure this doesn't taste bland is to make sure that you go to a cheese shop or specialty market and get really good, aged Italian-style provolone. A lot of what is sold as "provolone" at your average chain supermarket is bland and rubbery and bears no resemblance to real provolone.

This was a good, reasonably healthy meal and was pretty easy to make. The oregano really stood out. I used regular broccoli instead of broccoli rabe since I already had some and it tasted good, though it might have been more interesting with broccoli rabe.

This dish is good, but a little bland for my taste. Perhaps it would be good with artichoke hearts or something to add a little more flavor.

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. Easy to prepare, looks good on the plate and taste beyond compare. Leftovers warmed up nicely in the microwave the next day. I'd give it 5 forks if I could.

I made the recipe as directed and it was very tasty. Be careful that you do not burn the onions and peppers when sauteing!

This was easy to throw together on a weeknight and tasted great. - very filling. I made it a bit simpler by using regular broccoli and fresh marjoram instead of oregano since I had it already, and cheddar cheese. I'm sure you could come up with many satisfying variations.

I made this for a women's book club brunch along with a ham and cheese strata. This frittata was devoured eagerly and even those who claimed not to like broccoli rabe enjoyed it. It came out like something you could get in a restaurant - most impressive for not much work. The dish also stood well - I made it about two hours before we ate it, let it cool, then rewarmed right before eating.

I made this tonight, it was great. I used sharp cheddar since we didn't have provolone but otherwise made it as directed. I really liked the oregano, it gave it an interesting flavor, and the sweet onions & peppers balanced the bitter rabe really well. This one is a crowd-pleaser (just make sure the crowd likes broccoli rabe, some people really dislike it).

I have always enjoyed reading the reviews, but all four people who replied were too busy helping a poor guy who did'nt know what broccoli rabe was! I would like to hear from someone who actually made this dish.

Before attempting this recipe I would have to know what "broccoli rabe" is. I have never heard of it. Can you help me out, anybody? By the way, this is my first response to this site, but I have been enjoying both recipes and comments for some rime.
