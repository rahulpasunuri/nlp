My husband and children loved this recipe! I made a few short cut substitutions. Longustino lobster from Costco, seafood broth instead of clam juice. It was great! I'm making it again tonight.

Excellent! I made this amazing chowder for my husband's birthday. I used fat free half and half in place of the whipping cream. I know, I know, but it was still over the top good! I prepared everythng else per the recipe. I've added it to my soup an stew repertoire.

Made this using crab instead of lobster and it was fantastic. My husband tried it before I added the crab and thought it was great. The seafood only made it more terrific. I did make it the day before serving to allow for some flavor enhancement.

This has the makings of a very good chowder base, but the recipe uses too much chicken stock; better to substitute clam juice and/or lobster stock (easy to make ahead by simmering lobster shells and shrimp shells) and cut down on the amount. In addition, this chowder does not need cayenne; ground black pepper is fine (and more traditional). And I would add thyme instead. Also I recommend cutting down on the cream or using half and half, which I did, and it came out fine. I really like the idea of the corn puree giving some body to this chowder.

I made this back in 2002 and it was fabulous. I substituted crabmeat then, but I'm going to make it again this year with lobster. Definitely a keeper recipe.

Wanted to use lowfat milk and eliminate the sour cream but in the end I followed the recipe and compromised only by sub'ing half and half - still didn't taste as rich and flavorful as I expected. I mean, bacon? lobster? corn? cream? butter? How could it not be be fantastic? I even used fresh lobster. Wouldn't add this to my repertoire.

Great recipe! I added diced potatoes and crabmeat, used less whip cream. Totally amazing!

Made it by the book and thought it was terrific. Although the lobster makes it special, it is a great chowder without it. Will definitely make it for a crowd sans seafood.

I had some lobster meat leftover from Christmas dinner, so I used it in this recipe. I made some changes: omitted the bacon altogether, used old bay seasoning to replace the cayenne, and replaced 1/2 the onion with shallots. The final result was a creamy, relatively healthy soup whose flavor deepened the second day. Definitely a great winter "comfort food" recipe; will certainly make again. I wonder how well this would freeze?

Rating: 4
Really wonderful! We served this for Thanskgiving dinner with a spinach salad and a nice bottle of sparkling wine. Here in Maine, we're always looking for good uses of lobster, and this recipe certainly fits the bill. I used frozen corn from our summer crop and 2 strips of turkey bacon instead of the requisite 8. I might also consider some coarsely ground black pepper to finish.

Made with leftover super sweet boiled corn on the cob. I had no clam juice so used all chicken broth instead, and instead of lobster just sprinkled extra bacon on at the end. Family all enjoyed it, kids asked for leftovers for lunch the next day.

Made this for a SuperBowl party, and everyone loved it! Even got the comment that it was the best soup one guest had ever tasted. We saved money by using "fake" lobster instead of the real stuff - clearly the quality was not the same, but it worked since we were on a bit of a budget. I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

Rating: 3
Made this for Christmas dinner 2007. Soup was good but not worth the cost of the lobster ($42.00 here in Minnesota). I would make this again but use shrimp or crab for the garnish. I added some chopped red pepper, it gave the soup a more festive Christmas look.

Great recipe. Family menu candidate for sure

I've made this every year for my running club's lobster campout for 3 years now. I did not always puree the corn because I thought the quantity might be too much and the flavor overpower the dish but this year I did and the next day the flavor was good. Same day was very corn tasting. I also use my own lobster stock instead of clam juice. You must add some finely diced red peppers for color and to flavor balance all the corn. Try the baby once that come in a plastic box at Trader Joes but dont use the green ones. This recipe works with crab as well

Rating: 2
Quite similar to my recipe. Like others I have bay leaf and thyme added but I also add asparagus and Grana Padano Cheese. Additionally, I use Shallots instead of Onions. Plus (living in Rhode Island) I cook fresh Lobster (off the boat) and cut my Corn from the Cob. I know it's more work, but Worth It.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! To thicken it a bit, I skipped pureeing corn by itself. After sauteeing the onions, carrots, celery and corn I added 2 C of broth and then pureed it. I added the rest of the corn and clam juice to the puree and picked up from there.

I made this recipe for a small dinner party, substituting the Lobster for king crab. It was a hit! The only think that I would do is thicken it up a little more. Other than that, I'd definitely make it again!

I scaled this up to dinner for 30 and it was wonderful! We added thyme and bayleaf as well as the sweet red pepper which adds nice color. We also added Otterbrdges Sherry peppers, which added a good Sherry undertastwe and a small kick! Didn't use the sour cream.

This was great. Taking a cue from the other reviewers, I added thyme, bay leaf and diced sweet red papper. I also deglazed the onions with some sherry. I used the lobster but without it, it would make a great chowder on it's own.

This dish was great for ringing in the new year. We did use lobster (from Costco; such a great deal, such great quality), but had a tough time finding clam juice, so we bought 3 cans chopped cans that we drained & got nearly 2 C. juice. I added 3-4 small fingerling potatoes that I chopped & added w/ the onions; other than that we followed the recipe exactly (though perhaps added less cream). It was plenty thick, totally delicious and very filling. All that's needed is a salad & bread. We did add some dried thyme (maybe 1 - 1.5 tsp.) and sherry as well (maybe 1/4 c.). It was awesome and will confidently make it for a large group in a few weeks! Good luck!

Wow! Made this for a wine club group last night. Amongst 4 fabuluous dishes, this was the biggest hit. Minor changes that didn't seem to hurt a bit - 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream and no sour cream. For those of you with Trader Joe's, I bought 3 kinds of frozen corn and combined them - regular, really sweet and roasted. Worked great. Also, I bought a big ol' 2 pound lobster for 6 people. Decadent, yes, but if you can do it - it takes this up a whole level. FYI, paired it with Talbott's Kali Hart Chardonnay, Monterey County, 2005. Just $15 a bottle, very little oak. Cut through the rich soup and really worked with the heat from the cayenne.

This chowder was absolutley incredible!!! I made it for a group of people and they could not get over it. I did make a few alterations. I used fresh roasted corn. It took 20 ears to get 8 cups. I husked and brushed them with olive oil and roasted them for 40 minutes at 400 degrees. They came out just right. Cutting all the corn from the cob is labor intensive, but if you have some help it gets done in no time. The result is well worth it! The other alteration that I made was using fresh lobster meat. I boiled three 1 -1 1/4 pound lobsters and used all the meat (claws and tails). This was easy and delicious. Living on Cape Cod I could not use frozen lobster or frozen corn. I also added a small jalapeno pepper from the garden and added a little more cayenne pepper, the tastes melded perfectly. I will definitly make this recipe again. It was amazing. My family said it was the best corn chowder they have ever had!

Admittedly, I am a novice chef, but this turned out REALLY badly. I think if I knew more about substitutions and such, it might have been better. I agree with the previous reviewer about her previous reviewer(HA!). I hate it when people make substitutions to the recipe before they even try the original recipe. You have no idea how it turns out normally and, therefore, cannot begin to imagine what alterations must be made due to your substitutions. Don't complain if you changed the recipe!

Rating: 3
To the previous reviewer...maybe this recipe didn't live up to your expectations because you changed the recipe!!! I really get annoyed when people change the recipes and then complain. Try the original recipe and THEN make changes if you need to. This is a great chowder. Made it for Xmas dinner and wouldn't change a thing. Potatoes not needed - if made properly the chowder is thick enough. The lobster makes this dish.

Rating: 1
I wasn't really impressed with the taste of this recipe. Although I did make a few substitutions - lump crab meat instead of the lobster and did not add carrots. The soup itself tasted like cream of corn from a can, which I thought was very sweet (too sweet for my taste) - and the texture was really different that what I was expecting. I agree with other reviews that this needs potatoes to thicken it up a bit. I made it as beginning course for Christmas dinner and would not make it again.

Rating: 3
Good chowder, but not as thick as expected. Definitely add diced potatoes and more cayenne pepper to liven it up. I also used thick cut bacon and found it to be a better complement that regular. User friendly recipe, so enjoy!

I made this for the Christmas 2002 dinner and have consistently been asked to prepare it again. Even the young kids request it and my husband who is allergic to shellfish can enjoy it because the lobster goes on in the end. It is becomming a family tradition! Thanks for such simplicity in preparation but sophistication at the same time. It will be served at this years Christmas dinner.

Delicious! I used fresh corn, and not as much as called for--3 large ears, pureed 2 and used the whole kernels from the third. I also added yukon gold potatoes--3 small--cut into small chunks, and about half of a large red pepper, very coarsely chopped. Cut back on the clam juice to 2 cups. Forgot the sour cream and didn't miss it.

Rating: 4
Lots of raves on this recipe-even from people who don't regularly like lobster! Substituted 2 cups of cut up red potatoes for a portion of the corn, and a little extra cayenne pepper for some additional ZING! My guests took the recipe home- we New Englanders love our lobster and our chowder....worth the expense of buying the lobster tails & claws!! Recommended....

Rating: 4
Used a leftover lobster from Mother's Day and halved the recipe exactly except for adding a dash of sherry as suggested--delicious! It was still a lot for two people(even though we ate out all of the lobster!) so later added a bit more corn and cooked red potato to the leftovers to fashion a corn chowder for another meal. Still great!

Rating: 2
I was a little disappointed in this. I should have known better than to use frozen corn--before additional seasoning, it tasted like canned soup. I had to boost flavors a lot--sugar, chipotle chili powder, more cayenne, and some thyme. It finally masked the frozen corn taste. The bacon added a lot. I think it might be worthwhile with crab or shrimp, but at the price of lobster, why would you use frozen veggies as the backdrop? I might try again when corn is in season and roast the corn myself.

Really a fantastic chowder. A very impressive dish, particularly given how easy it is to make. Do save any lobster and bacon separately if you have leftovers and assemble after reheating. Only drawback is the lobster time/expense, but hey -- its lobster. I didn't think it needed thickening at all.

This is the best soup I have ever tasted. Everyone loves it. They even come over the next day for the leftovers. I have made this soup many times since it appeared in Bon Appétit, December 2002 and always with the cheedar twists. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, even using fresh lobster. Since then I have varied the recipe, with excellant results. The secret is the pureed corn. I use vegetable broth instead of chicken, I use less cream and more broth and omit the sour cream. It still tastes awesome. Costco Wholesale sells fresh lobster meat in a container for about $20.00 and it's more then enough. I have even used frozen (fresh) lobster from Kings supermarket and it was great. The soup is awesome the next day. But don't put the lobster or bacon in the soup, keep it seperate when you store leftovers.

I made this for Christmas Eve and it was a huge hit with the family. I didn't have enough lobster so I filled in the balance with some crab meat (from frozen king crab legs) and scallops. I was lucky enough to have some corn we shucked and froze the day it was picked from a neighbor's family farm in August, so the corn was exceptionally sweet and was wonderful with the seafood and a little extra kick of cayenne. It's a bit of an extragance here in Minnesota to buy lobster, but it is a worthy indulgance.

I have never rated a recipe before, but I find the reviews very helpful to me, so here goes! I made this recipe with my own changes to rave reviews. Everyone ooohed and ahhhed at each bite. It was an excellent meal with crusty bread and a delicious salad with fruit (craisins,pears,apples),toasted walnuts and blue cheese. I really love seafood, and didn't think the lobster would be enough, so I added a lb. of lump crabmeat near the end of cooking so as not to over cook the crabmeat. I also subsitituted chipotle pepper for the cayenne. It added an interesting spicy smokey twist. An excellent meal on a gusty cold night!

I would have given this four forks, but it just didn't quite live up to expectations. The recipe is great, the soup needed more thickening than the pureed corn and broth provided. I did substitute 1/2 & 1/2 for the whipping cream, so perhaps that was the problem. I would probably add diced potatoes to this next time. Also, to make this much easier and affordable, I used frozen crawfish tail meat and it was wonderful. Great corn chowder recipe even without the crawfish. Don't lose the bacon, though. :)

I substituted leftover chicken for the lobster and fat free half and half for the cream. I also added a chopped red pepper in place of some of the corn.

Loved it. Absolutely beautiful, delicious, rich soup. I thought at first that I would add some flour at the carrot/celery step (I like my chowders to be on the thicker side), but I decided not to just to see how it would turn out. It didn't need flour at all to make it any thicker; I guess the starch in the corn helped a lot. Also I used half and half instead of the whipping cream. Will definitely make again, on a special occassion next time, as the lobster cost 32.00 alone!!

This makes a good start to a big meal; nice flavours and textures (and all the suggestions below are good... a bit more cayenne; shrimp and crab plus or instead of the lobster), and the pink seafood looks good with the green chives and yellow corn ... and it's not too heavy so there's lots of room for the next courses.

This dish is just great. I made it as a first course on New Year's Day. I used 3 small lobster tails - and used the broth and only 1 can of clam juice to cut costs. I also added a bag of shrimp.

I made this for New Year's Eve with my 6 and 8 year-old children. Their first experience with lobster was a huge success for everyone. I was skeptical that it would serve 8 people, but it really does. Crab or shrimp could be substituted for the lobster. The cayenne adds only a little heat but a lot of depth. My only change may be to reduce the amount of broth slightly. My personal preference is for a thicker chowder.

Made this dish on New Year's Eve to rave reviews. Did make a few creative changes however. First, as this was our main course, I added two peeled and diced russet potatoes -- this added great texture and good bulk. Second, when I sauted the veggies, I added a teaspoon of dried thyme and a 1/4 of cup of sherry -- added depth I think. Third, I doubled the cayanne to create a little more heat (but it wasn't too much). Plenty of salt and pepper and viola, delicious. Served it with a warm spinach salad and no one touch their salad until the chowder was gone! Will definitely make this again!

Great recipe and fairly easy and quick. I only had one 15 ounce can of chicken broth and I did not have clam juice.

I made the recipe as written; however, next time I will definitely add the red pepper that was suggested. I did not feel there was enough texture to the soup. I also think adding other shellfish is probably worthwhile to try as well. Also, with the price of fresh lobster in Phoenix, I would make my own chicken stock instead of the canned. Why skimp on the broth with such a rich chowder! Did anyone try roasting the corn on the grill for the two cups that were not blended?

I just served this for Christmas Eve lunch to rave reviews. I'm printing the recipe for my Mom, which is why I stopped to write a review. Very easy, but is elegant enough to impress. I made it yesterday, and put it all together today. Works great! I was surprised at how light it was despite the amount of heavy and sour cream.

Fairly easy. I pureed all the corn instead of just 1/2 of it (I didn't read the recipe). I think it was better. The bacon, vegetables and lobster are enough texture, that having a smooth "base" works okay. I added some hot sauce as well to give the soup a little kick, which also worked.
