Made this to go with our Easter ham and it was very good. I tossed in baby carrots too. Only problem is that I think we didn't really let it cook long enough so the potatoes were a little crunchy.

Delicious! Made it exactly as written. Would be particularly good with any Mediterranean main dish.

This was fabulous. I made these to go with my Christmas ham, along with other sides. The mustard and lemon and garlic mixture made a great coating- this recipe is a keeper.

Great idea for potatoes, although the recipe is lacking some "umph." If you want mustard-y, lemon-y potatoes, be prepared to add more mustard and lemon. A high-quality mustard also helps (if you're willing to splurge on a simple potato recipe). I also doubled the oregano because I enjoy the light crunch baked herbs have.

Definitely not 4 forks. This is easy to make, but only tasted "ok". It had a vinegary taste from the mustard. I am a personal chef, and will only keep recipes if they are "fabulous". This was a disappointment. Not a "keeper".

Come on, people, 4 forks for this recipe?! Please review what the fork ratings mean. This was "good" or possibly "delicious" but nowhere near "exceptional". Made as directed for something different than regular roasted potatoes. Even though this was easy, I am not sure it is worth even the little extra effort.

Tasty and easy to make, just not outstanding.

This one was a hit - paired with mustard crusted lamb and beef roasts and a vertical tasting of Petit Syrahs. The potatoes were easy and fast and were a nice complement to both the meats as well as the wines. We used Luzianne mustard, roasted garlic instead of fresh and rather than using the no stick spray, oiled the baking sheets instead. Will be making this again soon.

This recipe was super easy so thats a plus. But honestly I couldn't taste mustard at all on these potatoes. Also, definitely wished I would have halved this recipe as now I have pounds of leftovers. Next time I would like to use the same amount of herbs and oil and mustard and half the potatoes.

Excellent and easy recipe. I halved the recipe and had plenty for four people. Wouldn't change a thing.

Very good side dish with chicken. It was super easy and delicious! Wouldn't change a thing!

Loved the crunchy exterior--I didn't have the specific mustard the recipe called for so I just mixed dijon mustard with Gulden's spicy mustard. I have to say my husband and I loved the result. Will definitely make again--so easy!

I recently made these potatoes at my boyfriends house and they were delicious!!! They were a bit on the well done side, as I didn't know his oven runs a bit hotter than the temperature indicated, but they were *SO* tasty. I had the leftover sauce left in the bowl I tossed all the ingredients in, so I dipped my roasted potatoes in that sauce, and oh my, it was that much better!! It's a keeper!!

Roasted potatoes (or roasted anything for that matter) are delicious! The list of ingredients used in this recipe made this a winner - check out my blog for pictures - http://randomactsoffood.blogspot.com/

Delicious! Our dijon mustard was probably not as high-brow as expected (we just used Grey Poupon from the squeeze bottle) but these potatoes turned out wonderfully. The leftovers were fantastic on a salad with grilled chicken and balsamic vinaigrette, too.

The recipe easily fed eight people as a side, with just a bit left over. Very tasty -- everyone raved about them, though next time I think I will bake at a higher temp as the potatoes didn't brown & crisp up like I would have preferred.

Rating: 1
Underwhelming. Despite many spices and flavors, end result is blah. Do not make ahead! They never get crispy again and are basically soggy potato wedges.

I made 1/2 the recipe for 2 people and have plenty of leftovers. Served with tilapia roasted in evoo and white wine and a garlicky kale and was really good. Would definitely make this again maybe with steak next time.

Rating: 3
These are pretty darn good. I used stone ground mustard instead of dijon and got pretty superb results. They were creamy on the inside, as they should be, with a nice outside. If only my notoriously uneven-cooking oven didn't ruin some of them. They definitely cooked a bit faster than the recipe indicates, though, so keep your eye on that, and this recipe definitely makes enough for a dinner party or one college student's dinners for a good two weeks.

I have doubled and tripled this recipe with good result for parties. This recipe gets many requests. Great with whole baked salmon. This is one recipe I follow pretty much as written although I am sure I have substituted a variety of herbs.

This is going to be my new go-to recipe for quick, easy, and DELICIOUS potatoes from now on! As another reviewer noted, the one-bowl preparation couldn't be faster or easier... LOVE that. My friend's notoriously picky-eater boyfriend even asked for the recipe so SHE could make these for him at home, which I gladly provided :) I roughly halved the recipe and it was still enough for 4 people as a side dish. I had to use regular Grey Poupon Dijon mustard (used up all my whole grain on another recipe a few days ago), but the results were still amazing. I also used baby Yukon Gold potatoes, which roasted up perfectly creamy on the inside and a great complement to the flavors of this dish. You will love this one!

Rating: 4
Oh, I am IN-LOVE! Not only were these potatoes easy to make, they were amazing. Just like the recipe says, garlicky crunchy outside, creamy sweetness inside. One bowl to prep. One pan to cook. A big bang for the buck.

Rating: 2
These potatoes were very good but perhaps slightly overshadowed by other dishes on the table (butternut squash gratin). They were very tangy, probably on account of the mushroom combined with lemon juice. The kitchen smelled great. But then we got distracted...

Rating: 4
Unbelievably good with fingerling potatoes cut in half lengthwise. They looked like they were a bit burned, but the taste was unbelievable. Perfectly crispy on the outside and sweet and tender on the inside. Tip: After removing from oven, toss with any mustard mixture remaining in the bowl.

I didn't use butter and very little oil. I used the trio of potatoes from trader joes. It has purple, white and red baby potatoes. Tasted good. Will make again. I made extra marinade and made it into a sauce for chicken. I sauteed some extra garlic, added white wine let it cook down added the marinade and then put some chives in. Tasty! Served with escarole and artichokes.

These are excellent. My boyfriend is obsessed with this potato recipe. the key is making sure to use the right baking sheet. Trust me - I used a deep glass baking dish out of desperation, and the potatoes were too soft. The metal lipped baking sheet allows for the proper amount of crisping, which truly makes this dish shine.

A family favorite. Quick and easy to make.

I made this for my parents along with mustard glazed rack of lamb and they were the perfect complement. The mustard mixture for these potatoes is amazing.

Rating: 4
I have made this a few times now, and it's always a huge success! I substitute some of the mustard for a smooth dijon because I find it sticks to the potatoes better, and I usually add some rosemary and cayenne (just a dash of each). Overall, amazing! Sadly though, while attempting to scourge the mustard off my ceramic dish, I broke it :( so use parchment paper!!

Rating: 3
This recipe was good, but I felt that it was missing something. I had tiny little potatoes and was feeling lazy, so I just left them whole. I think that they would have been better, though, if I had cut them up. That way the mustard probably would have adhered a little bit better. Oh, well. This recipe is easy and certainly worth a try.

Rating: 4
This is my new favorite potato recipe. A true winner! Reheated beautifully. I used half whole grain mustard and half stone ground mustard. I also added a little more lemon juice then what the recipe called for.

Rating: 4
It's imperative that you use the whole grain dijon, as the texture is completely different. I will use less lemon zest next time and more garlic. These were definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
The mixture that gets tossed with the potatoes was perfect- just the right amount of bite and flavor that didn't overwhelm the dish.

Rating: 3
I made these with salmon cakes with lemon yogurt sauce and cucumber gazpacho, both from this site. The mustard flavor was just a tiny bit strong with the salmon, but overall the three dishes went well together. When I made these potatoes next time, I might add some maple syrup to the sauce to temper the mustard. It depends what I make it with.

Rating: 4
Excellent. Flavor stood up to rib-eye roast with horseradish & gravy with Yorkshire Puddings etc. for Christmas dinner. I used all the sauce on the potatoes so they didn't crisp up as much as I wanted; but, I was warned in the recipe. A nice change from gratin or mashed and just as good. This goes in my "keeper" list

This recipe was quick and good. Everyone at Christmas dinner thought they were delicious. There were barely any left. I'll make these again, but may tweak the mustard mixture to bring out the flavor more.

The flavor of this recipe didn't bowl me over. The potatoes got nice and crispy, and I'm a big fan of oven roasted potatoes normally, but I'd try a different spice combo next time. Less mustard, perhaps add some cayenne and more herbs.

Wonderful recipe. Made it with the entire holiday meal from the magazine, which was good, but time consuming. This recipe is quick and easy while making the house smell great!

These were ok, but not as good as I had hoped for.

This was an unexpected success... as I was leery of using so much mustard! Rather than the potatoes referenced in the recipe, I used "fingerlings" which I had finally discovered locally and had read so much about! They were delicious and my fears about the quantity of mustard were dispelled... even my husband, whose idea of spices is salt and nothing else - asked me to make them again. Great balance of seasonings - and the presentation is colourful! (I used both the red and white skinned fingerlings). This was the first time I brought back an empty serving dish into the kitchen and I made the full recipe with only 7 at the table! I served these with the ginger-marinated pork tenderloin and green beans with sage and pancetta.

I made these with dijon mustard and thought they were just ok -not great. Probably needed a stronger mustard.

I made these with the entire menu (beef tenderloin with port sauce and green beans with sage & pancetta) and everything was exeptional. These potatoes were everything a holiday cook wants: easy and so delicious that even the picky 7-year-old ate every bite and wanted more. I'll be making them again on New Year's Eve!

These had very good flavor but were a bit drier than most roasted potatoes. Next time I will add 1 tbl oil so they stay moist in the oven.

I made this for Christmas dinner and was VERY impressed- not only was it flavorful, but very simple. Plus it held up well when I made it 3 hours before dinner time. I served it with the green beans w/pancetta and sage and the standing rib roast w/the garlic thyme sauce- incredible. Dessert was Giada's (Food Network) panna cotta w/the cranberry topping found here normally used on the Chocolate orange cheesecake w/cranberries. Serve in a martini glass for a festive look!

This recipe has a great flavor but I felt it needed to be just a little stronger. Maybe adding a 1/2 teaspoon of horseradish would give it a bit more zip.

I have a question for those who've made this dish. The photo shows smallish potatoes that seem to be cut in half, but the recipe directs you to cut them in "wedges." I'm making this dish tomorrow night for Christmas Eve. How were yours cut? Thanks so much!

Rating: 4
So easy and so delicious! The flavor is exceptional. I prepped in advance by putting sliced potatoes in gallon ziplock bag with the mustard mixture. Parked it in the fridge for 3 or 4 hours before roasting. No ill effects. If anything, perhaps more flavorful from sitting in the mixture for hours.

One of the best recipes ever. Awesome! Only change I made was to use regular dijon mustard, not the whole grain one.

These were easy to make, and everyone, including my picky daughter, wanted to just eat these and ignore the rest of the meal. I cubed red-skin and small yellow potatoes. The only thing I might do different next time is to skip the grated lemon peel. The lemon juice in the marinade was enough. I will definitely make this often.

While the end result was good and tasty, one can achieve just as good a product (and much less cleanup) with a box of onion soup mix.

This was quite tasty and well-liked at the vegetarian potluck. I one-and-a-halved the dressing as I added three large beets, cubed, and one fennel bulb, cut up, to the 1.5# bags of Melissa's white and red potatoes. I used Grey Poupon Harvest Coarse Ground to good effect. I'd welcome ideas as to what other vegetables would match this dressing. Thoughts?
