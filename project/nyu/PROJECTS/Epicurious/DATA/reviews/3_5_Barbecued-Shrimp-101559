Uh... WHAT bacon? I did half with the shell on; the ones that were deshelled came out rubbery. As far as the sauce, use what you like. Get a grip, people!

Really, really good, especially with the bacon wraps.

This was good but I wrapped bacon around the shrimp and brushed the sauce at the last minute on the grill. They were great!!

Delicious recipe. By the way, Austin, you're from Texas, why not make you're own BBQ sauce like all your neighbors.

This is a really good muchie. The bbq sauce, by itself, is a bit too sweet, but goes very well with the shrimp (I also wrapped it in bacon and grilled it.) Absolutely delicious!!!!!

These shrimp, with the spicy tomato barbecue sauce, were incredible! We highly recommend this recipe. We grilled the shrimp, on skewers, with thick slab bacon weaved on the skewer between the shrimp. This added a wonderful smokey flavor. Yum.

Come on! being from New Orleans, you cant just brush BBq sauce on shrimp and call it Barbecued shrimp!!!!! It is so much more that that! where is the crusty french bread to dip in the sauce??

I couldn't make this recipe because there was no link to the barbecue sauce mentioned, nor could I find it in the search. Please advise if you know of the recipe for the bacbecue sauce.
