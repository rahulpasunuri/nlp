Simply delicious! Used the cumin seeds and no curry leaves. Served on top of a baby greens salad with shelled edamame and Gallo miso dressing. Will definitely make again.

disappointed - I followed the recipe exactly and although it was good, it was nothing special - not spicy at all

really interesting and delicious when tossed with pasta scampi style.

WOW! highly seasoned, easy to make. Lots of flavor, lots of heat - and we like it that way!! I toasted my spices on a dry pan before using them in the marinade to boost their flavor. I served this with chana dal - with spicy accompaniments. Would definitely make again but would serve with a riatta - something with yogurt and spinach, perhaps, to cool the palate and balance the dish

This is super easy and the shrimp come out quite tasty. Used the coconut suggested in the author's note, and it was a great addition. If you are expecting something curry-like with this recipe, you will be disappointed, since, as you might guess from how little of each ingredient is used, the shrimp are not at all saucy. Still, ate this with rice and enjoyed it. Next time may try to figure out what to add to render a saucier result.

Great dish as is. Please don't rate things if you change the recipe - it's not the same dish and ruins the integrity of the rating system. Please do review with changes, additions, substitutions, et al; but don't rate - you are talking about another dish.

I added some shredded coconut at the end and it added to the flavor while toning down the mustard.

Delicious! I have made this several times with good results. I love the flavor and the fact that I usually have most of the ingredients on hand.

Delicious hot or cold, as a main course or appetizer. Use medium shrimp for an appetizer, you can skewer them and serve them cold. For main use large shrimp, even jumbo, and serve with saffron rice. Excellent flavor

Very spicy but in a good way. With rice it was very good.

Have made this twice, delicate Indian flavour with an after-kick. Paired it with hot red rice. Recommend for lovers of a quick curry on a Friday night.
