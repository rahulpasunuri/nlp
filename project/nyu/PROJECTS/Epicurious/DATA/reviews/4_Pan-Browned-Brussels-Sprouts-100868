Absolutely love these! I made them last Thanksgiving, and my 10 y-o ate them up, went for 2nd and 3rds, and ate the scraps off our plates! Delicious, elegant, and incredibly simple.

Prob would have been 4 forks- had I had cast iron skillet. I used nonstick. Uncovered 10 min on med/low, covered last 5 on low. Came out great, except a little drier than I would have liked. Still great, though. Perhaps just adding a little bit of water before covering next time. Used crushed walnuts instead of pine nuts and used olive oil instead of butter for those to make it healthier. I paired this with the Wild Salmon with Cous Cous and Slow Roasted Tomatoes from Epicurious. Beautiful dish.

Delicious! I'm vegan and I'm allergic to nuts so I just used veggie butter and substituted the pine nuts for sunflower seeds. YUMMY!!!

Amazing recipe!! As usual, started cooking and realized I had no garlic. A little garlic salt & lemon pepper and all three kids loved it!

We made this dish to the T. It is absolutely amazing. Couple of tips: slice the garic into thicker slices. They hold up better when cooking, especially at the end when you put them back in with the pine nuts. Add pine nuts when the brussel sprouts come out. Toast the pine nuts after the brussel sprouts are cooked. Toasting the pine nuts while the brussel sprouts cook, 15 minutes, you run the risk of buring your pine nuts.

Did everything as written! Total Yum!

Even my children adore this recipe--I agree that it can make converts. You just have to make absolutely sure that they are cooked through; I also throw the pine nuts in with the sprouts, as it's a pain to pick them all out. The only thing I don't like about this recipe is that I usually need to make two pans' worth, as it requires a lot of surface area for a relatively small number of sprouts.

Rating: 0
This is absolutely delicious. However, I found that you shouldn't add the sauteed garlic until the the pine nuts have browned. If you follow the original recipe, you'll burn the garlic trying to brown the pine nuts.

Look no further! Here is your recipe for when there's brussel sprouts waiting in your fridge. Easy. Simple. (I substituted hazelnuts for pine nuts, and like other readers, cooked them longer with the lid on for about 5 minutes. Cast-iron skillet definitely helped these.)

This is absolutely the ONLY want to make brussels sprouts. This is one of my favorite side dishes (And i hated BS before this!) The only change I make is I actually put the garlic slivers on top before serving. I love the taste of the bits of crunchy garlic.

We really enjoyed this. I used kosher salt, which seemed to add something to the dish. Next time I might omit the pine nuts since the spouts have a nutty flavor on their own.

I didn't like brussels sprouts until I made them this way. They were fantastic. Everyone I've served them to has asked for the recipe - even die-hard sprouts fans. One thing: be sure to use a cast-iron pan, or at least a stainless steel one. They never browned in a non-stick, and took forever to cook.

Rating: 4
I make Brussels sprouts as often as possible now. I do find that I need to cook the sprouts for about twice as long as suggested with the heat a little lower to keep the sprouts from burning yet still get them as soft and sweet as I like. The only variation I make to the recipe is to return the sprouts to the pan at the very end and stir to coat with the garlic, pine nuts, and butter. It distributes the flavors much more evenly. I also omit the pepper.

Rating: 4
I love sprouts in almost any guise but this is my "go to" recipe most of the time they appear in the market. I have made so many times, I know exactly how many to buy to fit in my cast iron pan. Follow the recipe as written and you cannot help but present a well flavored, well cooked side dish with one of nature's most charming vegetables.

This dish has converted me to a brussel sprout lover! I followed the advice of earlier reviews and simplified the dish by 1. Toasting pine nuts in advance and adding them at the end of the cooking time 2. Adding the raw garlic when the sprouts were 3/4 cookeded 3. Leaving the lid on the pan to speed up cooking time.

This recipe is so simple and easy to prepare, but also so delicious. A great combination! The brussels sprouts turn out tender, well seasoned, and not the least bit bitter. I halved some and quartered others to make sure all the pieces were the same size and would be ready at the same time. I also added some shallots. I'll definitely make this again.

I love this dish, I've been making it for years. It works great with fresh sprouts, and nearly as well with frozen sprouts --petite if you can find them-- defrosted in the microwave. Also works great with cajun seasoning for a plan-blackened dish.

First time I have had brussels sprouts in years! I liked them -- anything pan-browned in garlic and butter would be good, right? Like other reviewers, I used walnuts instead of pine nuts and thought it was very good.

Rating: 3
This was delicious and easy. Covered the sprouts for the entire time. After the first few minutes, they smelled like they were starting to burn, so added half cups of water periodically for the rest of the time so they could steam and brown at once. Omitted the pine nuts (don't like them), and they weren't missed. Added some parmesan to the finished product for a rustic, comfy, non-foofy, very appealing side dish.

We made both this recipe and the one for brussels sprouts with shallots and mustard seeds. This one won hands down. I cooked them covered for 15 minutes and they were perfect, tender but not too soft. Absolutely loved it.

Rating: 4
I've made this several times and it's always wonderful. Instead of the sliced cloves of garlic, I just use some minced garlic from the jar. I don't bother removing it before adding the brussels sprouts. Since it's chopped so small, it just cooks right in. And I DO put the sprouts in the pan cut-side down - they brown better that way, though they do need more than the 15 minutes the recipe calls for. Covering the pan helps speed up cooking time.

I'm a little surprised at all the rave reviews for this recipe. Even though I covered for most of the cooking time and cooked longer than the recipe suggests, the brussel sprouts were still under-cooked. The bottoms were crisp, but I would not say caramelized. The pine nuts were a nice addition, but not enough of a benefit to offset the tough brussels sprouts.

As an under-fed hick boy from northern New York, I was regularly subjected to the American method of cooking brussels sprouts: steamed in a pot with butter and salt. Thanks, Mom, but no thanks. Last night I prepared this recipe as a quick self-contained meal - and I couldn't have been happier - especially since I'm in Boston now, and we're recovering from a snow blizzard. There are a couple of things about this method of cooking brussels sprouts that make it more enjoyable than my white-trash experience: 1. Bitterness is greatly reduced by removing the stem core and the outermost layer of leaves, and 2. I'm guessing that when the leaves brown in the pan, they're actually carmelizing, which not only adds a little crunch, but a hint of sweetness. Let me tell you, I prepared this dish, had a glass of Bordeaux, and chilled out to a documentary on Suzanne Farrell and had one of the best night's of the year so far.

This is my favorite way to prepare Brussels Sprouts, with of course, a couple very small variations. I used my wok instead a cast iron skillet. There is no way I am going to place each sprout-half individually face-down; the only way I'm ever gonna be that fussy about cooking (not plating) is if I'm ever on the Food Network. I dumped the sprouts into the hot wok and I put the cover on so the sprouts could steam as well as brown. I let them sear for about 3-4 minutes (until I could smell them browning). Gave them a toss to redistribute and put the cover on for another 3-4 minutes. Repeated searing, tossing, and covering for a total of about 12-15 minutes - until the sprouts were tender-crisp to my liking. Some are browner than others. Some are GBaD on both sides, some are dark brown on 1 face only. They are all wonderful.

This recipe is awesome. Many Brussels skeptics have devoured this dish!

Try covering the pan with a lid while they are browning help the brussel sprouts cook thoroughly. Also, there's no need to fret about the fat. You can use more olive oil instead of butter if you're very concerned - these are healthy fats, including the nuts. The health benefits of cruciferous vegetables (that taste good enough to be eaten) are worth it.

Rating: 4
This recipe is so simple yet fabulous -- not to mention healthy -- you can't possibly go wrong. I used raw cashews (liberally, I might add) instead of pine nuts -- fantastic. I also deglazed the pan with a bit of white wine at one point. Crunchy and not mushy. Imagine a 10-year old asking for seconds on brussel sprouts, it's that good.

Rating: 4
I've used this recipe many times but never taken time to write a review. Tonight sprouts are browning, candles are flickering, and I have time. It's an outstanding recipe as is. Then again, you can use any chopped unsalted nuts you have in stock if you forget to buy pine nuts.

Maybe my sprouts were a little old or something, but they turned out more tough and chewy than crispy and caramelized. The pinenuts and garlic were quite yummy, though. Next time I'll probably try steaming the sprouts first to make sure they're tender.

I love brussels sprouts, so I usually just eat them steamed with a little ground pepper... Now I've seen the light! ;) I made some changes... I used a regular frying pan w/ a cover instead of cast iron. I heated some olive oil, added pine nuts until toasted, added minced garlic (3 cloves) and mixed. Next, I put in the brussels sprouts, cut side down, salt & pepper, covered, and let them cook for a few minutes. It didn't take long for them to brown, then I stirred, and added sliced carrots and parsley. I cooked that until the carrots were soft. Such a wonderful, nutty taste! I highly recommend this recipe.

I think the reason so many people do not think they like brussels sprouts is because they haven't tried fresh ones. This is a fantastic recipe for brussels sprouts.

When I make this recipe, I always add lemon juice and paprika along with the garlic. I find the acid from the lemons tones down the bitterness of the brussel sprouts. I often use a variation of this recipe with kale, collards, and green beans.

A wonderful new way to make brussel sprouts. The pine nuts & garlic really complement each other. A tip on slicing the garlic : hold the clove with a small dessert fork and you'll be able to slice it thin.

This was good but I think I will return to steaming the sprouts about 5 minutes in the microwave and then rolling them in olive oil (Badia Extra Virgin is our favorite) in a very hot grill pan sprinkled with Diamond Crystal kosher salt. It is faster and we love the crispy leaves this version creates) -- my kids & husband love them this way!

Ok, so I didn't try this recipe, but I wanted to offer a similar treatment I made up on my own that's easier and my family loves--Halve sprouts, stream with just a little water in microwave till just tender. Meanwhile melt butter in saute pan till just starting ro brown. Drain sprouts and toss into pan. Saute till they start to brown a bit--happens fast since they're already cooked. Add salt and pepper and enjoy!

This recipe is so simple, yet so delicious! I have had a lifelong aversion to Brussels sprouts, but this dish has converted me! Thanks to previous reviewers who suggested covering the sprouts for the last few minutes of cooking time- I have had beautiful crisp-tender results if I cover the pan for last five minutes or so. I am looking forward to trying other people's recommendations for preparing my new favorite vegetable!

Rating: 1
The fried garlic and pine nut is nice, but if you already like plain-jane steamed sprouts, the extra work to slice and brown and transfer with a slotted spoon and line up the sprouts all neat and flat along the bottom of the pan just isn't justified by the not-so-great results. Good, but not great. And you can only pan-brown so many sprouts at a time, so what to do for a large group? I wouldn't do exactly this again, but maybe drizzle some garlic butter with pine nuts over simple steamed sprouts. Would probably cut the time to prepare by a third, and taste pretty darn close...

I really liked this recipe. The browning really enhances the flavor of the brussels sprouts. I did put the lid on the pan for about a minute toward the end of cooking, since they were already very browned and not quite as tender as I wanted. That way, they were perfect and they didn't lose the crispy brown side.

I'm mystified by the cook who said this was a healthy dish. It is awfully heavy on the oil and butter (plus the fat in the pine nuts) for very little pay off. I liked the flavor that the garlic-infused oil imparted, but I didn't think this was anything special. I even *like* brussels sprouts.

This was a nice alternative to the usual brussels sprouts although a bit heavy with the olive oil and butter. The pine nuts made it special. I liked it more than anyone in my house and my son who doesn't like brussels sprouts (even though he's 16 now) wouldn't go near them.

This is one of my favorite, easy vegetable preparations; and it's so filling, yet healthy! I eat it at least once a week in the winter.

My husband was begging me to make this, one of his childhood favorites, for some time - but I thought I didn't like brussel sprouts and was avoiding them altogether. Was I wrong! This recipe is delicious. Of course, anything sauted in butter and olive oil has to be good. I've also made them with margarine and reduced the amount of fat. The sprouts won't brown as much, but they're still good.

Wow. Not the brussel sprouts my mother used to make! I followed the recipe exactly and will make these again and again. We that like brussel sprouts must learn to stop trying to convince those that don't how good this or any other particular recipe is. What the brussel sprout dislikers are missing is their loss and if they start to like and eat brussel sprouts, more will be purchased and the price will go up. Let's just smile when we pass the dish around the table and someone passes with the comment that they don't like brussel sprouts. :)

What's with all the hype? Garlic and pine nuts do not accentuate sprouts at all - the flavors don't meld! Sprouts are mini cabbages, and you wouldn't combine that trio either. Too much fussing for ok results. My dinner guests thought they were quite average as well.

I made this recipe for 4 people with 3/4 pound sprouts and more oil & butter and ran out because the non brussels sprouts eater became a convert after she tasted these! They were spectacular and next time I would double the recipe. They browned well in my cast iron pan, but I did need to cover them most of the time so they would cook through. The garlic on top was amazing. I would increase the amount as we are garlic lovers. I didn't add pine nuts right away- I thought they might burn. Used some coarse salt for added flavor.

Our experience with this recipe, minus the pine nuts (we did it last minute and didn't have them) was spectacular!!! Both myself and my fiance' (who, by the way is from Salt Lake City, Utah, now residing on Long Island, New York) are both brussels sprout lovers. To compliment the already wonderful recipe, we grated fresh Parmesan cheese over the entire dish and wrapped up by drenching slices of Italian bread in the flavored oil created during the cooking process. In the Fall, we are fortunate enough to be able to buy stalks of fresh brussesls sprouts.

I made this dish last night for several people who had never eaten Brussels sprouts before. They gobbled them up! I had to substitute sunflower seeds for pine nuts, but they worked well.
