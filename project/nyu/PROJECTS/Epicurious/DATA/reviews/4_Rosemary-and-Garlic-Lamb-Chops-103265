Great recipe! I marinated the lamb chops with lemon and the rest ingredients before I grilled the chops on a bass grill pan.

Totally awesome taste and quick and easy to make. Used 2tsp kosher salt since other reviews said it was too salty. It wasn't salty - fantastic! Used a little extra rosemary, too.

Great recipe and method. I would only add to be sure and let the chops rest a few minutes on a plate, under foil before you serve them. Up to 10 minutes if you can wait that long!

All these reviews are right--super simple preparation, absolutely delicious meal. I marinated in the fridge for probably three hours and brought up to room temperature before grilling. Served with goat cheese and basil potatoes and Nigella Lawson's lemony green beans. Really outstanding meal.

This was a lovely recipe. I overcooked the lamb a bit (oops!) but it was still juicy and delicious. My husband loved it. Flavors are exceptional together - hard to believe it's just rosemary and garlic! Will definitely keep this one as a favorite lamb recipe.

Simple,full of flavour,and very, very delicious! I 'frenched' my lamb chops for prettier presentation. This is one of our favourite lamb recipes and works out perfect everytime. I have also made this in a heavy frying pan on the stovetop when barbequing was not an option - still excellent! ..yum...

four forks because it's delicious AND super quick-and-easy. i bought shoulder chops by accident and next time won't make that mistake - use a nice loin cut. i marinated the chops for 2 hrs or so, before broiling, as well. this one's a keeper!

This was a nice and tasty basic recipe. It was quick, easy and very tasty. I add more olive oil and red pepper flakes to the rosemary mixture that was processed. I let the chops marinade for 2 hours.

These were very delicious and so easy, that I will definitely make them again even on a weeknight. I didn't have time to marinate on Thursday night, so just slathered the sauce over the chops on the BBQ. I left the remaining chops to marinate overnight and we had the rest on Friday. Either way was Mm mm good!! Unfortunately I had to 'use up' some shoulder chops, so the meat wasn't quite as nice as it could have been. Definitely use a better chop for this recipe, and you won't be disappointed. I did reduce the salt to about 1 tsp. Happy cooking!

There is absolutely no need for all that salt....it ruined very expensive chops....however being a garlic lover, I will make it again.....my fault....should have read the reviews first.....darn

I gave this 4 forks because so little effort and time was required to make such a delicious meal that I will add to my regular repetoire. I followed everyone else's suggestion to halve the salt in this recipe and it was perfect. I tried this with a rack of lamb vs. individual chops so was unsure of how much more cooking time I needed to add - we wound up separating the chops after the 3 minutes on each side and cooking them for another 30 seconds. Perfect, but I would probably just separate them prior to any cooking next time. If you have never cooked lambchops before, I highly recommend this recipe - it's totally foolproof and everyone at your table will love it.

Very easy to make and so delicious. I agree with the others - there's no need for all the salt. 1/2 the amount is more than sufficient.

The perfect seasonings for lamb. Tried this with lamb steak on the grill. If the grill hadn't decided to blow up all would have been fine. Finished the lamb steak in the broiler. In spite of all that I will try this again, next time with chops.

Quick. Easy. Elegant in a simple way. My wife and I had this on a weeknight. We were looking for a recipe that didn't call for marinating the lamb overnight, and we were very pleased and impressed with this dish. I grilled our lamb chops three minutes a side rather than broiling them, and they came out a perfect medium rare. The lamb was simply delicious, and my wife said the one lamb chop we had leftover was absolutely great served cold the next day. We will definitely make this recipe again. Highly recommended for a quick-but-wonderful weekday dinner or for serving company at the last minute.

Enjoyed even by the lamb skeptics at my Christmas table. So easy (less than 10 minutes preparation), and so good. Cooked them under the broiler and it was perfect. If you grill them, you should probably use a very hot grill or they'll dry out a bit. Simple and delicious. One of the best holiday meals I've had (although the bottle of 97 Opus One that accompanied it may have influenced the overall opinion somewhat...)

This was the first I made Lamb and it was a very easy recipe. I would make it a choice for special occasions. A suggestion is 1 tsp. less salt in marinade. I served the lamb on a bed of baby spinach dressed w/ oil ,vinager,salt +pepper. Also on the side was mashed sweet potatoes +onions( Bon apetite recipe/ Dec 1995). WONDERFUL!!!

This is an excellent recipe! I used dried rosemary (about 1 1/4t) and it was very flavorfull.The only thing I would change is to reduce the salt by at least half.

There is nothing earth-shattering here, just classic and simple flavor combinations. But it is delicious, quick, easy, and uses ingredients you probably have on hand.

This was so good!! I cut the salt to 1 tsp and the rosemary to 1 1/2 tsp and added a little lemon juice and zest like a reviewer before me. I put it on round bone arm chops--inexpensive, but very tasty. I also grilled them!! But everything else was the same!! :-)

To the cook in Westchester: the amount of salt given above is not incorrect. I looked at the original version in the magazine just to be sure, and the recipe does indeed state that 2 1/4 teaspoons of salt is required.

I have never made lamb chops before, so I wanted an easy first time recipe. This was so easy and good. I used dried rosemary and a sprinkle of kosher salt (obviously 2 1/4 tsp. is incorrect), brushed the mixture right on the chops and put them in the broiler. I didn't let the chops marinate, they didn't have to. Will try on other cuts of meat and would definately serve to company!

Very easy and very delicious! I wasn't a very big lamb fan (until now). I used the double cut lamp chops from Costco. Added balsamic vinegar and used Hawaiian sea salt in place of regular salt. Marinaded in zip lock bag for 6 hours and broiled it in the oven. The meat was so tender and flavorful. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This dish is truly delectable however I would make one major reduction regarding the ingredients. The amount of salt required, is enough to salt an icy road in the winter. My guests and I could not bear the tatse. I have altered the recipe for myself to only use 1/4 tsp salt.

one of our favorite ways with lambkins! we used loin chops, marinated overnight, then grilled. reduced salt per earlier good advice. made the marinade with the chopping attachment to my hand blender (small canister with blade) and it came out nice and thick, easily spread on chops and rubbed in. mustard idea sounds like a good one too.

Well, like everyone else, I'm giving it 4 forks and would make it again and again and again. I used 4 very thick English-cut lamb chops and we grilled them for 8 minutes per side over medium coals. My husband was in ORBIT. For the first time ever, he called me a "spectacular cook". (It's about time!)

This is it. You know when you have found that special one in life and this is one of those times. I made the whole amount of marinade and used on for 4 double chops. Reduced the salt to a tsp. Refrigerated in a zip lock bag for a few hours. Next time I might try longer, but I don't see how it could get any better. Broiled 5 & 4 minutes per side was perfect. Also I had very high quality lamb. It's so simple too.

key of course, is excellent chops. marinate overnite - put all chops in ziploc after coating. grill over high heat to med. rare and ...awesome!

I used shoulder blade chops and marinated them overnight. Lovely aroma of garlic and rosemary, but maybe the rosemary was too strong. Next time I'll add the rosemary to the marinating meat closer to cooking time. The chops came out tender and juicy, but slightly bland. I'll probably try it again with a splash of balsamic vinegar to give it a zing. Luckily, my very polite and very hungry guests loved these chops anyway and went back for seconds.

Rating: 4
Fabulous! The chops I had were smaller than those in the picture, but very fat, so we needed a bit more time on the BBQ--about 5-6 minutes/side for medium rare. Also, added 1 + teaspoon of Balsamic Vinegar. Definitely a do-again!

Absolutely outstanding! Paired it with "Asparagus with Parmesan Butter" (June 1998), and this now on my all-time favorite dishes list. The combinations of flavors in the marinade were perfect with the chops. We used double New Zealand rib chops, and 4-5 minutes each side was just about right for medium-rare. We will definitely make this again, and won't change a thing!

Oh so good.There are flavor pairings that just cannot be improved on; lamb, garlic and rosemary are one of these. This recipe is perfect. We went in an Italian direction serving the chops on a bed of creamy Parmesan polenta, accompanied by green beans sauteed with prosciutto, and topped with a Parmesan tuille. I can't wait to cook this again!

These lamb chops were really awesome! I reduced the salt, alot, and the rosemary by about 1/2, as rosemary is not one of my favorite herbs, I also increased the garlic by 2-3 cloves. I marinated for about 3-4 hours. My husband, son, and myself really enjoyed these! (Served rare.)

This was, without a doubt, the most fantastic lamb chop I've ever had the pleasure of eating. I served the chops with safron & curry couscous (with currants, golden raisins & pinenuts added), grilled vegetables (zucchini, eggplant, & red- and green-bell pepper), and a glass of Chilean Trapiche Malbec. A most amazing meal, based on a fantastic lamb chop!

So easy and yet so good! My sister ( a fellow gourmand) still raves about its simplicity and taste. Fresh rosemary is the way to go with this dish - plus as long a marinade time as you can afford. Also interesting to replace the rosemary with herbs de provence mixture, but use a little less thatn 2.5 t.

Perfect lamb marinade. It is exactly as I expected it would be... and should be! This is a great '101' recipe and is so fast and easy. I also like it because these are ingredients that are always in the house. Does not overpower the lamb but nicely accentuates the flavor. Enjoy!

I tried this recipe and it was very simple to do. I did not have fresh rosemary from the garden yet so I used dried (it worked). When the fresh rosemary is available I will definately do this one again. The only tricky thing was broiling them long enough to please my husband without ruining them!

Yum-ola! This is by far the best recipe I've ever tried for lamb chops. I only used five chops, but still made the whole marinade recipe. It seemed like just enough. I couldn't taste much rosemary, so I think next time I'll up the quantity. I cut back on the salt (used only a teaspoon) because I was afraid the entire amount would dry out the chops as it marinated. I sprinkled a little more on while on the grill (we always grill our food). I marinated in the fridge for about six hours, and wouldn't hesitate to marinate overnight next time. An absoulte dream of a recipe... so easy, and fast, and, most importantly delicious. My in-laws couldn't say enough about it!
