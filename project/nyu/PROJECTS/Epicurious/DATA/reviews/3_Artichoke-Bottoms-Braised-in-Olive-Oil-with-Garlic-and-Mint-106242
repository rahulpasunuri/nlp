As with a lot of Italian cuisine, this recipe is all about the ingredients. If you have fresh, big, juicy artichokes, fresh mint, and fresh, rich-tasting olive oil, this recipe is a wonderful way to show off their flavors. Sure it's a little bit of prep work, but it is really worth the effort.

this is a good way to get to know the anatomy of an artichoke! once you prepare the first artichoke, the rest is easy to do. simple ingredients- great taste! if you're looking for something fancy- this isn't the dish- but if you want a delicious simple appetizer/side dish, try it. i didn't have the mint, and i didn't miss it.

The means don't justify the ends. The taste is fine ( nothing too special) but way to much effort for the result. If I made this again, I would substitute halved baby artichokes instead of bottoms and increase seasonings.
