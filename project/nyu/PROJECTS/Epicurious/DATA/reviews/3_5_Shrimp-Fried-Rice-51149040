Best fried rice I've had. I'll not be ordering it in restaurants anymore. Maybe it was the ginger. I don't know. Just great. I brought a huge tray to my book club and people went wild.

My husband and I liked this dish, but instead of the plain veg oil, I used some toasted sesame oil, some peanut oil, and a bit more soy sauce than was called for.

I thought this recipe was good, but nothing exceptional. I added a dab of hot sauce after I took my first bites to give it a nice kick. This is pretty standard when it comes to fried rice.
