I really wanted to like this soup because recently I had some Roasted Red Pepper Soup at a French restaurant in Jacksonville which was terrific. This soup (I hate to say) wasn't even okay--much much too thin despite 20 minute reduction and sadly flavorless (in my opinion deserves no fork at all). I followed the recipe to the letter except added a clove of garlic as previous reviewers noted. I also only made half a recipe. But, I "doctored" this at the end and my result is really better, but it's not Leslie's recipe, it's mine. After pureeing in my blender and reducing, I added more Herbes de Provence than called for and a tsp. of dried tarragon, total. What really helped was that at this point I added a huge beefsteak tomato, blanched, skinned, seeded and chopped in tiny pieces and added to the pot. Remember, this is half the recipe; for the whole recipe, two beefsteak tomatoes would be necessary. Then I reduced the soup for about 20 minutes or so, uncovered, medium low heat, stirring from time to time, until it really thickened up nicely. Then I added chopped fresh Italian parsley and chives from my herb garden. I live alone so have nobody to tell me how good my version of Roasted Pepper Tomato Soup is, but I think it's pretty good. And yes, I'll make it again: my version. Sorry Leslie.

This was a great soup but an even better sauce over grilled chicken!

I made this recipe dor Valentines Day and it turned out great. Went by the recipe except I didn't have taragon, so I substituted some fresh rosemary from my garden. I also added some garlic because I just felt like it was a typo that it wasn't included int the ingredients. Very good and cvery easy.

Excellent soup. Used about half fresh peppers and half store bought roasted peppers. Added some garlic and used home made broth. Also used plain yogourt instead of the sour cream. Will definitely make this again. This soup has a beautiful texture and pleasant mix of flavours.

Boring! Didn't have very much flavour, luckily I made it just for me, so didn't have to worry about what any one else thought of it. A lot of work for a blah soup.

Easy to make and I added garlic like other reviewers did. I used homemade chicken stock which also probably helped the flavour. Also grated some pecorino cheese on top at the end as I did not have sour cream. Very good.

WOW! Reduce the butter to just enough (or even substitute olive oil) to saute the onions and you have a very delicious soup that is really diet fare. I have been making this soup for about a year and lately I have been adding garlic. I make big batches and freeze it. Sometimes I use a big can of Mancini roasted red peppers if the price of fresh is outrageous. Really, I don't think I could tell the difference! A very wonderful recipe.

Funny thing -- I love red peppers and made this for company -- was at first disappointed by the weak flavor, even with all those peppers. Then added a few spoons of "chicken base" and it became a winner -- got raves from company. You have to supplement the stock or it won't have enough flavor.

I thought that this soup was dynamite, quite easy to make and great flavors. It is saved in my archives!

This is one of the best soups. Easy to make, doesn't take a lot of time especially with a hand blender, we never took the soup out of the pot. I can't wait to make it again!

More work than I anticipated (roasting, peeling, pureeing) and I didn't think it worth the effort.

This soup is fantastic. I accidentally doubled the butter, but it was a happy accident as it made the soup wonderfully rich. The soup got rave reviews from everyone who tried it.

Amazing! I made it with vegetable broth instead of chicken for the vegetarians in my family. We have several containers in the freezer and take one out whenever we need a special treat!

Simple, excellent soup. I used fresh tarragon from my garden. I added some toasted croutons along with the sour cream, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Great.

I make a couple of small additions that boost the flavor - I add one cup of fresh corn, 4 cloves of roasted garlic and sometimes a bay leaf. I serve this in roasted acorn squash bowls from the Beet Soup with Roasted Acorn Squash recipe on this site and it's an entire meal. An outstanding soup!

Just great. No additions or subtractions.

This soup makes soup and sandwich nights something special. It is elegant and fun. The soup is velvety smooth and the flavors just burst.. especially with fresh, seasonal peppers. Wonderful each time!

Simply amazing. Red peppers never tasted so good!

This dish was cheap, delicious, and very low in fat. It acts as a cream type soup, yet it is simply a puree of low-fat vegetables. I substituted dried savory because I didn't have taragon, it was just as delicious. I also agree with adding garlic, about 3 cloves crushed, and roasting the red peppers whole, that way all the juices remain inside the peppers. This soup will become a regular in our family.

Love this recipe. I have added corn and garlic and it adds great texture and taste. I cut the amount of butter down as well and use fat free broth. Roasting the peppers is not as hard as I had anticipated.

i didn't make this soup, but my *favorite* roasted red pepper soup is by Deborah Madison, it has you add one small potato (when you saute the onion and garlic) and adds a bay leaf, and some majoram, it really adds a sensuous texture to the soup, and I can't wait to make it again. served with creme fraiche.

This soup was very good. Can use a little less broth if you like a thicker soup. Seasonings were just right.

Great taste!, We only used the blender for one cup of soup in order to leave complete strips of onion and red pepper to add even more color and texture. We used the oven to roast the whole peppers, it works perfectly, if you dont like fat, you may want to use 3/4 of the amount specified, we will do that next time. Serve with bagette!

Wonderful! Too fatty? Not a chance! I absolutely loved it. It was a little labourious. Next time (as my sister suggested) I would roast the peppers whole in the oven as opposed to dividing into four first. The flavours were dynamite; naturally I added more garlic. Tarragon was a great touch. You've got to try it!

Contrary to the first review on this (Ms. Fox) there is not "toooooooo" much fat so please do not let that review dissuade you from preparing this heavenly recipe. It has a lovely taste and texture which would be lost in the oh-so-au-courant trend toward removal of "fat" (which contributes to flavour). Please, try the recipe and see if you don't agree that it has a lovely taste and feel. A compromise would be to use olive oil or some other "low-threat" oil for the saute stage but it doesn't have the same richness. Even better made with peppers charred on the grill, imparts a subtle smoke flavour. In any case, live a little. :-)

first of all it had toooooo much fat in it. It is much better the second day, reheated. Adding a little locatelli cheese transformed the flavor for me. Yes, I would prepair this again, but with a few alterations
