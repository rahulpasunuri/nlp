Elegant and easy recipe that I made for Easter alongside the scalloped potatoes with fennel and a spiral ham. I too substituted Baby Bellas for our local gourmet market did not have the fresh morels. The combination of tarragon, mushrooms and asparagus are perfect.

Tasty and easy to make once you've gotten the small amount of prep out of the way. My husband isn't a veggie eater and went back for seconds on this dish.

Unfortunately, I was unable to find fresh morels. A small package of dried morels was $19.99, and when reconstituted, tasted like the white wine used to reconstitute them. So, if you can't find fresh morels, use some other fresh mushroom. Overall, I prefer asparagus roasted in the oven.

I have to admit that I did not follow the recipe, I'm not a fan of tarragon. I used sage in it's place and I liked the mix between the sage and the lemon. Very elegant side dish.

Made for Easter this year...a definite keeper. The only change I made was to substitute Baby Bellas and Cremini mushrooms for the Morels. I did prepare the asparagus the day before and stored as suggested in plastic bag lined with paper towels. Be sure not to overcook the asparagus! The Tarragon was the perfect herb for this dish and the sauce was fantastic.

I make this recipe all the time. The first time I made it I followed it to the letter save for the white asparagus. I make this often without the mushrooms since I'm the only funghi lover in my house. Flavorful and impressive, you will not find fault in this simple, elegant side dish.

Serve the very instant it's finished.

I did modify the recipe (used only green asparagus, used mostly cremini mushrooms with just a few morels) - for economic and seasonal reasons. Even so, his was really delicious and I'm sure would be even better with white asparagus and more morels. The only improvement I'd suggest is more mushrooms in proportion to asparagus. I just love this combination.

Made with all green asparagus but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Fabulous! But who could go wrong with fresh Yakima asparagus, fresh picked morels and a lot of butter? Will definitely make again as long as my brother in law keeps bringing in the wild morels!

No white asparagus...bummer. However, tasty even with subbing the morels with portobella. The butter can be cut in half.

Delicious flavors that were ideal tossed with penne pasta. Used only green asparagus and substituted shitake mushrooms that I had on hand for a fresh, savory spring dish. Fresh, seasonal ingredients are a must.

They're talking about a mountain range in Europe because the recipe was featured in an article about Europe.

The ingredient is from CA, why are you talking about a mountain range in Europe??

Wonderful dish! I substituted the morels with king mushrooms as my grocer didn't sell them, but they tasted absolutely superb! I'm not a huge fan of tarragon (that black licorice taste) so I think I'll try replacing it with parsley or a little bit of basil next time.

Delicious! I followed the recipe except for decreasing the amount of butter and using only green asparagus. I highly recommend using morels as their woody, meaty flavor really heighten this dish.

Perfectly balanced flavors!

Excellent! The ingredients are hard to find--I used only green asparagus and a mixture of portabellas, creminis, and shitakes--even though Morels are technically in season, I couldn't find any. It was still a lovely dish. It is best served *immediately*. We served it with grilled salmon and a risotto-styled orzo. Best dinner in a long time!

Nice asparagus recipe. Used only green asparagus because I couldn't find white. Substituted Chanterelles for Morels cause I couldn't find those either. It was a nice side dish for Easter dinner and everyone loved it.

Great recipe. I made a triple batch for a big party and it worked well. I used two large pans. Prepped and cooked the asparagus the day before so it was easy to assemble right before my guest arrived. I used portabello instead of morels and it was still great.

This was great. I made it with regular white mushrooms as I didn't want to waste my $$ morels if I didn't like the results. Also used only green asparagus. Finished with a little bit of grated parm. I was hesitant about the lemon juice but it added a nice freshness to the dish. Will be making it for my next dinner party. The only change is I would use half the butter called for as it didn't really need it.

This is a wonderful dish I had this for a foodie group at my home everyone loved this dish.

A really good recipe and all my guests enjoyed it. I could not find the morels at the store so we had to use creminis. I will make it again with morels.

Served this for a dinner party last nite and it was so good. I only had shiitakes as well. Love most dishes that can be prepped ahead. I agree-butter is called for here. I sauteed the veggies and kept it warm in low oven. Had the grilled pork tenderloin with cherry chutney from this site and paired with a wonderful Malbec. soooooo goooood!

Very yummy! Nice and subtle flavors, although we didn't follow the recipe exactly, and used only white asparagus and shiitake mushrooms. Still tasty though, and great for spring!

Forgot to add I did not use mushrooms, and they weren't even missed.

This was so yummy I made it for both nights of Passover! Blanching and refrigerating the asparagus ahead of time is a huge time-saver. Didn't use white asparagus..didn't look fresh enough, so doubled the green. Also cut down on the butter suggested. Everyone raved!

Fresh, easy & delicious! Be sure to sprinkle a little kosher salt over it after roasting & mix.

I thought I would like this recipe much more than I did, judging by all the reviews. I used olive oil instead of butter to keep it healthier--perhaps that's why I just didn't find it all that tasty. It turned out fine, but I prefer roasted asparagus with some olive oil, salt and lemon in terms of both ease and taste.

We were determined to make this dish even though all we could find were dried morels and there was no white asparagus to be found. It was still the best asparagus I have ever had. Our guests loved it too. I hate anise so I was a little worried about garnishing with the tarragon, so I didn't. But the sautéed tarragon was a subtle and much appreciated flavor. I would eat this every day if I could afford the morels!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was eaten up sooo fast! The only change I made was to substitute oyster & shitake mushrooms for the morels (couldn't find morels anywhere, plus cheaper that way). The contrast of white & green asparagus, both in terms of texture and color was great! Everyone kept asking me what herb was in the dish -- the tarragon really complements it well! A+

Excellent flavor. I used both oyster and shitake mushrooms as suggested. Other than that adjustment, I followed the recipe and it turned out wonderfully.

Absolutely fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly. The morels need a lot of cleaning and several rinses. I put them in bowls of water and agitated them, then rinsed and repeated several times. BTW the morels were $69.99/pound!!

Delicious and easy. Great for a dinner party because with asparagus blanched ahead, it was a breeze to put together. I did use only 4 tbls butter and it was fine. Raves received from guests. Pretty with 2 colors of asparagus.

Delicious! It does not take anywhere near an hour to prepare. I used fresh oyster mushrooms instead of morels, and they worked great. I agree you could cut down on the butter by about 1/3.

Perfect. The morels (I used dried), tarragon, asparagus and lemon are fantastic together

Delicious, even substituting brown mushrooms for the morels!

WOW. This was amazing. Delectable use of tarragon. I used shiitakes instead, the market had no morels. I tried to cut back on the butter as much as I could. Don't forget to salt, it brings everything out. So, so, so good. Too rich for a weeknight regular, but would be awesome with a steak and mashed potatoes. Make sure to coordinate your herbs.

This was wonderful. Not the season for white asparagus, will try it again with it when the time comes. Also, no morels, used a variety of wild mushrooms. Great recipe.

The tarragon is quite subtle. Served with a simple grilled beef tenderloin and a French Bordeaux. Fabulous meal!

If your family doesn't like tarragon, try fresh Basil -- very good....And, just before serving, sprinkle with some fresh grated paremesean cheese..This is a very tasty dish
