Harsh lesson - melons made the whole thing a sweet , watery mess - my guests did not touch it, and I wasted about $30 on ingredients ! (substituted smoked trout for chicken...)

The greens-and-chicken mixture is fine, but this dish needs to lose the melon. It just doesn't work. The textures are wrong, and I don't think the flavors do anything for each other.
