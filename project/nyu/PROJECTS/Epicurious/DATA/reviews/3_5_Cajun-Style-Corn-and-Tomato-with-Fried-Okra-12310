This was absolutely delicious! I used more tomatoes (I had 6 heirloom paste tomatoes from my garden - "Cream Sausage" and "Cassidy's Folly") than the recipe called for and thus left out the water. I otherwise followed the recipe, and it was a hit with the whole family. The dish is even more flavorful than it sounds.

Nice, fresh summer dish. I added a poblano pepper to the corn and tomato mix because I just bought some from the farmers market that weekend. It was a nice addition, without being overwhelming. Like another reviewer, I also added smoked paprika to the cornmeal. The only issue I had was when frying the okra, all the cornmeal fell off into the hot oil and I was left with some mushy okra, and a pan full of hot oil with cornmeal at the bottom. So the last part of the batch I tossed with a beaten egg before adding to the cornmeal and ended up with nice, crispy fried okra. But it was all very yummy, and the perfect vegetarian meal for a summer night.

I had to add some extra ingredients to "zip up" this recipe. I cut the cream portion in half and added coconut milk along with vegetable broth (instead of water). I also added spicy paprika, and a dab of curry paste to the sauce, along with some ground cumin to the cornmeal mixture. When it was all said and done with, my wife and I really enjoyed this dish. However, I had to rate it with one fork before we doctored it.

This was very good however I will kick it up a bit next time. I only used 2T of cream which I thought was perfect. I also think I will add chopped jalapenos next time for a bit of added color and spice. To the cornmeal I added a bit of smoked paprika which was good--I will also try oven frying next time for the okra. I can't wait to make it again and see how it turns out!

This was really good, I was looking for a lighter version so I omited the heavy cream. I don't know how it would have been with it, but we all really enjoyed it without. It was a while ago when I made it, but I think I spiced it up a little with some cayenne.

Wonderful - great flavor and a good use of fresh produce. I've used mayonnaise in the place of the cream (about 1 tbs.) and it gives the corn/tomato combination a nice, creamy texture.

This was just delicious! I happened to have all the ingredients in my fridge and was looking for a way to use them so this recipe fit the bill perfectly. I did add a diced red bell pepper since I needed to use that up too. I added a bit of cayenne to the cornmeal as well. Served it over cornmeal crusted tilapia. Yummeh!

This was incredible. I had corn, tomatoes, and okra from a friend's farm, and needed a way to use them. I'm sure my proportions were wrong as I didn't measure anything and just used what I had, but, still, it was great. I think very good corn is key, but I'm not a big enough fan of corn to enjoy it *unless* it's very good. I did feel a little bit like this was a waste of garden tomatoes since cooking them destroys so much of their flavor, but they did add to the dish, so I guess it was a worthy cause. Served with cajun-spiced catfish, and baguette with chevre (holdover from my introduction to okra -- I must accompany it with goat cheese). The spiciness of the fish went well with the sweetness of the corn, but it wasn't the perfect match. I'll probably try this again with something else if I get more okra!

WOW you'd never know it from eyeballing the recipe but this is actually an amazing dish. I make it in the summer. When I have to, I substitute frozen okra for fresh and it works out well.

Thought this was pretty good but it needed a little something so I added fresh basil, thyme and a little cayenne pepper. The next time I make it, I am going to chop the onions. I didn't like how the sliced onions sort of got tangled up with the corn. I couldn't find fresh okra so I used frozen okra which I partially unthawed. I served this with grilled catfish.

A keeper. Used home grown corn, I froze off the cob. Also changed the heavy cream to Land O Lakes fat free 1/2 and 1/2. YUM!

I've made this twice---once following the directions, the second time with frozen cornmeal breaded okra, and frozen corn. And, there's no difference in taste. So, that turns this into a quick great side with three veggie servings. Very, very good.

I loved this dish! It is a little rich because of the heavy cream, so I might try serving as a side dish next time with some tilapia or some catfish. BUT I will definitely make it again - very yummy. If you need a good comfort food - try this!

Absolutely delicious and simple to prepare! I enjoyed it immensely and felt as if I was enjoying a meal at a nice restaurant. Frying the okra really takes away all slimey-ness. Recommend finding the best possible tomatoes for this dish. I used homegrown sweet tomatoes and it really made the recipe. Followed the other cook's advice and used canned corn and this was just fine.
