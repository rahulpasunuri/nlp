surely using whole eggs is a printer's error! The other classic zabaglione recipes in this series are better.

In short, this recipe did not work and did not taste like any zabliogne that I had enjoyed in the past. Using whole eggs instead of just the yolks created something similar to a watery omelet and I needed to strain the bits of cooked eggs through a colander. At 160 degrees it was not as thick as I would have liked it but I feared a batch of scrambled eggs if it continued to cook any longer. The strawberries soaked in Marsala were delightful, and I put mere teaspoon of this concoction over them and faced the stove and prayed that my guests would forgive me.
