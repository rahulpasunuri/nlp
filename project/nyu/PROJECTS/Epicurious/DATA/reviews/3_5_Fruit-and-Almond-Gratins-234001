If I make this again, I would use berries instead of grapes and pears. Otherwise, terrific.

Delicious and easy. I used six ramekins, and varied the fruit (used pears, blueberries, and peaches). I also omitted the final broil, and it was delicious.

These were a great dessert for company if you have enough pretty gratin dishes. Everyone loved their own gratin. The dish is not too sweet and a lovely way to treat fruit. Grind whole blanched almonds (from the Middle Eastern market) in the food processor to a fine meal and the rest is easy.

This was delicious, refreshing, and so easy to prepare. Delightful, rustic elegance. A keeper. Merci Elena.
