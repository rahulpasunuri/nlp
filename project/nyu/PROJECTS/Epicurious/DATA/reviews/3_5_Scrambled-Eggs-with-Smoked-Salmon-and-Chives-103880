This is fabulous! The better the salmon the better the end result. Home made smoked salmon, onions & chives from the garden. Served with a couple slices of garden tomatoes it made a great dinner last nite. Only problem was I ate the leftovers (that my wife was saving for today's lunch) before going to bed and caught a little grief for that this AM.

I've made this for breakfast on Christmas morning the last 2 years and will do it again this year. It's really a great combination of flavors--the onions and chives are in balance with the salmon and extra salt is not needed.

Loved this. I added a spoonful of sour cream on top and a tiny bit of dil at the end. Served with slices of tomatoes. Great!

The worst breakfast recipe I've ever made. I was worried that there were too many onions but the onions were a great and slightly sweet addition. There was too much salmon and the salmon addition to the eggs was awful. I added it at the end for less than 1 minute and the result was so fishy. The salmon did not smell fishy out of the package. I don't know why this got such good reviews but it must be the type of salmon that people lucked out on. I'm glad this was not for guests.

A waste of good salmon. At $20+ per pound, the salmon should be up front in this dish and its not because the onion overpowers it. I would make this again, but without the onion, the chive is pleanty enough subtle onion-ness and I'd also add a few tablespoons of cream cheese.

This recipe is a winner. Made it for brunch last weekend and everyone raved.

Wow! Fantastic and easy! Doubled recipe for a brunch main entree. Clear crowd favorite. Definitely is on my all-star recipe list.

I added 2 ounces of mascarpone cream cheese (it is WAY better than normal cream cheese). drop cheese in half teaspoonfuls throughout eggs right after putting eggs in the pan.

This was so good. An easy way to make eggs different, yet great tasting!

Didn't have onions. Smoked salmon is fabulous!

This dish was excellent!! It was easy to make and it didn't need any seasoning. The onion and smoked salmon seasoned the eggs to perfection. I didn't add chives though and it was perfect.

Had this for a quick supper with bread and salad, and it was super. The better the smoked salmon, the bettere the results.

What a great way to start the day. The salmon flavor jumps right out at you for a great twist on a classic breakfast dish. I will for sure make this one again.

Elegant and delicious! I made sure to use a sweet onion, and served it in individual ramikins. My crowning touch was finely crumbled smoky bacon and diced, fresh tomatoes. I will definately make this again, and try new embellishments!

This was very good. I made it as the recipe suggested but I did not use quite the same amount of butter.

Absolutely delicious. At first I wasn't sure about the "cooked" salmon-eggs combination, but it worked out surprisingly great--since I put the salmon in just a few seconds before the eggs were done, it wasn't really cooked. I used fresh chives from the garden as well as some parsley and every single family memeber that was at the luncheon for Mother's day agreed that it really is a great recipie. Thanks yet again, Epicurious:)

I made some small changes to this. It was a big hit at my Mother's day brunch! I added goat cheese which was scrumptious! Also, I did not cook the smoked salmon in with the eggs, instead, I added it afterwards and I think it made a difference. Enjoy!

I used red onion and dried chives instead of fresh because that's all I had on hand. I did like the eggs with the onion but the smoked salmon was just way too salty, and I really don't like my smoked salmon cooked. I prefer it as is on a toasted bagel with some cream cheese, red onion, capers, lemon juice, hard boiled egg, and dill. Now that's a good breakfast!

I made these for my boyfriend for a special breakfast-in-bed and he loved them SO much that we didn't leave the bed all day! I substituted lox for the smoked salmon because the taste isn't as overwhelming. I also agree that the eggs are best when just a little mushy...

Used Norwegian smoked salmon, which is salty. Added a nice kick to the eggs. Also used dried chives instead of fresh. Still tasted great!

Excellent. I have done many times. This time I seved in phyllo shells for a brunch. The key is not to overcook your eggs.

My husband and I love this dish!! The onions add a nice mellow sweetness and the salmon and egg work great together. It has become our new special breakfast.
