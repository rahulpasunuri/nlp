Made just the cake, without the oranges, and it was light and not too sweet, with a nice crispy crumb. It came out a little dry - I'd probably bake only 20 minutes next time - but otherwise a lovely, simple cake. My cornmeal was quite fine, so I didn't have the same problem as the last reviewer with separating batter.

Flavors were incredible! Unfortunately the cake turned out heavy and the polenta did not dissolve resulting in a grainy, crunchy cake.
