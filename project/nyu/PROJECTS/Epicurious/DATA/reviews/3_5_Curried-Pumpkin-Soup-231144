I also like this recipe, following some reviewers' suggestions; I added leeks, instead of onions, and roasted the pumpkin in advance.

I followed this recipe with the slight changes that a few other reviewers mentioned as well as some of my own tinkerings. 1) I roasted both the pumpkin and butternut squash ahead of time with olive oil, salt and freshly ground pepper. 2) I used half-and-half instead of cream. 3) I couldn't find whole allspice berries, so I made the sachet with a cinnamon stick and several cloves and then just added extra cinnamon straight into the soup. 4) I didn't pass the the pureed soup through a sieve, because I prefer soups like this to have some texture. 5) I'm not a huge fan of curry, so even though it's in the title of recipe, I left it out ;-) 6) Instead of water, I used chicken stock as well as some liquid that I had reserved from draining off a batch of pumpkin puree. My final version is DELICIOUS and makes me feel like it's fall, even in a place where there's so little change between seasons!

I loved this recipe, but I did change it up. As per a previous reviewer, I roasted the squash first and scooped it out and since it's past season for fresh pumpkin, I used a can of puree. I used chicken broth and white wine instead of water. (Water? I don't think so!) I also didn't have any whole cloves or whole allspice berries, so I just added cinnamon and a pinch of ground cloves as well as kosher salt and lots of ground pepper right to the soup while it was simmering. We like things spicy, so I used hot curry powder and when that was too mild, I put in a dollop of hot curry paste and that did the trick! I never use heavy cream unless I have to whip it (WAY too many calories!) so I subbed in Fat Free Half and Half (fabulous stuff and great for anything that calls for cream) mixed with reduced fat buttermilk because I happened to already have some. The soup was rich, thick, spicy and yummy.

This was pretty amazing. I skipped the butternut squash and instead roasted a little pumpkin with olive oil, salt and pepper. I was using other half of the pumpkin for a pie, so I after I pureed the pie half, I drained it and used that liquid as stock. I also threw in some cumin and turmeric. Served with crusty bread with melted brie. Voila!

Due to the "bland" comments, I used canned chicken broth in place of water. I also substituted lowfat buttermilk in place of the heavy cream. This soup turned out delicious! I will add this to my very favorite recipes!

Wonderful. I roasted the butternut squash with olive oil salt and pepper, halved, on parchment paper in the oven until very soft. (skin side up)This may have spiced it up a bit, as others thought the recipe was bland. I served it with a few drops of creme in the center.

I was looking for a soup to serve with Christmas Dinner and found this to be quite bland. If you are looking for a good squash/pumpkin soup try the Winter Squash Soup with Gruyere Croutons on this website.

Too bland for me. I really wanted this to work. I must have done something wrong as it sounds so wonderful and seems it should be.

Canned pumpkin will work in a pinch--I substituted a cup of egg nog for the cream. Try adding fresh cracked white pepper with the chives--oh, and it needs salt.
