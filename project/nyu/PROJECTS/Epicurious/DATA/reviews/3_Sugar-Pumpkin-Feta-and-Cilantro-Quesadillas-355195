This was totally bland and not worth making. I'm a huge fan of butternut squash soup with jalapeño, so I thought this would be nice in a similar vein, but no. Even a sugar pumpkin wasn't flavorful enough.

This recipe was extremely bland, even with the doctoring that I did (lightly stir fried half a diced apple with the jalepeno). I did use canned pumpkin, but don't think 'real' pumpkin would have added that much. The recipe would be a lot tastier with 1-2 teaspoons of cumin added to the pumpkin mixture. Just a little more flavor to bring it from BLAH to SUBTLE YET DELICIOUS.

I made these for a party last night, and it was a hit! Even thought they were a little soggy by the time I got there, they were still delicious. I even forgot the lime, which I thought would be kind of integral to the whole thing. I think using extra cilantro is the key. I also went a bit lighter on the jalepeno so the spice was a pleasant surprise at the end of each bite, not an overpowering sensation.

I used canned pure pumpkin for this recipe rather than from scratch - when I make this again I will precook the jalepenos in a little oil so they are softer and mix in better with the pumpkin. The key is to get the ratio right, since it is a quesadilla - we found we needed a little more feta than the recipe suggests to hold everything together. But overall it was a delicious fall appetizer and I would totally make it again!

I made this with butternut squash for a reception. It got rave reviews. I used a cilantro pesto (cilantro, jalapeno, lime juice,garlic, salt and olive oil) instead of mixing jalapeno with squash and sprinkling w/ cilantro. It was a little more time consuming, but worth it! I'm making it again this week for another gathering.

The flavors are really delicious, but the texture is lacking. I added some diced apples after the first bite to lend some crunch.

If you're going to make this, make sure to seriously get to the point of charring the tortillas... there are few things worse than soggy butternut squash with half-melted feta chess in it. I think that, had I followed those directions more closely, this recipe would have been MUCH more appealing.

My roommate and I made these as an appetizer for our housewarming party. They were so easy to make and such a hit! We substituted goat cheese for feta and mixed pumpkin and butternut squash together for the puree. A delicious recipe that I look forward to making again!

Also, forgot to mention I ran out of regular tortillas and used my wheat ones. Also excellent!

Was looking for a unique recipe for game night over the holidays and wanted to also find somethng fall like. Plus half of my friends are vegetarians! Was unsure how good this sounded at first--but they were the biggest hit! I had to make more than I expected....delicious!!

This recipe has potential, but as it is it's just a bit bland. I haven't tried it yet, but perhaps some cumin in the pumpkin would help. It definitely needs a little something to push it over the edge from just okay to really tasty. As for cooking the pumpkin, I just roasted it in the oven cut in half until it was soft. Then I just scooped it out and it was reasonably spreadable. I think this is much easier than peeling and cubing it and then pureeing.

very yummy, but messy. when i make it next i will fold the tortilla in half, not stack one on top of the other.

I took lots of short cuts with this recipe and it turned out horribly, so if you're considering saving some time, don't bother with it. I used canned pumpkin since we were supposed to puree it anyway, and I substituted goat cheese for feta. The cilantro helped, but it just wasn't good.

I roasted the pumpkin and added some spices and this was still bland and heavy. I love cooking with pumpkin but this recipe is a dud; a real disappointment.

These quesadillas were fantastic and easy to prepare. I made them for my boyfriend and he couldn't stop praising them. The only change I made was using whole wheat tortillas instead of regular and cutting back on the jalapeno. I am making them again tonight with roasted pumpkin instead of boiled and will probably use more jalapeno to spice things up a bit.

This was just ok, not worth the effort of peeling and chopping the pumpkin. The lime and cilantro does help. If I make again, I would probably use butternut squash and roast instead of boiling. I much prefer the black bean and feta taco recipe on this site...which is also easier and faster to prepare.

I was skeptical of making the puree out of boiled pumpkin. I went with my gut instincts and roasted instead. I found the puree to be really tasty. I tossed the pumpkin with a bit of olive oil, salt, pepper and a bit of cumin. I'll definitely do this again - it was pretty easy and a fun change for quesadillas.

This recipe needs serious help. The pumpkin puree is not a good texture for a quesadilla. It would possibly be better if the pumpkin were roasted and not boiled then mashed by hand. As it is it has an off-putting texture and taste.

I really really liked this. I followed the recipe exactly save less jalepeno. Tried it with both whole wheat and reg. tortilla - reg were better cuz they get crispier. I just need a lesson on peeling pumpkins, I cut myself *impressively*.

Wonderful blend of flavors. I made this with butternut squash as the pumpkin was not available. We also used whole wheat tortillas & substituted 1/2 of the jalapeno with green chilies. It was pretty mushy. Next time I'll try baking the squash so it's a bit drier.

Very easy, very delicate flavors. My kids loved it. I used the "expensive" feta for this recipe and am very happy with the results.

I made this for my cooking club and everyone loved it!!! I used wheat tortillas as well...but did use the sugar pumpkin as called for. The flavors were wonderful. I wouldn't use too much pumpkin...stick to the 1/4 that is suggested. I will definitely make these again!

Super good. We used whole wheat tortillas and butternut squash and it was delicious. The lime really makes the flavors stand out. Don't substitute the feta for another kind of cheese. We tried parmesan and it wasn't as good as the feta quesadillas.

This was okay, but not great. The texture of the pumpkin was a bit too heavy and mushy for a quesadilla. I can think of lots of better ways to prepare pumpkin, and lots of better quesadilla fillings.
