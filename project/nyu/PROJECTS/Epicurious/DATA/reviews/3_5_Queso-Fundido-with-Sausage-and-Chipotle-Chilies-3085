The second time I made this, I used chorizo instead of italian sage for a more "authentic" Mexican flavor.

I agree with other reviews. This is a 4 fork recipe if you use chorizo and Mexican cheese. Don't bother making this if you don't use the authentic ingredients; it will taste italian not mexican.

A better version of this recipe is in the July 07 Bon Appetit mag. Queso Fundido with Chorizo.

Not very authentic as written. Good if you can't find fresh chorizo and Mexican cheeses, but the real thing is much better! I do like the addition of cilantro. Try adding a white onion while you are browning the sausage-adds a nice touch.

I made this dish years ago to rave reviews. It's become a party standard and everyone loves it. Heats up well the next day. Truly delicious.

A perfect recipe, nicely spiced. Used Spanish chorizo, but any spicy sausage would work well. I had to send the recipe home with my dinner guest.

This was great and easy to make. I used only chorizo, peppers and chihauha cheese. I cooked the chorizo, drained it on paper towels, added the peppers-put that combination on the bottom of an 8inch baking dish. I put the cheese on top and baked it at 350 for 10 minutes. I broiled it for a few minutes to melt the cheese more. It was better than any queso fundido that I have had out.

The recipe is 4 forks when chirizo sausage replaces the italian sausgae and chihuahua replaces the motery jack. Don't know why you would make a mexican dish with non mexican ingredients.

This dish was good. It was easy to make, can make it ahead, and has very good flavor. I would imagine that other types of sausage would work as well. I will make it again.

I used Boca's meatless Italian sausage, so (maybe not surprisingly) the sausage taste overpowered the other flavors -- even with extra chipotle. I've made other dishes with the same "sausage" that have somehow worked better. Probably only for true sausage-lovers.

Fabulous! Do yourself a favor and add chopped jalapeno and more chipolte.

Excellent and easy. We "like it hot" so while cooking the onions and sausage we added 2 minced Jalapeno peppers with seeds. Perfect!! Used 1lb of sausage instead of 1/2lb and used 3 large onions. Also used jalapeno jack cheese instead of regular jack cheese. Cooked for 30 min. Note be carfull with the adobo do not use more than 2 teaspoons, can really over power the dish if too much is used. The first time we made this we used about 2 tablespoons of adobo and although it was still good the adobo flavor was too strong. Served with Mexican Corn, in recipe search, and a box mix mexican rice.

Great casual party food (even though it's a little messy) & the men really seem to love it! I had several requests for the recipe. It was a little greasy but there were no complaints!!

I liked this alot. I definately prefer with corn tortillas. I used mild italian instead of hot and then put a ton of chipotles for the spiciness. That way I got the flavour of the adobo which is wonderful. I served it with a milder version of corn and zuchinni saute found in the mexican section of the recipe file. Fun Food.

I have made this numerous times. It is always a big hit. I usually have had to cook it longer the 20 minutes. But be careful it is VERY HOT!!!!

This is unbelievable--and hot! I have made it several times and everyone loves it. I also love it as a quesadilla filling served with tomatillo salsa. I find that I need to heat the tortillas longer than the recipe indicates.

Great for football Sunday (but messy). Incredibly greasy but worth it - spicy, warm and delicious.
