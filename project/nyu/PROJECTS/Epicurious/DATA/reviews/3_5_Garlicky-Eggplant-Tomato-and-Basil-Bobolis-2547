Have made this several times and it has been very much enjoyed by everyone. I make this with my regular homemade pizza crust instead of the Boboli pre-made crusts --- it works just as well that way. First time I made it thought the raw garlic was a bit much --- but now I roast the garlic first and love the sweet roasted taste. If fresh tomatoes aren't in season, I've made this successfully with a chunky, basil tomato sauce -- different than with fresh tomatoes, but still quite good.

Very good, quick and easy dinner.

Nothing special here. Wouldn't waste time making it again.

I have made this every few months for years. Also recently served it at a party and people said they liked it, asked for the recipe, and ate up every bit. Best when fresh tomatoes are in season.

This is good, but next time I'll roast the garlic first, since it was a bit overpowering. Also, I'll bake the pizza at a slightly lower temp. My crust was a bit overdone. It is easy to make, and didn't take a lot of time to prepare.

Surprised to hear previous cook say it had no flavor. I've made it twice and love the garlicky kick.

Extremely disappointing recipe - sloppy, lots of work, almost no flavor. I am a good cook, but not this time! Would NEVER make it again!

This is one of our all-time favorites, we make it again and again. We usually experiment: our favorite combinations have red onion rings and marinated artichoke hearts, and we substitute smoked gouda for the mozzarella. Any way you make it, though, it's great!

This is delicious. I used pesto on the crust, as suggested. It took longer (2 HOURS!) than I had anticipated (for pizza) due to the prep time of the veggies, but it was worth it. I found out that my boyfriend doesn't love a lot of goat cheese, so next time, I will just use a 3oz package. I will definitely make this again, even change it around to incorporate some leftovers in the fridge!

This was easy and delicious! Thanks for the advice on adding a layer of pesto. It really added depth to the flavor. I'll be making this recipe over and over again!

I added a layer of my homemade pesto on the bottom, and used a regular eggplant, peeled, sliced and broiled. It was very tasty and easy.

Great recipe. I serve as an entree with a chopped salad. Always use when my vegetarian friends come over. Also make extra's (don't bake them) wrap in tin foil and freeze. Simply thaw and bake--it comes out great every time.
