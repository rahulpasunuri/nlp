This is an excellent vegetarian recipe. You must have an outstanding ratatouille recipe instead of the one posted. Also, top the stuffed mushrooms with an excellent freshly grated cheese and lots of it.

I forgot the tomato sauce. I hate tyme so i ommited it and used cumin instead. I loved it. I couldn't find big enough portobello caps so I thought I had way to much ratatouille! The mushrooms were quuite good to nibble on in contrast.

I fully agree with Bergamo, Italy. I would not be surprised the Ratatouille she refers to is the one of North Africa where fresh vegetables are plentiful and where I believe the dish originates from. Definitely NO tomato paste and a waste of Portobello mushrooms.

I have tried many of the ratatouille dishes on this website and this is one of my favorites bar far. Mine was not at all dry or bland - I cooked this slowly on a very low temperature and used 1 tsp of dried rubbed thyme. It serves 4 generously, and is cholesterol free.

I grew up in the Mediterranean where we ate Ratatouille almost once a week. I still cook it very often but surely not with tomato paste. No wonder it was dry. We always use 3 fresh tomatoes.First we saute the vegetables in a pan, then add the tomatoes and let it cook in the tomatoes juice together with wine vinegar. The authentic version calls for mint as opposed to thyme and at the very end add a mixture of green and Kalamata olives and a tablespoon of capers. A touch of fresh minced garlic seals the deal. This dish is far from bland when cooked the right way.

Toss the mushrooms in a mix of flour and cajun spice mix, add some basil and tabasco to the ratatouille and substitute rabe for the spinach and this is very good. Just needs to be kicked up a bit.

I agree...pretty bland, although a nice idea and the presentation was very nice.

This recipe was a bit disappointing, and there is a lot of prep work. We thought it was a tad bland. I had some leftover Swiss chard and mixed it with the spinach. We served it with grits, which was a good complement to the ratatouille.

Very easy to make, presentation was very nice. My husband must have meat, so with his portion I used some italian chicken sausages that were chopped and sauted. Did not think this was too dry.

Very dry while doing the preliminary cooking of vegetables, easy to scorch. Had to use a little more oil/liquid. Substituted red wine (California Merlot) for the vinegar. After baking in oven came out excellent very good looking dish as well as tasty

Excellent, unusual & pretty to look at. I have also served this without the spinach over penne...or you could chop the spinach & mix with garlic, olive oil & penne & put mushroom filled with ratatouille on top. Serve with fresh grated parmesano.

I wasn't crazy about this dish. I thought the tastes did not mesh. I would eat it if on a diet, but wouldn't serve it to friends.

My husband enjoyed it more than I did. I thought it was a little too dry, but he thought it was perfect. I would make again but add some vegetable broth to help moisten it a little. Also, it is important to have large enough mushrooms, mine were too small.

I substitued a small can of chopped tomatoes for the eggplant, as I did not have any eggplant in the house. I also used PAM to coat the pans when I sauted the veggies. This is wonderful over brown rice and healthy too!
