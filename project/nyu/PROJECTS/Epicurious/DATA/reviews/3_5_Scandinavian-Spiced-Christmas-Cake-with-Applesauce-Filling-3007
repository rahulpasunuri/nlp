I was pretty nervous to make this after reading the 2 reviews that said the middle didn't rise. Despite that, I gulped and made it exactly as written and did not have any problem with it not rising. The hardest part of the recipe was cutting the cake into 3 even layers. This recipe is very labor-intensive and the results, tastewise, were good, but not fabulous. It was a pretty cake, it just didn't have the wow factor in taste that I would hope for after working that hard!

The middle of mine didn't rise, either! I didn't mix the baking soda with the water because I, too, found that strange. I'm really bummed as I'm making this for a faculty holiday party. I'm trying it with a ginger cream cheese icing and hoping that will take care of the "sunken" middle. I'm determined to get this to work.

I loved the cake more than anything I have eaten in years. Best cake ever.

I really liked all the individual elements of this cake, but when I put them all together it just didn't work. Maybe try a different frosting?

The flavor of this cake is absolutely wonderful however there is something wrong with the recipe as the cake didn't rise in the middle. I tried twice thinking I did something wrong. It seemed odd to me to use solid vegetable shortening and dissolving the baking soda in water. I'll try it again with butter instead of shortening and not dissolving the baking soda in water. The flavor of this cake is addictive and worth figuring out the problem with the recipe.
