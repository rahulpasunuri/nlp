I made this as a salad, the same as another review. I didn't have any chipotle chile powder, so I used a mix of regular chili powder & smokey paprika. It turned out really well! Everyone loved it! I will definitely make this again!

We didn't see the point. The lime and spice got in the way of the corn flavor; I'd rather eat with a little salted butter. Maybe if I had to make do with less-than-perfect corn, this would be a nice way to gussy it up.

a nice change from the usual salt and butter; Definitely use more chile than listed

I'm usually not one who is interested in anything other than a pat of butter and some salt on my corn, but this sounded so refreshing with the spicy dinner I was making. It truly was refreshing and delicious. We'll definitely make it again next time we have corn!

served this with the pomegranate lamb and grilled zucchini (both also found in epicurious). I got rave reviews. This sause is a great alternative to ranch dressing for sandwiches too.

loved this recipe, my husband even uses the cut kernels of corn with the sauce in his burritos and pitas. Sauce is better if left in fridge for a day.

I will absolutley make this again. A nice change from regular corn on the cob with butter. After grilling, i cut the kernals off the cobs and mixed in the other ingredients to make a sort of salad/side dish. I used sour cream, as it was what i had on hand, but otherwise used the ingredients as written. Delicious, fresh tasting and different!

A keeper! I don't usually put anything on corn except butter but this intriged me. The juxtaposition of the tart lime with the smooth crema and the heat of the chile was great. My only change was to double the chipotle powder.
