Very good, however, topping was a little watery, so add more gelatin or use less water.

This was a pretty dry, unspectacular cheesecake. Invest the cream cheese in another recipe.

It was a hit at the family get-together! Even die-hard dieters had to have a slice and it was the hottest thing at the dinner. The topping tends to slide off your cake everytime you try to slice it so beware. The cake isn't going to look very pretty after the first slice. The cheesecake cracked while baking, but the defects were nicely covered with the topping. I agree that you could not even taste vanilla in the cake. Add more extract/beans. Definitely get your hands on some good quality nectar. Otherwise, it could get runny and bland. Cooking time was a little short, keep an eye on it, but leave it in a tad longer. Excellent overall!

I thought this was a pretty good cheesecake, but my husband and friends really enjoyed it. The topping was tasty, but received comparisons to pate and the hard grease that's left over after boiling meat. Yuck! You can make a better-textured topping (with a pinker color) by melting guava paste, then pouring it on top of the cheesecake. That also gives it a stronger flavor of guava, which contrasts nicely with the flavor of the cheesecake.

I truly enjoyed the texture of this cake, but felt that it lacked the vanilla flavor to be great. Granted, the guava topping did add a different twist to this family favorite. I definitely suggest adding a bit more vanilla bean, or possibly some extract.

I wasn't too crazy about this cheesecake. For the same amount of work put into this, there are other recipes that are creamier or denser with much more flavor.

I made this cheesecake for Christmas, and it was a huge hit-it was the only dessert to be completely finished. It had a beautiful presentation and texture, but I had some trouble with the baking time (the center wasn't cooked but everything else was pretty brown) and the flavor, though excellent, could use (in my opinion) a little more vanilla, so next time I might add more bean or extract. The crust was great. Overall a great cheesecake :)

Made this on reco from someone who raved. Made the shortbread pecan crust from another recipe.Crust was good, but I thought the taste was fair,(could use more vanilla) and 1 hour is too long at this temp. It cracked (not a big deal), and while I like a "dense" cheesecake vs. a "creamy" texture, this was too hard for me. Prefer my other recipes to this - even the mascarpone recipe is better

This is a divine cheesecake! I love the texture, taste and the overall look of it. I made this knowing my family was coming to visit (big cheesecake lovers) and they absolutely fell in love with this. My fiance and I were hoping there would be some left over, but there wasn't so I am going to make it again tomorrow!

I actually didn't make this particular recipe but it is similar to mine except I use 3/4 cup sugar then after the cake has baked I take the sour cream and stir in the remainder 1/4 cup sugar and pour that over the top. Put in 500 degree oven for about 10-15 minutes. Also beat your egg whites and fold them in. Makes for a much lighter, fluffier cake.

Rather than going through all of the hassle of changing the temperature, try baking your cheesecake in a water bath. Only the top will brown. And it will not crack.

This cheeseake was wonderful. The guave topping was perfect with the cheesecake. If you do not want your cheesecake to crack bake it at 500 degrees for ten minutes that at 200 degree for 90 minutes. I got this tip from Cook's Illustrated. Works like a charm.
