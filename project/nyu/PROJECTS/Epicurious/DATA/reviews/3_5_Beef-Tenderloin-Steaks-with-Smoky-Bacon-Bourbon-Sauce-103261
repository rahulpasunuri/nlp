This is our Christmas dinner each year. We have chosen to cook the tenderloin to an internal temp of 120, let rest, slice and top with sauce. Return to oven and let meat cook slightly more with sauce. It is perfection.

This sauce was not all that good. I served it for company and nobody really touched it. It took much longer to thicken up than it said and I had to continue to add more flour. I did add some liquid smoke to get the smokey flavor promised, but that didn't help much. I grilled the steaks - which I always do. There's no point in pan frying a steak when a grill will cook it better! A bernaise sauce would have been a better choice.

Tasted like something between a Burgundy sauce and bbq sauce. Weird. I wouldn't ruin filet mignon with it.

Everyone loved the sauce. I did not get lo sodium for both broths and I thought it was a bit salty for my taste,but everyone else was loving it on both the beef and the mashed potatoes. I put a bit more bourbon in so I could get the flavor to stand out a bit more.

Instead of beef tenderloin, I served wtih grilled chicken and was succesful yet again with a great sauce.

This recipe has received 3 or 4 forks from everone...I have to disagree. The sauce is nothing more than common brown gravy with bacon in it. It tastes ok, but it shouldn't go on tenderlion. Make a more traditional tenderloin sauce (buerre rouge or bearnaise), neither takes any more time and both are soooooo much better

I made this for a small family gathering and got RAVE reviews...people were moaning with every bite! It was outstanding!

I agree with others that low-sodium broths should be used.

Excellent - would use half as much flour (1 1/2 teaspoons) when making the sauce. The bourbon didn't seem to add anything to the dish.

Only took about an hour to make and was very good. Used the remaining sauce a few days later with hamburgers and was also good.

Had some left over beef tenderloin from the holidays, put this sauce over it and it was fabulous. Just be sure to use the lower sodium broths.

The sauce was fantastic! If you love bacon, you will adore this sauce--It goes with everything.

Fortunately, the sauce made up for my steak, which was a bit leathery (as usual). The sauce had a full-bodied flavour and was easy to make. Next time I'll try grilling my steak and perhaps marinating it first to ensure tenderness.

This is a great recipie. My boyfriend who is very fussy didn't want to try it, but now he raves about it. One thing though, I think adding 3-4 tablespoons of brown sugar sweetens the sauce just enough and makes it even more tasty.

The smokey bacon-bourbon sauce was a disappointment. I served this for a Valentine's Day dinner for my husband. While he said he liked the sauce, I'm convinced that he was being polite. Grill the beef - there is not other way too cook filet.

this recipe looked like it might be hard, but actually it was pretty easy. and very good! this dish went well with red and white wine! wish this recipe would have used cream though b/c the potatoes did not use quite enough. this dish went well with LOTS of red and white wine. 2, 3 bottles? green beans were a good side dish (but make sure they are fresh, ok?) and also the potatoes. not sure what we're having for dessert yet... overall, good recipe! 9 out of 10 forks

I made this dish when my husband and I had beef-lover-friends over for dinner. We all loved it. Yes, it was a little salty side, but the flavor of the sauce was just wonderful. When I saw them the next day, they said that they had dreamed about the sauce that night.

Simple and delicious. I have prepared this on 3 occasions and have shared the recipe each time. How can you go wrong with bacon and bourbon???

Other reviewers were right, this was VERY salty, even with the low-sodium broth and the reduced-sodium bacon I used. But it was delicious. We served it to two 9-year olds and a 7-year old as well, and they loved it too. I found there was more than enough sauce for 2 lbs. of tenderloin. We had it with french fries and a salad and that made it a real family (kid-pleasing) meal.

I made this as a special pre-Christmas dinner for my new partner. He tried to eat it as slowly as possible to savour every mouthful... I served it with a '99 Chateauneuf-de-Nerthe - absolutely spectacular combination!! My only criticism is that next time I will make the extra effort to locate low-sodium stocks, or will make my own, as the sauce was a wee bit salty. We'd rate this with ten forks, if we could!

This recipe was surprisingly easy and was a huge hit with our guests. We loved the sauce. I served the sauce over grilled bacon wrapped filet mignon with baked potatoes and wild mushrooms saute. I will make this recipe over and over again!

This (relatively) quick and easy reduction sauce has nothing to envy those served at fancy restaurants. It was very yummy and I'd recommend it for when you want to serve something special but you don't want to spend too much time making it.

wonderful! husband and kids raved, will add this to my catering line-up. you can use one less pan by cooking the bacon, using the same pan for the steaks, then letting the meat rest in foil while you finish the sauce in the same pan.

WOW! My hubby wanted to drink it right out of the gravy boat! The only thing I would add to make it perfect would be some mushrooms! Perfection! I'm sending this recipe to all my friends!

This recipe is my claim to fame! My husband finally believed I could cook when I made this! I make this on a regular basis for company and always am asked for the recipe...don't change a thing and it is always superb! Enjoy!

I would use low sodium everything. Have received compliments everytime I make it. I have also saved the extra sauce and used it on other cuts of meats. Overall, excellent!

This recipe has become a Christmas tradition in my family. The first year I made this, the dinner table was quite with happy diners and not a drop was left. I hope you and your family enjoy it as much as my friends and family have. Happy holidays

Wonderful smooth rich dark sauce. Used low salt broth..browned mushrooms after fried bacon. Cooked steaks on the grill. Ummmmm

Made it twice. First time, I followed the recipe. Too salty as many people have pointed out. Second time, I used my own stocks, low sodium bacon, and I went extra-easy with the salt on the steaks. Perfect. I rocemmend the recipe to all.

Made this dish for Father's Day and Dad the "beef lover" is still raving. A wonderful, full flavored dish beyond compare. I can't wait to make it again.

My family loved it; good call with the garlic mashed. I had no salt issues, but . . . The sauce was thinner than I would have liked. Next time 2tbsp of drippings and 2 tbsp of flour. I'm also going to get the bacon down to "bits" size.

I made this dish for a Valentine's Day and my fiance was so delighted, let just say the night was a success!!!! I complimented it with roasted garlic mash pototoes and homemade beer breed. It is definetly a keeper. Thanx Epicurious!!!

If you like this one, you will really love epicurious--STEAK with SHALLOT-MERLOT SAUCE. http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=100643&printer=true. I mention this one because the sauce is so fabulous. It also reduces the liquid, but there is less of it. When I make this one, based on what others have said, I will only use 4 strips of thick slice bacon. The 8 oz. they call for seems to make it to salty. Then I wll CONSIDER reducing the amount of liquid to......1 cup of dry red wine and 1 cup of canned beef broth, & eliminate the chicken broth. Reduce tomato paste to 1 tea. and see how that works.

Rating: 3
Another reason this sauce turns out so salty is that beef broth from a can (even the low sodium type) can be packed with msg/sodium. When you significantly reduce large amounts of it, it comes out salty. Instead use real beef stock.

I will add my voice to those who love this recipe. I thought it was fantastic. I used low-salt bacon, low-salt broths, and did not add salt to the meat, either before or after cooking. I served it with steamed carrots and rice, which were perfect accompaniments. A must-repeat recipe.

A fan favorite at my table. Be carefull with burbon can quickly over power. Goes great with venison.

I doubled the amounts and the times and basted a 3lb beef tenderloin on the grill. Used the extra ssuce on the table with mixed sugar snap peas and carrots "toothpicks". The result was absoutley fabulous - got rave reveiws from my guests.

Well.....I'm no FOOL. I have been salting my meat for 40 years JUST before cooking to flavor and texture. The only time NOT to salt is when you MARINATE or for any length of time! The salt will have an adverse effect upon the meat by removing water( along with natural juices ) If done within a couple of hours, DO salt/season for an excellent flavorable piece of meat.

Rating: 3
Just so you know, that is a myth about salting meat before cooking. It does not make it tough, and it gives it a nice crust after searing, which keeps the juices IN.

Rating: 0
You FOOLS, you never, never, never, never NEVER sprinkle salt on steaks (or chicken or fish) before you cook them. Salt will draw out all the moisture in your meat and make it dry and tough. All salting should be done AFTER cooking....esp with something as wonderful as steaks.

After reading the bad reviews I had to add mine. I thought this was one of the best recipes! I used Jack Daniels and smoky bacon instead of regular. I did NOT put salt on the steak. The sauce was salty enough. I will tell others about this recipe and make it again myself!!!

Rating: 4
Tasted good to me. I never put the bourbon in the sauce because I got too busy drinking it. Whatever I ended up making tasted good. I strongly recommend drinking the bourbon rather than putting it in the sauce.

Rating: 1
The reduction took as long as I expected, but after the reduction, I tasted the sauce and found it salty. I couldn't imagine how salty it would be after making a roux with the bacon grease. It was far beyond the salt level I could tolerate. The sauce would have been close to perfect if the roux were made with butter. As for the steaks, I used rib-eye because that's what I had on hand. Steak is steak, but sauce can make or break a meal.

Rating: 2
Totally not worth the effort! Reduction took forever, flavor was overpowering for a filet and the bourbon could have been skipped altogether. Overall just didn't like it.

Rating: 3
I used a Kendall-Jackson cab for the wine and added a small sprig of fresh rosemary in the reduction. I also found that Jack Daniels worked best for the oakey quality it has.This dish pairs well with twice baked potato and fresh asparagus, which, luckily is now in season here. I always enjoy fresh holliandaise with asparagus. Give this one a try!
