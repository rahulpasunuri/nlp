Help! This recipe sounds delicious, but I just poured my first attempt down the drain. Does anyone have any tips on getting the custard right? I thought I followed directions, but it curdled...and I often have this problem when making a custard.

delicious and smooth!! the currants were a lovely change from the typical rum raisin ice creams on the market. no need to buy them anymore - this one is as good or better. this one definitely goes in the recipe box. try it!!

Perfect decadence. I strongly recommend that you use currants if you can find them. I successfully doubled the recipe in my 2Q machine. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

I made this for our Valentine's Day dessert. I used dried cherries instead of currants, and cognac instead of rum, and it was delicious. Store-bought ice cream, even the good stuff, cannot compare.

Never written a review before but WOW! I gave everyone a taste that came into my house for a week... they couldn't believe it was homemade. I'm a fan of Hagan Däz's Rum Raisin... they've got nothing on this recipe! I used dried cherries, as well... oh the fattening of it all... but what a way to go! :)
