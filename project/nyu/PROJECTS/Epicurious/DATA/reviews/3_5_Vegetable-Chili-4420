forgot to mention... instead of using two cans of kidney beans, I used one can of kidney beans and one can of black beans... just to make it more interesting!

Trying to reduce the meat we consume and this is a very good chili recipe - did not miss the meat at all. After looking over several vegetable chili recipes, I tried to take the best from all, and these are the changes I made - they are minor. I substituted two chopped carrots for one of the bell peppers, and cooked the bell pepper and carrots along with the onion and garlic. After 10 minutes, when they were soft, I added the spices, until fragrant, 30 seconds, then added the tomatoes and green chilies for 10 minutes, following the rest of the recipe as described. I also topped it with some avocado after plating. The texture and mildness of the avocado offset the chili really well! Bon appetit!

This recipe was great after I doctored it up a bit! I added Veggie ground meat, swapped canned pinto's in for kidneys, and added more spice (specifically cumin). I also omitted the corn as I find corn hard to digest. My version was AMAZING! my family loved it and it made a lot for leftovers during the week!

A favorite! I came across this recipe several years ago - my family loves it, and I love giving them a wholesome dinner with so many vegetables and beans. We have it almost once a week all fall and winter. It is easy to make in huge batches and freezes well. We enjoy it with whole-wheat cornbread. Perfect exactly as written.

I followed the recipe to the letter but added four diced carrots. Hardly needed salt and had a bit of heat. You may want to add red pepper flakes if you're a fan of spicy chili. This recipe was a hit and will be added to my repertoire!

I have made this chili as well as the "Full O' Beans Chili" also from this website, and each one is very good on its own, but when I add the beans from the latter to the seasonings, liquid and veggies of this recipe, I dare say I've upped the ante and the resulting recipe is a 4-star vegetarian delight.

This was a hit with my vegetarian (for now) daughter and with my husband. Even my son liked it; although he said he would prefer it with meat. I added zucchini and served it with a no-sugar cornbread recipe from this site. A great meal!

I made a big batch of this tonight and thought it tasted great. I did add some veggies I had on hand (carrots, green onions, green beans) and it makes it even better I think.

Great option for vegetarians, although I'm still a meat fan myself. I made it the day before serving to friends, and added a some extra cumin and chili powder when I reheated it. Also, I served it with non-fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, which worked very well.

This was fantastic. I did a few substitutions: did canned chipotle chilies since i didn't have green chilies and 1 can of kidney beans plus 1 can of spicy black beans (instead of two kidney). also added 1.5 tsp of red pepper flakes. it had a good amount of heat after all that so if you're not into that may want to avoid the red pepper flakes. really delicious.

I made this last year (see review below) and tried it again yesterday. Great, easy recipe! I substituted one can of black beans for the kidney beans to mix it up. My little nyc bodega didn't have green chilies, so I put red pepper flakes and lots of fresh ground pepper. If I had had a fresh jalepeno, I definitely would have used it! Some additional spice would have been welcome. Very healthy and filling!

Excellent, but I still prefer chili with meat. Nonetheless, this was really flavorful. Healthy too. Recommended.

This chili was delicious! I added pinto beans, zucchini, and carrots and served over brown rice. Who needs meat?

This was so easy to prepare and has the taste of real chili that has been cooking all day. I roasted the veggies first for added depth of flavor. I also mix in a little brown rice for substance.

oops... in my previous post I forgot to mention that the amounts of ingredients I added were for a double recipe, so in reality they should be halved for the size of the recipe on the web site.

This was a very good recipe. I made it for the first time for a chili cookoff at work. We have a number of vegans at work so I wanted to include them in the tasting process. I made modifications, some based of previous reviews. I halved the oregano and substituted dried cilantro for the rest of the required measurement plus I finely cut up cilantro stems, and at the end stired in a little fresh cilantro leaf. I also added 2 finely diced Jalapeno peppers, used "hot" diced mild green chiles, added more of all the spices and about 1 tbsp ground red pepper. More Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper. Also about 2 tbsp masa harina mixed in with about 8 oz veggie broth. That seemed to add some nice liquid that, when cooked down, was lovely. I did cook for more like 1.5-2hrs then stired in some sauted Quorn meatless meat. A dash of Cocoa was also added. Very good, will make again. Lots of layers, had a mild taste at first, but major kick after you swallow. Not too hot or unpleasant, but it makes itself known!!

This is a very good veggie chili. Substituted fresh jalapenos for the canned chilis, and added a bit of cinnamon and hoppy beer (I threw in some Stone IPA). Still wasn't hot enough for my taste, so i added some hot pepper flakes. If you like veggies, you won't miss the meat at all!

I love this recipe. I have been making it for a number of years. I have made it adding "Quorn" meat substitute and my meat eating friends cannot even tell that it is meatless. Sometimes I use black beans or a combo. I usually add some dried red pepper flakes or use some hot chili powder as I like my chili spicy. Served with choices of chopped tomatoes, sliced black olives, shredded cheese, sour cream, guacamole, etc. Who could ask for more? I have found it to be the best chili recipe I have ever found. Easy too!

I made this the first time for a meat-loving crowd, but because there was one vegetarian at the party, I had to make something meatless. This was the first thing to go! The entire pot of chili was gone in about 30 minutes, and nobody missed the meat. Delish!

Have already made this a few times and served it for company..........It has been such a great hit. I have added a couple different types of beans in and it is even better the next day!

YUMMY! One thing: I'm not sure if the chili powder that I used was the kind intended by this recipe - the end result was REALLY HOT, but I liked it anyway. I think next time I might scale back to maybe 1 tbsp. (I use red chili powder from an Indian spice shop.) I substituted fresh chopped cilantro leaves (added near the end of cooking) for the oregano and used a mixture of kidney, black, pinto and black-eyed beans for this. Also, instead of two green, I used 1 green, 1 red and 1 yellow bell pepper and roasted them in the toaster oven before chopping and adding them. This recipe makes SO MUCH. It would probably feed ten, especially if serving with rice or bread and topped with grated cheddar cheese and sour cream (which is a must). Once we run out, I'll for sure make this again.

I did a couple of things different with this, but pretty much followed the recipe. I added 3 can of MEXICAN STYLE tomatoes instead of regular, and put in 1 can of pinto beans and 1 can of kidney beans. At the end I added 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar and that is it. It was delicious. You couldn't even tell their wasn't meat in it. It was so good! I'd definately make it again, alot!

Not quite three forks but very close. Easy to make and can be adapated to suit your preferences. I might add fresh chopped tomato next time. I used a mix of kidney and black beans which turned out well.

I have to agree with the earlier reviewer who stated that this wasn't a particularly great vegetarian chili recipe. I've had much, much better. The flavors just weren't particularly outstanding. If I try it again, I'd do some serious doctoring.

I made this chili for a dinner party, and it was a big hit- even with my boyfriend who usually scorns anything meatless. I also omitted the oregano, but made no other alterations. Especially good with grated cheddar and sour cream!!

I made this on a snowy day, had it for lunch and was good enough to have it for supper. I used only 2 Tbsp. of chili powder and added a bay leaf to the spices and it turned out delicious.

I omit the oregano because it takes away from the "Tex-Mex" flavor. I also used Delmonte brand Mexican stewed tomatos which has a great spices added. Another thing I like to do is to use one can of dark red kidney beans and one can of white kidney beans for the beautiful color!

I wanted to have a chili-tasting party for my husband's birthday. I already had my mother's wonderful beef chili recipe and a close friend's amazing white-chicken chili recipe, but we have many vegetarian friends, so I had to search for a vegetable chili recipe to have in my tasting. I was told about Epicurious by a friend and was so overwhelmed to find all the delicous sounding recipes available. I used this one. I was completely convinced that everyone would rave over my mom's recipe ---- but believe it or not the crowd went crazy over the vegetable chili more than anything! Delicious! Definitely use all the garlic it calls for. I also added 1 1/2 cups of water. YUM!

I make a version of this as a winter staple. Red peppers instead of green because they're healthier, no oil or sauteing is necessary at all. Ocra makes it thick and some black beans add a bit more fiber. Yellow squash , zucchini also are good additions.

Since it was chili with a southwest bent, thought that it should have garbanzos, so I adjusted everything accordingly - a good modification. I served it with chili-cheese cornbread. A great choice for a cold Fall day.

I thought this was a fantastic vegetarian chili- lots of taste! I altered the recipe a little by adding a package of vegetarian ground round (plus, a little more diced tomato so it wouldn't get too thick). This is a great meal to enjoy with cornbread on a cool night. I highly recommend it!

I used four cans of Mexican-style diced tomatoes and three cans of beans -- black, red kidney and cannellini -- and increased the spices proportionately. Chili came out colorful and very delicious ... full-flavored and zippy but not too hot. Tasted wonderful over brown rice. I'll be making this a lot over the winter!

I loved this chili. I usually find myself adding a bunch of seasonings to recipes of such bold tasting dishes, but the spices in this dish were measured very accurately. It did not lack anything.This is an excellent vegetarian dish, and can be a base of a meat chili as my husband experienced after adding some ground turkey into his portion.
