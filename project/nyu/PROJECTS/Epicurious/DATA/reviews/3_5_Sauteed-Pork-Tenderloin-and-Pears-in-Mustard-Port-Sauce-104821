Always a winner. I've never had anyone not love it. I don't often have port at home, so I usually substitute more broth, or sometimes pear juice or apple cider. And I'll use this for chops or pork steak, too, depending on what I have in the house.

Fast and easy with great flavor. An interesting change from the many cream based sauces for tenderloins.

Halved the butter, and used lamb boullion instead of chicken broth. Skipped flour breading to make it more healthy. All in all, fast and tasty. My pears were big and more spherical than oblong--quarters were too big to cook through, next time I will cut them into smaller pieces. The sauce is really nice. Served on fresh spinach for color (as others have said, the color here is drab). This is good for a stove top tenderloin, but I still prefer the salt and pepper crusted oven roasted recipe here on epi.

I made this for a birthday dinner last night, and it was heavenly. We all thought we were at a fine restaurant! Used a Zinfandel port; will try it with the tawny port next time. Served it with cheesy grits and green beans. Plates were licked clean!

I made this recipe exactly as the recipe said and it was great. It does look like a stew -- kind of brown, but I served it on kasha, which is cream color and added green peas on the side. It might not have been the prettiest meal ever, but the taste was wonderful. My husband who is a fan of good port liked it really well.

While this dish tasted quite delicious, it's presentation leaves a bit to be desired. It's all one color, and a little mealy looking at that. But, the tastes were great.

Very nice, used petit sirah port. My tenderloing was too tiny to cut into slices - I left them whole just cooked them a bit longer. Then served over cous cous - very nice. Used unripe pears and cooked them for a long time in the butter to soften.

Don't you love it when people write a review about how great a recipe is and then they change half the ingredients so it's something completely different! This recipe only so-so. I didn't have pork, so I used beef jerky and I didn't have port, so I used some whiskey to soak the jerky in until it was soft and I didn't have any mustard or pears or any of those other ingredients so I just drank the whiskey while I let the beef jerky marinade. Then I took a nap and when I came back to the kitchen, the beef jerky was all soft like the tongue of an old boot. I added some black molassess and some old percussion caps that were in my jacket pocket (to add a little "kick") and let the whole conflagration roast away in the oven while I finished my whiskey!

Made this last night after a long work day and was really pleased with how easy it was. Same amount of effort as a Hamburger Helper and tastes SO much better! I didn't have port so I borrowed an idea from another reviewer and used Reisling and balsamic vinegar. I think the vinegar helped balance out the sweetness. Two pears were enough for me, maybe would add one more if I had company.

Pleases every time, and great company food! Usually substitute whole grain mustard for the dijon, giving it an extra kick. Over couscous it's divine, and warms up great for lunch leftovers the next day.

Really terrific recipe. Substituted the Port with a full-bodied California Zinfandel to hold down the sweetness generated by the Port and pears. Served with Asparagus simply seasoned (olive oil, kosher salt, and pepper) and roasted-garlic mash potatos.

This is a very easy, quick recipe. My husband and I loved it. My daughter actually ate it. I wish I would have made 2 tenderloins as there were no left overs and we could have eaten more. I was about 1/4 cup short with the port and added some pear nectar to bring it up to the correct amount.

This is a question not a review. Can this recipe be adapted to use leftover grilled pork tenderloin. Need to use a whole tenderloin filet and looking for a different, elegant way for the leftover. Can you get back to me ASAP. Thanks. 10/25/07

Rating: 4
What a super yummy, easy meal! I cut the medallions a bit thick, so had to add a bit of water near the end to cook them for about 5 minutes longer than the recipe called for. This allowed the pears to cook a bit more, which was a good thing- not too crunchy. I used honey dijon and it worked great. A great recipe- everyone went back for seconds!

Rating: 3
This is very good and is highly recommended. It's not going to blow your mind, but it's really a very quick and a great "let's have a nice dinner" on a weeknight thing. MAKE SURE your pears are NOT RIPE! I used 1 that was, and it was an unmitigated disaster. The other 2 I used were quite frankly completely unripe. I mean *hard*. But they turned out fantastic!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I had to make some small adjustments because I didn't have all the exact ingredients. I used dry marsala instead of port. I used Anjou pears instead of Bartlett. I used whole grain creole mustard from the US instead of whole grain dijon. It was still excellent. This is an excellent and quick to prepare recipe. My somewhat-picky husband inhaled it. I loved it as well.

I've used both Ruby and Tawny port for this recipe. Ruby port is by far the better choice.

Rating: 3
I see from the many reviews that people love or hate this recipe! I am in the "love it" category, and have made it several times, and passed it on to friends. It is simple to make, but I have found that it is really important to use pears that are just about to turn ripe, a tricky business, since our markets seem to stock green pears that sometimes ripen while I have my back turned! I have added this recipe to my "old standby" collection for recipes that can be made fairly quickly, even on a weeknight after work, and find the subtle combination of Tawny port, pears, and mustards to be quite delicious.

Rating: 1
Not worth making again. My 11 year old liked it (especially the pears). My husband hated the (texture of the) pears, and I found the pork a little slimy.

The sauce is really what makes the dish. Instead of cutting the terderloin into medallions, I cooked it whole by seasoning it and rubbing it with dried sage, searing it in a pan and then roasting in the oven.

Rating: 4
fantastic... always tender, always moist. the the technique works well if you substitute!

Rating: 3
A very good dish. I used only whole grain Dijon mustard, rather than both Dijon mustards. Because this dish lacks spices, it is important to use a good mustard and a good port, or you run the risk of producing something fairly bland. Using an unripe (firm) pear gives good crisp texture, contrasting with the soft tenderloin. We drank a young Canadian Pinot Noir with this, which was an adequate match. But this dish is fairly robust, so a more full-bodied red might be suitable.

This is in my regular weekly menu group. We love it! But for a weekly dish I just leave out the pears, works well, I have everything else on hand.

I have made this twice and it is excellent. It seems like a lot of pears, but they turn out great. I cut mine a bit thinner, though. Be sure to use firm pears. I tried ripe ones as that is the way I prefer to eat them raw, but they get mushy in this recipe. Even the kids loved it!

Rating: 4
Excellent - will become one of my favorite ways to make pork tenderloin. Was very tender and full of flavor. Substituted 1/2 the pears with apples. Used ruby port in the absence of tawny. Doubled the sauce and reduced it longer than recommended in the recipe to make richer and thicker. Served it with roast squash and parsnip and an apple-radish-and-avocado salad.

Rating: 4
Very tasty recipe. Pork turned out tender and juicy, and the combination with the sweet pears and tangy mustard was great. Didnt have pork loin, so used chops cut into medalion sized pieces. Pears took a while to soften, will cut smaller next time, also decrease amount. the sauce is great, so i will increase the amount next time, and maybe add a bit of cream. Easy, delicious, and will impress.

My husband loved this dish & so did I. It was simple and quick & very tasty.

Rating: 3
Really a great dish. I marinated the tenderloin in port, garlic and shallots for an hour before proceeding. Also, I dusted the pear quarters with sugar so they carmelized a bit in the butter. I'd only suggest doing something to make the pork a little more tender, if that's at all possible for a sautee. I wonder if the long simmering time affected the tenderness at all. I had to cook down the sauce for longer than 8 minutes. In the future, I'd suggest using less broth and only a half cup of port or maybe reducing it a bit before mixing it in with the mustards.

My husband and I loved this dish. The mxing of flavors was wonderful. We will make this again to serve to (and impress) company.

Found 2 large Bartlett pears in the fridge. Substituted 2 boneless pork cutlets cut into 3rds. Followed the recipe to a point. The butter after browing the pear sections was perfect to brown the floured pork pieces. Instead of removing the pork, I returned the pears, adding the mustard stock along with about 1/3rd cup of heavy cream. I substituted Maderia for the port. Returned the heat to a fast simmer while a pot of rice steamed. I only used the smooth Dijon. The mustard, Maderia complimented the pears perfectly. Next time I would dust the meat very lightl with flour--I found a 1/3 cup of flour excessive and wasteful. For a special meal, I would slice the pork cutlets very thin ala scalloppine. After browing the pears, very quickly sear the scallopine and bed on a plate, finish the pears in the same skillet and finish with vin santo or other sweet Italian desert wine in the stock in lieu of port and serve with a risotto flavoured with chopped mustard greens

I agree with the suggestion to use a ruby port - it does make it better in my opinion. This recipe is wonderful and I've made it several times since.

I used the pears from my pear tree for this dish, over all, the flavor is nice, but since I'm not crazy about sweet dishes, so I don't care much about this one. If I'd make this again, I probably will just use white wine and Balsamic vinegar instead of Port, port is quite sweet.

Nice sauce - make sure to thicken it well (use an extra flour you have left over from the pork). If you are unable to use ripened pears, add a bit (1 tsp at most) of sugar to the mix and make sure to cook them well enough. We garnished the pork with minced morels sauteed in butter, which made the dish extra special.

Yummy flavors! I've made it twice this month. Love the combination completely. Followed the directions exactly. I've always done pork with apples but the pears are a very nice change. It can be made ahead, refrigerate it and then reheat in a warm oven until hot.

Flavor are delicious! It's true, the sauce is not as flavorful as you might want - although we did not have the coarse grain dijon. Consider adding a bit of cayenne or a splash of balsamic vinegar. Sauce is plenty thick for us, but if you don't flour the medallions don't be surprised if your sauce is thin!

I too used apples instead of pears, and this worked VERT well. I could have used 2 apples instead of 3, but the apples were a nice addition in any case. I used a combination of whole grain dijon, and dijon horseradish mustard, which worked well. I think a regular dijon woulod have made this too bland. My whole family, including 2 kids, liked this a lot.

I like the combination of meat and fruit, but was slightly disappointed that this one didn't have a little more robust flavor. If I make it again, I will probably either add more dijon mustard or some garlic or perhaps even a few cloves to give it a little more punch.

This recipe looked very good and I read all the reviews with interest. The pears took a lot longer to cook even though I sliced them thinly. I did not cook them long enough to let them get "light brown" because they were starting to fall apart. I left the flour off and sauteed the pork medallions -- I had to add some olive oil. I thought the sauce would have a stronger flavor and I was disappointed that it didn't (I used an aged - 10 yrs - tawny port). However, guests & husband loved it. Next time, I'll add a dash of nutmeg to the pears as they are cooking and see if that makes a difference. Any other suggestions on how to kick the flavor up a notch? Perhaps a pat of butter to mount?

This one is a keeper. Based on another reviewer's comment, I skipped the flour and I didn't miss it. My husband wouldn't let me use the good port, so I used dry sherry and a splash of Lillet. I also skimmed the sauce after deglazing so it would be smooth. It turned out great - next time I'll sneak in the port.

Sorry, I was just checking this recipe because I'm making it again, and I wanted to make another comment... I agree with Jeff. Its a little confusing whether to treat the sauce ingredients like a braising liquid or like a pan sauce. The recipe suggests dumping everything in at the same time and letting the tenderloin remain in the liquid while it reduces. I decided to make a pan sauce out of it instead and reduced my chicken stock ahead of time. I deglazed with the port and cooked to evaporate the alcohol, then added the mustard and reduced chicken stock and basically finished the sauce before adding back the pears and the pork. I added the pork only to glaze them in the sauce, not to cook them more. This way you have more control over the sauce as well. It is agressive, but I like it agressive. Also, I didn't flour the medallions before searing them because I didn't want burned flour in my sauce and it thickens on its own anyway because of the gelatin in the chicken stock.

Rating: 3
Based on suggestions, I used only two pears, and wished I'd stuck to the recipe. The sauce was great, but a more pronounced pear note would have been unbelievable. I'll do four small Bartletts next time. Use the best Port you can afford--it makes a difference. I'll also use different pork, as braising a tenderloin, which is already a very tender cut, isn't a good treatment. The aggressive sauce tends to overpower the delicate flavor of the tenderloin. I think chops would be a better fit here. Save the tenderloin for grilling or dry roasting.

GREAT recipe - you can have a little elegance mid-week. This is even doing it without flour - found out too late I was just plain out(food police, please don't rant and rave!!) The flavor was still wonderful. I did use a pretty good but not expensive port, which I imagine helps considerably. The sauce IS the best part. I cut down on the pears as suggested, but won't do again, they were too delicious. I will make again for company, with the flour - back off food police, ok!! and report back dutifully.

I loved this recipe! The pears! The mustard!! The pork!! And as another reviewer noted, the left overs were devine!! The pears I used were very ripe, juicy, and soft. For this reason, I wish I had skipped the saute in butter and saved the fat and calories. One time, I used white wine instead of port, then cheated a little by adding a bit of cream and fresh dill at the end. Tarragon would also be a yummy change if using white wine instead of the port. This is a great dinner for family or for company. Very delicious, yet deceptively easy. You can dress it up or leave it plain. Make ahead or serve immediately. Definitely will make it again in one variation or another. We always have lots of great pears at Christmas. This is great way to eat them. Like another cook, I cut the amount of pork in half, used one pear, and all of the sauce. It was plenty for three people, served with mashed potatos and green veg.

I liked this recipe a lot. Good flavor... very easy/fast to make... and open to adaptations (re: number/types of pears, varieties of dijon mustards, etc.) I used a good-quality port but otherwise made a few substitutions where my corner-store produce mart selection forced me to do so.... The "repeat" dinner later in the week seemed even better, probably because the cooked meat and fruit had had a chance to marinate in the leftover sauce in the fridge for a couple of days.
