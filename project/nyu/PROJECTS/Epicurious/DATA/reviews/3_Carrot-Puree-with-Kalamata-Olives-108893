I took the idea from A Cook from Somerville and added curry powder, and it was delicious! I paired it with tandoori chicken and was very pleased. I'd think of the printed recipe as printed as a starting point; you could flavor it any way you'd like. And, always a plus in my book, this recipe is easily adapted for cooking for just one.

I agree with the cook from Frisco that a half pound of carrots is enough for two. Also agree that this recipe needs something to "zip" it up a bit. Next time, i'm going to add something, maybe thyme.

Great, unique side dish and what a way to cook carrots!! I used 1/2# carrots, 2 cloves garlic, 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, 1/4 cup kalamata olives, and chicken broth as needed to have a smooth puree - perfect for 2 people. It may be on the bland side if you don't add more of the garlic and olive flavors. i served this along side Grilled Salmon with North African Flavors, an Eating Well, Spring 2004 recipe. Definitely company worthy.

This recipe was OK as written, although in my opinion the carrots were a little bland. A little curry powder made it better. All in all, though, it was worth the effort of making it, which was almost none, and I would probably make it again.
