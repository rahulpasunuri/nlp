Excellent gluten free muffins. I didn't have tapioca flour so I used a little extra corn starch. I also used raspberries instead of blueberries. They came out moist but hardy with just the right amount of sweetness (not too much). I will definitely make them again.

We thought the recipe was pretty tasty. We made a second batch and added about a 1/4 cup more sugar and a wee bit more maple. YUMMY!

This recipe is a hands-down winner with my good friend's mother, a sufferer from celiac disease. In the winter, these muffins go well with a hearty soup. I made such a meal last night. This time I divided the finished batter into three batches, adding 1/2 cup whole kernel sweet corn to one batch, 1/2 cup blueberries to the second, and 1-1/2 tablespoons lemon curd to the third. The result was a fun assortment of muffins for the table. Tip: Sprinkle maple sugar on the lemon muffins before baking to tell them apart.

I'm new to the gluten-free scene and really missing bread--this is the first one I've tried. I substituted Red Mill's Homemade Wonderful Bread Mix for the tapioca flour (which it contains along with other flours), agave nectar in place of sugar, honey in place of syrup, and brown rice flour in place of the white--otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It turned out to be outstanding--very moist and delicious. thanks! jwalter

I've been on a gluten free diet for about 2 years, and I have to say these were a delight! Based on the other reviews I cut the salt since I was using salted butter, and I used potato flour in place of the tapioca flour. They were light and not crumbly, sweet but not too sweet. I'll definitely be making these again. Yum!

This is a good recipe. Next time I will add some lemon zest. I sustituted soy milk for the milk and earth balance for the melted butter. Tasted delicious right out of the oven with a little butter and honey.

Yum! This recipe produces sweet cornbread muffins, although the rice flour keeps them light. It's perfect for those looking for a gluten-free option, and will make you feel healthy despite popping several in your mouth. I made these dairy-free also by substituting 6 T. canola oil for the melted butter and 1/3 c. soy milk plus 2 T. tofu-based sour cream for the milk. I didn't have any tapioca flour, so I used an extra 1 T. of cornstarch. I'm not a maple syrup fan, so I also used 2/3 c. sugar instead. I like my muffins with lots of berries, so I added an extra 1/2 c. of those, plus 1/2 t. lemon zest and 1/2 t. cinnamon to jazz up the flavoring. I used a sprinkle of coarse sugar for topping. Will definitely make again!

I have been experimenting with gluten free muffin recipes lately...for a friend who was recently diagnosed with a gluten intolerance.... These muffins were good: flavor, texture. I agree with some other reviewers that they are a little salty, but perhaps that is because I used salted butter - that is all I had on hand. I omitted the tapioca flour because I did not have it, and they still turned out tasty. I also used MORE than 1 cup of fresh blueberries.

Followed the recipe exactly, but I used a blend of berries and some dried currants. It turned out a lot like a berry-filled cornbread. A little on the dry side, but add some butter and/or honey and it's a lovely GF recipe. It was a tiny bit sweet for me. If you want it to be more like a cornbread muffin, you could probably use less maple syrup, or try using something less sweet, like apple sauce or date sugar.

I find this the most moist and flavourful gluten free muffin I've found. I add the zest and juice from one lemon to make them more flavourful. I've also used this recipe as a base for carrot muffins as well - and it works amazing.

I would have given this a one forker. However, I did have to use Ener-g egg replacer for the eggs, and I used almond milk instead of whole milk (which would greatly change texture). The muffins came out really crumbly and I think I can taste some of the baking powder or corn starch in there. This is one of the first smattering of gluten free recipes I've tried. It uses a lot of corn starch, maybe others use as much, but that's the most I've ever put into one recipe.

Before I knew I had to stop eating wheat I made several blueberry corn muffin recipes. This recipe was every bit as good as any I've tried. Mine were not dry at all or dense. I followed the recipe exactly, I'm not sure why others had problems. I will definitely make them again. I think next time I will add some lemon zest to the batter.

I just made this recipe for a friend who has a wheat allergy. They are beautiful-looking and quite tasty. They're not fluffy like blueberry muffins but are more like a nice, sweet cornbread. I used both blueberries and raspberries, which added a nice, tart flavor. I also used a little more sugar than the recipe called for.

Those who don't do gluten free should not use this recipe. I'm guessing that's what was/is the problem for the cooks from New York and Santa Ana. Their reviews are typical of someone who does not HAVE to eat this kind of food.

These muffins tasted very strongly of baking soda/baking powder. They became very dry the following day. What a pity!

Sorry but no taste (even smeared with more butter) and texture was rubbery. Couldn't help but be disappointed -- a pint of blueberries, nice butter and eggs -- into the trash.

One of the best gluten free recipes I have tried. Very nice texture and flavor.
