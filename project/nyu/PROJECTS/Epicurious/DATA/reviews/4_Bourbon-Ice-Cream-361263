Having made ice cream only a handful of times, I'm always worried about the texture of a recipe and how hard the ice cream will be..or not! This is an amazing recipe. It tastes like the locallt made gourmet ice cream I buy at my dairy. It is very rich, smooth and creamy, and the taste and scent of bourbon are a perfect touch. While firm, it's still easy to scoop and makes the perfect side to a bourbon pecan tart! I will definitely use this recipe again and plan to try it with different liquors and liquers.

This is a perfect ice cream. The bourbon keeps it so smooth and creamy. I have also substituted cognac and it's wonderful too. This is my Christmas dessert with chocolate cake. YUM!

Actually haven't tried it yet, and was curious about the texture. As one reviewer noted the ice cream did not freeze or set up as creamy as perhaps we'd like? I've had this happen with other ice cream recipes that called for the addition of this much alcohol/hard liquor. Thinking maybe the booze inhibits the freezing?

the PERFECT accompaniment to apple fritters recipe!

The taste of the ice cream was fantastic. However, I had trouble getting the ice cream to freeze properly. Even after 30 minutes in the ice cream maker, it was still slushly. I froze it overnight and though that helped, the consistency is not right. The only way you can serve it without it melting instantly is in a cold-chilled bowl. I'll try letting the custard thicken a little bit more next time.

I combined this recipe with one for mint ice cream to make a mint julep ice cream to serve at my annual Kentucky Derby party. I added about a cup of mint leaves after the cream began to steam, removed from heat and let it sit for half an hour. then reheated it to steaming heat, strained out the mint leaves, and followed the rest of the recipe. the mint and bourbon flavors were subtle. my tasters thought i could double the mint and bourbon to get a stronger mint julep flavor. will try that for my next practice run. don't know if the double cooking was the cause, but i got dangerously close to making scrambled eggs instead of custard. it all worked out perfectly once the cream was churned in the ice cream maker. this was my first ice cream making endeavor, and it turned out fabulous.

Agreed with ladies, it is extremely tasty, and wonderful with apple desserts. Mine also was too soft the first time. When I made it a second time, I let the custard get pretty thick and it came out a little better. I wonder what the purpose is in the recipe of the Dry Milk Powder? Anyone know?

This ice cream was really delicious. I served it with Tart Taten. It did, however, not freeze very hard. I'm going to make it again this weekend and this time add the bourbon after the custard has been churned.
