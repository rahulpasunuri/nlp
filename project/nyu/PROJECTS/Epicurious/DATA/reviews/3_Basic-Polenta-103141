Definitely use home made chicken or vegetable broth! It was my fist time making polenta-the first night it was pretty watery, the second night it clung together; both ways were great. It's a nice food item to build from. Good for breakfast, lunch brunch, dinner...

These are the proportions we use for basic polenta, when we're not jazzing it up. We use low sodium chicken broth and a pinch of salt instead of water and the amount of salt called for. I have found no reason to bring the water to a boil before adding the cornmeal -- just whisk it in when it is room temperature and then bring it to a boil. Turn down the heat and cook on low heat, and it does not have to be stirred constantly to be smooth and creamy.

Do you know the difference between polenta and grits? About $5 a serving... ;)

This is a great recipe for basic polenta, although it requires constant stirring to make it smooth and creamy. I am pairing mine with a braised lamb shank and will add parmesan at the last minute. I've found that substituting 1 cup milk for ever 1 cup of water makes it creamier, but you still need to stir constantly. Definite comfort food.

This is good old fashion comfort food. I serve with sauteed sausages, onions, garlic, peppers and mushrooms. My 3 boys love it!

Polenta is always bland on its own, so after it was done cooking I stirred in some chopped pieces of bacon that I had just fried with fresh romemary. That helped a lot.

Of coures it's bland! But only in the samed way mashed potatoes are bland. Polenta is meant to be eaten with a sauce, a dark red marinara with lots of shredded parmesan. I have added garlic while cooking and that is good too. Stir in some shredded cheese while it's hot. Mold leftovers into a loaf pan, slice and fry in olive oil and top with your favorite sauce.

the recipe is bland, it need additional ingrediants to spice it up, try adding salsa, minced garlic or a veggie.

Needs added instuctions: After polenta starts to thicken, use a wooden spoon to stir.
