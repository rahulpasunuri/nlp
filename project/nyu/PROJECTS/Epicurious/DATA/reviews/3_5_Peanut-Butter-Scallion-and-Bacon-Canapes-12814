Surprisingly delicious. They wanted more.

I think my mom probably started making these back in 1991, this was a classic new years eve dish in our household. I will admit the recipe is a little "dated" but it really is delicious!

I have made these for years. Every time I serve them, they are gone in no time. Our guests like the sweet/salty combination. I mix the bacon and 2 T. of mayo in with the peanutbutter. I garnish each canapy with cilantro. Sometimes I add a t. of chopped chipotle peppers to add some heat and a bit of smoky flavor.

I tested this recipe in advance of a party. I thought it was edible but pretty strange. It mostly tasted like peanut butter with some bacon. I used high quality reduced salt bacon from a fancy food store maybe the ordinary kind would have made it better. I am glad I tested this. There are better thing on this site.

I have made this often and always to raves, when people find out how simple it is they always ask for the recipe. These are always the first canape's to disappear from the tray. At times I've had to substitute 'canadian' bacon and it works well also, I just dice it and saute it in olive or canola oil until crisp. This is fast and easy, forgiving and it's always appreciated.

I made this recipe. It reminded me of something Jack Benny might serve w/ his traditional creamed chipped beef on toast(SOS). If you made this often enough, one could develop a reputation as a person of poor taste AND a cheapskate.

This was easy to make and a big hit at our cocktail party. I omitted the mayo and used white sandwich bread - people were surprised at the combination of flavors but ate them all up.
