Oh, and I skipped the ginger and don't think it was missed...

These cookies were good and very easy. (Whoever said they were tedious - I want your cookie recipes because I didn't think they could get any easier than this!) I didn't have enough chocolate chips to add them whole to the batter/dough. I did add chopped macadamia nuts and did use the white chocolate. Super easy and pretty good. People comment they're more like brownies but to that I say, yeah, what's your point??? :)

At the family cookie bake-off, these are always the first to go! I eliminate the white chocolate because I don't like it.

Delish. These cookies are very rich and delicious. Any time I make these they disappear quickly and get lots of raves. Any time I am looking for a memorable treat this recipe comes to mind. If you like chocolate and ginger these are for you .... non-chocolate fans need to go elsewhere!

I made these as a gift for a cookie exchange. These cookies are very good, but a bit tedious to make, by having to melt the chocolate and press the white chocolate on top. They have a good chocolate flavor, and ginger adds extra chewiness, but they're not my new favorite.

Made these for an event I catered, they were gone so fast and so many compliments! People loved the "familiar" taste in these, found out it was ginger and they just raved! I will definately make these again.

We loved them too. They were very good. I agree they were brownie-like, but they were delicious. The ginger really added that special "kick" to them. I made them smaller than the recipe calls for and they ended up being 100 calories each. :)

Love them. They are a bit like brownies, but in my book that's a good thing. Love the ginger, love the chewy insides and the white chocolate chunks. Yum, yum, yum.

Made these to bring into work and everyone loved them. Several declared them to be "the best chocolate cookies ever" and wanted the recipe.

I' m surprised at the negative reviews. My rather large family liked them a great deal. To the reader who said the white chocolate turned brown, try cooking them a little less or verify the temperature of your oven. Mine turned out a lovely white. To the reader who expected chocolate to be measured in ounces, the white chocolate was. The chocolate chips were measured in cups which is the most common way to measure this form of chocolate. The ginger was just the right amount (no problem measuring as I used the pre-chopped crystalized ginger available at Trader Joe's) and we enjoyed these cookies very much.

I don't know if this is a cookie or brownie recipe. The measurements were confusing. Most chocolate recipes indicate the amount of chocolate in ounces - not cups! A 2.7 ounce jar of crystalized ginger equals a little less than 1/2 cup. I agree with the other readers that the expense of the chocolate isn't worth the taste of these cookies, i.e. brownies. Perhaps your test kitchen could clarify the measurements they used so we could benefit from their "expertise".

Looked enticing, easy to make. Very rich cookies and nothing that really made them stand out as a new recipe to keep - even the ginger didn't work and I had my best chocoholics try them!

This is a very unique cookie with a very light ginger taste which adds dimension to a regular double chocolate chip cookie! Great consistency, and very popular!

Omit the ginger, add 1/2 Cup regular flour,and these cookies will be delicious!

The amount of sugar in this recipe seems ridiculous. It's almost nothing BUT sugar. Using melted chocolate chips for the batter and then adding more chips before baking gave them a rather simple flavor and the ginger didn't add much complexity. The white chocolate on top added nothing, in terms of flavor, nor did they look like the picture as they browned while baking. There are too many good chocolate cookie recipes out there to bother making these again.

This recipe was too interesting not to try...I love crystallized ginger and was anxious to try this. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I thought the ginger just gave it an odd (not good) flavor. I had a bunch of teenagers and my husband "taste test" these cookies and none really cared for them.
