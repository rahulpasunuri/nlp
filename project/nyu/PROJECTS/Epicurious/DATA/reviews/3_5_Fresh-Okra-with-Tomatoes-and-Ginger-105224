I've made this recipe twice within the last 5 days! It's a great, simple recipe and the flavors of the garlic, tomato and ginger compliment each other quite well. I love what it does for okra! The sauce is also great on white fish.

Great flavors, wonderful as a summer side or a light dinner when served with rice.

We will definitely make this again. I did not have fresh ginger and used a little too much red pepper. Next time I will cut back on the red pepper so it is not so hot. My husband says he doesn't even like okra but liked this recipe quite a bit. A keeper.

I thought this was an Excellent recipe for fresh okra without the mucus issue. I did find (in having made this several times) that if you use fresh tomatoes, or a can, drain the tomatoes as much as possible--even during cooking. I found an extra 5 min worth of reducing/cooking the tomato mixture was well worth it. The effect was like mild sun dried tomato with the okra. I thought it needed more ginger...but that is just cuz I love it. This is a staple in my house during okra season!

This recipe works well using a 14oz can of diced tomatoes and a one pound pkg of frozen okra. Don't use too much ginger!!

This was pretty good. I added some fresh corn off the cob to soak up some of the tomato juice. I would add a little more ginger next time and more salt. My okra stayed nice and firm - no gummy issues. I was reluctant to not trim it as the recipe indicated, but was pleased with the results. I do prefer other okra recipes, however this was good for something different.

This is a good, simple recipe and my okra didn't turn out gummy. However, I thought the combination of ginger and tomato- while wonderful, summery and light- was actually TOO delicate for okra. Next time I will prepare the okra in a heavier sauce or curry. Okra can handle a more complex sauce.

Not terrible, but not great... okra turned out gummy, I must be doing something wrong, since I love okra, but it's always gummy!! The ginger and tomatoes were a nice combination ... overall, just ok. If anyone has any suggestions as to how to avoid the gumminess in general (without frying!), please advise!!!!

Most people just want to steam and butter their okra - but I get bored with that so I tried this recipes - I thought it was quite innovative and delicious - even the "stick in the mud" family member from the south loved it! Give it a try!

We made this recipe along with some herb and cheese scrambled eggs and corn on the cob. It was a good unique side dish.

Quick, easy, and versatile. I didn't have too much tomato in the fridge so I added some diced red bell pepper, onion, and carrot. I also substited cayenne pepper for red pepper flakes. Although the dish doesn't look like much on paper (just cooked veggies, really), there's something about the okra that ties it together and gives the whole thing a pleasing thicker consistency.

Great side dish--easy to make, lots of flavor. And the okra doesn't get gummy!
