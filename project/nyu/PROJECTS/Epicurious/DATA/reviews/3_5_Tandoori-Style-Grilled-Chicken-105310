This was meant for a different Tandoori Chicken. I am so sorry, please disregard my review below.

This was absolutely dreadful. I tried it twice because I was convinced I made a mistake the first time. The chutney is foul. I had to throw it out. The chicken was below average. I can't say it was horrible, but my husband and I agreed it was not the least bit yummy. I feel like I wasted a lot of spices and time. Time to throw the recipe out.

Disappointing. I marinated a whole cut up chicken for close to 30 hours. The marinade smelled and tasted delicious but the chicken wound up with very little flavor. It wasn't bad, but I'll keep looking for a tandoori style recipe that actually delivers.

Very easy, very good. Does the recipe mean bone-in pieces? Couldn't find skinless bone-in pieces, so used skinless, boneless. Result was juicy and delicious..even the leftovers!

The first time I made this it fell flat, and it dawned on me that my spices were old. When I tried it again using freshly ground spices, the difference was astounding. The flavors really burst through I like to order them online from Penzy's, or Smith and Truslow if you prefer organic. To balance the spiciness, I serve it with a mint yogurt sauce.

I thought this recipe was amazing, with a few modifications: I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs that I cut up and marinaded for about 30 hours. I then skewered them with vidalia onions and grilled 'em over LOW heat. It takes a long time, but low heat really renders the fat out of the thighs and leaves them juicy and delicious. The chicken came out perfectly, but the leftover sauce (heated up, of course) was too spicy to eat on the rice, and I like spicy. Perhaps my new jar of cayenne is extra spicy...

I loved this recipe. I added a little cinnamon, elimnated the onion, cut the chicken in chunks and baked it. VERY fast and easy to make and everyone raved.

Very good especially grilled over mesquite.

The recipe sounds delicious but I thought the flavor was weak. There are better recipes out there.

Neither my husband nor I cared for this. While the chicken turned out moist, we thought the saffron overpowered the other spices, and we like saffron. I might give it another shot with less saffron, but will more likely try other recipes first.

I love this recipe! While not true tandoori, it awesome none the less. For a cookout I love to use this for wings and drumsticks, marinating it all in about 4x the amount suggested here. Additionally, I usually use about 6-8x the amount of saffron suggested, generally Spanish saffron. Then, at the end, I take diced red onion and chopped cilantro and sprinkle it over the chicken, along with squeezing a few lemons over it all too. Absolutely delicious!

Wonderful chicken - very moist and flavorful. Perfect spices - made it for a family get together with rice pilaf and everyone loved it!

Very tasty! I made it for a party and we all enjoyed it. I highly recommend marinating the chicken overnight. Definitely keep in the chili seeds because this is not at all hot even with them in. Bake it in a smoker bag or a clay roaster in oven. The Indian Baked Rice recommended by another reviewer is an excellent side dish and has more of a kick than the chicken. Add golden raisins to it. Lime Cilantro Yogurt sauce recipe also on this site is nice accompaniment with extra cilantro and a pinch of salt. I served all this with a condiment tray on a lazy susan with: fresh sliced ginger, chilled pinapple chunks, Chiled mango slices, hot Bombay mango chutney, mild mango chutney, apple pear chutney, shredded coconut, crystalized ginger, cilantro leaves. Serve wtih Garlic Naan. Mango Ice Tea with fresh mint leaves and mango slices in the glass. I'll make again! Enjoy!

Excellent. Definitely tandoori "style" instead of true tandoori but that doesn't matter. Followed the recipe as is and marinated overnight. Fantastic with tabouli and the the grilled artichoke w/ lemon & mint recipe on this site.

I didn't like this dish at all. I didn't think it was very flavorful. It didn't turn out the way I thought Tandoori chicken should look like. I won't be making this again.

This was fabulouos: both my husband and my kids really enjoyed it. I practically doubled the spices...given what other readers had written. I also added a jalapeno pepper for some extra zing because we like things spicy. I also heated up the leftover marinade, brought to a quick boil and pouired over the chicken and rice. Try Indian Baked Rice as a great accompniment

This was a wonderful dish, very easy. I marinated the chicken for 2 days (not intentionally), which was definitely worth it. And I used a nonfat yogurt, which did not hurt the recipe (or the thighs)at all.

Really flavorful - especially if you let the chicken marinate overnight. Here's a hot tip: Don't want to deal with the mess and time with the grill? Purchase a "smoker bag" at a good quality grocery store. The bags can be found up by the briquets. You can smoke the chicken in the oven, no muss, no fuss, and the chicken will fall off the bone. Yum. I serve this chicken dish with an orzo Greek-style salad (several recipes on this site), flat bread, and tzatziki. A nice honey cake with walnuts and orange glaze rounds out the meal.

I love tandoori chicken and I have made it prior to this recipe. However. this is not a recipe I will use again. It lacked something...maybe cilantro?

Rating: 3
A great tasting dish, however I would increase the spices used in the marinade for a more pronounced tandoori taste. Perhaps my spices are old?? Anyways, YUM.

Rating: 4
I used one whole chicken. Probably could have cut the marinade by half. Anyway, I cooked the dark meat on the lower rack of my BBQ, the white meat on the upper rack. I live in the Bay Area where there are many fine Indian restaurants. But this was the best Tandoori chicken I've ever had. Very moist, amazing flavors.

This was a great recipe. I halved the recipe because it was just for me and my boyfriend. Used skinless/boneless chicken breasts because thats what I had around. I also omitted the saffron because I didn't have any in the pantry. Look forward to trying it with the shrimp like another reviewer.

I guess I'm the only one, but this had WAY too much ginger for my taste, and I like ginger. If I ever attempt to make this again, I would proably use1/2 to 1 tsp tops. It tasted more like a Thai dish, than Indian. My husband and I were very disappointed. I would love to find a "real" tandoori recipe if anyone has one. Still looking...

The marinade was wonderful - I used chicken thighs and pricked them all over before immersing them. The taste was pretty subtle, though, and to keep from burning the chicken, we lost out on the deep roasted flavor I get when I bake Tandoori at 500 degrees first for 10 minutes and then reduce the heat. If barbeque is the plan, this is different and tasty, but I if I make it again, I will put them into the oven. We served it with cucumber raitas, homemade rhubarb chutney, chopped mangoes and brown rice and there was nothing left!

I was a little doubtful about this recipe. After all my husband is Pakistani, and I wanted an authentic dish. But I have to say that I was impressed. The chicken was tender and flavorful. I served it with the BASMATI RICE WITH RAISINS, NUTS AND PEAS (minus the peas). This should definitely be served with raita, as a previous reviewer suggested. Good luck!

Rating: 4
I prepared this tandoori marinade for both chicken and shrimp. It got RAVE REVIEWS from my dinner guests. It makes for easy entertaining, as everything is done and marinating the night before. A definate change to the 'typical' Texas barbeque! I served with basmati rice and tossed salad.

This had incredible flavor! I even forgot the turmeric and it still turned out good. I'm sure the flavor and the color would even have been better if I had done it right! I served this with parmesan couscous and the meal was great!

Very delicious! True, it is messy on the grill. True, you must use a food processor. I used skinless, boneless breast meat and put the onions and meat on a skewer. Lots of tang from the lemon, garlic from the garlic, spiciness from the spices and the yogurt gave it a nice texture.

Indian cooking is divine, what else is there to say? The recipe was very very good. I would make one suggestion for all those Indian food lovers (like myself), I would serve this with a side of cucumber raita and forget the red onions and cilantro.

WOW! SMASHING! I USED CHICKEN BREAST ON BONE, BECAUSE I DONT LIKE DARK MEAT. I USED LEMON CONCENTRATE ALSO. THIS MEAT WAS SO TENDER THAT IT FLAKED OFF THE BONE LIKE FISH. DEFINATLEY A KEEPER!

Rating: 2
I really hate to issue a review when I didn't follow the recipe EXACTLY. I used lemon juice from concentrate (I had lemons, but was lazy) and the flavor was a little vinagery for my taste. AND, I just mixed the marinade by hand instead of in the processor AND I didn't grill because its cold outside (I put it under the broiler). I was not impressed by this and was a little disappointed, but I will try again, the right way.

This was wonderful - made just as directed. I used skinless drumsticks, thighs and breasts as the store was out of hindquarters. It's pretty messy on the grill, but once it is done, there is such a pretty color. And the scent of saffron, yum! I loved the red onion and cilantro as well. Really compliments the chicken.

Really really nice flavor. I made this with boneless, skinless chicken breasts (personal preferance) and it came out great.

Delicious! I made the recipe using skinless, boneless chicken thighs, and the meat came out fantastic. Definetely a keeper, the only thing was a bit hot for my 5 year old, so maybe next time I will half the spices.

Very, very easy to make, and really tasty. I used a prepared Madras curry powder. The ultimate compliment came from my beyond picky toddler -- she ate it and wanted more. Will I make it again? You better believe it!

By far the best tandoori I've ever had or made! It always comes out well (as long as you marinate the chicken for the time specified in the recipe).

This was great and very easy. It tasted delicious and made my kitchen smell wonderful. I combined it with sun-dried tomato, spinach and basil couscous and steamed broccoli for a full and well-balanced meal. I halved the recipe and still ate from it for a whole week!

Oh so yummy! Spent the afternoon by the pool on the most gorgeous spring day ever with this one. Loved by all! 24 hour marinate time is a must, I used chicken thighs with no bone and the marinade mix would be enough here for twice as many thighs as I used (about 8) they came out so moist and tender. A definite keeper of a recipe!

Rating: 4
Yum yum yummity! This looked and tasted great. They're not kidding about the marinating time - 24 hours sounds about right. I cheated and only let it sit for six hours or so, and the flavor was a bit mild for my spicey tastes. I ended up serving it with pico de gallo which fired it up nicely. Gathering all the spices seemed like a chore, so I substitued curry powder which worked out fine.

This was tasty, but in need of a more spicy flavor. This wasn't a bit hot-- and I took care to double the cayenne. It looked nice on the platter, scattered with the onion slices and cilantro, and the chicken came out looking pretty much like the picture. My husband grilled this on our charcoal barbecue, over indrect heat, for about 35 minutes, and it stayed juicy. (I used both skinless legs and thighs, and skinless, bone-in breasts to please everyone).

We found this to very quite tasty! I didn't get to put the cilantro on after cooking (a terrible thunderstorm kept me from going out to the garden) and I had to use non-fat yogurt because whole milk was not available. It also only marinated for about 12 hours. It was wonderful anyway and I'm looking forward to making it correctly next time!

There was no whole milk plain yogurt to be found at the market, so I used reduced fat sour cream. Tasty dish but it did burn around the edges on the grill.
