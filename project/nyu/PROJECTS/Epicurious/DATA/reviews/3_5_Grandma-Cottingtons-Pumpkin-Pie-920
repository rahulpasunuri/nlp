I needed to make an excellent pumpkin pie for those of our family who love it. I am not a fan of it in general, but I really liked this one, and went back for seconds. I added one extra egg yolk, increased the molasses by 1 tsp and dried spices by 1/4 tsp each. Served it with freshly made whipped cream, and ginger snaps. Tried several other recipes, but liked this one best for a tasty, traditional pumpkin pie.

I Love this recipe, and I hate pumpkin pie, so for pumpkin pie this is the best. I alway's make it but use fresh pumpkin.

This pie is fantastic, I don't usually like pumkin pie, but I like this one, It doesn't taste like the usual canned pumkin pie receipe or store bought, I have used fresh pumkin instead of can and it is fabulous.

To the cook from Ann Arbor, try the Ultimate Pumpkin Pie recipe on this site (sans apricot preserves.) Always a requested pie at all winter gatherings since it was printed!

Ooh, so yummy. The molasses adds a richness that's missing in a lot of pumpkin pie recipes. I brought one to work and it was a big hit. I will note this- I used fresh pumkin, and after I boiled and mashed it, it seemed runnier than it should have been. I used only 1 cup of whipping cream and 1 cup of milk. The pies turned out fine.

This is one of the best pumpkin pie recipes I have ever tasted! Just the right amount of spices, and that crust, reminds me of a delicious shortbread! It will be here for Thanksgiving again this year. Hint: Cover the exposed crust with foil if getting too brown.

I found that the molasses in this recipie really ruined the pie. I made this last year for the first Thanksgiving dinner that I had my family over for, and no one touched it! People found it too bitter. Still looking for a great pumpkin pie recipie!

Delicious!! Just the right amount of sweetness and the crust is beyond compare.

This dish was a hit at Thanksgiving. The crust was particularly good, although I think I probably overcooked it just a bit. Next time I'll watch the crust a little more carefully, especially because it began to bubble up when cooking before adding the filling. In my opinion the crust was better than the pie!

Maybe someone can help me out - I baked the pie exactly as described - once, with pie weights for 15 minutes, then for 15 minutes without weights (both with foil) and then again for an hour when the filling was baking. The pie crust was burnt on the edges and overall overdone underneath. Any thoughts? My friends said the filling was good, anyway, so I'll try it again and be careful - it just seems that after the second 15 minute baking the crust was already burning, which I was surprised to see after reading the rave reviews.

I was disappointed with the consistency, which was mousse-like as opposed to custard-like. I did not follow the directions for the crust, but baked the filling in the pie as described in other recipies, so I can't vouch for the crust.

Excellent pie and crust. With the extra crust, I cut out two oak leaves and when the pie was cooled, the finishing touch just made that more equisite.

I've made this every year since it was printed and everyone who's tasted it says it's the best!

This review is not for the pie - it is for the crust! This is the best pie crust I have ever made. I used sugar in the raw and it packed a little extra punch in the flavor though it sure didn't need any help. This is perfect pie crust - buttery, flaky, firm, never soggy, and totally delicious!!!

Add this pie crust recipe to your recipe box! It is amazingly flaky, light, and has a slightly sweet, pleasantly buttery taste. Just make sure not to overmix the dough, especially when blending the fat with the flour.

I've made this pie every Thanksgiving since it published and I still love it. It's easy, flavorful and very traditional.
