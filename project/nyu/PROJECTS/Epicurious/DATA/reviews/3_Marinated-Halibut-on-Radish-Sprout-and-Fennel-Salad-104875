This is a lovely dish. It is an inventive and impressive alternative to gefilte fish at Passover, and just makes a beautiful dish for any time. The flavors and presentation are sophisticated. This dish comes off as a starter in a fine European restaurant. I made for dinner, rather than a starter, so I halved the recipe and made it for 2.

This was a very unusual combination, but we liked it very much. We are not Jewish and this was my first experience with Jewish recipes, and it really was pleasant. My fish monger didn't have any halibut but it worked very well with grouper. I served it with matzo-ball soup with shiitake gribenes (from foodtv.com) Excellent combination!! Though a bit of work. I used watercress instead of radish sprouts, I thought it was prettier and had a little more substance. My husband asked for more. We'll definitely do it again.
