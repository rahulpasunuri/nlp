This is a holiday staple at our house. I serve it at Christmas Eve every year and every year my family requests it! It is delicious and easy to make. You definitely have to push down the sides, even if they're crusty, so as to avoid the sinking some other reviewers experienced. Happy baking!!!

Made this cake for Christmas dinner at the in-laws and it was a huge hit! Very chocolaty! The recipe worked perfect as is, even at high altitude.

Amazing cake, really chocolatey and great with the chocolate ganache icing on this site instead of whipping cream on top. I baked it in a bowl and the middle always fell so I used a springform cake and lined it with foil. Works out perfectly. I decorated the ganache with strawberries and gourmet cookies (like Pirouline but in 2 two), looked amazing and tasted even better.

I made this cake for the first time years ago and lost the recipe. I was pleased to find it during a search not long ago. I have made it twice during the holiday season to rave reviews. If this cake is runny, I would suggest checking your oven thermostat. If you follow the recipe and use a metal mixing bowl to bake it in, and remember to press the cake when cooled, you can't miss. I use a pastry bag with a small star tip to decorate this cake - its beautiful. ENJOY!!

I truly love chocolate, but I did not like this recipe at all. Taking the suggestion of several reviewers, I did serve this warm, about an hour or so after talking it out of the oven and it was like soup on the inside and was cloyingly sweet. If you want something with an intense cholcolate flavor, I think the bittersweet chocolate cake recipe on this site is a better choice.

This is like a refrigerated version of molten chocolate cake. It's OK cold, but absolutely incredible served warm. Add a scoop of Haagen Dazs Hazelnut Gelato and it's heaven on earth. Next time, I'll bake it in individual ramekins. It's hard to share the dense gooey chocolate inside!

I made it for Christmas and my family really liked it, but could only eat it in small pieces because of its richness. I ate my piece with a glass of port wine, and that was perfect!! Also, I whipped up extra cream to serve on the side to help cut the richness of the cake. I'll probably make it for New Year's, too.

My family and friends loved this cake! It got crusty enough in the oven that it didn't sink when it came out, keeping its perfect snowball shape. But then it fell apart a bit as it was cut. Didn't matter. The contrast of crusty exterior and soft interior is fantastic! I made it for Groundhog Day by making holes through the whipped cream into the cake with a chopstick, and inserting little cookies cut into groundhog shapes.

My family liked this cake very much. I found it absolutely easy to make and shared this recipe with a friend. She found it delicious as well. We all love chocolate, so we appreciate its strong flavor and thick texture

I made this recipe for a Christmas Open House and everyone who sampled it - loved it. Wonderful rich flavor - so small slices are appreciated. I had trouble pushing the sides down after baking - it was already crusty on the surface. When it came out of the bowl, the shape was nice and round and looked like a very pretty snowball with the whipped cream frosting. The problem I had was cutting the first piece - the smowball shape sunk and the cake flattened out. It did not look as pretty - but the flavor of the cake was so good - it didn't matter.

I made this for a New Year's Eve dessert, and it was a big hit. It's not for the faint of heart, though--it's incredibly rich and dense. Make sure you press the sides down enough--otherwise the snowball will appear hollow. I speak from experience, here.

I made this for Christmas and everyone liked it. It's very rich, so cut small pieces. I added a little bourbon to the whipped cream for the topping, and sprinkled the frosted cake with sweetened coconut.

We had this cake after Christmas dinner - it was visually impressive and went over very well. I come from a long line chocoholics - so it was not too sweet or intense for us. We loved it - had small pieces since it was so rich.

I made this twice to give it a true college try,and found it TOO sweet both times, even though I cut the sugar by one third on the second try. This improved the snowball a bit. I call this the chocolate bomb! La Costa, CA

This was over the top from my family's perspective. We had it as dessert after Christmas dinner and all thought it was too sweet and too rich (even though we had cut the sugar!). If you want the most chocolate possible and love things that are super sweet maybe you'll like it better than we did.

This is just wonderful...a chocoholic's delight! It's so dense and fudgy, it goes great with some good ol' strong Starbucks coffee! Also, I can't get over what a breeze it was to make this cake. I made it for an office holiday potluck, and everyone loved it, especially the way it looked...just like a snowball! Substitutions: I had no rum so I used rum extract. Also used store-bought icing to save time. I decorated it with blue crystal spinkles using a snowflake cookie cutter, and it looked nice and festive. I would love to try this again using mint chocolate chips if I can find them, and make some homemade ice cream to go with it. Definitely a winner.

This recipe is delicious and a hit at our Christmas party. I broke up a candy cane and sprinkled on top, and it looked like candyland. Everyone at the party asked for the recipe. It would be a hit with adults and children. Make this one if you love chocolate! When you live in Fargo, you have to love a "Snowball".
