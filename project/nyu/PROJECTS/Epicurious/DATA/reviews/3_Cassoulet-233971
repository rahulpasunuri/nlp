We love duck cassoulet and this recipe offers the right ingredients, but the directions are awful!! Seriously... If you soak the beans +8 hours, test before you boil. If you are a rookie cook - buy canned canned beans and save yourself the hassle. We will make this again and use the recipe proportions and skip the instructions.

I have had cassoulet before; this recipe is not really a casserole, which is what cassoulet traditionally is; I realize there are about as many recipes for this as there are cooks who prepare it, but this is the ONLY recipe I've seen that calls for cloves. If you're looking for a traditional french recipe, keep looking...

It is a Sachet d'epice with cheese cloth. A Bouquet Garni is a bundle of herbs tied with string, no cheese cloth. The recipe looks good, except I would use chicken stock, or better yet, roast the duck bones after making the confit and make a duck stock. You get no flavor from water.

I made the recipe, but it did not taste like the cassoulet that I had while visiting France. There was something missing from it; it seemed to need more flavor. Will try heating it up and adding a bit more spice.

Took all day to make. Tasty, but next time, I'd use canned beans rather than dried ones. Even though I followed instructions exactly, the beans were more chewy than I would have preferred.

My husband loved this dish! I happened to have duck confit in the freezer and it definitely makes the dish! I ordered my confit on-line from Grimaud Farms. I also used turkey sausage to cut down on the fat a bit.

This is exactly how I was hoping it would taste! I made it a day earlier, and my only mistake was not to add plenty of broth during the reheat. It needs much more than you think because the beans absorb so much liquid. It was still a huge hit. I served it with crusty French bread. My mouth waters as I think of it now!

To the cook from Davis - I get my confit from Nugget and it is usually in the freezer section. If you cannot locate, ask the butcher.

A good confit of duck is the best part of this recipe. It is not hard to make your own and well worth the effort. It needs to be made several days before. A recipe for confit should have been a part of this publication.

I like it with white northern or navy beans. After the pork is cooked, cube it and bone the duck. Divide meat and sausage into individual cassaroles, add beans stir and refrigerate. Remove from refregerator, add stock if necessary. heat in 350 degree F oven for 20 min and top with the crumbs and then continue heating till crumbs are lightly browned 15 to 20 min Alternative, heat till hot through 30-40 min and top with crumbs then place 3 to 4 inches below broiler to brown (warning - this goes fast and can easily burn)

I truly enjoy cassoulet, and this seems the best recipe I have tried. However, any suggestions on finding confit duck legs--I usually just get some pre-cooked duck breast

Since my boyfriend is a chef, he suggested that I use boudon blanc sausage, veal with skin on -I found that a super slow bake reduced the possibility of sausages that burst, and they picked up the flavors of the duck and pork, a delicious and very rich meal. I made this about 3 years ago -great leftovers...
