I gave this only two forks, but I take blame for it not having a third. I think I messed up by not reducing enough before adding butter, so my sauce was a watery bland mess. Also, I didn't cut my meat on the the bias, or against the grain, or whatever the heck the term is, so mine was a bit chewy. Done-ness was perfect, though. I am cubing the leftover meat and searching for a quesadilla recipe. Hope my errors help the next user!

Delicious!! Made this for the entree of a five course Oscar night dinner. Instead of putting the meat in the oven I put a lid on the skillet toward the end of the browning process so that I could regulate the degree of doneness by touch. They turned out perfect. My sauce was delicious. Not so over the top that it took away from the meat. Instead of the fries I did horseradish mashed potatoes. They went perfectly.

OK, I'll admit it. My steaks were not 2 inches thick. Do yourselves a favor -- measure the thickness. No? You don't want to? OK. Then yours'll be as grey as mine turned out (half batch). The other half batch that were thickr were slightly more pink.

This recipe was awesome and I followed it except for when making the sauce, I substituted the water for beef stock, and not only did it thicken up nicely, it had much more flavor.

Amazing, as altered per suggestions by other reviewers: I followed the recipe closely for the preparation of the beef, but made a few adjustments. After browning and roasting the steaks, I melted the butter and sauteed onion and crimini mushrooms over med heat in the used skillet. Then I doused the onions and shrooms with red wine (about a glass), fresh thyme, S&P, a pinch of cayenne, and avoided the water at all costs. I served the beef with red potatoes par boiled and then baked 15-20 min or so with fresh thyme, dijonaise and s&p, roasted broccoli and fresh baby greens salad with spinach, tomato and arugula. I highly recommend this simple, tasty preparation.

Good recipe. The sauce is the weak point though. It was to bland. Think we'll try making it without the water, and just add a bit more wine. Dijon was a good touch. Also, if you can, opt for homemade fries, such a nice steak, seems a waist to use frozen potatoes.

I made this using a peppercorn bacon wrapped fillet mignon, cooked according to the recipe. The sauce didn't look like it turned out wright but the taste was amazing. Defiantly try this recipe out.

Great recipe. I used a peppercorn bacon wrapped fillet mignon and cooked it according to the recipe. Fantastic, will defiantly be saving and cooking again! PS: make sure you check time on cooking fries and adjust up a few min to make crispy, mine took almost 30 min, and i thought they would be done way before the steak but they were the last thing done.
