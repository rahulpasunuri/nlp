Heads up.... I left my chestnuts in a bit longer than 8 mins and 2 of them exploded! I read more on the internet and it appears that one is supposed to cut small "X's" in the skins, or pierce them, to prevent them from blowing up. Not sure if stopping at 8 mins as this recipe suggests would have prevented that.

You won't believe how good these are. I served them with fruit, cheese and port after dinner.

This is a fabulous recipe. So flavorful!

Great for cocktail hour - they all disappeared. Agree that they do not need much oil at all when heating at the end.

These are sooooo good. The kitchen smells delicious and I can't stop picking on them! Use fresh thyme and cut back the olive oil in the beginning, as I found the toasted nuts were oily already. I was generous with the sea salt, too. A perfect snack to nibble on with cocktails!

I was skeptical of this dish even though every single review raves about it. But it.is.good. The more skins you can get off the better, and I always have a heck of a time with it. But these directions were perfect - after 30 minutes the skins popped right off. I also splurged for pricey organic hazelnuts, so maybe that had something to do with it? Excellent recipe, got raves, super easy. I'm sold.

Incredibly delicious - you will not be able to stop eating these and it will make your kitchen smell heavenly. Go heavy on the sea salt immediately after they come out of the pan.

I love these hazelnuts. Simple, elegant and delicious. Try to get the freshest nuts possible and store them in the freezer as hazelnuts go rancid quite quickly.

Quick and easy. I gently rubbed the nuts with a paper towel and didn't worry that most of them had skins. They were wonderful! I agree that I will use half the oil next time though...

Folks, please don't make the mistake I did. Use pre-shelled nuts. The recipe didn't specify and I learned it the hard way.

I served this as a snack while I finished making Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a hit. The only modification I'd make next time is to use less oil--the nuts are oily enough on their own, and they get greasy.

I've made a couple of batches of this. It's great! I put it in salads and other dishes as a garnish. It's a pain and messy to get the skins off. I lucked out and found them skinned at Whole Foods in the bulk section. Yeahh!!

Nice, nice, nice. This is a great autumn snack, and super easy. I'll definitely make this one again. Makes a great nibbly for cocktails.
