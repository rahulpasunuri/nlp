This recipe is being shown as a Passover dish and it's not. Flour-based pasta is a no-no. Be careful to vet these dishes.

I used parsley straight from my garden, so the pesto may have had more flavor than what other attempts had. I didn't follow the artichoke procedure - why waste the leaves? I put the artichokes in a pressure cooker to steam and they were delicious, but ended up being a side more than a part of the dish.

Not quite sure why this recipe is showing up as a passover dish, Ham? Pasta?

Pretty easy and quite good, though it could use a little more flavor. I used roasted walnuts instead of pine nuts and after reading some of the previous reviews I added some bell peppers to the artichokes and cayenne pepper to the pesto. Used canned artichokes instead of fresh, and that worked fine.

I had a box of frozen artichoke hearts, penne pasta and a bunch of organic flat leaf parsley. I found this recipe. After reading the reviews I decided to jazz my recipe up a bit too since there were a lot of people weighing in saying that it was bland. I used the rind of a lemon in my pesto. I also had to use tooasted walnuts instead of pine nuts. The recipe came out quite good. everyone liked it, especially the kids. Husband liked it too but wasn't head over heels for it. Still its a good recipe if you have the ingredients on hand. I don't know though that I would go out of my way to make it again for the family. Not sure why, since I feel that way, but I do think this would be a good company dish.

I did not alter the recipe except to use very rich EVOO. Very bland ond boring. I only gave it 2 forks because it has potential. I will try this again but I'll add red pepper flakes and canned artichokes as well as some capers to bring the flavor up to where I will like it.

I really liked this recipe. I altered it slightly by using canned quartered artichoke hearts, rinsed a few times and tossed in with the pasta for about 2min. I also added a few tsp of lemon juice to the pesto to give it an extra kick. Next time I think I'll throw in some fresh basil as well.

I agree that the artichokes are way too much work for this recipe. The parsley pesto just doesn't do it for me...seemed kind of flavorless, and certainly didn't enhance the flavor of the artichokes. I was excited about the prospect of this recipe, and am definitely not going to bother again!

As modified (see below), I thought this was an excellent dish; and even my kids (ages 10, 8 & 6) cleaned their plates. Some of the other reviewers felt it was bland, so I made some additions. First, I sautéed sliced celery, carrots, a yellow bell pepper, half of a small Spanish onion and 6 extra cloves of garlic sliced into thin medallions (I doubled the recipe so this wasn't a huge addition in terms of volume). However, I stopped cooking the veges when they were still a bit crunchy (at least the celery and carrots). I used parmesan reggiano, fresh Italian flat leaf and a little curly parsley (from the garden) for the pesto. Don't skip toasting the pine nuts as it adds great flavor and only takes a few minutes. I also added a couple of shots of Frank's red hot sauce and 3 tablespoons of capers (my kids like capers in just about anything). If you use canned artichoke hearts (which I'd recommend), don't use marinated ones as they'll ruin the flavor of the dish. I always have good luck with Progresso canned artichoke hearts in brine. Anyway, I think the slight crunch of the sautéed vegetables along with the extra garlic and hot sauce made the dish. Yum!

Although very simple and quick, the flavors were not sensational as I thought would be from the rave reviews. The pasta was really dry, so I added more water as called for in the recipe, and the pasta became very pastey. I will not be making this again.

This is a tasty dish that is nice for springtime, when basil isn't in season. I like a higher vegetable to pasta ratio, so I think next time I'd reduce the pasta and do one or two more artichokes.

Very tasty bur definitely used the canned artichokes; for me it just wasn't worth the hassle! (Sorry to all you really authentic cooks out there!) It was fast, the parsley pesto was excellent and something I had not tried before. I used farfalle instead and it was great. Definitely a keeper.

This was tasty, but I am glad I added sauted mushrooms and orange peppers. It was a bit bland otherwise. I also used canned artichokes.

Yummy! I used almonds instead of pine nuts and gnocchi (pasta only, no filling) for the pasta. Lots of green -- roasted red peppers sounds like a great topping. This recipe is an excellent way to use up fresh parsley bunches -- which you bought for just a few tbsp-worth.

This is one of my all time favorite dishes. The parsley pesto is really light tasting and really brings out the flavor of the fresh artichokes. Although preparing the artichokes was a bit of a pain, it was well worth it. This dish is even better the next day!

Definitely use jarred artichokes. This would be a very fast recipe, if not for the artichoke preparation. The taste was very good.

I found this recipe to be both bland and boring. It was alot of work for nothing great in return. If there is a next time, I will definitely use canned artichokes, since doing it yourself is time consuming...I was shocked when I saw the rave reviews, maybe I did something wrong, however I followed the recipe exactly how it read.

My husband couldn't say enough good things about this dish! I'm glad I doubled it, because he took the leftovers to work the next day. The strong garlic flavor was fantastic.

What a light, refreshing dish! The parsley pesto is wonderful since it doesn't take over the dish. I have also made this with asparagus instead of artichokes, and had excellent results and feedback. In another variation I include some chopped roasted red peppers, which adds color to the asparagus and pesto combo.

This was a great and easy recipe to make for a casual Sunday night dinner. The parsely pesto brings out the wonderful taste of the artichokes. I will defenitely add this to my repertoire.
