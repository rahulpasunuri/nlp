These are great! My suggestion is to freeze them for at least an hour or 2, then sit at room temp for about 10 min before frying...perfect! Haven't tried it, but I wonder if you can do ahead, leave in the freezer, well wrapped, and always have some ready for a quick appetizer? Be sure to serve with spaghetti sauce for dipping!

OMGoodness! I have made this over and over! I use the Italian bread crumbs to make it a more flavorful app but regardless what you use - nothing beats fresh mozz balls! You'd never want to have cheese sticks anywhere else!

I was wondering if instead of frying, to cut down on calories/fat, could you bake in oven? Or will in melt into a gooey puddle...?

love this recipe - and it does need to be fresh mozzarella and refrigerated before frying. As for the nutritional info - helllllllo - it is Fried Cheese..enough said....

They were too wet. I patted them on paper towel before coating. The coating was great but they still seemed to have a pocket of water in them. I think I would just use regular mozzarella instead of going through the expense and bother...my family wasn't impressed!

Four forks because it's so easy to make and a crowd favorite. Great suggestions to refrigerate & then briefly freeze first - I had no problems during cooking. Also, I just used the Trader Joe's marinated mozzarella balls, and they were great.

I walked in and made these after a stressful day. Great choice. Delicious and easy to make. I used homemade bread crumbs: http://tinyurl.com/yzlgcje

easy to make and my superbowl fans ate them as fast as I could cook them. They were a big hit at my house

These are a big hit with us. Tip: refrigerate these for an hour or so before frying, and put them into the freezer for about 5 minutes before frying. They turn out beautifully crisp on the outside, hot and melty in the middle, and the coating stays put.

made these yesterday for Superbowl- they were excellent. I wondered about the double-dip, which can be messy...so I did 1st batch that way and the rest 1 dip-no difference. I did, however, refridgerate the dipped balls for 1 hr before frying, I think it helps to keep the breading on. Served with marinara and pesto for dipping. They were gone in 10 minutes, kids loved them too.

What is the nutritional information for this recipe? thanks

I tried this recipe and they turned out great. One thing I did different was adding some Italian seasoning and placed them in the freezer for a few hours to hold together then fried immediately, carefully placing them in a few at a time.

I followed the directions exactly, and let the breading rest while the oil heated, but about 1/3 of the balls leaked through the coating. The ones that worked were yummy, but there was too high a failure rate for me to do it agion.

I have been making these for years - we call them Baci Balls. A delicious way to keep the cheese in the breading is to wrap a slice of prosciutto around the bocconcini. Try them this way and you'll rate them 5 forks!

I was really looking forward to these. They looked pretty in the picture, but mine oozed cheese into the frying oil and were a grand mess.

i have found that any time you need to do a breaded coating, it will do better if you let it set for about 20 minutes in the fridge, or 10 minutes in the freezer, before you fry it. that helps ensure that the coating stays on the cheese and doesn't separate off, leaving you a bunch of cheesy mess in your oil. also, i always add some parmesean into the breadcrumbs that i use to coat the cheese, it makes it taste better.

Wow! So good and easy!

A hit! Super easy and quick; my only problem was the oil was too hot for my first batch so it burned the balls. Although they were still consumed by my hungry guests, the second round was much tastier when the oil was at the correct temp.

I agree with the one reviewer that this might not be great with mass produced cheese. I used local cheese and it melted perfectly. The only mistake I made was not using superfine breadcrumbs. I only had Panko and they didn't form a solid crust so I had some cheesy leaks in the oil. Still, it was easy and very delicious. To the person who said they "tasted oily" my guess is that your oil temp was too low. Ours tasted light and crispy.

AWFUL, NEVER AGAIN....I am pretty good executing recipes like this and everything about this was a mess...the double coating, the frying and the final result. Cheese oozed out of the topping, making a gooey mess of the oil and the pot. Tasted oily. Spent more time cleaning up than anything else....so beware

OMG! These were amazing. As a vegetarian I plan on using them to make spaghetti and 'meatballs' at some point in time. Addictive!

This recipe brings to mind a Cook's Illustrated tip I learned about using fresh mozarella in recipes where the cheese will be warmed. True handpulled homemade mozarella will melt beautifully. Mass produced mozarella that is pulled by machines is fine when cold, but when heated it tends to become rubbery in texture as it melts, and will bring to mind chewing gum as you eat it. For a recipe like this where the oozy warm melted cheese will be a key feature, I would recommend hunting down and splurging on real homemade moz.
