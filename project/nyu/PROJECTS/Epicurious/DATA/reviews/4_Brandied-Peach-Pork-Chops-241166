This was really disappointing. The sauce was good, but the pork was bland. We did opt to grill the chops because of the heat. I really don't think cooking them in a fry pan would have saved the recipe. Perhaps if I had added balsamic vinegar and cayenne as others suggested, it would have been better. I have other pork recipes that I really like, so I won't both with this again.

Made this for company. Everyone enjoyed it. I was intimidated about lighting the brandy on fire but it was ok since i had a pot lid ready in case I needed it.

Quick and easy. A lovely unique sauce and not as sweet as I expected. Made it exactly as set out in recipe. Would make it again.

Great for a weekday meal. Yum.

This was delicious! I did three things differently. I grilled boneless pork chops, and I substituted Peach Schnapps for the brandy (because I didn't have any brandy). Also, there is not a peach to be found this time of year in New England, so I also substituted drained canned peaches. After I made the dish, I actually found one lonely bag of frozen peaches at the store, so next time, if I still can't get fresh peaches, I'll at least use the frozen peaches. This will easily be a favorite in my household!

I won't rate; only made peaches, and used fresh peaches, bourbon & apricot preserves. Yum.

I had the chops and fresh peaches so I varied the recipe a bit and it was still very good. Opted to BBQ the chops, no shallots so used scallions and garlic, no brandy so used Grand Marnier, no peach preserves so used Apricot jam. Would be good with apples. Served with rice and salad for a great meal!

Excellent sauce! We grilled the pork chops and made the sauce with fresh peaches, and fresh rosemary in place of the thyme. I took the suggestions of other users and added a splash of balsamic vinegar and a pinch of cayenne at the end. Really, really flavorful!

Such a disappointment. My husband and I both thought this was ok, but not worth making again.

I used bourbon instead of brandy, and peaches that I had picked and frozen this summer. Totally awesome. I think my husband loves me more now than before.

The sauce was superb. Exciting and different. Usually, I buy happy-pig pork from an organic farmer at our sensational local farmer's market. The taste is so fantastic. I used factory store-bought pork chops and they were awful. If you have a local purveyor, please support them. Happy pig meat is much better.

This was a great recipe. I used fresh white peaches and they were great, though they could have used a little kick to offset the sweet of the preserves. I might use less butter next time and I finished it with a splash of balsamic which gave it some nice depth.

I made this with fresh peaches, it was super. We will make it again and again. Everyone loved this version of pork chops.

This was excellent. I also could not find peach preserves in the store, so I used apricot. Instead of frozen peaches I used two, large fresh white peaches, peeled and sliced, which really made the dish. It was ready in a few minutes and tasted like something really special.

This is fairly easy to make and very tasty! Just make sure you have a lid ready for your pot when you light the brandy. Mine shot way up to the ceiling.

Delicious! I only had canned peaches and pear preserves and I thought they worked great. I will definitely make it again. and again.

This was great and easy. I made the sauce in advance, and cooked the chops on the grill. Everyone liked it. Personally, I thought it needed a little something at the end, and added a few sprinkles of chipotle powder. It gave it a nice little kick while complimenting the other flavors.

A friend made this during winter with frozen peaches and it was excellent. This summer I made it with fresh peaches, which deepened the flavor. I used kirsch, as I had it on hand. It didn't flame up too much, but definitely enough to impress my man!

Really great recipe and super easy to make. I didn't actually light it on fire because it made me nervous and it still turned out really good.

Followed recipe pretty faitfully, but found it overall to be unremarkable. Could be my frozen peaches weren't great, but I thought the recipe needed more depth. Will probably try it again when fresh peaches are available. Oh, one more thing - remove the pan from the stove if/when you flame the brandy and have a lid ready to smother flames if necessary. BIG flare up! I won't flame the brandy again - I don't think it added anything but fire hazard.

Loved this one - a bit sweet but it could easily be toned down with a little less preserves or the use of sugar free. I couldn't find frozen peaches and substituted frozen mangos - worked beautifully. Didn't use the butter and used less olive oil and it came out tasting great! Will definitely make this again.

This was terrific. I made almost exactly as written but I realized at the last moment that I didn't have the peach preserves- subbed with 1/4 cup of orange marmalade. make extra sauce if you can as it is really good.

Maybe "Tampacook" had a cold or something. The flavour was HUGE. So delicious but I did use Apricot Preserves since I couldn't find Peach. YUMMY!

I couldn't believe how much flavor could come out of such a simple recipe. Used Whole Foods 365 brand peaches and they were great.

This recipe was a big hit. As I was cooking, my husband commented that he does not like fruit with his meat. After we finished eating he asked me to make this dish for his parents.

Made the recipe as written and loved it. Nice change to plain pork chops. This summer I plan to try the recipe with grilled pork chops.

Made some modifications and enjoyed this dish very much. Quick seared chops in just a little butter/oil, then added a bit of chicken stock, covered and put in oven for about 15 minutes. Substituted frozen cherries and cherry preserves. Quick, easy and lots of flavor. Will make again.

We used the recipe "as is", except increased sauce by 50% -- delicious! Without thinking much about it, we let the sauce simmer gently during the salad course -- this toned down some of the sweetness and made it more mellow and satisfying.

Delicious and simple. Modifications-- lightly dregged pork in flour, used only 1 T oil, 1 T light butter and extra peaches. I also added a few dashes of Signature Secrets Culinary Thickener for a slightly thicker glaze. Enjoy!

Fabulous! This is quick and easy with a wonderful flavor. Less than 30 minutes total.

Sorry, but this sauce just missed the mark. I tried 2 different types of frozen peaches and they were terrible. You just can't make something exceptional from a poor product. The 'Dole' frozen peaches I used rated a C- but had no choice as I had dinner guests that evening. I will have to do a "make-up" meal for this mediocre meal.

I am always looking for new ways to serve pork chops and this is definitely a winner. It was very easy to make. I would even try it with a different type of fruit.

I am always looking for ways to make pork chops more exciting - this is definitely it. Wonderful flavors, next time I will even double the sauce (not the peaches) because I wanted more for the baby red potatoes that I cooked with it.

I loved this. My chops were on the thin side, so it took a lot less time to pan-fry. Very easy week-night meal with delicious results.

My wife loved this dish, but I thought it was so-so. I'll probably make this again, but I think I will try some of the suggestions about roasting the pork instead for more tenderness. Even if the pork wasn't my favorite, the flavor of the sauce was excellent.

excellent. Adapted this to an old recipe I had: Rub pork chops with s&p and a mixture of ancho chile powder, cumin, and cayenne pepper (or you could just use a quality pre-made taco seasoning).

Mmmm, I now love pork chops! And the husband isn't a huge fan of peaches, but he ate it and nearly licked the plate clean! It's going into the weeknight rotation. Easy dinner to make with few ingredients!

This is a keeper. I used Pork tenderloin instead, seared it in the pan and finished in the oven, then made sauce while meat rested. This will become a regular at our house!

This was great. A big hit! And super easy. I roasted a pork sirloin roast nearly to doneness, in advance. And made the sauce, also in advance. When it was time to eat, I just sliced and pan fried the pork roast to doneness -- it took just a couple of minutes and was beautifully tender -- and heated the sauce to pour over. Wonderful!

My daughter, the one who hates change, turned her nose up when I announced that we were having pork chops with a peach sauce. She loved the dish and finished it all. Very simple, very nice Charlie R
