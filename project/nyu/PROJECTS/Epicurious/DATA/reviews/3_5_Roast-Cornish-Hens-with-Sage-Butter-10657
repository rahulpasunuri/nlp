I've made this a couple of times now and it has been a huge hit in my house! The skin gets crispy and tasty. I always end up having to double the amount of butter to get it all around inside the skin and also outside. Adding a bit of lemon juice to the pan is a good addition! I also cover the roasting pan with a lid for the first 2/3 of the cooking time. The first time I made them it ended up taking an hour before I figured out I should cover the pan.

Delicious. The hens take a bit longer to cook through per the thermometer than the recipe indicates. I stuffed the cavity with fresh sage, a slice of the lemon after zesting, and a bit of apple. I also added crushed garlic to the butter in the skillet while browning. Liberally baste with the pan juices. Moist interior, crispy exterior, and lovely aromas.

Instead of the Sage Butter, I used some whiskey butter that I had made for steak the other day (whiskey/burbon/shallots/garlic/dijon/s&p) It tasted great! Lemon wedge in the hole made for a good contrast

We made this for tksgiving and the guys loved it. Took advice of the reviewers for lemon inside with fresh sage and abit more zest in the butter. Will use this recipe many times.

I needed something simple to do for a small thanksgiving dinner, and this fit the bill perfectly. The hens were fantastic, tho I think I need to practice separating the skin from the meat to rub on the butter. Upped the lemon zest a little, and took the advice of a previous cook and put a wedge of lemon in each bird. I look forward to making this again.

Easy, quick, and looks impressive on the table. Made for a wonderfully romantic dinner. I made this for the first time this weekend and paired it with steamed asparagus and baked potato as sides. I used fresh sage and doubled the lemon zest. I also stuffed each hen with a slice of lemon, which infused the meat with a lovely fresh flavor, but was not overpowering. I did brown them in the skillet. I was surprised at how effortless this step was, and it made for a nice presentation. I'll definitely make this again.

I loved the sage & butter rubdown for the bird, but didn't like the cornish hen much. I think next time, I'll use a whole fryer instead. That way, I'll get more than one plate of food. I must agree with the other reviewers, the lemon zest adds a bit of zippiness to the dish. This would go over well with either chicken (as previously stated) or with turkey for thxsgiving.

Very tasty! A keeper recipe. I really liked browning the bottoms on the stove top before roasting. We used our cast iron skillet.

Lovely, with a subtle flavor. Like the previous reviewer, I didn't brown the hens - they went straight into the oven and turned out beautifully. I also doubled the amount of lemon zest for extra tang.

This was easy, delicious, and pretty. I didn't brown them, just roasted them, turning twice.

I've made this recipe several times now. Adding a little more lemon zest really kicks it up a notch. To save time I haven't browned the hens prior to the oven and the birds come out nice and "tan" from roasting in the oven.

Really a GREAT recipe. Simple, but very nice tastes. I added some Crimini Mushrooms to the pan before throwing in the oven and it really added a nice earthy tone to complement the sage flavor.

This was very easy and tasty. We all loved it. I couldn't resist altering it somewhat; I added a little chicken broth and white wine before putting it in the oven. Very juicy and flavorful.
