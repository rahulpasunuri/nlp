This recipe is a complete joke. Not only are the instructions thready at best, but the eggplant won't actually cook if you follow these directions. There are about a dozen other spices and vegetables that need to be added to make this a real entree, especially if you plan on putting it in a pita gyro-style. Undercooked eggplant is NOT why Turkish cooks have long loved eggplant with lamb. Skeletal recipes like this are NOT why anyone orders Bon Appetit. Two to five more steps and a few more ingredients will make this something you're glad to come home to, but following directions will not. When I see that Bon Appetit was recommending this kind of crap as recently as 2007, it makes me want to seriously rethink why I have the magazine sent to my house.

HI, for those of you experiencing Bitter Eggplant...DON"T TOUCH EGGPLANT with metal!! it makes it bitter. (actually learned that from fantastic cooks in Turkey!) Use wooden implements and coated pans...not sure, but I thought that was why you leave the skin on the eggplant to cook...so it protects the veg..that could be me being imaginative! :)

This recipe has potential... After reading the reviews, I made sure the char the eggplant for a long time and I used small eggplants, so I didn't have problems with bitterness. However, I feel like the eggplant/yogurt puree was missing some flavor... I'm thinking maybe roasted rather than raw garlic next time. I cooked the lamb for about an hour and added some tomato paste as well, it was delicious and tender. Anyway, with the warm pita it turned out ok.

I love both lamb and eggplant but this dish was severely lacking in flavour. Even with the addition of more garlic and chili, it was ho-hum at best. A waste of good lamb.

My eggplant exploded on the grill!

I'm still tasting this unique dish. Garlic, lamb and eggplant yogurt combo. It was all good and I think it would have been better if it was made the day before.

I made this with the zucchini patties with feta and homemade naan flat-bread - what a treat! Great use of the tons of homegrown zucchini and eggplant on hand at this time of the year.

This sounded really good, but then the whole time I was making it I started having doubts. So I was doubly amazed how delicious it was, especially the lamb -- for such a simple preparation. To the cooks having trouble with bitter eggplant -- I think that comes from not letting it drain long enough.

Very good. I think I used lamb rib instead of lamb shoulder. I forgot to put in the yogurt--which is crucial to balance out the oil from the lamb. I also tried it with a bit of tomato paste, which lended it a sweet-sour taste--yum!

I really love Turkish food and this recipe was so easy to prepare and the results were great. I too ended up with a bitter eggplant puree, but that was my fault and the eggplants, not the recipe itself, aside from the bitterness, the puree was silky and very tasty, I'll use a hothouse, or japanese variety next time. The lamb was incredibly easy to prepare with almost no attention and it came out tender and tasty. I used Turkish Aleppo pepper (more traditional) and it had just the right level of spice. To find Aleppo pepper, go to penzeys.com, they have every spice you can imagine!

I served this at a dinner party and the guests loved it. I followed the recipe except I took the lid off the lamb for the last 15 minutes to let the liquid boil off. I used the long and skinny eggplant and they were not bitter. I'll definitely make this again. It was outstanding but did require a lot of prep work to cut the lamb from the bones and char the eggplant. Well worth the effort, though.

Liked this recipe, but had problems with it. My eggplant was too bitter for words - next time I'll be more careful & buy organic (and maybe Japanese) eggplants. I ended up grating a fair amount of Manchego (hard Spanish goat cheese) into the puree, and that helped it a lot. Also, my Greek yoghurt was non-fat, and I think it would have been much richer with regular plain Greek yoghurt. I simmered my lamb (shoulder) for a couple of hours before it was tender - used a small tomato cut up & a little bit of water & kept an eye on it. The end result was pleasing, although I think my husband wasn't thrilled with the eggplant.
