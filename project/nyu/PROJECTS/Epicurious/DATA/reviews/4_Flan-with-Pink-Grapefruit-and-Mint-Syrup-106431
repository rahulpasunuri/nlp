This was delicious and incredibly easy! It unmolded perfectly. So light and refreshing. The syrup is good over anything! I had it at every opportunity, especially over other fruit like berries.

Fabulous flan recipe! Made a southwestern-themed dinner for 6 friends and this was a huge hit. I thought it would be very difficult to make it come out right, but they were perfect, and the recipe is actually very easy. The sauce is delicious, and was also yummy on ice cream!
