I cut the 4 inch from larger tortilla - beware, they want to separate into layers when the outer "seam" is lost. I fried the tortilla day before and lightly salted, they kept fine in ziploc after cooling completely. Put the filling together a few hours ahead. I cut the thin strips of peppers in half, more bite-size. Used a whole jalapeno (still not very spicy). The crab flavor was lost, but most likely because the quality of the canned crab I used because there is no fresh seafood in my area store. At first I thought everything would topple off after first bite, but the jack cheese actually held it all together. I'm not sure I'd make these again. They were good, and they were pretty with the mix of colors, but they weren't special and for all the chopping, frying, sauteing, assembly and broiling...well maybe just a bit too much for something that's just good.

great recipe-was a big hit...I did use more jalapeno since we like a kick. QUESTION: do you use regular pumpkin seeds in their shells? or are there pumpkin seeds available out of the shell?

This was a BIG hit. For a big group, I doubled the recipe, omitted the crab, used 6 bell peppers - 2 red, 2 yellow, 2 orange. Put the pepper/cheese mixture in a baking dish. Topped the whole thing the avocados & pepper jack. Broiled and served the Tostito scoops on the side.

I'm mixed on this recipe. I love crab legs but find everytime I make a recipe with crab as an ingredient, it borders on fishy. I buy good crab not the 6 ounce cans. I think shrimp would be safer for that reason. As for the other ingredients, I will chop rather than slice next time. It is too awkward to serve in strips. I like the concept and flavor for the most part. I made the tortillas cut into triangles and baked in the oven. I use a whole minced jalapeno and a lttle extra cilantro. I think it would also work better to have the avocado mixed into the crab mixture. I did not think the Cotija was too strong as was another comment. A lot of work!

I did these as small hor d'oevres - I used Scoops chips, and chopped all ingredients small, then just used a disher to put a small amount into each chip. Topped with avocado & cheese and broiled. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. They were a big hit at our party! A perfect little bite-sized tostada. Great mix of flavors, easy to put together, and they even look great - all the different colors of the peppers and avocado - very pretty. Will definitely do these again!

Definately a keeper! Beautiful and delicious. Next time I am going to double the cilantro and jalapeno because I think it could a bit more oomph, but otherwise wouldn't change a thing.

As I needed a recipe for dinner, I made this recipe as a filling for enchiladas. I used Trader Joe's deluxe crab and queso fresco instead of the cotija or feta cheese, but otherwise, all the same. Half the recipe was plenty to fill 8 corn tortillas. I can see how it would be a great appetizer as well. Delicious.

This is an awesome appetizer. You can find small corn tortillas at any Mexican Market to save having to cut larger ones. You can use store bought tortilla chips, rounds, scoops but nothing compares to fresh chips anytime! I would change nothing about this recipe, it's always a hit!

Definitely a keeper! I use mainly chicken and feta and when seasonal cut the tortillas out in the shape of trees, bunnies etc. Makes a wonderful presentation and they disappear immediately.

Too much work, expensive and not very good. Cojita cheese was too overpowering. Not a keeper

I substituted shrimp for the crab and its been fabulous. If you can't locate shells use tortilla chips or scoops instead. Absolutely unbelievable as an omelet filler.

Fantastic, great, delicious and showy for guests--and they loved it. I did not use the pumkin seeds, but added some jalapeno seeds to spice-up vegetable mixture. I made it all ahead of time, but did not add the vegetables to the crab until right before assembling. A definate keeper.

My guests loved this appetizer. I thought I would have trouble finding a pablano chili here on the west coast of Canada, but I lucked out. I was a little nervous about using 2 chilies as I didn't know how hot it would be, so I used one. Next time I will be using 2, they were not very hot. I will definetly make this again.

These were so good! I also used shrimp instead of the crab. And, lightly "pan fried" the corn tortillas in olive oil in the skillet until crispy. Loved the blend of textures and flavors. These look beautiful too! So colorful! Will remember for guests.

As crab was not in season, substituted shrimp with rave reviews from the dinner guests. These were easy to prepare and a very tasty addition to my dinner party. I didn't fry the tortillas myself, but used pre-made mini tostadas I got from the supermarket.

This dish was absolutely fantastic!! I have been involved with a gourmet dinner club for the past 3 years. When I served this at our "mexican" dinner this past month, everyone agreed that this was one of the best recipes we've ever tried.... I made some adjustments to suit my own tastes (used a bit more tomato and cheese and less pepper) and used flour tortillas (as I could not find corn). I used a high quality guacamole instead of avocado because I couldn't find any ripe avocados, and it worked out fine. I also used flour tortillas (because I couldn't find corn) and cut them into triangles as another reviewer did - thanks for the great idea.

if you're making this recipe for two people you will definitely have leftovers....but that's okay because this is a fantastic meal! instead of frying the corn tortillas, i baked them for a little over 5 minutes in the oven - beforehand, i lightly coated each corn tortilla with a little bit of cooking spray and then slightly seasoned with some salt & paprika. good stuff.

I am not a big fan of corn tortillas - but I always want to give a recipe a fair chance the first time I make it. So, I made the corn tortillas AND made some flour tortillas the same way. The corn ones were okay (hey, I tried), but the flour tortillas rocked. The crab/pepper mixture was great - we added a little green hot sauce & I used 1 lb crab instead of 3/4 lb. The only other thing I would change is making 1/2 instead of the whole recipe (my mistake)- it just made way too much for 2 people. We used the leftovers to make burritos - excellent as well.

excellent recipe, the crowd begged for more. when making the chips i would cu in trinangle pieces instead of circle ( there is alot of waste in cutting into circles) otherwise easy and delicious!!
