This is a nice dessert recipe for those who like the taste of ginger. I recommend following the recipe as is. There is no need for any refinements or changes. Just follow the directions. The crust is perfect as is. Don't forget to put more sugar on top before you bake it, and watch it so it doesn't overcook. I cooked it at 425 for the entire 40 minutes. I was concerned because the crust looked burned, but it was just the sugar. It tasted great, and got great reviews by my dinner guests.

I used freshly grated dried ginger instead of crystallized ginger. The combination of this, apples, and lemon is very tasty and unexpected. I took the other reviewer's advice of lowering the oven to 350, but it took forever to cook. I ended up turning up the temperature to 425 for the last 10 minutes to get a golden brown crust.

Totally screwed up the pastry part. I had to use salted butter and that might be why. It fell completely apart, so I just dumped the mess in a pie dish and baked it like that. I forgot to follow the other reviewers' advice about lowering the oven temp and while my "crostata" didn't burn, I think a lower temp would have been better. I didn't add the extra sugar in the filling as crystallized ginger has enough on it already. Guests loved it even though it was a mess.

I made two different versions of this -- one exactly as directed, and another with cinnamon instead of the ginger. The crust cracked and sugary filling oozed out both times (I had refrigerated it for 24 hours). Also, the baking time is off -- it should be shorter or not as hot. Even with the cracks, it tasted good. I like the unique flavor the crystallized ginger gives.

This recipe was awesome, it's so easy and looked beautiful (and tasted better...) I only chilled my dough for the time it took to mix up the filling, and it turned out just fine. I also made five little crostatas instead of one big one, and I found that about half an hour at three hundred fifty degrees was just right (425 was way too hot). I also used a tablespoon of maple syrup instead of ginger, and added cinnamon sugar to the whole thing before baking, and it turned out well.

this rustic tart is quite rich. there is a lot of butter in the pastry. I would like to try it again using less. it is quite lovely, and I would make it again for company. (I had bought the ingredients for a company dinner, but had to cancel)
