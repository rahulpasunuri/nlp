This made for a beautiful and light summer dessert. My guests raved and ate every last bit. A wonderful dessert for a hot day.

If you have never made summer pudding, you must try this. You won't believe how good it is. I made 2 huge bowls full for a crowd using a combination of straw- and raspberries. Everyone pigged out. PS Fitting the bread into the bowls, jigsaw style is fun.

I have served this desert twice, and it was a hit both times. A great summer desert, generous portions. I added a little powdered sugar to the whip cream mixture, because I prefer mine sweet. Be sure to be generous when measuring the berries, the first time I made it I ran a bit short on the berrie mixture. This recipe is a keeper !
