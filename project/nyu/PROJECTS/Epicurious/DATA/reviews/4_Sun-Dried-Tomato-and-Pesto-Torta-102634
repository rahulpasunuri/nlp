This beautiful appetizer tastes as good as it looks. It is really spectacular to serve during Thanksgiving or Christmas because the colors complement the season. But you can also serve it anytime that you want to celebrate a special occasion. Your guest will rave when they taste it and everyone will ask for the recipe. This is a keeper!

YUM! everything about this is wonderful. I did about 1/2 the butter called for and used goat cheese for the remainder. It does make a lot, but no one is complaing about the left overs. Great for a party with lots of people.

My family loved this spread. For the butter and cream cheese mixture I replaced the cream cheese with goat cheese and it was great - tangy. I used a fluted, container to mold which enhanced the the presentation. I did use a good quality, prepared pesto. Came out perfect and yummy. I served with some olive crackers.

Really good. I followed the advice of others below. I used half cream cheese and half soft goat cheese and the results were fantastic. This makes a very large portion and in my case we were able to send some some home with friends. The only thing I would do differently is pack the basil leaves for the pesto a little better. The pesto flavor could have been stronger but I know that was my fault. Fantastic. I will be making this again!

I have rated this, though haven't eaten/tried it yet (gave it 4 stars because I didn't want to throw off the ratings w/ no forks). Anyways, I've been wanting to make this appetizer since someone brought it to a party I was hosting is 2004 and am just getting around to making it now! After reading many of the reviews, took a stab at it. Couple of things to note for those looking to make this for the first time, I read a review that said they made this is a 9 inch springform pan, well, I tried that and unfortunately I think it's too big. I was only able to do 4 layers (first cream cheese/butter, 1 tomato, another cream cheese, and pesto. I had to go buy more ingredients to make more cream cheese/butter to finish off the layer-which is still several layers short. I'm hoping the taste will still be Ok, but the presentation will probably be a bit less impressive. Found refrigerating between layers helped, and I've frozen it for a party I'm hosting Friday night. Will post after my guests have tried it.

I've been making this recipe ever since the 1999 issue came out. I am not allowed at my brother's birthday/Christmas Eve celebration without it and it is always a HUGE hit. The assembly takes a bit of time at first (room temperature cream cheese and butter is important and helpful) but once you get the hang of it, I find I can make this recipe in less than an hour from start to finish and it is well worth the effort. It is a do-ahead, delicious and very festive-looking addition to any holiday gathering. Enjoy!

Did you see the clouds open up and the sun streaming down on this recipe? I made this using homemade pesto from my freezer. It made enough to fill 4 minature springform pans (yes, I'm a gadget fiend and have mini-springform pans). I put a nice large piece of saran wrap in the spring form, sprayed with Pam, then layered as indicated. Next I covered each with another layer of cling wrap and froze them. Served one for an Italian Feast (gone in minutes) and have been able to enjoy serving them at other events after thawing in fridge. Easy. Volumes of flavor. Yummy on pannini.

Adding the trick of slightly freezing each layer makes this a perfect dish. I make my own homemade pesto in the summer and my own homemade dried tomatoes, so this created a wonderful appetizer to take to a New Year's Eve party. It does make A LoT!!!!!!!!!

Fabulous! People kept coming back for more.I did leave out the butter and replaced it with goat cheese. Thanks to the earlier reviews, I used vegetable oil spray on the spoon to simplify spreading. I used shortening on the bowl before adding the plastic wrap and it seemed to keep it in place better than the vegetable oil spray. Excellent and simple.

I wish I had read all the helpful hints before I made this the first time. In any respect, I've made it several times and they all came out wonderfully and everyone loved it. After the first time, I did cut the recipe by 1/3. Next time, I'll follow others' advice and make the full batch, but divide among two tortas. (Easier on the math, too.) Also had some time-savers, too. When I harvest my basil, I make pesto and freeze it in small batches, so I used that rather than make pesto from scratch again. Also, I found a sun-dried tomato pesto that works just as well. All in all, a very festive dessert. Do yourself a favor and read through all the reviews before starting out.

This is an amazing appetizer! I made it today & brought it to a dinner party. Everyone loved it:) I shortened the prep time by using pre-made pesto.I also placed the torte in the freezer for 30 minutes & then in the refrigerator for an additional 6 hours. It came out perfectly! I will definitely make this again:)

This is a delicious appetizer with a wonderful presentation that will really wow your guests. It is some what time consuming to make, but not difficult. I have found that putting the torta in the freezer for a few minutes between layers makes it easier to spread the next layer cleanly, and that keeping a spoon in a dish of hot water helps to spread each layer as well. I make this often for buffet spreads, and never fail to garner compliments. Be aware, it does make a lot!

I needed a dish for a holiday party that I could make ahead. This looked festive and I decided to give it a try. It makes such a large amount it was a big hit at two parties. I will definitely add it to my recipe box. Several suggestions from the other reviewers were very helpful. Most important was to use a hot dry spoon to spread the layers. Second was to put the dish in the freezer between layers to harden the previous layer. Finally, I substituted goat cheese for one cup of the cream cheese. I couldn't find enough basil so I had to use prepared pesto but I would prefer to use the fresh basil. I don't think it would be any more difficult and as another reviewer suggests it would probably taste even better!

Rating: 4
I've made this twice in the last week for separate events; Once with a prepared jar of pesto (as others suggested), and the other exactly as the recipe states. Let me say that the prepared basil pesto does not taste NEARLY as good as this fresh mixture. It's extremely salty, processed, and boring. And if you're going to spend the $$$ on the very expensive prepared pesto, then you may as well make it yourself! I won 1st place in a potluck with the fresh pesto torta. It's delicious, complex, rich. A little goes a very long way. And it looks absolutely lovely.

I made this recipe last year for a Christmas party and got rave reviews. My family used the left-overs to make panini's. We used thinly sliced london broil, sliced torta, and arugula for the panini. They were really good. My family has requested I make this torta again this year just for the sandwiches!

Rating: 4
I made this recipe based on the great reviews and I ideally wanted something I could make ahead of time. The previous reviews were very helpful - I too made the full recipe but split it into two portions - one full half to serve 3 days later and then split the other half between three ramekins that I have in the freezer. Additional tips that I would add are: 1) I find cream cheese traditionally hard to mix so I put the cream cheese and butter mixture in the microwave on defrost for just a very short period to soften it slightly and this allowed me to use the electrice beaters to easily blend them; 2) I did not have any problem layering the layers as I too put the dish into the freezer just for a few minutes btwn layers; 3) I used prepared pesto - amount wise I believe my jar was somewhere around 170-198 mls - let the jar stand and POUR OFF the oil that rises to the top like another reviewer suggested; 4) to serve, I was not sure how "firm" the torta would be right out of the fridge so I brought it out about 45-60 mins before serving it -probably 30 mins would be adequate; 5) I served it with sour dough baguette slices which was firm enough I didn't toast the slices; 6) For WINE we served a New Zealand Saugvignon Blanc which went nicely.

This recipe is super easy. I made it even easier by buying store bought pesto. I prefer reduced fat pesto as it keeps the oil content down. This dip with pita chips has been a big hit at several events I took it to. I also skipped the butter.

This is my gold standard appetizer for holiday parties.

This was very tasty as an appetizer. As a spread on a hamburger it was transformation to delight. I actually mixed a bit in my hamberger before grilling and wow was it good.

This recipe is excellent and I've gotten rave reviews every time I've made it. I use goat cheese instead of cream cheese and it packs a little bit of a bite. I also use Asiago cheese instead of Parmesan just because it's what I always have on hand and like. This recipe does require a bit of time to make, but is well worth the time and effort to make it. It does make quite a bit, and I've cut it in half and have frozen part of it. When I want t use the frozen part, I take it out a day ahead of time and let it thaw in the fridge. I could make a meal of this and cocktail bread.

Made for a party and everyone raved! I did sub 1 cup goat cheese for 1 cup cream cheese in the cheese butter layer and it was great. Used a 5 cup souffle bowl lined with plastic wrap. To turn out, I simply pulled the torta out of the dish by pulling up on the plastic wrap. Then I placed a plate over that and inverted it. Perfect, could see the layers nicely. Freeze for a few minutes between layers and spray the back of a spoon with PAM to spread. Easy!

I found this recipe easy to make using a hot dry spoon to spread. I'm not worried about the rough appearance after it is turned out, as an imperfect finish gives it a rustic, authentic appearance. Bring several copies of the recipe with you if you make this for a carry-in.

Keeping cling wrap wrinkle free is a challenge. However do not despair. Run a knife under hot water and once you've turned the torta out, you can gently smooth out any wrinkles. Despite it's challenges, this was a definite crowd pleaser and will be a regular over Christmas/NY in our house. This can be frozen for at least a month.

I used a 9-inch spring form pan and it worked out perfectly. Mixing in goat cheese - as previously mentioned in other reviews - is recommended to the cream cheese / butter portion, though I haven't tried it without it. If you're having problems with spreading the layers, the easiest remedy I could imagine is use your fingers. A little messy, but less frustrating. For being a mid-twenties, recent college grad, this blew my friends' minds. Well, honestly, being a mid-twenties, recent college grad and throwing a dinner party blew my friends' minds.

I made this as an appetizer for a wedding reception. It was a hit and numerous guests asked for the recipe. I made it with 1/2 soft goat cheese and 1/2 cream cheese. I think with just cream cheese it would be a bit bland. I might even make it with 100% goat cheese next time. Very tasty.

I followed other reviewers' advice and divided this into two batches, freezing one for next week. It was good, although the tomato flavor dominated everything. Maybe that's because I cheated and used bottled pesto? I also used mostly goat cheese with the butter and think cream cheese alone would have been much too bland. When I unfreeze the other I think I'll drizzle it with basil oil for a little more pesto taste.

I used purchased pesto, and subbed 1 cup of goat cheese for cream cheese, but otherwise followed recipe exactly. The plastic wrap lined bowl worked just fine for me, and I froze in between layers to assist spreading, and the whole thing popped right out when I was ready. My edges were a little sloppy and the layers didn't show as clearly as I wanted, so I used a warm knife and trimmed the torta into a square - voila! Instantly beautiful and all layers showing clearly. I served it with a variety of crackers and some carrot and celery sticks. It was a huge hit! I got a lot of compliments on the flavors of this dish. It was very easy to make, just a little time consuming due to the freezing in between layers, but basically simple. I will definitely make this again!

Very delicious for those with a gourmet taste. As other reviewers noted, using prepared pesto is a terrific time-saver. I poured off all of the oil that I could and added in the lemon juice and cream cheese. I added a bit of parmesan to the cream cheese/butter mixture. If you're not shy, using your hands to spread the tomato and pesto layers is really the best - freezing in between the cream cheese layers. Beautiful presentation. Just served it with french baguette slices. It was a hit at my party!

This got so many wonderful reviews I was psyched to make it. I found it to be just ok. The cream cheese top really needed some help - maybe the goat cheese added as others recommended.

This is the perfect dish and display for a Holiday Party! I used a store bought pesto mixture, it was delicious and made for a simple and fast preparation.

I halved this recipe for a holiday open house. I assembled it in a 6 inch cake pan, sprayed with cooking spray and lined with wax paper. To release it, I warmed the pan in hot water briefly, and it unmolded fairly easily. This was very pretty, easy to prepare and very popular. I would have preferred the layers to be thicker, which I think I could accomplish by choosing a smaller diameter mold next time. By the way, I used purchased pesto. I would do that again -- saved much time, and still delicious.

As I was making this as one of several appetizers for 8 people, I halved this recipe, which was a nice amount. (I used an 8 ounce CoolWhip container as my mold which was perfect, though next time I'll put a cardboard round in the bottom so the top will be flat). Maybe it was bcause of this smaller amount, or maybe it was because I used the Neufchatel cheese, which is softer than full cream cheese, but I had absolutely no problem spreading the layers (it was late at night and I didn't want to take the extra time to chill or freeze between layers), and they came out beautifully! I just plunked on and spread, no piping. I also used light (50%) butter - just to get the butter flavor without all the calories - there were enough in it as it was - and it was still delicious! This is a definite keeper, a real show-stopper.

I've made this several times,and it's always a huge hit. I like substituting a 4-oz log of goat cheese for 1/2 cup of the cream cheese in the butter-cheese mixture, for added flavor. Even people who say they don't like goat cheese like this! This does make a huge amount, especially if other appetizers are being served. I also make 2 small containers, and freeze one for later (it freezes well). We are going to a picnic tomorrow, and camping with a group next weekend; I'm taking a small plastic container of the torta in a cooler to each event, and unmolding it there. Definitely worth the mess in the kitchen!

I made this for a Christmas appetizer. I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I used store bought pesto, but it was equally delicious! The only suggestion I have if you us a store bought pesto is to drain it first as they usually have more oil than homemade. The extra oil made it hard to spread the cream cheese mixture on top. I would also suggest, as someone else already did, to refrigerate (or even stick it in the freezer for a few minutes) between layers. It makes it much easier to spread your mext layer. I also sprayed the back of my spoon with Pam, which is a nifty little trick! Enjoy, this recipe is a great crowd-pleaser!

I've made this recipe several times before and it is wonderful. This time, I tried adding a little crumbled goat cheese. Blech! We found it WAY too tart. I would not try that again.

Made this for a barbecue and it was the hit of the party! Individually, each spread is good, but the combo of the three together is truly outstanding.

I've made this several times now, and it is a HUGE hit. I use a medium springform pan lined with parchment paper, which makes unmolding quite easy.

I have made this several times, and although the layers are difficult to spread, it is worth it. Guests always rave. It makes a HUGE amount though. I halved the recipe the last time I made it and used a loaf pan and it came out fine. Try parchment paper cut to fit your pan to avoid the lines the plastic wrap leaves. And I had some success putting the butter/cream cheese mixture in a baggie, snipping the corner of the bag, and piping out in long lines, then spreading carefully with a spatula. I use paprika sprinkled on top rather than the pine nuts for presentation.

I've made this recipe several times now, making pesto from scratch and using pesto from a jar. I find using premade pesto saves a few steps with no obvious difference in the final product. Every time I've made this I've received rave reviews and many requests for the recipe. Presentation is alway impressive even with imperfect layers. This definitely is a recipe worth keeping (laminating as one reviewer puts it)!!

Rating: 4
As I was making this recipe, I swore I would never make it again because it was such a pain! The cream cheese and butter layer seemed to be the most difficult one to spread, even after trying the suggestions of previous reviewers. I had a sinkful of dishes and was getting very annoyed by the whole time consuming process. But when I unmolded the torta I was very impressed by its appearance, even though my layers were not perfect. Then I heard the ooo's and ah's from everyone who was eating it, and tasted it myself and all the hassle of making it just seemed to go away. It is absolutely delicious!

Personally, I think provolone would be too firm, compared with the softness of the other layers. I admit I'm not a perfectionist, but I've made this many times, and the layers have always looked fine in the end. Don't stress out about it. The flavor is fantastic, the colors are festive, and this is as close to a guaranteed hit as one can get. In fact, I'm starting to prep it tonight for Christmas Eve. Definitely a laminate-worthy recipe.

I'm considering making this recipe to bring to a Christmas party but I'm hesitant after reading the problems with the layers. Does any one think it would work if I stabilized each layer with a slice of provolone cheese?

Made this recipe for a conference hospitality room over the holiday break. People grabbed the entire dish off the serving table & sat down around it and ate it 'till it was completely gone. I followed the recipe exactly except I used purchased pre-made pesto. I used a plastic jello mold & it seemed to work fine. YUM!!! A definite keeper.

Have made this twice and it has always been successful. I find it difficult though to spread the layers and not have them smush together. I've solved that by plopping down small spoonfuls of each layer and then gently merging them with a knife. It certainly looks nice, but it picks up the wrinkles from the plastic wrap and the layers certainly do not come out as even as in the photograph. But it tastes nice.

This is a show-stopping crowd pleaser that is worth the time (I'd allow 2 hours) it takes to make. I added 4 oz. feta to the cream cheese/butter mixture, along with 1/2 tsp white pepper to give it a little kick. Whoever suggested early on in the reviews to use a spoon dipped in hot water (and dried) to smooth the layers is a genius, it works like a charm! I used sandwich-size zip-loc bags as piping bags for the pesto and tomato layers and that was easier than trying to spoon it on. Also put the pan in the freezer about 5 minutes between layers to harden it a little. Wrapped well, this will freeze up to a month ahead.

This is a huge recipe. I cut the recipe in half and molded it in 2 mini loaf pans. This recipe took me a little longer than expected and it was a little difficult to half the recipe and judge what kind of mold to put it in. Anyway, it tasted nice and will try again making the full recipe.

Fabulous! I made this for an Italian themed wine party of 40 people and it got rave reviews. Simple to make. I made the mistake of (having a glass of wine b/4 making it)buttering instead of oiling the dish so it was harder to unmold. I had guests arriving and so I heated a wet dishtowel in the micro until I could warm the butter up enough to unmold. It turned out beautiful. This serves a lot of people. I had at least 1/2 leftover. I had 8 other heavy appetizers. I am always worried about not having enough food for my guests. No worry with this one!

This makes a beautiful hors d'ouvres. It makes quite a bit. If you are making it for fewer than 20 people, I suggest that you half or even quarter the recipe and make it in a smaller dish -or even individual ramekins. This dish will get people talking!

Oh my god!!! This one is a keeper!!! Everybody raved about it... I had a little trouble unmolding it (I didn´t want to loosen it with a spatula or a knife since I wanted it to look as perfect as it does on the picture) so I dipped the souffle dish in hot water and then inverted it on the plate. Very nice, I would definetively do it again!!!

Rating: 4
Great taste! Devoured by guests and all of them took some of the leftovers and the recipe home with them. I made it in the morning and served that night, still tasted good; I would make it ahead next time for more flavor-melding. I also used 2 c. prepared pesto instead of making this recipe, b/c I had a ton of it. I used only 1/4 cup butter, and would probably leave it out entirely next time and just add a bit more salt to the cream cheese.

Rating: 4
I made this for a party on Saturday and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I used store-bought pesto because I couldn't find basil that looked good. I'm glad I read the reviews because I did try the spoon dipped in hot water to make it spread more easily, and it worked beautifully! Next time I will try it with fresh basil. I will be making this again!

Rating: 4
This has become one of my party staples. I love to make it -- and people just rave about it. Having made it at least 10 times, I think the best way to do the layers is by having TRULY room temperature cream cheese -- the softer it is, the easier it will be to spread. I use the plastic bags with an end snipped off and a hot spoon lightly covered with cooking spray. Very simple. I've gotten it down to where the whole thing takes about 30 minutes. And I like to experiment with different dishes -- sometimes a round souffle dish, once a cube-shaped vase! Fun, tasty and beautiful...

I made this torta for a party for a group of people that I had never cooked for before but who all thought I was this incredible chef. Needless to say, I wowed them! None of them cook very much so nobody asked for the recipe, I think it intimidated them because it was so beautiful. Great presentation and wonderful flavor. I served it with toasted french bread rounds. Awesome!! Thanks for making me look so good Bon Appetit.

I tried this torta at a holiday party and was one of many who asked for the recipe. When I served it at my New Year's Eve Party, I had to return the favor and send out several copies. It was the most popular hors d'oeuvre of the evening,the flavors blend together so well that you find yourself going back for more. If that isn't enough, my young children who don't want to see a speck of green in their food, gobbled it up!

This recipe is well worth the time it takes to prepare. I use a decorating tube with a large tip to add each layer. Add each layer in a spiral pattern and then smooth with a warm spreader or knife. MUCH easier.

As with the other 100 reviews...this was a big hit and beautiful. The friend who prepared it did say she cussed so much she began laughing about how much trouble she had spreading the cream cheese layer, but she got the job done and it was well worth it for the rest of us!

I have made this appetizer for several get togethers and holidays. This dish is impressive, both by its presentation and its taste. To speed it up I buy purchase prepared pesto and bread from the bakery. I also present it with olives, artichokes, and cheeses like an antipasto platter. I am asked for the recipe often, but more often, I am just asked to bring it again and again. Great for the upcoming holidays; the colors are festive and it's easy to serve for a crowd.

Rating: 4
All my guests loved this torta! I had a bit of a problem with spreading my layers (except the basil one) they were a bit thick, maybe because I had the windows open and it was cold out, so it really wasn't room temperature. Anyway, here's a tip if you have this problem too (besides closing the windows), drop tablespoons full of whatever layer you're working with, in little clumps all over the surface. This way, you don't have to try and spread from one central location. I found the basil layer "looser", so when I put my next layer down, it sort of smeared together, until I came up with the clumps thing.

Rating: 4
If you want to impress your guests, this is the way to go about it. Everyone asked for the recipe and totally ignored my other hors d'oeuvres. I did have a problem with the pesto though. It was too liquid. I added more basil but it still was a little difficult to spread over the cream cheese.

Everyone RAVED over this. I made it a day in advance and actually followed the recipe and made the pesto as instructed. The pesto was VERY garlicky. I decided to only use half of it so it wouldn't overpower the other flavors. Next time I make this, I'll use all of the pesto to balance the the boldness of the sundried tomato mixture.

I have made this several times, always to rave reviews. I always used store-bought prepared pesto for ease of preperation. The only other change I make is to cut the butter to about 1/4 cup, as I find that 3/4 cup with the cream cheese is way too much butter, and it leaves that fatty coating on the roof of your mouth feeling. Otherwise, I found no other changes were needed.

Rating: 4
This was very good and the ability to make it up to 3 days ahead was key. The only problem I had was that in the interest of time and because it's December I used prepared pesto. Unfortunately, this recipe does not tell you how much pesto you need. I used a 4 oz. jar and it was not enough -- the pesto taste was overwhelmed by the tomatoes. When I make it again, I'll use more like 1 cup of prepared pesto.

Rating: 4
An easier, chunky version of this is to use store bought pesto and to leave the sun-dried tomatoes julienned instead of processing them (measure with the oil drained). Increase the cream cheese and butter to 4 - 8oz pkgs and 1 cup. Increase the pinenuts to 1 c. Toast them, then sprinkle heavily over the pesto layers and use to garnish on top.

Rating: 4
I recently made this for the second time and made some changes that made it even more popular than the first time. I increased the amount of basil to 3 packed cups, increased the garlic to 6 very large cloves and used only 2/3 of the sun-dried tomato mixture. I also left out the pine nuts to accommodate a nut allergy. The pesto flavor really stood out! I also used only half the butter. Next time I'll leave it out altogether. This is really, really addictive!

This was out of this world. I made it as an hors d'oevre at this year's Thanksgiving, and it was incredible. Beautiful too. I made according to the instructions, but next time, I think I'll make more of the cream cheese/butter mixture, because I didn't have enough for the last layer, but it was no big deal. This really makes a lot. Everyone loved this, and I still have a ton left over for tomorrow! Can't wait, this was scrumptious!

Always a hit! Very nice presentation. Definately add garlic to white layer. Keep a white layer between the red and green layers as mentioned in receipe-- it makes it much more dramatic. I often do not use all the butter and use low-fat mayo instead. Same consistancy, less fat.

Rating: 4
This was a BIG hit! Everyone loved it. I simplified the recipe as follows: Since cream cheese comes in 8 oz. packages, I used 4 oz (1/2 a pkg) for each of the pesto and sundried tomatoes. I used 2 pkgs (16 oz total) with 1/2 cup butter (1stick). That way I didn't have odd pieces of butter or cream cheese left over and much easier to measure. My local market sells their own pesto, both in traditional basil and in sun-dried tomato. I used about 1/2 cup of each. That made the mixing easy. I didn't have any fresh basil and sprinkled chopped walnuts on top. It was great!

Simply fabulous! Without question, this is one of the best. I made a few modifications that really worked.

It was absolutely PERFECT. My guests raved and wanted the recipe. This is an impressive looking, delicious torta.

Is this a joke? The dish tasted great, but I could not get my layers to stick to the paper, let alone come out of the dish when I tried to invert it. Luckily, my company was not picky and I set it on the table as a dip. I don't know if I will attempt again because it would not invert!!

I used a deep 6c. bowl lined with plastic wrap as I didn't have the right size mold; it was VERY easy. Don't stress about the layers being perfect. I did reduce the butter by half, and since it's Dec., used Safeway pesto on sale, and it was WONDERFUL. I took it to a holiday party where only 9 people attended and they ate at least 2/3 of it. Take/send some home for bagels the next day, should you have any leftovers. Even if your layers get messed up, it should still taste fantastic.
