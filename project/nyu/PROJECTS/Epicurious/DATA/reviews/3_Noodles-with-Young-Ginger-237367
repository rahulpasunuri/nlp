This article is very misleading - scallion and oysters are NOT permissible under the Buddhist vegetarian tradition (the type practiced in China). I am not sure whether the author gets her notion that somehow oyster are permissible because of its shape, because it's certainly not in the literature. Also mistake in the description: eggs are not diary. Please proof-read your own particles.

I'm not a good cook but a friend recommended this. It came out great and tasted great. I am surprised and proud of myself. Best of all it was easy and quick. Next time I am going to add some tofu and rabe and maybe make more sauce to account for the extra things I add.

This just didn't quite add up to what I wanted. I felt like there was something missing for my palate. This will answer any ginger craving though.

I made this for Chinese New Year, and it was very very good. I was so pleasantly surprised, as Chinese cuisine is not my forte. It was delicate, light and TASTY! I thought the recipe called for too much ginger, but it was actually just right. For extra kick, you could probably pop in half of a chopped chili (or less). As an additional eye-catcher, I tossed in some chopped spring onions.
