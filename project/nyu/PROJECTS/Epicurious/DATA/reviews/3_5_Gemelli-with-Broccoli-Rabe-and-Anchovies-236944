Absolutely delicious, though I think the proportions are a little bit off. I used far less olive oil than called for to cook the garlic, anchovies, and pepper, and still think it was cooked well and flavorful. Next time, I'll also use half a pound - or even less - of pasta; I felt like an entire pound didn't let the sauce shine through enough.

Absolutely love this recipe. I make my own breadcrumbs and then toast them in a pan with olive oil. These have much much better texture than panko which becomes soggy too quickly and adds no taste. Also I cook the broccoli rabe seperately from the pasta to make sure it is cooked properly and not over cooked and then I cut the stems roughly into big sections which makes it a bit easier to eat. I throw the broccli rabe into the pan with the garlic and anchovies and toss lightly with a splash of the pasta water before adding the pasta as this helps the flavours mix better.

Not for the faint of heart, and yet somehow not very exciting. Oh well, glad I tried it but not making it again.

This was simple and good. A little on the bland side as well but was easily fixed with freshly grated parmesan. I also sauteed asparagus separately and added to each plate to mix in w/ the pasta. The texture is great: crunchy panko w/ al dente pasta. yummm. I'll add more broccoli rabe next time.

This is a great tasting simple, dish. I was too lazy to go to the specialty shop to get panko so instead I used fresh bread crumbs from a loaf of crusty Italian. Also, before plating and off the heat, I added a modest amount of freshly grated romano cheese and then grated some more on top of each plate. Really fantastic!

This was delicious and very easy. I used chopped broccolini (because that is what I had) and added it with the pasta so it could cook longer. I also substituted anchovy paste for anchovies. I used less oil in the garlic mixture and instead of adding the pasta to the skillet, I combined everything in a bowl which worked out well. Slightly spicy, salty, and crunchy.

Loved this pasta dish! Didn't have panko so I saved time by crushing some good quality packaged garlic croutons instead and skipped the whole oven step. Great supper dish!

this is VERY tasty and VERY easy. only concern is that there is a lot of olive oil - any ideas on how to lighten w/out losing flavor. crunchy panko is a nice touch. went well with zinfandel - thought i probably spiced it up more than most would.

I thought this was just okay. I used kale instead of brocolli rabe which I guess was fine, but like the other reviewers, I felt that it was lacking something. Will try to make it again with a few adjustments.

I added more anchovies, but still thought it needed a bit more flavor to help balance out the bitterness of the broccoli rabe. Maybe more red pepper?

I made this as a side and was pleased. I only had regular Italian breadcrumbs on hand and they worked fine. I will add more rabe and anchovie next time.

While this was good, the taste could have been more distinctive. I added sauteed shallots and extra garlic but maybe more anchovies would have helped.
