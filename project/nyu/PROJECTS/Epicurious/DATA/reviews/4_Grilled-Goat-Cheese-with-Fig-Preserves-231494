So simple yet so yummy! I call it a grilled cheese for grown-ups (although my children like it too).

Absolutely delicious. The tanginess of the goat cheese perfectly compliments the sweetness of the fig preserves. I was blown away at how good such a simple recipe can be. I usually have this with a honey/apple cider vinaigrette mesclun salad and some fresh fruit.

The goat cheese becomes so creamy it's almost fluffy. Almost as good as grilled brie & chutney sandwiches.

Great quick meal. I paired it with tomato soup & a salad. I could not find "dark" fig preserve, so I used plain fig preserve & it turned out great. I think any good quality preserve would work well with this sandwich.

This is delicious. Sophisticated,but not "too different" flavour combination was a hit with the adults AND kids at my last get-together.

Sounds strange but tastes amazing! Very nice upgrade from a grilled cheese sandwich and just as quick!
