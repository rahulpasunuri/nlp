Little bit of a bother but worth the trouble.

What a wonderful dish! I added all of the ingredients called for in the recipe, but used less salt. The only other change I made was to roast all of the vegetables (eggplant, peppers, onion, celery and a small bulb of fennel) while the tomatoes and garlic cooked. I think that streamlined the recipe a bit. This is the best capanota I have ever made. Thanks epicurious!

As other reviewers said this took a long time to make but was completely worth it. I also left out the salt at the end, there was plenty in the eggplant, capers and olives. My husband liked the caponata served warm over pasta. I like to skew it a bit mid-East by add some cumin, hot pepper and cinnamon and serving it cold with hummus and baba gounoush. Definitely worth the effort.

Mindblowing!!! This recipe is a lot of work but the payoff is well worth it. I had never had caponata before but it was amazing- so much flavor for a vegetarian dish. I will definitely make this again. Absolutely amazing!!!!

This is delicious! I've only ever had caponata from a jar before (disgraceful, I know), and couldn't believe how fresh and delicious this tasted! I only made a handful of changes. I didn't have a thermometer, so I just winged the frying and cooked the eggplant when the oil seemed hot- it turned out wonderfully. I actually had to stop myself from eating all the salted fried eggplant before it went into the caponata. I did not add the extra 1 tsp salt to the caponata- my eggplant was still plenty salty, my canned tomatoes had salt, and the capers and olives are salty (not to mention the celery is boiled in salted water), so I didn't want to overdo it. I tasted it the next day to see if it needed extra salt and thought it was delicious the way it was. Perhaps err on the side of less salt: you can always add more. Also, from other reviews (and personal preference), I cut way back on the olives. Even though I multiplied the recipe by 1.5 (I was cooking for a lot of people), I only put in a rounded 1/2 c of olives. Everyone loved it, even people who hate olives. Many people wanted the recipe. Will definitely make again- it may become my signature dish to bring to parties.

Excellent dish and very much worth all the effort it took to make it. I'm not a fan of raisins in caponata and was glad this one didn't contain any. I love olives and thought they were perfect in the dish! I served this on lightly-toasted ciabatta rolls with fresh mozzarella for lunch. Fabulous!

Outrageously good. The eggplant had a fair amount of salt left in it from the first step, so I didn't add any more salt. I had no capers, olives, celery, parsley, or basil on hand so I just left them out; replaced the red wine vinegar with balsamic; and used a bit less sugar. OK, so it doesn't seem to bear much resemblance to the original recipe, but wow was it good. And yes, I agree it's a heck of a lot of effort.

I have treasured this recipe since it first appeared in Gourmet over twenty years ago. It is the best, and I have tried several.

This recipe is fantastic as others have noted. Due to time constraints, I omitted the olives but will add them next time. Also, I substituted a good quality balsamic for the red-wine vinegar because I sometimes find that red-wine vinegar can be too astringent and can ruin a dish rather than enhance it. I used a sourdough baguette, a bread with more texture and body than just a plain Italian or French baguette that has little substance. All in all, a keeper I will definitely make again!

Very good recipe, and I'd definitely make it again. Although I think I'll leave out the olives next time, or at least put in less. They hijack the flavor of the dish when you get more than a one or two bits in any bite.

I made this recipe for a party this past Sunday. It was delicious. The only thing I changed was ommiting the olives. I will definitely make it again.

This is one of those great recipes that you can make and do a million things with. On crackers, bruschetta, eggs, with meat or by itself. It makes a bunch, so you can give it to your friends and they can be creative with it. An Italian-American friend loves this but, he can't remember what it's called, so he just says, "Can you make some more of that Roy Campanella dip?"

I agree that this is the best caponata ever. I did, however reduce the amount of sugar to about 2 Tablespoons. I served it with rack of lamb that I marinated in olive oil, garlic, lemon zest and juice, and lots of fresh herbs: rosemary,thyme, chives, and oregano for a dear friend's 50th birthday dinner. YUMMMMMMM

Okay, this dish was very time consuming, next time I would break it down into steps (make the eggplant and tomato sauce the day before) but it is WELL worth the effort!!! Make a double batch, store half in the freezer, Excellent over salmon steaks baked in the oven, its good served hot or chilled. I would give it 5 forks if I Could.

This is identical to a recipe in Gourmet in the 1980's (1986?) that has been a staple in my cooking for twenty years. The best caponata recipe, bar none. And I've tried many.
