Sauce was great...crab cakes just okay. The other ingredients seemed to overpower the taste of crab...maybe better suited to salmon cakes instead?

I didn't use the crabcake recipe as I have a family one I've always used and love. I did try the Chipotle Sauce and it is beautiful and simple!

Really, really good sauce. Made it with my own crab cakes, which are perfect so I don't mess with any other recipe. But the sauce was outstanding.

The Masa Harina didn't do anything for me.

I only made the sauce, and added a bit of chopped cilantro, as my crabcakes had cilantro in them. Very good. I suggest making this up a few hours ahead so the flavors can blend.

I am a caterer and teach cooking classes and was looking for a "spread" to accompany a southwestern chicken sandwich that I needed to make for a party...WOW is all I can say about the chipotle sauce. It made a great sandwich spectacular!! I too added extra chili's and some of the adobo sauce the chipotles came packed in. Also seeded the chili'c before I threw everything in the cuisinart to mix. VERY easy, with amazing flavor, I have added it to my cooking class teaching menus. Did not try the crab cake recipe,as I have one I have been working with for years.

These were good, not great, and I can't say that the sauce wowed us either. However, they were so easy that I'm sure I'll end up making them again.

Absolutely delicious and very easy to make. Finding the fresh crabmeat was the most difficult part. I used Old Bay Seasoning and seasoned salt to taste. I added extra adobe sauce from the chipotle container to the sauce for more flavor.

I've made these twice now and they are great but they do tend to fall apart even if you refrigerate them. I think next time I'll try ading half a beaten egg to see if that helps. I also used half lobster and half crab one of the times. Yummy.

Just made the chipotle sauce and it is zesty and delicious. Easy to prepare and got many compliments...gave out the recipe to mom and this is better than any horseradish/mayo/ketchup dip. I'll use this sauce for other appetizers as well...would be great to drizzle over tacos too!

Sauce is simple and flavorful, and so are the cakes, but the binder is just not strong enough to keep from falling apart. I have used James Peterson's recipe from Fish & Shellfish without fail every time. He incorporates eggs and milk, then dusts the cakes in a bit of flour before sauteing in butter.

Only made the sauce and used in conjunction with "Louisiana Deviled Crab Cakes" also on this site. Easy and delicious but I used the juice I had saved from roasting peppers (I always peel and seed them in a colander in a bowl and reserve the wonderful smoked juices) instead of peppers in a jar. Also increased chipotle. Great!

Very nice and easy recipe--will definitely make this again. The sauce was yummy, but I added a bit more chipotle than called for and I also put in some of the adobo sauce that the chilis were packed in--this gave the sauce a nice, smokey flavor. On the crab cakes, I also added some breadcrumbs to help with the texture. Definitely season everything (sauce and crab cakes) with salt--and a bit of white pepper on the crab cakes.

I am giving the sauce 4 forks, so incredibly good! I didn't follow the crab cake recipe at all, just made up my own after looking at several recipes on this and other web sites, and they turned out great, but the sauce is what made them really stand out from other crab cakes! Plus, I served a salad of avocado, tomato, lime, red onion, and cilantro with the cakes and sauce, my guests loved it, and I thought it was the best crab cake dish that I have ever had!! Also, used high quality canned lump crab meat, it gave the cakes great texture, and coated the cakes with cracker meal right before frying, awesome!

YUM! This recipe is the best I've had for crab cakes. I try to use what I have on hand 1st before buying more ingredients. I only had fresh green bell & used that, in addition to some roasted red bell, in the crab cakes. I didn't have any lemon peel, but used some lemon juice. And being in CO, fresh crab is very expensive, so we used canned lump crab meat. Worked just fine. I put the crab cakes in the fridge for a bit before coating & frying. Otherwise, they seemed too wet & would fall apart. The sauce was a little bland for our tastes, even after mincing more chipotles, so I added some chipotle tabasco (a wonderful marinade for almost everything) & some cilantro. Oh, so good!!

I made this when it first appeared in Bon Appetite years ago. I followed it to the tee and found the masa to be overpowering. I refused to give up so I made it again the next week. The second time I used fresh bread crumbs mixed in the crabmeat for the binder and coated them with the toasted masa and they were perfect. We love chipotle chiles and the sauce would seem overpowering but it is anything but!!. I have saved all of my Bon Appetite magazines over the years but could not seem to locate this recipe until now, I'll be making these again soon. I may try to make mini cakes and serve the sauce as a dip for my next get together!

Enjoyed tremendously, but didn't have Masa Harina, so used bread crumbs in the mix and Panko coating just before frying the crab cakes. It turned out great.

I made the Chipotle Sauce from this recipe to go with the crab cakes I made from another recipe, the Super Rich Virginia Crab Cakes. The sauce is excellent with the crab. I tasted it alone, and the mayonnaise flavor was a little overwhelming but with the crab cakes it was PERFECT. I highly recommend it and it's really easy to make.

Wonderful and different! The aroma of the Masa Harina toasting in the oven was heavenly.

A wonderful twist on crab cakes. I have made this four times and my guests always love it.

Perhaps I have done something wrong here. I did not care for the Masa. I found it to be a bit heavy and overpowering for the crab cakes. I also used canned crab and maybe that was my mistake. The chipotle sauce was delicious, but I suppose I am more of a traditionalist and enjoy a basic crab cake better.

I had to change the recipe a bit because in Southwestern Connecticut I wasn't able to find Masa Harina. Sooo, I used a half cup of Dare crackers (the buttery ones) crunched up for the mixture, then used breadcrumbs (from fresh French bread) for the outer coating. These were probably the best crab cakes we've ever had. The sauce too was wonderful - I didn't care for it when I first made it, but used with the crab cakes it was the perfect flavor. I will make these over and over again! One more note, I made 8 larger cakes and put them in the oven to keep warm as guests were arriving. Worked perfectly!

Made this recipe several years ago for company who then requested the recipe. It's still as wonderful. I certainly won't wait as long to make it again!

We''ll be making this tomorrow for the fifth or sixth time over two or three years. It is superb.

This dish rocks!!! I served this for a party of 5 on Valentines Day. It was a smash. The gal was correct that wrote in her review to use more olive oil and only turn the cakes once. I used Miracle Whip for half the required amount of mayo. It balanced better with the chipotle. Next time I will not make 12 small cakes but rather 6 larger cakes. DELICIOUS!!!!

This crab cake recipe was one of the easiest to make. However, when cooking the crab cakes, add a little more oil in order to thouroghly cook the cakes, flip the cakes only once because they easily come apart when not cooked enough. This dish was made for christmas party appetizer, everyone could not get enough, I believe the sauce was the biggest hit.

This was an easy recipe and delicious. I would use the chipotle sauce as a dressing if there was left over.

EXCELLENT. Use homemade mayonnaise for the best crab cake you've ever tasted. Easy, make ahead recipe.

The Crab Cakes with Chipotle Sauce was outstanding. Not only was it easy to prepare but it was filled with flavor. I used Kraft's Miracle Whip for the sauce and it added a sweet-tone dimension which fully rounded out the chipotle flavor.

Best crab cake recipe I make. The masa harina give the cakes an interesting texture. Sauce is a good compliment.
