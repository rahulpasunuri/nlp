Substituted orange juice for the grapefruit juice. In place of the zest on top, I used chopped dark chocolate! Delicious!

Just looking at the recipe, I thought "leftover cranberry sauce". The weekend after Thanksgiving, we tested that theory, and it was most excellent. The shortbread is a perfect balance to any tart chunky cranberry sauce/relish recipe.

This was a hit at Thanksgiving. I substituted orange for grapefruit as noone in my family likes grapefruit. It went well as a bite after dinner along with coffee.
