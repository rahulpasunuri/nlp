This....is really great. I did add some left-over fajita chicken and a bit of roasted corn that I cut off the cob. As the fellow of the house says, "definitely a keeper".

THE BEST SOUP I have ever made or had. I was inspired by a local gourmet mexican restaurant, and this actually blew it out of the water. This was not too spicey, just rich with flavor. Followed steps to the T, but added: Fresh cilantro stems to the puree step, and with the broth step I added: diced rotisserie chicken dark meat, 1 cup rinsed cooked black beans, 1 cup white corn (I really wanted hominy instead of corn, but my store did not have it). I replaced the cheese with diced Ibierco (manchego-ish) and it was excellent. I'll be making this for years to come.

love this soup! My secret to great chicken stock is to roast the chicken first, peel meat from the bone and reserve for the soup, and make stock with roasted bones. It is much more flavorful and rich! I also cut my corn tortillas into strips before frying, so much easier to eat with the soup. I also added fresh cilantro on top of a dollop of sour cream. It looks good on the soup, and of course tastes wonderful.

This is a very good soup and even better on the second day. I couldn't find pasilla & chiles de arbol in the two local stores I went to, so I used New Mexico and morita chiles. Nice. Next time I'd like to add cilantro, corn, and maybe garbanzos. I also baked my tortilla strips.

I tried quite a few tortilla soup recipes before this one and all I can say is WOW. It's really savory and all those peppers have to be good for you. I rendered my broth from the last of a store-bought roasted chicken and the scraps of chicken (about a cup) were a nice addition. I'll make it again.

@Meekoh, two things, a)just because its frozen doesnt make it bad, and b)whats the fun of cooking if you cant play with the combo a little?? lighten up its just food, as long as it tatses good no one should be offended

Regarding the adddition of other things, please try not to use anything that is frozen or foreign to Mexican Cuisine, we do not have Yellow, cheesses nor anything frozen. when this soup was conceived Mexico surely didn't have frozen produce, everything should be fresh, I don't mean to offend anyone, but is important to stick to the recipe as much as possible, additions to it should be proper, don't you think ? thank you

This is the best recipe I've seen so far and the more authentic, Tortilla soup, shouldn't be thick, the broth should be light and defientely if you add chicken, should be w/chix broth, the only thing I thought I'd change is the tortilla part of it, I would cut it in strips (thin) and fried it a bit for consistency oh and also use cilantro, keep it original, you won't be disappointed

Amazing flavor! Esp. given the inexpensive ingredients and ease of preparation (of course, I used packaged organic chicken stock). I found the dried chiles in a bulk section of my grocery, in case anyone is wondering. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and added a bag of frozen corn kernels and a big handful of cilantro. Also grilled and chopped up some chicken breast and threw that in. Will definitely make this again!

Excellent recipe... I only added a bit more tomato to thicken. Outstanding and easy to make. Next time I will play with the Chile Variety. Out of the recipes I reviewed it is the closest to Mexico.. Will be in next months menu, the whole family loved it..

This was awesome with some changes: 1) I used the stock recipe from the Chipotle Chicken Tortilla Soup from this website (used parsley springs instead of cilantro - my "go to" stock recipe) It makes 4 QTS so i used 1/2 and froze the rest with 1/2 of the shredded chicken (add some carrots, celery, onion and instant chicken soup!!) 2) Added 1/2 the shredded chicken from the stock recipe at the end 3) Added some whole, plum tomatoes, chopped, to the broth at end 4) added a little guajillo and new mexico chile powder to the blender (only used 1 chile d'arbol) 5) Instead of deep frying (pain in the A**) I used the tortilla chips recipe from the Chipolte Chicken Soup recipe and just cut into squares and baked - just as delicious without the mess!! It is probably worth getting all the ingredients - they will have them at a mexican grocery store

I thought this was an outstanding tortilla soup recipe. Great complexity of flavors. I have used the chicken stock recipe over and over and over again as well.

I substituted anchos as well, but followed the recipe otherwise. It was perfect. Got raves from my guests. I've been craving it for a week. Will definitely make this again.

The soup was tasty! I substituted ancho chiles for chiles de arbol, and corn chips for the corn tortillas. I also added corn and chicken.
