I used this recipe as a base to make a roast chicken. I agree with the previous reviewer that adding water was probably not necessary. Also, because I didn't have pomegranate juice, I used a cranberry-pomegranate instead. The chicken was moist and delicious.

I made this with boneless and skinless thighs and breasts rather than poussin and I completely forgot the walnuts. I think that adding the water to the pomegranate juice was not necessary (I used barely 1/2 cup of water and think no water would have been better). I was trying to get everything done ahead of time so I coated the chicken pieces with the rub and let them sit for a little while and then seared them in a pan. I then poured the pomegranate mixture over the seared chicken and didn't complete the cooking until just before serving. I put it in the oven for 30 minutes in the same pan. It worked out very well. The chicken was very moist and tender and delicious. The pomegranate reduction to a syrupy consistency is not as evident with the burners on. I cooked it for what seemed like enough time and it still looked thin, but when I turned the burners off and it cooled a little I could see the consistency was better. It was an excellent dish and very easy.

This was my first time cooking poussins and the recipe worked out gorgeously! The pomegranate sauce gave the nuts a candied taste and flavoured the bird perfectly. Instead of the rosti I served it with a sun dried tomato rissotto to compliment the sweetness of the pomegranate glaze.

I must have done something wrong because this was the most disappointing Passover dish I have ever made. I was encouraged by the high ratings and decided to go for it. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was just...not very good. The combination of spices smelled "off", and the poussins (though not game) tasted somewhat gamey. The pomegranate sauce came out grainy and greasy. The rosti, though it sounded like it would be delicious, was really unappealing. It was pretty bland in spite of the rosemary, and very greasy. (I did make it about an hour ahead and reheat. Maybe that was the problem.) None of my guests commented about the dish one way or the other--never a good sign. Though I am a pretty experienced home cook, I must have done something wrong. Maybe it was my technique; maybe it was the quality of the poussins (bought frozen from Whole Foods); maybe these flavors simply don't appeal to me or my guests. Hard to say. In any case, I wound up feeling pretty embarrassed about it at our seder.

The potatoes needed more time than I had while I participated in the Seder and they burnt. I used cornish hens and they were annoying to try to eat. BUT, the rub and sauce were amazing and I'm going to try them on chicken parts and maybe on shrimp.

I used organic chicken thighs and breasts cut in half, bone in and skin on. I did not want to have to worry about cutting up the chickens between the seder and the dinner. When preparing the chicken, after rubbing the spices on the chicken pieces I sprinkled lemon juice all over. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. They were a big hit. They came out of the oven and just sat on the counter for the hour between when they were finished and we served dinner. They were wonderful, everyone had several pieces.

I made four cornish hens in the style of this recipe for Valentine's Day (and leftovers). They were delicious! I skipped the potato rosti and made latkes instead (my sweetheart's favorites) along with roasted asparagus and creme brulee. The pomegranate juice sauce reduced quickly, for once, and the hens made lots and lots of juice as they cooked. Plenty of rich pan juices, and I'm making a heavenly stock from the carcasses right now. Very happy with the results.

This was my first time preparing and eating Poussins. The meat was tender and sweet and the pomegranate glaze was something to remember. I did not have saffron however the meal did not lack any flavor between the cumin and turmeric. Gaging when the birds were done was the most difficult for me considering I do not like to over cook. With a watchful eye you can easily tell when they are ready.

I made this for 10 people on Passover. Both the hens and the rosti came out perfectly. I had the time, so I cooked the birds for longer - over an hour I think- at a lower temperature, and basted them every 20 minutes. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was a big hit!

We made this as written for Passover 2008. It was delicious, but a lot of work for 8. Maybe if you have a huge kitchen with a few extra cooks, it would be an OK situation. My husband and I had our hands full putting this dish on the table. We served it with a quinoa dish (yuck, BTW) instead of the rosti. We knew a rosti would be too difficult for a party of 8. The sauce is very good. You will be glad to have something served under the birds to sop it up. I think couscous would be perfect. We browned the birds about 1 hour before serving, then put them in the oven about 30 minutes before serving. This time table was not pefect, the breasts were a little dry. Next time we will work on the timing to get it right.

I made this for my husband and I at Passover this past weekend, and really loved it. However, I read the first review which mentioned that the sauce/spices were somewhat bland etc. So I actually made up the recipe for 8 poussins, but only actually used 2! So I think the recipe is just perfect if you only use 2 poussins (mine were about 1lb/450g each). Really lovely rich spices and plenty of sauce to pour around. I also increased the cumin just a touch, and added perhaps a 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Finally, I halved the sugar in the pomegranate sauce. One cup would make it far too sweet.

I followed the recipe for the poussins exactly. The little birds were perfectly cooked--tender and moist (be sure to really brown them on four sides), and the walnuts, candied by the pomegranate glaze, were terrific. The poussins looked beautiful on the plate (with quartered little yellow potatoes roasted with rosemary and an asparagus and peas dish from this site). The spices, however, didn't come through, except for the turmeric, which gave the dish an odd flavor. I'll make it again, but I'll increase the cumin, cut the turmeric, add other spices (coriander, cinnamon, etc), and possibly throw in haps some fruit--preserved lemons or currants.
