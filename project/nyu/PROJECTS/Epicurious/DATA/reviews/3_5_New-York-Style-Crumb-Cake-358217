I made this on a cold rainy morning, to rave reviews. I had to substitute soured milk (1 cup) + Olivio margerine (1/3 cup) for the sour cream, since that pot in the refrigerater turned out to be ricotta. I also divided the recipe into 2 8.5x3x2.5" loaf pans. Last but not least, I had soaked a cup of raisins in cointreau, and I cut half a cup into the center of each pan before adding the topping. Baked the two pans for 45 minutes. The result was delicious -- a surprisingly tender, delicate crumb. I made this on a cold November morning, and my mother is still raving about it!

Let me start off by saying, I'm a crumb cake fanatic. My husband and I moved to Florida from New York 3 years ago and haven't had crumb cake like the ones we used to get up north. Since our move, I've been trying various recipes (including this one). This one happens to be pretty darn good compared to others on marthastewart.com etc. One of the best New York Style Crumb Cakes my family has been enjoying for years comes from http://www.crumbcakecreations.com! They're a New Jersey based bakery which ships throughout the US. I've yet to find a crumb cake with larger crumbs than these. Plus, they have a ton of varieties aside from the typical crumb cake you'd expect. Carrot, blueberry jam, red velvet, and pumpkin are just a few of the ones I've seen. My favorite happens to be Pumpkin Crumb Cake. Check them out in time for Easter - you wont be disappointed. www.crumbcakecreations.com -Annette

This cake is excellent! I made it in a metal pan and put it in for 45 minutes (as others have recommended). I ran out of sugar, so probably cut out about 1/4-1/3 c in the cake batter. It's moist and delicious! Note for people unfamiliar with this type of batter: It had almost the consistency of cookie dough. I was worried it was too dry, but it turned out beautifully!

This afternoon I made this cake for a family get-together. I am known for my baking and I always like to try something new. This crumb cake was a huge it. Everyone loved it! My in-laws said they could eat just the crumb topping... I baked it for 50 minutes. I agree with the other reviewers that 1 hour would be way too long. An excellent crumb cake!!!

My family and I love this cake. I baked it in a glass 13x9 and it was done in 45 minutes and the topping was perfect.

I made this recipe for Mother's Day. The kids enjoyed it but the adults didn't. Like other reviewers the top was thick but that didn't bother me - the fact that it was overly crunchy did. I agree there are better recipes out there.

My instincts were right-way too much sugar and butter -check out nutrional analysis! Topping overwelmed cake, which was way too rich, even with light sour cream. There are much better and tastier crumb cake recipes around that also include nuts and really are more appropriate- not so heavy and rich, esp. for breakfast.

I think this was one of the best crumb cakes I have ever had. It is high in calories but the problem is you can not stop eating it. Mine did come out a bit darker than the photo but this is a keeper!

great recipe and easy to make, very moist, although next time I would add more cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg also.

Don't know if I made it correctly, but my cake didn't turn out as light in color as the photo. Perhaps I overcooked it or the crumbs sunk. Not sure, but either way, it is still very good. I would have given it four forks, but I feel the calorie content of 668 per serving needs puts it in the three fork category.

The was a fabulous recipe and a keeper! I give it 3 1/2 forks. My family loved it, and it disappeared quickly. The cake freezes beautifully. I dusted it with some confectioner's sugar to "finish it off". Ignore the naysayers about the calories. Go live on carrot sticks and don't make desserts in the first place!

This cake is absolutely outstanding! Just ate the last piece. Looking for an excuse to make it again very soon.

Even though this is a breakfast cake I made it for dessert b/c I love crumb cake at any time and it was good. The crumbs were a little hardish for my liking but other that that it was delicious and everyone liked it. I would make this again but try a different recipe for the crumbs.

Baked this crumb cake for Easter breakfast (and dessert!) as a new treat, and it was delicious. I saw the reviews suggesting cutting back on the topping, but I found that the cake is pretty lonely without equal parts of topping. Eat warm or reheat 10 seconds for a mouth watering treat! This recipe makes a LOT so we sent a bunch home with family. If you're afraid of fat content, perhaps this is not the best recipe for you, but it sure is yummy!!

There are many better recipes out there for similar cakes. Maybe if I had used a larger pan and made the cake thinner it would have been better. It seemed rather dry and tasteless. I agree with others that it was not worth the calories.

Yummy! My 4 kids love the Starbucks coffeecake we get as an occasional treat but I wished I could find a recipe, especially with enough topping. This is it! The next day microwave a piece for 30 sec. - warm and soft. It is a special treat! It came out perfect the first time I made it.

I thought this was delicious! Very moist. It did have a lot of topping- but according to my family that is the best part. It looked very pretty and was a perfect treat with coffee.

As an American living abroad I find myself drawn to a lot of classic recipes from home and when I saw this I had to make it. The topping was perfect, nice and thick and crunchy. I would not reduce the amount of topping as others have mentioned. Unfortunately sour cream is hard to come by in France and I usually substitute creme fraiche, but as a result my cake lacked that sour cream tanginess. Next time I'll try using fromage blanc and see if that works better.

This is a very good cake, but I thought the crumb was just too much. If I make it again I will cut the crumb recipe in half. As one reader said though - way too many calories for me.

This was a big hit with the family. The cake is moist and flavorful and the crumb topping tasty. My cake was done in 53 min. baked at 350F in a metal pan. As my personal preference is for less topping, I gave the recipe only 3 forks.

This cake is rediculous it's so good. I baked it this morning and have eaten four pieces already. Perfect with coffee.
