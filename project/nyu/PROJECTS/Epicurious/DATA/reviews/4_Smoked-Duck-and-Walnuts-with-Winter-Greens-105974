This was wonderful. I made the dressing exactly as written. The supermarket sells freshly grilled duck breast (how lucky is that!). But I used a tangelo instead of pomegranate, added cherry tomatoes, and used arugula instead of frisee (since I don't like frisee, radicchio, or endive). And I added freshly chopped coriander which I think made it pop.

When I want a special salad for a holiday meal or just the two of us.. this is definitely the 1st recipe I go to! It is excellent, with light flavors that complement each other and is an excellent starter to any meal! Had this for Christmas and my mom just wanted to have nothing more than that... she was SOOO impressed! This is definitely a do again!!

A wonderful salad. A meal on its own! Used store bought whole smoked turkey - not the garbage from the deli. Flavours balanced wonderfully - even the pomegranate seeds worked and didn't bother my teeth as they do when eaten alone.

This was excellent. The only change I made was increase the Dijon. I will make this again and again!

Lovely flavour combination! I've also made the salad, and put the duck on a bed of warm green (puy) lentils. This seems to release the flavours of the duck even better.

Delicious and easy to make. I added the following ingredients to the salad dressing: 1 tablespoon of Hoisin sauce; 1 tblsp of Sesame seed oil; 1 teaspoon of liquid honey. Since making this salad, I have had numerous requests for the recipe. It is very popular.

When you're seeking out frisee (someone below mentioned not being able to find it), keep in mind that it might be called "curly endive" or "chickory" instead of frisee!

This was my first time using smoked duck. I thought the salad was very good. I especially thought that the dressing was excellent! For what it is worth, I used tangerines and will definitly make the dressing again and again. Give it a try you won't be disappointed!

This was fabulous!! I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I used the smoked turkey and thought it was great. Also, I was pinched for time so I used mixed greens. Have already made it twice in one week.

Delicious! The flavors of the dressing, paired with the smoked duck and tangerines, make this salad exciting. We smoked the duck ourselves so it was fresh and still warm. Purchased baby gourmet greens and omitted the pomegranate seeds. Will definitely prepare again!

Very Good!!! Spent two very frustrating days trying to locate frisee. Finally gave up. Used a little bit more of everything else.

Everyone loved this receipe. I was lucky enough to have my own smoked duck. I served this at both Dinners, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day and did not get enough for myself.

I havee to stop ever now and then and look around, take stock in all that we are blessed with. For me, in Sonoma County, I can walk to a supermarket and purchase fresh duck. Drink a GREAT bottle of wine. It's almost too unfair. and after a spa. I agree with all, this is thee salad for a grand event. A close runner up is the Endive, Arugula and Orange Salad (also contained on this most excellant site) For ALL to enjoy. Stefano

Made this salad for a large group on New Years Eve. We used smoked turkey because we didn't have time to look for smoked duck. We also used red and green leaf lettuce along with a gourmet greens mix. This is an excellent salad that we will serve again.

We did the whole English Menu for 17 people for Christmas dinner, and the salad was a smash hit among the salad lovers (majority) in our family. Everything was done in advance except the lettuce and the salad monsters put it together in no time. The pomegrantes were a nice addition. Very difficult to find smoked duck breast but it was worth the effort. Try game specialty outlets, retail or wholesale. I asked a chef at a local restaurant where he would buy something like that, and he obliged me with a distributor. The rest of the meal was merely very good.
