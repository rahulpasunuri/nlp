Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious, a really different blend of flavors; my husband raved. It's a keeper.

Yum! This is one of my very favorite recipes. It's quick and easy and yet so delicious. It's a restaurant-quality go-to meal for impressing dinner guests, but it's simple enough for a weeknight meal. If you don't have white balsamic, regular balsamic vinegar is a fine substitute.

Excellent! Substituted Puget Sound salmon (with skin) for arctic char, and used broccoli in place of broccolini. The broccoli soaks up the juices from the olives, orange peel, and vinegar, making this otherwise plain vegetable a treat for your mouth.

2nd review a few months later...sprayed pan with olive oil cooking spray before putting in broccolini and just removed pan from heat after adding garlic, olives and orange zest. Grilled fish on my pannini press, again no oil needed. Faster and healthier. Loved it

Easy, tasty, and attractive on the plate...bought some char which I never use and came home to find a recipe. Had everything called for and voila...an ear of summer corn looked lovely on the plate and gave me my starch. A glass of white wine complimented the fish. Perfect dinner on a summer night.

First review. Thought this recipe was fantastic. Picked it out because I love Arctic Char. Recipe was VERY easy and very quick (15 minutes). Make a little extra of the tapenade/salsa. It's good on a lot of stuff. I could do with or without the brocollini -- asparagus or brussel sprouts make for a good green on the side.

Very easy and absolutely delicious. Orange peel slivers give it a refreshing taste. Kids even liked it. Can't wait to make it again!

very nice, hubby and 5 y.o. daughter loved it. Made it just as written except that I didn't have white balsamic vinegar so I used champagne citrus vinegar, which worked very well. As a high-altitude adjustment (we're at 5000 ft), I cooked the fish for slightly shorter time but otherwise the cooking times were spot-on.
