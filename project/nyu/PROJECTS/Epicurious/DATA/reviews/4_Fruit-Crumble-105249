Only thing I found didn't exactly work - the temp was a bit high, so I had to reduce it after 10 minutes to let the fruit cook a bit more and avoid the crumble going black.

Absolutely lovely! Added some nutmeg and a few amaretti to the crumble mixture (and reduced the sugar a bit), it came out so good I couldn't wait for it to get cooler, I ate it hot :) Definitely a keeper recipe!

Made this last night with peaches, overly rippened nectarines and plums. Added some strawberries too, used chopped pecans because that was what I had....DELISH!!!!!!

I've been making this crumble ever since it appeared in the paper issue of Gourmet!! A favorite with ANY type of fruit -- recent best bet is fresh blackberries with peaches. Added about two tbsps of sugar to berries, mixed with peach slices and tablespoon of flour prior to putting in dish. Perfect. Crumble itself is open to variation for tastes -- different nut choice, spices, etc. A great calorie-conscious dessert -- perfect with cool whip light! :)

Excellent and easy. Not all crumble-type desserts come out as tasty as this one. I modified a bit according to other ideas - added cinnamon and oats to the crumble. Substituted 1/2 of the white flour for oats and processed them to be smaller bits. Used about 1/8 cup less sugar. Added 3/4 T corn starch to the fruit to thicken the syrup. I also cut the peaches a bit smaller. Maybe into 8 slices per peach. Delicious!

OMG! Such a wonderful celebration of fresh, plump, juicy white peaches! I purchased them today at the farm stand and they were perfectly ripe. I found this recipe and wanted to make it for it's simplicity. I used oat flour and 1/4 cup LESS sugar. My almonds were quite coarse but I wanted the finished product to be rustic, with lovely textures. AND IT WAS SUPERB! I ate it while warm, by itself. I also sprinkled some fresh ground nutmeg (just a touch!) on the crumble before baking. Just a wonderful dessert. Can't wait to make it again and experiment with other fruits.

oh my...so good!used fresh mangoes and peaches and threw in some frozen blueberries. (would be great with any fruit.)Tossed the fruit with a little cornstarch then sprinkled with cinnamon before adding topping. Also used 1/3 cup almond meal in place of sliced almonds as one reviewer suggested. then just cut butter in with fork. so easy! so good! it was devoured! can't wait to try different fruit combinations...my new "go to" recipe for easy yummy dessert!

Made this is on a hot summer's day without air conditioning, but this recipe was well worth the heat in the kitchen. I substituted oats for the almonds and added a splash of pear liqueur to the fruit. Baked it in a cast iron pan, and it was the prettiest and tastiest dessert for a party.

Stupid easy, and very good with early (tartish) peaches or cherries, balanced by the sweetness of the topping and ice cream. If you're lucky enough to have a Trader Joe's nearby, they have an amazing almond meal for about $5 lb -- simply dump a 1/4 - 1/3 c instead of sliced almonds into the dry ingredients, mix lightly and put the cold butter in right away. Oh YEAH!

Really great and VERY easy recipe. I love it and my guests have raved!! I have used frozen berries both times I made it and have also thrown in mango. It comes out deliciously every time. I took one cook's suggestion and added some corn starch the first time I made this dish and thought it was a great idea. It is also very nice without the thickener!

This is the recipe for you if you want to highlight the fruit and you want to make something incredibly quick and easy with ingredients you always have on hand (except the fruit of course). I used peaches fresh from a southwest Colorado ranch. They were huge, juicy and wonderful. Again, I believe this dessert will only be as good as the fruit.

One of my favorite recipes...I make no adjustments, follow to the letter except for substituting whatever fruit is in season...delicious.

Rating: 3
I used a combination of all fruits and exceeded the amounts so that the pie plate was well filled. I also sprinkled a little cinnamon and a tsp of flour on top of the fruit before layering with the crumble. Other than that, I followed the directions exactly. Very easy and and a much enjoyed dessert. French vanilla ice cream is a must.

Rating: 3
I doubled the fruit using large juicy peaches (peeled) and blackberries. Used 1/2 organic cane and 1/2 organic brown sugar and added a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon to the topping. Skip the food processor, this is so easy to crumble by hand and it adds to the sheer pleasure and simplicity of the dish. Served it with McConnell's vanilla bean ice cream to raves.

I didn't think something this easy could be this delicious, but it was. I needed a dessert very quickly, and pulled out all of my frozen fruit out of fridge: 16 oz strawberries, bag and half of mixed berries, and bag of blueberries, along with 3/4 T cornstarch. I have never used frozen fruit before in a crumble but just ran it under water till it defrosted. I am telling you, it was devoured by everyone. I will be making this again and again, with different fruit combinations. And I won't hesitate again to use frozen fruit.

My fruit wasn't very flavorful but I think this is a good recipe. It did come out rather soupy and I would be inclinced to toss the fruit with a bit of cornstarch next time.

This was EASY and delicious! I used a combination of peaches, nectarines and plums. I think double the fruit would be even better as the fruit shrinks down during the baking process.

This is an easy and delicious dish. I used peaches and blackberries. Yumm. However it should eaten the day it is made or it get's soggy.

great basic recipe to adapt for whatever's in season. i also added 1/2 cup rolled oats and some extra butter to the crumble. also, my peaches weren't overly ripe so i mixed together 1 oz ammaretto with some cinnamon, dried orange peel, and a sprinkle of nutmeg and then poured that over the peaches. this required extra baking time but produced juicy and flavorful fruit. this was a crowd pleaser.

This was very good. I tried to go light on the butter, and I regret it--I think it probably needs the full amount. The result was a bit more crumbly than I'd have liked. But the flavors combine wonderfully, and I'd definitley make again.

This is so easy and delicious! I use frozen fruit from the grocery store. I can make the topping ahead of time and freeze it. I particularly like to bring it on sailing trips where I can just throw it together at the last minute and people think I'm some kind of wonderful cook. The jokes on them!

This is a fantastic recipe--a great one to whip up on little to no notice. This is really great for picnics--no effort and everyone always loves it. Easy to scale down for just one or two. I love to make this with granny smith apples and frozen mixed berries (raspberries, blackberries and blueberries), and it is also great with just peaches.

Rating: 3
Very nice. The almonds were a nice touch. I also added half a cup rolled oats. To the reviewer on a health kick, skip the Splenda, that stuff will make you grow a third arm.

Rating: 3
Hesitated on giving the recipe a fork rating since I modified it so much. My family is on a health kick so I substituted whole wheat flour and splenda, halved the butter, and added some oats, cinnamon, and honey to the topping. Let's just put it like this, there's nothing like the real thing. The "healthy" version was good but not a company dish. A little more tweaking needed...

This was incredibly easy and there wasn't any leftovers. I used 2 bags of frozen cherries and added 1/2 sugar to the cherries. Otherwise I followed the recipe for the topping and it was great. Serve with ice cream!

this recipe is amazing! it was so easy to make. I am 10 years old and i made it perfectly. not only that but it has a delicios creamy crunchy butter flavor. i made it with 2 apples and 1 peach and it was terrific

You can't go wrong with this one, and I've tried! I've used everything from fresh to frozen fruit - different nuts-premaking and baking later - and this recipe stands up to everything. When using frozen fruit - let fruit thaw in colandar - bring to room temp. For my husband's birthday party I made it with sliced apples and pecans with vanilla ice-cream-and it was wonderful (again!).This will be in our family for a long time.

This recipe is simple and delicious. I made this crumble layering 3 nectarines on bottom, 5-6 plums, then a large peach on top. I only peeled the peach, and you wouldn't know it. I used walnuts rather than almonds. It was delicious. A simple, unusual combination with fabulous results. I would give it a 4, as the recipe is not "a dish beyond compare"...but it's excellent.

This is great! I only gave it a 3 because I changed it a little. Only had 3 peaches on hand, so I topped it with frozen raspberries and blueberries. Only walnuts instead of almonds, so I added about a capful of almond extract. This was terrific; my boyfriend ate most of it in one day!

Absolutely lovely. Recommend peeling the fruit before use though. I used only peaches and rasberries. A fabulous way to use up extra fruit or to prepare dessert on short notice.

This recipe is very easy and tastes great. It worked with 2 large peaches and 2 small white nectarines. A couple of variations I tried that worked well: substitute 1/4 cup of the flour with cornmeal, substitute pecans and walnuts for the almonds (and add a little almond extract), and finally, add a dash of cognac and sprinkle sugar on the fruit before covering in crumble.

PERFECTION. Easy, quick, absolutely wonderful. Made this with peaches and blueberries (mixed) and it was divine. Smells amazing while baking. Got rave reviews from very discriminating fruit cobbler/crisp/crumble lovers.

We made this exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out to be the best crumble I've ever made or tasted! So easy to do and so delicious. We used about 5 large native peaches and served the crumble with a scoop of Haagen Daaz vanilla icecream. Timing was spot on too. A real keeper.

This dessert was ready for the oven before it was finished preheating. It couldn't have been easier. I used plums and a handful of blueberries, and I mixed in about 1 Tbsp. of flour and 2 Tbsp. of sugar and a dash of cinnamon to the fruit to thicken the juices. A wonderful spur-of-the-moment dessert. Real comfort food. I'm eager to try it with other seasonal fruits.

Made this with mostly nectarines - will add blueberries next time, but it was very good, and certainly easy. I substituted part brown sugar and believe it made a positive difference.

Easy and delicious. I decided to make this 10 minutes before dinner, and didn't have any almonds, so I used granola instead. It was a great substitution, lending the crumble a hearty, healthy crunch.

This was delicious and very easy. Used a blend of white and yellow peaches. I also baked it longer than specified--covered it with foil when the top was brown but the peaches still too firm. Highly recommended!

For the two of us, I made just one-third of the recipe, using two "Jersey" peaches. My husband called it "heavenly". What more can you say?

As other reviews state, this recipe is a "keeper" just as it is. I doubled the amount of fruit called for in the recipe, but from experience, decided not to increase the other ingredients - the result was perfect for our taste; our guests loved it too!

I used 4 nectarines and 3 plums in this crumble, and it was excellent! It was very easy because the fruit skins didn't need to be peeled. I did sprinkle a few teaspoons of flour and brown sugar on top of the fruit before adding the crumble topping. Served it with vanilla bean ice cream, and my in-laws who were visiting gave the dessert rave reviews!

I used nectarines and raspberries, which added color and "punch." I also sprinkled extra slivered almonds on top before baking. The flavor was delicious and buttery, but there was a little too much liquid at the bottom of the dish. Will definitely make again, maybe adding more flour to the fruit.

Rating: 3
Wonderful and easy. Followed the recommendation for 2 peaches, 2 plums, 2 nectarines - just the right combination. You get more almond flavor if they aren't overly ground. Would consider adding a bit of almond extract next time.

It was great! I used two peaches, two nectarines and two plums. I pitted them and cut the fruit into 1/2 inch to 1 inch chunks, skin and all. I have actually never baked a fruit dessert and left the skin on before, but it was fine and SOOO easy! If you have the fruit and need to use it this is worth making, it took no time at all and the results were Yummy!
