Used this base for white, yellow, and red pearl onions. Very tasty and decadent addition to the holiday table.

Extraordinary results for very little effort. Port and madeira work equally well. I like it best with less honey and a little balsamic vinegar for balance.

Wow! This is one of the best gourmet combinations I've ever tasted and a new staple for dinner parties to come. And it's so easy - just throw it all in the pot and continue doing other dishes.

I made this for Xmas lunch as a side dish for port and garlic duck. It was stunning - however I had substituted the madeira for port. I made it a few hours ahead of time and gently reheated - absolutely scrum.

WOW! I'm the 1st?? This was a little time consuming, but if started it before the rest of the dinner, it works well. It was VERY intense in its delectable flavor though, and as such I would not let it stand alone. As a flavor spike topper to bland dish IT WAS SUPERB! The file says it is OK to rewarm, which may be OK. But as it was quite sticky, it may be problematic the second day. I might even try to freeze some of this as a microwaveable quick fix to a boring dish.
