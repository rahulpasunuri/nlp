I made these pancakes with IMO sour cream substitute, rice milk and Smart Balance for the non-dairy person. They turned out great! Definitely a keeper.

Made for a sleepover birthday party for a group of 12 year olds. They all loved the pancakes! I used greek 0% plain yogurt in lieu of sour cream and added some vanilla. I added blueberries to the last 1/2 of the batch. Deilish. Will make again!

Excellent pancake recipe. I substituted organic vanilla yogurt for the sour cream and added a little more flour- about 1/8 cup. I also cut the salt down to 1/4 tsp. because salt isn't good for you! They were fluffy and delicious. I cooked them in a little coconut oil and added some chocolate chips for my son. Extremely fluffy and love the low sugar taste when plain. Next time, I might substitute melted coconut oil instead for the butter. I topped the stack with pure maple syrup. Yummm.

This was a great recipe. It allowed me to use up leftover sour cream and was a great pancake. I didn't make the syrup (not enough sour cream).

These were so yummy! I used whole wheat flour and added blueberries. I also didn't bother with the syrup because I had some pure maple syrup. Delicious!!

Delicious, and truly quick and easy. Visually, my batter looked too thick, so I added about another quarter cup of milk, and the consistency came out as it appears in the photo.

Meh. Not tangy enough for my taste. I was hoping it would be a good substitute for buttermilk pancakes, but it wasn't. Not worth the printer ink.

These are by far the best pancakes ever. My kids prefer their pancakes very thin, so I actually double the milk and they come out just how the kids like them. Perfect flavor and everyone is happy :-)

Delicious and easy. However the pancake serving is quite modest (we're 2 adults & one small child, and it was just right for us), and the syrup proportions made a lot more than we felt we needed to use. I made about 2/3 of that quantity and we still had plenty left over.

These were super easy to make and extremely yummy! II didn't modify the recipe, but I used regular maple syrup on top (didn't need to put butter on them, either). So good! And a nice, modest sized recipe, too.

Great basic pancake recipe. I tried it because I didn't have any buttermilk (and almost never do) but I do always have sour cream. I just use plain maple syrup rather than making the sour cream syrup.

This is my go-to pancake recipe since I always have sour cream or yogurt in the house. Easy to whip up even on a school morning!

Great recipe! Loved the sour cream maple syrup. So fluffy and amazing and I also added finely ground oatmeal instead of all flour and it turned out perfect still. Thanks! http://tastynchic.com

This recipe yields an absolutely delicious version of the standard pancake. I've given it only three forks because I didn't find it to be revelatory, and when I am eating this much fat before 9 am it has to be good enough to make me feel good all day. I've also had good results swapping out 1/2 the flour for cornmeal and cutting most of the butter. It gives them a taste and texture I like.

Made these this morning with 0% Greek yogurt because I had no sour cream. No other change. My husband and I agreed these were the best pancakes we have ever had. I didn't bother with the syrup but will try it next time (with yogurt). This resolves my issue with buying a quart of buttermilk for one Sunday pancake feast and having the rest spoil in the fridge.

Very good and simple pancake - light and fluffy, great flavor. I had a little less sour cream than called for, so I supplemented with greek yogurt. Batter was thick, but I didn't thin it out.

This is a really good pancake recipe. I did alter a couple of things though on my first try! I doubled the recipe's basic ingredients without any proportion issues. I did add a bit more milk to make the batter more runny. And I added a mashed banana to the liquid ingredients and a touch of lemon juice to give things a bit more tang since I like that. The pancakes came out really well and were thoroughly enjoyed!

This recipe is great. Pancakes were light and fluffy the way I like them, but still had nice texture. Excellent!

This was super yummy. I would recommend the syrup as well. My only issue is that it did only make 7 and I only used 1/4 cup each. Next time I'll just double the recipe. Mmmmm.

I made these because I couldn't find my go-to pancake recipe. After tasting them, I've stopped searching for the other one. These are fantastic! I didn't make the syrup (seemed like a waste of time since my family LOVES plain old maple syrup), and I followed the recipe almost to the letter (although I used skim milk and fat-free sour cream, because that's just what we use in my home. Also, I sifted the dry ingredients together). It made eight pancakes, and with a side of fruit, was just enough for two adults and a preschooler. The batter is super thick, but do not thin it out! I used my measuring cup to spread the batter out a little bit on the griddle, which helped it cook evenly. Other than that, it was just like cooking any other pancake. They came out nice and fluffy, with a sweet and tangy flavor. Don't be deterred by the issues other reviewers had, because they are easily remedied! Make these pancakes, I'm sure you won't regret it!

Amazing!!! Loved them, I had to use plain yogurt instead but they were very tasty. Will keep this recipe, my 3 year old girl loved them as well. Can't wait to try to use the non fat greek yogurt.

I usually go for more "healthy" pancake recipes, but am trying to clean out the fridge (which unusually contained whole milk, butter, and creme fraiche). I made these exactly as directed except for using creme fraiche instead of sour cream. I cannot imagine a more delicious pancake. I didn't make the syrup because I didn't have enough sour cream/creme fraiche. I imagine it would be divine, but they were truly wonderful even with my low-sugar syrup (Joseph's, from Whole Foods). Fluffy and tender like the best diner pancakes, but better. This will be the pancake recipe I always use for guests. (Otherwise I would gain 30 pounds!)

Absolutely delicious! Wonderfully light and fluffy with great flavor. I used buttermilk instead of milk, which I think made it even lighter.

Tender and delicious. Even with: 1% milk, sour cream cut with nonfat yogurt, white flour cut with whole wheat. We didn't even need the syrup (though it is a special treat)!

This is fantastic made just as the recipe says. I used Daisy Light Sour Cream with great results. SUPER YUM. Best pancakes this southern home cookin' girl has ever tasted hands down. Seriously.

These were great! Modified as follows: used half Greek Yogurt/half lite sour cream, used 1% milk, used whole egg even though making only half of the recipe,used clarified butter in the pancakes as well as to brush the skillet and finally added fresh blueberries to the pancakes as they were cooking. Served with plain maple syrup and did not make the sour cream one. They were extremely tender, had a hint of a tang to them and much prefer to our old standbys that are either from Betty Crocker Cookbook or the like. Half of the recipe made 5 generous pancakes.

We loved these and didn't change a thing. Used my electric griddle so that I was able to cook all of them at once. For me the recipe made about 9, which two of us ate up without a problem. For first-time users I suggest making the recipe as is before making any changes.

These were good -- a nice change from my regular recipe (Hannah's pancakes on this site). I had a little sourcream left over (not enough for the syrup). While thick, I found that if you turn down the flame a notch, they don't burn while cooking. Very fluffy and tasty. Had to substitute 2 tbsp plain yogurt for the sourcream because I ran out and it didn't seem to make a difference on the taste. Maybe if you think too thick, add some yogurt. . . .

I am eating the pancakes as I write this, they are phenomenal!! definitely a keeper

These were just ok. I was looking for an easy pancake recipe, and did not make the syrup. I found the batter much too thick, it "glopped" instead of spreading, and by the time it was cooked, the outside was too dark. My husband thought they looked horrible, but luckily they did taste better than they looked. I don't know if maybe subbing 1% milk for whole milk ruined them but I'd say they were "meh".

I just made the Pancakes without the Syrup as we love plain Maple Syruo. The Pancake recipe is the best I ever made. Thank you for sharing.

Unlike everybody else, my dough was fine,but like many of you did not like the syrup. I have better syrup recipes that I would use in the future. The syrup knocked it down a fork! Do love the lightness of the pancake and now prefer it to other recipes.

Rating: 3
The batter will be thick. Resist the temptation to thin it, as the pancakes will come out thin and rubbery instead of thick and puffy (I made this mistake half way through). The topping can be halved unless you like your drowning in butter and maple syrup. I probably won't come back to this one unless I have leftover sour cream again.

I added a tbsp of cocoa powder to the mix. In the end, the batter was very thick so added a 1/4 cup more milk - still thick though. I had to thin it out on the pan a bit to prevent burning. Overall, the flavour was unremarkable. They were fluffy though. I didn't make the syrup. Perhaps in better hands...

Pancakes were awesome. We made them for dinner celebrating Shrove Tuesday (Fat Tuesday). Syrup OK but we made Bananas Foster to top the pancakes!

Wish I felt like everyone else here. I'm a pancake afficianado.......STILL searching in vain for that perfect pancake. These were ok - not great. The batter was way to thick, making the pancakes much too puffy for my liking...I could certainly see where one reviewer had problems with cooking them thru. Also, a pancake should be great to begin with, without having to make a special syrup for it. Nothing can come close to the flavor I'm looking for....pancakes we used to have in the cafeteria at the hospital I worked at. They were so good, you didn't even need syrup. King Arthur Flour has a recipe for "Simply Perfect Pancakes" and says it's the malted milk powder that restaurants/diners use that produces that wonderful taste.....going forward I'm trying their recipe to see if that's the elusive ingredient. These lacked that pancake deliciousness I was hoping to find.

Made for the first time about 6 months ago. The most delicious pancakes I have ever had. Highly recommend them.

These were great: quick and delicious. The texture of the pancakes was wonderful and we loved the Sour-Cream Maple Syrup. My 2-year old wolfed down her pancake and kept asking for more syrup! The only change I made was using light sour cream.

This recipe was good. In fact I would go as far as to say that I was surprised with how good it was. However, I would not say that this recipe rocked my world. The pancakes were wonderful on their own, as many have already stated. The syrup was, er, different. When hot it had a great creamy texture that definitely showcased the sour-maple goodness. But once the syrup cooled it started to congeal in a really unflattering way (an earlier reviewer's yogurt substitution makes sense now). As is, the recipe provided a welcomed change to my pancakes, however I doubt I'll make the syrup next time.

I also used fat-free Greek Yogurt instead of sour cream.

This is my new go-to pancakes recipe! I substituted brown rice syrup for the sugar and added it to the wet ingredients, as well as adding vanilla. They were very fluffy and light! I didn't try the syrup but the pancakes are good for a standard, I'd imagine great for add-ins too! Yum!

I did not make the sauce/syrup, but have made the pancakes twice. Once, I followed the recipe exactly, using sour cream and milk. Very tasty. Once, I substituted soy milk and Greek yogurt, because that's what I had. These pancakes were slightly tough, I think because I could have used a little more liquid to thin the batter out, but the taste was stupendous.

Best pancakes ever! We make this whole recipe for the two of us. Too yummy for words! Be sure to make the sauce. It is worth the extra effort.

Such light, airy pancakes with such little effort! I have other recipes that involve whipping egg whites for light, fluffy pancakes but this one is easier and tastier! I also used regular maple syrup so the pancakes are four forks whether the syrup is used or not. Delicious! I will absolutely make these pancakes again.

Absolutely THE BEST pancakes we've ever had! They're flavourful, moist, light and melt in your mouth. I followed the recipe for the pancakes exactly, but chose to use plain maple syrup. As my two boys say, these are the best pancakes EVER! I threw out all of my old pancake recipes as soon as I finished eating the first batch of these...You will too!

I made these with plain yogurt from goat's milk instead of sour cream and with gluten-free baking mix. Very delicious! Only thing I would do differently is leave the yogurt out of the syrup.

Easy and delicious! Great texture, slightly caramelized crispy bits on the edges. The only thing I'd change is the sauce... I would use a bit less butter and a bit more maple. Will make again next weekend.

Yes, these totally rock! I will DEFINITELY make them again. My only problem was not with the recipe but the execution. The pancakes are so thick I had trouble getting them cooked all the way through without getting too dark on the outside. I'll pay closer attention to what I'm doing next time.
