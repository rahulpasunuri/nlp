I tripled the parsley to make this more of a tabbouleh salad, but kept everything else the same. I'll do that again when available. But next time I'll cut the salt by 1/3. Tip, rinsing the lentils under cool water after cooking will keep other elements crisp. I enjoyed this recipe's flavor balance.

This is really good for such a healthy dish. I made a large batch to take for lunches and so added the tomatoes each day when ready to eat it. I thought it improved by the second day. I will definitely make again

The flavors were great for such an easy meal. I didn't have carrots so I just threw in an extra pepper. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make it again when I find myself with extra bell peppers on hand.

This is really a 2+ to 3 recipe. Low fat, flavorful, fresh. It is indeed a good idea to let the cools before adding everything. Also you should salt the lentil cooking water or use broth (or salt and pepper the lentils after they cool, before adding everything else). No doubt you can add and subtract based on what you have on hand but the sweetness of yellow and red bell pepper, carrot and yellow tomatoes plays well off of the feta and kalamatas. Great picnic or potluck dish. If you have leftovers, add to rice for a more complete meal.

I didn't have a tomato or a red pepper and it still turned out just right. I would add just a little more salt. The carrots added just the right amount of crunch.

Excellent and simple recipe. If you love lentils or are trying to add them to your diet, this is must try recipe. The fact that it's simple and you can really add anything to this and still have it come out delicious is a no brainer. I basically went through my fridge and pulled out what I had available and found that only really omitted the red peppers, kalamata olives, and parsley. I did, however, add instead to substitute those items, 1-jalapeño and 4-basil leaves. Wow, the jalapeños added a nice 'hot' kick to this recipe and the basil added that extra touch to smooth and pull all the flavors together. One thing I would suggest is to let the lentils cool to room temperature first before adding them to the rest of the ingredients. Adding the lentils straight from the pot to the bowl sort of 'cooked' some of my other vegetables which I didn't care for that since I like the crunch effect of my veggies when I eat them raw. Enjoy!

we *loved* this dish. Easy, flavorful, healthy; what's better than that? Make sure you keep an eye on the lentils as previously mentioned. We put the whole thing on chopped green leaf lettuce which added another texture which we both loved. We didn't have fresh parsley, so we added dried to the dressing instead. it's always better to use fresh, but this worked in a pinch. Will definitely have this again!

I did a few substitutes, based on what I had in my fridge; no tomatoes, scallions for the red onion, and subbed a green pepper for the yellow. Also used 3 Tb cider vinegar. As I cooked the lentils in broth, I adjusted the salt and pepper to taste. The flavors are fresh and light and the salad looks beautiful with the various colors. it would proabably feed 4 as a main dish; I'm taking it to a potluck and think it should easily serve 6-8 as a side. A caution tho: watch the lentils carefully when cookiing and take them off the heat when slightly al dente...lentils overcook quickly and turn into soup! You want the lentils to retain their shape.
