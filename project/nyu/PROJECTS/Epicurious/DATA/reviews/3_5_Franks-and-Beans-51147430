Coudn't help myself, had to add diced tomatoes. Served on toasted rustic sourdough bread and topped with parmesan. What a great lunch!

Just want to add: As the recipe says, this is just as tasty (perhaps even better) the next day. Just pulled the small amount I had leftover from last night's dinner with friends, tasted it cold straight from the fridge, and it was delicious.

Made exactly as written (except I doubled the recipe), and the only problem I had was that the wine didn't really reduce and, later, the liquid didn't really thicken as much as I thought it should. Perhaps this was because I doubled the recipe? Regardless, it tasted WONDERFUL and everyone in my weekly dinner gathering also thought it was great. The long simmer with the fresh herbs certainly makes the dish. The sliced sausage at the end isn't really necessary, because there is so much sausage in with the beans already. TASTY TASTY TASTY!!! Yummy peasant food dish!!

I used less sausage than suggested (only one 12 oz pkg) and just cooked it all with the beans (I have a baby and not so much time for cooking). The recipe would've been awesome if I heard the timer go off (baby again) when it was all done. Since I didn't, the liquid all cooked out and the beans ended up a kind of pureed mass. That having been said, it was still delicious and comforting on a snowy day.
