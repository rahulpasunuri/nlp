Delicious, but very time-consuming, and very high in fat. Won't make again, but sure did enjoy it.

High marks for this homey dish. What eating in a local down home backwaters Louisiana hash house must taste like. The dish was hot, but not too hot, and the sausage adds a great smokiness to the slight gamey-ness of the duck. This is a duck dish even for people who think they don't like duck. Would be equally delicious prepared with chiken thighs or shrimp. Add this one to your good ol' standy list.

I'm a professional chef who has been snitchin' recipes off of Epicurious for years and although I've gotten some great ones, I beleive that this is one of the first I've rated. This was seriously good eating, but the recipe as written is somewhat flawed. First of all, put the duck breasts in a saucepan to cook with the chicken broth. When the duck is cooked, remove the skin and shred as written, but make sure you degrease the remaining stock before you cook in it -- I love duck fat, but too much of it is just a greasy mess. I also found it much easier to start the sausage, veggies, etc., in a large heavy bottomed pot so that you don't have to go transferring all that stuff, just add the duck and degreased stock to it. I'm pretty sure that I added more stock and a little more rice than the recipe called for. I just did what looked right. Forgot the habanero, but the purloo had great flavor anyway -- rave reviews from the customers at my restaurant.

My dish seemed dry, although extremely tastey. I have never had Duck Purloo before this experience so I do not know how it is to be prepared. It would have been helpful to have the finished dish described in terms of texture or have a photo of it completed.
