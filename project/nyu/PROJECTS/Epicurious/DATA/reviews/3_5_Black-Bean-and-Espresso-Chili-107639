I made this for a group of 4 on "Go Texan Day", and of course there was so much leftover. I took the rest to work the next day, and it fed at least 8 or so more people there! Everyone loved it. A few tweaks: I only used 3 onions, and 4 cans of black beans. I added 2 large sweet potatoes, cubed, to make it a little more interesting, and a bag of vegetarian "beef" crumbles for texture. When it came to the chipotle chili powder I bought some of the dried chipotle peppers from the Mexican food section. I put 3 in my food processer and added them instead of the 1/4 teaspoon of chipotle powder. The espresso powder I used was from Starbucks Via instant coffee, it was what I had on hand. Also, used agave nectar instead of honey just because that's what I had available. The flavor was so rich, and smoky. I served with traditional fritos & rice, and with all of the toppings mentioned here. I will definitely be making this again!

Great simple chili recipe...loved the rich taste that the coffee and cinnamon added! (I used instant coffee because I couldn't find espresso powder on short notice) I added two onions and one extra 28oz can of tomatoes to feed 18 people. Everyone seemed to enjoy it, especially with the chocolate and cilantro.

1st off - what army is this meant to feed? Definitely consider trimming back unless you have a big group/family. 2nd - if you're looking for a big, bold chili, this ain't it. That being said, this is a great starting point, fun flavors to play with. Added some meat and kicked up the spice a bit and it turned out very nice.

This chili is amazing! I halved the recipe because I didn't have that many people to feed, used coffee granules instead of espresso powder (because that's what I had in the pantry), and used only one large onion. Great depth of flavor!

Okay, I thought it was bad, but not enough that I felt the need to post my humble review a ga-zillion times! (See below!) Don't know how that happened, so my sincere apology to all the future readers trying to decide whether or not to try it!

Rating: 1
Unfortunately, this was a total disappointment. If I could give it less than 1 fork I would. I halved the recipe, using only 1 tablespoon espresso powder, 2 cans beans, 2 onions and half beer, half water. The end result had a terrible bitter flavor, despite reducing the espresso powder. It only took one bite for the hubby, and we both agreed we wouldn't be eating more, so down the drain it went. It doesn't even come close (IMHO) to another chili recipe I tried on this site recently which is the Chicken Cashew Chili (Gourmet 1997). Now that was an excellent chili and one I'll stick to from now on.

I LOVED this chili. The yield was huge, I should have paid more attention to how much it would make. At one point, I wasn't sure if my soup pot would hold it all! However, I'm glad I have so much, the leftovers are even better than the first serving. The change I would make is that it is a tad over-spiced.... But still delicious. Will definitely make again. Perfect fall/winter food!

Rating: 4
I have made this several times. Sometimes with the polenta. Sometimes with cornbread and salad. It pleases all my friends meat eaters and vegetarians alike. A great dish for fall and winter. I'm not sure why Nimlet from Oakland didn't like it. Perhaps it was the quality of the ingredients that was used. It's a dish you can make strictly according to the directions or augment it quite a bit and it still is fabulous!! I'm making it for dinner again tonight.

I wish I could give this zero forks... after reading all the rave reviews I made this for a party, following the recipe exactly. It was really embarassing - people politely ate it, but it was AWFUL. The first highly-rated Epicurious recipe I've ever made that was disasterous. :(

This was fantastic. Unlike most other reviewers, I followed the recipe exactly. I wouldn't recommend making any changes at all. For those who were wondering about the yield, I'd say it would serve 8-10.

Simple but delicious! I didn't even use chipotle in mine, but the chili had a depth of flavor that I've never before achieved in a vegetarian chili. I used leftover coffee instead of espresso and then decreased the amount of water.

This chili has great flavor and is so hearty for being vegetarian. The many toppings made it a fun dish on our buffet line at our party-- people could customize it as they wished to make it sweet, spicy, creamy, etc. The guests raved and I will definitely make it again.

I just made this chili and is absolutely wonderful. Here is a helpful hint-- make sure the espresso is finely ground. I used coarsely ground espresso and I wish it was finer to blend better with the other ingredients when it hits your palette. This is a full flavored recipe and a great variation from chili recipes we often stumble upon.

I totally went on my own for this but used this recipe as my starting point. I love the expresso and suggested cocoa! It's like a faux mole, a fauxmole. I made the basic chili from here and added boneless chicken and threw in some macaroni for a meal. I loved it.

Rating: 4
This chili had wonderfully complex flavors and was mighty tasty. I don't feel the need to make a meat chili again! I followed people's instructions and used only 4 onions and 4 cans of black beans, and halved the rest of the ingredients. I also added about 1/8 cup good cocoa powder and didn't have espresso on hand so I used some coffee. A few things to note: 1) the coffee made the chili highly caffeinated! I would use decaf next time. 2) I threw in some sliced jalapenos, which gave it some heat, but may not be for everyone. 3) You should taste and adjust the seasonings toward the end. A great recipe!

My 10-year-old daughter and I made this from what we had on hand in the kitchen during a blizzard. We both loved it. We had no onions and no oregano, and we used leftover AM coffee rather than espresso powder. It was still delicious, especially with a bit of chocolate on top.

Really great chili- have made many times!

Rating: 4
I thought this was delicious, so different and tasty with some adjustments for personal taste. I used many of the suggestions other cooks offered in their reviews, like far less honey (only about a tablespoon), only 3 onions, and dried ancho and new mexico chili peppers instead of chili powder (rehydrated and blended in small blender with some of the water used to rehydrate, them then tossed into the chili with the tomatos). I loved the flavor that the espresso and chocolate shavings added, it really compliments the flavor of the chili peppers. I actually used dried beans instead of canned, and it took forever to cook (even though I had soaked them all day before cooking). After an hour and a half, they weren't quite as soft as I like, so I used the emulsion blender, then threw in a extra can of black beans so I'd have some unbroken beans, and it actually turned out great! It gave it a thicker chunkier texture. My boyfriend, who doesn't think beans belong in chili, truly loved this recipe! I will be making this again if we ever finish the gigantic batch this made!

I doubled this recipe and served it at my Superbowl party. What a hit! It easily served 20 people, and some went back for second and third helpings. It paired nicely with the Swedish Cornbread recipe that I also found on this site. The two made a lovely sweet/savoury combo.

I really loved the depth of flavor in this chili. I added some chopped roasted red pepper, 3 dried arbol chilis (whizzed with tomatoes and garlic in blender), cocoa powder, and chipotles in adobo. I halved the recipe but used only 2 cans of beans, and it was just right. Each bowl was topped with chopped pickled jalepenos before serving. It was SPICY, but delicious. I recommend this for a good change of pace -- like mole, but less of the overpowering chili powder taste.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent chili recipe. And yes, it makes an ENORMOUS order of chili for 8 people. Count on left overs. Being from Texas, though, I replace half the beans with an equal weight of ground beef or sausage, and substitute 12 oz of dark, tasty beer for 12 oz water.

After making this recipe for the first time, my family said NEVER to lose the recipe. The only modification I made was to half the onions to coincide with our taste(s). I had a bit of leftover tri-tip roast so I diced that and threw it in as well (although it was just fine without it)! Topped chili with grated cheddar cheese and sour cream. Paired it with cornbread and honey/butter. Outstanding!

Couldn't have been easier! Brought it to work for an office chili cookoff and came in 2nd place. I am a vegetarian, but had to feed a bunch of carnivores who all told me in no uncertain terms NO TOFU! I love TVP, tofu, etc., but it was a challenge to find a recipe that resembled "meatiness" without it. We loved this recipe and I would absolutely make it again. I didn't have a trace of bitterness and I followed the recipe nearly exactly. I used 2.5 large vidalia onions instead of five and I used six cans of Bush's beans (plain, no seasoning) rather than seven. I served it with the Two Cheese Polenta, also from this website, grated Ghiardelli bittersweet chocolate and sour cream mixed with fresh chopped cilantro. Delish! And easy to make in advance. Thanks so much for a great recipe. I can't wait to make it again!

I didn't make this recipe completely as directed...but i received comments saying "this is the best chili i think i've ever had" i halved the recipe. and used 2 cans of black beans, 1 can of kidney, 1 can of garbanzo and 1 can of corn. i also added beau monde seasoning (its like a salt) and bay leaf powder (penzy's spices) I don't know the porportions--i just tasted as i went along. it turned out fabulous

This was real comfort food and delicious. Made it with the polenta as suggested. I'd cut the polenta recipe in half...had to keep finding different ways to use it up (good with poached eggs for breakfast!) As per other cooks' suggestions, I used half espresso and half cocoa. Loved it.

This is great! It makes a lot of chili, but it scales down nicely if you don't want to make so much. To the other reviewers who didn't like it, I note that you substituted ingredients. I would encourage you to make the recipe as presented to see if you like it better.

Brought this to our church Chili Cook Off and it got RAVE reviews. I even got a sincere thumbs up from some anti-vegetarian folks. The following are my adjustments: I used VERY large onions so I only used 2 1/2. I used 1/4 cup of CHIPOTLE chili powder instead of the regular chili powder and did not add the 1/4 teaspoon it asked for toward the end. The crushed tomatoes where Italian seasoned. I used 4 cans of beans but I think it could have used 5 cans. I added a can of corn drained. YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Really wonderful chili. I cut the amount of onions in half, but otherwise kept it the same. We'll be making this again and again.

I thought the proportions seemed off and I noticed the other reviewers' comments about the bitterness, so I adjusted the recipe - I cut the chili, cumin, and oregano quantities in half, and used cocoa powder instead of espresso powder. (I also used 4 instead of 5 onions, and 4 instead of 7 cans of black beans - it still made way more than 8 servings.) It came out great - I'd definitely make it again.

Well, my dad loved it. I found it to be too bitter, however it did have a wonderful smoky quality. Like a reviewer before me, I also missed the tomato-ey tase that I love in chilis. I also would reccomend adding more spices. While the espresso was the highlight ingredient, the chili was otherwise rather bland. I would recommend topping it with grated bittersweet chocolate, it seemed to boost the flavor.

This chili is a sleeper - we acutally liked it better after it has been in the freezer and reheated. The Espresso is a subtle flavor that none of the tasters could quite identify - but all agreed that it was unique (in a good way) and very satisfying. I added 1 lb of roasted corn (from Trader Joe's frozen aisle) and we liked the additional texture.

It is hard to be the lone "bad review" but we really did not enjoy this recipe. There are so many other vegetarian chili recipes that are outstanding that this just did not compare. Too sweet, too much coffee maybe? Maybe just not to our tastes.

Someone posted earlier that they thought the amount of honey was excessive. I wish I had listened. I cooked it for a book group and then brought some of the leftovers to work (this recipe is huge) and most everyone thought it was too sweet. I followed the recipe except for adding beer instead of water. That could have added to the sweetness. Anyway, other than that it was good. I was a bit disappointed though. Was expecting greatness.

I really like this one--it's the kind of things meat-eaters like as well as vegetarians. I halve the recipe for four adults and there's still leftovers. In a half recipe I substitute 3/4 cup extra-strong brewed coffee for the espresso powder and throw in a tablespoon of epazote. Everyone asks for the recipe.

Wonderful recipe - and one of the few that we can prepare for our vegetarian friends and still enjoy ourselves. My husband, a die-hard carnivore, was dubious when he read the recipe, but now this is his favorite chili! I can never find chipotle powder, so I simply chop up three or four chipotle chiles, and add some of their adobo sauce, as well.

Rating: 2
I tried to be a hero and cook my own beans instead of using canned. My beans stayed a bit too hard, so I shouldn't really judge this recipe, but that doesn't mean I won't. Especially because I thought I'd also improve flavor by using bean cooking liquid for the water, decreasing onion count to three, and substituting molasses for the honey. My final result is something I'm doubtful would be greatly improved by following the recipe exactly. For me, it was too thin, sweet, and tomato-ey, not to mention insomnia-inducing, believe it or not, because of the espresso's caffeine. (I mean, the best part of wakin' up is chili in your cup.) Perhaps I shouldn't have eaten the entire output in one sitting. Perhaps I really should have included those extra two onions. But what do I know, I apparently am the only one crazy enough to make chili in the summer. I use every single suggested topping when I sit down to consume yet another vat of my remainder, so I can tell you, don't skip the topping of a little high quality bittersweet chocolate; it's the one thing that will get me through eating the rest. That's my story and I'm stickin' to it.

Served it for a football party over the polenta (though great alone) and it was a huge hit. I used fire-roasted tomatoes rather than the regular ones, added a little extra chiplote powder, and no water as I prefer it thicker.

I cut the recipe way down and made just enough for myself, with leftovers for another meal. Used one can of black beans and 1/2 of a 14 oz can of diced stewed tomatoes, 1/2 onion and spices in approximate proportion. I didn't have espresso powder, but used a tsp of cocoa powder (didn't add shaved chocolate). Served it over a custardy spoonbread. Now that I've tested it, I'm ready to try it for a bigger crowd.

I loved this dish. It could use another ingredient, IMHO. Maybe some chopped green peppers? The taste was fabulous. We couldn't get enough.

I'd recommend using real Mexican oregano if you can find it. It smells, looks, and tastes quite different from store-bought oregano and really finishes this dish. I'm also surprised no one has said anything about cutting the honey! I was skeptical so I added one quarter of the amount called for and still thought it was too sweet! But overall, a definite keeper.

I hate to give a bad review and disagree with so many cooks, but this turned out so awful that I had to throw it away. I listened to some suggestions, like substituting water with beer and using regular instant coffee rather than espresso, but it tasted burned and was so heavy. I really should try it again, because I may have done something wrong, but I probably won't.

Followed the advice of numerous earlier reviewers, cutting the onions down to two (large) and substituting Bass beer for the water; also used molasses instead of honey for a richer flavor. Served with Endive and Pear Salad with Gorgonzola Cream Dressing and Chipotle Corn Bread (both from this site) - all wonderfully well received! Will definitely make again.

Brought this to a pot luck and it was a huge hit, even though I thought it tasted bitter. (But then I'm not a coffee drinker, so I guess that makes sense) I followed the previous advice re: the onions and I went ahead and added TVP (Texturized Vegetable Protien) that I buy at Whole Foods...it adds a little bit of texture that resembles ground meat, but keeps it vegetarian.

Rating: 2
It always feels terrible to disagree with a fine group but I must admit this was not the hit in our home that it was in others. It was fine and even pretty good but not at the same level as some of the other recipes we have found here at epicurious. I did make it exactly as written and will say the addition of the condiments made the dish.

Rating: 4
I took most people's advice and only used 4 onions. I also added beer instead of water. The whole thing was amazing -- three of my guests took home the leftovers. The polenta was a perfect complement to the complexity of the chili. Also, while the chili was spicy, it was not hot.

Rating: 3
I like things hot so I threw in two dried chili peppers that I brought back from NM and upped the chipotle powder. I didnt have any beer left in the fridge so I used some birch beer (don't laugh) it complemented the cinnamin, coffee, chocolate combo perfectly. I also used some ground turkey for extra protein. I would highly recommemd(as embarrassed as I am to say it) the birch beer. I guess I was always skeptical of those coke or root beer pork ribs but now I understand why folks love 'em

Wonderful! I halved the recipe and used instant coffee instead of espresso, and the chili still tasted amazing. Very, very easy to make, and full of big delicious flavors. It's pretty economical, and made from cupboard staples, too. It takes a little time, so I made it on Sunday to eat for a few days. The leftovers made great lunches, too. My husband also enjoyed it, and he's not really a fan of non-standard chili. I'll be making this again.

Best chili recipe ever, and I love chili! I generally halve it and I have even quartered it. The onions don't seem to be too many. Have made it with half beer half water, which was excellent, have also made it with all vegetable stock and a few tablespoons dry red wine, which was also great. Will be making this again and again! To the cook from Brooklyn - I think you used too much chipotle. Do try again, it's worth it!

I feel terrible disagreeing with my fellow cooks; it is a rare occurance on epicurious.com where I have such a vastly different experience that those described. But this chili bombed at my house. All of the ingredients were so promising, but the result (even following some of the good advice, like halving the onions, adding some beer instead of all water, throwing some chocolate in the mixture, etc.)was way too smokey tasting and heavy for us. It looked so gorgeous (dark brown, like everyone said, but the taste was overwhelming and after a small bowl I had my first heartburn episode in 15 years! But that said, since so many obviously experienced people love it, I think everyone should probably try it once! Maybe we did something wrong, but I can't think what.

Great stuff. Wowed my wife's bridge group. Yes you have to reduce the onions a lot. I also had trouble finding the instant espresso, even though many stores used to carry it pre-Starbucks. Used super strong coffee and some brewed espresso. Chopped up chipotle and even added a touch of the adobo sauce. The chocolate and other condiments really were popular.

I saw this recipe and decided I had been hankering for chile. WOW!!! I took a lot of the suggestions as follows: 2 medium sized onions, alot more chipotle (ground it fresh), a bottle of beer instead of water, cooked ground beef on the side, draned it and added, used finely ground quality coffee, and added some unsweetened chocolate. It was so amazing a lot of it did not make it to the table as I was tasting it all day long. It was like something out of the movie 'Chocolat'. All I can say is that I have really added a great one to the repertoire. Can wait to do it again.

Delish! I basically scaled the recipe down to a more manageable size, used only one onion, and served atop the polenta(also scaled down). I loved it...Used jack cheese and Dubliner Irish cheese in the polenta since that's what I had, and it was awesome! The espresso added a nice rich depth to the flavor......but that polenta...mmmm

Overall, I agree that the onions overpower this dish. I would cut them down and add more tomatoes to even it out. Even then, I probably wouldn't make this again. Just returned from Montreal, try Gibby's in View Montreal for a classic meal.

The excessive amount of onions this recipe called for almost overpowered every other flavor particularly the espresso, couldn't even get a hint of that. Yet the honey added a nice sweetness. Next time I would add more tomatoes and some heat for a sweet and spicy taste...and definitely cut the amount of onions.

Really quite good. I didn't have ordinary chile powder, so used ancho chile powder. My husband loved it, even though it wasn't "his" recipe. I halved the recipe, and it would feed an army! Oh, a lesson learned: do NOT use low fat sour cream for a substitute for the marscapone (sic?) cheese in the polenta. Use the real deal. While baking, the polenta went really runny. It was OK, but next time will be far better. And I had no problem finding instant espresso. Cafe Bustelo instant espresso is found in my local (and fairly provincial) supermarket in the ethnic food aisle.

Rating: 3
This was a great variation of traditional chili. Next time, I would add more of the espresso powder as I love the element of surprise of that ingredient. I also substituted 1/2 of the beans for a pound of meat and the consistency was perfect. The chili also freezes well so you can make vats of it and have it for a while!

Rating: 3
Great, easy chili. Used instant coffe instead of expresso - still delicious. May try to increase the spiciness next time. And there definitely WILL bes a next time. After I'm done feeding the neighborhood with the current batch. Other reviewers' advice to halve the recipe is a good call! Also, LOVED the cheese polenta. Used yellow corn meal, but otherwise followed recipe exactly. While warm it was smooth and creamy, after being refridgerated overnight had a bread-pudding like consistency. Great both ways and definintely worth making. Thanks Epicurious for a great recipe!

Rating: 3
The espresso adds an unusual and flavorful touch to the chili (especially with a touch a grated chocolate). I don't recommend the baked polenta: too much work for too little added flavor. Use stovetop polenta instead and spend the $6.00 for the cheese on beer.

By itself the recipe is a great 3 forks. I served it over Trader Joe's corn bread, and I felt that made the whole meal 4 forks. I also halved the recipe, like some of the other reviewers, it still made LOTS of chili! I used instant coffee poweder instead of the espresso poweder. I also substituted sugar for the honey, about 1/8 c. sugar. Also, I added a trio of sweet bell peppers- red, orange and green (about 1/2 of each kind). I will definantly make this again, and maybe even add some corn next time.

In a sea of overwhelming approval, perhaps I set my hopes to high, but I was disappointed with the outcome. Could not find the instant expresso or the "special" chili which I read is $20. a quarter ounce. I thought the quantity of onion was overwhelming particularly from a texture experience. Might try cutting back on those, adding some carrot and green pepper. All in all I wish I were more impressed.

WOW! I saw this recipe, told my boyfriend about it, and of course he wanted me to make it right away (he's kind of a coffee-aholic). I didn't have much time to make it before he had to go to his night job, but I pulled it off!! I couldn't find any instant espresso powder, so I used 1/4 cup espresso I made in the French press, it worked very well. I'm not a huge fan of onions, so I cut the recipe down to 2 large onions instead. Very, very delicious, everyone that ate some loved it. I'll definitely be making it again.

This is the best chili recipe I have tried in a long, long time. Seriously. I've made it twice now and the second time I added 1 cup of beer + 1 cup of water in place of the 2 cups of water and simmered it a tad longer. Fantastic both ways.

Rating: 3
This recipe packs an awful lot of flavour for the time involved. It's quick, easy and can be made at the last minute. I halved the serving portions by directly halving the primary ingredients in the recipe - beans, tomatoes and water, but only cut back spices 0%-25% and reduced oil. Used 1 TBSP oil for 3 onions in a non-stick pan, 3 TBSP whole cumin seeds ground, 3 TBSP dried greek oregano in bunches ground, 4TSBP chile powder and 4 TBSP Columbian ground medium roast coffee (had it on hand and tried 5 stores on phone for instant expresso and couldn't find it). Used 1/2 tsp Chipotle Pepper (stock regularly) & extra garlic. It was quick and delicious. Served on basmati rice, with non-fat sour cream, cocoa powder and green onions. It was spicy but not too spicy and had great depth of flavour. Retains flavour well as reheated 2 days later in microwave and served with sweet potato. My partner thought it was yummy. My friend found it tasty for lunch. Simple and little effort. Tastes like you fussed a lot more. The dark colour is exotic. I think it's quite a forgiving recipe which can be tweeked to your liking. I wouldn't omit the coffee (instant expresso or roasted instant coffee) or chipotle pepper if you want the depth. And I agree with another reviewer, if possible don't use chipotle in adobe sauce. The plain chipotle pepper powder would be preferrable and more discreet. The abobe sauce would likely add more fiery heat than a subtle smoked flavour. Will definitely make again. Enjoy!!!

Rating: 4
I think this is a great recipe. My husband and I are on our third night of eating it, so it's a good thing that we like it! I, like some other reviewers, could not find chipotle powder and therefore used canned chipotle chiles in adobo sauce. I cheated a bit and added quite a lot of the adobo sauce, which gave the chili instant flavor, so I can't say how the recipe tastes exactly as written. I also used chicken broth in place of water, as I was deathly afraid of diluting the flavor too much with water. As modified, the recipe is lovely, and will feed you and yours for days.

The unusual use of ingredients caught my eye, it's what keeps cooking interesting for me. The depth of flavor that was achieved so quickly was very satisfying. Using fresh spices is key and the espresso added a wonderful smokey richness that worked well together. I now have a "secret" ingredient to add to recipes that may need some depth in a hurry. Served with rice would be very healthy and smart but I served this with polenta for the first time. I will definately make this again.

Chipolte powder is found in the spice section of most grocery stores these days. Too bad they no longer carry the "Brown Derby" Chili Powder-it made a very nice chili.

get dried chipotle chilies (often available at mexican specialty stores) and grind it in a coffee/spice grinder--after seeding and stemming, of course.

I substituted a few canned chipotles in adobo for the chipotle powder. It was not nearly as subtle and may be too spicy for some, but it was a great compliment to the espresso. I also added some very dark ground Ghirardelli chocolate at the end, as I felt the espresso did not add the depth I was looking for. My guests are still raving. Enjoy!

Well, I thought I had a previous message but it didn't get sent. So I'll try again. When you need chipotle chili powder for this recipe, order it from Tierra Vegetables (web site is at http://www.tierravegetables.com). You won't find the chili powder listed. You'll have to email them to get the exact price and shipping but I am sure it was $20 plus S&H for 1/4 ounce. I use it in everything...guacamole, chili, eggs, burritos, etc I has incredible depth. Don't be lured by cheap imitations....they are worthless. This stuff is priceless and to be savored and enjoyed. Just the smell will convince you. I have no financial interest in them but wish I did. They are located in Healdsburg CA.

Couldn't find chipolte chili powder - however, it was very delicious and comforting for winter. This recipe makes a huge batch so I froze the leftovers for lunches. I especially liked the bittersweet chocolate shavings on top.

Very good. I used a bag of fresh beans because it's what I had on-hand. Also, I cannot find instant espresso in this town, so I brewed some really strong coffee and used a cup of that. I cooked my black beans in chicken broth and used the remaining liquid as a substitute for the other cup of water. Added cayenne pepper at the end because I didn't have chipotle powder. Still it was extremely good and probably really close to the original recipe. The honey adds a nice sweetness that I thought I wouldn't like, but suprisingly did! Make it, you'll like it!

Great dish! For a potluck at our pottery studio, we served rice along with fresh cilantro, jalenpeno peppers and scallions! I didn't add any choco. and it tasted good. Also, I put everything in a crock pot when it was time to add the beans. Delish!

Important note: I made HALF this recipe and it fed SIX hungry people with leftovers. Otherwise it was a nice change from the usual chili recipe. Rather than serving chocolate shavings as a garnish, I added 2 squares of "noir de noir" and produced a rich, velvety, molé-like sauce. Served with saffron rice, sour cream mixed with a cup of fresh, finely chopped cilantro and corn bread. Final note: don't have fake espresso so used a small cup of the real thing.

This is a really unique-tasting chili. My batch turned out a little bitter, but I think it was because I used 1/3 cup ground Nicaraguan coffee instead of the espresso powder. (I also added 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips when I added the beans). The flavors are rich and smokey, with just a hint of sweetness. I won the "most original" prize at an office chili cook off, and it really stood out from the more traditional offerings. I also wondered if maybe adding some green pepper or jalapeno (or ancho chiles?) might be worth doing...Good stuff for a cold day, and definitely for the adventurous at heart.

Another winning chili recipe. Made it for just the two of us so I cut the recipe in half, added 1 1/2 tsp. coca powder. It was so thick I didn't really have to cook it down. In fact, when I went to heat it up for dinner (made it earlier in the day), it was so thick that I needed to add liquid...what else, but a little beer. Served it over white rice (beans and rice make a complete protein) and garnished it with non fat yogurt, sliced green onions and crushed lime flavored tortila chips. Hubby couldn.t stop saying "This is wonderful"

My vegetable-conscious kids (ages 19 and 13) loved this, not only as chili but as filling for wraps/burritos. Like any bean dish, it gets better as it sits . . . but it won't be around for long at our house! I used good strong coffee in place of the espresso powder and water. Will be making this for our neighborhood chili cookoff next month!

A great veggie chili recipe. I used 5 cans of black beans and a bag of veggie crumbles. I also added 1/4 cup of chocolate chips, which gave it a great, subtle flavor.

Just made this for a Superbowl party. Truly delicious. I was looking for a "traditional with a twist" chili recipe, and I've found my new standard. It's not very spicy, so if you like it hot you'll need more spice. I added the chocolate directly to the chili instead of leaving it out as a garnish (was worried my guests would get squeemish and not try it). It added such an incredible depth of flavor. I served it with only sour cream and corn chips, and it went FAST.

This chili is a beautiful mohaghany brown. I was concerned about the chocolate, but it was a nice touch. Would also be delicious with ground beef and a bit of beer. The depth of flavor was great. Will definitely make again!

I was not impressed with this chili although it has great potential. For my taste, I would cut back on the chili powder and the oregano. The amount of chili powder was overpowering and the oregano left a sharp after taste. I was unable to distinguish the chipolte flavor, so would experiment with that a little also.

My guests and I loved this dish! However, I did add 2 lbs of ground sirloin and omitted 2 of the cans of black beans. The meat really gives it a nice texture. I also added a 7oz can of beer in place of 1 cup of the water. This is a great recipe. The espresso makes a real difference and the chocolate is a great idea.

Fantastic Chili!! Even my nine year old gobbled it up - despite being concerned about it having Chocolate in it. We did not have Chipolte powder, so used two Chipolte peppers and some adobo sauce instead. I agree with the reviewer who said not to leave out the chocolate - it is an incredible addition!

Fantastic chili that fed a lot of people. Added a splash of stout beer too.

I love black beans and couldn't wait to try this. It is quite different. At first taste, I wasn't sure about it, but day two it was awesome after the flavors had a chance to meld. The espresso sure adds a new dimension, and if anyone is curious, I ate this dish in the evening and didn't have trouble falling asleep due to the caffeine! ;-D I didn't make the polenta, but I did use store-bought polenta. I think that adds a nice layer to this dish. Also, I made half the recipe, and it was enough to last me for lunch for a week.
