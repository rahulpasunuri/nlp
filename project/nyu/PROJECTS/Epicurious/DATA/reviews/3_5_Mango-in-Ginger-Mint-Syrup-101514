Good with something else, but not enough on its own. Served with Coconut-Lime Rice Pudding.

Refreshing, light, & exotic dessert. The longer you let it sit and chill the better it will taste.

This is one of those recipes I fall back on when I need something light, refreshing and unique, to share. I don't just stop at mangoes though--I use it for pineapple, kiwi, melon, papaya and even lychees! Somtimes I add a little honey, too. I always let it reduce a bit more, so it thickens--otherwise the syrup ends up in a puddle in the bottom of the bowl! Oh BTW-- they syrup is GREAT with vodka LOL

I thought this was good. I think that it really serves 2, not 4 (this was from a low-fat menu and meant to be light). There was a lot of syrup left over, so I saved it and will use another mango with it tonight.

I made the syrup with half water and half champaign and steeped three green cardamom pods with the mint. It added a complexity to the dish, everyone loved how light and aromatic this was. It was delicious after a big spicy Indian meal.

Nice and light. I would have liked the syrup to have been a little heavier though. Maybe the next time, I will cook the syrup a little longer, or add more sugar.

wonderful, light dish, esp if you love ginger.

A delicious light dessert. Simple to prepare, and everyone loves it! I do recommend adding a squeeze of fresh lime juice to the syrup.

Refreshing and not too sweet. I diced the mango but next time I think I'd cut it in slices and serve fanned out on a colorful plate. A keeper!

These were a little more time-consuming than I'd have liked, but all in all, they turned out well. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the ginger-mint combination wasn't overpowering, but sweet and delicious.

Loved this! Summer fruit desserts are so nice and refreshing, and this one is high up on my list of favorites. A non-dessert eating relative slurped this up. Pure success.

It was good, but here's an easier version that I like even better: Mix fresh lemon juice with honey until just sweet. Combine with cubed or sliced mango, chopped Australian candied ginger (the soft kind) and fresh mint.

Delicious, easy, low-fat -- I'll have to start making dessert more often! The presentation was tricky for me to get, but I think a pretty cocktail glass would have made everything look just right.

Have you ever tried a recipe that was so easy you felt a bit guilty (from your lack of work) when people rave? Well this is one of those. Out of all the four fork recipes I try off this site (which are always good) and from my far too large library of cookbooks, it is this one that my honey insisted I share with his mother. We really like this to follow spicy grilled fish or shrimp. As requested by other reviewers, I add a touch of lime, cut mango in 1 1/2 inch dice rather than thin slices, and USE 2 MANGOS. If your mangos are ripe you will not need the extra sugar as requested by another reviewer. Also good with a high quality vanilla bean ice cream. ENJOY!

My big tip for this dessert: add the juice of two limes to the sauce, and two tablespoons of extra sugar. Lime juice gives this dessert an extra zing and brings the flavour to a whole new level. I also added a few pinches of finely chopped mint leaves just before serving. This is a wonderfully different, refreshing and light dessert. I will certainly make it again!

This is very tasty. But it takes 2 mangoes to serve 4. I also garnished with a few rasberries. It was pretty as well as delicous and easy.

This was yummy. Of course it is definitely affected by the ripeness of the mango. The ones I used were just short of perfect, so the "slices" called for in the recipe should really be bite-sized. I served it topped with lemon sorbet and fresh mint and tucked a thin ginger cookie into the sorbet. My guests raved about it!
