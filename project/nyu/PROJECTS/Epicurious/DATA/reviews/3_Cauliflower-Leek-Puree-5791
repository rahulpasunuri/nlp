This dish is fantastic if you follow the suggestion to add garlic, and saute the garlic and leeks in a butter/olive oil mixture. I added crushed red pepper, lemon juice and tarragon as I pureed, and added asiao shortly before serving.

Having read the "bland" comment, I made the following changes: I boiled the cauliflower until very soft in chicken stock, sauteed two leeks in butter until carmelized, and roasted several garlic cloves in olive oil. I pureed them all together, including the olive oil and stirred in a little parmessan before transferring to a casserole to bake. It was fantastic, and anything but bland.

To boost it up even more, add a jalapeno pepper and a bit of olive oil.

We found this a great and differerent way to add cauliflower to our menu. I didn't have a leek so I used a few green onions. I will definitely use this recipe again - especially since we are trying to eat fewer carbs.

It's a nice result with minimal effort. As for the "bland" comment: I recommend 2 cups of leeks and season to taste. Also, I used a good vegetable stock for my vegan friends.

I haven't had anything this bland since Gerber's vegetables baby food!
