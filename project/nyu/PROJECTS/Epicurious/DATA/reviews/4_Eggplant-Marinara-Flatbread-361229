Excellent and easy - what more could you ask for! This is a "go to" recipe when friends drop in for a glass of wine.

I love eggplant - in this recipe the goat cheese rules. It takes away from the eggplant as the star. A great recipe, but I would cut down on the goat cheese if you really want to compliment the eggplant as the main ingredient!

I decided to make these because I have a tendency to make spicy food and I was having guests whose tastes were very bland and ordinary. Boy was I surprised! These are DELICIOUS! My guests destroyed them! The ingredients are right on. Gotta pick the right bread.

A simple delight. I baked it all, rarely use a skillet. Excellent flavors. Vegetarians will like this. Used a good quality fresh mozzarella.

I thought the goat cheese layer presented a bit of a "twist" on an old favorite and really enjoyed the inspiration to make this. Was definitely a favorite and have made it twice already- even kids loved it- I guess this is an elementary pleasing recipe:)

Love how a few simple ingredients come together to make something more than the sum of the parts. My husband, who doesn't like eggplant, loves this dish. Serve as an appetizer for guests, a simple lunch or a light dinner. We love it.

YUM YUM YUM! So much more then the average loaf out of the oven. It's getting so much easier to bring sophisticated foods back home! I should know, it's part of my job to review recipes for Better Recipes This one is superb! It makes life a whole lot more fun to make food art!

i thought this was a nice and easy way to serve up a satisfying dinner using the late summer garden ingredients. maybe "a cook from chicago" should stick to saveur with the other food elitests, i appreciate being able to open my bon appetit and finding something that is a sure hit.

For every experienced chef...there is someone just learning to enjoy the "elementary" recipes that are staples and inspiration for wonderful meals... Thank you Epicurious for printing the recipe, one I have enjoyed for years!

this is SO elementary - every hungry kid (who likes eggplant) can imagine it. Silly to put it in a national magazine or major website. C'mon, Epicurious!

Make it often as a nice lunch or dinner snack. Too many variations to mention, but different cheeses, spices, breads and sauces make this a winner anytime.

Fantastic dish. Heavy enough for dinner. Freshest of basil a must! I substituted mozzarella for medium cheddar and found it perfect. Highly recommend this one!

Made this recipe as directed. It was a hit and a great use for our summer eggplant and basil. Next time, I may sprinkle a few kalamata olives on, but that may be gilding the lily.

This was such a simple and easy but delicious dinner that took me less than 30 minutes to make. I left out the mozzarella to cut the fat, and the result was a creamy, smooth topping to a lovely crusty bread.
