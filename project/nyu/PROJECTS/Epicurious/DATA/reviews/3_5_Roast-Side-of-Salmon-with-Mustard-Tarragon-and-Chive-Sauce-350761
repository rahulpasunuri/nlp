Didn't know I made this before! Made again and we all loved it!! I made the sauce ahead of time and the samlmon was done in 10 minutes. How could anyone not like it?? If you don't like tarragon either don't make the recipe or use less tarragon.

Used yogurt instead of mayo, 1 shallot instead of chives, and 1 tsp brown sugar. Brill!

One of my go to recipes, delicious and very easy. I use maille dijon mustard but otherwise follow exactly. My only complaint is the presentation, it kind of falls apart when I slice it:

This is the easiest most delicious salmon I have ever made. A big hit for a group of 7 people with one serving left over. The salmon I bought had no skin but it worked fine anyway. This is one to do over and over. Everyone loved it.

This was great-- I was skeptical when I tasted the sauce just after making it but the flavors melded after sitting for 10 min or so and kept the fish moist while cooking.

Very good, made ahead and served cold for Easter buffet. Everyone enjoyed. Made as written.

Made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I don't like tarragon so replaced it with dill and parsley, as well as the chives. Very easy to make. It's a keeper!

This dish is a pretty good one. My friend made it for us, but used creme fraiche instead. I think that was a wise choice. Mayonnaise just sounds gross!

On the advice of others reduced the sugar (used 1 tsp) in this delicious sauce which is the key to the recipe. Easy to prepare and quick to the table - salmon was nicely cooked and flavorful. Served with roasted small Golden Yukons and steamed broccoli. Next time will eliminate sugar all together.

This is a great, quick recipe! Salmon was moist and tender, sauce went perfectly. Looking for4ward to making it again!

I only used 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and used dill instead of tarragon. My side of salmon was quite large so it needed to bake a little longer, but otherwise I followed the recipe. Fantastic!! Everyone devoured it. We did not need all the extra sauce so next time I might not make it all (although it would be good on other things).

Really wonderful. Will make again.

Needs significant tweaking to take it past dull and boring.

the sauce...the sauce!!! the creaminess, the yumminess! there's a slight chance more lemon was used, but the freshness was absolutely necessary for cutting the richness of the velvety, creamy, silky....sauce. the temperature and the cooking time were absolutely on point for the salmon...not dry in the slightest...AND use the saucey sauce for sandwiches...think about it ;)

I have made this a number of times, especially for big buffet dinners. Often not a scrap left. I make and bake it as written except I decrease sugar. A family favorite and so easy. I have served it with small potatoes roasted in salt. They turn out creamy, a perfect canvas for a dab of the mustard sauce.

used half mayo / half sour cream. DELICIOUS!!!

I was careful with the sugar due to the other review. I started with a Tablespoon, tasted, added a teaspoon and that tasted sweet enough to me. I didn't add any extra while I was eating it, but other people did. I probably put more than a 1/2 cup on the fish. I didn't measure, I just did it until it looked right to me. I would definitely make this again.

While the sauce made an excellent glaze for the fish as it cooked, it was unpleasantly sweet as a condiment. I will make this again (my guests loved it) but omit the sugar.

Exceptional dish. Perfect for company and it couldn't be easier. One of the few recipes that I do exactly as written!!

nice, easy but not exceptional. sauce was yummy. salmon was yummy. but it did not blow me away.

A nice treatment for a run-of-the-mill Coho, that needed a little boost in the flavor department. I think I would cut the sugar a tad next time but the sauce was tasty - good on green beans too.

This is so easy and the result is a flavorful salmon dinner. How could anyone not like it?? If you don't like tarragon either don't use it or use less.

Made this today for Sunday lunch. Didn't have brown mustard so I substituted for a mix of Dijon and grainy mustard. It was excellent. Fresh herbs make all the difference. Used loads of fresh tarragon and chives and added a little extra lemon zest and lemon juice. Served with roasted new potatoes, roasted asparagus and steamed buttered zucchini. Delicious.

The sauce was over the top, too sweet and overwhelmed the Salmon.

Very good, and so easy to make. This gotta be my #1 Salmon recipe. My husband love the sauce, this will also be good for company.

I made this recipe last night and we LOVED it! One of the easiest things I've ever made I think! I didn't have chives, but it was fine without them. I didn't use much salt at all, but a ton of pepper. I used dried tarragon instead. I'll definitely make this again for company. YUM!

We usually have great success grilling fish, and not very good luck with fish in the oven. But this recipe was wonderful--great flavor and it kept the fish moist. I actually made 1/4 recipe and used it with about a pound of salmon and that made just enough sauce to cover the fish with a little sauce left over to serve at the table.

For once, I made salmon that turned out tasty! I have a disability with this particular fish. I used what I had on hand--dried tarragon (no fresh at the store) and Grey Poupon. Flavour was nice but needed a spicier mustard, and fresh herbs would make a huge difference.

I made this recipe last night and WOW!!! Both my husband and me both loved it. I served it with a mango couscous. It was extremely simple and what an easy do ahead recipe. The big secret here is to reduce the tarragon. This is the first time I made this recipe but I know from experience tarragon goes a long way!!! I think I cut it in half.

I made this last minute with what I had on hand. I used 1 Tbl dried tarragon instead of fresh and 2 Tbl dijon instead of the dark mustard. Otherwise I followed the rest of the directions. It was wonderful. My kids even had seconds!

Yuck... Too heavy on the spices. The tarragon and mustard create a pungent taste. I made it for a pot luck and it was not a hit.

This is a fantastic quick and easy dish that can be served for a casual dinner, brunch buffet or meal to impress! I actually used Dijon instead of Spicy Brown mustard because its all I had and it turned out wonderfully. This could be served hot or cold and would be great on a buffet table for brunch. I served this with simple steamed asparagus which paired very well with the extra sauce. I will make again and again as an elegant, timesaver dish for company!!
