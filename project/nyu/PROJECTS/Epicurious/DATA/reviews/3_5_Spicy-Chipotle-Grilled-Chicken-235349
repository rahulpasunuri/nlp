This has become a summer favorite for serving to guests. Everyone loves it. We follow the recipe exactly.

What a spectacular, complex and tasty chicken recipe. It's worth buying a local, natural chicken for the flavor. This is just as easily done in the oven. Double the recipe, as this chicken holds well in the fridge after it's done. Leftovers were fought over at my house. If you are one who doesn't like the heat, just pull back on the chili/adobo paste a bit, I probably will next time.

I know two things. If an internet recipe says "just the right amount of heat", I add twice as much heat, therefore twice as much chipotle. And twice as much garlic, in this case, given the reviews. And yes, a full lime squeeze. That's the second thing, to me a marinade won't work without something acidic. I used boneless chicken breasts and thighs on a Foreman grill, just cuz I thought that'd turn out better than the broiler. Voila! Yes, I grilled for 8 minutes or so, then brushed on the leftout marinade and grilled for another 3 or so. Turned out A-OK. Tricky line with chicken between cooking out the pink and not overcooking til tough. Then I grilled a whole sliced green pepper and several onions in turns, put it over the meat to marinate for another night, just cuz I'm not hungry right now after sampling everything. Folks, if it's not hot enough for ya, anything, use some more spice. Put some hot sauce later. It's not rocket science. If ya know ya want it hot, ya oughta know what to do to make it that way. Peace. Out.

Not sure what what anyone is doing wrong here - I have made this over and over again - both grilled and broiled - have always marinated overnight using my hands to rub into the chicken. Tastes great with or without a squeeze of lime.

This really disappointed me - it sounded great and was full of ingredients that I love, but it was just missing something. I did use extra lime and cilantro per other reviewers suggestions, but it still didn't work. Bummer.

This is a good recipe. However, it needs lime juice. I squeezed an entire lime in the 2nd time I made it and it was MUCH better that way.

Thoroughly mediocre. Should have bite but doesn't. Not worth the time and effort.

Excellent! Used only 1/2 of chipotle and it was perfect. Had a nice bite to it.

My family loved it! I made it exactly as the recipe stated. It was very easy. Will make it again for company!

I made this with only about an hour for the chicken to marinate. Next time I would definitely try marinating it overnight to see if it intensified the flavor. Like another reviewer, I would add more cilantro next time and would take the suggestion to add some lime juice as well, as the marinade was very good, but seemed to lack a little bit of complexity. Still, the chicken was very tasty and the heat was just the right amount. I will try this one again for sure.

I loved this! Nice flavor although I'm not sure it was necessary to marinate overnight. I added some lime juice and broiled rather than grilled. It was quite nice, but I'm sure it would be even better grilled!

Wonderful smokey flavor from the adobo sauce. I would add more cilantro to add a bit more "brightness" to the flavors, but very good! I can't wait to use this marinade on pork. This also gets me closer to duplicating the creamy smokey sauce used in the albondigas recipe at our favorite local Mexican resturant.

We thought this recipe was fantastic. Just the right amount of heat and smokey flavor from the chipotles and a good combination of spices. This dish will be one that we make often.

I enjoyed this recipe and am more interested in the marinade than the chicken. I'm going to try it on ribs and pork tenderloin. I also used bone in skin on chicken breasts. Very good.

I was a little let down. The recipe is plenty spicey but I was left wanting more flavor. I think the Chili powder drowned out everything else. The next time I try it I'm going to blacken the chicken, use a little more garlic, and onion with less chili powder
