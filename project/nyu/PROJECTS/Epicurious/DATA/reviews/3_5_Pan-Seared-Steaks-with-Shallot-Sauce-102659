A couple of things didn't work out for me here. First off was the acidity. The finished product was just too acidic for me. Secondly was the shallots. They didn't cook through to my liking. My changes for next time are as follows: Drop vinegar to 2 tbsp. After cooking steaks, a little bit of oil and/or butter and saute shallots until soft. Finish the rest as written. That's my 2¢.

Very good recipe. Substituted one TB of balsamic vinegar for one the tablespoons of sherry vinegar and served with some blue cheese mashed potatoes and some of the sauce and it was delicious!

A few months ago, I made this for my boyfriend. He LOVED it. The only problem I we had was that the steaks got cold while the sauce was cooking.( It took a lot longer than expected because of the pan I was using.) My suggestion is to put your oven at around 250 degrees and put the steaks in to keep warm. Don't cook the steaks all the way in the pan, or else they will become overdone in the oven. Also, I make this with oven roasted green beans and rice pilaf. the sauce is very good over both sides, which was perfect for my boyfriend because he likes to mix his food together. Can't wait to make it for him again!

Hi I made this sauce tonight with black angus strip steaks. I did make a few changes. Instead of vinegar, I used sherry wine. Instead of real butter, I used smart butter. I also browned the shallot before adding the other ingredients and I added a touch of cornstarch mixed with water as the sauce reduced and then another spoonful of smart butter prior to serving. The sauce was marvelous and I cannot wait to make it again - perhaps with veal or lamb - I also would like to try baslamic vinegar instead of sherry next time too.

I made this w/ nice, thick cut Veal Chops. I also used balsamic like others. My twist was pouring sauteed baby portobella mushrooms over the chops before finishing off w/ the sauce. Hubby said one of the best I ever served him!

Maybe my vinegar was bad, but this sauce was downright terrible.

This was the first steak entree I ever served to my husband that he ate without adding A1! I sub'd balsamic vinegar too and I think that's what did the trick. Yummy!

I didnt have any sherry vinegar on hand, so I used the juice of half a lemon, and it worked fine!

This was okay. But steak is so good by itself, I'm very picky about what kind of sauce goes over it. This one just didn't cut it. The ingredients just didn't seem to come together.

Very delicious! Very simple. I used Balsamic vinegar instead of the sherry. Came out great. A staple in my house.

I don't love my steaks seared, I like them grilled. Other than that, it was good. A good piece of meat is imperative. Subs: used balsamic vinegar instead of sherry vinegar

This is by far the easiest and fastest method for a simple and delicious steak and sauce. It helped that I used an Angus New York sirloin. Remember that a little goes a long way so do not smother your steak with the sauce. The sauce should compliment the steak without being heavy and overpowering. Served with corn on the cob and a salad of arugula, heirloom tomatoes and fresh bocconcini made it a very rememorable meal.

Excellent. I also subsituted the balsamic vinegar for the sherry vinegar, and used a little white wine instead of more vinegar. I also sub'ed rosemary for taragon. This is a great sauce for excellent steaks. We all crave it often!

Wow! Using balsamic and red wine vinegars instead of sherry, this came out incredibly good. I'm a reformed vegetarian, so cooking meat sometimes scares me -- but this was confidence inspiring.

This is very easy and so tasty! A great sauce for steaks. I also finished my steaks in the oven first as they were about 2 inches thick.

This is a wonderful recipe and so easy! The sauce is out of this world. This is an excellent dish for entertaining. I served it with garlic and chive mashed potatoes and roasted plum tomatoes. I did make a few small changes to the recipe because I had filet mignon instead of strip steaks. I seared the steaks on all sides and then finished them in a 400 degree oven (about 10 minutes) until done. Before putting the pan in the oven, I added a little of the beef broth and about 1/4 cup dry white wine. Then when the steaks were finished, I removed the pan from the oven and just added the the rest of the sauce ingredients to the same pan after I removed the steaks. Incredible!

I thought this was very good - I used Champagne vinegar rather than sherry which may work for those that complained the sauce too heavy & vinegary

This was EXTREMELY rich. I served it with the sauteed mushrooms Diane also on this site and we could not finish it! It tasted delicious, it was just too . . . heavy. Made me recall steaks I ate in France. I will make this again, but somehow lighten it. Perhaps it was the mushrooms, which were great, but the combo may have been over-the-top. Steaks were yummy in scrambled eggs the next day!

I added a dash of some good balsamic vinegar to the sauce and it turned out great! I will make this again soon! Everyone loved it!

I rate most Bon Appetit recipes with 3 or 4 forks. This is my first 2 fork rating. This was just not very good. The sauce was just vinegary and bland. Didn't work with the steak. I won't make this one again.

This was good, but for some reason my steaks would just not cook all the way through. I used top sirloin. I am going to try this again with thinner steaks. My husband really liked these, and wanted additional sauce for his steak. Fortunatly, I had made a little extra!! I am sure it will turn out better when I try again. Next time I am going to add a little dijon.

This is a nice, quick dish. I also added some sauteed mushrooms to the sauce.

This was pretty good. My fiance liked it more than I did. Next time I'll use a less expensive steak; maybe sirloin. I didn't have sherry wine vinegar so I substituted sherry cooking wine and added a tablespoon of vinegar. I doubled the sauce too. Next time I'll use the right vinegar and thicken the sauce a little.

When it says pan fry steaks for 4 minutes per side, they mean it. Mine was fine but it was a little more done than I would have liked. very good sauce!

If you need to prepare an entree quickly, with a need to impress your guests, look no further. With four of our friends coming over for an impromptu dinner, this recipe fit the bill. Everyone raved!

This was soooo easy to make and delicious. The sauce was great-- nice and tangy-- and takes no time at all. Boyfriend and I both enjoyed it.

The sauce is wonderful and this is very easy to make, but it deserves a really good cut of meat, which I didn't have--but I will next time! I'm sure this sauce would be great over pork chops too, and probably chicken, as well.
