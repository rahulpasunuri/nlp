Followed recipe. Fish was delicious, potatoes-sliced very thin on mandolin were not cooked enough.

Outstanding! I used more lemon, oregano and olives than the recipe called for and substituted cod. The resulting juice was so good I was sorry I hadn't made rice to pour it over. Should be great for an easy dinner for company, too.

A-MAZING! This came together in no time at all. I used tin foil and followed the review and sliced the potato (I ended up with a yam - no difference) and cooked it in the oven with a tad of olive oil and some of the garlic slices. I didn't have oregano (Whole Foods didn't have it either - drat) so I used Rosemary - wonderful sub. Baked it for 20 minutes in tin foil packet and served with wild rice. Fantastic!!!

Absolutely delicious. My husband and I devoured it; will make for company next time. I sliced everything very thin by hand. Added a touch of smoked sea salt we bought at the farmers market but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Very simple and fast. Yum!

I cut the potatoes to 3 mm using a mandolin and boiled them for 5 minutes before wrapping them in the parchment. The oregano with the lemon and olives was delicious. I can't say that I eat a lot of oregano but this recipe encourages me to experiment more with it in the future.

Made it according to the recipe except didn't have any parsley in. Delicious flavors and an all-in-one dish with very little dishes to do. Perfect healthy dinner for a busy life style.

I made this adhering exactly to the recipe tonight except for folding the parchment pouch instead of tying and it was superb. Loved it, my wife loved it and my little girl wanted more.

since these were in packets, I made them two ways. The first way was following this recipe. They were good, but nothing special. The other approach elevated it significantly. I used sliced sweet red peppers, fresh basil, garlic and sea salt with some EVOO. Excellent!

This dish has great presentation and flavors. I would make it again but use a tastier kind of fish like mahi or snapper. also be sure to slice the potatoes very thin since fish cooks very fast.

This is amazing. I didn't even make the potatoes. I just put the cod in parchment paper and added other ingredients as instructed. I cooked it on the grill because my oven is broken. Had garlic and olive oil cous cous and steamed carrots for a side. Sooooo good. Adding this to my regular fish rotation.

We loved this recipe. After reading reviews, I pre-baked the potato slices for about 10 min. This avoids dirtying a pot for blanching, and gives them a nice roasted flavor. To make it even easier, I prepared the potato acc to the recipe, tossing w/oil, oregano and salt and pre baked them on the foil I was using for recipe. So no extra clean up! I also sprayed the foil lightly w/oil this time -- last time they stuck a bit. I also added more olives and herbs then called for, and reduced baking time to about 25 min. Wonderful flavors, and the potatoes were perfectly done, w/out being mushy. Definitely a keeper. So good, and so little clean up!

I don't like fish, but I love this recipe! I make this with halibut.So far, I've skipped the parchment paper and just used a covered oven safe pan. I the parchment paper would be a nice presentation & I'll prob. try it eventually. (I'll try it cooked in wine sometime too.)

SO disappointed in this meal. I thought the flavors were so unappealing. My husband was also disappointed. We definitely will not make this again.

The flavors were delicious, the fish moist, presentation beautiful. I made it with haddock and was in a hurry so I skipped the individual parchment and cooked it in a baking dish sealed tightly with foil. The potatoes and fish were both undercooked after 20 minutes and the dish seemed dry, so I poured a little white wine in the pan to help it along and it was INCREDIBLE. Kids (12 & 7) loved it (after scraping off parsley for 7 yr-old) Husband (not a big fish eater) had to be discouraged from licking the empty baking dish. Next time will add the wine from the start and serve with crusty bread to sop up lovely sauce.

Rating: 4
Not too fussy, and impressive. I think 30 minutes at 400 degrees is a bit long - fish was overcooked. Next time will try 25 (I sliced the potatoes very thinly with a mandoline), or perhaps do the potatoes separately on a Silpat and plate the cooked fish on it at time of serving.

This was delicious, impressed my boyfriend, and so easy. I skipped the potatoes all together. Rather than tying the parchment paper, I folded them into lovely little packages. The fish came out absolutely perfectly! Moist, tender, flavorful, light. I served it with grilled radicchio and fat asparagus spears in a balsamic vinaigrette. All super tasty!

Took advice to parboil potatoes, did 2 min. should of done 3; used mandoline on large potatoe. I would suggest to add more/all of the toppings rather than " a few." I cooked for 20-25 min for 1" - 1 1/2" thick pieces of Atlantic Cod. Used parchment but foil probably just as good and no tying little bow ties! I'm going to try again with a bigger package of more potatoes and toppings. This is a major low-cal healthy meal paired with zucchini "lasagne" and a salad.

I recently made this dish for the hubby and myself. I thought it was absolutely delicious and also easy to throw together. I paired it with a mixed green salad with tangerine and fennel, which complimented the light flavors in the dish. This would be an easy yet impressive dinner for guests. I'll definitely be making it again.

This was incredibly easy and delicious. Even my 3 yr old and 5 yr old gobbled it up. They aren't big fans of potatoes in general, so they only ate a few bites there, but they ate their entire servings of flaky cod. We did theirs without olives and ours with, and we used lime because we were out of lemon. We also added a few grape tomatoes to some of the packets. All of which is to say that this is an easy and forgiving recipe that is flexible for different palates. Even the kids will love it! And any recipe that the whole family enjoys equally is worth its weight in gold.

So good and so pretty!! Perfect for picky eaters because each pack can be made differently (no olives, less garlic, etc.) Just make sure you get SKINLESS black cod...I left the bottom skin on once and it ruined the flavor of the dish.

YUM! Very good and simple. Even made these in the toaster oven. Wow, Black Cod is expensive here!

Perhaps I didn't get the proportions right, but the flavors didn't come together as nicely as I would have expected. Potatoes were tender and tasty (cut thinly by hand), and my husband enjoyed it, but this combination of flavors just didn't appeal to my tastes.

This would have been even better with much more olives. Family doesn't like them and I was a bit leery with adding too many, but with the strong swordfish (that's what I had) it needed a bit more. No leftovers, and with three kids that's always a nice thing.

This was good and I loved the limited cleanup and scalability! After reading the reviews, I blanched the potatoes briefly. I had to cook it a few minutes longer than stated.

Hmmm... This was delicious! I used aluminum foil packages instead of the parchment paper. Seemed like too much fuss for a weeknight meal. A note on the potatoes--I used my cuisinart to slice the potatoes uber thin, and they came out cooked perfectly. Not too mushy, but not raw either. My only regret is that I made two left-over servings, and stored them in tupperware. Note to self and others: TAKE OFF THE LEMON SLICES BEFORE STORING. The lemon made everything bitter and disgusting by the next day.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I sliced the potatoes and pan fried them for 3 minutes before making the packets. I tried substituting thyme in one packet instead of the oregano and it was not nearly as good. Will most definitely make again...for company!

Rating: 3
I agree with the previous notes on the potato. I blanched them for 3 minutes before proceeding. I cut this recipe in thirds as I only needed it for myself and my husband. Be stingy with the lemon, but really heavy on the olives. Too much lemons unbalances it and will make it bitter. The olives and salt, flavour and balance. Otherwise, excellent.

Absolutely loved this dish and will make again and again... not only can it be scaled down in terms of ingredients (everything the recipe called for for my husband and me, just the fish, potatoes and garlic for youngest child and potatoes, oil, and salt only for vegetarian oldest child), it is delicious in all the incarnations we tried. One variation other people may enjoy - I roasted whole, unpeeled garlic cloves on the tray with the parchment packages, which gave us extra garlic "paste" for those in the family who love extra garlic. As an extra benefit, clean-up was practically nil, and the parchment paper the meal had been cooked in went into the compost. Hard to cook more mindfully of the environment than that!

Rating: 4
I've used both red and Yukon gold potatoes - both are great - just make sure they're sliced very thin. This takes some time to prepare but is worth it and there is basically no clean up. No need to use parchment paper and string - foil works just as well. I think Cod works best with this recipe - I tried Haddock once and it turned out soggy.

My husband and I are living in Italy for the year, and when Passover rolled around, we wanted to find a good seafood dish. Merluzzo (cod) is everywhere here, so this dish seemed perfect. This was my first experience making something in parchment paper. We didn't have kitchen string, so I substituted unwaxed dental floss (it worked!). All of my packets were ready about two hours before cook time. Just as I was about to put them in the oven ahead of our seder for two, our gas tank gave out! We ended up cooking them two-by-two in our mini toaster oven and they were still fantastic--"restaurant quality," according to my husband. It certainly is a testament to the strength of the recipe that it can be cooked in a toaster oven and the flavors will still meld fantastically! We'll definitely be eating this again...but hopefully next time, using the oven!

this was absolutely wonderful. if cooked properly the fish is rich yet delicate. as learned from previous recipes, potatoes do not cook at quite the same rate as fish, so roasting them for 10-15 minutes first really helps. the presentation of serving the pouches on plates is also very unique.

Rating: 4
We've done this on the grill in foil & in the oven in parchment paper. Both methods give a wonderful, tasty, moist preparation. Sometimes in summer, we use tomatoes instead of lemons or use both. You don't need all that extra salt though. Just sprinkle a little over the potatoes is all that is necessary really.

Rating: 3
This dish had wonderful flavor and very fun presentation, but I thought it needed a couple of adjustments. I didn't think the potatoes would cook in 20 min so I sliced then blanched them. The fish cooked in about 17 minutes and my pre-cooked potatoes still were sl under cooked (our mandoline did break after just a few slices so we didn't achieve super thin potatoes). Also the garlic was pretty raw in that brief time. I did use green olives w/ garlic and lemons from Whole Foods and haddock. Will definitely work on this dish as very yummy overall.

The only way I know to improve on this dish is to make the same mistake I did: I halved the recipe but forgot to halve the amount of olive oil and oregano used at the beginning. The result is a decptively simple dish with perfect seasoning and texture. Never use frozen fish, as I found in my second attempt (I should have known). I tried this a third time with Opah; it was lovely, but nothing compares so far to the fresh black cod.

This was rather bland and I even added more garlic and tomatoes. I don't know if it was the fish I used - not black cod just regular cod loins. I would not make this again.

Fantastic!!!! The fish was cooked to perfection. I didn't expect such a rich flavor given the simple ingredients. I roasted the potatoes for 10 minutes b/f adding them to the packet.

Would this work with cod instead of sablefish (black cod)? Sablefish is rather expensive around here. . . .

I altered this slightly based on what was available/on sale at the store: aluminum foil instead of parchment (worked fine, just not as pretty), instead of olives I used olive salad (in New Orleans it's wildly popular and delicious, a mix of olives, pimientos, olive oil, and spices), and added tomatoes, garlic (can it ever go wrong?) & artichoke hearts. It was fantastic, and my boyfriend, who doesn't usually like healthy food or olives, was in love with it. Don't sub tilapia for the black cod, maybe sub salmon if you must - it should be a relatively fatty, richly-flavored fish or you lose the depth of the flavors. Definitely will make this again and tweak it a bit each time, but you'd do fine if you felt like following the recipe exactly.

Insane! Everyone absolutely loved these little packets. I did use black cod. One thing I forgot to do was drizzle the olive oil on before wrapping. No big deal, I drizzled a bit on the paper and sprinkled some oregano on top as well. It smelled awesome while being baked. Oh and I made them as an appetiser.

This had great flavor but I did not care too much for the texture of the potatoes, found them too mushy. Maybe better to cook them outside the parchment.
