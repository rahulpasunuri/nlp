I microwaved the halved squash to soften it up a little, and then cut into squares. I kept the skin on, but next time will not. It adds an odd texture. But I absolutely loved the ginger and honey with the squash - fantastic. (Only used half the squash - froze the rest.)

Agree with prior reviewer, just halfed, seeded and scooped out flesh. 1/2 I roasted and will use as a side and soup base The other half I froze and will use later to saute and use in Risotto.

This is silly...when roasted, baked, or steamed, the skin of kabocha becomes tender enough to eat. There's no need to skin the squash (which is difficult, given the uneven surface). Instead of boiling/steaming as this recipe instructs, roast slices of kabocha (halve squash, scoop out seeds, then slice each half into 1.5"-2" curves) on a greased baking sheet, covered with foil, at 375 degrees until tender (35-45 min). Pure deliciousness. Nothing extra needed.
