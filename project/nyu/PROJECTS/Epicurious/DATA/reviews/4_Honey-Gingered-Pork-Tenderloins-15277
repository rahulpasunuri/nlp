This recipe made for an excellent first go, and then we used the leftovers the next day to top Super Asian Slaw (this site). We liked the pork in the salad even better than we did having the pork alone.

I rarely disagree with the prevailing views, but in this case, we just didn't care for the flavor. I don't know why this didn't click for us, but we always celebrate our differences!

This is, in my opinion, the perfect pork tenderloin recipe. Double the marinade ingredients and serve half as a side sauce. Emma Whitlock won first prize for this recipe in 1994? I've been using this exact recipe since 1990, when it was published in Southern Living's Five-Star Recipe Collection (1990, Oxmoor House, Inc.)

Really delicious even for my picky eaters. Did not have oyster sauce so subbed 1/8 c. additional soy sauce plus 1/8 c. water. Used 1 tsp. ground ginger in place of fresh.

This is my favorite recipe for pork tenderloin. The marinade is just delicious. I cook it down to a sauce and serve it with a wild rice casserole. I also bake in a 425 degree oven for about 30 minutes.

The flavors mix very well together. I found it easier to prevent burning by using indirect heat. I have a gas grill with 3 burners so I turned the center one off. The tenderloin was cooked perfectly.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and found it perfect. I wouldn't change a single thing. I will say, as others have, that you need to be careful with grilling as the sugars in the marinade will burn rather quickly. I served it with a parsley/pine nut rice and grilled asparagus.

Terrific flavor, but needs to be moved around the grill often and quickly to prevent the sugar from burning.

This was different, but very good. The mix of sweet and spicy was very nice. I omitted the oyster sauce and rather than using onion powder, I used an envelope of lipton dry onion soup mix. I also used ginger powder rather than fresh. I doubled the marinade and poured it over 2 pork tenderloins in the crock pot and cooked on low for ~6 hours. It was very tender... and very tasty! I served it with jasmine rice and used the extra marinade on the rice.

Rating: 4
Fantastic flavor. Served a dinner of ten and tripled the recipe. Doubled up on the garlic and ginger and marinaded for two days. I then grilled over indirect heat. I boiled the sauce down and served on top of the pork. Everyone raved on this. It is in the Hall of Fame in my book! Excellent!

Rating: 4
I have been making this since the recipe was published, and have tried many variations. I have to say though, that the original recipe is still the best one. I wouldn't recommend omitting the oyster sauce. You won't actually be able to pick out the oyster sauce as an ingredient in the sauce, but it gives a great tang to the finished product, and keeps the pork from being too sweet. We bbq this indirect so the sugars in the marinade don't burn. Excellent dish! Try serving it with the toasted garlic rice from this site, or with a cold soba noodle salad for an easy and summery dinner party menu.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe no less than a dozen times so it must be good. I always reduce the marinade for a sauce (but don't overcook until it becomes a sludge). Served with the coconut-gingerroot rice and carrots or sweet potato and it makes a wonderful, easy and impressive dinner for guests or family!

Rating: 4
Excellent! Also, you can use turkey tenderloins instead of pork if you or your guests do not eat pork. It is almost as good and beats not being able to serve the dish!

One of our favorites especially for company. I've never used the oyster sauce, have fudged the marinade ingrediants when needed, and sometimes had less than 8 hrs marinating - still delicious every time. Last nite I squeezed in some orange juice - which gave me more marinade w/o being orange-y. I serve this over jasmine rice w/ veggies steamed w/garlic and ginger w/the cooked marinade drizzled over. Sprinkle chopped cashews and scallions over top. Always a hit!

We had a large party of 150+ and used this recipe. We got rave reviews and many requests for the recipe. Because of time constraints, we marinated the meat for close to 36 hours in the refrig. and grilled them the morning of the party, refrigerated them, and served them at room temp that evening. The next day they were equally tasty. We made extra sauce and drizzled it over the meat platter to serve in a buffet line. We used it on chichen but only marinated it a short time. It will become a staple in our recipe file!!

Delicious! Served for Father's Day at my in- laws and everyone loved it! I prepared a day ahead and let it marinade overnight. I followed the recipe as written, except I used 1/4 of the amount of oyster sauce, and doubled the garlic and ginger as suggested. The pork was great, but when putting the reserved marinade over the top, the ginger was a little strong for my taste so will probably not double it next time. I also cooked the reserved marinade before serving. Served it with grilled pineapple, and the roasted vidalia onion and cherry tomato salad from this site.

Rating: 3
We tried this out before making it for guests. We thought it was good - not four fork good, but certainly worth making again. A couple of weeks later, we had a dinner party and felt the simplicity of the dish made it worth serving. I have to say, the guests raved. While I found it to be 2.5 forks, I gave it 3 because of the response of the guests and it was something I could prepare easily without leaving my guests for too long. Btw, since I didn't use the oyster sauce for the test run, I didn't use it for the dinner party. Next time, just for kicks, I'll try it with the oyster sauce. No doubt we will serve this to company at least once or twice more over the holidays.

Although my husband raved over this pork, I thought it was good but just couldn't go for 3 forks. Tasty and slightly sweet, but it just didn't wow me.

This dish is wonderful -- the pork is succulent and the sauce, fabulous. Took some tips from previous reviewers and added lime juice & roasted sesame oil to marinade as well as twice the amount of garlic & ginger and marinated for 24 hours. You should completely remove marinade clinging to pork before grilling. Also make more marinade if you need, so you have enough sauce to brush on AFTER grilling and to pass.

Rating: 4
This really is a terrific way to make a pork loin. As others have said, a 24-hour (or longer) marinade is the key. I added some lime to the marinade, doubled the ginger and garlic, used some fresh red onion instead of powder, and skipped the oyster sauce. We served this with grilled cherry tomatoes and a wild rice pilaf -- great matches. Also, a generous serving of yoghurt and fresh herb sauce in (addition to the reserved and reduced marinade) -- both sauces were hits. Went brilliantly with a full French chardonnay, but could have also been matched with a summer red. We will definitely repeat this one!

Rating: 4
This was excellent! I used dried, ground ginger and forgot the onion powder and it was still great. I marinated it in a Ziploc bag for 8 hours and it had plenty of flavor. We cooked it over indirect BBQ heat for about 20 minutes. Served w/ asparagus roasted w/ a bit of olive oil & kosher salt at 475 for 13 minutes. My daughters (normally picky, ages 9 & 10) loved it. Will absolutely make it again; it's even dinner-party worthy.

Relatively easy to make and I don't think you can find a more flavorful marinade to complement a pork tenderloin.

Pork tenders usually come two in a pack. I double the recipe. Put one tender in the frig to marinate overnight and freeze the other. The key is to let the meat marinate in the sauce for at least 36 hours. It makes a difference. This recipe also makes a great shrimp marinade. For shrimp, we marinate for 1 1/2 hours then grill. Both ways, it's GREAT! I recently served this with the GRATIN OF YUKON GOLD POTATOES, BACON AND ARUGULA recipe from this site. YUMMY!

i trippled the ginger and garlic and marinated overnight. be careful when grilling as the marinade burns easily. next time i may omit either some honey or brown sugar as its sweet enough. didn't have oyster sauce so used hoison which might be why mine was sweeter but all in all a nice marinade. skip the coconut ginger rice, not worth the effort. i served this with the cucumber, pinnapple and jalepeno salad from this site which was great!

this was a very easy dish to prepare. i dont have a grill so i just stuck it in the oven and then boiled the rest of the sauce and poured it over the sliced pork. i thought there was too much sauce just to throw away, so i would recommend that others also save it. everyone liked it, even the very picky 6 year old. i will definitely make this again.

I have made this without the oyster sauce and onion powder (in fact I never use onion powder) and it's just as yummy. I pour off the marinade into a small saucepan and boil it gently until thickened to make a sauce to serve with the grilled tenderloin, which I cook for 25 minutes or so, turning once, under the oven grill. And yes, everyone asks for this recipe!

Rating: 4
This is delicious! Guests always lick their fingers and ask for the recipe. I think marinating the tenderloin for a full 24 hours is the difference between a good tenderloin and a GREAT one. Note: since I never have fish/oyster sauce, I usually substitute a blend of vermouth, lemon juice and olive oil, which seems to work just fine! ENJOY!

Rating: 4
I had the tenderloin, but I didn't have the time to marinate. Instead I doubled the recipe and poured the marinade over the tenderloin in a baking pan, cooked for 35 minutes in 400 degree oven, turned the meat and cooked for 35 minutes more. It was superb, and oh so tender. I get the feeling you can't go wrong with this recipe as many people have used different methods and it always comes out great.

These were excellent. I did not have oyster sauce so I used Hoison, as another reveiwer recommended. {Because Hoison is sweet, I omitted brown sugar.} It marinated for 3 days, but because I 4x'd the recipe, I froze the other 3 tenderloins in the marinade. They were even better after freezing! For a sauce I saved the marinade, added water/boiled/strained. I also added the meat juices to the sauce after the meat had rested for 5-10 minutes. It was very tasty. (I grated my ginger--might reduce the amount a bit next time.)

Excellent recipe! Grilled on a gas barbeque with great results - meat was moist, tender and very flavourful, especially on the outside crust. My 25 year old son said this was the best pork tenderloin he has even eaten! Due to time constraints, I only marinated for 8 hours, so think it would be even better if marinated longer. I did make some changes: added juice of 1 lime and 2 Tbsp sesame oil to the marinade, also increased garlic and ginger by one half. I think the acid in the lime juice helped to tenderize the meat considerably. It seems that pork these days is so lean and lacking in fat marbling that it is often fairly tough. Like others, I added water and boiled the marinade for 5 minutes, then used for basting while grilling as well as for a sauce served with the finished meat. Big smiles all around and not a bite left!!!

I expected this to be good based upon previous reviews and I was not disappointed. Thanks to all reviewers! I wouldn't normally have given this a try...it sounded like it would be too sweet, but it wasn't.

I also boiled the marinade and served as extra sauce (which was great over white rice by the way).

This is an outstanding recipe for pork tenderloin. I only marinaded the pork for two hours and the flavors were still excellent.

Simply THE best recipe for pork tenderloins I've ever found. I heat my griddle pan grill-side up in the oven to 450 and cook for 3-4 turns at 3-5 minutes each side, then rest for 5. Don't have oyster sauce, so have used teriyaki or hoisin sauce - works great. Juicy, tender, foolproof and delicious! Nuke the sauce. Excellent with jasmine rice and chinese style veggies.

Rating: 4
This was a great recipe...so tender you could cut with fork. I roasted it in the oven at 425 (about 30 min.),and used about a tablespoon of minced onion because I did not have onion powder. I did double the sauce and added water to half of it and cooked down to a nice glaze. The best part is usually I used left over pork for bbq sandwiches, but the second day I wrapped the leftover tenderloin in foil and warmed in oven. I served with sweet potatoes and broccoli and it tasted almost better than first day...the sauce had a better consistency the second day.

I love this dish and so does my picky boyfriend. I was nervous because he doesn't like any dishes that seem too sweet. This dish seemed to have the perfect blend of spices to offset the sweetener and entice him. I baked the dish carefully not to waste any marinade and served it over some baked squash for myself and over a bed of plain rice for him. I have made this 6 times in about the last six weeks. He keeps asking for it and our house guests keep raving about it.

It was raining, so I broiled my tenderloins indoors in the oven. I basted with the marinade every 3 minutes, turning a 1/4 turn each time. Probably cooked for 20 minutes. Use a meat thermometer at the end to check to see if meat is done. Didn't want the meat to blacken too much, so popped the meat into the microwave for one minute each to finish. (140 ndegrees) Meat came out very tender and juicy. Heated the leftover marinade in the MW for 2 minutes, and served on the side as a sauce. Got raves.

My dining companion rated this a 4, and I would have given it a 3 except that the pork was the tenderest we've ever tasted, so I upgraded to a 4. I can't determine whether the tenderness was due to the marinating or to the quality of the pork itself. As did others, I added water to the remaining marinade and reduced it to a slightly syrupy consistency for use as a sauce. Because the sauce is strongly flavored, little is needed on the pork slices. I halved the recipe as I was cooking for just two people, and even then, we had half of the one pork tenderloin remaining. I used the rest in a Vietnamese-type salad. A word on marinating: I marinate at room temperature in a covered dish unless I marinate overnight, in which case I refrigerate the product. I'm not recommending my procedure, but since my home is kept at an even 70 degrees, this works well for me, and I believe that less time is required. I also always make sure that my meat, fish or poultry is at room temperature before cooking. I think it reacts better to the cooking heat that way. Instead of firing up the grill, I roasted this pork tenderloin at 425 degrees, testing often to retain moisture in the meat, and leaving the center slightly pink.

I made this recipe for the first time when I had guests last weekend. I wasn't sure about it--never had put Oyster Sauce in anything before--but it was a rave! I reduced the sauce and served it on the side, and the flavor was perky and spunky. Not too hot, but just right. There was leftover sauce, and, for the next night, when we did filet mignon for dinner, one of my guests asked if we could reheat this sauce and have it with the steaks. I was happy to oblige, and, when he ate his steak with dabs of the sauce, I was tickled at the happy look on his face. This is a keeper!

This recipe was fantastic. I did not find the marinade to be overwhelming at all. In fact, I loved the way it became crunchy and caramelized on the grill. Like the previous reviewer, I reduced the remaining marinade and served the sauce on the side. That way people could have as much or as little as they wanted. My husband, who generally doesn't like sweet sauces, went back to add sauce to his portion. He also asked when I would be making this again.

I started marinating the pork on Friday night for a Saturday dinner with friends. At the last minute we had a change of plans, and weren't able to cook it until Monday.

Good but no better than several other grilled pork tenderloin recipes I've made. Pork tenderloin is just very difficult to mess up on the grill. When I made this one, the grill ran out of gas during the cooking and it took a while to get a new tank attached - despite the interupted cooking and guessing on timing the pork was still tender, moist and very flavorful.

I am not a meat eater, however I made this for my husband and friends, a very critical group, and received RAVE reviews.

Very different. We marinated the pork for 2 nights, due to time constraints, and the flavor was super. I mixed up an extra half recipe of marinade for my bacteria-phobic husband, set that half aside in the fridge, and, when it came time to eat, heated it up in a small saucepan and drizzled over the meat. This is very similar to a marinade I make for chicken (just honey, ginger, garlic and soy sauce). I couldn't taste the oyster sauce, so when I run out, I'll probably just use my old marinade for this. Overall, it was tasty, and we both enjoyed it.

Based on the rave reviews, I gave this recipe a try and was not disappointed. I've made a similar version for years (with sesame oil in place of the oyster sauce), but I think this is even better.

I was a little leary of boiling the marinade and using it, but I did it anyway and am still here to talk about it! :) Yummy!

Being that I don't eat pork, I substituted a turkey breast. Absolutely outstanding! My guests LOVED it. I doubled the sauce and boiled it to use as a gravy. My guests sopped up the extra gravy with their bread! I'll definitely make this again and will probably try it with chicken and/or a brisket roast.

My husband raved about this recipe. It halves beautifully for two people. Thickened the marinade for sauce as suggested.

I loved this recipe. I added more brown sugar than it ask for. I marinated the pork over 24 hrs. It was so moist, sweet and spicy.

This dish was fabulous. I loved grilling it, the aroma was wonderful, The pork turned out very moist and flavorful. I boiled the marinade and drizzled it on top of the pork . . . my fiancee loved it. This recipe is definately a keeper.

Very good and very easy. Used turkey tenderloin with great success!

Quite good. I found that the outside got charred a bit because we basted with the marinade (sugar). Next time I'll just grill after marinating and then boil marinade and serve as a sauce on the side.

This is a good recipe for a pork tenderloin. The marinade permeates the meat well in a relatively short time (I put mine in the marinade after breakfast and then cooked that night), and the basting while barbecuing left a nice sweet outside coating. I particularly liked how the ginger flavor came through and was not overwhelmed by the other ingredients.

This recipe was a wonderful combination of ease of preparation and great results. The tenderloins smelled great while grilling and the taste did not disappoint. My dinner guests raved - I will definitely make this recipe again.

Fabulous & easy...just marinate & you are done! I doubled the marinade & will use on chops or chicken in the next few days.

This is the best recipe ever for pork tenderloin! I cooked it to an internal temperature of 145 degrees and then let it rest for 5 minutes to let the juices go back into the meat. This resulted in a very moist, perfectly cooked pork. After I took the tenderloins out of the marinade, I added 1/2 cup of water to it and boiled it for 5 minutes in order to serve it as a sauce along side the cooked meat. This sauce makes the dish!! Next time I think I'll double the marinade to make more sauce...it's that good. It's hard to believe that this is so delicious and low fat. Leftovers are just as good too. I e-mailed it to all my friends as soon as I finished eating.

I used thick pork chops for this recipe, and it turned out great. I let them marinate all day, so the flavor was really really nice when we finally had them for dinner. I was VERY happy with this recipe.

I thought this was excellent, my husband, on the other hand' rated this "okay" he said it had too much of a "candy" taste to it. I fully intend to make it again, perhaps he will acquire a taste for it.

This marinade kept the pork extremely juicy. We let it marinate for a full day and were very pleased with the results. Great sweet flavor!

Outstanding!!! Serving the reserved marinade as a sauce is critical to this recipe's success. (Remember to bring to a boil first) Would give 5 forks if I could. HAD to e-mail this one to all my foodie friends.

Fabulous. As a change of pace, my wife and I made this for some friends who came over for a barbecue. It went over very well! One word of warning: Don't overestimate how long your tenderloins need to cook, especially on a hot fire. In retrospect, I wish I would have cooked ours a few minutes less; they would have been a tad juicier.

This recipe is great! I made it for a birthday celebration, and it was a big sucess. I substituted ground ginger for fresh - and was very pleased with the results. I also boiled the marinade and served it as a dipping sauce. This has become a new standard in my kitchen.

I get many recipes from Epicurios and have never reviewed one. I knew this would be good from the # of excellent reviews. I was right it was simply outstanding. I am making it again this weekend for a new crowd. Thanks, it was truly amazing!

One of the Best recipes for Grilling Pork Tenderloins that I've come across. (And we've done quite a few.) I kept to the recipe, and didn't experiment. I don't see any need for change the next time. Rave reviews from guests. Definitely a repeater.

This was very tender and very, very tasty! I reserved about 1/3 of the sauce before marinating the pork, thinned it as another cook suggested, and cooked it slightly, to serve as a sauce. I wouldn't change a thing! It was very easy to make. Keep an eye on your thermometer, though. I think cooking the tenderloin to 155 would have overcooked the meat. I stopped at 145, and it was perfect - thoroughly cooked, not pink, but still juicy. You definitely want to try this one.

Since this is the absolute best pork recipe I have ever found, I give it 4 forks!!!!!How do you improve on perfection. My family loves this one!!

Quite excellent although the next time I make this dish, I will reduce the cinnamon by half. My guest loved it so much that he took the recipe home. Even with all the ginger and garlic, it's not overpowering. The flavors meld quite nicely and give an elegant presentation. I will definitely make this again.

I buy extra bottles of oyster sauce when I get to the Asian grocer because our small town grocery doesn't carry it. That way, I can give a bottle away to the those who request the recipe. One Christmas, we purchased pork tenderloins and the marinade ingredients and gave to our closet friends. This is one of the very best recipes I make.

Very easy and quite tasty! We really like the way the marinade coated and carmelized on the pork as it cooked. I did leave out the brown sugar as I am not the biggest fan of "sweet" on meats. I really like the healthfulness of the marinade. Would be great served with a roasted in the shell corn on the cob and fresh salad.

This recipe was fabulous. I would have given it a four fork rating, but then there would be no room for improvement! I cooked the pork loins over charcoal at our cottage on the ocean. Everybody drooled. I recommend adding a bit of water or chicken stock to the marinade when the pork is removed, then boil/simmer the marinade to make a lovely sauce to drizzle. Delicious served with simple stir fry veggies and a rice pilaf.

In a word "fabulous" great blend of flavors. I would most definetly make it again. I roasted it in the oven at 400 degrees 30-45 minutes until the internal temp was 155.

This recipe was absolutely awesome. I took the adventurous step of making this for the first time for a dinner party. My guests raved and all asked for the recipe. Needless to say, there were no leftovers!

This is absolutely wonderful! I roasted this in the oven at 425, pulling it out every 8-12 minutes or so to baste with the marinade. It took about 35-40 minutes to cook - but be careful not to overcook it. If you choose to have a sauce, make more marinade, add some water and don't let it boil too much, otherwise the spices could get too concentrated. I will be making this over and over again - I highly recommend it!

Definitely a dish I will make again and again! I grilled it until it reached 150F since it continues to cook after you take it off the grill. Moist and succulent!

This was so easy to prepare. The color is deep and the flavor so rich, I complemented it with an Asian spinach-stem sunomono with sesame seed and rice vinegar dressing. The little bit left over had to be sequestered or I'd never have gotten a second-day taste! Rice is a good bed.

I mesquite charcoal grilled this entree at a recent party for 30 people and could not cook the six tenderloins fast enough. Everyone raved! I did substitute "Pickapeppa" sauce for the ketchup & cayenne. I also marinated the tenderloins for 36 hours and was able to dispense with basting the tenderloins while grilling them but I only did this for convenience.

This was great! My father even liked it, and that is rare if it is not one of the old standbys that my mom used to make. I had to use what I had in the house, and I don't even know what oyster sauce is, so needless to say, I left that out! It was still wonderful. No complaints about leftovers this time!!

This is really, really good! I copied it into my recipe book as soon as I put my fork down.

This was a quick, wonderful marinade. The end result was a tender tenderloin with a slightly crispy, sweet basting. I'll be making it again for a camping trip this weekend. I'll knock their socks off!!!

This dish is absolutely outstanding! Four adults wiped out over two pounds of pork tenderloin and would have probably ate more if there had been some. I rarely give recipe's four forks at this site, but this one deserves it. We will definitely make this again....and soon.
