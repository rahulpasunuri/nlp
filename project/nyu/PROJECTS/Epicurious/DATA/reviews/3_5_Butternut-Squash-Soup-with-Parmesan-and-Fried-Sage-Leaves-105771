I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a little nutmeg, heavy cream and heavy handed with the parmesan cheese. Very easy, very good.

Decent foundation recipe. I read through the reviews and ended up frying three smoked bacon strips which I used to saute the onions and sage. Tossed out the fat and swirled in some whipping cream left over from the holidays. Added nutmeg and voila (!) really enjoyed the changes. The three forks are for the recipe as written. Super easy.

This is a decent tasting soup, but could be so much tastier. I added double the sage (unfried), double the cheese, cumin and cayenne, and that saved the flavor - otherwise it was far too bland. Do not use fresh chicken broth - tastes too much like chicken! LOL. Use veggie broth instead for a more squash-tasting creation. Toasted pepitas make a great touch on top too. Immersion blender does the trick - no need to make it more complicated. Gets a B for easy-ness, a C+ for flavor, and a B+ for texture.

First tried the recipe precisely as written and I did find it too bland. Gave it 4 stars after tweeking: sauteed garlic, 2 T cognac, nutmeg and a healthy grinding of freshly ground black peppper. Add parmesan crisps with the fried sage leaves. Delish!

I omitted the cheese and added nutmeg, a quarter cup of heavy cream and a couple of tablespoons of brandy...also substituted milder pineapple sage. An emersion blender works fine and reduces clean-up. This is a lovely soup. Good enough for company and easy enough to prepare whenever.

Love this simple and quick recipe. It's even faster when you have an immersion blender. I didn't have sage leaves so I just added a little nutmeg and was generous with the black pepper (which I love). This is mild light soup. I will try using veggie broth next time like others have suggested. A great base recipe that you can adjust based on your tastes.

Rating: 4
Some reviewers say this is a bland soup. I would call it mild and exactly as expected. It has a lovely butternut squash taste, if that's not what you're looking for, try a different recipe. I used vegetarian broth and instead of incorporating the Parmesan cheese, I just sprinkled it on top with the fried sage leaves. This has a lovely flavor, perfect for a winter afternoon.

Recipe as written is bland. Followed some of the other reviewers advice. Added head of garlic, two bay leaves and fresh grated nutmeg. Used parmesan rinds as well. Also added back the butter that the sage was toasted in. Yummy.

Agree totally with other reviews - veggie broth is MUCH better. Add a nice tart apple to the mix for a wonderful variation!

the sage is a perfect pairing with in-season squash. a word of warning: a used homemade chicken broth which was TOO chicken-y! use either canned (as the recipe suggests) or veggie broth to make this a veggie soup.

Modified slightly...changed to veg broth to make vegetarian. Also, chopped up the sage leaves rather than frying whole leaves. Simple yet great flavor. Perfect for winter and in season.

I have been making this soup for years now, and look forward to it every fall. It is simple and perfect in both preparation in taste, even without the fried sage leaves or parmesan. In fact, I have never added the parmesan! Wonderful with homemade croutons.

I made this recipe as specified to start with (save for frying up some bacon for garnish and using the grease from that to start the onions). At the end, gave it a taste. Not a fan - too dull flavored. I ended up throwing in garlic, salt, pepper, onion powder, and nutmeg. At that point, I enjoyed it a bit more but my husband didn't even finish. Won't make again.

Rating: 3
This recipe is quite simple and tasty. If you want to taste squash and sage, its great and not at all bland. It reminds me of butternut squash ravioli in a bowl. After frying the sage leaves, I reserved the sage infused brown butter and drizzled on top of the bowls. It looks nice and added some flavor depth. I've also tried making this with frozen pureed squash and it tasted great and took no time at all.

Like others, I adjusted this having read that it was bland. I incorporated some ideas from the 'Farmhouse' butternut squash soup recipe that came up on the same search page here by adding some garlic, fresh thyme sprigs, a few tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, and a bit of caraway seed. I also added a bay leaf (which I removed before it hit the blender, along with the thyme sprigs), and some cinnamon and nutmeg. After pureeing it and returning it to the pot, a taste test revealed that I perhaps hadn't left the squash on the vine out in the compost pile long enough to ripen, as it lacked the sweetness of butternut squash. I compensated with a bit of brown sugar, which I balanced out with a couple pinches of cayenne pepper. I salted and peppered to taste, and ate it. It was excellent- a perfect lunch on this cool and rainy September afternoon here in New England.

Rating: 4
Also, I agree with another reviewer that you should start with less broth.

Rating: 4
I made adjustments because other reviewers thought it was bland-- I cooked it in a crock pot with a Parmesan rind which infused the whole batch with subtle Parmesaney goodness. I added garlic to the onions. I used kosher salt. It came out absolutely delicious. I didn't need anything else to sweeten it, so maybe I just got a good squash. The parm and fried sage make this recipe sing. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 2
I thought that this recipe was quite bland prior to some adjustments that I made. Even then, it was above average at best. I roasted the squash as well as the garlic and added some nutmeg, cinnamon, and brown sugar to sweeten it. The parmesan and sage gave it the savory taste I was looking for but it needed some sweetness, I thought, to balance it. I don't know if I would make this again...I would definitely try to continue to tweak it.

Rating: 4
This was easier to do than I had suspected. I didn't have fresh sage so I just sprinkled some ground, dried sage into the soup after it was blended. Everyone loved this. It tasted just as good as the same soup I'd had at a 5 star restaurant previously.

I first learned about this soup at a cooking club my friends and I held years ago. Since then I've made it every year for Thanksgiving and it is always a big hit. I recommend adding more cheese than the recipe calls for.

Rating: 3
I prefer flash frying the sage leaves - I feel that it retains the flavor better and makes them nice and crispy. Heat safflower oil until hot and toss the leaves in for just a few seconds, remove and place on crumpled paper towel to absorb excess oil. Yummy!

Rating: 4
I thought this was exceptional but only with some modifications. I followed the precise recipe, but then mashed the mixture with a potatoe masher instead of blending, added the cheese, salt and pepper and thought it tasted mighty bland. Added some more cheese but it was still needed something else. To me, it was screaming out for some curry, so added curry powder to taste - maybe 1 1/2 tsps. or so. Then is was wonderful. Loved the fried sage as a garnish. The family raved.

Rating: 2
I made a lot of changes which is why I rated a 2. I roasted cubes of the squash with a small sweet onion and shallot in oil, fresh sage, salt, and pepper for 30min at 400 degrees. I blended this all with homemade chicken stock. I left the soup somewhat chunky and loved the consistency. Topped off with the fried sage and chopped toasted hazelnuts....yum!

Rating: 4
This is a great, easy recipe. The only change I would make is to add less broth in the beginning, and if you find the soup too thick, then add more broth until you get the right consistency...or if you have time, you can just let the soup simmer without a cover and eventually the water will boil away. Most of the time when I make this recipe, I don't use a blender. Instead, I just use a potato masher and mush the squash in the pot. The best part of the recipe is the fried sage and parmesan, so don't skimp! I practically burn the sage to a dark brown, and it is so delicious. I make this every Thanksgiving, and it's always a hit.

Rating: 3
The parmesean cheese was an ingedient I was skeptical about, but it was delicious. I made this with vegetable stock vs. chicken broth. I baked the squash & the onion in the oven which is quicker & easier. (I quartered the onion, drizzled with olive oil & wrapped in foil. It makes the onion very easy to deal with.) That said, I used a red onion and I felt the onion overpowered the butternut. My fault...I think doing the same roasting technique using a sweet onion or shallots would serve the soup much better. Live & learn! The other comment is that the recipe does not specify whether or not to chop the sage leaves when browning them in butter. Since I grow my own sage and had plenty I prepared it both ways. The whole leaves make for an interesting presentation, but the chopped are much tastier in the soup.

Rating: 4
I made this exactly as written the first time with rave reviews. My only addition was a dollup of creme fraiche, then the fried sage leaves...a nice touch. I've just made it again and this time, I added a bit more sage to punch up the flavor. I'm freezing it and will re-heat for Christmas dinner's first course. Easy!

I didn't have a problem with the cheese. Truthfully, I couldn't really taste it. I really liked this recipe because it's much healthier (without all of the heavy cream) and it's quick. I'll definitely make it again.

Very nice, simple soup. I changed its character completely by forgetting the cheese and fried sage at the end, and adding a bit of heavy cream and the apple-cider-cream suggested by another user. "boiling down a cup of apple cider to reduce it to about three or four tablespoons and then stir it into either creme fraiche or sour cream" It was completely delicious in a sweet, creamy way. Great with lots of bread.

Sage butter and winter squash is such an unbeatable combination. I choose Buttercup squash. I roasted it in the oven, then added it to the onion/sage with chicken broth with a dash of nutmeg. Parmesean cheese was not necessary. Rather, drizzle the sage butter over each bowl of soup as a delicious garnish.

Rating: 4
Easy. I followed the oven roasting suggestions and roasted the onion, 1/2 bulb of garlic and a large butternut squash at 400 degrees for 40 min. To do this, I sliced the squash diagonally in 3 inch slices and put it on a cookie sheet with a tad of water - and lightly covered it with aluminum foil. I wrapped the onion and garlic individually in foil. Cut the onion in 4ths and left the garlic whole in the bulb. Once cooked, I peeled the squash - easy! Popped the onion out of it's skin and the garlic cloves out of the bulb into a blender. I added a little bit of the broth and blended. I had to repeated blending a couple of times with squash and broth, adding two peeled oranges to the last batch - with 6 sage leaves. I mixed it all together. Added the rest of the broth, cheese and 1/4 cup of white wine when I reheated it the next day. Superb and VERY easy.

I made this this weekend! It was excellent! The only thing I did not do was the fried sage - got lazy at the end! I also added 1 large garlic clove! It was fantastic and better the next day!

Fabulous with some alterations: Use 4 cups chicken broth, 1/2 cup pulpy orange juice, 1/2 cup dry white wine. Bake the squash and onion in a 400 degree oven, blend cooked squash, onion, liquid and three cloves of garlic. Only use aged cheese, not the kind you get pregrated.

I'm a graduate student who can't cook to save her life, but this recipe was very easy to follow! I roasted the squash at 350 for about an hour beforehand, which made it much easier to remove the peel. I added 5oz heavy cream as someone else suggested. Also, I more than doubled the cheese, and it was absolutely delicious. Makes lots of leftovers for those of us whose time is limited.

I made this soup for a benefit dinner that I hosted last month for 80 individuals. The soup was the talk of the night. One of the guests described it as "hevenly" and there was not one non-empty bowl. Some changes that I made to the recipe were: I roasted the squash for 35 minutes inthe oven before adding them to the onions. I used vegetable broth (this makes in vegetarian) I used 5 oz. of heavy cream to thicken up the soup. It is going to be increadibly hard trying to top this soup next year.

This is truly delightful. I added my own twist by first roasting the squash with butter, S&P and garlic cloves. I added a touch of cinnamon when sauteing the onions, and a bit at the end. I garnished with the fried sage leaves and "fried" parmesan pieces. DELICIOUS!!!

Rating: 3
Really delicious, and simple. I followed the recipe pretty closely, just adding a few cloves of chopped garlic with the chopped sage. I only had about 2 1/4 lbs squash, so used only 4 cups chicken broth. The fried sage leaves were delicious, too (and not bitter at all).

Nice enough, but not terribly exciting. The fried sage leaves were bitter. This only made enought for six small servings. I added a big dollop of Greek yogurt to the leftovers and that was some improvement, but the soup just failed to excite.

I can't say enough good things about this recipe. Perfect for fall. I agree with the cook, below, who suggests adding a parmesan rind for additional flavor. You can also vary this by adding a little finely chopped rosemary and thyme to the sage. Flavors are sensational--my family loved this.

I wanted to join the chorus of praise for this simple soup. To raise it from delicious to sublime, I threw in a parmesan rind with the stock and then removed it before pureeing. A normally taciturn guest was full of praise and then yesterday at a large luncheon featuring many soups, this one elicited the most praise.

Rating: 4
This soup is beautiful and delicious just as written; I never change a thing. It is the perfect dinner party soup for a fall evening, as it can be prepared entirely ahead, except for the fried sage leaves. By the way, they are a lovely addition, but unnecessary in a pinch.

This soup was fast and easy to make. It was impressive and I will consider serving this at Thanksgiving. I do think a bit of cream might be good in it as well, and I would put in more than 5 cups of squash, probably 6. Also, carmelinzing the onions as someone suggested was very tasty.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I used all of the ingredients listed in the recipe but modified the amounts. I had a large Butternut Squash so used it (about 4 lbs)keeping the onion amount the same I caramelized them for a rich flavor, added more sage (about 1/2 again as much) and added the butter used to crisp the sage leaves. It was rich, elegant, outstanding!! Everyone loved it. This will be a Thanksgiving starter from now on as well as a fall staple in our household.

The first time I tried this I liked it but didn't love it. I loved the Winter Squash soup with GRUYERE CROUTONS on this site & thought this just didn't compare... However, because I just love squash soup & usually have most of these ingredients in my house, I tried this again and loved it. (Apparently the parmesan I used the last time just wasn't up to par.) Oh, and the fresh sage sauted crisps are great!!! ... By the way you can make these by putting the butter & sage leaves in a bowl & microwave them for about 30 sec.'s until they are crisp.

I was intrigued by the idea of a gourd soup. The first time I made this recipe my wife thought it was a bowl of cheese - she's not that smart so I told her it was cheese. She was confused but in the end really liked it. The next week she asked for me to make the recipe again. This time I substituted the squash with watermelon and garnished with frosting, served in piping hot mugs next to a warm fire. I recommend the nice mugs and warm fire, but use real melon (not watermelon) and forgo the frosting. Cheers!

This soup was terrific. I didn't bother with the fried sage leaves. Also, after pureeing in the food processor, I drained out some of the liquid and added about 1/2 cup brown sugar before returning the soup to the pot. It defintiely didn't make 8 servings but it was delicious and easy!

For those of you who don't care for the fried sage leaves as a garnish, try boiling down a cup of apple cider to reduce it to about three or four tablespoons and then stir it into either creme fraiche or sour cream. Makes a beautful garnish when drizzled into soup.

The sage was very interesting. I liked it mixed into the soup, but don't think I would do the fried sage leaves next time, the flavor was a bit overpower and bitter (although they might be better if it was chopped leaves, rather than huge, overpowering whole leaves). I added the parmesan cheese and liked it, but didn't actually taste the cheese that much, so you could probably leave it out ok. I also added sherry and that was delicious. Overall it was a rich, slightly sweep soup, very good.

Rating: 3
I thought this soup was very good. Would definitely make it again. The sage is a nice garnish. While I don't agree with some of the previous reviewers negative comments about the parmesan, the soup certainly tasted OK prior to adding it. In order to avoid cleaning an extra dish, I sauteed the sage first in the stock pot and set it aside, rather than doing it after the soup in another pan as the recipe directs.

Rating: 3
This recipe is a little bland. Try adding 1/2 cup tomato sauce and a little lemon juice for acidity plus a dash or two of cayenne and white pepper. Just before service stir 1 tablespoon of dry sherry into each bowl and top it off with a dollop of sour cream. The soup is transformed into an elegant dish deserving of four forks.

Rating: 3
Yum! Tasty served with dollop of full-fat yogurt or sour cream. Omitted the parmesan and added just a few Tbsp of cream to the blended soup. The sage flavour in the soup is great, but the fried sage leaves tasted and smelled a bit burnt. Omitted them when heating up as leftovers and didn't miss them. On blending the soup may seem too watery, but don't worry - texture will be perfect once completely blended and re-warmed.

Easy to peel Squash.....bake for 35 minutes in a 400 degree oven. Run under cold water briefly and it peels off easily. I added 2 T of Butter and 4 T of Whipped Cream and it was fabulous, with a much better texture. Instead of using an upright blender with hot liquids, try a hand blender straight into the hot soup pot. Cheers!

I just finished the last serving of this incredibly delicious soup. The texture is light and luxurious, the flavor is rich and savory, and the garnish of sage leaves are a crispy delight. I agree with another reviewer's comment on number of servings.....it's more like 3 or 4, definitely not 8. I added more parmesan, just because I'm crazy about it, and about 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes for a little kick. I could live on this soup.....and will make it again and again.....it could be a meal in itself, or a starter for an elegant dinner. The only downside is that I hate peeling squash.
