This was delicious! I used a dash of soy sauce as well to add a little saltiness. The fried shallots were particularly tasty.

I loved the crispy shallots, but overall it was too oily. I'll definately dump most of the oil before putting in the garlic and bok choi next time.

Yummy. Quick. Easy. A wonderful bok choy recipe to have on hand.

Something I never would have thought of before. The fried shallots are amazing, and I often make them alone as snacky food. Would never have thought to put these together, but they work really well. Excellent side for miso glazed salmon.

This was a nice alternative to other ways I have made bok choy...I also only used 4 tbsp olive oil instead of the full cup of vegetable oil and it was plenty. We enjoyed it and it was easy....

I, too, didn't use all that oil. I also subed sunflower & toasted sesame oil for the oil called for. Forgot to add the garlic (doh) and added it once I've turned the heat off. It still cooked with all the heat/steam from the bok choy. I served with rice noodles and some toasted sesame oil. It was nice and light, nothing exceptional.

I was looking for a recipe for bok choy... something simple yet tasty. This one met my needs! It made bok choy an actual request in my home... highly recommend. Also tasty with lots of minced garlic added!

Easy to make with lots of flavour. I did not use a cup of vegetable oil. Used 4 Tbsps olive oil instead. The shallots were a very nice finishing touch. Served with Spicy Thai Thighs, Jasmine Rice with Coriander. An easy meal with nice complimentary flavors.

Delicious and creative! This added something different to the same old vegetable sides. Even DH who despises veggies scarfed up this bok choy.

Great and easy. Served this with the new grilled shrimp recipe (lemon and oregano), rice pilaf - coffee granita after and scallop chowder to start. Great summer meal and easy.

Ok...this is a most excellent use of Bok Choy!! I changed the recipe a little! I used leeks instead of shallots and caramelized them, I also added curry and five spice and a little water to the Bok Choy...I steamed then sauted the Bok Choy and it was absolutely utopian!!;) I served it with tofu that I marinated and then baked! I will definitely make this again!!!
