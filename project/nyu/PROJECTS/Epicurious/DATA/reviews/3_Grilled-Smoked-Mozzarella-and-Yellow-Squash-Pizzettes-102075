As is, I think this recipe is bland. Garlic would be a nice addition.

This was phenomenal, though I did make a few changes. I added garlic to the vegetables and used goat cheese for the toppings. I cooked the crust on my George Foreman, which worked very well. Amazing.

Very quick and simple to make. I cooked them in my grill pan, and the dough came out very nicely. I doubled the tomatoes, and the ratio came out well. Might add some garlic to the topping next time for extra flavor.
