I made this for company and was very disappointed. Overall the vegetables tasted OK with the herb seasoning but the zucchini and squash were pretty mushy in the center. I ommitted the red pepper to avoid the extra step and I added the minced garlic to the vegetables along with the olive oil. LBasically it was just an okay recipe -- I expected WOW.

Try this recipe if you don't want just another boring vegetable dish. TOTAL roasting time should be about 15 minutes otherwise you get mushy veggies. I used cooking spray instead of oil which worked out great. I did not use the full amount of fresh herbs it was just too much.

I forgot to add salt at the end, but it's still okay as long as you eat something savory as well.

We found these vegetables to be very favorful. The herbs were a nice touch. I little bit of work but worth it.

This is my favorite company recipe for vegies. I group differnt vegies on a round platter so that they look beautiful. Taste great and are done long before company comes. Everyone loves them.

My first attempt at roasted vegetables and I'm hooked. It was too easy. I didn't think the small amount of oil would be enough, but it was, and the result was both deliciously sweet and attractive. I'll be trying a wide variety of different veggies with this one!

I was hoping for an easy vegetable side dish for Thanksgiving, but was disappointed. It was a hassle trying to turn the squash and zucchini, and separating the peppers from the rest was more trouble than it seemed worth (I didn't bother). The vegetables turned out too soft and mushy (I may have used too much olive oil).
