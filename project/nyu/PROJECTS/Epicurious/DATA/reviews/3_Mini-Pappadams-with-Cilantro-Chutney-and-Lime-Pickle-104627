This cilantro chutney is much tastier than any one I have found in Indian cookbooks! It's a keeper!

This dip was okay. Served it at a Indian themed dinner party with a few other dips. A few of my guests loved it, but overall it was not a huge hit. Luckily most everything else was.

Useful tip: You can toast pappadums on the BBQ, or toast them under a broiler instead of frying them. Tuen them over just as they start to bubble and keep an eye on them so they don't burn - works great!

I wasn't crazy about the chutney. I only used one jalapeno and it was REALLY hot and most of us really like spicy foods. The pappadams that I just microwaved crisp were better with the plain old peach chutney! I might try this again with some adjustments.

I didn't make the pappadams, but this chutney is fabulous! It's just as good as (if not better than) what is served as one of the trio of chutneys at my favorite Indian restaurants. I've already passed this recipe on to several friends, and plan to make this again and again.

Made a variation of this chutney, omitting the yogurt (because I was also serving a raita), and it was very fresh and tasty. The combination of cilantro and lime worked very well.
