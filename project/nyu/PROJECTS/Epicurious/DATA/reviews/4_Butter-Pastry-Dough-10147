I read a blog somewhere & a lady remarked she uses this crust only for all of her recipes for both sweet/savory pies. OMG!!!!! This is it! This has got to be the best, easiest to work with, most tender, most flaky, most D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S crust I have ever made!!!!! It was substantial, giving you an abundant dough to enable a nice edge to pinch. Plus, because of that abundance, I believe you could use this for either a deep dish or 10" pan as well if rolled slightly thinner. I too used the Cuisinart to combine then turned the loose mixture [did not pulse to a ball form] onto my floured board, & formed the disc there. I made a chicken/vegetable quiche from Whole Foods.com & could not believe how this crust turned out.........it was so crisp, buttery, almost layered like puff pastry. I wish I could go back & thank that lady......I love her for the tip! This is my ONLY crust! Can't wait to use it again! Thank-you!!!!

Very nice, simple recipe. I made it in the cuisinart, and turned it out into a bowl to squeeze the dough into a nice ball once the water had been added. It worked beautifully for a savory tart, though it might be a touch salty for a sweet filling.

This dough is very easy to work with and baked up very crisp (especially amazing considering it isn't prebaked). I cheated and mixed the dough in my food processor. I would put less salt in the crust - perhaps just a tsp. I used this crust with the Tomato Onion Tart and I had no problem with sogginess - in fact, the crust was still crisp when I warmed the leftovers in the oven the next day.

Great dough! Tender, flaky and easy to make. Very reliable for both savory and sweet applications.

Our wedding caterer made the Tomato Onion Tart for our reception five years ago and people STILL talk about it. I remember the crust -- flaky, rich perfection. I just used this crust for the "Spinach, Red Pepper, and Feta Quiche" and it was a hit. The dough is easy to work with and results in an absolutely beautiful and delicious crust.

perfect crust! proof that you don't need shortening to make a light and flaky crust.
