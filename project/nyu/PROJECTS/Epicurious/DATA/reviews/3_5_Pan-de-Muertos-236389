i also found it to be A LOT. It wasenough for 2 huge breads, half would have been enough. The taste is very similar to what you can find in bakeries in mexico, really good. Goes great with hot chocolate.

Make a half batch...seriously it's a lot of bread. At first I really didn't think this recipe was worth it. The dough is extremely sticky. The bones and skull at the end gets "melted" into the bread. After assuming this bread could be served with dinner. I discovered that toasted slices with butter and apricot jam were really good.
