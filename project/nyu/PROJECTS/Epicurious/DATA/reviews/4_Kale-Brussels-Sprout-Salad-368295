We loved, loved this recipe. I used curly kale and shredded both it and the brussels sprouts in the food processor so the pieces were very fine. I dressed the salad with the cheese several hours before serving which made all the difference. Extra salt and pepper helped too. My boyfriend raved. Next time I will add dried cranberries but I didn't have any on hand. For lunch today, I had leftovers with a hard boiled egg sliced on top. Marvelous!

This is a fabulous winter salad! It is a perfect side for holiday meals when you know you want something fresh on the side. Made it as written and it was perfect! Just finished 2 bowls for Friday night supper with a glass JP Chenet Reserve Merlot-Cabernet - delicious!

This is a fantastic recipe (but with a few modifications)! The first time i made it the dressing was a bit too tart, so the second time i sauteed about 2/3 cup chopped red apples with the almonds and added 1 tsp cumin to the dressing and it got rave reviews from my friends.

This is a very good and alternative salad. I prepared it 2 nights in a row. The second evening I made some changes on the dressing: 1 tsp of garlic powder 1/2 Tbl maio and 1/2 tsp of mustard powder and less lemon juce...it is amazing good!!!

This really does rock. I followed the recipe as written, I disagree that it needs more dressing. The only thing I did differently was to add some dried cranberries for color and sweetness. LOVE this salad, it's a perfect side to bring to a dinner party. I'll also bring it to holiday dinners.

This salad ROCKS! Warning: it makes a huge amount. I made it with only one bunch of kale and had plenty of leftovers. The dressing is fantastic but there isn't enough- and I'm not a dressing girl. I added extra lemon juice and evoo and used slat and vinegar almonds instead of roasting my own. I also followed the advice of other reviewers and added pomegranate seeds which provided a nice pop of color and brightness. Next time, I will omit them and substitute nectarine or orange slices. I served it with buttermilk brined pork chops, butternut squash risotto and a fruity Pinot noir. Great meal.

I hate Brussel Sprouts. Hate is a strong word, and yes I hate them. I have tried over the years many a recipe to entice my taste-buds to like them. Who doesn't like bacon? Well, for me, not even Bacon could entice my mouth to rejoyce! This recipe however is.... well... the bomb. I could eat this almost every day. Everything just works together, the tangy vinegar, salt dimension from the cheese, crunchy - nuttiness via the almonds. Mustard vinaigrette coating it all.... just works! Really awesome. Impress your friends and let them figure out they are eating those bitter little orbs called brussel sprouts and mouths will drop. Make this and smile.

love this recipe. Have made at three dinner parties and received rave reviews!

Rating: 3
Using only about 16 ounces of the kale and the full 12 ounces of sprouts, there wasn't enough dressing. I made a "dressing extender" with more olive oil, lemon juice, dijon, and 2 teaspoons of sugar; the sugar was needed, because even after sitting in the dressing for a few hours, the salad had an almost fishy taste. I also salted the salad as it sat in the dressing, to help it soften up a bit. Not a fan of nuts in salads, but other reviewers are right - the almonds here add texture and depth of flavor. Brought this to a potluck where it was a huge hit. Will make this again, but will double the dressing next time, add some sugar, and definitely give it many hours to sit, salted, in the dressing before serving.

As many other reviewers have said, this is an amazing salad! When I let my husband in on the ingredients (staunch kale and "little green ball" hater), I had to compel him to try it, which he did. Two helpings later, he's looking for 2nds tomorrow! The crispness of the kale and Brussels sprouts will keep this one fresh for days. Next time I make it, which will be soon, I'm going to add some sauteed prosciutto. Yum!

Wow! This is a delicious salad! My husband was a little skeptical with the raw Brussels and he's not really a fan of kale, but he loved this. I used Trader Joe's Tuscan kale and chopped it into smaller pieces. I threw in some pomegranate seeds just because I had some in the fridge. Will be making this again!

I made this for a potluck and everyone loved it, men and women alike. There were many requests for the recipe. One lady was shocked to find out that it has brussels sprouts, because she doesn't like brussels sprouts. I made the recipe exactly as written. I bought two bags of kale from Trader Joes and cut it into smaller pieces. Someone told me that Wegmans sells shredded brussel sprouts and I'll buy those the next time. I made double the dressing, but only used a little more than half to lightly coat the salad. I massaged the dressing into the salad about 4 hours before serving and added the cheese right before serving. The kale wasn't bitter at all. This is definitely one of my favorite salads of all time.

We have served this the past two Thanksgivings and it has been a hit! It's usually gone by dinner's end but this year we had a little left over. I found it in the fridge four days later and tried it. It was as delicious as the day it was made. I was amazed. It's nice to know you could make it a day ahead and it would last. We most recently made it with sunstem (sunflower stems) instead of brussels sprouts and parmesan instead of pecorino. Delicious!

Upon telling my dinner guests I was making this, their asking how it was made, and them realizing it was raw BS and kale, I got a "oh..." so we decided to pan sear the two. Was so amazing, and since Thanksgiving, we have yet to stop talking about it. Definitely worth trying.

I made the salad this year and last year for Thanksgiving to rave reviews. Everyone loved it. I used regular kale making sure that the pieces were small and followed the directions exactly.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving 2011...my family went crazy over it! My kids even loved it, and they would never eat kale or brussel sprouts. I have made it dozens of times since, and take it often for lunch to work. I keep the brussel sprouts and kale in a ziploc bag, and keep a double portion of the dressing in a container in the refrigerator. It stays fresh for a week that way, and I can grab what I need in a small container to take with me! PLEASE TRY THIS!

The only thing I dislike about this recipe is that I didn't find it until now. We have gotten so much kale from our CSA this summer and I have found few ways to make it edible. This was delicious the day I made it, and even more so the next day. I only used one bunch of kale (because that's all we had), and there was plenty of dressing. If I made the recipe with two bunches of kale, I'd probably make a bit more dressing and I will definitely cut the amount of olive oil when I make this in the future.

Rating: 4
Delicious and hearty salad. I used regular kale and massaged it after removing the fibrous central vein to break down the cellulose walls before I pulse processed it into a slaw consistency. I cored the Brussels sprouts and also pulse processed them to the same slaw consistency. I like a lot of onion and garlic so I tripled these and minced them in the processor too. The recipe benefits from a cup of craisins for a tangy, sweet-tart addition.

Rating: 3
This is a very good and healthy salad. It was a little too tart for me though. I had to add a bit of water and a bit more oil to the dressing. Make sure you buy fresh good quality Kale and sprouts; if they are really bitter it will ruin your salad. I will make this salad again but I an going to try adding some balsamic vinegar in place of some of the lemon juice.

This was actually very good! I only made it because I had nothing to eat in the fridge and had brussels sprouts, kale and grated parmesan to use up. Cut recipe in half but made the full amount of dressing and used about 3/4 of it. Used food processor for chopping. Turned out delicious!

Since discovering this recipe last year, I make it often. I take it to gatherings, and always get asked for the recipe. To anyone NOT into kale or brussel sprouts --TRY this recipe! It's hard NOT to like. I make it according to the recipe, and it's great! Since it lasts so long, I often add other ingredients over the week (tomatoes, quinoa, mushrooms, salmon/chicken, etc.). This is a staple in our home!

Like another cook, I can't believe I haven't sent in praise for this perfect salad, which I've made so many times in just a year. We stay true to the recipe -- sometimes adding a few more almonds, usually opting for a very good pecorino (it makes a difference) -- and serve it solo for lunch, or as an accompaniment, as tonight alongisde a butternut squash soup, roasted rosemary garlic potatoes and barbecued pork. You honestly can't go wrong -- and don't need to love kale to become a convert.

I love this salad - I have made it twice now. Very easy and simple, just a lot of chopping. I cut the recipe in half and it still makes about six servings. The nice thing about it is the shelf-life - this salad holds up for several days in the fridge without getting wilted or soggy. The only change I made was to use grated parmesan instead of Pecorino. It is a nice, refreshing, and healthy side dish.

I'm surprised to see that I've never rated this recipe.....I must have made this salad a hundred times and it has become one of our family staples. I follow the recipe pretty much as is though I typically halve it for our family of four and still have enough for lunch the next day. To all the naysayers, I'd suggest letting the dressing blend for a couple of hours; once tossed with the kale and shredded sprouts, let it sit for another hour or so BUT if you taste it at this point, it will taste too lemony.......wait to taste 'til you have added some pecorino as the saltiness balances the tart citrus. I no longer measure the pecorino; I just add until it tastes 'right'. I use the skin-on marcona almonds from Trader Joe's. And, btw, my family is not into kale or sprouts.......but this salad, they love.

I'm not sure how everyone else got it to be crunchy, mine was sort of... leathery?? So I took the advice of someone below and stir fried it for a few minutes. Much better. The cheese makes it.

This is wonderful! Good and crunchy - it reminds me of a extra crunchy, lemony caesar. The almonds are a great add. I didn't have a shallot, but it was great anyway! I'm going to try a vegan version next time. I think the raw brussels sprouts and kale could be a winning mix to any strong, tart dressing.

One of the greatest things about this salad is the way the kale and brussels stand up to the dressing. The leftovers do not wilt but get better with time. People who do not eat brussels or kale loved this dish.

This recipe is awesome! I wilt the kale and brussels sprouts ever so slightly in a sautee pan and that helps take any bitter edge off. Also, I've added pomegranate seeds - the color, sweetness, and texture really add a lot of interest. This is a perfect Thanksgiving side dish or potluck meal as it improves with a little time.

I've made this exactly as written and it was a hit. I have since made a couple of variations and the recipe was even better. Instead of lemon juice, I used balsamic vinegar - or 1/2 lemon 1/2 balsamic. It has the tartness, but adds a little sweetness. I've also added pomegranate seeds or dried currants. I love this salad.

Bright and acidic, but intensely flavored, really accents a good aged cheese. It cuts right through the fatty sides of Thanksgiving. The brussels sprouts should be new and sweet to be at their best. It was a big hit at my holiday table, but I used regular curly kale- I don't think anyone outside of Manhattan or Tuscany has ever heard of Tuscan Kale- I couldn't even find it this spring in my seed catalogs! I made the dressing the night before. I washed the kale the night before and soaked it in iced water overnight to keep it at it's crispest and sliced it up right before dinner after a spin in the salad spinner. I added the almonds before tossing and put the Pecorino shavings on top- it was beautiful.

I am so sorry to write a negative review of anything on this site, but I have to say that this salad was a crushing disappointment last weekend. I had to give it a fork rating in order to be allowed to write this review, but now that I am started, please know that I am taking back my fork! I prepared the salad exactly as written, which is how I always approach a new-to-me, highly-recommended recipe. Even with all the lovely other flavors that went into it, however, the unpleasantly dominant flavor in the finished salad was bitterness -- lemon and kale. All the other reviews prepared me for a thrilling experience, so I tackled all that chopping and mixing with joyful anticipation. I could not have been more shocked when I first tasted the combination. I went to look at the recipe again and wanted to weep with frustration, for I had done it all right. After I got over that, I put it in the fridge, positive that the flavors would blend overnight. That didn't happen either. Our family enjoys kale and brussels sprouts, so foolish me, I felt as if I were ahead of the game with this one. But I was the only one who could stand to eat it the next day, and I felt I had to! The day after that, I put fat-free ranch dressing on it to mild it down and give it some flavor. I had it for lunch three days in a row. Tonight I had to put it down the disposal. The recipe makes a TON, so you know how wasteful that felt. I would not recommend this to anyone for any menu, and I will never make it again.

I love this salad! I have made it half a dozen times and my guests love it, too (even my meat-and-potatoes-only brother loves it.) I actually prefer it when made a day ahead (pleasant surprise the 3rd time I made it when there actually WERE leftovers.) The kale and sprouts are very hearty and not only hold up to the dressing well, but the flavors combine much better if left in the fridge (dressed) overnight. I recommend holding the almonds until serving. I had to make it once with parmesan as I was out of pecorino and it was still good, but definitely much better with the pecorino. Also, stick to Tuscan (AKA: Lacinato, Dinosaur Kale, Palm Tree Kale.) I chop the kale by hand, but do the sprouts in the cuisinart....much faster.I also make double the dressing. I usually pick the kale from my own garden and it is just too hard to "guess" what two bunches is. Even when purchasing store bought kale, I've found a lot of variation in the amount in two bunches.

This is a very tasty salad.It's almost a meal itself. I have substituted toasted pine nuts if I did not have almonds.

This is a great recipe. I guess its so good because it's so different, I would have never thought to eat brussels sprouts raw. I am trying to watch calories/fat content, so I skipped the almonds, and went very light on the cheese and dressing. It was good the way it was, and I'm sure would be even better if it had the almonds and more cheese & dressing. ANyway, if you're bored with regular salads and looking for a hearty salad, this will not disappoint.

I so wanted to love this . . . but I didn't. It was good and I enjoyed it, but I expected to be blown away based on the reviews. Although I used slightly less cheese than the recipe called for (and did parmesan instead of pecorino) I felt that the cheese was still a little overwhelming and made the salad heavier than I expected. I adopted all the tips -squeezing the kale, chopping it very finely, using the food processor to do the brussels sprouts - that other reviewers suggested and aside from the cheese adjustment, followed the recipe exactly. Plus I love both kale and brussels sprouts. My two teens and husband also liked the salad, but nobody raved. I made kale chips the next day (usually only do those when the CSA delivers lots of kale) and those were loved and scarfed down very quickly. We do love our greens! Is there some secret that I missed here? I'll try again in a while, but definitely disappointed!

I didn't actually do this recipe, I didn't see it was for a salad, so instead I sauteed the kale, brussel sprouts, shallot, and garlic in a pan, then roasted it for about 5 minutes till tender and done, topped with roasted tomatoes and topped with a sprinkle of toasted almonds and pecorino cheese!

My husband was very skeptical when I told him I was making a raw kale and brussels sprout salad. Boy did he change his tune once he tasted it! This salad is so, so, so delicious! My husband actually proclaimed it was, "the best salad in the world!" and he isn't prone to mid-meal proclamations. I made the dressing about an hour ahead of time and let it sit on the counter and let the flavors 'meld' that way instead of holding back on the oil until the end. It tasted wonderful so I'm not sure that waiting to fully make the dressing is necessary.

I made this for a change of pace mid-winter vegetable. The whole family loved it. It is so simple and yet very elegant and a great alternative in winter vegetables. I could eat it alone as a meal!

Tasted great! The pecorino made it pungent. I used sliced almonds instead of whole because I thought the shape would go better with the grated kale and brussel sprouts. I didn't use as much kale as they said (more like 3/4 to 1 pound of kale) becuase my bowl wasn't big enough.

Oh my - it's hard to imagine giving a salad four stars but my husband and I have been eating this by the bowl. I made it first for a holiday party. Sliced the kale with a knife and grated the brussels in the Cuisinart. I added a handful of pomegranate seeds as another reviewer suggested and they looked so sparkly and beautiful nestled in the greenery. Note: I find it difficult to chop nuts coarsely for toasting because the smaller pieces tend to burn. So of course I burnt the first batch of almonds. Next I tried toasting sliced raw almonds and they stuck together. I think almond slivers are probably the easiest to manage in this case. This is sure to become a winter staple.

Absolutely delicious salad. We think the proportions are perfect and should be scrupulously respected. It was so good the first time we tried to up the amount of almonds and cheese, but found that it threw the balance off.

Wow. I must say, I was not at all convinced this would be good (after all, I like my kale cooked with lots of spice and I haven't had a ton of brussels sprouts that I've loved), but my sister said it was dynamite (she made it for thanksgiving). So now I'm in love. Will I ever make another salad?? We'll see.

I made this at Thanksgiving this year, and to my amazement, even the little kids who don't like anything, LOVED it. Naturally i did NOT tell them this was a kale and brussels sprouts salad. One note: with the lemon and the Pecorino, it get's salty in a hurry, so go easy on the actual salt, and taste as you go. Also, it's even better the next day!

Sadly I spent much of my formative years thinking I hated kale and Brussel sprouts. Now, I can't get enough of either and this is a perfect storm of both. Even so, we were surprised to like it so much. I chopped dried, tart cherries and that took it to a whole nother level. Can't wait to make it again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone, even those who claimed not to like brussels sprouts, loved this. DELISH! I used parm cheese instead of pecorino and it was wonderful.

It's incredible. I found the vinaigrette a little too mustardy for my taste, may experiment with adding a little honey or agave nectar to it next time (tonight!). Overall, though, this salad is such a winner, we were really blown away!

Have made this salad twice now, for dinner parties, and both times people who said they didn't like Brussels sprouts or kale loved it. It makes a ton of salad, so there are yummy leftovers. I used Parmesan once and pecorino once; both are great. Also have used the skin-on almonds as called for and regular sliced almonds -- also both good. I would recommend making extra dressing and having it for leftovers, and also caramelizing the shallots as others have suggested. Also, the Brussels sprouts are really easy to do in the food processor. Would recommend getting whole kale and not the bagged kind, as it is easier to slice. Used regular kale, not Tuscan, both times -- and still great.

Oh, my goodness -- best salad I ever ate in my life. Seriously. My husband wasn't as intrigued (he's an arugula and heirloom tomato man), but for me the fresh greenness of the kale & brussels sprouts with their almonds and sparkly seasonings made this a crunchy taste explosion. Really worth it -- try it for yourself and see. We're now going to bring this to an elegant potluck dinner instead of shrimp, and the foodies there who tend to care about eating locally (yes, both the sprouts and the kale we used were harvested from our CSA just last week) are likely to be thrilled. P.S. had to use sweet onions instead of shallots, and had to replace the Pecorino with fresh Parmesan -- so it would probably have been even better with the original ingredients. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Wow, wow, wow... :)

this was exceptional! it's relatively easy to make which is an added benefit. I'm surprised how well the dressing went with the raw kale and brussels sprouts. a must try.

Loved it. I was wondering why everyone was so excited about this salad based on the ingredients. I thought that it was fantastic. Will definitely make it again and am recommending it to others. Never prepared kale or brussel sprouts raw and love that I can now! I didn't fry up the almonds. Instead, I just toasted almond slivers and added them. I also didn't have pecorino on hand, so I used grana padano. Delicious.

My sister and I decided to mix things up a bit this Thanksgiving when we came across this recipe. This salad was a HUGE hit and enjoyed by all ages. It was a great light compliment to the more traditional sides, and we will definitely add this to our menus moving forward

I was skeptical about a raw kale & brussels sprouts salad, but it was perfect! Agree w/another reviewer that it is like the healthy version of a Caesar salad. I forgot to grab almonds, so I toasted sunflower seeds instead and it worked out just fine.

I took a chance making this salad because I'm not a fan of brussels sprouts and I sure am glad I took that chance! I decided to include it in my Thanksgiving menu - and it was the hit of the party. We're not yet three weeks past Thanksgiving and I've made this salad three more times. I followed the instructions to the tee, but made two batches of dressing worried the recipe might not provide enough. However it turns out that the proportions are just perfect and I didn't use the 2nd batch of dressing. I was thrilled to learn that the leftovers are as good a day or two later since the kale and sprouts retain their crunchiness. This is a keeper that I will make time and time again

I made this today because of the reviews on it. I wanted to try out a salad that I could make for Christmas. I cannot give it even 1 fork. It was that bad. I cannot believe all the great reviews on it and I followed the recipe exactly. I cook 95% of the time and I consider myself a very good cook. This recipe had way too much lemon in it and that is about all that you taste in this recipe. I wasted a lot of time and money. I still cannot believe all the great reviews on this. And that everyone says how beautiful it looks. It was just a bowl of dark and light green in it. Pretty Bland. People save the great reviews for the really good recipes. And comparing it to a Caesar salad...how did they come up with that? Don't waste your time on this one. I know good food and this is not good. Yuck!!!!!

This is unreal. I was curious after reading all of the good reviews and wasn't disappointed. The only change I made was to add some pomegranate seeds, as some reviewers had suggested. It is robust, yet healthy tasting. We ate it tonight with a tenderloin steak and some roasted fingerling potatoes, but this would be right at home on a holiday table. It also keeps people guessing - not easy to guess that you are eating raw Brussels sprouts. Outstanding.

I was skeptical of raw kale, but I am always looking for new ways to get green leafy anything into our diet. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. I have to admit I tried to make it a second time with some not-as-fresh kale and it was too tough. But not all was lost, I kept it and threw it into vegetable soup the next night.

Excellent healthy recipe. Made exactly per directions. Agree with other reviewers that this really doesn't lose any color and doesn't wilt after a few days.

Pecorino was too SALTY! I used parm and lost a little of that sheepy-barnyard flavor, but was much better in terms of salt! Love it.

Okay, this salad is clearly the rave right now. It came out in the November issue of Bon Appetit and we're going crazy for it, folks. It's good and good for you. I love it, and featured it on my blog: http://bruleed.com/

Judging from all the other reviews my family were not the only ones who loved this. Even picky eater grandkids thought it was great. I substituted pomegranate seeds for the nuts and it was so festive looking and delicious. It also holds up well as a left-over.

Made this at Thanksgiving and it was a hit! My kids like kale, but have never been fans of brussels sprouts. They loved it! Next time I might add a bit more almonds.

As soon as I read the recipe when I received the magazine, I knew it would be on our Thanksgiving table and I didn't make any changes to the recipe. The grandkids don't care for Brussels sprouts and had never had kale, they all loved it! My 14 year old granddaughter asked for the recipe, much to everyone's surprise. Will definitely be making this again and again.

This was a light and good tasting salad. Will definitely make again.

Add me to the hordes who cooked this for Thanksgiving this year. It got rave reviews. It took me a while to figure out that Tuscan Kale is called Dinosaur Kale in the West. As others have said, its very caesar-y.

We were guests at a Thanksgiving dinner where another guest brought this salad. Fabulous!

Wouldn't tell my family in advance that the salad was going to be kale and brussels sprouts, and not having tried it myself first I was a little worried about making it for Thanksgiving dinner. But it was the hit of the evening! One guest wanted the recipe to send to her sister, another wanted the recipe to make the salad for a light dinner the night following Tday. I just used store-bought candied almonds instead of frying almonds, made it a really simple dish. Used curly kale instead of Tuscan, worked just fine without being bitter.

Used less kale - perfect. Rave reviews! Will make again and again and not just for holidays. In fact making it again topped with leftover turkey for dinner.

a huge hit for our thanksgiving feast of 10 people. everyone loved it! can't wait to make again. i used packaged kale from trader joe's and cooked the kale in water and some oil for a few minutes first before tossing in with the brussels sprouts.

Added fresh tarragon to the dressing. Took it over the top. Used one pound of kale, which was plenty. It was as good or better the next day. This will appear on the table every month, not just for Thanksgiving!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving with one small twist: I used Tamari Almonds instead of regular ones. It took the flavor to the next level. Also, be sure to massage the kale after you've shredded it (before you add anything else). Just get your clean hands in the bowl and squeeze the kale for a minute or two. This breaks it down a little without heating it so the nutrients all remain, but it won't be as bitter. When the kale turns from a muted to a more pronounced green, you know it's ready, and you can add the other ingredients.

Such a surprisingly tasty and healthy recipe. I was amazed that everyone loved it so much at Thanksgiving. I left off the cheese and sauteed the shallots.

This was really good, although the 1.5 lbs of kale seemed way too much for the amount of dressing I ended up with. The dressing is amazing and works very well with the raw kale and brussel sprouts. The dressing really tastes like a caesar!

This was a HUGE hit at the Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I too subbed broccoli slaw for brussel sprouts and it was very easy and delicious. This goes on my permanent rotation.

This is wonderful! We enjoyed it as a side the first night. It keeps so well--even dressed--that on night two I made it our main dish by topping it with sliced chicken cutlets sauteed in olive oil, garlic, and a squeeze of lemon; sort of a chicken caesar salad. Delicious!

As with other reviewers, I was skeptical of this salad - RAW kale and RAW Brussels sprouts? I served this at Thanksgiving and it was DELICIOUS! It's a 4 fork recipe and a perfect crunchy addition to the mushy dishes (sweet potatoes, green bean casserole, etc). Everyone loved this salad - I can't wait to make it again. I can imagine making a heaping of the greens at the beginning of the week, and dressing portions as you serve it. A key to this dish is to chop as finely as possible. A food processor would make this work v easy.

This was great... a nice bright palate cleanser at Thanksgiving. Converted a lot of skeptics. I did dress the salad a couple of hours before the meal, which I think helped. Normally I would not do that, but it helped the flavors blend and the uncooked veggies can stand up to it.

Rating: 4
This was surprisingly good! Very Pretty presentation! Perfect for a Thanksgiving salad! I used 1/2 tsp salt (instead of just 1/4 tsp) in the dressing and sprinkled the greens with some more salt as I tossed it because it seemed to need it. I used parmigiano reggiano cheese - ground some fine and left some in shreds and that seemed to be just right! They went back for seconds!

RUN HOME AND MAKE THIS SALAD NOW!!! I found this recipe while searching for the perfect vegetable Thanksgiving side dish as an alternative to a green-bean casserole or creamed spinach. I was very apprehensive given that kale and brussel sprouts aren't always well received from party guests. However, this salad was a HUGE success. There wasn't a person who didn't love this salad. The blend of flavors were absolutely balanced and perfect. I did substitute almonds for pine nuts given someone's suggestion and primarily because the almonds tend to be rather large. This salad will become a staple in my every day cooking and I cannot wait to eat this as left-overs!

A *highly* successful Thanksgiving experiment! Omitted the garlic and used Asiago but otherwise followed the recipe. The color is fabulous and the raw, crunchy, fiber was a nice addition to the meal! Great recipe for food sensitivities - kept the nuts on the side. I'll make this again at Christmas - thanks for the recipe!!!

I was very nervous with this recipe since I did not have time to try it before taking it for thanksgiving. No nerves needed! It was delicious and not at all bitter as I thought it would be. I didn't have almonds so used pecans and it was an easy switch. I also added some cranberries for a little sweetness. The salad had a nice crunchiness and was enjoyed by everyone.

This was a great addition to the Thanksgiving Day dinner spread! I was a little nervous b/c I've never had kale in a salad...only as a garnish! I couldn't find Pecorino cheese, so I used Romano and it was fabulous!

Just made this salad for Thanksgiving and WOW did it look beautiful next to turkey, turnips, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and stuffing. This salad is very vibrant, flavorful and satisfyingly crunchy. Of all the delicious foods at our dinner, I only wanted a second helping of this dish. I will definitely make this again...probably tomorrow.

This is my new favorite dish! I've made it twice this past week and we're having it again on Thanksgiving day. The flavors were delicious and I wouldn't change a thing except maybe double the amount of almonds.

This salad is fantastic and it's a great way to get anyone, even those who aren't big fans of kale, to enjoy fall and winter greens. I agree with another reviewer who said this is like a lighter version of a caesar salad. The dressing is flavorful and the crunchiness of both the almonds and kale are great. My mom is still talking about it today after I made it last night!

I thought the salad was just ok. It was dry though admittedly, I did half the amount of oil. I felt it needed some sweetness so I added some dried cranberries, which also provided some nice colour. I ended up using the leftovers in a frittata (along with caramelized shallots).

Love it! I originally made it salt- free for a friend, hence no mustard or parmesan, and even then it was fabulous. Of course, the rest of us added salt and the rest and it was even better. A fabuous winter salad that I will make again and again.

Made this salad tonight (to go with the roasted butternut squash lasagna on this webiste) and it was amazing. . . crispy, lemony, subtle blending of flavors. Don't skip the toasted almonds. I used parmigan regiano grated cheese b/c I didn't have pecorino. .. . ahhh, Life is good (and healthy).

This is my new favorite salad - and I can't believe I like brussel sprouts! Tastes like an extra crunchy Ceasar - its awesome! Used pine nuts instead of almonds and it still tasted great! Kept the cheese off of it for my vegan husband and he still licked the plate!

Delish. My young kids, not normally green veg lovers, have been hoovering it up (with the addition of croutons!). We can't get enough of it either- so healthy yet so satifying. Would be a great lunch/easy dinner with addition of grilled chicken.

if you can't have cheese in this case, I would caramelize a bunch of thinly sliced shallots (make sure to salt them while cooking so that the salt sticks). Really caramelize them. It takes a little bit of time but you can make extra to set aside for another dish later in the week. They are addictive!

This salad is delicious! I used regular curly kale and it worked just fine. Normally, dressed salads get all wilted if the leftovers are stored overnight. Not with this salad - it stays crunchy even the next day. Oh, and make extra almonds - my teenage sons were eating them like candy!

Made this last and we all loved it. Very lemony, which I like. Only had parmesan, but guess the pecorino would have been either better. Also, used hazelnuts because I was out of almonds. But those are minor changes. The basic salad is terrific; definitely becoming a staple.

This salad was fantastic. It was fresh and easy and the almonds really add a nice flavor. My guests couldn't get over how delicious it was - and there were even some kale-rejectors in the crowd. I halved the recipe and it made 4 generous side servings.

Really excellent. It is quite lemony-tasting, which is fine, but is also nicely contrasted by the cheese and toasted almonds. Don't skimp on the shallots in the dressing; they really help make the dish. Can also be made with shaved broccoli instead of the brussels sprouts (no one will know), and as Tuscan kale can be hard to find, regular curly kale works just fine.
