Wonderful cake! Substitute buttermilk for sour cream for a moister cake. I used about half of the recommended powdered sugar. Use dark brown sugar for a more developed, complex flavor. The blackberries tend to be kind of soupy and seep too much into the cake. In case of this phenomenon, use a cheese cloth to strain most of the excess liquid. Add another egg to the cake. I decorated this cake with extensive vine piping details and blackberries on top! It was a HUGE success. It was gone almost immediately!

Thanks to the confusion of amount of blackberries, I have twice as many. We got 10 pints and only needed 4{1/2} pints. Rather upset with this, but hope the cake turns out okay...

I made this cake for Mother's Day, and everyone loved it. I changed the eggs in the cake to 4 and only used about a third of the powdered sugar called for in the icing, and the it was fantastic. Delicious and beautiful!

I used buttermilk in lieu of the sour cream and increased the eggs to 4 as others suggested. While it maybe wasn't dry & crumbly, I do understand what people meant when they said the texture was a little dry. That's inevitable when egg whites are whipped, which is why I usually avoid recipes that call for them or I just don't whip them. The spice flavor, redolent of cinnamon & nutmeg, is rather predictable and overwhelming with cinnamon, I thought. I may try this again but with different spices and without whipping the whites.

I made this cake for the first time for a baby shower, it was simply the most gorgeous and tasty cake I'd ever made. Its beauty (inside & out) matches its flavor. I, too, followed the suggestion of using a total of (4) eggs and baking in (2) 9" cake pans. I will be making it again for a bridal shower next week.

Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum. This is the spice cake I have been looking for; it reminded me of the spice cake my great grandma used to make, but better. This is an incredibly light, tender and deliciously spiced cake. I took another readers suggestions and substituted buttermilk for the sour cream and added an extra egg. If this cake turns out dry, it is simply overcooked and if it is dense, it is the bakers error, because this recipe is incredibly light and fine crumbed. So good. I am going to make this over and over and over again. I didn't make the cream cheese frosting, it seems a little heavy for this cake. I made an old fashion brown sugar butter cream that was perfect. Make this cake, it is divine!

Very good combination with the richness of the frosting, the tartness of the blackberries, and the fragrance of the spice cake. I've made this twice over the past few weeks with the following modifications: * substituted buttermilk for sour cream (out of necessity) with dramatic improvement in moistness of the cake * added a rum simple syrup drizzle to the cake layers (2 8" cake layers split in half, 1/2 c water, 1/2 c sugar, 1/3 c rum) * used the blackberry filling from the brown sugar blackberry cake recipe, with the addition of 2 tsp of gelatin to thicken the jam * thinned the left over jam with a little of the rum syrup to serve on the side with the cake. Very tasty, impressive, and easy to pull off, even with my obsessive modifications!

This cake is so fabulous. I've made it countless times and was skeptical at first, but it's wonderful. I always up the spices a little bit, add cardamom and cloves, and use 4 eggs. I bake in two 9 inch cake pans and slice each layer in half, but otherwise I follow the recipe exactly. Such a great cake. One of my favorites, to be sure.

I made this cake blind (having never tasted it before) for a rehearsal dinner. It was a HUGE success. People had second helpings and my grandmother had to ask three times where we had bought it before she finally accepted that it was homemade. Absolutely delicious. A note about making the cake: I read the other reviews and went ahead and used four eggs instead of three. It made all the difference. Our cake was beautifully moist and melt-in-your-mouth.

For those who are reporting that the cake is somewhat dry, here is a possible solution. The eggs today that they classify as large are not as large as they used to be. I have started using extra large or jumbo sized eggs and my old recipes now come out how they used to. Try that with this recipe, it will make a huge difference.

I wasn't thrilled with this recipe. I made if for a friend's birthday and I should never have made a recipe I had not tried out before hand. The cake was dense, which I could accept, but it did seem a little dry, as other reviews mentioned, and the taste of the cake left much to be desired. Even though I drained the mashed blackberries, I still had a problem with the juice running down the sides of the cake.

What a beautiful cake! Easy to make and tasted so delicious, rose beautifully and was lovely and moist. Blackberries are quite expensive at the moment so I used blackberry conserve. Everyone loved this cake :)

I made cupcakes from the recipe, with a few changes. I did a double recipe of the cake and single of the frosting. They were out of blackberries, so I used raspberries instead. The medium container of sour cream is shy of the 2 cups, so I used 4 tbsp of unsweetened applesauce, and saved what was needed for the frosting on the side. I used about half the powder sugar in the frosting, and added a touch of orange extract. Cooking time for a dozen cupcakes was about 30-35 mins. I frosted the cupcakes and put the filling in a dimple in the frosting to try to keep it on top. If I make these again I think I'm going to substitute some of the sugar for honey in the fruit mixture to make it sturdier.

This cake was remarkable. I was disappointed when my local grocery was out of blackberries the day I made the cake, so I substituted blueberries and it turned out wonderful. I love making layer cakes, but I have a small family, and almost always end up throwing out the last third of the cake - not so with this one! Everyone loved it and the whole cake was gone in a couple of days!

mmm, just wonderful! I didn't have problems with a dry cake, but figured the filling would add moisture if needed. One thing I did was add unflavored gelatin to the blackberries to help gel the filling. I had to refrigerate the frosting longer than expected, but it was fine come assembly time.

I made this cake for mother's day and it was a HUGE hit. The only modification I made to the batter was substituting cloves for the nutmeg, as that was all I had in the house, and adding a little bit of vanilla extract. I only used 2 cups of powdered sugar in the frosting, and I thought that was perfect. I also didn't add any sugar to the blackberry filling, I just mashed it up. I didn't strain the filling and thought that leaving it chunky added a good texture. i chilled the frosting at least an hour before using it, and I think that helped a lot. To keep everything together, I iced the first layer, chilled it, added the filling, chilled it, and then added the second layer and iced and chilled it overnight. I decorated it with blackberries and raspberries all over the top. I had no trouble with the cake, and the most nerve-wracking part was transporting it in my unairconditioned car! It was wonderfully flavorful and the berries go together beatifully with the cake and the frosting. Besides being expensive, I think this is a great cake to make for any occasion - it is sure to impress!

I couldn't disagree more with those who said the cake turned out heavy or dry. I used cake flour and sifted the flour before measuring (old-fashioned, I know) and it turned out remarkably delicate and moist. Delicious. I did add 1/2 tsp. cardamom and 1 tsp. vanilla and baked the layers in 3 9" pans for about 20 minutes. As for the frosting, I made 2/3 of the recipe as directed as another reviewer suggested. It made just the right amount. As for consistency, it wasn't spreadable right out of the fridge, and once spreadable was slippery and difficult to work with (even in Chicago in October!), but I managed and the cake looked so impressive with the berries and mint leaves for garnish! I did cheat and ust Trader Joe's blackberry sauce for the filling as the berries were very expensive. My best suggestions to others wishing to put this together for presentation is to keep the filling about an inch from the edge and to secure the layers with long toothpicks once stacked because they really do slide around!

Rating: 3
I'm in the middle of making this cake still, and I have no doubt it will taste fabulous. But it's been a nightmare w/ the prep/assembly. The frosting is like yogurt consistency, runny, which could be my adding blackberry juice to color it and I did cut down the powdered sugar by 2 cups. I pushed the berries through a sieve and apparently did not use enough cornstarch in the juice. My recommendation would be if the filling or frosting looks runny and not thick enough while preparing, then add more cornstarch or more of something to get it right, bc. it will not set up in the fridge or become thicker w/ refrigeration. Also, I used baking powder instead of soda, by accident! This may be why the cake does not stand very tall, even w/ the filling/frosting in between. I'm hoping the berry garnish and some gerber daisies on the plate will give this a major facelift!!

Rating: 4
An amazing combination of flavors...this is SO worth making! I skipped the "filling" step and simply layered sliced blackberries and frosting between the layers. The remaining berries went on top and really dressed up the cake. The blackberries are a wonderful complement to the spice cake, and the frosting marries everything together. This is a simple cake with luscious results...enjoy!

Delicious cake and it makes a beautiful presentation. I used seedless blackberry jam for the fruit filling and it didn't leak out the sides. I did refrigerate the frosting and cake before I assembled it. The unique combination of blackberries and spice cake is what I think puts this recipe over the top.

Rating: 3
I'm giving this cake 3 forks for flavor. The filling didn't work out like it was supposed to so my cake looked like a Blackberry Disaster when assembled. The blackberry filling squished out the sides when I put the top layer on and tried to frost it. Fortunately, it was just for family so I got a good laugh out of how bad it looked (although I bake frequently, it totally looked like my toddler made it). My filling didn't set up enough so I had to cook it with cornstarch and let it cool. I even put the cake in the freezer for 10-15 minutes after frosting each layer to help firm things up. In the end, I swirled the filling all over the frosting so it looked like I did it on purpose. The flavor components ARE really delicious (spice cake, cream cheese frosting, blackberry filling). NEXT TIME I WOULD JUST MAKE THE SPICE CAKE AND FROST IT WITH THE CREAM CHEESE FROSTING, AND SERVE IT WITH THE BLACKBERRY FILLING ON THE SIDE OR GARNISH THE PLATE WITH IT IN A PRETTY DESIGN.

This was most awesome. The flavor combination is great, and with cake flour the consistency is perfect. It smelled so good baking I couldn't focus on anything else. And it looks so impressive.

I have made this cake following the recipe and varried different fillings. Strawberry/Rhhubarb works great with this recipe! I have made this cake a few different times for friends, and they still ask when I'm making the next one. LOVE IT! If you make sure to use cake flour, it'll come out nice and fluffy and moist. Regular flour will make it very dry if overcooked.

The cake was very tasty...great spice flavors. I did not make it with the blackberry filling, but simply made the cake and frosted the layers and the outside with cream cheese frosting. My only criticism of the cake was that it was a little dry. This may be because I used one standard container of Sour Cream and was a hair shy of the full 2 cups. I took the cake into the office for a colleague's birthday and it got rave reviews.

Wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of having to use frozen blackberries for the filling, and fresh raspberries for the garnish (couldn't get fresh blackberries). The icing was sweet, but I felt it was a perfect foil to the mildy spicy and not overly sweet cake and tart blackberries. Everyone, including the kids, loved it, and it was devoured very quickly. It was all I could do to save the last piece for my daughter!

Very good cake, but quite sweet. Couldn't get blackberries, so I used raspberries. I, too, crushed the berries, strained out the seeds, and cooked the juice w/a little corn starch for the filling - seemed to work fine. My cake ended up a little flat -- perhaps I over-mixed when folding in the egg whites. The frosting was a little inclined to melt (doesn't everything in South FL?) -- fridge did the trick.

Others' suggestions taken to heart, plain yogurt as sub, no need to cut the cake in half - could just use two cake pans, and overall more berries. We made the frosting purple with berry juice - oh, so festive, but the recipe calls for a bit too much frosting. This was quite possible the best tasting cake we have ever made!

I made this in an effort to use an overabundance of my blackberries and all of us thought it was fabulous. My husband has already asked for it to be his birthday cake for the next 25 years. I substituted 2T of cornstarch for 2T of the flour and used AP flour. In the cake, I substituted yogurt for the sour cream and omitted the sour cream in the icing. I also seriously reduced the confectioners' sugar, using only 3C to let the taste of the cream cheese (Neufchatel, actually) come through; and, as usual with sweets, added a pinch of salt to the icing. Even with the reduced amount of sugar, I had icing left over (and this Icing Fanatic didn't skimp.) I'm making it again this weekend, have given out the recipe, and will keep makning it as long as I'm harvesting blackberries. (Then I'll move on to using the frozen ones in it.)

This is a fantastic recipe - I used canned blackberries (it was winter) and only made one layer, and it was one of the most delicious cakes I've ever tasted. I'll definitely be making this again. One note though, as a previous reviewer suggested you'll want to add at least half again the amount of spice in the recipe.

This was good, but in need of just a few refinements to perfect. The cake (which smelled delectable while baking!) was overly downy and tender for my liking. I'd try it again with at least partial all-purpose flour vs. cake flour and *not* separating the eggs and beating the whites. The cake's flavor was good, but the spice flavor was on the mild side. I think a smidge more spicing - perhaps including a touch of fresh ginger and pinch of cloves - may ramp it up further. As for the filling, I had doubts that mere crushed berries and sugar would produce a texturally suitable filling, plus I appreciated a reviewer's advice about straining out the seeds. So, I crushed the berries with sugar, pushed the mixture through a sieve, and cooked it with a bit of cornstarch, making a loose jam-like filling. This worked fine - no filling leakage. I omitted sour cream from the frosting because I didn't want to loosen its texture. Followed the frosting and garnish displayed in the photo and it was a very attractive cake. : )

OK, I totally changed this to make a totally different cake, but I needed to copy a cake from a restuarant for my DH's birthday...that said...it is delicious. I added chopped white chocolate to the cake, then drizzled with amaretto while cooling, then replaced the vanilla in the frosting with amaretto also. Topped with white chocolate curls to rave reviews. I now want to try with the berries.

The cake recipe is excellent--not too dry, tender crumb, mild spice flavor that could go well with many berries. I baked in 3 pans for 15 mins. I drained the filling in a colander and am very glad I did, but I would use slightly less sugar in the filling next time. I used about 4 cups sugar in the frosting instead of 5, and it was the right amount of sweetness. Warning: During transport, the frosting melted really badly, with hideous gaping holes in the sides, etc. I put it back in the fridge for awhile, and was then able to repair it completely by smoothing the frosting back upwards. Another 20 minutes, however, and it would have been unsalvageable. The extra cup of sugar in the recipe would probably make it a bit sturdier, but then it would have been way too sweet. So I would recommend not transporting this for more than about 45 minutes.

Delicious and it's presentation is great! The spice cake is mild (not overpowering) and the cream cheese frosting topped with blackberries is beautiful.

I did make this cake during the summer, when berries were in season, but I'm going to try and make it this weekend with frozen berries and see how that turns out and maybe top it with shaved white chocolate instead of fresh berries (since they're $6.99 a pint or something ridiculous like that during the winter).

I am not going to rate this recipe as I only used the cake recipe for the pear spice cake recipe also on this site. But it did make a lovely cake.

This was realy delicious and looked very beautiful. I made it for a small gathering and got compliments from practically everyone! Lots of people went for seconds; it it disappeared in no time! The only thing was that when I layered the cake the center didn't seem quite done and the frosting seemed a bit runny (maybe I left it out for too long before spreading it or I didn't chill it for 1 hour because I ran out of time?) Although expensive and a bit time-consuming, it looked like an fancy bakery dessert and everyone said it was really good.

An offbeat, beautiful cake. I made this for a pokluck, and it was the first dessert that vanished. The use of a spice cake, instead of the usual white or chocolate cake, for a layered 'tort' is inspired. My only (slight) complaint was that it seemed almost overly sweet. I did substitue defrosted, drained frozen blackberries for the filling, and then used fresh on top. It worked perfectly well, and was a bit less expensive this way.

Once you have made this cake once, you will want to make it again and again. My friends talk about it constantly. It's really not hard to make either and is quite a showpiece, especially atop a cakestand. If you follow the recipe exactly, it will look just like the photo. I am not exaggerating when I say that this and the Raspberry and Marsala Trifle (on this site) are nothing short of utterly divine.

Yum. I made this for my husband's birthday and it was great. The blackberries and spice cake are definitely a great combo.

I just made this for a Mother's Day dinner and it was fantastic! My family aren't big dessert eaters and are very picky, but everyone couldn't get enough of this cake (there were many second helpings). It easily made 14 servings. As per other suggestions, I strained the blackberries after they macerated, but I couldn't throw out all the wonderful juice, so I boiled it down to a thick syrupy consistency (about 3 tablespoons), cooled it completely and folded it into the blackberries before frosting the cake. I made the frosting exactly as directed and used all of it on the cake. I absolutely love cream cheese frosting, so there can't ever be too much. Everyone else loved it, too, because their plates were practically licked clean. Soooo good!!!! It was so pretty (looked just like the picture) and this will definately be a keeper!
