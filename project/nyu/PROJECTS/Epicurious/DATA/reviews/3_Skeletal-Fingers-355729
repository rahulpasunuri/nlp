I actually really loved these. The white asparagus is a pain because you have to peel it, but once you do, it's super tasty. And definitely add the thyme, it's absolutely necessary. The only reason I would hesitate to make it again is the peeling, but since I now know what I'm getting into, it probably won't be so annoying.

PEEL the asparagus first or it will be too woody to eat. Also, mine was bitter, not at all sweet like green asparagus.
