I used 2 TBS of salt for 6 legs and thighs. 3 days marrinating. Used fresh thyme and skipped the pepper. Cooked for 4 hours in rendered duck fat. Check Amazon for less expensive duck fat than recommended in the recipe. It came out very good but I prefer the other recipe better.

This recipe is so great! I made it for Christmas dinner and everybody loved it. Definitely not too salty. Did the other reviewers forget to thoroughly rinse the salt mixture from the duck legs before cooking them in the duck fat? That would make a huge difference.

Holy Saltfest! The first time I made this I marinated it for 3 days so I blamed the incredible saltiness on the length of marinating. I tried it again and marinated it for just under 24 hours - still way too salty. The texture is perfect so I will hunt down another recipe or omit the salt altogether. The Asian Noodle dish in the same issue is THE way to use this. My butcher said scrambled eggs are great fried in duck fat, btw.

The duck was tender and moist, but I thought it was way too salty. My dinner guest loved it.
