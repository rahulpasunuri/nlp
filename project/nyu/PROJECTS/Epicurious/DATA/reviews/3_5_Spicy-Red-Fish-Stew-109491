I couldn't believe how much flavor it had---reminds me of courtbouillon but so easy. I was making this just for the 2 of us and used one pepper, 4 shallots, and a single can of "fire-roasted" diced tomatoes, along with most of Cook from NY's doctoring advice. Tilapia cause that was what was at the store, and it was delicious. Served with French bread to mop up the juice and a salad. I would make this for company any time.

Thank you, cook from NYC a few entries down...I took every one of your suggestions (clam broth, wine, cumin, paprika, chili pepper sauce, etc.) and it's probably the best fish soup I have ever made. I used my own home roasted tomatoes and also added some celery, carrots and white beans for nutrition/fiber. The fish remains the star of the dish, though. The cod is delicious and I'm eager to experiment with other kinds of fish and seafood.

A Cook from New Orleans, thanks for sharing your use of the catfish recipe spice. I tried it, and it was awesome - even better than the original recipe, which I also really love.

I did add the white wine too - forgot to mention that.

This was a huge hit at my dinner party! I had 10 very sophisticated palates at that dinner and everyone raved about the stew. I served it with TJ's Asiago Garlic bread and a salad of greens with a Dijon vinaigrette made with Champagne vinegar.

This was fabulous. I should give 4 forks, but am reserving that for something truly insane. I added cinnamon, allspice, and some of the spices mentioned in the recipe for catfish with spicy tomato sauce (search for it). I also just added some regular italian spice mix. It really was great.

This was a fast and easy & healthy soup. I read the reviews and it seems no one actually made this soup as written. I did and as I was eating it though I found myself longing for saffron. This soup on its own is pretty bland.

As others have noted, key is to use more tomatoes (I used 3 cans of roasted tomatoes for a bit under 2 lbs of cod), cup of wine, cumin, juice of a half lemon. But the secret ingredient is Trader Joe's Chile Pepper Sauce instead of the hot pepper flakes.

Insanely delicious. I incorporated a lot of suggestions from readers' comments: used 2 T EVOO, 6 shallots and a small red onion, 6 cloves garlic, about 1/2 T cumin, 1 T chili- pepper sauce and hot paprika instead of red pepper flakes, juice from half a lemon, 1 c clam broth, 1 c dry white wine, an extra 14.5 oz can of fire-roasted tomatoes. I used about 2.5 lbs of grouper, which was amazing. It freezes extremely well. I think next time I'll try bay scallops in addition to another firm white fish and some spinach. Very adaptable, obviously.

This is a simple casual dinner for a weeknight. Easy to prepare. Any type of firm white fish will work. We've even used fresh salmon from time to time, and also added peeled/deveined raw shrimp towards the last few minutes of cooking. Just a really fresh-tasting dish. Leftovers tend to get mushy.

I know it sounds silly but since they're the main ingredient, but I don't love red peppers so I omitted them altogether. I used a can of San Marzano tomatoes and added 2 cups of homemade veggie stock and a can of garbanzo beans. Finally, I added some cumin to complement the cilantro. This is great quick basic fish stew recipe that can be adapted to your mood.

This recipe has been a winner with family and guests. It is quick, easy and our new favorite comfort food. I do increase the garlic by 3 times and I do add a bit of vegetable broth or low-sodium chicken broth. I also use peppers from a jar and it does not compromise the recipe.

The flavor and simplicity of this dish were exceptional. It seemed thicker than I expected. I ended up serving it with spaghetti and it was a perfect sauce!

Fantastic! I like stews with a lot of liquid, so I suggest extra tomatoes, as well as more garlic, cilantro, and the addition of a little Old Bay.

My diner said it was good, but needed a little something more -- like a side of spinach, or serve it on a bed of rice. % minutes is too short to cook the fish (cod) -- go 6 to 10.

This recipe is great! I used tilapia for the fish, and I decreased the oil to 1 tbsp, and increased the garlic to 6 cloves. I also added turnips at the same time as tomatoes and bell peppers (cubed and pre-baked in the oven for 25 mins at 425 degrees). I also added turmeric and cumin along with the red pepper. It turned out delicious, and I got a few lunches out of the leftovers. It becomes tastier the longer it sits in the fridge, as the flavors blend more. It's also good cold if you don't feel like heating it up. Will definitely cook this again, perhaps will throw in some chopped fennel bulb next time.

I thought this recipe was great, you can easily throw this together as is for a weeknight meal, or add more varieties of seafood etc. to fancy it up, it's easy, healthy, and delicious, what else can you ask for?

This is a wonderful quick recipe to make with many ingredients on hand. I did have modify it by using both chopped fresh tomatoes as well as canned. I used a cup and a half of a local roasted red pepper relish called ayvar in place of fresh roasted peppers. I also added about 3 Tbsp of capers and extra red pepper. Didn't have lemons but I'm sure they would have added a nice tartness that I got out of about 2 Tbsp red vinegar.

Good recipe. I used some shrimp along with the fish which I think helped give it some better texture. I also added some Old Bay to give it some extra kick.

My fiance and I mmmmed over this superb, ridiculously simple stew for our Friday night supper. Monk fish worked well. I used fire roasted tomatoes and jarred roasted red peppers (a great time saver). I doubled the garlic and upped the lemon zest and cilantro. I also added the juice of half a lemon. We ate it straight up in bowls with good bread to sop up the juices. We felt like we were in a small seaside cafe rather than January in New York. Love it.

This was really good and really easy. I used Cod which was fine, but next time I'll use Halibut as I prefer it. Also, I used Muir Glen Fire-Roasted Tomatoes which seemed to enhance the pepper's flavor. This is a delicious, easy dish that will be great on chilly Autumn nights. Yum!

Rating: 3
For a quick, healthy stew, this is a keeper. I agree with another reviewer that I will used jarred roasted peppers next time. I used rock fish, which was the perfect consistency and very delicious. I also added a bit of chicken stock, as I didn't think there was quite enough liquid.

Had this at book club and had to make on my own. Came out just as good - easy recipe to follow. However, next time I might use jarred red peppers to save time.

This is a very average recipe. With so many good fish and seafood stew recipes available, it's obvious that this one is just a throw-a-few-things-together type-meal. It is nutritious, using fish, olive oil and vegetables. But it lacked any originality or depth in flavour.

Rich spectacular flavor. Tilapia works perfectly in this dish. I've made it a dozen times despite the annoyance of peeling 12 shallots!

This has quick become a favorite of mine. When I roast the peppers, I also roast some eggplant as my boyfriend loves eggplant added in. I add extra hot sauce and make it more spicy. This is a very good base from which to build your favorite stew.

Usually I like roasted peppers and cilantro, but they didn't work in this dish. Too much tomato? not enough cilantro? or do I just prefer other herbs with fish? I could see trying the recipe again without the hot pepper flakes and with other herbs (parsley, oregano or thyme), but then that would just be a different fish stew!

Rating: 4
This recipe has definitely become one of our favorite fish recipes. It works almost with any fish. I substituted lemon peel with lime peel and added the juice of 1/2 a lime. It was delicious! I like to serve it over a bed of fragrant basmati rice with a salad on the side.

What a pleasant surprise to find a dish that is so easy and healthy! To makes things EVEN easier, I used Trader Joe's fire-roasted peppers. They are as good as home made and make this dish 25 min start to finish. My low-carb friends loved this, as did my low-cholesterol mother!!! Definitely a keeper.

I've been thinking of new ways to cook fish other than baking or grilling... and this is it!!! Never thought fish would taste good in a stew. Love the flavor of the cilantro and the red bell peppers. To add a bit more liquid, I used about a 1/2 cup of Madeira and a bit of lemon juice.

The dish was good, but not spectacular. I added some lemon juice to brighten it up. though I did find the dish to be much better the next day. maybe it just needed more time for the flavors to mend.

Wonderful! This may take the place of my favorite fish stew I've been making for years...I halved the recipe for 2 people, but added all of the lime juice and about 1/2 bottle of clam juice. I used Halibut and it was delicious!

This was delicious, but I have to agree with my husband who said it was a bit much for an after-work recipe, particularly the chopping of 12 shallots. I took the advice of another reviewer and added 1/4--1/2 cup of chardonnay to make more liquid. I also cut the crushed red pepper to 1/2 tsp. and added 1/4 tsp. of chili garlic sauce. Next time I make this, I'll eliminate the crushed red pepper altogether and use 3/4 tsp. of chili garlic sauce. Delicious!

The charred peppers add an essential flavor to this stew. Fresh tomatoes would definitely be best, and this recipe needs much more red chile. I upped the amounts on all the spices/herbs, plus white wine for more broth, and it was excellent!

I thought this was a fine family-type recipe - not quite company quality. It could be stepped-up in elegance with some shell-fish. My husband doesn't like red peppers, so he was a "no", but I didn't agree. (I never know how to vote when we divide 50-50, but I put a "yes"!)

Rating: 2
This recipe was a little to tomato-y for my taste, however, my husband loved it and asked for it again. I used snapper instead of Halibut, just in case it was a flop. It was fairly easy to prepare and I will probably make it again for my husband but not for me.

Rating: 4
We don't like peppers, so I substituted mushrooms. Shallots, well, 12 seemed like a terribly expensive amount so I substituted 1 Spanish onion. My daughter is allergic to tomatoes so we left those out and added 2 cups of red wine. Left out crushed peppers, added lemon peel and we all dislike fish, so we substituted pork. It was amazing and no fishy smell.

I'm not a huge cilantro fan- so, I did fresh basil instead. I then bought marinated cilantro shrimp and scallop kebabs, which gave the cilantro flavor, but not too much. It was delicious! But my house smelled fishy the next day- it is definitely a more fishy recipe.

The base of this recipe was great, although I might increase the crushed red pepper as we like things extra spicy. We used Halibut though, and were not that excited at the results. I like the idea of trying shrimp...next time!

I've made this dish twice already. It's so simple and delicious! The changes I made were using jarred roasted red bell peppers instead, added more red pepper flakes and added a cup of clam juice to the sauce. First time I made it with cod and the second time with shrimp. My husband prefers the shrimp over fish...I loved them both! Thank you!

This is a light, flavorful, delicious dish!! I added some white wine (approx 1c)and served it over jasmine rice with sliced green onions mixed into it--this stretched it out enabling me to serve it to 2 additional guests who dropped by. Everyone raved! Next time I think I will add a little lemongrass for a little more lemony flavor.

This is a perfect meal for dinner. It's a snap to prepare. I used only one tbsp. of olive oil ,six shallots and one half of a vidalia onion. i also added 1/4 cup of white wine as recomended by other readers. I used swordfish and it was tender, tasty and great!

Served this last night for dinner and it was a tremendous hit with our guests and us! The nice thing about this recipe is you can prepare it up to putting in the cilantro and lemon peel (and fish) and then finish it easily without slaving in the kitchen. Served it with olive bread and a nice green salad with ersatz ranch-y dressing, a pinot gris (the perfect win for this dish), and rich vanilla ice cream with fresh raspberries. PS. Don't cheat and use prepared peppers and be sure to use real shallots...they impart a very delicate onion flavor that would be missing if you use even Vidalias. Fresh cilantro, of course.

Rating: 4
Wonderful stew! It was a little labor intensive though - all those shallots and peppers to chop! Actually, I'm a little confused about what constitutes 1 shallot - each of mine fell into 2 or 3 parts after peeling. Is each part considered a complete shallot (like garlic heads)? If so, then I only used about 6 shallots. This is the only recipe that I've made from this site that came out just like all the reviews said. I will make this again and again!

In our family this dish is known simply as "red fish" and is one of our staple meals. Around here it is also well-known as a traditional Morrocan recipe, but we add paprika and cumin for a more Middle-Eastern flavour. Try it!

Absolutely a wonderful recipe!!! I'm so glad I decided to switch to this for dinner tonight. I grilled a salad, opened a bottle of red wine, and was in absolute heaven!! I always try a recipe "as is" and then think how I would make it different - I wouldn't change a thing. The only thing that keeps coming to mind is veggies - like zucchini and carrots. Those would definately have to be sauteed with the onions. Or even fresh green beans and corn. Actually the possibilities are endless. But just the way it is delightful! (I forgot to say I did add 1/2 cup white wine - it was perfect. I am making it again today and a neighbor is making it for company today also!

We found this recipe much too tomatoey for our liking. Someone mentioned that they added white wine for depth, I would recommend that you do. I also found that peeling the peppers was a pain, I must need practice as this recipe was not quick for me.

This dish is a favorite in my family, even for my "I don't rally care for fish" son. I often add a half--cup or so of a decent white wine after the shallots are soft, adds a little depth to the flavor. I also use a variety of fishes-- any firm-fleshed fish works well, even a mixture of fish and shrimp if I'm short on fish! Using this recipe for monkfish is an instant hit. Serve oveer rice (either white or brown/wid) and yyo've got meal!
