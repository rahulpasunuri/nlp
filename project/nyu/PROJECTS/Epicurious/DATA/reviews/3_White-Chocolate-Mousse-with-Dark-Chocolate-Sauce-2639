This was very tasty, but I wasn't entirely happy with the texture of the mousse, that is, rich and creamy, but lacking any sense of airiness (which I love in my beloved Craig Claiborne chocolate mousse recipe). I may have been at fault -- I turned my back on the slow-melting white chocolate and it scorched on the bottom (had to run it through a sieve to get out the brown specks!), which may have affected it. I expect I'll try again, since it was quite a hit. Less corn syrup, though!

Definitely does not need the additional corn syrup! Go easy if you do use it.

Definitely scrumptuous! Must use the best and freshest ingredients for this one!

When I made this mousse the chocolate mixture was too thick to fold in with my whip cream and in the end turned out to be a disaster. Maybe next time I will try another white chocolate or use less corn syrup.

I thought this was absolutely wonderful. Made it for our Valentine's Dinner (obviously reviewing it some time later) and thouroughly enjoyed every rich and luscious spoonful. Will make it again!

I served this in tiny cups with raspberries for a dessert buffet. I really think it's a bit too sweet as is. (And I do have a sweet tooth). Next time maybe I'll eliminate the corn syrup or make sure there's more raspberries to offset the sweetness.

This was an easy but very good dessert. Very enjoyable by everyone in my family and my boyfriend's family. I would most definately make this anytime.
