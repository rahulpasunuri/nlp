My wife and I have been making these cookies annually for Christmas since 2001 if I recall correctly. I don't actually like sugar cookies... EXCEPT these. They are absolutely delicious, and I look forward to them every year. They are inextricably linked with Christmas in my mind. A tip: don't skimp on the vanilla. Absolutely DO NOT use imitation vanilla extract. My wife once accidentally used twice the amount because we bought some Madagascar Bourbon double-strength vanilla, and she forgot to adjust the recipe. It was a fortuitous mistake, and we are sure to make it every year!

I make these every year for my annual tree trimming party and they are a huge hit. An adult take on a kid classic, probably the most amazing, though simple, cookies ever.

I really like this recipe although it says that you don't need to greese the pan, you do. Or i put one on those silicone liners on.

This recipe just did not do it for me. The only change I made was to not chill the dough. I used all the correct ingredients and simply rolled the dough into balls and then in some sanding sugar. I was hoping, like other reviewers, that my cookies would turn out crisp but they were really soft. A little crisp on the very outside edges but mostly soft. The flavor was only so so. I have much better sugar cookie recipes. I used 2 expensive vanilla beans for this?!! Yeah, I was disappointed. I won't make again.

These are the best sugar cookies ever! I rolled them and cut them into Christmas shapes for the holidays and sprinkled with colored sugar. I rolled the dough thin and the cookies were deliciously crisp. They are addictive! We'll be making them again as heat shapes for Valentines Day.

So yummy! I just rolled dough into balls,rolled the balls in red and green decorating sugar for Christmas, and flattened them a bit--and they turned out great! Very soft, with a very vanilla taste!

I made the recipe exactly how it was written with the exception of substituting Nielsen-Massey Vanilla Bean Paste (per the directions on the bottle) for the vanilla bean. The cookies came out very flat and crispy. Next time, I will try forming balls and see if I can get a softer cookie. They are good but not great.

Delicious. Instead of dealing with vanilla beans, I used two teaspoons of vanilla bean paste and no extract. It added a really nice vanilla bean flavor and all the lovely little flecks, and with less mess/hassle.

Yummy for your Vanilla craved tummy. I let the dough chill for a full day and then baked them a day before I needed them. Vanilla Overload---- just the way a Vanilla Bean cookie should be. :)

This could be our all time favorite cookie. I used butter in place of shortening, and didn't refrigerate the dough. Instead, I formed balls, rolled them in granulated sugar, placed in a mini- muffin pan and pressed a Hershey kiss in the center of each. The vanilla beans make them a bit pricey, but worth it. Making them again, for the second time this week!

Super delicious. Used butter rather than veg shortening. Placed Ganache between 2 cookies. Very special dessert...especially for "just a cookie". Make at least a double batch!

These were the best sugar cookies evah! Instead of forming dough into a log and cutting, I refrigerated the dough and then formed into a ball. They came out crisp but soft on the inside! The real vanilla beans really made a difference...

I didn't have vanilla beans so I just used vanilla extract. It wasn't as fragrant as I had hoped so maybe that was the fault of the vanilla extract. This cookie isn't too bad though.

I made these for a cookies exchange party and they were voted Best Tasting. They are truly delicious. I used all butter and formed dough into slightly flattened balls. Then drizzled the tops with chocolate for prettiness.

I used a different base recipe that was a bit easier and bigger, but used the real vanilla beans as suggested and people raved! Who knew sugar cookies could be so popular! I'm about to make another batch for Christmas eve.

This wasn't exactly what I was looking for although they tasted very good. The cookie this recipe produced for me had an excellent taste but was very thin and crisp. I did chill the dough for about an hour then rolled into balls coated with sugar. Next time will keep in the cylinder and slice and bake to see if the texture changes at all. I do prefer a chewier, softer sugar cookie but these were definitely good in their own genre.

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of substituting spelt flour for wheat flour to accomodate my no-wheat diet. I shaped the cookies into small wafers, and they cooked up crispy and light as air. Served them up with gelato - wonderful, basic recipe.

amazing cookies! after testing the recipe once, made 6 double batches for end-of-school-year gifts. bought 82% butterfat butter (skipped the shortening!), fresh vanilla beans from the healthfood store, and used good madagascar vanilla. rolled well-chilled dough into small balls, rolled them in vanilla sugar, and flattened them with a glass till they were pretty thin, as i wanted to sandwich them. sandwiched them with scharffen berger bittersweet ganache. the bittersweet chocolate was just wonderful with the sweet cookie! my daughter packaged them in white boxes with "windows" using printed tissue paper and double-sided fabric ribbon to tie the handles together. an extravagant, lovely gift!

The cookies were delicious but it was such a pain to remove the vanilla seeds from the bean that it wasn't quite worth it.

These cookies were a little too sweet and crispy for our taste. Next time we might try using all butter, rolling them into balls instead and put less sugar. not sure if this was worth 2 of our vanilla beans from Tahiti.

Fabulous cookies. These are so good when they're just out of the oven, you'll have to stop yourself from eating them all. Next time I think I'll make a double batch.

Good - but VERY sweet. Be sure to use fresh vanilla beans (the pod will be moist).

These are the best sugar cookies I have ever eaten. I made them with green and red sugar for Christmas and they were gone in five minutes. For Valentine's Day I doubled the recipe, rolled them out and cut them with heart-shaped cookie cutters. A great place to find less expensive vanilla beans is an Indian Food market. Also, try a Latino Food market as well. Quality beans from Madagascar made these cookies amazing!

In my humble opinion, these must be the world's most perfect cookies. Especially while they're still warm out of the oven. I, too, made them as drop cookies after chilling the dough for about an hour so it wouldn't spread too much and become crispy. (I'm a chewy cookie kind of person.) I think these are best as is with no additional embellishments. Will definitely be making again!

I made these cookies for my children's kindgarten graduation. They were wonderful. I also rolled them into balls and dipped them in sugar. I am looking forward to making Christmas cookies with this recipe.

These where just beautiful! I chilled the dough and used a sugar dipped mellon baller to keep the cookies uniform. I made a bittersweet ganache and sandwiched them Milano style as suggested by other reviewers! I put them in pretty paper boxes wrapped in brown paper and tied them with twine. People couldn't believe I made them which says alot because they all know I'm a good cook. I bought the beans at my local healthfood store and they were much cheaper than the supermarket. I will absolutely make these again!

I made these at Christmas and topped with tons of red sugar sprinkles. They were beautiful and the rich vanilla taste made the price of the two beans (@&6.00) well worth it.

Made these this weekend and tried the great suggestion of turning them into Pep Farm "Milano" style cookies. Yum! I've found that a lot of Gourmet/Bon Apetit cake recipes that call for ganache frosting leave a lot leftover, so I just freeze the ganache for later uses like this one. My one tip about the cookies- don't let them cool on the pan for more than a minute- they really need to come off quickly because they set up quickly. Mine were done between 7 and 8 minutes instead of the 10-12. Used sugar in the raw for rolling, seemed to add more sweetness than regular sugar. ALso, I used all butter instead of shortening and they still tasted crisp enough to me.

I typically don't like slice and bake cookies, as they are too thin and crisp for my taste, so here's what I did. I made the dough as directed, did not chill it, rolled the dough into balls, rolled the balls in sugar, and then flattened slightly with a sugar-dipped glass, as for traditional sugar cookies. The dough was very easy to handle, even without chilling. Made 24 cookies, baked them at 350 for 10 minutes, and they were perfect. I also sprinkled on a little nutmeg before baking, because I love nutmeg. Thanks to the cook who mentioned Milano's, because I think sandwiching these with some good chocolate ganache sounds wonderful for next time. (I'd leave out the nutmeg for that version, though.)

Absolutely fantastic cookies!!!! I did find that vanilla beans at the grocery store are OUTRAGEOUS.... But Quick fix.... I went to my local Health food store and got 2 whole Vanilla beans for $1.69, they may vary in price depending on where you live but they were much less expensive and much fresher than the grocery store.... Excellent recipe, a must try!

Simply perfect. Incredible Vanilla flavor. I used a little lard 2T with the butter to make them extra crispy. Don't use Vanilla Extract only you need beans to give it the real flavor.

Family and friends love these cookies :) Very easy to make and taste wonderful. I bake them longer and use all butter, I now always keep a roll in the fridgefro those times when a quick cookie fix is needed.

These cookies were wonderfully crisp, and even after a few days in the cookie jar, still held on to that crisp from oven texture. Was pleased as to how it held it shape. I will try them to decorate next time, this time I just settled for making a big batch to last the week, 3 days the double batch I made was GONE. At my home that is how they say, hum, yes mom, make them again, Great any time of the year,

My four year old grandaughter and I made these today. They were wonderful, crispy around the edges and full of flavor. Expensive to make when using two vanilla beans. We will definately make these again. Perhaps with a little less sugar next time.

Delicious! My husband said they were like a cookie version of Breyers vanilla ice cream (which he loves). I used all butter. Also, instead of vanilla beans I decided to give William Sonoma's vanilla paste a try and it worked beautifully. I always use WS's Madagascar vanilla extract, which has more flavor than the supermarket stuff. I made the dough Thursday night, baked the cookies Friday night and served them as part of dessert on for a Father's Day dinner on Sunday. Everyone loved them and thought they were incredibly vanilla-y. Maybe the tiniest bit too sweet? I wonder if phc either didn't use very high quality ingredients or didn't give the flavors time to develop.

Loved these cookies. I prefer very simple deserts and adore vanilla so these were perfect for me. I cooked them a drop over the recommended time, so they were a bit crispy. Sort of reminds me of the cookie part of Pepperidge Farm's "Milano's" (which I love). They went over very big w/my family.
