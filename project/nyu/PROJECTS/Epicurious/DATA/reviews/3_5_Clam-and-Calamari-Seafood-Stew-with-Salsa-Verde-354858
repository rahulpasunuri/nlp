This marks my favorite cuisine! I tried it at home and the tastes was really great -- making my day complete. Thanks for such a good recipes you have. Unlike the Prawn Tales with Beer that Ive discovered from www.gourmandia.jp, its very disappointing. I just waste my money in that disgusting menu.

This was very good. I would definitely make this again but with some big changes. On a weeknight it's a lot to make you're own fish broth and I don't know if it's really necessary. I guess I would alter this to make it a bit more of a saucy tomato/Italian style dish. I'd saute the onions/garlic in olive oil and white wine, add tomato paste, then add a big can of chopped tomatoes. Then throw shrimp, scallops, white fish and squid in. I loved the other cook's suggestion of cooking it until the seafood turns color and then turning off the heat, covering for ten minutes. That's a great way of not undercooking or covercooking the seafood. Comes out nice and tender. Serve with linguini and garlic bread...amazing, amazing meal.

I changed this a little and we liked how delicate it turned out. I didn't use clams, but used squid, prawns and leftover whitefish salad from a tapas night we'd had. I used the broth I made with the bones, etc., but also added a little dashi (Japanese fish stock from bonito) and a teensy bit of clamato juice. I let the seafood get just warm enough to start changing color and then turned off the fire and covered it for 10 minutes. Everything was tender and super tasty! Also, I made little garlic toasted rounds for the bottom of the bowl. I think you could actually add something like borlotti beans for texture and added flavor and it would be yummy!
