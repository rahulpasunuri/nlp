I substituted grapefruit for the tomatoes and it was delicious.

Went very well with the Butternut Squash Ravioli recipe found on this site. I could not find chicory, so substituted Belgium Endive, beautiful and delicious. Don't pre-spread your goat cheese toasts though, they dried out and even though taste was not affected, presentation was.

The toasted pine nuts give this salad an especially wonderful texture!
