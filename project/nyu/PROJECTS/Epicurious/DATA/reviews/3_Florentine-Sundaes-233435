Surly, you seem to be intolerant by your own admission. I will attempt more civility than yourself. I DID make the recipe substituting another cookie and rated based on that. Since it is more of an assembly than a recipe to begin with, I assume users are more than able to either find a substitute cookie or make their own florentines, which I have done, but not this time since I was going for convenience. I am, in fact, not too inept to find the ingredients, but was merely pointing out the fact that not everyone will be able to purchase this particular cookie, because it is not available for purchase in all areas. Oddly, you gave no rating, and it seems that you are the one who didn't make the recipe.

How can you rate the recipe when you are too inept to find the inredients for which it calls? If you want to mention an alternate ingredient and how it turned out, great, but don't rate it low just because you cannot make the recipe!

I loved this dessert. I made my own floentines And served all in champagne glasses. So simple, but so elegant and so good.

I couldn't find florentine cookies anywhere.
