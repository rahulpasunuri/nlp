I made these twice, the first batch I had to toss. The second I baked for 28 minutes and they were still so gooey that I could barely get them out of the pan. I loved the flavor, but the texture was mushy. I probably will not try a third time, but if I did, I would add more flour and lose an egg.

To find the glaze recipe that goes with these bars, click on the cook book title above. I haven't made the bars or the glaze. The glaze looks kind of involved to me, yet I'm curious to try it!

This was the first time I made this dessert and my whole family greatly enjoyed it! The cinnamon was a great addition and adds a fantastic warmth to the chocolate. The vanilla extract wasn't really prominent so if you are a fan you might want to slightly increase the amount of it. Also, there was no glaze recipe included so I had to go find one for the topping. I guess the glaze is what makes up the 'fudge' part of the title, because otherwise there isn't really a fudge part to this. However, the description of it being a play on a brownie was correct and oh how delicious it was!
