I made this with slivered, toasted almonds and added some Parmesan cheese as well. Very tasty indeed. A keeper.

I put salt and lemon on the endive before I put it in the oven, and left off the cheese. I'll try it with cheese next time.

I made this for a dinner party, despite the previous terrible review that I read above, and it was wonderful. I baked the endive without any covering for half an hour. When it started to brown I covered it and baked another 10 minutes, then uncovered it and put on plenty of cheese and walnuts. I put it back in the oven for another 10-15 minutes uncovered and with the heat turned off. Everyone loved it and it was very easy to prepare. I would definitely make it again.

Thank you, Atlanta, for critiquing this recipe for us. I love endive dishes, but I certainly won't waste my time on this one.

Blech! I love roasted/grilled endive, but this was awful! It came out watery and most unappetizing. I would not cover this during cooking. No, make that I would not make this again, but rather would stick to grilling oil/salt/pepper-brushed endive halves on a grill. We threw this away, it was so bad.
