This salad dressing just didn't do it for me. I love each of the ingredients separately, but did not care for the combination.

I used this on a salad of romaine, peppers, tomatoes, red onion and baby corn. It worked very well. I just had to add a bit of salad oil.

I used this as a sauce for pork loin roast. Just the ticket, with a little zip. Now, I will have to try it on salad as was intended!!
