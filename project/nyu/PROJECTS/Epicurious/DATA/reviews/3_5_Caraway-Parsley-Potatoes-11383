Thought this was a perfect dish to accompany a hearty beef stew made with dark beer, brandy, beef stock and dried fruits. The toasted, crushed caraway adds great flavor.

This is a great potato recipe. The toasted and crushed caraway seeds are much more aromatic and versatile than raw whole seeds. I was reluctant to try this recipe because I am not a huge fan of caraway. I'm so glad I took a chance! I've also made it with olive oil and I think it's just as good if not better! I think you have to cook the potatoes a little longer than is suggested here.

Excellent accompaniment to James Beard's classic Corned Beef and Cabbage recipe. His is the first recipe I've ever seen that doesn't throw everything together in the pot, and actually suggests serving the corned beef with parsley potatoes cooked separately. Just like my great grandmother from county Cork used to do. With vegetarians in the house in St. Paddy's Day, it was the perfect solution to having corned beef, but being able to let the vegetarians have a little tase of the ol' Irish too!
