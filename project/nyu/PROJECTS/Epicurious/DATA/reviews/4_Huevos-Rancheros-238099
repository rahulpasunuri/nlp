Wow! What an easy flavorful dish. I made over easy eggs and used the black bean mash from this recipe http://www.bonappetit.com/blogsandforums/blogs/badaily/2012/09/breakfast-tostadas-sprouted-ki.html I also topped the dish with de Marss Rooster Sauce which really complimented the flavors. This is defiantly going into my recipe box!

I like poached eggs instead of fried - they're soft, and when topped with melted shredded colby/monterey jack, they look like eggs benedict. I also serve with refried beans because I am used to the combination of flavors - the corn tortilla, the egg, and the beans - oh, and sour cream.

Very good and easy. The warm salsa is particularly tasty and I would recommend it for salsa with chips.

My boyfriend and I made this for a quick, easy, and cheap dinner. It was very tasty and satisfying! Adding a dollop of sour cream and avocado makes a world of difference. I'm also of the opinion you can't over due it on the cilantro. I added extra hot sauce to top it off because I like it spicy. I'm surprised the recipe calls for tomatoes out of a can. I think it would taste better fresh.

As is the recipe is very easy, fast to make, relatively healthy and delicious. As others have stated, it's also an outstanding base to a almost equally easy decadent brunch dish. Cook up some black beans with onions and cilantro and garlic that are already out for this recipe; top the whole thing with shredded cheese (cheddar and/or cotija), sour cream, avocados; heat up the sauce with your favorite pepper combo -- the possibilities are really endless and don't add a ton of effort.

Great recipe--it's a comfort food classic in our house now. The only change I make is that I double the sauce recipe (we love the leftovers) and poach the eggs in it, like my mom used to do with leftover tomato sauce.

Great recipe and easy to make. A dab of sour cream on top and fresh cilantro make a difference!

This is a Saturday morning favorite for us. The procedure of placing to prepared tortillas on layer of the sauce first is terrific. Then lay over the eggs, toping again. I added green onion, chopping them in 1/4 - 1/2 lengths using scissors at the last minute. This dish is "meaty" tasting and in texture without actual meat. Well done. One more thing: I didn't follow the caveat of not letting the tortillas brown or crisp, find that the amount of liquid (sauce) under and over them gave a lot of room. Found them tastier a little browned and crunchy. This was nice job.

I make this for my B&B guests with the following substitutions. I use Delmonte stewed tomatoes for the Rancheros sauce. I also add a layer of black beans, then the eggs which I poach vs. frying. Always receives raves!

Very easy, very delish, and something everyone really likes. Definitely a regular for weekend breakfasts. I've made this several times as per the recipe with two exceptions - had to use chipotle chilli powder instead of chipotle in sauce. Also, I like to serve it with sides of shredded cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. Might try serving with refried beans as well next time.

Made a frittata with roasted corn left over from the romaine, roasted corn & avocado in June Gourmet (great recipe!). Topped with this salsa/sauce recipe and it was delicious. Definitely a keeper.

I made a variation of this, but used tomato paste and thinned it with some broth. I also skipped the blending part and just sauteed onions and garlic, then added the other ingredients. I couldn't believe how good it was for such a simple recipe. I also served this on a bed of black beans from the can and skipped the tortillas because I didn't have any.

Great sauce, and easy to do for brunch for many--you can cook the eggs to order as your guests like them. I added black beans and sliced avocado. Hearty and satisfying!

I didn't think I would like this combination of flavors, but I think it's great, and my sons (9 and 12) practically inhale this. A big hit in our house.

We love this recipe and as others have said, it is all about the ranchero sauce! Rather than cooking the tortillas in a skillet, I lay them one at a time directly on the grate of my gas burner over a medium flame and flip them every few seconds until they are warm, soft and slightly chared in spots. I also love to top with a bit of mexican blend cheese and diced avocado...yum!

The dish in its entirety is fabulous. But what we really, really love is the sauce. We've already prepared the sauce many times over to eat as salsa with store bought tortila chips. Every time we serve the "salsa" to our guests, we get asked for the recipe. It is also delicious over plain scrambled egg or your favoirte omlette. One little tip: I reduced the chipotle to 1/2 table spoon. You could always add more after tasting it. Just make sure you taste it while it is still in the food processor bowl, so you can add more and blend it. Also, the salsa tastes great served slightly warmed.

A surprisingly good variation on this classic. The chipotle with adobo definitely "makes" the salsa; don't substitute or omit it.
