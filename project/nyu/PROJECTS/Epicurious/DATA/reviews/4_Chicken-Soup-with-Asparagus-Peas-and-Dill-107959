I have made this numerous times. I like to add 2 diced chicken breasts to cook in the stock. I also add about 2-3 handfuls of spinach at the last minute for a more filling meal.

Very nice but not extraordinary.

Such a simple recipe but what a wonderful dish. It's full of flavour - all ingredients complement each other beautifully.

This was delicious, with all its simplicity.Leftover was just as good 5 days later as the first day. A good way to add vegetables to a meal too.

Beautiful soup - Nice impression and very nice party pleaser; quality of stock important, though I used Swanson's Low Sodium Chicken Broth and it was very good. I am trying it again with Swanson's Organic Free Range Chicken Broth... Does anyone recall what the Yarden Blanc de Blanc originally paired with this soup tastes like? Could anyone vouch for it? I tried buying it, but could never get a bottle, and ended up drinking a Veuve Clicquot instead. Would anyone recommend a great white (available in US) to go with this besides champagne?

Really Easy and gets loads of compliments.

Great, but depends on how good your stock is.
