Delicious! You might have to reduce the baking time if you use potatoes that cook quickly, such as Yukon Golds. As other reviewers mentioned, it doesn't really need so much oil. I used about half the amount specified.

Easy to make and tasty. I made a few modifications: added rosemary and thyme with the dried oregano, reduced oil (per other comments), and omitted fresh oregano. Also I find that garlic tends to burn if added at beginning so I added it with the lemon juice. Finally I adore lemon so to up the lemon flavour I added a bit of zest with the garlic.

Absolutely exquisite and so easy to make, it is definitely going to become one of my most frequently used recipes!

I make these for my husband all the time. He loves them!! I put a little less olive oil than the recipe calls for; pretty much just toss the potatoes to coat. I also usually don't put in the fresh oregano at the end - it doesn't seem to make a big difference either way.

Light and flavorful. Easy to fix. I would let the potatoes cook for 15-20 minutes before putting the chicken on the cooking platter. Cooking it all for 45 minutes slightly overcooks the chicken. I saved the left over sauce and mixed with a can of diced tomatoes for a light pasta sauce the next evening.

My boyfriend really liked how this turned out. I thought it was a bit mushy and a bit too lemony. I think I put in too much chicken stock, but oh well. I liked the oregano and garlic but would add much less lemon juice next time, but the idea of roasting, then adding liquid and roasting more.

I added a few more herbs like rosemary and thyme, and it was absolutely delicious.

Easy and excellent. I reduced olive oil and lemon juice to 1/4 cup each and omitted the fresh oregano. Also reduced salt to 1/2 tsp.

Awesome. Better than my yia-yia's! As others mentioned, you don't need quite as much oil as the recipe says. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it turned out great.

I made these for a family dinner. Definitely a hit!! I tossed the potatoes with the oil, garlic and herbs rather than pour the oil over as the recipe suggests. Another time I would try 1/4 - 1/3 cup of oil as there was lots left in the bowl after tossing.

These were wonderful!! I served them with a leg of lamb roast as part of an Easter menu. I used a combination of red, yellow, and blue small potatoes and halved them. While the lamb was resting after cooking, I took the pan drippings and used that instead of beef or chicken stock (I skimmed off the fat first). The last step of baking after adding lemon juice required about 20 minutes for me. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I agree with everyone... these are awesome. I served them with tri-tip with roasted red pepper sauce (also on this site).

I quartered the potatoes, so increased cooking time a bit for the larger size. These were really delicious! They came out tasting very authentic and I got rave reviews. Yum!

It was very flavorful, but had too much lemon. To cut the lemon flavor, I added parmesan cheese after the potatoes finished cooking.

I was making this recipe for a dinner party and wanted to do as much as possible ahead of time. I did the first two roastings in the afternoon then covered the pan with foil and let it sit on the counter. I did the final roasting with the lemon juice right before serving. Worked perfectly. I gave this 3 forks because I didn't think this was that much better than oven-roasted red-skinned potatoes, and it was quite a bit more work.

Really great recipe - served it to my husband and parents and the entire dish was devoured within minutes!

This was good and it was different. All at my dinner party enjoyed it. Would make again. Served the potatoes with smoked turkey breast, roasted asparagus with feta, glazed baby carrots, and topped it all off with pouched pears on pound cake covered in chocolate sauce. It worked.

This dish was exceptionally good. My daughter convinced me to make it using red garnet sweet potatoes rather than regular potatoes. I was a little skeptical of the whole thing. Somehow the lemon juice seemed completely out of place. Well, was I ever wrong. The dish was superb and the lemon juice was not over powering. Instead it complemented the flavors of the oregano and garlic. This is one of the best potato dishes I've ever had. deserves 5 forks. We made it with African Spiced Chicken, also a winner!

This was an easy and excellent preparation. I've made it exactly according to directions, by guessing at quantities, by throwing everything in the pan at once, and underneath rack-roasted lamb. Works every time, and everyone loves it.

These were very good and a twist on my usual rosemary roasted potatoes. Easy to make, as part of a Greek-themed meal, and definitely fit the bill. Will become part of my monthly repertoire.

Wow. We followed the recipe exactly and it was truly excellent. I usually tweak or experiment with the orginal recipe, but I am not sure I would change anything with this one.

I also added extra lemon and it took about 30 minutes longer for the potatoes to become tender. After adding the fresh herbs at the end, I covered the potatoes with foil and let them stand 10 min for the flavors to meld.

The lemony potatoes cut the richness of the lamb...very nice side dish.

I made these with the Gourmet (Aug 1993) Crab Cake recipe. I received rave reviews on both dishes! The great thing about this recipe is that the potatoes do not have that oily appearance or flavor like the kind you find at many greek restaurants. I will be making these again and, when cooking them for myself, I will add more lemon.

I love this recipe! The first time I tried this recipe, I made it exactly as written. The second time, i decreased the amount of oil and increased the amount of broth and it was still delicious! Substituted fresh oregano with a bit of chopped italian flat leaf parsley.

Absolutely excellent recipe. Its perfect for breakfast, and easily modified (I always use crushed red pepper as well). I've modified it to use rosemary, herbs de provence or thyme instead of the oregano.

I've probably made this recipe 50 times now. It's simple and delectable - great with almost any grilled meat. I reduce the amount of oil to 1/4 cup with no adverse consequences.

These potatoes were fantastic. However, I love potatoes, so perhaps I'm easy to please. The test was my potato- hating partner, who not only had seconds, but was mopping up the extra sauce with bread. Wonderful!

Excellent! I did bake the potatoes another 10-15 minutes longer on the second baking and they were perfect. I loved the citrus kick from the lemon. I didn't have fresh oregano and it didn't need it. These will be made again!

G-R-E-A-T!. This has become a staple in our house. I serve with souvlaki and tzatziki. I never have fresh oregano so I just use dry, and it's still yummy

I made this recipe for my husband and I to go along with roast pork. Since there were only 2 of us, I used a small amount of potatoes and just sort of guessed at the amount of the rest of the ingredients. My husband is a huge fan of lemon potatoes and always orders them at Greek restaurants. This is the first time I made them at home. These potatoes turned out perfect and delicious. My husband commented, "I think this is my new favorite meal. If I was served this in a restaurant I would definitely be back!" I will definitely add this recipe to my regular repertoire.

Awesome! I don't measure anything just follow the steps and they turn out fabulous! I don't find them too 'fussy' and the Tzazikki on the side -oh yeah!

I served these with Chicken with Olives and Feta cheese for my Bulgarian family. A great combination of Greco-Balkan dishes. The only variance to the recipe that I adopted was to use a medley of smaller potates (white, red and purple), halved (as suggested) and not peeled. Just before serving I drizzled additional E.V.Olive Oil over them. Delicious. Other reviewers have suggested that this (and other mediterranean recipes) are too oily. Nonsense. It's Olive Oil, guys. It's good for you. We practically drink the stuff in my house. The bottom line is that this dish will become a regular visitor to my table.

I used half the amount of oil and still found them to be too oily. Also, the recipe calls for them to be in the oven for too long. The lemon juice was a nice touch, but I wouldn't make them again.

Delicious recipe. I cut olive oil in half, exchanged black pepper for a dash of cayenne, used more potatoes and sliced potatoes in disks with a mandolin, and baked for 15 minutes longer. I ended up with 1 1/2 inches of potatoes up the side of a 9x12 pan.

I thought these were really nice. I've never roasted potatoes quite this way and was really impressed.

These are truly scrumptious. Several people around the table singled them out for compliments and a few asked for the recipe. Next time I will just cut down on the amount of oil.

Excellent recipe....easy....very generous in its portion size....definitely recommend the broiler option at the end...and although we didn't do it...the tzatziki option would be great...

I have made many versions of this classis Greek recipe, but this is the best. Flavourful, juicy, and fabulous with souvlaki and tzatziki! A keeper.

Very tasty, just like in one of our favourite Greek restaurants. I broiled it at the end to make them a little crisp around the edges. Served it with tabouleh, saganaki, spiced herb marinade for fish (from this site) and a greek salad. Was a really nice meal.

These potatoes always get me lots of recipe requests--I love to make them for company. However, the recipe is a bit time consuming (lots of checking), so make it on a Sunday or another day when you'll be around the house.

We thought this was only so-so. It was a little too lemony. If I try it again I'll vary the recipe. Maybe some more aromatic spices would give it some flavor other than lemon.

I never put lemon on potatoes before I found this recipe. I don't know if it's the four-step process of tending/making these or the lemon, but these potatoes always seem dressed up. They go well with anything you would normally add lemon to (like fish, chicken or pork). So mushy (as mine keep turning out) or crispy, they really do heighten any meal. I've gotten a lot of compliments on these.

These potatoes are fantastic! Very moist and flavorful. Like I do with all recipes, I added a bit more herbs (thyme and a little basil) and more garlic.

Great recipe which gets even better with a small pinch of red pepper flakes. I turn the broiler on for the last few minutes to get these nice and brown. You get a lot of the herb olive oil mixture, but it keeps very well for a long time in the fridge, honest.

Yummy! I didn't have oregano, so I used a Greek seasoning blend (which was mostly oregano anyway). I cut my cubes small (1" or so) and they were done in the allotted time. Served with bratwurst and sauteed zucchini.

great twist on roasted potatoes. i used 'butter gold' and cut them in quarters. highly recommend broiling them at the end. fresh fresh lemons work best, of course.

Made this with redskins, and won't do that again. The texture of the bakers is much more what I was hoping for, despite the great flavor. Our local Greek restaurant makes the most incredible potatoes, and I was hoping for that. Next time, with increase in liquids, and different potatoes........(and there will be a next time). Oh, yes, it definitely takes longer to finish than stated.

These were great. I had them cook a little extra so they were brown and crispy. No need to broil. Delicious!

This was great served next to lamb. I finished it in the broiler for about five minutes. Perfect. With all the good organic chicken stock on the market, in boxes so you don't have to refrigerate, there's no reason to ever use salty bouillon cubes anymore.

A big hit at the Easter dinner party. Paired well with the mustard fennel pork with cumberland pan sauce also on this site. I added more garlic, OF COURSE. I found it needed to be cooked a lot longer, but other than that, brilliant!

Very yummy. Made this with our Easter ham. I had to add a little extra water in the end. No need for broiling the top as the potatoes were very brown already. A little salty though. I would either omit the salt or the 1/4 chicken boullion cube next time. Our kids liked it too!!
