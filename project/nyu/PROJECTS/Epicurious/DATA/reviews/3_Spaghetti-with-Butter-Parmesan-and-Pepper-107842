This is such a basic recipe, with a few modifications it is very good. I substituted about 1/4 cup olive oil for the butter (for health reasons), added about 2 - 3 tsp of Herbs de Provence,and 3 - 4 tablespoons of raspberry vinegar for acidity. Really easy and very flavorful. Next time I will gently cook a couple of cloves of garlic in the olive oil before I add it to the pasta. I also used a lot of S&P because I love it. Overall, a nice dish.

I really enjoyed this meal. It was quick and easy to make. The only thing was it was kind of bland. So I added some italian seasoning and some fresh bell peppers for extra flavor.

I have only had this with fresh, homemade pasta so I might be biased. It's simple to make and it's a great base to add whatever else you want. I have added cut up leftover ham with some thawed frozen peas, but I'm sure any meat/veggie combination would be a winner.

This recipe has potential to be FAB if made the way I do. I use 1.5tbs of I Cant Believe Its Not Butter- and trust me, the tastes in butter make a diff- A LOT of fresh ground pepper, garlic, basil, salt (all to taste) and SKIM MILK to replace a lot of the cut back on butter. Its SO INCREDDIBLY light and the taste definately give it four forks. Since the pasta has little color and presentational appeal, I like to top it with freshly grate parm.regg. cheese and parsley or basil. I PROMISE with these alterations, YOULL FALL IN LOVE

I think this is a wonderful dish. Add some seared chicken breasts flavored with italian herbs and spices and it is a fine meal.

A good, basic recipe. Easy and quick to make, but homemade pasta is a must in my opinion.

This was very easy to make and we did like it but I would not make it again. It was very heavy and for the calories I would prefer something else.

This recipe is fantastic. I have made it twice in the past week. The second time I cut the butter in half and it was just as good, but not so heavy.

This is proof that a recipe need not be complicated to be good. While I am not usually a pasta person, this was the perfect accompaniment for Chicken Marsala. The flavor was mild enough not to compete with the distinctive taste of the marsala, yet the classic flavors in tbe pasta could stand on their own. My only criticism is that number of servings (listed as four) was underestimated. I would say a more accurate estimate would be six to eight. We halved the recipe and had four good-sized servings with no leftovers. Also, the next time I try the recipe, I might add in a little dried parsley at the end so as to have a few flecks of color for a more attractive presentation!
