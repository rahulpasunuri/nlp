These are delicious. You have to be careful with the oven time so that they don't over cook, but the raisins and pecorino are a unique combination. I had these with a small portion of spaghetti, a simple mesclun salad with truffle oil viniagrette and a bottle of red wine. Great Saturday night dinner. I actually live down the street from Frankie's, these meatballs do them justice ;)

These meatballs were good, but I was really disappointed with the flavor given the reviews. The exception was the raisins, which were a really nice touch, so I'm planning on continuing to use those in my meatballs.

These are the best meatballs I've ever eaten. I made them exactly to specifications, along with the Frankies' sauce linked to in the recipe, which is also great.

These are the best meatballs I have ever made. I think I learned from this recipe that I have been over-cooking meatballs in the past by cooking them in the sauce too long. Cooked this way they are nice and tender. The pine nuts and raisins are great, although I prefer raisins chopped up a little bit first. As far as I am concerned, these are perfect.

Question: what would traditionally be served with the meatballs?

This is one of the best recipes I have tried from Epicurious. The sauce was easy. My only adaptations were to drain some of the fat from the sauce, use a hand held mixer, just a bit after 3 hours cooking to make it more like a sauce. I made the meatballs with only one change: I chopped up the raisins. This really works and is fun to make.

I've been wanting meatballs like I had at a friend's family's house years ago. These tasted exactly how I remembered, and were very tender, too. I omitted the raisins and pine nuts to be more like their version. This will be my meatball recipe for life.

...toasting the pine nuts would have been a good thing,and I added way more cheese, maybe about 1 cup in total...Rao's are way better! and way more tender. Will not make these again. However, the tomato sauce is terrific!

To Janet in Cyprus, 15 turns on my pepper grinder was about 3 grams, or about half a teaspoon.

I haven't made it yet, but plan to. I just became a member and will print this recipe now and will make it soon. Then I will rate.

Yum! And I forgot the Romano when I served it, and it was still delish! Really liked the raisins & pine nuts, and the meatballs were moist & tender, and didn't fall apart. One caveat: do oil the baking sheet if it's not non-stick.

While I haven't made these yet, one quick question, as I can't get unground white pepper where I live, how much is 15 turns? Thanks for any help you can give me.

This is how my family makes meatballs, except sub milk for the water. The raisins are the best part, don't leave them out! I make mine golf-ball size and brown the outside in olive oil before putting them in the sauce to cook thru. I have fond memories of learning how to mix the ingredients by hand with my grandma. She never measured anything, but this recipe is the closest I've seen. Mangia!

This is similar to my family's Marches area recipe - except without the raisins and pine nuts - and we drop the uncooked meatballs directly into the sauce. They come out tender and the sauce is full of meaty flavor. (Sometimes we combine veal and pork in the beef - for special occasions.)
