These are my go-to, non-chocolate chip, drop cookie. They are different and delicious. Soaking the raisins and toasting the walnuts make all the difference.

My first oven sheet was kinda' blah. So I added orange extract, orange flavored cranberries and cinnamon. Great "harvest time" cookie. I went directly to the Sun Maid Raisin plant in Kingsburg, CA, just south of Fresno, just last week, and bought 5 pounds of fresh golden thompson seedless raisns, which I used. I also stocked up on milk chocolate covered raisins (which will be in my next batch instead of the golden raisins), and chocolate covered Muscat raisins. Nothing beats the freshness, not even soaking. They are available on-line (fresh) from Sun Maid at their website gift store.

i made these because i had limited baking ingredients in the house, and they turned out well. it's basically a variation on the classic butter drop cookie (very close to the toll house recipe), loaded with raisins and nuts instead of chocolate. it is true that they don't spread much - they bake up nice and thick, with pleasantly chunky-looking tops. nothing to swoon over, but perfectly tasty just the same, and nice to have around as an everyday cookie.

An amazing cookie! I made this twice this week. Instead of walnuts, I used pecans. Also, if you use Trader Joe's jumbo raisin medley, there is no need to soak them--they are nice and plump, with a touch of tanginess. I will make these for Christmas, to give away. Absolutely delicious!!!

Delicious! These cookies are a hit. I made them today and they're wonderful. My husband loves them and so does my son, age 20, who always claimed he does not like nuts; he loves these. The raisin/walnut combination is yummy. Should you decide to make them, these cookies don't spread much while baking, so it's okay to place them close together on the cookie sheet. By the second batch, I placed them about 1-1/2 inches apart and it was perfect. Note: this recipe did not yield 8 dozen cookies. I made them just a little larger than what the recipe said and it only yielded about 3 dozen. They're not going to last though -- they're way too good!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I can't find my Mar '97 book and was going crazy because I thought I lost the recipt - surprise! It's on-line. ;-) I hate walnuts but love this (did I say that yet?). The crunchy-chewy-buttery YUM is a winner. Must try with the cantaloupe sorbet that was featured on the same page.

This is absolutely delicious. The texture of raisin and walnut compromises each other and make this cookie delightly cruncy and chewy. Although I have to admit that I used light margarine instead in attempt to cut down the calories. It still comes out just perfectly wonderful. Before the second batch is in the oven, the first batch was already finished!
