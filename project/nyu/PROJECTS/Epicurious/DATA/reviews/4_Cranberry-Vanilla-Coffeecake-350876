I made every possible mistake in mixing the ingredients, wrong times, wrong temps, mixed the sugar and cranberries together in the blender and the eggs with the butter and sugar all separated into a gooey slimey mess. However, it was actually a very simple recipe, really. I was just distracted or something. My point is, it still came out incredibly good even though it was baked in a loaf pan. So easy, even if you think you messed it up, it still turns out perfectly. Really.

This was a lot of work for just an OK outcome. It seemed a little dry. I would go for another recipe that doesn't take as much time and tastes better.

I have to admit that I have not tasted this cake myself, but I have made it twice. The reason I haven't tasted it is because both times it was gobbled up before I could get to it. (well, the first time around, there was one piece left but folks were fighting over it so I just let them duke it out). So I'm guessing it's good. The other thing I have to admit is that I thought it sounded kind of gross initially (cranberry vanilla??) but the recipe fit in perfectly with leftovers I had on hand - vanilla sugar I make out of the vanilla pod after I scrape the seeds into another recipe - I just throw the pods into a tupperware filled with sugar. I'm up to quite a few pods over the years and the sugar takes on a wonderful vanilla flavor. I just shake it up every once in awhile. The cranberries are usually what is left over from the holidays. Also, I overmixed the batter the second time around (it was 2a.m. and I got mesermized by the mixer) but folks still gobbled it up so I guess it didn't make it too tough. Anyway, real crowd pleaser.

I just cut into this cake and I really like it. I ran out of flour (no idea how that even happened!) and had to use 1/2 cup of oats to make up the difference. I also took someone's suggestion of throwing in a few white chocolate chips on top of the cranberry layer. It came out great and I will certainly make it again.

Since others have boldly admitted that they used extract I will come clean and say that I did, too. We liked this cake. It was a touch dry but only in comparison to the rich sour cream cake that's my usual. Even my daughter, who will not touch cranberry sauce, enjoyed the tart-sweet filling.

OMG who would pay 8 dollars for a vanilla bean, The gourmet stores are a rip, and the one bean in the bottles at the grocery stores are dried and flavorless. Get it on line and keep in a zip lock bag in the freezer. As for the cake itself, okay but a bit bland, it needed more background flavors.

I just took this out of the oven an hour ago. It is really very good. And really very sweet. I may have overground the sugar while mixing in the vanilla as it came out super-fine. Don't think that should have made a difference in the sweetness, but some people may want to cut down on the sugar, especially in the cranberry mix and topping. I added some cinnamon to the topping. Can't really taste it, but it doesn't hurt. Could also add nuts, maybe almonds or walnuts, I imagine. All in all, given the holiday nature I think I'll make it a regular, although I think I may mix-and-match cake batters to get a coarser crumb.

We liked this a lot! It was tender, moist, and not coyingly sweet. Be careful not to overmix the batter. I hand mixed the milk and flour into the batter to avoid this. Also, I used a springform pan instead of a cake pan (it came out looking like the photo), and spread 2/3 of the batter first, then cranberries, then final 1/3 batter. The berry layer baked almost perfectly in the center. Finally, I used a whole vanilla bean (go to Costco). The flecks were surely apparently in the cake, but not very fragrant. I'll add a bit of extract next time.

Terrible. I can't believe this recipe received so many four-fork ratings. I made this for Easter brunch and was embarrassed to serve it. I did anyway, because I spent $8 on the vanilla bean (an entire one, at others' suggestions). The coffeecake was dry, flavorless (!!! did I need two whole vanilla beans?!) Needless to say I'll never make this one again. Such a disappointment.

it was good and easy - i didn't have a vanilla pod, just used extract, so that might have hurt - but it was a little white bread for me. literally :) i'd like to try it again with some almond meal or white whole wheat flour subbed for some of the white flour...

Great use for the leftover cranberries from Thanksgiving. I think my husband looks forward to the Friday after just for this coffeecake.

I loved this recipe. I posted it on my blog, Lori's Lipsmacking Goodness. I think it is worth having the real vanilla bean.

I forgot the eggs! Loved it anyway. More like a coffee cookie bar.Didn't have vanilla bean so pulsed the sugar with 1 1/2 tsp reg vanilla-turned out great. Might try it with eggs tomorrow.

I didn't use vanilla bean but I used some pure vanilla bean paste that I got at our local health food store. It comes in a jar and you store it in your pantry for future use. It turned out so WONDERFUL. Great vanilla flavor! I followed the other reviewers advice and placed 2/3 of the mixture in the pan and then layered the cranberry mixture and spooned the rest of the batter over the top and gently spread to cover evenly. I froze my cranberries and placed them in the food processor with the vanilla/sugar and pulsed them until they were chopped. This worked great. Do try this as it was so fabulous!! It wasn't dry but very moist and the cranberry flavor was perfect, not too overpowering. ENJOY!

I loved this recipe...I love anything with cranberry. I made it for my parents on Christmas morning last year. Very moist and delicious. I also candied some cranberries down on top of it which added a very pretty topping and a little extra tartness.

Delicious!I,like other reviewers, used a whole vanilla bean. Also, I ended up putting about 3/4 of the batter into the pan, then the cranberry mixture, then the remaining batter. The berries sunk, but ended up perfectly in the middle at the end of baking. The smell while baking was incredible, and my roommates devoured the finished product. I'm definitely adding this to the gift baskets I send out every Christmas!

Pretty good recipe. I used fresh blueberries as cranberries were not in season and the frozen were very expensive. It was ok, blueberries in the food processor gave off alot of juice, so I had to strain some off so as not to have soggy cake. Batter is very thick and hard to spread as neatly as instructed, but it still came out beautifully. I highly suggest using the vanilla beans, it makes all the difference.

I just made this for Mother's Day and it turned out great! I couldn't find any cranberries in May so I used frozen blueberries instead and it tasted fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly and took care not to over mix the batter. I made it in a 9" spring form pan without any parchment. I had no trouble getting the coffeecake out. The filling did sink into the batter while cooking but it still looked beautiful and tasted great. I will definitely make this again.

Ditto to what everyone else said. I would add that in the future I would use 2/3 of the batter for the bottom layer as the cranberries "settle" into the cake. When I cut into my cake the berry mixture was almost to the bottom of the cake. Still delicious but visually needed work.

I never feel compelled to write reviews but this coffee cake was so exceptional I decided to add my experience. I don't love coffee cake but this one could convert me. I used the 'innards" of an entire Oregon fresh thick vanilla bean; I am sure that made a difference and contrary to the recipe instructions, we ate the cake a bit warm. It was melt in your mouth good for a memorable brunch with the egg custard from the same issue. Happy Brunch!

I made this cake for a brunch. Everyone thought it was really good. It had that wonderful vanilla flavor that I love, then you get hit with a burst of tangy cranberry. Delicious! I do not have a food processor so I used a blender to make the vanilla sugar and to chop the cranberries. It worked just fine. The cranberry filling was a bit thick for spreading. I used my spoon to make small mounds on the cake and used a rubber spatula to spread it as best I could. To be honest, it looked exactly like the photo when I cut into it. Yum!

I was cheap and used vanilla extract. (I know, I know!) This was a huge hit at work. Two of my coworkers asked to take any leftovers home, but there weren't any. Just tart enough, beautiful presentation, and perfectly moist.

Served this with brunch and it was a big hit! The store I went to did not have frozen cranberries, and I got the last container of fresh ones - maybe they're seasonal? (it's Feb) Although I used a whole vanilla bean as others did, I expected a stronger vanilla flavor.

This was not exceptional, but still pretty good overall. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a handful of chocolate chips based some other reviews. I didn't like the chocolate addition. The vanilla taste did come thru, and the cranberries provided nice tart contrast and pretty color (rose to the level of the 2" pan and looked just like the photo). However, the crumb texture is slightly dry toward the outer rim, but almost underdone in the center after 45 minutes, and the taste is just vanilla (literally & figuratively). Could be that I just like my coffeecake w/ cinnamon & brown sugar. .

I made this and took it to work and everyone said it was the best coffee cake they had ever had. I used a whole vanilla bean(how many recipes do you have that only uses 1/2 of a vanilla bean?) I had soaked my bean in milk as it had become too hard and the vanilla bean-flavored milk was perfect. I am not a big cranberry fan, so I used 1 cup and sprinked chocolate chips as someone else suggested and it came out great. I just used a knife to spread the thick batter onto the cranberry mixture and it worked out well.

A suggestion for more affordable vanilla beans.... Costco sold a package of two glass vials, each containing 5 beans, for about $10-15.

Followed the recipe exactly (a rarity for me), but the batter was so thick that the top layer pulled the filling along when I tried to spread it, and 45 minutes left the cake too dry/overdone. That said, the filling was delicious and I may try again but baking 35-40 minutes.

I also found the batter hard to spread in the pan but it seems to sort itself out in the oven - great reviews at the brunch I served it at. Might consider using a wee bit less sugar with the cranberry filling...

I made this as a part of a Christmas brunch and I was pretty happy with it. It looked just like the picture; pretty for the holiday. My only complaint is the cost of the vanilla bean...$15 for a jar of two! Yikes! This coffee cake tasted good two days later. It was still very moist.

Delicious, even better than expected! Everyone loved this Christmas morning. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems. The cranberries made a pretty red ribbon through the middle, and came out nicely sweet, rather than tart. Using a real vanilla bean is important in this recipe, as it is a major component of the flavor. I will absolutely make this again.

Doubled the vanilla (used a whole bean) and it was delicious. Also, couldn't find cranberries at the store (was picked over on Xmas Eve) so I just used frozen cherries and then strained out the excess liquid after processing.

This coffeecake is quite good. The filling is special and the vanilla sugar makes a difference. However, you have to avoid over mixing the cake batter or it becomes dry & tough. I just folded it over a couple of times my second time making it and that made a difference.

don't forget to have a bigger bottom layer than top layer, as cranberries will sink a bit. this was excellent! Much like the nytimes crumb cake, but in different proportions.

I agree that the batter was sticky and hard to work with. I had to spread the top layer, causing me to push the cranberries in the center down. Thus I did not have a pretty layer of cranberries but a smattering of cranberries throughout the cake. I did not have a vanilla bean unfortunately, so I added 2 tsp. of vanilla to the batter. I am sure it would have been even better if the vanilla could have been in the cranberries and in the crumble topping. I used 2/3 cup white sugar in the batter and a little less than 1/4 cup of sugar for the cranberries. Next time I would stick to the recipe as it. The cake tasted like butter because of the lack of sugar. It was delicious, however, with a wonderful texture that improved as it sat. I served it with orange sherbet, and it disappeared at a potluck.

Coffee cake was tasty. Not too sweet, which is perfect for me. The cranberry mixture offered a great tang. Found the batter a bit difficult to work with--very sticky and hard to spread. Looks great when you cut into it---the red ribbon from the cranberry mixture adds a colorful touch.

I made this the other night and it came out perfect! It was absolutely delicious, and it helped me get rid of the extra cranberries from thanks giving.

Great recipe. Delicious, and not that hard to put together. Don't be tempted to use bottled vanilla or worse imitation vanilla. The vanilla beans have so much flavor without the added suspension found in vanilla extract. A great cake to serve for family or guests at this holiday season.

This is a delicious -- and lovely -- coffee cake. My husband loves chocolate, so I reduced the cranberries to 1 and 1/4 cups and added 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate. The sweet-tart combination was heavenly. Thanks for a great recipe.
