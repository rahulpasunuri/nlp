Delicious! I substituted Kahlua for the whiskey as it was for a church gathering with younger people. One of the 10 year-old boys told his mom: "I want to go home and eat food and bundt cake. Bundt cake is not food. Bundt cake is magic." I completely agree!

I made this for my mom last week and she LOVED it! Now, my mom is extremely anti alcohol, and she still loved it. The whiskey compliments the chocolate so well she couldn't tell it was in there, I think the coffee helped cover it and compliments it as well. Over all this is a very good cake and I WILL be making it again very soon!

Made this yesterday using Jack Daniels bourbon and also made sure the coffee was good and strong. Excellent. Wonderful chocolate flavor.

Rating: 4
Definitely need to make sure the coffee is brewed strong. I couldn't taste it at all. Overall I'm very happy with the cake. It turned out wonderfully, and the flavor is great. I made a whiskey sauce to top mine, which made it even better. I will certainly be making this again.

Made an excellent lower fat version. This dessert takes tradtional chocolate cake in a new direction. Foodie friends even asked to take some home. Reduced calories by substituting 1 1/2 c. of applesauce for 1 cup of the sugar. Also subsittued kahlua for whiskey and used wheat flour instead of white.Extremely moist, tasty and no one knew it was healthier and lower in fat. Lesss guilt if you go for seconds; give it a try.

Rating: 4
This came out great! Moist but not overly rich, it held together well (not crumbly). Next time I will brew the coffee stronger so the taste stands out a little more. The whiskey was barely discernable...I may try it with Kahlua or Amaretto some time.

Fantastic! I only had a 9x13 baking dish so I made a dozen cupcakes with the extra batter. I poked and drizzled a mixture of whisky, sugar, butter, and cinnamon. Repeatedly. Left overnight. Warmed and served with optional lightly sweetened whipped cream. One of the best desserts ever! I must say, the cupcakes were the bigger hit, little mouthfuls of moist perfection.

I call this my "Cry-me-a-river" cake. I make it for anyone who wants to indulge in a pity party since it has all the best vices: chocolate, coffee, and liquor. So easy, a real crowd pleaser. Sometimes I serve it with a chocolate ganache glaze, sometimes just powdered sugar. It would keep forever in an air-tight container, if only I could keep my families grubby hands off it!

I made this cake just as written and it was fantastic. Next time I might do some sort of whiskey glaze over the top, but other than that, it's perfect. Really easy to put together, very moist and chocolatey, a good grownup cake. It took about 50 minutes in the oven for me.

I have been making this cake for years as a gift during the holidays. I have found to avoid the flour lumps I add about half of the liquids to the flour mixture first and mix until smooth with a hand mixer. I then add the rest of liquids and blend. I bake it in 3 - 3.5 x 7.5 loaf pans for about 40-45 min.

This cake was delightful... simple to make and scrumptious results. Super Moist & Flavorful! I made some whipped cream and added a wee bit of Bourbon to it! YUM! :) Bon Appetit!!

Rating: 4
Delicious! I had to bake it for an hour before a toothpick came out clean. It came out moist and light and the combination of chocolate, whiskey and coffee flavors was scrumptious. The flavor improves upon standing a day, so you might want to bake it a day ahead of time and hide it (otherwise you risk having it disappear).

Great cake - big hit at my Kentucky Derby party. Unfortunately no leftovers...Used Maker's Mark and Ghirardelli cocoa, and sifted together flour, baking soda, and salt before adding. Topped warm cake with bourbon glaze from Molasses Pecan Bundt cake (also on epicurious website), and served with vanilla ice cream and warmed leftover bourbon glaze. Delicious!

the most beautiful bundt cake i have ever had!!! i replaced the whiskey with rum and increased it to 3/4 cup ;) also topped with a ganache made with 3/4 c rum and 1 c chocolate chips.. quick and easy!! beautiful way to serve too. this will definatly be one of my regulars. enjoy!

Phenomenal. I made the batter with one bowl (microwaved butter, whiskey, coffee and cocoa until butter was melted, then followed the recipe as written) and it took all of 10 minutes to prepare. Perfect, dense texture and not-too-sweet, deep, chocolate flavor. This was actually fantastic with the pear sauce from Pears with Pear Sauce, also on this site.

Rating: 1
This cake had a very nice texture and gorgeous, almost black color, but that's all it had going for it. It doesn't taste like much of anything. Almost no chocolate flavor at all--you know how some cakes don't taste like chocolate, they just taste "brown?" I was surprised by how little flavor this cake had--just a vague brown-whisky-ish flavor. Not even a last-minute bittersweet chocolate ganache glaze could fix this one.

Rating: 4
I baked this for a party--I made it 2 days in advance and it was a big hit! Overall it's a very easy cake to make. I agree with the reviewers who say to use an electric or stand mixer--it's impossible to blend in the flour thoroughly with just a whisk. I made it with Makers Mark bourbon and I added more bourbon than the recipe called for--it came out great and I bet the recipe would be really good with rum or other liquors.

Rating: 0
GREAT recipe. One word of caution: Use an electric or stand mixer, cause there's NO way you'll be able to get out the lumps in the batter by hand. It was still a great recipe though, and one I intend to make again. I did use Captain Morgan's in stead of whiskey, and water instead of coffee. I think next time I'll add a little more rum, and maybe switch out some of the water for vinegar to make it even more moist and wonderful.

Rating: 4
This was a great quick/simple/easy recipe. I decided late last night to do a cake and this recipe stood out with many great reviews. My entire staff loved it and 2 asked for the recipe. I loved the texture, more dense than many, not too sweet and moist without being too moist. No need for any icing, great just like it is. We had it over coffee at our breakfast meeting. It was a hit!

Rating: 4
Wow! I made this cake for a party and it was the hit of night. I doubled the whiskey and let it sit for a day, so it was very moist. It was a hit with the adults - chocolatey, moist, and unique. As the host later told me, "That cake made the party, a party."

Rating: 4
I like making bundt cakes because I don't have to bother with fancy icings which I usually botch up when applying. I tried this recipe the other day, and my family really enjoyed it. It has both a smokey and a chocolaty flavor. Perhaps the smokey flavor came from the Jack Daniels whiskey that I used. This one is a keeper!

Made exactly as written, using Jameson whiskey. A coal black cake. Used the cathederal bundt pan (lots of indentations) and had no problem releasing from pan. Everyone loved it. Will play around with the liquour. However, I loved the mocha rum cake on this sight. Similar ingredients, but better. Do try it after doing this one and tell me what you think.

Rating: 4
I have made this bundt cake more than 20 times. It is perfect for adult gatherings. I have NEVER had leftovers, people beg for seconds! I use Crown Royal and often times substitute freshly brewed espresso for the coffee. For better flavor I always use good quality organic cocoa powder. Also, cut the espresso down to 1&1/4 cup and increase the whiskey to 3/4 cup. It's best if you can manage to make it a couple of days before you plan to serve it; the flavor definitely improves. No need for icing, et cetera but I sometimes add a side of fresh whipped cream and garnish with a sprig of mint.

Really heavenly! I used 3/4 cup canadian mist plus a splash of Cointreau, adjusted the coffee accordingly. The aroma is inviting and the taste is your reward.

One of the best recipes I've made on this site! The cake is incredibly rich and moist. However, I would probably increase the whiskey and decrease the coffee next time to get a stronger whiskey flavor. I bet this would be good with all sorts of different liquor.

This makes a big cake--but it all disappears. I cut the sugar a bit, and I've used brandy instead of whiskey in a pinch. All good.

I did not rate this recipe as I hadn't followed it as written. Other reviewers had recommended using different liquors, so I did a pre-bake trial of the cocoa-coffee mix with whiskey and Grand Marnier, respectively. Needless to say, I preferred the latter, and the cake baked up beautifully. The only problems I had was mixing the lumpy flour (I had to use my whisk to "pop" open the bubbly clumps); and the top part of the cake stuck to the pan even though I thought I had greased it pretty well. Regardless, it was rich, dark, and delicious, and I finished it with a semisweet chocolate glaze to make it that more indulgent!

Rating: 4
Yum! This time I used Kahlua (also added a bit to the whipping cream.) Next time I'll try Chambord or maybe Grand Marnier. So many complimentary liquors with chocolate!

Wonderful... I used Grand Marnier instead of whiskey as I am not a fan. The flavor is to die for. The cake is so moist and the smell is irresitable. Fantasic recipe.

Very enjoyable cake. Moist through and through. I added Mint sprigs and strawberries for garnish with the whipped cream. Next time I will add flavor to the whipped cream, maybe mint? Rum would be nice too...

I made a vegan version of this cake (subbed 3/4 cup silken tofu blended with 1 Tbsp soy milk for the eggs and Earth Balance Buttery Spread for the butter) and it was amazing! Left out the salt since the Earth Balance is salted. My only complaint was that the whiskey flavor wasn't quite strong enough for my tastes. I think next time I'll replace some of the coffee with extra whiskey. Might also sub some of the butter with vegan sour cream.

This cake was wonderful! I needed a last minute treat for a work function so I decided to try this. Being from Kentucky, I used Woodford Reserve Bourbon. There were several comments on how smooth the flavor was. Also added chocolate chips! I will be making this again.

I can't imagine anyone thinking this cake was dry...it has TWO STICKS of butter in it. It's incredibly rich and moist. I made it almost exactly as directed, but used rum instead of whiskey and my coffee is actually coffee-and-chicory (darker and richer than regular coffee). I baked it in a silcone bundt pan for 50 minutes and it was perfectly cooked. I totally recommend this fab cake--it received rave reviews from everyone who sampled it.

I enjoyed the cake, but I felt like it could have used something like sour cream to give it a little more richness without drying it out too much. Any cake where I get to pour a hefty dousing from the bottle is a fun dessert to make. Am I that easy?

I followed the recipe exactly but did use a few tablespoons of extra-dark cocoa to get a deep, dark color; the rest of the cocoa was regular Hershey's. I didn't find the whiskey overpowering; it was a distinctive and delicious flavor. Homemade whipped cream was a perfect accompaniment.

Very good, very moist, very tastey. The only problem I had was not blending the flour mixture and wet mixture enough. I had white clumps of flour in a couple of places - I didn't want to over mix (even though I sifted all the dry ingredients). Next time, I'll just have to bite the bullet and mix longer.

Rating: 3
Rich, moist, dense cake. I'm not sure how it could come out dry unless you seriously (I mean seriously) overcooked it. Used Makers Mark. Served with whip cream - yum! I only made it 1 day ahead, I think 2 days would have been better; there were no leftovers to test that theory, though. As for previous reviewers not wanting to make it with whiskey and using bourbon as an alternative, I hate to break it to them, but bourbon is whiskey made in Bourbon County, KY. Next time I may try a cognac/whiskey combo as others suggested.

Although it's true that this was easy, I didn't care for the end result. The cake was a little dry. If I were to make it again, I would only bake it 40 minutes. Another reviewer mentioned flour lumps which is almost nevitable if you dump the flour into the liquids. A better way is to gradually whisk the flour into the liquids. I also think the addition of chocolate chips mentioned by others would greatly improve the it.

One suggestion: sift dry ingredients. As I only whisked until the dry came together with the wet ingredients, the batter was a bit lumpy. The recipe mentions "bubbles" which I thought were my lumps, but they were not. I should have either stirred longer or sifted.

I have made this cake many times and have had alot of friends ask for the recipe. It is delicious! The whiskey, coffee, and chocolate really work well together.

I made this moist and flavorful cake for a Super Bowl party and have had requests for it 3 times in the two months since....I've made it with Jack Daniels and also with Famous Grouse and with Jameson's. I sprinkle powdered sugar over the top, garnished it with ripe strawberries and mint leaves, and served it with whipped cream. Huge success! This cake is wonderful each and every time--very simple to make, a beautiful presentation, and tastes like you slaved over it. Definitely bake it a day ahead of serving if possible because the flavor intensifies overnight. I can't recommend this one enough.

Very good cake. I made it several times. I prefer it with cognac though, but whiskey works fine. One thing I notice is that the cake looks wonderful when you take it out BEFORE it cools, if you wait 2 hrs as recipe suggests a fine layer of cocoa can stick to the mold instead of ending up on the cake giving it a wonderful even surface.

Solid recipie. Insted of the whiskey and coffee I used 1/2 cup cointreau and 1 1/2 water and backed off the sugar a little. Next time I'll use equal amounts cointreau and water, not strong enough. I also topped with ganche insted.

This cake was supremely moist. Everyone who has eaten has absolutely loved it. It is decadently rich, and very, very easy to make. Whipped cream makes it positively sinful. I have also made it with cognac, but liked the bourbon better. The whiskey flavor is very pronounced, so it really does need to be a good quality.

Rating: 3
I made this recipe with only one change (added 2 T. of oil), and it was delicious - moist, rich, and flavorful. My only suggestion to other bakers who aren't fans of whiskey - you may want to reduce the amount called for in the recipe to 1/3 C., and substitute in more coffee. I hate the taste of whiskey but made the cake anyway because the recipe said that most of the alcohol would burn off. It didn't. And even though the cake was delicious, I think an even more subtle alcohol flavor would be better for us teetotalers.

Rating: 4
WOW this is good. DO NOT OVERBAKE. I did 40 minutes at 325. Made exactly as recipe calls with Hershey Cocoa Powder. No, need to frost, but it does benefit from some whipped cream. Serve 1" slices and be prepared for raves - chocolate rich deliciousness. Making again for a St. Pattys Party

Very good cake, the whiskey is a really nice touch. I baked it for 44 minutes, but it could have gone a few minutes more. I used a 12 cup Bundt pan, 10 cup would have been sufficient. It's not too sweet, would make a great dessert for a dinner party with coffee and brandy.

Good standard cake that has the texture of a cake made with oil (must be the melted better). Made with Jameson Irish Whiskey and found that taste very good.

The trick with this cake is to let it sit for a few days wrapped in plastic wrap in the fridge. I used Jack Daniels whiskey and Ghirardelli cocoa. It was served plain with no whipped cream, and it was better and better each night that we ate it. Was very easy to make. Again, let it sit for a while and you will taste the liquor. I would have baked mine a short while longer as it had a slightly gooey texture.

Really easy to make cake. Doesn't taste like whiskey - just gives it a nice flavor. I added some chopped dried cherries which was nice for a burst of flavor. Great with whip cream. Light texture is nice for a bundt. One issue - something missing from pulling you in "for just another bite" - could be because the cake is cocoa its a bit flat. Maybe put in chocolate chunks? But nice and easy to make

This cake is phenomenal. The taste of whiskey remains, which is a good thing. I prefer baking them in mini-bundt pans, and drizzle an icing made of bittersweet chocolate, a little icing sugar and whiskey on top of it and let it set.
