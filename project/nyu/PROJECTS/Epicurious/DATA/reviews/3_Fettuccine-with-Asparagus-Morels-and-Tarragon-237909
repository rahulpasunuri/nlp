We loved this recipe. I altered it a bit based on previous reviews. First, I reduced the cream and infused some of the tarragon in it. Then, I sauteed the asparagus with the morels and the shallots. Then, added 3/4 cup strained reserved morel liquid plus 1/4 cup chicken broth and let it reduce without the lid and then added the cream with the rest of the tarragon. Seasoned to taste and YUM! Added parmesan, of course. The sauce will not be "thick" which is a good thing. It makes a nice light sauce. The reason I gave it 3/4 forks is because the asparagus came out a bit more cooked and discolored than I would have liked, but I will play with this recipe and definitely make it again and again and again.

I have to agree with the review that lists this as bland. I'll never waste morels on this recipe again. The pasta was good, the asparagus I cooked separately (I hate mushy asparagus!), and the tarragon was a nice touch, however the finished dish was truly mediocre.

This was great - the tarragon is perfect with asparagus and mushrooms (I used shiitakes because that's what I had.) I hardly ever have cream on hand so I used skim(!) milk. It works fine and tastes better than evaporated milk. I used about 1 2/3 cups of milk, for stronger flavor and only about 1/2 cup mushroom soaking liquid. Cook about 2 TB flour at the end with the shallots (maybe add some more butter to make it richer) and the sauce thickens up nicely.

This was an easy, light, tasty and filling spring dish. I did substitute evaporated skim milk for the cream, and thus used less broth. I found that the cooking time was also too short - I wound up cooking the sauce (with asparagus, morels and shallots in it) for about 10 minutes total, and it was perfect. The sauce was wonderfully creamy (I added cornstarch), the vegetables were tender but firm, and the flavor was delightful.

The cream overpowers the morels and everything ends up too bland.

It also took my sauce longer than 4 minutes to set. I added the asparagus a bit later than the recipe called for in keeping with reviews. I used dried morels and reserved broth (1 1/4) and no vegetable broth. It needed a generous amount of salt but I will make again and thought the flavors came together nicely!

A good "light" pasta that features tasty spring vegetables. While cream is high in fat, the sauce is fairly light tasting so as not to overpower the expensive and tasty morels. I had to use marjoram, due to an inexplicable absence of tarragon from the local markets. Still tasted great. It's not a memorable, amazing recipe, but it's tasty and a good use of the fresh seasonal ingredients.

Epi must have had a problem inputting this recipe. The magazine says to use "8 ounces fresh morel mushrooms, halved if large, or 1 ounce dried morels". Nice guess, Jesse from Savannah.

The flavor to this dish was great, but I am only giving it one fork because the recipe is poorly written. Obviously, it is missing morels in the ingredients list. I guessed and used 1 oz. of reconstituted dried mushrooms - it was just the right amount - add that to the ingredients list. The other thing that I didn't think about was that cream doesn't thicken in "about 4 minutes." I thought about this only after I had the asparagus in the cream sauce - I added a pinch of cornstarch in hopes of thickening the sauce, but it was too late - if I left the asparagus in long enough to thicken, it would have been overcooked. I will make this recipe again because the flavors of mushrooms, asparagus, and tarragon are terrific. However, I will cook the asparagus separately so that it doesn't run the risk of it getting overcooked and add it to the sauce after it has cooked long enough to thicken. I would probably also add just a little flour or cornstarch to the sauce to make it thicken faster.

Am I missing something? I can't find how much morels to use. How much fresh? How much dried?

I have no idea why this is listed in the healthy section? Especially with 41.5% fat. What's up Epicurious. I will definately try it though - sounds yum!
