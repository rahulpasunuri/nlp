Good and pretty easy! I cooked it in a cast iron braiser and used especially thick scallions and sweet vermouth. Served with rice.

really really good, a quick fav for the whole family. Onions are charred and delicious. I use a whole cut up chicken and everyone gets what they want. I tend to cook for about 28 minutes to get it perfect.

yum! i just made this tonite, and i can't wait to make it for friends. it's got a real sophisticated twist on diner-style roast chicken. i made orzo with a little garlic olive oil and grated 3-cheese blend mixed in. the scallions are supposed to be charred and carmelized, they were great! i used a six-pack of chicken thighs and they were just wonderful. it smelled good the first 5 minutes in the oven!

I removed the skin from the drumsticks as per a previous reviewers suggestion. Used more olive oil also. Now, the execution; I might be thick but I didn't get that I had to either lower the temperature or the pan in the over. My onions were charred. Oh well. I added double the wine if not more for half the amount of chicken. I also added a bit of corn flour to thicken it because otherwise it would just be warm wine. Good in principle but I don't know if I'll waste wine on this again.

Not having scallions, I cut up shallots, and parsnips, along with whole garlic cloves and added them to the roasting pan. It was cooked in 30 minutes but the chicken skin was totally flabby and unappetizing. So I pulled it off and added a little soy-garlic prepared sauce to "brown" up the chicken pieces. It all tasted very good.

I used boneless, skinless thighs, otherwise made it exactly. So easy and delicious. A keeper.

This recipe was SO easy and it was fantastic! My husband --who generally doesn't even like chicken- - couldn't stop raving about it. My kids loved it too. (And so did I.)
