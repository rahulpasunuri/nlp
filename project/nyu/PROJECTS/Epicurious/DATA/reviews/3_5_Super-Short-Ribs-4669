I really thought we would enjoy this recipe, but it was definitely too sweet for us. I think I'm used to a more savory red wine based short rib, but was opting for the easy way out with this quick recipe. It was easy and the ribs were very tender.

We found these to be okay. Followed the recipe except used bonless short ribs and found them to have very mild flavor.

I would say this recipe is pretty good, but not the best short rib recipe. I followed the ingredients exactly, but I did cook longer than the recipe so the ribs would be more tender, and removed alot of the fat off the top, as many people have suggested. My only complaint was the sauce, although it smelled great, was actually not as flavorful as I expected. It is interesting and promising, just not as tasty sauce as I'd like. Maybe somewhere along the way something watered it down...

I was looking forward to this due too all the 4 fork ratings but I was doubtful with the addition of the canned pineapple. It was terrible. It tasted like a bad 35 year old can Kung King product. We had to throw it all out. What a waste of time and ingredients.

The flavors in this recipe, while not particularly elegant or subtle, make for pleasant enough comfort food. However, I feel that there are some significant errors and omissions in the recipe, and correcting them results in a far better finished product. First of all, 2 hours at 350° is not going to give you great texture. I braise short ribs at 275° for 3.5 to 4 hours, and they always end up falling-off-the-bone, cut-with-a-spoon tender. Second, braised short ribs benefit tremendously from being cooked the day before they're going to be eaten. Serving them right after they're braised is just a waste. Third, the braising liquid needs to be reduced and defatted. To reduce the sauce, remove the short ribs after braising and boil the liquid over moderate heat until it reaches the desired consistency (keeping in mind that it will be further reduced when the excess fat is removed). Refrigerating the dish overnight makes the defatting easy, because the congealed fat can be scraped right off the top after it has cooled. If you're not going to refrigerate, at least skim as much of the fat as possible off the surface of the liquid with a shallow spoon before serving. Finally, I'll just reiterate what others have said: "bottled chili sauce" means the stuff that you find in the ketchup aisle, made by Heinz and others; it's basically a more flavorful version of ketchup. It doesn't refer to hot pepper sauce, Sriracha, Chinese chili paste, Thai sweet chili sauce, etc.. You can use any of those, of course (in adjusted quantity, I would hope), but those of you doing so are ending up with a dish that's very different from what the recipe author intended.

After reading many reviews I decided to make these. I was very disappointed. I like spicey food but the chili sauce is sooo hot that it totally overpowered anything else you put in the sauce. It left the ribs bland. I would waste your time.

I have made this both with + without bones. Bone-in is much too greasy and I'm a dude. Too "pot-roasty". I prefer the boneless by a long-shot. Yes, Costco; yes, you will have leftovers if you stick with the 4 1/4 pounds; yes, you will be glad you have leftovers! Mashed potatoes are a no-brainer. Cheers!

It's very good, although maybe a tad too rich and powerful - don't make it if you want something subtle, that's for sure. I made it with a potato risotto (from Michel Richard's book) and that worked well.

Super indeed...made with mostly boneless but a couple of boned short ribs tossed in, used 1/3 of a fresh pineapple that i crushed up, less honey because i used trader joe's sweet chili sauce, and homemade chicken stock instead of beef...my company raved about it.

freakishly fabulous. I've make this 3 or 4 times. I use the asian garlic chili sauce - with the wide green screw top lid. It's hot and sweet and delicious! Definitely over mashed potatoes and when those run out I spread the mashed meat and sauce on toasted baguette. yum!

This has been a standard now for several years and in fact, is the request for our Christmas Eve meal. I double the recipe, lighten up a bit on the pineapple and honey (use about 3/4 suggested amounts) and have added the rosemary sprigs as one reviewer suggested. I cook down the sauce a little after taking the ribs out - and then puree the whole shebang (minus the rosemary). I always make it a day ahead and reheat. It's a killer dish.

Astoundingly delicious for as easy as it is to put together. Crushed pineapple in juice works very well.

Fabulous! Used 3.5 lbs of boneless short ribs, seasoned with salt and pepper and then dredged in flour before browning. I only had crushed pineapple in juice, and that worked perfectly. No need for the added sweetness of syrup. I removed the ribs to a serving dish and covered, and then strained the pan sauce into a 4 cup gravy seperater to remove most of the fat. Served with mashed potatoes and simple salad with balsamic vinaigrette. This is my family's new favorite "comfort food". Outstanding!

There were super. Used boneless flanken ribs and did flour prior to browning, thanks to previous reviewers suggestions. Also used crushed pineapple as that's what I had on hand. Cooked longer to reduce sauce. Served with mashed potatoes for rave reviews. Did not find it too sweet - wouldn't change anything else - a keeper!

I made this exactly by the recipe, but used boneless ribs. Could not find pineapple with syrup so got it with juice. (Syrup would be sweeter, right?) It was still a bit too sweet for my taste, but very good and quite easy to make. No exotic ingredients to find! Should I leave out pineapple altogether? Texture of meat was wonderful. I did have to cook longer than 2 hours. Served with gorgonzola mashed potatoes. Will definitely make again but need to reduce sweetness somehow.

Easy to make, meltingly tender, and lots of delicious sauce (I doubled that part of the recipe). I used boneless short ribs from Costco, which were outstanding, and got 12 healthy servings from that amount of meat. My husband and our discerning guest pronounced this a winner, and I will surely make this again. By the way, we paired this with a luscious Zinfandel, and that really complemented the dish nicely.

The bottled chili sauce is either "Heinz" or "Homemade" brands. They are found alongside the catsup and a little chunkier than catsup.

I must have done something wrong here... I used the Costco shortribs and the crushed pineapple, doubled the sauce. Perhaps it was my interpretation of "bottled chili sauce." I used Sriracha and only put in half of what the recipe calls for. It was still borderline too spicy. The flavors didnt blend exceptionally well for me....

I followed the advice of others and made this recipe w/boneless ribs from Costco -DELICIOUS! Our dinner guests kept saying "this is better than ANY restaurant!" I served it with basmati rice, which has dehydrated veggies in it (also from Costco) - it was really lovely. First course was Coconut Lobster Bisque (a restaurant recipe) and for dessert, Apple Blossoms (a frozen dessert - sshh, don't tell!) This is a TEN fork dish, if you ask me!

This is a "wowser" recipe, sure to please the most finicky of palates. Tip to get gravy consistency sauce instead of water consistency: dust your ribs in floor prior to browning them. This dish goes well with the large dumpling size noodles as well.

Great recipe. I made it the night before so the flavors were well set in however I tasted it the night I prepared and the flavor was yummy then. It does help to skim all the fat before reheating.

I tried this dish as written a few years ago as part of a Halloween buffet. Everyone wolfed it down, including the kids! This time, for some reason, as I was cooking it, it seemed to be missing something. Since I'd purposely made it a day ahead of time and doubled the sauce, I ended up tinkering with it. I removed the meat added a few stalks of celery, a chopped carrot and a sprig of rosemary to the sauce before reducing it over a low flame for about 40 minutes. When the sauce cooled, I pureed it (less the stem of rosemary). I reheated everything the next day on the stove top and this time it received RAVE reviews and requests for the recipe. Oh, and I always use the boneless shortribs. Much less fat that way.

Rating: 4
Love this dish! I made it a few months ago as written, and this week I made it with brisket rather than short ribs. Fantastic! Brisket needs to cook for about 3 hours, so the only thing I will do in the future is double the sauce because it did cook down a bit due to the extra cooking time.

You should try this recipe just for the way your kitchen smells while it is cooking! Everyone in my family (picky 3 year old included) cleaned their plates. It was amazing and I'm sure it will be even better tomorrow. Yes, yes, the mashed potatoes are a must - great for holding that yummy sauce. I doubled the sauce and pretty much followed the recipe. Will make this again and again.

Outstanding! This dish received so much praise from my guests, it was almost embarrassing. :) I served the ribs on Creamy Polenta with Parmesan (103519) and it was perfect. Mashed potatoes would work as well, but it would be a much heavier dish. I followed others' suggestions of using crushed pineapple, boneless ribs from Costco and used Asian Chili Garlic sauce which balanced the sweet ingredients beautifully -- subtle sweetness with just the right amount of heat. I also prepared the ribs early in the day and reheated before serving. This is absolutely wonderful and will become a house staple. I agree with other reviews -- if you didn't thoroughly enjoy this recipe, you did something seriously wrong. Give it another try, you won't be sorry.

I don't have a sweet-tooth but my wife does. I didn't think I'd care for this but expected her to love it. I made it with boneless short ribs, double sauce, and substituted crushed pineapple in juice and pearl onions. Here's my suggestions. Make it the night before. The flavors really refine and there was about 3/4 cup of fat that needed to come off the top. Double the sauce to have enough braising liquid. Having enough sauce to eat was not an issue for us, we could only use a little because it's very sweet(even for my wife) and the pineapple really upstages everything else in there. I would not use pearl onions again, they are too sweet for this. Next time I also plan to go with large chunk pineapple or even rings and withhold some of the juice. I thought the pineapple was too dominant. I'd increase the chili sauce too. You'll also want to thicken this sauce with some cornstarch prior to serving, it's not thick at all. The cook time of 2 hours is too optimistic to get your ribs tender. The meat itself was excellent. I served with garlic mashed potatoes and they complemented perfectly. I look forward to making this again with the tweaks I mentioned.

Prepared exactly as directed. Delicious sauce - I concur with previous reviewers and will next time use boneless ribs to cut out unnecessary fat and use crushed pineapple in juice (not syrup). Next time I'll serve over rice, rather than potatoes.

Well, since I had some leftover french onion soup (Bon Appetit 1991)I used that instead of the broth. The caramelized onion was wonderful. I also had only the Korean style cut of ribs, but everything else I followed - I even added the chopped onion even though I thought it might be redundant - not so!! We loved this recipe!!!

Although I was looking for a simmered red wine-type dish for short ribs, I had to make this recipe based on Jason from NC's faboo comments. I LOL'd and found a can of pineapple. I don't keep chili sauce on hand so I used a bit of barbecue sauce and left out the honey. I served it with some rice pilaf that I had on hand, though the sauce probably would be better with just plain white rice. Very easy to do on a weeknight, since there is little active time at the stove. More a beer meal than a wine meal. I would make it again. Thanks, Jason!

Made this dish last night and had the table practically licking their plates!The meat came out tender and slid off the bone. Plus, it was really an easy dish to make and I cut the oven time down to 1.5 hours instead of 2. I also substituted a can of mandarin oranges for pineapple, which came out terrific and I think orange tends to compliment beef in a more tasy way. Also used chile powder instead of sauce, but this is one of those dishes where you can be pretty versatile with the ingredients and the meat will still turn out savory. This dish definitely goes to the top of my 'hot date' list.

I have been making this recipe again & again. the recipe is easy to follow. My husband does not like fruit and meat dishes, so I used crushed pineapple instead ( it blends into the sauce well & my husband doesn't realize he's eating pineapple with his shortribs).

An excellent dish. If you didn't like it, you fucked up somewhere. No. Silence. Your fault, not the recipe's. Just hang your head in shame, try making it again, and apologize when you have done so. Try it with garlic mashed potatoes and copious quantities of ale or lager, or red wine. Other side dishes will not be necessary. They would merely be a distraction.

Holy Cow!!! (No pun intended.) I made this as written and my family was silent with lip smacking awe. I will try boneless next time...there was a lot of fat which I was able to remove by making the day before and tkaing off in chilled clumps. I made mashed cauliflower and moroccan chickpea soup from this site. Not a bad Tuesday night, started on Sunday. This will be a regular. Easy and SO tasty.

Rating: 3
Turned out great. I did make a few changes though -- used crushed pineapple not chopped, increased amount of chili sauce a bit, reduced amount of Worcestershire and added about 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar to give the sauce a little bit of tang. I also cooked the short ribs an extra 45 minutes or so, and thickened the sauce about 30 minutes before the end of cooking by whisking 2 Tbsps flour into 1/2 cup of sauce and stirring back into the pot. Red pepper flakes would have been another nice addition to the sauce, but I knew my guests had rather wimpy taste buds! Lean, boneless beef short ribs are a must for this recipe -- my finished sauce had no extra fat. Excellent served alongside mashed potatoes!

Rating: 4
Delicious! Even my very picky 19 month old daughter loved it. I didn't have an oven safe pot big enough to brown and cook them, so I browned the ribs in a fry pan then transferred them into a 9 x 13 pyrex for baking. I sliced the onion into thin rings and layered them over the ribs before adding the sauce for baking. I served them with pasta in a garlic/parmesan sauce instead of mashed potatoes.

This was great, considering how easy it was to make. I made it on a Tuesday night for a Wednesday dinner. When I sampled it Tuesday, I was really disappointed, but like others have said, it was fabulous the second day. Several people asked for the recipe. If you live near a Korean market, try shopping their for the short ribs. Mine sells short ribs 99 cents/pound for the frozen and 1.99-2.99 for the non-frozen.

There are good flavors and it was very easy. Because we are consciousness of cholesterol, I would recommend making it then seperating the liquid from the meat. Refigerate the sauce until the fat forms on the top. Remove fat, cut up the meat removing any visiable fat on the meat, combine meat and sauce reheat and serve. So therefore, I would recommend making the day before I wanted to serve it.

I've made these several times with pork country style ribs, both with and without bones. They were always excellent.

Beef is really excellent in this recipe with mustard and garlic mashed potatoes.

I found this recipe easy to make and well received by my guests. As someone suggested I went to Costco and got the short ribs there. They now have BONELESS ones so I used those. The dish as not too sweet, in part because I used a can of pineapple in its own juices, NOT syrup, and I used a boxed beef stock not a can of beef broth. I would definately recomment trying it, it is a nice alternative to a standard brown gravy dish. One last thing - I strained the gravy and served it on the side but definately should have used a fat seperater before serving it.

This was OK, not as great as I thought it would be from the previous reviews. It was tasty and the meat completely fell off the bone. I only had pineapple packed in juice, so I added some dark corn syrup (gulp!) and it worked out fine. I didn't like all the fat that accumulated in the sauce, but I guess there's no getting around that with short ribs. I think I'm just going back to one of my old tried and true methods in which I parboil them first (to get rid of some of the fat) and then bake them in BBQ Sauce (Open Pit) covered, for hours and then broil them at the last minute until they are "grilled".

I made these for dinner last night and they were great. I didn't have the entire weight in ribs, but made the entire sauce recipe. I let the sauce cook down a bit before baking and then let them cook a little longer uncovered than specified in the recipe, in order to thicken up the sauce some. The extra sauce was appreciated. The ribs were incredibly tender and flavorful. I served them with fusilli (corkscrew pasta), steamed broccoli and a green salad. My only reservation about the recipe is that the sauce is a little on the sweet side, although it stopped just short of being cloying and overpowering.

Made this dish for the first time and it was a crowd pleaser! My husband and kids are still raving about it.

These are awesome. I did one thing slightly different. While browning the ribs I heated the sauce up in a crock pot and did the slow cooking in there. I cooked at 350 for about 1-1/2 hours with the top on and about 1-1/2 with the top cracked open. Before serving I made a roux with 4 tablespoons butter and 4 tablespoons flour and added to thicken the gravy. Truly good with mashed potatoes.
