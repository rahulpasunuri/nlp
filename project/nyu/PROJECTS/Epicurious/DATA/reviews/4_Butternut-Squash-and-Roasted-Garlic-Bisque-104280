It was pretty good but nothing in it was inspiring. I would not make it again for this reason. There are other, better recipes for squash soup of any kind out there.

This soup was a big hit at a family gathering. Made it with a few changes and additions. I didn't want to use dairy, so I substituted margarine in place of the butter and left out the cream. The soup was still rich and smooth. Also, as another poster suggested, I added allspice, nutmeg and clove. This added some terrific autumn spice notes to the soup. When I was done, I still found the soup a little flat. I was able to brighten the flavors by adding a quarter cup each of dry sherry and apple cider. Will definitely be making this again.

Three forks as written but four with the following changes: I slice the squash into bigger sections, coat liberally with olive oil, salt and pepper, and roast it at the same time as the garlic, letting it caramelize. I omit the celery as I found it just a tad bitter? I add the roasted garlic and squash to the soup base, add the broth and let simmer for at least 45 minutes, then puree. I then add about a half cup of heavy cream. Dried sage can be used as a substitute. Always the biggest hit at Soup Night!

the roasted garlic really makes this soup so don't skip this step! i did not have any sage, so I used bay leaves--it was still spectacular. Also the soup is really good even without the cream!

Rating: 4
Easy enough to do that I cleaned the house at the same time! I did not have celery or sage...or chicken broth. But it came out fine with a lot of fresh parsley and water instead of broth (which I usually prefer anyway). It has a fresh taste, very light, even with the additional half cup of sour cream I added. :)

This is really an incredible recipe. Whole family loved it. Per some suggestions, I roasted the squash as well. I also added a bit of cayenne pepper when I sauteed the vegetables and a good amount of fresh cracked ground pepper to give it a bit of a kick. I also used veggie broth and not even a 1/2 cup of skim milk instead of whipping cream. Also used rubbed sage, as the first frost killed my sage plant.

This soup is delicious! I did not have any sage around, so I used fresh rosemary. I also substituted a bit of coconut milk for cream and I used a butternut squash and kabocha squash.

This recipe is rustic, delicious and I will definitely be making it again. I halved the quantity of cream and added some cayenne pepper to taste. I served it with some toasted french bread and salad. I will definitely be making it again.

Incredible soup, perfectly savory unlike a lot of sweeter recipies. I roasted the squash first (worth the extra effort). I used my stick blender right in the pot and got such a beautifully silky consistency with that that I saved some calories by only adding a splash of half and half. Don't even think it really needed the dairy. I will make this again when I entertain the Vegans using few adjustments (veg broth and not stock and no cream)

Even if you're missing the celery, this recipe is definitely one to write down and save forever. Tweak it as you like, it is versatile and the color is great. Toast the squash seeds with salt, olive oil and a little chili powder to use as garnish or just to eat on its own.. delicious.

This is a delicious and super easy fall soup. I usually add a bit more garlic, and use about 1 cup of whole milk to make it super silky. Add a crostini topped with fontina cheese to make an elegant serving.

This soup is excellent as is. I did use one more head of garlic, as my family loves garlic, as do I.

I have made this bisque several times now. The recipe as it is written is flawless, with one exception. For a stronger roasted garlic flavor, I use 3 head, not 2. The fresh sage makes all the difference in the world - and it goes without saying that ground black pepper and crusty bread finish off the recipe perfectly. A must for the winter!!

Everyone loved it, even my husband who hates all vegetables and vegetable-related things.I roasted the squash, but it was still difficult for me to peel. I was a little worried because the recipe wasn't clear on whether you were supposed to have 4# squash before peeling or after, but i bought two squash equalling 4.5# and it turned out okay.

Rating: 4
SO GOOD!!! I've made it as a first course for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit. I've never used the whipping cream because the soup is thick and creamy enough as is. I also use a lot less than the recommended amount of butter (maybe 2 T instead of a whole half stick). I've made it with only olive oil before and it was still quite good. Since butternut squash is so difficult to peel, I would recommend roasting it beforehand -- cut in half lengthwise, cover each half in foil, and bake about a half hour (you can do this while you're roasting the garlic). Overall, a great Epicurious find!

Rating: 3
Very good but not the best squash soup I've ever made. I love roasted garlic and often use more than a recipe calls for. Here I followed the recipe but found the garlic taste to be rather too strong. That may be because the sage was too subtle for me and didn't add enough contrasting flavor. To be fair, I used vegetable broth instead of chicken. And I didn't add the whipping cream (it seemed quite rich enough without) which might have worked to smooth out the garlic. Anyway, my guests did enjoy it, but next time I'd add more sage and maybe a bit of half and half, and see what that does to deepen and enrich the flavor.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe. I took it to a potluck at which everyone who tried it seemed to agree. The only part I hate is dealing with the squash, though I tend to roast it first to make peeling easier. And in a pinch, there's the peeled, cubed, bagged variety in the frozen foods section.

YUM! I skipped the celery and sauteed the sage in the butter along with the onion and carrots. Served it sprinkled with toasted pumpkin seeds and swapped half and half for heavy cream.

This was a really good first course for our Thanksgiving dinner, but I altered the recipe quite a bit. First, I halved and roasted the squash in the oven along with the garlic. I added a dash of allspice, cloves, and nutmeg to the onion, carrot, and celery after it had finished cooking. I did not add any cream. And finally, I made a roasted red pepper puree and put a dab of that in the middle of each bowl. It was very good and got rave reviews at the table!

Rating: 2
I thought this was good but not great. I found myself wondering what else I could add to it to bump up the flavor. I didn't find that letting it sit for a day intensified it very much, if at all. Extra sage, nutmeg, cayenne, lotsa salt and pepper helped the flavor pop a bit.

First off, I halved the recipe. I roasted the squash with the garlic (raw squash is a pain to chop!)Did not use any celery at all. Was completely out of sage so I used some herbs de provence. I also did not add any cream, I thought it was creamy enough without it. It is the best sqash bisque I've ever had!

This is fine, but I recently made a similar recipe from Deborah Madison's Vegetarian Cooking For Everyone and I liked it a lot better. DM's version was much simpler, had fewer ingredients, and had a lot less fat. I would make DM's version again but not this one. By the way, she garnishes it with cubes of Fontina, pecorino, or ricotta salata, which are a very nice addition.

We loved this soup! I'm not a big fan of pre-made butternut squash soup from the store, but this was very different from that. I prepared the garlic exactly as directed, and I think that's what really made the soup. I substituted unsweetened soy milk for cream, and though I might have lost some creaminess, it was still very thick and creamy. And better the next day.

Rating: 3
This is a tasty dish. I try and make it whenever I have a spare butternut squash around. I usually omit the celery, although I have made it with the celery before. It's fine both ways. I don't find the celery adds a much. I agree with the other reviewer who noted that the sage adds a savory taste to the soup, rather than the sweetness of some other squash soups. I'm all about savory. I usually add a bit more roasted garlic too. But I love garlic. If you don't add extra garlic, I would recommend letting the soup set for a day to really bring out the flavor. I also usually don't add the cream. The soup has plenty of butter, so it has a rich taste even without the cream. I also find the texture without the cream is smooth enough for me.

Rating: 3
Due to various household limitations, I sauteed the garlic instead of roasting, used celery seed instead of celery, and used up the sour cream left over from Thanksgiving in place of whipping cream. I also used vegetable stock instead of chicken for my vegetarian daughter (she was more or less okay with the cream). Delicious! I might try adding some red pepper flakes for a kick when I reheat it for lunch tomorrow.

Rating: 3
This was a perfect first course for Thanksgiving this year. I read most reviews and went with the receipe as written adding the garlic a little at a time. I ended up adding almost all of it anyway and thought it was just right. The next day, I did thin it out a bit(it was pretty thick) with a little skim milk as it was plenty rich enough, and sprinkled in some brown sugar and stirred it through before serving. This is a very good soup and worth the effort.

This is delectable and easy to make. It has to be the recipe utilized by many top restaurants, and Whole Foods. Elegant enough for Thanksgiving Dinner. Substitute milk for cream for a healthier version.

A few minor changes and this is a super easy way to please anyone... choose a slightly heavier squash (about 4.5lbs), do not skip the sage, add a dash or two of corriander and freshly ground nutmeg, & then to make this soup fantastic, puree a medium sized jalapeno into the whipping cream (the dairy will control the heat nicely). For your non-vegan vegitarian friends, you can easily substitute a good veggie stock for the chicken stalk... you probably won't even notice the difference. :-)

This is a very good recipe. I, too, roasted the squash before adding to the soup -- and I roasted the heads of garlic in the same pan by just cutting the heads in half and adding a little oil. The cream really does make it special, but isn't entirely necessary (if you're watching your waistline). I also added nutmeg at the end for a little extra flavor.

Absolutely delicious! My family loved this for Thanksgiving. I don't think I changed a thing, except I made garlic croutons as a garnish.

I make this soup once a year and we all just love it every time. The only thing that I do differently is that I roast all of the vegetables including the squash (just halve, deseed and roast cut side down). Then I add it all (except squash skin) to the hot broth and simmer for about 20 minutes. Blend then add cream. You end up with a richer roasted flavour. Really delicious.

Rating: 4
This is one of the few recipes which I rate as a four fork!! Wonderful! Partially roasting the squash with the garlic makes it easier to chop (or the microwave works too). Those who found this bland might have used a squash that was too large. Mine was 3 3/5 pounds, and the roasted garlic flavor really came through. Also use fresh sage.

I have made this recipe several times and people can't get enough of it. Beware: budget your portions/appetites accordingly because it's very filling! Save a lot of time by purchasing peeled (and possibly pre-cut) squash - it takes so much time to do it by hand. Also it saves time (and washing up) if you use a hand blender in the stockpot. That said, this recipe is well worth the effort.

Excellent soup. I made what I judged to be about a half recipe: 1 head garlic, 1 lge onion, 1 lge carrot, 1 stalk celery, 1 lge squash, and 2 cups vegetarian vegetable broth (I am a vegetarian). I refrigerated the soup BEFORE pureeing (due to time constraints). Reheated after pureeing, and found the soup rich enough that skim milk was enough to give it that creaminess. Flavor is exquisite. This freezes and reheats well in the microwave, making it excellent to prepare ahead for lunch, and of course loads better than what you buy from the soup places.

Rating: 4
This is a delicious, rich soup. Everyone who has tried it at my house has requested the recipe. I usually cut the recipe in half to make 6 servings. I also save a few steps by roasting all the vegetables (brush with oil) for about an hour, then pureeing with the liquids. This soup absolutely needs to made the day before and then refrigerated so that the garlic mellows & all the ingredients have time to blend. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was delicious. I cut it in half to make 6 servings instead of 12. I added a peeled and cored empire apple to the recipe as well. Also I omitted the cream altogether (although I was only going to use 5% cream anyway) I felt it was rich and thick enough without it and wanted to reduce the fat content. It did not require any salt - just a dash of pepper. Would definitely make this again - yummy!

This is truly great soup. I roasted the garlic and squash on 425 for an hour and added them both to the onions, celery and carrots with the broth and sage. Didn't think I'd like the sage (as I normally don't), but it was very good. We had friends over and they thought the soup looked gross until it was pureed and the cream was added. They each had two bowls. I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne and a few sprinkles of cumin to pick it up. We'll be making this much through the winter months.

I followed the roasting suggestions and everything else to a tee -- except I couldn't find fresh sage, so I used the dried equivalent (1/4 tsp dried ground = 2 tsp fresh). Unlike another reviewer, my family and I found the garlic too overpowering and an unpalatable counterpart to the sweet squash. Perhaps that substitution was the culprit, but I won't be trying this again.

Although all my guests raved about this soup, I was a little disappointed that the roasted garlic (which I love) didn't come through quite enough. Next time - and after all that fuss there will definitely be a next time - I'll try 3 heads instead of 2. Also, I substituted a good organic vegetable broth for chicken broth because we're vegetarians, and I roasted the squash along with the garlic as per the previous reviews - definitely easier!

Very good soup. Roasting the squash gives it a wonderful flavor, but makes it a little too sweet for my palate. To remedy the sweetness I added some creme fraiche (could use sour cream, but it might curdle) and for some heat I added a couple teaspoons pureed chipotle in adobo. Lovely!!!!

Absolutely excellent. Served for the first time this Thanksgiving and it was a total success. I made a few changes to the recipe. First off I halved the recipe (there were only 4 of us and it worked out fine), secondly, I halved the squash and put the garlic in the cleaned out seed areas and microwaved the squash halves with the garlics prior to baking them to speed up the process. Lastly, I used 2.5 cups of vegetable stock and 1/2 cup of white wine rather than 3 cups of stock. The results were excellent. Recipes were given out to our dinner guests.

such a wonderful soup! to make things a little easier, i roasted the squash for 30-40 min and just scooped out the flesh instead of peeling and cutting. also, i just tucked the unpeeled garlic (sans foil) into the squash cavities and roasted them together - easy! a great garnish are the gruyere croutons which accompany another winter squash soup on this site. and substituting milk for the heavy cream doesn't harm this soup in the least.

Beautiful presentation, with the orange squash and green sage. I can't recommend this enough!

This soup was way too garlicky. And I LOVE roasted garlic; maybe my heads of garlic were too big? Whatever it was, the final outcome was bascially that I felt like I was eating pureed garlic. I would suggest using just ONE head-besides that, the texture was great, it looked pretty, especially with the cream and sage toppings, and I am sure the butternut part would have tasted good if I could have actually detected it amongst all of that garlicky taste!

Butternut squash makes an outstanding base for soup. Add the garlic and you have the perfect soup. It's a little heavier than your typical bisque, but what wonderful flavors. Guests raved about it. Would highly recommend for a dinner party.

It was a big Thanksgiving day hit and is very filling. Family members who did not think they liked butternut squash loved this bisque. Next time I will skip the cream.

I made this in a pressure cooker, which was very quick and easy. It was creamy and delicious, but too sweet for my taste. A splash of hot sauce gave it a nice zing and cut the sweetness, so next time I would add some red pepper sauce at the start. I also tasted it strait out of the fridge the next day, and think it would make a very good cold summer soup.

An easy, hearty, and delicious winter soup.

Absolutely excellent!! We liked it so much at our Xmas dinner, that we made another batch for ourselves for lunches. If you want to keep the dish lighter in calories, it is just as good without the cream.

I prepared the soup without the heavy cream and found it to be delcious and light with a creamy, buttery texture-- the lack of cream didn't hinder the taste at all.

This bisque is wonderful in taste, texture and color. A definate "must make again". I found the squash needed almost an hour of cooking to become tender, I'll cut smaller than 1" chunks next time.

This soup is delicious! It taste really gourmet yet so easy to prepare. I served it to some who don't like squash, but they loved this soup.

this soup is WONDERFUL! 12 servings seemed like a lot, though, so i halved the recipe and used rosemary instead of sage (as i didn't have any sage) - i would definitely make it with rosemary again!

I made this soup for Thanksgiving and it was absolutely delicious! It was the hit of the meal. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I would definitely make it again but I will try to bake the squash before cubing it so that it will be easier to cut.

This soup is wonderful! The only thing I did different was to bake the butternut squash- instead of sauteing it. Its just too hard to peel and cut into cubes- baking it is much easier.

I made this for my dinner club. I liked it, and it seemed to be a big hit.
