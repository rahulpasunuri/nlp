This is really very good. I added a teaspoon of miso and some red pepper flakes to the broth as it was reducing.

Rating: 3
I did not have chicken broth on hand, so substituted about 1 1/2 TB of light miso and water. Used just a few drops of sesame oil so as not to mask the miso and a pinch of salt. A delicious and subtle sauce. I recommend draining the bok choy really well, so that you don't dilute the reduced mixture when you add it at the end.

This was a great use of the bok choy I get in my CSA. I always swapped it out for other things but when I came across this recipe, I made sure swap for more. I really like the simplicity of the dish. The delicate flavor holds up well with the short braise and the sesame adds just enough complexity to make it more interesting. Will definitely make again.

I had higher hopes for this recipe...I reduced the sauce a lot, and used hot sesame oil to make it spicier. I also added carmelized onions, but the flavor was still lacking to me..not sure how to make it better but it was a decent side.

I bought some baby bok choy and wanted a recipe that would highlight it without masking the taste. I cut the butter down to about a half a tbs (trying to eat healthier) and added about a tbs of canola oil. I though the results were simple yet delicious and really let the sweetness of the bok choy come through. I salted the bok choy itself very lightly with kosher salt while letting the broth reduce. My only complaint is that the reduced broth mixture is very salty, and I used a reduced sodium broth as it was. Perhaps not reducing it as much would help, but it's very delicious otherwise. I'd make this again.

Simple and really good. I didn't use the sesame oil - I had it but sesame oil didn't go with what else I was cooking. The bok choy really cooks down so plan accordingly.

This was delicious. I halved the butter and doubled the liquid with 1/2 stock 1/2 sake that I simmered with a 1 inch chunk of ginger and 1 garlic clove. Added some crushed red peppers, black sesame seeds and roasted szechuan pepper. Served with sate seasoned scallops. Way better than takeout!

Finally, a bok choy recipe I can't ruin. It was delicious and simple. I let the sauce reduce till it was brown and almost gone (OK, I admit, it wasn't on purpose). I didn't have sesame oil so I added a bit of soy sauce, garlic, and olive oil at the end. It was pretty on the plate, too. Will definitely make again.

This is so simple and yet my family raved about it. I served it with simple basmati rice and Tilapia w/citrus bagna cauda [ from the site of a popular TV network about food ] and the meal turned what was a frustrating day into a wonderful evening. Strange, but true. Absolute keeper.

I've made this numerous times and it's always a winner. A perfect accompaniment to chicken, seafood dishes and stir fries. I don't think it really needs 3 tbs. of butter though, especially if you have good quality chicken broth. 2 tbs. was plenty.

I loved this and will definitely make it again. At the last minute, I realized I didn't have the sesame oil, so I used olive oil instead with a splash of lemon juice and the pepper. It turned out really great and I used the sauce over the breaded pork cutlets I served with the bok choy. Yum!

I also used regular bok choy, b/c that's what I had in the fridge. And I added garlic. I didn't have any sesame oil, so I used a little teriyaki ginger sauce. My husband actually commented on how good it was! Next time I'll get baby bok choy, as the regular is a little awkward, and it can be a little stringy.

mmm. Baby bok was tender and sauce was flavorful. I used black sesame oil and the sauce looked great on the plate (though I was too hungry to let it reduce all the way!).

I only gave this three forks because I only braised the bok choy and didn't use the sauce - but wow! I've always wanted to like bok choy and this is perfect. I added a little garlic, salt and pepper, used good vegetable broth to make it vegetarian and only 1 tablespoon of butter. I imagine you could leave out the butter entirely if you wanted to. My bok choy was a little bit bigger and so required about ten minutes to cook, but was entirely worth it. Without the sesame oil, it can be served with anything.

This was really tasty. As suggested I added ginger and garlic to the broth. I also used regular bok choy rather than baby bok choy b/c that's what I had in the fridge. I marinated some shrimp with lime, salt. pepper and olive oil and then seared them in a separate pan while the bok choy was braising. Served the shrimp on top of the bok choy and spooned the sauce over both. Easy and delicious.

I think this was perfect. I'm actually trying to gain weight (got sick got better but got skinny) and have been eating risotto every other night and nowhere enough greens. Served this with pan-seared salt & pepper shrimp, seared scallops with a wine/ginger/garlic pan sauce, and 2 left-over risottos - one radicchio and one saffron. This was a perfect accompaniment, just enought non-sweet flavor, but rich enough to stand up to the other items. Used it with a large baby bok choy or a small full one (I think the little baby ones would be too delicate) cut in thirds lengthwise and boiled/steamed at good heat for as long as it took to reduce 1 cup of wine for the scallops. I didn't reduce the sauce, just poured it all in a bowl and served it with a slotted spoon. I'm relieved to find a non-aggressive green vegetable.

Just right as written, though cooking time was a few minutes longer. Braising liquid had a lovely flavor. Went nicely with steak and would be good with an asian grilled chicken dish, too.

Wish our experience had been like everyone else's! But instead, the bok choy was tough, virtually unchewable, even though it braised considerably longer than 5min. I did use only 1T butter but if it takes more, I'd pass up the recipe anyway. (For the record, I added garlic and ginger, also slivered red pepper so the servings LOOKED gorgeous.) Will try once again ... just in case.

I couldn't believe that there were so many reviews for a bok choy recipe. BUT, after making it I can see why. Fabulous flavor. I substituted HOT Sesame Oil for regular and reduced the butter to 1 tablespoon. A repeat recipe and company worthy. I served this along side Halibut with Sambal Vinaigrette and Wasabi Cream,

This was good, but definitely make sure you use very similarly-sized baby bok choy - if you have one that is larger than the other, the smaller one gets too soggy. Also, I think this would benefit from a little garlic or maybe soy or hoisin sauce like one person used. This was a great accompaniment to the Miso-Marinated Salmon on this site. Would make again with a bit of tweaking.

I also found this was delicious with minimal alterations (basically, I just cooked the sauce down a little more than suggested in the recipe so that it was denser). Super simple and fast.

My only complaint is that the sauce is too runny to let the flavors stick. So I added some cornstarch to the broth and it was perfect. Also, if you MUST use regular bok choy, cut the stalks from the leaves and cook the stalks first. Otherwise, the leaves get too soggy.

I have never been able to figure out how to cook bok choy so it tastes good. This recipe has changed that. It is simple, easy to cook, fast and delicious. I can't get enough of it. I have now cooked it more than once with the same excellent results. This is now part of my permanent repartoire.

Wonderfully simple and wonderfully tasty! I had some beef broth on hand and used that instead of chicken broth. Worked great! I usually use bok choy in a stir fry...not on it's own.

I followed the recipe as written, including the full amount of butter (contrary to suggestions), but did add a minced garlic clove to the broth. At first I thought the dish was on the bland side, but the more I had of it, the better I liked it. It became my favorite part of a dinner which was all very good. The simplicity of the recipe really lets the vegetable shine through. Baby bok choy is a scarce item on the west coast of Florida, but whenever I see it again, I'll snap it up.

This is the first time I have made baby bok choy. They are the cutest thing and so much more flavorful that the giant ones. This recipe could not have been easier.

I could make a meal out of just these little guys!

Yum! This is a tasty and easy side. I added two minced shallots and about three cakes (diced) of spiced dried tofu (the kind that is in Pad Thai at good Thai restaurants; it holds up much better than the plain stuff and you can get it at any decent Asian market) to the first step. I pulled the tofu out with the bok choy before reducing the sauce. Also added red pepper flakes at the end with the sesame oil. This is a sleeper; you won't believe how much you like it.
