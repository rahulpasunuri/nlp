I am updating my prior review...it was my turmeric. I used Penzey's and the label said to use only 2/3 the amount called for in recipes because it's stronger. That was definitely the flavor I had too. I'd recommend using caution with the turmeric if you have a flavorful variety.

I'm not going to rate this...there was something wrong with my soup! It had a nasty bitter taste. I'm going to assume it was something I had that was wrong, rather than the recipe, since nobody else seems to have had this problem. I'm not sure if it was the stock I used, or something with the turmeric, or maybe it was my potatoes or cauliflower. The salsa, curry oil and yogurt were all fine. If anyone else has this problem please post a review! I sure hope the leftovers taste better than the first time. As is, I'd give it one fork, which I almost never do.

Lots of layers of flavor in this soup - I used chicken broth rather than veg, because I didn't have the latter. I only made the yogurt side - the soup was very good with it mixed it. You could really taste the fennel and mint. The best part - a VERY quick meal to make.

The minted yogurt added such a nice flavor to the soup. The soup serves very well leftover. It was fun to go to the Indian market to get the ingredients.

This was part of my eat healthy for the New Year plan. I made everything but the curry oil. Instead I put the curry right into the soup. I made the soup, onion relish and yogurt as directed. It was all very tasty but I think it was missing garlic. Next time I will definitely add it. As Mr Alton Brown once said "garlic don't need no reason".

Very exotic tasting. Currently on a curry kick and this is a great balance. The minted yogurt is a nice touch.
