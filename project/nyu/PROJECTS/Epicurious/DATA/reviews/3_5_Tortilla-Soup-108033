This was so yummy! Definitely worth the effort. Its important to let the guajillo chiles get soft so they disintegrate in the blender. I had little flecks of chiles in the soup. No big deal, tho.

All the people who complained about this recipe must have either done something wrong (to be fair you can easily screw up the chilies) or have the taste buds of a 8 year old. this soup is delicious. I've followed it by the book. Using chile pasilla and all the correct ones (was surprised to find them all at a non-descript mexican bodega 3 blocks away from my house.. found on yelp) and despite being quite a bit of work, it paid off with delicious texture, complex flavor, and just the right heat. Definetelly do it, and make sure you have the right ingredients. They may be easier to find than you think.

This soup was good but not worth the time and effort. It had a nice texture but was very bland. Using dried chiles as a garnish did nothing because you couldn't eat them. Also, crema mexicana is much runnier than sour cream and didn't work well.

Make this when tomatoes are in season, or use canned ones. I made this recipe with out of season tomatoes and it was tasteless. I also use more peppers than the recipe calls for.

This is a good starting point from which to make a great soup. I used one poblano chile and three little chiles (forgot the name). I threw them in the oven (right on the rack) until they blistered along with a few chicken breasts and one dozen cut up tortillas--this saved the oil and hassle of frying them. I used olive oil n the soup, added a big teaspoon of cumin, a whole lime, two shredded chicken breasts, extra onion, extra cilantro, extra garlic...and (here's the secret ingredient) a few tablespoons of white vinegar. The vinegar helps cut some of the heat from the chiles and also brings out the flavors without adding extra salt. The whole ordal took less than 40 minutes (including the roasting of the chiles, chips, and chicken). With the modifications, this is a great, healthy, flavorful main course dish.

This recipe was delicious. I could not find the pasilla chiles but followed the recipe otherwise but added chicken. The flavor was amazing authentic. On the table, I had fresh cilantro, fresh avocado, fresh lime, queso fresco and homemade salsa, was awesome!!!

YUCK! After reading so many other great reviews I gave it a try. It took way too long to prepare to taste like enchilada sauce from a can. The best part was the avocado garnish. Totally not worth the effort.

This is a wonderful soup. The aroma as you prepare the soup is so rich and wonderful. One of my favorites!

I added shredded chicken, corn and black beans to add depth. The base is absolutely delicious!

WARNING: a couple of people remarked on the bitterness - like garlic, dried chiles get VERY bitter when overcooked. 10 seconds in a blazing hot pan is WAY too long. i make lots of mexican food with dried chiles, and for most uses i press the pieces down in a dry, medium heat pan for 5 seconds max, until fragrant. if you see smoke, your pan's too hot! using a little oil is ok too, just get them out before they burn. regarding this recipe, tortilla soup doesn't have to be this much work. check out rick bayless's "mexican everyday" at your library, the tortilla soup recipe is just as delicious, only easier.

This was a robust and delicious soup. I added cooked shredded chicken and made it a main course.

I'm usually easy to please, so I'm surprised that others liked this so much. I followed the recipe exactly (which was quite time- and labor- intensive), but found the soup bitter and otherwise flavorless. It didn't get eaten.

Neither I nor my boyfriend were that happy with this recipe. We followed the recipe exactly, plus added poached chicken. The guajillo chiles made the dish very bitter-- otherwise, the soup was pretty flavorless. I tried to save it by adding some salt and cumin, but it only helped a little. I agree with other reviewers that the soup needed something sweet to counter-act the bitterness of both the chiles. We've been trying to find a good tortilla soup for awhile. I guess the search continues...

This soup is Mexican soul food at its best. The recipe has many steps and ingredients, but the result is deeply satisfying. I also add poached shredded chicken and garnish with fresh lime wedges.

This is the best (and most traditional) tortilla soup I've been able to find.

I thought this soup was fantastic. I added grilled chicken, black beans and corn (and probably more garlic than indicated) which made it a meal. Everyone loved it including my two kids--definitely a keeper.

The final result was great and my guests just loved it, but it seems important to clarify the size of the chiles required as the chiles I used were quite large. Upon doubling the recipe, the base came out extremely spicy. Personally, I enjoy spicy food, but this was HOT. I had to add more tortillas and more broth to bring it down a notch.

I have made this soup several times now and each time I make it, I get rave reviews from everyone. It's best made in the fall or winter because it is a heavy, hearty soup.

Guests raved!I stuck to the recipe- we're lucky to have a mexican food store in Guelph Ontario! The fried white corn tortillas were the crowning touch. I did use canned diced tomatoes (Aurora brand)- saved time and tasted incredible!

I added corn, olives, leftover chicken, and a half of a can of enchilada sauce...i did not puree the corn, olives or chicken...i added the last 10 minutes of cooking. it turned out pretty good...I did add a whole onion in there instead of 1/4 that it calls for. Very heavy dish, but good for a nice winter soup. Everyone loved it...I just wasnt too crazy about it.

Almost all dried chiles are easier to puree if before using them in your recipe you put them to boil in water for 5-10 min., let them cool and then remove seeds and veins (use rubber gloves if not used to touch chiles) do not use the water if you dont want your soup to be too hot. To fry dried chiles do not soak them, and be sure not to let them burn at all 'cause that bitters them.

The first time I made this I used a cup of the ancho-guajillo sauce from the same issue in place of the chili sauce listed here. The soup was excellent. The second time I followed the ingredient list, but also omitted the pasilla chilis and mixed all the ingredients together, without the chips. Then I pureed it as listed and heated it before serving. Again, an excellent soup. The addition of sauteed corn gives a pleasant sweetness with the heat, but that's personnal preference.

Whew! Time consuming is an understatement but well worth it. I omitted the pasillas, there was an understone of bitterness so I added 2 tsp of sugar & a good squeeze of lime juice & that definitely toned it down. When the crema & cheese was added it also mellowed it out - very delicious!

I pureed in a food processor, but still wasn't able to get the guajillo chile skins small enough so I strained through a seive. This worked well. The ancho chiles were to bitter to include. The soup was very good.

Excellent, everyone raved, it's a wonderful one dish meal on a cold rainy day.

We deleted the step of batching the tomato mixture in a blender and gradually added a cup of broth directly to the mixture and used a handheld blender to puree the soup. The only step that we will delete in the future is the pasilla's due to the fact that some of the strips took on a bitter taste. Otherwise this is an exellent opening act to any Mexican or Soutwestern meal.

This soup was amazing! The end result seemed very authentic and everyone loved it. The recipe may seem daunting but it's really not that hard, just leave enough time (about 2 hours). I also used the authentic ingredients which really added to the dish, of course they are all easy to find in San Francisco.

This tortilla soup was outstanding! It was the highlight of our Sunday burrito dinner and for a few more evenings during the week. Don't skip on the sour cream and the cheese (yes, I hunted out the real stuff). The recipe was long and took awhile, but the payoff was unbelieveable!
