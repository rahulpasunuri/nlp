This pesto is delicious and a welcome change to the usual. So sad some people (Melby) think dinner is not dinner unless there's a dead animal involved.

I prepared this exactly as directed except that I used fresh English peas and a different shaped pasta. It was a big hit with my family, which includes picky kids. This is a lovely and easy Spring dish that I'll definitely make again!

Loved this, used walnuts instead of pine nuts (have you seen the price of pine nuts??!). The whole family enjoyed this, and there is plenty left over for lunch tomorrow! ;)

I used less peas and supplemented with zucchini-- which made the pesto less sweet. I also added 4 kalamato olives and a bit of lemon zest. I used another reader's idea about using walnuts.It is delicious and I will surely make this again!

Very easy! Added some fresh mint and chopped scallions for an extra spring flavour. Not a strong 'pea' flavour, which might be a turnoff to some (the strong flavour).

Easy and delicious. Loved it as a pasta sauce but also used a slightly thicker version for a home made ravioli filling. Wonderful!

One of our favorite recipes. The pea pesto is absolutely delicious. I am cooking this dish quite often for my vegetarian husband.

This wasn't what I was hoping for. I added some sausage thank goodness because it was at least a little worth it. I added some dried basil and crushed red pepper and then it was palatable. I also sprinkled with parm cheese. I prefer actual pesto with peas throughout instead of pesto made of peas.

Don't bother. Not worth it. Would not make again.

The peas gave this dish a sweetness that I found off-putting.

I made a half recipe for just the two of us as a side dish. Used 2 cloves of garlic, also used walnuts which I prefer in basil pesto. Didn't measure but used a lot more olive oil than in the recipe to get it to blend. I was going to save some whole peas to add at the end but instead put them in the blender for a quick whirl. This was a beautiful, quick and delicious dish! I will definitely make it again. Might even keep some of the pesto in the freezer for a really quick lunch or supper!

I made this once and my family liked it... I added a handful of basil and used walnuts the second time and it was even better. My 3 year old loved it. Now how easy is it to get a 3 year old to love food???

It's true that this is extremely easy, and uses ingredients that one often has on hand. But it was a bit boring. When I increased the pesto to pasta ratio the next day, and added a little extra oil, it was delicious.

I would definitely make this again. I made this on a day when I was really too tired to cook. I used whole wheat pesto because that's all I had. I topped it with chopped cilantro. It was quick and nice

This is a great recipe, mostly because it was cheap,fast, and easy to make. It also can be served hot or cold, making it a good dish to bring on a picnic. I think next time i make it I may fold in some extra whole peas at the end for texture and visual appeal.
