Welp....I didn't go by exactly the recipe after reading the reviews...did add garlic...did add lime juice...didn't have serrano...so added jalapeno....also didn't use white onion...had scallions on hand and wanted to use them up....I blended the stuff except for the avocado....because of the reviews....but decided that the stuff was way to hot and needed to be tempered so then blended the avocado in....very nice....and then I added chopped tomato so I wouldn't have to made a tomato salsa for the crispy pork.....looks and tastes good to me!

For all of those who keep calling it guacamole, or referring to guacamole in the review, this is NOT a guacamole recipe! This is a traditional tomatillo-avocado salsa, it's not meant to be as thick as guacamole, it's missing all the additions (like tomatoes) that guacamole should have, and it's way more watery than a guacamole should be.

Maybe my ingredients weren't properly ripe, but I thought this was pretty bad. I wish I'd made my own guacamole recipe instead.

GREAT salsa (guacamole) recipe. I added lime juice as suggested and it was a good addition. A must try with the Crispy Pork. There is a very similar recipe in the same issue: Guacamole with Roasted Tomatillos.

I make this all the time and I love it...I do add more onion and cilantro and lime juice (I think it makes it brighter flavored) Ripe avocados is key, and I think the lime juice thins it out to be more like salsa and less like guacamole.

I agree that this is very good. I also agree that it's more like guacamole than salsa. I didn't make mine spicy enough, but that's because I used 1 poblano instead of 2 Serrano (which I couldn't find). I think that it's a good idea to puree the other ingredients first, and then add the avocado. It also needs salt, pepper, and lime juice. I think I'll be making this again.

It was very good, I think next time I would add garlic salt and lemon juice...

I forgot to say that I don't puree the avocados, but chop them and add them into the mixture.

I just posted but forgot to say that I don't puree the avocados with the rest. I chop them and leave them chunky.

I actually combined this recipe with another on Epicurious. Oooo, its a favorite. Shallots and garlic as well as lime juice and cilantro really do the trick. I've made it 3 times this month!

Our avocados weren't perfectly ripe (bland), thus this avocado salsa was bland. Increased onion, cilantro, (didn't have any more tomatillas) peppers, and salt. This helped a bit. Then I added a little sauteed garlic which was okay. Should have stopped there before I added juice of a lemon. End result tasted like lemon and tasteless avocados.

Great salsa, actually more like a guacamole to me. My one suggestion would be to not process all ingredients together at once. First "smush" the peeled avocado in a bowl, then process the tomatillos to a coarse chop, follow with onion, garlic, and cilantro, then mix them together in the bowl with the avocado. First time making this I processed all together as stated in the recipe. The consistency was too smooth because the avocado processes faster then the rest of the ingredients. My second try produced a nice chunky "salsa" like I prefer. Served along side a bay shrimp pico de gallo salsa and white corn tortilla chips. Perfect for a football Sunday.

This made alot of salsa, but that was fine since it was so good. Perfect pairing with the crispy pork carnitas. Delicious with tortilla chips also. Storing the leftovers with the plastic wrap resting directly on it keeps the avocado from turing brown. Can also squeeze some fresh lemon or lime juice on the top surface to keep it fresh.

Yummy!!!

Great taste, great color. Even the next-day leftovers looked fine (unlike most avocado dishes).
