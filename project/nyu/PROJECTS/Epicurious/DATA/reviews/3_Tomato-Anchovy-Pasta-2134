I'm not sure what I did wrong, but this was pretty terrible.

I love this recipe. I've made it for years and it always turns out excellent. When I don't have green onions, I use a yellow onion. Good thing to make with pantry items during those weeks that I don't have time to go to the grocery store or am snowed in.

Fast and easy! My teenage kids like it a lot and they prepare it themselves. It's a forgiving recipe, too -- the measurements are all pretty much "more or less." My son takes the leftovers to school for lunch and eats them at room temperature.

Actually, I thought it deserves two and a half forks. It was good but not superb. Will probably make it again.

Very tasty. Wish I had doubled the sauce or at least used two of the 14.5oz cans.

Very good and very easy. My 6 green onions chopped came to 2/3 cup, which I then supplemented with shallot. Be sure to have enough green onions on hand, they vary so much in size. I used slightly less than 2 ounces of anchovy because of a concern with salt. More can be added later, or even anchovy paste. Since I made 1/2 pound of pasta, I added about 2 tablespoons of Parmeasan, and passed more at table. Taking a hint from a similar recipe on this site, I added a teaspoon of lemon juice to the sauce, and near the end of cooking time, a small handful of chopped fresh parsley. This pasta dish is definitely worth repeating.

YUM! This was great. Didn't measure the weight of the pasta, but make sure there is ample sauce. Delicious.

Excellent, and very, very easy. Use a full pound of pasta, though.
