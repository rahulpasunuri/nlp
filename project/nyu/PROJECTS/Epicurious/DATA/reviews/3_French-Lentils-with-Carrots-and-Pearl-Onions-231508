I made some modifications: Used olive oil and a small amount of butter. Clove is a traditional seasoning so, stick cloves in 8 or 9 of the pearl onions or use a large pinch. Skipped the thyme (don't need with the cloves). Doubled the carrots. Reduced the liquid to 4 cups of chicken stock (no water) and added some Merguez sausage (cooked whole). Any kind of sausage would work -- if I could get that famous Vire andouille here, I'd have used that!

I did my lentils with Organic Vegetable Broth and added a tsp of red pepper. It was delicious!

Meh. This was just ok. It needed, I don't know, something to beef up the flavor some. With a generous sprinkling of salt and pepper it tasted better, but still not the winner recipe I was hoping for. I tried using chicken stock in place of some of the water and added some extra garlic, but this still just seemed kind of bland to me.

I use 1/2 chicken stock instead of all water - it gives it just a little more depth.

Good recipe. Used regular onions and cooked the lentils longer. I don't normally expect to see comedy in recipe reviews but the review from bigbushgirl below is pretty hilarious. As a former resident of West Michigan I feared it was serious but realized that no Baptist congregation would have anything like "Holy Rosary" in their title. Almost got me though. Thanks

This recipe is bland. The lentils hold a firm texture, which is nice. The carrots and the garlic, however, do not add enough flavor to the dish. Save your effort for another dish requiring pearl onions

Let me preface my comments with the fact that I prefer lentils to be relativley soft and for the resulting dish to have something of a stew-like consistency. That being said, I found this recipe a bit bland as prepared, and so I added a splash of apple cider vinegar (1 tblsp) and half a can of crushed tomatoes. It just needed a bit more body and a touch of tang. I also beleive the cooking time should be longer, or the dish should be made a day ahead, in order ot let the flavors meld and for the lentils to soften a bit more. And finally, I'd recommend soaking your lentils over night to hydrate them before cooking, and to then cut the liquid in half.

Really one of the best lentil dishes I've tried. I made it with what I had on hand (sweet white onion sliced thin instead of pearl onions and dried thyme instead oa a sprig) and it was still delicious. Be warned, it makes QUITE a few lentils, but works well cut in half as well. Would also make a tasty vegetarian main dish in and of itself.
