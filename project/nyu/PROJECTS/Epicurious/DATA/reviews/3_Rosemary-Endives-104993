Wonderful vegetable dish. So easy to make and so delicious. Served with "Spinach and Pear Salad with Rosemary Vinaigrette" from this site, and roast chicken. What a fabulous weeknight meal!

I didn't think there was anything very special about this.

This was delicious - I couldn't stop eating the endives after making them, and the rosemary wafted through the kitchen. A nice side dish.

Like the previous reviewer, I skipped the sugar. We enjoyed it. Watch that they don't brown too quickly.

Made this tonite and really enjoyed it. LEft out the sugar and let it cook for about 45 - 50 minutes total. Simple but tastes sophisticated.
