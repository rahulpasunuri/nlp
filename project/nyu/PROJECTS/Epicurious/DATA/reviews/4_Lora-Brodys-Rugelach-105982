These were delicious. I made them to bring to my boyfriend's parents house for the holidays, and cried actual tears when I came home after work to find that the dogs had gotten ON TO the stove, knocked the tupperware holding them to the ground, and eaten every last one! These were the best cookies of the season, even if I only got to eat 2 fresh from the oven. I did change things, though. I used the dough exactly as stated, and as other reviewers said you need to work FAST, it wants to get sticky on you. For the filling, I used craisins, pecans, and a mixture of fig and raspberry preserves. Yummm.

Very, very good! And worth the effort. I used my KitchenAid mixmaster and refrigerated the dough 2 days before forming and baking it. I skipped the granulated white sugar in the filling and would do so again. They are sweet enough without it. Also I added a beaten egg to the milk that I brushed on top. While rolling up the rugelah, I thought the walnuts should have been chopped more finely. But in the end, they stayed in just fine in the finished product and did not fall out.

I have made these for many years for Christmas and are always a hit. I want to share with you 2 helpful hints. The best way to roll these is roll each ball between parchment paper (NOT WAX) that has been lightly dusted with flour. I do this when I am done making the dough. It rolls into a perfect circle ,the I layer each parchment set on top of each other on a plate & wrap well & refrigerate over night. The next day, work with one at a time, leaving the rest in the frig. Lift the dough from the paper before cutting. It helps lessen any sticking. You can quickly fill, cut, & roll them. They will be easy to work with by the time you have filled them. The dough won't stick, & the rolling is so easy this way. Hint #2 - These are great to make & freeze. Bake when needed. Make a week or so before you need them & bake the day of. So delicious fresh!!

Thanks ManhattanCook05, Your advice is sound. Lowered the temp in my home to 58 degrees and it did make a big difference. Was also easier to roll out. Have a great Holiday.

did my previous comments work? This is scrumptious but elaborate ... 24 hours for 3 dozen cookies. Definitely once a year. Tips 1) Pick a dry day. Very hydrophilic dough, has to chill constantly not to get cold but to get dry. 2) use the full measure of flour. I shorted it because I didn't sift, and I think that was a mistake. 2.5) don't use a food processor; this nearly broke my electric hand mixer as it was. 3) roll out after sectioning and before chilling; I tried freezer bags, but I think wax paper might be better 4) def. use pizza cutter and parchment paper. 5) roll as rectangles -- if you want crescents, go for 8 cookies per round sted 12. 6) if you're not in an air-conditioned environment, you have maybe two minutes to fill and roll the rounds before the dough turns, as one cook put it, "to frosting." Shove it into the freezer if you need to for it to recover.

Tastes fantastic but really difficult. I think the split between posters on this board as to whether this is easy or tough is that the secret ingredient is central air conditioning. This is a very hydrophilic dough that turns to "frosting"-- as one cook put it -- in about 120 seconds. To get it to recover, it needs to chill -- not only to get cold but to get dry again. I chilled the dough overnight, only to shove it in and out of the freezer as I filled it. In the 24 hours it took me to make 3 dozen cookies I could have made an extremely elaborate cake. That said, these are scrumptious. Tips: I shorted the flour to make up for not sifting it, and I would simply dump it in to full measure, unsifted, next time. I rolled the dough out in rounds in freezer bags before chilling overnight, as one poster suggested, band I'd do that again, but would try wax paper next time. Rectangles are definitely easier than crescents, but if you want classic crescents, go for 8 out of a round instead of 12. Most importantly, pick as cold and dry a day as you can to make these.

I would not recommend using the food processor method. I thought mine would die trying to blend the thick dough. If I make these again, I will use my electic mixer.

I love these cookies - my favorite out of the many varieties I make at Christmas - the cream cheese dough and the apricot preserves take these right over the top

Rating: 4
Looked at many recipes, and went with an old favorite, Lora Brody. The dough came out extremely well, with no problems. It definitely needs to chill. I played around with the fillings a bit and ended up using a variety of different things, but this basic filling was one of them and was terrific. I even got a seal of approval from the Jewish grandmother at the party where I served them.

All went well until they lost their shape while baking. I did chill them for 3o minutes, like the recipe called for, but they still flattened out and looked yucky when they came out of the oven.

Rating: 4
Very tasty and pretty easy. I found for my second batch of dough, it was a good idea to use a 9" cake pan as a template to make a "perfect" round, trimming off excess dough. It was much easier to get nice looking cookies. (I am not the best at rolling out the even round shape.) Parchment is the only way to go here. Without it, my cookies sheets would have been a mess.

This is one of the best recipes that I have in my toolbox! It is prefect as is, but I use dried apricots instead of raisins most of the times that I make them. Creamy flaky crust and chewy tasty insides! Yum.

I made the mistake of making these for my husband's relatives one year, and now I'm required to bring my Jewish cookies to his family's Christmas celebrations. I've experimented with several rugelach recipes over the years and this dough is the best I've tried. It's also the hardest with which to work. Set aside plenty of time for these cookies -- they always take longer than you think they will -- especially if you factor in the chilling time, which is essential for cookies that won't flatten when you bake them. I almost always roll the disks out between two sheet of plastic wrap. I then place the disks in the freezer for several minutes. Once you add the preserves and filling, the dough will be just the right rolling consistency. Place in freezer if it gets too soft. Maybe I'm anal retentive, but I've learned by trial and error that shape and dimensions make a big difference for pretty cookies. I now create a 9-inch round template and cut off any scraps to ensure a 9-inch round of dough. This eliminates any funny shapes and makes for easier rolling. In addition to the apricot filling, I substituted cherry preserves for the apricot and dried cherries for the raisins. I also broke down this year and made a few with a cherry-chocolate filling. The result is always delicious, but the amount of work makes rugelach once-a-year treat.

I have been making this recipe for years. I love it but I have one problem. I can't figure out how to keep the filling inside. Some always leaks out onto the cookie sheet.

one more thing... they taste better as they "age", as other posters have said. My sis (who hasnt touched anything w/ fat or sugar in it for the past 5 years) ate 8 of them!! She told me to never bake these again as they are too addicting. She ate the ones I baked with chocolate and walnuts, but I prefer the original. Like I said, they taste yummy after sitting out overnight.

Rating: 4
turned out great!! I used dark raisins instead of golden. I took another reviewers suggestion and didnt add any preserves/filling to the inner 2'' of the disks, this made them bake alot neater and cleaner and prevented oozing. I also placed the disks into 4 seperate gallon size freezer bags and rolled them out right away. I let them refridgerate for an hour and then simply cut around the bags and peeled off one side of the plastic, i left the bottom side on while I added the filling and cut&rolled.This really worked out for me as the plastic kept the dough cooler, and much easier to work with. I then refridgerated them for 40 minutes before baking(dont skip this step). My eastern european mom was so proud of me! Will make again!!

These were a hit; I`ve made Rugelach before and this is the best recipe !!!

Rating: 4
wow - this rugelach was absolutely delicious, just as good as the former 2nd ave deli in nyc! next time i'll experiment with different fillings. like the other reviewers said, this dough is best when rolled out between plastic wrap and parchment. i'm a fairly experienced pie maker, and was still surprised that the dough dissolves into the consistency of thick frosting when it's out of the fridge for 2-3mins. it softens up in a heartbeat so i am in awe of generations who had to roll this out without the benefit of modern conveniences. i skipped the crescent shaping and cut out the rugelach jelly-roll style as described in the other 'Rugelach" recipe on this site. my husband is already asking when we can bake up the rest of the recipe that i have frozen!

Rating: 2
I'm not sure I'd say this is "easy" like many reviewers wrote - easy if you're really good with soft pie crust and don't mind getting sticky. I used a Silpat liner and the rugelach, swimming in butter, floated all over the surface towards one another (the pan is not warped). Weird. Maybe I should have frozen them before baking. Also, little bits of burned preserves on the bottom. Not too impressive. Not impressed with Silpat either.

Rating: 4
These are so delicious! It was my first time to make rugelach, and initially, when they first came out of the oven, I was a bit disappointed in the flavor. But then my husband came home from work, and tried one about an hour later, and her raved! So I tried another one, and it was great. I noticed another reviewer said they were better after a while, so definitely let them cool off and "age" before eating. I found the dough easy to work with, after cooling the discs. My only problem, I didn't seem to have enough jam, so I ended up just using more, but usually Rose is so precise, it is unusual to have to adjust anything. I am taking these to a friend of mine today for Hannukah, hope he likes them as much as I do! Definitely a keeper recipe!

This is a great recipe. The dough is wonderful and you can make all kinds of changes to the filling. Just have everything ready to go when you bring the dough out of the fridge to roll it out. The fun things with the four disks is that you can do something different with each one. Add mini chocolate chips, cherry preserves and almonds, apricot preserves and macadamia nuts,or whatever is in your kitchen. Use a silpat or parchment paper as it can get sticky. Everyone you serve or give these to will love them. If you do not have the cookbook, find it. She has many great recipes. While they are wordy, you will find an answer to any problem. Good luck.

Rating: 4
These are much better than any I've bought. As the dough is soft, I don't usually shape it into crescents. I usually roll it into a rectangle between 2 pieces of parchment or wrap, sprinkle with filling, roll it up into a long roll, then cut into 1+ inch thick slices. It is also good with the dough spread with apple flavored pancake syrup, sugar, and walnuts. The dough can be kept in the fridge or freezer and then rolled out quickly.

Great recipe. I made this for my Eastern European mother-in-law and she loved it, so it must be legit. The second time I made them, I used non-fat cream cheese and low-fat butter and liked the result even better because it was less greasy and didn't leave a cream cheese aftertaste. I'm also been playing with the filling. I made a mix of rasberry jam and chopped walnuts - delish!

These cookies melt in your mouth! They are so buttery and delicious. Everyone loved them, and they'll be a standard feature in our home every Hanukkah. Thanks to the cook who suggested rolling the dough into disks before refrigerating. That was helpful, as the dough is VERY soft. I also found that not spreading the preserves or sprinkling the filling over the inner 2" of the dough round made them easier to roll and less likely to ooze unattractively.

I found this recipe a lot af work and when I finally finished, I gave one a taste and was a bit dissapointed. They were good but not fantastic as the reviews I read about this recipe said. I will make this recipe again but adjust it a bit, the dough was not so flavorful and the preserves ozzed out while baking and turned black, so I had to pick off the black bits of each one. It was still tasted good but not wonderful, sorry.

This recipe is time consuming but absolutely delicious- well worth the effort. One thing- if have a a kitchen that tends to heat up when the oven's on, be very careful with the dough- it gets soft within seconds. I actually had to clear space in my fridge and work on the shelf in there instead of on the counter because the dough was getting so soft! I highly recommend following the advice of the cook who suggested rolling the dough out between two pieces of wax paper before sticking it in the refrigerator. Also, rolling each crescent was rather time consuming- the next time around I'll try following the baking instructions of the recipe on this site simply entitle "rugelach," which says to roll the dough into a rectangle, fill it, roll it up into a log and bake it- then cut the rugelach when they've baked. This seems less involved. I would still follow this recipe, however, as it tastes wonderful.

WOW! These were a big hit with all of my guests over the holidays. They are a bit of work but well worth it. In my first batch I forgot the last step of brushing with milk and sprinkling with cinnamon sugar. Even these were fantastic. I actually prefered them because they were a little less sweet.

This recipe looked really painstaking the first time I read and attempted it, but it gets easier the next couple of times. A tip to help cut time and make the dough easier to handle - use wax paper. When I gather up the ball of dough and divide into four, instead of refrigerating each ball as-is, I immediately roll them out into the 9-inch disks between two sheets of wax paper. I dust the disks with a bit of flour and it doesn't stick at all. The benefit of rolling out before refrigerating is that it doesn't take as long to become firm, and it won't crack when you have to roll it out. Also, there's a LOT less mess to clean up. After about 1/2 an hour I take each disk out of the fridge, remove the top layer of wax paper, spread the filling directly on the dough, and then cut. Once all the is done, the dough is usually the perfect temperature to do all the rolling. I then stick the rugelach back in the fridge for about 10 minutes before baking. Comes out perfect every time!

I love Rugelach and had a great recipe for them which I lost so I thought I'd try this one for christmas baking. I was thoroughly dissappointed. I tried to halve the recipe, which was perhaps the problem. The dough was extremely sticky and a pain to work with, when baked it was flat and hard. The filling was impossible to keep within the rolls, most oozed out onto the baking sheet.

The dough is a dream to work with---I used the food processor! I accidentally mixed the apricot preserves into the rest of the filling ingredients, but they still came out great. I appreciate the fact that you can make the filling and dough in advance! These are both delicious and festive!

These are amazing! Though the instructions seem lenghty and perhaps a bit intimidating these are worth the labor that goes into them! I used half of the filling suggested here and filled the other half with the nut/cinnamon/sugar mixture and dried cherries and morello cherry jam. Both were a hit! The pastry is tender and the filling as authentic as any rugelach I have ever tasted. I definitely recommend the plastic wrap rolling method, as well as the use of parchment or a Silpat in baking. I froze mine before baking and they still came out perfectly. Being able to make ahead and freeze makes holiday baking a little easier:-) Thank you for the tips from other bakers! Enjoy!

Never made rugelach before and really had fun making them as well as trying something new. Recommend waiting a few hours or day after to enjoy as the flavor seemed to get even better the day after. Think I'll try raspberry next time (am not a huge fan of apricot).

I agree with the other reviewers and Rose B. This is the best rugelach I have ever eaten and I wouldn't want to change a thing. I did have some problem with the soft dough but followed other reviewers solutions and that helped tremendously. Thanks for a great recipe and thoughful reviews from considerate bakers.

I've had requests to make these again and you bet I'll be making these again for the holidays.. they are incredibly delicious!!

My first attempt at rugelach and everyone that tried it was hooked. I don't care for apricots, so I substituted cherry preserves (Polaner All Fruit was a good brand choice) and it gave the rugelach a wonderful flavor. Will definitely be making this again for my holiday cookie trays.

If you haven't tried this - absolutely do so!! I've made this for years, and it is one of the most requested ones. (My manager gets her own batch.) I've found that chilling each disk works best. Also I roll my disks between sheets of parchment paper with just a bit of flour added. Sometimes after rolling, I'll return to fridge before cutting. Then absolutely make sure you refrigerate again before baking. I make over 140 DOZEN cookies each Christmas (big family) and will sometimes make these in advance when the kitchen is cooler and then freeze them. You don't have to defrost, and if you are baking a lot of other cookies, it can go into the oven while you are mixing another batch. I orignally got this recipe from the Rose's Christmas cookie book. I've made most of the cookies from it and they are all outstanding.

I loved these cookies! For the filling, I used chopped fresh cranberries, almonds, and orange peel--my family finished off the first batch in ten minutes. Very light and flaky, but definitely had to keep dough refrigerated or it got too sticky.

Unbelievably good -- the best cookies on this planet! I tasted the ones at Whole Foods, and they can't hold a candle. I like to use all organic ingredients so that I don't feel guilty when I eat all of them! Don't change a thing about this recipe because it is as good as it gets.

Yummy! The only problem I had was getting the dough to stick together. 2 cups of sifted flour did not seem like enough. I made the dough in a food processor and there is no way I would have been able to roll out the dough if I hadn't added more flour. I had to add A LOT of extra flour to get the dough to stick. I ended up not rolling the dough out until two days later with no problems. I used my new Slipat for baking and they worked great. Will definately make these again. The taste was exceptional.

These are great! I've never made rugelach before, so I studied this recipe carefully before I made it. First of all, of course, you have to use heavy duty aluminum foil to line your sheet with. I'm sure a previous reviewer did not. Also, I am not very patient with dough that is difficult to handle, so I kept it cold whenever possible. I rolled it out very qiickly while cold, & put each "disc" back in the fridge while I rolled out the next. This method worked very well for me. The result was great! Very flakey,elegant & the filling perfect! I made them Christmas day & they were devoured right off the cooling rack by family & friends who just stopped by. This is now a perminant part of my "cookie box". I'm anxious to try other fillings!

The rugelach was delicious. I was surprised how easy these were to make. Parchment on the baking sheet was a huge help. I rolled the chilled dough on a floured board with a floured rolling pin and had no trouble.

Made these last week and have a second batch of dough chilling in the fridge right now to give away. I made half the recipe with a cranberry-walnut-butter mixture (from the Polish Rugelach recipe on this site), which was nice. The other half I spread with cherry preserves, then topped with chopped dried cranberries, walnuts, cinnamon and a little bit of finely chopped white chocolate. It was fantastic! I'm going to do the whole batch that way this time.

This recipe for Rugelach is far better than any other I have tried. I have made it several different ways, 1. ommitted the apricot preserves nd rolled the dough in a jelly roll shape and found it easier to work with. 2. I ommitted the cinnamon and raisins and used mini chocolate chips and they were fabulous. I roll the dough, place in freezer and when I want to have dessert for myself or company I just place on cookie sheet frozen and bake about 24-26 minutes, til golden. Delicious.

This is the best rugelach recipe ever! Very little sticking if you flour both the board and the rolling pin. I had a lot of trouble with the dough "melting" until I realized that I should keep my over-counter lights off when rolling this out!

I have made both this recipe and the Cho.chip/Cherry from this site. They are both super as is but I think that the crust from the other recipe is better because it is easier to work with and looks better when done. I did use the other crust with this filling and it was great. I also made them a bit bigger, cut in tenths, and this helped with the rolling and presentation. Either way, with four balls of dough, they would be good with any filling! Enjoy!

We made 5 of the 6 rugelach recipes on this site, and this one was the clear favorite among the guests. The dough is on the softer side, so definitely use the plastic wrap method for rolling. Also increase the baking time somewhat.

These were amazing. They taste just like I remember from my favorite Long Island bakery! I've been trying a number of recipes for rulelach, but these were by far the best. The dough was much easier to work with when I took it directly from the fridge without letting it sit for 15 min. Everyone who ate them asked for the recipe.

I used to work as a professional pastry chef, and this is the best rugelach recipe I have even made. The key is to keep the dough cold, maybe put on a sweater and open the kitchen window! Tastes like grandma's rugelach, if grandma was an incredible baker.

Dangerously delicious! I didn't have apricot preserves on hand, so I used Polaner seedless raspberry, which I suspect might be preferable anyway. Also, using the same sugar/cinnamon base, I altered the filling by making one with dark raisins & walnuts, one with chocolate chips and pecans. I'll have to eat several dozen more of each before I can tell you which one is best.

Very tender and tasty and not too difficult to make. Definitely use parchment paper on the cookie sheets as the preserves will leak and make a mess without it. The dough is not hard to roll but the window where its the right temperature is small - once the four disks are softened, put the ones you're not working on back in the fridge or they'll be too soft to roll once you get to them.
