Served this with Chicken Tikka & Spicy Indian Orzo. It was perfect to cut the heat from the orzo dish. I sprinkled the cut cucumber with salt & let it drain in a colander for about a half of an hour before adding it to the other ingredients.

Perfect. Made with the chicken tikka and mango chutney from this site

If you are going to grate the cucumber, remember to squeeze out the excess water before adding it to the yogurt mixture. You can also used chopped tomato and onion for a different raita variety.

A variation on this recipe being the use of coriander leaves instead of mint, with 1/2 tsp roasted cumin seeds (powdered)and 1/4 tsp cumin/coriander. Equally delicious is a radish raita! Use a grater!
