Good stuff and easy! Granted it was tart but in a good way. I measured my sugars generously and used the apples I had on hand which were a bit sweeter than grannies

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I left out the orange zest but it tasted great without it, so I don't think I'll bother when I make this again -- which will be soon!

Super easy and delicious--not to mention a great use for extra cranberries during the hoidays. I didn't bother with mixing the apples & cranberries in a separate bowl and tossed them instead in the pie plate. I also added extra apple to compensate for the cranberry's tartness, and didn't find the recipe to be too tart as other reviewers have. I found it a bit strange to bake/serve this in a pie plate and next time would probably just use a square pan.

I only had 1/3 of the cranberries so I doubled the apples and added a dash of orange flower water. Delicious.

Made this for Christmas and got rave reviews. Can't wait to try it with other fruits. Will definitely make again.

This truly is a very easy cake. I'd call this a cross between a cobbler and "cheater pie". My husband thought the cranberries were a bit tart. I didn't think so. So, adjust according to your sensitivity to tartness. I actually used three Granny Smith apples. I didn't think the orange was overpowering at all. In fact, I think cranberries and orange go well together. I used a little boiled apple cider (I special order this) to bring out the flavor of the apple. Adding some baker's coarse granulated sugar gives the topping a wonderful crust. I fully intend to make this again, with different versions-- all apples, berries and even fresh peaches. This is a perfect "go to" recipe for a quick fruit dessert. Vanilla bean ice cream is perfect with this.

I made this for after-church cake/coffee this past Sunday and it got rave reviews.

True "Cold Weather Cooking"! It's warm, comforting and the flavors are perfect for the winter. I think it is quite sweet enough; if you need something more, don't add sugar, but pair is with a good whipped cream or ice cream.

Absolutely fantastic cake, yes the cranberries are tart but I tend to like a bit more tart desserts that taste fresher than say if you had used super sweet store bought pie filling. My husband liked it so much I had to make it again within a week! Also, I used a 9 in square non stick dish and it came out perfectly.

I made this dessert as written and it came out perfectly. I wouldn't change a thing. It's fairly straight forward, but don't confuse easy with quick. It takes some time and a several bowls (melted butter, zested and juiced orange, electric mixer) to pull this off. But I HIGHLY recommend it. This is a keeper for sure.

I thought the amount of cranberries made it too tart - and I love cranberries. I would reduce them if I ever made it again. Might also add pear like another reviewer suggested. The cake part was great, so this would be worth another try ONLY WITH tweaking the filling.

I made this for the office on my birthday. It was simply wonderful! The cake was completely devoured 10 minutes after I had set it in the kitchen. All my colleagues LOVED it.

although I don't think this is a particularly "easy" cake (rustic and simple, but still at least 3 bowels, zesting orange, juicing orange, electric mixer, etc.), it turned out better than I was expecting, even with the positive reviews. I was concerned that the cranberries would overwhelm, and also that there would be too much for my 9.5" pyrex pie plate, so I used 9oz cranberries and 1 large pear for the filling. Otherwise as written and it was very good.

I made this for Thanksgiving for a new Twist on Dessert and Cranberries. (I also made the usual Pecan Pie into Pecan Bars...another success)FABULOUSLY easy and delicious. My "mother-in-law" wanted the recipe need I say more!! This is a keeper. Next time, I may (for sure) will add toasted nuts, probably pecans.

This cake was easy and tastes great. I was concerned it might be too tart, so I used about 3/4 of a bag of cranberries and 2 apples and it was just the right combination of sweet and tart. I was a little worried, because I thought the batter needed to be a little less dense to flow down around the fruit, but it actually worked out just fine. Would definitely make it again for a fall dessert.

i did not like the orange rind it overpower all the other flavors

This was easy, and while I enjoy desserts that aren't overly sweet, I thought the cranberries were just a little too much. Next time, I'd reduce to 9 oz instead of a whole bag. And the fruit and batter completely filled my pie plate, but didn't overspill except for a drop. I did have to cooke it for an extra 10 minutes. Definitely serve with vanilla ice cream or yogurt to help offset the tart dessert.

Great cake, made with honey crisp apples and served it warm with salted caramel ice cream. Delicious!

I liked the cake, and I liked the apples, but the cranberries were wayyyyy tooooo tart for me. If I make this again, I won't use fresh cranberries--perhaps diced fresh apples and/or pears with a few dried cranberries. Cake did not keep well.

I am not much of a dessert lover, but this recipe is WOW!!! My family loved it and it's easy so I will certainly make this again.

This was great for my last-minute dinner party. Easy, really yummy and I had all the ingredients on hand (I used a different type of apple, which was fine). I also plan to use this recipe as a base for other fruits - peaches or berries in the summer.

Do you have any tips for making this as individual cakes?

I must admit, that after meeting Ina for the second time at a book signing, I was totally determined to review one of her new recipes without waiting for someone else to review it first, and wanted one that would be seasonally appropriate as well. Hooray! This cake was absolutely everything she said it would be, and then some. My friends and family loved this, and it was incredibly easy to assemble.

This was so good! I made it exactly as directed and served with vanilla ice cream which balanced the tartness perfectly. It was a big hit with our guests.
