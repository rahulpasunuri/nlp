More work than I'm used to but they are awesome. Made per the directions with fresh cranberries and find them to have plenty of cranberry flavor.

Great recipe and makes a lot, so it's a great thing to bring to a bake sale or holiday party! I've made these many times and every time people ask for the recipe.

I have made these since the Recipe first appeared in 2001. It is a fabulous treat to make & share. What I love about this recipe is that, it makes alot so i use it for all my parties & get together. It also freezes very well without the chocolate. I'm not a huge chocolate fan so I dont miss it. I make these at Thanksgiving & freeze the rest until Christmas. I make this every year to raved reviews!!!!!

This is my tenth anniversary of making these fantastic bars. My family thinks it would not be Thanksgiving without them. I agree with other reviewers--you need to follow the directions carefully and use the right size pan for the shortbread crust. I also once threw away a crust and started again because I didn't like the way it turned out. The bars are totally worth it. I use a very good quality chocolate for the drizzle and I double the amount called for.

I've used this recipe since it was published! And, these Cranberry Turtle Bars are still the ultimate holiday or specialty dessert bar, always the hit of the event. For some who've mentioned using more cranberries for flavor, I've added dried cranberries to increase the flavor. For those who've said the crust is too thin or "wimpy," I always combine in the food processor until it forms "lumps," which you would think is much longer than needed, but it works. As well, the size of the pan is absolutely correct, any larger and your crust is too thin. I just made the bars for a Valentine's Day luncheon at work and they're asking for the recipe!

I continue to make this recipe each year. I have also made variations with macademia nuts and a white chocolate drizzle. Always a hit with friends and family!

Love this recipe. It's a standard on our christmas baking list. Also, I leave off the chocolate. I think it's extraneous... My tips: 1) use a whole bag of cranberries, don't bother chopping them. it's not worth the effort. 2) I like to use 1 1/2 times the recipe for the base. It gives it more substance and provides a better balance for the cranberry topping. 3) I tend to slightly overmeasure the nuts. I love pecans. For me, more is better. 4) Dont' bother with the chocolate. It's not worth the effort.

My brain must be have been fried by the sugar+butter overload from these. Obviously, it should say "the means justify the end."

Rating: 1
Sorry to be a party pooper but these did not work for me at all. I have nothing against rich deserts as long as the end justifies the means, and for all the butter and sugar you get great flavor. Here, what I got was all butter and sugar and nothing else. It is too sweet, even with the whole bag of cranberries. And there's a butter overload. My husband asked whether the main ingredient was all butter and with 3.5 sticks butter, all I could I say was yes, pretty much all butter. The cranberries completely lost their tartness and freshness in the cloying surroundings. The caramel flavor did not come through at all for me (maybe it needed to cook longer). Also, 3 cups of pecans seemed excessive to me. I put in about 1.5 and still found it overpowering (and I love nuts!). I will not repeat these.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! Everyone loves these. A few steps to save time: use a whole bag of cranberries (ocean spray), leave them whole (no need to chop). Buy pre-chopped pecans in bulk. These are delicious - I'v been making them for 4 years at Chistmas. Now, I face expulsion from the family if I threaten to skip them for a season...

Pretty good. I would recommend not overtoasting the nuts as they seemed to overwhelm the cookies.

A big hit with my friends and co-workers! I was craving something with cranberries during the holidays and this was the perfect treat. Very easy to make!

Really very tasty, I liked the tartness of the berries. I used maybe an extra cup of them and definitely used extra chocolate. Makes a ton so very good for parties.

i have to say, these were a disappointment- though I think te have great potential. Next time I will increase the Cranberries but a good share...as written the recipe is way too sweet. The cranberries, while pretty , doesn't give the tang they need to stand up to the chocolate, caramel and shortbread. I am considering finding a way way to put a cranberry glaze or something over the top to bring out their full potential. With this many pecans it would be an expensive d-over.

I have been making this recipe since it first was published. Some advantages to this are no eggs, so for allergy sufferers and vegetarians this is a plus. Also, for any people with tree allergies you can use peanuts instead. I make a triple batch in early December and take them to all my parties. They always get great reviews.

Rating: 4
I too have been making this since it was first published and it ALWAYS gets rave reviews. I follow the recipe almost to a T, but do a few things that I think make the recipe easier/quicker to make without any sacrifice. First of all, I am not a huge fan of toasted nuts, I prefer them plain, so I do not toast (I've toasted them for this recipe, and do not notice one bit of difference). Also, I use an entire package (just the standard Ocean Spray package size) of cranberries (fresh) and do not chop them or anything, just rinse them and throw them in whole, the heat of the carmel breaks them down nicely, you needn't bother with chopping. The chocolate drizzle is very elegant, but for xmas it's fun to use white chocolate drizzle just to mix it up and make it look like snow! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these!

I made these for thanksgiving and they were a huge hit!! Since everyone loved them so much and they were so easy to make i decided to make them again for new years! Unfortunately i couldnt find any frozen or fresh cranberries!! I substituted the cranberries for a pack of frozen cherries approx 10 ounces-pulsed in the food processed. They came out great- more rave reviews!! They're sweeter than the cranberry ones, but still tasted great with chocolate and white chocolate drizzle. Very important note- make sure to bring the temperature back up to 245degrees. It takes a bit longer because of the high water content but if you dont it comes out too juicy and runny.

These were very good. I used only half the pecans called for (more than enough for my taste), and double the chocolate (again, a taste preference). Gave them out at church for Christmas presents, and they were very well received.

These are fabulous, sweet and tart! I have made them since the recipe was published in 2001. It is important to use the correct size pan or the crust will be either too thin or too thick. Everyone loves them and I always get great reviews and lots of requests for the recipe.

These were delicious!! The crust was a lovely crisp shortbread like cookie; and the tartness of the cranberry topping was a great combination with the sweetness of the caramel turtle. Loved them. I used a square cookie cutter for easier cutting.

These were good and pretty straightforward to make. They were very rich, though. I don't plan to make again because they weren't to my or my husband's taste. However, a lot of people I served them to really liked them.

The first time I made this I was at someone else's home and using an inferior range. It did not come out looking very pretty at all and I almost threw it away without tasting. My husband cut a little piece before I did so and thought it was quite good and worth another try. So, I made it at home for about 50 guests and was very happy with the results. In fact, I am going to make some more today for Thanksgiving. I made the recipe as written, however, I did not serve it with the chocolate because I think it took away from the wonderful cranberry flavor. I realize that it cannot be called 'turtle' without the chocolate, but I think it is really the way to eat these. I am sure it will become a holiday staple for us.

I've been making these since the recipe was published in Dec. 2001. I pretty much follow this recipe to the t, except for a few minor changes/suggestions. I use 2 cups of cranberries and I don't chop them, I use them whole (I've used both fresh and frozen and both turn out great!). For the reviewer before who said she makes the crust sturdier by making 1 1/2 the crust, I've done it both ways, and I prefer as the recipe states, it will look pretty thin, but the topping holds it together and when the crust is thicker it makes them too heavy for my liking.

Rating: 4
awesome recipe- I make them all the time and now bring 2-3 recipes with me as people ALWAYS ask for it. I do have a couple of suggestions. I always make 1 1/2 the crust recipe as this makes them sturdier. I also add 3/4 cup of finely chopped cranberries just before I pour onto the crust. It adds a bit of tartness and color. The first time I made them I already had too much chocolate on the cookie platter so now I always use white chocolate (double the amount). For valentines day I tinted the chocolate pink. Delish

These are definitely a wonderful addition to my list of holiday cookie recipes. I didn't have the bar chocolate so I made a bittersweet ganache out of dry and they were fabulous. Everyone loves these!

I Love this recipe, I made it the first season it appeared in Gourmet. I elected not to use the chocolate and it is fabulous. Everywhere I take it people want the recipe. Keep in mind that it is a large recipe and you can make the whole recipe now and freeze half for a holiday party or for X-mas. It freezes and defrosts really well.

I made these bars for the holidays last year and was just thinking about making them again soon! They are fairly easy to make and quite impressive--super for the holidays . I have also drizzled white chocolate on these too, gives them a bit of a different look. If you have to bring a dessert over the holidays, these will get you kudos!

These were great, even if they were a little sweet. I omitted the chocolate since many in my family don't like it, and the results did not suffer. I had to give them away quickly for fear I'd eat the whole tray! Everyone who tried them asked for the recipe.

I have made these three times now and they have received rave reviews every time. I can't have them around the house because they are the one thing I just can't resist! The last time I made them I wasn't paying attention and the temp got up to 350 - thought I had messed the whole thing up, but added the cranberries anyway and it all worked out fine. Do not miss this one!

I thought these were delicious. I too did not chop the cranberries and I just used the whole bag of fresh ones (Ocean Spray). I had trouble getting the mixture to come back up to 145 degrees after adding the cranberries, I finally gave up at about 130 degrees, and it was fine.

Highly recommended. I used 2 c cranberries (not chopped) as recommended and skipped the chocolate--they were plenty sweet without.

To the Boston reviewer: a few quick pulses in the food processor is by far the easiest way to chop either fresh or frozen cranberries.

Absolutely to die for. This is one of the better Christmas cookie recipes I've tried in a while. Sweet, tart and buttery all at once. I didn't chop the cranberries either. The cranberries I had on hand were frozen which made the caramel mixture sieze up when they were first added. It will melt down but takes a while. So if you're using frozen cranberries I would really recommend using the candy thermometer as it will take more time for the caramel to come back up to temperature with frozen cranberries than with fresh. I used a 3 oz. flat bar of Scharffenberger bittersweet chocolate; that was enough chocolate for the top and bitter enough to cut some of the sweetness of the caramel. This was one of those cookies that everyone kept coming back to nibble on. Definitely a keeper for this family.

I made this recipe for thanksgiving, and everybody wanted more. I made more, and put in more cranberries because everybody liked the tangy flavor (a rounded 2 cups). I did not chop the cranberries because I forgot. It turned out fine because the cranberries popped by themselves. The chocolate makes it very sweet and rich, so I put very little on the cookies. So far it is everybody's favorite.

My mother-in-law liked these better than I did, but for that alone. I'll make them again! Note to the previous reviewer: I didn't chop my cranberries and the mixture came out fine. The berries burst as they cook, and I didn't notice a sacrifice in flavor.

I made these for a christmas party and received many complements, and they look festive as well. I did follow the other readers advice and used more chocolate (around 6 oz.). I also used a 9x13 cake pan which worked fine.

Great recipe - I appreciated the feedback on using more cranberries and less sugar. Anyone have an easy way to coarse chop fresh cranberries? I recommend melting the chocolate by putting it into a small ziplock bag and putting the bag in warm water. Saves a step and comes out fine.

I made these bars last night for a large group and everybody raved about them, many wanting the recipe. I did use more cranberries than called for and also extra chocolate. After cuttining up the bars I put them in the refrigerator for about an hour to see if they would set a little firmer and they did. Definitely a great holiday buffet dessert for a crowd.

These jumped at me from my November issue of Gourmet. I thought they looked lovely in the photo. They were eay to make, and turned out beautifully. I loved the cranberry, dark chocolate, pecan combination and so did everyone I passed them out to. I've already passed this recipe along. The crust was melt in your mouth. I would recommend using 4oz. of dark chocolate - 2oz. just wasn't enough!

I made this recipe on a whim the day before Thanksgiving. It was easy and everyone loved it! I think it is going to be a new family tradition. One word of advice, though--eat them quickly. They did seem to get soggy by the third day (the recipe makes more than we can eat in two days). I may experiment with a hard caramel layer between the base and the topping--also, we added a bit mor chocolate than the recipe called for.

It's definitely too sweet... I'm going to try it the next time without the chocolate and with less sugar.... a great holiday dessert in terms of overall look and taste but needs work.

Rating: 2
This recipe as is is too sweet...and I believe the acid from the cranberries causes the caramel to be loose rather than set-up. Ill make again, using same measurements except will add more cranberries to offset the sweet. I also think it needs a thicker bottom crust, so will probably beef that up too. Stay tuned for Episode Two! Linda in Albuquerque

To qualify why I rated this so low--My batch was scortched and yet I used a candy thermometer. I have made candy many times so I don't know what happened. The scortched version seemed like it could have been good?????

This recipe would probably play to rave reviews for those who like very sweet desserts. I liked the recipe when I read it, but not when I tasted it. It was way too sweet for my palate. I was hoping that the cranberries would give this butter rich recipe a tart taste. What it does deliver is a sweet rich bar that I'm sure many would enjoy, but I'm not one of those people. This recipe is rather easy to put together and should definitily be tried for those who favor a dessert that will fill that sweet tooth for the Thanksgiving holiday.
