I substituted 1/4 c almond flour for 1/4 of the wheat flour and also added a splash of almond extract. Also substituted chocolate bits instead of blueberries (which are out of season at the moment). All in all, a nice recipe!

Good recipe. The buckwheat flour makes these pancakes wonderfully filling. I added a bit more sugar as other reviewers suggested and loved how they turned out. No batter texture problems... letting the mixture sit the 5 minutes was key. Delicious with saskatoon berry syrup. I froze the left overs and plan on heating in the toaster on crazy mornings.

Good as written, but I liked it better the second time I made it: substituted buttermilk for the milk and added an extra T of sugar. With these substitutions, the pancakes are very light and tender--- I bet they'd stand up to sub'ing whole wheat flour for the all-purpose without turning into bricks.

I substituted mixed frozen fruit that were microwaved and chopped slightly to smaller pieces. I also only used 3/4 cup of fruit vs 1.5 cups. Very nice! The buckwheat and fruit really complement each other.

Very good, easy.Increased recipe 50% and still only made 17 3-4" pancakes--will double next time. Used buttermilk in place of milk, added 1 ripe banana and 1 t. vanilla. Did not add blueberries.

Pancakes themselves were yummy (especially with the blueberries!), but the batter was quite runny which resulted in pancakes that were more crepe-like in appearance, not the thick, puffy pancakes I've come to love. I will definitely be looking for a different buckwheat recipie in the future.

This is a good simple pancake recipe, but it was waaaay too salty for me. I'll cut out the salt next time. Still yummy, just needs a little tweaking.

I just mixed by hand instead of using the food processer, and used melted butter. They came out great!

My family loved these. I was a little less enthused. They were good, just not great. It may have been my buckwheat flour-it was a little old.

This was great. I needed a little more milk than the recipe called for to give them a nice moist consistancy.

I used buttermilk which was great. Will definitely make this again.
