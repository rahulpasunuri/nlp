This cake turned out really well with a few substitutions. I used a parve semisweet chocolate and reduced the sugar slightly. Instead of non-dairy creamer, I substituted coconut milk creamer ("So Delicious" makes a parve shelf-stable version). It worked really well. Also, I found that trying to add sugar to the beaten egg whites kept turning them into soup. So I beat just the egg whites separately and mixed the full cup of sugar in with the yolks, oil and creamer. After adding the dry ingredients, I folded only the egg whites into the mixture and it worked fine. I left the frosting in the refrigerator for several hours (stirring occasionally) and it thickened well enough to spread. I used pasteurized eggs for the frosting which may have helped (they tend to be a bit thicker in consistency and there's no worries about undercooked eggs). All in all, it was a big hit.

I just made this cake tonight. It tastes delicious, and it soft and moist, but my frosting never really thickened. I'm not sure what I did wrong. I had it in the fridge for hours and then in the freezer. It was more like a thick glaze than frosting. I was a little disappointed that my cake didn't look like the picture. (Came out much darker and fudgier looking)

Frustratingly, this recipe comes up in a search for dairy-free cakes. Note to Epicurious: "non-dairy" creamer contains sodium caseinate, a milk derivative. It is lactose-free, but is NOT a non-dairy product.

Wow, what an amazing Passover dessert. You would never know. A very rich decadent dessert for all chocolate lovers. The frosting was enough for two cakes, so I took it to both Passover sedars. I decorated the top with coconut and it was picture perfect!

My mother in law tore this recipe out of Bon Appetit back in 1996 and said, "make this." Eight Passovers later, I made it last year substituting whipped cream frosting for the chocolate frosting. It was excellent. This year I made it with the chocolate frosting and it was an equally big hit. It was less labor intensive than other flourless chocolate cakes. It also uses less eggs than other recipes I've tried. P.S. I added a teaspoon of cook's vanilla to the frosting after removing from the stove.

It's good to remember that this cake, like most Passover cakes, is a lot of hard work. Do try and prepare it as far ahead of time as possible. The cake itself is delicious. It's a little on the rich side and especially good for those who are fans of fudgy chocolate cakes, but no one believed it was kosher for Passover. It was that moist and soft.

I reduced this recipe and made cupcakes to try it out before Passover. I had no problem reducing the recipe. It is a very good cake. Very light and chocolatey. Very easy to make. If I make this again, I would probably add a little coffee for a richer flavor.

I needed to make a birthday cake for our first passover seder and thought this sounded moist, unlike most passover cakes. When I finished it I couldn't believe how short this 3 layer torte was after all the prep work. I took it to dinner and everyone loved it so much they went back for 2nd's and 3rd's. It was extrememly moist. It was a hit and a keeper.

This recipe didn't work at all for me, maybe because I doubled the recipe. Once I added the dry ingredients to the egg yolks the mixture turned into cement (and I don't think I beat more than just blending). Then, of course, I could't fold the beaten whites into the cement. Cutting the cake to make the layers was an annoying step -- why not just bake in smaller pans to make the layers? At serving time, the torte didn't slice but broke into little piles of chocolate crumbles. I must admit however that my guests insisted that the crumbles tasted great and the combination of fudge and cake pieces was good. On the whole, though, the results didn't justify the effort and next time I'll stick with a good flourless chocolate cake.

This was a really excellent recipe and I got rave reviews from all my guests. Definitely worth the trouble.

My husband gave this a 10 on a 1-10 scale, said it was the best Passover dessert he ever tasted. As someone whose birthday often falls during Passover, I've finally found a Passover cake that would be a great birthday cake too.

I turned this into a dairy dessert, substituting butter & half & half . It was delicious and intensely chocolate. I also cut it back to two-thirds, with two layers to make a family-sized dessert. Definitely a good dessert any time of year for chocolate lovers.

Passover followers rejoice - finally a chocolate recipe that can be used for Passover that tastes wonderful. I made it both Sedar nights and it won rave reviews. If you cannot find bittersweet chocolate for Passover for use in the frosting use semi-sweet and cut the sugar by 1/4 cup. It's a new family favorite.

This is one of our favorite Passover desserts, but you could make it for any time of the year, because it doesn't taste like a Passover dessert. It is fudgy and rich, and everyone, especially the kids, love it.
