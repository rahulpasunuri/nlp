As another reviewer pointed out, why haven't more people tried this and reviewed it? It's simply delicious and very quick and easy. I did as another suggested and used my Better Than Boullion (beef) and reduced it. I just love the BTBs. This is a winner for us! Served it with roasted acorn squash w/a little butter and agave and sauted spinach/garlic/butter, since that's what I had, and it was all delicious together.

i was thinking that perhaps people have been scared off of this recipe because of the meat glaze. i just used a jarred broth concentrate (better than bouillon) and instead of adding 1 cup of water to 1 tsp like you do to make a broth, i just added 1/4 cup of water to 1 tsp. worked fantastic!

So easy, so good. I mixed in some dried cherries.

I tried this last night....delicious! The only thing I would do differently is make a bit more sauce, double the liquid from the prunes and double the cream. I served it with baked squash and a salad.
