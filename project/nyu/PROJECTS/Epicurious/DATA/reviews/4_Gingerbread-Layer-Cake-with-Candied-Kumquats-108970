Made this with a few adjustments..... Added Rum to batter =) Used Dark Molasses (love that flavor) Candied the Kumquats, then pureed them into a gelle/coulis. Poured in-between each layer and will serve on plate beneath the cut piece of cake. Loved that the cake is not super sweet. Used traditional Cream Cheese Frosting after reading some of the reviews. Seems to have been a success.

I made this without the kumquats because a) I didn't have any and b) I didn't think it would need them. I found the cake to be fine by itself when first made but later became dry and the molasses flavor overly dominant. The frosting by itself was good, but I thought the frosting flavor did not go with the cake - it was a weird combo. I made this for Thanksgiving and over half the cake ended up in the trash by the end of the day - the store bought pumpkin pie was declared better by all who tried it. Won't make this again.

This is a really excellent cake but I skipped the whole kumquat thing as they are not available in this town and seemed like too much work. The ginger/pecan mixture more than made up for it as a topping.

i would make this for the frosting alone.... the only change - it is easier to slice if you chop the kumquats on top of the cake.

I have made this cake so many times Ive lost count  it is absolutely delicious. My husband and friends request it regularly. Now, I have never made the kumquat part (seems like too much to me)  I just make the rest of the cake, and make enough of the nut mixture to put some in the layers and all the way up the entire side of the cake. This cake is definitely time consuming and its best to make it the day or night before  but well worth it. Make sure you use parchment paper and grease your pans well to avoid sticking& and make sure your batter is in the pans nice and level so you dont get lopsided cakes, as another reviewer experienced.

Spectacular!! Very good recipe, I have been doing it often, and every time all the guests rave about this marvelous cake.

Maybe because of the cola (?), the cake layers were a very strange shape, quite uneven, and the whole thing was unbelievably time-consuming. Couldn't believe that after all that work, there were way more kumquats than needed. Most people weren't crazy about this, and the kids at the gathering avoided it like the plague. Those adults who did try it and like it thought it very sophisticated.

I made this for Christmas dinner last year and the cake was moist, delicious and beautiful. I'm making it again for Thanksgiving. I substituted green and red apples for kumquats and thought it delicious. I topped the cake with candied strips of apple peels and the cinnamon sticks. BEAUTIFUL.

Made this for Christmas and most people loved it.... but not everyone. I think this may be one of those things that either you love or you hate. Followed the recipe as printed, but used parchment paper and had no problems with the cake sticking to the pans. Also, I gave up trying to seed the kumquats (way too hard as they're so small) and used my thumb to press the kumquat flesh (which I later discarded) through the slices....ended up with lovely rings of candied kumquat peel. Btw, I think you could substitute orange peel if you can't find kumquats. Maybe the folks who didn't like it ("Oh, it tastes like fruitcake") just don't like candied fruits and would like the cake made without the kumquats. For me, tho, the citrus tang was a wonderful counterpoint to a sweet dessert and I thought it was a nice change from the usual chocolate overload at Christmas.

It's a bit over the top, and definitely tastes better the next day. Great gingerbread cake! I didn't have a problem sticking, because I used waxed paper, butter, and flour.

Delicious! I made this for Christmas & it was a huge hit with everyone. My mother-in-law said it is the best cake she has ever had. And my aunt who is on a diet & hadn't indulged in anything yet this season, had a slice & took one home. I used parchment rounds & cooking spray & had no problem with sticking. I skipped the kumquats due to time constraints. Perhaps I'll try them next time. I put chopped pecans in each layer & decorated with them & candied ginger on top. Also I didn't frost the sides; it was a beautiful cake! Yum!

What a WASTE of 4 hours. This cake took forever to make, admittedly looked beautiful, but was awful (to me). It turned out as it should, I suspect, but really was jsut a glorified fruitcake. The two out of the crowd of 12 whom I made it for who like fruitcake loved this cake, but the rest were fairly unimpressed, and I hated it.

The taste of this recipe is outstanding. I had one problem though - the cake seriously stuck to the pan. I had to remake them, and even with an abundance of shortening I still ended up piecing the remains of my second attempt together. I don't know if it's the heavy molasses-sugar content or what, but I recommend to others to place parchment paper at the bottom of the pan and grease that, just to be on the safe side.

Where can you find kumquats? Any recommendations for substitutes if I can't find them?

To Vidyan, My German mother in New Delhi used gur as a substitute for molasses. You were on the right track. I plan to make this when I'm in Delhi where we have several kumquat trees in our garden.

I am the manager of a bakery and I needed some new seasonal recipes, and this cake is now my favorite and all my customers favorite. The icing and the caramel drizzle were perfect. I made 3" individual layer cakes that sold out within hours. You have to try this.

This is my favorite holiday cake. I've made it several times in the past years to rave reviews. Several people have told me it's the best cake they have ever had. I'm not so into the cream cheese icing, so I've begun using a lemon curd instead, and I decorate the cake with crystalized ginger and walnuts. The gingerbread and lemon go together so nicely. There is an excellent recipe for lemond curd on this site as well.

I made this cake for a family celebration - I didn't use kumquats, and put the nut mixture over the entire side of the cake (not just half way up). It was a huge hit - and I couldn't stop eating it! If you like ginger, this recipe is definitely a treasure.

An excellent ending to an Indian meal. Everyone loved. Used 1 pint of Kumquats (about 16 oz.) and that was plenty. No need to spend more. Also, the price of vanilla beans is crazy, used 1/2 teaspoon in syrup after it had cooked down and it was fine.

For Vidyan from Singapore: some substitutes for molasses would include golden syrup; corn syrup; maple syrup; even thick honey would work. Treacle is in the same family - a by-product of sugar processing - but much stronger in flavor. I can't find plain ol' molasses here in the UK, so I use a mix of treacle with golden syrup, usually in a 1:3 ratio, sometimes 1:2, depending how strong the treacle seems and what the recipe calls for (i.e., dark molasses or light molasses). Hope this helps! p.s. I haven't made the cake yet, but will be within the week, so I'll post my findings in terms of my "molasses substitute."

Great recipe. They have something in Japan called Kuromitsu, which worked as a good substitute for molasses. I thought making gingerbread would be difficult, but it was so easy and tasted so good. I substituted apples for the kumquats. I lightly simmered the apples put them in the center and arranged the red and green apple skins that I peeled on the top to make it seem christmas-y. I would dial down the sugar in the frosting or maybe use confectioners sugar next time. Cake was perfect!

THIS WAS FABULOUS!!! The cake was moist and spicy, the frosting was a perfect complement, out of this world. I couldn't find mild molasses, so I used regular, and it was fine. I left out the kumquats. For garnish, I sifted cinnamon into a gingerbread cookie cutter to make a gingerbread man on top of the cake-I also piped some caramel cream rosettes around the edges. Everyone loved this at our Christmas lunch :) I can't wait to make this again!!!

this rocks! I had to whip up something in a hurry to take to a party, and made just the cake. it turned out just great. i substituted jaggery (gur) for molasses. i used 1/2 cup jaggery and 1.5 cups brown sugar. anyone got any ideas abt good substitute for molasses? i cant seem to get it all that easily out here.

This cake was absolutely delicious and my whole family loved it. I made the cake without the kumquats and it stood on it's own. The cake was moist and flavorful and the frosting was a dream. This will probably become a new tradition.

This was delicious. The kumquats were very time consuming, but their flavor for me just made the dessert. For some reason, the centers of my kumquats turned an unattractive color and fell out after they were candied, but I arranged the peels on top, and it was still very attractive and tasty. (Perhaps we don't get the best and freshes kumquats here in Alaska.) I served this with a choice of other showy and tasty desserts, but this was the favorite with all my guests. My husband is not a dessert person, and even he raved about it. I did have a little trouble with the icing; it seemed a bit warm to stick to the sides of the cake. Next time I would cool it until I felt confident it would stay put. But there will be a next time for sure.

It was very moist and delicious. Wouldn't make it with the kumquats again as it was too time consuming. A great holiday cake.

Everyone loves this cake! I made it twice, once with kumquats and once, without. I substituted candied ginger. Use more chrystalized ginger, in the middle layer, add ginger and walnuts and press all around up to the top. It was delicious. I also made only 2 layers a second time, otherwise you need a crowd. I also couldn't find light molasses, so substituted 1 cup (total)of honey with 1 tablespoon of blackstrap molasses. It worked well.

We all LOVED this cake!!!! I loved making it; my family loved eating it. I made it for Christmas Eve dinner, but I confess to leaving out the kumquats...nobody really missed them. I used walnuts for garnish on top and sides.

I couldn't find kumquats, so substituted dried cranberries. If you do use the dried cranberries, syou can kip the glaze part. Cake was moist and delicious. Frosting was oh-so-rich and yummy. I did not frost the sides sides, I just layered cake, frosting, cake, frosting, cake, frosting, and garnished with cranberries and chopped pecans. It was a beautiful presentation and a delicious tasting dessert. The cake stored very well and was just as delicious three days later.

The Kumquat mixture is a bit heavy. I would omit or use sparingly. Anyone have any other suggestions than the Kumquats?

Rating: 4
A delicious cake. Made it with only two rows of kumquats and some nuts on top and the chopped kumquat in the icing, because seeding the kumquats took an incredibly long time. The cake kept wonderfully, and the icing is a keeper for any spice cake. Didn't drizzle with all the syrup - I had too much - and also left off the side garnish. Other than the kumquats it was an easy recipe.
