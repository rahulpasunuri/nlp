This is a great recipe for any kind of ground poultry. It's become a standby at my house. And it's kid-friendly too!

It was great tasting and not too heavy. Really good use of ground turkey.

Also consult the recipe for Asian turkey wraps on this site. Simpler version, great with peanut sauce. Just maintain some of these additional herbs and vegetables if desired.

We thought it was bland and not much to work with in way of presenting.

Wow! Wow! Really great recipe. I also switched bamboo shoots for the pea pods. Everything else I kept the same. Served with sticky rice and sauteed sugar snap peas. A little time consuming, but well worth it. The cilantro was a great addition.

Wow-I was really surprised how well this turned out. The flavors in the turkey were outstanding. The "jade"--lettuce and herbs were wonderful accompaniments. I felt the recipe was a bit difficult to follow since so many of the ingredients were used twice, but the results were really fantastic.

Terrific dish!Followed another's advise and used hoisin instead of honey, and again on lettuce leaf with cooked mixture. It's a keeper!

OMG...this was great! I really made this recipe my own by making a few changes. Minced bamboo shoots in place of snow peas, supplied nice texture and also added more vegetable, replaced honey with hoisin sauce, left out worcestershire sauce, reduced soy sauce, and added 1/2c. of spicy Thai peanut sauce. Also used peanut oil to saute instead of vegetable oil. Full of flavor and satisfying. Make this!

My husband and I give this thumbs up! Chopping the ginger and garlic took awhile, so this time I'm using a little handy-dandy chopper.

We have been making this meal for a while now and it is one of our favorites. Pay attention with the prep and quantities (read ahead.) A great way to use ground turkey; healthy and delicious!

I rarely make a recipe without altering it. I made this exactly as printed and it was excellent. I have never found a good recipe to make with ground turkey. We will make this alot!

This was simple to make, and delicious. I did not have water chestnuts on hand- I think the dish will be better with them. I will be sure to try them next time.

AWESOME...though painfully long , once you make it you are SO glad you did. it becomes easier with consecutive preparations.

Excellent dish. Lots of prep time but minimal cooking time. We garnished it with salted peanuts.
