The good news, the pork was awesome, I did two tenderloins and it was completely consumed by 5 people. The bad news, apples were mushy and I was the only one who ate them. They were good, so were the onions, but I think that last step of adding wine/cider and reducing may have caused that. Most likely it was chef error on my part! The kids absolutely loved it. I did substitute thyme and rosemary in place of fennel seeds. Overall it was a winner.

This was a great recipe! As it was labelled effortless elegance - had unexpected guests for dinner and an unmarinated tenderloin to be cooked. I love that this didn't require a lengthy marinade like other tenderloin recipes do. It came out tender and flavorful and the onion apple mix added just the right moisture and flavor. We used fuji apples which i found very flavorful and held their form well. Love the fennel seeds in this.

Delicious! My favourite part was the apples and onions sauted in apple cider. It was even better than dipping the pork in apple sauce. I would recommend this recipe to anyone. Furthermore it was super easy to make

I made as directed, except I used regular Dijon mustard instead of whole grain. It would have been nice with a sauce but we really liked it as it was. Even my little boys enjoyed it, although they weren't fans of the mushy apples.

I was so disappointed with this recipe. The apple/ onion combination was too tart and lacked flavor and the meat needed a sauce.

I made this for company, mainly following the recipe, even though it's kind of basic, if you cook. So, good basic start, but lackluster. I ended up frying lots of whole sage leaves, crispy, to put on top, for both presentation & flavor, and I reduced some good port for underneath it all ... color, intrigue, presentation & another flavor to savor.

My husband and I both loved it. The meat was very moist and tender; the secret is in the apples. I made some changes though - used a mix of Granny Smith and fresh Honeycrisp apples for more apple flavor, used a mixture of regular Dijon and smokey coarse mustard, substituted fresh rosemary and thyme for fennel. I did not saute the apples and onions because I was afraid they would get mushy; I just coated them with a little melted butter, put some under the meat as well as on top. That way they actually got slightly brown without getting too soft. No need for wine or reduction - it was great just the way it came out of the oven and easier, too. Will definitely make again.

For ease of prep and cooking time this one's a keeper. It also presents well especially over a bed of cous cous or rice. I added a few cracked garlic cloves but that turned out to be a mistake - they charred. Love the flavor of garlic with this so will simply leve the skin on next time. Also, The quantity of wine suggested doesn't make au jus and is a bit alkaline in flavor (even after reducing). I think adding a few dashes of stock would cut that down during the reduction.

Lovely fall meal. Two of us cleaned up all the apple/onion mixture so I would double this if serving for more. I did cut the slices of both apple and onion quite thick so it somewhat held it's shape while cooking, to small will leave you with mush.

tasty! i don't like fennel seeds, so i finely chopped about a tbsp of fresh rosemary, thyme, and oregano and added that to the mustard with a few sprinkles of garlic powder. used a very large onion, so one was enough, but i did add an extra apple and reduced with 1/2 cup of white wine.

Browing the pork required more time on the flame - around 10 minutes. Be sure to pat the tenderloin completely dry before adding it to the hot pan! Large chopped the onion and apple - left the peel on for color and nutrition - and added one fennel bulb. Took the advice of other reviewers and toasted the fennel seeds, crushed them and added to whole grain mustard plus 1 tsp of dry yellow mustard. A tasty upgrade imparting more flavor to the pork. Served with sauteed spinach with garlic and an earthy South African Syrah/Mouvedre red.

Fast, easy, and good enough for a dinner party. The only (minor) issue is presentation. It reminds me too much of the bland midwestern food I grew up with! Any ideas on how to make it prettier? I served it with roasted potatoes and steamed broccoli, but I think it still needs more color.

This is so easy and amazingly good. Figure 30 minutes or so total - the challenge for me was coordinating all the other stuff I wanted to serve with this. I didn't use fennel seed. Don't worry if you don't have it in your cupboard to add, it is fab with the mustard, and the bed of onion apple?? Fantastic!!!! I will double the amount of onion and apple next time, ran out too soon, it was so wonderful.

I was hesitant(because of some of the reviews) to make this dish for company, but it sounded like the perfect fall dinner. It WAS perfect, everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. I substitued tyme for fennel (only because I had no fennel), and ended up having to cook the tenderloin longer, but that was it for modfications. The meat was moist, tender and had great flavor.

Was really quite delicious. Didn't think that it would be as good as it was based on the recipe. I used rosemary instead of fennel, since I didn't have any. And an organic stonground mustard. I also cooked the dish at 375 for about 30 minutes. Served with roasted acorn squash with butter and brown sugar and sauteed zuchinni. Great fall meal.

Rating: 4
So easy, so good. It's quick enough that it works as a weeknight dish, and yet seems special enough that I'm not embarrassed to serve it when company comes over. (Personally, I think it makes more sense to just mix the fennel seeds with the mustard before you spread it on the tenderloin instead of making it a two-step process.)

Rating: 1
I didn't get the results the other reviewers got, and I must have done something wrong but as far as I can tell, I followed directions. 450 strikes me as very high temp for pork, and it ended up burning the onions and apples to charcoal. I'm a pretty good cook, and I don't get such bad results usually. The meat turned out fine, if not slightly overdone. Was still moist enough inside. So the mustard fennel seed rub worked, was tasty.

Rating: 4
This is my favorite recipe for pork tenderloin. It also lends itself to some variation based on what you have in your kitchen. I didn't have any wine or apple cider last night but did have some apricot beer, so I coated the pork loin with an equal mixture of the mustard and some apricot jam (with a little crushed garlic thrown in), skipped the fennel, and then added some sliced dried apricots along with the apples and onion. I substituted the apricot beer for the wine/cider, and it was absolutely delicious!

This is so delicious. I cut the apples in 1/2 slices and add them toward the end of the onion browning so they are a little less soft. I also have had great success with regular whole grain mustard. Don't skimp on the fennel seeds. They add a wonderful flavor! YUM!!

I made it exactly as written, except for the Granny Smith apples. (Why do food writers always specify an apple that has no virtue beyond being crisp?) I used one Spy-Gold and one Stayman Winesap. The fennel seeds with the mustard were fabulous, and the bed of apples & onions were a perfect accompaniment. I used cider, not wine. Served with Carrot Cranberry Salad and grilled potatoes with rosemary. The pork was juicy, tender, and delicious.

This was excellent. I slightly undercooked the pork, serving the ends the first night for two of us, and reheating the center in a 300 degree oven for about 10 minutes the second time. The flavors were even better in the reheated dish.

Made this recipe exactly as written and got RAVE reviews! Be sure to use a true baking apple - Granny Smiths or Macintosh cook up nicely and make a nice velvety sauce to serve the pork on. You may have to adjust cooking time based on the width of the tenderloin. I thought the mustard and fennel seed flavor was excellent - but also let the flavor of the pork also shine through.

This was a great recipe! I made it this evening and it was as advertised - easy and pretty quick! I substituted caraway seeds for the fennel seeds, as I didn't have any on hand. Also, used Jonagold apples instead of Granny Smith, and they held together beautifully. We used apple cider instead of the white wine and it was delicious. I'll definitely be making this again!

Had to make some adjustments: no fennel so I used caraway which turned out to be a great substitution. The apples on hand were Fuji - made generous slices so they would not get mushy and it worked. Also kept the onions chunky. Tossed in left over steamed green beans and the whole thing was greatly satisfying. Easy and quic.

This is excellent! Have made several t imes. Another good side dish is - saute sliced onions in olive oil, when soft, add thin sliced napa cabbage. When cooked down, add 2-3 t. ponzi sauce and a couple splashes of lite soy sauce, season w/sea salt and cracked pepper to taste. It is GREAT!

After reading the comments, I decided to drop the apples and the fennel seeds and replace both with thin-sliced fresh fennel. I used about 40/60 fennel/onion and cooked it for longer than 5 min on the stovetop, probably 10, on nice slow heat. Used the apple cider rather than the wine at the end to bring back in the apple flavor without the mush. The onion mixture was exquisite. The fennel, the slow cooking, plus the bit of mustard and seeds that clung to it from the pork roast made it absolute perfection. The pork was good, perfectly done, pretty standard though.

I prepared this dish last evening to great raves from my guests. Like others I did not use the fennel seeds. Since others had indicated that cooking time was longer than indicated I adjusted accordingly. The Dijon mustard added a wonderful tanginess to the dish. I added golden raisens and cinnamon to the onions and apples. After sauteing them I removed them from the pan and roasted the pork alone until it reached an internal temperature of 125. I then removed the tenderloin and returned the onion-apple-raisen mix to the pot and then returned the roast to the pan cooking until it reached 150. The meat was fantastic - moist and aromatic. I served it with steamed new red and golden potatoes tossed in butter and parsley. A nice tossed salad and asparagus stir-fried in garlic completed the menu. This was very easy to prepare and I will definitely do it again.

Dish is quick and simple. After reading other reviews, I stayed away from fenel as well. Additionally, I stewed apples and onions instead with honey, brown sugar, cider vinegar, liquid smoke, and generous cinnamon. I did include some white wine dijon mustard with the mixture as well. Because the pork takes at least 30 mins (not the 15 from recipe), I added the apple/onion mixture for the last 20 minutes so it wouldn't get mushy. The sweet cinnamon flavor for the entire dish - the pork absorbs the flavor - was a hit, especially with kids.

I thought the pork was very good. I skipped the fennel and used extra stone ground mustard. I added leeks and garlic to the apple onion mixture, but it was still a bit bland for my taste...however my guests begged to differ. Overall it's a great meal...I'll find a way to jazz it up next time.

This is delicious. I used half apple juice and half dry white wine (no cider on hand), and I used honeycrisp apples because I had them. I used only 1 tsp. fennel seeds based on other reviews. The flavlors are marevelous and the effort is minimal. I will be making this again very soon.

Sooooo very delicious and very easy for a novice like me to feel like a gourmet chef when serving this. I used one gala and one granny smith apple, which I think added more sweetness to the mix, and a champagne-garlic dijon mustard I had around from a gift basket... so you can definitely experiment with some flavors in this and it is still fantastic. Pork definitely needed more than 15 minutes in the fully heated 450 degree oven, though. I don't have a convection oven so maybe that makes the difference. Will definitely make this again!

Absolutely loved it, although we changed it slightly. Brined the pork first for about an hour, in 1/4 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup salt, and 2 qts water. Left out the fennel seeds and used about half again more of the mustard. Also we used white wine, not cider. The apple-onion mixture was amazing. So good!

I loved this for an early fall change from grilling. I did pretty much what the recipe said, except I left the apples in larger chunks and sauteed the onions a little longer than the apples.

I have made this dish many times for guests. It gets rave reviews each time.

It's quick and easy . . .and everyone loves it. I've been asked for the recipe many times.

What a great recipe! The texture of the apples and onions with the white wine was superb. The pork needed considerably more than the 15 minute as set out in the recipe. I served it with green beans, boiled potatoes and a good Merlot. Fully deserving of 4 forks. Can't wait to make it again

This recipe is perfect as written! This is one of our favorites, for family dinners or company. The only adjustment I make is that the pork seems to take much longer than 15 minutes to cook -- more like 30 minutes. The flavor combination of the apples and onions is out of this world!! My finicky kids love this one too. So simple and so good.

I made this when I had zero time, whining small children, but wanted a good healthy meal for my family. AWESOME!!! My super picky husband that loves to cook requested it again, so I'll make it tonite. I used 2 tenderloins, adding extra onions & apples. Skipped the fennel seeds (didn't have- small kids won't like anyway). Didn't measure out dijon, just coated meat with it. Following advice from other readers, I left apple slices big and didn't cook apple/onion mixture a full 5 min. because apples would turn to mush.A keeper recipe,with room to play, even 10 month old had seconds and thirds!!!

This was delicious using local ingredients: cooking apples, small onions, and Devon cider. The sauce ingredients melted into one another. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it!

I didn't have dijon mustard on hand, so used spicy brown. Not thrilled with that part of the recipe, but everything else was good. I caramelized the onions ahead of time, then warmed them and combined with the apples, sauteeing for just a few minutes. Then put the browned, glazed pork on top, and cooked. Took a LOT longer than 15 minutes - more like 40, but I did cook two tenderloins. Then added the wine and reduction of the sauce only took a couple of minutes. Great flavor, not too much fuss. I'll definitely make it again, probably for company.

Made the recipe exactly, except took about 20 minutes to cook the pork, which came out perfectly done. I wouldn't use vinegar again though in the sauce; I could taste and smell the vinegar in the final sauce and I didn't care for it. I might also use less tart apples as sauce was more tart than I expected. Otherwise we thought it was delicious.

I thought this recipe was OK, but I've made other pork tenderloin recipes I like better. I think I found the fennel too overpowering, and the sauce a little too sweet (maybe it was the type of white wine I used?). Next time, I'll revert back to my standard pork tenderloin recipe, which is on this site, Ginger Marinated Pork Tenderloin - that one is a four forker in my book.

Really delicious. I made exactly according to the recipe (with a little fresh thyme in the apple/ onion). I agree with the need to cook the tenderloin longer. I served it with sauteed young turnip greens with a touch of vingar--great visual and tase contrast.

Rating: 4
Very good! It took about 30-40 minutes in the oven to get almost cooked through (I'm pregnant so I needed at least part of it well done). I agree with some of the other cooks about cutting down the saute time of the apples/onions so they don't completely melt away in the oven. I used honeycrisp apples which were flavorful and held up even in the 40 min oven time (but just barely). Don't be afraid of adding too much mustard or fennel. Even in excess they would be very complementary.

I added an anjou pear to the apples and onion, and served the whole dish over a bed of shaved fennel. The pear held its consistency very nicely, complementing the apples, with the aromatics of the fennel rounding things out nicely. Paired with Reisling.

The mustard-fennel mixture on the pork really comes into its own when placed alongside the apple/onion blend. The flavors are very subtle and mild in combination. When I make this again (which I will), I might try using a spicier, rather than sweeter, mustard, and using a bit more on the roast.

We made this for two with a boneless pork roast to have leftovers. I expected it to be tasty but was surprised at how really good it was. The mustard, onion, and wine modulate the sweetness of the fruit, and the fennel adds another dimension. We served it with roasted beets and fresh potato bread -- an outstanding meal -- and the leftovers make a great sandwich.

I followed the recipe pretty closely except that I added the cider half-way thru cooking instead of at the very end and I cooked it a little longer because I don't like it very pink in the middle. I thought it was really good. The apple mixture was tart and went really well with the pork. There really wasn't anything I would change. The fennel was a very interesting flavor.

Made this last night for a dinner party of six. Everyone loved the pork - including my fussy husband who doesn't like cooked fruit. The fennel, mustard combination was excellent. From room temperature, it took about 25 minutes to hit 150F (a PERFECT temperature - after sitting, the meat was just slightly pink) so adjust your schedule. I prepped the meat and apple mixture several hours ahead. Tripled the amount of meat for six; doubled the apple mixture. Doubling the meat might have been pretty close to enough. Cut the apples in larger chunks and added to the meat half way through the cooking process - worked well to keep mixture from mushing up. The mixture seemed too chunky however for the sliced tenderloin. Next time, I will cut the apples and onions into a large dice and add dried cranberries (the sliced onion produced wimpy rings). I'll make it ahead of time, brown it ahead of time, and add to roaster after 15 minutes. The fennel seeds on the pork seemed a little coarse to me. I liked the amount of flavor, but not the amount of seeds floating around. Next time, I'll whiz quickly in the food processor and then mix with the mustard (which I'll increase amount of if necessary) and then rub onto the tenderloins. Don't let my ramblings put you off - this is a terrific recipe that I'll definitely make again. I'm hoping that my changes will make it a Four Fork entree the next time.

This recipe is delicious. I didn't have fennel seeds and made two tenderloins but otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out perfectly.

We loved this dish. Didn't have whole grain mustard, so just used regular Grey Poupon (just fine). Also, used pears instead of apples, apple juice instead of apple cider. Used a "sweet onion."

After reviewing the other comments on this recipe I did not pre-cook the apples & onions quite as long as instructed in the recipe. Intead I cut the apples in larger slices (about 1/3" vs. 1/4") and sauteed w/ the onions for just a couple minutes before putting them in the oven with the pork. The pork turned out perfect - cooked as instructed. Served over mashed red potatoes...yummy!

We liked this recipe. I really liked the fennel seed and mustard combination. We did not sautee the apples with the onions, thanks to all previous comments, but I did roast them with the pork. I used English cooking apples. The apples did turn to mush but we did not mind. I served the pork slices to one side, some rice in th middle and green beans on the other side with the onion/apple mixture on the side and lightly draped over the pork. Looked very pretty and we thoroughly enjoyed.

I was thrown by the amount of meat (14 oz?), so I just bought a shoulder pork roast and cooked it for the amount of time specified on the packaging. The mustard and fennel crust was unusual and SO good! I didn't saute the onions and apples on the stove, I just added them to the roast in the oven about halfway through. I also poured some apple cider on the apples and onions in the oven. I didn't even have to reduce the sauce... it was the perfect consistency right out of the oven. I hate to be one of those reviewers that changes a recipe, but it turned out so well that I had to comment. The recipe might be flawed, but the ingredients were perfect together.

Very pleased with this dish. I used two double thick pork chops, and found cooking time to be just a bit less than this recipe. I cut my apples just a bit too thin and they turned "mushy"; made the apples and onions more like a chutney, but still very good. I used apple cider vinegar and found apples/onions to be too tart. Added small amounts of brown sugar to get the flavor just right. Loved the combination of pork, mustard, fennel, apples, and onions!

Like many of the other reviewers, the apples & onions do get mushy, but it did not bother me. I did not have fennel seeds but that did not matter at all. The tenderloin was very tender. However 14 oz.which was the size I had fed 2 adults & one child. I would make this again as it was very easy. It did take longer than 15 minutes. Great receipe!

I served this for company. It was nice enough but not wonderfully flavourful. Baking the apples results in a very mushy texture which didn't appeal to me.

I've made this several times with a pre-marinated pork loin (peppercorn-flavored) and left off the fennel and mustard... the apple and onion mixture always tastes great, the pork is moist and flavorful, and it's very easy.

This is so good that I always make it for guests and there are no leftovers. I found that it needs 45 min in the oven but maybe I am using extra big tenderloins, also be very generous with the mustard.

Rating: 1
If there had been a "zero fork" category, I'd have checked it instead. This recipe was not good; though I followed the instructions exactly, the apples got way too mushy, and the flavors didn't blend at all - the mustard stood out far too much. My husband tactfully had no comment, but my daughter came right out and said how bad it was.

Rating: 1
For the life of me I can not figure why all the raves for this recipe. The apple were mushy even though I cut the cooking time for them and the pork was just pork. There are so many better recipes on this site for pork tenderloin. This one won't be on my table again.

Rating: 4
Overall, I thought this was an excellent recipe. I would echo other reviewers who thought 14 oz. of tenderloin was not enough for four servings - I made two tenderloins weighing a total of 2.25 pounds. I didn't increase the amount of fennel and am glad, since the 2 tsps. seemed like plenty, even with more meat. I also increased the cooking time by about eight minutes and it was just right - the tenderloins were juicy but not pink. I didn't have the whole-grain dijon so used plain - it was fine, but I'd still like to try it with the whole-grain dijon. Since so many complained of the mushy texture of the apple/onion mix, I didn't saute the apples in advance. Instead, I sliced them a little thicker than the recipe called for and put them in during the last five minutes of roasting. They kept their shape and some of their texture and browned up nicely during the reduction process. My husband, who is normally leery of these kinds of combinations, loved the reduction and ate every bite.

Terrific recipe. I added a clove or two of garlic to pan. I had no apples, but I had a can of apricot halves. I added a few tsps of the syrup to pan to caramelize onions. Soooo easy. Least effort and time for such a tasty dish ever. Plan to make it many, many times.

This was delicious, simple and healthy. I used a boneless pork loin, not a tenderloin, which increased cooking time a little, but the results were great. I served this with sweet potato gnocchi in browned butter (also from epicurious) and spinach sautéed with garlic and oil. So good - am making this again tonight!

I have had many great recipes from this site lately--this is not one of them. I had to re-read to make sure I saw it right. This is supposed to serve 4 with only 14 oz. of meat? Is this a diet recipe? I don't know about other cooks, but I like to have enough to allow for a little more if someone is inclined. I still made it, doubling everything. In order to have the pork cooked to just pink, the onion/apple mixture turned to mush. This will not be one that I will try again.

Rating: 3
Oh no matter how hard I looked, I had just about every other herb seed in the universe but no fennel seeds. But I did have a nice fennel bulb on hand and sliced and sauteed it with the onions, adding the apples just a bit before the whole dish went into the oven. Mixed whole grain mustard with some plain dijon. Next time I will make certain I have fennel seeds and will crush them slightly, both to release the flavor and to avoid the 'chunkiness' some have mentioned. I do like the saute first/finish in the oven method for tenderloin. I used white wine and finished with a splash of calvados. A nice, simple, and quick-to-make recipe.

My boyfriend surprised me with this fabulous dish (lucky me). By combining apples, onions, dijon mustard, and fennel seeds, this dish is unique and flavorful--no single flavor dominates. According to the man (Rogerio)-it was fairly easy and quick to prepare. He served the tenderloin with roasted potatoes, steamed asparagus and green beans, and a fine glass of Charles Shaw Sauvignon Blanc. I'm ready for seconds!

This is an excellent, healthy, and relatively quick recipe to prepare. Most of the time goes into the prep of the meat and chopping the apples and onions. What I like most is that the recipe is versatile: you can dress it up for a dinner party, you can easily make it on a weeknight, and it doubles like a charm for a crowd.

This is a keeper. Used Fuji and Gala apples instead of Grannie Smith 'cause that is what I had on hand and didn't use as much fennel. Also inserted pieces of garlic in the pork for extra added zing. Husband loved it, will make again.

I made this simple yet good dish the other night. I didn't have fennel seeds on hand, and I added some leftover cubed, roast potato to the apples and onions before laying the pork on top. Otherwise I followed the recipe and was very pleased with the results. A good winter night meal that doesn't require a very fully stocked pantry.

I turned to this recipe because I grew tired of our usual soy-ginger marinade, and I thought it would appeal to my husband's Pennsylvania background. I was worried when I realized I had no fennel seeds, but we really enjoyed this recipe nonetheless. I will definitely make it for my parents, who are visiting in a few weeks. I also made butternut squash risotto from this site as an accompaniment.

This was a simple and delicious meal. I made small red potatoes with it, and put them in the pan to roast as well, so it was a one pot dinner - the sauce with the potatoes was scrumptious! Only next time, I'll make more sauce, could have used more, since the potatoes soaked it up. I cooked my meat longer in the oven. First I started it at 450 uncovered for about 15 minutes, then I covered it and turned the heat down to 350 and roasted it for another 1/2 or so. So good, will def. make again!

I made this dish last night for the second time and really love it. I agree, the apples and onions to get mushy and look nothing like the picture, but the flavors are delicious. Also, I think that in addition to the pork tasting delicious, it looks pretty on the plate with the fenel seeds and whole grain mustard. And talk about easy, this dish is a cinch. I think the cook time is more like 20 minutes though, not 15.

This was an excellent pairing, although I did not make it exactly as directed. I used a pre-marinated pork tenderloin (peppercorn), and for the apple mixture, I added the mustard to that, and instead of fennel seeds, I used fresh fennel and mixed it in with the apples and onions. I served it on Halloween for a small get together, and everyone rated it 4 forks.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe. It was fairly simple, except that a house guest would not eat onions, so I made two separate dishes.

My husband loved this. I served it with Herbed Roasted Potatoes. I didn't have a 14oz. tenderloin, only individual loin, so I cooked them on the range instead of in the oven. Didn't put the fennel seed directed on the pork. I put the fennel seed in cheese cloth and let the flavors blend in the cinder juice, onions and apples. Didn't have any Granny Smith's on hand, had Fuji Apples, and they were just fine. This is a simple yet elegant meal. This is a keeper and the husband wants me to make it again. That is the clencher, if the husband likes it.

I think this recipe is a "hit or miss" type thing. You have to really like that mustard, onion, apple type combo. I don't feel it's a good "for company" type recipe because there is no happy medium.

Nothing really fantastic,taste-wise, but the crunchy crust adds enough interest to make it worthwhile. I didn't have fennel seeds, so I substituted anise seeds and celery seeds. I also added some onion seeds (found at Indian markets) for their pretty black color. The apples and onions are just ok, so feel free to leave them out entirely.

This dish was out of this world. I am amazed how simple and delicious pork tenderloin is every time i make it, esp. because it is so tasty with fruit (apricot-ginger glaze; blackberry merlot sauce, etc.). so now i have a third fruit/pork combo that is easy and impressive. didn't have the whole grain mustard, so used regular dijon. and i didn't have the wine, so subbed chicken stock (concentrate + water) for the deglazing/reduction. and i have to say i was nervous about the fennel, because it can be a little weird here and there. but it was great with all these ingredients. the apple onion mixture was so incrediby tasty, you should make this!!!

Was looking for something different to make pork tenderloin. Very easy dish. I found this very good - nice flavors with the fennel and mustard. Not quite enough of the onion/apple mix though. I'll add more onion/apple the next time. The Apple Cider definitely makes the dish sweeter. Might try white wine the next time.

My husband liked this but I thought it was awful. Made exactly as stipulated (except I used a very good quality Calphalon pan. Wasn't about to risk my T-fal non-stick cookware). The tenderloin was done to a turn - practically melted in my mouth - but I found the apple/onion concoction horribly sweet and, frankly, unappetizing to look at. The pork, mustard and fennel combination didn't work for me either. Too much going on there. I won't make this again. There are far better things to do with a pork tenderloin!

Am I missing something? The recipe says "whole grain Dijon mustard". What's with the reviews that say Dijon would be better? I'm confused. (I always have whole grain Dijon in my fridge, but maybe it's not as common as I think?)

Rating: 4
This was really great, especially for company since you can brown the tenderllon and prepare the onions and apples for the oven in advance. The pork was oh-so-tender! I agree with a previous reviewer that Dijon mustard would be better (I always use Maille brand because I love the flavor). The whole grain mustard wasn't quite zippy enough for me. Regading the apples, I cooked them so they were soft and applesauce-like, and liked them that way. Make this and enjoy! Experimenting a little and getting to eat the results will be fun too!

Couldn't believe how good this was. Will use for company. Had to use a pork loin that had a honey mustard marinade as there wasn't any regular..bizarre, eh? But the whole dish was delish! Also didn't add apples till just before oven as suggested. The flavors are amazing.

I'd agree that the apple onion mixture was very tasty, and I would replicate that with other pork dishes.

I made this last night and it was terrific, and very east. Generally, I follow the recipe exactly the first time, and that's what I did last night. I did carmelize the apples and onions very well - which made them delicious. I like horseradish with applesauce, so I served that as a condiment. Be careful that the apples and onions don't burn in the hot oven - mine did a bit, but it was OK. With a convection oven, I used 425 degrees.
