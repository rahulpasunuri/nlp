This is a very enjoyable recipe to make, and it's pretty good. Although, I've made similar chicken dishes that call for half as many ingredients, but with equally tasty (or tastier) results, so not sure if I'd make this exact recipe again. Did thicken with flour paste as suggested, and served over egg noodles.

This is very flavorful and though a tad prep-heavy, worth the effort. I had pancetta so I diced that and crisped it in the skillet as a first step. I browned the chicken pieces in the rendered pork fat and poured off all the fat in the skillet prior to adding other ingredients. I made the dish early in the day so that I could refrigerate the meat seperately from the cooking liquids. Once cooled I removed the solidified fat on top of the liquids and discarded the fat. I put it all back into the original pot I baked it in and rewarmed it for service at dinner time. Tasty goodness, rich and satisfying. Served over mashed root vegetables with rutabaga, parsnip and redskins mashed together with butter and cream cheese, with asparagus as a side. Raves from my dinner guests.

I also followed recipe to a tee - thought it was fabulous. Yes, it's some prep work but that's what I enjoy about cooking. It's definitely a recipe I would be confident to serve to guests. As always, using a high quality chicken (free-range)insures a fabulous dish!

Total confession here: I am a food snob. With that in mind, this recipe, as written, tastes like canned food to me. Yes, it is flavorful canned food, but it does not display or taste like a high quality meal. That makes this too much prep work and too costly a meal to make again. Perhaps with fresh tomatoes and freshly prepared roasted peppers it might work? I'm just not thrilled enough with it to try that.

A lot of prep work but the final product was good. Family enjoyed it. Will make it again but in the crockpot. Ate the leftovers the next day for lunch. Yummy!

There is something about the flavors that I just really did not like. My husbzand thought it was okay. The chicken was extremely tender though.

Oh, and...I tried it with whole chicken cut into pieces in the crock pot but was just left with a lot bones in the end since the chicken falls apart. I tried it again with boneless breasts and legs and it turned out very well.

I used a crock pot and thought it turned out fabulous...the flavors melded very well. I just prepared everything as it said up until the point where you put everything into the pot and pour the wine/port mixture over the chicken. I didn't boil it after that...I just turned my crock pot on low and left it all day while I was at work (about 8am to 5pm). I didn't pour out the sauce at the end to reduce it or add the flour/butter at the end...if you cook it all day long, you don't need to reduce the sauce. I think the flavors melded better cooking it for a prolonged time.

This was just okay. I was ready for something with fabulous flavor and only got an okay. The sauce was decent but was too much work for the "okay" factor. The chicken wasn't worth seconds. Will not being doing this one again.

Excellent! As others have said, tweak with extra garlic, onions, paprika...You can make this recipe your own, but this is a fantastic base!

This was fabulous! Easy yet different, and a great meal to make ahead. My market only had shriveled up pearl onions, so I used a sweet Texas onion instead and cut it into eights. Also used a fresh red bell pepper and think I will double both onion and bell pepper amounts next time. I'd also use more garlic, probably some whole cloves next time. Served it with crusty bread and a nice Pinot Noir and it was amazing. A keeper!!

Followed the recipe to the tee (although I just used chicken thighs and legs) and it was outstanding. It requires a little preparation upfront (blanching cipolline onions, etc) but once it's all in the pot is as simple as putting it in the oven and letting the flavors meld. In the end, the sauce didn't need any additional thickening and was the perfect consistency. I'm excited to repeat this recipe again with a bigger audience - delicious.

OMG this is one of the best chicken recipes ever. I've made it twice and it just gets better. I started with brining the chicken while getting everything else ready. I had to replace prosciutto with bacon. I used the EVOO to render the bacon and used the EVOO plus bacon fat to brown the chicken. It is better with fresh roasted red peppers - skip the jarred version. I used about a cup of frozen pearl onions because they are delicious and add so much to the flavours. Thank you Bon Appetit - this one is a keeper.

Delicious! I braise often, and this is my favorite new recipe! The only change I would make would be a longer braising time. I think I cooked it about a half hour longer than it called for, and that really made a difference in how tender it was.

wowzers!! This recipe was amazing. I followed the recipe to the T and even added the butter and flour. I will be making this very often for friends and family

This was so easy and yes, even better the next day. Long cooking in wine just makes the best meat. The flavors in this recipe were good, although I would like more intensity. Maybe more garlic and salt. Great recipe for impressing a guest.

Delicious! Made it with bacon (not prosciutto) and fresh (not jarred) roasted red peppers. The smell while baking was wonderful and the taste was exceptional when done. Thank you!

This was really just ok for me. Nothing offensive but I was expecting more. The flavors just didn't come alive. I felt like it needed something more. Not sure if more garlic, some hot paprika instead of all sweet, a shot of sherry vinegar at the end or what, but it was just a bit flat given how many ingredients went into it. There are better ways to braise a chicken. Not likely to make this again.

I made this for dinner yesterday. This recipe is just wonderful. The chicken becomes so tender and flavorful. The sauce is out of this world with complex flavors. I plan on making this as a meal for company soon.

Rating: 3
Easy & tasty, and both adults & kids liked it. Used 4 lb of dark meat: 8 thighs & 5 drumsticks -- there was enough sauce that I could have had 2 more chicken pieces easily. Couldn't get cippolini onions, so used a Vidalia cut into bite-sized pieces & that was delicious. Would increase the flavor ingredients next time (garlic & dijon especially). Might reduce the flour to just 2/3 cup. We served 6 people from this. Looking forward to trying the leftovers tomorrow!

This recipe was awesome. My family does not like mustard so I left it out. I also used sauteed sliced shallots instead of the pearl onions. Made it with bone in legs and thighs; served it up on egg noodles and a side of spinach. Will definitely make this again.

My goal for this year is to make at least two recipes from each issue of the food magazines I subscribe to! This one was a great pick from Feb 2011 BA. Planned to follow the recipe but when I started my mise in place realized I had pancetta in the fridge instead of prosciutto and no port. As testified by other reviewers, no problem. I used chicken leg quarters, combo of smoked paprika, sweet and sharp paprika's, blend of Marsala, dry Sherry and Madeira for the port and added some frozen artichoke hearts. After braising I removed the chicken and allowed the sause to sit in the fridge for a bit so I could skim off the excess fat before continuing. The result was fantastic! No need to thicken. Served it with roasted asparagus and homemade fociccia (from the King Arthur's site). Definitely a keeper- only change for next time - more onions!

This recipe is average at best. The chicken is definitely tender, but the flavors are lackluster. I used bacon instead of the proscuitto and smoked Spanish paprika, but something just seemed to be missing. Based on the ingredient list, I''m honestly surprised.

100% make again. So tasty, so satisfying. Used thighs only and served over penne. I tossed in a bag of frozen pearl onions - perfect. Terrific comfort food. Mine thickened just fine with well browned thighs.

this is awesome! Easy comfort food. I added some portuguese chorico, which I sauteed with 3oz of pancetta (instead of prosciutto). I doubled the onions, and added extra white wine. I used ruby port. Legs and thighs only. Did not need thickening. Sprinkled some cayenne at the end. As always, a pinch of sugar to the sauce brings the flavors together. Served with rice. Yum!

Thought the recipe was very good. I skinned the chicken and didn't use Prosciutto. Next time will skip the first step since there was no skin to brown. Will brown the flour mixture the add the wines. Other than that, very easy and tasty.

Good use of dark meat! Definitely have bread on hand for all of the sauce, and I am looking forward to trying it on the second day.

This was really delicious. The chicken was juicy; I find it's so easy to dry out chicken. I used a Ruby (Syrah) port instead of Tawny, and it tasted fine. Mine was on the salty side, so beware adding too much. I think this would be great over egg noodles or cous cous, although I didn't serve it that way this time.

What a delicious recipe. (To make it easier I used a jar of pearl onions rathar than fresh.) I also cut the large breasts in half, although we thought it would be good cooked with all dark meat. I served it on a large platter in the middle of the table. Everyone loved dipping their bread into the extra sauce!

I doubled the onions and garlic and used smoked paprika for greater depth of flavor. My husband thought it could use diced potatoes too. It was delicious.

this was very good and really easy but I think it was the best the second day. I've made it twice - once with proscuitto and once without and it's definitely best with. Searching out those yummy onions is worth it - they're delicious. I'll definitely make again.

This is a wonderful dish. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into thirds and they were moist and tender. Alas, I couldn't use the prosciutto because of the fat content (my husband's heart healthy regimen) so I sadly substituted turkey bacon to get the smoky flavor and it was fine. Also added a bit of smoked paprika to the sauce. I did think that the flour to spices ratio was a bit much and I hated to toss all the leftover flour. So next time I'll try sprinkling on the seasonings and then flouring the chicken, or not flouring it at all.

This sounds like a great recipe, and it is my night to cook, but the only way to get this done before late evening would be to slow cook it. Any suggestions or helpful advice on whether or not it would yield the same wonderful results? Thanks``

Absolutely delicious! No need to say more!! Based on comments that the dish needed livening I made the following changes: 2 Tb paprika mixed with flour; 12 skinless bone-in chicken thighs in place of whole chicken; 16 cipolline onions; 1 whole head of garlic chopped and placed on top of chicken; approximately 3 Tb chopped italian parsley placed on top of chicken; 10 dried turkish bay leaves (I know - sounds over the top but it worked); doubled or tripled the sprinkle of paprika, 2 Tb tomato paste; nearly 3 hour cooking time in a dutch oven. There was no need to thicken the sauce. Such a wonderful meal on a cold winter night and one I hope to make for many years ahead. Thank you Bon Apetit for such a great dish.

A real winner! My whole family loved this dish, and it was so easy to make. Used drumsticks and thighs, so I can't comment on white meat timing. I used 10 pieces of chicken, because the usual 8 piece recipe is not enough for my family of 3 teen boys plus parents. The sauce was great and plentiful, and didn't need thickening. Served with Israeli couscous, salad and homemade focaccia. Delicious!

Rating: 4
MY NEW FAVORITE!!! I used 1/2 sharp and 1/2 sweet paprika. A little more than called for in the "sprinkle 1/4 t" instruction. We are going to add more white onions (b/c we like them)...that's about it. Used only thighs. BUT...loved, loved loved it. There's a magic that happens to the sauce and we can't figure out what/how it happens. Can't wait to make it again!

Rating: 3
Perfect "fireside" one dish meal! I made it yesterday to allow the flavors to marry-but I agree that it did need some "brightening up", in both taste and color.I took the suggestions of several reviewers and I added frozen artichoke hearts,peas and manzanilla olives when I reheated...delicious results!Also, I didn't have Port so I used a very dry Sherry and vermouth instead.

Excellent - easy and very flavorful. Roasted my own peppers on the stovetop. Prepared it a day ahead to let the flavors blend as suggested. Next time will use legs and thighs alone, as we are dark meat lovers. Great winter meal!

super delicious and simple. ate it with country bread, broad egg noodles, and braised parsnips/carrots/shallots. made it as is, except added a little chicken stock to the braising pot b/c i was worried the liquid looked a little low (i used a slightly bigger bird). ended up making the faux butter roux and thickening it for about 3 minutes at the end. awesome awesome awesome.

Quite yummy. The flavors are excellent. I made as a one pot meal. Served with a mixed brown rice. I did add olives and artichoke hearts during the braising. No need to thicken the sauce. I will add this to my recipe box.

This is a wonderful braised one-pot dish. The flavors are rich and complex. Next time if I use a whole chicken, I will reserve the chicken breast and add them to the braising liquid after the first 45 minutes of baking time. The thighs, legs and wings were moist and tender. The cooking liquid did not need thickening.

This was fabulous! I used boneless thighs and twice the tomato paste and didn't have tawny port so added a shot of whiskey to the wine -- it was gorgeous and not a drop left over! Didn't need to thicken it, served over ww cous cous and broccolini on the side. BF said SAVE THIS RECIPE!

I hate to disagree with the rest of the reviewers, but we did not care for this dish. Not a bad dish, just a flavor that didn't make me want to eat it all week. I usually make a dish on Sunday that we can eat throughout the week. We actually threw out the leftovers. I skinned the chicken to cut down on the fat adn the chicken was wonderfully tender. The overall flaver profile was kind of a ketchupy, mustardy, barbeque saucey flavor.....sweet/sour/tangy....

My husband cooks during the week and I cook on the weekends - I came home from the gym Saturday morning and made this exactly as is - my husband walked in and was in heaven due to the aroma that was filling the kitchen - it was done about 3:30 in the afternoon and the intent was we would eat it on Sunday as we were going out to dinner - well, no, that didn't happen, around 4:00 we both had a plate and a glass of wine - this is a wow recipe and we will be making this for a family birthday dinner. We had baked rice and saute of broccolini with it and it was fantastic. Needless to say, Saturday night, we drank a little wine and split an appetizer when we went out to dinner!

Rating: 3
Flavorful and delicious - we enjoyed it very much! This would be an excellent do-ahead recipe for a dinner guests. I will admit to some concern about the high fat content, but it is not something that would prepare often. I prepared the recipe exactly as written. However, I browned the chicken very well to render off as much fat as possible from the skin and poured off every drop of fat before adding the wine and Port to the skillet drippings. I used Applegate Farms Natural Prosciutto, which is lean but still contains 4 gm fat/ounce.

Rating: 3
My husband and I really enjoyed this, but I think it needs a little something to brighten it just a bit. I will make it again, but I think I will add some gold raisins, or maybe some green olives (or both.) Maybe not truly Portuguese, but with the other flavors I think those will be a good addition. I think I might also add peas at the last minute for just a little more bright color.

This recipe will be one I will make again and again. The house smelled fabulous the entire time it was cooking. Not only does it look lovely, it takes terrific. I didn't have tawny port so substituted Moscato Wine and it was fine. I would like to try it with the port though so I will get some to have on hand for the next time I make this.

The flavor of this recipe is exceptional. The aroma while cooking was divine. I followed the directions except that I used a cup of white wine since I had no port. The only negative is that I cooked the dish as per the recipe time, and the chicken was a bit loose and stew like. Next time I will check after an hour. Will definitely make this again.

I made this for my family tonight and I had to hold myself back, the house smelled soooo good while it cooked. The only substitutions I made was that I had to use a gluten free flour mix because of an allergy in my family & I used a vidalia onion cut into wedges as there were no pearl onions available. Being new to using a gluten free flour mix, I didn't know how it would effect the recipe, but the chicken browned beautifully & the sauce was a perfect silky consistency. I only used 1/2 Tablespoon of the butter/GF flour mixture at the end to thicken it just slightly. Now all the chicken is gone, but I have enough sauce to create another meal out of it......I can't wait!!!
