This recipe was my mother's special recipe at Christmas, and there were never enough to go around. It is, as they say, labour intensive, but worthe every bit of it. It is easier if you place the half teaspoon of nut filling in the center, then at the bottom place the quarter of merichino cherry, then with spatula flip both sides over. Be very careful about cooking times with this cookie. It is not meant to be hard, nor soft. Experiment first, and the convection idea is one I am going to try this year. Also, you may need more than one batch of nut filling for the entire recipe.

This recipe has been in my family for years, I have a feeling all of our mothers/grandmothers found the recipe in the same magazine! I would suggest substituting some cinnamon for the ginger, or adding it along with the ginger. That might make it a little more palatable.

This is my favorite Christmas cookie. My Mom has made them since the 1950s. I made them recently and found they came out best in my convection oven on convect bake at 325 for 10 minutes. The dough is very sticky; chilling doesn't help much, so you need to use a lot of flour when rolling them out. You can brush off the excess with a pastry brush before putting them down on the cookie sheet. These are labor-intensive (as are most cookies you have to roll and cut out), but they are uncommon and very good.

I did not like these at all. I ended up spreading the dough out in a sheet pan, layering the nut filling, topping with more dough and then spaced the cherries on top and cut them into squares. The bells were too time consuming and ended up looking like amimal faces with red tongues sticking out. I even tried using a bell cookie cutter. The ginger was too strong (and I am a gingerbread house baker)
