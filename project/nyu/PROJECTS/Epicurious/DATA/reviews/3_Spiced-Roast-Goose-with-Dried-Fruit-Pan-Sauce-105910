This is the 4th year I will be making this goose recipe for my family for Christmas. It is always delicious (and beautiful). As with any bird (or meat) for that matter, you will depend on your meat thermometer to tell you when the bird is done. You can buy veal demi-glace or veal stock from caterers and specialty stores. I recommend this recipe as is - wouldn't change a thing. My entire family is looking forward to enjoying a traditional goose dinner again this year!

I have made this recipe for a couple of years now, and it turns out very well. I also made a 14 pound goose and had to be careful not to overcook it--a good meat thermometer helps. The aromatic crushed spices on the skin complement the flavor of the goose.

I always find it interesting when a) a recipe is reviewed by someone who hasn't made it yet, b) a recipe is rated 3 or 4 forks and yet the only ingredient the reviewer didn't change was the main one...Anyway - I tried goose for the first and last time. Nothing terrific about it and the sauce needs a lot of doctoring. Pass.

I couldn't find goose, so used duck. Bought two ducks, roasted one the day before and took off most of the meat, then boiled it with the water left over from rehydrating the fruit to make stock for the sauce. That made it a little bit sweet for my taste, but it works. I also used juniper berries and whole cloves in the rub the bird gets before roasting.

I quite like the sound of this, but like the previous correspondent, the cooking time sounds far too long. Indeed, I'm thinking more of 2 1/2 hours when I do the deed tomorrow. I'm returning to my Mother's Protestant roots and cooking goose rather than turkey for Christmas. I'm starting with one key concept: a goose is just a very large duck. So, orange sauce with blackberries and Armagnac! For the stock, I brown the wing tips, toss in a few aromatics, cover with water and simmer for a few hours. Along with the bird, roasted shallots and cippolini with balsalmic & port, wild mushrooms in cream sauce, string beans and the ever popular layered potatoes with gruyere. Merry Christmas!

This Goose is very tasty. But the timing is incorrect for cooking. I made a 14.5 Lb goose - it took only three hours to roast. For the sauce you better start 4 days ahead to make the demiglase.I found it impossable to find in the store. Also to save money on this expensive sauce by using any dry brandy. I used Korbel vsop.
