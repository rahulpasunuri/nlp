So delicious and easy. I made this on Christmas eve and popped it in the oven on Christmas morning. It took a little longer b/c it went in to the oven cold. I added diced deli ham and used skim milk instead of whole milk and it was delicious. We even ate it for leftovers the next morning and it was great.

Excellent and so easy to make. I didn't have grated nutmeg, so used powdered nutmeg. It was creamy goodness!

I substitued this as a last minute dish I made for Christmas brunch. So glad I did, it was very easy to make. It was oh so good!

Thanks to vikingdandy for the crabmeat idea - I had promised my mom crab quiche for Christmas brunch but made this instead, with half a pound of claw meat. Easy and absolutely delicious. I agree with cook from Miami - next time I'll turn off the convection too.

This was very nice. I added about 1/2 cup of chopped fresh dill and 1/4 cup minced fresh thyme in addition to the chives, which gave an herb-y boost, and used a good gruyere. Only thing is - be careful if baking in a convection oven. This over-browned very quickly, due to the amount of milk and cheese no doubt. Next time I will turn off the convection. I will make again - a pleasant alternative to quiche or strata.

I was looking for a custard recipe to make Crabmeat custards with. This one was perfect. I just added the Crabmeat with the cheese and chives and baked them in individual ramekins. A delicious and rich holiday side dish or starter. The delicate flavors didn't upstage the amazing jumbo lump crabmeat.

I didn't care for this. I thought it was overly salty (barely called for any salt, but I wish I wouldn't have put any in) and just generally unimpressive. Wouldn't make again.

Was hosting a brunch for twelve-- adults and children-- and wanted to do as much ahead of time as possible. Stumbled upon this recipe-- gruyere, whole milk, eggs, cream cheese-- what's not to like? It was terrific. Lovely custard texture, kind of like a savory creme brulee without the brulee. Big hit with all, young and old.

I make this again and again when I have guests for brunch. It's super simple and it never fails to elicit 'mmmms' from my guests. It's true that the punch of flavor comes from the cheese - so whatever you use be sure it has great flavor. I've used different types of cheese but a good gruyere is still my favorite.

Unbeliebably good, for the effort required. Using a good Gruyere is key, makes it a very sophisticated dish.

I made this for Christmas Brunch today, with a mixture of cheddar and parmesan instead of gruyere, and green onions chopped very finely instead of chives. It's what I had on hand. Still fabulous. Very easy, but leave it in the oven for an additional 5 minutes once the center has "set" or let it rest 10 minutes out of the oven for the eggs to finish cooking.

This egg mixture was delicious! Super easy. I added probably 1/4 c more cheese and use 1/2 fat free cream cheese and 1/2 regular (what I had on hand). Jwong_2000 is right, my house smelled wonderfully yummy. All brunch guests were very excited to try it and totally pleased. I'll take this one to the beach for Thanksgiving.

This is an easy recipe to take to the cottage for a crowd which is what I did. Prepared the egg mixture, put in juice container and next morning put together and baked. Everyone enjoyed and I will definately make again. Another way to do eggs for a crowd !

This dish does have a mild flavor tending toward almost no flavor at all. It was very easy, but sometimes you have to put in a little more effort to get a better result. Pass on this one.

Easy, elegant and delicious as is. I think it could serve as a backdrop for your own favorite herbs and cheese.

Easy and very good. Would make it again for a brunch when a simple egg dish is needed.

Flavor is mild but great for entertaining. I measured/prepared the ingredients ahead of time and then assembled right before putting in the oven. Allows you to spend time with your brunch guests.

I was certain I would love this based on the reviews and my love of each of the ingredients, but it was just ok. Mine didn't puff, maybe because I didn't use a blender, but my food processor? I served it at room temp. (sat out for 1 hour before serving) and it was not good cold. All of that said, my guests all said they loved it, but I wonder if they were just being polite. Won't make it again :(

Outstanding! I made this exactly as listed and we loved it. Will absolutely become a go-to recipe.

Not too bad, but with the grated cheese, cream cheese, and eggs...I had trouble enjoying it knowing how bad this was for me. But can't argue with the taste.

This dish was very easy to prep and just as easy to cook. Don't be alarmed when the grated egg and chive mixture floats around inside the egg custard when you first pour it in, even if it floats to the top. That's supposed to happen. Served at a holiday brunch and everyone commented on how good this dish was as they polished it off. Will definitely make this one again.

I made this for Christmas morning and it was extremely easy and quick to prepare. I served it with leftover ham, some pastries, and fruit. It was nice because rather than being an all- in-one breakfast casserole, it was just the eggs. My husband's parents raved over it. Easy and elegant!

Simple and fantastic! Served this for brunch yesterday, and had none left!
