I used Coconut Milk instead of regular and the outcome was fantastic. It was creamy, not icy, and since the pineapples were almost too ripe, they were very sweet. It was delicious and I'm so glad I found this recipe :)

The taste was very good but it was icy in comparison to other sherbets I have made.

I whisked the sugar into the milk to dissolve, instead of using simple syrup (although, I can see the merits of simple syrup because it lets one control the amount of sugar added to the overall recipe.) The mixture was divine tasting until I added the lemon juice, which imparted a bitter aftertaste. I will omit the lemon juice next time.

I did not use a simple syrup..all that water would make the sherbet icier than necessary..so I used superfine sugar instead. I was extremely tempted to scald the milk first..it's a fact that scalded milk in ice cream makes it creamier. Everyone else raved even with the simple syrup, but my result was super-creamy and it eliminated a step. With Baker's sugar readily available these days, no reason for it anymore. I also added 1/4 cup of evaporated milk, also for texture.

This was wonderful- the pineapple flavor was very intense even though I came up a cup short. I'm sure it will be even better when made with the full three cups. This is a perfect summer dessert- light and refreshing.

This was absolutely delicious and so refreshing! A good sized pineapple was just enough for the 3 cups of puree, so I would recommend having an extra on hand for garnishing. I used 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of plain yogurt and I think it made it even creamier. Depending on the sweetness of your pineapple, you might not even need the simple syrup mixture, or at least maybe not all of it. I served it on top of grilled pineapple slices and it was a perfect ending to a summer cookout.
