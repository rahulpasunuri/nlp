I prefer balsamic vinegar in this recipe. Fresh ground cardamom makes a significant difference in this recipe over cardamom powder.

I use this for a potato salad dressing. Yukon gold potatoes, and green onions with this dressing. My family loves it and it is different from the regular mayo potato salads.

Very nice and so simple. Can be a bit overpowering if you're serving with a nice salmon or similar. Great over green beans too. You could probably skip the cardamom in a pinch as it was nearly undetectable.

A bit sharp for my tastes, but my family loved it.

I mixed it in the food processor - whirled everything except the oil, then dripped the oil in. It only took a couple of minutes. I also didn't have any cardamom so I left it out. It was great with the steamed potatoes and green beans also.

Delicious! We used half the oil and it was wonderful. I forgot how much I love fresh dill. I can't eat dairy and was searching for an alternative to go with salmon. This was great.
