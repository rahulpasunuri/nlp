This is pretty tasty. I added a touch of lemon juice to give it a little more flavor.

So delicious. A nice alternative to pine nut/basil pesto. I used with the parsnip soup, which was nice. But then I used it on pasta (I had made a lot), and it was fantastic.

Well I must confess that I "doctored" this a bit by adjusting amounts and proportions and I added some Italian variety breadcrumbs and extra Parmesan cheese to absorb the oil but I am delighted! The remaining "paste" will come in real handy over the next week or two! (PS. I also thin with butter when I use it in a sautee).

This is a wonderful and unusual gift to give for the holidays, easy to make and a great compliment to many dishes and soups
