We made this with honey tangerines. The texture was lovely. It was very sweet - might try mixing a bit of zest with the sugar to coat the dish next time to balance the sweetness a bit. We were confused by the coulis recipe - the juice didn't thicken at all and made the souffle very soggy when served together; although this could have been corrected with a bit of cornstarch or gel, we wanted to give the recipe a chance to prove itself. Do other tangerine varieties behave differently, perhaps?

I did half of the recipe for 2 people and it was more than enough. I cut down a little on the sugar. I cooked in indiv ramekins and it took far less time to cook - around 15-20mins there was too much citrus sauce for the amount of souffle so I'd say half of that is enough for the whole recipe. Also you really need to puree the sauce for a long time I found it still somewhat lumpy despite a long run in the blender Overall a fair bit of work but a very nice dessert

My husband says this is a keeper - the two of us almost ate all of it. And I say not so fast there - takes considerable time and can't be made ahead of time. It is light and delicious. 1/2 of sauce would have been more than enough. I used Clementines - think I should have taken sections out of skin - a little bit of a bitter taste. Baked 40 minutes - maybe a little brown.
