I love deviled eggs and I love beets but I didn't think the combo was that great. And I didn't like the color of the yolk with the added beet juice. I served these as an appetizer at Thanksgiving and they were all consumed. But no one thought they were as good as the more traditional recipe. I would not make them again.

Quite good. Easy.

Love the look and flavor. I didn't bother to to press the mix through a strainer but will if I plan to serve to guests. Definitely worth the effort to make your own pickled beets. Would recommend that some of the beet slices be cut in thinner slices if you want the beautiful fine dice as shown in the picture. Leftover beets are a great addition to a salad and the juice makes a great base for a beautiful vinegrette!

I've made this several times. Use canned pickled beets, diced finely, to save time.

Made these for Thanksgiving - they were devoured. We did have a lot of leftover pickled beet.
